In [[ethics]] and [[governance]], '''accountability''' is answerability, [[blameworthiness]], [[legal liability|liability]], and the expectation of account-giving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dykstra|first=Clarence A.|date=February 1938|title=The Quest for Responsibility|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=33|issue=1|pages=1–25|doi=10.2307/1949761|publisher=The American Political Science Review, Vol. 33, No. 1|jstor=1949761}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an aspect of [[governance]], it has been central to discussions related to problems in the [[public sector]], [[nonprofit]] and private ([[corporate]]) and individual contexts. In leadership roles,&lt;ref&gt;Williams,  Reyes(2006) Leadership accountability in a globalizing world. London: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; accountability is the acknowledgment and assumption of responsibility for actions, [[Product (business)|products]], decisions, and policies including the [[Administration (business)|administration]], governance, and implementation within the scope of the role or employment position and encompassing the obligation to report, explain and be answerable for resulting consequences.

In governance, accountability has expanded beyond the basic definition of "being called to account for one's actions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mulgan|first=Richard |year=2000|title='Accountability': An Ever-Expanding Concept?|url=|journal=[[Public Administration (journal)|Public Administration]]|volume=78|issue=3|pages=555–573|doi=10.1111/1467-9299.00218}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sinclair|first=Amanda |year=1995|title=The Chameleon of Accountability: Forms and Discourses|url=|journal=Accounting, Organizations and Society |volume=20|issue=2/3|pages=219–237|doi=10.1016/0361-3682(93)E0003-Y}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is frequently described as an account-giving relationship between individuals, e.g. "A is accountable to B when A is obliged to inform B about A's (past or future) actions and decisions, to justify them, and to suffer punishment in the case of eventual misconduct".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schedler|first=Andreas|editor=Andreas Schedler |editor2=Larry Diamond |editor3=Marc F.

Accountability is an element of a [[Responsibility assignment matrix|RACI]] to indicate who is ultimately answerable for the correct and thorough completion of the deliverable or task, and the one who delegates the work to those responsible.

There are various reasons (legitimate or excuses) why accountability fails.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Accountable Partner – Why You Fail - Katy Christian Magazine|url = http://katychristianmagazine.com/2015/12/accountable-partner-why-you-fail/|website = Katy Christian Magazine|access-date = 2016-02-13|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and etymology==
"Accountability" stems from late Latin ''accomptare'' (to account), a prefixed form of ''computare'' (to calculate), which in turn derived from ''putare'' (to reckon).&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary 2nd Ed.&lt;/ref&gt;
While the word itself does not appear in English until its use in 13th century Norman England,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dubnick|first=Melvin|editor=Charles Sampford |editor2=Noel Preston |editor3=C.

==Types==
Bruce Stone, O.P. Dwivedi, and Joseph G. Jabbra list 8 types of accountability, namely: moral, administrative, political, managerial, market, legal/judicial, constituency relation, and professional.&lt;ref&gt;Jabbra, J. G. and Dwivedi, 0. P. (eds.), ''Public Service Accountability: A Comparative Perspective'', Kumarian Press, Hartford, CT, 1989, {{ISBN|0-7837-7581-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leadership accountability]] cross cuts many of these distinctions.

===Political===
{{Anchor|Political accountability}}
Political accountability is the accountability of the [[government]], [[civil servants]] and [[politicians]] to the public and to legislative bodies such as a [[congress]] or a [[parliament]].

Hirschman makes substantial contributions to accountability theory, positing exit or voice as pivotal accountability mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Exit, Voice, and Loyalty: Responses to Decline in Firms, Organizations, and States.|last=Hirschman|first=Albert O.|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1970|isbn=9780674276505|location=Cambridge, Mass|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between the governor and governed (i.e., [autonomous (auto) - dependent (dep)], [auto-auto], [dep-dep], [dep-auto] ) functions such that the prospect of citizen exit can, not only disciplines ex ante, but also ex post if the state is dependent on the citizens. The literature connects this disposition of autonomy or dependence to its [[fiscal capacity]]. States that are most responsive adjust to exit or voice. Clark &amp; Golder model the dynamics of Hirschman's theory and elaborate important aspects like those that operationalize loyalty as an active choice.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, William Roberts, Matt Golder, and Sona N. Golder. 2013. “Power and politics: insights from an exit, voice, and loyalty game.” Unpublished manuscript, University of Michigan and Pennsylvania State University.&lt;/ref&gt; Exit, voice, and loyalty will be expressed in different ways under differing regimes and given the relevant assumptions. All three of these sufficiently broad categories present ways and means of holding the state accountable.

[[Recall election]]s can be used to revoke the office of an elected official. Generally, however, voters do not have any direct way of holding elected representatives to account during the [[term of office|term]] for which they have been elected. Additionally, some officials and legislators may be appointed rather than elected. [[Constitution]], or [[statute]], can empower a [[legislative body]] to hold their own members, the government, and government bodies to account. This can be through holding an internal or independent [[inquiry]]. Inquiries are usually held in response to an allegation of misconduct or corruption. The powers, procedures and sanctions vary from country to country. The legislature may have the power to [[impeach]] the individual, remove them, or suspend them from office for a period of time. The accused person might also decide to [[resign]] before trial. [[Impeachment in the United States]] has been used both for elected representatives and other civil offices, such as [[United States district court|district court]] [[judge]]s.

In parliamentary systems, the government relies on the support or parliament, which gives parliament power to hold the government to account. For example, some parliaments can pass a [[vote of no confidence]] in the government.

Belsky et al. point out, whereas, under more democratic governance accountability is built into the institution of the state by a habit of regular elections, accountability in autocratic regimes &lt;ref&gt;Besley, Timothy and Masayuki Kudamatsu. 2007. “[http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/3764/1/Making_Autocracy_Work.pdf Making Autocracy Work].” Working paper.&lt;/ref&gt; relies on a selectorate; a group that legitimizes or delegitimizes the autocrats powers according to [[selectorate theory]]. The primary mechanism at a selectorate's disposal is deposition, which is a form of exit. Beyond that institutions can act as credible restraints on autocracy as well.

Researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] found that empowering citizens in developing countries to be able to hold their domestic governments to account was incredibly complex in practice. However, by developing explicit processes that generate change from individuals, groups or communities ([[Theories of Change]]), and by fusing political economy analysis and [[outcome mapping]] tools, the complex state-citizen dynamics can be better understood. As such, more effective ways to achieve outcomes can hence be generated.&lt;ref&gt;Tembo, F., March 2012, [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=6318&amp;title=state-accountability-citizen-voice-mwananchi Citizen voice and state accountability: towards theories of change that embrace contextual dynamics] ''Overseas Development Institute'', retrieved 23 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers at the International Budget Partnership (IBP) found that civil society organizations play an important role in achieving accountability outcomes. The IBP case studies showed that CSOs can have an impact in a broad array of political and economic contexts. The researchers concluded that CSOs are most effective when they draw in a broad web of actors from across the accountability system, including the media, auditors, donors, the legislature, executive insiders, and political parties.&lt;ref&gt;van Zyl, Albert, October 2013, [http://internationalbudget.org/wp-content/uploads/CSO-transparency-and-accountability-Governance-HEC-conference.pdf Greasing the Wheels of the Accountability System: How Civil Society Organizations Close the Gap between Transparency and Accountability], ''International Budget Partnership'', retrieved 1 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethical===
{{See also|Social accounting|Environmental accounting}}

Within an organization, the principles and practices of ethical accountability aim to improve both the internal standard of individual and group conduct as well as external factors, such as sustainable economic and ecologic strategies. Also, ethical accountability plays a progressively important role in academic fields, such as laboratory experiments and field research. Debates around the practice of ethical accountability on the part of researchers in the social field – whether professional or others – have been thoroughly explored by Norma R.A. Romm in her work on Accountability in Social Research,&lt;ref name=romm&gt;{{cite book|last=Romm|first=Norma R.A.|title=Accountability in Social Research|year=2001|publisher=Klower Academic|location=New York|isbn=978-0-306-46564-2|url=https://www.springer.com/social+sciences/book/978-0-306-46564-2?detailsPage=reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt; including her book on New Racism: Revisiting Researcher Accountabilities, reviewed by Carole Truman in the journal Sociological Research Online.&lt;ref name=truman&gt;{{cite web|last=Truman|first=Carole|title=Review of New Racism: Revisiting Researcher Accountabilities|url=http://www.socresonline.org.uk/16/2/reviews/3.html|publisher=Sociological Research Online|accessdate=27 August 2012|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Here it is suggested that researcher accountability implies that researchers are cognizant of, and take some responsibility for, the potential impact of their ways of doing research – and of writing it up – on the social fields of which the research is part. That is, accountability is linked to considering carefully, and being open to challenge in relation to, one's choices concerning how research agendas are framed and the styles in which write-ups of research "results" are created.

===Administrative===
Internal rules and norms as well as some independent commission are mechanisms to hold civil servants within the administration of government accountable. Within department or ministry, firstly, behavior is bound by rules and regulations; secondly, civil servants are subordinates in a hierarchy and accountable to superiors. Nonetheless, there are independent "watchdog" units to scrutinize and hold departments accountable; legitimacy of these commissions is built upon their independence, as it avoids any conflicts of interests.
The accountability is defined as "an element which is part of a unique responsibility and which represents an obligation of an actor to achieve the goal, or to perform the procedure of a task, and the justification that it is done to someone else, under threat of sanction".&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite conference|author=Feltus C. |title=Aligning Access Rights to Governance Needs with the Responsibility MetaModel (ReMMo) in the Frame of Enterprise Architecture |date=2011 |url=http://dial.academielouvain.be/handle/boreal:144013 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140724221935/http://dial.academielouvain.be/handle/boreal%3A144013 |archivedate=24 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Security ===
{{Anchor|Security accountability}}
The traceability of actions performed on a system to a specific system entity (user, process, device). For example, the use of unique user identification and authentication supports accountability; the use of shared [[user ID]]s and [[password]]s destroys accountability.

===Individuals within organizations===
Because many different individuals in large organizations contribute in many ways to the decisions and policies, it is difficult even in principle to identify who should be accountable for the results. This is what is known, following Thompson, as the problem of many hands.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Dennis (2005). “The Problem of Many Hands” in ''Restoring Responsibility: Ethics in Government, Business and Healthcare''. Cambridge University Press. pp. 33-49. {{ISBN|978-0521547222}}&lt;/ref&gt; It creates a dilemma for accountability. If individuals are held accountable or responsible, individuals who could not have prevented the results are either unfairly punished, or they "take responsibility" in a symbolic ritual without suffering any consequences.  If only organizations are held accountable, then all individuals in the organization are equally blameworthy or all are excused. Various solutions have been proposed.  One is to broaden the criteria for individual responsibility so that individuals are held accountable for not anticipating failures in the organization. Another solution, recently proposed by Thompson, is to hold individuals accountable for the design of the organization, both retrospectively and prospectively.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Dennis F. (2014). "Responsibility for Failures of Government: The Problem of Many Hands," ''American Review of Public Administration'' '''44''' (3): 259–273.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Constituency relations ===
Within this perspective, a particular agency of the government is accountable if voices are heard from agencies, groups or institutions outside the public sector representing citizens' interests from a particular constituency or field. Moreover, the government is obliged to empower members of agencies with political rights to run for elections and be elected; or, appoint them into the public sector as a way to make the government representative and to ensure that voices from all constituencies are included in policy-making.

===Public/private overlap===
With the increase over the last several decades in public service provided by private entities, especially in Britain and the United States, some have called for increased political accountability mechanisms for otherwise non-political entities.    Legal scholar Anne Davies, for instance, argues that the line between public institutions and private entities like corporations is becoming blurred in certain areas of public service in the United Kingdom, and that this can compromise political accountability in those areas.  She and others argue that some administrative law reform is necessary to address this accountability gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.competition-law.ox.ac.uk/members/profile.phtml?lecturer_code=daviesa |title=oxford law - the faculty and its members : anne davies |publisher=Competition-law.ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With respect to the public/private overlap in the United States, public concern over the contracting of government services (including military) and the resulting accountability gap has been highlighted recently following the shooting incident involving the Blackwater security firm in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/ed_harriman/2007/09/blackwater_poisons_the_well.html |title=Blackwater poisons the well |publisher=Commentisfree.guardian.co.uk |date=2007-09-28 |accessdate=2009-08-26 | location=London | first=Ed | last=Harriman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary studies==
Accountability involves either the expectation or assumption of account-giving behavior. The study of account giving as a sociological act was articulated in a 1968 article on "Accounts" by Marvin Scott and Stanford Lyman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scott|first=Marvin B.|author2=Lyman, Stanford M.|date=February 1968|title=Accounts|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=33|issue=1|pages=46–62|doi=10.2307/2092239|pmid=5644339|publisher=American Sociological Review, Vol. 33, No. 1|jstor=2092239}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it can be traced as well to [[J. L. Austin]]'s 1956 essay "A Plea for Excuses",&lt;ref&gt;Austin, J.L. 1956-7. A plea for excuses. Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society.
Reprinted in [[J. O. Urmson]] &amp; [[G. J. Warnock]], eds., 1979, J. L. Austin: Philosophical Papers, 3rd edition. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 175-204.&lt;/ref&gt; in which he used excuse-making as an example of [[speech act]]s.

Communications scholars have extended this work through the examination of strategic uses of excuses, justifications, rationalizations, apologies and other forms of account giving behavior by individuals and corporations, and [[Philip Tetlock]] and his colleagues have applied experimental design techniques to explore how individuals behave under various scenarios and situations that demand accountability.

Recently, accountability has become an important topic in the discussion about the legitimacy of international institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grant|first=Ruth W.|author2=Keohane, Robert O.|year=2005|title=Accountability and Abuses of Power in World Politics|url=|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=99|issue=1|pages=29–43|doi=10.1017/S0003055405051476}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because there is no global democratically elected body to which organizations must account, global organizations from all sectors  bodies are often criticized as having large accountability gaps. The Charter 99 for Global Democracy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oneworldtrust.org/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_download&amp;gid=14&amp;Itemid=55 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516034551/http://www.oneworldtrust.org/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_download&amp;gid=14&amp;Itemid=55 |archivedate=16 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; spearheaded by the [[One World Trust]], first proposed that cross-sector principles of accountability be researched and observed by institutions that affect people, independent of their legal status. One paradigmatic problem arising in the global context is that of institutions such as the [[World Bank]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]] who are founded and supported by wealthy nations or individuals and provide grants and loans, to developing nations. Should those institutions be accountable to their founders and investors or to the persons and nations they lend money to? In the debate over [[global justice]] and its distributional consequences, Cosmopolitans tend to advocate greater accountability to the disregarded interests of traditionally marginalized populations and developing nations. On the other hand, those in the [[Nationalism]] and Society of States traditions deny the tenets of [[moral universalism]] and argue that beneficiaries of global development initiatives have no substantive entitlement to call international institutions to account. The [[One World Trust]] Global Accountability Report, published in a first full cycle 2006 to 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oneworldtrust.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=73&amp;Itemid=60|title=Global Accountability Report (GAR)|author=Administrator|work=oneworldtrust.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124021950/http://www.oneworldtrust.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=73&amp;Itemid=60|archivedate=24 January 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one attempt to measure the capability of global organizations to be accountable to their stakeholders.

===Accountability in education===
Student accountability is traditionally based on hang school and classroom rules, combined with sanctions for infringement. As defined by National Council on Measurement in Education (NCME), accountability is "A program, often legislated, that attributes the responsibility for student learning to teachers, school administrators, and/or students. Test results typically are used to judge accountability, and often consequences are imposed for shortcomings."&lt;ref&gt;National Council on Measurement in Education http://www.ncme.org/ncme/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary1.aspx?hkey=4bb87415-44dc-4088-9ed9-e8515326a061#anchorA {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170722194028/http://www.ncme.org/ncme/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary1.aspx?hkey=4bb87415-44dc-4088-9ed9-e8515326a061#anchorA |date=22 July 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, some educational establishments such as [[Sudbury Valley School|Sudbury schools]] believe that students are personally responsible for their acts, and that traditional schools do not permit students to choose their course of action fully; they do not permit students to embark on the course, once chosen; and they do not permit students to suffer the consequences of the course, once taken. Freedom of choice, freedom of action, freedom to bear the results of action are considered the three great freedoms that constitute personal responsibility. Sudbury schools claim that {{"'}}[[Value (ethics)|Ethics]]' is a course taught by life experience". They adduce that the essential ingredient for acquiring values—and for moral action is personal responsibility, that schools will become involved in the teaching of morals when they become communities of people who fully respect each other's right to make choices, and that the only way the schools can become meaningful purveyors of ethical values is if they provide students and adults with real-life experiences that are bearers of moral import. Students are given complete responsibility for their own education and the school is run by a [[direct democracy]] in which students and staff are equals.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, D.

Data were drawn from an extensive set of field notes made in an ethnographic study at Sudbury Valley School (an ungraded, democratically structured school in Framingham, MA), where students, ranging in age from 4 to 19, are free to choose their own activities and companions. Vignettes were analyzed using grounded theory approach to qualitative analysis, and themes were developed from an analysis of observations of meetings. Each theme describes a participation level that students assume in the process and that provide opportunities for them to develop and deepen understanding of the balance of personal rights and responsibilities within a community. The study adds to the understanding of education and child development by describing a school that differs significantly in its practice from the wider educational community and by validating Kohlberg's thesis about developing moral reasoning.

==Standards==
Accountability standards have been set up, and organizations can voluntarily commit to them. Standards apply in particular to the non-profit world and to [[Corporate Social Responsibility]] (CSR) initiatives. Accountability standards include:
* [[INGO Accountability Charter]], signed by a large number of [[NGOs]] to "demonstrate their commitment to accountability and transparency"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ingoaccountabilitycharter.org/about-the-charter/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517195312/http://www.ingoaccountabilitycharter.org/about-the-charter/ |archivedate=17 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[AccountAbility's AA1000 series]]. "principles-based standards to help organisations become more accountable, responsible and sustainable. They address issues affecting governance, business models and organizational strategy, as well as providing operational guidance on sustainability assurance and stakeholder engagement"&lt;ref&gt;Website: {{cite web |url=http://www.accountability.org/standards/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130908225546/http://www.accountability.org/standards/index.html |archivedate=8 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Humanitarian Accountability Partnership (HAP)]] 2010 standards. A standard for humanitarian organizations to help them "design, implement, assess, improve and recognize accountable programmes"&lt;ref&gt;Webpage: {{cite web|url=http://www.hapinternational.org/projects/standard/hap-2010-standard.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703175310/http://www.hapinternational.org/projects/standard/hap-2010-standard.aspx |archivedate=3 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition, some non-profit organizations set up their own commitments to accountability:
* Accountability, Learning and Planning System (ALPS) by [[ActionAid]],  a framework that sets out the key accountability requirements, guidelines, and processes.&lt;ref&gt;ActionAid (2005). [[ALPS - Accountability, Learning, and Planning System]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed symbolism==
[[Viktor Frankl]], neurologist, psychiatrist, author, and founder of [[logotherapy]] and one of the key figures in [[existential therapy]], in his book ''[[Man's Search for Meaning]]'' recommended "that the [[Statue of Liberty]] on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] (that has become a symbol of [[Liberty]] and [[Political freedom|Freedom]]) should be supplemented by a [[Statue of Responsibility]] on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast."]] Frankl stated: "Freedom, however, is not the last word. Freedom is only part of the story and half of the truth. Freedom is but the negative aspect of the whole phenomenon whose positive aspect is responsibleness. In fact, freedom is in danger of degenerating into mere arbitrariness unless it is lived in terms of responsibleness."&lt;ref&gt;[[Viktor Frankl|Frankl, Viktor Emil]] (1956) ''[[Man's Search for Meaning]]'', p. 209-210.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Warnock, C. (2005) [http://www.heraldextra.com/news/article_21e93a1f-94db-5533-9e5c-0560fff08972.html "Statue of Responsibility,"] DAILY HERALD. Retrieved 24 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andreas Grunschloss''' (German: '''Grünschloß''') (born 1957) is German scholar and the current Professor of [[Religious Studies]] at [[Göttingen University]]. An ordained [[Protestant]] [[pastor]], he is the author of books and scholarly articles about [[interfaith]] matters and [[new religious movements]]. He publishes both in German and in English and is a co-editor of the ''[[Marburg Journal of Religion]]''.

==Academic career==
Grunschloss studied Protestant [[theology]], religious science and psychology at [[Tübingen University]], the [[University of Michigan]] (M.A. in Religious Studies, 1984) and [[Stanford University]]. (Ph.D. in Religious Studies and Missionary Science, 1992, followed by [[habilitation]] in 1998).&lt;ref name=HP&gt;[http://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/55241.html Home page] at the [[Göttingen University]] website&lt;/ref&gt; He is also an ordained Protestant [[pastor]].&lt;ref name=HP /&gt; Having first taught at [[Mainz University]], he became Professor of Religious Studies at [[Göttingen University]] in 2002.&lt;ref name=HP /&gt;

Grunschloss has been a co-editor of the English-language ''[[Marburg Journal of Religion]]'', a [[peer-reviewed]] academic Internet journal, since 1999.&lt;ref name=HP /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-marburg.de/fb03/ivk/mjr?language_sync=1 Marburg Journal of Religion]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his research and publications, Grunschloss is concerned with interfaith matters. He has authored a book-length German-language study of the work of [[Wilfred Cantwell Smith]] (''Religionswissenschaft als Welt-Theologie: Wilfred Cantwell Smiths interreligiöse Hermeneutik'', 1994), described in the ''Journal of Ecumenical Studies'' as "the most comprehensive, balanced account and evaluation of the life and work of Wilfred Cantwell Smith".&lt;ref&gt;[[Klaus Klostermaier|Klostermaier, Klaus K.]] [https://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst;jsessionid=Mb3Lbp3pT8GC49sJdfxhY3FcjggWpCpnQ4PcBsLDZZTvl3cvvSQ9!1602411919!2006442032?docId=5001526799 "Religionswissenschaft als Welt-Theologie: Wilfred Cantwell Smiths interreligiose Hermeneutik"], ''Journal of Ecumenical Studies'', Vol. 34, 1997. Retrieved 2010-06-18.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Der eigene und der fremde Glaube: Studien zur interreligiösen Fremdwahrnehmung in Islam, Hinduismus, Buddhismus und Christentum'' (1999), he wrote about how members of one religion perceive those belonging to other faiths; he argues that as each religion postulates that it has privileged access to the knowledge of how things should be, it fails to see others as they really are, only ever perceiving them from a self-referential perspective as different: assuming a religious identity simultaneously creates the "other".&lt;ref&gt;Danz, Christian. ''Einführung in die Theologie der Religionen'', LIT Verlag, Münster 2005, p. 229, {{ISBN|978-3-8258-7058-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grunschloss has also written about [[new religious movements]], notably [[UFO religion]]s such as [[Raëlianism]] and [[Uriella|Fiat Lux]], as well as [[Scientology]] and authors such as [[Erich von Däniken]].&lt;ref name=OON&gt;[http://www.nachrichten.at/nachrichten/kultur/linz09/art470,105714 "Lieber nicht an Aliens glauben"], ''Oberösterreichische Nachrichten''. Retrieved 2010-06-18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Lewis |first=James R. |authorlink=James R. Lewis (scholar) |title=Scientology |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2009 |location=New York, NY | pages=225–243 | isbn=978-0-19-533149-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grunschloss puts the appeal of UFO religions down to several factors. The thought that there should be angels or aliens overseeing human development is profoundly consoling; and members' sense that they are becoming "light workers" by joining such a movement allows them to feel enhanced self-worth, as they believe they are among the chosen few destined to prepare the [[new age]].&lt;ref name=OON /&gt; Lastly, Grunschloss says, as the established religions lose their mass appeal, it is only natural that some will be attracted to "freelance" spiritual workers; he sees the most effective response to this development not in an assertion of church tradition, but in retaining the ability to engage in dialogue.&lt;ref name=OON /&gt; Observing that UFO religions tend to combine [[euhemerism]] (by reinterpreting celestial beings simply as morally and technologically more advanced aliens) with a distinctly "religious" personal quest, Grunschloss has concluded that "UFO faith, therefore, can be understood to oscillate between ''disenchantment'' and ''re-enchantment''."&lt;ref&gt;Partridge, Christopher.

'''Anthropotechnic''' is a term used in [[art]], [[science]] and [[literature]] to denote something with aspects of both man and machine.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;Charwat, Hans Jürgen: Lexikon der Mensch-Maschine-Kommunikation. Oldenbourg, 1994, {{ISBN|3-486-22618-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Painting]]s such as [[Max Ernst]]'s "Oedipus Rex" are early examples of the use of this quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.famous-painters.org/Max-Ernst/Oedipus-Rex.shtm |title=Oedipus Rex - Max Ernst Painting Gallery |publisher=Famous-painters.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In technology, it is any field of science that attempts to make machines and automation more user-friendly. In sociology, it is used to describe the relationship between man and anything that is perceived as inflexible or inhumane such as slavery, religion or animals.

==Uses==
* In her book ''Education in Human Creative Existential Planning'', [[Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka]] uses the term Genetic Anthropotechnic as a means of ensuring that only the desired characters are inherited by future generations of human beings though the usage of genetics and hence, avoidance of the "fatalism" of inheritance.&lt;ref name="Tymieniecka2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka|title=Education in Human Creative Existential Planning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5sG8NuWEIuIC&amp;pg=PA24|accessdate=26 February 2012|year=2008|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-6301-5|pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in her ''Phenomenology of Life from the Animal Soul to the Human Mind: In search of experience '', she uses the term Anthropotechnic with reference to the ability of human being to turn animals from being dangerous to "human-friendly".&lt;ref name="Tymieniecka2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka|title=Phenomenology of Life from the Animal Soul to the Human Mind: In search of experience|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3l8yyvfH5AQC&amp;pg=PA8|accessdate=26 February 2012|date=3 June 2007|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-5191-3|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In their book ''In Medias Res: Peter Sloterdijk's Spherological Poetics of Being'', Willem Schinkel uses the term Anthropotechnic to define cultural forms of automated mental and physical exercises that we humans exhibit in the face of ambiguous risk.&lt;ref name="SchinkelNoordegraaf-Eelens2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Willem Schinkel|author2=Liesbeth Noordegraaf-Eelens|title=In Medias Res: Peter Sloterdijk's Spherological Poetics of Being|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QCHqEP1r4FcC&amp;pg=PA8|accessdate=26 February 2012|date=15 February 2012|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|isbn=978-90-8964-329-2|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Askania-Nova''' ({{lang-uk|Асканія-Нова}}) is a [[biosphere reserve]] (sanctuary) located in [[Kherson Oblast]], [[Ukraine]], within the dry [[Taurida]] [[steppe]] near [[Oleshky Sands]]. The reserve consists of a zoological park, a botanical (dendrological) garden, and an open territory of virgin steppes.
[[File:Аскания-Нова (заповедник).jpg|thumb|]]
== History ==
[[File:Rote Insel15.JPG|100px|left|thumb|The tomb of Falz-Fein]]
The nature reserve was established in 1898 by [[Friedrich-Jacob Eduardovych Falz-Fein]] (1863–1920) around the German colony of Askania-Nova, which only in 1890 became an organized settlement, [[Khutir]].

In March 1919, Askania-Nova was confiscated from the Falz-Fein family by the [[Red Army]] as part of the state nationalization programme. The last owner refused to evacuate to Germany. She was Sofia-Louise Bohdanivna (Gottlieb) Knauff (1835–1919), the mother of Friedrich Falz-Fein. Her refusal resulted in her summary execution by two Red Army guardsmen who shot her for failing to surrender her estate in [[Khorly]] (today a port in [[Kherson Oblast]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dezimmer.net/NabokovFamilyWeb/nfw01/nfw01_187.htm Falz-Fein Lineage] {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 1, 1919, Askania-Nova was declared a People's [[Zapovednik|Sanctuary Park]] by a decree of the [[Council of People's Commissars]] of the Ukrainian SSR; while on February 8, 1921, it was reorganized into a State Steppe Reserve of the Ukrainian SSR. The main purposes of the reserve was to preserve and study the environment of the virgin steppe as well as possibly to acclimatize and study a larger number of animal and plant types. Askania-Nova became a scientific-steppe station, a zoo-technical station with breeding farms, a [[phyto]]-technical station, and included various other scientific institutions. Notably, the zoo and botanical garden were greatly expanded. Part of the reserve included portions of steppe reserve, an acclimatization zoo, and an [[arboretum]]. From 1932 to 1956, the reserve was transformed into the All-Union scientific-research institute for the hybridization and acclimatization of animals of M. Ivanov. It consisted of 12 departments (including the botanical garden, steppe reserve steppe, and zoo), nine laboratories, conducting experimental farming, and four breeding centres for agricultural animals. The institute became the centre of scientific-researching works in the field of breed creation and the major hub for breeding farms. During both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], the reserve was devastated.

In 1983, Askania-Nova was reorganized into a [[biosphere reserve]] and the following year it was designated as the Soviet member of the [[World Network of Biosphere Reserves]] of [[UNESCO]]. After the fall of the [[Soviet Union]], in 1993, [[Ukraine]] confirmed the status of the biosphere reserve Askania-Nova.

[[Image:Askania.jpg|thumb|Jubilee coin dedicated to 100th Anniversary of Ascania Nova Reserve]]

The reserve consists of the acclimatization zoo, arboretum (2.1&amp;nbsp;km², or 518.9 acre), and virgin [[steppe]] sanctuary (110&amp;nbsp;km², or 42.5 sq mi), the last such area in Europe) and has total area of 825&amp;nbsp;km² (318.5 sq mi).

In addition to local species it hosts ostriches, bison, antelopes, wild horses, llamas, zebras and many bird species. More than 200 species of foliaceous and coniferous plants were brought from different parts of the world and planted in the dendrologic garden during 1885 – 1902. About 600 higher plants (both perennial and annual), 16 species of which were entered to the Red Data Book of Ukraine, have been preserved in their primary natural form.

The reserve is known for a group of [[Przewalski's Horse]], the largest group kept in captivity, living on area around 30&amp;nbsp;km² (11.5 sq mi).

The [[Turkmenian kulan]] (''Equus hemionus kulan'') has been reintroduced to the Askania-Nova reserve.

The Askania-Nova wetland Great Chapli Depression is registered on the International list of [[Ramsar Convention]] and has an area of 4x6 km.

Part of the sanctuary include a small town and six villages with total population of 10,000 people (1997). There is no direct railroad station in the area and the sanctuary can be reached by bus.

In 2008, Askania was named one of [[Seven Natural Wonders of Ukraine]].

The sanctuary is located in a relatively remote area. Its territory completely overlaps the Askania Nova municipality which beside its [[Askania-Nova (settlement)|main town]] includes five small rural settlements:&lt;ref&gt;[http://w1.c1.rada.gov.ua/pls/z7502/A004SNP?rdat1=27.03.2011&amp;rf7571=35215 List of settlements of Askania-Nova municipality] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110901211545/http://w1.c1.rada.gov.ua/pls/z7502/A004SNP?rdat1=27.03.2011&amp;rf7571=35215 |date=September 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Illinka (569), Komysh (313), Molochne (762), Novyi Etap (72), Pytomnyk (859); and a separate rural municipality of Markeyevo (783) consisting a former village of the same name. Towards the sanctuary and the town of Askania-Nova leads a "spur" of the regional route &lt;small&gt;{{Road marker simple|Road P47 (Ukraine)|P47|white|black|black}}&lt;/small&gt; which branches out from the main route near the village of Chkalove (Novotroitske Raion). The main route of &lt;small&gt;{{Road marker simple|Road P47 (Ukraine)|P47|white|black|black}}&lt;/small&gt; runs from [[Kherson]] to [[Henichesk]] and intersects European routes &lt;small&gt;{{European route E|58}}&lt;/small&gt; and &lt;small&gt;{{European route E|105}}&lt;/small&gt;.

The '''Association of Information Technology Professionals''' ('''AITP''') is a [[Professional organization|professional association]] that focuses on [[information technology]] education for business professionals. The group is a non-profit [[United States|US]]-oriented group, but its activities are performed by 62 local chapters organized on a geographic basis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Professional Chapter List|url=http://www.aitp.org/?page=Chptmap|work=AITP.org|accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 286 student chapters at college and universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Student Chapter List|url=http://www.aitp.org/?page=FindStuChap|work=AITP.org|accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The group was first organized in [[Chicago]], United States, in 1949, as the '''National Machine Accountants Association''' ('''NMAA''').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Johnson | first=Charles | title=Data Processing: 1958 Proceedings | year=1958 | publisher=National Machine Accountants Association | location=Paris, Illinois | page=412 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The State of Illinois granted the NMAA a charter on December 26, 1951. It soon had over 20 chapters. Harvey W. Protzel, systems manager for Protzel's Company, was elected the first International President at the 1952 First Annual Convention in [[Minneapolis]]. In 1962, it adopted the more inclusive name, '''Data Processing Management Association''' ('''DPMA'''), and in 1996, the present name.

The Association began its certification program with the Certificate in Data Processing (CDP) professional examination, first  held in 1962 in [[New York City]]. In 1970, it added  the Registered Business Programmer (RBP) examination. In 1974, the Association joined in establishing the [[Institute for the Certification of Computing Professionals|Institute for the Certification of Computer Professionals]] (ICCP) to administer the examination program and stimulate industry acceptance of the examinations. The certification is now called [[Certified Computing Professional]] (CCP)'''.

In 1969, the Association created the annual DPMA Man of the Year Award, awarding it (incongruously, given its name) to [[Grace Hopper|Dr. Grace Murray Hopper]]. After Dr. Ruth Davis of the US [[National Bureau of Standards]] won the 1979 award,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aitp.org/?page=DISA DISA Award Winners], AITP.&lt;/ref&gt; it was renamed the Distinguished Information Sciences Award.

==Ethics==
The Association requires its members to abide by a [[code of ethics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Code of Ethics &amp; Standards of Conduct|url=http://www.aitp.org/?page=EthicsConduct&amp;hhSearchTerms=%22ethics%22|work=AITP.org|accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; that has been in place for decades,  predating both the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|HIPAA]] and [[Sarbanes-Oxley]] legislation. The Association also requires members to operate by a ''"Standards of Conduct"'' for IT Professionals, which adds specifics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Code of Ethics - Standards of Conduct|url=http://www.aitp.org/resource/resmgr/forms/code_of_ethics.pdf|work=AITP.org|accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7601">'''Building performance''' is an attribute of a [[building]] that expresses how well that building carries out its functions. It may also relate to the [[performance]] of the building [[construction]] process. Categories of building performance are quality (how well the building fulfils its functions), [[resource]] saving (how much resource is needed to fulfil its functions) and [[workload]] capacity (how much the building can do). The performance of a building depends on the response of the building to an external [[structural load|load]] or shock. Building performance plays an important role in [[architecture]], [[building services engineering]], [[building code|building regulation]], [[architectural engineering]] and [[construction management]]. Prominent building performance aspects are [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], [[thermal comfort]], [[indoor air quality]] and [[daylighting]].

==Background==
{{cleanup rewrite|date=October 2016}}
Building performance has been of interest to humans from the very first shelters built to protect us from the weather, natural enemies and other dangers. Initially design and performance were managed by craftsmen who combined expertise in both domains. More formal approaches to building performance appeared in the 1970s and 1980s, with seminal works being the book on ''Building Performance''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Building Performance|last=Markus et al|first=|publisher=Applied Science Publishers LTD|year=1972|isbn=085334 542 2|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''CIB Report 64''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=CIB Report 64 - Working with the Performance Approach in Building|last=CIB Working Commission W60|first=|publisher=International Council for Building Research Studies and Documentation|year=1982|isbn=|location=Rotterdam|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Further progress on building performance studies took place in parallel with the development of building science as a discipline, and with the introduction of personal computing (especially computer simulation) in the field; for a good overview of the role of simulation in building design see the chapter by Augenbroe&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The role of simulation in performance based building. In: Hensen and Lamberts (eds), Building performance simulation for design and operation.|last=Augenbroe|first=Godfried|publisher=Spon Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-415-47414-6|location=Abingdon, Oxon|pages=15-36}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A more general overview that also includes physical measurement, expert judgement and stakeholder evaluation is presented in the book ''Building Performance Analysis''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Building Performance Analysis|last=de Wilde|first=Pieter|publisher=Wiley Blackwell|year=2018|isbn=9781119341925|location=Hoboken / Chichester|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== '''ASHRAE Performance Measurement Protocols''' ===
Although many buildings in the U.S., Canada, U.K., and elsewhere claim to be “green,” “low energy,” or “high performance,” it is rarely clear on what evidence or data these claims are based. Such claims cannot be credible without standardized performance measurement protocols that are applied consistently. If claims of superior building performance are to be believed, it is essential that a common set of measurements be used and the results reported against meaningful benchmarks. Such protocols are also needed to give usable feedback to building designers and operators when measured performance does not match design intent.  &lt;ref name="ASHRAE"&gt;https://www.ashrae.org/resources--publications/periodicals/ashrae-journal/features/measuring-commercial-building-performancel{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This article describes ASHRAE’s Performance Measurement Protocols for Commercial Buildings (PMP), which provides a standardized, consistent set of protocols, for a range of cost/accuracy, to facilitate the appropriate comparison of measured energy, water, and indoor environmental quality (thermal comfort, indoor air quality [IAQ], lighting, and acoustics) performance of commercial buildings, while maintaining acceptable levels of building service for the occupants. Benchmarks are included in the protocols to facilitate comparison to peer buildings or for self-reference over time (often before and after retrofit). A recent article describing just the acoustic performance measurement protocols in the PMP has been published in the ASHRAE Journal. 
The PMP is a collaborative effort of ASHRAE, the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC), and the Chartered Institution of Building Service Engineers (CIBSE). It began with a detailed evaluation of literature related to measured building performance that included databases, measurement techniques, M&amp;V protocols, and available instrumentation. A project committee representing several ASHRAE Technical Committees (TCs 7.6, 7.9, 4.7, and others) developed the content.

The protocols identify what to measure, how it is to be measured (instrumentation and spatial resolution), and how often it is to be measured for inclusion in the building’s operation and maintenance plan. For each of the six measure categories (energy, water, thermal comfort, IAQ, lighting, and acoustics), protocols are developed at three levels: low, medium and high cost and accuracy, providing a range of choices for levels of effort, detail, and rigor to characterize the building stock, and comparison to appropriate benchmarks.

For each measure category and each level, the following characteristics are described: 
* Objectives of the measurement. 
* Metrics to be used, including instrumentation and units of measure.  
* Performance evaluation and benchmarks. Estimates of initial and recurring costs are included. 
In the PMP, first the six measure categories are addressed at the basic level. This is followed by a presentation of the intermediate level protocols and then the advanced level protocols. However, here we will primarily discuss the basic level protocols, with only a brief description of higher levels; details of the intermediate and advanced levels are described in the PMP.  

Representative measures at each level were tested by applying them to the newly renovated ASHRAE Headquarters Building in Atlanta (facing page). Measurements were taken by the commissioning authority for the renovation during 2009 and 2010, after the renovated building was reoccupied and was undergoing post-occupancy commissioning. Occupant surveys were taken before and after the renovation to evaluate indoor environmental quality.

'''Crime mapping''' is used by analysts in [[law enforcement agency|law enforcement agencies]] to map, visualize, and analyze crime incident patterns.  It is a key component of [[crime analysis]] and the [[CompStat]] policing strategy.  Mapping crime, using [[Geographic information system|Geographic Information Systems]] (GIS), allows crime analysts to identify [[Crime hotspots|crime hot spots]], along with other trends and patterns.

==Overview==
Using GIS, crime analysts can overlay other datasets such as [[census]] [[demographics]], locations of [[pawnbroker|pawn shops]], schools, etc., to better understand the underlying causes of [[crime]] and help [[police|law enforcement]] administrators to devise strategies to deal with the problem.  GIS is also useful for law enforcement operations, such as allocating police officers and dispatching to [[9-1-1|emergencies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.esri.com/library/brochures/pdfs/crime-analysis.pdf|title=Crime Analysis: GIS Solutions for Intelligence-Led Policing|last=esri|first=|date=|website=esri.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Underlying theories that help explain spatial behavior of criminals include [[environmental criminology]], which was devised in the 1980s by Patricia and Paul Brantingham,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Environmental Criminology|year=1981|publisher=Waveland Press|isbn=0-88133-539-8|editor-last=Brantingham|editor-first=Paul J.|editor2-last=Brantingham|editor2-first=Patricia L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[routine activity theory]], developed by Lawrence Cohen and Marcus Felson and originally published in 1979,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Lawrence E.|last2=Felson|first2=Marcus|title=Social change and crime rate trends: A routine activity approach|journal=American Sociological Review|year=1979|volume=44|issue=4|pages=588–607|doi=10.2307/2094589|publisher=American Sociological Association|jstor=2094589}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[rational choice theory (criminology)|rational choice theory]], developed by Ronald V. Clarke and Derek Cornish, originally published in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Cornish | first=Derek | last2=Clarke | first2=Ronald V. | title=The Reasoning Criminal | publisher=Springer-Verlag | year=1986 | isbn=3-540-96272-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In recent years, crime mapping and analysis has incorporated spatial data analysis techniques that add [[statistics|statistical]] rigor and address inherent limitations of spatial data, including spatial [[autocorrelation]] and spatial heterogeneity.  Spatial data analysis helps one analyze crime data and better understand why and not just where crime is occurring.

Research into computer-based crime mapping started in 1986, when the [[National Institute of Justice]] (NIJ) funded a project in the [[Chicago Police Department]] to explore crime mapping as an adjunct to [[community policing]]. That project was carried out by the CPD in conjunction with the Chicago Alliance for Neighborhood Safety, the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]], and [[Northwestern University]], reported on in the book, ''Mapping Crime in Its Community Setting: Event Geography Analysis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maltz|first=Michael D.|last2=Gordon|first2=Andrew C.|last3=Friedman|first3=Warren|title=Mapping Crime in Its Community Setting: Event Geography Analysis|year=2000|origyear=1990|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=New York|isbn=0-387-97381-8|url=http://www.uic.edu/depts/lib/forr/pdf/crimjust/mappingcrime.pdf|edition=Internet}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The success of this project prompted NIJ to initiate the Drug Market Analysis Program (with the appropriate acronym D-MAP) in five cities, and the techniques these efforts developed led to the spread of crime mapping throughout the US and elsewhere, including the [[New York City Police Department]]'s [[CompStat]].

==Applications==
Crime analysts use crime mapping and analysis to help law enforcement management (e.g. the police chief) to make better decisions, target resources, and formulate strategies, as well as for tactical analysis (e.g. crime forecasting, [[geographic profiling]]).  [[New York City]] does this through the [[CompStat]] approach, though that way of thinking deals more with the short term.  There are other, related approaches with terms including Information-led policing, [[Intelligence-led policing]], [[Problem-oriented policing]], and [[Community policing]].  In some law enforcement agencies, crime analysts work in civilian positions, while in other agencies, crime analysts are sworn officers.

From a research and [[public policy|policy]] perspective, crime mapping is used to understand patterns of [[prison|incarceration]] and [[recidivism]], help target resources and programs, evaluate [[Crime prevention through environmental design|crime prevention]] or crime reduction programs (e.g. Project Safe Neighborhoods, Weed &amp; Seed and as proposed in ''[[Broken windows theory|Fixing Broken Windows]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kelling|first=George|last2=Coles|first2=Catherine|title=Fixing Broken Windows: Restoring Order and Reducing Crime in Our Communities|isbn=0-684-83738-2|year=1997|publisher=Simon &amp;amp; Schuster|place=New York|origyear=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and further understanding of causes of crime.

The boom of internet technologies, particularly web-based geographic information system (GIS) technologies, is opening new opportunities for use of crime mapping to support crime prevention. Research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leong|first=Kelvin.|last2=Chan|first2=Stephen|title=A content analysis of web-based crime mapping in the world's top 100 highest GDP cities|journal=Crime Prevention and Community Safety|year=2013|volume=15|pages=1–22|doi=10.1057/cpcs.2012.11|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicates that the functions provided in web-based crime mapping are less than in most traditional crime mapping software. In conclusion, existing works of web-based crime mapping focus on supporting community policing rather than analytical functions such as pattern analysis and prediction.

'''DNA computing''' is a branch of [[computing]] which uses [[DNA]], [[biochemistry]], and [[molecular biology]] hardware, instead of the traditional silicon-based [[computer]] [[technology|technologies]].  Research and development in this area concerns theory, experiments, and applications of DNA computing. The term "molectronics" has sometimes been used, but this term had already been used for an earlier technology, a then-unsuccessful rival of the first [[integrated circuit]]s;&lt;ref&gt;"Molectronic Computer Shown by [[Texas Instruments|Texas Instr.]]", unknown publication, circa 1963, in Box 2, Folder 3, listed in ''[[Jack Kilby]] Papers: A Guide to the Collection'', Southern Methodist University. [http://lib.texas.edu/taro/smu/00116/smu-00116.html]{{Dead link|date=July 2015}}.&lt;/ref&gt; this term has also been used more generally, for molecular-scale electronic technology.&lt;ref&gt;"Application-specific methods for testing molectronic or nanoscale devices" (filed April 1, 2004), Patent US 7219314 B1.  [http://google.com/patents/US7219314] .&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Len-mankin-pic.jpg|thumb|200 px|[[Leonard Adleman]], the inventor of DNA computing|alt=A photograph of Loenard Aldeman, the inventor of DNA computing]]
This field was initially developed by [[Leonard Adleman]] of the [[University of Southern California]], in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Adleman | first1 = L.

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lila Kari |author2=Greg Gloor |author3=Sheng Yu | date=January 2000 | title = Using DNA to solve the Bounded Post Correspondence Problem | journal = Theoretical Computer Science | volume = 231 | issue = 2 | pages = 192&amp;ndash;203 | url = http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/kari00using.html | doi=10.1016/s0304-3975(99)00100-0 }} &amp;mdash; Describes a solution for the bounded [[Post correspondence problem]], a hard-on-average NP-complete problem. Also available here: [http://www.csd.uwo.ca/~lila/pdfs/Using%20DNA%20to%20solve%20the%20Bounded%20Post%20Correspondence%20Problem.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

While the initial interest was in using this novel approach to tackle [[NP-hard]] problems, it was soon realized that they may not be best suited for this type of computation, and several proposals have been made to find a "[[killer application]]" for this approach. In 1997, computer scientist Mitsunori Ogihara working with biologist Animesh Ray suggested one to be the evaluation of [[Boolean circuit]]s and described an implementation.&lt;ref&gt;M. Ogihara and A. Ray, [http://wwwcp.tphys.uni-heidelberg.de/comp-phys/handouts/Boolean2.pdf "Simulating Boolean circuits on a DNA computer"].

In 2002, researchers from the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]] in Rehovot, Israel, unveiled a programmable molecular computing machine composed of enzymes and DNA molecules instead of silicon microchips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/02/0224_030224_DNAcomputer.html |title=Computer Made from DNA and Enzymes |accessdate=2009-11-26 |last=Lovgren |first=Stefan |date=2003-02-24 |work=National Geographic }}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 28, 2004, [[Ehud Shapiro]], Yaakov Benenson, Binyamin Gil, Uri Ben-Dor, and Rivka Adar at the [[Weizmann Institute]] announced in the journal [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] that they had constructed a DNA computer coupled with an input and output module which would theoretically be capable of diagnosing [[cancer]]ous activity within a cell, and releasing an anti-cancer drug upon diagnosis.&lt;ref name="shapiro_cancer"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Benenson | first1 = Y. | last2 = Gil | first2 = B. | last3 = Ben-Dor | first3 = U. | last4 = Adar | first4 = R. | last5 = Shapiro | first5 = E. | title = An autonomous molecular computer for logical control of gene expression | doi = 10.1038/nature02551 | journal = Nature | volume = 429 | issue = 6990 | pages = 423–429 | year = 2004 | pmid =  15116117| pmc =3838955 |bibcode = 2004Natur.429..423B }}.

In January 2013, researchers were able to store a JPEG [[photograph]], a set of Shakespearean sonnets, and an audio file of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]'s speech [[I Have a Dream]] on [[DNA digital data storage]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/347702/description/DNA_stores_poems_a_photo_and_a_speech DNA stores poems, a photo and a speech | Science News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, researchers created a [[transcriptor]] (a biological transistor).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bonnet | first1 = Jerome | last2 = Yin | first2 = Peter | last3 = Ortiz | first3 = Monica E. | last4 = Subsoontorn | first4 = Pakpoom | last5 = Endy | first5 = Drew | year = 2013 | title = Amplifying Genetic Logic Gates | url = http://science.sciencemag.org/content/340/6132/599 | journal = Science | volume = 340 | issue = | pages = 599–603 | doi=10.1126/science.1232758| bibcode = 2013Sci...340..599B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, researchers used the CRISPR gene-editing system to insert a GIF of a galloping horse and rider into the DNA of living bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shipman|first1=Seth L.|last2=Nivala|first2=Jeff|last3=Macklis|first3=Jeffrey D.|last4=Church|first4=George M.|title=CRISPR–Cas encoding of a digital movie into the genomes of a population of living bacteria|journal=Nature|date=12 July 2017|volume=547|issue=7663|pages=345–349|doi=10.1038/nature23017|url=https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature23017.html|accessdate=14 November 2017|language=en|bibcode=2017Natur.547..345S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Idea ==
The organisation and complexity of all living beings is based on a coding system functioning with four key components of the [[DNA molecule|DNA-molecule]]. Because of this, the DNA is very suited as a medium for data processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Amos | first1 = Martyn |display-authors=etal | year = 2002 | title = Topics in the theory of DNA computing | url = | journal = Theoretical computer science | volume = 287 | issue = 1| pages = 3–38 | doi=10.1016/s0304-3975(02)00134-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to different calculations a DNA-computer with one liter of fluid containing six grams of DNA could potentially have a memory capacity of 3072 [[exabyte]]s. The theoretical maximum data transfer speed would also be enormous due to the massive [[Parallel computing|parallelism]] of the calculations. Therefore, about 1000 [[FLOPS|petaFLOPS]] could be reached, while today's most powerful computers do not go above a few dozen (99 petaFLOPS being the current record).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pierce et al |title=Current resolution of data in DNA computing |journal=Bioinformatics Research |date=2016 |volume=88 |issue=34 |pages=435-451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pros and cons ==
The slow processing speed of a DNA-computer (the response time is measured in minutes, hours or days, rather than milliseconds) is compensated by its potential to make a high amount of multiple parallel computations. This allows the system to take a similar amount of time for a complex calculation as for a simple one. This is achieved by the fact that millions or billions of molecules interact with each other simultaneously. However, it is much harder to analyze the answers given by a DNA-Computer than by a digital one.

== Examples/Prototypes ==
In 1994 [[Leonard Adleman]] presented the first prototype of a DNA-Computer. The [[:de:TT-100|TT-100]] was a test tube filled with 100 microliters of a DNA-solution. He managed to solve for example an instance of the directed [[Hamiltonian path]] problem.&lt;ref&gt;Braich, Ravinderjit S., et al. "Solution of a satisfiability problem on a gel-based DNA computer." ''DNA Computing''. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2001. 27-42.&lt;/ref&gt;

In another experiment a simple version of the “[[travelling salesman problem]]” was “solved”. For this purpose, different DNA-fragments were created, each one of them representing a city that had to be visited. Every one of these fragments is capable of a linkage with the other fragments created. These DNA-fragments were produced and mixed in a [[test tube]]. Within seconds, the small fragments form bigger ones, representing the different travel routes. Through a chemical reaction (that lasts a few days), the DNA-fragments representing the longer routes were eliminated. The remains are the solution to the problem. However, current technical limitations prevent evaluation of the results. Therefore, the experiment isn’t suitable for application, but it is nevertheless a [[proof of concept]].

=== Combinatorial problems ===
First results to these problems were obtained by [[Leonard Adleman]] ([[NASA]] [[JPL]])
* In 1994: Solving a [[Hamiltonian path problem|Hamiltonian path]] in a graph with 7 summits.
* In 2002: Solving a [[NP-complete]] problem as well as a [[3-satisfiability|3-SAT]] problem with 20 variables.

=== Tic-tac-toe game ===
In 2002, J. Macdonald, D. Stefanovic and Mr. Stojanovic created a DNA computer able to play [[tic-tac-toe]] against a human player.&lt;ref&gt;[FR] - J. Macdonald, D. Stefanovic et M. Stojanovic, ''Des assemblages d'ADN rompus au jeu et au travail'', [[:fr:Pour la Science|Pour la Science]], {{n°|375}}, January 2009, {{p.|68-75}}&lt;/ref&gt; The calculator consists of nine bins corresponding to the nine squares of the game. Each bin contains a substrate and various combinations of DNA enzymes. The substrate itself is composed of a DNA strand onto which was grafted a fluorescent chemical group at one end, and the other end, a repressor group. Fluorescence is only active if the molecules of the substrate are halved. The DNA enzyme simulate [[Logic function|logical functions]]. For example, such a DNA will unfold if two specific types of DNA strand are introduced to reproduce the logic function AND.

By default, the computer is supposed to play first in the central square. The human player has then as a starter eight different types of DNA strands assigned to each of eight boxes that may be played. To indicate that box nr. i is being ticked, the human player pours into all bins the strands corresponding to input #i. These strands bind to certain DNA enzymes present in the bins, resulting in one of these two bins in the deformation of the DNA enzymes which binds to the substrate and cuts it. The corresponding bin becomes fluorescent, indicating which box is being played by the DNA computer. The various DNA enzymes are divided into various bins in such a way to ensure the victory of the DNA computer against the human player.

=== Neural network based computing ===
Kevin Cherry and Lulu Qian at Caltech developed a DNA-based artificial neural network that can recognize 100-bit hand-written digits. They achieve this by programming on computer in advance with appropriate set of weights represented by varying concentrations weight molecules which will later be added to the test tube that holds the input DNA strands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Qian|first=Lulu|last2=Winfree|first2=Erik|last3=Bruck|first3=Jehoshua|date=July 2011|title=Neural network computation with DNA strand displacement cascades|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nature10262|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=475|issue=7356|pages=368–372|doi=10.1038/nature10262|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cherry|first=Kevin M.|last2=Qian|first2=Lulu|date=2018-07-04|title=Scaling up molecular pattern recognition with DNA-based winner-take-all neural networks|url=https://nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0289-6|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=559|issue=7714|doi=10.1038/s41586-018-0289-6|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Capabilities ==

DNA computing is a form of [[parallel computing]] in that it takes advantage of the many different molecules of DNA to try many different possibilities at once.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; For certain specialized problems, DNA computers are faster and smaller than any other computer built so far. Furthermore, particular mathematical computations have been demonstrated to work on a DNA computer.  As an example, [[DNA]] molecules have been utilized to tackle the [[assignment problem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = DNA-based computing of strategic assignment problems | journal = Physical Review Letters | date = 2011 | first1 = Jian-Jun | last1 = Shu | first2 = Q.-W. | last2 = Wang | first3 = K.-Y. | last3 = Yong | volume = 106 | issue = 18 | pages = 188702 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.106.188702 | pmid=21635133| bibcode = 2011PhRvL.106r8702S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

DNA computing does not provide any new capabilities from the standpoint of [[Computability theory (computer science)|computability theory]], the study of which problems are computationally solvable using different models of computation.
For example,
if the space required for the solution of a problem grows exponentially with the size of the problem ([[EXPSPACE]] problems) on [[von Neumann architecture|von Neumann machines]], it still grows exponentially with the size of the problem on DNA machines.
For very large EXPSPACE problems, the amount of DNA required is too large to be practical.

==Methods==
There are multiple methods for building a computing device based on DNA, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Most of these build the basic logic gates ([[Logical AND|AND]], [[Logical OR|OR]], [[Logical NOT|NOT]]) associated with [[digital logic]] from a DNA basis. Some of the different bases include DNAzymes, [[oligonucleotide|deoxyoligonucleotides]], enzymes, toehold exchange.

===DNAzymes===
Catalytic DNA ([[deoxyribozyme]] or DNAzyme) catalyze a reaction when interacting with the appropriate input, such as a matching [[oligonucleotide]]. These DNAzymes are used to build logic gates analogous to digital logic in silicon; however, DNAzymes are limited to 1-, 2-, and 3-input gates with no current implementation for evaluating statements in series.

The DNAzyme logic gate changes its structure when it binds to a matching oligonucleotide and the fluorogenic substrate it is bonded to is cleaved free. While other materials can be used, most models use a fluorescence-based substrate because it is very easy to detect, even at the single molecule limit.&lt;ref name="weiss"&gt;

Also available here: http://www.lps.ens.fr/~vincent/smb/PDF/weiss-1.pdf
&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of fluorescence can then be measured to tell whether or not a reaction took place. The DNAzyme that changes is then “used,” and cannot initiate any more reactions. Because of this, these reactions take place in a device such as a continuous stirred-tank reactor, where old product is removed and new molecules added.

Two commonly used DNAzymes are named E6 and 8-17. These are popular because they allow cleaving of a substrate in any arbitrary location.&lt;ref&gt;

A design called a ''stem loop'', consisting of a single strand of DNA which has a loop at an end, are a dynamic structure that opens and closes when a piece of DNA bonds to the loop part. This effect has been exploited to create several [[logic gate]]s. These logic gates have been used to create the computers MAYA I and [[MAYA II]] which can play [[tic-tac-toe]] to some extent.&lt;!--

&lt;/ref&gt; On negative diagnosis it was decided to release a suppressor of the positive diagnosis drug instead of doing nothing. A limitation of this implementation is that two separate automata are required, one to administer each drug. The entire process of evaluation until drug release took around an hour to complete. This method also requires transition molecules as well as the FokI enzyme to be present. The requirement for the FokI enzyme limits application ''in vivo'', at least for use in "cells of higher organisms".&lt;ref name="kahan08"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; It should also be pointed out that the 'software' molecules can be reused in this case.

=== Toehold exchange ===
DNA computers have also been constructed using the concept of toehold exchange. In this system, an input DNA strand binds to a [[sticky end]], or toehold, on another DNA molecule, which allows it to displace another strand segment from the molecule. This allows the creation of modular logic components such as AND, OR, and NOT gates and signal amplifiers, which can be linked into arbitrarily large computers. This class of DNA computers does not require enzymes or any chemical capability of the DNA.&lt;!--

DNA nanotechnology has been applied to the related field of DNA computing. DNA tiles can be designed to contain multiple sticky ends with sequences chosen so that they act as [[Wang tile]]s. A DX array has been demonstrated whose assembly encodes an [[Exclusive or|XOR]] operation; this allows the DNA array to implement a [[cellular automaton]] which generates a [[fractal]] called the [[Sierpinski gasket]]. This shows that computation can be incorporated into the assembly of DNA arrays, increasing its scope beyond simple periodic arrays.&lt;!--

==Galactic spiral arms==

[[File:spiral galaxy arms diagram.svg|thumb|240px|right|Explanation of spiral galaxy arms.]]
[[File:Spiral arms.ogv|thumb|right|240px|Simulation of a Galaxy with a simple spiral arm pattern. Although the spiral arms do not rotate, the galaxy does. If you watch closely you will see stars moving in and out of the spiral arms as time progresses.]]

Originally, astronomers had the idea that the arms of a spiral galaxy were material.  However, if this were the case, then the arms would become more and more tightly wound, since the matter nearer to the center of the galaxy rotates faster than the matter at the edge of the galaxy.  The arms would become indistinguishable from the rest of the galaxy after only a few orbits.  This is called the '''winding problem'''.&lt;ref name="Carroll2007" /&gt;

Lin and Shu proposed in 1964 that the arms were not material in nature, but instead made up of areas of greater density, similar to a [[traffic jam]] on a highway.&lt;ref name="LinShu1964"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lin | first1 = C.C. | last2 = Shu | first2 = F.H. | date = 1964 | title = On the spiral structure of disk galaxies | url = | journal = [[Astrophysical Journal]] | volume = 140 | issue = | pages = 646–655 | doi = 10.1086/147955 | bibcode=1964ApJ...140..646L}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The cars move through the traffic jam: the density of cars increases in the middle of it.  The traffic jam itself, however, does not move (or not a great deal, in comparison to the cars).  In the galaxy, stars, gas, dust, and other components move through the density waves, are compressed, and then move out of them.

More specifically, the density wave theory argues that the "gravitational attraction between stars at different radii" prevents the so-called winding problem, and actually maintains the spiral pattern.&lt;ref name="Phillipps, Steven 2005 132–3"&gt;{{cite book | author = Phillipps, Steven | title=The Structure &amp; Evolution of Galaxies | publisher=Wiley | date=2005 | pages=132–3 | isbn = 0-470-85506-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rotation speed of the arms is defined to be &lt;math&gt;\Omega_{gp}&lt;/math&gt;, the '''global pattern speed'''.  (Thus, within a certain [[non-inertial reference frame]], which is rotating at &lt;math&gt;\Omega_{gp}&lt;/math&gt;, the spiral arms appear to be at rest).  The stars ''within'' the arms are not necessarily stationary, though at a certain distance from the center, &lt;math&gt;R_{c}&lt;/math&gt;, the '''corotation radius''', the stars and the density waves move together.  Inside that radius, stars move more quickly (&lt;math&gt;\Omega &gt; \Omega_{gp}&lt;/math&gt;) than the spiral arms, and outside, stars move more slowly (&lt;math&gt;\Omega &lt; \Omega_{gp}&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;ref name="Carroll2007" /&gt;  For an ''m''-armed spiral, a star at radius ''R'' from the center will move through the structure with a frequency &lt;math&gt;m(\Omega_{gp} - \Omega (R))&lt;/math&gt;.  So, the gravitational attraction between stars can only maintain the spiral structure if the frequency at which a star passes through the arms is less than the '''[[epicyclic frequency]]''', &lt;math&gt;\kappa (R)&lt;/math&gt;, of the star.  This means that a long-lived spiral structure will only exist between the '''inner''' and '''outer [[Lindblad resonance]]''' (ILR, OLR, respectively), which are defined as the radii such that: &lt;math&gt;\Omega (R)=\Omega_{gp} + \kappa /m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Omega (R)=\Omega_{gp} - \kappa /m&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.  Past the OLR and within the ILR,  the extra density in the spiral arms pulls more often than the epicyclic rate of the stars, and the stars are thus unable to react and move in such a way as to "reinforce the spiral density enhancement".&lt;ref name="Phillipps, Steven 2005 132–3"/&gt;

&lt;gallery perrow="3" widths="200" heights="200"&gt;
File:Galaxy rotation rigid.ogv|'''Animation 1:''' If the spiral arms were rigid mass concentrations, the galaxy must rotate as a whole around its center in order to maintain its spiral structure. According to Lindblads observation and the laws of physics this is not the case.
File:Galaxy rotation wind.ogv|'''Animation 2:''' Differential rotation as observed by Lindblad would dissolve spiral arms in a short period of time were they composed of fixed mass concentrations. 
File:Galaxy rotation wave.ogv|'''Animation 3:''' Orbits predicted by the density wave theory allow the existence of stable spiral arms. Stars move in and out of the spiral arms as they orbit the galaxy. 
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Further implications==

[[File:PIA08824 A ring spiral density waves.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Spiral density waves in Saturn's [[Rings of Saturn#A Ring|A Ring]] induced by [[orbital resonance|resonances]] with nearby [[Moons of Saturn|moons]].]]
The Density Wave Theory also explains a number of other observations that have been made about spiral galaxies.  For example, "the ordering of [[H I region|H I clouds]] and '''dust bands''' on the inner edges of spiral arms, the existence of young, massive stars and [[H II region]]s throughout the arms, and an abundance of old, red stars in the remainder of the disk".&lt;ref name="Carroll2007" /&gt;

Basically, when clouds of gas and [[Cosmic dust|dust]] enter into a density wave and are compressed the rate of star formation increases as some clouds meet the [[Jeans instability|Jeans criterion]], and collapse to form new stars.  Since star formation does not happen immediately, the stars are slightly behind the density waves.  The hot [[OB star]]s that are created ionize the gas of the [[interstellar medium]], and form H II regions.  These stars have relatively short lifetimes, however, and expire before fully leaving the density wave.  The smaller, redder stars do leave the wave, and become distributed throughout the galactic disk.

==Application to Saturn's rings==

In [[telecommunications]], '''destination routing''' is a sequential pathway that messages must pass through to reach a target destination. In [[electronic switching system]]s for circuit based telephone calls, the destination stations are identified by a station address or more commonly, a destination [[telephone number]]. 

In the network there are various classes of switching systems. An end office switch connects directly to the stations.  It knows which circuit to activate (ring) when given a destination number. Other switches in the [[Telecommunications network|network]] are for transport only.  These are sometimes called [[Class 4 telephone switch|tandem switches]].  In this case, the goal of destination routing would be to select an outbound span for a particular destination number. The objective is to get a continuous signal path from the starting location of the caller to the ending location of the called party.

'''Education 2030 Agenda''' refers to the global commitment of the [[Education For All|Education for All]] movement to ensure access to basic education for all.  It is an essential part of the [[Sustainable Development Goals|2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development]]. The roadmap to achieve the Agenda is the Education 2030 [[Incheon declaration|Incheon Declaration]] and Framework for Action, which outlines how countries, working with [[UNESCO]] and global partners, can translate commitments into action.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002472/247234e.pdf|title=Education Transforms Lives|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=6, 8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Education 2030 Agenda stretches from early childhood learning to youth and adult education and training; Emphasizes the acquisition of skills for work; Underlines the importance of citizenship education; Focuses on inclusion, equity and gender equality; And aims to ensure quality learning outcomes for all, throughout their lives.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

While the main responsibility for implementing the agenda lies with governments, UNESCO and partners provide support through coordinated policy advice, technical assistance, capacity development and monitoring of progress at global, regional and national levels.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Ten targets to achieve the Education 2030 Agenda ==
The 10 targets of [[Sustainable Development Goals|Sustainable Development Goal]] 4 encompass many different aspects of education. Seven targets are of expected outcomes and three are means of achieving these targets.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Corporate information==

===Name===
[[Image:Eldon Headquarters.jpg|thumb|240 px|right|The [[Industrial park]], home of Eldon – Madrid, Spain]]

Eldon literally means “devices for electricity” in Swedish,[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/el#Swedish][https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/don#Swedish] a representative name for a company manufacturing enclosures designed to protect highly sensitive electrical and electronic components.

===History===

Founded in 1922 in Nässjö, Sweden, the original company, was called Elekto Ljus &amp; Kraft, name that was changed to AB Eldon-Verken in 1948.  
 
Initially building electrical installation equipment and selling radios, the latest invention at the time, they soon began manufacturing a [[junction box]] designed for the use with electric ovens.  
  
In 1963 the first acquisition was made with the take-over of their biggest competitor, Elektriska Osterman AB.  Four years later the Eldon-Osterman companies have merged under the common name of Eldon AB.
 
In 1967 the company expanded abroad, by opening sales offices in several European Countries, starting with the [[UK]] and Belgium.
 
The Dutch subsidiary was inaugurated in 1970 in the north of the Netherlands, in [[Drachten]].
 
In 1999 Eldon AB was sold to [[EQT Partners]] and in 2006 the new management team acquired the majority shareholding from EQT.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24835">'''Eraclie Sterian''' (also known as '''Eracle''' or '''Eracli Sterian'''; November 23, 1872 – 1948) was a [[Romania]]n physician, writer, and political activist, known for introducing [[sexology]] and sex education in his country. Trained as a pathologist, he established his reputation as a popularizer of conventional and [[alternative medicine]] (primarily [[hydrotherapy]]), putting out the influential magazine ''Medicul Poporului''. His early work also dealt with [[life extension]] practices and warnings about the effects of pollution. Sterian was additionally a publisher of textbooks and literary works, and author of dramas—including the [[Natalism|pro-natalist]] propaganda play, ''Tout pour l'enfant'', performed at the [[Théâtre Antoine-Simone Berriau|Théâtre Antoine]] in 1913.

As a doctor and a social critic, Sterian held unconventional views on [[eugenics]], [[human evolution]], and the social role of sexual experiences. These caused a lasting scandal for their challenging of ancestral taboos—although, overall, Sterian remained a conservative and an avowed Christian, who claimed to have found a cure for compulsive masturbation. His [[sex manual]]s, aimed at a young audience, enjoyed success nationwide, and went through several editions in the 1910s.

A Colonel in the [[Romanian Land Forces]], Sterian was also an expert of [[typhus]], having taken part in the World War I campaign against epidemics. In old age, Sterian focused on defending his status as a property owner in [[Bucharest]], founding an Association of Mortgaged Owners and Debtors, and then joining the nation-wide [[League Against Usury]]. He was survived by his son, the writer-politician [[Paul Sterian]], and by his daughter in law, painter [[Margareta Sterian]].

==Biography==

===Early activities===
Born in the port city of [[Galați]], Eraclie Sterian was the son of Dimitrie and Maria. Both parents were natives of [[Craiova]], and had participated in the [[Romanian War of Independence]]: Dimitrie as an officer in combat, Maria as a field nurse.&lt;ref name="vdpaul"&gt;{{ro icon}} Victor Durnea, [http://www.romlit.ro/cazul_paul_sterian_-_ortodox_i_futurist "Cazul Paul Sterian - Ortodox și futurist"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 29/2007&lt;/ref&gt; His maternal uncle may have been the pioneering microbiologist [[Constantin Levaditi]]; on his paternal side, Eraclie was the nephew of actors [[Aristide Demetriade]] and [[Aristizza Romanescu]],&lt;ref name="vdpaul"/&gt; and of poet [[Mircea Demetriade]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Rodica Zafiu]], "Demetriade Mircea", in Aurel Sasu (ed.), ''Dicționarul biografic al literaturii române'', Vol. I, p. 471. Pitești: [[Editura Paralela 45]], 2004.  {{ISBN|973-697-758-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sterians were widely thought of as [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish]], and, more specifically, Eraclie was rumored to have been baptized a Christian from Judaism.&lt;ref name="vbcapșa"&gt;[[Vlaicu Bârna]], ''Între Capșa și Corso'' (e-book version). Chapter: "Despre judecățile istoriei". Iași: [[Polirom]], 2014.  {{ISBN|978-973-46-4566-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family rejected such claims.&lt;ref name="vdpaul"/&gt;

Eraclie left Galați as a child and moved with his family to Craiova, where he would later graduate from [[Carol I National College]],&lt;ref name="vdpaul"/&gt; in the same class as mathematician [[Gheorghe Țițeica]].&lt;ref&gt;V. Mihăilescu, "O amintire despre Gheorghe Țițeica", in ''Arhivele Olteniei'', Nr. 69–70, September–December 1933, pp. 432–433&lt;/ref&gt; From 1891 to 1897, he took courses at the [[University of Bucharest]] medical school,&lt;ref name="vdpaul"/&gt; and then was an [[Internship (medicine)|intern]] at [[Brâncovenesc Hospital]].&lt;ref name="angh379"&gt;Angheluță, p. 379&lt;/ref&gt; As a member of the Medical Students' Society from 1892, he gave lectures on the treatment of [[gonorrhea]] and the state of [[physician–patient privilege]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Victor Gomoiu]], ''Istoricul Societăței Studenților în Medicină, 1875–1906. Partea 1'', pp. 138–139, 184, 323. Bucharest: Tipografia Ziarului ''Cronica'' Thoma Basilescu, 1906&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1897, he became a [[Doctor of Medicine]] with a thesis on [[aspergillosis]], following up with papers on [[malaria]] (1899) and [[tuberculosis]] transmission (1902); he also edited for print I. T. Thomescu's courses on pathology and internal medicine,&lt;ref name="angh379–80"&gt;Angheluță, pp. 379–380&lt;/ref&gt; and lectured at the [[Romanian Atheneum]] on the prevention of [[gout]].&lt;ref&gt;"Noutăți. Dela Ateneu", in ''Tribuna Poporului'', December 6/19, 1903, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Settling in Bucharest, where he briefly put out the magazine ''Spitalul'' ("The Hospital"),&lt;ref name="angh379"/&gt; Sterian married Alexandrina Gulimănescu, daughter of a florist from [[Pitești]]. Together, they had four children, including sons Paul (born 1904) and Constantin.&lt;ref name="vdpaul"/&gt; Their home by 1912 was on Bibescu-Vodă Street, 22.&lt;ref name="botez"&gt;Elvira Botez, "Aniversări astronomice centenare", in ''Studii și Comunicări'', Vol. II, 2009, pp. 372, 375&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dinor"&gt;"Din originalitățile d-luĭ dr. Eraclie Sterian. Un apel către centenarii romîni de pretutindeni", in ''[[Adevărul]]'', December 30, 1912, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

In parallel to his work in conventional medicine, Sterian was becoming a follower of [[Sebastian Kneipp]]'s [[Water cure (therapy)|water cures]]. He published his own introduction on the subject, including a biography of Kneipp, in 1904.&lt;ref name="angh380"&gt;Angheluță, p. 380&lt;/ref&gt; In 1903, he relaunched his work in medical journalism with a review called ''Tribuna Sănătăței'' ("Health Tribune"),&lt;ref&gt;D-na D-r ⁂, "Poșta medicului", in ''Moda Nouă Ilustrată'', Nr. 12/1904, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; and then involved himself in public debates over the medical implications of wearing [[corset]]s. By late 1904, he was arguing, against [[Dimitrie Gerota]], that corsets were not harmful in themselves.&lt;ref&gt;"Treanca-fleanca. Chestia corsetului. Balul lăutarilor din Brăila", in ''[[Furnica (magazine)|Furnica]]'', Nr. 20/1905, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; From November 1, 1905, to May 7, 1911,&lt;ref&gt;Baiculescu ''et al.'', pp. 398–399&lt;/ref&gt; Sterian put out a weekly magazine, first as ''Medicina Populară'' ("Popular Medicine"), then as ''Medicul Poporului'' ("People's Physician"). He began writing occasional articles for ''[[Familia (magazine)|Familia]]'', including a 1906 piece on [[life extension]], advertising [[iodine]]-based cures.&lt;ref&gt;Eraclie Sterian, "Prelungirea vieții", in ''[[Familia (magazine)|Familia]]'', Nr. 21/1906, p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; His other opinion pieces were published under pseudonyms: Ester (in [[Alexandru Macedonski]]'s ''Liga Conservatoare''), Est, and Ilcare.&lt;ref&gt;Straje, pp. 256, 343, 676&lt;/ref&gt;

Sterian's popularization of health subjects earned him a following among the youth and working-class readers. This is attested by writer [[Panait Istrati]], who grew up reading ''Medicina Populară''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henric Sanielevici]], ''Clasicismul proletariatului: Panait Istrati'', p. 62. Bucharest: [[Adevărul|Editura Adevĕrul]], 1924.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, Sterian published his best-seller, ''Educația sexelor'' ("Sex Education"). It had another edition published that same year, and three more, including a French translation, before 1915.&lt;ref name="angh379–80"/&gt; It was complimented by a [[sex manual]], ''În noaptea nunții'' ("On Your Wedding Night"), published in two editions in 1909.&lt;ref name="angh380"/&gt; Popular with the regular public, such works were found unpalatable by Christian critics, who objected in particular to Sterian's claim that sexual refinement was one of "the holy ancestral values".&lt;ref&gt;Dumitru Neda, "Sfântul în redingotă. Ven. Contardo Ferrini, prof. univ. † 1902", in ''Blajul'', September 1934, p. 384&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Romanian Church United with Rome, Greek-Catholic|Greek-Catholic]] intellectual Teofil A. Bălibanu, who read ''Educația sexelor'' in high school, called it "a diabolic work", alleging that "tens of thousands of young men and women" had been driven astray by Sterian.&lt;ref&gt;Ioan Vultur, Teofil A. Bălibanu, "Presa rea. Romane senzaționale, reviste și ziare, cărți de educație sexuale {{sic}}", in ''Flori de Crin. Revistă Femenină'', Nr. 6/1934, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Doctor Ștefan Irimescu dismissed Sterian as a profiteer, noting that the sexology books, rich in "tiny disgusting details", "excite the morbid curiosity of his various readers".&lt;ref name="știchestie"&gt;Ștefan Irimescu, "În chestie personală", in ''[[Viața Romînească]]'', Nr. 1/1911, pp. 100–102&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the books took a conservative view on issues such as masturbation. Sterian believed that recluse male youth were driven into compulsive self-stimulation by "lack of exercise, lack of fresh air, [and by] reading sensual stories and novels", as well as by [[oxalic acid]] as found in chocolate.&lt;ref name="ddportr"&gt;{{ro icon}} Diana Deleanu, [http://adevarul.ro/locale/galati/portretul-medical-onanistului-urma-secol-mai-cearcane-vinete-jurul-ochilor-pupila-e-mai-dilatata-1_56489fc87d919ed50e3fd75b/index.html "Portretul medical al onanistului în urmă cu un secol: 'Mai toți au cearcăne vinete în jurul ochilor, pupila e mai dilatată'"], in ''[[Adevărul]]'' (Galați edition), November 17, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Sterian thought that chronic male masturbators could be recognized by their "pervasive scent of sperm",&lt;ref&gt;[[Uta Ranke-Heinemann]], ''Eunucos por el reino de los cielos. Iglesia católica y sexualidad'', p. 291. Madrid: Editorial Trotta, 1994.  {{ISBN|84-87699-86-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also by mannerisms, such as laughing for no apparent reason.&lt;ref name="ddportr"/&gt; He also claimed to have cured thousands of "[[Ephebos|ephebes]]" with iodine syrup and injections of [[cacodylic acid]]. He used similar treatments for impotence, where he also recommended [[electroconvulsive therapy]].&lt;ref name="ddportr"/&gt;

===Eugenics and natalism===
His range of interests extended over those years. His topical brochures dealt with life extension treatments, as well as with [[balneotherapy]] (at [[Băile Govora]] and on the [[Romanian Black Sea resorts|Black Sea Littoral]]).&lt;ref name="angh379"/&gt; His proposal that baths could cure tuberculosis was detailed in another 1908 pamphlet, ''Omul oceanic'' ("The Oceanic Man").&lt;ref name="angh380"/&gt; Also that year, he attended a congress of [[thalassotherapy]] in [[Opatija]].&lt;ref&gt;Aleš Fischinger, Duša Fischinger, Janez Fischinger, Ante Škrobonja, "100th Anniversary of the Fourth International Congress of Thalassotherapy in Opatija", in ''Acta Medico-Historica Adriatica'', Vol. 6, Issue 2, 2008, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; First stated in 1909, his claim that he could cure tuberculosis with physiotherapy was met with indignation by the medical establishment. Irimescu, as head physician of [[Filaret Hospital]], called him "illiterate", and suggested that ''Medicul Poporului'' was "intoxicating the public" with "repugnant" information.&lt;ref name="știchestie"/&gt; In a March 1910 article for ''Medicul Poporului'', Sterian challenged [[Eugenics in the United States|American eugenicists]] and their policy of [[compulsory sterilization]], as well as orthodox [[degeneration theory]]. In his view, sterilization could provide some form of [[racial hygiene]], but could do nothing to curb crime, mental disease, or alcoholism.&lt;ref&gt;Marius Turda, Aaron Gillette, ''Latin Eugenics in Comparative Perspective'', pp. 104, 287. [[Bloomsbury Publishing]], London &amp; New York City, 2014.  {{ISBN|978-1-4725-3140-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His first involvement in political life, as a [[Romanian nationalism|Romanian nationalist]], came late in 1908, and was occasioned by the [[Bosnian crisis]]. Speaking to a nationalist crowd at Dacia Hall, he protested against [[Austria-Hungary]] and the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]], and even called for the re-annexation of [[Bukovina]] by the [[Kingdom of Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;"Intrunirea naționalistă din sala Dacia. Cuvântările oratorilor", in ''Tribuna'', October 16/29, 1908, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; A while after, as concerned members of the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]], Sterian and his uncle Mircea Demetriade joined the movement supporting [[Gherasim Safirin]], the [[Archdiocese of Roman and Bacău|Bishop of Roman]], in his conflict with the secularizing [[Romanian Synod]]. At the time, Sterian publicly referred to the Synod as manipulated by "atheists" and "gave sinners".&lt;ref&gt;C. Cernăianu, ''Biserica din Regat, 1908—1918 (Semnele timpului în Biserica noastră. Publicație specială pentru cazuri extraordinare)'', pp. 173–174. Bucharest: Apollo, 1920&lt;/ref&gt; His wife Alexandrina soon became a major patron of Saint Catherine Church, Bucharest.&lt;ref&gt;C. Bobulescu, ''Cronica Bisericii Sf. Ecaterine din București, 1577—1 octomvri 1924'', pp. 72–73. Bucharest: [[Convorbiri Literare]], 1927&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the [[Romanian general election, 1912|elections of 1912]], Sterian was also a public speaker at rallies organized by the [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880–1918)|Conservative Party]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Constantin Bacalbașa]], ''Bucureștii de altă dată'', Vol. IV, pp. 41–42. Bucharest: [[Universul]], 1936&lt;/ref&gt; To May 15, 1912, he served in the Conservative administration as [[Comptroller]] at the [[Ministry of Small and Medium Enterprises, Commerce and Business Environment (Romania)|Ministry of Commerce]].&lt;ref&gt;"Parte oficială. Ministerul Industriei și Comerțului", in ''[[Monitorul Oficial]]'', Nr. 37, June 1, 1912, p. 1794&lt;/ref&gt; He was co-opted as a medical expert by the [[Romanian Army]] bulletin, ''Buletinul Armatei și Marinei'', and also wrote for the nationally circulated weekly ''Săptămâna Politică și Culturală''.&lt;ref&gt;Baiculescu ''et al.'', pp. 72, 608&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1912, he joined [[Victor Anestin]]'s Astronomical Society.&lt;ref name="botez"/&gt;

In 1913, Sterian edited for print the poem "Ali's Dream", by his uncle Demetriade.&lt;ref&gt;Tamara Teodorescu, Rodica Fochi, Florența Sădeanu, Liana Miclescu, Lucreția Angheluță, ''Bibliografia românească modernă (1831–1918). Vol. II: D–K'', p. 60. [[Editura științifică și enciclopedică]], Bucharest, 1986.  {{OCLC|462172635}}&lt;/ref&gt; His own [[tragicomedy]], ''Tout pour l'enfant'' ("All for the Child"), was staged in Paris by [[Théâtre Antoine-Simone Berriau|Théâtre Antoine]]. Starring [[Ève Francis]] and [[Allain Dhurtal]],&lt;ref name="emery"&gt;Emery, "Les Répétitions génerales. Au Théâtre Antoine. ''Tout pour l'Enfant'', pièce en trois actes, du Dr. Eraclie Sterian", in ''Comoedia'', June 29, 1913, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rdftout"&gt;[[Robert de Flers]], "Les Théatres. Théatre Antoine: ''Tout pour l'enfant'', pièce en trois actes, du docteur Eraclie Stérian", in ''[[Le Figaro]]'', July 1, 1913, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; it registered significant success during the summer 1913 season.&lt;ref&gt;"Courrier des spectacles", in ''[[Le Gaulois]]'', July 3, 1913, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; If followed the tribulations of a sterile lady, Jeanne Montrose, who encourages her husband to force himself on the much younger Fernande. The conflict over the resulting child is miraculously resolved when Jeanne agrees to let Fernande replace her as Mrs. Montrose.&lt;ref name="rdftout"/&gt; Emery, the staff critic at ''Comoedia'', gave the play a poor review, calling it a "loony bin".&lt;ref name="emery"/&gt; [[Robert de Flers]] wrote in ''[[Le Figaro]]'': "Dr. Eraclie Stérian—apparently well-known in Romania for his scientific works—has set for himself no less a goal than to provide France with a new means to combat depopulation [...]. But heavens, how could Mr. Stérian imagine that in order to produce children for the French—something not at all easy to do—he should first set himself to produce a play—that which is even more difficult? [...] Mr. Eraclie Stérian has an exceedingly large conception of the family, but he also has only a faint notion of what dramatic art is."&lt;ref name="rdftout"/&gt;

With the 1913 book ''Cum putem mări cantitatea de vieață și Paradoxele longevității'' ("How Me May Enhance Life Quantitatively, and The Paradoxes of Longevity"), Sterian produced a more radical critique of degeneration theory, proposing a new take on [[human evolution]]. He hypothesized that modern man was an ape species that had suffered adaptation to [[syphilis]], which, in his reading, meant increased intelligence. Although he believed that syphilitic infection was a "civilizing hero", Sterian noted that the modern form of the epidemic needed to be kept in check.&lt;ref&gt;Titus Malaiu, "Un capitol din domeniul evoluției darviniste. Omul 'copil degenerat' al maimuței sifilizate?", in ''Cultura Creștină'', Nr. 11/1916, pp. 341–345&lt;/ref&gt; The book mainly insisted on solutions for the increase of man's lifespan. During the research phase, Sterian offered free consultations to all of Bucharest's centenarians.&lt;ref name="dinor"/&gt; His overall conclusion was that, through control of one's effort and cultivation of one's intellect, people could live up to age 124.&lt;ref&gt;Leontin Iliescu, "Ex-libris", in ''[[Universul Literar]]'', Nr. 12/1913, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War I and after===
In summer 1914, shortly before the start of World War I, ''La Presse Médicale'' published his French-language essay on the supposed medical hazards of [[asphalt concrete]]. Sterian argued that, being impossible to sweep clean, asphalt created unhygienic dust, and also warned that asphalt roads had a serious risk of structural collapse.&lt;ref&gt;[[Georges Vitoux]], "Les trous de Paris, le pavage et l'hygiène", in ''[[Le Petit Parisien]]'', July 31, 1914, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; During the following two years, in [[Romania in World War I|still-neutral Romania]], he returned to his literary work, this time published in Romanian. ''Tout pour l'enfant'' was translated as ''Copilul'' ("The Child"), and bound together with Sterian's second comedy, ''O invenție ciudată'' ("A Strange Invention").&lt;ref name="vdpaul"/&gt;&lt;ref name="angh379"/&gt; Following Romania's [[Treaty of Bucharest (1916)|entry into the war]], Sterian joined the medical officers' corps of the [[Second Army (Romania)|Second Army]], becoming a Major on April 1, 1917, and a Lieutenant Colonel exactly four years later.&lt;ref&gt;"Parte oficială. Ministerul de Răsboi", in ''[[Monitorul Oficial]]'', Nr. 119, August 31, 1921, p. 4707&lt;/ref&gt; He earned distinction with his work in combating [[typhus]], contracting the disease himself and publishing his observations in 1918,&lt;ref name="angh379"/&gt; when other articles of his also saw print in [[Constantin Al. Ionescu-Caion|Ionescu-Caion]]'s magazine, ''Cronicarul''.&lt;ref&gt;Straje, p. 676&lt;/ref&gt; The year also marked his son Paul's debut in literature, at age 14.&lt;ref name="vdpaul"/&gt;

Decommissioned and promoted to reserve Colonel on October 1, 1924,&lt;ref&gt;"Parte oficială. Ministerul de Răsboi", in ''[[Monitorul Oficial]]'', Nr. 81, April 10, 1925, pp. 4034–4035&lt;/ref&gt; Sterian returned to his native city in April 1926 to give a lecture on [[social medicine]] and [[social hygiene]]—this enterprise was sponsored by the [[Cultural League for the Unity of All Romanians]].&lt;ref&gt;I. Dimitriu, "Viața din Moldova. Redacție și la Iași", in ''Cultura Poporului'', Nr. 162/1926, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Having built himself a townhouse at his old home on Bibescu-Vodă,&lt;ref&gt;Chiriță Vasilescu, V. Costantinescu, "Sectorul III Albastru. Proces verbal", in ''Monitorul Comunal al Municipiului București'', October 13, 1929, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; he joined a protest movement of the Bucharest property-owners against the tax rates.&lt;ref&gt;"Legea chiriilor. Intrunirea proprietarilor", in ''[[Adevărul]]'', March 1, 1927, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; This was formalized into a Property Owners' Syndicate, founded on December 21, 1925, and presided upon by Constantin Tamara.&lt;ref&gt;"Deciziuni. Tribunalul Ilfov, secția I civilo-corecțională. Extract", in ''[[Monitorul Oficial]]'', Nr. 153, July 11, 1926, p. 10506&lt;/ref&gt;

Sterian also made a brief return to politics following the [[Great Depression]], when he founded the activist Association of Mortgaged Owners and Debtors.&lt;ref name="intrlcc"&gt;"Intrunirea Ligii contra cametei și proprietarilor ipotecați", in ''[[Adevărul]]'', November 4, 1930, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; It was especially active during early 1930, when, together with the larger [[League Against Usury]] (LCC), it preached anti-capitalist rebellion at [[agricultural show]]s. The authorities kept it under watch, viewing it as an outside associate of the outlawed [[Romanian Communist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Dumitrescu, F. Dumitrescu, "Frămîntări sociale în județul Argeș în anii crizei economice (1929—1933)", in ''Studii și Comunicări'', Vol. II, 1969, pp. 265–266, 272–273&lt;/ref&gt; Sterian's Association finally merged into the LCC in November 1930.&lt;ref name="intrlcc"/&gt; Sterian later made returns to medical research, and, in 1936, claimed to have cured [[Pott disease]] using seawater ("marine plasma") injections.&lt;ref&gt;Ygrec, "O importantă ședință a Societății anatomo-clinice din Capitală", in ''[[Adevărul]]'', November 8, 1936, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Over those years, Paul Sterian had surpassed his father's renown, becoming one of the leading poets of the ''[[Gândirea]]'' circle, as well as a noted economist, sociologist, and diplomat. He may have joined the fascist [[Iron Guard]] at some point in the early-to-mid 1930s and was alleged to be hosting shooting practice for its members on one of Eraclie's properties.&lt;ref name="vbcapșa"/&gt; Married to artist [[Margareta Sterian]], Paul was later head of legation in Washington, D. C., then, during World War II, a public servant of the [[Ion Antonescu]] regime. As the regime adopted [[Holocaust in Romania|hard-line antisemitic policies]] (Paul Sterian was tasked with auctioning off confiscated Jewish property),&lt;ref&gt;[[Mihail Sebastian]], ''Journal, 1935–1944'', pp. 520–521. London: [[Random House]], 2003.  {{ISBN|0-7126-8388-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; the family again had to dismiss public rumors according to which they were Jewish.&lt;ref name="vdpaul"/&gt;

At that late stage of his life, Sterian Sr returned to publishing under the pen name Ave Caesar, with ''Încercări de etimologie'' ("Essays in Etymology", 1939–1940).&lt;ref name="vdpaul"/&gt; Under his real name, he presented his findings to the Friends of Literary History in late November 1940.&lt;ref&gt;"Comunicările ținute la soc. 'Prietenii Istoriei Literare' în anii 1940 și 1941", in ''Preocupări Literare'', Nr. 12/1942, p. 642&lt;/ref&gt; According to literary historian Victor Durnea, this contribution was forgettable, "obviously the work of a dilettante, often ridiculous in its claims."&lt;ref name="vdpaul"/&gt; Eraclie Sterian died in 1948, just as Romania was entering a period of [[Communist Romania|communist rule]]. The new regime marginalized, imprisoned, and ultimately [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]] his writer son.&lt;ref name="vdpaul"/&gt;

The '''Donders Centre for Cognitive Neuroimaging''' (formerly F.C. Donders Centre for Cognitive Neuroimaging) is one of the four centers which together comprise the Donders [[research institute|Institute]]. It is located at the campus of the [[Radboud University Nijmegen]] and maintains strong ties with the [[Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics]]. It is named after the Dutch ophthalmologist [[Franciscus Donders]], who was the first scientist to use differences in reaction times to infer differences in cognitive processing.

Research at the centre is focussed around neuroimaging techniques such as [[Magnetoencephalography|MEG]], [[EEG]] and [[fMRI]]. The centre also has an arrangement with Universität Duisburg-Essen to operate a 7T fMRI facility in Essen, at the Kokerei [[Zollverein]], the site of the former [[Zollverein Coal Mine Industrial Complex]]. 

In order to train young talent in the broad field of [[cognitive neuroscience]], the Donders Institute has established the Donders Graduate School for Cognitive Neuroscience, which offers students an educational programme at both the Master's and the PhD level. The school is intended for students in biology, physics, psycholinguistics, behavioral studies and medicine who are strongly motivated to do research in cognitive neuroscience. 

[[FieldTrip]], a [[MATLAB]]-based toolbox for the analysis of [[Magnetoencephalography|MEG]] and [[EEG]] data originates at the Donders Centre for Cognitive Neuroimaging.

[[File:Akademia FSB.jpg|right|200px|FSB Emblem]]
The '''FSB Academy''' (Академия федеральной службы безопасности Российской Федерации, formerly known as The Dzerzhinsky Higher School of the [[KGB]]), is an education and research institution federally chartered to prepare Russian Intelligence personnel for the [[Federal Security Service (Russia)|Federal Security Service]] in particular and for the [[Russian Intelligence Community]] in general.

The academy was formed by [[President of Russia|presidential]] decree in August 24, 1992 on the foundation of the Higher School of the [[KGB]], and is located in Michurinsky Prospekt, [[Moscow]], Russia. It consists of the [[Institute of Cryptography, Telecommunications and Computer Science]] (Институт криптографии, связи и информатики, ИКСИ) and the [[Institute for Operational Training]] (Институт подготовки оперативного состава, ИПОС&lt;ref&gt;Which its training site is located in Balashikha, in [[Moscow Oblast]], and called Balashikha-1.&lt;/ref&gt;) in various facilities. &lt;ref&gt;[http://newsru.com/russia/21jun2008/fsb.html Бортников напутствовал медалистов Академии ФСБ: вы "будете верны традициям, заложенным нашими ветеранами"], ''Bortnikov, to the medalists of FSB Academy: Shall all of you "will be true to the traditions laid down by our veterans"'', NEWSru.com&lt;/ref&gt;

General-Colonel Victor Ostroukhov has been Head of the Academy since 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.academy.fsb.ru/i_rukovodstvo.html The Head of FSB Academy - Viktor Ostroukhov], FSB Academy official website&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Presidium of the [[Cheka|VChK]] (The first security service of the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet Russia]]) decided in January 25, 1921 to establish a special institute for operational training. The first course began April 26, 1921, and the first Head of the course was M. Romanovsky.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsb.ru/fsb/smi/overview/single.htm!id%3D10342507@fsbSmi.html АКАДЕМИЯ ФСБ - TERRA INCOGNITA], FSB.Ru&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1922 the course was renamed the Higher Courses of the [[State Political Directorate]] (GPU).

In May 1930 [[Moscow]] created higher schools for basic and advanced training of secret agents; in June 4, 1930 the school was known as the Central School of OGPU. July 14, 1934, after the formation of the [[NKVD|People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs]], the former OGPU Central School was renamed the Central School of General Directorate for State Security (GUGB) of the NKVD.

On March 21, 1939 the Central School of GUGB NKVD was reorganized as the Graduate School of the NKVD. By the early 1940s, every third head of the Soviet security organs was a graduate of the course.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsb.ru/fsb/smi/overview/single.htm!id%3D10342507@fsbSmi.html АКАДЕМИЯ ФСБ - TERRA INCOGNITA], FSB.Ru&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Great Patriotic War]], the school trained more than seven thousand security officers who organized the fight against the [[Nazis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsb.ru/fsb/smi/overview/single.htm!id%3D10342507@fsbSmi.html АКАДЕМИЯ ФСБ - TERRA INCOGNITA], FSB.Ru&lt;/ref&gt;

Six graduates of the Higher School became [[Hero of the Soviet Union|Heroes of the Soviet Union]]: Dmitry N. Medvedev, V.A. Molodtsov (posthumously), A. M. Rabtsevich, V.A. Lyagin (posthumously), P.A Zhidkov and E.I. Mirkovsky.

On August 30, 1945 the Graduate School of the NKVD was awarded the Red Banner and the Diploma by decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. By resolution of the Council of Ministers of the USSR on July 15, 1952, the Graduate School of the MGB (Ministry for State Security) was established as a special institution of higher education with a three-year apprenticeship program for students of law schools.

By Resolution of the Council of Ministers on August 2, 1962 the [[KGB]] Higher School was named after Dzerzhinsky. During the 1960s to 1980s, graduates took part in countering foreign intelligence services and conducting operational and combat activities.

In 1995 the Higher School of the KGB was renamed the FSB Academy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nomad.su/?a=10-200301250019 Татьянин день, бывший когда-то праздником Московского государственного университета, сегодня с удовольствием отмечают все российские студенты.

'''''Final Straw: Food, Earth, Happiness''''' is a documentary/art film released in June 2015 that takes audiences through farms and urban landscapes in [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], and the [[United States]], interviewing leading practitioners in the [[Natural farming|Natural Farming]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Hong|first=Ryoseok|title=Final Straw: Food, Earth, Happiness|date=2000-01-01|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3709036/|last2=Kawaguchi|last3=Korn|first2=Yoshikazu|first3=Larry|accessdate=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film began when an environmental artist (Patrick M. Lydon) and an environmental book editor (Suhee Kang), had a chance meeting in Seoul, South Korea, and began conducting short interviews together with leaders in the ecology and social justice movements. Upon meeting Korean farmer Seong Hyun Choi however, the two were so impressed by his ecological mindset and way of working, that they set out to produce a feature film about the movement. Lydon and Kang ended up quitting their jobs, giving away most of their possessions, and becoming voluntarily homeless for four years in order to afford producing the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kimchiandbasil.com/interview-final-straw/|title=Final straw: food, earth, happiness - Kimchi&amp;Basil|date=2016-02-20|work=Kimchi&amp;Basil|access-date=2017-04-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/a-root-solution/|title=A ‘Root’ Solution {{!}} Final Straw – Food {{!}} Earth {{!}} Happiness|website=www.finalstraw.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/2016/12/21/lydon-ghost-ship-raises-broad-questions-about-art-and-culture/|title=Lydon: Ghost Ship raises big questions about arts and culture|last=|first=|date=|website=San Jose Mercury News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film is split into three sections 1) Modern Life, 2) Foundations and Mindset of Natural Farming, and 3) Natural Farming in Practice and Life. According to the filmmakers, as they began to understand more about how natural farming itself was not rooted in methods, but in a way of thinking, they chose to explore the life philosophies and ways of thinking of natural farming practitioners in a more free-flowing and artistic way, rather than an instructive one; the result is an unconventional documentary that features slow paced musical interludes alongside interviews. Reviewers have called both "meditative, and mindful," and "an inspiring call to action."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mindfulpie.com/one-straw-revolution/|title=Love nature, eat well – Mindful Pie|website=mindfulpie.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cleaneatingmag.com/|title=Eco Farming|last=|first=|date=July 1, 2015|work=Clean Eating Magazine|access-date=August 1, 2015|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|publisher=Active Interest Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author and musician [[Alicia Bay Laurel]] called the film "both art and documentary".

== Production ==
Lydon and Kang spent what they call a "meager" life savings to make the film, along with the volunteer efforts of farmers, translators, writers, musicians they had met during their journey. Although the film was filmed, written, and edited entirely by the two directors, they readily admit that the process of making the film was co-operative effort, with more than 200 volunteers directly involved in the process in some way. The soundtrack was recorded with professional musicians from each of the three countries where filming took place, all of whom donated their time to contribute to the film project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/film-soundtrack-recording-with-windsync/|title=Film Soundtrack Recording with WindSync {{!}} Final Straw – Food {{!}} Earth {{!}} Happiness|website=www.finalstraw.org|language=en|access-date=2017-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the continued help of international volunteers, the film is available in four languages (English, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese), and three more (Chinese, Portuguese, French) are in progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cbjournalism.com/2016/03/24/filmmaker-spotlight-patrick-lydon-suhee-king/|title=Filmmaker Spotlight: Patrick Lydon &amp; Suhee King|date=2016-03-24|website=Chelsea Breaks the News|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/film-soundtrack-recording-with-windsync/|title=Film Soundtrack Recording with WindSync {{!}} Final Straw – Food {{!}} Earth {{!}} Happiness|website=www.finalstraw.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/the-documentary/|title=The Documentary {{!}} Final Straw – Food {{!}} Earth {{!}} Happiness|website=www.finalstraw.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tour and critical reception ==
[[File:Seoul-youth-hub-mandala-lydon-kang.jpg|alt=Artists and filmmakers, Patrick M.

Lydon and Suhee Kang host a 'mandala' workshop after a screening of their film in Seoul, South Korea.]]
Frustrated by the lack of distribution and film festival options for low- and no-budget films, the filmmakers made the decision to manage distribution and touring in the same way they went about filming, through co-operative effort. With the help of volunteers, independent theater owners, and community organizers, they launched an extensive tour throughout Japan and South Korea from 2015-2016, eventually screening the film at over 130 venues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/tour-dates-and-screenings/|title=Tour Dates and Screenings {{!}} Final Straw – Food {{!}} Earth {{!}} Happiness|website=www.finalstraw.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than simply screening the film, the filmmakers decided to transition their existing media production organization ''SocieCity,'' into a vehicle for art and community engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://artseverywhere.ca/2016/03/07/social-practice-artwork-a-restaurant-and-garden-serving-up-connections-to-urban-nature/|title=Social Practice Artwork: A Restaurant and Garden Serving up Connections to Urban Nature|last=|first=|date=|website=artseverywhere.ca|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; They made a point of hosting interactive events along with their screenings and in several cases, stayed in communities for up to three months at a time to build natural gardens and host a project they call REALtimeFOOD, a grown-to-order restaurant which connects the ideas from the film with real-world practices in farming, food, and crafts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.naver.com/barndining_/220514125842|title=Bar&amp;Dining Magazine : 네이버 블로그|website=blog.naver.com|language=ko|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://setouchiexplorer.com/real-time-food-project-day-one-worlds-slowest-restaurant-opening/|title=REAL time FOOD Project - Day One - World's Slowest Restaurant Opening|date=2016-09-18|work=Setouchi Explorer|access-date=2017-04-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, these efforts were funded by grants from local philanthropic organizations and/or supported by the communities themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chishimatochi.info/found/index.php/archives/service/1961|title=おおさか創造千島財団  » 2015年度|website=www.chishimatochi.info|language=ja|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sustainablepractice.org/2013/11/15/final-straw/|title=Final Straw|date=2013-11-15|website=The CSPA|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interested in the unconventional way the film was being made and toured, multiple magazines and newspapers in Japan and Korea followed the directors during several parts of their journey, notably ESSEN, Bar and Dining, and Road magazines, and Shikoku Shinbun and Huffington Post newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/shikoku-newspaper-english.pdf|title=Connecting to Life with Natural Farming in Megijima|last=|first=|date=September 18, 2016|work=Shikoku Shinbun|access-date=17 April 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.kr/salimstory/story_b_8476176.html|title="모든 것이 연결되어 있다는 깨달음이 시작"|website=허핑턴포스트|language=ko-KR|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://navercast.naver.com/magazine_contents.nhn?rid=1095&amp;contents_id=45426|title=내일의 식문화를 일구는 사람들이 보내 온 새해 편지|access-date=2017-04-18|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the tour, the film was eventually picked up by festivals including Tassie Eco Film Festival and Belleville Doc Fest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://downtowndocfest.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Belleville%20Downtown%20DocFest%20Program_2016.pdf|title=Belleville International Documentary Festival - Official Program|last=|first=|date=1 February 2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6163">In [[software engineering]] and [[systems engineering]], a '''functional requirement''' defines a function of a [[system]] or its component, where a function is described as a specification of behavior between outputs and inputs.&lt;ref name="FultonAirborne17"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZQMvDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA89 |chapter=Chapter 4: Requirements - Writing Requirements |title=Airborne Electronic Hardware Design Assurance: A Practitioner's Guide to RTCA/DO-254 |author=Fulton, R.; Vandermolen, R. |publisher=CRC Press |pages=89–93 |year=2017 |isbn=9781351831420 |accessdate=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Functional requirements may involve calculations, technical details, data manipulation and processing, and other specific functionality that define what a system is supposed to accomplish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.dau.mil/publications/publicationsDocs/SEFGuide%2001-01.pdf |title=Systems Engineering Fundamentals |chapter=Supplement 4-A, A Procedure for Requirements Analysis |publisher=United States Government US Army |year=2001 |ISBN=978-1484120835 |accessdate=18 March 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131231503/http://www.dau.mil/publications/publicationsdocs/sefguide%2001-01.pdf |archivedate=31 January 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Behavioral requirements describing all the cases where the system uses the functional requirements are captured in [[use case]]s. Functional requirements are supported by [[non-functional requirement]]s (also known as "quality requirements"), which impose constraints on the design or implementation (such as performance requirements, security, or reliability). Generally, functional requirements are expressed in the form "system must do &lt;requirement&gt;," while non-functional requirements take the form "system shall be &lt;requirement&gt;."&lt;ref name="LoucopoulosRequire05"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Chapter 4: Requirements Engineering |title=Design Process Improvement: A Review of Current Practice |author=Loucopoulos, P. |editor=Clarkson, J.; Eckert, C. |publisher=Springer-Verlag |pages=116–139 |year=2005 |isbn=9781846280610}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan for implementing functional requirements is detailed in the system design, whereas ''non-functional'' requirements are detailed in the system architecture.&lt;ref name="AdamsNon15"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=3.2 Definitions for Functional and Non-Functional Requirements |title=Non-functional Requirements in Systems Analysis and Design |author=Adams, K.M. |publisher=Springer |pages=45–50 |year=2015 |isbn=9783319183442}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JönssonImpact06"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Chapter 6: Impact Analysis |title=Engineering and Managing Software Requirements |author=Jönsson, P.; Lindvall, M. |editor=Aurum, A.; Wohlin, C. |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |pages=117–42 |year=2006 |isbn=9783540282440}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As defined in [[requirements analysis|requirements engineering]], functional requirements specify particular results of a system. This should be contrasted with non-functional requirements, which specify overall characteristics such as cost and [[Reliability engineering|reliability]]. Functional requirements drive the application architecture of a system, while non-functional requirements drive the technical architecture of a system.&lt;ref name="AdamsNon15" /&gt;
    
In some cases a requirements analyst generates use cases after gathering and validating a set of functional requirements. The hierarchy of functional requirements collection and change, broadly speaking, is: user/[[Project stakeholder|stakeholder]] request → analyze → use case → incorporate. Stakeholders make a request; systems engineers attempt to discuss, observe, and understand the aspects of the requirement; use cases, entity relationship diagrams, and other models are built to validate the requirement; and, if documented and approved, the requirement is implemented/incorporated.&lt;ref name="MITRESys14"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.mitre.org/publications/technical-papers/the-mitre-systems-engineering-guide |chapter=Requirements Engineering: Eliciting, Collecting, and Developing Requirements |title=The MITRE Systems Engineering Guide |author=MITRE Corporate Communications and Public Affairs |publisher=MITRE Corporation |pages=304–13 |isbn=9780615974422 |accessdate=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each use case illustrates behavioral scenarios through one or more functional requirements. Often, though, an analyst will begin by eliciting a set of use cases, from which the analyst can derive the functional requirements that must be implemented to allow a user to perform each use case.

==Process==
A typical functional requirement will contain a unique name and number, a brief summary, and a rationale. This information is used to help the reader understand why the requirement is needed, and to track the requirement through the development of the system.&lt;ref name="StellmanApplied05"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IYdJocLVa8wC&amp;pg=PA97 |chapter=Chapter 6: Software requirements|title=Applied Software Project Management |first1=Andrew |last1=Stellman |first2=Jennifer |last2=Greene |publisher=O'Reilly Media |pages=97–130 |year=2005 |isbn=9780596553821 |accessdate=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crux of the requirement is the description of the required behavior, which must be clear and readable. The described behavior may come from organizational or business rules, or it may be discovered through elicitation sessions with users, stakeholders, and other experts within the organization.&lt;ref name="StellmanApplied05" /&gt; Many requirements may be uncovered during the use case development. When this happens, the requirements analyst may create a placeholder requirement with a name and summary, and research the details later, to be filled in when they are better known.

The '''German Forum for Art History Paris''' ('''Deutsches Forum für Kunstgeschichte''' (DFK; Centre Allemand d'Histoire de l'Art de Paris; German Center for the History of Art, Paris) is a [[Germany|German]] research institute specialized in [[France|French]] and [[Germany|German]] art and currently situated in the Hôtel de Lully in [[Paris]], the former residence of the French composer [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]]. It organizes conferences, symposia, and workshops, undertakes research projects, and has published many books on art.

The DFK was founded in 1997 with German, French, and Swiss colleagues by [[Thomas W. Gaehtgens]]. It is supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research. Until October 2007, the institution was headed by Gaehtgens, from 2009 to 2014 by {{Interlanguage link multi|Andreas Beyer|de}} and since February 2014 by the current director, {{Interlanguage link multi|Thomas Kirchner (Historiker)|de}}. From 2006, the Forum is part of the "Foundation of German Humanities Institutes Abroad", which is now called "Max Weber Foundation of German Humanities Institutes Abroad".

The DFK supports research by [[Germany|German]] scholars on [[France|French]] subjects. It also promotes the research of French scholars on German art and German art history and endeavors to include other [[Europe]]an and [[Americas|transatlantic]] countries and academic disciplines to participate in its research programs.

The DFK cooperates with the [[Institut national d'histoire de l'art]] (INHA) in Paris, the [[Bibliotheca Hertziana – Max Planck Institute for Art History]] in Rome, the [[Kunsthistorisches Institut in Florenz]] and the [[Zentralinstitut für Kunstgeschichte]] in Munich. It is also member of the [[International Association of Research Institutes in the History of Art]] (RIHA).

'''Indicator bacteria''' are types of [[bacteria]] used to detect and estimate the level of fecal contamination of water. They are not dangerous to human health but are used to indicate the presence of a health risk.

Each gram of human [[feces]] contains approximately ~100 billion ({{val|1|e=11}}) bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Beactiviahealth|title=Intestinal Microflora|url=http://www.beactiviahealth.com/html_cap/1_3.html|work=Activia|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425231216/http://www.beactiviahealth.com/html_cap/1_3.html|archivedate=2012-04-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These bacteria may include species of [[pathogenic]] bacteria, such as ''[[Salmonella]]'' or ''[[Campylobacter]]'', associated with [[gastroenteritis]]. In addition, feces may contain pathogenic [[virus]]es, [[protozoa]] and [[parasitism|parasites]]. Fecal material can enter the environment from many sources including [[waste water treatment plants]], livestock or poultry manure, sanitary landfills, [[septic systems]], [[sewage sludge]], pets and wildlife. If sufficient quantities are ingested, fecal pathogens can cause disease. The variety and often low concentrations of pathogens in environmental waters makes them difficult to test for individually. Public agencies therefore use the presence of other more abundant and more easily detected fecal bacteria as indicators of the presence of fecal contamination.

== Criteria for indicator organisms== 
The [[US Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) lists the following criteria for an organism to be an ideal indicator of fecal contamination:{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}
# The organism should be present whenever enteric pathogens are present
# The organism should be useful for all types of water
# The organism should have a longer survival time than the hardiest enteric pathogen
# The organism should not grow in water
# The organism should be found in warm-blooded animals’ intestines.

None of the types of indicator organisms that are currently in use fit all of these criteria perfectly, however, when cost is considered, use of indicators becomes necessary.

== Types of indicator organisms ==
Commonly used indicator bacteria include total coliforms, or a subset of this group, [[fecal coliforms]], which are found in the intestinal tracts of warm blooded animals. Total coliforms were used as fecal indicators by public agencies in the US as early as the 1920s.  These organisms can be identified based on the fact that they all metabolize the sugar lactose, producing both acid and gas as byproducts.  Fecal coliforms are more useful as indicators in recreational waters than total coliforms which include species that are naturally found in plants and soil; however, there are even some species of fecal coliforms that do not have a fecal origin, such as ''Klebsiella pneumoniae''.  Perhaps the biggest drawback to using coliforms as indicators is that they can grow in water under certain conditions.

''[[Escherichia coli]]'' (''E. coli'') and [[enterococci]] are also used as indicators.

==Current methods of detection==

===Membrane filtration and culture on selective media===
[[File:Enterococci colonies.JPG|right|thumb|Enterococci colonies growing on a selective agar after membrane filtration.]]
Indicator bacteria can be [[Bacterial culture|cultured]] on [[Growth medium|media]] which are specifically formulated to allow the growth of the species of interest and inhibit growth of other organisms.  Typically, environmental water samples are filtered through membranes with small pore sizes and then the membrane is placed onto a selective agar.  It is often necessary to vary the volume of water sample filtered in order to prevent too few or too many colonies from forming on a plate. Bacterial colonies can be counted after 24 to 48 hours depending on the type of bacteria. Counts are reported as colony forming units per 100 mL (cfu/100 mL).

===Fast detections using chromogenic substances===
One technique for detecting indicator organisms is the use of chromogenic compounds, which are added to conventional or newly devised media used for isolation of the indicator bacteria. These chromogenic compounds are modified to change color or fluorescence by the addition of either enzymes or specific bacterial metabolites. This enables for easy detection and avoids the need for isolation of pure cultures and confirmatory tests.&lt;ref name="Ashbolt"&gt;Ashbolt, N., Snozzi, G. and M. (2001). Water Quality: Guidelines, Standards and Health. World Health Organization (WHO). Chapter 13: Indicators of Microbial Water Quality. p. 289-316&lt;/ref&gt;

===Application of antibodies===
Immunological methods using [[monoclonal antibodies]] can be used to detect indicator bacteria in water samples. Precultivation in select medium must preface detection to avoid detection of dead cells. [[ELISA]] antibody technology has been developed to allow for readable detection by the naked eye for rapid identification of coliform [[microcolony|microcolonies]]. Other uses of antibodies in detection use magnetic beads coated with antibodies for the concentration and separation of the [[oocysts]] and [[cysts]] as described below for immunomagnetic separationz (IMS) methods.&lt;ref name="Ashbolt"  /&gt;

===IMS/culture and other rapid culture-based methods===
Immunomagnetic separation involves purified antigens biotinylated and bound to streptoavidin-coated paramagnetic particles. The raw sample is mixed with the beads, then a specific magnet is used to hold the target organisms against the vial wall and the non-bound material is poured off. This method can be used to recover specific indicator bacteria.&lt;ref name="Ashbolt"  /&gt;

===Gene sequence-based methods===
Gene sequence-based methods depend on the recognition of exclusive gene sequences particular to specific strains of organisms. [[Polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) and [[fluorescence in situ hybridization]] (FISH) are gene sequence-based methods currently being used to detect specific strains of indicator bacteria.&lt;ref name="Ashbolt"  /&gt;

== Water quality standards for bacteria ==

=== Drinking water standards ===
[[World Health Organization]] Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality state that as an indicator organism ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' provides conclusive evidence of recent fecal [[water pollution|pollution]] and should ''not'' be present in water meant for human consumption. In the U.S., the EPA ''Total Coliform Rule'' states that a water system is out of compliance if more than 5 percent of its monthly water samples contain coliforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location= Washington, DC |title=Drinking Water; National Primary Drinking Water Regulations; Total Coliforms |url=http://water.epa.gov/lawsregs/rulesregs/sdwa/tcr/upload/tcr1989.pdf|date=1989-06-29}} {{Federal Register|54|27544}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recreational standards ===
Early studies showed that individuals who swam in waters with geometric mean coliform densities above 2300/100 mL for three days had higher illness rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stevenson |first=A |title=Studies of Bathing Water Quality and Health |journal=American journal of public health and the nation's health |year=1953 |volume=43 |issue=5 |pages=529–538 |doi=10.2105/ajph.43.5_pt_1.529|pmc=1620266 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, these numbers were converted to fecal coliform concentrations assuming 18 percent of total coliforms were fecal. Consequently, the National Technical Advisory Committee in the US recommended the following standard for recreational waters in 1968: 10 percent of total samples during any 30-day period should not exceed 400 fecal coliforms/100 mL or a log mean of 200/100 mL (based on a minimum of 5 samples taken over not more than a 30-day period).&lt;ref name="water.epa.gov"&gt;{{cite web|author=EPA |title=Ambient Water Quality Criteria for Bacteria - 1986 |year=1986 |url=http://water.epa.gov/scitech/swguidance/standards/upload/2009_04_13_beaches_1986crit.pdf}} Document no. EPA-440/5-84-002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite criticism, EPA recommended this criterion again in 1976, however, the Agency initiated numerous studies in the 1970s and 1980s to overcome the weaknesses of the earlier studies. In 1986, EPA revised its bacteriological ambient water quality criteria recommendations to include ''E. coli'' and enterococci.

Canada’s National Agri-Environmental Standards Initiative’s approach to characterizing risks associated with fecal water pollution bacterial water quality at agricultural sites is to compare these sites with those at reference sites away from human or livestock sources.  This approach generally results in lower levels if ''E. coli'' being used as a standard or “benchmark” based on a study that indicated pathogens were detected in 80% of water samples with less than 100 cfu ''E. coli'' per 100 mL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Edge|first1=TA|first2=A. |last2=El-Shaarawi |first3=V. |last3=Gannon |first4=C. |last4=Jokinen |first5=R. |last5=Kent |first6=I.U.H. |last6=Khan |first7=W. |last7=Koning |first8=D. |last8=Lapen |first9=J. |last9=Miller |first10=N. |last10=Neumann |first11=R. |last11=Phillips |first12=W. |last12=Robertson |first13=H. |last13=Schreier |first14=A. |last14=Scott |first15=I. |last15=Shtepani |first16=E. |last16=Topp |first17=G. |last17=Wilkes |first18=E. |last18=van Bochove|title=Investigation of an esherischi coli Environmental Benchmark for Waterborne Pathogens in Agricultural Watersheds in Canada|journal=Journal of Environmental Quality|year=2011|volume=40|pages=x-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Risk assessment for exposure to pathogens in recreational waters ==
Most cases of bacterial gastroenteritis are caused by food-borne enteric microorganisms, such as ''[[Salmonella]]'' and ''[[Campylobacter]]''; however, it is also important to understand the risk of exposure to pathogens via recreational waters.  This is especially the case in watersheds where human or animal wastes are discharged to streams and downstream waters are used for swimming or other recreational activities. Other important pathogens other than bacteria include viruses such as [[rotavirus]], [[hepatitis A]] and [[hepatitis E]] and protozoa like [[giardia]], [[cryptosporidium]] and ''[[Naegleria fowleri]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Waterborne Pathogens|url=http://waterbornepathogens.susana.org/|publisher=Montana State|accessdate=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the difficulties associated with monitoring pathogens in the environment, risk assessments often rely on the use of indicator bacteria.

=== Epidemiological studies ===
In the 1950s, a series of epidemiological studies were done in the US to determine the relationship between water quality of natural waters and the health of bathers. The results indicated that swimmers were more likely to have gastrointestinal symptoms, eye infections, skin complaints, ear, nose, and throat infections and respiratory illness than non-swimmers and in some cases, higher coliform levels correlated to higher incidence of gastrointestinal illness, although the sample sizes in these studies were small.  Since then, studies have been done to confirm causative relations between swimming and certain health outcomes.  A review of 22 studies in 1998&lt;ref name="Pruss 1998 1–9"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pruss|first=A|title=Review of epidemiological studies on health effects from exposure to recreational water|journal=International Journal of Epidemiology|year=1998|volume=27|issue=1|pages=1–9|doi=10.1093/ije/27.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  confirmed that the health risks for swimmers increased as the number of indicator bacteria increased in recreational waters and that ''E. coli'' and enterococci concentrations correlated best with health outcomes among all the indicators studied.  The relative risk (RR) of illness for swimmers in polluted freshwater versus swimmers in unpolluted water was between 1-2 for the majority of the data sets reviewed.  The same study concluded that bacterial indicators were not well correlated to virus concentrations.&lt;ref name="Pruss 1998 1–9"/&gt;

=== Fate and transport of pathogens ===
Survival of pathogens in waste materials, soil, or water, depends on many environmental factors including temperature, pH, organic matter content, moisture, exposure to light, and the presence of other organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guan|first=Tat Yee|author2=R. A. Holley|title=Pathogen Survival in Swine Manure Environments and Transmission of Human Enteric Illness - A Review|journal=Journal of Environmental Quality|year=2003|volume=32|issue=2|pages=383–392|doi=10.2134/jeq2003.0383}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Fecal material can be directly deposited, washed into waters by overland runoff, transported through the ground, or discharged to surface waters via sewer lines, pipes, or drainage tiles. Risk of exposure to humans requires: (1) pathogens to survive and be present; (2) pathogens to recreate in surface waters; and (3) individuals to come in contact with water for sufficient time, or ingest sufficient volumes of water to receive an infectious dose.  Die-off rates of bacteria in the environment are often exponential, therefore, direct deposition of fecal material into waters generally contribute higher concentrations of pathogens than material that must be transported overland or through the subsurface.

=== Human exposure ===
In general, children, the elderly, and [[immunodeficient|immunocompromised]] individuals require a lower dose of a pathogenic organism in order to contract an infection. Presently there are very few studies which are able to quantify the amount of time people are likely to spend in recreational waters and how much water they are likely to ingest.  In general, children swim more often, stay in the water longer, submerge their heads more often, and swallow more water. This makes people more fearful of water in the sea as more bacteria will be growing on and around them.

=== Quantitative microbiological risk assessment ===
[[Quantitative Microbiological Risk Assessment|Quantitative microbiological risk assessments]] (QMRAs) combine pathogen concentrations in water with dose-response relationships and data reflecting potential exposure to estimate the risk of infection.

Data on water exposure are generally collected using questionnaires, but may also be determined from actual measurements of water ingested, or estimated from previously published data.  Respondents are asked to report the frequency and timing and location of exposures, detailed information about the amount of water swallowed and head submersion, and basic demographic characteristics such as age, gender, socioeconomic status and family composition.  Once sufficient data are collected and determined to be representative of the general population, they are usually fit with distributions, and these distribution parameters are then used in the risk assessment equations.  Monitoring data representing occurrence of pathogens, direct measurement of pathogen concentrations, or estimations deriving pathogen concentrations from indicator bacteria concentrations, are also fit with distributions.  Dose is calculated by multiplying the concentration of pathogens per volume by volume.  Dose-responses can also be fit with a distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schets |first1=Franciska M. |first2=Jack F. |last2=Schijven |first3=Ana Maria |last3=de Roda Husman |title=Exposure assessment for swimmers in bathing waters and swimming pools |journal=Water Research |year=2011 |volume=45 |pages=2392–2400 |doi=10.1016/j.watres.2011.01.025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Risk management and policy implications ===
The more assumptions that are made, the more uncertain estimates of risk related to pathogens will be.  However, even with considerable uncertainty, QMRAs are a good way to compare different risk scenarios.  In a study comparing estimated health risks from exposures to recreational waters impacted by human and non-human sources of fecal contamination, QMRA determined that the risk of gastrointestinal illness from exposure to waters impacted by cattle were similar to those impacted by human waste, and these were higher than for waters impacted by gull, chicken, or pig faeces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Soller |first=Jeffrey A. |author2=Mary E. Schoen |author3=Timothy Bartrand |author4=John E. Ravenscroft |author5=Nicholas J. Ashbolt |title=Estimated human health risks from exposure to recreational waters impacted by human and non-human sources of faecal contamination |journal=Water Research |year=2010 |volume=44 |pages=4674–4691 | doi = 10.1016/j.watres.2010.06.049 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such studies could be useful to risk managers for determining how best to focus their limited resources, however, risk managers must be aware of the limitations of data used in these calculations.  For example, this study used data describing concentrations of ''Salmonella'' in chicken feces published in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kraft |first=D. J. |author2=Carolyn Olechowski-Gerhardt |author3=J. Berkowitz |author4=and M.S. Finstein |title=Salmonella in Wastes Produced at Commercial Poultry Farms |journal=Applied Microbiology |year=1969 |volume=18 |issue=5 |pages=703–707}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Methods for quantifying bacteria, changes in animal housing practices and sanitation, and many other factors may have changed the prevalence of ''Salmonella'' since that time.  Also, such an approach often ignores the complicated fate and transport processes that determine bacteria concentrations from the source to the point of exposure.

== Addressing bacterial water quality problems ==
In the US, individual states are allowed to develop their own water quality standards based on EPA’s recommendations under the [[Clean Water Act]] of 1977.  Once water quality standards are approved, states are tasked with monitoring their surface waters to determine where impairments occur, and watershed plans called [[Total Maximum Daily Load]]s (TMDLs) are developed to direct water quality improvement efforts including changes to allowable bacteria loading by [[point source water pollution|point sources]] and recommendations for changes to practices that reduce [[Nonpoint source|nonpoint-source]] contributions to bacteria loads.  Also, many states have beach monitoring programs to warn swimmers when high levels of indicator bacteria are detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://water.epa.gov/type/oceb/beaches/beaches_index.cfm |title=Beach Monitoring &amp; Notification |author=EPA |website= |accessdate=2014-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''J. Baird Callicott''' (born 1941) is an [[American philosophy|American philosopher]] whose work has been at the forefront of the new field of environmental philosophy and ethics.  He is a University Distinguished Research Professor and a member of the Department of [[Philosophy]] and [[Religious Studies|Religion Studies]] and the Institute of Applied Sciences at the [[University of North Texas]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.phil.unt.edu/people/faculty/bios/vjbc.php Faculty | Philosophy &amp; Religion Studies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101022091248/http://www.phil.unt.edu/people/faculty/bios/vjbc.php |date=2010-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Callicott held the position of Professor of Philosophy and Natural Resources at the [[University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point]] from 1969 to 1995, where he taught the world's first course in [[environmental ethics]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Ouderkirk, Wayne and Jim Hill, eds. (2002) Land, Value, Community: Callicott and Environmental Philosophy.  Albany: State University of New York Press, pp. 344. {{ISBN|0-7914-5229-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1994 to 2000, he served as Vice President then President of the [[International Society for Environmental Ethics]]. Other distinguished positions include visiting professor of philosophy at [[Yale University]]; the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]]; the [[University of Hawai’i]]; and the [[University of Florida]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[http://jbcallicott.weebly.com/my-real-cv.html My real CV - J.

[[Aldo Leopold]]'s ''[[A Sand County Almanac]]'' is one of environmental philosophy's seminal texts, and Callicott is widely considered to be the leading contemporary exponent of Leopold's land ethic.&lt;ref&gt;Ouderkirk and Hill (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Callicott's book ''In Defense of the Land Ethic'' (1989) explores the intellectual foundations of Leopold's outlook and seeks to provide it with a more complete philosophical treatment; and a following publication titled ''Beyond the Land Ethic'' (1999) further extends Leopold's environmental philosophy. Callicott's ''Earth’s Insights'' (1994) is also considered an important contribution to the budding field of comparative environmental philosophy; a special edition of       the journal ''Worldviews: Environment, Culture, Religion'' (Vol. 1, Number 2) was devoted to scholarly reviews of the work.&lt;ref&gt;Publisher's website: http://www.brill.nl/product_id9007&lt;/ref&gt; Callicott is co-Editor-in-Chief with [[Robert Frodeman]] of the award-winning, two-volume A-Z ''Encyclopedia of Environmental Ethics and Philosophy'', published by [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan]] in 2009.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; He is also author of numerous journal articles and book chapters in environmental philosophy and has served as editor or co-editor of many books, textbooks, and reference works in the same field.

==Biography==
Callicott was born in [[Memphis, Tennessee]] on May 9, 1941, to distinguished regional artist and art instructor Burton H. Callicott (1907–2003), of the Memphis Academy of Arts (now [[Memphis College of Art]]).&lt;ref&gt;Unless otherwise indicated, biographical information taken from Callicott’s personal webpage, available at: http://jbcallicott.weebly.com/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, Callicott graduated from Memphis's then racially segregated [[Messick High School]] and attended Southwestern at Memphis (now [[Rhodes College]]), earning a B. A. in [[philosophy]] with Honors in 1963. He received a [[Woodrow Wilson Fellowship]]  for graduate study at [[Syracuse University]], completing his M. A. in philosophy (1966) and his doctorate in the same field (1972) after earning a Woodrow Wilson Dissertation Fellowship.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; His dissertation, titled ''[[Plato]]’s [[Aesthetics]]: An Introduction to the [[Theory of Forms]]'', drew from the concentration of his undergraduate and graduate work: [[ancient Greek philosophy]].

Callicott began his career as an academic philosopher in 1966 at Memphis State University (now the [[University of Memphis]]). There, as faculty advisor to the Black Students Association, he was active in the Southern [[Civil Rights Movement]] during the time of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]’s last campaigns in the area. In 1969, Callicott joined the philosophy department of Wisconsin State University-Stevens Point (now the [[University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point]]). As “an expatriate Southerner, fresh from the pitched battles of the Civil Rights struggle in Memphis, Tennessee,” Callicott believed that “the environment was under wholesale assault from every direction with no surcease in sight” and that “Civil Rights was a cause already won in the republic of ideas and in the courts (if not on Main Street in Memphis).”&lt;ref&gt;Callicott, J. Baird (1987a). “Preface.” Pages vii-viii in J. Baird Callicott, ed. ''Companion to A Sand County Almanac: Interpretive and Critical Essays''. Madison: [[University of Wisconsin Press]]. {{ISBN|0-299-11230-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He “was a concerned citizen, but [he] was also, more particularly, a challenged philosopher.”&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;(Callicott, 1987a)&lt;/ref&gt; So Callicott asked “how, as a philosopher, [he] could contribute to a rethinking of human nature and a reconstruction of human values to help bring them into line with the relatively new ideas about the nature of the environment emerging from [[ecology]] and the new [[physics]].”&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

For 26 years, Callicott lived and taught in the northern reaches of Wisconsin's sand counties, located on the [[Wisconsin River]], just ninety miles from Aldo Leopold's storied shack and [[John Muir]]'s first homestead on [[Fountain Lake]], the region that stirred the souls of two very influential environmental thinkers. Callicott writes that “the landscape that had helped shape and inspire the nascent evolutionary-ecological thought of the youthful Muir and that of the mature Leopold was the perfect setting for (me) to inaugurate (my) life-long vocation as a founder of academic environmental philosophy.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://jbcallicott.weebly.com/index.html J. Baird Callicott - Home]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, he joined the Department of Philosophy and Religion Studies at the [[University of North Texas]] in [[Denton, Texas|Denton]]. The first graduate program in environmental philosophy had been launched at UNT in 1990 under the aegis of Eugene C. Hargrove, then department chair and founding editor of the journal ''[[Environmental Ethics (journal)|Environmental Ethics]]''. The addition of Callicott's expertise helped cement its standing as the world's leading program in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://phil.unt.edu/about_us/index.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101022091243/http://www.phil.unt.edu/about_us/index.php |archivedate=2010-10-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
===Callicott's environmental ethic===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“I set out, as a philosopher, to work as a peer to the moral philosophers of the past, to create something new under the philosophical sun — under the gaze of [[Apollo]], as it were — ‘a new, an environmental ethic,’ such as [[Richard Routley]] had warranted in 1973.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://jbcallicott.weebly.com/introductory-palinode.html Introductory Palinode - J. Baird Callicott]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In accordance with Leopold's oft-quoted dictum — "A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community.  It is wrong when it tends otherwise"&lt;ref&gt;Leopold, Aldo (1949). A Sand County Almanac and Sketches Here and There. New York: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0195007778}}.&lt;/ref&gt; — Callicott espouses a [[holistic]], non-anthropocentric environmental ethic. What he labels the “extentionist” approach to environmental ethics attempts to extend familiar anthropocentric ethical [[paradigm]]s — legacies of the [[European Enlightenment]] — to other-than-human beings. [[Peter Singer]]’s “[[Animal liberation movement|animal liberation]],” for example, extends [[Jeremy Bentham]]’s [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] ethical paradigm to all sentient animals.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, Peter (1975). Animal Liberation: A New Ethic for Our Treatment of Animals. New York: New York Review. {{ISBN|0-394-40096-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Taylor (philosopher)|Paul Taylor]]’s “biocentrism” extends the [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]ian [[deontology|deontological]] paradigm to all “[[teleological]] centers of life” (i.e. all organisms).&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Paul W. (1986) Respect for Nature: A Theory of Environmental Ethics. Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|0-691-07709-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Extensionist approaches, however, are inveterately individualistic, conferring “moral considerability” on individual organisms. Actual environmental concerns, however, focus on transorganismic entities: endangered species; threatened biotic communities and ecosystems; rivers and lakes; the ocean and atmosphere. Callicott believes that an adequate environmental ethic — an environmental-ethics paradigm that addresses actual environmental concerns — must be holistic.

Callicott traces the conceptual foundations of the Leopold land ethic first back to [[Charles Darwin]]’s analysis of the “moral sense” in the ''[[Descent of Man]]'' and ultimately to [[David Hume]]’s grounding of ethics in the “moral sentiments” espoused in ''[[An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Callicott, J. Baird (1987b). “The Conceptual Foundations of the Land Ethic.” Pages 186-217 in J. Baird Callicott, ed. Companion to A Sand County Almanac: Interpretive and Critical Essays. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press. {{ISBN|0-299-11230-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Hume argues that moral actions and moral judgments are based on such other-oriented sentiments as sympathy, beneficence, loyalty, and patriotism.&lt;ref&gt;Hume, David (1751). An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals. London: A. Millar. {{ISBN|0-915145-45-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin argues that these “moral sentiments” evolved as the ''[[sine qua non]]'' of social (or communal) solidarity, on which depends the survival and reproductive success of the individual members of society (or community).&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, Charles (1871). The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex (1st ed.). London: John Murray. {{ISBN|0-8014-2085-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition of dichotomous thinking in [[Western philosophy]] inclines most philosophers to dismiss Hume's ethics as a kind of irrational [[emotivism]], despite the fact that, Callicott believes, Hume clearly provides a key role for reason in moral action and judgment. The faculty of reason, according to Hume, determines (1) relations of ideas, which are essentially logical relationships; and (2) matters of fact.&lt;ref&gt;Hume, David (1740). Treatise of Human Nature, Bk III, Pt. I. Sec. I. London: John Noon. {{ISBN|0-19-824588-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Among such matters of fact, reason both traces the often complex causal chain of the consequences of various actions and discloses the proper objects of the moral sentiments. Accordingly, Leopold also traces both the causal chain of ecological consequences of such seemingly innocent actions as tilling the soil and grazing cattle and discloses a proper object of those moral sentiments — such as loyalty and patriotism — which are excited by social membership and community identity.&lt;ref&gt;Leopold, Sand County; and Flader, S. L. and J. Baird Callicott, eds. (1999). The River of the Mother of God and Other Essays by Aldo. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press. {{ISBN|0-299-12760-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; That proper object of such sentiments is the “biotic community,” revealed by the relatively new science of ecology.

===Intrinsic value in Nature===
The distinctiveness of environmental ethics turns on the question of non-anthropocentrism, and that question turns on the question of nature's intrinsic value, according to Callicott.&lt;ref&gt;Callicott, J. Baird (1985). “Intrinsic Value, Quantum Theory, and Environmental Ethics.” Environmental Ethics 7: 257-275.&lt;/ref&gt; For if nature's only value is its instrumental value to humans, then environmental ethics is just a species of [[applied ethics]], similar to [[bioethics]] and [[business ethics]], not a completely new domain of ethical theory or [[moral philosophy]]. Callicott offers a [[subjectivism|subjectivist]] theory of nature's intrinsic value:&lt;ref&gt;Callicott, J. Baird (1990). “Rolston on Intrinsic Value: A Deconstruction.” Environmental Ethics 12: 99-124.&lt;/ref&gt; he does not challenge the modern classical distinction between subject and object, but rather insists that all value originates in subjects (human or otherwise) and is conferred by those subjects on various objects.&lt;ref&gt;Callicott, J. Baird (1999). “Intrinsic Value in Nature: A Metaethical Analysis.” Pages 239-261 in Callicott, J. Baird. Beyond the Land Ethic: More Essays in Environmental Philosophy. Albany: State University of New York Press. {{ISBN|0-7914-4084-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In short, Callicott claims, there would be no value without valuers. These objects, however, are valued by subjects in two fundamentally different ways: instrumentally and intrinsically. Tools of various kinds epitomize the kind of objects that subjects value instrumentally; themselves and certain other human beings epitomize the kind of objects that human subjects value intrinsically. Neither kind of valuing is normally done irrationally. A rational person does not typically value a speck of dust instrumentally; nor does a rational person typically value a plastic cup intrinsically. One values various things as tools for various reasons: drills because by their means one can make neat holes; screwdrivers because by their means one can set screws. When a tool is broken or otherwise becomes useless, a rational person ceases to value it instrumentally; and often broken and useless tools are discarded as trash. One also values various things intrinsically for various good reasons.

Philosophers have long provided reasons why human beings should be valued intrinsically (and thus not discarded when broken or useless). Aldo Leopold, according to Callicott, provides reasons why non-human species, biotic communities, and ecosystems should be valued intrinsically (and thus not severely compromised or destroyed). Of wildflowers and songbirds, for example, species with little instrumental value, Leopold writes in ''Sand County''’s “The Land Ethic”: “Yet these creatures are members of the biotic community, and if (as I believe) its stability depends on its integrity, they are entitled to continuance.”&lt;ref&gt;(Leopold, 1949, p. 210).&lt;/ref&gt; And later in “The Land Ethic,” Leopold directly invokes “philosophical value” — that is, what academic environmental philosophers call “intrinsic value”: “It is inconceivable to me that an ethical relationship to land can exist without love, respect, and admiration for land, and a high regard for its value. By value, I of course mean something far broader than mere economic value [instrumental value], I mean value in the philosophical sense [intrinsic value].”&lt;ref&gt;(Leopold, 1949, p. 223).

Boulder, CO: Westview Press. {{ISBN|0-8133-7120-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparative environmental philosophy===
Despite its newness and its departure from familiar ethical paradigms, environmental ethics was, at its inception, using the methods and conceptual resources of the Western philosophical tradition.  While that tradition has been enormously influential in shaping Western culture and institutions — especially in the domains of law, politics, and jurisprudence — the Western ''religious'' tradition has also been enormously influential in shaping Western culture and institutions. At first, the Western religious tradition was vilified in environmental ethics as the root cause of the environmental crisis.&lt;ref&gt;For the locus classicus, see Lynn White Jr., (1967). “The Historical Roots of Our Ecologic Crisis.” Science 155: 1203-1207; For an early example, see Richard Routely, “Is There a Need for a New, an Environmental Ethic” (1973). Pages 205-210 in Bulgarian Organizing Committee, ed., Proceedings of the Fifteenth World Congress of Philosophy, vol. 1. Sophia: Sophia Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Callicott has explored the possibility of a [[Judeo-Christian]] “citizenship” environmental ethic as a more radical alternative to the familiar Judeo-Christian “stewardship” environmental ethic that was developed in response to criticism from environmental historians and philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;Callicott, J. Baird (1991). "Genesis and John Muir."  Pages 106-138 in Carol Robb and Carl Casebolt, ed., Covenant for a New Creation. Maryknoll, NY: Orbis Books. {{ISBN|0-88344-740-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He has also explored the conceptual resources for environmental ethics in [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]] worldviews and worked with comparative philosophers to explore the conceptual resources for environmental ethics in several Asian philosophical and religious traditions of thought, such as [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Confucianism]], and [[Daoism]].&lt;ref&gt;Callicott, J. Baird (1982). “Traditional American Indian and Western European Attitudes Toward Nature: An Overview.” Environmental Ethics 4: 293-318. Callicott, J. Baird and Michael P. Nelson (2004).

Baird (1994) Earth’s Insights: A Multicultural Survey of Ecological Ethics from the Mediterranean Basin to the Australian Outback.

===Philosophy of conservation and the “received wilderness idea”===
Callicott has worked with [[conservation biology|conservation biologists]] to develop a [[philosophy of conservation]] and conservation values and ethics, based in part on the recent paradigm shift in ecology from what he calls the “balance of nature” to the “flux of nature.”&lt;ref&gt;Callicott, J. Baird (2006). “Conservation Values and Ethics.”  Pages 111-135 in Groom, Martha J., Gary K. Meffe, and C. Ronald Carroll, Principles of Conservation Biology, 3rd. ed. Sunderland, Mass.: Sinauer Associates. {{ISBN|0-87893-518-5}}. Callicott, J. Baird, Larry B. Crowder, and Karen Mumford (1999). “Current Normative Concepts in Conservation.” Conservation Biology 13: 22-35.&lt;/ref&gt; He has been a strong critic of the “received wilderness idea”: the idea that wildernesses are places that are “untrammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain.”&lt;ref&gt;Public Law 88-577 (16 U.S. C. 1131-1136) 88th Congress, S. 4, September 3, 1964: Sec. 2 (c).&lt;/ref&gt; That idea, Callicott claims in ''The Great New Wilderness Debate'' (1998), perpetuates a pre-Darwinian human-nature dualism; in effect, it “erases” from collective memory the indigenous inhabitants of North America and Australia, liberating the current inhabitants of those continents from disturbing thoughts of their own heritage of [[genocide]]. Exported to other regions of the world, such as Africa and India, where indigenous peoples still thrive, the wilderness idea has been used to justify their eviction and dispossession in the name of national parks. Callicott instead proposes that, because wilderness areas serve purposes of biological conservation, they should be reconceived more fittingly as “biodiversity reserves.”&lt;ref&gt;Callicott, J.

In response to Callicott's elaboration of the Aldo Leopold land ethic, the land ethic (and, by implication, Callicott's own non-anthropocentric, holistic environmental ethic to the extent that it may differ from Leopold's) has been subject to the charge of “[[ecofascism]],” notably leveled by [[Tom Regan]].&lt;ref&gt;Regan, Tom (1983). The Case for Animal Rights. Berkeley: University of California Press. {{ISBN|0-520-04904-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; If members of overpopulous species, such as deer, ought to be “culled” or “harvested,” in the name of preserving the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community, and if staggeringly overpopulous ''Homo sapiens'' is also but “a plain member and citizen” of the biotic community, then why should culling and harvesting humans be any less obligatory? In “The Conceptual Foundations of the Land Ethic,” Callicott replies that Leopold presented the land ethic as an “accretion” to our evolving complex ''set'' of ethics.&lt;ref&gt;(Callicott, 1987b)&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the land ethic burdens us with additional moral obligations; it does not substitute for or replace our previously evolved moral obligations, among them the duty to respect the rights of our fellow human beings to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.&lt;ref&gt;Callicott, J. Baird (1999). “Holistic Environmental Ethics and the Problem of Ecofascism.” Pages 59-76 in J. Baird Callicott. ''Beyond the Land Ethic: More Essays in Environmental Philosophy''. Albany, N.Y. : State University of New York Press. {{ISBN|0-7914-4084-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This reply led to another criticism: that Callicott provides no “second-order principles” to prioritize duties to fellow humans and those to the biotic community when they conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Shrader-Frechette, K. S. (1996). “Individualism, Holism, and Environmental Ethics.” Ethics and the Environment 1: 55-69.&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Callicott offered two second-order principles as a framework to adjudicate between conflicting first-order duties: 1) “obligations generated by membership in more venerable and intimate communities take precedence over those generated in more recently emerged and impersonal communities”; 2) “stronger interests take precedence over duties generated by weaker interests.”&lt;ref&gt;(Callicott, 1999, p. 73)&lt;/ref&gt; Because our various human community memberships are both more venerable and intimate and because human interests in enjoying rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness are very strong, Callicott argues that our traditional obligations to individual fellow human beings trump our obligations to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community — at least, he believes, when it comes to the prospect of culling members of the overpopulous ''Homo sapiens'' species.

Additionally, Callicott has been criticized for espousing an overbearing and impolitic [[monism]] in environmental ethics.&lt;ref&gt;Weston, Anthony (1992). “Before Environmental Ethics.” Environmental Ethics 14: 321-338.&lt;/ref&gt; He does not reject [[Value pluralism|pluralism]] in environmental ethics outright; he only rejects theoretical pluralism, not interpersonal pluralism or normative pluralism. Callicott claims that philosophers and laypersons should not adopt one theory, say [[utilitarianism]], for one purpose or in one context and another theory, say Kantian [[deontology]], for another purpose or in another context (this would be theoretical pluralism).&lt;ref&gt;Callicott, J. Baird (1990). “The Case Against Moral Pluralism.” Environmental Ethics 12: 99-124.&lt;/ref&gt; Such theories are mutually contradictory, and he believes that one's moral life should be coherent and self-consistent; however, he also believes that each person should be free to adopt the theory that to them is the most intellectually compelling (interpersonal pluralism).&lt;ref&gt;Callicott, J. Baird (1994). “Moral Monism in Environmental Philosophy Defended.” Journal of Philosophical Research 19: 51-60.&lt;/ref&gt; The general theory that Callicott espouses, Humean communitarianism, correlates ethics to community membership. And because each moral agent is subject to as many ethics as his or her community memberships, therefore each person is subject to a plurality of duties and obligations (normative pluralism). In sum, Callicott is a theoretical monist and an interpersonal and normative pluralist.

Callicott's comparative environmental philosophy also involves a tightrope walk between pluralism and monism. In ''Earth’s Insights: A Multicultural Survey of Ecological Ethics from the Mediterranean Basin to the Australian Outback'', he seems to embrace pluralism by exploring the conceptual resources for environmental ethics in a wide variety of religious and indigenous worldviews.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;(Callicott, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; This work has been criticized, however, for privileging the Leopold land ethic as a norm in reference to which such alternative environmental ethics are evaluated.&lt;ref&gt;Eaton, Heather (1997). Earth’s Insights . . . and Inadequacies.” Worldviews 1: 113-121; Lorentzen, Lois Ann (1997).  “What’s Postmodern about Earth’s Insights.” Woldviews 1: 123-129.&lt;/ref&gt; As Andrew Light observes, Callicott does not insist that the Leopold land ethic is based on the uniquely true worldview of [[evolutionary biology]] and [[ecology]].&lt;ref&gt;Light, Andrew (1995). “Around the World with Aldo Leopold (Review of J. Baird Callicott’s ''Earth’s Insights'').” Trumpeter 12 (1): 53-55. For additional critiques of this work and Callicott’s response, see Taylor, B., ed. (1997). "Special theme issue on J. Baird Callicott's ''Earth's Insights''.” Worldviews: Environment, Culture, Religion 1: 93-182.&lt;/ref&gt; He agrees with multicultural pluralists that the evolutionary-ecological worldview is but one story among many stories. But he does argue that the worldview of evolutionary biology and ecology is more tenable than any other, that the evolutionary-ecological epic is a better story than any other grand [[narrative]].&lt;ref&gt;Callicott, J. Baird (1997). “In Defense of Earth’s Insights.” Worldviews 1: 167-182.&lt;/ref&gt;

Callicott's justification for this claim is an analysis based on the following criteria for tenability: self-consistency; comprehensiveness; self-correction; universality; and beauty.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; The first test of a scientific worldview is logical self-consistency and the evolutionary-ecological worldview passes that test. A tenable scientific worldview must comprehend all known facts and so far the evolutionary-ecological worldview does account for all the facts, such as the existence of the fossil remains of extinct species. When the details of that worldview are shown to be inconsistent with themselves or unable to account for all the facts, the theory is revised accordingly; the evolutionary-ecological worldview is thus self-correcting and is therefore, Callicott believes, becoming ever more refined. The evolutionary-ecological worldview has global currency and enjoys international credibility; that is, it has universal appeal. And finally, as to beauty, Darwin himself observed in the final sentence of the ''Origin'' that “There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.”&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, Charles (1860). On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, Or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life. London: John Murray. 2nd edition. p. 490. {{ISBN|1-4353-9386-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most recent criticisms have been leveled at Callicott's works addressing the idea of wilderness, the ''sanctum sanctorum'' of the twentieth-century environmental movement. Some scholars acknowledge the intellectual merits of Callicott's critique of the wilderness idea, but regard it as both a betrayal of one of Aldo Leopold's most cherished causes and as giving aid and comfort to the environmental movement's enemies.&lt;ref&gt;See: Callicott, J. Baird and Michael P. Nelson, eds. (1998). The Great New Wilderness Debate. Athens: University of Georgia Press. {{ISBN|0-8203-1983-X}}; and Nelson, Michael P. and J. Baird Callicott, eds. (2008) The Wilderness Debate Rages On: Continuing the Great New Wilderness Debate. Athens: University of Georgia Press. {{ISBN|0-8203-2740-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Callicott counters that his quarrel is with an idea, not the places trammeled by the idea, the preservation of which places he appears to be as ardently supportive as any other [[environmentalist]]. In “Should Wilderness Areas Become Biodiversity Reserves,” he argues that the pressing conservation needs of the twenty-first century are better served by the biodiversity-reserve idea.&lt;ref&gt;Callicott, J. Baird (1996). “Should Wilderness Areas Become Biodiversity Reserves.” The George Wright Forum 13: 32-38.&lt;/ref&gt; This idea indicates by its very name what the primary goal of wildland preservation is, whereas the wilderness idea is historically associated with outdoor recreation and thus, Callicott claims, confuses the preservation issue and fosters incoherent and contradictory wildlands-use policies.

A '''Jacobi ellipsoid''' is a [[triaxial ellipsoid|triaxial (i.e. scalene) ellipsoid]] under equilibrium which arises when a self-gravitating fluid body of uniform density rotates with a constant angular velocity. It is named after the [[Germans|German]] [[mathematician]] [[Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacobi, C. G. (1834). Ueber die figur des gleichgewichts. Annalen der Physik, 109(8–16), 229–233.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History&lt;ref&gt;Chandrasekhar, S. (1969). Ellipsoidal figures of equilibrium (Vol. 10, p. 253). New Haven: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chandrasekhar, S. (1967). Ellipsoidal figures of equilibrium—an historical account. Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics, 20(2), 251–265.&lt;/ref&gt;==
Before Jacobi, the [[Maclaurin spheroid]] which was formulated in 1742, was considered to be the only type of [[ellipsoid]] which can be in equilibrium. [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]] in 1811&lt;ref&gt;Lagrange, J. L. (1811). Mécanique Analytique sect. IV 2 vol.&lt;/ref&gt; considered the possibility of a tri-axial ellipsoid being in equilibrium, but concluded that the two equatorial axes of the [[ellipsoid]] must be equal, leading back to the solution of [[Maclaurin spheroid]]. But [[Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi|Jacobi]] realized that [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]]'s demonstration is a sufficiency condition, but not necessary. He remarked, "One would make a grave mistake if one supposed that the spheroids of revolution are the only admissible figures of equilibrium even under the restrictive assumption of second degree surfaces" and further adds that "In fact a simple consideration shows that ellipsoids with three unequal axes can very well be figures of equilibrium; and that one can assume an ellipse of arbitrary shape for the equatorial section and determine the third axis (which is also the least of the three axes) and the angular velocity of rotation such that the ellipsoid is a figure of equilibrium."&lt;ref&gt;Dirichlet, G. L. (1856). Gedächtnisrede auf Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi. Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik, 52, 193–217.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jacobi formula==
[[File:Jacobi-ellipsoid-dimensions-2.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|right|The equatorial (''a'', ''b'') and polar (''c'') semi-principal axes of a Jacobi ellipsoid and Maclaurin spheroid, as a function of normalized angular momentum, subject to ''abc''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 (i.e. for constant volume of 4π/3).&lt;br/&gt;The broken lines are for the Maclaurin spheroid in the range where it has dynamic but not secular stability - it will relax into the Jacobi ellipsoid provided it can dissipate energy by virtue of a viscous constituent fluid.]]

For an ellipsoid with semi-principal axes &lt;math&gt;a, \ b, \ c&lt;/math&gt;, the angular velocity &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; about &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; axis is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Omega^2}{\pi G\rho} = 2 abc \int_0^\infty \frac{udu}{(a^2+u)(b^2+u)\Delta}\ , \quad \Delta^2 = (a^2+u)(b^2+u)(c^2+u)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the density and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gravitational constant]], subject to the condition

:&lt;math&gt;a^2 b^2 \int_0^\infty \frac{du}{(a^2+u)(b^2+u)\Delta} = c^2\int_0^\infty \frac{du}{(c^2+u)\Delta}&lt;/math&gt;

For fixed values of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, the above condition has solution for &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; such that 

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{c^2}&gt;\frac{1}{a^2} + \frac{1}{b^2}&lt;/math&gt;

The integrals can be expressed in terms of [[Elliptic integral|incomplete elliptic integral]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, G. H. (1886). On Jacobi's figure of equilibrium for a rotating mass of fluid. Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, 41(246–250), 319–336.&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of the [[Carlson symmetric form]] elliptic integral &lt;math&gt;R_{J}&lt;/math&gt;, the formula for the angular velocity becomes

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Omega^{2}}{\pi G \rho} = \frac{4 a b c}{3 (a^{2} - b^{2})} (a^{2} R_{J}(a^{2},b^{2},c^{2},a^{2}) - b^{2} R_{J}(a^{2},b^{2},c^{2},b^{2}))&lt;/math&gt;

and the condition on the relative size of the semi-principal axes &lt;math&gt;a, \ b, \ c&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{3} \frac{a^{2} b^{2}}{b^{2} - a^{2}} (R_{J}(a^{2},b^{2},c^{2},a^{2}) - R_{J}(a^{2},b^{2},c^{2},b^{2})) = \frac{2}{3} c^{2} R_{J}(a^{2},b^{2},c^{2},c^{2})&lt;/math&gt;

The angular momentum &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; of the Jacobi ellipsoid is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{L}{\sqrt{GM^3\bar{a}}} = \frac{\sqrt 3}{10}\frac{a^2+b^2}{\bar{a}^2}\sqrt{\frac{\Omega^2}{\pi G\rho}} \ , \quad \bar{a}=(abc)^{1/3}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the ellipsoid and &lt;math&gt;\bar{a}&lt;/math&gt; is the ''mean radius'', the radius of a sphere of the same volume as the ellipsoid.

==Relationship with Dedekind ellipsoid==

The Jacobi and Dedekind ellipsoids are both equilibrium figures for a body of rotating homogeneous self-gravitating fluid. However, while the Jacobi ellipsoid spins bodily, with no internal flow of the fluid in the rotating frame, the Dedekind ellipsoid maintains a fixed orientation, with the constituent fluid circulating within it. This is a direct consequence of [[Dirichlet's ellipsoidal problem#Dedekind's theorem|Dedekind's theorem]].

For any given Jacobi ellipsoid, there exists a Dedekind ellipsoid with the same semi-principal axes &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; and same mass and with a [[flow velocity|flow velocity field]] of&lt;ref name="Chandrasekhar1965"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u} = \zeta \frac{- a^{2} y \mathbf{\hat{x}} + b^{2} x \mathbf{\hat{y}}}{a^{2} + b^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt; is the [[vorticity]], which is uniform throughout the spheroid (&lt;math&gt;\nabla\times \mathbf{u} = \zeta \mathbf{\hat{z}}&lt;/math&gt;). The angular velocity &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; of the Jacobi ellipsoid and vorticity of the corresponding Dedekind ellipsoid are related by&lt;ref name="Chandrasekhar1965"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\zeta = \left( \frac{a}{b} + \frac{b}{a}\right) \Omega&lt;/math&gt;

That is, each particle of the fluid of the Dedekind ellipsoid describes a [[similarity (geometry)|similar]] elliptical circuit in the same period in which the Jacobi spheroid performs one rotation.

In the special case of &lt;math&gt;a = b&lt;/math&gt;, the Jacobi and Dedekind ellipsoids (and the Maclaurin spheroid) become one and the same; bodily rotation and circular flow amount to the same thing. In this case &lt;math&gt;\zeta = 2 \Omega&lt;/math&gt;, as is always true for a rigidly rotating body.

In the general case, the Jacobi and Dedekind ellipsoids have the same energy&lt;ref name="Bardeen"/&gt;, but the angular momentum of the Jacobi spheroid is the greater by a factor of&lt;ref name="Bardeen"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{L_{\mathrm{Jac}}}{L_{\mathrm{Ded}}} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{a}{b} + \frac{b}{a}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Kirikane tools 2.JPG|thumb|''Kirikane'' tools]]
{{nihongo|'''''Kirikane'''''|截金}} is a Japanese decorative technique used for [[Buddhist]] [[statues]] and [[paintings]], using [[gold leaf]], [[silver]] leaf, [[platinum]] leaf cut into [[wikt:line|line]]s, [[diamonds]] and [[triangles]].

==History==
Kirikane was imported from China during the [[Tang dynasty]](618–907). The oldest examples is Tamamushino Zushi at [[Horyuji Temple]]. Kirikane flourished primarily in the 11th century and continued until the 13th or 14th century. After that, however, Kirikane almost disappeared, due to the overall decline of Buddhist art. 

==Technique==
1) Two pieces of leaf (gold or silver, platinum) are heated over an [[Wood ash|ash]]-banked fire and bonded together. An additional bonding is then done to further strengthen the leaf and add thickness.

2) The bonded leaf is cut with [[bamboo]] [[knife]] on a [[deer]]-skin-covered table.

3) The bonded leaf is affixed with glue(seaweed glue, funori and hide glue, nikawa) to the object to be decorated.

The '''Learning assistant model''' is a model for improving the recruitment and education of [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] teachers. It was established in 2003 at the [[University of Colorado Boulder]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/02/04/461942790/making-science-teaching-more-than-a-backup-plan |title=Making Science Teaching More Than 'A Backup Plan' |last=Kamenetz |first=Anya |date=February 4, 2016 |website=npr.org |publisher=NPR |access-date=February 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to achieve three related goals: (1) to recruit and improve the preparation of future mathematics and science teachers, (2) to improve the education of all students enrolled in our mathematics and science courses, and (3) to engage science faculty more thoroughly in the preparation of future teachers.

The LA model was initiated as a part of the STEM Colorado project headed by Richard McCray. The impetus behind the LA model was data that most students under perform in science, technology, engineering and mathematical (STEM) subjects [1,2], that many of our teachers having neither a major nor minor in their field [3], and that large research universities are not producing adequate numbers of mathematics and science teachers [4].

The Learning Assistant model is based on the premise that teacher preparation begins with training in a specific STEM discipline.  It then encourages students to consider a career in education through a modest stipend,first hand teaching experiences, and a specially designed education seminar course.  Typically, LAs facilitate small group interactions in large-enrollment courses, and at the same time, they make up the pool from which we recruit new K-12 teachers.

The required Mathematics and Science Education Seminar aims to help LAs integrate content, pedagogy, and practice, and is taught by a faculty member from the School of Education and a K12 teacher. In this course students investigate relevant educational literature, and engage in in-depth discussions about their own teaching and learning. Seminar readings and discussions include topics such as discussion techniques, learning theory, cooperative learning, student [[epistemological|epistemologies]], metacognition and argumentation, self-explanations and tutoring, multiple intelligences and differentiated instruction, the nature of science and mathematics, national standards, teaching with technology, and qualities of an effective teacher.

Because the point of the LA model is to enhance the recruitment of well-trained students in the teaching profession, a student can continue as an LA only if s/he shows commitment to finding out more about teaching.  The outcomes of the LA project at UC Boulder are currently being evaluated through research on improvements in discipline-specific and pedagogical content knowledge and the number of new teachers recruited and retained.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25701">This page details the historic development of [[Art conservation]] in [[Europe]] and the [[United States]].

==Important dates in the history of art conservation==
Some key dates in the history of conservation in Europe and the United States include:
*1565, Restoration of the [[Sistine Chapel]] frescoes began [53 years after the ceilings were painted].
*1726, First attempt was made to restore Leonardo da Vinci's [[Last Supper]] by Michelangelo Bellotti.
*1729, First recorded transfer had been carried out by Domenico Michelini in Venice for a Titian painting (Ulisse Forni, Manuale del pittore restauratore, 1866, p.&amp;nbsp;106). The profession of restoration becomes more visible in the following years.  In the 18th century, painting restoration became a separate profession in France.
*1735 to 1820, Restoration of paintings in the Spanish royal collections following a 1734 fire.  Hundreds of important paintings were methodically treated in a specially constructed studio; materials used have been documented by Zahira Véliz.  (Zahira Véliz "The Restoration of Paintings in the Spanish Royal Collections, 1734-1820," Studies in the History of Painting Restoration, ed. Christine Sitwell and Sarah Staniforth, Archetype Publications, 1998, pp.&amp;nbsp;43–62.)
*1777, 1785, Pietro Edwards, Director of the Restoration of the Public Pictures of Venice and the Rialto, published on basic concepts of preventive conservation, original vices of painters’ materials, respect for the artist’s original intent, and reversibility.
*1794, Charles Willson Peale recorded in his memo book using wax to impregnate paintings.  By the middle of the 19th century, paintings were being wax lined; Rembrandt’s Night Watch was wax-lined in 1851. [Note precedent above with glue; first there was impregnation with an adhesive and some years later, lining.  Analogous to the 20th-century use of PVA/EVA etc.]
*1809, Count Chaptal of Napoleon’s court filed a report regarding pigments used in Pompeii. [Technical analysis of artists’ materials appears and increases in the 19th century.]
*1815, Pigment studies by Sir Humphry Davy (he had a small portable chemical laboratory and 	traveled around Europe, accompanied by Michael Faraday 1813-1815)
*1850, First U.S. Art Restoration Company was formed in New York City – Oliver Brothers Smitsonian Institution, James Oliver account books&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/james-oliver-account-books-6971|title=Summary of the James Oliver account books, 1865-1890 - Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution|author=Archives of American Art|work=si.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*1851, Rembrandt’s ''[[Night Watch (painting)|Night Watch]]'' is relined with a wax adhesive.
*1852, The cleaning by John Seguier of nine major pictures in the National Gallery, London led to a fierce public outcry and demand for an inquiry.  Cleaning controversies followed in London, Paris, Munich, (in the US by 1978, and about the Sistine 	Chapel by 1985).  (Cleaning controversies had also erupted re. policies at the Louvre in 1793.)
*1850-1853, Michael Faraday carried out analytical and deterioration studies for the National Gallery, London, investigated varnishes, cleaning methods and the impact of London fog, coal smoke, and 	gas lighting on the discoloration of surface coatings.  His findings were generally ignored.
*1860s, [[Oliver Brothers Fine Art Restoration|Oliver Brothers Fine Art Restoration and Conservation]] has expanded and opened a location in Boston. 	
*1863, Max Pettenkofer of Munich patented a method to “reverse the aging of varnish” through exposure to ethanol vapors; this method was later found to increase the interactive zone between paintings and varnish, complicating future cleanings [Ref. Sibylle Schmitt, IIC 1990].
*1870s, Louis Pasteur carried out analytical studies of paint and optical crystallography for over a decade.
*1888, [[Friedrich Rathgen]] became chemist in charge of the Royal Museums of Berlin (Staatliche Museen), first museum laboratory
*1896, [[Wilhelm Röntgen]] discovered x-rays in 1895 and x-rayed a painting the next year.  He called them  “X-rays”, using the mathematical designation for something unknown.
*1920, [[British Museum]] Research Laboratory established under the direction of Alexander Scott as a direct response to the poor state of the museum’s collections.
*1920s, George T. Oliver of Oliver Brothers Fine Art Restoration, Boston&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oliverbrothersonline.com|title=Art Restoration and Conservation - Oliver Brothers|work=Oliver Brothers Fine Art Restoration}}&lt;/ref&gt; has invented world’s first vacuum table for re-lining paintings.

*1928, [[Fogg Museum|Fogg Art Museum]]’s Technical Department established by the museum’s Director, Edward W. Forbes; this was the first research laboratory in an American museum.  His allies for technical studies of paintings were Daniel V. Thompson and Alan Burroughs.  [[George L.

*1928, Questionnaire initiated by the German museum council in 1928 on how much to clean, how much to inpaint [Berlin was a leading international art center at this time].  German activities at an international level ended when the National Socialists assumed power in 1933; art experts who emigrated (e.g. Max J. Friedländer, Ernst Gombrich, [[Julius S. Held]], Johannes Hell, Helmut Ruhemann, William Suhr, etc.) influenced attitudes in U.K. and U.S.

Lining practices were reexamined and the regular lining of paintings as a preventive measure by practicing professional conservators decreased steadily. (NOTE: this occurred ca. two decades after the introduction of vacuum lining. A philosophy of “minimal intervention” gained increasing numbers of supporters in all specialties over the next three decades.

*1982, CAL, the “Conservation Analytical Laboratory” of the Smithsonian Institution, moved to Silver 	Hill, Maryland.  A three-year program for furniture conservation was sponsored there for a limited period of time; a new class was accepted only every three years, and classes were scheduled so that professional furniture conservators could participate in segments but keep their practices.  Later the name was changed to SCMRE and in 2005 to “MCI,” Museum Conservation Institute.

*1995, National Endowment for the Arts ceased funding training in art conservation.
*1997, RAP, Regional Alliance for Preservation (RAP) began in February 1997 as a pilot project of the Commission on Preservation and Access (Washington, DC) to foster cooperation among the Preservation Field Service programs funded by the NEH.  When pilot-project funding ended in February 1998, participants decided to continue RAP as a cooperative program; the alliance expanded to include members of the Association of Regional Conservation Centers (ARCC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rap-arcc.org/|title=RAP|work=rap-arcc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are now 13 members.

Most [[archaeologists]] believe that Machu Picchu was constructed as an estate for the Inca emperor [[Pachacuti]] (1438–1472). Often mistakenly referred to as the "Lost City of the Incas" (a title more accurately applied to [[Vilcabamba, Peru|Vilcabamba]]), it is the most familiar icon of [[Inca Empire|Inca civilization]]. The Incas built the estate around 1450 but abandoned it a century later at the time of the [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire|Spanish Conquest]]. Although known locally, it was not known to the Spanish during the colonial period and remained unknown to the outside world until American historian [[Hiram Bingham III|Hiram Bingham]] brought it to international attention in 1911.

Machu Picchu was built in the classical Inca style, with polished [[dry-stone wall]]s. Its three primary structures are the ''[[Intihuatana, Urubamba|Intihuatana]]'', the ''Temple of the Sun'', and the ''Room of the Three Windows''. Most of the outlying buildings have been reconstructed in order to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.{{sfn|Nava|1976|pp=9–10}} By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored{{sfn|Nava|1976|pp=9–10}} and restoration continues.{{sfn|Davey|2001|p=}}

Machu Picchu was declared a Peruvian Historic Sanctuary in 1981 and a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in 1983.&lt;ref name="UNESCO WHC"/&gt; In 2007, Machu Picchu was voted one of the [[New7Wonders of the World#Winners|New Seven Wonders of the World]] in a worldwide Internet poll.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://world.new7wonders.com/|title=Home {{!}} Creating Global Memory|website=New7Wonders of the World|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
In the [[Quechua language]], ''machu'' means "old" or "old person", while ''pikchu'' means either "portion of coca being chewed" or "pyramid, pointed multi-sided solid; cone".&lt;ref&gt;Teofilo Laime Ajacopa, [http://futatraw.ourproject.org/descargas/DicQuechuaBolivia.pdf Diccionario Bilingüe, Iskay simipi yuyayk'ancha, Quechua – Castellano, Castellano – Quechua].&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the site is often interpreted as "old mountain".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Luciano |first1= Pellegrino A. |date= 2011 |title= Where are the Edges of a Protected Area? Political Dispossession in Machu Picchu, Peru |journal= Conservation and Society |volume= 9 |issue= 1 |pages= 35–41 |doi=  |jstor= 26393123 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Machupicchu hb10.jpg|thumb|View of the city of Machu Picchu in 1912 showing the original ruins after major clearing and before modern reconstruction work began.{{sfn|Nava|2000|pp=9–10}}{{sfn|Davey|2001}}]]

Machu Picchu was built around 1450–1460.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bBHrWwtr_pYC&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=history+of+machu+picchu#v=onepage&amp;q=history%20of%20machu%20picchu&amp;f=false|title=Machu Picchu: Unveiling the Mystery of the Incas|last=Burger|first=Richard L.|last2=Salazar|first2=Lucy C.|date=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0300097634|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its construction appears to date to the period of the two great Inca rulers, [[Pachacuti|Pachacutec Inca Yupanqui]] (1438–71) and [[Topa Inca Yupanqui|Túpac Inca Yupanqui]] (1472–93).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/274|title=Historic Sanctuary of Machu Picchu|publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hiram/&gt;{{rp|xxxvi}} There is a consensus among archaeologists that Pachacutec ordered the construction of the royal estate for himself, most likely after his successful military campaign. Though Machu Picchu is considered to be a "royal" estate, surprisingly, the estate would not have been passed down in the line of [[order of succession|succession]]. It was only used for approximately 80 years before being abandoned seemingly due to destruction of the [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire|Spanish Conquests]] in other parts of the [[Inca Empire]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is possible that most of its inhabitants died from [[smallpox]] introduced by travellers before the Spanish [[conquistador]]s arrived in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KQR6iXMT11EC|title=Plagues and Peoples|last=McNeill|first=William|date=2010-10-27|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=9780307773661|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Daily life of Machu Picchu as a royal estate===
During its use as a royal estate, it is estimated that no more than 750 people lived there at a time, most people being support staff (''[[Yanakuna|yanaconas]], yana)''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Turner|first=Bethany L.|date=2010|title=Variation in Dietary Histories Among the Immigrants of Machu Picchu: Carbon and Nitrogen Isotope Evidence|url=http://www.redalyc.org/html/326/32615600012/|journal=Chungara, Revista de Antropología Chilena|volume=42|issue=2|pages=515–534|via=Universidad Autónoma del Estado de México Sistema de Información Cientifica Redalyc|doi=10.4067/s0717-73562010000200012}}&lt;/ref&gt; who lived there permanently. Though the estate belonged to Pachacutec, religious specialists and temporary specialized workers (''mayocs'') lived there as well, most likely for the ruler's well-being and enjoyment. During the harsher season, staff dropped down to around a hundred servants and a few religious specialists focused only on maintenance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Studies show that according to their skeletal remains, most people who lived there were immigrants from diverse backgrounds. They lacked the chemical markers and osteological markers they would have if they had been living there their whole lives. Instead, there was bone damage from various species of water [[Parasites of humans|parasites]] indigenous to different areas of Peru. There were also varying osteological stressors and varying chemical densities suggesting varying long term diets characteristic of specific regions that were spaced apart.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Turner|first=Bethany L.|last2=Armelagos|first2=George J.|date=2012-09-01|title=Diet, residential origin, and pathology at Machu Picchu, Peru|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|language=en|volume=149|issue=1|pages=71–83|doi=10.1002/ajpa.22096|pmid=22639369|issn=1096-8644}}&lt;/ref&gt; These diets are composed of varying levels of [[maize]], [[potato]]es, [[grain]]s, [[legume]]s, and [[fish]], but the overall most recent short-term diet for these people was composed of less fish and more corn. This suggests that several of the immigrants were from more coastal areas and moved to Machu Picchu where corn was a larger portion of food intake.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The skeletal remains found at Machu Picchu are also unique in their level of natural bone damage from laborious activities. Most people found at the site had lower levels of [[arthritis]] and [[bone fracture]]s found in most sites of the Inca Empire. Inca individuals that have arthritis and bone fractures are typically those who performed heavy physical labor (such as the [[Mit'a]]) and/or served in the [[Inca army|Inca military]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Llama on Machu Picchu.jpg|thumb|Llama with Machu Picchu ruins in background.]]
Not only people were suspected to have immigrated to Machu Picchu, there were several animal bones found that were not native to the site. Most animal bones found were from [[llama]]s and [[alpaca]]s. These animals naturally live in altitudes of 14000&amp;nbsp;ft above sea level rather than the mere 8000&amp;nbsp;ft Machu Picchu rests on. Most likely, these animals were brought in from the [[Puna grassland|Puna]] region&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2008.09.019 |title=Reviewing human–environment interactions in arid regions of southern South America during the past 3000 years |journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology |volume=281 |issue=3–4 |pages=283–295 |year=2009 |last1=Morales |first1=M. |last2=Barberena |first2=R. |last3=Belardi |first3=J.B. |last4=Borrero |first4=L. |last5=Cortegoso |first5=V. |last6=Durán |first6=V. |last7=Guerci |first7=A. |last8=Goñi |first8=R. |last9=Gil |first9=A. |last10=Neme |first10=G. |last11=Yacobaccio |first11=H. |last12=Zárate |first12=M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; for meat consumption and for their pelts. [[Guinea pig]]s were also found at the site in special burial caves, suggesting that they were at least used for funerary rituals&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; as it was common throughout the Inca Empire to use them for sacrifices and meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XGtFCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA38&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;dq=tubers+were+grown+at+what+elevation+in+inca+empire#v=onepage&amp;q=guinea&amp;f=false|title=Daily Life in the Inca Empire, 2nd Edition|last=Malpass|first=Michael A.|date=2009-04-30|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9780313355493|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six dogs were also recovered from the site. Due to their placements among the human remains, it is believed that they served as companions of the dead.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; &lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt;

===Agriculture===
[[File:Machu Picchu (3833992683).jpg|thumb|Terraces used for farming at Machu Picchu]]
Much of the [[Incan agriculture|farming]] done at Machu Picchu was done on the hundreds of man-made terraces there. These terraces were a work of considerable engineering, built to ensure good drainage and soil fertility while also protecting the mountain itself from erosion and landslides. However, the terraces were not perfect, as studies of the land show that there were landslides that happened during the construction of Machu Picchu. It can still be seen where the terraces were shifted by landslides and then stabilized by the Inca as they continued to build around the area.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Jeff L.|date=January 2001|title=Rediscovering the lost city|url=https://search-proquest-com.libproxy.mst.edu/docview/228471133?pq-origsite=summon&amp;accountid=14594|journal=Civil Engineering; New York|volume=71|pages=32–39|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated that the area around the site has received more than 72 inches of rain per year since A.D. 1450, which was more than needed to support crop growth there. Because of the large amount of rainfall at Machu Picchu, it was found that [[Irrigation in Peru|irrigation]] was not needed for the terraces. The terraces received so much rain that they were built specifically to allow for ample drainage of the extra water. Excavation and soil analyses done by [[Incan engineers|Kenneth Wright]] in the 90's showed that the terraces were built in layers, with a bottom layer of larger stones covered by loose gravel.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; On top of the gravel was a layer of mixed sand and gravel packed together, with rich topsoil covering all of that. It was proven that the topsoil was probably moved from the valley floor to the terraces because it was much more rich than the soil higher up the mountain.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

However, it has been found that the terrace farming area makes up only about 12 acres of land, and a study of the soil around the terraces showed that what was grown there was mostly corn and potatoes, which was not enough to support the 750+ people living at Machu Picchu. Therefore, when studies were done on the food that the Incas ate at Machu Picchu, it was found that much of what they ate was imported to the area from the surrounding valleys and farther.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Encounters===
Although it was located only about {{convert|80|km|mi|sp=us}} from the Inca capital in [[Cusco]], the Spanish never found Machu Picchu and so did not plunder or destroy it, as they did many other sites.{{sfn|Wright| Valencia Zegarra|p=1}}&lt;ref name=Hiram/&gt;{{rp|xxx}} The conquistadors had notes of a place called ''Piccho'', although no record of a Spanish visit exists. The types of sacred rocks defaced by the conquistadors in other locations are untouched at Machu Picchu.{{sfn|Wright|Valencia Zegarra|2001|p=1}}

Over the centuries, the surrounding jungle overgrew the site, and few outside the immediate area knew of its existence. The site may have been discovered and plundered in 1867 by a German businessman, Augusto Berns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7439397.stm |title= Machu Picchu ruin 'found earlier' |publisher=BBC News  |author=Dan Collyns |date=6 June 2008}};{{cite web| url=https://www.newscientist.com/channel/being-human/dn14050-incan-lost-city-looted-by-german-businessman.html|title= Incan lost city looted by German businessman |publisher=New Scientist |author=Michael Marshall |date=7 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some evidence indicates that German engineer J.

In 1911 American historian and explorer [[Hiram Bingham III|Hiram Bingham]] travelled the region looking for the old Inca capital and was led to Machu Picchu by a villager, Melchor Arteaga. Bingham found the name Agustín Lizárraga and the date 1902 written in charcoal on one of the walls.  Though Bingham was not the first to visit the ruins, he was considered the scientific discoverer who brought Machu Picchu to international attention.  Bingham organized another expedition in 1912 to undertake major clearing and excavation.&lt;ref name=Hiram/&gt;{{rp|xxx-xxxi}}

In 1981, Peru declared an area of {{convert|325.92|km2|2|abbr=out}} surrounding Machu Picchu a "historic sanctuary". In addition to the ruins, the sanctuary includes a large portion of the adjoining region, rich with the [[flora]] and [[fauna]] of the [[Peruvian Yungas]] and [[Central Andean wet puna]] [[ecoregions]].&lt;ref name="ecoregions"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2001)051[0933:TEOTWA]2.0.CO;2 |volume=51 |pages=933–8 |title=Terrestrial Ecoregions of the World: A New Map of Life on Earth |last1=Olson |first1=David M. |last2=Dinerstein |first2=Eric |last3=Wikramanayake |first3=Eric D. |last4=Burgess |first4=Neil D. |last5=Powell |first5=George V.

In 1983, UNESCO designated Machu Picchu a [[World Heritage site]], describing it as "an absolute masterpiece of architecture and a unique testimony to the Inca civilization".&lt;ref name="unesco"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/archive/advisory_body_evaluation/274.pdf|title=UNESCO advisory body evaluation|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First American expedition===

[[File: Sergeant Carrasco at Machu Picchu on 24 July 1911.jpg|thumb|Sergeant Carrasco at Machu Picchu on 24 July 1911]]
Bingham was a lecturer at [[Yale University]], although not a trained archaeologist. In 1909, returning from the Pan-American Scientific Congress in Santiago, he travelled through Peru and was invited to explore the Inca ruins at [[Choquequirao|Choqquequirau]] in the Apurímac Valley. He organized the 1911 Yale Peruvian Expedition in part to search for the Inca capital, which was thought to be the city of [[Vitcos]]. He consulted Carlos Romero, one of the chief historians in Lima who showed him helpful references and Father [[Antonio de la Calancha]]’s Chronicle of the Augustinians.  In particular, Ramos thought Vitcos was "near a great white rock over a spring of fresh water."  Back in Cusco again, Bingham asked planters about the places mentioned by Calancha, particularly along the Urubamba River.  According to Bingham, "one old prospector said there were interesting ruins at Machu Picchu," though his statements "were given no importance by the leading citizens."  Only later did Bingham learn that [[Charles Wiener]] also heard of the ruins at [[Huayna Picchu]] and Machu Picchu, but was unable to reach them.&lt;ref name="Hiram"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bingham|first1=Hiram|title=Lost City of the Incas|date=1952|publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson|isbn=9781842125854|pages=112–135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File: Hiram Bingham III at his tent door near Machu Picchu in 1912.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Hiram Bingham III]] at his tent door near Machu Picchu in 1912]]
Armed with this information the expedition went down the [[Urubamba River]]. En route Bingham asked local people to show them Inca ruins, especially any place described as having a white rock over a spring.&lt;ref name=Hiram/&gt;{{rp|137}}

At Mandor Pampa, Bingham asked farmer and innkeeper Melchor Arteaga if he knew of any nearby ruins. Arteaga said he knew of excellent ruins on the top of Huayna Picchu.{{sfn|Bingham|2010}} The next day, 24 July, Arteaga led Bingham and Sergeant Carrasco across the river on a log bridge and up the Huayna Picchu mountain. At the top of the mountain, they came across a small hut occupied by a couple of [[Quechua people|Quechua]], Richard and Alvarez, who were farming some of the original Machu Picchu agricultural terraces that they had cleared four years earlier. Alvarez's 11-year-old son, Pablito, led Bingham along the ridge to the main ruins.{{sfn|Wright|Valencia Zegarra|2001|p=1}}

The ruins were mostly covered with vegetation except for the cleared agricultural terraces and clearings used by the farmers as vegetable gardens. Because of the vegetation, Bingham was not able to observe the full extent of the site. He took preliminary notes, measurements, and photographs, noting the fine quality of Inca stonework of several principal buildings. Bingham was unclear about the original purpose of the ruins, but decided that there was no indication that it matched the description of Vitcos.&lt;ref name=Hiram/&gt;{{rp|141,186–187}}

The expedition continued down the Urubamba and up the Vilcabamba Rivers examining all the ruins they could find. Guided by locals Bingham rediscovered and correctly identified the site of the old Inca capital, [[Vitcos]] (then called Rosaspata), and the nearby temple of [[Chuquipalta]]. He then crossed a pass and into the Pampaconas Valley where he found more ruins heavily buried in the jungle undergrowth at [[Espíritu Pampa]], which he named "Trombone Pampa".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bulletin of the Geographical Society of Philadelphia|year=1912|volume=10|chapter=Yale Expedition to Peru|pages=134–136|chapter-url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=DHBIAAAAYAAJ|page=134}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; As was the case with Machu Picchu, the site was so heavily overgrown that Bingham could only note a few of the buildings. In 1964, [[Gene Savoy]] further explored the ruins at Espiritu Pampa and revealed the full extent of the site, identifying it as [[Vilcabamba, Peru|Vilcabamba]] Viejo where the Incas fled after the Spanish drove them from Vitcos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rodriguez-Camilloni |first1=Humberto |title=Reviewed Work: Machu Picchu: Unveiling the Mystery of the Incas by Richard L Burger, Lucy C.

Bingham returned to Machu Picchu in 1912 under the sponsorship of Yale University and National Geographic again and with the full support of Peruvian [[Augusto B. Leguía|President Leguia]]. The expedition undertook a four-month clearing of the site with local labour, which was expedited with the support of the Prefect of Cuzco. Excavation started in 1912 with further excavation undertaken in 1914 and 1915. Bingham focused on Machu Picchu because of its fine Inca stonework and well-preserved nature, which had lain undisturbed since the site was abandoned. None of Bingham's several hypotheses explaining the site held up. During his studies, he carried various artifacts back to Yale. One prominent artifact was a set of 15th-century, ceremonial Incan knives made from [[bismuth bronze]]; they are the earliest known artifact containing this alloy.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Robert and John Rutledge 1984 Bismuth Bronze from Machu Picchu, Peru. American Association for the Advancement of Science, Washington, DC. p. 585&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Fellman |first=Bruce |date=December 2002 |title=Rediscovering Machu Picchu|url=http://archives.yalealumnimagazine.com/issues/02_12/machupicchu.html |magazine=Yale Alumni Magazine|access-date= 7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although local institutions initially welcomed the exploration, they soon accused Bingham of legal and cultural malpractice.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Salvatore |first1=Ricardo Donato |title=Local versus Imperial Knowledge: Reflections on Hiram Bingham and the Yale Peruvian Expedition |journal=Nepantla: Views from South |volume=4 |issue=1 |year=2003 |pages=67–80 |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/article/40208 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rumors arose that the team was stealing artifacts and smuggling them out of Peru through Bolivia. (In fact, Bingham removed many artifacts, but openly and legally; they were deposited in the Yale University Museum. Bingham was abiding by the 1852 Civil Code of Peru; the code stated that "archaeological finds generally belonged to the discoverer, except when they had been discovered on private land." (Batievsky 100)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yvXTcGC5CwQC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;lpg=PA100&amp;dq=Peru%E2%80%99s+Civil+Code+of+1852#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Art and Cultural Heritage: Law, Policy and Practice|last=Hoffman|first=Barbara T.|date=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521857642|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; ) Local press perpetuated the accusations, claiming that the excavation harmed the site and deprived local archaeologists of knowledge about their own history.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt; Landowners began to demand rent from the excavators.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt; By the time Bingham and his team left Machu Picchu, locals had formed coalitions to defend their ownership of Machu Picchu and its cultural remains, while Bingham claimed the artifacts ought to be studied by experts in American institutions.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt;

===Human sacrifice and mysticism===
Little information describes human sacrifices at Machu Picchu, though many sacrifices were never given a proper burial, and their skeletal remains succumbed to the elements.&lt;ref name=Gaither&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gaither|first=Catherine|author2=Jonathan Kent |author3=Victor Sanchez |author4=Teresa Tham |title=Mortuary Practices and Human Sacrifice in the Middle Chao Valley of Peru: Their Interpretation in the Context of Andean Mortuary Patterning.|journal=Latin American Antiquity|date=June 2008|volume=19|issue=2|pages=107, 115, 119}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|115}} However, there is evidence that retainers were sacrificed to accompany a deceased noble in the afterlife.&lt;ref name=Gaither/&gt;{{rp|107,119}} Animal, liquid and dirt sacrifices to the gods were much more common, made at the Altar of the Condor.

==Geography==
[[File:Karta MachuPicchu.PNG|thumb|upright=1.5|Map of Machu Picchu]]
Machu Picchu lies in the [[southern hemisphere]], 13.164 degrees south of the [[equator]].{{sfn|Wright| Valencia Zegarra|p= ix}} It is {{convert|80|km|0|abbr=off}} northwest of Cusco, on the crest of the mountain Machu Picchu, located about {{convert|2430|m|ft|abbr=off}} [[above mean sea level]], over {{convert|1000|m|ft}} lower than [[Cusco]], which has an elevation of {{convert|3600|m|ft}}.{{sfn|Wright| Valencia Zegarra|p= ix}} As such, it had a milder climate than the Inca capital. It is one of the most important archaeological sites in South America, one of the most visited tourist attractions in Latin America{{sfn|Davies|1997|p=163}} and the most visited in Peru.

Machu Picchu has [[wet season|wet]] and [[dry season]]s, with the majority of [[Precipitation (meteorology)|annual rain]] falling from October through to April.{{sfn|Wright| Valencia Zegarra|p= ix}}

Machu Picchu is situated above a bow of the Urubamba River, which surrounds the site on three sides, where cliffs drop vertically for {{convert|450|m|ft}} to the river at their base. The area is subject to morning mists rising from the river.{{sfn|Wright| Valencia Zegarra|p= 1}} The location of the city was a military secret, and its deep precipices and steep mountains provided natural defenses. The [[Inca Bridge]], an [[Inca rope bridge|Inca grass rope bridge]], across the Urubamba River in the [[Pongo de Mainique]], provided a secret entrance for the [[Inca army]]. Another Inca bridge was built to the west of Machu Picchu, the tree-trunk bridge, at a location where a gap occurs in the cliff that measures {{convert|6|m|ft}}.

The city sits in a saddle between the two mountains Machu Picchu and Huayna Picchu,{{sfn|Wright| Valencia Zegarra|p= 1}} with a commanding view down two valleys and a nearly impassable mountain at its back. It has a water supply from springs that cannot be blocked easily. The hillsides leading to it were terraced, to provide more farmland to grow crops, and to steepen the slopes that invaders would have to ascend. The terraces reduced soil [[erosion]] and protected against [[landslide]]s.{{sfn|Wright|Valencia Zegarra|Crowley|2000b|p=2}} Two high-altitude routes from Machu Picchu cross the mountains back to Cusco, one through the [[Sun Gate]], and the other across the Inca bridge. Both could be blocked easily, should invaders approach along them.

==Site==

===Layout===
[[File:MachuPicchu TerracedFields (pixinn.net).jpg|thumb|Terraced fields in the upper agricultural sector]]
[[File:Machupicchu intihuatana.JPG|thumb|Temple of the Sun or Torreon]]

The site is roughly divided into an urban sector and an agricultural sector, and into an upper town and a lower town. The temples are in the upper town, the warehouses in the lower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bordewich|first=Fergus|authorlink=Fergus Bordewich|title=Winter Palace|journal=Smithsonian|date=March 2003|page=110|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/winterpalace77490707/?all|accessdate=25 February 2013}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The architecture is adapted to the mountains. Approximately 200 buildings are arranged on wide parallel terraces around an east-west central square. The various compounds, called ''kanchas'', are long and narrow in order to exploit the terrain. Sophisticated channeling systems provided irrigation for the fields. Stone stairways set in the walls allowed access to the different levels across the site. The eastern section of the city was probably residential. The western, separated by the square, was for religious and ceremonial purposes. This section contains the ''Torreón'', the massive tower which may have been used as an observatory.{{sfn|Longhena|2010|p=252}}

Located in the first zone are the primary archaeological treasures: the ''[[Intihuatana, Urubamba|Intihuatana]]'', the ''Temple of the Sun'' and the ''Room of the Three Windows''. These were dedicated to ''[[Inti]]'', their sun god and greatest deity.

The Popular District, or Residential District, is the place where the lower-class people lived. It includes storage buildings and simple houses.

The royalty area, a sector for the [[nobility]], is a group of houses located in rows over a slope; the residence of the ''[[amautas]]'' (wise persons) was characterized by its reddish walls, and the zone of the ''ñustas'' (princesses) had trapezoid-shaped rooms. The Monumental Mausoleum is a carved statue with a vaulted interior and carved drawings. It was used for rites or sacrifices.

The Guardhouse is a three-sided building, with one of its long sides opening onto the Terrace of the Ceremonial Rock. The three-sided style of Inca architecture is known as the ''wayrona'' style.{{sfn|Wright| Valencia Zegarra|p= 8}}

In 2005 and 2009, the [[University of Arkansas]] made detailed [[3d laser scanning|laser scans]] of the entire site and of the ruins at the top of the adjacent Huayna Picchu mountain. The scan data is available online for research purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://cast.uark.edu/home/education/field-programs/geomatics-for-archaeology-field-school.html| title=Computer Modeling of Heritage Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temple of the Sun or Torreon===
This semicircular temple is built on the same rock overlying Bingham's "Royal Mausoleum", and is similar to the [[Coricancha#Inca Astronomy|Temple of the Sun]] found in Cusco and the Temple of the Sun found in [[Pisac]], in having what Bingham described as a "parabolic enclosure wall".  The stonework is of [[ashlar]] quality.  Within the temple is a 1.2 m by 2.7 m rock platform, smooth on top except for a small platform on its southwest quadrant.  A "Serpent's Door" faces 340°, or just west of north, opening onto a series of 16 pools, and affording a view of Huana Picchu. The temple also has two [[trapezoidal]] windows, one facing 65°, called the "Solstice Window", and the other facing 132°, called the "[[Qullqa]] Window".  The northwest edge of the rock platform points out the Solstice Window to within 2’ of the 15th century [[June solstice]] rising Sun.  For comparison, the [[angular diameter]] of the Sun is 6'.  The [[Constelation#Dark cloud constellations|Inca constellation]] Qullca, storehouse, can be viewed out the Qullqa Window at sunset during the 15th century June Solstice, hence the window's name. At the same time, the [[Pleaides]] are in the opposite end of the sky.  Also seen through this window on this night are the constellations Llamacnawin, Llama, Unallamacha, Machacuay, and the star Pachapacariq Chaska ([[Canopus]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dearborn |first1=D.S.P. |last2=White |first2=R.E. |title=The "Torreon" of Machu Picchu as an Observatory |journal=Archaeoastronomy |volume=14 |date=1983 |issue= 5|pages=S37 |bibcode=1983JHAS...14...37D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Krupp |first1=Edwin |title=Echoes of the Ancient Skies |date=1994 |publisher=Dover Publications, Inc. |location=Mineola |isbn=9780486428826 |pages=47–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intihuatana stone===
{{main|Intihuatana, Urubamba}}
[[File:Intihuatana Solar Clock.jpg|thumb|right|''Intihuatana'' is believed to have been designed as an astronomic clock or calendar by the Incas]]
[[File:Pachamama.jpg|thumb|The sculpture carved from the rock bottom of the sun temple is interpreted as "Water mirrors for observing the sky".{{sfn|Doig|2005}}]]

The ''Intihuatana'' stone is one of many [[ritual]] stones in South America. These stones are arranged to point directly at the sun during the winter [[solstice]].&lt;ref name="Amao2012b"&gt;{{cite book|last=Amao|first=Albert|title=The Dawning of the Golden Age of Aquarius: Redefining the Concepts of God, Man, and the Universe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tZkOKM5VjHcC&amp;pg=PA78|accessdate=16 July 2012|date=24 January 2012|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4685-3752-9|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the stone (perhaps coined by Bingham) derives from [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] language: ''inti'' means "sun", and ''wata-'', "to tie, hitch (up)". The suffix ''-na'' derives nouns for tools or places. Hence ''Intihuatana'' is literally an instrument or place to "tie up the sun", often expressed in English as "The Hitching Post of the Sun". The Inca believed the stone held the sun in its place along its annual path in the sky.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} The stone is situated at 13°9'48" S. At midday on 11 November and 30 January, the sun stands almost exactly above the pillar, casting no shadow. On 21 June, the stone casts the longest shadow on its southern side, and on 21 December a much shorter shadow on its northern side.

===Inti Mach'ay and the Royal Feast of the Sun===
Inti Mach'ay is a special cave used to observe the Royal Feast of the Sun. This festival was celebrated during the Incan month of ''Qhapaq Raymi''. It began earlier in the month and concluded on the December solstice. On this day, noble boys were initiated into manhood by an ear-piercing ritual as they stood inside the cave and watched the sun rise.{{sfn|Dearborn|Schreiber|White|1987|p=346}}

Architecturally, Inti Mach'ay is the most significant structure at Machu Picchu. Its entrances, walls, steps and windows are some of the finest masonry in the Incan Empire. The cave also includes a tunnel-like window unique among Incan structures, which was constructed to only allow sunlight into the cave during several days around the December solstice. For this reason, the cave was inaccessible for much of the year.{{sfn|Dearborn|Schreiber|White|1987|pp=349–351}} Inti Mach'ay is located on the eastern side of Machu Picchu, just north of the "Condor Stone." Many of the caves surrounding this area were prehistorically used as tombs, yet there is no evidence that Mach'ay was a burial ground.{{sfn|Dearborn|Schreiber|White|1987|p=349.}}

[[File:Funerary Stone in Machu Picchu.jpg|thumb|Funerary Stone in upper cemetery]]

The central buildings use the classical Inca architectural style of polished dry-stone walls of regular shape. The Incas were masters of this technique, called [[ashlar]], in which blocks of stone are cut to fit together tightly without [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]].

The section of the mountain where Machu Picchu was built provided various challenges that the Incas solved with local materials. One issue was the seismic activity due to two fault lines. It made mortar and similar building methods nearly useless. Instead, the Inca mined stones from the quarry at the site, lined them up and shaped them to fit together perfectly, stabilizing the structures. [[Inca]] walls have many stabilizing features: doors and windows are trapezoidal, narrowing from bottom to top; corners usually are rounded; inside corners often incline slightly into the rooms; and outside corners were often tied together by "L"-shaped blocks; walls are offset slightly from row to row rather than rising straight from bottom to top.

Heavy rainfall required terraces and stone chips to drain rain water and prevent mud slides, landslides, erosion and flooding. Terraces were layered with stone chips, sand, dirt and top soil, to absorb water and prevent it from running down the mountain. Similar layering protected the large city center from flooding.{{sfn|Wright|Valencia Zegarra|2000}} Multiple canals and reserves provide water throughout the city that could be supplied to the terraces for irrigation and to prevent erosion and flooding.

The Incas never used wheels in a practical way, although their use in toys shows that they knew the principle. The use of wheels in engineering may have been limited due to the lack of strong [[Working animal#Animals used for their strength|draft animals]], steep terrain and dense vegetation. The approach to moving and placing the enormous stones remains uncertain, probably involving hundreds of men to push the stones up inclines. A few stones have knobs that could have been used to lever them into position; the knobs were generally sanded away, with a few overlooked.

===Roads and transportation===
The [[Inca road system]] included a route to the Machu Picchu region. The people of Machu Picchu were connected to long-distance trade, as shown by non-local artifacts found at the site. For example, Bingham found unmodified [[obsidian]] nodules at the entrance gateway. In the 1970s, [[Richard L. Burger|Burger]] and Asaro determined that these obsidian samples were from the ''Titicaca'' or [[Chivay obsidian source]], and that the samples from Machu Picchu showed long-distance transport of this obsidian type in pre-Hispanic Peru.{{sfn|Burger|Salazar|2004}}{{page needed|date=September 2012}}

Thousands of tourists walk the [[Inca Trail to Machu Picchu|Inca Trail]] to visit Machu Picchu each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caminoincatrail.com/galeria/index.html|title=Galería de Fotos Camino Inca|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160207033208/http://caminoincatrail.com/galeria/index.html|archivedate=7 February 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; They congregate at Cusco before starting on the one-, two-, four- or five-day journey on foot from kilometer 82 (or 77 or 85, four/five-day trip) or kilometer 104 (one/two-day trip) near the town of [[Ollantaytambo]] in the Urubamba valley, walking up through the Andes to the isolated city.

===Tourism===
Machu Picchu is both a cultural and natural [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. Since its discovery in 1911, growing numbers of tourists have visited the site each year, including 1,411,279 in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://datosturismo.mincetur.gob.pe/appdatosTurismo/frmReporte.aspx?id=224 |title=Cusco: Llegada de visitantes al Santuario Histórico de Machu Picchu |publisher=[[MINCETUR]] |date=December 2017 |accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Peru's most visited tourist attraction and major revenue generator, it is continually exposed to economic and commercial forces. In the late 1990s, the Peruvian government granted concessions to allow the construction of a cable car and a luxury hotel, including a tourist complex with boutiques and restaurants and a bridge to the site.&lt;ref name="BBC1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6292327.stm|title=Bridge stirs the waters in Machu Picchu|date=2007-02-01|access-date=2016-06-07 |publisher=[[BBC News Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people protested the plans, including Peruvians and foreign scientists, saying that more visitors would pose a physical burden on the ruins.&lt;ref name=test&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040818065057/http://www.sacredland.org/world_sites_pages/M_Picchu.html Global Sacred Lands: Machu Picchu] Sacredland.org, Sacred Land Film Project.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[no-fly zone]] exists above the area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/5326042.stm "Peru bans flights over Inca ruins"], [[BBC News Online]], 8 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNESCO]] is considering putting Machu Picchu on its [[List of World Heritage in Danger]].&lt;ref name="BBC1"/&gt;

During the 1980s a large rock from Machu Picchu's central plaza was moved to a different location to create a helicopter landing zone. In the 1990s, the government prohibited helicopter landings. In 2006, a Cusco-based company, Helicusco, sought approval for tourist flights over Machu Picchu.

Nude tourism is a recent trend, to the dismay of Peruvian officials. In several incidents, tourists were detained for posing for nude pictures or [[streaking]] across the site. Peru's Ministry of Culture denounced these acts for threatening Peru's cultural heritage. Cusco's Regional Director of Culture increased surveillance to end the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Liu|first=Evie|title=Peru to Tourists: 'Stop getting naked at Machu Picchu!'|url= http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/20/travel/naked-tourists-machu-picchu-peru/index.html?sr=tw032014picchunaked1030astory|publisher=CNN|accessdate=20 March 2014|date=2014-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===January 2010 evacuation===
{{See also|El Niño-Southern Oscillation}}
In January 2010, heavy rain caused flooding that buried or washed away roads and railways to Machu Picchu, trapping more than 2,000 locals and more than 2,000 tourists, later airlifted out to safety. Machu Picchu was temporarily closed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ubalert.com/a/14452|title=Machu Picchu Airlift Rescues 1,400 Tourists|last=BBC|first=jhayzee27|date=29 January 2010|work=Disaster Alert Network LLC|publisher=UBAlert|accessdate=7 February 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110309080322/http://www.ubalert.com/a/14452|archive-date=9 March 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; reopening on 1 April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/travel/2010992388_webperu05.html?syndication=rss|title=Machu Picchu to reopen earlier than expected after storms|last=travel staff|first=Seattle Times|date=5 February 2010|publisher=The Seattle Times|accessdate=7 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Entrance restrictions===
[[File:Artifact collected on Bingham's 1912 expedition to Macchu Picchu.jpg|thumb|upright|Artifact collected on Bingham's 1912 expedition, on display at the Museo Machu Picchu]]
In July 2011, the Dirección Regional de Cultura Cusco (DRC) introduced new entrance rules to the citadel of Machu Picchu.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theonlyperuguide.com/2011/12/machu-picchu-new-entrance-rules/ "Machu Picchu New Entrance Rules"], ''[http://theonlyperuguide.com/ Peru Guide (the only)]''. 18 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The tougher entrance rules attempted to reduce the effect of tourism. The entrance was limited to 2,500 visitors per day, and the entrance to Huayna Picchu (within the citadel) was further restricted to 400 visitors per day.

In May 2012, a team of [[UNESCO]] conservation experts called upon Peruvian authorities to take "emergency measures" to further stabilize the site's buffer zone and protect it from damage, particularly in the nearby town of [[Aguas Calientes, Peru|Aguas Calientes]], which had grown rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://globalheritagefund.org/onthewire/blog/emergency_measures_to_protect_machu_picchu |title=GHF |publisher=Global Heritage Fund |date=2012-06-08 |accessdate=2013-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312211652/http://globalheritagefund.org/onthewire/blog/emergency_measures_to_protect_machu_picchu |archivedate=12 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural artifacts: Dispute between Peru and Yale University===

[[File:Silver tupus collected on Bingham's 1912 expedition to Macchu Picchu.jpg|thumb|Silver tupus collected on Bingham's 1912 expedition, on display at the Museo Macchu Picchu]]
In 1912, 1914 and 1915, Bingham removed thousands of artifacts from Machu Picchu—ceramic vessels, silver statues, jewelry and human bones—and took them to Yale University for further study, supposedly for 18 months. Yale instead kept the artifacts until 2012, arguing that Peru lacked the infrastructure and systems to care for them. [[Eliane Karp]], an anthropologist and wife of former Peruvian President [[Alejandro Toledo]], accused Yale of profiting from Peru's cultural heritage. Many of the articles were exhibited at Yale's [[Peabody Museum of Natural History|Peabody Museum]].

In 2006, Yale returned some pieces but kept the rest, claiming this was supported by federal case law of Peruvian antiquities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Kim |last=Martineau |date=14 March 2006 |title=Peru Presses Yale on Relics |url=http://articles.courant.com/2006-03-14/news/0603140780_1_machu-picchu-peru-s-first-lady-peru-s-cultural-heritage |work=[[Hartford Courant]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Peru and Yale had agreed on a joint traveling exhibition and construction of a new museum and research center in Cusco advised by Yale. Yale acknowledged Peru's title to all the objects, but would share rights with Peru in the research collection, part of which would remain at Yale for continuing study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Edmund H. |last=Mahony |date=16 September 2007 |title=Yale To Return Incan Artifacts |url=http://articles.courant.com/2007-09-16/news/0709160648_1_machu-picchu-peru-yale-history |work=[[Hartford Courant]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 November 2010, Yale agreed to return the disputed artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/americas/11/20/peru.yale.artifacts/index.html?hpt=T2|title=CNN: "Peru's president: Yale agrees to return Incan artifacts" | date=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third and final batch of artifacts was delivered November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zorthian|first=Julia|title=Yale returns final Machu Picchu artifacts|url=http://yaledailynews.com/crosscampus/2012/11/12/yale-returns-final-machu-picchu-artifacts/|work=Yale Daily News|publisher=Yale University|accessdate=24 Feb 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artifacts are permanently exhibited at the Museo Machu Picchu, La Casa Concha ("The Shell House"), close to Cusco's colonial center. Owned by the National University of San Antonio Abad del Cusco, La Casa Concha also features a study area for local and foreign students.

==In media==
;Motion pictures
The [[Paramount Pictures]] film ''[[Secret of the Incas]]'' (1955), with [[Charlton Heston]] and [[Yma Sumac|Ima Sumac]], was filmed on location at Cusco and Machu Picchu, the first time that a major Hollywood studio filmed on site. Five hundred [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous people]] were hired as extras in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=89450&amp;category=Notes|title= Production Notes – ''Secret of the Incas''|website=TCM Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opening sequence of the film ''[[Aguirre, the Wrath of God]]'' (1972) was shot in the Machu Picchu area and on the stone stairway of [[Huayna Picchu]].{{sfn|Herzog|2002}}

Machu Picchu was featured prominently in the film ''[[The Motorcycle Diaries (film)|The Motorcycle Diaries]]'' (2004), a [[biopic]] based on the 1952 youthful travel [[The Motorcycle Diaries (book)|memoir]] of [[Marxist]] revolutionary [[Che Guevara]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch_popup?v=aO4G2cRvUjQ&amp;vq=medium Excerpted Clip of Machu Picchu from the film ''The Motorcycle Diaries''] directed by [[Walter Salles]], distributed by [[Focus Features]], 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Nova (TV series)|NOVA]]'' television documentary "Ghosts of Machu Picchu" presents an elaborate documentary on the mysteries of Machu Picchu.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|1576769|Ghosts of Machu Picchu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary multimedia artist [[Kimsooja]] used Macchu Picchu as the primary setting for the first episode of her film series ''[[Thread Routes]]'', shot in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://broadstrokes.org/2014/09/09/artist-spotlight-kimsoojas-threads-of-culture-and-landscape/|title=Artist Spotlight: Kimsooja's Threads of Culture|last=Womeninthearts|date=9 September 2014|website=Broadstrokes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nearctic''' is one of the eight [[biogeographic realm]]s constituting the Earth's land surface.

[[Image:Ecozone Nearctic.svg|thumb|400px|The Nearctic realm]]
The Nearctic realm covers most of [[North America]], including [[Greenland]], [[Central Florida]], and the highlands of [[Mexico]]. The parts of North America that are not in the Nearctic realm are Eastern Mexico, [[Southern Florida]], coastal [[Central Florida]], [[Central America]], and the [[Caribbean]] islands which are part of the [[Neotropical realm]], together with [[South America]].

The [[World Wildlife Fund]] (WWF) divides the Nearctic into four '''[[bioregions]]''', defined as "geographic clusters of ecoregions that may span several habitat types, but have strong biogeographic affinities, particularly at taxonomic levels higher than the species level (genus, family)."

===Canadian Shield===
The [[Canadian Shield]] bioregion extends across the northern portion of the continent, from the [[Aleutian Islands]] to [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]. It includes the Nearctic's [[Arctic Tundra]] and [[Boreal forest]] ecoregions.

In terms of [[floristic province]]s, it is represented by part of the Canadian Province of the [[Circumboreal Region]].

===Eastern North America===

The Eastern North America bioregion includes the [[temperate broadleaf and mixed forests]] of the Eastern United States and southeastern Canada, the [[Great Plains]] [[temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands|temperate grasslands]] of the Central United States and south-central Canada, the [[temperate coniferous forests]] of the Southeastern United States, including [[Central Florida]]. In terms of [[floristic province]]s, it is represented by the [[North American Atlantic Region]] and part of the Canadian Province of the [[Circumboreal Region]].

===Western North America===
The Western North America bioregion includes the [[temperate coniferous forests]] of the coastal and mountain regions of southern Alaska, western Canada, and the Western United States from the [[West Coast of the United States|Pacific Coast]] and [[Northern California]] to the [[Rocky Mountains]], as well as the cold-winter intermountain [[deserts and xeric shrublands]] and temperate grasslands and shrublands of the [[Western United States]].

In terms of [[floristic province]]s, it is represented by the [[Rocky Mountain region]].

===Northern Mexico and Southwestern North America===
The Northern Mexico bioregion includes the mild-winter to cold-winter deserts and xeric shrublands of northern Mexico, Southern [[California]], and the [[Southwestern United States]], including the [[Chihuahuan Desert|Chihuahuan]], [[Sonoran Desert|Sonoran]], and [[Mojave Desert|Mojave]] Deserts. The [[Mediterranean climate]] [[ecoregion]]s of the [[Southern California|Southern]] and [[Central Coast (California)|Central Coast of California]] include the [[California chaparral and woodlands]], [[California coastal sage and chaparral ecoregion|California coastal sage and chaparral]], [[California interior chaparral and woodlands]], and [[California montane chaparral and woodlands]].

The bioregion also includes the warm temperate and subtropical pine and pine-oak forests, including the [[Arizona Mountains forests]] and the [[Sierra Madre Occidental pine-oak forests|Sierra Madre Occidental]], [[Sierra Madre Oriental pine-oak forests|Sierra Madre Oriental]], and [[Sierra Juarez and San Pedro Martir pine-oak forests|Sierra Juarez and San Pedro Martir]] pine-oak forests.

In terms of [[floristic province]]s, it is represented by the [[Madrean Region]].

==History==
Although North America and South America are presently joined by the [[Isthmus of Panama]], these continents were separated for about 180 million years, and evolved very different plant and animal lineages. When the ancient supercontinent of [[Pangaea]] split into two about 180 million years ago, North America remained joined to [[Eurasia]] as part of the supercontinent of [[Laurasia]], while South America was part of the supercontinent of [[Gondwana]]. North America later split from Eurasia. North America has been joined by land bridges to both [[Asia]] and South America since then, which allowed an exchange of plant and animal [[species]] between the continents, the [[Great American Interchange]].

A former land bridge across the [[Bering Strait]] between Asia and North America allowed many plants and animals to move between these continents, and the Nearctic realm shares many plants and animals with the [[Palearctic]]. The two realms are sometimes included in a single '''[[Holarctic]]''' realm.

Many large animals, or [[megafauna]], including [[horse]]s, [[camel]]s, [[mammoth]]s, [[mastodont]]s, [[ground sloth]]s, sabre-tooth cats (''[[Smilodon]]''), the giant short-faced [[bear]] (''[[Arctodus simus]]''), and the [[cheetah]], became extinct in North America at the end of the [[Pleistocene]] epoch (ice ages), at the same time the first evidence of humans appeared, in what is called the [[Holocene extinction event]]. Previously, the megafaunal extinctions were believed to have been caused by the changing climate, but many scientists now believe, while the climate change contributed to these extinctions, the primary cause was hunting by newly arrived humans or, in the case of some large predators, extinction resulting from prey becoming scarce. The [[American bison]] (''Bison bison''), [[brown bear]] or grizzly bear (''Ursus arctos''), [[moose]] or Eurasian elk (''Alces alces''), and [[elk]] or wapiti (''Cervus canadensis'') entered North America around the same time as the first humans, and expanded rapidly, filling ecological niches left empty by the newly extinct North American megafauna.

==Flora and fauna==

===Flora and fauna that originated in the Nearctic===
Animals originally unique to the Nearctic include:
*Family [[Canidae]], [[dog]]s, [[Wolf|wolves]], [[fox]]es, and [[coyote]]s 
*Family [[Camelidae]], [[camel]]s and their South American relatives including the [[llama]]. now extinct in the Nearctic
*Family [[Equidae]], [[horse]]s, [[donkey]]s and their relatives. now only found in the Nearctic as feral horses
*Family [[Tapiridae]], [[tapir]]s now extinct in the Nearctic
*Family [[Antilocapridae]], last survivor of which is the [[pronghorn]]
*Subfamily [[Tremarctinae]], or short-faced, [[bear]]s, including the giant short-faced bear (''Arctodus simius'')   One other member of the group is the [[spectacled bear]] (''Tremarctos ornatus'') of South America.  now extinct in the Nearctic
*The [[American cheetah]] (''Miracinonyx'') now extinct worldwide

===Flora and fauna endemic to the Nearctic===
One [[bird]] family, the [[wrentit]]s (Timaliinae), is endemic to the Nearctic region. The Holarctic has four endemic families: [[Loon|divers]] (Gaviidae), [[grouse]] (Tetraoninae), [[auk]]s (Alcidae), and the [[waxwing]]s (Bombycillidae). The scarab beetle families [[Pleocomidae]] and [[Diphyllostomatidae]] ([[Coleoptera]]) are also endemic to the Nearctic. The fly species ''[[Cynomya cadaverina]]'' is also found in high numbers in this area.

Plants families endemic or nearly endemic to the Nearctic include the  [[Crossosomataceae]], [[Simmondsiaceae]], and [[Limnanthaceae]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9311">'''Pay as you throw''' (PAYT) (also called trash metering, unit pricing, variable rate pricing, or user-pay) is a usage-pricing model for disposing of [[municipal solid waste]]. Users are charged a rate based on how much waste they present for collection to the municipality or local authority.

A variety of models exist depending on the region and municipality. Waste is measured by weight or size while units are identified using different types of bags, tags, containers or even [[Radio-frequency identification|RFID]]. Services for waste diversion, like [[recycling]] and [[composting]], are often provided free of charge where pay-as-you-throw systems are implemented.&lt;ref name="Batllevell"&gt;Batllevell, Marta and Kenneth Hanf. “The fairness of PAYT systems: Some guidelines for decision-makers.” Waste Management 28 (2008): 2793-2800.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three main types of pay-as-you-throw programmes:
- Full-unit pricing: users pay for all the garbage they want collected in advance by purchasing a tag, custom bag, or selected size container.
- Partial-unit pricing: the local authority or municipality decides on a maximum number of bags or containers of garbage, with collection paid for by taxes. Additional bags or containers are available for purchase should the user exceed the permitted amount
- Variable-rate pricing: users can choose to rent a container of varying sizes (some programs offer up to five), with the price corresponding to the amount of waste generated.&lt;ref name="Kelleher"&gt;Kelleher, Maria, et al. “Taking out the Trash: How to Allocate the Costs Fairly.” C.D. Howe Institute Commentary 213 (2005): 1-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale==
The two most traditional approaches to disposing of municipal solid waste are a flat-rate system or municipal taxes. All users pay the same municipal taxes regardless of how much waste they present for pickup.&lt;ref name="Bilitewski"&gt;Bilitewski, Bernd. “Pay-as-you-throw – A tool for urban waste management.” Editorial. Waste Management 28 (2008): 2759.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the flat-rate system there is no incentive to reduce waste produced.&lt;ref name="Reichenbach"&gt;Reichenbach, Jan. “Status and prospects of pay-as-you-throw in Europe – A review of pilot research and implementation studies.” Waste Management 28 (2008): 2809-2814.&lt;/ref&gt;

PAYT is based on two guiding principles of environmental policy: the [[polluter pays principle]] and the [[shared responsibility]] concept.&lt;ref name="Batllevell" /&gt; The rationale for PAYT can be divided into three broad categories:

===Economic===
Under a PAYT scheme, some or all of the costs of waste management can be removed from property tax bills, providing more independence in the management and financial of residential waste system.&lt;ref name="Kelleher" /&gt;  Waste management services are then treated just like other utilities such as electricity or water that are charged by unit of consumption.&lt;ref name="Bilitewski" /&gt;

===Environmental===
PAYT program are an effective tool in increasing waste separation and recycling, and also encourage waste minimization. The result is significant energy savings from transportation, increases in material recovery from recycling, and reduction in pollution from landfills and incinerators. And thus reduce the load of landfills.&lt;ref name="Bilitewski" /&gt; PAYT programs also indirectly encourage producers to develop more efficient designs and environmentally friendly product life cycles.&lt;ref name="Kelleher" /&gt;

===Social===
Waste collections costs are distributed more fairly among the population, and in proportion to the amount of waste each user generates.&lt;ref name="Kelleher" /&gt; Free riders are no longer able to have their behavior subsidized, and PAYT is said to promote community sustainability.  Lower-income families tend to produce less waste and thus pay lower waste collection fees.&lt;ref name="Batllevell" /&gt;

==Diversion effects and risks==
Charging for waste can also sometimes result in illegal dumping ([[fly-tipping]]) or the waste being passed to unlicensed or illegal disposal methods.&lt;ref name="Batllevell" /&gt;  In practice, increased litter, open burning, and illegal dumping have not been observed by most pay-as-you-throw communities, especially when combined with easier recycling and composting.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scdhec.gov/library/OR-0608.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="massdep"&gt;http://www.mass.gov/eea/agencies/massdep/recycle/reduce/pay-as-you-throw-basics-for-municipalities.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Municipalities in Massachusetts have typically observed a reduction in trash larger than the increase in recycling, but this is believed to be due to people formerly bringing in trash from other communities (where presumably there is no free pickup) to the homes of friends and relatives.&lt;ref&gt;http://radioboston.wbur.org/2011/04/12/mass-recycling-program&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political opposition==
When there is a change to any established municipal service, public resistance is common.&lt;ref name="Kelleher"/&gt;  The Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection recommends making PAYT programs revenue-neutral by reducing taxes at the same time as introducing trash fees, so residents don't see the trash fee as a new cost.&lt;ref name="massdep"/&gt;

==Implementation==
Urban communities usually offer curbside collection while rural communities provide drop-off collection service.&lt;ref name="Kelleher" /&gt; Both the European Union and the US Environmental Protection Agency have published handbooks for introducing PAYT.&lt;ref name="Sakai"&gt;Sakai, S., et al. “Unit-charging programs for municipal solid waste in Japan.”  Waste Management 28 (2008): 2815-2825.&lt;/ref&gt;

===North America===
PAYT programs operated in California, Michigan, New York and Washington as early as the 1970s, although The City of San Francisco “had practiced a kind of PAYT scheme since 1932.” &lt;ref name ="Reichenbach" /&gt; By 2000, 6,000 communities in the U.S. (20%) and 200 in Canada had implemented user fees for waste management.&lt;ref name="Kelleher" /&gt;  In 2002 North Americans disposed of 24 million tonnes of waste, with residential sources accounting for 9.5 million tonnes.&lt;ref name="Kelleher" /&gt; PAYT programs resulted in residential waste declining from 9 - 38% and increased recycling from 6 – 40%.&lt;ref name="Kelleher" /&gt;

===Europe===
{{See also|Waste management in Switzerland}}

Austria was the first country to implement individual waste charging in 1945, but PAYT did not catch on until the 1980s when efficient and secure electronic identification systems became available.&lt;ref name="Reichenbach"/&gt; The first city in Europe to implement an electronic identification and billing system for waste charges was Dresden, Germany.&lt;ref name= "Bilitewski"/&gt; The first experience in Spain was in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Puig Ventosa, I. "Charging systems and PAYT experiences for waste management in Spain". Waste Management 2008, 28, 2767–2771&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1991, the European Waste Policy has required that “part of the costs not covered by revenues from material reuse must be recovered on the polluter-pays principle.” Versions of PAYT are present in municipalities all over Europe.&lt;ref name="Reichenbach"/&gt;

===Asia===
After being introduced in the 1970s, 954 municipalities (30%) in Japan have implemented PAYT programs.&lt;ref name="Sakai" /&gt; The city of [[Taipei]] currently runs a scheme where households and companies purchase specially printed blue bin bags, and place waste in it. The municipal waste management department collects only rubbish placed within these special bags. Called the "Per Bag Trash Collection Fee", this scheme encourages usage of recyclable packaging, as those do not need a special bag and are disposed free of charge. As a result, Taipei's waste volume is down 35.08%, and recycling has increased 2.6-fold from 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/29/AR2007112901887.html What I Picked Up About Trash in Taipei - washingtonpost.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; PAYT is also implemented in Korea, Thailand, Vietnam, China, and Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;Hong, Seonghoon. “The Effects of unit pricing system upon household solid waste management: The Korean Experience.” The Journal of Environmental Management 57 1999): 1-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

PAYT pricing has also been recently introduced in parts of Bangalore through the wastepicker cooperative Hasiru Dala, founded by [[Nalini Shekar]]. The organization followed the 2-bin 1-bag&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.2bin1bag.in/|title=2Bin1Bag - Divide &amp; Conquer Waste|website=2Bin1Bag - Divide &amp;amp; Conquer Waste|language=en|access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; segregation method, and charged differently for compost-able waste and landfill rejects, while paying for recyclables. Apartments serviced through this pricing mechanism showed a significant reduction in their garbage footprint.

It was proposed as a model for the 
[[shape of the universe]] in 2004.&lt;ref name="Aurich0403597" /&gt; The term "horn" is due to [[pseudosphere]] models of hyperbolic space.

== Geometry and topology ==
A modern description, in terms of fundamental domain and identifications, can be found in section 3.2, page 63 of Grunewald and Huntebrinker, along with the first 80 eigenvalues of the [[Laplacian]], tabulated on page 72, where &lt;math&gt;\Upsilon_1&lt;/math&gt; is a fundamental domain of the Picard space.&lt;ref name="GrunHunte"&gt;Fritz Grunewald and Wolfgang Huntebrinker, ''[http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.em/1047591148 A numerical study of eigenvalues of the hyperbolic Laplacian for polyhedra with one cusp]'', Experiment. Math. Volume 5, Issue 1 (1996), 57-80&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cosmology ==
The term was coined in 2004 by Ralf Aurich, Sven Lustig, Frank Steiner, and Holger Then in their paper ''Hyperbolic Universes with a Horned Topology and the CMB Anisotropy''.&lt;ref name="Aurich0403597"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Aurich |first= Ralf |author2=Lustig, S. |author3=Steiner, F. |author4=Then, H.  |title= Hyperbolic Universes with a Horned Topology and the CMB Anisotropy |journal= [[Classical and Quantum Gravity]] |volume=21 |pages=4901–4926|publisher= [[Institute of Physics]] |date=2004 |url= http://iopscience.iop.org/0264-9381/21/21/010/ |doi= 10.1088/0264-9381/21/21/010 |accessdate=2011-08-24 |archiveurl= http://arXiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0403597 |archivedate=2004-10-14 |arxiv = astro-ph/0403597 |bibcode = 2004CQGra..21.4901A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model was chosen in an attempt to describe the [[microwave background radiation]] apparent in the universe, and has finite [[volume]] and useful spectral characteristics (the first several eigenvalues of the Laplacian are computed and in good accord with observation). In this model one end of the figure curves [[wiktionary:finite|finitely]] into the bell of the horn. The curve along any side of horn is considered to be a [[hyperbola|negative curve]]. The other end extends to infinity.&lt;ref name="Register2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NSci2004" /&gt;

''' Political psychological rationalization''' ('''PPR''') is a phenomenon seen in [[political warfare]] and election campaign [[rhetoric]], meant to displace a perceived fault, short coming, mistake, or problem from one political actor, and attach it to another political actor, generally an opponent.  While not truly [[rationalization (psychology)|rationalization]] in the context of psychology—where a problem, short coming, mistake, or fault is justified and allowed to endure—PPR maintains the negative connotation of the original flaw, transfers that connotation to a target actor, and then seeks to destroy the flaw (and consequently the actor) through association with said flaw, but with a political purpose and focus.  Political psychological rationalization exploits a number of psychological principles to manipulate the perceptions of different actors including [[groupthink]], [[cognitive dissonance]], and other forms of [[psychological manipulation]].  An example of PPR would be "Candidate A" accusing "Candidate B" of having an onerous tax policy for not cutting taxes while Candidate A had already raised taxes previously in his or her career, but having accused Candidate B of having an onerous tax policy is seen as being in favor of cutting taxes.  Use of PPR can also run the risk of backfiring against the broadcaster if knowledge of hypocritical behavior on the part of the displacing political actor becomes known.  In cases where this has happened, the original negative association can become reoriented back to the initiating political actor.  As tool of political warfare, PPR has been used by a wide array of factions, ideologies, actors, and regimes including fascists, communists, religious extremists, electoral campaign rhetoric, and non-governmental organizations.

==Psychological influences==

As a tool of [[political warfare]], PPR utilizes a number of [[psychological]] and [[sociological]] concepts,  particularly the construct of [[Rationalization (psychology)|rationalization]].  In psychology, rationalization is defined by the DSM-IV as when "the individual deals with emotional conflict or internal or external stressors by concealing the true motivations for his or her own thoughts, actions, or feelings through the elaboration of reassuring or self serving but incorrect explanations."&lt;ref&gt;Association, published by the American Psychiatric (2000). DSM-IV-TR : diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (4TH ED. ed.). United States: AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC PRESS INC (DC). p. 812. {{ISBN|978-0-89042-025-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Succinctly, this means that people will act in a way that coincides with their thoughts.  If people conduct an action that goes outside their beliefs, then the mindset of the action or belief must change to create an internal balance (or rationalization).  Claude Steele famously stated that rationalization is a defense mechanism developed to protect the self from dissenting opinions or decisions, thereby reaffirming an individual's own beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Steele, C. M. (1988). The psychology of self-affirmation: Sustaining the integrity of the self. In Advances in experimental social psychology (Vol. 21, pp. 261-302). Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This assertion for one's actions or beliefs is also known as [[self-affirmation]].  Steele  suggests that through self-affirmation, one's actions and beliefs maintain a mental balance. Current research on self-affirmation strengthens this view especially when seeing how people interact with people of similar actions or beliefs. When accompanied in a group setting, people can fall into a group-minded train of thinking called [[groupthink]]. In a political context, groupthink can lead to people believing their viewpoints or political beliefs are rational and normal, when really these viewpoints are isolated to the group.

In theory, a political actor using PPR could exploit the phenomenon of groupthink if the group idea has unfounded credibility due to many members of a adhering to the idea in a desire to maintain cohesion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Groupthink|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/groupthink|work=Definition Groupthink|publisher=Merriam-Webster.com|accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;to rationalize a particular political position.  A common example is [[social media]].  If one's social media network consists of people with only similar opinions, then one will believe that their belief is rational and common.  Importantly, they will also be less likely to take dissenting viewpoints seriously, thus feeding the cycle of groupthink.&lt;ref&gt;Majchrzak, A., Faraj, S., Kane, G. C., &amp; Azad, B. (2013). The contradictory influence of social media affordances on online communal knowledge sharing. Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 19(1), 38-55.&lt;/ref&gt;  

In some cases, PPR might also be a [[defense mechanism]] against being branded with a negative image by an opponent through active exploitation of [[cognitive dissonance]], creating alternative messages to rationalize a real or perceived inconsistency in policy or a previous attack by an opponent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cherry|first=Kendra|title=What is Cognitive Dissonance|url=http://psychology.about.com/od/cognitivepsychology/f/dissonance.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to the highly subjective nature of both broadcaster and target audience perceptions, it is difficult to definitively label a particular messaging campaign as being an example of PPR.  

===Contributing theories===

Groupthink refers to a state of mind when a group of people overlook their personal decisions and motivations in order to maintain the relationship of the in-group.&lt;ref&gt;Janis, I. L. (1971). Groupthink. Psychology today, 5(6), 43-46.&lt;/ref&gt; Using groupthink, individuals are at  risk of influence from others.  This could result in the individual agreeing with unfounded ideas or credibility because many members of a particular group adhere to it in a desire to maintain cohesion. Janis also found that intelligence did not factor into the likelihood for groupthink; however, agreeableness and self-identification were strong factors. An example of groupthink exists within sociopolitical research across academia.  In their famous review, Inbar and Lammers found a bias of research favoring or utilizing liberal participants over conservative.&lt;ref&gt;Inbar, Y., &amp; Lammers, J. (2012). Political diversity in social and personality psychology. Perspectives on Psychological Science, 7(5), 496-503.&lt;/ref&gt; They suggest that this groupthink towards liberal participants may be affecting sociological, psychological, and political research that is being generalized to the overall population.  This finding suggests that people across various domains and intelligence are susceptible to groupthink.   

===Psychological constructs===

[[Cognitive dissonance]] also plays a strong roll in how the self rationalizes a real or perceived inconsistency with the self's beliefs.  When an individual acts in a manner that does not match their internal beliefs, there is a mental conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Festinger, L. (1962). A theory of cognitive dissonance (Vol. 2). Stanford university press.&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to override this dissonance, the person must either change the behavior, or change their beliefs.  As seen with groupthink, individuals adapt their behavior in order to maintain status-quo with the group.  In a political setting, this could be incredibly dangerous.

In their 2013 literature review, Lodge and Taber looked at the components of a rationalizing voter.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, M. &amp; Taber, C. (2007). The Rationalizing Voter: Unconscious Thought in Political Information Processing. SSRN Electronic Journal. doi: 10.2139/ssrn.1077972.&lt;/ref&gt;  Their review touched on the psychological constructs of [[automaticity]], [[affect (psychology)|affect]], [[long-term memory]], and [[cognitive bias]].  They argue that voters utilize their beliefs and attitudes to construct heuristics to make judgments about political decisions.  When creating these heuristics and recalling memories, voters utilize long-term memory to construct a cohesive picture that mirrors what they believe to match their political beliefs. This is important when considering voters in the booth trying to recall what they know about the campaigning candidates.  Utilizing heuristics, voters will recall items that are the most salient within memory.  This ability to recall items can be impacted by the [[availability heuristic]] and [[representative heuristic]].

==Use in American electoral campaign rhetoric==
[[File:Commercial-LBJ1964ElectionAdDaisyGirl.ogv|thumb|250px|thumbtime=3|"Daisy" advertisement]]
One of the most controversial examples of PPR in American electoral [[rhetoric]] is President [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s use of the [[Daisy (advertisement)|Daisy]] ad against Senator [[Barry Goldwater]] in the 1964 presidential campaign, which was used to create an image of his opponent as belligerent and [[reactionary]] in foreign affairs.  The ad depicted a small girl counting the petals on a daisy.  The camera slowly zooms in on the girl while the counting by the girl is replaced by a loudspeaker counting down to zero, at which point the picture changes from the girl counting petals to a nuclear explosion.  Johnson's voice is then overheard saying,

"These are the stakes – to make a world in which all of God's children can live, or to go into the dark. We must either love each other, or we must die."&lt;ref&gt;"Transcript of 'Peace, Little Girl' 1964 Democratic Campaign". Copy from LBJ Library via CONELRAD. http://conelrad.com/daisy/documents.php.  1964. Retrieved 22 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ad also urged people to vote for President Johnson.  While no intended target of the ad was ever specified, the implication was that if one voted against Johnson, they would be voting for [[nuclear war]].  The ad was only ever aired once due to intense negative reaction from the public, but the association with nuclear war followed Senator Goldwater for the rest of the election.&lt;ref&gt;"Correspondence regarding The Daisy Ad from Senator Everett M. Dirksen." Copy from LBJ library via CONELRAD. http://conelrad.com/daisy/documents.php. 12 September 1964. Retrieved 22 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  President Johnson by default became associated with moderation and peace, even though he had endorsed the [[domino theory]] as John F. Kennedy's vice-president in 1961, creating a predisposition to expanding the Vietnam War in 1965 after the [[Gulf of Tonkin]] incident.

==Use during the Cold War==
A protracted political warfare campaign was waged between the [[Soviet Union]] and the United States during the [[Cold War]], in which both sides made extensive use of PPR. It consisted of the multiple accusations of government officials from the Communist Bloc and the West. In particular, the PPR was objectified in the struggle of each side to justify its political shortcomings by vilifying the ideology of the opponent. The ban of Western media and Western culture in the Soviet countries was an attempt by Kremlin to limit any potential for growing Western influence in these societies. Moreover, communist states were becoming more eager for the culture of consumerism and the access to the goods and services available in capitalist societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Bren|editor1-first=Paulina|editor2-last=Neuburger|editor2-first=Mary|title=Communism unwrapped: Consumption in cold war Eastern Europe|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to frame the censorship into a positive context and to rationalize the it,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gulyás|first1=Ágnes|title=Communist media economics and the consumers: The case of the print media of East Central Europe|journal=International Journal of Media Management|date=2001|volume=3|issue=2|page=74-81}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Soviet regime was openly opposing Western culture with the argument that it was a source of the detrimental bourgeois influence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Poiger|first1=Uta|title=Jazz, rock, and rebels: Cold War politics and American culture in a divided Germany|date=2000|publisher=University of California Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; threatening the values of the communist society. The official and unofficial state measures undertaken against the Western culture were portrayed by the Soviet regime as a mechanism for protection of the population against the low morality of the decadent capitalistic society. Some acts of the modern Russian leadership also point to the same tendency even after the end of the Cold War. Namely, the Orthodox Christian community is the institution supposed to provide a protection from the 'Western philosophy of drugs, egotism and moral relativism'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van Herpen|first1=Marcel|title=Putin's propaganda machine: Soft power and russian foreign policy|date=2015|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As for the PPR on American side, some examples are also present. Between 1946 to 1956, there was a censorship campaign against schools and libraries in an effort to remove literature, described as 'radical'. The political move was explained through the danger that such literature was posing to the American democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mediavilla|first1=Cindy|title=The war on books and ideas: The California Library Association and anti-communist censorship in the 1940s and 1950s|journal=Library Trends|date=1997|volume=46|issue=2|pages=331-347}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 1950s the members of the Communist party and supporters of their ideas were persecuted and faced hostilities and rejection both by the side of the government and the society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=L. Sullivan|first1=John|last2=Piereson|first2=James|last3=E. Marcus|first3=George|title=Sullivan, J. L., Piereson, J., &amp; Marcus, G. E. (1993). Political tolerance and American democracy|date=1993|publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The anti-Soviet sentiment in America during the first half of the Cold War was measured to be greater than in European countries that were directly facing the consequences of the communist ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wald|first1=Kenneth|title=The Religious Dimension of American Anti-Communism|journal=Journal of Church and State|date=1994|volume=36|issue=3|page=483-506}}&lt;/ref&gt; The anti-Soviet campaign that led to the ban of many literary works during the Cold War entailed similar consequences for the modern art, described as an outlet of communist influence as well. Prominent artists that were allegedly having ties to communist supporters and thus presumably sharing sentiments to Communism suffered significant consequences as a result of their affiliation. The U.S. authorities decided for works of such artists that "no matter how innocuous the subject matter, be banned from publicly supported arts institutions and most especially from federally sponsored cultural exchange"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Hart Mathews|first1=Jane|title=Art and Politics in Cold War America|journal=The American Historical Review|date=1976|volume=81|issue=4|page=762-787}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This political move was intended to portray America as a non-materialist society that deeply cares for the culture and the arts and is ready to exchange ideas with other countries that share the same values. The American Cold War culture enjoyed much more independence than the artists in the East due to the numerous checks that the works had to go through in order to ensure compliance with the goals of the state policies. At the same time, the literature and the arts in the U.S. were still influenced to a large extent by the ideological war between capitalism and communism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tony|first1=Shaw|title=The Politics of Cold War Culture|journal=Journal of Cold War Studies|date=2001|volume=3|issue=3|page=59-76}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Critical theorists in International Relations see the period of the Cold War as a time-frame of intensive building and confirmation of the state's identity. It is achieved through the construction of an "enemy" in the eyes of the public while at the same time a real material threat was not present to an extent to which the undertaken measures would be justified by concrete facts about the strategic interests of the U.S. or its security&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=David|title=Writing security: United States foreign policy and the politics of identity|date=1992|publisher=University of Minnesota Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Another example of the American use of PPR during the [[Cold War]] is the fallacy of the "[[missile gap]]".  Claims that the Soviet Union was outpacing the United States in production numbers of [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s (ICBMs) and would soon be at a disadvantage, surfaced during the late 1950s&lt;ref&gt;Central Intelligence Agency.  "Memorandum to Holders of NIE 11-5-58".  25 November 1958. Retrieved 23 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and had peaked by the election of 1960.  Although it had been disproven by the intelligence community, political elites continued to use the missile gap for their own gains.  In this case however, the objective of PPR was not so much to demonize the Soviet Union (in fact, that had already been rhetorically established), but to create a perceived US deficiency to spur US action on the issue.  Since any evidence invalidating the missile gap theory was classified, no cognitive dissonance was required to defend the rationalization that the US needed more strategic weapons, and group think could be harnessed to keep the conversation centered on strategic weapons, as opposed to other fronts on which the US could be countering the Soviets.  The reality of this rationalization is that there was indeed a missile gap during this time period, but in favor of the United States.

==Examples in contemporary international relations==

The use of PPR has become prevalent in the [[public diplomacy]] campaigns of [[religious extremist]]s, particularly [[Islamic extremism|radical Islamist]] groups.  While rhetorically attacking the United States and its allies as being "crusaders" out to impose their ideals on the Muslim world, many groups claiming to resist that trend blame the state of the Muslim world immediately following the 9/11 terrorist attacks on a failure of the umma to resist as well, leaving only the jihadist groups left to carry on the struggle, like [[Al Qaeda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Scheuer|first=Michael|title=Al-Qaeda Doctrine: Training the Individual Warrior|url=http://www.jamestown.org/programs/gta/single/?tx_ttnews[tt_news]=719&amp;tx_ttnews[backPid]=239&amp;no_cache=1|work=Terrorism Focus Volume: 3 Issue: 12|publisher=The Jamestown Foundation|accessdate=23 April 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903120850/http://www.jamestown.org/programs/gta/single/?tx_ttnews|archivedate=3 September 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By claiming to resist a perceived invader, these groups can then associate themselves with an image of benevolence while demonizing the United States—despite committing many of the same excesses of which they accuse the United States, such as labeling other Muslims "infidels" who support the US, and imposing (theological) norms onto populations that do not necessarily share them.

Political psychological rationalization also continues to factor into modern public diplomacy efforts as a means to predispose target audiences to a message from a broadcasting actor.  Aspects of PPR can be seen in the current media campaign surrounding [[China's peaceful rise]], and how certain actions taken by the Chinese government are portrayed in both official statements and the larger news media.  A commonly repeated theme is that China's military modernization and expansion is a reflection of growth in the Chinese economy and presence abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=China's military rise: The Dragon's New Teeth|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21552193|accessdate=22 April 2012|newspaper=The Economist|date=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a rationalization in response to a perception that the expanding nature of the Chinese military will result in increased Chinese aggressiveness.  By using the term "peaceful rise" and seeking to portray the military expansion as part of a country's natural development, China is attempting to displace the fear (other countries) and perceived aggression (by China) and displace the negative implicated with its military growth and attach them to nations attempting to challenge China by creating the image that anyone who worries about China is merely paranoid or jealous of China's development.  In repeated use of this rationalization, China is conditioning observing parties to think that the "peaceful rise" is the norm, using group think to delegitimize opponents and cognitive dissonance to rebut any mention of inconsistencies in official messaging from the Chinese government.

==Climate change==
The program was to be subsidized by the Dutch Ministry of Environment during 2007-2009 "for the specific purpose of organizing a process of knowledge exchange, which is dedicated to the determination of the 50 most pressing policy-relevant research questions related to environmental and climate change issues in the coming years."&lt;ref name=accreditapp/&gt;{{rp|12}}

The program's large number of Ph.D. students was used in an unusual way in 2013.  They were called upon for use in rapid vetting of a draft climatic change report in a crowd-sourcing mode.  The process initially sought participation students pursuing Ph.Ds in the Netherlands, and ended up obtaining 40 of them plus 50 Ph.D. students from elsewhere.  The students were distributed across 30 teams including at least one Dutch student per team, and the Dutch students earned educational credits plus "blooper bonus" pay and other incentives.&lt;ref name=vetting/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22627">A musical line which is the reverse of a previously or simultaneously stated line is said to be its '''retrograde''' or '''cancrizans''' ("walking backward", medieval Latin, from ''cancer'', crab). An exact retrograde includes both the pitches and rhythms in reverse. An even more exact retrograde reverses the physical contour of the notes themselves, though this is possible only in [[electronic music]]. Some composers choose to subject just the pitches of a musical line to retrograde, or just the rhythms. In [[twelve-tone technique|twelve-tone music]], reversal of the [[pitch class]]es alone—regardless of the [[Pitch contour|melodic contour]] created by their [[Register (music)|registral placement]]—is regarded as a retrograde.

=== In treatises ===
Retrograde was not mentioned in theoretical treatises prior to 1500.&lt;ref name="Newes, p. 218"&gt;Newes, p.&amp;nbsp;218.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicola Vicentino]] (1555) discussed the difficulty in finding canonic imitation: "At times, the fugue or canon cannot be discovered through the systems mentioned above, either because of the impediment of rests, or because one part is going up while another is going down, or because one part starts at the beginning and the other at the end. In such cases a student can begin at the end and work back to the beginning in order to find where and in which voice he should begin the canons."&lt;ref name=vic&gt;Vicentino, p.&amp;nbsp;298.&lt;/ref&gt; Vicentino derided those who achieved purely intellectual pleasure from retrograde (and similar permutations): "A composer of such fancies must try to make canons and fugues that are pleasant and full of sweetness and harmony. He should not make a canon in the shape of a tower, a mountain, a river, a chessboard, or other objects, for these compositions create a loud noise in many voices, with little harmonic sweetness. To tell the truth, a listening is more likely to be induced to vexation than to delight by these disproportioned fancies, which are devoid of pleasant harmony and contrary to the goal of the imitation of the nature of the words."&lt;ref name=vic/&gt;

[[Thomas Morley]] (1597) described retrograde in the context of canons and mentions a work by Byrd.&lt;ref name=Morley&gt;Morley, pp.&amp;nbsp;288–89.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Wilhelm Marpurg]] (1754) notes various names for the procedure ''imitatio retrograda'' or ''cancrizans'' or ''per motum retrogradum'' and says it is used primarily in canons and fugues.&lt;ref&gt;Marpurg, pp.&amp;nbsp;148–49.{{Full|date=November 2011}}&lt;!--Source is in two volumes, paginated separately. In which volume is the citation?--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Some writers acknowledge that hearing retrograde in music is a challenge, and consider it a [[self-referential]] compositional device.&lt;ref&gt;Levarie and Levy, p.&amp;nbsp;242.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mazzola, Göller, and Müller, p.&amp;nbsp;15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The fact that listeners may not recognize the second phrase as a reversal of the  first does not defeat the idea: a mirror structure under time produces a possible, comprehensible result, not necessarily a recognizable transformation." Morgan, "Symmetrical Form", p.&amp;nbsp;26.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In music ===
[[File:Nusmido - folio 150 verso of Pluteo 29.1 in the Laurentian Library in Florence.jpg|thumb|Nusmido, folio 150 verso of manuscript [[Pluteo 29.1]], located in the [[Laurentian Library]] in Florence - the earliest known example of retrograde in music]]
Despite not being mentioned in theoretical treatises prior to 1500, compositions written before that date show retrograde.&lt;ref name="Newes, p. 218"/&gt; According to Willi Apel, the earliest example of retrograde in music is the 13th century [[Clausula (music)|clausula]], ''Nusmido'', in which the [[tenor]] has the liturgical melody "Dominus" in retrograde (found in the manuscript [[Pluteo 29.1]], folio 150 verso, located in the [[Laurentian Library]] in Florence).&lt;ref&gt;Apel, p.&amp;nbsp;728. Todd and Newes accept Apel's identification of Nusmido as the earliest work found containing a retrograde passage.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Many citations to early examples of retrograde and other [[permutation (music)|permutations]] and their literature can be found in Todd pp.&amp;nbsp;71–76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newes, p.&amp;nbsp;218. Newes transcribes the excerpt.&lt;/ref&gt; (The word "Nusmido" is a syllabic retrograde of the word "Dominus.")&lt;ref name=buk&gt;Bukofzer, p.&amp;nbsp;176. Bukofzer believes the existence of this retrograde is based on intellectual satisfaction.&lt;/ref&gt;

Surveying medieval examples of retrograde, Virginia Newes notes that early composers were often also poets, and that musical retrogrades could have been based on similarly constructed poetic texts.&lt;ref&gt;Newes, p.&amp;nbsp;233.&lt;/ref&gt; She quotes Daniel Poirion in suggesting that the retrograde canon in Machaut's three-voice rondeau, "Ma Fin est mon Commencement" could symbolize a metaphysical view of death as rebirth, or else the ideal circle of the courtly outlook, which encloses all initiatives and all ends.&lt;ref&gt;Poirion, p.&amp;nbsp;322.&lt;/ref&gt; She concludes that, whatever the reasons, construction of retrogrades and their transmission were part of the medieval composers' world, as they prized symmetry and balance as intellectual feats in addition to the aural experience. &lt;ref&gt;Newes, pp.&amp;nbsp;218, 234.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Machaut opening and closing bars of 'Ma fin...'.png|thumb|center|500px|Machaut, the opening and closing bars of 'ma fin est mon commencement' (My end is my beginning.) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcfPr4IN2MM Listen]]]

Todd notes that although some composers ([[John Dunstaple]], [[Guillaume Dufay]] and [[Johannes Ockeghem]]) used retrograde occasionally, they did not combine it with other [[permutation (music)|permutations]]. In contradistinction, [[Antoine Busnois]] and [[Jacob Obrecht]], used retrograde and other permutations extensively, suggesting familiarity with one another's compositional techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, p.&amp;nbsp;55.&lt;/ref&gt; Todd also notes that, by use of retrograde, inversion, and retrograde-inversion, composers of this time viewed music in a way similar to serialists of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, pp.&amp;nbsp;69–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as [[Edmund Rubbra|Edmund]] {{harvtxt|Rubbra|1960|p=35}} points out, “This is, of course, a purely mental concept, as music can never do anything but go forwards, even if the given tune is reversed.  The different relationships set up by reversing the direction of a theme make it completely unrecognizable; and when a composer indulges in this device the disclosure of it makes not the slightest difference to our apprehension of the music, which must be listened to as going parallel with the time-processes of our existence.”&lt;ref&gt;Rubbra, p.&amp;nbsp;35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, there are examples of retrograde motion in the music of [[J.S. Bach]], [[Haydn]] and [[Beethoven]].  Bach’s [[Musical Offering]] includes a two-voice canon in which the second voice performs the melodic line of first voice backwards:[[File:Bach Canon 2 from Musical offering.wav|thumb|Bach Canon 2 from Musical offering]][[File:Bach Canon 2 from Musical offering.png|thumb|center|500px| Bach, two part canon from 'The Musical Offering.'  The lower part is an exact retrograde of the upper part. ]]

The minuet (third) movement of [[Joseph Haydn]]’s, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm_R7RFcMg Symphony no. 47],  is an exact [[palindrome]].  Haydn also transcribed this piece for piano and this version forms the second movement of his Piano Sonata in A major XVI/26 [[File:Haydn minuet- with slurs removed.wav|thumb|Minuet from Piano Sonata in A]][[File:Haydn minuet- with slurs removed.png|thumb|center|500px|Minuet 'al rovescio' from Haydn Sonata in A major. ]]

The fugal fourth movement of Beethoven, [[Piano Sonata No. 29 (Beethoven)|Piano Sonata no. 29]], op. 106, "Hammerklavier", has the following main theme:[[File:Hammeklavier fugue subject, first four bars 01.wav|thumb|Hammeklavier fugue subject, first four bars]][[File:Hammeklavier fugue subject, first four bars.png|thumb|center|500px|Hammeklavier fugue subject, first four bars]]Later in this movement, Beethoven conjures up and uses the retrograde version of the subject.  It should be noted, however, that Beethoven does not create a strict note-for-note reversal of the theme.&lt;ref&gt;In a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR5f8yAnGik&amp;t=56m40s lecture] on this Sonata, pianist Andras Schiff explains at how Beethoven explores the retrograde version of this subject.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Hammeklavier fugue subject, retrograde version, last four bars.wav|thumb|Hammeklavier fugue subject, retrograde version, last four bars]][[File:Hammeklavier fugue subject, retrograde version, last four bars.png|thumb|center|500px|Hammeklavier fugue subject, retrograde version, last four bars]]

== In post-tonal music ==
[[File:P-R-I-RI.png|thumb|Prime (top-left), retrograde (top-right), inverse (bottom-left), and retrograde-inverse (bottom-right).]]
As early as 1923, [[Arnold Schoenberg]] expressed the equivalence of melodic and harmonic presentation as a "unity of musical space." Taking the example of a hat, Schoenberg explained that the hat remains the same no matter if it is observed from below or above, from one side or another.  Similarly, permutations such as inversion, retrograde, and retrograde inversion are a way to create musical space.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, p.&amp;nbsp;184.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heinrich Jalowetz discussed [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s frequent use of retrograde (and other permutations) as a compositional device for twelve-tone music:  "The technique serves two main functions. One is to provide a substitute for classical tonality, with  all its melodic and harmonic consequences...The second function is to provide a means of interrelationship. This is done by presenting the row not only in normal position but in inversion, retrogression, and retrograde inversion. The music derives a strict inner cohesion through the artful treatment of such relationships, even though the listener may often be unable to follow what is happening."&lt;ref&gt;Jalowetz, p.&amp;nbsp;394.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Twelve-tone technique|twelve-tone music]], retrograde treatment of pitch is a commonplace, but rhythmic retrogrades are comparatively rare. Examples of rhythmic retrogrades occur in the music of [[Alban Berg]], for example in the operas ''[[Wozzeck]]'' and ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]'', and in the Chamber Concerto.&lt;ref&gt;Jarman, pp.&amp;nbsp;351, 357, and 364.&lt;/ref&gt;  In discussing Berg's extensive use of retrograde and palindrome, Robert Morgan coins the word "circular" to describe musical situations "in which an opening gesture returns at a composition's close, thereby joining the music's temporal extremes."&lt;ref&gt;Covach, p. 20, citing Morgan, "The Eternal Return," p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

Dorothy Slepian, writing in 1947, observed that "modern American composers write canons that, whether simple or complicated in structure, clearly discernible or subtly concealed, are a natural means of expression growing directly out of the individual needs of the melodic material. Therefore, most of the composers regard cancrizans as an artificial device imposed upon a theme rather than as a consequence germinated by it."&lt;ref name="Slepian, p. 314"&gt;Slepian, p.&amp;nbsp;314.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, [[Douglas Moore]], [[Harold Morris (composer)|Harold Morris]], [[Paul Creston]], and [[Bernard Rogers]] "flatly refute the expressive powers of the cancrizans" whereas [[Walter Piston]], [[Adolph Weiss]], [[Wallingford Riegger]], and [[Roger Sessions]] use it often.&lt;ref&gt;Slepian, p.&amp;nbsp;322.&lt;/ref&gt; One particularly colorful and effective example is found in the second movement of Piston's Concerto for Orchestra, where continuous rapid string passages with an ostinato bass rhythm and a melody in the English horn returns later in the movement performed backwards as a recapitulation.&lt;ref name="Slepian, p. 314"/&gt;

=== Examples in post-tonal music ===
*[[Alban Berg]], ''[[Der Wein]]'' (1929), "Der Wein der Liebenden"  (measures 112–40 are then heard in retrograde as measures 140–70)
*[[Alban Berg]], [[Lulu (opera)| ''Lulu'']], the "silent film " interlude in [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQh8saNM-74&amp;t=8s Act 2].
*[[Ruth Crawford Seeger]], ''Diaphonic Suite No. 3'' for two clarinets (1930), third movement, the first clarinet in bars 45–56 present an exact retrograde of the same part, bars 2–13,&lt;ref&gt;Nicholls, pp.&amp;nbsp;106–07.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Karel Goeyvaerts]], ''[[Nummer 5]] met zuivere tonen'' (Number 5 with Pure Tones, 1953) superimposes an ''exact'' retrograde of its materials on the "forwards" version.&lt;ref&gt;Sabbe, p.&amp;nbsp;73.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, not only does each event in the second half occur according to an axis of symmetry at the centre of the work, but each event itself is reversed, so that the note attacks in the first half become note decays in the second, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, pp.&amp;nbsp;64–65.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Paul Hindemith]]'s [[Ludus Tonalis]] cycle is highly palindromic, its ''Postludium'' being almost a retrograde inversion of its ''Introitus''.
*[[Charles Ives]], ''Scherzo: All the Way Around and Back'' (1907–08) is palindromic.&lt;ref&gt;Burkholder, Sinclair, and Sherwood.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Olivier Messiaen]], "[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBZcuO7gW-w Abîme des oiseaux]", from the ''[[Quatuor pour la fin du temps]]'' (1941) exhibits many retrograde relationships among its elements,&lt;ref&gt;Morris, pp.&amp;nbsp;129, 135, 138–39, 144–45, 147–48, 152–53.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as one rhythm that is "a retrograde version of ''rāgavardhana'', No. 93 in [[Sarangadeva|Sharngadeva]]'s collection," the ''[[Sangita Ratnakara]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, p.&amp;nbsp;148.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Luigi Nono]], ''Incontri'' (1955).&lt;ref&gt;Stenzl, pp.&amp;nbsp;150–53.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Carl Ruggles]], ''Sun-Treader'' (1926–31) has a rhythmically free pitch palindrome in b. 68–118, and a retrograde canon in b. 124–33.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholls, pp.&amp;nbsp;99–101.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Igor Stravinsky]], ''[[Canticum Sacrum]]'' (1956). The fifth [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tGwTl3Ui0E&amp;t=7m20s movement] is an almost exact retrograde of the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lE8WE6YIy-M&amp;t=1m22s first].&lt;ref&gt;van den Toorn, p.&amp;nbsp;414; White, pp.&amp;nbsp;488–89.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Iannis Xenakis]], ''[[Metastaseis (Xenakis)|Metastaseis]]'' (1953–54) contains many instances of retrograde relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Barthel-Calvet, pp.&amp;nbsp;155, 166, 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-retrogradable rhythm==
In [[music]] and [[music theory]], a '''non-retrogradable [[rhythm]]''' is a rhythmic [[palindrome]], i.e., a pattern of note [[duration (music)|durations]] that is read or performed the same either forwards or backwards.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used most frequently in the context of the music of [[Olivier Messiaen]]. For example, such rhythms occur in the "Liturgie de cristal" and "Danse de la fureur, pour les sept trompettes"—the first and sixth movements—of Messiaen's ''[[Quatuor pour la fin du temps]]''.

A Road Powered [[electric vehicle]]  may be defined as a transport capsule with the following characteristics:

(1) The [[Prime mover (locomotive)|principal means of locomotion]] is one or more [[electric motor]](s)

2) The electric motors are powered by an [[electricity|electrical supply]] provided either from a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] (usually on-board) or power source (typically remote, and connected directly via conductive [[electrical cable|cable]]s or [[Inductive charging|magnetic inductive fields]]

(3) There is a defined [[road]]way over which the vehicle travels (that means, although it may have some on-board battery reserve, is not intended to be [[Off-roading|a cross country vehicle]])

(4) Where an external electric supply is provided, this is typically with [[trolleybus|overhead]] conductors or [[Third rail|above-ground rails]] or (rarely) [[Resonant inductive coupling|sub-surface electro-magnets]].

(5) An all-electric vehicle typically requires one or more [[Battery electric vehicle|on-board energy supply elements]] or devices for autonomous operation, most commonly by  [[Battery (electricity)|chemical batteries]], less frequently via [[Electrical generator|electro-mechanical generators]]

(6) The electric vehicle further may include an on-board [[control system]] that directs energy from the energy storage elements, as needed, and converts such energy to electric motors used to propel the electric vehicle.

A Road Powered Electric Vehicle therefore '''''necessarily  includes a system for supplying electricity from an external power source''''' (such as a remote [[Electricity generation|power station]]) through a network of power coupling elements which provide an integral and continuous power connection between origin and destination.

==Wireless energy transfer==

{{Main|wireless energy transfer}}

In USA Patent 6421600 these power coupling elements are electro-magnetic transmission coils embedded in the roadway and reception coils which are electrically [[resonant]], so that they convert the magnetic flux above the road into electrical energy on the vehicle, which is entirely independent, since there is no mechanical or electrical link.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The USA Patent 6421600 version of RPEV cited also includes:

(1) an on-board power meter to indicate the approximate consumption and an approximation of its remaining autonomous (battery) endurance or ranger range

(2) a [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|wide bandwidth]] [[Channel (communications)|communications channel]] to allow information signals to be sent to, and received from, the RPEV while it is in use;

(3) automated garaging, a system that automatically connects power to the RPEV when it is in storage overnight, both to recharge the on-board batteries and power the on-board [[storage heater]] in cold weather so that it is comfortable for the driver and passengers.

(4) electronic coupling between two or more RPEVs so that one can be a "master" (with a driver) and the following vehicle(s) are "slave" (controlled by the driver in the "master" vehicle) as a sort of "road train"  in order to increase [[passenger]] or [[cargo|payload]] capacity.

(5) a [[positioning system]] for determining the current location of the RPEV; and

(6) a scheduling and dispatch computer so that many RPEV's can be accommodated efficiently on any particular length of road with embedded transmission coils. Such a system could be adapted for use with remote drivers or automatic control over closed roadway circuits such as warehouses and theme parks.

'''[[Online Electric Vehicle]]s (OHVs)''' use pick-up equipment underneath the vehicle then collects power through non-contact magnetic induction, which may imply a similar electrical design.

==Wired energy transfer==

[[File:Tram train 1907.pdf|thumb|right|Tram and 'Trackless Car' share common overhead lines (from [[Harmsworth Popular Science]])]]
[[Trolleybuses]] use overhead cables which could also be used for cars, as shown in a photograph (right) carried by an encyclopedic magazine about 1910.

===Overhead power lines===
The twin overhead power lines are usually copper conductors with a flat surface, which are supported by a steel catenary wire. A pole or pantograph extends from the vehicle and presses 'slippers' or 'skates' against the conductors to complete the circuit. These slipper or skate contacts are frequently coated with graphite, or have a carbon block to reduce friction and ensure a good (low resistance) electrical connection.

Since buses are scheduled, traffic conflicts are rare. If the overhead dual power line infrastructure was used randomly by private users, then some sort of management system would be required. The simplest would be to provide the vehicles some limited autonomy so that they could simply disconnect when arriving at each intersection and reconnect when they joined the next section. A more sophisticated traffic management system, as proposed by USA Patent 6421600 (above) could facilitate transit where there are many vehicles wishing to draw power from a particular section of the infrastructure.

[[File:SARS RPEV.png|thumb]] [[File:CCC RPEV.png|thumb]]

Recent improvements in trolleybus design include the automatic connection and disconnection of power poles either by the driver or in the event of mechanical dis-engagement from the overhead wires, so that the driver can remain in control, using on-board battery power. Better materials and motion dynamics modeling allow speeds up to about 80&amp;nbsp;km/h so that trolleybus behavior is flexible and totally comparable with regular autonomous vehicle performance, even at crossings and road-junctions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Ground-level power supply===
[[Ground-level power supply]] is an alternative to overhead power lines. The most common version is the [[conduit current collection]] system, where the power supply is carried in a channel or vault under the roadway. This is a tube, open at the top to allow a blade to enter and extend slippers against the power conductors, which are either side of the access opening slot, near the top of the channel. The arrangement is shaped so that live surfaces can not be reached by hand, and the lower part of the conduit provides drainage to remove any water.

Conduit power was first designed in the steam age (c.1900) when power was transmitted mechanically from a series of steam-powered rotating screws, as shown in the illustration (left) also published by [[Harmsworth Popular Science]].

A more recent roadway power supply design used by the [[Bordeaux tramway]] involves alternate (line and neutral) panels which are only powered whilst they are actually under the tram. This system is called APS (French: ''Alimentation par Sol'' which implies sub-surface power feed in English).

===Overhead electrical net===
'''A parking area''' with an overhead electrical net was in use at  Seoul Grand Park Zoo in South Korea, to recharge electric vehicles {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}, This was similar to a fairground [[bumper car]] arrangement which allowed vehicle batteries to be recharged, prior to introduction of the more modern OLEV [[Online Electric Vehicle]] system. The advantage was that vehicles could be parked randomly, as convenient, and there was no need for either the tripping hazard of trailing cables used by most [[electric vehicle]]s nor for fiddly precise alignment of conductor poles needed by [[trolley bus]]es.

==Linear Motor Propulsion==
{{Main|linear motor}}

An alternative form of electro-magnetic coupling is called a linear motor, first developed by Professor [[Eric Laithwaite]] at [[Imperial College London]] in the 1960s.

Instead of supplying electric motors with power directly or charging on-board batteries, the RPEV is fitted with magnets which are impelled horizontally in the same way as the rotor on an ordinary electric motor is impelled to rotate. A linear motor works in exactly the same way a round motor which has been split to its centre, laid flat and extended.

The Shanghai [[Transrapid]] and [[Bombardier Advanced Rapid Transit]] systems are practical examples of this type of RPEV technology applied to [[rail transport]] systems (which are sometimes called railroads, especially in USA).

[[Maglev]] uses magnetic repulsion to support the [[Passenger car (rail)|carriage]] weight as well as to propel the [[Rapid transit|vehicle]] forward, so wheels are not needed. Maglev  [[train]]s effectively ride on top of a magnetic wave, much as a [[surfer]] rides a wave on the sea.

{{Linguistics collapsible}}'''Sociolinguistics''' is the descriptive study of the effect of any and all aspects of [[society]], including cultural [[Norm (sociology)|norms]], expectations, and context, on the way [[language]] is used, and society's effect on language. It differs from [[sociology of language]], which focuses on the effect of language on society. Sociolinguistics overlaps considerably with [[pragmatics]]. It is historically closely related to [[linguistic anthropology]], and the distinction between the two fields has been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gumperz,|first=John J.|last2=Cook-Gumperz|first2=Jenny|date=2008|title=Studying language, culture, and society: Sociolinguistics or linguistic anthropology?|url=|journal=Journal of Sociolinguistics|volume=12 |issue=4|pages=532–545}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also studies how language [[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]] differ between groups separated by certain social variables (e.g., [[ethnicity]], [[religion]], [[Social status|status]], [[gender]], level of [[education]], [[Ageing|age]], etc.) and how creation and adherence to these rules is used to categorize individuals in [[Social class|social or socioeconomic classes]]. As the usage of a language varies from place to place, language usage also varies among social classes, and it is these ''[[sociolect]]s'' that sociolinguistics studies.

The social aspects of language were in the modern sense first studied by Indian and Japanese linguists in the 1930s, and also by [[Louis Gauchat]] in Switzerland in the early 1900s, but none received much attention in the West until much later. The study of the social motivation of [[language change]], on the other hand, has its foundation in the [[wave model]] of the late 19th century. The first attested use of the term ''sociolinguistics'' was by [[Thomas Callan Hodson]] in the title of his 1939 article "Sociolinguistics in India" published in ''Man in India''.&lt;ref&gt;Paulston, Christine Bratt and G. Richard Tucker, eds. ''Sociolinguistics: The Essential Readings''. Malden, Ma.: Wiley-Blackwell, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncl.ac.uk/ss15/papers/paper_details.php?id=304 T. C.

==Applications==
For example, a sociolinguist might determine through study of social attitudes that a particular [[vernacular]] would not be considered appropriate language use in a business or professional setting. Sociolinguists might also study the [[grammar]], [[phonetics]], [[vocabulary]], and other aspects of this sociolect much as [[Dialectology|dialectologists]] would study the same for a [[regional dialect]].

The study of language [[Variation (linguistics)|variation]] is concerned with social [[wikt:constraint|constraints]] determining language in its contextual [[social environment|environment]]. [[Code-switching]] is the term given to the use of different varieties of language in different social situations.

William Labov is often regarded as the founder of the study of sociolinguistics. He is especially noted for introducing the quantitative study of language variation and change,&lt;ref&gt;Paolillo, John C. ''Analyzing Linguistic Variation: Statistical Models and Methods'' CSLI Press 2001, Tagliamonte, Sali ''Analysing Sociolinguistic Variation'' Cambridge, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; making the sociology of language into a scientific discipline.

==Traditional sociolinguistic interview ==
Sociolinguistic interviews are an integral part of collecting data for sociolinguistic studies.  There is an interviewer, who is conducting the study, and a subject, or [[Informant (linguistics)|informant]], who is the interviewee.  In order to get a grasp on a specific linguistic form and how it is used in the dialect of the subject, a variety of methods are used to [[elicitation technique|elicit]] certain registers of speech.  There are five different styles, ranging from formal to casual.  The most formal style would be elicited by having the subject read a list of minimal pairs (MP).  Minimal pairs are pairs of words that differ in only one phoneme, such as cat and bat.  Having the subject read a word list (WL) will elicit a formal register, but generally not as formal as MP.  The reading passage (RP) style is next down on the formal register, and the interview style (IS) is when an interviewer can finally get into eliciting a more casual speech from the subject.  During the IS the interviewer can converse with the subject and try to draw out of them an even more casual sort of speech by asking him to recall childhood memories or maybe a near death experience, in which case the subject will get deeply involved with the story since strong emotions are often attached to these memories.  Of course, the most sought-after type of speech is the casual style (CS).  This type of speech is difficult if not impossible to elicit because of the [[Observer's Paradox]].  The closest one might come to CS in an interview is when the subject is interrupted by a close friend or family member, or perhaps must answer the phone.  CS is used in a completely unmonitored environment where the subject feels most comfortable and will use their natural vernacular without overtly thinking about it.

== Fundamental concepts==
While the study of sociolinguistics is very broad, there are a few fundamental concepts on which many sociolinguistic inquiries depend.

=== Speech community ===
{{main|Speech community}}
[[Speech community]] is a concept in sociolinguistics that describes a distinct group of people who use language in a unique and mutually accepted way among themselves. This is sometimes referred to as a [[Sprechbund]].

To be considered part of a speech community, one must have a [[communicative competence]].  That is, the speaker has the ability to use language in a way that is appropriate in the given situation. It is possible for a speaker to be communicatively competent in more than one language.&lt;ref name="Deckert"&gt;Deckert, Sharon K. and Caroline H. Vikers.  (2011).  An Introduction to Sociolinguistics: Society and Identity. Page 59&lt;/ref&gt;

Speech communities can be members of a profession with a specialized [[jargon]], distinct [[Group (sociology)|social groups]] like high school students or hip hop fans, or even tight-knit groups like [[Family|families]] and friends. Members of speech communities will often develop [[slang]] or jargon to serve the group's special purposes and priorities.

[[Community of Practice]] allows for sociolinguistics to examine the relationship between socialization, competence, and identity.  Since identity is a very complex structure, studying language socialization is a means to examine the micro-interactional level of practical activity (everyday activities).  The learning of a language is greatly influenced by family but it is supported by the larger local surroundings, such as school, sports teams, or religion. Speech communities may exist within a larger community of practice.&lt;ref name="Deckert" /&gt;

=== High prestige and low prestige varieties ===
{{main|Prestige (sociolinguistics)}}

Crucial to sociolinguistic analysis is the concept of prestige; certain speech habits are assigned a positive or a negative value, which is then applied to the speaker. This can operate on many levels. It can be realised on the level of the individual sound/phoneme, as Labov discovered in investigating pronunciation of the post-vocalic /r/ in the North-Eastern USA, or on the macro scale of language choice, as realised in the various diglossia that exist throughout the world, where Swiss-German/High German is perhaps most well known. An important implication of the sociolinguistic theory is that speakers 'choose' a variety when making a speech act, whether consciously or subconsciously.

The terms acrolectal (high) and basilectal (low) are also used to distinguish between a more standard dialect and a dialect of less prestige.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aPk_BAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=dictionary+of+psychology|title=A Dictionary of Psychology|last=Colman|first=Andrew M.|date=2009-02-26|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780191047688|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social network ===
Understanding language in society means that one also has to understand the [[social network]]s in which language is embedded.  A social network is another way of describing a particular speech community in terms of relations between individual members in a community. A network could be ''loose'' or ''tight'' depending on how members interact with each other.&lt;ref name="Wardhaugh"&gt;{{citation|last=Wardhaugh|first=Ronald|title=An Introduction to Sociolinguistics|place=New York|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, an office or factory may be considered a tight community because all members interact with each other. A large course with 100+ students would be a looser community because students may only interact with the instructor and maybe 1–2 other students. A ''multiplex'' community is one in which members have multiple relationships with each other.&lt;ref name="Wardhaugh"/&gt; For instance, in some neighborhoods, members may live on the same street, work for the same employer and even intermarry.

The looseness or tightness of a social network may affect speech patterns adopted by a speaker. For instance, Sylvie Dubois and Barbara Horvath found that speakers in one Cajun Louisiana community were more likely to pronounce English "th" [θ] as [t] (or [ð] as [d]) if they participated in a relatively dense social network (i.e. had strong local ties and interacted with many other speakers in the community), and less likely if their networks were looser (i.e. fewer local ties).&lt;ref name="DuboisHorvath"&gt;Dubois, Sylvie and Horvath, Barbara. (1998). "Let's tink about dat: Interdental Fricatives in Cajun English." Language Variation and Change 10 (3), pp 245–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

A social network may apply to the macro level of a country or a city, but also to the interpersonal level of neighborhoods or a single family. Recently, social networks have been formed by the Internet, through chat rooms, Facebook groups, organizations, and online dating services.

==Differences according to class==
{{further|Linguistic insecurity}}

Sociolinguistics as a field distinct from [[dialectology]] was pioneered through the study of language variation in urban areas. Whereas dialectology studies the geographic distribution of language variation, sociolinguistics focuses on other sources of variation, among them class. Class and occupation are among the most important linguistic markers found in society. One of the fundamental findings of sociolinguistics, which has been hard to disprove, is that class and language variety are related. Members of the working class tend to speak less [[standard language]], while the lower, middle, and upper middle class will, in turn, speak closer to the standard.  However, the upper class, even members of the upper middle class, may often speak 'less' standard than the middle class.  This is because not only class but class aspirations, are important.

===Class aspiration===
Studies, such as those by William Labov in the 1960s, have shown that social aspirations influence speech patterns.  This is also true of class aspirations.  In the process of wishing to be associated with a certain class (usually the upper class and upper middle class) people who are moving in that direction socio-economically will adjust their speech patterns to sound like them.  However, not being native upper-class speakers, they often [[hypercorrect]], which involves overcorrecting their speech to the point of introducing new errors. The same is true for individuals moving down in socio-economic status.

In any contact situation, there is a power dynamic, be it a teacher-student or employee-customer situation, this power dynamic results in a hierarchical differentiation between languages.&lt;ref&gt;Deckert, Sharon K. and Caroline H. Vikers.  (2011).  An Introduction to Sociolinguistics: Society and Identity. Page 44&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social language codes===
Basil Bernstein, a well-known British socio-linguist, devised in his book, 'Elaborated and restricted codes: their social origins and some consequences,' a method for categorizing language codes according to variable emphases on verbal and extraverbal communication. He claimed that factors like family orientation, social control, verbal feedback, and possibly social class contributed to the development of the two codes: elaborated and restricted.&lt;ref name="Bernstein"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bernstein|first=Basil B.|title=Elaborated and restricted codes: their social origins and some consequences|year=1967|publisher=Bobbs-Merrill|pages=55–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Restricted code====
According to Basil Bernstein, the restricted code exemplified the predominance of extraverbal communication, with an emphasis on interpersonal connection over individual expression. His theory places this code within environments that operate according to established social structures that predetermine the roles of their members, in which the commonality of interests and intents due to a shared local identity creates a predictability of discrete intent and therefore a simplification of verbal utterances. Such environments may include military, religious, and legal atmospheres, criminal and prison subcultures, long-term married relationships and friendships between children. Due to the strong bonds between speakers, explicit verbal communication is often rendered unnecessary and individual expression irrelevant. However, simplification is not a sign of a lack of intelligence or complexity within the code; rather, communication is performed more through extraverbal means (facial expression, touch, etc.) in order to affirm the speakers' bond. Bernstein notes the example of a young man asking a stranger to dance: there is an established manner of asking, and yet communication is performed through physical graces and the exchange of glances. As such, implied meaning plays a greater role in this code than in the elaborated code.  Restricted code also operates to unify speakers and foster solidarity.&lt;ref name="Bernstein" /&gt;

====Elaborated code====
Basil Bernstein defined 'elaborated code' according to its emphasis on verbal communication over extraverbal. This code is typical in environments where a variety of social roles are available to the individual, to be chosen based upon disposition and temperament. Most of the time, speakers of elaborated code utilize a broader lexicon and demonstrate less syntactic predictability than speakers of restricted code. The lack of predetermined structure and solidarity requires explicit verbal communication of discrete intent by the individual in order to achieve  educational and career success. Bernstein notes, with caution, the association of this code with upper classes (while restricted code is associated with lower classes), where the abundance of available resources allows persons to choose their social roles, warning, however, that studies associating the codes with separate social classes used small samples and were subject to significant variation. He also asserts that elaborated code originates due to differences in social context rather than intellectual advantages; as such, elaborated code differs from restricted code according to the context-based emphasis on individual advancement over assertion of communal bonds.&lt;ref name="Bernstein" /&gt;

====The codes and child development====
Bernstein explains language development according to the two codes in light of their fundamentally different values. For instance, a child exposed solely to restricted code learns extraverbal communication over verbal, and therefore may have a less extensive vocabulary than a child raised with exposure to both codes. While there is no inherent lack of value to restricted code, a child without exposure to elaborated code may encounter difficulties upon entering formal education, in which standard, clear verbal communication and comprehension is necessary for learning and effective interaction both with instructors and other students from differing backgrounds. As such, it may be beneficial for children who have been exposed solely to restricted code to enter pre-school training in elaborated code in order to acquire a manner of speaking that is considered appropriate and widely comprehensible within the education environment.

Additionally, Bernstein notes several studies in language development according to social class. In 1963, the Committee for Higher Education conducted a study on verbal IQ that showed a deterioration in individuals from lower working classes ages 8–11 and 11-15 years in comparison to those from middle classes (having been exposed to both restricted and elaborated codes).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|mode=cs1|author=Committee on Higher Education|year=1963|title=Higher Education Appendix One|issue=Parts 2 and 3|location=London|publisher=H.M.S.O.}} Cited in Bernstein 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, studies by Bernstein,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bernstein|first=Basil|year=1958|title=Some sociological determinants of perception: An enquiry into sub-cultural differences|journal=British Journal of Sociology|volume=9|pages=159–174}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bernstein|first=Basil|year=1960|title=Language and social class: A research note|journal=British Journal of Sociology|volume=11|pages=271–276}}&lt;/ref&gt; Venables,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Venables|first=Ethel|year=1962|title=The reserve of ability in part-time technical college courses|journal=University Quarterly|volume=17|pages=60–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ravenette,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Ravenette|first=T.|date=1963|title=Intelligence, personality and social class: an investigation into the patterns of intelligence and personality of working-class secondary school children|type=unpublished PhD thesis|publisher=University of London Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a 1958 Education Council report,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|mode=cs1|author=Report of the Central Advisory Council for Education|year=1958|title=Fifteen to Eighteen|location=London|publisher=H.M.S.O.|issue=Vol. I|page=376}} Cited in Bernstein 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; show a relative lack of success on verbal tasks in comparison to extraverbal in children from lower working classes (having been exposed solely to restricted code).&lt;ref name="Bernstein" /&gt;

===Covert prestige===
{{main|Prestige (sociolinguistics)}}

It is generally assumed that non-standard language is low-prestige language.  However, in certain groups, such as traditional working-class neighborhoods, standard language may be considered undesirable in many contexts.  This is because the working class dialect is generally considered a powerful in-group marker, and especially for non-mobile individuals, the use of non-standard varieties (even exaggeratedly so) expresses neighborhood pride and group and class solidarity.  There will thus be a considerable difference in use of non-standard varieties when going to the pub or having a neighborhood barbecue (high), and going to the bank (lower) for the same individual.

== Sociolinguistic variables ==
{{Main|Variation (linguistics)|Dialectology|Language and gender}}
Studies in the field of sociolinguistics typically take a sample population and interview them, assessing the realisation of certain sociolinguistic variables.

A commonly studied source of variation is regional dialects. Dialectology studies variations in language based primarily on geographic distribution and their associated features. Sociolinguists concerned with grammatical and phonological features that correspond to regional areas are often called dialectologists.

There are several different types of age-based variation one may see within a population. They are vernacular of a subgroup with membership typically characterized by a specific age range, age-graded variation, and indications of linguistic change in progress.

Variation may also be associated with gender. Men and women, on average, tend to use slightly different language styles. These differences tend to be quantitative rather than qualitative. That is, to say that women use a particular speaking style more than men do is akin to saying that men are taller than women (i.e., men are on average taller than women, but some women are taller than some men).

Another Method is the Guise Technique, this technique has the listener listen to a pair of words and evaluate them based on personality and dialect. As some groups have shared views on language attitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1996|last1=Starks|first1=Donna|last2=Paltridge|first2=Brian|title=A note on using sociolingustic methods to study non-native attitudes towards English|journal=World Englishes|volume=15|issue=2|pages=217–224|doi=10.1111/j.1467-971X.1996.tb00107.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7307">'''[[Spirituality|Spiritual]] opportunism''' refers to the exploitation of spiritual ideas (or of the spirituality of others, or of spiritual [[authority]]): for personal gain, partisan interests or selfish motives. Usually the implication is that doing so is unprincipled in some way, although it may cause no harm and involve no abuse. In other words, religion becomes a means to achieve something that is alien to it, or things are projected into religion that do not belong there. 

Any human being has at least some kind of spiritual sense, developed through personal reflection or undeveloped but evident from lifestyle and communications, which defines the meta-meanings of human existence, the purpose of life, the meaning of the universe and one's own place in it, and so on. This belief system may, or may not be expressed through the categories and concepts of a religion; it could be only assumed, rather than explicit. Whatever the case, such beliefs can be used in a way that they become a source of profit.

If a religious authority acquires influence over the "hearts and minds" of people who are believers in a religion, and therefore can "tap into" the most intimate and deepest-felt concerns of believers, it can also gain immense power from that. This power can be used in a self-interested manner, exploiting opportunities to benefit the position of the religious authority or its supporters in society. This could be considered as inconsistent with the real intentions of the religious belief, or it might show lack of respect for the spiritual autonomy of others. The "good faith" of people is then taken advantage of, in ways that involve some kind of deceit, or some dubious, selfish motive. 

Even although, in his ''Treatise on Toleration'' (1763), the famous French liberal philosopher [[Voltaire]] expressed a distaste for [[religious fanaticism]], he was at the same time convinced that religion could be a useful tool to keep the masses under control. He said famously, "If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him." In his ''[[Épître à l'Auteur du Livre des Trois Imposteurs]]'', a criticism of atheism in which he makes this remark, Voltaire opined that faith in God is a "sublime system" that is "necessary to man": it is, "...the sacred tie that binds society." Similar ideas have been expressed by numerous political leaders, business leaders, and intellectuals for centuries, both right-wing and left-wing. In their utopias of social engineering, early socialistic thinkers such as [[Auguste Comte]] (''Treatise on Sociology Instituting the Religion of Humanity'' 1851-54) and [[Henri de Saint-Simon]] (''New Christianity'' 1825) envisaged a new secular (or "scientific") belief-system, analogous to a religion, which would unite the people humanely, and ensure social cohesion.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Furedi, "Glaube: Wie aus dem Atheismus eine Pseudo-Religion wurde". ''NovoArgumente'', 18 April 2012.[http://www.frankfuredi.com/index.php/site/article/548/]&lt;/ref&gt; This idea is not as unrealistic as it sounds,&lt;ref&gt;Yasmin Anwar, "Highly religious people are less motivated by compassion than are non-believers". ''UC Berkeley News Center'', April 30, 2012.[http://newscenter.berkeley.edu/2012/04/30/religionandgenerosity/]&lt;/ref&gt; but it could be interpreted as an opportunist use of people's faith for political purposes. 

Politicians around the world recognize the power of religion, and therefore they usually try to keep on the good side of religious authorities and believers.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see: Subir Bhaumik, "China and India use Buddha for regional karma". ''Al Jazeera English (online)'', 11 January 2012.[http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/01/2013171148400871.html]&lt;/ref&gt; They are very aware, that religion can be not just a force for social stability, but can also be the cause of enormous animosity among the peoples, if spiritual sensitivities are offended. For example, when in February 2012 protests broke out in various parts of Afghanistan over the improper disposal of Korans at the US military Bagram Air Base, the US government apologized officially (see [[2012 Afghanistan Quran burning protests]]). Some [[religious wars]] and [[crusades]] have lasted a very long time, being pursued quite relentlessly - regardless of the number of casualties, and regardless of who happened to be winning. It creates plenty potential to exploit religious likes and dislikes opportunistically, to advance political, social or business interests.

The term spiritual opportunism is also used in the sense of casting around for suitable spiritual beliefs  borrowed and cobbled together in some way to justify, condemn or "make sense of" particular ways of behaving, usually with some partisan or ulterior motive. This may not be abusive, but it often gives rise to criticisms or accusations&lt;ref&gt;An example is Robert M. Price, ''Top Secret: The Truth Behind Today’s Pop Mysticisms''. Prometheus Books, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; that the given spiritual beliefs:

*are not an organic, sincere or authentic expression of the real nature of the people who contrived them.
*do not really express what people's lives are about, but are in some way an "artificial add-on".
*lack any deeper principled foundation, and are more an "eclectic, self-serving concoction"
*are made to serve partisan interests, contrary to the real intention of the beliefs.

Supporters of traditional religions such as [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Hinduism]] or [[Buddhism]] sometimes complain that people (such as [[New Age]] enthusiasts) seek out spiritual beliefs ''that serve only themselves'', as a form of "spiritual opportunism". Such complaints are often highly controversial, because people are considered to have the right to their own spiritual beliefs (they may not have that right, to the extent that they are socially excluded unless they profess certain spiritual beliefs, but they may only subscribe "formally" or "outwardly" to them). 

Because spiritual beliefs are a highly personal matter in the first instance and concern personal meanings, they are often difficult to criticize because "they just are what they are". As they concern highly abstract, metaphysical principles, it is difficult to prove their inconsistency, even using the criterion of whether people "act according to their beliefs". People can always argue that the personal meaning they attach to something or the personal associations they make, ''cannot'' be adequately expressed in the language of others. If accusations of spiritual opportunism are made, therefore, evidential proof depends greatly on what people are willing to reveal (or "confess") about themselves in what they say and do.

Spiritual opportunism sometimes refers also to the practice of [[proselytizing]] one's spiritual beliefs when any opportunity to do so arises, for the purpose of winning over, or persuading others, about the superiority of these beliefs. In this context, the spiritual opportunist may engage in various actions, themselves not directly related to the spiritual beliefs, with the specific aim of convincing others of the superiority of his own belief system – it may effectively amount to "buying their support".

'''Surface plasmon resonance''' ('''SPR''') is the resonant oscillation of conduction electrons at the interface between negative and positive permittivity material stimulated by incident light. SPR is the basis of many standard tools for measuring [[adsorption]] of material onto planar metal (typically gold or silver) surfaces or onto the surface of metal [[nanoparticle]]s. It is the fundamental principle behind many color-based [[biosensor]] applications, different [[lab-on-a-chip]] sensors and diatom photosynthesis.

==Explanation==
The [[surface plasmon polariton]] is a non-radiative [[electromagnetic wave|electromagnetic surface wave]] &lt;!--The field energy present in the dielectric medium is evanescent. --&gt; that propagates in a direction parallel to the negative permittivity/dielectric material interface. Since the wave is on the boundary of the conductor and the external medium (air, water or vacuum for example), these oscillations are very sensitive to any change of this boundary, such as the adsorption of molecules to the conducting surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=S. Zeng|title=Nanomaterials enhanced surface plasmon resonance for biological and chemical sensing applications |journal=Chemical Society Reviews|volume=43 |pages=3426–3452 |date=2014|doi=10.1039/C3CS60479A|last2= Baillargeat|first2= Dominique|last3=Ho|first3=Ho-Pui|last4=Yong|first4=Ken-Tye |pmid=24549396 |issue=10 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260252810|bibcode=2012ChSRv..41.6507P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To describe the existence and properties of surface plasmon polaritons, one can choose from various models (quantum theory, [[Drude model]], etc.). The simplest way to approach the problem is to treat each material as a homogeneous continuum, described by a frequency-dependent [[relative static permittivity|relative permittivity]] between the external medium and the surface. This quantity, hereafter referred to as the materials' "[[dielectric function]]", is the [[complex permittivity]]. In order for the terms that describe the electronic [[surface plasmon]] to exist, the real part of the dielectric constant of the conductor must be negative and its magnitude must be greater than that of the dielectric. This condition is met in the infrared-visible wavelength region for air/metal and water/metal interfaces (where the real dielectric constant of a metal is negative and that of air or water is positive).

LSPRs (Localized SPRs) are collective electron charge oscillations in metallic nanoparticles that are excited by light. They exhibit enhanced near-field amplitude at the resonance wavelength. This field is highly localized at the nanoparticle and decays rapidly away from the nanoparticle/dieletric interface into the dielectric background, though far-field scattering by the particle is also enhanced by the resonance. Light intensity enhancement is a very important aspect of LSPRs and localization means the LSPR has very high spatial resolution (subwavelength), limited only by the size of nanoparticles. Because of the enhanced field amplitude, effects that depend on the amplitude such as magneto-optical effect are also enhanced by LSPRs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Plasmonic Au/Co/Au nanosandwiches with Enhanced Magneto-Optical Activity|journal=Small |volume=4|date=2008|doi= 10.1002/smll.200700594|pmid=18196506|issue=2|pages=202–5|last1=González-Díaz|first1=Juan B.|last2=García-Martín|first2=Antonio|last3=García-Martín|first3=José M.|last4=Cebollada|first4=Alfonso|last5=Armelles|first5=Gaspar|last6=Sepúlveda|first6=Borja|last7=Alaverdyan|first7=Yury|last8=Käll|first8=Mikael|hdl=10261/17402 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Evidence of localized surface plasmon enhanced magneto-optical effect in nanodisk array |journal=Appl.

==Implementations==
[[File:Otto-schema.png|thumb|Otto configuration]]
[[File:SPR-schema.png|thumb|Kretschmann configuration]]

In order to excite surface plasmons in a resonant manner, one can use electron bombardment or incident [[light beam]] (visible and infrared are typical). The incoming beam has to match its [[momentum]] to that of the plasmon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Size dependence of Au NP-enhanced surface plasmon resonance based on differential phase measurement |journal=Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical |date=2013|doi=10.1016/j.snb.2012.09.073|volume=176|pages=1128–1133|last1=Zeng|first1=Shuwen|last2=Yu|first2=Xia|last3=Law|first3=Wing-Cheung|last4=Zhang|first4=Yating|last5=Hu|first5=Rui|last6=Dinh|first6=Xuan-Quyen|last7=Ho|first7=Ho-Pui|last8=Yong|first8=Ken-Tye |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268225952 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of [[Polarization (waves)|p-polarized]] light  (polarization occurs parallel to the plane of incidence), this is possible by passing the light through a block of glass to increase the [[wavenumber]] (and the [[momentum]]), and achieve the resonance at a given wavelength and angle. [[Polarization (waves)|S-polarized]] light (polarization occurs perpendicular to the plane of incidence) cannot excite electronic surface plasmons.
Electronic and magnetic surface plasmons obey the following [[dispersion relation]]:

:&lt;math&gt; K(\omega) = \frac{\omega}{c} \sqrt{\frac{\varepsilon_1 \varepsilon_2 \mu_1 \mu_2}{\varepsilon_1 \mu_1 + \varepsilon_2 \mu_2}} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is the relative permittivity, and &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the relative permeability of the material (1: the glass block, 2: the metal film), while &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is angular frequency and &lt;math&gt;{c}&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of light in a vacuum.

Typical metals that support surface plasmons are silver and gold, but metals such as copper, titanium or chromium have also been used.

When using light to excite SP waves, there are two configurations which are well
known. In the Otto setup, the light illuminates the wall of a glass block, typically a prism, and is [[total internal reflection|totally internally reflected]]. A thin metal film (for example gold) is positioned close enough to the prism wall so that an [[evanescent wave]] can interact with the plasma waves on the surface and hence excite the plasmons.

In the '''Kretschmann configuration''', the metal film is evaporated onto the glass
block. The light again illuminates the glass block, and an evanescent wave
penetrates through the metal film. The plasmons are excited at the outer side
of the film.
This configuration is used in most practical applications.

===SPR emission===
When the surface plasmon wave interacts with a local particle or irregularity, such as a [[surface roughness|rough surface]], part of the energy can be re-emitted as light. This emitted light can be detected ''behind'' the metal film from various directions.

==Applications==
[[File:Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Operations A.jpg|400px|Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Operations A]][[File:Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Operations B.jpg|400px|Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Operations B]]

Surface plasmons have been used to enhance the surface sensitivity of several spectroscopic measurements including [[fluorescence]], [[Raman scattering]], and [[second harmonic generation]]. However, in their simplest form, SPR reflectivity measurements can be used to detect molecular adsorption, such as polymers, DNA or proteins, etc. Technically, it is common to measure the angle of minimum reflection (angle of maximum absorption). This angle changes in the order of 0.1° during thin (about nm thickness) film adsorption. (See also the Examples.) In other cases the changes in the absorption wavelength is followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A localized surface plasmon resonance based immunosensor for the detection of casein in milk|journal=Sci. Technol. Adv. Mater.|volume=8|date=2007|pages= 331–338|doi=10.1016/j.stam.2006.12.010|bibcode = 2007STAdM...8..331M|issue=4|last1=Minh Hiep|first1=Ha|last2=Endo|first2=Tatsuro|last3=Kerman|first3=Kagan|last4=Chikae|first4=Miyuki|last5=Kim|first5=Do-Kyun|last6=Yamamura|first6=Shohei|last7=Takamura|first7=Yuzuru|last8=Tamiya|first8=Eiichi }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanism of detection is based on that the adsorbing molecules cause changes in the local index of refraction, changing the resonance conditions of the surface plasmon waves. The same principle is exploited in the recently developed competitive platform based on loss-less dielectric multilayers ([[Distributed_Bragg_reflector|DBR]]), supporting surface electromagnetic waves with sharper resonances ([[Bloch surface waves]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical|volume=174|pages=292–298|year=2012|doi=10.1016/j.snb.2012.07.015|title=Direct comparison of the performance of Bloch surface wave and surface plasmon polariton sensors|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925400512006958|last1=Sinibaldi|first1=A.|last2=Danz|first2=N.|last3=Descrovi|first3=E.|display-authors = etal }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the surface is patterned with different biopolymers, using adequate optics and imaging sensors (i.e. a camera), the technique can be extended to [[surface plasmon resonance microscopy|surface plasmon resonance imaging]] (SPRI). This method provides a high contrast of the images based on the adsorbed amount of molecules, somewhat similar to [[Brewster's angle|Brewster angle]] microscopy (this latter is most commonly used together with a [[Langmuir–Blodgett trough]]).

For nanoparticles, localized surface plasmon oscillations can give rise to the intense colors of [[suspension (chemistry)|suspensions]] or [[sol (colloid)|sols]] containing the [[nanoparticle]]s. Nanoparticles or nanowires of noble metals exhibit strong [[absorption band]]s in the [[ultraviolet]]-[[visible light|visible]] light regime that are not present in the bulk metal. This extraordinary absorption increase has been exploited to increase light absorption in photovoltaic cells by depositing metal nanoparticles on the cell surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=J. Appl. Phys.|volume=101|date=2007|doi=10.1063/1.2734885|title=Surface plasmon enhanced silicon solar cells|issue=9|pages=093105–093105–8|bibcode = 2007JAP...101i3105P|last1=Pillai|first1=S.|last2=Catchpole|first2=K. R.|last3=Trupke|first3=T.|last4=Green|first4=M. A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The energy (color) of this absorption differs when the light is polarized along or perpendicular to the nanowire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Phenomenological studies of optical properties of Cu nanowires|journal=Sci. Technol. Adv. Mater.|volume=8|date=2007|pages=277–281 |doi=10.1016/j.stam.2007.02.001|bibcode = 2007STAdM...8..277L|issue=4|last1=Locharoenrat|first1=Kitsakorn|last2=Sano|first2=Haruyuki|last3=Mizutani|first3=Goro }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shifts in this resonance due to changes in the local index of refraction upon adsorption to the nanoparticles can also be used to detect biopolymers such as DNA or proteins. 
Related complementary techniques include plasmon waveguide resonance, [[Quartz crystal microbalance|QCM]], [[extraordinary optical transmission]], and [[dual polarization interferometry]].

=== SPR Immunoassay ===
The first SPR [[immunoassay]] was proposed in 1983 by Liedberg, Nylander, and Lundström, then of the [[Linköping Institute of Technology]] (Sweden).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0250-6874(83)85036-7|title=Surface plasmon resonance for gas detection and biosensing|date=1983|last1=Liedberg|first1=Bo|last2=Nylander|first2=Claes|last3=Lunström|first3=Ingemar|journal=Sensors and Actuators|volume=4|pages=299–304}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They adsorbed
human [[Immunoglobulin G|IgG]] onto a 600-angstrom silver film, and used the assay to detect anti-human IgG in water solution.  Unlike many other immunoassays, such as [[ELISA]], an SPR immunoassay is ''label free'' in that a [[Fluorescent labelling|label molecule]] is not required for detection of the analyte.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=17145039|date=2007|last1=Rich|first1=RL|last2=Myszka|first2=DG|title=Higher-throughput, label-free, real-time molecular interaction analysis|volume=361|issue=1|pages=1–6|doi=10.1016/j.ab.2006.10.040|journal=Analytical Biochemistry}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the measurements on SPR can be followed real-time allowing the monitoring of individual steps in sequential binding events particularly useful in the assessment of for instance sandwich complexes.

===Material characterization===
[[Multi-Parametric Surface Plasmon Resonance]], a special configuration of SPR, can be used to characterize layers and stacks of layers. Besides binding kinetics, MP-SPR can also provide information on structural changes in terms of layer true thickness and refractive index. MP-SPR has been applied successfully in measurements of lipid targeting and rupture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Granqvist|first1=Niko|last2=Yliperttula|first2=Marjo|last3=Välimäki|first3=Salla|last4=Pulkkinen|first4=Petri|last5=Tenhu|first5=Heikki|last6=Viitala|first6=Tapani|title=Control of the Morphology of Lipid Layers by Substrate Surface Chemistry|journal=Langmuir|date=18 March 2014|volume=30|issue=10|pages=2799–2809|doi=10.1021/la4046622|pmid=24564782}}&lt;/ref&gt; CVD-deposited single monolayer of graphene (3.7Å)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jussila|first1=Henri|last2=Yang|first2=He|last3=Granqvist|first3=Niko|last4=Sun|first4=Zhipei|title=Surface plasmon resonance for characterization of large-area atomic-layer graphene film|journal=Optica|date=5 February 2016|volume=3|issue=2|pages=151|doi=10.1364/OPTICA.3.000151}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as micrometer thick polymers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Korhonen|first1=Kristiina|last2=Granqvist|first2=Niko|last3=Ketolainen|first3=Jarkko|last4=Laitinen|first4=Riikka|title=Monitoring of drug release kinetics from thin polymer films by multi-parametric surface plasmon resonance|journal=International Journal of Pharmaceutics|date=October 2015|volume=494|issue=1|pages=531–536|doi=10.1016/j.ijpharm.2015.08.071|pmid=26319634}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Data interpretation===
The most common data interpretation is based on the [[Fresnel equations|Fresnel formulas]], which treat the formed thin films as infinite, continuous dielectric layers. This interpretation may result in multiple possible [[refractive index]] and thickness values. However, usually only one solution is within the reasonable data range. In [[Multi-Parametric Surface Plasmon Resonance]], two SPR curves are acquired by scanning a range of angles at two different wavelengths, which results in a unique solution for both thickness and refractive index.

Metal particle plasmons are usually modeled using the [[Mie theory|Mie scattering theory]].

In many cases no detailed models are applied, but the sensors are calibrated for the specific application, and used with [[interpolation]] within the calibration curve.

==Examples==

===Layer-by-layer self-assembly===
[[File:SPR-adsorption-data.png|thumb|SPR curves measured during the adsorption of a [[polyelectrolyte]] and then a [[clay]] mineral [[self-assembly|self-assembled]] film onto a thin (ca. 38 nanometers) gold sensor.]]

One of the first common applications of surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy was the measurement of the thickness (and refractive index) of adsorbed self-assembled nanofilms on gold substrates. The resonance curves shift to higher angles as the thickness of the adsorbed film increases. This example is a 'static SPR' measurement.

When higher speed observation is desired, one can select an angle right below
the resonance point (the angle of minimum reflectance), and measure the reflectivity changes at that point.
This is the so-called 'dynamic SPR' measurement. The interpretation of the data assumes that the structure of the film does not change significantly during the measurement.

===Binding constant determination===
[[File:SPR-curve.png|thumb|Association and dissociation signal]]
[[File:Biacore diagram.jpg|thumb|Example of output from [[Biacore]]]]
When the affinity of two [[ligand]]s has to be determined, the [[binding constant]] must be determined. It is the equilibrium value for the product quotient. This value can also be found using the dynamic SPR parameters and, as in any chemical reaction, it is the dissociation rate divided by the association rate.

For this, a bait ligand is immobilized on the dextran surface of the SPR crystal. Through a [[microfluidics|microflow]] system, a solution with the prey analyte is injected over the bait layer. As the prey analyte binds the bait ligand, an increase in SPR signal (expressed in response units, RU) is observed. After desired association time, a solution without the prey analyte (usually the buffer) is injected on the microfluidics that dissociates the bound complex between bait ligand and prey analyte. Now as the prey analyte dissociates from the bait ligand, a decrease in SPR signal (expressed in resonance units, RU) is observed. From these association ('on rate', {{math|''k''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;}}) and dissociation rates ('off rate', {{math|''k''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;}}), the equilibrium dissociation constant ('binding constant', {{math|''K''&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;}}) can be calculated.

The actual SPR signal can be explained by the electromagnetic 'coupling' of the incident light with the surface plasmon of the gold layer. This plasmon can be influenced by the layer just a few nanometer across the gold–solution interface i.e. the bait protein and possibly the prey protein. Binding makes the reflection angle change;

&lt;math&gt;K_D = \frac{k_{\text{d}}}{k_{\text{a}}}&lt;/math&gt;

===Thermodynamic analysis===
As SPR biosensors facilitate measurements at different temperatures, thermodynamic analysis can be performed
to obtain a better understanding of the studied interaction. By performing measurements at different temperatures,
typically between 4 and 40 °C, it is possible to relate association and dissociation rate constants with activation
energy and thereby obtain thermodynamic parameters including binding enthalpy, binding entropy,
Gibbs free energy and heat capacity.

===Pair-wise epitope mapping===
As SPR allows real-time monitoring, individual steps in sequential binding events can be thoroughly assessed when investigating the suitability between antibodies in a sandwich configuration. Additionally, it allows the mapping of epitopes as antibodies of overlapping epitopes will be associated with an attenuated signal compared to those capable of interacting simultaneously.

==Magnetic plasmon resonance==
Recently, there has been an interest in magnetic surface plasmons. These require materials with large negative magnetic permeability, a property that has only recently been made available with the construction of [[metamaterial]]s.

[[File:Blausen 0801 SkeletalMuscle.png|thumb|300px|[[Skeletal muscle]], with terminal cisterna labeled near bottom.]]
'''Terminal cisternae''' are enlarged areas of the [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]] surrounding the [[transverse tubules]]. These discrete regions within the muscle cell store [[calcium]] (increasing the capacity of the [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]] to release calcium) and release it when an action potential courses down the transverse tubules, eliciting [[muscle contraction]]. Because terminal cisternae ensure rapid calcium delivery, they are well developed in muscles that contract quickly, such as fast twitch [[skeletal muscle]]. Terminal cisternae then go on to release calcium, which binds to troponin. This releases tropomyosin, exposing active sites of the thin filament, actin.

There are several mechanisms directly linked to the terminal cisternae which facilitate Excitation-Contraction coupling. When Excitation of the membrane arrives at the T-tubule nearest the muscle fiber, a Dihydropyridine (DHP) channel is activated. This is similar to a voltage gated calcium channel, but is not actually an ionotropic channel. Instead, it serves to activate Ryanodine, which will let calcium ions pass into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and triggers calcium release to the muscle fiber itself.

A T-tubule surrounded by two terminal cisternae is referred to as a " triad" in physiology. As previously explained, the terminal cisternae along with the transverse tubules are the mechanisms of transduction from a nervous impulse to an actual muscle contraction.

{{Hatnote|[[Potatoes]] are sometimes called just "tubers".}}
[[File:Ullucus tuberosus (South Peru).jpg|right|thumb|Ulluku (''[[Ullucus tuberosus]]'') tubers]]
'''Tubers''' are enlarged structures in some [[plant]] species used as [[storage organ]]s for [[nutrient]]s. They are used for the plant's [[perennation]] (survival of the winter or dry months), to provide energy and nutrients for regrowth during the next growing season, and as a means of [[asexual reproduction]].&lt;ref name="rooting_cuttings_of_tropical_trees"&gt;{{Citation  | title = Rooting cuttings of tropical trees | year = 1994 | publisher = Commonwealth Science Council | location = London  | isbn = 978-0-85092-394-0 | pages = 11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Stem tubers'' form from thickened [[rhizome]]s (underground stems) or [[stolon]]s (horizontal connections between organisms). Common plant species with stem tubers include [[potato]] and [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]]. Some sources also treat modified lateral [[root]]s (''root tubers'') under the definition; these are encountered in [[sweet potato]], [[cassava]], and [[dahlia]].

==Terminology==
The term originates from Latin ''tuber'', meaning "lump, bump, swelling".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=tuber |title=Tuber |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160215121743/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=tuber |archivedate=2016-02-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sources define the term "tuber" to mean only structures derived from [[Plant stem|stems]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Mauseth |first=James D. |title=Botany : An Introduction to Plant Biology | edition=5th | year=2012 |isbn=978-1-4496-6580-7 |publisher=Jones and Bartlett Learning |location=Sudbury, MA}}, p. 672&lt;/ref&gt; others use the term for structures derived from stems or [[root]]s.&lt;ref name=Been10&gt;{{Citation |last=Beentje |first=Henk |year=2010 |title=The Kew Plant Glossary |location=Richmond, Surrey |publisher=[[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]] |isbn=978-1-84246-422-9 }}, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stem tubers == &lt;!-- "Stem tuber" redirects here; do not change section title without fixing this --&gt;
A '''stem tuber''' forms from thickened [[rhizome]]s or [[stolon]]s. The top sides of the tuber produce shoots that grow into typical stems and leaves and the under sides produce roots. They tend to form at the sides of the parent plant and are most often located near the soil surface. The underground stem tuber is normally a short-lived storage and regenerative organ developing from a shoot that branches off a mature plant. The offsprings or new tubers are attached to a parent tuber or form at the end of a hypogeogenous (initiated below ground) rhizome. In the autumn the plant dies, except for the new offspring stem tubers which have one dominant bud, which in spring regrows a new shoot producing stems and leaves, in summer the tubers decay and new tubers begin to grow. Some plants also form smaller tubers and/or [[tubercule]]s which act like seeds, producing small plants that resemble (in morphology and size) seedlings. Some stem tubers are long-lived, such as those of tuberous [[begonia]], but many plants have tubers that survive only until the plants have fully leafed out, at which point the tuber is reduced to a shriveled-up husk.

[[File:Starr 010725-9001 Anredera cordifolia.jpg|thumb|upright|Flowers and tuber of ''Anredera cordifolia'']]

Stem tubers generally start off as enlargements of the [[hypocotyl]] section of a seedling but also sometimes include the first node or two of the [[epicotyl]] and the upper section of the root. The stem tuber has a vertical orientation with one or a few vegetative buds on the top and fibrous roots produced on the bottom from a basal section, typically the stem tuber has an oblong rounded shape.

The tuber has all the parts of a normal stem, including nodes and internodes. The nodes are the eyes and each has a leaf scar. The nodes or eyes are arranged around the tuber in a spiral fashion beginning on the end opposite the attachment point to the stolon. The terminal bud is produced at the farthest point away from the stolon attachment and tubers thus show the same [[apical dominance]] as a normal stem. Internally, a tuber is filled with starch stored in enlarged [[parenchyma]] like cells. The inside of a tuber has the typical cell structures of any stem, including a pith, vascular zones, and a cortex.

The tuber is produced in one growing season and used to perennate the plant and as a means of [[Plant propagation|propagation]]. When fall comes, the above-ground structure of the plant dies, but the tubers survive over winter underground until spring, when they regenerate new shoots that use the stored food in the tuber to grow. As the main shoot develops from the tuber, the base of the shoot close to the tuber produces adventitious roots and lateral buds on the shoot. The shoot also produces stolons that are long [[etiolated]] stems. The stolon elongates during long days with the presence of high [[auxins]] levels that prevent root growth off of the stolon. Before new tuber formation begins, the stolon must be a certain age. The enzyme lipoxygenase makes a hormone, [[jasmonic acid]], which is involved in the control of potato tuber development.

The stolons are easily recognized when potato plants are grown from seeds. As the plants grow, stolons are produced around the soil surface from the nodes. The tubers form close to the soil surface and sometimes even on top of the ground. When potatoes are cultivated, the tubers are cut into pieces and planted much deeper into the soil. Planting the pieces deeper creates more area for the plants to generate the tubers and their size increases. The pieces sprout shoots that grow to the surface. These shoots are rhizome-like and generate short stolons from the nodes while in the ground.  When the shoots reach the soil surface, they produce roots and shoots that grow into the green plant.

== Root tubers == &lt;!-- "Root tuber" redirects here! Do not change section title without fixing this. --&gt;
[[File:Ipomoea batatasL ja01.jpg|thumb|350px|Freshly dug sweet potato plants with tubers.]]
A '''tuberous root''' or storage root, is a modified lateral [[root]], enlarged to function as a [[storage organ]]. The  enlarged area of the root-tuber, or storage root, can be produced at the end or middle of a root or involve the entire root. It is thus different in origin but similar in function and appearance to a stem tuber. Examples of plants with notable tuberous roots include the [[sweet potato]], [[cassava]], and [[dahlia]].

Root tubers are [[perennating organ]]s, thickened roots that store nutrients over periods when the plant cannot actively grow, thus permitting survival from one year to the next. The massive enlargement of secondary roots typically represented by sweet potato (''[[Ipomoea batatas]]''), have the internal and external cell and tissue structures of a normal root, they produce [[adventitious roots]] and stems which again produce adventitious roots.&lt;ref name=Davis1994&gt;{{Citation| last1 = Davis | first1 = Edited by Tim D.| last2 = Haissig | first2 = Bruce E.| year = 1994| title = Biology of adventitious root formation| volume = | pages = 17 | isbn = 978-0-306-44627-6| publisher = Plenum Press| location = New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In root-tubers, there are no nodes and internodes or reduced leaves. Root tubers have one end called the proximal end, which is the end that was attached to the old plant; this end has crown tissue that produces buds which grow into new stems and foliage.&lt;ref name=Kyte1996&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Kyte | first1 = Lydiane | last2 = Kleyn | first2 = John | year = 1996 | title = Plants from test tubes : an introduction to micropropagation | volume =  | pages = 23–24 | isbn = 978-0-88192-361-2 | publisher = Timber Press | location = Portland, Or. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The other end of the root tuber is called the distal end, and it normally produces unmodified roots. In stem tubers the order is reversed, with the distal end producing stems. Tuberous roots are biennial in duration: the first year the plant produces root-tubers, and at the end of the growing season, the plant shoots often die, leaving the newly generated tubers. The next growing season, the root-tubers produce new shoots. As the shoots of the new plant grow, the stored reserves of the root-tuber are consumed in the production of new roots, stems, and reproductive organs; any remaining root tissue dies concurrently to the plant's regeneration of next generation of root-tubers.

''[[Hemerocallis fulva]]'' plus a number of Daylily hybrids have large root-tubers, ''H. fulva'' spreads by underground stolons&lt;ref&gt;{{eFloras|2|200027676|Hemerocallis fulva |last1=Chen |first1=Xinqi |first2=Junko |last2=Noguchi |volume=24 |accessdate=27 April 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114001709/http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=2&amp;taxon_id=200027676 |archivedate=14 November 2016 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that end with a new fan that grows roots that produce thick root tubers and then send out more stolons.&lt;ref name=Mansfeld2001&gt;{{Citation| last = Mansfeld | first =  Rudolf| year = 2001| title = Mansfeld's Encyclopedia of agricultural and horticultural crops| pages = 2231| isbn = 978-3-540-41017-1| publisher = Springe | location = Berlin }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://sain.utk.edu/invasives/species32.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

Root tubers, along with other storage tissues that plants produce, are consumed by animals as a rich source of nutrients. The root-tubers of Arrowhead plants of the genus ''[[Sagittaria]]'' are eaten by ducks.&lt;ref name=Hammerson2004&gt;{{Citation | last = Hammerson | first =  Geoffrey A. | year = 2004 | title = Connecticut wildlife : biodiversity, natural history, and conservation | volume =  | pages = 89 | isbn = 978-1-58465-369-1 | publisher = University Press of New England | location = Hanover }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plants with root tubers are propagated in late summer to late winter by digging up the tubers and separating them, making sure that each piece has some crown tissue for replanting.

'''VERB''' was a [[physical activity]] program of the [[Center for Disease Control and Prevention]] of the [[United States Government]]. It included print, [[internet|online]], and [[television]] national paid advertising, running them on popular children's channels and popular children's magazines, for example. It ran from 2002 to 2006. The main goal of the VERB campaign was to increase and maintain physical activity among “tweens” (children ages 9–13). The campaign is based upon social marketing principles (produce, price, place and promotion) and culturally targets this age group. It encourages life style changes such as playing more and “trying new verbs.” &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Huhman|first = Marian E.|last2 = Potter|first2 = Lance D.|last3 = Duke|first3 = Jennifer C.|last4 = Judkins|first4 = David R.|last5 = Heitzler|first5 = Carrie D.|last6 = Wong|first6 = Faye L.|title = Evaluation of a National Physical Activity Intervention for Children|url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0749379706004077|journal = American Journal of Preventive Medicine|volume = 32|issue = 1|pages = 38–43|doi = 10.1016/j.amepre.2006.08.030}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An evaluation of the program in 2004 found it to have an expansive reach. Among exposed children, 96% reported understanding of at least one key campaign message. Children who reported being aware of the VERB campaign engaged in 3.9 weekly sessions of free-time activity while children with no VERB awareness reported 3 sessions of physical activity. This is a 22% differences between the VERB aware and unaware.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2004, an additional program called "VERB Summer Scorecard" emerged from the national VERB campaign. VERB Summer Scorecard was developed first launched by ''Fit Kentucky'' and the Lexington Fayette County Health Department (creating the Lexington Tweens Nutrition and Fitness Coalition). It has since been adapted and disseminated in 22 communities including cities in Florida, Nebraska, Iowa and Colorado. VERB Summer Scorecard promotes and incentivizes physical activity opportunities by creating a “passport” (scorecard) system for children to track their physical activity. It creates “activity-friendly communities” to facilitate exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2011/sep/10_0173.htm|title = Preventing Chronic Disease: September 2011: 10_0173|website = www.cdc.gov|access-date = 2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''white box system''' is a mechanical system installed in the [[engine room]] of a [[ship]] for controlling and monitoring the engine room [[bilge]] water discharge from the vessel.

The system consists of all vital components for monitoring and controlling the discharge from the vessel's [[Oily Water Separator (marine)|oily water separator]]. The white box includes a stainless steel cage with a locked door. The [[bilge water]] from the oily water separator is pumped through the white box and analyzed by an oil content meter. A flow switch secures that there is flow through the oil content meter and a flow meter counts the accumulated discharged overboard volume. If the door is opened, the oil content exceeds the legal limit of 15 parts per million (PPM) or the flow to the oil content meter is lost the three way valve will immediately redirect the bilge water back to the bilge water holding tank. All components inside the system are connected to a digital recorder mounted in the engine control room that records the oil content, three way valve position, flow through oil content meter, accumulated discharged volume, door position together with the vessels geographical position and time. The chief engineer possesses the key and when locked, the system [[tamper resistance | cannot be tampered with]] and equally importantly provides the evidence that the vessel has been compliant. The recorder data is stored in an encrypted format and can be presented to any official body such as [[Port State Control]], [[United States Coast Guard]], [[Vetting]] or [[Classification society]] officials to prove that the vessel has been compliant to [[MARPOL 73/78]] (the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution From Ships) or any national regulation, and that no illegal discharge has been made.

'''Windycon''' is a [[science fiction convention]] held in [[Lombard, Illinois]], on the weekend closest to [[Veterans Day (United States)|Veterans Day]].

[[ISFiC]], the parent corporation that runs Windycon,&lt;ref name="pavlac"&gt;Pavlac, Ross, [http://www.isfic.org/WhatIs.asp What's an ISFiC], ISFiC Web Site, retrieved, 2015-11-10&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 1973 in Chicago. The first Windycon was held the following year and has been held annually ever since either in Chicago or a Chicago suburb.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isfic.org/conspast.asp The Windycon Big List], Windycon Web Site, retrieved, 2007-05-19&lt;/ref&gt; It is a general interest convention.

ISFiC and Windycon were founded to raise the profile of fandom in Chicago in preparation for a [[Worldcon]] bid.&lt;ref name="pavlac"/&gt;  In 1982, Chicon IV was the result.  From its small beginnings, Windycon has grown to have an annual membership hovering around 1300.  It is the largest of the two fan-run Chicago conventions.

Annually since 1986, ISFiC has hosted a writers contest, open to unpublished authors.  The contest is judged by professional authors and editors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isfic.org/Winners.asp|title=ISFiC, Inc.:  Writers Contest Winners|website=www.isfic.org|accessdate=15 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Separately, Windycon has hosted a writers' workshop under the coordination of [[Richard Chwedyk]] since 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Foster | first = Adrienne | title = Next Manuscript, Please: Amazing Tales of the Worldcon Writers Workshop | newspaper = SFWA Bulletin | pages = 10  | date = August–September 2009 | accessdate = 2009-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to traditional con activities, Windycon has also run a series of on-line chats during the con, hosting by Cybling.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Janice, [http://cybling.hypermart.net/windycon/index.html Windycon 26 Chats], Cybling, retrieved, 2007-05-19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Janice, [http://www.cybling.com/conventions/windyconxxix/chats.html Windycon 29 Chats], Cybling, retrieved, 2007-05-19&lt;/ref&gt;
