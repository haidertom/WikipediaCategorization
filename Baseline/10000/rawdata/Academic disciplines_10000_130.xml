'''Afrofuturism''' is a cultural [[aesthetic]], philosophy of science, and philosophy of history that explores the developing intersection of African/African Diaspora culture with technology. It combines elements of [[science fiction]], [[historical fiction]], [[fantasy]], [[Afrocentrism]] and [[magic realism]] with non-Western [[Cosmology|cosmologies]] in order to critique the present-day dilemmas of [[black people]] and to interrogate and re-examine historical events. It was coined by Mark Dery in 1994 and explored in the late 1990s through conversations led by [[Alondra Nelson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Rambsy II| first = Howard| title = A Notebook on Afrofuturism| work = Cultural Front| accessdate = 2014-03-26| date = 2012-04-14| url = http://www.culturalfront.org/2012/04/notebook-on-afrofuturism.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afrofuturism addresses themes and concerns of the [[African diaspora]] through a [[technoculture]] and [[science fiction]] lens, encompassing a range of media and artists with a shared interest in envisioning black futures that stem from Afrodiasporic experiences.&lt;ref name="history-future"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yaszek|first=Lisa|title=Afrofuturism, science fiction, and the history of the future|url=http://sdonline.org/42/afrofuturism-science-fiction-and-the-history-of-the-future/|journal=Socialism and Democracy|date=November 2006|volume=20|issue=3|pages=41–60|doi=10.1080/08854300600950236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seminal Afrofuturistic works include the novels of [[Samuel R.

==History==
===Mid-late 20th century development===
Despite Afrofuturism being coined in 1993, scholars tend to agree that Afrofuturistic music, art and text became more common and widespread in the late 1950s. The Afrofuturist approach to music was first propounded by [[Sun Ra]]. Born in Alabama, Sun Ra's music coalesced in Chicago in the mid-1950s, when with the Arkestra he began recording music that drew from [[hard bop]] and modal sources, creating a new synthesis that used [[Afrocentrism|Afrocentric]] and space-themed titles to reflect Ra's linkage of ancient African culture, specifically [[Afrocentrism#Egypt and the argument of African cultural unity|Egypt]], and the cutting edge of the [[Space Age]]. For many years, Ra and his bandmates lived, worked and performed in Philadelphia while touring festivals worldwide. Ra's film ''[[Space Is the Place]]'' shows The Arkestra in Oakland in the mid-1970s in full space regalia, replete with science-fiction imagery as well as other comedic and musical material. As of 2018, the band was still composing and performing, under the leadership of [[Marshall Allen]]. 

Afrofuturist ideas were taken up in 1975 by [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]] and his bands [[Parliament (band)|Parliament]] and [[Funkadelic]] with his magnum opus ''[[Mothership Connection]]'' and the subsequent ''[[The Clones of Dr. Funkenstein]]'', [[P-Funk Earth Tour]], ''[[Funkentelechy Vs. the Placebo Syndrome]]'', and ''[[Motor Booty Affair]]''. In the thematic underpinnings to [[P-Funk mythology]] ("pure cloned funk"), Clinton in his alter ego ''Starchild'' spoke of "certified Afronauts, capable of funkitizing galaxies".

Other musicians typically regarded as working in or greatly influenced by the Afrofuturist tradition include reggae producers [[Lee "Scratch" Perry]] and [[Scientist (musician)|Scientist]], hip-hop artists [[Afrika Bambaataa]] and [[Tricky (musician)|Tricky]], electronic musicians [[Larry Heard]], [[A Guy Called Gerald]], [[Juan Atkins]], [[Jeff Mills]],&lt;ref name=reddell&gt;{{cite journal |last=Reddell |first=Trace|year=2013 |title=Ethnoforgery and Outsider Afrofuturism |url=https://dj.dancecult.net/index.php/dancecult/article/view/376/392 |journal=Dancecult |publisher=[[Griffith University]] ePress |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=89–90 |doi=10.12801/1947-5403.2013.05.02.05 |accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Newcleus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/forever-out-there-25-contributors-to-the-space-disco-era-1976-1986/P2/ |title=Forever Out There: 25 Contributors to the Space Disco Era 1976–1986 |last1=Loudermilk |first1=A. |date=3 October 2016 |website=[[PopMatters]] |access-date=23 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lotti Golden]] &amp; Richard Scher, electro hip hop producer/writers of [[Warp 9]]'s "[[Light Years Away (Warp 9 song)|Light Years Away]]", a sci-fi tale of ancient alien visitation, described as a "cornerstone of early 80's beatbox afrofuturism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Fitzpatrick |first=Rob |title=The 101 strangest records on Spotify: Warp 9 – It's A Beat Wave |date=May 14, 2014 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/14/the-101-strangest-records-on-spotify-warp-9-its-a-beat-wave |work=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural criticism in the 1990s===
In the early 1990s, a number of [[cultural critic]]s, notably [[Mark Dery]] in his 1994 essay "Black to the Future", began to write about the features they saw as common in African-American science fiction, music, and art. Dery dubbed this phenomenon "Afrofuturism".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dery|first=Mark|date=1994|title=Black to the Future: Interviews with Samuel R. Delany, Greg Tate, and Tricia Rose|url=https://www.kit.ntnu.no/sites/www.kit.ntnu.no/files/Black%20to%20the%20Future%20(Dery)_0.pdf|journal=Flame Wars: The Discourse of Cyberculture|location=Durham, NC|publisher=Duke University Press|page=180|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to cultural critic [[Kodwo Eshun]], British journalist [[Mark Sinker]] was theorizing a form of Afrofuturism in the pages of ''[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]'', a British music magazine, as early as 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sinker|first=Mark|date=February 1992|title=Black Science Fiction|url=http://www.exacteditions.com/read/the-wire/february-1992-(issue-96)-35378/30/2/|journal=The Wire|publisher=Exact Editions Ltd.|page=30|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afrofuturist ideas have further been expanded by scholars like [[Alondra Nelson]], [[Greg Tate]], [[Tricia Rose]], [[Kodwo Eshun]], and others.&lt;ref name=history-future /&gt; In an interview, Alondra Nelson explained Afrofuturism as a way of looking at the subject position of black people which covers themes of alienation and aspirations for a utopic future. The idea of "alien" or "other" is a theme often explored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | people = Alondra Nelson (Interviewee) | title = Afrofuturism |medium = Youtube | year = 2010 | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFhEjaal5js}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Nelson notes that discussions around race, access, and technology often bolster uncritical claims about a so-called "[[digital divide]]".&lt;ref name="Nelson-Intro"&gt;{{Cite journal | issn = 1527-1951 | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 1–15 | last = Nelson | first = Alondra | title = Introduction: Future Texts | journal = Social Text: Special Issue on Afrofuturism | accessdate = 2014-03-16 | year = 2002 | url = http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/social_text/v020/20.2nelson01.html | doi=10.1215/01642472-20-2_71-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The digital divide overemphasizes the association of racial and economic inequality with limited access to technology.  This association then begins to construct blackness "as always oppositional to technologically driven chronicles of progress".&lt;ref name=Nelson-Intro /&gt; As a critique of the neo-critical argument that the future's history-less identities will end burdensome stigma, Afrofuturism holds that history should remain a part of identity, particularly in terms of race.&lt;ref name=Nelson-Intro /&gt;

===21st century===

A new generation of recording artists have embraced Afrofuturism into their music and fashion, including [[Solange Knowles|Solange]], [[Rihanna]], and [[Beyoncé]]. This tradition continues from artists such as [[Erykah Badu]], [[Missy Elliott]] and [[Janelle Monáe]], who incorporated cyborg themes and metallics into their style.&lt;ref name="La Ferla"&gt;{{cite news|last1=La Ferla|first1=Ruth|title=Afrofuturism: The Next Generation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/12/fashion/afrofuturism-the-next-generation.html?_r=0|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=12 December 2016|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Other 21st century musicians who have been characterized as Afrofuturist include singer [[FKA Twigs]],&lt;ref name="La Ferla"/&gt; musical duo [[Ibeyi]],&lt;ref name="Frank"/&gt; and DJ/producer [[Ras G]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jul/24/space-is-the-place-flying-lotus-janelle-monae-afrofuturism|title=Afrofuturism takes flight: from Sun Ra to Janelle Monáe|last=Bakare|first=Lanre|date=2014-07-24|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=2017-03-14|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In more recent years, artists such as Rihanna and Beyoncé have often been interpreted by the public as having some non-human elements about them, exhibited in both their performances, and in their day to day interactions. Because the tabloids have so much control over the way that information is digested, the public receives images of these women that are distant and controlled solely by the media, and thus, these women are often painted as angry or unfeeling. Scholars such as Robin James have interrogated and expanded upon the work of Kodwo Eshun, and coined the idea of the "robo-diva". These scholars both argue that the Black experience has always been more alien than it has been human, and James connects the mechanics of the middle passage to alien abduction through concepts of kidnapping, isolation, and bowing down to an unknown power. Kodwo Eshun also posits that perhaps the categorization of "human" has no use in the Black community, and that instead, the category of "robot" is not only more powerful, but more accurately representative of the positioning in the social hierarchy in which Black people exist in the present day. Because musical artists (Rihanna, Beyoncé) exhibit such non-human qualities, they are often ostracized for being "cold" or "mechanical". The white patriarchy both fears and admires such artists due to their unapologetic displays of female sexuality and its interactions with technology. These fears then propel the virgin/whore dichotomy that stems from the trope of the Jezebel, and serves to further the racialized projections of stereotypes onto Black females in the music industry.

[[Janelle Monáe]] has made a conscious effort to restore Afrofuturist cosmology to the forefront of urban contemporary music. Her notable works include the music videos "Prime Time"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=janellemonae|title=Janelle Monáe – PrimeTime ft. Miguel [Official Video]|date=2013-10-10|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oxls2xX0Clg|accessdate=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Many Moons",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHgbzNHVg0c|title=Janelle Monae - Many Moons [Official Short Film]|first=|last=Janelle Monáe|date=3 October 2008|publisher=|accessdate=21 April 2018|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; which explore the realms of slavery and freedom through the world of cyborgs and the fashion industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ebony.com/entertainment-culture/black-alt-enter-afrofuturism-999#axzz2nJVuzcgO/|title= [BLACK ALT] What Is Afrofuturism?|last = Gonzales |first = Michael A.|date=1 October 2013|work=Ebony|accessdate=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Calveri | first = John | title = Janelle Monáe: A New Pioneer of Afrofuturism | work = The Quietus | accessdate = 2014-03-16 | date = 2010-09-02 | url = http://thequietus.com/articles/04889-janelle-mon-e-the-archandroid-afrofuturism}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is credited with proliferating Afrofuturist funk into a new Neo-Afrofuturism by use of her [[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]-inspired alter-ego, ''Cindi Mayweather,'' who incites a rebellion against the Great Divide, a secret society, in order to liberate citizens who have fallen under their oppression. This ArchAndroid role reflects earlier Afrofuturistic figures Sun Ra and George Clinton, who created their own visuals as extraterrestrial beings rescuing African-Americans from the oppressive natures of Earth.

Chicago is home to a vibrant community of artists exploring Afrofuturism. [[Nick Cave (performance artist)|Nick Cave]], known for his Soundsuits project, has helped develop younger talent as the director of the graduate fashion program at the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]]. Other artists include visual artists Hebru Brantley as well as contemporary artist [[Rashid Johnson]], a Chicago native currently based in New York. In 2013, Chicago resident Ytasha L.

== Literature ==

The creation of the term Afrofuturism in the 1990s was often primarily used to categorize "speculative fiction that treats African-American themes and addresses African-American concerns in the context of 20th-century technoculture,"&lt;ref name="Bould"&gt;Bould, Mark. "The Ships Landed Long Ago: Afrofuturism and Black SF." ''Science Fiction Studies'' 34.2 (July 2007): 177–186. {{JSTOR|4241520}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was soon expanded to include artistic, scientific, and spiritual practices throughout the [[African diaspora]]. Contemporary practice retroactively identifies and documents historical instances of Afrofuturist practice and integrates them into the canon. For example, the [[Dark Matter (series)|Dark Matter]] anthologies edited by [[Sheree Thomas]] feature contemporary [[Black science fiction]], discuss Ralph Ellison's [[Invisible Man]] in her introduction, "Looking for the Invisible," and also include older works by [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], [[Charles W. Chesnutt]], and [[George S. Schuyler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thomas |first=Sheree|authorlink=Sheree Thomas |editor-first=Sheree |editor-last=Thomas |title=Dark Matter: A Century of Speculative Fiction from the African Diaspora |year=2000|publisher=Warner Aspect |isbn=0446525839}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lisa Yazsek argues that [[Ralph Ellison]]'s 1952 novel, ''[[Invisible Man]]'', should be thought of as a predecessor to Afrofuturist literature. Yaszek illustrates that Ellison draws upon Afrofuturist ideas that were not yet prevalent in African-American literature. Ellison critiques the traditional visions of black people's future in the United States, but does not provide readers a different future to imagine. Yaszek believes that Ellison does not offer any other futures so that the next generation of authors can. ''Invisible Man'' may not be Afrofuturist in the sense that it does not provide a better – or even any –  future for black people in the United States, but it can be thought of as a call for people to start thinking and creating art with an Afrofuturist mindset. In this sense, Yaszek concludes that Ellison's novel is a canon in Afrofuturistic literature by serving as call for "this kind of future-historical art" to those who succeed him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yaszek|first=Lisa|year=2005|title=An Afrofuturist Reading of Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man|url=http://www.wright.edu/~david.wilson/eng2050/afrofuturistreading.pdf|journal=Rethinking History|volume=9|issue=2–3|pages=297–313|doi=10.1080/13642520500149202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of contemporary [[Black science fiction]] and speculative fiction authors have also been characterized as Afrofuturist or as employing Afrofuturist themes. [[Nnedi Okorafor]] has been labeled this way, both for her [[Hugo Award for Best Novella|Hugo Award]]-winning [[Binti (novel)|Binti]] novella series,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/25/14384030/nnedi-okorafor-binti-home-afrofuturist-science-fiction-review|title=The Binti novellas are fun, bite-sized stories of interstellar Afrofuturism|date=2017-01-25|website=The Verge|access-date=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for her novel ''[[Who Fears Death]]''.&lt;ref name="Frank"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/your-far-out-guide-to-afrofuturism-and-black-magic_us_5711403fe4b0060ccda34a37|title=Your Brief And Far-Out Guide To Afrofuturism|last=Frank|first=Priscilla|date=2016-04-25|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2017-03-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steven Barnes]] has been called an Afrofuturist author for his alternate-history novels ''[[Lion's Blood]]'' and ''[[Zulu Heart]]''.&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt; [[N.

"Loving the Alien."

"A Memorial to Octavia E. Butler." ''Science Fiction Studies'' 37.3 (November 2010): 353–361. {{JSTOR|25746438}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the fourth book of the science fiction [[Patternist series]], ''[[Wild Seed (novel)|Wild Seed]]'', particularly fits ideas of Afrofuturist thematic concerns, as the narrative of two immortal Africans Doro and Anyanwu features science fiction technologies and an alternate anti-colonialist history of seventeenth century America.&lt;ref name="Canavan"&gt;Canavan, Gerry.

===The grotesque===

In the Afro-Surreal Manifesto, [[Afro-Surrealism]] is juxtaposed with European surrealism, with European surrealism being empirical. It is consistent with the New Black Aesthetic in that the art seeks to disturb. It samples from old art pieces updating them with current images. This technique calls to the forefront those past images and the sentiments, memories, or ideas around them and combines them with new images in a way that those of the current generation can still identify. Both seek to disturb, but there is more of a "mutant" psychology that is going on. Afro-Futuristic artists seek to propose a deviant beauty, a beauty in which disembodiment is both inhumane, yet distinct; Afro-Futuristic artists speculate on the future, where Afro-Surrealism is about the present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller|first=D.

===Alienation===
Afrofuturism takes representations of the lived realities of black people in the past and present, and reexamines the narratives to attempt to build new truths outside of the dominant cultural narrative. By analyzing the ways in which alienation has occurred, Afrofuturism works to connect the African diaspora with its histories and knowledge of racialized bodies. Space and aliens function as key products of the science fiction elements; black people are envisioned to have been the first aliens by way of the [[Middle Passage]]. Their alien status connotes being in a foreign land with no history, but as also being disconnected from the past via the traditions of slavery where slaves were made to renounce their ties to Africa in service of their slave master.&lt;ref name="Mayer"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mayer|first=Ruth|date=2000|year=|title='Africa As an Alien Future': The Middle Passage, Afrofuturism, and Postcolonial Waterworlds|journal=Amerikastudien / American Studies|volume=45|issue=4|pages=558|jstor=41157608}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kodwo Eshun]] locates the first alienation within the context of the Middle Passage. He writes that Afrofuturist texts work to reimagine slavery and alienation by using "extraterrestriality as a hyperbolic trope to explore the historical terms, the everyday implications of forcibly imposed dislocation, and the constitution of Black Atlantic subjectivities". This location of dystopian futures and present realities places science fiction and novels built around dystopian societies directly in the tradition of black realities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eshun|first=Kodwo|authorlink=Kodwo Eshun|title=Further Considerations of Afrofuturism|journal=CR: The New Centennial Review|volume=3|issue=2|year=2003|pages=287–302|doi=10.1353/ncr.2003.0021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Water ===
In Afrofuturism, water in many different works symbolizes both erasure and the existence of black life. These dual meanings while seemingly contradictory actually play off and inform each other. For instance, the middle passage can be considered where the first erasure happened of African- American history. There are no stories that survived that passage. As Ruth Mayer states, in the United States, "black history is both there and not there, evident in countless traces, scars, and memories, yet largely submerged when it comes to written accounts and first person documentations of the past from the viewpoint of the victims."&lt;ref name="Mayer"/&gt; Yet, it is through this erasure that Afrofuturism is able to craft histories. These histories live both in fact and in fiction, as the true history was lost in the waters of the Atlantic. Water erased the history, but it also allowed for the creation of a new history.

This is where Afrofuturism comes into play. To have a future, one's past must be defined. However, for African Americans, though their "history" has been drowned, Afrofuturism resuscitates this history. By its creation, it creates new possibilities for the future. In [[Carrie Mae Weems]]' triptych ''Untitled'' (Ebo Landing), the Afrofuturism piece crafts a space with two pictures that could be both African and America with its depiction of lush greenery. In this way, the piece highlights how the original space of water has given way in which Afrofuturism can imagine a past or future that lives in the space of truth and fiction, the Schrödinger's cat of African American past.

Another example of an Afrofuturist work that deals specifically with the theme of water is 2009 film ''[[Pumzi]]'', which depicts an enclosed society in which water is utterly scarce and totally conserved. The film's ambiguous ending leaves viewers wondering whether there was a neighboring society with access to water the whole time, or if the main character has died a heroine by planting a tree that will eventually bloom into a whole forest.

=== Reclamation ===
Ostensibly, Afrofuturism has to do with reclaiming the lost identities or lost perspectives that have been subverted or overlooked. When Mark Dery first coined the term, he says Afrofuturism as "giving rise to a troubling antinomy". This means that the seeming contradiction of a past being snuffed out and the writing of a future sees its possibilities in Afrofuturism. Furthermore, this Afrofuturism kind of story telling is not regulated to one aspect of communication. It is in novels and essays, academic writings and in music, but by its creation, it is ultimately reclaiming some type of autonomy over one's story that has historically been restricted.

Therefore, when Afrofuturism manifests itself in the music of the 80's and beyond, it is under the Afrofuturist's sensibility. It is in this way that, as Mark Dery says, "African-American culture is Afrofuturist at its heart". Because the ancestors of African Americans were forcibly removed from their history, any culture that has found its way into the Black lexicon is at its roots an Afrofuturist notion. It is at its heart reclaiming a past erased and creating a future based on that reimagined past.

Afrofuturism 2.0 was coined during an exchange between Alondra Nelson and Reynaldo Anderson at the Alien Bodies conference in 2013; where Anderson noted that the previous definition was insufficient due to the rise of social media and new technology. Following the publication of the co-edited volume Afrofuturism 2.0: The Rise of Astro-Blackness, in the late 2010s, the ''Black Speculative Arts Movement'', a traveling art, comic, and film convention, released a manifesto called ''Afrofuturism 2.0 and the Black Speculative Arts Movement: Notes on a Manifesto''.&lt;ref name="BSAM Manifesto"&gt;{{cite web |first=Reynaldo  |last=Anderson |title=Afrofuturism 2.0 and the Black Speculative Arts Movement: NOTES ON A MANIFESTO |website=Black Speculative Arts Movement |url=https://blackspeculativeartsmovement.wordpress.com/bsam-manifesto/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manifesto was written by Reynaldo Anderson at Harris-Stowe State University as an attempt to redefine and refit Afrofuturism for the 21st century. The 2.0 volume and the manifesto defines Afrofuturism 2.0 as "The early twenty-first century technogenesis of Black identity reflecting counter histories, hacking and or appropriating the influence of network software, database logic, cultural analytics, deep remixability, neurosciences, enhancement and augmentation, gender fluidity, posthuman possibility, the speculative sphere with transdisciplinary applications and has grown into an important Diasporic techno-cultural Pan African movement".&lt;ref name="BSAM Manifesto"/&gt; Afrofuturism 2.0 is characterized by five dimensions to include metaphysics, aesthetics, theoretical and applied science, social sciences and programmatic spaces; and in the twenty-first century is no longer bound to its original definition, as a term once dealing with cultural aesthetics and the digital divide, but has been broaden to be known also as a philosophy of science, metaphysics and geopolitics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Anderson|first1=Reynaldo|title=Afrofuturism: The Digital Turn and the Visual Art of Kanye West|url=http://people.exeter.ac.uk/sr436/Visual%20Art%20of%20Kanye%20West.pdf|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|accessdate=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this manifesto, Anderson acknowledges and accounts for the changes in technology, social movements, and even philosophical changes in modern society while also speculating as to how the Afrofuturist narrative will be changed because of it. This is particularly in regards to the rise and boom of social media platforms.

In conjunction with this, Los Angeles-based artist [[Martine Syms]] penned an online article in 2013 called ''The Mundane Afrofuturist Manifesto'' that is composed of a list of tenets that, supposedly, all Mundane Afrofuturists recognize. Though the article is in part parodic and sarcastic, it aims to identify and make light of overused tropes within Afrofuturist works like "magical Negroes" or "references to Sun Ra". Through this identification of "overused tropes" and a later definition of rules to actually subvert these tropes entitled "The Mundane Afrofuturist promise",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rhizome.org/editorial/2013/dec/17/mundane-afrofuturist-manifesto/|title=The Mundane Afrofuturist Manifesto|last=Syms|first=Martine|date=December 17, 2013|website=Rhizome|access-date=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Syms requests a new, updated vision for Afrofuturist works, which falls in line with the framework of Afrofuturism 2.0.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15380">'''Alternatives assessment''' or '''alternatives analysis''' is a problem-solving approach used in [[environmental design]], [[environmental technology|technology]], and [[environmental policy|policy]]. It aims to minimize environmental harm by comparing multiple potential solutions in the context of a specific problem, design goal, or policy objective. It is intended to inform decision-making in situations with many possible courses of action, a wide range of variables to consider, and significant degrees of uncertainty. Alternatives assessment was originally developed as a robust way to guide [[Precautionary principle|precautionary]] action and avoid [[Analysis paralysis|paralysis by analysis]]; authors such as O'Brien have presented alternatives assessment as an approach that is complementary to [[risk assessment]], the dominant decision-making approach in environmental policy.&lt;ref name="obrien_2000"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = MIT Press| isbn = 0-262-15051-4| last = O'Brien| first = Mary| title = Making better environmental decisions: An alternative to risk assessment| location = Cambridge| date = 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Ashford has described the similar concept of ''technology options analysis'' as a way to generate innovative solutions to the problems of industrial pollution more effectively than through risk-based regulation.&lt;ref name="ashford_1994"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Resources for the Future| isbn = 0-915707-74-8| pages = 275–314| editor = Adam M.

Alternatives assessment is practiced in a variety of settings, including but not limited to [[green chemistry]], [[sustainable design]], supply-chain chemicals management, and chemicals policy.&lt;ref name="geiser_2015"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = The MIT Press| isbn = 978-0-262-51206-0| last = Geiser| first = Ken| title = Chemicals without harm: Policies for a sustainable world| location = Cambridge, Mass.| series = Urban and industrial environments| date = 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One prominent application area for alternatives assessment is the substitution of hazardous chemicals with safer alternatives, also known as chemical alternatives assessment.&lt;ref name="harrison_hester"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Royal Society of Chemistry| isbn = 978-1-84973-723-4| editor = Roy M. Harrison| editor2 = Ronald E. Hester| title = Chemical alternatives assessments| location = Cambridge| series = Issues in Environmental Science and Technology| date = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodology ==

Generally, alternatives assessment involves considering a number of possible options to achieve a specific objective, and applying a principled comparative analysis. The objective is usually to improve the environmental performance or safety of a specific product, material, process, or other activity. Potential alternatives considered in the analysis may include different chemical substances, materials, technologies, methods of use, or even extensive redesign to enable new ways of achieving the objective while avoiding the problem. Understanding the consequences of each available option is central to the process and goals of alternatives assessment, because this helps avoid decisions that substitute one problem with another (unknown) problem. The comparative analysis can involve any number of criteria for evaluating options, and these are typically focused on environmental health and sustainability.&lt;ref name="lowell_fwk"&gt;{{Cite conference| publisher = Lowell Center for Sustainable Production| last1 = Rossi| first1 = Mark| last2 = Tickner| first2 = Joel| last3 = Geiser| first3 = Ken| title = Alternatives assessment framework of the Lowell Center for Sustainable Production| location = Lowell, MA| url=http://www.sustainableproduction.org/downloads/FinalAltsAssess06_000.pdf| date = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no single protocol that dictates how options should be identified, evaluated, and compared in an alternatives assessment. Rather, a number of different alternatives assessment ''frameworks'' exist, which serve to structure decision-making and to enable systematic consideration of the key factors. Jacobs and colleagues identify six major components of alternatives assessment: evaluation of [[Hazard (risk)|hazard]], exposure, [[Life-cycle assessment|life cycle]] impacts, technical feasibility, and economic feasibility; and an overall decision-making strategy.&lt;ref name="jacobs_2016"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1289/ehp.1409581| issn = 0091-6765| volume = 124| issue = 3| last1 = Jacobs| first1 = Molly M.| last2 = Malloy| first2 = Timothy F.| last3 = Tickner| first3 = Joel A.| last4 = Edwards| first4 = Sally| title = Alternatives assessment frameworks: Research needs for the informed substitution of hazardous chemicals| journal = Environmental Health Perspectives| date = 2016-03-01| pmid=26339778| pmc=4786344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One major framework, the [https://www.uml.edu/research/lowell-center/ Lowell Center for Sustainable Production] Alternatives Assessment Framework,&lt;ref name="lowell_fwk" /&gt; conceives of alternatives assessment very broadly, as a reflexive problem-solving process that recognizes the social and technical complexity of environmental problems. It emphasizes aspects such as stakeholder participation, transparency of the process, and open discussion of values in decision-making. Most other frameworks are more narrow and primarily focused on technical aspects.&lt;ref name="jacobs_2016" /&gt;

=== Chemical alternatives assessment ===

Chemical alternatives assessment (or ''substitution of hazardous chemicals'') is the use of alternatives assessment for finding safer and environmentally preferable design options to reduce or eliminate the use of hazardous chemical substances.

The rationale for this is to avoid shifting environmental health burdens from one category of impacts to another (e.g., substituting a [[carcinogen]]ic chemical with a [[neurotoxin|neurotoxic]] one), 
and to minimize the [[unintended consequences]] of decisions made under conditions of uncertainty and ignorance—in other words, to prevent "[[Hazard substitution#Regrettable substitutions|regrettable substitutions]]", where an alternative appeared better based on limited knowledge, but turned out to be worse or equally bad.&lt;ref name="howard_2014"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2014.02.034| issn = 0045-6535| last = Howard| first = Gregory J.| title = Chemical alternatives assessment: The case of flame retardants| journal = Chemosphere| date = 2014| volume=116| pages=112–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An array of methodologies and tools for chemical alternatives assessment have been developed worldwide and have been deployed in a variety of industry sectors.&lt;ref name="harrison_hester" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oecd_toolbox"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development| title = OECD substitution and alternatives assessment toolbox| url = http://www.oecdsaatoolbox.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemical alternatives assessment frameworks include [[chemical hazard]] assessment methods that consider a wide range of hazard [[Clinical endpoint|endpoints]], such as those defined in the
[[Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals|Globally Harmonized System]] or the [[GreenScreen for Safer Chemicals]].

=== Examples ===

== Practice of alternatives assessment ==

Scientists from a variety of government agencies, academic institutions, non-profit organizations, and firms have contributed to developing the practice of alternatives assessment.

=== In the United States ===

Scientific research in the US federal government has contributed to alternatives assessment frameworks and practices. In 2014 the [[National Research Council (United States)|US National Research Council]] released a chemical alternatives assessment framework developed by an expert working group.&lt;ref name="nrc_2014"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = The National Academies Press| isbn = 978-0-309-31013-0| author = National Research Council (US)| title = A framework to guide selection of chemical alternatives| location = Washington, D.C| url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/18872/a-framework-to-guide-selection-of-chemical-alternatives| date = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|US Environmental Protection Agency]] ran a program called ''Design for the Environment'' (now called [https://www.epa.gov/saferchoice Safer Choice]), which developed chemical alternatives assessment methodology&lt;ref name="lavoie_2010" /&gt; and created partnerships to undertake numerous alternatives assessments for chemicals of concern in products.&lt;ref name="usepa_dfe"&gt;{{Cite web| author = US Environmental Protection Agency| title = Design for the Environment alternatives assessments| url = https://www.epa.gov/saferchoice/design-environment-alternatives-assessments}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatives assessment has featured in some state-level chemicals policies and regulatory activities. The [[Massachusetts Toxics Use Reduction Institute]] has provided public technical assistance for "toxics use reduction planning", which includes alternatives assessment.&lt;ref name="eliason_2011"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.jclepro.2010.05.011| issn = 0959-6526| volume = 19| issue = 5| pages = 517–526| last1 = Eliason| first1 = Pamela| last2 = Morose| first2 = Gregory| title = Safer alternatives assessment: The Massachusetts process as a model for state governments| journal = Journal of Cleaner Production| date = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the [[California Department of Toxic Substances Control]] is implementing new regulations that require firms to undertake alternatives assessments for selected priority chemicals in products.&lt;ref name="ca_dtsc_aa"&gt;{{Cite web| author = California Department of Toxic Substances Control| title = Alternatives analysis| work = Safer Consumer Products (SCP)| url = http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/SCP/AA.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Interstate Chemicals Clearinghouse, an association of state governments, has also produced its own guide to alternatives assessment.&lt;ref name="ic2_aa"&gt;{{Citation| author = Interstate Chemicals Clearinghouse| title = IC2 Alternatives assessment guide, version 1.0| url=http://theic2.org/article/download-pdf/file_name/IC2_AA_Guide_Version_1.0.pdf| date = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some US-based companies have begun to use chemical alternatives assessment to address chemical safety issues in supply chains. For example, firms that participate in the [http://bizngo.org/ Business-NGO Working Group for Safer Chemicals and Sustainable Materials] have produced their own guidance for chemical alternatives assessment.&lt;ref name="bizngo_aa"&gt;{{Citation| author = Business-NGO Working Group for Safer Chemicals and Sustainable Materials (BizNGO)| title = BizNGO chemical alternatives assessment protocol| url=http://www.bizngo.org/alternatives-assessment/chemical-alternatives-assessment-protocol| date = 2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In the European Union ===

The Sweden-based non-governmental organization [[ChemSec]] has been active in developing resources and tools for the substitution of hazardous chemicals.  The [http://www.subsport.eu/ Substitution support portal (SUBSPORT)] is an EU-based collaboratively-developed resource for chemical substitution.&lt;ref name="lissner_2011"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.2190/NS.21.3.l| issn = 1541-3772| volume = 21| issue = 3| pages = 477–497| last1 = Lissner| first1 = Lothar| last2 = Romano| first2 = Dolores| title = Substitution for hazardous chemicals on an international level—The approach of the European project "SUBSPORT"| journal = NEW SOLUTIONS: A Journal of Environmental and Occupational Health Policy| date = 2011-01-01| pmid=22001043}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes alternatives assessment case studies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4001">The '''Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences''' — known as '''AFRIMS''' — is a [[United States Army]] project that started as a collaboration with the [[government of Thailand]] to fight a [[cholera]] outbreak in [[Bangkok]] in 1958 and '59. It subsequently expanded to cover [[Military medicine|military medical]] research projects (primarily involving [[infectious diseases]]) across much of Southeast Asia and the Indian Subcontinent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = AFRIMS: History of AFRIMS|url = http://www.afrims.org/afrims-history.html|website = www.afrims.org|access-date = 2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission and history==
The mission of the [[US Army]] Medical Component of the Armed Forces Research Institute of the Medical Sciences (USAMC-AFRIMS) is to conduct basic and applied research for development of diagnostic tests, drugs and vaccines for [[infectious diseases]] of military importance. First formed as the SEATO Lab following the 1956-8 [[Cholera]] pandemic, USAMC-AFRIMS is an agency of the US Embassy Thailand residing at the [[Royal Thai Army Medical Center]] in Bangkok. AFRIMS is a special foreign activity of the [[Walter Reed Army Institute of Research]] (WRAIR) and part of the [[United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command]] (MRMC). AFRIMS is part of a global network of Department of Defense overseas medical research laboratories located in [[Jakarta]], Indonesia; [[Lima]], Peru; [[Nairobi]], Kenya; and Cairo, Egypt. USAMC-AFRIMS has nearly 300 staff members (Thai and USA) and a research budget of approximately $5–7 million annually.&lt;ref name="United States Foreign Service"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bangkok.usembassy.gov/embassy/usamc.html |title=US Army Medical Component of the Armed Forces Research Institute of the Medical Sciences (USAMC-AFRIMS) |work=[[United States Foreign Service]] |accessdate=January 23, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160127222904/http://bangkok.usembassy.gov/embassy/usamc.html |archivedate=January 27, 2016 }} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The major infectious disease threats to soldiers in South East Asia include [[drug resistant]] malaria, diarrhea and dysentery, [[dengue fever]], HIV, hepatitis, and [[scrub typhus]]. These agents pose health risks to soldiers as well as to the civilian population, and thus form the major areas of research at AFRIMS. Research is predominantly applied research aimed towards finding, developing and testing new drugs and vaccines. New medications currently under development are for the treatment and prevention of multiple drug resistant malaria. Vaccines for dysentery, dengue fever, hepatitis E and HIV are also under development at AFRIMS. Products originally field tested or developed at AFRIMS include Hepatitis A Vaccine, Japanese B Encephalitis Vaccine, doxycycline prophylaxis for malaria, mefloquine antimalarial drug prevention, and [[halofantrine]] antimalarial drug treatment.&lt;ref name="United States Foreign Service"/&gt;

AFRIMS also conducts surveillance of emerging diseases such as drug resistant P falciparum malaria, Diarrhea agents: Campylobacter, Cholera O139, Cyclospora, E coli, Hepatitis E, HIV 1 E clade, drug resistant scrub typhus, dengue hemorrhagic fever, and influenza. The laboratory has over 30 field sites in Thailand, Nepal, Cambodia, [[Vietnam]] and [[Bangladesh]]. AFRIMS also has the largest medical library in Southeast Asia and a modern research animal facility, which is accredited by the [[Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care, International]] (AAALAC).&lt;ref name="United States Foreign Service"/&gt;

'''The Asian Women’s Leadership University (AWLU) Project''' (also known as the "AWLU Project") is a U.S. registered 501(c)3 [[non-profit organization]] that was formed in fall 2010 to establish a global women’s leadership university based in [[Asia]]. In summer 2011, the AWLU Project team determined that [[Malaysia]] would be the host country of the Asian Women's Leadership University (AWLU).

Projected to open in September 2015, the AWLU will be a private, not-for-profit university modeled on the U.S. “Seven Sisters” liberal arts colleges. With [[Smith College]] (MA, USA) as the chief academic planning partner, the AWLU will combine American-style [[Liberal arts education|liberal arts and sciences]] education with leadership courses and a curriculum regionally relevant to Asia. AWLU will seek promising women from diverse backgrounds to be a part of its vibrant residential learning community.

== Current Progress ==
The AWLU Project continues to gain international recognition and support in its effort to establish a global women's leadership university for women from Asia and the Middle East. Its critical milestones include: its approval as an Entry Point Project by the Malaysian Federal Government and the endorsement by the Prime Minister of Malaysia as contributing to Malaysia's [http://etp.pemandu.gov.my/ Economic Transformation Program]. The AWLU Project has also secured the commitment of institutions such as Smith College as its Chief Academic Planning Partner and [https://web.archive.org/web/20131004215135/http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/publications/hopkins_medicine_magazine/hopkins_medicine_magazine_winter_2011/a_medical_school_in_malaysia Perdana-Johns Hopkins Medical School] as a Graduate Pathway Partner. All progress thus far has been achieved through a dedicated working board of directors, a distinguished group of senior leaders in Malaysia, and an enthusiastic set of global volunteers.

The AWLU Project's current priorities include securing the Malaysian Ministry of Education's license to establish the AWLU as an approved university in Malaysia. If such approval should be obtained, full fundraising and establishment efforts are expected to commence.

In November 2012, AWLU's rise was documented by the New York Times article [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/26/world/asia/leadership-university-rises-for-asian-women.html?_r=0 "Leadership University Rises for Asian Women"].  The AWLU Project has since been featured at the 2013 Harvard EdTalks and on GOOD Magazine's 2013 Top 100 List, among other features. The AWLU Project was  incubated at the [[Harvard innovation lab]] during 2013 in Cambridge, MA.

In June 2014, [https://www.un.org/sg/management/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=143 Judy Cheng-Hopkins, United Nations Assistant Secretary General], was elected as the President of the AWLU Project, following President Barbara Hou.

{{Atmospheric sciences}}
'''Atmospheric chemistry''' is a branch of [[atmospheric science]] in which the [[chemistry]] of the [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]] and that of other planets is studied. It is a [[multidisciplinary approach]] of research and draws on [[environmental chemistry]], [[physics]], [[meteorology]], [[computer modeling]], [[oceanography]], [[geology]] and [[volcanology]] and other disciplines. Research is increasingly connected with other arenas of study such as [[climatology]].

The composition and chemistry of the Earth's atmosphere is of importance for several reasons, but primarily because of the interactions between the atmosphere and [[living organisms]]. The composition of the Earth's atmosphere changes as result of natural processes such as [[volcano]] emissions, [[lightning]] and bombardment by solar particles from [[corona]]. It has also been changed by human activity and some of these changes are harmful to human health, crops and ecosystems. Examples of problems which have been addressed by atmospheric chemistry include [[acid rain]], [[ozone depletion]], [[photochemical smog]], [[greenhouse gas]]es and [[global warming]]. Atmospheric chemists seek to understand the causes of these problems, and by obtaining a theoretical understanding of them, allow possible solutions to be tested and the effects of changes in government policy evaluated.

== History ==
[[Image:Atmosphere composition diagram-en.svg|thumb|290px|left|Schematic of chemical and transport processes related to atmospheric composition.]]
The ancient [[Greeks]] regarded air as one of the [[four elements]]. The first scientific studies of atmospheric composition began in the 18th century, as chemists such as [[Joseph Priestley]], [[Antoine Lavoisier]] and [[Henry Cavendish]] made the first measurements of the composition of the atmosphere.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries interest shifted towards trace constituents with very small concentrations. One particularly important discovery for atmospheric chemistry was the discovery of [[ozone]] by [[Christian Friedrich Schönbein]] in 1840.

In the 20th century atmospheric science moved on from studying the composition of air to a consideration of how the concentrations of trace gases in the atmosphere have changed over time and the chemical processes which create and destroy compounds in the air. Two particularly important examples of this were the explanation by [[Sydney Chapman (astronomer)|Sydney Chapman]] and [[Gordon Dobson]] of how the [[ozone layer]] is created and maintained, and the explanation of [[photochemical smog]] by [[Arie Jan Haagen-Smit]]. Further studies on ozone issues led to the 1995 Nobel Prize in Chemistry award shared between [[Paul Crutzen]], [[Mario Molina]] and [[Frank Sherwood Rowland]].&lt;ref name= "NobelPrize1995"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/1995/press-release/ |title=Press Release - 1995 Nobel Prize in Chemistry |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=October 11, 1995 |website=The Nobel Prize |publisher=Nobel Prize Org |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century the focus is now shifting again. Atmospheric chemistry is increasingly studied as one part of the [[Earth science#Earth system science|Earth system]]. Instead of concentrating on atmospheric chemistry in isolation the focus is now on seeing it as one part of a single system with the rest of the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]],  [[biosphere]] and [[geosphere]]. An especially important driver for this is the links between chemistry and [[climate]] such as the effects of changing climate on the recovery of the ozone hole and vice versa but also interaction of the composition of the atmosphere with the oceans and terrestrial [[ecosystems]].

== Methodology ==
Observations, lab measurements, and modeling are the three central elements in atmospheric chemistry. Progress in atmospheric chemistry is often driven by the interactions between these components and they form an integrated whole. For example, observations may tell us that more of a chemical compound exists than previously thought possible. This will stimulate new modelling and laboratory studies which will increase our scientific understanding to a point where the observations can be explained.

=== Observation ===
Observations of atmospheric chemistry are essential to our understanding. Routine observations of chemical composition tell us about changes in atmospheric composition over time. One important example of this is the [[Keeling Curve]] - a series of measurements from 1958 to today which  show a steady rise in of the concentration of [[carbon dioxide]] (see also [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere#Ongoing measurements of atmospheric CO2|ongoing measurements of atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]). Observations of atmospheric chemistry are made in observatories such as that on [[Mauna Loa]] and on mobile platforms such as aircraft (e.g. the UK's [[Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurements]]), ships and balloons. Observations of atmospheric composition are increasingly made by [[satellites]] with important instruments such as [[European Remote-Sensing Satellite|GOME]] and [[MOPITT]] giving a global picture of air pollution and chemistry. Surface observations have the advantage that they provide long term records at high time resolution but are limited in the vertical and horizontal space they provide observations from. Some surface based instruments e.g. [[LIDAR]] can provide concentration profiles of chemical compounds and aerosol but are still restricted in the horizontal region they can cover. Many observations are available on line in [[Atmospheric Chemistry Observational Databases]].

=== Laboratory studies ===
Measurements made in the laboratory are essential to our understanding of the sources and sinks of pollutants and naturally occurring compounds. These experiments are performed in controlled environments that allow for the individual evaluation of specific chemical reactions or the assessment of properties of a particular atmospheric constituent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Future of Atmospheric Research: Remembering Yesterday, Understanding Today, Anticipating Tomorrow|vauthors = ((National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine))|publisher=The National Academies Press|year=2016|isbn=978-0-309-44565-8|location=Washington, DC|pages=15|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Types of analysis that are of interest includes both those on gas-phase reactions, as well as [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|heterogeneous]] reactions that are relevant to the formation and growth of [[aerosol]]s. Also of high importance is the study of atmospheric [[photochemistry]] which quantifies how the rate in which molecules are split apart by sunlight and what resulting products are. In addition, [[thermodynamic]] data such as [[Henry's law]] coefficients can also be obtained.

=== Modeling ===
In order to synthesise and test theoretical understanding of atmospheric chemistry, computer models (such as [[chemical transport model]]s) are used. Numerical models solve the differential equations governing the concentrations of chemicals in the atmosphere. They can be very simple or very complicated. One common trade off in numerical models is between the number of chemical compounds and chemical reactions modelled versus the representation of transport and mixing in the atmosphere. For example, a box model might include hundreds or even thousands of chemical reactions but will only have a very crude representation of mixing in the atmosphere. In contrast, 3D models represent many of the physical processes of the atmosphere but due to constraints on computer resources will have far fewer chemical reactions and compounds. Models can be used to interpret observations, test understanding of chemical reactions and predict future concentrations of chemical compounds in the atmosphere. One important current trend is for atmospheric chemistry modules to become one part of earth system models in which the links between climate, atmospheric composition and the biosphere can be studied.

Some models are constructed by automatic code generators (e.g. [[Autochem]] or [[Kinetic PreProcessor|KPP]]). In this approach a set of constituents are chosen and the automatic code generator will then select the reactions involving those constituents from a set of reaction databases. Once the reactions have been chosen the [[ordinary differential equations]] (ODE) that describe their time evolution can be automatically constructed.

'''''Boink''''' was a magazine of [[erotica]] started by Alecia Oleyourryk, a magazine journalism major at
[[Boston University]], and photographer Christopher Anderson. The magazine was also educational in scope and purpose. The premiere issue was released in February 2005 and was celebrated with an opening party at the Roxy, a nightclub in the [[Boston Theater District]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The reason that I like this magazine is that you can tell they are real college students... not those fake college students you find on the Internet. -- [[Howard Stern]] (BU Alum) &lt;ref name ="stern"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.howardstern.com|title=The Howard Stern Show - 09/28/05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The magazine was available in both a print and online digital version. ''Boink'' catered to both men and women with articles dealing with sexuality in college life.  All models were students from area colleges and of varying [[sexual orientation]]s.

In 2008, a book based on the magazine was published by [[Warner Books]], titled ''BOINK: College Sex by the People Having It."

As of 2010, the magazine has ceased publishing new issues, although the book can still be purchased online.

'''The Centre for Applied Genomics''' is a genome centre in the Research Institute of [[Sickkids|The Hospital for Sick Children]], and is affiliated with the [[University of Toronto]]. TCAG also operates as a Science and Technology Innovation Centre of [http://www.genomecanada.ca Genome Canada],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genomecanada.ca/en/portfolio/science.aspx Genome Canada Science and Technology Platforms]&lt;/ref&gt; with an emphasis on [[next-generation sequencing]] (NGS) and [[bioinformatics]] support. Research at TCAG focuses on the [[genetics|genetic]] and genomic basis of human variability, health and disease, including research on the genetics of [[autism spectrum disorder]] and structural variation of the [[human genome]]. The Centre is located in the Peter Gilgan Centre for Research and Learning in downtown [[Toronto]], Canada.

==History==
The need for a centralized core facility for human genome research at [[Sickkids|SickKids Hospital]] prompted the establishment of The Centre for Applied Genomics (TCAG) in 1998. The Founding Director and Associate Director were Drs. [[Lap-Chee Tsui]] and [[Stephen W. Scherer]], respectively. Dr. Scherer is now the Scientific Director.
[[Image:TCAG hall.jpg|left|320px|thumb|The Centre for Applied Genomics – MaRS location]]
Funding from the [[Canada Foundation for Innovation]] (CFI) enabled TCAG to form by consolidating existing core facilities including the [[Medical Research Council of Canada]] Genome Resource Facility, the [http://www.cgdn.ca/ Canadian Genetic Diseases Network] (CGDN) large insert clone core, the CGDN [[Dna sequencing|DNA Sequencing]] Core and the SickKids Biotechnology Service [[Dna sequencing|DNA Sequencing]] and Synthesis labs. A genome-wide [[Microsatellite (genetics)|microsatellite]] [[genotyping]] laboratory at the [[OHRI|Ottawa Health Research Institute]] led by Dr. Dennis  Bulman was added. Subsequently, operational funding from the [[CIHR]] Genomics Special Projects panel provided for additional staff.

In 2001, a proposal entitled "Genome Resource Core Platform" was submitted to the then newly formed [http://www.genomecanada.ca Genome Canada]. This provided operational support, enhancing existing facilities and adding a mouse [[genotyping]] core at the University of Toronto led by Dr. Lucy Osborne. In 2002, SickKids built a new [[Affymetrix]] [[microarray]] facility. This core has quickly grown to become the largest such service centre in Canada and is in the top ten in North America.&lt;ref&gt;Data provided by Affymetrix, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, TCAG entered a second phase of development driven by a $12 million [[Canada Foundation for Innovation|CFI]]/[http://www.oit.on.ca/Pages/Home.html Ontario Innovation Trust] funded project entitled "Integrative Genomics for Health Research",&lt;ref&gt;Integrative Genomics for Health Research news item (Ontario Innovation Trust website) [http://www.oit.on.ca/Pages/SStories21-40/StorySickKidsScherer.html]&lt;/ref&gt; allowing for consolidation of the mouse [[genotyping]] core with the SickKids facilities. This award also supported the establishment of an "Ontario Population Genomics Repository" (OPGP) to be used as controls in studies of common diseases. To efficiently complete this project, TCAG partnered with Dr. John McLaughlin's group at [[Mount Sinai Hospital (Toronto)]].

In May, 2004, an application to the newly announced [[Canada Foundation for Innovation|CFI]] Research Hospital Fund resulted in a $10.9 million award to build out lab space and consolidate all operations on the 14th and 15th floors of the Toronto Medical Discovery Tower (TMDT) in the [[MaRS Discovery District]]. TCAG was the first occupant of TMDT (in August, 2005), quickly followed by other SickKids scientists. Investments in computer infrastructure from the 2003 [[Canada Foundation for Innovation|CFI]]/[http://www.oit.on.ca/Pages/Home.html Ontario Innovation Trust] competition resulted in the establishment of new phases of the [http://ccb.sickkids.ca/hpf_index.html high-performance computing cluster] (HPF) that is currently used by TCAG and many other users, to allow analysis of large [[genomic]] datasets arising from new [[Dna microarray|microarray]] and [[DNA sequencing|sequencing]] technologies. Further enhancements to the TCAG infrastructure were supported by a $10.7 million renewal grant from CFI's Leading Edge Fund competition, entitled "Integrative Genomics for Health Research&amp;nbsp;– Phase II",  awarded in June 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sickkids.ca/AboutSickKids/News-Room/Past-News/2009/cfi-funding.html SickKids press release, June 18, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, a CFI grant entitled "The Centre for Applied Genomics: Paediatric Genomes to Outcomes" provided further infrastructure support.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sickkids.ca/AboutSickKids/Newsroom/Past-News/2013/Leading-Edge-Fund-grants.html SickKids kicks off 2013 with two Leading Edge Fund grants, January 13, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2013, TCAG moved to the Peter Gilgan Centre for Research and Learning, a new building housing the SickKids Research Institute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tcag.ca/news/news130930.html The Centre for Applied Genomics has moved - news item, TCAG website, October 229, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

TCAG operates in large part on Science and Technology Innovation Centre (STIC) funds from [http://www.genomecanada.ca Genome Canada], administered by the [http://www.ontariogenomics.ca Ontario Genomics Institute].

==Research==
Current research at TCAG centres around large-scale projects performed by facility personnel, including support of [http://www.genomecanada.ca Genome Canada] projects, and a significant focus on the genetics of [[autism spectrum disorder]]s and structural variation of the [[human genome]]. Service work is also performed for over 600 other academic, private sector and government labs each year, drawn from 30 different countries and spanning a wide variety of research disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;Data from progress reports submitted to the Ontario Genomics Institute&lt;/ref&gt;

Past research at TCAG is reflected by numerous peer-reviewed scientific publications. In 2008, TCAG Scientific Directors, Associate Scientists and staff co-authored 58 peer-reviewed manuscripts dependent in some way (either entirely, or in part) on the platform infrastructure, as documented in [[Pubmed|PubMed]].&lt;ref&gt;PubMed search for publications authored by these individuals during calendar year 2008, excluding Dr. Brudno who was added in 2009 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/]{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2002, over 270 such papers have been published.&lt;ref&gt;PubMed search for publications authored by these individuals, 2002 through present, excluding Drs. Brudno and Beyene who were added more recently [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/]{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Support of other researchers worldwide is found in many similar publications, with at least 145 papers in scholarly journals, book chapters, or graduate thesis dissertations acknowledging support or use of database resources during 2008 alone.&lt;ref&gt;Google Scholar full-text search results:  publications referring to The Centre for Applied Genomics or the Database of Genomic Variants, either in the Acknowledgments section or body text, and published either electronically or in print.

{{Hispanic and Latino Americans}}
'''Chonga''' is a Spanish-derived term used especially in [[South Florida metropolitan area|South Florida]], often to indicate a working-class, sexualized, aggressive, and emotionally expressive young woman.

Chongas are also a distinct [[subculture]], believed to have developed in [[Miami]] in the late 20th century. Members are typically young, working-class Latina women. In South Florida the term is usually considered a pejorative, though some young women are proud to identify themselves as such. While feminist scholarship on chongas is limited, early work by [[gender studies]] scholar Jillian Hernandez has suggested that the chonga identity is an "emerging [[icon]]", and that it can be empowering for working-class women.

==Etymology and meaning==
The intended meaning of the term "chonga" varies depending on the context in which it is used. The most specific meaning of the term denotes a member of the chonga subculture—young, usually working class and Latina women—who dress and often act in a sexualized, brash, sometimes aggressive manner. The term also has three looser meanings: as a synonym for prostitute; to refer to a woman who acts "gangsta" or in a thug like manner; and among female friends, as a jovial way to greet each other, as an alternative to "girlfriend!"&lt;ref name="hern68"&gt;Hernandez 68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Chongas!"&gt;Lush 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Usage of the term to refer to young women is believed to have arisen in [[Miami]], and only became prominent in the early 21st century. The same word has long been used in Latin American countries such as [[Peru]] and [[Ecuador]] to refer to a brothel; the modern US usage of the word may be related to this, or might have arisen independently among Floridian Cuban-Americans. 

"Chonga" has lexical similarities with several other Spanish terms, some of which have been in use for centuries.&lt;ref name="hern68"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Chongas!"/&gt; These include: 
* ''[[Cholo|chola]]''  - used in the [[Southwestern United States]] for women of [[Mexican people|Mexican]] or [[Mexican American|Mexican-American]] descent, sometimes with the added meaning that they are a "homegirl" or someone from the streets.&lt;ref name="hern68"/&gt;
* ''chula'' - which denotes a cute or sexy young woman.&lt;ref name="hern68"/&gt;
* ''chusma'' - in the US, this term is often used to denote  an oversexualized and under-Americanized woman of [[Cuban people|Cuban]] descent. In Latin America, the term can merely refer to loud, working-class women, and can even refer to a rabble, some of whom might not be female.&lt;ref name="hern68"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muñoz 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chonga subculture==
According to the journalist Tamara Lush, Chonga subculture may have first appeared in [[Miami]] during the 1980s. Early chongas were usually Cuban teenagers whose parents had recently immigrated to the US. In the 1990s, chongas often wore white shorts with a colored thong underneath, basketball jerseys, and fake gold jewelry. Over the years the style evolved, with for instance tight jeans becoming more popular than shorts.&lt;ref name = "Chongas!"/&gt;

===Chonga characteristics===
21st-century chongas will often exhibit at least some of the following characteristics: 
*Cheap but sexy clothing, which often includes "Brazilian jeans"&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Pocketless [[Skinny jeans]] that usually have an accentuating effect on the bottom.&lt;/ref&gt; and revealing tops, a preference for gelled hair, synthetic nails and gaudy jewelry, often including fake gold, bangles and earring hoops.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Chongas sometimes like to have their names written on the hoops.&lt;/ref&gt;   
*Sexual availability, often along with a preference to be surrounded by men.  
*Hostility to other young women, unless they are fellow members of the same chonga crew.  
*Loud, emotionally expressive and aggressive behavior.&lt;ref name = "Chongas!"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez ''passim'', and esp. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all chongas live up to these stereotypes; for example, sometimes women whose conduct is the most overtly sexualized will in fact be among the least interested in actual heterosexual encounters—in some cases chonga behavior is perhaps best understood as a kind of bonding between female friends.&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Depictions in the media===
Until 2007, chongas have rarely appeared in the media, despite their high visibility in real life. One of the rare exceptions was the ''Cheerleaders'' (2000) set of art photographs by [[Luis Gispert]].&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez 77-79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luisgispert.com/index.php#mi=2&amp;pt=1&amp;pi=10000&amp;s=16&amp;p=1&amp;a=0&amp;at=0 The cheerleader set of images on Gispert's web site]. Not all pics feature chonga-like lasses; for an iconic image discussed at length in Hernandez, see pic no. 15. See also pic nos. 3, 9, 16 &amp; 17.&lt;/ref&gt; In popular culture, the few exceptions include [[Bratz]] dolls which have a chonga-like appearance; the chonga-like characters Lydia and Melina in the television comedy [[MADtv]]; and the chonga-like character Tina in the movie ''[[Do the Right Thing]]''.&lt;ref name = "Chongas!"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Chongas became considerably more common in popular culture after the 2007 release of [[Chongalicious]], a YouTube [[viral video]]. Hernandez noted that the only depiction she's aware of that accurately showed chongas in their social context was the 2007 "Bratz girls" exhibition by the ''GisMo Collective'' (Jessica Gispert and Crystal Molinary).&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez 68, 79-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In cultural and gender studies===
According to a 2009 article by gender studies scholar Jillian Hernandez, feminist literature covering chongas remains sparse, even after their profile was raised by the ''Chongalicious'' video. Hernandez contrasts this with the extensive body of work on [[Chicana feminism]], which explores the ''chola'' and ''chusma'' phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez 86-87.&lt;/ref&gt; Hernandez argues the chonga image has become iconic in Miami, and states that the aesthetic appeal of the chonga can be considerable, which in her opinion partly explains why the ''cheerleaders'' set of photographs was successful in launching Gispert's international career.&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

The portrayal of chongas in the media can, however, be problematic, sometimes even repressive, as powerful negative images contribute to Latinas internalizing pressure to conform which originates from the dominant Anglo-American culture.&lt;ref&gt;Guzmán  2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Stereotypical representations of chongas can play a role in the United States' wider [[culture wars#United States of America|culture wars]], adding to concerns about the sexuality of some Latina women being "out of control" with their perceived high rate of reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;Gutiérrez ch. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Citing earlier work by Isabel Molina Guzmán,&lt;ref&gt;''Disorderly Bodies and Discourses of Latinidad in the Elián González Story'', Isabel Molina Guzmán (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Hernandez relates this to the [[Elián González affair]], where the media portrayal of Marisleysis González as having the chonga-like characteristic of emotional excess contributed to the degradation of the  privileged, "model minority status" that [[Cuban Americans]] had previously enjoyed.&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her own research, Hernandez found that most people she questioned considered "chonga" a pejorative term. One respondent even went as far as to say the term sums up all the negative Latina stereotypes. A few asserted that while they know several chongas, they don't know any who self-identify as such. Sometimes Latina women will admit they went through a brief "chonga" phase in their early teens, but later came to view the style as uncool. Yet some chongas chose to retain the identity into their twenties. Hernandez also found that some young woman are proud to call themselves chongas. Several expressed pride in their sexual attractiveness. The creators of "Chongalicious", who are themselves middle class, found they had considerably more male attention while pretending to be chongas, one of them saying back in 2007 that "I think we would have boyfriends if we were real chongas."&lt;ref name = "Chongas!"/&gt; Hernandez suggests that the chonga sub culture is in several ways a positive thing, representing women who are not shamed into invisibility by their low-class status or ethnic identity. She anticipates a broadening and deepening of feminist scholarship on chongas, to uncover the ways in which the chonga identity can be helpful to young women exploring their "bodies and pleasures".&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Hernandez notes that she is consciously echoing [[Michel Foucault]] in using the term "bodies and pleasures", as she sees it as a more empowering alternative to "sexuality".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez ''passim'', esp. 86-87.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Climate resilience''' can be generally defined as the capacity for a [[socio-ecological system]] to: (1) absorb stresses and maintain function in the face of external stresses imposed upon it by [[climate change]] and (2) adapt, reorganize, and evolve into more desirable configurations that improve the [[sustainability]] of the system, leaving it better prepared for future climate change impacts.

With the rising awareness of climate change impacts by both national and international bodies, building climate resilience has become a major goal for these institutions. The key focus of climate resilience efforts is to address the vulnerability that communities, states, and countries currently have with regards to the environmental consequences of climate change. Currently, climate resilience efforts encompass social, economic, technological, and political strategies that are being implemented at all scales of society. From local community action to global treaties, addressing climate resilience is becoming a priority, although it could be argued that a significant amount of the theory has yet to be translated into practice. Despite this, there is a robust and ever-growing movement fueled by local  and national bodies alike geared towards building and improving climate resilience.

== Introduction==

=== Definition of climate resilience===
In actuality, there is still a great deal of abstract discussion and debate regarding a number of subtle nuances associated with the precise definition of the climate resilience perspective, such as its relation to [[climate change adaptation]], the extent to which it should encompass actor-based versus systems-based approaches to improving stability, and its relationship with the [[balance of nature]] theory or [[homeostatic]] equilibrium view of ecological systems. 
&lt;ref name="folke"/&gt;
Currently, the majority of work regarding climate resilience has been centered around examining the capacity for social-ecological systems to sustain shocks and maintain the integrity of functional relationships in the face of external forces. However, there is a growing consensus in academic literature which argues that greater attention needs to be focused on investigating the other critical aspect of climate resilience, which is the capacity for social-ecological systems to renew and develop, and to utilize disturbances as opportunities for innovation and evolution of new pathways that improve the system’s ability to adapt to macroscopic changes.

===Climate resilience vs. climate adaptation===

The fact that climate resilience encompasses a dual function, to absorb shock as well as to self-renew, is the primary means by which it can be differentiated from the concept of climate adaptation. In general, [[adaptation]] is viewed as a group of processes and actions that help a system absorb changes that have already occurred, or may be predicted to occur in the future. For the specific case of environmental change and climate adaptation, it is argued by many that adaptation should be defined strictly as encompassing only active decision-making processes and actions - in other words, deliberate changes made in response to climate change.
&lt;ref name="nelson" /&gt; 
Of course, this characterization is highly debatable: after all, adaptation can also be used to describe natural, involuntary processes by which [[organisms]], [[populations]], [[ecosystems]] and perhaps even social-ecological systems evolve after the application of certain external stresses. However, for the purposes of differentiating climate adaptation and climate resilience from a policymaking standpoint, we can contrast the active, actor-centric notion of adaptation with resilience, which would be a more systems-based approach to building social-ecological networks that are inherently capable of not only absorbing change, but utilizing those changes to develop into more efficient configurations.

===Inter-connectivity between climate resilience, climate change, adaptability, and vulnerability===
[[File:Climate Resilience Model.PNG|thumb|A graphic displaying the inter-connectivity between climate change, adaptability, vulnerability, and resilience.]]
A conversation about climate resilience is incomplete without also incorporating the concepts of adaptations, vulnerability, and [[global warming|climate change]]. If the definition of resiliency is the ability to recover from a negative event, in this case climate change, then talking about preparations beforehand and strategies for recovery (aka adaptations), as well as populations that are more less capable of developing and implementing a resiliency strategy (aka vulnerable populations) are essential. This is framed under the assumed detrimental impacts of climate change to ecosystems and [[ecosystem services]].&lt;ref&gt;Smit, Barry, and Johanna Wandel. "Adaptation, adaptive capacity and vulnerability." Global environmental change 16.3 (2006): 282-292.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical overview of climate resilience===

Climate resilience is a relatively novel concept that is still in the process of being established by academia and policymaking institutions. However, the theoretical basis for many of the ideas central to climate resilience have actually existed since the 1960s. Originally an idea defined for strictly ecological systems, [[Resilience (ecology)|resilience]] was initially outlined by C.S. Holling as the capacity for ecological systems and relationships within those systems to persist and absorb changes to “state variables, driving variables, and parameters.”
&lt;ref name="holling"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holling | first1 = CS | year = 1973| title = Resilience and Stability of Ecological Systems | url = | journal = Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 1–23 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.es.04.110173.000245 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition helped form the foundation for the notion of ecological [[Island biogeography|equilibrium]]: the idea that the behavior of natural ecosystems is dictated by a homeostatic drive towards some stable set point. Under this school of thought (which maintained quite a dominant status during this time period), ecosystems were perceived to respond to disturbances largely through [[negative feedback]] systems – if there is a change, the ecosystem would act to mitigate that change as much as possible and attempt to return to its prior state. However, the idea of resilience began evolving relatively quickly in the coming years.

As greater amounts of scientific research in ecological adaptation and natural resource management was conducted, it became clear that oftentimes, natural systems were subjected to dynamic, transient behaviors that changed how they reacted to significant changes in state variables: rather than work back towards a predetermined equilibrium, the absorbed change was harnessed to establish a new baseline to operate under.  Rather than minimizes imposed changes, ecosystems could integrate and manage those changes, and use them fuel the evolution of novel characteristics. This new perspective of resilience as a concept that inherently works synergistically with elements of [[uncertainty]] and [[entropy]] first began to facilitate changes in the field of [[adaptive management]] and environmental resources, through work whose basis was built by Holling and colleagues yet again.
&lt;ref name="folke" /&gt;
&lt;ref name="schoon"&gt;Schoon, M. (2005, 2 21). A short historical overview of the concepts of resilience, vulnerability, and adaptation . Retrieved from http://michaelschoon.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/historical_critique-of-resilience-working-paper.pdf
&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid 1970s, resilience began gaining momentum as an idea in [[anthropology]], [[culture theory]], and other [[social sciences]]. Even more compelling is the fact that there was significant work in these relatively non-traditional fields that helped facilitate the evolution of the resilience perspective as a whole. Part of the reason resilience began moving away from an equilibrium-centric view and towards a more flexible, malleable description of social-ecological systems was due to work such as that of Andrew Vayda and [[Bonnie McCay]] in the field of social anthropology, where more modern versions of resilience were deployed to challenge traditional ideals of cultural dynamics.
&lt;ref name="vayda"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vayda | first1 = Andrew P. | authorlink2 = Bonnie McCay | last2 = McCay | first2 = Bonnie J. | year = 1975 | title = New Directions in Ecology and Ecological Anthropology | url = | journal = Annual Review of Anthropology | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 293–306 | doi=10.1146/annurev.an.04.100175.001453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually by the late 1980s and early 1990s, resilience had fundamentally changed as a theoretical framework. Not only was it now applicable to social-ecological systems, but more importantly, resilience now incorporated and emphasized ideas of management, integration, and utilization of change rather than simply describing reactions to change. Resilience was no longer just about absorbing shocks, but also about harnessing the changes triggered by external stresses to catalyze the evolution the social-ecological system in question.

As the issues of [[global warming]] and climate change have gained traction and become more prominent since the early 1990s, the question of climate resilience has also emerged. Considering the global implications of the impacts induced by climate change, climate resilience has become a critical concept that scientific institutions, policymakers, governments, and international organizations have begun to rally around as a framework for designing the solutions that will be needed to address the [[effects of global warming]].

==Climate resilience and environmental justice==

=== Applications of a resilience framework: addressing vulnerability===

A climate resilience framework offers a rich plethora of contributions that can improve our understanding of environmental processes, and better equip governments and policymakers to develop sustainable solutions that combat the effects of climate change. To begin with, climate resilience establishes the idea of multi-stable socio-ecological systems. As discussed earlier, resilience originally began as an idea that extended from the stable equilibrium view – systems only acted to return to their pre-existing states when exposed to a disturbance. But with modern interpretations of resilience, it is now established that socio-ecological systems can actually stabilize around a multitude of possible states. Secondly, climate resilience has played a critical role in emphasizing the importance of [[preventive action]] when assessing the effects of climate change. Although adaptation is always going to be a key consideration, making changes after the fact has a limited capability to help communities and nations deal with climate change. By working to build climate resilience, policymakers and governments can take a more comprehensive stance that works to mitigate the harms of global warming impacts before they happen.&lt;ref name="nelson" /&gt; 
&lt;ref name="tschakert"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tschakert | first1 = P | last2 = Dietrich | first2 = K A | year = 2010 | title = Anticipatory Learning for Climate Change Adaptation and Resilience | url = | journal = Ecology and Society | volume = 15 | issue = | page = 11 | doi=10.5751/es-03335-150211}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Finally, a climate resilience perspective encourages greater cross-scale connectedness of systems. Climate change scholars have argued that solely relying on theories of adaptation is also limiting because inherently, this perspective does not necessitate as much full-system cohesion as a resilience perspective would. Creating mechanisms of adaptation that occur in isolation at local, state, or national levels may leave the overall social-ecological system vulnerable. A resilience-based framework would require far more cross-talk, and the creation of environmental protections that are more holistically generated and implemented.
&lt;ref name="nelson" /&gt;
&lt;ref name="malhi"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Malhi | first1 = Yadvinder | last2 = Roberts | first2 = J Timmons | last3 = Betts | first3 = Richard A | last4 = Killeen | first4 = Timothy J | last5 = Li | first5 = Wenhong | last6 = Nobre | first6 = Carlos A | year = 2008 | title = Climate Change, Deforestation, and the Fate of the Amazon | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/content/319/5860/169.abstract | journal = Science | volume = 319 | issue = 5860| pages = 169–72 | doi=10.1126/science.1146961| bibcode = 2008Sci...319..169M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vulnerability=== 
Negative impacts of climate change are those that are least capable of developing robust and comprehensive climate resiliency infrastructure and response systems. However what exactly constitutes a vulnerable community is still open to debate. 
The International Panel on Climate Change has defined vulnerability using three characteristics: the “adaptive capacity, sensitivity, and exposure” to the effects of climate change.  The adaptive capacity refers to a community’s capacity to create resiliency infrastructure, while the sensitivity and exposure elements are both tied to economic and geographic elements that vary widely in differing communities. There are, however, many commonalities between vulnerable communities.&lt;ref&gt;J.J. McCarthy, O.F. Canziani, N.A. Leary, D.J. Dokken, K.S. White (Eds.), Climate Change 2001: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vulnerability can mainly be broken down into 2 major categories, economic vulnerability, based on [[socioeconomic]] factors, and geographic vulnerability. Neither are mutually exclusive.

====Economic vulnerability====

[[File:GNI PPP Per Capita.png|thumb|World gross national income per capita.]]

At its basic level, a community that is economically vulnerable is one that is ill-prepared for the effects of climate change because it lacks the needed financial resources. Preparing a climate resilient society will require huge investments in infrastructure, city planning, engineering sustainable energy sources, and preparedness systems. From a global perspective, it is more likely that people living at or below poverty will be affected the most by climate change and are thus the most vulnerable, because they will have the least amount of resource dollars to invest in resiliency infrastructure.   They will also have the least amount of resource dollars for cleanup efforts after more frequently occurring natural climate change related disasters.&lt;ref&gt;M.J. Collier et al. "Transitioning to resilience and sustainability in urban communities" Cities 2013. 32:21–S28&lt;/ref&gt;

====Geographic vulnerability====
A second definition of vulnerability relates to geographic vulnerability. The most geographically vulnerable locations to climate change are those that will be impacted by side effects of natural hazards, such as rising sea levels and by dramatic changes in ecosystem services, including access to food.  Island nations are usually noted as more vulnerable but communities that rely heavily on a sustenance based lifestyle are also at greater risk.&lt;ref&gt;K. Hewitt (Ed.), Interpretations of Calamity for the Viewpoint of Human Ecology, Allen and Unwin, Boston (1983), pp. 231–262&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Abaco Islands 15ft 4p572 shaded.png|thumb|Abaco Islands- An example of a low elevation island community likely to be impacted by rising sea level associated with changing climate.]]

Roger E. Kasperson and Jeanne X. Kasperson of the Stockholm Environmental Institute compiled a list of vulnerable communities as having one or more of these characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Kasperson, Roger E., and Jeanne X. Kasperson. Climate change, vulnerability, and social justice. Stockholm: Stockholm Environment Institute, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;
*food insecure 
*water scarce
*delicate marine ecosystem 
*fish dependent
*small island community

===Vulnerability and equity:  environmental justice and climate justice===
Equity is another essential component of vulnerability and is closely tied to issues of [[environmental justice]] and [[climate justice]].   Who participates in and who has access to climate resiliency services and infrastructure are more than likely going to fall along historically unequitable patterns of distribution.  As the most vulnerable communities are likely to be the most heavily impacted, a [[climate justice]] movement is coalescing in response. There are many aspects of climate justice that relate to resiliency and many climate justice advocates argue that justice should be an essential component of resiliency strategies.  
Similar frameworks that have been applied to the [[Climate Justice]] movement can be utilized to address some of these equity issues.  The frameworks are similar to other types of justice movements and include- contractariansim which attempts to allocate the most benefits for the poor, utilitarianism which seeks to find the most benefits for the most people, egalitarianism which attempts to reduce inequality, and libertarianism which emphasizes a fair share of burden but also individual freedoms.&lt;ref&gt;Liu, F. (2000). Environmental justice analysis: Theories, methods and practice. Boca Raton, FL: [[CRC Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act for Climate Justice Campaign [http://www.actforclimatejustice.org/about/what-is-climate-justice/] has defined climate justice as “a vision to dissolve and alleviate the unequal burdens created by climate change. As a form of environmental justice, climate justice is the fair treatment of all people and freedom from discrimination with the creation of policies and projects that address climate change and the systems that create climate change and perpetuate discrimination”.&lt;ref&gt;Act for Climate Justice. (February 2014)  What Is Climate Justice.  Retrieved from http://www.actforclimatejustice.org/about/what-is-climate-justice/&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate Justice can incorporate both grassroots as well as international and national level organizing movements.

====Local level issues of equity====
Many indigenous peoples live sustenance based lifestyles, relying heavily on local ecosystem services for their livelihoods. According to some definitions, indigenous peoples are often some of the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and advocating for participation of marginalized groups is one goal of the indigenous people’s climate justice movement. Climate change will likely dramatically alter local food production capacity, which will impact those people who are more dependent on local food sources and less dependent on global or regional food supplies. The greatest injustice is that people living this type of lifestyle are least likely to have contributed to the causes of global climate change in the first place.  Indigenous peoples movements often involve protests and calling on action from world leaders to address climate change concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Chwala, A. Climate Justice Movements Gather Strength. Climate Connections. State of the World. (2009). 119-121&lt;/ref&gt;

Another local level climate justice movement is the adaptation finance approach  which has been found in some studies to be a positive solution by providing resource dollars directly to communities in need.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barrett | first1 = Sam | year = 2013 | title = Local Level Climate Justice? Adaptation Finance and Vulnerability Reduction | url = | journal = Global Environmental Change | volume = 23 | issue = 6| pages = 1819–29 | doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2013.07.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====International and national climate justice ====
The [[carbon market]] approach is one international and national concept proposed that tries to solve the issue by using market forces to make carbon use less affordable, but vulnerable host communities that are the intended beneficiaries have been found to receive little to no benefit.&lt;ref name="Mather"&gt;Mathur, Vivek N., et al. "Experiences of Host Communities with Carbon Market Projects: Towards Multi-Level Climate Justice." Climate Policy 14.1 (2014): 42-62. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;  One problem noted with the carbon market approach is the inherent conflict of interest embedded between developed and sustenance based communities.  Developed nations that have often prioritized growth of their own [[gross national product]] over implementing changes that would address climate change concerns by taxing carbon which might damage GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Towers | first1 = G | year = 2000 | title = Applying the political geography of scale: Grassroots strategies and environmental justice | url = | journal = Professional Geographer | volume = 52 | issue = | pages = 23–36 | doi=10.1111/0033-0124.00202}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition the pace of change necessary to implement a carbon market approach is too slow to be effective at most international and national policy levels.&lt;ref name="Mather"/&gt;

Alternatively, a study by V.N Mather, et al. proposes a multi-level approach that focuses on addressing some primary issues concerning climate justice at local and international levels.  The approach includes:&lt;ref name="Mather"/&gt;
*developing the capacity for a carbon market approach
*focusing on power dynamics within local and regional government
*managing businesses in regard to carbon practices
*special attention given to developing countries

====Climate justice, environmental justice, and the United States====

The issue of [[environmental justice]] and [[climate justice]] is relevant within the United States because historically communities of color and low socioeconomic communities have been under served and underrepresented in terms of distribution and participation.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Dorceta E. "Women of color, environmental justice, and ecofeminism."Ecofeminism: Women, culture, nature (1997): 38-81&lt;/ref&gt;  The question of “by and for whom” resiliency strategies are targeted and implemented is of great concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Friend | first1 = R. | last2 = Moench | first2 = M. | year = 2013 | title = What is the purpose of urban climate resilience? Implications for addressing poverty and vulnerability | url = | journal = Urban Climate | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 98–113 | doi=10.1016/j.uclim.2013.09.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Inadequate response and resiliency strategies to recent natural disasters in communities of color, such as [[Hurricane Katrina]], are examples of environmental injustices and inadequate resilience strategies in already vulnerable communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cutter | first1 = Susan L.|author1-link= Susan Cutter | last2 = Emrich | first2 = Christopher T. | last3 = Mitchell | first3 = Jerry T. | last4 = Boruff | first4 = Bryan J. | last5 = Gall | first5 = Melanie | last6 = Schmidtlein | first6 = Mathew C. | last7 = Burton | first7 = Christopher G. | last8 = Melton | first8 = Ginni | year = 2006 | title = The Long Road Home: Race, Class, and Recovery from Hurricane Katrina | url = | journal = Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable Development | volume = 48 | issue = 2| pages = 8–20 | doi = 10.3200/ENVT.48.2.8-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:New Orleans USACE-17th Canal-A-09-04-05 0004.JPG|thumb|New Orleans post Hurricane Katrina levee damage.]]

The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People[[NAACP]] has recently begun a Climate Justice campaign&lt;ref name=NAACP&gt;[http://www.naacp.org/programs/entry/climate-justice Climate Justice: NAACP]&lt;/ref&gt; in response to  events such as Hurricane Katrina and in preparation for future climate change related natural disasters.  The goal of this campaign is to address the 3 R’s of climate justice: resilience, resistance, and revisioning.   The NAACP’s climate justice initiative will address climate resilience through advocacy, outreach, political actions, research and education.&lt;ref name=NAACP/&gt;

=====Climate gap=====

Another concept important for understanding vulnerability in the United States is the [[climate gap]].  The climate gap is the inequitably negative impact on poor people and people of color due to the effects of climate change. Some of these negative impacts include higher cost of living expenses, higher incidences of heat related health consequences in urban areas that are likely to experience [[urban heat island]] effects, increased pollution in urban areas, and decreases in available jobs for poor people and people of color.  Some suggested solutions to close the climate gap include suggesting legislative policies that would reduce the impact of climate change by reducing [[carbon emissions]] with the emphasis of reductions in [[greenhouse gas emissions]] and toxic [[air pollution]] in neighborhoods that are already heavily impacted, usually urban centers.  Other solutions include increasing access to quality health care for poor people and people of color, preparedness planning for urban heat island effects, identifying neighborhoods that are most likely to be impacted, investing in alternative fuel and energy research, and measuring the results of policy impacts.&lt;ref name= "Schonkoff"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shonkoff | first1 = Seth B. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2011 | title = The climate gap: environmental health and equity implications of climate change and mitigation policies in California—a review of the literature | url = http://dornsife.usc.edu/assets/sites/242/docs/The_Climate_Gap_Full_Report_FINAL.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Climatic Change | volume = 109 | issue = 1| pages = 485–503 | doi=10.1007/s10584-011-0310-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical foundations for building climate resilience==
As the threat of environmental disturbances due to [[climate change]] becomes more and more relevant, so does the need for strategies to build a more resilient society. As climate resiliency literature has revealed, there are different strategies and suggestions that all work towards the overarching goal of building and maintaining societal resiliency.

===Urban resilience===
There is increasing concern on an international level with regards to addressing and combating the impending implications of [[climate change]] for urban areas, where populations of these cities around the world are growing disproportionately high. There is even more concern for the rapidly growing urban centers in developing countries, where the majority of urban inhabitants are poor or “otherwise vulnerable to climate-related disturbances.”&lt;ref name=Moench&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moench | first1 = Marcus | last2 = Tyler | first2 = Stephen | year = 2012 | title = A Framework for Urban Climate Resilience | url = | journal = Climate and Development | volume = 4 | issue = | page = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Urban centers around the world house important societal and economic sectors, so resiliency framework has been augmented to specifically include and focus on protecting these urban systems.

The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) defines resilience as “the ability of a social or ecological system to absorb disturbances while retaining the same basic structure and ways of functioning, the capacity of self-organization, and the capacity to adapt to stress and change.”&lt;ref name=Moench/&gt;  One of the most important notions emphasized in urban resiliency theory is the need for urban systems to increase their capacity to absorb environmental disturbances. By focusing on three generalizable elements of the resiliency movement, Tyler and Moench’s urban resiliency framework serves as a model that can be implemented for local planning on an international scale.

The first element of urban climate resiliency focuses on “systems’ or the physical infrastructure embedded in urban systems. A critical concern of urban resiliency is linked to the idea of maintaining support systems that in turn enable the networks of provisioning and exchange for populations in urban areas.&lt;ref name=Moench/&gt;  These systems concern both physical infrastructure in the city and ecosystems within or surrounding the urban center; while working to provide essential services like food production, flood control, or runoff management.&lt;ref name=Moench/&gt;  For example, city electricity, a necessity of urban life, depends on the performance of generators, grids, and distant reservoirs. The failure of these core systems jeopardizes human well-being in these urban areas, with that being said, it is crucial to maintain them in the face of impending environmental disturbances. Societies need to build resiliency into these systems in order to achieve such a feat. Resilient systems work to “ensure that functionality is retained and can be re-instated through system linkages”&lt;ref name=Moench/&gt; despite some failures or operational disturbances. Ensuring the functionality of these important systems is achieved through instilling and maintaining flexibility in the presence of a “safe failure.”&lt;ref name=Moench/&gt;  Resilient systems achieve flexibility by making sure that key functions are distributed in a way that they would not all be affected by a given event at one time, what is often referred to as spatial diversity, and has multiple methods for meeting a given need, what is often referred to as functional diversity.&lt;ref name=Moench/&gt;  The presence of safe failures also plays a critical role in maintaining these systems, which work by absorbing sudden shocks that may even exceed design thresholds.&lt;ref name=Moench/&gt;  Environmental disturbances are certainly expected to challenge the dexterity of these systems, so the presence of safe failures almost certainly appears to be a necessity.

Further, another important component of these systems is bounce-back ability. In the instance where dangerous climatic events affect these urban centers, recovering or "bouncing-back" is of great importance. In fact, in most disaster studies, urban resilience is often defined as "the capacity of a city to rebound from destruction." This idea of bounce-back for urban systems is also engrained in governmental literature of the same topic. For example, the former government's first Intelligence and Security Coordinator of the United States described urban resilience as "the capacity to absorb shocks and to bounce back into functioning shape, or at the least, sufficient resilience to prevent...system collapse." Keeping these quotations in mind, bounce-back discourse has been and should continue to be an important part of urban climate resiliency framework.&lt;ref&gt;Coaffee, Jon. "Towards Next-Generation Urban Resilience in Planning Practice: From Securitization to Integrated Place Making." Planning Practice and Research 28:3. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Other theorists have critiqued this idea of bounce-back, citing this as privileging the status quo, rather advocating the notion of ‘bouncing forward’, permitting system evolution and improvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Insurance as maladaptation: Resilience and the ‘business as usual’ paradox|url = http://epc.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/09/01/0263774X15602022|journal = Environment and Planning C: Government and Policy|date = 2015-09-01|issn = 0263-774X|pages = 0263774X15602022|doi = 10.1177/0263774X15602022|language = en|first = Paul|last = O'Hare|first2 = Iain|last2 = White|first3 = Angela|last3 = Connelly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next element of urban climate resiliency focuses on the social agents (also described as social actors) present in urban centers. Many of these agents depend on the urban centers for their very existence, so they share a common interest of working towards protecting and maintaining their urban surroundings.&lt;ref name=Moench/&gt;  Agents in urban centers have the capacity to deliberate and rationally make decisions, which plays an important role in climate resiliency theory. One cannot overlook the role of local governments and community organizations, which will be forced to make key decisions with regards to organizing and delivering key services and plans for combating the impending effects of climate change.&lt;ref name=Moench/&gt;  Perhaps most importantly, these social agents must increase their capacities with regards to the notions of “resourcefulness and responsiveness.&lt;ref name=Moench/&gt;  Responsiveness refers to the capacity of social actors and groups to organize and re-organize, as well as the ability to anticipate and plan for disruptive events. Resourcefulness refers to the capacity of social actors in urban centers to mobilize varying assets and resources in order to take action.&lt;ref name=Moench/&gt;  Urban centers will be able to better fend for themselves in the heat of climatic disturbances when responsiveness and resourcefulness is collectively achieved in an effective manner.

The final component of urban climate resiliency concerns the social and political institutions present in urban environments. Governance, the process of decision making, is a critical element affecting climate resiliency. As climate justice has revealed, the individual areas and countries that are least responsible for the phenomenon of climate change are also the ones who are going to be most negatively affected by future environmental disturbances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roberts | first1 = Timmons | year = 2009 | title = The International Dimension of Climate Justice and the Need for International Adaptation Funding | url = | journal = Environmental Justice | volume = 2 | issue = | page = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The same is true in urban centers. Those who are most responsible for climate change are going to disproportionately feel the negative effects of climatic disturbances when compared to their poorer, more vulnerable counterparts in society. Just like the wealthier countries have worked to create the most pollution, the wealthier subpopulations of society who can afford carbon-emitting luxuries like cars and homes undoubtedly produce a much more significant carbon footprint. It is also important to note that these more vulnerable populations, because of their inferior social statuses, are unable to participate in the decision-making processes with regards to these issues. Decision-making processes must be augmented to be more participatory and inclusive, allowing those individuals and groups most affected by environmental disturbances to play an active role in determining how to best avoid them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lebel | first1 = L. | last2 = Anderies | first2 = J.

Individual communities who have access to timely information with regards to hazards are better able to respond to these threats.&lt;ref&gt;Satterthwaite, D., Huq, S., Pelling, M., Reid, H., &amp; Lankao, P.R.

===Human resilience===
Global climate change is going to increase the probability of extreme weather events and environmental disturbances around the world, needless to say, future human populations are going to have to confront this issue. Every society around the world differs in its capacity with regards to combating climate change because of certain pre-existing factors such as having the proper monetary and institutional mechanisms in place to execute preparedness and recovery plans. Despite these differences, communities around the world are on a level-playing field with regards to building and maintaining at least some degree “human resilience”.&lt;ref name=Keim&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keim | first1 = Mark | year = 2008 | title = Building Human Resilience: The Role of Public Health Preparedness and Response As an Adaptation to Climate Change | doi = 10.1016/j.amepre.2008.08.022 | journal = American Journal of Preventive Medicine | volume = 35 | issue = 5 | pages=508–516}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Resilience has two components: that provided by nature, and that provided through human action and interaction. An example of climate resilience provided by nature is the manner in which porous soil more effectively allows for the drainage of flood water than more compact soil. An example of human action that affects climate resilience would be the facilitation of response and recovery procedures by social institutions or organizations. This theory of human resilience largely focuses on the human populations and calls for building towards the overall goal of decreasing human vulnerability in the face of climate change and extreme weather events. Vulnerability to climatic disturbances has two sides: the first deals with the degree of exposure to dangerous hazards, which one can effectively identify as susceptibility. The second side deals with the capacity to recover from disaster consequences, or resilience in other words.&lt;ref name=Keim/&gt;  The looming threat of environmental disturbances and extreme weather events certainly calls for some action, and human resiliency theory seeks to solve the issue by largely focusing on decreasing the vulnerability of human populations.

How do human populations work to decrease their vulnerability to impending and dangerous climatic events? Up until recently, the international approach to environmental emergencies focused largely on post-impact activities such as reconstruction and recovery.&lt;ref name=Keim/&gt;  However, the international approach is changing to a more comprehensive risk assessment that includes “pre-impact disaster risk reduction - prevention, preparedness, and mitigation.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Woodruff | first1 =  | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | title = Climate Change and Human Health: Review of the Evidence | url = | journal = Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health | volume = 30 | issue = | year = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the case of human resiliency, preparedness can largely be defined as the measures taken in advance to ensure an effective response to the impact of environmental hazards.&lt;ref name=Keim/&gt;  Mitigation, when viewed in this context, refers to the structural and nonstructural measures undertaken to limit the adverse impacts of climatic disturbances.&lt;ref name=Keim/&gt;  This is not to be confused to mitigation with regards to the overall topic of climate change, which refers to reduction of carbon or greenhouse emissions. By accounting for these impending climate disasters both before and after the occur, human populations are able to decrease their vulnerability to these disturbances.

A major element of building and maintaining human resilience is public health.&lt;ref name=Keim/&gt;  The institution of public health as a whole is uniquely placed at the community level to foster human resilience to climate-related disturbances. As an institution, public health can play an active part in reducing human vulnerability by promoting “healthy people and healthy homes.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Srinivasan | first1 =  | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | title = Creating Healthy Communities, Healthy Homes, Healthy People: Initiating a Research Agenda on the Built Environment and Public Health | url = | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 93 | issue = | year = 2003 | doi=10.2105/ajph.93.9.1446 | pages=1446–1450| pmc = 1447991}}&lt;/ref&gt;)  Healthy people are less likely to suffer from disaster-related mortality and are therefore viewed as more disaster-resilient. Healthy homes are designed and built to maintain its structure and withstand extreme climate events. By merely focusing on the individual health of populations and assuring the durability of the homes that house these populations, at least some degree human resiliency towards climate change can be achieved.

==Climate resilience in practice==
The building of climate resilience is a highly comprehensive undertaking that involves of an eclectic array of actors and agents: individuals, [[community organizations]], micropolitical bodies, [[corporations]], [[governments]] at local, state, and national levels as well as [[international organizations]]. In essence, actions that bolster climate resilience are ones that will enhance the adaptive capacity of social, industrial, and environmental infrastructures that can mitigate the effects of climate change.
&lt;ref name="adger"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Adger | first1 = W. N. | last2 = Arnell | first2 = N. W. | last3 = Tompkins | first3 = E. L. | year = 2005 | title = Successful adaptation to climate change across scales | url = | journal = Global Environmental Change | volume =  15| issue = | pages =  77–86| doi = 10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2004.12.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, research indicates that the strongest indicator of successful climate resilience efforts at all scales is a well-developed, pre-existing network of social, political, economic and financial institutions that is already positioned to effectively take on the work of identifying and addressing the risks posed by climate change. Cities, states, and nations that have already developed such networks are, as expected, to generally have far higher net incomes and GDP. 
&lt;ref name="sather"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Satterthwaite | first1 = D | year = 2013 | title = The political underpinnings of cities' accumulated resilience to climate change | url = | journal = Environment and Urbanization | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 381–391 | doi = 10.1177/0956247813500902 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, it can be seen that embedded within the task of building climate resilience at any scale will be the overcoming of macroscopic [[socioeconomic]] inequities: in many ways, truly facilitating the construction of climate resilient communities worldwide will require national and international agencies to address issues of global [[poverty]], [[industrial development]], and [[food justice]]. However, this does not mean that actions to improve climate resilience cannot be taken in real time at all levels, although evidence suggests that the most climate resilient cities and nations have accumulated this resilience through their responses to previous weather-based disasters. Perhaps even more importantly, empirical evidence suggests that the creation of the climate resilient structures is dependent upon an array of social and environmental reforms that were only successfully passed due to the presence of certain sociopolitical structures such as [[democracy]], activist movements, and [[decentralization]] of government.
&lt;ref name="berkhout"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Berkhout | first1 = Frans | last2 = Hertin | first2 = Julia | last3 = Gann | first3 = David M. | year = 2006 | title = Learning to Adapt: Organisational Adaptation to Climate Change Impacts | url = | journal = Climatic Change | volume = 78 | issue = | pages = 135–56 | doi=10.1007/s10584-006-9089-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Thus it can be seen that to build climate resilience one must work within a network of related social and economic decisions that can have adverse effects on the success of a resilience effort given the competing interests participating in the discussion. Given this, it is clear that the social and economic scale play a vital role in shaping the [[feasibility study|feasibility]], [[cost]]s, empirical success, and [[efficiency]] of climate resilience initiatives. There is a wide variety of actions that can be pursued to improve climate resilience at multiple scales – the following subsections we will review a series of illustrative case studies and strategies from a broad diversity of societal contexts that are currently being implemented to strengthen climate resilience.

===Local and community level===

====Housing and workplace conditions====

[[File:Housing, Kenya 2006. Photo- AusAID (10704025714).jpg|thumb|alt=alt text|Improving housing conditions in Kenya is a prime target for local climate resilience efforts]]

[[Housing inequality]] is directly related to the ability for individuals and communities to sustain adverse impacts brought on by extreme weather events that are triggered by climate change, such as severe winds, storms, and flooding. Especially for communities in developing nations and the Third World, the integrity of housing structures is one of the most significant sources of vulnerability currently. 
&lt;ref name="mertz"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mertz | first1 = Ole | last2 = Halsnaes | first2 = Kirsten | last3 = Olesen | first3 = Jørgen E | last4 = Rasmussen | first4 = Kjeld | year = 2009 | title = Adaptation to Climate Change in Developing Countries | url = | journal = Environmental management | volume = 43 | issue = | pages = 743–52 | doi=10.1007/s00267-008-9259-3| bibcode = 2009EnMan..43..743M }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, even in more developed nations such as the US, there are still multitudes of socioeconomically disadvantaged areas where outdated housing infrastructure is estimated to provide poor climate resilience at best, as well as numerous negative health outcomes.
&lt;ref name="sather" /&gt;

Efforts to improve the resiliency of housing and workplace buildings involves not only fortifying these buildings through use of updated materials and foundation, but also establishing better standards that ensure safer and health conditions for occupants. Better housing standards are in the course of being established through calls for sufficient space, natural lighting, provision for heating or cooling, insulation, and ventilation. Another major issue faced more commonly by communities in the [[Third World]] are highly disorganized and inconsistently enforced housing rights systems. In countries such as [[Kenya]] and [[Nicaragua]], local [[militias]] or corrupted government bodies that have reserved the right to seizure of any housing properties as needed: the end result is the degradation of any ability for citizens to develop climate resilient housing – without property rights for their own homes, the people are powerless to make changes to their housing situation without facing potentially harmful consequences.

&lt;/ref&gt;

====Grassroots community organizing and micropolitical action====

Modern climate resilience scholars have noted that contrary to conventional beliefs, the communities that have been most effective in establishing high levels of climate resilience have actually done so through “bottom-up” political pressures. “Top-down” approaches involving state or federal level decisions have empirically been marred with dysfunction across different levels of government due to internal mismanagement and political gridlock.
&lt;ref name="sather" /&gt;
&lt;ref name="berkhout" /&gt; As a result, in many ways it is being found that the most efficient responses to climate change have actually been initiated and mobilized at local levels. Particularly compelling has been the ability of bottom-up pressures from local civil society to fuel the creation of micropolitical institutions that have compartmentalized the tasks necessary for building climate resilience. For example, the city of [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]] has developed a robust network of micropolitical agencies all dedicated to building resilience in specific industrial sectors: [[transportation]], workplace conditions, emergency shelters, and more.
&lt;ref name="sather" /&gt;
Due to their compact size, local level micropolitical bodies can act quickly without much stagnation and resistance from larger special interests that can generate bureaucratic dysfunction at higher levels of government.

====Low-cost engineering solutions====
Equally important to building climate resilience has been the wide array of basic technological solutions have been developed and implemented at community levels. In developing countries such as [[Mozambique]] and [[Tanzania]], the construction of [[concrete]] “breaker” walls and concentrated use of sandbags in key areas such as housing entrances and doorways has improved the ability of communities to sustain the damages yielded by extreme weather events. Additional strategies have included digging homemade drainage systems to protect local infrastructure of extensive water damage and flooding. 
&lt;ref name="mertz" /&gt;

[[File:Delhi Aerial View, Satellite Image, India September 2003.jpg|thumb|left|alt=alt text|An aerial view of Dehli, India where urban forests are being developed to improve the weather resistance and climate resilience of the city]]

In more urban areas, construction of a “[[green belt]]” on the peripheries of cities has become increasingly common. Green belts are being used as means of improving climate resilience – in addition to provide natural air filtering, these belts of trees have proven to be a healthier and sustainable means of mitigating the damages created by heavy winds and storms.&lt;ref name="sather" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oak"&gt;adaptOakland. "CA Proposition 84 Urban Greening Planning Grant for Adapt Oakland." Web. 12 Mar 2014. {{cite web |url=http://adaptoakland.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2PageLongProjectBrief- |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140409072046/http://adaptoakland.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2PageLongProjectBrief- |archivedate=2014-04-09 |df= }}ForYouToKnow.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===State and national level===
{{Missing information|section=yes|Dominica's new goal to become the world's first climate resilient nation|date=March 2018}}
====Infrastructural development disaster preparedness protocols====

At larger governmental levels, general programs to improve climate resiliency through greater [[disaster]] preparedness are being implemented. For example, in cases such as [[Norway]], this includes the development of more sensitive and far-reaching early warning systems for extreme weather events, creation of emergency [[electricity]] power sources, enhanced public transportation systems, and more. 
&lt;ref name ="obrien"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = O'Brien | first1 = Karen | last2 = Eriksen | first2 = Siri | last3 = Sygna | first3 = Linda | last4 = Otto Naess | first4 = Lars | year = 2006 | title = Questioning Complacency: Climate Change Impacts, Vulnerability, and Adaptation in Norway | url = | journal = Ambio | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 50–56 | doi=10.1579/0044-7447(2006)35[50:qccciv]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
To examine another case study, the state [[California]] in the US has been pursuing more comprehensive federal financial aid systems for communities afflicted by natural disaster, spurred in part by the large amounts of criticism that was placed on the US federal government after what was perceived by many to be a mishandling of [[Hurricane Katrina]] and [[Hurricane Sandy]] relief.

Additionally, a key focus of action at state and federal levels is in improving water management infrastructure and access. Strategies include the creation of [[emergency]] drinking water supplies, stronger [[sanitation]] technology and standards, as well as more extensive and efficient networks of water delivery.

====Social services====

Climate resilience literature has also noted that one of the more indirect sources of resilience actually lies in the strength of the [[social services]] and [[social safety net]] that is provided for citizens by public institutions. This is an especially critical aspect of climate resilience in more socioeconomically disadvantaged communities, cities, and nations. It has been empirically found that places with stronger systems of [[social security]] and [[pensions]] oftentimes have better climate resiliency.
&lt;ref name="sather" /&gt; This is reasoning in the following manner: first of all, better social services for citizens translates to better access to [[healthcare]], [[education]], [[life insurance]], and emergency services. Secondly, stronger systems of social services also generally increase the overall ownership of relevant economic assets that are correlated with better quality of life such as savings, house ownership, and more. Nations where residents are on more stable economic footing are in situations where there is a far higher incentive for private investment into climate resilience efforts.&lt;ref name="sather" /&gt;

===Global level===

====International treaties====

At the global level, most action towards climate resilience has been manifested in the signing of international agreements that set up guidelines and frameworks to address the impacts of climate change. Notable examples include the 1992 [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC), the 1997 [[Kyoto Protocol]] to the UNFCCC, and the 2010 Cancun Agreement.&lt;ref name="unfcc"&gt;
Unfccc. 2007. "Climate Change: Impacts, Vulnerabilities and Adaptation in Developing Countries." United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change: 68. http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/publications/impacts.pdf.
&lt;/ref&gt;
In some cases, as is the case with the Kyoto Protocol for example, these international treaties involve placing legally binding requirements on participant nations to reduce processes that contribute to global warming such as greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref name="kyoto"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Prins | first1 = Gwyn | year = 2011 | title = Climate Change: Beyond Kyoto | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 474 | issue = | pages = 576–77 | doi=10.1038/474576a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rabe"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rabe | first1 = Barry G | year = 2007 | title = Beyond Kyoto: Climate Change Policy in Multilevel Governance Systems | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-0491.2007.00365.x | journal = Governance | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 423–44 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In other cases, such as the [[2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in Cancun, proposals for the creation of international funding pools to assist developing nations in combating climate change are seen.&lt;ref name="raj"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rajamani | first1 = Lavanya | year = 2011 | title = The Cancun Climate Agreements: Reading the Text, Subtext and Tea Leaves | url = | journal = International and Comparative Law Quarterly | volume = 60 | issue = | pages = 499–519 | doi=10.1017/s0020589311000078}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, that enforcement of any of the requirements or principles that are established in such international treaties has ambiguous: for example, although the 2010 Cancun conference called for the creation of a 100 billion dollar “Green Climate Fund” for developing nations, if and how this fund will actually be created still remains unclear.&lt;ref name="ober"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Oberthür | first1 = Sebastian | year = 2011 | title = Global Climate Governance after Cancun: Options for EU Leadership | url = | journal = The International Spectator | volume = 46 | issue = | pages = 5–13 | doi=10.1080/03932729.2011.567900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Case studies===
As the looming threat of [[climate change]] and environmental disturbances becomes more and more immediate, so does the need for policy to combat the issue. As a relatively new phenomenon, climate change has yet to receive the political attention it deserves. However, the climate justice and [[climate change]] movements are gaining momentum on an international scale as both grass roots campaigns and supranational organizations begin to gain influence.&lt;ref&gt;Chawla, Ambika, “Climate Justice Movements Gather Strength,” WorldWatch, State of the World. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the most significant and impacting changes come from national and state governments around the world, as they have the political and monetary power to more effectively enforce their proposals.

====United States (as a country)====
As it stands today, there is no country-wide legislation with regards to the topic of climate resiliency in the United States. However, in mid February 2014, President [[Barack Obama]] announced his plan to propose a $1 billion “Climate Resilience Fund”.&lt;ref name=News&gt;Malakoff, David. "Obama to Propose $1 Billion Climate Resilience Fund." Sciencemag.org. http://news.sciencemag.org/climate/2014/02/obama-propose-1-billion-climate-resilience-fund. 15, February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  The details of exactly what the fund will seek to accomplish are vague since the fund is only in the stage of being proposed for Congress’s approval in 2015. However, in the speech given the day of the announcement of this proposal, Obama claimed he will request “...new funding for new technologies to help communities prepare for a changing climate, set up incentives to build smarter, more resilient infrastructure. And finally, my administration will work with tech innovators and launch new challenges under our [[Climate Data Initiative]], focused initially on rising sea levels and their impact on the coasts, but ultimately focused on how all these changes in weather patterns are going to have an impact up and down the United States - not just on the coast but inland as well - and how do we start preparing for that.”&lt;ref name=News/&gt;  Obama’s fund incorporates facets of both urban resiliency and human resiliency theories, by necessarily improving communal infrastructure and by focusing on societal preparation to decrease the country’s vulnerability to the impacts of climate change.

====Phoenix, Arizona====
Phoenix’s large population and extremely dry climate make the city particularly vulnerable to the threats of drought and extreme heat. However, the city has recently incorporated climate change into current (and future) water management and urban design. And by doing so, [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] has taken steps to ensure sustainable water supplies and to protect populations that are vulnerable to extreme heat, largely through improving the sustainability and efficiency of communal infrastructure. For example, Phoenix uses renewable surface water supplies and reserves groundwater for use during the instance when extended droughts arise. The city is also creating a task force to redesign the downtown core to minimize the way buildings trap heat and increase local temperatures.&lt;ref name=EPA&gt;EPA. “Climate Impacts and Adaptation Examples in the Southwest.” http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/impacts-adaptation/southwest-adaptation.html.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[File:Phoenix skyline Arizona USA.jpg|thumb|left|alt=alt text| The outdated infrastructure pictured here in the Phoenix downtown will be undergoing drastic changes geared towards improvements in efficiency.]]

====Denver, Colorado====
The city of [[Denver]] has made recent strides to combat the threat of extreme wildfires and precipitation events. In the year 1996, a fire burned nearly 12,000 acres around [[Buffalo Creek, Colorado|Buffalo Creek]], which serves as the main source of the city’s water supply. Two months following this devastating wildfire, heavy thunderstorms caused flash floods in the burned area, having the effect of washing sediment into the city’s reservoir. In fact, this event washed more sediment into the reservoir than had accumulated in the 13 years prior. Water treatment costs were estimated to be $20 million over the next decade following the event. Denver needed a plan to make sure that the city would not be devastated by future wildfire and flash flood events. DenverWater and the U.S. Forest Service Rocky Mountain Region are working together to restore more than 40,000 acres of [[United States National Forest|National Forest]]s lands through processes like reforestation, erosion control, and the decommissioning of roads. Further, [[Denver]] has installed sensors in the reservoirs in order to monitor the quality of the water and quantity of debris or sediment. These accomplishments will have the effect of building a more resilient Denver, Colorado towards the impending increase of extreme weather events such as wildfire and flooding.&lt;ref name=EPA/&gt;

====China====
[[File:Juncture of three main rivers in Ningbo China.jpg|thumb|right|alt=alt text| Pictured here is the conversion of three large rivers in Ningbo, China. The country is taking substantial measures to combat the flash floods predicted to intensify in the future.]]
[[China]] has been rapidly emerging as a new superpower, rivaling the [[United States]]. As the most populated country in the world, and one of the leaders of the global economy, China’s response to the impending effects of climate change is of great concern for the entire world. A number of significant changes are expected to affect China as the looming threat of [[climate change]] becomes more and more imminent. Here’s just one example; China has experienced a seven-fold increase in the frequency of floods since the 1950s, rising every decade. The frequency of extreme rainfall has increased and is predicted to continue to increase in the western and southern parts of China. The country is currently undertaking efforts to reduce the threat of these floods (which have the potential effect of completely destroying vulnerable communities), largely focusing on improving the infrastructure responsible for tracking and maintaining adequate water levels. That being said, the country is promoting the extension of technologies for water allocation and water-saving mechanisms. In the country’s [[National Climate Change Policy Program]], one of the goals specifically set out is to enhance the ability to bear the impacts of climate change, as well as to raise the public awareness on climate change. China’s National Climate Change Policy states that it will integrate climate change policies into the national development strategy. In China, this national policy comes in the form of its "Five Year Plans for Economic and Social Development". China’s Five Year Plans serve as the strategic road maps for the country’s development. The goals spelled out in the Five Year Plans are mandatory as government officials are held responsible for meeting the targets.&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;King et al. 2012.

University of Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;

====India====
As the world’s second most populous country, [[India]] is taking action on a number of fronts in order to address [[poverty]], natural resource management, as well as preparing for the inevitable effects of [[climate change]]. India has made significant strides in the energy sector and the country is now a global leader in renewable energy.  In 2011 India achieved a record $10.3 billion (USD) in clean energy investments, which the country is now using to fund solar, wind, and hydropower projects around the country. In 2008, India published its National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC), which contains several goals for the country. These goals include but are not limited to: covering one third of the country with forests and trees, increasing renewable energy supply to 6% of total energy mix by 2022, and the further maintenance of disaster management. All of the actions work to improve the resiliency of the country as a whole, and this proves to be important because India has an economy closely tied to its natural resource base and climate-sensitive sectors such as agriculture, water, and forestry.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10029">'''Community arts''', also sometimes known as "dialogical art", "community-engaged" or "community-based art," refers to artistic activity based in a [[community]] setting. Works from this genre can be of any media and is characterized by interaction or dialogue with the community. Often professional artists collaborate with people who may not otherwise normally actively engage in the arts. The term was defined in the late-1960s and spawned a movement which grew in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], the [[Netherlands]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Ireland]], and [[Australia]]. In [[Scandinavia]], the term "community art" means more often contemporary art project.

Often community art is based in economically deprived areas, with a community-oriented, grassroots approach. Members of a local community will come together to express concerns or issues through an artistic process, sometimes this may involve professional artists or actors. These communal artistic processes act as a catalyst to trigger events or changes within a community or even at a national or international level.

In English-speaking countries, community art is often seen as the work of community [[arts centre]]. [[Visual arts]] ([[fine art]], video, [[new media art]]), music, and theater are common mediums in community art centers. Many arts companies in the UK do some community-based work, which typically involves developing participation by non-professional members of local communities.

== Community art and public art ==
The term "community art" refers also to the field of community, neighbourhood and public art practice with roots in social justice and popular and informal education methods. In the art world, community art signifies a particular art making practice, emphasizing community involvement and collaboration. Community art is most often art for social change and involves some empowerment of the community members who come together to create artwork/s with artists. This is a growing national, international, regional and local field. Recently community arts and sustainability work or environmental action have begun to interface, including urban revitalization projects creating artwork at a neighbourhood level.

== Forms of Collaborative Practices ==
Models of community-engaged arts can vary with three forms of collaborative practices emerging from among the sets of common practices. In the artist-driven model, artists are seen as the catalysts for social change through the social commentary addressed in their works. A muralist whose work elicits and sustains political dialogue would be a practitioner of this model. In the second model, artists engage with community groups to facilitate specialized forms of art creation, often with the goal of presenting the work in a public forum to promote awareness and to further discourse within a larger community. In the process-driven or dialogic model, artists may engage with a group in order to facilitate an artistic process that addresses particular concerns specific to the group. The use of an artistic process (such as dance or [[Social Circus|social circus]]) for problem-solving, therapeutic, group-empowerment or strategic planning purposes may result in artistic works that are not intended for public presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://icasc.ca/what-art-social-change|title=What is Art for Social Change? {{!}} Art for Social Change|website=icasc.ca|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second and third models, the individuals who collaborate on the artistic creation may not define themselves as artists but are considered practitioners of an art-making process that produces social change.

Due to its roots in social justice and collaborative, community-based nature, art for social change may be considered a form of cultural democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Melucci|first=Alberto|last2=Avritzer|first2=Leonardo|date=2000-12-01|title=Complexity, cultural pluralism and democracy: collective action in the public space|url=http://ssi.sagepub.com/content/39/4/507|journal=Social Science Information|language=en|volume=39|issue=4|pages=507–527|doi=10.1177/053901800039004001|issn=0539-0184}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Often, the processes (or the works produced by these processes) intend to create or promote spaces for participatory public dialogue.

In Canada, the field of community-engaged arts has recently seen broader use of art for social change practices by non-arts change organizations. The resultant partnerships have enabled these collaborative communities to address systemic issues in health, education, as well as empowerment for indigenous, immigrant, LGBT and youth communities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://icasc.ca/sites/default/files/resource_attachments/stateoftheart_en.pdf http://icasc.ca/sites/default/files/resource_attachments/stateoftheart_en.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; A similar social innovation trend has appeared where business development associations have engaged with artists/artistic organizations to co-produce cultural festivals or events that address social concerns.

As the field diversifies and practices are adopted by various organizations from multiple disciplines, ethics and safety have become a concern to practitioners.[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10805-016-9257-7?wt_mc=internal.event.1.SEM.ArticleAuthorOnlineFirst] As a result, opportunities for cross-disciplinary training in art for social change practices have grown within the related field of [[Arts in education|arts education]].

== Online community art ==
A [[community]] can be seen in many ways, it can refer to different kind of groups. There are also [[virtual communities]] or online communities.  [[Internet art]] has many different forms, but often there is some kind of community that is created for a project or it is an effect of an art project.

==Community theatre==
[[Community theatre]] includes theatre made by, with, and for a community—it may refer to theatre that is made almost by a community with no outside help, or to a collaboration between community members and professional theatre artists, or to performance made entirely by professionals that is addressed to a particular community. Community theatres range in size from small groups led by single individuals that perform in borrowed spaces to large permanent companies with well-equipped facilities of their own. Many community theatres are successful, non-profit businesses with a large active membership and, often, a full-time professional staff. Community theatre is often [[devised theatre|devised]] and may draw on popular theatrical forms, such as [[carnival]], [[circus]], and [[parade]]s, as well as performance modes from commercial theatre. Community theatre is understood to contribute to the [[social capital]] of a community, insofar as it develops the skills, community spirit, and artistic sensibilities of those who participate, whether as producers or audience-members.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6767">'''Constitutive rhetoric''' is a theory of [[discourse]] devised by [[James Boyd White]] about the capacity of [[language]] or [[symbols]] to create a collective [[identity (philosophy)|identity]] for an [[audience]], especially by means of [[condensation symbols]], [[literature]], and [[narratives]].&lt;ref&gt;Sloane, Thomas, ed. “Constitutive Rhetoric” Encyclopedia of Rhetoric (New York: Oxford University Press, 2001), 616.&lt;/ref&gt; Such discourse often demands that action be taken to reinforce the identity and the beliefs of that identity. White explains that it denotes “the art of constituting character, community and culture in language.”&lt;ref&gt;James Boyd White, ''Heracles’ Bow'' (Madison, WI: University of Wisconsin, 1985), 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of Constitutive Rhetorical Theory==

The constitutive model of [[rhetoric]] dates back to the ancient Greek [[Sophism|Sophists]], with theories that speech moved audiences to action based on a contingent, shared knowledge.  [[Kenneth Burke]] contributed to the theory of constitutive rhetoric by highlighting identification, rather than persuasion, as the major means by which language functioned. Burke contended that social identity is founded “spontaneously, intuitively, even unconsciously.”&lt;ref&gt;Charland, Maurice. “Constitutive Rhetoric: The Case of the Peuple Québécois.” (The Quarterly Journal of Speech 73.2 1987), 133.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edwin Black (rhetorician)|Edwin Black's]] theory of the [[second persona]] also aided scholars in rhetoric to analyze the imagined shared values and beliefs between speaker and audience through [[textual analysis]]. Audience must adopt a particular [[ethos]] prior to being persuaded by constitutive rhetoric, thus the ethos of the subject of discourse can be critically studied and interpreted through a text.&lt;ref&gt;Sloane, “Constitutive Rhetoric”, 617.&lt;/ref&gt;

While these theorists all contributed to the theory of constitutive rhetoric, [[James Boyd White]] was the first to coin the term. In 1985, he explained that the term “constitutive rhetoric” described [[rhetoric]] that called a common, collective identity into existence. White wrote that persuasion and identification occur only when audiences already understand and relate to method and content. Thus, speech happens within [[culture]], and speakers adapt messages to reflect the ideas and views of a community. When speeches address a diverse crowd as though they are of one community, White describes this as “calling [identity] into being” through [[material culture|material]] [[identification (psychology)|identification]].

According to White, there are two methods of convincing an audience that they belong to an identity. The first is ''peithõ'', persuasion, and the second is deceitful manipulation, or ''dolos''. Using ''peithõ'', speakers convince audiences of shared identity openly and honestly. ''Dolos'' creates belonging through deceit.&lt;ref&gt;White, Heracles’ Bow, 39-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, Maurice Charland further emphasized the importance of the [[narrative]] and [[Marxist theory]]&lt;ref&gt;Sloane, “Constitutive Rhetoric”, 616.&lt;/ref&gt;  He observed, “While classical narratives have an ending, constitutive rhetorics leave the task of narrative closure to their constituted subjects”.&lt;ref&gt;Jasinski, James. “Narrative” Sourcebook on Rhetoric (Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, 2001), 403.&lt;/ref&gt;  Charland’s theory draws from Burke and the philosopher [[Louis Althusser]]. Althusser explained [[Interpellation (philosophy)|interpellation]], or "hailing," as the social phenomenon of a mass audience having already been “recruited” by an [[ideology]]. Ideologies create subjects of discourse for persuasion by further discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Althusser, Louis. “Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses.” The Anthropology of the State (Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing, 2006), 105.&lt;/ref&gt;
In other words, “the very existence of social subjects (who would become audience members) is already a rhetorical effect.” &lt;ref&gt;Charland, “Constitutive Rhetoric: The Case of the Peuple Québécois.”,1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Political speeches, manifestos, and resistance movements participate in this type of discourse, to establish an identity and a call to action within that identity.&lt;ref&gt;Sloane, “Constitutive Rhetoric”, 617.&lt;/ref&gt;  A leader’s speech calling a “nation” to war establishes a national identity within the discourse or text. A feminist speaking on women’s right establishes the identity of the “woman”. An African-American protesting during the [[Civil Rights Movement]] established an “African-American” identity. Every audience member may take part in shared identity because of common symbolic resources, even as the text may especially [[Interpellation (philosophy)|interpellate]] a smaller sub-group of the [[audience]]. An identity must be established in contrast to another identity. This creates divisions between “us” and “them,” sometimes creating extreme divisions between different identifications.

In 2015, Halstrøm and Galle picked up on constitutive rhetoric within the field of design studies. They explained how it may provide useful concepts for analysing designed artefacts. Design may be said to aim at providing an audience with a subject position, which it is to confirm. Thus, it aims at persuading by seeking to constitute its audience.&lt;ref&gt;Halstrøm, P. L. &amp; P. Galle. “Design as co-evolution of problem, solution, and audience.” Artifact 3(4), (2015): 3.1-3.13. {{DOI|10.14434/artifact.v3i4.12815}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
Constitutive rhetoric and theories of logical persuasion (such as [[New Criticism]] or [[Neo-Aristotelianism]]) can be used together, but constitutive rhetoric presumes that belief and identity always precedes logical persuasion. Thus, constitutive rhetoric must address the previous identity and must either coincide with it, or change it.&lt;ref&gt;Sloane, “Constitutive Rhetoric”, 617.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Derrida]] criticized the paradox of constitutive rhetoric when he analyzed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. He explained that the men signing the Declaration claimed to be representatives of “the people,” but the people were not yet defined as a nation until that Declaration was signed. His criticism explains that an identity must be established before that identity exists in order for the speaker to represent the ideals of that identity, thus creating a paradoxical relationship in which only a third perspective can truly analyze the identity of the audience.&lt;ref&gt;Sloane, “Constitutive Rhetoric”, 618.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classification ==
Developmental coordination disorder is classified in the fifth revision of the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'' ([[DSM-5]]) as a [[motor disorder]], in the category of [[neurodevelopmental disorder]]s.&lt;ref name=DSM315.4&gt;{{Cite book | author= American Psychiatric Association | year= 2013 | title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders | edition=Fifth | publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing | location=Arlington, VA | pages=74–7 | isbn= 978-0-89042-555-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harris SR, Mickelson EC, Zwicker JG | title = Diagnosis and management of developmental coordination disorder | journal = Canadian Medical Association Journal | volume = 187 | issue = 9 | pages = 659–65 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 26009588 | pmc = 4467929 | doi = 10.1503/cmaj.140994 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Signs and symptoms ==
Various areas of development can be affected by developmental coordination disorder and these will persist into adulthood,&lt;ref name="Kirby 2010" /&gt; as DCD has no cure. Often various coping strategies are developed, and these can be enhanced through occupational therapy, psychomotor therapy, physiotherapy, speech therapy, or psychological training.

In addition to the physical impairments, developmental coordination disorder is associated with problems with memory, especially [[working memory]].&lt;ref name="Alloway Rajendran 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Alloway TP, Rajendran G, Archibald LM | title = Working memory in children with developmental disorders | journal = Journal of Learning Disabilities | volume = 42 | issue = 4 | pages = 372–82 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19380495 | doi = 10.1177/0022219409335214 | hdl = 1893/863 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This typically results in difficulty remembering instructions, difficulty organizing one's time and remembering deadlines, increased propensity to lose things or problems carrying out tasks which require remembering several steps in sequence (such as cooking). Whilst most of the general population experience these problems to some extent, they have a much more significant impact on the lives of dyspraxic people.&lt;ref name="Biggs 2005 (3)"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Biggs | first1 = Victoria | name-list-format = vanc | title = Caged in chaos : a dyspraxic guide to breaking free | chapter = 3 A Survival Guide to School | publisher = Jessica Kingsley Publishers | year = 2005 | location = London ; Philadelphia  |oclc=57316751  | isbn = 978-1-84310-347-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many dyspraxics have excellent [[Long-term memory|long-term memories]], despite poor [[short-term memory]].&lt;ref name="Biggs 2005 (3)" /&gt; Many dyspraxics benefit from working in a structured environment, as repeating the same routine minimises difficulty with time-management and allows them to commit procedures to long-term memory.

People with developmental coordination disorder sometimes have difficulty moderating the amount of sensory information that their body is constantly sending them, so as a result dyspraxics are prone to [[sensory overload]] and [[panic attack]]s.&lt;ref name="Biggs 2005 (3)" /&gt;

Moderate to extreme difficulty doing physical tasks is experienced by some dyspraxics, and fatigue is common because so much energy is expended trying to execute physical movements correctly. Some dyspraxics suffer from [[hypotonia]], low muscle tone, which like DCD can detrimentally affect balance.&lt;ref name="Barnhart 2003" /&gt;

=== Gross motor control ===
Whole body movement and [[motor coordination]] issues mean that major developmental targets including walking, running, climbing and jumping can be affected. The difficulties vary from person to person and can include the following:
* Poor timing&lt;ref name="Missiuna 2006"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Missiuna C, Gaines R, Soucie H, McLean J | title = Parental questions about developmental coordination disorder: A synopsis of current evidence | journal = Paediatrics &amp; Child Health | volume = 11 | issue = 8 | pages = 507–12 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 19030319 | pmc = 2528644 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Poor balance&lt;ref name="Missiuna 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Geuze 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Geuze RH | title = Postural control in children with developmental coordination disorder | journal = Neural Plasticity | volume = 12 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 183–96; discussion 263–72 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16097486 | pmc = 2565450 | doi = 10.1155/NP.2005.183 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (sometimes even falling over in mid-step).  Tripping over one's own feet is also common.
* Difficulty combining movements into a controlled sequence.
* Difficulty remembering the next movement in a sequence.
* Problems with spatial awareness,&lt;ref name="Geuze 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson 1988"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilson PH, McKenzie BE | title = Information processing deficits associated with developmental coordination disorder: a meta-analysis of research findings | journal = Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, and Allied Disciplines | volume = 39 | issue = 6 | pages = 829–40 | date = September 1998 | pmid = 9758192 | doi = 10.1111/1469-7610.00384 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[proprioception]].
* Trouble picking up and holding onto simple objects such as pencils, owing to poor muscle tone or proprioception.
* Clumsiness to the point of knocking things over, causing minor injuries to oneself and bumping into people accidentally.
* Difficulty in [[Relative direction#Left-right confusion|determining left from right]].
* Cross-laterality, [[ambidexterity]], and a shift in the preferred hand are also common in people with developmental coordination disorder.

=== Developmental verbal dyspraxia ===
[[Developmental verbal dyspraxia|Developmental verbal dyspraxia (DVD)]] is a type of ideational dyspraxia, causing [[speech and language impairment]]s. This is the favoured term in the UK; however, it is also sometimes referred to as articulatory dyspraxia, and in the United States the usual term is childhood apraxia of speech (CAS).&lt;ref name="Vargha-Khadem 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vargha-Khadem F, Gadian DG, Copp A, Mishkin M | title = FOXP2 and the neuroanatomy of speech and language | journal = Nature Reviews.

However, they are unlikely to have all of these conditions. The pattern of difficulty varies widely from person to person; an area of major weakness for one dyspraxic can be an area of strength or gift for another. For example, while some dyspraxics have difficulty with reading and spelling due to dyslexia, or with numeracy due to dyscalculia, others may have brilliant reading and spelling or mathematical abilities. Some estimates show that up to 50% of dyspraxics have ADHD.&lt;ref name="Barkley 1990"&gt;{{cite book | last = Barkley | first = Russell A. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder: a handbook for diagnosis and treatment |publisher=Guilford Press |location=New York |year=1990 |pages= |isbn=978-0-89862-443-4 |oclc=21335369  |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- v --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cravedi E, Deniau E, Giannitelli M, Xavier J, Hartmann A, Cohen D | title = Tourette syndrome and other neurodevelopmental disorders: a comprehensive review | journal = Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Mental Health | volume = 11 | pages = 59 | date = 2017-12-04 | pmid = 29225671 | pmc = 5715991 | doi = 10.1186/s13034-017-0196-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sensory processing disorder ===
{{Main|Sensory processing disorder}}
'''Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD)''' concerns having oversensitivity or undersensitivity to physical stimuli, such as touch, light, sound, and smell.&lt;ref name="Miller 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Miller LJ, Anzalone ME, Lane SJ, Cermak SA, Osten ET | title = Concept evolution in sensory integration: a proposed nosology for diagnosis | journal = The American Journal of Occupational Therapy | volume = 61 | issue = 2 | pages = 135–40 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17436834 | doi = 10.5014/ajot.61.2.135 | url = http://www.spdfoundation.net/pdf/Miller_Anzalone.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121024223226/http://spdfoundation.net/pdf/Miller_Anzalone.pdf | df =  | deadurl = yes | archive-date = 2012-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This may manifest itself as an inability to tolerate certain textures such as [[sandpaper]] or certain fabrics such as wool, oral intolerance of excessively textured food (commonly known as picky eating), being touched by another individual (in the case of touch oversensitivity) or it may require the consistent use of sunglasses outdoors since sunlight may be intense enough to cause discomfort to a dyspraxic (in the case of light oversensitivity). An aversion to loud music and naturally loud environments (such as clubs and bars) is typical behavior of a dyspraxic individual who suffers from [[Hyperacusis|auditory oversensitivity]], while only being comfortable in unusually warm or cold environments is typical of a dyspraxic with temperature oversensitivity. Undersensitivity to stimuli may also cause problems. Dyspraxics who are undersensitive to pain may injure themselves without realising it.&lt;ref name="Biggs 2005 (2)" /&gt; Some dyspraxics may be oversensitive to some stimuli and undersensitive to others.&lt;ref name="Biggs 2005 (2)" /&gt;

=== Specific language impairment ===
{{Main|Specific language impairment}}
'''Specific Language Impairment (SLI)''' research has found that students with developmental coordination disorder and normal language skills still experience learning difficulties despite relative strengths in language. This means that for students with developmental coordination disorder their working memory abilities determine their learning difficulties. Any strength in language that they have is not able to sufficiently support their learning.&lt;ref name="Alloway 2008" /&gt;

Students with developmental coordination disorder struggle most in visual-spatial memory. When compared to their peers who don’t have motor difficulties, students with developmental coordination disorder are seven times more likely than typically developing students to achieve very poor scores in visual-spatial memory.&lt;ref name="Alloway 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Alloway TP | title = Working memory, reading, and mathematical skills in children with developmental coordination disorder | journal = Journal of Experimental Child Psychology | volume = 96 | issue = 1 | pages = 20–36 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17010988 | doi = 10.1016/j.jecp.2006.07.002 | hdl = 1893/800 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this working memory impairment, students with developmental coordination disorder have learning deficits as well.&lt;ref name="Alloway Temple 2007"&gt;{{cite journal  | vauthors  = Alloway TP, Temple K | title=A Comparison of Working Memory Profiles and Learning in Children with Developmental Coordination Disorder and Moderate Learning Difficulties|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology| volume=21| issue=4| pages=473–487| year=2007 |doi=10.1002/acp.1284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychological and social consequences ===
'''Psychological domain:''' Children with DCD struggle with lower self-efficacy and lower self-perceived competence in peer and social relations. They demonstrate greater aggressiveness and hyperactivity.&lt;ref name="Zwicker 562–580"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zwicker JG, Harris SR, Klassen AF | title = Quality of life domains affected in children with developmental coordination disorder: a systematic review | journal = Child | volume = 39 | issue = 4 | pages = 562–80 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 22515477 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2214.2012.01379.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social domain:'''  Children are more vulnerable to social rejection and bullying, along with higher levels of loneliness.&lt;ref name="Zwicker 562–580" /&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
Assessments for developmental coordination disorder typically require a developmental history,&lt;ref name="Gibbs 2007" /&gt; detailing ages at which significant [[developmental milestones]], such as [[crawling (human)|crawling]] and [[walking]],&lt;ref name="Zwicker 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Henderson 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirby 2007" /&gt; occurred. Motor skills screening includes activities designed to indicate developmental coordination disorder, including balancing, physical sequencing, touch sensitivity, and variations on walking activities.

The [[American Psychiatric Association]] has four primary inclusive diagnostic criteria{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kirby A, Sugden DA | title = Children with developmental coordination disorders | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine | volume = 100 | issue = 4 | pages = 182–6 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 17404341 | pmc = 1847727 | doi = 10.1177/014107680710011414 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for determining if a [[child]] has developmental coordination disorder.

The criteria are as follows:
# Motor Coordination will be greatly reduced, although the intelligence of the child is normal for the age.
# The difficulties the child experiences with motor coordination or planning interfere with the child's daily life.
# The difficulties with coordination are not due to any other medical condition
# If the child does also experience comorbidities such as mental retardation; motor coordination is still disproportionally affected.&lt;ref name="Gibbs 2007"/&gt;

Currently there is no single gold standard assessment test.&lt;ref name="Cools-2009" /&gt;

A baseline motor assessment establishes the starting point for developmental intervention programs. Comparing children to normal rates of development may help to establish areas of significant difficulty.

However, research in the ''[[British Journal of Special Education]]'' has shown that knowledge is severely limited in many who should be trained to recognise and respond to various difficulties, including developmental coordination disorder, [[dyslexia]] and [[Deficits in Attention, Motor control and Perception|deficits in attention, motor control and perception (DAMP)]].&lt;ref name="Kirby 2007" /&gt; The earlier that difficulties are noted and timely assessments occur, the quicker intervention can begin.  A teacher or [[General practitioner|GP]] could miss a diagnosis if they are only applying a cursory knowledge.

==Management==
There is no cure for the condition. Instead, it is managed through therapy. [[Occupational therapy]] or [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] can help those living with the condition.

Some people with the condition find it helpful to find alternative ways of carrying out tasks or organizing themselves, such as typing on a laptop instead of writing by hand, or using diaries and calendars to keep organized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/developmental-coordination-disorder-dyspraxia-in-adults/#treatment-for-dyspraxia | title=Dyspraxia (developmental co-ordination disorder) in adults| date=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Epidemiology ==
Developmental coordination disorder is a lifelong [[neurological]] condition that is more common in [[males]] than in [[females]], with a ratio of approximately four males to every female. The exact proportion of people with the disorder is unknown since the disorder can be difficult to detect due to a lack of specific laboratory tests, thus making diagnosis of the condition one of elimination of all other possible causes/diseases. Approximately 5–6% of [[children]] are affected by this condition.&lt;ref name="Barnhart 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Blank 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zwicker 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gaines R, Missiuna C, Egan M, McLean J | title = Educational outreach and collaborative care enhances physician's perceived knowledge about Developmental Coordination Disorder | journal = BMC Health Services Research | volume = 8 | pages = 21 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 18218082 | pmc = 2254381 | doi = 10.1186/1472-6963-8-21 | url = http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6963/8/21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline |date=October 2016}}&lt;!---What about adults???

== History ==
Collier first described developmental coordination disorder as 'congenital maladroitness'. [[Anna Jean Ayres|A. Jean Ayres]] referred to developmental coordination disorder as a disorder of sensory integration in 1972,&lt;ref name="Ayres 1972"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ayres AJ | title = Types of sensory integrative dysfunction among disabled learners | journal = The American Journal of Occupational Therapy | volume = 26 | issue = 1 | pages = 13–8 | year = 1972 | pmid = 5008164 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Willoughby 1995"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Willoughby C, Polatajko HJ | title = Motor problems in children with developmental coordination disorder: review of the literature | journal = The American Journal of Occupational Therapy | volume = 49 | issue = 8 | pages = 787–94 | date = September 1995 | pmid = 8526224 | doi = 10.5014/ajot.49.8.787 | url = http://ajot.aotapress.net/content/49/8/787.full.pdf+html }}&lt;/ref&gt; while in 1975 Sasson Gubbay, MD, called it the 'clumsy child syndrome'.&lt;ref name="Gibbs 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gillberg 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gubbay 1978"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gubbay SS | title = The management of developmental apraxia | journal = Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology | volume = 20 | issue = 5 | pages = 643–6 | date = October 1978 | pmid = 729912 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-8749.1978.tb15283.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Developmental coordination disorder has also been called minimal brain dysfunction although the two latter names are no longer in use.

Other names include: Developmental Apraxia,&lt;ref name="Gibbs 2007" /&gt; [[Deficits in attention, motor control and perception|Disorder of Attention and Motor Perception (DAMP)]]&lt;ref name="Gibbs 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gillberg 2003" /&gt; Dyspraxia,&lt;ref name="Henderson 2003" /&gt;  Developmental Dyspraxia,&lt;ref name="Gibbs 2007" /&gt; Motor Learning Difficulties,&lt;ref name="Gibbs 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gillberg 2003" /&gt; Perceptuo-motor dysfunction,&lt;ref name="Gibbs 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gillberg 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Willoughby 1995" /&gt; Sensorimotor dysfunction.&lt;ref name="Gibbs 2007" /&gt;

{{Disability}}
'''Disability studies''' is an academic discipline that examines the meaning, nature, and consequences of [[disability]]. Initially the field focused on the division between "impairment" and "disability", where impairment was an impairment of an individual's mind or body, while disability was considered a [[social constructionism|social construct]].&lt;ref name=MLA&gt;{{cite web|title=Session Details: Avenues of Access: The State of Disability Studies|url=http://www.mla.org/conv_listings_detail?prog_id=570&amp;year=2013|website=Modern Language Association|publisher=Modern Language Association|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This premise gave rise to two distinct models of disability: the [[Social model of disability|social]] and [[medical model of disability|medical]] models of disability. In 1999 the social model was universally accepted as the model preferred by the field.&lt;ref name=Models1999&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bickenbacha|first1=Jerome E|last2=Chatterji|first2=Somnath|last3=Badley|first3=E.M.|last4=Üstün|first4=T.B.|title=Models of disablement, universalism and the international classification of impairments, disabilities and handicaps|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|date=1999|volume=48|issue=9|pages=1173–1187|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953698004419%20/%20bbib10|accessdate=26 March 2015|doi=10.1016/s0277-9536(98)00441-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in recent years, the division between the social and medical models has been challenged.&lt;ref name=MLA/&gt;&lt;ref name="anti-social"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dewsbury|first1=Guy|last2=Karen|first2=Clarke|last3=Randallb|first3=Dave|last4=Rouncefield|first4=Mark|last5=Sommerville|first5=Ian|title=The anti‐social model of disability|journal=Disability &amp; Society|date=Oct 2010|volume=19|issue=2|pages=145–158|doi=10.1080/0968759042000181776|citeseerx=10.1.1.140.9006}}&lt;!--|accessdate=26 March 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally there has been an increased focus on interdisciplinary research.&lt;ref name=SDSWhatIs&gt;{{cite web|title=what is disability studies?|url=https://www.disstudies.org/about/what_is_ds|website=Society for Disability Studies|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, recent investigations suggest using "cross-sectional markers of stratification"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Siordia | first1 = C | year = 2014 | title = Disability Prevalence According to a Class, Race, and Sex (CRS) Hypothesis | url = | journal = Journal of Racial &amp; Ethnic Health Disparities | volume =  2| issue = 3| pages =  303–310| doi = 10.1007/s40615-014-0073-8 | pmid = 26539340 | pmc = 4628829}}&lt;/ref&gt; may help provide new insights on the non-random distribution of risk factors capable of acerbating disablement processes.

Disability studies courses include work in disability history, theory, legislation, policy, ethics, and the arts. However, students are taught to focus on the lived experiences of individuals with disabilities in practical terms. The field is focused on increasing individuals with disabilities access to [[civil rights]] and improving their [[quality of life]].&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|last1=CAPUZZI SIMON|first1=CECILIA|title=Disability Studies: A New Normal|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/03/education/edlife/disability-studies-a-new-normal.html?_r=0|accessdate=26 March 2015|publisher=The New York Times|date=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disability studies emerged in the 1980s primarily in the US, the UK, and Canada. In 1986, the Section for the Study of Chronic Illness, Impairment, and Disability of the Social Science Association (United States) was renamed the [[Society for Disability Studies]].&lt;ref name=SDSMissionandHistory&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission and History|url=https://www.disstudies.org/about/mission-and-history|website=Society for Disability Studies|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first US disabilities studies program emerged in 1994, at [[Syracuse University]].&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; The first edition of the Disabilities Studies Reader (one of the first collections of academic papers related to disability studies) was published in 1997.&lt;ref name=Davis&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Davis|editor-first=Lennard J.|title=The disability studies reader|date=1997|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=9780415914703}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field grew rapidly over the next ten years. In 2005, the [[Modern Language Association]] established disability studies as a “division of study.” &lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

==History==
Universities have long studied disabilities from a clinical perspective.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; In 1986 the Section for the Study of Chronic Illness, Impairment, and Disability of Social Science Association was renamed the [[Society for Disability Studies]]&lt;ref name=SDSMissionandHistory/&gt; and its journal "[[Disability Studies Quarterly]]" was the first journal in disability studies. The first US disabilities studies program emerged in 1994, at [[Syracuse University]].&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; However, courses and programs were very few. In the 1997 first edition of the "Disability Studies Reader" Lennard J. Davis wrote that "it had been virtually impossible to have someone teaching about disability within the humanities".&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt; In the second edition, written ten years later, he writes that "all that has changed", but "just because disability studies is on the map, does not mean that is easy to find".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Davis|editor1-first=Lennard J.|title=The disability studies reader|date=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=9780415953337|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still the field continued to grow throughout the 2000s. In 2009 Disability Studies Quarterly published a A Multinational Review of English-language Disability Studies Degrees and Courses. They found that from 2003 to 2008 the number of disability studies stand alone studies courses in the US, UK, Australia, New Zealand and Canada grew from 56 to 108 and the number of degree granting courses grew from 212 to 420. A total of 17 degrees in disability studies were offered, with 11 programs in the US, 2 in the UK, 3 in Canada, and one in Australia.&lt;ref name=DSQ:ProgramReview&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Multinational Review Of English-Language Disability Studies Degrees And Courses|journal=Disability Studies Quarterly|date=2009|volume=29|issue=3|url=http://dsq-sds.org/issue/view/41|accessdate=26 March 2015|doi=10.18061/dsq.v29i3.940 | last1 = Cushing | first1 = Pamela | last2 = Smith | first2 = Tyler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 [[New York Times]] article "Disability Studies: A New Normal" suggests that the expansion in disability studies programs is related to the 1990 passage of the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] (ADA). Those raised after the passage of the ADA have entered colleges and the workforce, as Disability Studies has grown. In a 2014 article, Disability Studies Quarterly published an analysis on the relationships between student run groups and disability studies, from 2008 to 2012. Their article analyzes groups at four different universities and describes how professors have incorporated student activism into their curriculum and research.&lt;ref name=StudentGroups&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stout|first1=Allegra|last2=Schwartz|first2=Ariel|title="It'll Grow Organically and Naturally": The Reciprocal Relationship between Student Groups and Disability Studies on College Campuses|journal=Disability Studies Quarterly|date=2014|volume=34|issue=2|url=http://dsq-sds.org/article/view/4253/3593|accessdate=26 March 2015|doi=10.18061/dsq.v34i2.4253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
According to the transnational&lt;ref name=SDSAbout&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://disstudies.org/about|website=Society for Disability Studies|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Society for Disability Studies]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Using an interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary approach.  Disability sits at the intersection of many overlapping disciplines in the humanities, sciences, and social sciences.  Programs in Disability Studies should encourage a curriculum that allows students, activists, teachers, artists, practitioners, and researchers to engage the subject matter from various disciplinary perspectives.

*Challenging the view of disability as an individual deficit or defect that can be remedied solely through medical intervention or rehabilitation by "experts" and other service providers.  Rather, a program in Disability Studies should explore models and theories that examine social, political, cultural, and economic factors that define disability and help determine personal and collective responses to difference. At the same time, Disability Studies should work to de-stigmatize disease, illness, and impairment, including those that cannot be measured or explained by biological science.  Finally, while acknowledging that medical research and intervention can be useful, Disability Studies should interrogate the connections between medical practice and stigmatizing disability.
*Studying national and international perspectives, policies, literature, culture, and history with an aim of placing current ideas of disability within their broadest possible context.  Since attitudes toward disability have not been the same across times and places, much can be gained by learning from these other experiences.
*Encouraging participation by disabled students and faculty, and ensuring physical and intellectual access. Prioritizing leadership positions held by disabled people; at the same time, it is important to create an environment where contributions from anyone who shares the above goals are welcome."&lt;ref name=SDSWhatIs /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Disability studies and medical humanities==
The [[social model of disability]] is expanded to chronic illness and to the broader work of the [[medical humanities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Garden|first=R|title=Disability and narrative: new directions for medicine and the medical humanities|journal=Medical Humanities|date=December 2010|volume=36|issue=2|pages=70–4|pmid=21393285|doi=10.1136/jmh.2010.004143}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Practitioners are working towards improving the healthcare for disabled people through disability studies. This multi-disciplinary field of inquiry draws on the experiences and perspectives of people with disabilities to address discrimination. [[Infinite Ability]] has done some preliminary work in [[India]] to introduce disability studies to medical students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Singh|first=S|author2=Khosla, J |author3=Sridhar, S |title=Exploring medical humanities through theatre of the oppressed|journal=Indian Journal of Psychiatry|date=July 2012|volume=54|issue=3|pages=296–7|pmid=23226869|doi=10.4103/0019-5545.102461|pmc=3512382}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Khetarpal|first=A|author2=Singh, S|title=Infertility: Why can't we classify this inability as disability?|journal=The Australasian Medical Journal|year=2012|volume=5|issue=6|pages=334–9|pmid=22848333|doi=10.4066/AMJ.2012.1290|pmc=3395292}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Singh|first=S|title=Broadening horizons: looking beyond disability|journal=Medical Education|date=May 2012|volume=46|issue=5|page=522|pmid=22515781|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2923.2012.04246.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intersectionality==
[[Feminism]] introduces the inclusion of [[intersectionality]] in disability studies. It focuses on [[race (human categorization)|race]], [[gender]], [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], [[Class (social)|class]] and other related systems of [[oppression]] that can also intersect with having a disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gillborn|first=David|date=2015|title=Intersectionality, Critical Race Theory, and the Primacy of Racism: Race, Class, Gender, and Disability in Education.|journal=Qualitative Inquiry|language=en|volume=3|issue=3|pages=277–287|doi=10.1177/1077800414557827}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a feminism standpoint, there is a large concern for grasping multiple positions and differences among social groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Tina Goethals|first=|last2=Elisabeth De Schauwer|last3=Geert Van Hove|date=|year=2015|title=Weaving Intersectionality into Disability Studies Research: Inclusion, Reflexivity and Anti-Essentialism|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/10.11116/jdivegendstud.2.1-2.0075.pdf?refreqid=excelsior:000f48af9d031f8db8036895074aa270|journal=Digest.

===Race===
Recent scholarship has included studies that explore the intersection between disability and race.

Scholars of Feminist Disability Studies include [[Rosemarie Garland-Thomson]] and Alison Kafer. {{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} The 2009 publication of Fiona Kumari Campbell’s "Contours of Ableism: The Production of Disability and Abledness" signalled a new direction of research — studies in ableism, moving beyond preoccupations with disability to explore the maintenance of abledness in sexed, raced and modified bodies.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} Similarly, recent work has focused on the intersections of race and ethnicity with disability in the field of education studies and attempted to bridge Critical Race Studies with Dis/ability studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Annamma|first=Subini Ancy|date=18 November 2015|title=Dis/ability critical race studies (DisCrit): theorizing at theintersections of race and dis/ability|url=https://www.academia.edu/2258717|journal=Race Ethnicity and Education|volume=16|issue=1|pages=1–31|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work reflects an effort to deal with complex histories of marking racially "othered" bodies as physically, psychologically, or morally deficient, and traces this history of scientific racism to contemporary dynamics.

In addition to work by individual scholars, disability studies organizations have also begun to focus on disability and race and gender. The Society for Disability Studies created the Chris Bell Memorial Scholarship to honor Bell's commitment to diversity in disability studies.&lt;ref name="SDSBell"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.disstudies.org/awards/chris-bell|title=chris bell memorial scholarship|website=Society for Disability Studies|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402160435/https://www.disstudies.org/awards/chris-bell|archivedate=2 April 2015|deadurl=yes|accessdate=26 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postsecondary disability studies programs increasingly engage with the [[intersectionality]] of oppression.

===Feminism===
Feminism integrates the social and political aspects that makes a body oppressed while allowing empowerment to be present in acknowledging its culture. [[Rosemarie Garland-Thomson]] explains that these related systems of oppression pervades all aspects of culture by "its structuring institutions, social identities, cultural practices, political positions, historical communities, and the shared human experience of embodiment". Garland-Thomson further describes that "identity based critical enterprises have enriched and complicated our understandings of social justice, subject formation, subjugated knowledges and collective action".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Garland-Thomson, Rosemarie. "Integrating disability, transforming feminist theory." NWSA journal 14.3 (2002): 1-32|journal=|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminism works towards [[accessibility]] for everyone regardless of which societal oppressive behavior makes them a [[minority group|minority]]. Although physical adjustments are most commonly fought for in disability awareness, psychological exclusion also plays a major role oppressing people with disabilities. [[Sara Ahmed]] elaborates the mental exclusiveness of privilege in "Atmospheric Walls", that there is an atmosphere that surrounds minority bodies which explains why an intersectionally privileged person could be made uncomfortable simply by being in the same room as a person of color, or in this case someone with a disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Ahmed, Sara N. "Atmospheric Walls." Feministkilljoys. N.p., 2014. Web. 10 Oct. 2016|journal=|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminists and scholars also developed theories that put attention on the connection of gender and disability. Scholars like Thomas J. Gerschick argued that disability plays a big role on processing and experiencing gender, and people with disabilities often suffer stigmatization towards their gender, since their disabilities may make their body representation excluded by normative binary gender representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gerschick|first=Thomas J.|date=2000-07-01|title=Toward a Theory of Disability and Gender|journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|volume=25|issue=4|pages=1263–1268|doi=10.1086/495558|issn=0097-9740}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gerschick also argues that this stigmatization can affect the gendering process and self-representation of people with disabilities. Feminists also look into how people with disabilities are politically oppressed and powerless. Abby L. Wilkerson argues that people with disabilities are politically powerless because they are often desexualized, and the lack of sexual agency leads to the lack of political agency. Wilkerson also indicates that the erotophobia towards minority groups like people with disabilities further oppresses them, since it prevents these groups from gaining political power through sexual agency and power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilkerson|first=Abby|date=2002|title=Disability, Sex Radicalism, and Political Agency|jstor=4316923|journal=NWSA Journal|volume=14|issue=3|pages=33–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender and sexuality===
The intersectionality of disability and LGBTQ communities is a more modern subject of study in which the relevance, historically, came about mostly in the 1960s and the 1970s with the surge of advocates in the midst of the vocal liberation and civil rights movements.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} These communities on their own are topics of numerous deliberations, however they also often link in significance in many ways. The significance of the movements however, began to build momentum and most legal recognition in the 1980s. It was from this age of advocacy that the intersectionality of these two minority groups came into a more clear focus, though it is one continuously growing subject of discussion.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} It was only in 1973 that the [[American Psychiatric Association]] removed homosexuality from their list of mental disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Drescher|first=Jack|date=2015|title=Out of DSM: Depathologizing Homosexuality|journal=Behavioral Sciences|volume=5|issue=4|pages=565–575|pmc=4695779|pmid=26690228|doi=10.3390/bs5040565}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, it was about forty years later in 2013 that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition ([[DSM-5]]) changed the listing of transgender to “gender dysphoria”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|last=American Psychiatric Association|date=2013-05-22|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|isbn=978-0890425558|language=en|doi=10.1176/appi.books.9780890425596}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most notable circumstances where the case of these two minority rights come together was the court case ''[[In re Guardianship of Kowalski]]'', in which an accident that occurred in 1983 left a thirty-six year old Sharon Kowalski physically disabled with severe brain injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/07/us/gay-groups-are-rallied-to-aid-2-women-s-fight.html|title=Gay Groups Are Rallied To Aid 2 Women's Fight|last=Brozan|first=Nadine|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court granted guardianship of her to her homophobic parents who refused visitation rights to her long time partner, Karen Thompson. The court case lasted nearly ten years and was resolved by granting Thompson custody in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/18/us/disabled-woman-s-care-given-to-lesbian-partner.html|title=Disabled Woman's Care Given to Lesbian Partner|last=Lewin|first=Tamar|access-date=2018-10-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a major victory in the realm of gay rights but also called to attention the validity of rights for those who identified under the queer and disabled spectrum. Numerous support groups emerged from necessity to create safe spaces for those identifying in these specific minority groups such as the founding of the Rainbow Alliance of the Deaf in 1977,{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} the Lesbian Disabled Veterans of America group in 1996{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} which then became the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Disabled Veterans of America, and the San Francisco Gay Amputees group in 2006.

A 2012 study showed that disability was more common in gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals when compared to heterosexual peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fredriksen-Goldsen|first=Karen I.|last2=Kim|first2=Hyun-Jun|last3=Barkan|first3=Susan E.|date=2012|title=Disability Among Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Adults: Disparities in Prevalence and Risk|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3490559/|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=102|issue=1|pages=e16–e21|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2011.300379|issn=0090-0036|pmc=3490559|pmid=22095356|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also shown that the gay, lesbian, and bisexual group with disabilities were noticeably younger in age than the heterosexual group. There was a significant difference in the prevalence of mental and physical health between the study groups, a higher statistic of those with queer identities having issues health wise than those straight identifying, reportedly due to the weight of social pressure and discrimination of minority sexual identities.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Though these minority groups do not always intersect, the way they handle their own discrimination, can be compared in similar ways.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Being that both the LGBTQ rights movement and the disability rights movements have been defined as minority discrimination movements, it has been said{{by whom|date=May 2017}} that they are a direct contrast to society normalizing the dominance of heterosexuality and able-bodiedness in its majority population. It is also a large topic of discussion to say that both groups have to undergo the same kind of "coming out" process in terms of their sexual identity, gender identity, and disability identity because of the lasting social stigma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2015|title=Addressing Disability Stigma within the Lesbian Community|url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/43888838/Lesbian___Disability.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1539886805&amp;Signature=JzL0VYPNkGAJAKigLgay9NP0i%2F0%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DAddressing_Disability_Stigma_within_the.pdf|journal=Journal of Rehabilitation|volume=81|pages=49–56|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Coming out" through sexual identity, gender identity, and disability identity is one example of "Double Jeopardy", as they are part of more than one stigmatized group.

[[Queer studies]] which emerged from [[women's studies]], brings light towards the different kind of oppression [[queer]] and [[transgender]] people with disabilities have. For example, the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|Americans with Disabilities Act]] dismisses [[gender disphoria]] because of its moral case against transgender people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barry |first=Kevin M. |title=Disabilityqueer: Federal Disability Rights Protection for Transgender People |date=February 18, 2014 |journal=Yale Human Rights and Development Law Journal |volume=16 |issue=1 |page=1 |url=https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/yhrdlj/vol16/iss1/1/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Queer studies are commonly associated with people with disabilities who identify as “Crip” and is commonly believed that queer politics must incorporate crip politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=McRuer |first=Robert |title=Cripping Queer Politics, or the Dangers of Neoliberalism |website=S&amp;F Online |url=http://sfonline.barnard.edu/a-new-queer-agenda/cripping-queer-politics-or-the-dangers-of-neoliberalism/ |issue=10.1–10.2 |date=Fall 2011 – Spring 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alison Kafer describes a first person experience of identifying queer and crip both bold reappropriated terms in Kafer's novel, "Feminist Queer Crip". Kafer describes the politics of the crip future and "an insistence on thinking these imagined futures - and hence, these lived presents - differently".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kafer|first1=Alison|title=Feminist, queer, crip|date=2013|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|isbn=9780253009227}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although many activists with disabilities find empowerment in appropriating the term crip, not all people with disabilities feel comfortable using that identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=V3GPb2obU0gC&amp;pg=PR5&amp;dq=Crip+Theory:+Cultural+Signs+of+Queerness+and+Disability#v=onepage&amp;q=Crip%20Theory:%20Cultural%20Signs%20of%20Queerness%20and%20Disability&amp;f=false|title=Crip Theory: Cultural Signs of Queerness and Disability|last=McRuer|first=Robert|date=2006-06-01|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=9780814761090|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many different terms used as an alternative to disability, for example Melwood, a nonprofit who uses the term "differing abilities", describes the label disability as  "a limitation in the ability to pursue an occupation because of a physical or mental impairment; a disqualification, restriction or disadvantage and a lack of legal qualification to do something, was an inadequate or limiting 'label' for a cross section of people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Disabilities" vs. "Differing Abilities" |url=https://www.melwood.org/disabilities-vs-differing-abilities|website=Melwood|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the term disability has a history of inferiority, it is believed by many that substituting the term will help eliminate the [[ableism]] that is embedded within it. Susan Wendell describes ableism in society "as a structure for people who have no weakness",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wendell |first=Susan |title=Toward a Feminist Theory of Disability |journal=Hypatia |volume=4 |number=2 |year=1989 |pages=104–124 |jstor=3809809 |doi=10.1111/j.1527-2001.1989.tb00576.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; this also applies to anyone who has any intersectional disadvantages. Feminism identifies these disadvantages and strategizes how to deconstruct the system that supports marginalizing specific groups of people.

=== Social class ===
Within class comes multiple avenues for intersectionality through disability. Disability looks different from a middle class, upper class, and lower class perspective, as well as through race, gender, and ethnicity. One's social class can contribute to when a person becomes disabled, rather it be sooner or later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=F4X6yaiCNOcC&amp;pg=PP2&amp;dq=Feminist,+Queer,+Crip#v=onepage&amp;q=Feminist,%20Queer,%20Crip&amp;f=false|title=Feminist, Queer, Crip|last=Kafer|first=Alison|date=2013-05-16|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0253009418|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, where there is poverty we will find disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2zYEDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=Disability+Studies:+An+Interdisciplinary+Introduction#v=onepage&amp;q=Disability%20Studies:%20An%20Interdisciplinary%20Introduction&amp;f=false|title=Disability Studies: An Interdisciplinary Introduction|last=Goodley|first=Dan|date=2016-11-03|publisher=SAGE|isbn=9781473986930|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This poverty can include social, economic, and cultural poverty. Having a disability can contribute to poverty just as poverty can contribute to having a disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Poverty and Disability: A Survey of the Literature|last=Elwan|first=Ann|publisher=|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with disabilities are more likely to live in poverty and be unemployed than those who do not, resulting in lower socioeconomic status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.apa.org/pi/ses/resources/publications/disability.aspx|title=Disability &amp; Socioeconomic Status|last=|first=|date=|website=apa.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

===Questioning the social model===
The International Association of Accessibility Professionals &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Certified Professional in Accessibility Core Competencies|url=http://www.accessibilityassociation.org/certificationprofoutline|website=International Association of Accessibility Professionals|accessdate=23 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; recognizes six different models for conceptualizing disability: social, medical, cultural affiliation, economic, charity, and functional solutions. Once universally accepted in the field, the '''social''' model of disability &lt;ref name=Models1999 /&gt; has recently{{When|date=January 2018}} been challenged.&lt;ref name="anti-social" /&gt; In a 2014 ''Disability Studies Quarterly'' article, students involved in campus disability groups note that they actively seek cures for their chronic illnesses and "question the rejection of the '''medical''' model" of disability.&lt;ref name=StudentGroups/&gt; The '''cultural affiliation''' model accepts the person's disability completely and uses it a point of pride in being associated with other people in a similar condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shapiro|first1=J|title=No Pity: People with Disabilities Forging a New Civil Rights Movement|date=1994|publisher=Broadway Books.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The '''economic''' model recognizes the effect of bodily limitations on a person's ability to work, and there may be a need for economic support or accommodations for the person's disability &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Strnadová|first1=I|last2=Cumming,|first2=Therese|title=Lifespan transitions and disability : A holistic perspective|date=2015|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the '''charity''' model regards people with disabilities as unfortunate and in need of assistance from the outside, with those providing charity viewed as benevolent contributors to a needy population.  The '''functional solutions''' model of disability is a practical perspective that identifies the limitations (or "functional impairments") due to disability, with the intent to create and promote solutions to overcome those limitations. The primary task is to eliminate, or at least reduce, the impact of the functional limitations of the body through technological or methodological innovation. The pragmatism of the functional solution model deemphasizes the sociopolitical aspects of disability, and instead prioritizes inventiveness and entrepreneurship. This is the prevailing opinion behind compliance literature that promotes self-efficacy and self-advocacy skills for people with disabilities preparing for transition to independent living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/transitionguide.html |title=Transition of Students With Disabilities To Postsecondary Education: A Guide for High School Educators |publisher=.ed.gov |date= 2018-09-25|accessdate=2016-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exclusion of cognitive and mental disabilities===
There is discourse within disability studies to analyze the construction of ''mental illness.'' However, few post-structuralist disability scholars have focused their attention to impairments of the mind.&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=Carol|title=Sociologies of disability and illness : contested ideas in disability studies and medical sociology|date=2007|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=978-1403936363|page=131|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Carol Thomas, the Reader in Sociology at the Institute for Health Research, [[Lancaster University]], this may be because disability scholars have in the past considered only the barriers confronted by people with physical disabilities.  The experience of impairment, cognitive disability, and mental illness had been absent from the discussion.

It is unclear exactly which perspective of disability scholarship “psychological impairment” can fall under, and this has led to a hesitation on the part of scholars.&lt;ref name="Thomas" /&gt;  Scholars such as [[Peter Beresford]] (2002) suggest "the development of a 'social model of madness and distress'" which would consider impairments of the mind.&lt;ref name="Thomas" /&gt; Yet others may recommend the "embodied approach," to the study of mental illnesses.&lt;ref name="Thomas" /&gt;

      <comment>/* Types of exposure */ move removed image to more appropriate section... As much as I hate to say it, this article could probably use an extra image or two, for illustration. Not everything is potentially clear to someone unfamiliar with the practices. Of course, that's not me. I know ALL ABOUT exposing myself in pub-okay, I'll shut up now.</comment>

'''Exhibitionism''' is the act of exposing in a public or semi-public context those parts of one's body that are not normally exposed &amp;ndash; for example, the [[breast]]s, [[Sex organ|genitals]] or [[buttocks]]. The practice may arise from a desire or compulsion to expose themselves in such a manner to groups of friends or acquaintances, or to strangers for their amusement or sexual satisfaction or to shock the bystander.&lt;ref name="baunach"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baunach|first1=Dawn Michelle|title=Sex and Society|date=2010|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7614-7906-2|page=220|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aVDZchwkIMEC&amp;lpg=PA220|accessdate=22 May 2017|chapter=Exhibitionism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exposing oneself only to an [[intimate partner]] is normally not regarded as exhibitionism. In law, the act of exhibitionism may be called [[indecent exposure]], "exposing one's person", or other expressions.

==History==

Public exhibitionism by women has been recorded since classical times, often in the context of women shaming groups of men into committing, or inciting them to commit, some public action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rutgerspress.rutgers.edu/Author/Blackledge/excerpt.html |title=Origin of the world |publisher=Rutgerspress.rutgers.edu |date=1977-09-23 |accessdate=2012-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120094326/http://rutgerspress.rutgers.edu/Author/Blackledge/excerpt.html |archivedate=2012-11-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Greek historian [[Herodotus]] gives an account of exhibitionistic behaviors from the fifth century BC in ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]''. Herodotus writes that: &lt;blockquote&gt;When people travel to [[Bubastis]] for the festival, this is what they do. Every ''baris'' carrying them there overflows with people, a huge crowd of them, men and women together. Some of the women have clappers, while some of the men have pipes which they play throughout the voyage. The rest of the men and women sing and clap their hands. When in the course of their journey they reach a community — not the city of their destination, but somewhere else — they steer the ''bareis'' close to the bank. Some of the women carry on doing what I have already described them as doing, but others shout out scornful remarks to the women in the town, or dance, or stand and pull up their clothes to expose themselves. Every riverside community receives this treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus. ''The Histories''. Trans. R. Waterfield. Oxford: Oxford UP, 1998. Book Two, Chapter 60, Page 119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A case of what appears to be exhibitionism in a clinical sense was recorded in a report by the Commission against Blasphemy in Venice in 1550.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bloch|first=Iwan|title=Fall von Exhibitionismus im 16. Jahrhundert|journal=Zeitschrift für Sexualwissenschaft|year=1914|issue=Born|page=i.289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK the 4th draft of the revised Vagrancy Act of 1824 included an additional clause 'or openly and indecently exposing their persons' which gave rise to difficulties because of its ill-defined scope. During the course of a subsequent debate on the topic in Parliament, the then Home Secretary, Mr Peel, observed that 'there was not a more flagrant offence than that of indecently exposing the person which had been carried to an immense extent in the parks...wanton exposure was a very different thing from accidental exposure'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rooth|first=F.G.|title=Some Historical Notes on Indecent Exposure and Exhibitionism|journal=The Medico-Legal Journal|year=1970|volume=38|issue=4|series=Part 4|pages=135–139|pmid=4923872}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The development of new technologies such as smartphones and tablets has permitted some exhibitionists to reorient their methods such as with nude selfies.&lt;ref&gt;Hart, Matt. "Being naked on the internet: young people’s selfies as intimate edgework." Journal of Youth Studies (2016): 1-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological aspects==
[[File:Charles Lasegue.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Charles Lasègue]] was the first to describe exhibitionism as a disorder in 1877.]]
Exhibitionism was first described as a disorder in 1877 by French physician and psychiatrist [[Charles Lasègue]].&lt;ref&gt;Lasègue C. Les Exhibitionistes. L'Union Médicale (Paris), series 3, vol. 23; 1877. Pages 709–714.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn | Aggrawal | 2009 | p=388 }} When exhibitionistic sexual interest is acted on with a non-consenting person or interferes with a person's quality of life or [[normality (behavior)|normal]] functioning, it can be diagnosed as ''exhibitionistic disorder'' in the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'', fifth edition ([[DSM-5]]). The DSM states that the highest possible prevalence for exhibitionistic disorder in men is 2% to 4%. It is thought to be much less common in women.&lt;ref name="DSM-5"&gt;{{cite book | title = Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition | chapter = Exhibitionistic Disorder, 302.4 (F65.2) | editor = American Psychiatric Association | year = 2013 | publisher = American Psychiatric Publishing | pages = 689–691}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a Swedish survey, 2.1% of women and 4.1% of men admitted to becoming sexually aroused from the exposure of their genitals to a stranger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Nolen-Hoeksema, Susan | year = 2014 | title = Abnormal Psychology | edition = 6th | location = New York City, NY | publisher = McGraw-Hill Education | page = 384}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A research team asked a sample of 185 exhibitionists, "How would you have preferred a person to react if you were to expose your privates to him or her?" The most common response was "Would want to have sexual intercourse" (35.1%), followed by "No reaction necessary at all" (19.5%), "To show their privates also" (15.1%), "Admiration" (14.1%), and "Any reaction" (11.9%). Only very few exhibitionists chose "Anger and disgust" (3.8%) or "Fear" (0.5%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Freund, K. |author2=Watson, R. |author3= Rienzo, D. |last-author-amp=yes | year = 1988 | title = The value of self-reports in the study of voyeurism and exhibitionism | journal = Annals of Sex Research | volume = 2 | pages = 243–262 | url = http://sax.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/1/2/243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of exposure==
[[File:Mardi Gras Flashing - Color.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A woman publicly exposing her bare breasts at [[Mardi Gras]], USA, 2008]]
Various types of behavior are classified as exhibitionism,&lt;ref name="baunach"/&gt; including:
*'''[[Anasyrma]]''': the lifting of the [[skirt]] when not wearing [[underwear]], to expose genitals.
*'''[[Candaulism]]''': when a person exposes his or her partner in a sexually provocative manner.
*'''Flashing''': the momentary display of bare female [[breasts]] by a woman with an up-and-down lifting of the shirt or [[bra]] or the exposure of a man's or woman's [[genitalia]].

[[File:Mooning.jpg|thumb|250px|Students mooning at [[Stanford University]], intended as both an unspecified protest and also a [[world record]] attempt of most number of people simultaneously mooning others.]]

*'''Martymachlia''': a [[paraphilia]] which involves [[sexual attraction]] to having others watch the execution of a sexual act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologistanywhereanytime.com/sexual_problems_pyschologist/psychologist_exhibitionism.htm |title=Psychologist Anywhere Anytime |publisher=Psychologist Anywhere Anytime |date= |accessdate=2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Mooning]]''': the display of bare [[buttocks]] by pulling down of [[trousers]] and underwear. The act is most often done for the sake of humour, disparagement, or mockery.
*'''Reflectoporn''': the act of stripping and taking a photograph using an object with a reflective surface as a mirror, then posting the image on the Internet in a public forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Reflectoporn' Hits Auction Site|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/latest/content_objectid=13386628_method=full_siteid=50143_headline=-Get-your-bids-out-name_page.html|publisher=[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]]|date=2003-09-09|accessdate=2007-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include "images of naked men and women reflected in kettles, TVs, toasters and even knives and forks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Today's media stories from the papers|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/sep/09/1|publisher=The Guardian|date=2003-09-09|accessdate=2007-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The instance generally credited with starting the trend involved a man selling a [[kettle]] on an Australian auction site featuring a photograph where his naked body is clearly visible;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/photos/risque/kettle.asp |title=Urban Legends Reference Pages: Indecent Exposure |publisher=Snopes.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; other instances followed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nude eBayer flashes 19in monitor|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/07/01/ebay_monitor_flash/|publisher=The Register|date=2005-07-01|accessdate=2007-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=eBayer goes for bust in ashtray auction|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/06/19/ashtray_offer/|publisher=The Register|date=2006-06-19|accessdate=2007-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=eBay in wing-mirror reflectoporn shocker|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/07/14/ebay_wing_mirror/|publisher=The Register|date=2006-07-14|accessdate=2007-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the specific term "reflectoporn" was coined by Chris Stevens of [[Internet Magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1490886 |title=Reflectoporn@Everything2.com |publisher=Everything2.com |date=2003-09-10 |accessdate=2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Streaking]]''': the act of running naked through a public place. The intent is not usually sexual but for shock value.
*'''[[Telephone scatologia]]''': the act of making obscene phone calls to random or known recipients. Some researchers have claimed that this is a variant of exhibitionism, even though it has no in-person physical component.&lt;ref&gt;Hirschfeld, M. (1938). ''Sexual anomalies and perversions: Physical and psychological development, diagnosis and treatment'' (new and revised ed.). London: Encyclopaedic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nadler, R. P. (1968). Approach to psychodynamics of obscene telephone calls. ''New York State Journal of Medicine, 68,'' 521–526.&lt;/ref&gt;

The DSM-5 diagnosis for exhibitionistic disorder has three subtypes: exhibitionists interested in exposing themselves to adults, to prepubescent children, or to both.&lt;ref name="DSM-5" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8602">'''Formative contexts''' are the institutional and imaginative arrangements that shape a society's conflicts and resolutions.&lt;ref&gt;Trubek, David M. 1990. "Programmatic Thought and the Critique of the Social Disciplines." In Critique and Construction, ed. M Perry. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt; They are the [[Social structure|structures]] that limit both the practice and the imaginative possibilities in a socio-political order, and in doing so shape the routines of conflict over social, political and economic resources that govern access to labor, loyalty, and social station, e.g. government power, economic capital, technological expertise, etc. In a formative context, the institutions structure conflict over government power and capital allocation, whereas the imaginative framework shapes the preconceptions about possible forms of human interaction. Through this, a formative context further creates and sustains a set of roles and ranks, which mold conflict over the mastery of resources and the shaping of the ideas of social possibilities, identities and interests. The formative context of the [[liberal democracy|Western democracies]], for example, include the organization of production through managers and laborers, a set of laws administering capital, a state in relation to the citizen, and a social division of labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=False Necessity|year=2001|publisher=Verso|location=New York|pages=58–59, 69–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Also referred to as order, framework, or structure of social life, the concept of formative context was developed by philosopher and social theorist [[Roberto Unger]]. Whereas other social and political philosophers have taken the historical context as a given, and seen one existing set of institutional arrangements as necessarily giving birth to another set, Unger rejects this naturalization of the world and moves to explain how such contexts are made and reproduced. The most forceful articulation and development of the concept is in Unger's book ''False Necessity.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=False Necessity|year=2001|publisher=Verso|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The thesis of formative context is central to Unger's theory of [[false necessity]], which rejects the idea of a closed number of institutional arrangements of human societies, e.g. feudalism and capitalism, and that these arrangements are the product of historical necessity, as theories of [[liberalism]] or [[Marxism]] claim. Rather, Unger argues that there are myriad institutional arrangements that can coalesce, and that they do so through a contingent process of struggle, reconciliation, and innovation among individuals and groups. For Unger, the concept of formative context serves to explain the basis of a certain set of institutional arrangements and their reliance upon each other. It offers an explanation of the cycles of reform and retrenchment of a socio-economic political system and how it remains undisturbed by rivalries and animosities. The theory of false necessity goes on to explain the connections of a formative context, their making and remaking, and how they maintain stability despite the contingent formation.&lt;ref&gt;For good overviews of Unger's thought see Collins, Hugh. “Roberto Unger and the Critical Legal Studies Movement,” Journal of Law and Society 14 (1987), Trubek, David M. "Radical Theory and Programmatic Thought." ''American Journal of Sociology'' 95, no. 2 (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criteria==
While a formative context of a society exerts a major influence on the course of [[social actions]] and behaviors, it is itself hard to challenge, revise, or even identify in the midst of everyday conflicts and routines. Thus there are two criteria for determining if an institution or structure belongs in a formative context, one subjective and one objective. The '''subjective criteria''' considers the perspective of the social actors themselves and the arrangements that are assumed in their speech and actions. For example, the attempts of big business and labor to protect themselves through deals with each other, and the political efforts of unorganized labor and petty bourgeoisie to undermine and circumvent these deals by pressuring the government, operate on the same institutional assumption of the distinction between economy and polity, and that victory in one can be offset by the other. The '''objective criteria''' is simply that if a substitution of the proposed structure affects the hierarchies or cyclical conflicts—if it alters the social divisions—then it can be included in the formative context. For example, a change in any one of the following conditions would completely change the formative context of a Western democratic state: if the state stopped being democratic or was democratic enough to allow collective militancy and subject private centers of power to public accountability; if business could have its way and override all regulatory controls of govt; or if no workers could unionize or all of them could and did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Unger | first = Roberto | title = Social Theory, Its Situation and Its Task | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge | year = 1987 | page=63| isbn = 978-0-521-32974-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Unger | first = Roberto | title = False Necessity: Anti-Necessitarian Social Theory in the Service of Radical Democracy, Revised Edition | publisher = Verso | location = London | year = 2004 |pages=61–66| isbn = 978-1-85984-331-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Western democracies==
The formative context of the North Atlantic democracies can be organized into four clusters of institutional arrangements: work, law, government, and occupational structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Unger | first = Roberto | title = False Necessity: Anti-Necessitarian Social Theory in the Service of Radical Democracy, Revised Edition | publisher = Verso | location = London | year = 2004 |pages=69–82| isbn = 978-1-85984-331-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The '''work-organization complex''' makes a distinction in work between task definers and task executers, with the material rewards concentrated in the task defining jobs.
*The '''private-rights complex''' understands the rights of the individual vis-a-vis other individuals and the state. This structure is central to the allocation and control of capital, ensuring all forms of capital distribution and entitlement.
*The '''government-organization complex''' is the institutional arrangement to protect the individual from the state, and to prevent those in power from changing the formative context. It establishes a link between safeguards of freedom and the dispersion of powers, e.g. partisan rivalries fail to extend to debates over the fundamental institutions that affect social interactions.
*The '''occupational-structure complex''' is a social division of labor characterized by a lack of caste or religious division. It is based on material reward and task defining jobs receiving the highest pay.

==Influences in other fields==
The thesis of formative contexts has been heavily drawn on and used within the [[Social Study of Information Systems]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} In the field of [[Information systems]] [[Claudio Ciborra]] and Giovan Lanzara define the term "formative context" as the "set of institutional arrangements and cognitive imageries that inform actors' practical and reasoning routines in organisations". They posit that the common inability to inquire into, challenge or shape formative context can inhibit individuals and organizations from acting competently and learning what they need to know in order to make the most of situations and technological transitions as the enchaining effect of Formative Context can lead to cognitive and social inertia.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

The '''Goa Konkani Akademi''' (Goa Academy of Letters for Konkani) is an organization set up by the [[Government of Goa]] in 1986 to promote [[Konkani language|Konkani]] in [[Goa]]. Its stated aim is to accelerate the pace of development of Konkani by encouraging writers, researchers, etc. and to bring [[Konkani people|Konkanis]] from all areas together.&lt;ref name="gka_webs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goakonkaniakademi.org/message.htm|title=Goa Konkani Akademi|accessdate=2009-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature==
The Goa Konkani Akademi was founded on 4 March 1986.&lt;ref name="gaionam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.songs-from-goa.at/goa/docs/essay.htm#_ftnref27 |title=GOENCHIM KONKNNI GAIONAM |last=de Noronha |first=Lourenço |accessdate=2009-06-03 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an autonomous body and has jurisdiction over the state of Goa.&lt;ref name="gka_ct_chart"/&gt; It undertakes activities for the development and promotion of Konkani. GKA receives grants from the Government of Goa.&lt;ref name="legis_goa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goavidhansabha.gov.in/uploads/docs/465_ff_FIRST%20HOME.pdf |title=FIFTH LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF GOA |accessdate=2009-06-03 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current Akademi President is [[Pundalik Naik]] (2002- present). Past presidents were [[Purushottam Kakodkar]] (1984-1996) and [[Uday Bhembre]] (1996-2002) respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goakonkaniakademi.org/committees/officebearers.htm |title=Officers Of Goa Konkani Akademi |accessdate=2009-06-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223190600/http://goakonkaniakademi.org/committees/officebearers.htm |archivedate=23 February 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The GKA has been accused of being biased against Konkani publications in the [[Konkani in the Roman script|Roman script]] in the past. Another demand has been that the GKA should be headed by persons of both the major communities in Goa([[Hindus]] and [[Christians]]) by rotation.&lt;ref name="Konkaniworld"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.konkaniworld.com/news/indexMore.asp?ID=892&amp;title=Script+for+Konkani |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713165258/http://www.konkaniworld.com/news/indexMore.asp?ID=892&amp;title=Script+for+Konkani |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-07-13 |title=Konkaniworld - Script for Konkani |last=Lopes |first=Nelson |accessdate=2009-06-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fredrick Noronha]] has criticized the way the GKA distributes books. He blames the "low-price, no-distributor-margins policy" as being responsible for the lack of interest by distributors, and hence low readership of its books.&lt;ref name="Fredrick_Noronha"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fredericknoronha.wordpress.com/2007/10/22/learn-konkani-the-romi-way/|title=Learn Konkani, the Romi way|last=Noronha|first=Frederick|accessdate=2009-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gothic architecture''' is a [[architectural style|style]] that flourished in [[Europe]] during the [[High Middle Ages|High]] and [[Late Middle Ages|Late]] [[Middle Ages]]. It evolved from [[Romanesque architecture]] and was succeeded by [[Renaissance architecture]]. Originating in 12th-century [[France]], it was widely used, especially for cathedrals and churches, until the 16th century.

Its most prominent features included the use of the [[rib vault]] and the [[flying buttress]], which allowed the weight of the roof to be counterbalanced by buttresses outside the building, giving greater height and more space for windows.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|p=46}} Another important feature was the extensive use of stained glass, and the [[rose window]], to bring light and color to the interior. Another feature was the use of realistic statuary on the exterior, particularly over the portals, to illustrate biblical stories for the largely illiterate parishioners. These technologies had all existed in [[Romanesque architecture]], but they were used in more innovative ways and more extensively in Gothic architecture to make buildings taller, lighter and stronger.

The first notable example is generally considered to be the [[Abbey of Saint-Denis]], near Paris, whose choir and facade were reconstructed with Gothic features. The choir was completed in 1144. The style also appeared in some civic architecture in northern Europe, notably in town halls and university buildings. A [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic revival]] began in mid-18th-century England, spread through 19th century Europe and continued, largely for ecclesiastical and university structures, into the 20th century.

==Name==
Gothic architecture was known during the period as {{lang|la|opus francigenum}} ("French/[[Franks|Frankish]] work"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Colin|title=The Cambridge Illustrated History of France|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EVNGNIojGgMC&amp;pg=PA90|date=28 May 1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-66992-4|page=90|quote=The style was widely referred to as {{lang|la|opus francigenum}} - "[[Franks]]' work".}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "Gothic architecture" originated in the 16th century, and was originally very negative, suggesting barbaric. [[Giorgio Vasari]] used the term "barbarous German style" in his 1550 ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects|Lives of the Artists]]'' to describe what is now considered the Gothic style,{{sfn|Vasari|1991|pp=117, 527}} and in the introduction to the ''Lives'' he attributed various architectural features to "[[Goths|the Goths]]" whom he held responsible for destroying the ancient buildings after they conquered [[Rome]], and erecting new ones in this style.{{sfn|Vasari|Brown|Maclehose|1907|p=83}}

==History==
===Origins – Early Gothic (1130–1200)===

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The Gothic style originated in the [[Ile-de-France]] region of northern France in the first half of the 12th century. A new dynasty of French Kings, the [[Capetians]], had subdued the feudal lords, and had become the most powerful rulers in France, with their capital in Paris. They allied themselves with the bishops of the major cities of northern France, and reduced the power of the feudal abbots and monasteries. Their rise coincided with an enormous growth of the population and prosperity of the cities of northern France. The Capetian Kings and their bishops wished to build new cathedrals as monuments of their power, wealth, and religious faith.{{sfn|Raeburn|1980|p=102}}

The church which served as the primary model for the style was the [[Abbey of St-Denis]], which underwent reconstruction by the Abbot [[Suger]], first in the choir and then the facade (1140–44), Suger was a close ally and biographer of the French King, [[Louis VII of France|Louis VII]], who was a fervent Catholic and builder, and the founder of the [[University of Paris]]. Suger remodeled the ambulatory of the Abbey, removed the enclosures that separated the chapels, and replaced the existing structure with imposing pillars and [[rib vault]]s. This created created higher and wider bays, into which he installed larger windows, which filled the end of the church with light. Soon afterwards he rebuilt the facade, adding three deep portals, each with a [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]], an arch filled with sculpture illustrating biblical stories. The new facade was flanked by two towers. He also installed a small circular [[rose window]] over the central portal. This design became the prototype for a series of new French cathedrals.{{Sfn|Martindale|1993|pages=17–18}}

[[Sens Cathedral]] (begun between 1135 and 1140) was the first Cathedral to be built in the new style (St. Denis was an abbey, not a Cathedral). Other versions of the new style soon appeared in [[Noyon Cathedral]] (begun 1150); [[Laon Cathedral]] (begun 1165); and the most famous of all, [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], where construction had begun in 1160.{{Sfn|Martindale|1993|pages=20–22}}

The Gothic style was also adapted by some French monastic orders, notably the [[Cistercian]] order under [[Saint Bernard of Clairvaux]] It was used in an austere form without ornament at the new Cistercian [[Abbey of Fontenay]] (1139–1147) and the church of [[Clairvaux Abbey]], whose site is now occupied by a French prison.{{sfn|Martindale|1993|pages=24–26}}

The new style was also copied outside the Kingdom of France in the [[Duchy of Normandy]]. Early examples of Norman Gothic included [[Coutances Cathedral]] (1210–1274); [[Bayeux Cathedral]] (rebuilt from Romanesque style in 12th century), [[Le Mans Cathedral]] (rebuilt from Romanesque 12th century) and [[Rouen Cathedral]]. Through the rule of the [[House of Plantagenet|Angevin dynasty]], the new style was introduced to [[England]] and spread from there to [[Low Countries]], [[Germany]], [[Spain]], northern [[Italy]] and [[Sicily]].{{sfn|Ducher|1988|page=46}}{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=36}} The Gothic style did not immediately replace the Romanesque everywhere in Europe.{{sfn|Raeburn|1980|p=102}} The Late Romanesque continued to flourish in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] under the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufens]] and [[Rhineland]].

===High Gothic (1200–1270)===

&lt;/gallery&gt;
From the end of the 12th century until the middle of the 13th century, the gothic style spread from the Île-de-France to appear in other cities of northern France. New structures in the style included [[Chartres Cathedral]] (begun 1200); [[Bourges Cathedral]] (1195 to 1230), [[Reims Cathedral]] (1211–1275), and [[Amiens Cathedral]] (begun 1250);{{sfn|Ducher|1988|p=48}} At Chartres, the use of the flying buttresses allowed the elimination of the tribune level, which allowed much higher arcades and nave, and larger windows. The early type of [[rib vault]] used of Saint Denis and Notre Dame, with six parts, was modified to four parts, making it simpler and stronger. Amiens and Chartres were among the first to use the [[flying buttress]]; the buttresses were strengthened by an additional arch and with a supporting arcade, allowing even higher and walls and more windows. At Reims, the buttresses were given greater weight and strength by the addition of heavy stone pinnacles on top. These were often decorated with statues of angels, and became an important decorative element of the High Gothic style. Another practical and decorative element, the gargoyle, appeared; it was an ornamental rain spout which channeled the water from the roof away from the building. At Amiens, the windows of the nave were made larger, and an additional row of clear glass windows (the claire-voie) flooded the interior with light. The new structural technologies allowed the enlargement of the transepts and of the choirs at the east end of the cathedrals, creating the space for a ring of well-lit chapels. The transept of Notre-Dame was rebuilt with the new technology, and two spectacular rose windows added.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|p=48}}

===Rayonnant Gothic (1250–1370s)===
&lt;gallery mode="packed" heights="200"&gt;

File:Rose du transept Sud Notre-Dame de Paris 170208 04.jpg|Exterior of south rose window of [[Notre Dame Cathedral]] (about 1250)
&lt;/gallery&gt;
The next period was termed ''[[Rayonnant]]'' ("Radiant"), describing the tendency toward the use of more and more stained glass and less masonry in the design of the structure, until the walls seemed entirely made of glass. The most celebrated example was the chapel of [[Sainte-Chapelle]], the chapel attached to the royal residence on the [[Palais de la Cité]]. An elaborate system of exterior columns and arches reduced the walls of the upper chapel to a thin framework for the enormous windows. The weight of each of the masonry gables above the [[archivolt]] of the windows also helped the walls to resist the thrust and to distribute the weight.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|p=58}}

Another landmark of the Rayonnant Gothic are the two rose windows on the north and south of the transept of [[Notre Dame Cathedral]]. Whereas earlier rose windows, like those of [[Amiens Cathedral]], were framed by stone and occupied only a portion of the wall, these two windows, with a delicate lace-like framework, occupied the entire space between the pillars.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|p=58}}

===Flamboyant Gothic (1350–1550)===

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The [[Flamboyant]] Gothic style appeared in the second half of the 14th century. Its characteristic features were more exuberant decoration, as the nobles and wealthy citizens of mostly northern French cities competed to build more and more elaborate churches and cathedrals. It took its name from the sinuous, flame-like designs which ornamented windows. Other new features included the ''arc en accolade'', a window decorated with an arch, stone pinnacles and floral sculpture. It also featured an increase in the number of ''nervures'', or ribs, that supported and decorated each vault of the ceiling, both for greater support and decorative effect. Notable examples of Flamboyant Gothic include the western facade of [[Rouen Cathedral]] and [[Sainte-Chapelle de Vincennes]] in Paris, both built in the 1370s; and the Choir of [[Mont Saint Michel Abbey]] (1448 c.).{{sfn|Renault|Lazé|2006|p=37}} Subsequently, the style spread to Northern Europe. Notable example of Flamboyant Gothic in the Baltic region includes the [[Brick Gothic]] [[Church of St. Anne, Vilnius|Church of St. Anne]] in [[Vilnius]] (1490s).

File:Coupe.nef.eglise.Saint.Denis.png|Cross section of the nave wall and buttresses of the [[Basilica of Saint Denis]], by [[Eugene Viollet-le-Duc]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;
The plan of the Gothic cathedral was based on the model of the ancient Roman [[basilica]], which was a combined public market and courthouse; which was also the basis of the plan of the Romanesque cathedral. The cathedral is in the form of a Latin cross. The entrance is traditionally on the west end, has three portals decorated with sculpture, usually a rose window, and is flanked by two towers. The long nave, where the congregation worshiped, occupies the west end. This is usually divided from the nave by rows of pillars, which support the roof, flanked by one or two aisles, called ''collaérals''. There are usually small chapels on the two sides, placed between the buttresses, which provide additional support to the walls.

The cathedral usually has a [[transept]], a crossing, roughly in the middle, which sometimes projects outwards some distance, and in other cases, such as Notre-Dame, is minimal. The ''croisée'' or crossing of the transept, is the center of the church, and is surrounded by particularly massive pillars, which sometimes support a lantern tower, which brings light into the center of the cathedral. The north and south facades of the transept often feature rose windows, as at [[Notre Dame de Paris]].

To the east of the transept is the [[Choir (architecture)|choir]], where the altar is located, where ceremonies take place, and where only the clergy was allowed. This space grew greatly in the 12th century, as ceremonies became more elaborate. Behind the choir is single or double a walkway called the [[ambulatory]]. At the eastern end of the church is the [[apse]] usually in the form of a half-circle, and the chevet. There is usually a chapel here dedicated to the Virgin Mary, which can be very large. Around chevet there are usually several other smaller chapels.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=18–19}}

The earlier Gothic cathedrals had four levels, from the floor to the roof. On the ground floor there were two rows grand arcades with large pillars, which received the weight of the vaults of the ceiling. Above these were the tribunes, a section of arched openings, giving more support. Above these was the ''triforium'', a section of small arches. On the top level, just below the vaults, were the upper windows, the main source of light for the Cathedral.The lower walls were supported by massive ''contreforts'' or buttresses placed directly up against them, with pinnacles on top which provided additional weight.

Later, with the development of the flying buttress, the supports moved further away from the walls, and the walls were built much higher. Gradually the tribunes and the triforium disappeared, and the walls above the arcades were occupied almost entirely with stained glass.{{sfn|Renault|Lazé|2006|p=33}}

The eastern arm shows considerable diversity. In England it is generally long and may have two distinct sections, both choir and presbytery. It is often square ended or has a projecting ''Lady Chapel'', dedicated to the [[Virgin Mary]]. In France the eastern end is often polygonal and surrounded by a walkway called an [[ambulatory]] and sometimes a ring of chapels called a "[[chevet]]". While German churches are often similar to those of France, in Italy, the eastern projection beyond the transept is usually just a shallow apsidal chapel containing the sanctuary, as at [[Florence Cathedral]].&lt;ref name=BF/&gt;&lt;ref name=Swaan&gt;Wim Swaan, ''The Gothic Cathedral''&lt;/ref&gt;

Another characteristic feature of the Gothic style, domestic and ecclesiastical alike, is the division of interior space into individual cells according to the building's ribbing and vaults, regardless of whether or not the structure actually has a vaulted ceiling. This system of cells of varying size and shape juxtaposed in various patterns was again totally unique to antiquity and the [[Early Middle Ages]] and scholars, Frankl included, have emphasised the mathematical and geometric nature of this design. Frankl in particular thought of this layout as "creation by division" rather than the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]]'s "creation by addition." Others, namely [[Viollet-le-Duc]], [[Wilhelm Pinder]], and [[August Schmarsow]], instead proposed the term "articulated architecture."{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=14}} The opposite theory as suggested by [[Henri Focillon]] and [[Jean Bony]] is of "spacial unification", or of the creation of an interior that is made for sensory overload via the interaction of many elements and perspectives.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|pp=14, 17}} Interior and exterior partitions, often extensively studied, have been found to at times contain features, such as thoroughfares at window height, that make the illusion of thickness. Additionally, the [[pier (architecture)|pier]]s separating the isles eventually stopped being part of the walls but rather independent objects that jut out from the actual aisle wall itself.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=17}}

===The pointed arch and the rib vault===

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Both the pointed arch and the rib vault had been used in [[romanesque architecture]], but Gothic builders refined them and used them to much greater effect. They made the structures lighter and stronger, and thus allowed the great heights and expanses of stained glass found in Gothic cathedrals.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|page=46}}

In Romanesque architecture, the rounded arches of the barrel vaults that supported the roof pressed directly down on the walls with crushing weight. This required massive columns, thick walls and small windows, and naturally limited the height of the building. The pointed or broken arch, introduced during the Romanesque period, was stronger, lighter, and carried the thrust outwards, rather than directly downwards.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|page=46}}

The rib vault took advantage of the strength of the pointed arch. The vault was supported by thin ribs or arches of stone, which reached downwards and outwards to cluster around supporting pillars along the inside of the walls. The earlier rib vaults, used at Notre Dame, Noyon, and Laon, were divided by the ribs into six compartments, and could only cross a limited space. In later cathedral construction, the design was improved, and the rib vaults had only four compartments, and could cover a wider span; a single vault could cross the nave, and fewer pillars were needed. The four-part vault was used at Amiens, Reims, and the other later cathedrals, and eventually at cathedrals across Europe.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|page=46}}

In the later period of the Gothic style, the rib vaults lost their elegant simplicity, and were loaded with additional ribs, sculptural designs, and sometimes pendants and other purely decorative elements.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|page=46}}

===Flying buttress===
&lt;gallery mode="packed" heights="200"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Another important feature of Gothic architecture was the [[flying buttress]], designed to support the walls by means of arches connected to counter-supports outside the walls. Flying buttresses had existed in simple forms since Roman times, but the Gothic builders raised their use to a fine art, balancing the thrust from the roof inside against the counter-thrust of the buttresses. The earliest Gothic cathedrals, including Saint-Denis and Notre-Dame in its beginning stages, did not have flying buttresses. Their walls were supported by heavy stone abutments placed directly against the walls, The roof was supported by the ribs of the vaults, which were bundled with the columns below.

In the later 12th and early 13th century, the buttresses became more sophisticated. New arches carried the thrust of the weight entirely outside the walls, where it was met by the counter-thrust of stone columns, with pinnacles placed on top for decoration and for additional weight. Thanks to this system of external buttresses, the walls could be higher and thinner, and could support larger stained glass windows. The buttresses themselves became part of the decoration; the pinnacles became more and more ornate, becoming more and more elaborate, as at [[Beauvais Cathedral]] and [[Reims Cathedral]]. The arches had an additional practical purpose; they contained lead channels which carried rain water off the roof; it was expelled from the mouths of stone [[gargoyles]] placed in rows on the buttresses.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|pp=50–51}}

In the late Gothic periods the buttresses became extremely ornate, with a large amount of non-functional decoration in the form of pinnacles, curving arches, counter-curves, statuary and ornamental pendants.

An important characteristic of Gothic church architecture is its height, both absolute and in proportion to its width, the verticality suggesting an aspiration to Heaven. The increasing height of cathedrals over the Gothic period was accompanied by an increasing proportion of the wall devoted to windows, until, by the late Gothic, the interiors became like cages of glass. This was made possible by the development of the flying buttress, which transferred the thrust of the weight of the roof to the supports outside the walls. As a result, the walls gradually became thinner and higher, and masonry was replaced with glass. The four-part elevation of the naves of early Cathedrals such as Notre-Dame (arcade, tribune, triforium, claire-voie) was transformed in the choir of [[Beauvais Cathedral]] to very tall arcades, a thin triforium, and soaring windows up to the roof.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|page=108}}

Beauvais Cathedral reached the limit of what was possible with Gothic technology. A portion of the choir collapsed in 1284, causing alarm in all of the cities with very tall cathedrals. Panels of experts were created in Sienna and Chartres to study the stability of those structures.{{Sfn|Martindale|1993|p=86}} Only the transept and choir of Beauvais were completed, and in the 21st century the transept walls were reinforced with cross-beams. No cathedral built since exceeded the height of the choir of Beauvais.{{Sfn|Wenzler|2018|page=108}}

A section of the main body of a Gothic church usually shows the [[nave]] as considerably taller than it is wide. In England the proportion is sometimes greater than 2:1, while the greatest proportional difference achieved is at [[Cologne Cathedral]] with a ratio of 3.6:1. The highest internal vault is at [[Beauvais Cathedral]] at {{convert|48|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name=BF/&gt;

One of the most prominent features of Gothic architecture was the use of stained glass window, which steadily grew in height and size and filled cathedrals with light and color. Historians including Viollet-le-Duc, Focillon, Aubert, and [[Max Dvořák]] contended that this is one of the most universal features of the Gothic style.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=20}}

Religious teachings in the Middle Ages, particularly the writings of Religious [[Pseudo-Dionysius]], a 6th-century mystic whose book, ''[[The Celestial Hierarchy]]'', was popular among monks in France, taught that all light was divine. When the Abbot [[Suger]] ordered the reconstruction of the [[Basilica of Saint Denis]], he instructed that the windows in the choir admit as much light as possible.

Many earlier Romanesque churches had stained glass windows, and many had round windows, called ''oculi'', but these windows were necessarily small, due to the thickness of the walls. The primary interior decorations of Romanesque cathedrals were painted murals. In the Gothic period, the improvements in rib vaults and flying buttresses allowed Cathedral walls to be higher, thinner and stronger, and windows were consequently considerably larger, The windows of churches in the late Gothic period, such as [[Sainte Chapelle]] in Paris, filled the entire wall between the ribs of stone. Enormous windows were also an important element of [[York Minster]] and [[Gloucester Cathedral]].&lt;ref name=Swaan/&gt;

The main threat to cathedral windows was the wind; frames had to be extremely strong. The early windows were fit into openings cut into the stone. The small pieces of colored glass were joined together with pieces of lead, and then their surfaces were painted with faces and other details. and then the windows were mounted in the stone frames. Thin vertical and horizontal bars of iron, called ''vergettes'' or ''barlotierres'', were placed inside the window to reinforce the glass.

The stories told in the glass were usually episodes from the Bible, but they also sometimes illustrated the professions of the guilds which had funded the windows, such as the drapers, stonemasons or the barrel-makers.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=28}}

Much of the stained glass in Gothic cathedrals today dates from later restorations, but a few cathedrals, notably [[Chartres Cathedral]] and [[Bourges Cathedral]], still have many of their original windows.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=28}}

===Portals and the tympanum===

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Early Gothic Cathedrals traditionally have their main entrance at the western end of the church, opposite the choir. Based on the model of the [[Basilica of Saint Denis]] and [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], there are usually three doorways with pointed arches, richly filled with sculpture. The [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]], or arch, over each doorway is filled with realistic statues illustrating biblical stories, and the columns between the doors are often also crowded with statuary. Following the example of Amiens, the tympanum over the central portal traditionally depicted the [[Last Judgement]], the right portal showed the coronation of the Virgin Mary, and the left portal showed the lives of saints who were important in the diocese.{{sfn|Renault|Lazé|2006|p=35}}

The iconography of the sculptural decoration on the facade was not left to the artists. An edict of the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] in 787 had set the rules: "The composition of religious images is not to be left to the inspiration of artists; it is derived from the principles put in place by the Catholic Church and religious tradition. Only the art belongs to the artist; the composition belongs to the Fathers."{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=79}}

The portals and interiors were much more colorful than they are today. Each sculpture on the tympanum and in the interior was painted by the ''peintre imagier'', or image painter, following a system of colors codified in the 12th century; yellow, called ''gold'', symbolized intelligence, grandeur and virtue; white, called ''argent'', symbolized purity, wisdom, and correctness; black, or ''sable'', meant sadness, but also will; green, or ''sinopole'', represented hope, liberty and joy; red or ''guelues'' meant charity or victory; blue, or ''azure'' symbolized the sky, faithfulness and perseverance; and violet, or ''pourpre'', was the color of royalty and sovereignty.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=54}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The plan for the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]] called for two towers of equal height on the west facade, and this general plan was copied at Notre-Dame and most of the early cathedrals. The towers of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], 69 meters (226&amp;nbsp;ft) tall, were intended to be seen throughout the city; they were the tallest towers in Paris until the completion of the [[Eiffel Tower]] in 1889. An informal but vigorous competition began in northern France for the tallest Cathedral towers.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=95–98}}

To make the churches taller and more prominent, and visible from a distance, heir builders often added a ''flèche'', a spire usually made of wood and covered with lead, to the top of each tower, or, as in [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], in the center of the transept. Later in the Gothic period, more massive towers were constructed over the transept, rivaling or exceeding in height the towers of the facade.

The towers were usually the last part of the Cathedral to be constructed. They were often built many years or decades after the rest of the building. Sometimes, by the time the towers were built, the plans had changed, or the money had run out. As a result, some Gothic cathedrals had just one tower, or two towers of different heights or styles. On the other hand, [[Laon Cathedral]], begun just before Notre-Dame, boasted five towers; two on the facade, two on the transept, and a central lantern. An additional two were planned but not built. The [[Abbey of Saint-Étienne, Caen]] originally built in the Romanesque style, was rebuilt with nine Gothic towers in the 13th century.

The informal competition for the [[List of tallest church buildings|tallest church in Europe]] went on throughout the Gothic period, sometimes with disastrous results. [[Beauvais Cathedral]] had the tallest tower (153 meters or 502 feet), completed in 1569, for a brief time, until its tower collapsed in the wind in 1573. [[Lincoln Cathedral]] (159.7 meters or 524 feet) also had the record from 1311 until 1549 until its tower also collapsed. Today the tallest cathedral tower in France is [[Rouen Cathedral]], and [[Cologne Cathedral]] (151.0 meters or 495 feet) is the tallest cathedral in Europe.

The Gothic [[Old St Paul's Cathedral]] (1087–1314) had been the tallest cathedral in England until it was destroyed by the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666. Today the tallest combined Gothic tower and spire in the UK belongs to [[Salisbury Cathedral]], (123 meters or 404 feet), built 1220–1258.

In [[Italy]], the tower, if present, is almost always detached from the building, as at [[Florence Cathedral]], and is often from an earlier structure. In [[France]] and [[Spain]], two towers on the front is the norm. In [[England]], [[Germany]] and [[Scandinavia]] this is often the arrangement, but an English cathedral may also be surmounted by an enormous tower at the crossing. Smaller churches usually have just one tower, but this may also be the case at larger buildings, such as [[Salisbury Cathedral]] or [[Ulm Minster]] in [[Ulm]], [[Germany]], completed in 1890 and possessing the tallest spire in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DtS2iD79NgEC|title=Cathedrals|author=Oggins, R.O.|year=2000|work=Metrobooks|publisher=Friedman/Fairfax Publishers|accessdate=6 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; slightly exceeding that of [[Lincoln Cathedral]], the tallest spire that was actually completed during the medieval period, at {{convert|160|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,1950812_2018362,00.html|title=A Brief History of the World's Tallest Buildings|publisher=Time Magazine|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The exteriors and interiors of Gothic cathedrals, particularly in France, were lavishly ornamented with sculpture and decoration on religious themes, designed for the great majority of parishioners who could not read. They were described as "Books for the poor." To add to the effect, all of the sculpture on the facades was originally painted and gilded.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Viollet-le-Duc, Eugéne, ''Dictionnaire Raisonné de l'architecture Française du XIe au XVI siecle'', Volume 6. (Project Gutenburg).&lt;/ref&gt;

Each feature of the Cathedral had a symbolic meaning. The main portals at [[Notre Dame de Paris]], for instance, represented the entrance to paradise, with the [[last judgement]] depicted on the [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] over the doors, showing Christ surrounded by the apostles, and by the signs of the zodiac, representing the movements of the heavens. The columns below the tympanum are in the form of statues of saints, literally reprinting them as "the pillars of the church." {{sfn|McNamara|2017|pp=158–59}}

Each Saint had his own symbol; a winged lion stood for [[Saint Mark]]; an eagle with four wings meant [[Saint John the Apostle]], and a winged bull symbolized [[Saint Luke]]. Sculpted angels had specific functions, sometimes as heralds, blowing trumpete, or holding up columns, as guardian angels; or holding crowns of thorns or crosses, as symbols of the crucifixion of Christ, or waving a container with incense, to illustrate theirfunction at the throne of God. Floral and vegetal decoration was also very common, representing the Garden of Eden; grapes represented the wines of [[Eucharist]].{{sfn|McNamara|2017|pp=158–59}}

The [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] over the central portal on the west facade of [[Notre Dame de Paris]] vividly illustrates the [[Last Judgement]], with figures of sinners being led off to hell, and good Christians taken to heaven. The sculpture of the right portal shows the coronation of the [[Virgin Mary]], and the left portal shows the lives of saints who were important to Parisians, particularly [[Saint Anne]], the mother of the Virgin Mary.{{sfn|Renault|Lazé|2006|p=35}}

The exteriors of cathedrals and other Gothic churches were also decorated with sculptures of a variety of fabulous and frightening [[grotesque (architecture)|grotesques]] or monsters. These included the [[chimera (mythology)|chimera]], a mythical hybrid creature which usually had the body of a lion and the head of a goat, and the [[Strix (mythology)|Strix]] or stryge, a creature resembling an [[owl]] or [[bat]], which was said to eat human flesh. The ''strix'' appeared in classical Roman literature; it was described by the Roman poet [[Ovid]], who was widely read in the Middle Ages, as a large-headed bird with transfixed eyes, rapacious beak, and greyish white wings.&lt;ref name=fasti&gt;Frazer, James George (1933) ed., Ovid, [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0959.phi007.perseus-lat1:6 ''Fasti''] VI. 131–, {{harvp|Riley|1851|p=216}}, tr.&lt;/ref&gt; They were part of the visual message for the illiterate worshipers, symbols of the evil and danger that threatened those who did not follow the teachings of the church.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=97–99}}

The [[gargoyle]]s, which were added to Notre Dame in about 1240, had a more practical purpose. They were the rain spouts of the cathedral, designed to divide the torrent of water which poured from the roof after rain, and to project it outwards as far as possible from the buttresses and the walls and windows so that it would not erode the mortar binding the stone. To produce many thin streams rather than a torrent of water, a large number of gargoyles were used, so they were also designed to be a decorative element of the architecture. The rainwater ran from the roof into lead gutters, then down channels on the flying buttresses, then along a channel cut in the back of the gargoyle and out of the mouth away from the cathedral.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Many of the statues, particularly the grotesques, were removed from facade in the 17th and 18th century, or were destroyed during the [[French Revolution]]. They were replaced with figures in the Gothic style, designed by [[Eugene Viollet-le-Duc]], during the 19th century restoration. Similar figures appear on the other Gothic Cathedrals of France.

Another common feature of Gothic cathedrals in France was a [[labyrinth]] or maze on the floor of the nave near the choir, which symbolized the difficult and often complicated journey of a Christian life before attaining paradise. Most labyrinths were removed by the 18th century, but a few, like the one at [[Amiens Cathedral]], have been reconstructed, and the labyrinth at [[Chartres Cathedral]] still exists essentially in its original form.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=99–100}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

From the 12th century onwards, the Gothic style spread from Northern France to other regions of France and gradually to the rest of the Europe. It was often carried by the highly skilled craftsmen who had trained in the Ile-de-France and then carried their crafts to other cities. The style was adapted to local styles and materials.

In [[Normandy]], the new naves were usually very long, sometimes more than one hundred meters, and, from the long Romanesque tradition, the walls were thicker than in northern France, and had shorter buttresses. The interiors were narrower than in the north, and were given a strong sense of verticality by long and narrow bays and lancet arches. Rose windows were rare, replaced on the exterior by a large bay in ''tiers point''. The facades had less sculptural decoration; decoration in the interior was largely in geometric forms.Norman Gothic also usually featured a profusion of towers, lanterns and spires; spires and spires sometimes were seventy meters high. [[Bayeux Cathedral]], [[Rouen Cathedral]], and [[Coutances Cathedral]] are notable examples of Norman Gothic.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=39–41}}

In [[Burgundy]], which had a long [[Romanesque style]] tradition, a [[lantern tower]] was often included, and cathedrals often had a narrow passage the length of the cathedral at the level of the stained glass windows. as in [[Auxerre Cathedral]].

In the Southwest of France, the walls were thicker, with narrow openings, and doubled with arches. The flying buttress were rarely used, replaced by heavy abutments with chapels between.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=39–41}}

In the South of France, the Gothic cathedrals were often built with brick and tile rather than stone. They generally had thick walls and narrow windows, and were braced by heavy abutments rather than flying buttresses. The form of the tower of [[Toulouse Cathedral]] was copied by several cathedrals in the south. They generally had a single nave or two or three of equal height. Some Gothic cathedrals in the Midi took unusual form; the [[Cathedral of Albi]] (1282–1480) was originally built as fortress, then converted to a cathedral. Albi Cathedral has another very distinctive feature; a colorful interior and painted ceiling.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=39–41}}

The facade of [[Toulouse Cathedral]] is unusual; it is the combination of two unfinished cathedral buildings, begun in the 13th century and finally put together. Toulouse Cathedral has no flying buttresses; it is supported by massive ''contreforts'' the height of the building, with chapels between.

The Gothic style was imported very early into England, in part due to the close connection with the [[Duchy of Normandy]], which until 1204 was still ruled by the Kings of England. The first period is generally called [[early English Gothic]], and was dominant from about 1180 to 1275. The first part of major English cathedral to feature the new style was the choir of [[Canterbury Cathedral]], begun about 1175. It was created by a French master builder, [[William of Sens]]. He added several original touches, including colored marble pavement, double columns in the arcades, and engaged slender ''colonettes'' which reached up to the vaults, borrowed from the design of [[Laon Cathedral]].{{Sfn|Martindale|1993|pages=34–35}} [[Westminster Abbey]] was rebuilt from 1245 to 1517. [[Salisbury Cathedral]] (1220–1320) is also a good example of early Gothic, with the exception of its tower and spire, which were added in 1320.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|p=62}}

The second period of English Gothic is known as [[Decorated Gothic]]. It is customarily divided into two the "Geometric" style (1250–90) and the "Curvilinear" style (1290–1350), and it is similar to the French [[Rayonnant]] style, with an emphasis on curvilinear forms, particularly in the windows. This period saw detailed stone carving reach its peak, with elaborately carved windows and [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]], often with floral patterns, or with an accolade, a carved arch over a window decorated with pinnacles and a [[fleuron (architecture)|fleuron]], or carved floral element.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|p=62}}

The rib vaults of the Decorated Gothic became extremely ornate, with a profusion of ribs which were purely ornamental. The vaults were often decorated with hanging stone pendants. The columns also became more ornamental, as at Peterborough Cathedral, with ribs spreading upward.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|p=62}}

The [[Perpendicular Gothic]] (c. 1380–1520) was final phase of English Gothic, lasting into the 16th century. As the name suggests, its emphasis was on clear horizontal and vertical lines, meeting at right angles. Columns extended upwards all the way to the roof, giving the interior the appearance of a cage of glass and stone, as in the nave of [[Gloucester Cathedral]]. The [[Tudor Arch]] appeared, wider and lower and often framed by moldings, which was used to create larger windows and to balance the strong vertical elements. The design of the rib vaults became even more complex, including the [[fan vault]] with pendants used in the Henry IV chapel at [[Westminster Abbey]] (1503–07).{{sfn|Ducher|1988|p=62}}&lt;ref name=BF/&gt;&lt;ref name=CT/&gt;

A distinctive characteristic of English cathedrals is their extreme length, and their internal emphasis upon the horizontal, which may be emphasised visually as much or more than the vertical lines. Each English cathedral (with the exception of Salisbury) has an extraordinary degree of stylistic diversity, when compared with most French, German and Italian cathedrals. It is not unusual for every part of the building to have been built in a different century and in a different style, with no attempt at creating a stylistic unity. Unlike French cathedrals, English cathedrals sprawl across their sites, with double transepts projecting strongly and ''Lady Chapels'' tacked on at a later date, such as at Westminster Abbey. In the west front, the doors are not as significant as in France, the usual congregational entrance being through a side porch. The West window is very large and never a rose, which are reserved for the transept gables. The west front may have two towers like a French Cathedral, or none. There is nearly always a tower at the crossing and it may be very large and surmounted by a spire. The distinctive English east end is square, but it may take a completely different form. Both internally and externally, the stonework is often richly decorated with carvings, particularly the capitals.&lt;ref name=BF/&gt;&lt;ref name=CT/&gt;

Between the 13th and 16th centuries, Gothic cathedrals were constructed in most of the major cities of northern Europe. For the most part, they followed the French model, but with variations depending upon local traditions and the materials available. The first Gothic churches in Germany were built from about 1230. They included ''[[Liebfrauenkirche, Trier|Liebfrauenkirche]]'' ( ca. 1233–1283) in [[Trier]], claimed to be the oldest Gothic church in Germany,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=UNESCO|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/367|title=UNESCO Cultural Heritage Sites; Liebfrukirche, Trier}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Freiburg Cathedral]], which was built in three stages, the first beginning in 1120, though only the foundations of the original cathedral still exist. It is noted for its 116-metre tower, the only Gothic church tower in Germany that was completed in the Middle Ages (1330).

[[Prague]], in the region [[Bohemia]] within the [[Holy Roman Empire]], was another flourishing center for Gothic architecture. [[Charles IV of Bohemia]] was both King of Bohemia and Holy Roman Empire, and he had monumental tastes. He began construction of [[Prague]]'s [[St. Vitus Cathedral]] in the Gothic style in 1344, as well as a Gothic palace, [[Karlštejn|Karlstein Castle]] in Central Bohemia, and Gothic buildings for the new [[Charles University|University of Prague]]. The nave of [[Prague Cathedral]] featured the filet vault, a decorative type of vault in which the ribs criss-crossed in a mesh pattern, similar to the vaults of [[Bristol Cathedral]] and other English churches. His other Gothic projects included the lavishly-decorated Chapel of the Holy Cross inside [[Karlštejn|Karlstein Castle]] (1357–1367), and the choir of [[Aachen Cathedral]] begun in 1355, which was built on the model of [[Sainte-Chapelle]] in Paris.{{Sfn|Martindale|1993|pages=221–230}} Gothic architecture in Germany and the kingdoms of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] generally followed the French formula, but the towers were much taller and, if completed, were often surmounted by enormous openwork spires. The distinctive character of the interior of German Gothic cathedrals is their breadth and openness. German and Czech cathedrals, like the French, tend not to have strongly projecting [[transept]]s.

[[Brick Gothic]] ({{Lang-de|Backsteingotik}}, {{Lang-pl|Gotyk ceglany}}) is a specific style common in [[Northern Europe]], especially in Northern Germany, Poland and in the regions around the [[Baltic Sea]] without natural rock resources. Prime examples of brick gothic include [[St. Mary's Church, Gdańsk]] (1379–1502),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bazylikamariacka.pl/historia-bazylika-mariacka-gdansk/opis-archikatedralna-bazylika-mariacka|title=Historia Bazyliki Mariackiej w Gdańsku|work=www.bazylikamariacka.pl|accessdate=2009-11-23|language=pl|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031174354/http://www.bazylikamariacka.pl/historia-bazylika-mariacka-gdansk/opis-archikatedralna-bazylika-mariacka|archive-date=31 October 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[St. Mary's Basilica, Kraków]] (1290–1365) and [[Malbork Castle]] (13th century).

[[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna]] (1339–1365) has the distinctive feature of a polychrome roof. Another regional variation is the [[Brabantine Gothic]] a style found in Belgium and the Netherlands. It is characterized by using light-colored [[sandstone]] or limestone, which allowed rich detailing but was prone to erosion. Features included columns with sculpted cabbage-like foliage, arched windows whose points came right up into the vaults. and, sometimes, a wooden ceiling. Examples include [[Grote Kerk, Haarlem]], in [[Haarlem]], the Netherlands, originally built as a Catholic Cathedral, now a Protestant church, and the [[Church of Our Blessed Lady of the Sablon]] in Brussels (15th century).

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Strikingly different variations of the Gothic style appeared in southern Europe, particularly in Spain and Portugal. Important examples of Spanish Gothic include [[Toledo Cathedral]], [[León Cathedral]], and [[Burgos Cathedral]].
The distinctive characteristic of Gothic cathedrals of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] is their spatial complexity, with many areas of different shapes leading from each other. They are comparatively wide, and often have very tall arcades surmounted by low clerestories, giving a similar spacious appearance to the ''Hallenkirche'' of Germany, as at the Church of the [[Batalha Monastery]] in Portugal. Many of the cathedrals are completely surrounded by chapels. Like English cathedrals, each is often stylistically diverse. This expresses itself both in the addition of chapels and in the application of decorative details drawn from different sources. Among the influences on both decoration and form are [[Islamic architecture]] and, towards the end of the period, Renaissance details combined with the Gothic in a distinctive manner. The West front, as at [[Leon Cathedral]], typically resembles a French west front, but wider in proportion to height and often with greater diversity of detail and a combination of intricate ornament with broad plain surfaces. At [[Burgos Cathedral]] there are spires of German style. The roofline often has pierced parapets with comparatively few pinnacles. There are often towers and domes of a great variety of shapes and structural invention rising above the roof.&lt;ref name=BF/&gt;&lt;!---DO NOT CHANGE. READ DISCUSSION PAGE---&gt;

In the territories under the [[Crown of Aragon]] (Aragon, Catalonia, [[Roussillon]] in France, the [[Balearic Islands]], the [[Valencian Community]], among others in the Italian islands), the Gothic style suppressed the [[transept]] and made the [[Aisle#Church architecture|side-aisles]] almost as high as the main nave, creating wider spaces, and with few ornaments. There are two different Gothic styles in the Aragonese lands: [[Catalan Gothic]] and [[Valencian Gothic]], which are different from those in the [[Kingdom of Castile]] and France.

The most important samples of Catalan Gothic style are the cathedrals of [[Girona]], [[Barcelona]], [[Perpignan]] and [[Palma, Majorca|Palma]] (in [[Mallorca]]), the basilica of [[Santa Maria del Mar, Barcelona|Santa Maria del Mar]] (in Barcelona), the [[Santa Maria del Pi, Barcelona|Basílica del Pi]] (in Barcelona), and the church of [[Santa Maria, Manresa|Santa Maria de l'Alba]] in [[Manresa]].

The most important examples of Valencian Gothic style in the old [[Kingdom of Valencia]] are the [[Valencia Cathedral]], [[Llotja de la Seda]] (Unesco World Heritage site), [[Torres de Serranos]], Torres de Quart, [[Monastery of Sant Jeroni de Cotalba]], in [[Alfauir]], [[Palace of the Borgias]] in [[Gandia]], [[Monastery of Santa María de la Valldigna]], [[Basilica of Santa Maria, Alicante|Basilica of Santa Maria]], in [[Alicante]], [[Orihuela Cathedral]], [[Castelló Cathedral]] and [[El Fadrí]], [[Segorbe Cathedral]], etc.

[[Italian Gothic architecture]] went its own particular way, departing from the French model. It was influenced by other styles, notably the [[Byzantine style]] introduced in [[Ravenna]]. Major examples include [[Milan Cathedral]], the [[Orvieto Cathedral]], and particularly [[Florence Cathedral]], before the addition of the Duomo in the Renaissance.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|p=62}}

The Italian style was influenced by the materials available in the different regions; [[marble]] was available in great quantities in [[Tuscany]], and was lavishly used in churches; it was scarce in [[Lombardy]], and brick was used instead. But many of the architectural elements were used apparently mainly to be different from the French style.{{Sfn|Martindale|1993|page=147}}

The [[Cistercian]] monastic order introduced some of the first Gothic churches into Italy, in [[Fossanova Abbey]] (consecrated 1208) and the [[Casamari Abbey]] (1203–1217). They followed the basic plan of the Gothic Cistercian churches of [[Burgundy]], particularly [[Cîteaux Abbey]].{{Sfn|Martindale|1993|page=148}}

The Italian plan is usually regular and symmetrical, Italian cathedrals have few and widely spaced columns. The proportions are generally mathematically equilibrated, based on the square and the concept of "''armonìa''", and except in Venice where they loved flamboyant arches, the arches are almost always equilateral. Italian Gothic cathedrals often retained Romanesque features; the nave of [[Orvieto Cathedral]] had Romanesque arches and vaults.

Italian Cathedrals also offered a variety of plans; [[Florence Cathedral]] (begun 1246) had a rectangular choir, based on the Cistercian model, but was designed to have three wings with polygonal chapels. Italian Gothic cathedrals were general not as tall as those in France; they rarely used flying buttresses, and generally had only two levels, an arcade and a claire-voie with small windows; but [[Bologna Cathedral]] (begun in 1388), rivaled [[Bourges Cathedral]] in France in height. The smallest notable Italian Gothic church is [[Santa Maria della Spina]] in [[Pisa]] (about 1330), which resembles a Gothic jewel box.{{sfn|Martindale|1993|page=148}}

A distinctive characteristic of Italian Gothic is the use of polychrome decoration, both externally as marble veneer on the brick façade and internally where the arches are often made of alternating black and white segments. The columns were sometimes painted red, and the walls were decorated with frescoes and the apse with mosaic. Italian cathedral façades are often polychrome and may include mosaics in the lunettes over the doors. The façades have projecting open porches and ocular or wheel windows rather than roses, and do not usually have a tower. The crossing is usually surmounted by a dome. There is often a free-standing tower and baptistery. The eastern end usually has an apse of comparatively low projection. The windows are not as large as in northern Europe and, although stained glass windows are often found, the favourite narrative medium for the interior is the [[fresco]].&lt;ref name=BF/&gt; The facade of [[Orvieto Cathedral]], begun in 1310, is a striking example of mosaic decoration. Another innovation of Italian Gothic is the bronze doorway covered with sculpture; the most famous examples are the doors of the Baptistry of Florence, by [[Andrea Pisano]] (1330–1336).{{sfn|Martindale|1993|pages=161–175}}

Italian Gothic cathedrals did not have the elaborate sculptural tympanums over the entrances of French cathedrals, but they had abundant realistic sculptural decoration. Some of the finest work was done by [[Nicola Pisano]] at the Baptistery of [[Pisa Cathedral]] (1259–60), and in [[Siena Cathedral]]; and by his son [[Giovanni Pisano]] on the west facade of Pisa Cathedral (1284–85).{{sfn|Martindale|1993|pages=152–176}}

While cathedrals were the most prominent structures in the Gothic style, Gothic features were also built for many monasteries across Europe. Prominent examples were built by the [[Benedictine order|Benedictines]] in England, France, and Normandy. They were the builders of the [[Basilica of St Denis|Abbey of St Denis]], and [[Abbey of Saint-Remi]] in [[France]]. Later Benedictine projects (constructions and renovations) include [[Rouen]]'s [[Church of St. Ouen, Rouen|Abbey of Saint-Ouen]],the Abbey [[La Chaise-Dieu]], and the choir of [[Mont Saint-Michel]] in France.

English examples are [[Westminster Abbey]], originally built as a [[Benedictine]] order monastic church; and the reconstruction of [[Canterbury Cathedral|the Benedictine church at]] [[Canterbury]]. The [[Cistercian Order|Cistercians]] spread the style as far east and south as [[Poland]] and [[Hungary]].{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=28}} Smaller orders such as the [[Carthusian order|Carthusians]] and [[Premonstratensians]] also built some 200 churches, usually near cities.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|pp=29–30}} The [[Franciscans]] and [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] also carried out a transition to Gothic in the 13th and 14th centuries. The [[Teutonic Order]], a military order, spread Gothic art into [[Pomerania]], [[East Prussia]], and the Baltic region.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=30}}

The earliest example of Gothic architecture in Germany is [[Maulbronn Monastery]], a Romanesque [[Cistercian]] abbey in southwest Germany whose [[narthex]] was built in the early 12th century by an anonymous architect.{{sfn|Burton|Kerr|2011|p=79}}

[[Batalha Monastery]] (1386–1517) is a Dominican monastery in [[Batalha, Portugal]]. The monastery was built in the [[Flamboyant Gothic]] style to thank the [[Virgin Mary]] for the Portuguese victory over the [[Kingdom of Castile]] in the [[Battle of Aljubarrota]] in 1385.

The Gothic style appeared in palaces in France, including the Papal Palace in Avignon and the [[Palais de la Cité]] in Paris, close to [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], begun in 1119, which was the principal residence of the French Kings until 1417. Most of the Palais de la Cité is gone, but two of the original towers along the Seine, of the towers, the vaulted ceilings of the Hall of the Men-at-Arms (1302), (now in the [[Conciergerie]]; and the original chapel, [[Sainte-Chapelle]], can still be seen.{{sfn|Texier|2012|p=12}}

The largest civic building built in the Gothic style in France was the [[Palais des Papes]] (Palace of the Popes) constructed between 1252 and 1364, when the Popes fled the political chaos and wars enveloping Rome. Given the complicated political situation, it combined the functions of a church, a seat of government and a fortress.

In the 15th century, following the late Gothic or flamboyant period, elements of Gothic decoration borrowed from cathedrals began to appear in the town halls of northern France, in Flanders and in the Netherlands. The Hôtel de Ville of [[Compiègne]] has an imposing gothic bell tower, featuring a spire surrounded by smaller towers, and its windows are decorated with ornate ''accolades'' or ornamental arches. Similarly flamboyant town halls were found in [[Arras]], [[Douai]], and [[Saint-Quentin, Aisne]], and in modern Belgium, in [[Brussels]] and [[Ghent]] and [[Bruges]].{{sfn|Ducher|1988|p=64}}

Notable Gothic civil architecture in Spain includes the [[Llotja de la Seda|Silk Exchange]] in [[Valencia]], Spain (1482–1548), a major marketplace, which features a main hall with twisting columns beneath its vaulted ceiling. Another Spanish Gothic landmark is the [[Palace of the Kings of Navarre of Olite|Palace of the Kings of Navarre]] in [[Olite]] (1269–1512), which combining the features of a palace and a fortress.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The first universities in Europe were closely associated with the Catholic church, and in the late 15th century they adapted variations of the Gothic style for their architecture. The Gothic style was adapted from English monasteries for use in the first colleges of [[Oxford University]], including [[Magdalen College]]. It was also used at the [[University of Salamanca]] in Spain. The use of the late Gothic style at Oxford and [[Cambridge University]] inspired the picturesque Gothic architecture in U.S. colleges in the 19th and 20th century.

By the late Middle Ages university towns had grown in wealth and importance as well, and this was reflected in the buildings of some of Europe's ancient universities. Particularly remarkable examples still standing nowadays include the [[Collegio di Spagna]] in the [[University of Bologna]], built during the 14th and 15th centuries; the [[Karolinum|Collegium Carolinum]] of the [[Charles University in Prague]] in Bohemia; the [[University of Salamanca|Escuelas mayores]] of the [[University of Salamanca]] in Spain; the chapel of [[King's College, Cambridge]]; or the [[Collegium Maius]] of the [[Jagiellonian University]] in [[Kraków]], Poland.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In the 13th century, the design of the ''chateau fort'', or castle, was modified, based on the Byzantine and Moslem castles the French knights had seen during the [[Crusades]]. The new kind of fortification was called Phillipienne, after [[Philippe Auguste]], who had taken part in the Crusades. The new fortifications were more geometric, usually square, with a high main ''donjon'' or tower, in the center, which could be defended even if the walls of the castle were captured. The Donjon of the [[Chateau de Vincennes]], begun by [[Philip VI of France]], was a good example. It was 52 meters high, the tallest military tower in Europe.

In the Phillipienne castle other towers, usually round were placed at the corners and along the walls, close enough together to support each other. The walls had two levels of walkways on the inside, an upper parapet with openings (''Crénaux'') from which soldiers could watch or fire arrows on besiegers below; narrow openings (''Merlons'') through which they could be sheltered as they fired arrows; and floor openings (''Mâchicoulis''), from which they could drop rocks, burning oil or other objects on the besiegers. The upper walls also had protected protruding balconies, ''Échauguettes'' and ''Bretéches'', from which soldiers could see what was happening at the corners or on the ground below. In addition, the towers and walls were pierced with narrow vertical slits, called ''Meurtriéres'', through which archers could fire arrows. In later castles the slits took the form of crosses, so that archers could fire ''arbalètes'', or [[crossbows]], in different directions.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|pp=66–67}}

Castles were surrounded by deep moat, spanned by a single drawbridge. The entrance was also protected by a grill of iron which could be opened and closed. The walls at the bottom were often sloping, and protected with earthen barriers. One good surviving example is the [[Château de Dourdan]] in the Seine-et-Marne department, near [[Nemours]].&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé (2006), pg. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

After the end of the [[Hundred Years War]] (1337–1453), with improvements in artillery, the castles lost most of their military importance. They remained as symbols of the rank of their noble occupants; the narrowing openings in the walls were often widened into the windows of bedchambers and ceremonial halls. The tower of the Chateau of Vincennes became a royal residence.{{sfn|Renault|Lazé|2006|p=38}}

==Decline==
Beginning in the 16th century, as [[Renaissance architecture]] from Italy began to appear in France and other countries in Europe, the dominance of Gothic architecture began to wane. Nonetheless, new Gothic buildings, particularly churches, continued to be built; new Gothic churches built in Paris in this period included [[Saint-Merri]] (1520–1552); and [[Saint-Germain-l'Auxerrois]]; The first signs of classicism in Paris churches, at [[St-Gervais-et-St-Protais]], did not appear until 1540. The largest new church, [[Saint-Eustache, Paris|Saint-Eustache]] (1532–1560), rivaled Notre-Dame in size, 105 meters long, 44 meters wide, and 35 meters high. As construction of this church continued, elements of Renaissance decoration, including the system of classical orders of columns, were added to the design, making it an early Gothic-Renaissance hybrid.{{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=24–26}}

The Gothic style began to be described as outdated, ugly and even barbaric. The term "Gothic" was first used as a [[pejorative]] description. [[Giorgio Vasari]] used the term "barbarous German style" in his 1550 ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects|Lives of the Artists]]'' to describe what is now considered the Gothic style.{{sfn|Vasari|1991|pp=117, 527}} In the introduction to the ''Lives'' he attributed various architectural features to "[[Goths|the Goths]]" whom he held responsible for destroying the ancient buildings after they conquered [[Rome]], and erecting new ones in this style.{{sfn|Vasari|Brown|Maclehose|1907|p=83}} In the 17th century, [[Molière]] also mocked the Gothic style in the 1669 poem ''La Gloire'': "...the insipid taste of Gothic ornamentation, these odious monstrosities of an ignorant age, produced by the torrents of barbarism..."{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=9}} The dominant styles in Europe became in turn [[Italian Renaissance architecture]], [[Baroque architecture]], and the grand classicism of the [[Louis XIV style]].

Nonetheless, Gothic architecture, usually churches or university buildings, continued to be built. Ireland was an island of Gothic architecture in the 17th and 18th centuries, with the construction of [[St Columb's Cathedral|Derry Cathedral]] (completed 1633), [[St John the Baptist Cathedral, Sligo|Sligo Cathedral]] (c. 1730), and [[Down Cathedral]] (1790–1818) are other notable examples.&lt;ref&gt;-Bob Hunter [http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/plantation/transcripts/pa01_t06.shtml "Londonderry Cathedtral"]. BBC.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th and 18th century several important Gothic buildings were constructed at [[Oxford University]] and [[Cambridge University]], including [[Tom Tower]] at [[Christ Church, Oxford]], by [[Christopher Wren]] (1681–82) It also appeared, in a whimsical fashion, in [[Horace Walpole]]'s [[Twickenham]] [[villa]], [[Strawberry Hill House|Strawberry Hill]] (1749–1776) The two western towers of [[Westminster Abbey]] were constructed between 1722 and 1745 by [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]], opening a new period of [[Gothic Revival]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;
In England, partly in response to a philosophy propounded by the [[Oxford Movement]] and others associated with the emerging revival of 'high church' or [[Anglo-Catholic]] ideas during the second quarter of the 19th century, neo-Gothic began to become promoted by influential establishment figures as the preferred style for ecclesiastical, civic and institutional architecture. The appeal of this [[Gothic revival]] (which after 1837, in Britain, is sometimes termed [[Victorian Gothic]]), gradually widened to encompass "low church" as well as "high church" clients. This period of more universal appeal, spanning 1855–1885, is known in Britain as [[High Victorian Gothic]].

The [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]] in London by Sir [[Charles Barry]] with interiors by a major exponent of the early Gothic Revival, [[Augustus Welby Pugin]], is an example of the Gothic revival style from its earlier period in the second quarter of the 19th century. Examples from the ''High Victorian Gothic'' period include [[George Gilbert Scott]]'s design for the [[Albert Memorial]] in London, and [[William Butterfield]]'s chapel at [[Keble College, Oxford]]. From the second half of the 19th century onwards, it became more common in Britain for neo-Gothic to be used in the design of non-ecclesiastical and non-governmental buildings types. Gothic details even began to appear in working-class housing schemes subsidised by philanthropy, though given the expense, less frequently than in the design of upper and middle-class housing.

The middle of the 19th century was a period marked by the restoration, and in some cases modification, of ancient monuments and the construction of neo-Gothic edifices such as the nave of [[Cologne Cathedral]] and the [[Sainte-Clotilde, Paris|Sainte-Clotilde]] of [[Paris]] as speculation of medieval architecture turned to technical consideration. London's Palace of Westminster, St. Pancras railway station, New York's Trinity Church and St. Patrick's Cathedral are also famous examples of Gothic Revival buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.architecturaldigest.com/gothic-architecture|title=Gothic Architecture and Churches {{!}} Architectural Digest|website=Architectural Digest|access-date=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such style also reached the [[Far East]] in the period, for instance, the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] [[St. John's Cathedral (Hong Kong)|St. John's Cathedral]] which was located at the centre of [[Victoria, Hong Kong|Victoria City]] in [[Central, Hong Kong]].

While some credit for this new ideation can reasonably be assigned to German and English writers, namely [[Johannes Vetter]], Franz Mertens, and Robert Willis respectively, this emerging style's champion was [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]], whose lead was taken by archaeologists, historians, and architects like [[Jules Quicherat]], [[Auguste Choisy]], and [[Marcel Aubert]].{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=11}} In the last years of the 19th century, a trend among study in art history emerged in Germany that a building, as defined by [[Henri Focillon]] was an interpretation of space.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=13}} When applied to Gothic cathedrals, historians and architects used to the dimensions of 17th and 18th [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] or [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] structures, were astounded by the height and extreme length of the cathedrals compared to its proportionally modest width. [[Goethe]], in the preceding century, was mesmerised by the space within a Gothic church and succeeding historians like [[Georg Dehio]], Walter Ueberwasser, [[Paul Frankl]], and Maria Velte sought to rediscover the methodology used in their construction by making measurements and drawings of the buildings, and reading and making conjectures from documents and treaties pertaining to their construction.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=14}}

France had an abundance of original Gothic architecture, and therefore Gothic restoration largely replaced revival; few new buildings appeared in the Gothic style.

The [[French Revolution]] caused enormous damage to the Gothic architecture of France. [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] and other cathedrals and churches were closed and stripped of much of their decoration. In the 1830s, under the new King, [[Louis-Philippe]], the historic and artistic value of Cathedrals and other Gothic monuments was recognized. Interest in the Gothic style was also stimulated by the huge success of the novel ''Notre Dame de Paris'' (known in English as ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'') by [[Victor Hugo]], published in 1831. The writings of the romantic author [[François-René de Chateaubriand]] also played an important part; he praised the religious sentiments inspired by of the Gothic style, and declaring that the Gothic style was "the true architecture of our country," as important in the history of France as the forests of ancient Gaul.{{Sfn|Toman|2007|page=99}} A Commission of Historic Monuments was created in 1837, and major program of cataloging, protection and restoration of Gothic monuments was organized by the writer [[Prosper Merimée]] and conducted largely by the architect [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]].{{Sfn|Toman|2007|page=99}}

[[Viollet-le-Duc]] conducted the restoration of [[Notre Dame de Paris]] and many other churches, as well as the Gothic fortifications of [[Carcasonne]] and imaginatively finishing the castle of [[Château de Pierrefonds]], which had been only a ruin.{{Sfn|Poisson|2014}} He did not always limit himself to strict restoration of what had existed; in 1838 he designed he built a new Gothic west facade for the Parish church of Saint-Ouen in [[Rouen]]. The architects [[Franz Christian Gau]] and then [[Théodore Ballu]] built [[Sainte-Clotilde, Paris|The Basilica of Sainte-Clotilde]] (1846–57), the first entirely neo-Gothic church in Paris.{{Sfn|Toman|2007|page=101}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
German Gothic revival was born in 1785–86 in the [[Dessau-Wörlitz Garden Realm]], an early landscape garden built by near [[Potsdam]], in the garden of the country house of [[Leopold III, Duke of Anhalt-Dessau]], designed by [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Erdmannsdorff]]. The ''Gothic House'' displayed his collection of medieval stained glass. It inspired other Gothic-style country houses near Berlin and Kassel. {{sfn|Toman|2007|page=156}}

In Germany, the early 19th century Gothic revival had close ties to the movement of [[Romanticism]]. Beginning in 1814, the writer and historian [[Joseph Gorres]] launched a movement for the completion [[Cologne cathedral]], which had been halted in 1473. The work was begun in 1842, and the two towers were completed in 1880, six hundred years after the cathedral was begun. Similar projects were undertaken for [[Ulm Minster]], [[Heilsbronn Abbey]] and the [[Isartor]] gate in Munich. The Baroque decoration of these monuments was removed, and they were returned to at least an approximation, sometimes romanticized, of their original Gothic appearance. {{sfn|Toman|2007|page=156}}

The most picturesque example of Gothic revival is [[Neuschwanstein Castle]] (1869–1876) in Bavaria built by [[Ludwig II of Bavaria]]. For inspiration, Ludwig visited other Gothic reconstruction projects, [[Warburg]] and [[Château de Pierrefonds]], a castle which had been reconstructed by [[Eugene Viollet-le-Duc]]. The highly romantic Neuschwanstein Castle inspired, among other later buildings, the Sleeping Beauty Castle in [[Disneyland]] (1955).

Though Russia had no tradition of Gothic architecture, The Empress [[Catherine the Great]] chose the style in [[Tsaritsyno Palace]], a large palace complex she constructed south of Moscow from 1776 until her death in 1796. Later, Czar [[Nicholas I of Russia]] commissioned the German romantic writer and painter [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]] to design a Gothic chapel for his park at [[Peterhof Palace]] near St. Petersburg. It was completed in 1834.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The Gothic revival in Italy focused on the completion of earlier Cathedrals, which had been largely left to crumble. The most striking example was [[Milan Cathedral]], which received a new facade in 1806–1813 which almost completely covered the original; it was designed by Giuseppe Zanoia and [[Carlo Amati]]. In 1888 it received a Gothic crown on the front facade by [[Giuseppe Brentano]]. The famous spires and pinnacles of the building date to the 19th century.{{sfn|Toman|2007|page=123}}

A small but notable example of Gothic revival in Italy is the [[Pedrocchi Café]] in Padua, Italy (1837), by [[Giuseppe Jappelli]]. It borrowed the [[Venetian Gothic]] style plus the pinnacles of Milan Cathedral. It became famous as the meeting place of Italian patriots rebelling against Austrian rule in 1848.

The English Gothic revival style was imported from England beginning in the 1830s, and was used primarily for Anglican and Catholic churches, and for university buildings. The best-known Gothic revival buildings in Canada are those [[Centre Bloc]] and the [[Victoria Tower (Canada)|Victoria Tower]] of the [[Parliament of Canada]] on [[Parliament Hill]] in Ottawa, by [[Thomas Fuller (architect)|Thomas Fuller]] (1859–1927).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/appendix_a |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-31 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150624082557/http://dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/appendix_a |archivedate=2015-06-24 |df= }} List of Dominion Architects of Canada&lt;/ref&gt; The architect [[William Thomas (architect)|William Thomas]] constructed [[St. Michael's Cathedral, Toronto|St. Michael's Cathedral]] in Toronto (1845–48), and several other Gothic revival churches in the Province of [[Ontario]].

The Gothic style was entirely contrary to the early [[Puritan]] architecture in the United States, which valued simplicity and a lack of ornament. It was also contrary to the Neoclassical style used for early U.S. government buildings. However, in the mid to late 19th century, large cathedrals and churches began to be built in the Gothic Revival style, modeled after European cathedrals. University buildings also adopted the style, using English colleges as a model. In the early 20th century, Gothic decorative elements appeared on the towers of the new skyscrapers, notably the [[Woolworth Building]] by [[Cass Gilbert]] in New York and the [[Chicago Tribune Building]] in [[Chicago]], by [[John Mead Howells]] and [[Raymond Hood]], symbolizing the role of these buildings as "cathedrals of commerce."&lt;ref&gt;Christen, Barbara S. and Flanders, Steven (editors).

''Raymond Hood, Architect – Form Through Function in the American Skyscraper''. Architectural Book Publishing Co Inc, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gothic architecture also inspired a popular style of residential architecture in the United States in the mid-19th century. It was known as [[Carpenter Gothic]], and featured pointed [[lancet windows]], a steep gable roof, and other simple Gothic elements, embellished with wooden ornament cut with a [[Jigsaw (tool)|jigsaw]] or a [[scroll saw]] in Gothic designs. Sometimes the wooden trim was attached to a brick house. It became a popular style for wooden churches in rural communities. An example of Carpenter Gothic house, the [[American Gothic House]], in [[Eldon, Iowa]] appears in the background of the celebrated painting ''[[American Gothic]]'' by [[Grant Wood]], and gave the painting its name.&lt;ref name=Slate&gt;Fineman, Mia (June 8, 2005).

In the 19th century the Gothic style of church architecture was transported to Latin America by the Spanish and Portuguese, where it became a symbol of Christian values and traditions. It was also exported to Asia, largely for the churches of the European settlements there. The English Gothic style was a major influence in Australia, both for churches and civic buildings. [[Perth Town Hall]] (1867–70) was the only town hall in Australia (or perhaps anywhere) constructed by convicts.&lt;ref&gt;Phelps, Delys (1969) ''100 years : a history of the Perth Town Hall'' originally printed in the [[Royal Western Australian Historical Society]]'s Journal. – reprinted by the Perth city council in 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Basilica of the Twenty-Six Holy Martyrs of Japan (Nagasaki)|Basilica of the Twenty=Six Holy Martyrs]] (1879) was an enlargement of the first Christian church in Japan, which had been built in 1864. It survived the dropping of an atomic bomb on [[Nagasaki]] in August 1945. The plan was taken from a Belgian model, and the stained glass was imported from France.

The [[Templo Expiatorio del Santísimo Sacramento|Church of the Holy Sacrament]] in [[Guadalajara]], Mexico was begun in 1897, but construction was halted by the [[Mexican Revolution]], and it was not completed until 1972.

[[St. Ignatius Cathedral|Shanghai Cathedral]] in [[China]] (1906–1910) was originally built by the [[Jesuits]] as their primary church in the trading port of Shanghai. In 1966, at the opening of the [[Cultural Revolution]], [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] from Beijing vandalized the [[cathedral]], tearing down its [[spire]]s and ceiling, and smashing its roughly 300 square meters of stained glass. For the next ten years the Cathedral served as a state-owned grain warehouse. It was reopened in 1978 and the spires were restored in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/features/religion/la-tm-china29jul16,1,1569645.story?ctrack=1&amp;cset=true_no=1 Jesus in China]&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, the city of [[Mumbai]] (formerly Bombay) has a rich collection of neo-Gothic architecture. The style is found in the University buildings, the courthouse, and in the [[Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus railway station]] (former Victoria Terminus), the main railway station.

==Influences==
===Political===
The roots of the Gothic style lie in those towns that, since the 11th century, had been enjoying increased prosperity and growth, began to experience more and more freedom from traditional [[Feudalism|feudal]] authority.{{sfn|Mitchell|1968|p=9}} At the end of the 12th century, Europe was divided into a multitude of [[city state]]s and kingdoms. The area encompassing modern [[Germany]], southern [[Denmark]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Switzerland]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Austria]], [[Slovakia]], [[Czech Republic]] and much of northern [[Italy]] (excluding [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] and [[Papal State]]) was nominally part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], but local rulers exercised considerable autonomy under the system of [[Feudalism]]. [[Kingdom of France|France]], [[Denmark]], [[Kingdom of Poland (1025–1385)|Poland]], [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]], [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]], [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]] and [[Kingdom of Cyprus|Cyprus]] were independent kingdoms, as was the [[Angevin Empire]], whose [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet kings]] ruled [[Kingdom of England|England]] and large domains in what was to become modern [[France]].{{efn|Section from "''L'art Gothique''," translated into English: "England was one of the first regions to adopt, during the first half of the 12th century, the new Gothic architecture born in France. Historic relationships between the two countries played a determining role: in 1154, Henry II (1154–1189) became the first of the Anjou Plantagenet kings to ascend to the throne of England."}} [[Norway]] came under the influence of [[England]], while the other Scandinavian countries and [[Poland]] were influenced by trading contacts with the [[Hanseatic League]]. [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevin]] kings brought the Gothic tradition from France to [[Southern Italy]], while [[Lusignan]] kings introduced [[French Gothic]] architecture to [[Cyprus]]. Gothic art is sometimes viewed as the art of the era of feudalism but also as being connected to change in medieval social structure, as the Gothic style of architecture seemed to parallel the beginning of the decline of feudalism.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|pp=20, 24}} Nevertheless, the influence of the established feudal elite can be seen in the [[Chateaux]] of French lords and in those churches sponsored by feudal lords.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=24}}

Throughout Europe at this time there was a rapid growth in trade and an associated growth in towns,&lt;ref name=BF&gt;Banister Fletcher, ''A History of Architecture on the Comparative Method''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JH1&gt;John Harvey, ''The Gothic World''&lt;/ref&gt; and they would come to be predominate in Europe by the end of the 13th century.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=24}} Germany and the [[Low Countries]] had large flourishing towns that grew in comparative peace, in trade and competition with each other or united for mutual weal, as in the Hanseatic League. Civic building was of great importance to these towns as a sign of wealth and pride. England and France remained largely feudal and produced grand domestic architecture for their kings, dukes and [[bishops]], rather than grand [[town hall]]s for their [[Medieval bourgeoisie|burghers]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Viollet-le-Duc contended that the blossoming of the Gothic style came about as a result of growing freedoms in construction professions.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=24}}

The primary use of the Gothic style is in religious structures, naturally leading it to an association with the Church and it is considered to be one of the most formal and coordinated forms of the physical church, thought of as being the physical residence of God on Earth. According to [[Hans Sedlmayr]], it was "even the considered the temporal image of [[Paradise]], of the [[New Jerusalem]]." The horizontal and vertical scope of the Gothic church, filled with the light thought of as a symbol of the grace of God admitted into the structure via the style's iconic windows are among the very best examples of Christian architecture. [[Louis Grodecki|Grodecki]]'s ''[[#{{sfnref|Grodecki|1977}}|Gothic Architecture]]'' also notes that the glass pieces of various colors that make up those windows have been compared to "precious stones encrusting the walls of the New Jerusalem," and that "the numerous towers and pinnacles evoke similar structures that appear in the visions of [[John the Apostle|Saint John]]." Another idea, held by [[Georg Dehio]] and [[Erwin Panofsky]], is that the designs of Gothic followed the current theological scholastic thought.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=20}} The [[PBS]] show [[Nova (TV series)|NOVA]] explored the influence of the [[Bible]] in the dimensions and design of some cathedrals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Building the Great Cathedrals|series=[[Nova (TV series)|Nova]]|last1=Tiffany|first1=Scott|last2=Tinworth|first2=Rob|last3=Barako|first3=Tristian|network=[[PBS]]|date=19 October 2010|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/building-gothic-cathedrals.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geographic===
[[File:Durham Cathedral. Interior.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The transition from [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] to Gothic styles is visible at the [[Durham Cathedral]] in [[England]], where both pointed and round arches are used in the cathedral's design.]]
 
From the 10th to the 13th century, [[Romanesque architecture]] had become a pan-European style and manner of construction, affecting buildings in countries as far apart as [[Ireland]] and [[Croatia]], and [[Sweden]] and [[Sicily]]. The same wide geographic area was then affected by the development of Gothic architecture, but the acceptance of the Gothic style and methods of construction differed from place to place, as did the expressions of Gothic taste. The proximity of some regions meant that modern country borders did not define divisions of style. On the other hand, some regions such as [[England]] and [[Spain]] produced defining characteristics rarely seen elsewhere, except where they have been carried by itinerant craftsmen, or the transfer of bishops.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Many different factors like geographical/geological, economic, social, or political situations caused the regional differences in the great abbey churches and cathedrals of the Romanesque period that would often become even more apparent in the Gothic. For example, studies of the population statistics reveals disparities such as the multitude of churches, abbeys, and cathedrals in northern [[France]] while in more urbanised regions construction activity of a similar scale was reserved to a few important cities. Such an example comes from Roberto López, wherein the French city of [[Amiens]] was able to fund its architectural projects whereas [[Cologne]] could not because of the economic inequality of the two.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=25-26}} This wealth, concentrated in rich monasteries and noble families, would eventually spread certain Italian, Catalan, and Hanseatic bankers.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=25}} This would be amended when the economic hardships of the 13th century were no longer felt, allowing [[Normandy]], [[Tuscany]], [[Flanders]], and the southern [[Rhineland]] to enter into competition with France.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=26}}

The local availability of materials affected both construction and style. In [[France]], [[limestone]] was readily available in several grades, the very fine white limestone of [[Caen]] being favoured for sculptural decoration. England had coarse limestone and red [[sandstone]] as well as dark green [[Purbeck marble]] which was often used for architectural features. In [[northern Germany]], [[Netherlands]], northern [[Poland]], [[Denmark]], and the Baltic countries local building stone was unavailable but there was a strong tradition of building in brick. The resultant style, [[Brick Gothic]] – called {{lang|pl|Gotyk ceglany}} in [[Poland]] and {{lang|de|Backsteingotik}} in [[Germany]] and [[Scandinavia]] – is also associated with the [[Hanseatic League]]. In [[Italy]], stone was used for [[fortifications]], so brick was preferred for other buildings. Because of the extensive and varied deposits of marble, many buildings were faced in marble, or were left with undecorated façade so that this might be achieved at a later date. The availability of timber also influenced the style of architecture, with timber buildings prevailing in [[Scandinavia]]. Availability of timber affected methods of roof construction across Europe. It is thought that the magnificent [[hammerbeam]] roofs of England were devised as a direct response to the lack of long straight seasoned timber by the end of the Medieval period, when forests had been decimated not only for the construction of vast roofs but also for ship building.&lt;ref name=BF/&gt;&lt;ref name=CT&gt;Alec Clifton-Taylor, ''The Cathedrals of England''&lt;/ref&gt;

The pointed arch, one of the defining attributes of Gothic, was earlier incorporated into [[Islamic architecture]] following the [[Islamic conquest of Syria|Islamic conquests of]] [[Roman Syria]] and the [[Sassanid Empire]] in the 7th century.&lt;ref name=BF/&gt; The pointed arch and its precursors had been employed in [[Roman Architecture|Late Roman]] and [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanian]] architecture; within the Roman context, evidenced in early church building in [[Syria]] and occasional secular structures, like the Roman [[Karamagara Bridge]]; in [[Sassanid]] architecture, in the parabolic and pointed arches employed in palace and sacred construction.&lt;ref name=Warren1991&gt;{{cite journal|last=Warren|first=John|year=1991|title=Creswell's Use of the Theory of Dating by the Acuteness of the Pointed Arches in Early Muslim Architecture|periodical=Muqarnas|volume=8|pages=59–65 (61–63)|doi=10.2307/1523154|jstor=1523154|publisher=BRILL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Petersen, Andrew (2002-03-11). Dictionary of Islamic Architecture, pp. 295-296. Routledge. {{ISBN|978-0-203-20387-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Use of the pointed arch seems to have taken off dramatically after its incorporation into Islamic architecture. It begins to appear throughout the Islamic world in close succession after its adoption in the late Umayyad or early Abbasid period. Some examples are the [[Al-Ukhaidir Fortress|Al-Ukhaidir Palace]] (775 AD), the Abbasid reconstruction of the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque|Al-Aqsa mosque]] in 780 AD, the [[White Mosque, Ramla|Ramlah Cisterns]] (789 AD), the [[Great Mosque of Samarra]] (851 AD), and the [[Mosque of Ibn Tulun]] (879 AD) in Cairo. It also appears in one of the early reconstructions of the [[Great Mosque of Kairouan]] in Tunisia, and the Mosque–Cathedral of Córdoba in 987 AD. [[David Talbot Rice]] points out that, "The pointed arch had already been used in Syria, but in the mosque of Ibn Tulun we have one of the earliest examples of its use on an extensive scale, some centuries before it was exploited in the West by the Gothic architects."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Islamic Art|last=Rice|first=David T.|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|year=1979|isbn=9780500201503|pages=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasing military and cultural contacts with the [[Muslim world]], including the [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|Norman conquest]] of [[History of Islam in southern Italy|Islamic Sicily]] in 1090, the [[Crusades]] (beginning 1096), and the [[Al-Andalus|Islamic presence in Spain]], may have influenced [[Medieval Europe]]'s adoption of the pointed arch, although this hypothesis remains controversial.{{sfn|Scott|2003|p=113}}{{sfn|Bony|1983|p=17}} Certainly, in those parts of the [[Western Mediterranean]] subject to Islamic control or influence, rich regional variants arose, fusing [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and later Gothic traditions with [[Islamic architecture|Islamic]] decorative forms, for example in [[Monreale Cathedral|Monreale]] and [[Cefalù Cathedral]]s, the [[Alcázar of Seville]], and [[Teruel Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, L.

A number of scholars have cited the [[Armenia]]n [[Cathedral of Ani]], completed 1001 or 1010, as a possible influence on the Gothic, especially due to its use of pointed arches and cluster [[pier (architecture)|piers]].{{sfn|Lang|1980|p=223|ps=: "With this experience behind him, it is not surprising that [[Trdat the Architect|Trdat]]'s creation of the Cathedral at [[Ani]] turned out to be a masterpiece. Even without its dome, the cathedral amazes the onlooker. Technically, it is far ahead of the contemporary [[Anglo-Saxon architecture|Anglo-Saxon]] and [[Norman architecture]] of Europe. Already, pointed arches and clustered piers, whose appearance together is considered one of the hallmarks of mature Gothic architecture, are found in this remote corner of the Christian East."}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kite|first=Stephen|title='South Opposed to East and North': Adrian Stokes and Josef Strzygowski. A study in the aesthetics and historiography of Orientalism|journal=[[Art History (journal)|Art History]]|date=September 2003|volume=26|issue=4|p=519|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0141-6790.2003.02604002.x/full|quote=To Near Eastern scholars the [[Armenia]]n [[Ani Cathedral|cathedral at]] [[Ani]] (989–1001), designed by [[Trdat the Architect|Trdat]] (972–1036), seemed to anticipate Gothic.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Stewart|1959|p=80|ps=: "The most important examples of [[Armenian architecture]] are to be found at [[Ani]], the capital, and the most important of these is [[Ani Cathedral|the cathedral]]. [...] The most interesting features of this building are its pointed arches and vaults and the clustering or coupling of the columns in the Gothic manner."}}{{sfn|Rice|1972|p=179|ps=: "The interior of [[Ani Cathedral|Ani cathedral]], a longitudinal stone building with pointed vaults and a central dome, built about 1001, is astonishingly Gothic in every detail, and numerous other equally close parallels could be cited."}} However, other scholars such as [[Sirarpie Der Nersessian]], who rejected this notion as she argued that the pointed arches did not serve the same function of supporting the vault.{{sfn|Garsoïan|2015|p=300}} [[Lucy Der Manuelian]] contends that some [[Armenians]] (historically documented as being in Western Europe in the [[Middle Ages]]){{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=37}} could have brought the knowledge and technique employed at Ani to the west.{{sfn|Der Manuelian|2001|p=7}}

The view held by the majority of scholars however is that the pointed arch evolved naturally in Western Europe as a structural solution to a technical problem, with evidence for this being its use as a stylistic feature in Romanesque French and English churches.{{sfn|Scott|2003|p=113}}

'''Imagery''', in a literary text, is an author's use of vivid and descriptive language to add depth to their work. It appeals to human senses to deepen the reader's understanding of the work. Powerful forms of imagery engage all of the senses.

==Forms== 
There are seven major types of imagery, each corresponding to a sense, feeling, action, or reaction:

*'''Visual imagery''' pertains to graphics, visual scenes, pictures, or the sense of sight.
*'''Auditory imagery''' pertains to sounds, noises, music, or the sense of hearing. (This kind of imagery may come in the form of [[onomatopoeia]]).
*'''Olfactory imagery''' pertains to odors, scents, or the sense of smell.
*'''Gustatory imagery''' pertains to flavors or the sense of taste.
*'''Tactile imagery''' pertains to physical textures or the sense of touch.

===Less used===
*'''Kinesthetic imagery''' pertains to movements.
*'''Organic imagery / subjective imagery''', pertains to personal experiences of a character's body, including emotion and the senses of hunger, thirst, fatigue, and pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poetics of Robert Frost: Examples|url=http://www.frostfriends.org/imagery.html|publisher=Friends of Robert Frost|accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis''' ('''IIASA''') is an international research organization located in [[Laxenburg]], near [[Vienna]], in [[Austria]]. IIASA conducts [[interdisciplinary]] scientific studies on [[natural environment|environmental]], [[economic]], [[technological]] and [[social issues]] in the context of human dimensions of [[global change]]. IIASA’s mission is "to provide insights and guidance to policymakers worldwide by finding solutions to global and universal problems through applied systems analysis in order to improve human and social wellbeing and to protect the environment."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Admin/DI/docs/IIASA%20Strategic%20Plan%202011-20201.pdf IIASA's New Strategic Plan 2011-2020], retrieved 2 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization ==
IIASA brings its experience of managing international tensions through science to today's [[global issue]]s. Its multinational and multidisciplinary teams of researchers have a growing membership, now including the world's four largest economies.

The institute is currently directed by [https://web.archive.org/web/20110716175200/http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Admin/DI/docs/director.html?sb=1 Pavel Kabat]. [[Nebojsa Nakicenovic]] is the current Deputy Director General/ Deputy CEO.  Past directors have included  [[Howard Raiffa]], professor at [[Harvard]]'s [[Harvard Business School|Business School]] and [[Kennedy School of Government]], Roger Levien, former Vice President for Strategy at [[Xerox]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20110123131844/http://ies.jrc.ec.europa.eu/uploads/fileadmin/H00/hordijk_CV-IES.pdf Leen Hordijk], former Director at the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100414042251/http://ies.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.php Institute for Environment and Sustainability], Joint Research Centre, European Commission, Ispra, Italy, and Detlof von Winterfeldt, professor at the [[University of Southern California]].&lt;ref&gt;http://en.www.mcu.es/bibliotecas/docs/MC/2012/CongresoBP/leviening.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

IIASA is a non-governmental institution funded by scientific organizations in its member countries, which currently include: Australia, Austria, Brazil, China, Egypt, Finland, Germany, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Norway, Pakistan, Republic of Korea, Russia, South Africa, Sweden, Ukraine, and the USA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Admin/DI/docs/IIASA_NMO.html IIASA's National Member Organizations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050627082900/http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Admin/DI/docs/IIASA_NMO.html |date=27 June 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Funding for the Institute also comes from contracts, grants, and donations from governments, international organizations, academia, business, and individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/about/whatisiiasa/funding/funding.html IIASA Funding]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
On 4{{nbsp}}October 1972 representatives of the [[Soviet Union]], [[United States]], and 10 other countries from the Eastern and Western blocs met at [[The Royal Society]] in [[London]] to sign the charter establishing IIASA.&lt;ref&gt;Profile of IISA appended to summary of "Energy in a Finite World" (1981) http://www.iiasa.ac.at/publication/more_XB-81-202.php&lt;/ref&gt; It was the culmination of six years’ effort driven forward by both the US President [[Lyndon Johnson]] and the USSR Premier [[Alexei Kosygin]]. For IIASA it was the beginning of a remarkable project to use scientific cooperation to build bridges across the [[Cold War]] divide and to confront growing global problems on a truly international scale.&lt;ref&gt;McDONALD, A. (1998), Scientific Cooperation as a Bridge Across the Cold War Divide: The Case of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) . Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 866: 55–83. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1998.tb09147.x&lt;/ref&gt; The first scientist had arrived at IIASA in June, 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Jermen Gvishiani and Roger E. Lewis in Foreword to "Energy in a Finite World"(1981) http://www.iiasa.ac.at/publication/more_XB-81-202.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Clearly, success at bridge building and successful science would go hand in hand. But neither was a foregone conclusion. This was the 1970s, and most research organizations focused on national issues. Few encouraged researchers from different countries or disciplines to work together for the greater good.

To achieve its ambitious research vision, IIASA would have to break down the barriers between nations and disciplines. This it did, building international multidisciplinary teams to confront innumerable global challenges, both long-standing and emerging.   For example, a study on water pollution carried out in the 1980s by a team of IIASA chemists, biologists, and economists still forms the basis of modern water policy design in Japan, USA, and the former USSR.

When the [[Cold War]] ended (in 1991), IIASA’s sponsoring countries could have said “mission accomplished” and disbanded the Institute. IIASA had certainly helped foster mutual understanding among scientists from East and West. But it had also done more than this. IIASA had shown the scientific benefits of bringing together different nationalities and disciplines to work toward common goals.  Indeed, this approach has been widely imitated, for example, in the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] and the [[International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme]].

So instead of closing in the 1990s the Institute broadened its mandate from the East and West to a truly global focus.  Today IIASA brings together a wide range of scientific skills to provide science-based insights into critical policy issues in international and national debates on global change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iiasa.ac.at/docs/history_short.html?sb=3 A Brief History of IIASA], retrieved 2 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current research ==
IIASA research focuses on complex problems that extend beyond a single country or a single discipline.

In 2010, IIASA launched a new strategic plan for the next ten years, which focuses on three general problem areas: Energy and Climate Change, Food and Water, and Poverty and Equity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/research/Research.en.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Every year approximately 200 researchers from over 35 countries research at IIASA.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/about/whatisiiasa/informationkit/flyer-iiasa.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; They work on these broader topics within and across 9 research programs: Advanced Systems Analysis, Ecosystems Services and Management, Energy, Evolution and Ecology, Mitigation of Air Pollution and Greenhouse Gases, Risk, Policy and Vulnerability, Transitions to New Technologies, Water, and World Population.

'''Major Projects'''

Ten IIASA scientists were among the authors of the [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]] (the work of the IPCC, including the contributions of many scientists, was recognised by the joint award of the [[2007 Nobel Peace Prize|2007]] [[Nobel Peace Prize]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/about/achievments/iiasaandthenobelprize/ipcc/IPCC.en.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203000256/http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/about/achievments/iiasaandthenobelprize/ipcc/IPCC.en.html |archivedate=3 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Global Energy Assessment, released in 2012.  The report was a result of collaborative and integrated work of over 500 authors, analysts and reviewers worldwide who contributed independent, scientifically based and policy-relevant analysis of current and emerging energy issues and options. The assessment provides a thorough assessment of energy-related issues including sustainable development, including poverty eradication, climate change mitigation, health, energy security and energy access.&lt;ref&gt;GEA, 2012: [http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/research/Flagship-Projects/Global-Energy-Assessment/Home-GEA.en.html Global Energy Assessment] - Toward a Sustainable Future, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK and New York, NY, USA and the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, Laxenburg, Austria.&lt;/ref&gt; The entire assessment is available online as a PDF.

The Water Futures and Solutions: World Water Scenarios initiative, launched in 2012, aims to provide a similarly broad assessment of global water challenges, in much the same scope as the Global Energy Assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/research/Global-Water-Futures-and-Solutions--World-Water-Scen.en.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140115120757/http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/research/Global-Water-Futures-and-Solutions--World-Water-Scen.en.html |archivedate=15 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

IIASA researchers are major contributors to Working Groups II and III of the [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/research/ResearchPartners/Climate-Change---IPCC-Fifth-Assessment-Report-.en.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2010, IIASA is also one of the three ''"pillar institutions"'' of the [[Wittgenstein Centre for Demography and Global Human Capital]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://derstandard.at/1295571237693/Ehrgeizig-Wiener-Wittgenstein-Center-will-an-Spitze-der-Demographie-Institute ''Der Standard'', 31 January 2011: “Vienna Wittgenstein Centre aims for top position among demography institutes worldwide”]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Social Survey Programme''' ('''ISSP''') is a collaboration between different nations conducting surveys covering topics which are useful for social science research. The ISSP researchers develop questions which are meaningful and relevant to all countries which can be expressed in an equal manner in different languages. The results of the surveys provide a cross-national and cross-cultural perspective to individual national studies. Through 2015 58 countries have participated in the ISSP.&lt;ref&gt;ISSP official Statement "About Us" http://issp.org/about-issp/&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The ISSP was founded in 1984&lt;ref&gt;ISSP Official Website http://issp.org/about-issp/history/&lt;/ref&gt; by research organizations from four countries:
* Zentrum für Umfragen, Methoden, und Analysen (ZUMA), [[Mannheim]], Germany. now [[GESIS – Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences]]
* [[National Opinion Research Center]] (NORC), [[University of Chicago]], [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], United States.
* Social and Community Planning Research (SCPR), [[London]], United Kingdom. now [http://natcen.ac.uk/ National Centre for Social Research, NatCen]
* Research School of Social Sciences (RSSS), [[Australian National University]], now [http://demography.anu.edu.au/ School of Demography] [[Canberra]], Australia.

Four different Social Surveys included a common module each year:
* The [[British Social Attitudes Survey]] (BSA) in the UK
* The [[General Social Survey]] (GSS) in the USA
* The [[ALLBUS]] or [[German General Social Survey]] (GGSS) in Germany and 
* The Surveys by the Research School of Social Sciences

Ever since social science institutions from 58 different countries included a 15 minute supplement to their national surveys. The membership to the ISSP is institutional and by country. One or more than one institute in a country can co-operate on ISSP research (cf. France and Spain). The common module surveyed by the member institutions also contains an extensive common core of background varibales. The modules focus on one specific topic each year and were planned to be repeated more or less every five to ten years. When it comes to the researchers choice of topics, the relevance of the area of social sciences in the year of the survey is taken into account.
Given this, the ISSP deliveres data sets helpful for both [[Cross-sectional studies]] and [[Time series analysis]].
Over time the set of modules has grown towards more diverse topics. The latest additions were Leisure and Sports in 2007 as well as Health and Health Care in 2011.

== Organisation ==
The ISSP is a self-funding organisation with an emphasis on democratic decision making stated in its working principles. To accomplish this principle it has set up several groups and committees. These groups either consist of member organizations as a whole or include some particualr social scientists. There are:
* The ISSP secretariat (2015-2018): GESIS-Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences, Germany
* The ISSP archive (collaboration between Spain and Germany)
* Methodology research groups
* The ISSP sub-groups drawn up within the ISSP
* Drafting groups for modules
* The ISSP Standing Committee
Most of the members of these groups are elected democratically at the '''General Assembly.''' These meetings of delegates from every member state of the ISSP are held in May or June in changing locations all around the world. The General Assemblies also serve the function of discussing modules, which are to be completed the same year or begun and surveyed the upcoming one. The delegates also discuss the topics of upcoming modules.

The ISSP also gives importance to the way member organisation implement their surveys. The organisation´s principles are published in its [http://issp.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Rules_and_regulations/ethical_statement_issp.pdf ethical statement] and its [http://issp.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Rules_and_regulations/ISSP_WP_FINAL_2018.pdf working principles].

== Methodology ==
The methodological work in the ISSP is coordinated by a '''Methodology Committee''', consisting of seven members elected at the '''General Meeting'''. It co-ordinates the work of six groups addressing different areas of '''cross-cultural methods''', all concerned with issues of equivalence: demography, non-response, weighting, mode effects, questionnaire design and translation.

== Modules by Year &lt;ref&gt;GESIS ISSP Modules by Year http://www.gesis.org/issp/modules/issp-modules-by-year/&lt;/ref&gt;==
The datasets from the different modules conducted by participating ISSP member states can be downloaded at the GESIS Archive page.&lt;ref&gt;GESIS Archive http://www.gesis.org/issp/modules/&lt;/ref&gt; All these links lead to the official [[GESIS – Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences]] homepage, where the data is provided openly for research purposes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1681">:''This article refers to a research station and botanical gardens in Costa Rica.  For the gardens in Australia, see [[Wilson Botanic Park]].''

The '''Las Cruces Biological Station / Wilson Botanical Garden''' is located in the southern [[Puntarenas]] [[province]] of [[Costa Rica]],  and is the newest of the three [[research station]]s operated by the [[Organization for Tropical Studies]] (OTS).  Las Cruces includes a biological research station, tourist facilities, and the botanical gardens started by Robert and Catherine Wilson, and bequeathed to OTS.&lt;ref name="CRG"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wilson Botanical Gardens from CostaRicaGuide.com|url=http://costa-rica-guide.com/parks/wilson.htm|accessdate=2007-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Heliconia hirsuta 1zz.jpg|thumb|A ''Heliconia hirsuta'' in the botanical garden of the station]]

Las Cruces is located in a mountainous region at an elevation of approximately 1,000 [[meters above sea level]] (m.a.s.l.).  Surrounded mostly by [[pastures]], [[Coffee_in_the_global_economy#Coffee_and_the_environment|coffee plantation]]s and other [[Farmland (farming)|agricultural areas]], Las Cruces includes a relatively small 270 Ha [[forest fragmentation|forest fragment]] that ranges from 900–1300 m.a.s.l.  As such, much of the research conducted here focuses on [[agroecology]] or studies of [[forest fragmentation]].

'''Lionel Bailey Budden''' [[FRIBA]] (1887, [[West Derby]], [[Liverpool]]&lt;ref&gt;http://search.findmypast.co.uk/results/world-records/england-and-wales-births-1837-2006?firstname=lionel&amp;lastname=budden&amp;eventyear=1887&amp;eventyear_offset=0&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; 21 July 1956, [[Wirral Peninsula]], [[Cheshire]]&lt;ref&gt;http://search.findmypast.co.uk/results/world-records/england-and-wales-deaths-1837-2007?firstname=lionel%20b&amp;lastname=budden&amp;yearofbirth=1887&amp;yearofbirth_offset=2&lt;/ref&gt;) was an English architect.

Born to William Budden and Elizabeth Adams, Budden attended [[Merchant Taylors' School, Crosby]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parksandgardens.ac.uk/component/option,com_parksandgardens/task,person/id,229/Itemid,/ Parks &amp; Gardens UK] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106103810/http://www.parksandgardens.ac.uk/component/option%2Ccom_parksandgardens/task%2Cperson/id%2C229/Itemid%2C |date= 6 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1933 Budden was [[Roscoe Professor in Architecture]] in the [[Liverpool University School of Architecture]]. He retired in 1952.

He had entered the School in 1905, graduated BA in 1909 and MA in 1910, taught there from 1911 and became Associate Professor in 1924. It was while he was Associate Professor that he contributed the article on [[Architectural education in the United Kingdom (19c-20c)|Architectural Education]] to the fourteenth edition of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' (1929).

He had been University of Liverpool travelling Scholar in Architecture in 1909, and a student at the [[British School at Athens]] 1909-1912.  He was first an Associate of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (ARIBA), later becoming a Fellow (FRIBA).
His architectural work included [[Birkenhead War Memorial]] and [[Liverpool Cenotaph]]; Liverpool Veterinary Hospital and extensions to Liverpool University Students’ Union.

He had married in 1921, and had one son and one daughter.

For his ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' article, published shortly before the passing of the [[Architects (Registration) Acts, 1931 to 1938|Architects (Registration) Act, 1931]] see: [[Architectural education in the United Kingdom (19c-20c)]]. His School, Liverpool, was one of those listed in the Act for the purpose of constituting the statutory [[Board of Architectural Education]].

[[Image:Ole Bull's villa entrance stairs.jpg|thumb|Villa Lysøen entrance stairs]]

'''Lysøen''' is an island in the municipality of [[Os, Hordaland|Os]], [[Hordaland]], [[Norway]]. 
Lysøen is also the site of '''Villa Lysøen''' (''Ole Bulls villa på Lysøen''), the home of Norwegian violin-virtuoso and composer [[Ole Bull]] until his death in 1880.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bergen-guide.com/55.htm ''Lysoen Island and Ole Bull's Villa'' (Bergen Guide)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Villa Lysøen==
The island was originally the site of a farm established around 1670. The island was bought by Ole Bull in 1872 who constructed the villa. Ole Bull drew the plans for the villa himself, under the supervision of renowned Norwegian architect [[Conrad Fredrik von der Lippe]] (1833–1901).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snl.no/Conrad_Fredrik_von_der_Lippe  ''Conrad Fredrik von der Lippe'' (Store norske leksikon)]&lt;/ref&gt; Ole Bull had a large villa built on the island, inspired by numerous architectural styles, including the [[Swiss chalet style]] and [[Moors|Moorish]] architecture. It has a tower formed as an [[onion dome]], common in Russian architecture, and many wooden carvings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snl.no/Lys%C3%B8en ''Lysøen'' (Store norske leksikon)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ole Bull transformed his {{convert|175|acre|km2|adj=on}} island property into a fairy-tale kingdom by having romantic paths, ponds and [[gazebo]]s made by planting exotic trees and bushes in the native pine forest. The island has 13&amp;nbsp;km of walkways and paths. His second wife Sara Chapman Thorp (1850–1911) accompanied him to their summer villa on Lysøen.

The highest point on the island, 76 meters above sea level, is the site of a lookout tower which was built in 1903 by Ole Bull's [[United States|American]] descendants. In 1974, Bull's granddaughter Sylvea Bull Curtis of [[Connecticut]] donated the island to the [[Society for the Preservation of Ancient Norwegian Monuments]]. Lysøen granted status as a museum in 1984 and has since been open to the public. Guided tours are conducted from early May to August.  The villa serves as a museum in the summer and is used for concerts during the annual [[Bergen International Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fortidsminneforeningen-hordaland.no/lysoen.htm ''Museet Lysøen'' (Lysøen i Lysefjorden)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724181026/http://www.fortidsminneforeningen-hordaland.no/lysoen.htm |date=2011-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Magnet fishing''', also called '''magnetic fishing''', is searching in outdoor waters for [[Ferromagnetism|Ferromagnetic]] objects available to pull with a strong [[neodymium magnet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Magnet Fishing|url=https://www.kjmagnetics.com/blog.asp?p=magnet-fishing|website=K&amp;J Magnetics|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hobby has been adopted by celebrities such as [[James Haskell]], the English rugby player.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://magnetstore.co.uk/james-haskell-fishing-magnet/|title=Magnet Store Blog|last=|first=|date=2018-02-12|website=Magnet Store|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[hobby]] is a combination of [[environmentalism]] and [[treasure hunting]]. The magnets used are strong enough to remove large [[debris]] such as discarded [[bicycle]]s, guns, safes, bombs, coins and car [[tire]] [[Rim (wheel)|rims]] from [[body of water|bodies of water]], but many who engage in the hobby are hoping to find rare and valuable items as well. 

It is thought magnet fishing was initially started by boaters using magnets to recover fallen keys from the water.&lt;ref name="Elliott"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Elliott |first1=Coran |title=Safety warning as rise in magnet fishing hobby sees anglers fish out guns and grenades in UK rivers |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/08/18/safety-warning-rise-magnet-fishing-hobby-sees-anglers-fish-guns/ |accessdate=23 August 2018 |work=The Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited |date=18 August 2018 |archiveurl=https://i.imgur.com/SskJfIT.png |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today magnet retrieval tools are specially designed to retrieve items that are lost at the bottom of bodies of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Go Fishing With Magnets|url=https://www.apexmagnets.com/news-how-tos/how-to-go-fishing-with-magnets/|website=Apex Magnets|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two main types of magnets. These are double sided and single sided magnets.  

People who engage in the hobby may be referred to as "magnetfishers," "magneteers," "MF'ers" or "neodemons," (a play on neodymium).

There have been no major reports of magnetfishers failing to observe [[Land tenure|landowners]], local authority regulations concerning outdoor waters, or seeking permissions where appropriate.&lt;ref name="Magnet-Fishing Ultimate Guide"&gt;{{cite web|title=Is Magnet Fishing Illegal?|url=https://www.magnet-fishing.com/|website=Magnet-Fishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However it is illegal, and punishable by a ₤25 fine, to magnetfish, or remove any material from canal or inland navigation under the control of the [[Canal &amp; River Trust]] in [[England]] or [[Wales]], other than the [[Lee Navigation|Lee]] and [[Stort Navigation]], [[Gloucester and Sharpness Canal]], and [[River Severn#Navigation|River Severn Navigation]].&lt;ref name="Canal"&gt;{{cite web |title=General Canal Bye-laws |url=http://www.britishwaterways.co.uk/media/documents/foi/legal/BW_General_Canal_Bye-laws.pdf |website=British Waterways |publisher=British Waterways Board |accessdate=21 August 2018 |language=English |format=PDF |date=1965 |quote=41.

An example of this being A news report by ITV Central which included a video of a family recording an incident of one of their children pulling a sawn-off shotgun out of Titford Canal in Oldbury, West Midlands, on Sunday 26 August. They later rang the police and the gun was removed and taken for analysis.  &lt;ref name="Elliott"/&gt;  The Trust refrains from legal action for first-time offenders.&lt;ref name="Elliott"/&gt;

[[Amateur]] magnetfishers in [[Belgium]] helped the [[police]] by recovering new evidence, specifically [[firearm]]s and [[ammunition]], related to the [[crime]]s of the [[Brabant killers]].&lt;ref name="Bende van Nijvel"&gt;{{cite news|author1=&lt;!-- Not stated --&gt;|title='Magneetvissers' bezorgen dozen met munitie en wapens aan speurders Bende van Nijvel|url=https://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20171026_03154116|accessdate=27 October 2017|work=De Standaard|agency=Raad voor de journalistiek|publisher=Nieuwsblad.be|date=26 October 2017|location=Antwerp, Belgium|language=Dutch|format=HTML}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{masculism sidebar}}
'''Masculism''' or '''masculinism''' may variously refer to advocacy of the rights or needs of [[Man|men]] and [[boy]]s; and the adherence to or promotion of attributes (opinions, values, attitudes, habits) regarded as typical of men and boys.&lt;ref name="BunninYu2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Honderich1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Christensen|first=Ferrell|editor=Ted Honderich|title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ii8AAAAIAAJ|year=1995|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-866132-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=reason&gt;{{cite news|publisher=''[[Reason magazine|Reason]]''|title=Man Troubles: Making Sense of the Men's Movement|author=[[Cathy Young]]|date=July 1994|url=http://reason.com/archives/1994/07/01/man-troubles|quote=Masculism (mas'kye liz*'em), n. 1. the belief that equality between the sexes requires the recognition and redress of prejudice and discrimination against men as well as women. 2. the movement organized around this belief. References Warren Farrell, Jack Kammer, and others activists in the men's movement.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Definition and scope==
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (OED) defines ''masculism'', or synonymously ''masculinism'', as the "advocacy of the rights of men; adherence to or promotion of opinions, values, etc., regarded as typical of men; (more generally) anti-feminism, machismo."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=masculism, n|work=Oxford English Dictionary Online|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|edition=3rd |year=2000|accessdate=2015-02-17|quote=masculism, n. †1. The possession of masculine physical traits by a woman. Obs. rare. 2. = masculinism n.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oedMasculinism"&gt;{{cite web|title=masculinism, n|work=Oxford English Dictionary Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|edition=3rd |year=2000|accessdate=2015-02-17|quote=masculinism, n. Advocacy of the rights of men; adherence to or promotion of opinions, values, etc., regarded as typical of men; (more generally) anti-feminism, machismo.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, philosopher Ferrell Christensen differentiates "masculism" from "masculinism", defining the latter as promoting the attributes of manliness.&lt;ref name="Honderich1995"/&gt; 
Political scientist Georgia Duerst-Lahti also distinguishes the two terms, with masculism expressing the ethos of the early gender-egalitarian [[men's movement]], while masculinism refers to the ideology of [[patriarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Duerst-Lahti | first = Georgia | contribution = Gender Ideology: masculinism and femininalism |pages=159&amp;ndash;192 |editor1-last=Goertz |editor1-first=Gary |editor2-last=Mazur |editor2-first=Amy G. |title=Politics, gender, and concepts: theory and methodology |year=2008 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521723428}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dupuis-Déri2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dupuis-Déri|first1=Francis|title=Le " masculinisme ": une histoire politique du mot (en Anglais et en Français)| trans-title = “Masculinism”: a political history of the term (in English and French) |journal=Recherches Féministes |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=97&amp;ndash;123 |url =https://doi.org/10.7202/039213ar |date=2009 |doi=10.7202/039213ar | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christensen differentiates between "progressive masculism" and an "extremist version". The former welcomes many of the societal changes promoted by feminists, while believing that some measures reducing sexism against women have increased it against men.&lt;ref name="Honderich1995"/&gt; Nicholas Davidson, in his book ''The Failure of Feminism'', describes an extremist version of masculism which he termed "virism": "What ails society is 'effeminacy'. The improvement of society requires that the influence of female values be decreased and the influence of male values increased…."&lt;ref name="Honderich1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Davidson1988"&gt;Christensen, Ferrell (2005), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WbkSDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA562 Masculism]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Honderich | editor-first = Ted | title = The Oxford companion to philosophy |pages=562&amp;ndash;563 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | isbn = 9780199264797 }}

[[Gender theory|Gender theories]], which have frequently focused on woman-based or feminist approaches, have come to examine oppression in a masculist society also from the perspectives of men, many of whom are also subjected by that society.&lt;ref name="HoogensenSolheim2006"&gt;Hoogensen, Gunhild; Solheim, Bruce Olav (2006), "[https://books.google.com/?id=ZPThCTMVsZQC&amp;pg=PA21 Women in theory and practice]", in {{cite book | editor-last1 = Hoogensen | editor-first1 = Gunhild | editor-last2 = Solheim | editor-first2 = Bruce Olav |title=Women in power: world leaders since 1960|year=2006|page=21|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780275981907}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a feminist perspective to philosophy, masculinism seeks to value and include only male views, and claim "that anything that cannot be reduced or translated in men's experience should be excluded from the subject-matter of philosophy.&lt;ref name="BunninYu2008"/&gt;

==Topic areas of interest==
{{main|Men's rights movement}}

===Education and employment===
Many masculists oppose co-educational schooling, believing that single-sex schools better promote the well-being of boys.&lt;ref name="Blais, Melissa 2012"&gt;
{{cite journal | last1 = Blais | first1 = Melissa | last2 = Dupuis-Déri | first2 = Francis | title = Masculinism and the antifeminist countermovement | journal = [[Social Movement Studies|Social Movement Studies: Journal of Social, Cultural and Political Protest]] | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 21&amp;ndash;39 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/14742837.2012.640532 | date = 2012 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14742837.2012.640532 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other masculists and [[Equity feminism|equity feminists]] say that boys lag behind girls in educational achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sommers |first1=Christina | author-link = Christina Hoff Sommers|title=The war against boys|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2000/05/the-war-against-boys/304659/|work= [[The Atlantic]] | date = May 2000 |accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data from the U.S. in 1994 reported that men suffer 94% of workplace fatalities. Masculist [[Warren Farrell]] has argued that men do a disproportionate share of dirty, physically demanding, and hazardous jobs.&lt;ref name=reason/&gt;

===Violence and suicide===
{{Violence against men}}
{{See also|Violence against men}}

Masculists cite higher rates of suicide in men than women.&lt;ref name="Blais, Melissa 2012"/&gt; Masculists express concern about violence against men being depicted as humorous, in the media and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=MYTH&gt;{{cite book | last = Farrell | first = Warren | author-link = Warren Farrell | title = [[The Myth of Male Power|The myth of male power: why men are the disposable sex]] | publisher = [[Berkley Books]] | location = New York | year = 2001 | isbn = 9780425181447 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They also express concern about violence against men being ignored or minimized in comparison to violence against women,&lt;ref name="Blais, Melissa 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Mvulane | first = Zama | title = Do men suffer spousal abuse? | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090221033948/http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?click_id=13&amp;art_id=vn20081125064002133C731559&amp;set_id= | archive-date = February 21, 2009 | url = http://www.iol.co.za:80/index.php?click_id=13&amp;art_id=vn20081125064002133C731559&amp;set_id= | work = [[Cape Times]] | via = [[Independent Online (South Africa)|IOL]] | location = South Africa | page = 12 | date = November 25, 2008 | deadurl = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; some asserting gender symmetry in [[domestic violence]].&lt;ref name="Blais, Melissa 2012"/&gt; Another of their concerns is that traditional assumptions of female innocence or sympathy for women, termed [[benevolent sexism]], may lead to unequal penalties for women and men who commit similar crimes,&lt;ref name="MYTH" /&gt; to lack of sympathy for male victims in [[domestic violence]] cases, and to dismissal of female-on-male [[sexual assault]] and [[sexual harassment]] cases.

===Custody===
{{main|Fathers' rights movement}}
According to [[David Benatar]], head of philosophy at the [[University of Cape Town]], "Custody law is perhaps the best-known area of men's rights activism", as it is more likely in most parts of the world for the mother to obtain custody of children in case of divorce. He argues: "When the man is the primary care-giver his chances of winning custody are lower than when the woman is the primary care-giver. Even when the case is not contested by the mother, he's still not as likely to get custody as when the woman's claim is uncontested".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = de Castella | first = Tom | title = Just who are men's rights activists? | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17907534 | work = [[BBC News Online#Features|BBC News Magazine]] | date = May 2, 2012 | access-date = May 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== South African masculist evangelical movements ==
In the wake of the abolition of apartheid, South Africa has seen a resurgence of masculist Christian evangelical groups, led by two complementary men's and women's movements, the Mighty Men movement and the Worthy Women movement.&lt;ref name="Nadar_Potgieter"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nadar | first1 = Sarojini | last2 = Potgieter | first2 = Cheryl | title = Liberated through submission?: The Worthy Woman's Conference as a case study of for''men''ism | journal = Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion | volume = 26 | issue = 2 | pages = 141&amp;ndash;151 | publisher = [[Project MUSE]] | date = Fall 2010 | url = https://muse.jhu.edu/article/394797 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mighty Men movement harkens back to the Victorian idea of Muscular Christianity&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dube | first = Siphiwe | title = Muscular Christianity in contemporary South Africa: The case of the Mighty Men Conference | journal = HTS [[Theological Studies/Teologiese Studies]] | volume = 71 | issue = 3 | pages = 1&amp;ndash;9 | publisher = AOSIS OpenJournals | date = July 2015 | url = https://hts.org.za/index.php/HTS/article/view/2945/html | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the movement does not lead discussions about institutionalized racism.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dube | first = Siphiwe | title = Race, whiteness and transformation in the Promise Keepers America and the Mighty Men Conference: A comparative analysis | journal = HTS [[Theological Studies/Teologiese Studies]] | volume = 72 | issue = 1 | pages = 1&amp;ndash;8 | publisher = AOSIS OpenJournals | date = November 2016 | url = http://www.hts.org.za/index.php/HTS/article/view/3476/html | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist scholars argue that the movement's lack of attention to women's rights and their historical struggle with racial equality makes it a threat to women and to the stability of the country.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Scholar Miranda Pillay argues that the Mighty Men movement appeal lies in its resistance to gender equality as incompatible with Christian values, and in raising patriarchy to a "hyper-normative status," beyond challenge by other claims to power.&lt;ref&gt;Pillay, Miranda (2015), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yMTSCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA61 Mighty Men, Mighty Families: A pro-family Christian movement to (re)enforce patriarchal control?]", in {{cite book | editor-last1 = Conradie | editor-first1 = Ernst M. | editor-last2=Pillay| editor-first2=Miranda| title = Ecclesial reform and deform movements in the South African context | pages = 61&amp;ndash;77 | publisher = African SUN MeDIA | location = Stellenbosch, South Africa | isbn = 9781920689766}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Worthy Women movement is a women's auxiliary to Mighty Men in advocating ''men''ism, a belief in the inherent superiority of men over women.&lt;ref name="Nadar_Potgieter" /&gt; Their leader is Gretha Wiid. She blames South Africa's disorder on the liberation of women, and aims to restore the nation through its families, making women again subservient to their men.&lt;ref&gt;Nortjé-Meyer, Lilly (2015), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yMTSCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA86 A movement seeking to embody support of patriarchal structures and patterns in church and society: Gertha Wiid's Worthy Women movement]", in {{cite book | editor-last1 = Conradie | editor-first1 = Ernst M. | editor-last2=Pillay| editor-first2=Miranda| title = Ecclesial reform and deform movements in the South African context | pages = 86&amp;ndash;93 | publisher = African SUN MeDIA | location = Stellenbosch, South Africa | isbn = 9781920689766}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her success is attributed to her balancing claims that God created the gender hierarchy, but that women are no less valuable than men,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Nortjé-Meyer | first = Lilly | title = A critical analysis of Gretha Wiid’s sex ideology and her biblical hermeneutics | journal = Verbum et Ecclesia | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages = 1&amp;ndash;7 | publisher = AOSIS OpenJournals | date = November 2011 | url = http://verbumetecclesia.org.za/index.php/VE/article/view/472/html | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that restoration of traditional gender roles relieves existential anxiety in post-apartheid South Africa.&lt;ref name="Nadar_Potgieter"/&gt;

===Feminism===
Some masculinists have been described as explicitly antifeminist by feminist activists.&lt;ref name="Blais, Melissa 2012"/&gt; According to Blais and Dupuis-Déri, "the contents of [masculinist] websites and the testimony of feminists that we questioned confirm that masculinists are generally critical of even moderate feminists and feminists at the head of official feminist organizations."&lt;ref name="Blais, Melissa 2012"/&gt; Some masculinist activism has involved disruption of events organized by feminists and lawsuits against feminist academics, journalists, or activists.&lt;ref name="Blais, Melissa 2012"/&gt; Furthermore, masculinist actions are sometimes extreme; father's rights activists have bombed family courts in Australia and have issued bomb threats in the UK, although it is ambiguous whether there was public and organized militant group involvement.&lt;ref name="Blais, Melissa 2012"/&gt; They have also engaged in "tire-slashing, the mailing of excrement-filled packages, threats against politicians and their children."&lt;ref name="Blais, Melissa 2012"/&gt; Spokesmen for these groups have also spoken out against public awareness campaigns to prevent sexual assault, arguing that they portray a negative image of men, and one masculinist group harassed administrators of dozens of battered women's shelters and women's centers.&lt;ref name="Blais, Melissa 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Martin | first1 = Janet M. | last2 = Borrelli | first2 = Maryanne | title = The other elites: Women, politics, and power in the Executive Branch | publisher = Lynne Rienner Publishers | location = Boulder, Colorado | year = 2001 | isbn = 9781555879716 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Philosopher Ferrell Christensen states that if masculism and feminism refer to the belief that men/women are systematically discriminated against, and that this discrimination should be eliminated, there is not necessarily a conflict between feminism and masculism, and some assert that they are both.&lt;ref name="Honderich1995"/&gt; However, many believe that one sex is more discriminated against, and thus use one label and reject the other.&lt;ref name="Honderich1995"/&gt;

'''Moral Development''' focuses on the emergence, change, and understanding of [[morality]] from infancy through adulthood. Morality develops across a lifetime and is influenced by an individual's experiences and their behavior when faced with moral issues through different periods' physical and cognitive development. In short, morality concerns an individual's growing sense of what is right and wrong; it is for this reason that young children have different moral judgement and character than that of a grown adult. Morality in itself is often a synonym for "rightness" or "goodness". It refers to a certain code of conduct that is derived from one's culture, religion or personal philosophy that guides one's actions, behaviors and thoughts.  

Notions of morality development have been developed over centuries, the earliest came from philosophers like [[Confucius]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], who all took a more humanist perspective and focused on the development of the conscience and sense of virtue. In the modern day, empirical research has explored morality through a moral psychology lens by theorists like [[Sigmund Freud]] and its relation to cognitive development by theorists like [[Jean Piaget]], [[Lawrence Kohlberg]], [[B. F. Skinner]], [[Carol Gilligan]] and Judith Smetana.  

The interest in morality spans many disciplines (e.g., [[philosophy]], [[economics]], [[biology]], and [[political science]]) and specializations within psychology (e.g., [[Social psychology|social]], [[Cognitive psychology|cognitive]], and [[Cultural psychology|cultural]]). In order to investigate how individuals understand morality, it is essential to consider their beliefs, emotions, attitudes, and behaviors that contribute to their moral understanding. Additionally, researchers in the field of moral development consider the role of peers and parents in facilitating moral development, the role of conscience and values, socialization and cultural influences, empathy and altruism, and positive development, in order to understand what factors impact morality of an individual more completely.

==Historical background and foundational theories ==
[[File:Confuscious Down Under (5022724040).jpg|thumb|

'''Freud: Morality and the Superego:''' The founder of psychoanalysis, [[Sigmund Freud]], proposed the existence of a tension between the needs of society and the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Sagan, Eli. ''Freud, Women, and Morality: The Psychology of Good and Evil''. New York: Basic Books, 1988. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Freud, moral development proceeds when the individual's selfish desires are repressed and replaced by the values of important socializing agents in one's life (for instance, one's parents).

'''B.F. Skinner's Behavioral Theory:''' A proponent of behaviorism, [[B. F. Skinner|B.F. Skinner]] similarly focused on socialization as the primary force behind moral development&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Driscoll, Marcy Perkins. ''Psychology of Learning for Instruction''. Pearson, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;. In contrast to Freud's notion of a struggle between internal and external forces, Skinner focused on the power of external forces (reinforcement contingencies) to shape an individual's development.

'''Piaget's Theory of Moral Development''' : While both Freud and Skinner focused on the external forces that bear on morality (parents in the case of Freud, and behavioral contingencies in the case of Skinner), [[Jean Piaget]] (1965) focused on the individual's construction, construal, and interpretation of morality from a social-cognitive and social-emotional perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Piaget, Jean, Ved P. Varma, and Phillip Williams. ''Piaget, Psychology and Education: Papers in Honour of Jean Piaget''. London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1976. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;To understand adult morality, Piaget believed that it was necessary to study both how morality manifests in the child's world as well as the factors that contribute to the emergence of central moral concepts such as welfare, justice, and rights. Interviewing children using the Clinical Interview Method, Piaget (1965) found that young children were focused on authority mandates, and that with age children become autonomous, evaluating actions from a set of independent principles of morality. Piaget characterizes the development of morality of children through observing children while playing games to see if rules are followed.
[[File:Jean Piaget in Ann Arbor.png|thumb|212x212px|[[Jean Piaget]].]]

'''Social Domain Theory:''' Eliot Turiel  argued for a social domain approach to social cognition, delineating how individuals differentiate moral (fairness, equality, justice), societal (conventions, group functioning, traditions), and psychological (personal, individual prerogative) concepts from early in development throughout the lifespan&lt;ref&gt;Turiel, Elliot. ''The Culture of Morality: Social Development, Context, and Conflict''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002. Internet resource.&lt;/ref&gt;. Over the past 40 years, research findings have supported this model, demonstrating how children, adolescents, and adults differentiate moral rules from conventional rules, identify the personal domain as a nonregulated domain, and evaluate multifaceted (or complex) situations that involve more than one domain. This research has been conducted in a wide range of countries (Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Nigeria, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, U.K., U.S., Virgin Islands) and with rural and urban children, for low and high income communities, and traditional and modern cultures. Turiel's social domain theory showed that children were actually younger in developing moral standards than past psychologists predicted.

'''Kohlberg: Moral Reasoning'':''''' [[Lawrence Kohlberg]] was inspired by the works of [[Jean Piaget]] and [[John Dewey]].&lt;ref&gt;Kohlberg, Lawrence. ''The Philosophy of Moral Development: Moral Stages and the Idea of Justice''. San Francisco: Harper &amp; Row, 1981. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the past 20 years, researchers have expanded the field of moral development, applying moral judgment, reasoning, and emotion attribution to topics such as prejudice, aggression, theory of mind, emotions, empathy, peer relationships, and parent-child interactions. The Handbook of Moral Development (2006), edited by Melanie Killen and Judith Smetana, provides a wide range of information about these topics covered in moral development today.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Killen, M., &amp; Smetana, J.G. (Eds.) (2006). Handbook of moral development. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;One of the main objectives was to provide a sense of the current state of the field of moral development

==Cognition and intentionality==

A hallmark of moral understanding is intentionality which can be defined as an attribution of the target’s intentions towards another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Killen|first=Melanie|last2=Rizzo|first2=Michael T.|date=2014|title=Morality, Intentionality, and Intergroup Attitudes |journal=Behaviour|volume=151|issue=2–3|pages=337–359|doi=10.1163/1568539X-00003132 |pmc=4336952|pmid=25717199}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Five components make up people's concept of intentionality: an action is considered intentional if a personal has (a) a desire for an outcome, (b) a belief that the action will lead to the outcome, (c) an intention to perform the action, (d) skill to perform the action, and (e) awareness while performing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://research.clps.brown.edu/SocCogSci/Projects/intentionality.html|title=Intentionality {{!}} Malle Lab|website=research.clps.brown.edu|access-date=2018-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research on children's [[theory of mind]], ToM, has focused on when children understand others' intentions (Wellman &amp; Lui, 2004&lt;ref&gt;Wellman, H. M., &amp; Liu, D. (2004). Scaling of theory-of-mind tasks. ''Child Development'', 75, 502-517.&lt;/ref&gt;). The moral concept of one's intentionality develops with experience in the world. Yuill (1984) presented evidence that comprehension of one's intentions plays a role in moral judgment, even in young children.&lt;ref&gt;Yuill, N. (1984). Young children's coordination of motive and outcome in judgments of satisfaction and morality. British Journal of Developmental Psychology, 2, 73-81.&lt;/ref&gt; Killen, Mulvey, Richardson, Jampol, and [[Amanda Woodward|Woodward]] (2011) present evidence that with developing false belief competence (ToM), children are capable of using information about one’s intentions when making moral judgments about the acceptability of acts and punishments, recognizing that accidental transgressors, who do not hold negative intentions, should not be held accountable for negative outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Killen, M., Mulvey, K. L., Richardson, C., Jampol, N., &amp; Woodward, A. (2011). The accidental transgressor: Testing theory of mind and morality knowledge in young children. ''Cognition'', 119, 197-215.&lt;/ref&gt; In this study, children who lacked false belief competence were more likely to attribute blame to an accidental transgressor than children with demonstrated false belief competence. In addition to evidence from a social cognitive perspective, behavioral evidence suggests that even three-year-olds have the capacity to take into account a person's intention and apply this information when responding to situations. Vaish, Carpenter, and [[Michael Tomasello|Tomasello]] (2010), for instance, present evidence that three-year-olds are more willing to help a neutral or helpful person than a harmful person.&lt;ref&gt;Vaish, A., Carpenter, M., &amp; Tomasello, M. (2010). Young children selectively avoid helping people with harmful intentions. ''Child Development'', 81, 1661-1669.&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond the ability to identify one’s intentionality, mental state understanding plays a crucial role in identifying victimization. While obvious distress cues (e.g. crying) allow even three year olds to identify victims of harm (Zelazo, Helwig, &amp; Lau, 1996&lt;ref&gt;Zelazo, P. D., Helwig, C. C., &amp; Lau, A. (1996). Intention, act, and outcome in behavioral prediction and moral judgment. ''Child Development'', 67, 2478-2492.&lt;/ref&gt;), it is not until around six years of age that children are able to appreciate that a person may be an unwilling victim of harm even in the absence of obvious distress (Shaw &amp; Wainryb, 2006).&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, L. A., &amp; Wainryb, C. (2006). When victims don't cry: Children's understandings of victimization, compliance, and subversion. ''Child Development'', 77, 1050-1062.&lt;/ref&gt; In their study, Shaw and Wainryb (2006) discovered that children older than six interpret compliance, resistance, and subversion to illegitimate requests (e.g., clean my locker) from the perspective of a victim. That is, they judge that victims who resist illegitimate requests will feel better than victims who comply.

==Emotions==

Moral questions tend to be emotionally charged issues which evoke strong affective responses. Consequently, emotions likely play an important role in moral development. However, there is currently little consensus among theorists on how emotions influence moral development. [[Psychoanalytic theory]], founded by Freud, emphasizes the role of guilt in repressing primal drives. Research on [[prosocial behavior]] has focused on how emotions motivate individuals to engage in moral or altruistic acts. Social-cognitive development theories have recently begun to examine how emotions influence moral judgments. Intuitionist theorists assert that moral judgments can be reduced to immediate, instinctive emotional responses elicited by moral dilemmas.

Research on socioemotional development and prosocial development has identified several "moral emotions" which are believed to motivate moral behavior and influence moral development (Eisenberg, 2000 for a review).&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberg, N. (2000). Emotion, Regulation, and Moral Development. ''Annual Review of Psychology'', 51,665–697.&lt;/ref&gt; These moral emotions are said to be linked to moral development because they are evidence and reflective of an individual’s set of moral values, which must have undergone through the process of internalization in the first place (Kochanska &amp; Thompson, 1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kochanska|first=Grazyna|last2=Aksan|first2=Nazan|date=2006-12-01|title=Children's Conscience and Self-Regulation|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-6494.2006.00421.x|journal=Journal of Personality|language=en|volume=74|issue=6|pages=1587–1618|doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.2006.00421.x|issn=1467-6494}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manifestation of these moral emotions can occur at two separate timings: either before or after the execution of a moral or immoral act. A moral emotion that precedes an action is referred to as an anticipatory emotion, and a moral emotion that follows an action is referred to as a consequential emotion (Tangney, Stuewig, &amp; Mashek, 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tangney|first=June Price|last2=Stuewig|first2=Jeff|last3=Mashek|first3=Debra J.|date=2006-12-06|title=Moral Emotions and Moral Behavior|url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.psych.56.091103.070145|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|volume=58|issue=1|pages=345–372|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.56.091103.070145|issn=0066-4308|pmc=3083636}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary emotions consistently linked with moral development are [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[shame]], [[empathy]], and [[sympathy]]. Guilt has been defined as "an agitation-based emotion or painful feeling of regret that is aroused when the actor actually causes, anticipates causing, or is associated with an aversive event" (Fergusen &amp; Stegge, 1998).&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson T. J. &amp; Stegge H. (1998). Measuring guilt in children: a rose by any other name still has thorns. In Guilt and Children, ed. J Bybee, pp. 19–74. San Diego: Academic.&lt;/ref&gt; Shame is often used synonymously with guilt, but implies a more passive and dejected response to a perceived wrong. Guilt and shame are considered "self-conscious" emotions, because they are of primary importance to an individual's self-evaluation. Moreover, there exists a bigger difference between guilt and shame that goes beyond the type of feelings that they may provoke within an individual. This difference lies in the fact that these two moral emotions do not weigh the same in terms of their impact on moral behaviors. Studies on the effects of guilt and shame on moral behaviors has shown that guilt has a larger ability to dissuade an individual from making immoral choices whereas shame did not seem to have any deterring effect on immoral behaviors. However, it should be noted that different types of behaviors in different types of population, under different circumstances might not generate the same outcomes (Tangney, Stuewig, &amp; Mashek, 2007). In contrast to guilt and shame, empathy and sympathy are considered other-oriented moral emotions. Empathy is commonly defined as an affective response produced by the apprehension or comprehension of another's emotional state which mirrors the other's affective state. Similarly, sympathy is defined as an emotional response produced by the apprehension or comprehension of another's emotional state which does not mirror the other's affect, but instead causes one to express concern or sorrow for the other (Eisenberg, 2000).

The relation between moral action and moral emotions has been extensively researched. Very young children have been found to express feelings of care, and empathy towards others, showing concerns for other's well being (Eisenberg, Spinard, &amp; Sadovsky, 2006).&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberg, N., Spinard, T. L., &amp; Sadovsky, A. (2006). Empathy-related responding in children. In M. Killen &amp; J. G. Smetana (Eds.), Handbook of moral development (pp. 517-549). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; Research has consistently demonstrated that when empathy is induced in an individual, he or she is more likely to engage in subsequent prosocial behavior (Batson 1998;&lt;ref&gt;Batson, C.D. (1998). Altruism and prosocial behavior. In The Handbook of Social Psychology, ed. DT Gilbert, ST Fiske, G Lindzey, 2:282–316. Boston: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; Eisenberg, 200 for review). Additionally, other research has examined emotions of shame and guilt in relation to children's empathic and prosocial behavior (Zahn-Waxler &amp; Robinson, 1995).

While emotions serve as information for children in their interpretations about moral consequences of acts, the role of emotions in children's moral judgments has only recently been investigated. Some approaches to studying emotions in moral judgments come from the perspective that emotions are automatic intuitions that define morality (Greene, 2001;&lt;ref&gt;Greene, J. (2001). An fMRI Investigation of Emotional Engagement in Moral Judgment. ''Science'', 293 (5537), 2105-2108. {{doi|10.1126/science.1062872}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haidt, 2001&lt;ref&gt;Haidt, J. (2001). The emotional dog and its rational tail: A social intuitionist approach to moral judgment. ''Psychological Review'', 108, 814-834.&lt;/ref&gt;). Other approaches place emphasis on the role of emotions as evaluative feedback that help children interpret acts and consequences (Turiel &amp; Killen, 2010).&lt;ref&gt;Turiel, E., &amp; Killen, M. (2010). Taking emotions seriously: The role of emotions in moral development. In W. Arsenio &amp; E. Lemerise (Eds.), Emotions in aggression and moral development. (pp. 33-52). Washington, D.C.: APA.&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown children attribute different emotional outcomes to actors involved in moral transgressions than those involved in conventional transgressions (Arsenio, 1988,&lt;ref&gt;Arsenio, W. F. (1988). Children's conceptions of the situational affective consequences of sociomoral events. ''Child Development'', 59, 1611-1622.&lt;/ref&gt; Arsenio &amp; Fleiss, 1996&lt;ref&gt;Arsenio, W. F., &amp; Fleiss, K. (1996). Typical and behaviourally disruptive children's understanding of the emotional consequences of socio-moral events. British Journal of Developmental Psychology, 14, 173-186&lt;/ref&gt;). Emotions may help individuals prioritize among different information and possibilities and reduce information processing demands in order to narrow the scope of the reasoning process (Lemerise &amp; Arsenio, 2000).&lt;ref&gt;Lemerise, E., &amp; Arsenio, W. (2000). An integrated model of emotion processes and cognition in social information processing. ''Child Development'', 71, 107-118.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Malti, Gummerum, Keller, &amp; Buchmann, (2009) found individual differences in how children attribute emotions to victims and victimizers.&lt;ref&gt;Malti, T., Gummerum, M., Keller, M., &amp; Buchmann, M. (2009). Children's moral motivation, sympathy, and prosocial behavior. ''Child Development'', 80, 442-460.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of interpersonal, intergroup, and cultural influences==
Children's interactions and experiences with caregivers and peers have been shown to influence their development of moral understanding and behavior&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mentalhelp.net/articles/early-childhood-moral-development/|title=Early Childhood Moral Development|website=www.mentalhelp.net|access-date=2018-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;Researchers have addressed the influence of interpersonal interactions on children's moral development from two primary perspectives: Socialization/Internalization (Grusec &amp; Goodnow, 1994;&lt;ref&gt;Grusec, J. E., &amp; Goodnow, J. J. (1994). Impact of parental discipline methods on the child's internalization of values: A reconceptualization of current points of view. ''Developmental Psychology'', 30, 4-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Kochanska &amp; Askan, 1995;&lt;ref&gt;Kochanska, G., &amp; Aksan, N. (1995). Mother-child mutually positive affect, the quality of child compliance to requests and prohibitions, and maternal control as correlates of early internalization. ''Child Development'', 66, 236-254.&lt;/ref&gt; Kochanska, Askan, &amp; Koenig, 1995&lt;ref&gt;Kochanska, G., Aksan, N., &amp; Koenig, A. L. (1995).

Moral development and moral education: An overview.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Research from the social domain theory perspective focuses on how children actively distinguish moral from conventional behavior based in part on the responses of parents, teachers, and peers.&lt;ref&gt;Smetana, J. G. (1997). Parenting and the development of social knowledge reconceptualized: A social domain analysis. In J. E. Grusec &amp; L. Kuczynski (Eds.), Parenting and the internalization of values (pp. 162-192). New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Social domain suggests that there are different areas of reasoning co-existing in development those include societal (concerns about conventions and grouping), moral (fairness, justice and rights) and psychological (concerns with personal goals and identity).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Turiel|first=E|date=2007|chapter=The Development of Morality |editors=W. Damon, R. M. Lerner and N. Eisenberg|url=|title=Handbook of Child Psychology|volume=3|edition=6th|doi=10.1002/9780470147658.chpsy0313 |isbn=9780471272878}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adults tend to respond to children's moral transgressions (e.g. hitting or stealing) by drawing the child's attention to the effect of his or her action on others, and doing so consistently across various contexts. In contrast, adults are more likely to respond to children's conventional misdeeds (e.g. wearing a hat in the classroom, eating spaghetti with fingers) by reminding children about specific rules and doing so only in certain contexts (e.g. at school but not at home).&lt;ref name=Smetana1984&gt;Smetana, J. G. (1984). Toddlers' social interactions regarding moral and conventional transgressions. ''Child Development'', 55, 1767-1776.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smetana, J. G. (1985). Preschool children's conceptions of transgressions: Effects of varying moral and conventional domain-related attributes. ''Developmental Psychology'', 21, 18-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Peers respond mainly to moral but not conventional transgressions and demonstrate emotional distress (e.g. crying or yelling) when they are the victim of moral but unconventional transgressions.&lt;ref name=Smetana1984/&gt; 

Research from a socialization/internalization perspective focuses on the ways in which adults pass down standards or rules of behavior to children through parenting techniques and why children do or do not internalize those values (Grusec &amp; Goodnow, 1994; Kochanska &amp; Askan, 1995). From this perspective, moral development involves children's increasing compliance with and internalization of adult rules, requests, and standards of behavior. Using these definitions, researchers find that parenting behaviors vary in the extent to which they encourage children's internalization of values, and that these effects depend partially on a child attributes, such as age and [[temperament]] (Grusec &amp; Goodnow, 1994). For instance, Kochanska (1997) showed that gentle parental discipline best promotes conscience development in temperamentally fearful children but that parental responsiveness and a mutually responsive parent-child orientation best promote conscience development in temperamentally fearless children.&lt;ref&gt;Kochanska, G. (1997). Multiple pathways to conscience for children with different temperaments: From toddlerhood to age 5. ''Developmental Psychology'', 33, 228-240.&lt;/ref&gt; These parental influences exert their effects through multiple pathways, including increasing children's experience of moral emotions (e.g. guilt, empathy) and their self-identification as moral individuals (Kochanska, 2010&lt;ref&gt;Kochanska, G., Koenig, J. L., Barry, R. A., Kim, S., &amp; Yoon, J. E. (2010). Children's conscience during toddler and preschool years, moral self, and a competent, adaptive developmental trajectory. ''Developmental Psychology'', 46, 1320-1332&lt;/ref&gt;). Development can be divided up to multiple stages however the first few years of development is usually seen to be formed by 5 years of age. According to Freud's research, relationships between a child and parents early on usually provides the basis forth personality development as well as the formation of morality. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Freud|first=S|date=1930-1961|title=Civilization and its Discontents|url=|location=New York, NY|volume=|pages=|publisher=W. W. Norton.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers interested in intergroup attitudes and behavior related to ones moral development have approached the study of [[stereotypes]], [[prejudice]] and [[discrimination]] in children and adolescents from several theoretical perspectives. Some, however not limited to are of these theoretical frameworks: Cognitive Development Theory (Aboud, 1988);&lt;ref&gt;Aboud, F. E. (1988). Children and prejudice. Oxford, England: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; Social Domain Theory (Killen &amp; Rutland, 2011;&lt;ref&gt;Killen, M., &amp; Rutland, A. (2011). Children and social exclusion: Morality, prejudice, and group identity. NY: Wiley/Blackwell Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Killen, Sinno, &amp; Margie, 2007&lt;ref&gt;Killen, M., Sinno, S., &amp; Margie, N. G. (2007). Children's experiences and judgments about group exclusion and inclusion. In R. V. Kail (Ed.), Advances in child development and behavior (pp. 173-218).

A developmental intergroup theory of social stereotypes and prejudice. In R. Kail (Ed.), Advances in child psychology (pp. 39-90). New York: Elsevier&lt;/ref&gt; Subjective Group Dynamics (Abrams, Rutland, &amp; Cameron, 2003;&lt;ref&gt;Abrams, D., Rutland, A., Cameron, L., &amp; Marques, J. (2003). The development of subjective group dynamics: When in-group bias gets specific. British Journal of Developmental Psychology, 21, 155-176&lt;/ref&gt; Rutland, Killen, &amp; Abrams, 2010&lt;ref&gt;Rutland, A., Killen, M., &amp; Abrams, D. (2010). A new social-cognitive developmental perspective on prejudice: The interplay between morality and group identity. ''Perspectives on Psychological Science'', 5, 280-291.&lt;/ref&gt;); Implicit Theories (Levy, Chiu, &amp; Hong, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Levy, S. R., Chiu, C. Y., &amp; Hong, Y. Y. (2006). Lay theories and intergroup relations. Group Processes and Intergroup Relations., 9, 5-24&lt;/ref&gt; and Intergroup-contact Theory (Pettigrew &amp; Tropp, 2008).&lt;ref&gt;Pettigrew, T. F., &amp; Tropp, L. R. (2008). How does intergroup contact reduce prejudice? Meta-analytic tests of three mediators. ''European Journal of Social Psychology'', 38, 922-934. {{doi|10.1002/ejsp.504}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plethora of research approaches is not surprising given the multitude of variables, (e.g. group identity, group status, group threat, group [[Norm (social)|norms]], [[Contact hypothesis|intergroup contact]], individual beliefs and context) that need to be considered when assessing children's intergroup attitudes. While most of this research has investigated two-dimensional relationships between each of the three components: stereotypes, prejudice and discrimination (e.g., role of stereotypes in intergroup prejudice, use of stereotypes to reason about intergroup discrimination, how prejudices manifest into discrimination), very few have addressed all three aspects of intergroup attitudes and behaviors together (McKown, 2004).&lt;ref&gt;McKown, C. (2004). Age and ethnic variation in children's thinking about the nature of racism. Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology, 25, 597-617. {{doi|10.1016/j.appdev.2004.08.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In developmental intergroup research, stereotypes are defined as judgments made about an individual's attributes based on group membership (Killen, Margie, &amp; Sinno, 2006;&lt;ref&gt;Killen, M., Margie, N. G., &amp; Sinno, S. (2006). Morality in the context of intergroup relationships. In M. Killen &amp; J. G. Smetana (Eds.), Handbook of moral development (pp. 155-183). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; Killen et al., 2007). These judgments are more complex than regular judgments as they require one to recognize and understand (eg. gender, race, religion, culture, nationality, ethnicity) which group one individual belongs to as they might be treated differently delliberately because of the group they are associated with.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Social psychologists focus on stereotypes as a cognitive component influencing intergroup behaviors and tend to define them as being fixed concepts associated with a category (Allport, 1954).&lt;ref&gt;Allport, G. W. (1954). The nature of prejudice. Reading, MA: Addison Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt; Prejudice, on the other hand is defined in terms of negative attitudes or affective expressions toward a whole group or members of a group (Stangor, 2009).&lt;ref&gt;Stangor, C. (2009). The study of stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination within social psychology: A quick history of theory and research. In T. D. Nelson (Ed.), Handbook of prejudice, stereotyping, and discrimination. (pp. 1-22). New York, NY US: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Negative stereotypes and prejudices can manifest into discrimination towards an outgroup and for children and adolescents, this may come in the form of exclusion from peer groups as well as the wider community (Killen &amp; Rutland, 2011). Such actions can negatively impact a child in the long term in the sense of weakening ones confidence, self esteem as well personal identity. 

One explicit manner in which societies can socialize individuals is through moral education. Solomon and colleagues (1988) present evidence from a study that integrated both direct instruction and guided reflection approaches to moral development, with evidence for resultant increases in spontaneous prosocial behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, D., Watson, M. S., Delucchi, K. L., Schaps, E., &amp; Battistich, V. (1988). Enhancing children's prosocial behavior in the classroom. American Educational Research Journal, 25, 527-554.&lt;/ref&gt;

Culture can also be a key contributor toward differences in morality within society.&lt;ref name="Social and personality development"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shaffer|first1=David R.|title=Social and personality development|date=2009|publisher=Wadsworth/Cengage Learning|location=Australia|isbn=978-0-495-60038-1|page=357|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prosocial behavior, which is behavior that benefits others, is much more likely in societies with strong social goals rather than societies which emphasize the individual. For example, children being raised in China eventually adopt the collective communist ideals of their society. In fact, children learn to lie and deny responsibility for accomplishing something good instead of seeking recognition for their actions.&lt;ref name="Social and personality development" /&gt; Early indications of prosocial behavior include the sharing of toys and comforting distressed friends, and these characteristics can be seen in an individual’s behavior as young as infancy and toddlerhood.  Starting in preschool, sharing, helping, and other prosocial behaviors become more common, particularly in females, although the gender differences in prosocial behavior are not evident in all social contexts.&lt;ref name="Social and personality development"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shaffer|first1=David R.|title=Social and personality development|date=2009|publisher=Wadsworth/Cengage Learning|location=Australia|isbn=978-0-495-60038-1|page=357|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Moral relativism ===
[[Moral relativism]], also called “cultural relativism,” suggests that morality is relative to each culture. One cannot rightly pass moral judgement on members of other cultures except by their own cultural standards when actions violate a moral principle, which may differ from one’s own. [[Richard Shweder|Shweder]], Mahapatra, and Miller (1987) argued for the notion that different cultures defined the boundaries of morality differently.&lt;ref&gt;Shweder, R. A., Mahapatra, M., &amp; Miller, J. G. (1987). Culture and moral development In J. Kagan &amp; S. Lamb (Eds.), The emergence of morality in young children. (pp.1-83). Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also different from [[moral subjectivism]] which refers to the view that moral truth is relative to the individual. Moral relativism can be identified as a form of [[moral skepticism]] and is often misidentified as [[moral pluralism]]. It opposes to the attitude of moral superiority and ethnocentrism found in [[moral absolutism]] and the views of [[moral universalism]]. Turiel and Perkins (2004) argued for the universality of morality, focusing largely on evidence throughout history of resistance movements that fight for justice through the affirmation of individual self-determination rights.&lt;ref&gt;Turiel, E. &amp; Perkins, S. A. (2004). Flexibilities of mind: Conflict and culture. Human Development, 47, 158-178.&lt;/ref&gt;Miller (2006) proposes that there is cultural variability in the priority given to moral considerations (e.g., the importance of prosocial helping).&lt;ref&gt;Miller, J. G. (2006). Insights into moral development from cultural psychology. In M. Killen &amp; J. G. Smetana (Eds.), Handbook of moral development (pp. 375-398). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; rather than variability in what individuals consider moral (fairness, justice, rights). Wainryb (2006), in contrast, demonstrates that children in diverse cultures such as the U.S., India, China, Turkey, and Brazil share a pervasive view about upholding fairness and the wrongfulness of inflicting armong others.&lt;ref&gt;Wainryb, C. (2006). Moral development in culture: Diversity, tolerance, and justice. In M. Killen &amp; J.G. Smetana (Eds.), Handbook of Moral Development (pp. 211-242). NY: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cultures vary in terms of conventions and customs, but not principles of fairness, which appear to emerge very early in development, prior to socialization influences. Wainryb (1991; 1993) shows that many apparent cultural differences in moral judgments are actually due to different informational assumptions, or beliefs about the way the world works.&lt;ref&gt;Wainryb, C. (1991). Understanding differences in moral judgments: The role of informational assumptions. ''Child Development'', 62, 840-851.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wainryb, C. (1993). The application of moral judgments to other cultures: Relativism and universality. ''Child Development'', 64, 924-933.&lt;/ref&gt;  When people hold different beliefs about the effects of actions or the status of different groups of people, their judgments about the harmfulness or fairness of behaviors often differ, even when they are applying the same moral principles. 

=== Religion ===
The role of religion in a culture may influence a child's moral development and sense of moral identity. Values are transmitted through [[religion]], which is for many inextricably linked to a cultural identity. [[Religious development]] often goes along with moral development of the children as it shapes the child's concepts of right and wrong. Intrinsic aspects of religion may have a positive impact on the internalization and the symbolism of moral identity. The child may internalize the parents' morals if a religion is a family activity or the religious social group's morals to which the child belongs. Religious development mirrors the cognitive and moral developmental stages of the children. Nucci and Turiel (1993), on the other hand, proposed that the development of morality is distinct from the understanding of religious rules when assessing individuals' reactions to whether moral and nonmoral religious rules was contingent to God's word and whether a harmful act could be justified as morally right based on God's commands.&lt;ref&gt;Nucci, L. P., &amp; Turiel, E. (1993). God's word, religious rules and their relation to Christian and Jewish children's concepts of morality. ''Child Development'', 64, 1485-1491.&lt;/ref&gt; Children form their own understanding of how they see the world, themselves or others and are able to understand that not all religious rules are applied to morality, social structures or different religions. 

===In indigenous American communities===

In [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous American communities]], morality is taught to children through [[storytelling]]. It provides children guidelines for understanding the core values of their community, the significance of life and ideologies of moral character from past generations. &lt;ref name="Howard 1999 45–53"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Howard|first=Scott J.|title=Contemporary American Indian storytelling: An outsider's perspective|journal=American Indian Quarterly|date=1999|volume=23|pages=45–53|doi=10.2307/1185925|jstor=1185925}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Storytelling]] shapes the minds of young children in these communities as well as forms the dominant means for understanding and the basic foundation for learning and teaching.  

[[Storytelling]] in everyday life is used as an [[Informal learning|indirect form of teaching]]. Stories embedded with lessons of morals, ideals, and ethics are told alongside daily household chores. Most children in Indigenous American communities develop a sense of keen [[attention]] to the details of a story with the goal of learning from them, and to understand why people do the things they do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gaskins|first=Suzanne|title=Open Attention as a Cultural Tool for Observational Learning|url=http://kellogg.nd.edu/learning/Gaskins.pdf|publisher=University of Notre Dame|accessdate=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The understanding gained from a child's observation of morality and ethics taught through storytelling allows them to participate within their community appropriately.

Specific animals are used as characters to symbolize specific values and views of the culture in the [[storytelling]] where listeners are taught through the actions of these characters. In the [[Lakota tribe]], coyotes are often viewed as a trickster character, demonstrating negative behaviors like greed, recklessness, and arrogance &lt;ref name="Howard 1999 45–53"/&gt; while bears and foxes are usually viewed as wise, noble, and morally upright characters from which children learn to model .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.native-languages.org/legends.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the stories, trickster characters often get into troubles, thus teaching children to avoid exhibiting similar negative behaviors. The reuse of characters calls for a more predictable outcome that children can more easily understand.

===Social exclusion===

Intergroup exclusion context provides an appropriate platform to investigate the interplay of these three dimensions of intergroup attitudes and behaviors, prejudice, stereotypes and discrimination. Developmental scientists working from a Social Domain Theory (SDT: Killen et al., 2006; Smetana, 2006) perspective have focused on methods that measure children's reasoning about exclusion scenarios. This approach has been helpful in distinguishing which concerns children attend to when presented with a situation in which exclusion occurs. Exclusion from a peer group could raise concerns about moral issues (e.g. fairness and empathy towards excluded), social-conventional issues (e.g., traditions and social norms set by institutions and groups) and personal issues (e.g., autonomy, individual preferences related to friendships), and these can coexist depending on the context in which the exclusion occurs. In intergroup as well as intragroup contexts, children need to draw on knowledge and attitudes related to their own social identities, other social categories, the social norms associated with these categories as well as moral principals about the welfare of the excluded, and fair treatment, to make judgments about social exclusion. The importance of morality arises when the evaluation process of social exclusion requires one to deal with not only the predisposed tendencies of discrimination, prejudice, stereotypes and bias but also the internal judgments about justice equality and individual rights, which may prove to be a very complex task since it often evokes conflicts and dilemmas coming from the fact that the components of the first often challenge the components of the latter (Killen, Lee-Kim, McGlothlin, &amp; Stangor, 2002).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Killen|first=Melanie|last2=Lee-Kim|first2=Jennie|last3=McGlothlin|first3=Heidi|last4=Stangor|first4=Charles|last5=Helwig|first5=Charles C.|date=2002|title=How Children and Adolescents Evaluate Gender and Racial Exclusion|journal=Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development|volume=67|issue=4|pages=i–129|jstor=3181568}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Findings from a Social Domain Theory perspective show that children are sensitive to the context of exclusion and pay attention to different variables when judging or evaluating exclusion. These variables include, social categories, the stereotypes associated with them, children's qualifications as defined by prior experience with an activity, personality and behavioral traits that might be disruptive for group functioning and conformity to conventions as defined by group identity or social consensus. In the absence of information, stereotypes can be used to justify exclusion of a member of an out-group (Horn 2003,&lt;ref&gt;Horn, S. S. (2003). Adolescents' reasoning about exclusion from social groups. ''Developmental Psychology'', 39, 71-84&lt;/ref&gt; Killen and Stangor, 2001&lt;ref&gt;Killen, M., &amp; Stangor, C. (2001). Children's social reasoning about inclusion and exclusion in gender and race peer group contexts. ''Child Development'', 72, 174-186&lt;/ref&gt;). One's personality traits and whether he or she conforms to socially accepted behaviors related to identity also provide further criteria for social acceptance and inclusion by peers (Killen, Crystal, &amp; Watanabe, 2002;&lt;ref&gt;Killen, M., Crystal, D. S., &amp; Watanabe, H. (2002). The individual and the group: Japanese and American children's evaluations of peer exclusion, tolerance of difference, and prescriptions for conformity. ''Child Development'', 73, 1788-1802&lt;/ref&gt; Park, Killen, Crystal, &amp; Watanabe, 2003&lt;ref&gt;Park, Y., Killen, M., Crystal, D., &amp; Watanabe, H. (2003). Korean, Japanese, and American children's evaluations of peer exclusion: Evidence for diversity. International Journal of Behavioral Development, 27, 555-565&lt;/ref&gt;). Also, research has documented the presence of a transition occurring at the reasoning level behind the criteria of inclusion and exclusion from childhood to adolescence (Horn, 2003). As children get older, they become more attuned to issues of group functioning and conventions and weigh them in congruence with issues of fairness and morality (Killen &amp; Stangor, 2001)

===Allocation of resources===

[[Resource allocation]] is a critical part of the [[decision making process]] for individuals in positions of public responsibility and authority (e.g., health care providers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Calman|first1=K C|title=The ethics of allocation of scarce health care resources: a view from the centre|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|date=1 June 1994|volume=20|issue=2|pages=71–4|doi=10.1136/jme.20.2.71|pmid=8083876|pmc=1376429}}&lt;/ref&gt; When resources become scarce, such as in rural communities experiencing situations when there is not enough food to feed everyone, authorities in position to make decisions that affect this community can create conflicts on various levels (e.g., personally, financially, socially, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gardent|first1=Paul B.,|last2=Reeves|first2=Susan A.,|title=Ethic Conflicts in Rural Communities|url=http://geiselmed.dartmouth.edu/cfm/resources/ethics/chapter-09.pdf|publisher=Dartmouth College Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The moral conflict that arise from these decisions can be divided into a focus of conflict and a locus of moral conflict. The locus, or the place where conflict occurs, can develop from multiple sources which include “any combination of personal, professional, organizational, and community values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gardent|first1=Paul B.,|last2=Reeves|first2=Susan A.,|title=Ethic Conflicts in Rural Communities|url=http://geiselmed.dartmouth.edu/cfm/resources/ethics/chapter-09.pdf|publisher=Dartmouth College Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of conflict occurs from competing values held by stakeholders and financial investors. As K. C. Calman (1994) stated in regards to the reallocation of resources in a medical setting, resources must be thought of not only as money, but also in the form of skills, time, and faculties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Calman|first1=K C|title=The ethics of allocation of scarce health care resources: a view from the centre.|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|date=1 June 1994|volume=20|issue=2|pages=72–73|doi=10.1136/jme.20.2.71|pmc=1376429}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The healthcare system has many examples where morality and resource allocation has ongoing conflicts. Concerns of morality arise when the initiation, continuation, and withdrawal of intensive care affects a patients well being due to medical decision making.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bone|first1=Roger C.|last2=Rackow|first2=Eric C.|last3=Weg|first3=John G.|last4=Butler|first4=Peter|last5=Carton|first5=Robert W.|last6=Elpern|first6=Ellen|last7=Franklin|first7=Cory|last8=Goldman|first8=Edward B.|last9=Gracey|first9=Douglas D.|last10=Hiss|first10=Roland G.|last11=Knaus|first11=William A.|last12=Lefrak|first12=Stephen S.|last13=McCartney|first13=Rev.

“How should I interpret new diagnostic information?
How do I select the appropriate diagnostic test? 
How do I choose among several risky treatments?” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Owens|first1=Harold C. Sox, Michael C. Higgins, Douglas K.|title=Medical decision making|date=2013|publisher=Wiley Blackwell|location=Chichester, West Sussex, UK|isbn=978-0-470-65866-6|pages=1–3|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Withholding and withdrawing life-sustaining treatment, in the United States, has had a moral consensus that there are no differences between these two therapies. However, even though a political decision offers support for medical practitioner's decision making, there continues to be difficulty withdrawing life-sustaining treatments.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

'''Paper engineering''' is a branch of engineering that deals with the usage of [[physical science]] (e.g. chemistry and physics) and life sciences (e.g. [[biology]] and [[biochemistry]]) in conjunction with [[mathematics]] as applied to the converting of raw materials into useful [[paper]] products and co-products.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.industrysolutions.siemens.com/paper/en/index.htm |title=Siemens AG. Pulp and Paper Technologies. |date= |work= |publisher=[[Siemens AG]] |accessdate=November 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field applies various principles in [[process engineering]] and [[unit operations]] to the manufacture of [[paper]], [[paper chemicals|chemicals]], [[energy]] and related materials. The following timeline shows some of the key steps in the development of the science of chemical and bioprocess engineering:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pafko.com/history/h_intro.html  History of Chemical Engineering] – at North Carolina State University (and in general).&lt;/ref&gt;

From a heritage perspective, the field encompasses the design and analysis of a wide variety of thermal, chemical and biochemical [[unit operations]] employed in the manufacture of pulp and paper, and addresses the preparation of its raw materials from trees or other natural resources via a [[Wood pulp|pulp]]ing process, chemical and mechanical pretreatment of these recovered [[biopolymer]] (e.g. principally, although not solely, [[cellulose]]-based) fibers in a fluid suspension, the high-speed forming and initial dewatering of a non-woven web, the development of bulk sheet properties via control of energy and mass transfer operations, as well as post-treatment of the sheet with coating, calendering, and other chemical and mechanical processes.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Applications==
Today, the field of paper and chemical engineering is applied to the manufacture of a wide variety of products. The (bio)[[chemical industry]] scope manufactures organic and [[agrochemicals]] (fertilizers, insecticides, herbicides), [[oleochemicals]], fragrances and flavors, food, [[Fodder|feed]], [[pharmaceuticals]], [[nutraceuticals]], [[chemicals]], [[polymers]] and power from biological materials.

The resulting products of paper engineering including paper, cardboard, and various paper derivatives are widely used in everyday life. In addition to being a subset of chemical engineering, the field of paper engineering is closely linked to [[forest management]], product [[recycling]], and the mass production of paper – based media.

==Methods==

===Mechanical pulping===
In the process of mechanical pulping, "grinding" and "refining" are the two main methods used to create the pulp. Grinding is the method of pressing logs and chips against a turning stone to produce fibers. Refiner pulping is treating wood chips with chemicals or heat and then crushing the objects between two disks, one or both of which are rotating. There are four main types of refiner pulping, which includes refiner mechanical pulping, thermo-mechanical pulping, chemi-mechanical pulping, and chemithermomechanical pulping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.washington.edu/classes.pse.476/Powerpoint/Powerpoint-Renata/pse%20476-2%20mechanical%20pulping.ppt  |title=Pulping and Bleaching |author= R. Gustafson |date=n.d. |work= |publisher= University of Washington |accessdate=November 23, 2010 | first= | last= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further descriptions of each process are contained in this link:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cfr.washington.edu/classes.pse.476/Powerpoint/Powerpoint-Renata/pse%20476-2%20mechanical%20pulping.ppt&lt;/ref&gt;
Mechanical pulping, when compared to chemical pulping, is relatively inexpensive and has a high pulp yield (85–95%). However, the paper created is generally weak since it retains the lignin.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

===Chemical pulping===
The process of [[chemical pulping]] is used to chemically disband the [[lignin]] found in the cell walls of the material undergoing the process. After the [[cellulose]] fibers are separated from the lignin, a pulp is created which can then be treated to create durable paper, boxes, and corrugated cardboard. Chemical pulping can be characterized by two main methods: sulfate ([[Kraft process]]) pulping and sulfite pulping, and these two methods have different benefits. Sulfate pulping can be performed on a wide range of tree varieties and results in the creation of a strong type of paper. Conversely, sulfite pulping results in a higher volume of pulp which is easier to bleach and process. However, sulfate pulping is more widely used since the product is more durable and the chemicals used in the process can be recovered, thus resulting in minimal environmental pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecy.wa.gov/programs/air/pdfs/pulpmil3.pdf  |title=Chemical Pulp Mills |author= Washington State Department of Ecology |date=n.d. |work= |publisher= |accessdate=November 23, 2010 | first= | last= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further pulp processing===
{{Main|Paper machine}}

The pulp is then processed through an apparatus which renders the pulp as a mesh of fibers. This fiber network is then pressed to remove all water contents, and the paper is subsequently dried to remove all traces of moisture.

===Finishing===
{{Main|Paper}}

After the above processes have been completed, the resulting paper is coated with a minuscule amount of [[china clay]] or [[calcium carbonate]] to modify the surface, and the paper is then re-sized depending on its intended purpose.

===Product recycling ===
{{Main|Paper recycling}}

Generally, the material to be recycled first undergoes mechanical or chemical pulping to render it in pulp form. The resulting pulp is then processed in the same way normal pulp is processed; however, original fiber is sometimes added to enhance the quality and appearance of the product.

'''Paul-Gilbert Langevin''' ([[Boulogne-Billancourt]], 5 July 1933 – [[Paris]], 4 July 1986) was a French musicologist, who wrote books on [[Anton Bruckner]], [[Franz Schubert]] and 19th-century classical music.

Paul-Gilbert Langevin was the son of French physicist [[Paul Langevin]] (1872–1946)&lt;ref name="Langevin1977p4"&gt;{{cite book|last=Langevin|first=Paul-Gilbert|title=Anton Bruckner, apogée de la symphonie|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fhUzi81BbBEC&amp;pg=PP4|year=1977|publisher=l'Âge d'Homme|page=4|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Eliane Montel]] (1898–1992), a private teacher at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] science department. He started his scientific education at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] and then completed it at the [[Pierre and Marie Curie University|Université Pierre-et-Marie-Curie]], obtaining a degree in [[physical chemistry]] under the supervision of professor René Freymann&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF03161964 ''The scientific life and work of René Freymann (1909–1995)''], on Springer website.&lt;/ref&gt;.

From a young age, Langevin had a deep interest in classical music, listening to [[Anton Bruckner]]'s symphonies on radio recordings during his youth and meeting conductor [[Roberto Benzi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.robertobenzi.com/ Conductor Roberto Benzi], personal website.&lt;/ref&gt; Having completed his scientific degrees, he decided to write a thesis under the supervision of [[Daniel Charles]] at the ''Centre Universitaire de Vincennes'' about 19th century Austrian music, focusing on composer [[Anton Bruckner]] and the so-called "ethnoromantic" period&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Langevin|first=Paul-Gilbert|title=Musiciens d'Europe|url=http://ressources.ircam.fr/record/default:UNIMARC:28890|year=1986|publisher=La Revue Musicale|via=IRCAM website}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

He became a physics teacher at the Sorbonne science department, and then, at the [[Université Pierre-et-Marie-Curie]], which was created in the 1960s.  During this time, he met musicologists [[Harry Halbreich]], Gustave Kars, Jacques Feschotte, [[Pierre Vidal (composer)|Pierre Vidal]], [[Marc Vignal]] and [[Jean-Luc Caron]]. Langevin went on to create the Anton Bruckner French society,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cairn.info/revue-reliance-2007-2-page-140.htm ''Anton Bruckner, ce pauvre sot''], paper by Alfred and Françoise Brauner, on ''Cairn'' website.&lt;/ref&gt; wrote books on 19th-century symphonic music, edited in ''La Revue Musicale'' and ''L'Age d'Homme'',&lt;ref name="Langevin1977p3"&gt;{{cite book|last=Langevin|first=Paul-Gilbert|title=Anton Bruckner, apogée de la symphonie|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fhUzi81BbBEC&amp;pg=PA3|year=1977|publisher=l'Âge d'Homme|page=3|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became a music critic in ''Le Monde de la Musique'', edited by Anne Rey.

From the 1950s, Langevin focused on classical music, symphonic music, and writing. Specifically, he wrote articles, monographs and books about Anton Bruckner, [[Franz Schubert]], [[Guillaume Lekeu]], [[Albéric Magnard]], [[Joseph-Guy Ropartz]] and [[Charles Koechlin]]. He was also interested in works by [[Hugo Wolf]], [[Gustav Mahler]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]], [[Franz Schmidt]], [[Ferruccio Busoni]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rodoni.ch/busoni/opere/LANGEVIN.html ''Ferruccio Busoni et son oeuvre symphonique''], paper by Paul-Gilbert Langevin, on ''rodoni.ch'' website.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leoš Janáček]] and [[Carl Nielsen]].

He died on 4 July 1986.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Newham's biological father was [[Bertold Wiesner|Berthold Paul Wiesner]], the [[Physiology|physiologist]] known for coining the term [[Parapsychology#Terminology|'Psi']], now widely used to signify [[Parapsychology|parapsychological]] phenomena, and who sired over six hundred children through [[Artificial insemination|anonymous sperm donation]] at an unauthorized [[London]] [[fertility clinic]] jointly managed with his wife, the [[Obstetrics|obstetrician]] [[Mary Barton (obstetrician)|Mary Barton]], from which they both absconded after burning all records of their endeavour.&lt;ref&gt;Dybvig, M., On the philosophy of Psi. Inquiry: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Philosophy Vol. 30, No. 3, 1987, pp253-275.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rhine, J. B., Psi phenomena and psychiatry. Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine Vol. 43, No. 11, 1950, pp804–814.&lt;/ref&gt;

Newham grew up falsely believing that his mother's abusive husband Derek Joseph Newham was his biological father, and frequently attempted to discern the subject of violent arguments between them as he listened in his bedroom, from where only the [[timbre]] of the voices, including shouts, screams, and crying were perceptible.&lt;ref&gt;Newham, P., Therapeutic Voicework, London: Jessica Kingsley, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Work in Expressive Therapy==
[[File:Alfred_Wolfsohn.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Alfred Wolfsohn.|Alfred Wolfsohn]]
Newham was subsequently inspired by the life of German [[Vocal pedagogy|vocal coach]] [[Alfred Wolfsohn]], and the research conducted at the [[Alfred Wolfsohn Voice Research Centre]].

[[Alfred Wolfsohn]] (1896 - 1962) was a German [[Jew]] who suffered persistent [[hearing|auditory]] [[hallucination]] of screaming soldiers, whom he had witnessed dying of wounds while serving as a [[Combat medic|stretcher bearer]] in the trenches of [[World War I]], at the age of eighteen. After being subsequently diagnosed with [[shell shock]], Wolfsohn failed to recover in response to hospitalization or [[Psychiatry|psychiatric]] treatment, but claimed to have cured himself by vocalizing the extreme sounds of his hallucinations, bringing about what he described as a combination of [[catharsis]] and [[exorcism]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolfsohn, A., Die Brücke. London 1947 (Manuscript). Trans. Marita Günther and Sheila Braggins. Repository: Joods Historisch Museum, Amsterdam: NL.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolfsohn, A., Orpheus, oder der Weg zu einer Maske. Germany 1936–1938 (Manuscript). Trans. Marita Günther. Repository: Joods Historisch Museum, Amsterdam: NL.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newham, P., The psychology of voice and the founding of the Roy Hart Theatre. New Theatre Quarterly IX, No. 33, February 1993, pp59-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolfsohn was encouraged by the range and expressiveness of his own voice, resulting from the [[Vocal pedagogy|vocal exercises and techniques]] that he developed in an attempt to heal the symptoms of [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|trauma]] sustained during the war, and began teaching others, acting as both a [[singing]] teacher and [[Psychotherapy|psychotherapist]], seeking to combine the principles of both disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;Newham, P., The psychology of voice and the founding of the Roy Hart Theatre. New Theatre Quarterly, IX No. 33, February 1993, pp59-65.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Günther, M., The human voice: On Alfred Wolfsohn. Spring: A Journal of Archetype and Culture, Vol. 50, 1990, pp65–75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Newham [[Empathy|empathized]] with Wolfsohn's [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-war trauma]], having himself been traumatized by the sounds of violent arguing between his mother and Derek Newham while growing up. He therefore built upon and extended the endeavors begun at the [[Alfred Wolfsohn Voice Research Centre]] aligning it with [[Cognitive psychology|cognitive]] and [[Psychoneuroimmunology|psychophysiological]] principles, alleging that vocalizing might have therapeutic benefits by means comparable to the [[Expressive therapy|expressive therapies]], including [[drama therapy]] and [[music therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;Storm, S., The human voice: Psychology and psychodynamic voice therapy. Psyke &amp; Logos: Musik og Psykologi, Vol. 28, No. 1, 2007, pp447–478.&lt;/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McKinstry-Edwards, D., Singing: soul's mythic mirror. An exploration of myth's musical nature. Carpinteria, CA, USA: Pacifica Graduate Institute, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, E. A., Between liminality and transgression: Experimental voice in avant-garde performance.  Canterbury, UK: University of Canterbury, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Magnis, E. S., Finding a vocal path through depression.  Carpinteria, CA, USA: Pacifica Graduate Institute, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, J. C., The more we listen: Towards a depth psychological understanding of sound as image. Carpinteria, CA, USA: Pacifica Graduate Institute, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Newham began applying his research while teaching severely [[Disability|disabled]] young adults, many of whom could not articulate [[Phonation|vocal sounds]] into intelligible speech. By [[music]]alizing their voices, and producing devised theatre productions in which his clients performed vocally but not verbally, Newham was able to facilitate their experience of [[Communication|communicating]] to an audience through voice.&lt;ref&gt;Totton, N., Body psychotherapy: An introduction. Columbus, OH, USA: McGraw-Hill Education, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, A., Making an entrance: theory and practice for disabled and non-disabled dancers. London, UK and New York, USA: Routledge, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Newham subsequently began working with those who were not physically disabled, but suffered from various forms of [[psychological pain]] that they experienced as being beyond words. During this period, Newham's work was aligned to the principles and practices of [[Music therapy|active music therapy]], by which patients or participants produce and perform musical compositions, with instruments and voice.&lt;ref&gt;Bruscia, K., Defining music therapy. Barcelona, Spain: Gilsum, NH., 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland, K., International dictionary of music therapy. London, UK and New York, USA: Routledge, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ludlam, S. K., The use of music therapy to support speech and expressive language development for pre-school children with special needs, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Austin, D., In search of the self: The use of vocal holding techniques with adults traumatized as children. Music Therapy Perspectives, Vol. 19, No. 1, 2001, pp22-30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kreitler, S., Oppenheim, D.,  and Segev‐Shoham, E., Fantasy, art therapies, and other expressive and creative psychosocial interventions. Paediatric Psycho-Oncology: Psychosocial Aspects and Clinical Interventions, Hoboken, New Jersey, USA: Wiley and Sons, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later Work in Receptive Therapy==
[[File:Music listener.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Audio Therapy.|Listening to sound in audio therapy.]]
While researching the background to the [[Alfred Wolfsohn Voice Research Centre]], Newham met and subsequently collaborated with the British [[author]], [[archivist]], and [[curator]] [[Leslie Shepard]], to produce a monograph on the life and work of the German teacher.&lt;ref&gt;Newham, P. The Prophet of Song: The Life and Work of Alfred Wolfsohn. London: Tigers Eye Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, M. P., and Bohm-Duchen, M., Reading Charlotte Salomon. Ithaca, NY, USA: Cornell University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to documenting the work undertaken at the [[Alfred Wolfsohn Voice Research Centre]], through film, [[Sound recording and reproduction|sound recordings]], and written [[Diary|diaries]], until the founder's death in 1962, Shepard also collected thousands of documents and audio recordings relating to indigenous forms of [[music]], [[meditation]], [[prayer]], and [[Contemplation|contemplative practices]].&lt;ref&gt;Hart, R., et al, An outline of the work of the Alfred Wolfsohn Voice Research Centre. Subsequently published in The Roy Hart Theatre: Documentation and interviews. Dartington Theatre Papers, ed. David Williams, Fifth Series, No. 14, pp2–7. Series ed. Peter Hulton. Dartington: Devon, UK: Dartington College of Arts, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leslie Shepard|Shepard's]] collection inspired Newham to consider the way in which different forms of recorded [[Acoustics|acoustic]] [[Hearing|stimuli]], including [[Speech|spoken word]], [[music]], and [[Ambient music|ambient sound]], might effect a listener, potentially precipitating a range of responses including [[Relaxation technique|relaxation]], [[hypnagogia]], and experiences comparable to those reportedly achieved through [[meditation]].
During this period, Newham's work was aligned with the principles of [[Music therapy|receptive music therapy]], by which patients or participants listen to live or recorded musical compositions, and subsequently describe their responses to the facilitating music therapist.&lt;ref&gt;Bruscia, K., Defining music therapy. Barcelona, Spain: Gilsum, NH., 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grocke, D., and Wigram, T., Receptive methods in music therapy: Techniques and clinical applications for music therapy clinicians, educators, and students. London, England: Jessica Kingsley, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence and Contributions==
===Expressive Therapy===
In addition to his work in the field of [[music therapy]],&lt;ref&gt;Lerner, N., and Straus, J., Sounding off: Theorizing Disability in Music. London, UK and New York, USA: Routledge, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Iliya, Y., A., Singing for healing and hope: music therapy methods that use the voice with individuals who are homeless and mentally ill.

Carpinteria, CA, USA: Pacifica Graduate Institute, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Newham has contributed to the theories and applications of other [[Expressive therapy|expressive therapies]], including drama therapy and [[Dance therapy|dance movement therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;McNiff, S., Integrating the Arts in Therapy: History, Theory, and Practice. Springfield, IL, USA: Charles C Thomas Publishers, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Newham's contribution to [[drama therapy]] derives from his study of [[Self-concept|possible selves]], and the development of techniques by which [[Intrapersonal communication|inner voices]] might be vocalized with intent to interpret their significance.&lt;ref&gt;Casson, J., Drama, Psychotherapy and Psychosis: Dramatherapy and Psychodrama with People who Hear Voices.

===Receptive Therapy===
Newham's contribution to receptive therapy derives from applying the principles of [[neuroacosutics]], which studies neural correlates to the perception and cognition of sound, speech, and music in animals,&lt;ref&gt;Wind, J., Jonker, A., Allott, R., and Rolfe, L., (Eds.), Studies in Language Origins, Volume 3, Amsterdam, NL: John Benjamins Publishing, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Studdert-Kennedy, M., The perception of speech.

[[Audio therapy]] synthesises elements from a number of discreet areas of research and practice, including [[Music therapy|receptive music therapy]], [[bibliotherapy]], [[creative visualization]], [[guided imagery]], [[guided meditation]], [[sound healing]], and [[cognitive behavioral therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;Blenkiron, P., Coping with depression: A pilot study to assess the efficacy of a self-help  audio cassette.

In the [[history of biology]], '''preformationism''' (or '''preformism''') is a formerly-popular theory that organisms develop from miniature versions of themselves. Instead of assembly from parts, preformationists believed that the [[platonic forms|form]] of living things exist, in real terms, prior to their [[ontogeny|development]].&lt;ref name=SEP&gt;Maienschein, Jane, "[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/epigenesis/ Epigenesis and Preformationism]", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2008 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.).&lt;/ref&gt; It suggests that all [[organism]]s were created at the same time, and that succeeding generations grow from [[Homunculus|homunculi]], or [[animalcule]]s, that have existed since the beginning of creation.

[[Epigenesis (biology)|Epigenesis]]&lt;ref name=OED1&gt;According to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]]: {{quote | The word is used by W. Harvey, ''Exercitationes'' 1651, p. 148, and in the ''English Anatomical Exercitations'' 1653, p. 272. It is explained to mean 'partium super-exorientium additamentum', 'the additament of parts budding one out of another'.}}  It is also worth quoting this adumbration of the definition given there (viz., "The formation of an organic germ as a new product"): {{quote | '''theory of epigenesis''': the theory that the germ is brought into existence (by successive accretions), and not merely developed, in the process of reproduction. ... The opposite theory was formerly known as the 'theory of evolution'; to avoid the ambiguity of this name, it is now spoken of chiefly as the 'theory of preformation', sometimes as that of 'encasement' or 'emboîtement'.}}
&lt;/ref&gt; (or neoformism),&lt;ref&gt;Callebaut, Marc, 2008: [http://www.naturalsciences.be/institute/associations/rbzs_website/bjz/back/pdf/BJZ%20138(1)/138_1_20_35html/Volume%20138(1),%20pp.%2020-35.html Historical evolution of preformistic versus neoformistic epigenetic thinking in embryology]. Belgian Journal of Zoology 138(1): 20-35.&lt;/ref&gt; then, in this context, is the denial of preformationism: the idea that, in some sense, the form of living things comes into existence.  As opposed to "strict" preformationism, it is the notion that "each embryo or organism is gradually produced from an undifferentiated mass by a series of steps and stages during which new parts are added" (Magner 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;154).&lt;ref name=Magner&gt;Magner, Lois. ''A History of the Life Sciences''. New York: Marcel Dekker, Inc, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; This word is still used, on the other hand, in a more modern sense, to refer to those aspects of the generation of form during ontogeny that are not strictly genetic, or, in other words, ''[[epigenetics|epigenetic]]''.

Furthermore, apart from those distinctions (preformationism-epigenesis and genetic-epigenetic), the terms preformistic development, epigenetic development and [[somatic embryogenesis]] are also used in another context, in relation to the [[Cellular differentiation|differentiation]] of a distinct [[germ cell]] line. In preformistic development, the germ line is present since early development. In epigenetic development, the germ line is present, but it appears late. In somatic embryogenesis, a distinct germ line is lacking.&lt;ref&gt;Buss, L.W. (1987). ''The Evolution of Individuality''. Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ, p. 20 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Mfj_AwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=inauthor%3A%22Leo%20W.%20Buss%22&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;pg=PA20#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false].&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors call [[Weismann barrier|Weismannist]] development (either preformistic or epigenetic) that in which there is a distinct germ line.&lt;ref&gt;Ridley M (2004) Evolution, 3rd edition. Blackwell Publishing, p. 295-297.&lt;/ref&gt;

The historical ideas of preformationism and epigenesis, and the rivalry between them, are obviated by our [[genetics|contemporary understanding]] of the [[genetic code]] and its [[nucleic acid|molecular basis]] together with [[developmental biology]] and [[epigenetics]].

==Philosophical development==
[[Pythagoras]] is one of the earliest thinkers credited with ideas about the origin of form in the biological production of offspring. It is said&lt;ref name=johnston&gt;e.g. by Ian Johnston, Malaspina University-College, Nanaimo, BC, in "...And Still We Evolve:
A Handbook on the History of Modern Science", [http://records.viu.ca/~johnstoi/darwin/sect5.htm Section Five: Heredity and Modern Genetics], May 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; that he originated "spermism", the doctrine that fathers contribute the essential characteristics of their offspring while mothers contribute only a material substrate. [[Aristotle]] accepted and elaborated this idea, and his writings are the vector that transmitted it to later Europeans. Aristotle purported to analyse ontogeny in terms of the material, formal, efficient, and teleological causes (as they are usually named by later anglophone philosophy) &amp;ndash; a view that, though more complex than some subsequent ones, is essentially more epigenetic than preformationist. Later, European physicians such as [[Galen]], [[Realdo Colombo]] and [[Girolamo Fabrici]] would build upon Aristotle's theories, which were prevalent well into the 17th century.&lt;ref name=Magner/&gt;

In 1651, [[William Harvey]] published ''On the Generation of Animals'' (''[[William Harvey|Exercitationes de Generatione Animalium]]''), a seminal work on [[embryology]] that contradicted many of Aristotle's fundamental ideas on the matter. Harvey famously asserted, for example, that ''ex ovo omnia''—all animals come from eggs. Because of this assertion in particular, Harvey is often credited with being the father of ovist preformationism. However, Harvey's ideas about the process of development were fundamentally epigenesist.&lt;ref name=Pinto-Correia&gt;Clara Pinto Correia, ''The Ovary of Eve: Egg and Sperm Preformation'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1997. {{ISBN|0-226-66952-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[gametes]] (male sperm and female ova) were too small to be seen under the best magnification at the time, Harvey's account of fertilization was theoretical rather than descriptive.  Although he once postulated a "spiritous substance" that exerted its effect on the female body, he later rejected it as superfluous and thus unscientific. He guessed instead that fertilization occurred through a mysterious transference by contact, or contagion.&lt;ref name=Magner/&gt;

Harvey's epigenesis, more mechanistic and less vitalist than the Aristotelian version, was, thus, more compatible with the [[natural philosophy]] of the time.&lt;ref name="Pinto-Correia"/&gt; Still, the idea that unorganized matter could ultimately self-organize into life challenged the [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic]] framework of [[Cartesianism]], which had become dominant in the [[Scientific Revolution]]. Because of technological limitations, there was no available mechanical explanation for epigenesis.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S. J. (1974) [https://books.google.com/books?id=_VCnI02FwHAC&amp;pg=PA202 "On Heroes and Fools in Science."] ''Natural History'' 83 (7): 30-32.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was simpler and more convenient to postulate preformed miniature organisms that expanded in accordance with mechanical laws. So convincing was this explanation that some naturalists claimed to actually see miniature preformed animals ([[animalcule]]s) in eggs and miniature plants in seeds.&lt;ref name=Magner/&gt; In the case of humans, the term [[homunculus]] was used.

== Elaboration ==

After the discovery of [[Spermatozoon|spermatozoa]] in 1677 by Dutch microscopist [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]], the epigenist theory proved more difficult to defend: How could complex organisms such as human beings develop from such simple organisms? Thereafter, Joseph de Aromatari and then [[Marcello Malpighi]] and [[Jan Swammerdam]] made observations using microscopes in the late 17th century, and interpreted their findings to develop the preformationist theory. For two centuries, until the development of [[cell theory]], preformationists would oppose epigenicists, and, inside the preformationist camp, spermists (who claimed the homunculus must come from the man) to ovists, who located the homunculus in the ova.

Dutch microscopist [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] was one of the first to observe spermatozoa. He described the spermatozoa of about 30 species, and thought he saw in semen "all manner of great and small vessels, so various and so numerous that I do not doubt that they be nerves, arteries and veins...And when I saw them, I felt convinced that, in no full grown body, are there any vessels which may not be found likewise in semen." (Friedman 76-7)&lt;ref name=Friedman&gt;Friedman, David M. [[A Mind of Its Own: A Cultural History of the Penis]]. New York: The Free Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Leeuwenhoek discovered that the origin of semen was the testicles and was a committed preformationist and spermist. He reasoned that the movement of spermatozoa was evidence of animal life, which presumed a complex structure and, for human sperm, a soul. (Friedman 79)&lt;ref name=Friedman/&gt;

In 1694, [[Nicolaas Hartsoeker]], in his ''Essai de Dioptrique'' concerning things large and small that could be seen with optical lenses, produced an image of a tiny human form curled up inside the sperm, which he referred to in the French as ''petit l'infant'' and ''le petit animal''. This image, depicting what historians now refer to as the [[homunculus]], has become iconic of the theory of preformationism, and appears in almost every textbook concerning the history of embryological science.&lt;ref name="Pinto-Correia" /&gt;

Philosopher [[Nicolas Malebranche]] was the first to advance the hypothesis that each embryo could contain even smaller embryos [[ad infinitum]], like a [[Matryoshka doll]]. According to Malebranche, "an infinite series of plants and animals were contained within the seed or the egg, but only naturalists with sufficient skill and experience could detect their presence." (Magner 158-9)&lt;ref name=Magner/&gt; In fact, Malebranche only alleged this, observing that if microscopes enabled us to see very little animals and plants, maybe even smaller creatures could exist. He claimed that it was not unreasonable to believe that "they are infinite trees in only one seed," as he stated that we could already see chickens in eggs, tulips in bulbs, frogs in eggs. From this, he hypothesized that "all the bodies of humans and animals," already born and yet to be born, "were perhaps produced as soon as the [[Creation myth|creation of the world]]." &lt;ref&gt;[[Nicolas Malebranche]], ''De la recherche de la vérité'' (The Search After Truth), book I, chapter VI, first section (1674-1675)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ovum|Ova]] were known in some non-mammalian species, and [[semen]] was thought to spur the development of the preformed organism contained therein. The theory that located the homonculus in the egg was called [[ovism]]. But, when spermatozoa were discovered, a rival camp of [[spermism|spermists]] sprang up, claiming that the homunculus must come from the male. In fact, the term "spermatozoon," coined by [[Karl Ernst von Baer]], means "seed animals."&lt;ref name=Magner/&gt;

With the discovery of sperm and the concept of spermism came a religious quandary. Why would so many little animals be wasted with each ejaculation of semen? [[Pierre Lyonet]] said the wastage proved that sperm could not be the seeds of life. [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] supported a theory called [[panspermism]] that the wasted sperm might actually be scattered (for example, by the wind) and generate life wherever they found a suitable host.

Leibniz also believed that “death is only a transformation enveloped through diminution,” meaning that not only have organisms always existed in their living form, but that they will always exist, body united to soul, even past apparent death.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Justin Erik. “Leibniz’s Preformationism: Between Metaphysics and Biology.”Analecta Husserliana, the Yearbook of Phenomenological Research. Volume LXXVII. (2002) 161-192.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, some animalculists thought that an animal's sperm behaved like the adult animal, and recorded such observations. Some, but not all, preformationists at this time claimed to see miniature organisms inside the sex cells. But, about this time, spermists began to use more abstract arguments to support their theories.

[[Jean Astruc]], noting that parents of both sexes seemed to influence the characteristics of their offspring, suggested that the animalcule came from the sperm and was then shaped as it passed into the egg. [[Georges Louis Leclerc|Buffon]] and [[Pierre Louis Moreau]] also advocated theories to explain this phenomenon.&lt;ref name=Magner/&gt;

Preformationism, especially ovism, was the dominant theory of generation during the 18th century. It competed with [[spontaneous generation]] and [[Epigenesis (biology)|epigenesis]], but those two theories were often rejected on the grounds that inert matter could not produce life without God's intervention.
      
Some animals' [[regeneration (biology)|regenerative]] capabilities challenged preformationism, and [[Abraham Trembley]]'s studies of the [[hydra (genus)|hydra]] convinced various authorities to reject their former views.
             
[[Lazaro Spallanzani]], Trembley's nephew, experimented with regeneration and semen, but failed to discern the importance of spermatozoa, dismissing them as parasitic worms and concluding instead that it was the liquid portion of semen that caused the preformed organism in the [[ovum]] to develop.

== Criticisms and cell theory ==

[[Caspar Friedrich Wolff]], an epigenicist, was an 18th-century exception who argued for objectivity and freedom from religious influence on scientific questions.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

Despite careful observation of developing embryos, epigenesis suffered from a lack of a theoretical mechanism of generation. Wolff proposed an "essential force" as the agent of change, and [[Immanuel Kant]] with [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]] proposed a "developing drive" or ''[[:de:Bildungstrieb|Bildungstrieb]]'', a concept related to [[self-organization]].

Naturalists of the late 18th century and the 19th century embraced Wolff's philosophy, but primarily because they rejected the application of mechanistic development, as seen in the expansion of miniature organisms. It was not until the late 19th century that preformationism was discarded in the face of [[cell theory]]. Now, scientists "realized that they need not treat living organisms as machines, nor give up all hope of ever explaining the mechanisms that govern living beings." (Magner 173)&lt;ref name=Magner/&gt;

When [[John Dalton]]'s [[atomic theory]] of matter [[scientific revolutions|superseded]] Descartes' philosophy of [[infinite divisibility]] at the beginning of the 19th century, preformationism was struck a further blow. There was not enough space at the bottom of the spectrum to accommodate infinitely stacked animalcules, without bumping into the constituent parts of matter. (Gee 43)&lt;ref name=Gee&gt;[[Henry Gee|Gee, Henry]]. ''Jacob's Ladder: The History of the Human Genome''. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

== Roux and Driesch ==
Near the end of the 19th century, the most prominent advocates of preformationatism and epigenesis were [[Wilhelm Roux]] and [[Hans Driesch]]. Driesch's experiments on the development of the embryos of [[sea urchin]]s are considered as deciding the case in favor of epigenesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard C.

Historically, professional conduct was wholly undertaken by the private professional bodies, the sole legal authority for which was of a contractual nature. These bodies commonly established [[codes of conduct]] and [[ethical code]]s for the guidance of their members.

In certain areas, where the [[public interest]] is considered to be heavily engaged, [[legislation]] has been enacted, either replacing professional regulation by statutory legislation, or by a form of supervision of the professional body by a statutory body.&lt;ref&gt;Harris 2011, chapter 16&lt;/ref&gt;

== European Union ==

The [http://www.ccbe.eu/ Council of Bars and Law Societies of Europe (CCBE)] is the representative organisation of [[European lawyers]] through its member bars and law societies from 31 full member countries, and 11 further associate and observer countries. The CCBE has issued a Charter of core principles of the European legal profession and Code of Conduct for European lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccbe.eu/fileadmin/user_upload/NTCdocument/EN_Code_of_conductp1_1306748215.pdf Charter of core principles of the European legal profession and Code of Conduct for European lawyers]&lt;/ref&gt; Activities include a committee on [[Deontology]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccbe.eu/index.php?id=94&amp;id_comite=7&amp;L=0 Committee on Deontology]&lt;/ref&gt; and a working group on Professional Indemnity Insurance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccbe.eu/index.php?id=94&amp;id_comite=16&amp;L=0 Working group on Professional Indemnity Insurance]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [http://www.ecceengineers.eu/ European Council of Civil Engineers (ECCE)] aims to promote the highest technical and ethical standards, to provide a source of impartial advice, and promote co-operation with other pan-European organisations in the construction industry. The ECCE formulates standards for a European Code of Conduct of the Civil Engineering Profession and disciplinary procedures applicable throughout the Union.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecceengineers.eu/links/ethics.php?id=42 ECCE Code of Professional Conduct]&lt;/ref&gt; Other activities include the preparation of a review of the civil engineering profession in Europe, covering, e.g., demand for liability insurance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecceengineers.eu/papers/files/ECCE_Book_011005-komplett.pdf ECCE book: Civil Engineering Profession in Europe 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [http://www.clge.eu/home Council of European Geodetic Surveyors (CLGE)] represents the interests of the geodetic surveying profession in the private and public sector from 31 countries of Europe. As of September 2009, the CLGE adopted the CLGE Code of Conduct of the European Surveyor and initiated the ratification process amongst members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clge.eu/newsletter/read/2009/2/ CLGE Code of Conduct of the European Surveyor]&lt;/ref&gt; It 'highly recommends that European surveyors hold
professional indemnity insurance'.&lt;ref&gt;Article 3, sec. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

== United Kingdom ==
In the United Kingdom, where a professional body is a [[public body]] within the meaning of the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] (such as is the case with [[medicine]], the [[legal profession]], and [[financial services]]), its professional conduct machinery must conform to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;Harris 2011, annex&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pulhamite''' was a [[patented]] [[anthropic rock]] material invented by James Pulham (1820–98) of the firm [[James Pulham and Son]] of [[Broxbourne]] in [[Hertfordshire]].

Pulhamite, which usually looked like gritty [[sandstone]],  was used to join natural rocks together or crafted to simulate natural stone features. It was so realistic that it fooled some geologists of the era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gardens and Landscapes in Historic Building Conservation|page=460|author=Marion Harney|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2014|isbn=1118508130}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recipe went to the grave with him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pulham.org.uk/ The Pulham Legacy]&lt;/ref&gt; Modern analysis of surviving original Pulhamite have shown it to be a blend of sand,

'''''Religion Explained: The Evolutionary Origins of Religious Thought''''' is a 2001 book by [[Cognitive anthropology|cognitive anthropologist]] [[Pascal Boyer]], in which the author discusses the [[evolutionary psychology of religion]] and [[evolutionary origin of religions]].

==Synopsis==
Boyer describes the genesis of religious concepts as a phenomenon of the mind's [[cognitive]] [[inference]] systems, comparable to [[pareidolia]] and [[perceptions of religious imagery in natural phenomena]] resulting from [[face perception]] processes within the [[human brain]]. Boyer supports this naturalistic origin of religion with evidence from many specialized disciplines including [[biological anthropology]], [[cultural anthropology]], [[cognitive science]], [[linguistics]], [[evolutionary biology]], [[cognitive psychology]], [[evolutionary psychology]], [[neuroscience]], and [[information processing]].

''Religion Explained'' frames religious practices and beliefs in terms of recent [[cognitive neuroscience]] research in the [[modularity of mind]]. This theory involves cognitive "modules" ("devices" or "subroutines") underlying inference systems and intuitions. For instance, Boyer suggests culturally-widespread beliefs in "supernatural agents" (e.g., gods, ancestors, spirits, and witches) result from [[agent detection]]: the intuitive modular process of assuming intervention by conscious agents, regardless of whether they are present. "When we see branches moving in a tree or when we hear an unexpected sound behind us, we immediately infer that some agent is the cause of this salient event. We can do that without any specific description of what the agent actually is."&lt;ref&gt;Boyer 2001:144,&lt;/ref&gt; Boyer cites [[E. E. Evans-Pritchard]]'s classic [[Zande people|Zande]] story about a termite-infested roof collapsing.
&lt;blockquote&gt;For the anthropologist, the house caved in because of the termites. For the Zande, it was quite clear that witchcraft was involved. However, the Zande were also aware that the termites were the proximate cause of the incident. But what they wanted to know was why it happened at that particular time, when particular people were gathered in the house.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, 2001:196, cf. 2001:12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Within Boyer's hypothesis, religion is a "parasite" (or "[[spandrel (biology)|spandrel]]") offshoot from cognitive modules, comparable to the way the [[Reading (process)|reading]] process is parasitic upon [[language module]]s.
&lt;blockquote&gt;As I have pointed out repeatedly the building of religious concepts requires mental systems and capacities that are there anyway, religious concepts or not. Religious morality uses moral intuitions, religious notions of supernatural agents recruit our intuitions about agency in general, and so on. This is why I said that religious concepts are parasitic upon other mental capacities. Our capacities to play music, paint pictures or even make sense of printed ink-patterns on a page are also parasitic in this sense. This means that we can explain how people play music, paint pictures and learn to read by examining how mental capacities are recruited by these activities. The same goes for religion. Because the concepts require all sorts of specific human capacities (an intuitive psychology, a tendency to attend to some counterintuitive concepts, as well as various social mind adaptations), we can explain religion by describing how these various capacities get recruited, how they contribute to the features of religion that we find in so many different cultures. We do not need to assume that there is a special way of functioning that occurs only when processing religious thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, 2001:311.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Boyer admits his explanation of religion 
&lt;blockquote&gt;is ''not'' a quick, shoot-from-the-hip solution of the kind that many people, either religious or not, seem to favor. There cannot be a magic bullet to explain the existence and common features of religion, as the phenomenon is the result of ''aggregate relevance'' – that is, of successful activation of a whole variety of mental systems.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer 2001:298, italics in original.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reviews and criticisms==
{{summarize section|date=January 2011}}
Critical reception of ''Religion Explained'' has been mixed.

[[Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi]], a professor of developmental psychology at the [[University of Haifa]], called the book "a milestone on the road to a new behavioral understanding of religion, basing itself on what has come to be known as cognitive anthropology, and pointedly ignoring much work done over the past one hundred years in the behavioral study of religion and in the psychological anthropology of religion."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.human-nature.com/nibbs/02/boyer.html Book Review: Religion Explained] ''Human Nature Review'' 2002 Volume 2: 308–309 (22 July)&lt;/ref&gt; 
He continues: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The clearest virtue of this book is that of dealing with the real thing. Even today, most scholarly work on religion consists of apologetics in one form or another, and we are deluged by offers of grants to study "spirituality" or teach "religion and science". This all serves to make us forget that religion is a collection of fantasies about spirits, and Boyer indeed aims to teach us about the world of the spirits in the grand tradition of the Enlightenment. Any general introduction to the world of the spirits must be ambitious because it hasn't been done and also because it has been done intuitively by all of us.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[David Klinghoffer]], a journalist and [[intelligent design]] proponent, wrote in the ''[[National Review]]'' that "Boyer's talk of 'religion is suspiciously generic" and describes his work as "professorial noodlings" that attempt to raise the question whether "all religions are somehow the same". He further claims that "debunkers like Boyer ... have their own unconscious motivations (to undermine religious faith, after all, is to set oneself free of its many inconvenient strictures)."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080421220616/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_19_53/ai_78692094/pg_2 Faith no more—Religion Explained: The Evolutionary Origins of Religious Thought—Review]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Shermer]], founder of [[The Skeptics Society]], described Boyer's book as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;a penetratingly insightful scientific analysis of religion because as an anthropologist he understands that any explanation must take into account the rich diversity of religious practices and beliefs around the world, and as a scientist he knows that any explanatory model must account for this diversity. Boyer is at his ethnographic best in describing the countless peculiar religious rituals he and his anthropological brethren have recorded, and especially in identifying the shortcomings of virtually every explanation for religion ever offered. … As a consequence, however, Boyer himself fails to provide a satisfactory explanation because he knows that religion is not a single entity resulting from a single cause.&lt;ref&gt;Shermer, Michael. 2001. ''How We Believe: Science, Skepticism, and the Search for God'', 2nd ed., Macmillan, p 256.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Brigitte Schön, a theology professor at the [[University of Bonn]], wrote,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Apart from being fascinating to read and containing many more highly original ideas than could be mentioned here, ''Religion explained'' is an important book for a number of reasons. First of all, Boyer is able to present a very dense network of theories which not only explains many religious phenomena but also sets them in relation to each other. The integration of cognitive science research leads to a very realistic model of how religious concepts are processed and communicated, something which has been conspicuously absent from most theories of religion so far. Boyer's account of the natural basis of religion explains very well the persistence and re-emergence of religion even in a secularized environment, as well as the tensions between official and folk religion.&lt;ref&gt;Brigitte Schön. [http://www.uni-marburg.de/fb03/ivk/mjr/pdfs/2002/reviews/rev_schoen_2002.pdf "''Religion Explained: The evolutionary origins of religious thought''"], ''Marburg Journal of Religion'' 2002 7.1:1–3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Garry Runciman, 3rd Viscount Runciman of Doxford|Garry Runciman]], sociologist at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], asked "Are we hardwired for God?"
&lt;blockquote&gt;The diverse beliefs which Boyer cites extend from Apollo and Athena, to shamanism among the Panamanian Cuna, to aliens from remote galaxies allegedly landing in New Mexico. But his central agenda is the particular set of unobservable causal agencies cited in his subtitle, and his primary concern is with the question of how we are to account for beliefs that involve the attribution of conscious agency to beings other than humans and animals of the normal and familiar kind. Such beliefs are, as Boyer says, remarkably widespread, and for all their variant forms the variation is neither limitless nor random. His answer falls into two parts: first, these beliefs have in common a counterintuitive attribution of a certain range of properties to certain kinds of quasihuman being; second, the explanation of their diffusion and persistence is to be sought not in the extensive anthropological literature about the origins and functions of religion, but in recent advances in developmental, cognitive and evolutionary psychology.&lt;ref&gt;W.G. Runciman. [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/feb/07/londonreviewofbooks/print Are we hardwired for God?], ''London Review of Books'', July 2, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Author and economist [[Zachary Karabell]] found stylistic faults. "Boyer's use of cognitive psychology, anthropology and other disciplines does generate a new template for examining old questions. But his method, however compelling, does not save the book from its considerable flaws. To begin with, the writing is frequently impenetrable." He concludes, "Of course, Boyer may be right. Human existence may simply be a story of living, breathing, eating and dying. But by not grappling with the possibility that a nonmaterial realm exists, Boyer has written a book about religion that is occasionally illuminating and utterly unconvincing."&lt;ref&gt;Zachary Karabell. [http://www.rivertwice.com/articles/pdfs/A_True_Believer_%20in_Science_Offers_a_Lopsided_Look_LAT.pdf A True Believer in Science Offers a Lopsided Look at Faith; ''RELIGION EXPLAINED: The Evolutionary Origins of Religious Thought'', By Pascal Boyer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715191026/http://www.rivertwice.com/articles/pdfs/A_True_Believer_%20in_Science_Offers_a_Lopsided_Look_LAT.pdf |date=2011-07-15 }}, ''Los Angeles Times'' June 16, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[comparative religion]] author [[Karen Armstrong]] reviewed Boyer's thesis.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Religion, he argues, is nothing more or less than a by-product of the human mind. It is a side effect of having a particular kind of brain. By far the most fascinating part of this highly accessible and informative book is Boyer's description of the way our minds work. We have an inbuilt set of ontological expectations and a tendency to dwell on intuitions which violate these, such as mountains that float or companions whom we do not see. From the dawn of modern consciousness, men and women have focused on certain imaginary personalities that transcend the norm, convinced that they can help them in strategic ways. These supernatural agents link with other mental systems, such as our moral intuitions and social categories, for which we can find no conceptual justification.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Armstrong, [http://www.asa3.org/archive/asa/200109/0070.html ''Religion Explained'' by Pascal Boyer], ''The Times'', August 29, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[John Habgood, Baron Habgood|John Habgood]], formerly [[Archbishop of York]], wrote.
&lt;blockquote&gt;This is a bold and far-reaching book. What its author lacks in modesty, he makes up for in cogency of argument and elegance of style. His "explanation" of religion is lucid, entertaining, full of valuable insights and almost, but not quite, convincing. The usual explanations of religion—as an attempt to explain what is otherwise puzzling, as a provider of comfort, as a good thing for society or as an escape from reason—are quickly dismissed. Pascal Boyer seeks to demonstrate that its origins and motivations are more deep seated in our mental structures than any of these, which is why religion is so universal, so powerful and so unlikely to disappear even though, as he also claims, it is in the end only a mental phenomenon. Recent experience of the dreadful consequences of religious fanaticism gives his analysis a frightening contemporary relevance, not least because of the minor role within religion that he assigns to rationality.&lt;ref&gt;John Habgood, [http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=166258&amp;sectioncode=40 "Parasite of airy nothings?"], ''Times Higher Education'', 14 December 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2165">The '''Rio Declaration on Environment and Development''', often shortened to '''Rio Declaration''', was a short document produced at the 1992 [[United Nations]] "Conference on Environment and Development" (UNCED), informally known as the [[Earth Summit]]. The Rio Declaration consisted of 27 principles intended to guide countries in future [[sustainable development]]. It was signed by over 170 countries.

==History==
The international community met twice to assess the progress made in implementing the principles of the document; first in New York in 1997 during a General Assembly Session of the UN, and then in [[Johannesburg]] in 2002. While the document helped to raise environmental awareness, evidence shows that little has been achieved in the document's environmental goals.&lt;ref name="Robbins2007"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Palmer |first1=Robert |last2=Nursey-Bray |first2=Melissa |editor1-last=Robbins |editor1-first=Paul |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Environment and Society |volume=4 |date=2007 |publisher=Sage Publications |location=Thousand Oaks |isbn=9781412927611 |pages=1512–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==

The Rio Declaration proclaims 27 principles. It includes formulations of the [[precautionary principle]] (principle 15) and of the [[polluter pays principle]] (principle 16).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5938">'''Settlement archaeology''' (German:''Siedlungsarchäologie'') is a branch of modern [[archaeology]]. It investigates former settlements and deserted areas, forms of housing and settlements, and the prehistoric settlement of entire regions. For this purpose, the forms, functions and developments of individual habitats and settlement systems are explored by means of archaeological surveys and excavation. Settlement archaeology has developed in close cooperation with settlement history and settlement geography. Settlement sequences of several centuries or millennia are explored in individual areas. Changes and consistent elements can be studied and compared with other researched settlements. Archaeological methods are used including [[archaeobotany]] and [[Archaeozoology|-zoology]] and [[Spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] [[phosphate]] analysis to resolve archaeological questions, mostly in the field of prehistory and early history.

==Settlement archaeology as the archaeology of peoples==  
The term settlement archaeology initially referred to a research methodology whose most important exponent was [[Gustaf Kossinna]], who developed his "settlement archaeology method" beginning in 1887. According to Kossinna and his disciples, [[Archaeological culture|cultures]], [[cultural area]]s and, ultimately, settlement areas of ethnic groups can be deduced through types and their [[Assemblage (archaeology)|assemblages]]. This equation of "archaeological culture", ethnicity, and race led, especially during [[National Socialist]] rule, to a fateful and alarming combination of archaeological research with racial ideology. One of the core tenets of Kossina's teaching was that sharply defined archaeological cultural areas coincide at all times with particular peoples (''Völkern'') or tribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kossinna |first1=Gustaf |title=Die Herkunft der Germanen: zur methode der Siedlungsarchäologie |date=1911 |publisher=C. Kabitzsch |location=Würzburg | language=de|page=3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DLiYugEACAAJ}}"Scharf umgrenzte archäologische Kulturprovinzen decken sich zu allen Zeiten mit ganz bestimmten Völkern oder Völkerstämmen"&lt;/ref&gt; When asked about the "ethnic interpretation" of prehistoric finds, answers were sought by linking "archaeological" with "historical" methods. Kossinna said that the basis of his "settlement archaeological method" was that it makes use of analogy which enlightens dimly-illuminated ancient times by inferences from the better-known present or even ages which, though still ancient, are marked by rich tradition. It illuminates prehistoric times by those which stand in the light of history.&lt;ref&gt;"sich des Analogieschlußes [bedient], insofern sie die Erhellung uralter, dunkler Zeiten durch Rückschlüsse aus der klaren Gegenwart oder aus zwar ebenfalls noch alten, jedoch durch reiche Überlieferung ausgezeichneten Epochen vornimmt. Sie erhellt vorgeschichtliche Zeiten durch solche, die in geschichtlichem Lichte stehen.“&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Postwar|Postwar Era]] the empirical collecting of facts and their chronological and spatial arrangement was declared the main goal of research, which set the final course for today's German archaeology. Theoretical approaches moved to the background.

==Modern settlement archeology==  
Since the 1920s more and more works have emerged in which individual regions have been archaeologically researched. At the same time, more emphasis was placed on investigating the settlements themselves. Researchers such as [[Gerhard Bersu]], Hermann Stoll, and Robert Rudolf Schmidt, who worked mainly in southern Germany, were among this pioneering phase of modern settlement archeology. The excavations at the [[Federsee]], for example, involved the natural sciences at an early stage ([[pollen analysis]] (Palynology), moor geology and [[geomorphology]], [[dendrochronology]], [[radiocarbon dating]], [[archaeozoology]] and [[archaeobotany]], [[paleoclimatology]], material research, etc.). However, especially during the [[Third Reich]] under the direction of [[Hans Reinerth]], the ideological abuse of settlement archaeology was particularly evident. In the end, however, important impulses for the establishment and methodical definition came mainly from the north: the excavations in Haithabu ([[Hedeby]] as well as the investigations at Wurten on the North Sea coast such as [[Feddersen Wierde]] near [[Cuxhaven]] by Werner Haarnagel were seminal. The archaeologist [[Herbert Jankuhn]] is associated with the formulation of this redefinition of settlement archeology.  Jankuhn was a proponent of Kossinna's methods of settlement archeology during the period of in [[National Socialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mahsarski |first1=Dirk |title=Herbert Jankuhn (1905 - 1990) : ein deutscher Prähistoriker zwischen nationalsozialistischer Ideologie und wissenschaftlicher Objektivität | language=de |url=https://www.academia.edu/12776827/Herbert_Jankuhn_1905_-_1990_ein_deutscher_Pr%C3%A4historiker_zwischen_nationalsozialistischer_Ideologie_und_wissenschaftlicher_Objektivit%C3%A4t_Dirk_Mahsarski._-_Rahden_Westf._Leidorf_2011._-_VI_381_S._Ill._30_cm._-_Internationale_Arch%C3%A4ologie_114_._-_ISBN_978-3-89646-459-0_EUR_64.80 |website=academia.edu |accessdate=Oct 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New trends==  
More recently the focus has increasingly been on the individual settlement and the aanalysis of landscapes and territories, mostly using [[geographic information system]]s (GIS). Today the term [[landscape archaeology]] is preferred. The long-standing role of natural sciences in settlement archeology has recently further increased, and [[geography]], [[geology]], [[zoology]], [[botany]], and [[anthropology]] have been increasingly used in the field of [[soil science]], which is reflected, for example, in the field of [[geoarchaeology]].

== Life and influence ==

He was born in the village of Konaka in present-day [[Sano, Tochigi|Sano]], [[Tochigi Prefecture]], and was the son of the village [[Village head|headman]]. In 1857, he became headman after his father and served for twelve years.&lt;ref name="Perspectives"/&gt;{{rp|113}} In 1879, he founded the ''Tochigi Shimbun'', a periodical in which he discussed human rights and contemporary issues.&lt;ref name="n"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Nihon Daihyakka Zensho (Nipponika) |title=田中正造 |url=http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |accessdate=2013-11-08 |year=2013 |publisher=Shogakukan |location=Tokyo |language=Japanese |trans-title=Shōzō Tanaka |oclc=153301537 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825113418/http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |archivedate=August 25, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tanaka became a member of the Tochigi Prefectural Assembly in 1880, and its Chairman in 1886.&lt;ref name="NDL"/&gt; In the [[Japanese general election, 1890|general election of 1890]], the first ever held in Japan, he was elected to the [[House of Representatives (Japan)|House of Representatives]] as a member of the [[Rikken Kaishintō]], a liberal political party.&lt;ref name="NDL"/&gt;
 
Tanaka is best known for his advocacy in connection with the pollution caused by waste from the [[Ashio Copper Mine]].&lt;ref name="Letter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timescolonist.com/anti-nuclear-japanese-lawmaker-attacked-from-all-sides-for-handing-letter-to-emperor-akihito-1.687774|title=Anti-nuclear Japanese lawmaker attacked from all sides for handing letter to Emperor Akihito|author=Mari Yamaguchi|publisher=Associated Press|date=November 7, 2013|accessdate=November 8, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140224125726/http://www.timescolonist.com/anti-nuclear-japanese-lawmaker-attacked-from-all-sides-for-handing-letter-to-emperor-akihito-1.687774|archivedate=February 24, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting from the mid-1880s, rivers near the mine became highly polluted and in 1890 a large flood carried poisonous wastes from the mine into surrounding areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.unu.edu/unupress/unupbooks/uu35ie/uu35ie04.htm|title=The Ashio Copper mine pollution case: The origins of environmental destruction, Ch. 1, Sec.

A '''swale''' is a shallow channel with gently sloping sides.  A swale may be either natural or human created. Artificial swales are often [[infiltration basin]]s, designed to manage water [[surface runoff|runoff]], filter [[water pollution|pollutants]], and increase rainwater [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]].&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Washington, DC (1999). [http://www.epa.gov/owm/mtb/vegswale.pdf "Storm Water Technology Fact Sheet: Vegetated Swales."] EPA Document No. 832-F-99-006. September 1999. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090722234524/http://www.epa.gov/owm/mtb/vegswale.pdf |date=July 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The swale concept has also been popularized as a [[rainwater harvesting]] and [[soil conservation]] strategy by [[Bill Mollison]], [[Geoff Lawton]] and other advocates of [[permaculture]]. In this context it is usually a water-harvesting ditch on contour, also called a ''contour [[Bunding|bund]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
  | title = Water Harvesting: Microcatchment Contour Bunds | publisher = [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] | url = http://www.fao.org/teca/content/water-harvesting-microcatchment-contour-bunds-ridge | accessdate = 2009-11-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Soil contour bunds | publisher = [[United Nations Office for Project Services]] | date = 1998 | url = http://www.mamud.com/Docs/contbu3e.pdf | format = [[PDF]] | accessdate = 2009-11-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Swale NSG-Eldena Sept-2008 SL271623.JPG|thumb|left|A natural swale]]

Swales as used in permaculture are designed to slow and capture runoff by spreading it horizontally across the landscape (along an [[elevation]] [[contour line]]), facilitating runoff infiltration into the soil.  This type of swale is created by digging a ditch on contour and piling the dirt on the downhill side of the ditch to create a [[berm]]. 

In arid climates, vegetation (existing or planted) along the swale can benefit from the concentration of runoff. Trees and shrubs along the swale can provide shade and mulch which decrease evaporation.

The term swale or "beach swale" is also used to describe long, narrow, usually shallow troughs between ridges or [[sandbar]]s on a beach, that run parallel to the shoreline.&lt;ref&gt;Michigan State University Extension.[http://web1.msue.msu.edu/iosco/openshoreline.htm "Wetlands of the Great Lakes Open Shoreline and Embayed Wetlands."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100731181130/http://web1.msue.msu.edu/iosco/openshoreline.htm |date=2010-07-31 }} Retrieved 2009-09-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Technology trajectory''' refers to a single branch in the evolution of a technological design of a product/service, with nodes representing separate designs.

Movement along the technology trajectory is associated with research and development. Due to institutionalisation of ideas, markets and professions, a technology development can get 'stuck' within one trajectory, and firms and engineers unable to adopt to ideas and innovation from outside.

'''The Dot ''' is a work of art in [[Emmen (Drenthe)|Emmen]] ([[Netherlands]]). It is designed and painted by art collective the [[toyism|toyists]]. The Dot is a former gas container of which only two still exist in Europe. The toyists painted this monumental industrial object and linked it with the theme of Live with energy.

==History==
Toyist Dejo (founder of [[Toyism]]) came up with the idea of painting the gas globe in Emmen in 1997. After the first meetings in 2005 with the owner of the gas container, energy company [[Essent]] (later called Enexis), it would still take until 2008 before the project could finally be put in motion. This was partly due to the establishment of the foundation Living Industry , which deals with the reuse of industrial properties and the redevelopment of industrial sites. After the municipality of Emmen agreed with the project, a scaffolding of eight stories was built around the 22 meter high gas container. On the 27th of July the artist started the project of painting The Dot.&lt;ref&gt;Beek, W. van der (2012), Toyism behind the mask. Zwolle: Publisher Uitgeverij De Kunst, pp. 116. {{ISBN|978-94-91196-20-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Voormalige_gasbol.jpg|thumb|links|150px|Former gas container]]

==Transformation==
The transformation of the former (blue) gas container took several months to complete, from mid July 2009 until the unveiling on June 4 in 2010, with a winter break of two months. The project had 17 toyists from 7 different countries working for 6000 hours, they painted an area of 1250 m2 in multiple layers.&lt;ref&gt;Beek, W. van der (2012), Toyism behind the mask. Zwolle: Publisher Uitgeverij De Kunst, pp. 61. {{ISBN|978-94-91196-20-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theme==
The theme of this art work is live with energy. Figurative imagery in the painting tells the story of the history of energy production. There are four sub designs based on the four elements of life: earth (raw energy), water (hydroelectric power), fire (solar energy) and air (wind power). Each sub-design presents the combination or contrast of old and new forms of energy production and their applications (the sciences). In addition to these four fundamental themes, there is a single, central figure: the tree. The tree is a metaphor for life, energy, growth, development, and change. The province of Drenthe with its rich history of peat production is also represented in the painting. In addition, in the form of standalone motifs, general applications or containers of energy such as ecobunny lights and battery-insects can be seen moving throughout the whole painting.&lt;ref&gt;Beek, W. van der (2012), Toyism behind the mask. Zwolle: Publisher Uitgeverij De Kunst, pp. 108. {{ISBN|978-94-91196-20-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:THE DOT Live with Energy - Toyism.jpg|500px|Design of The Dot]]

==Restoration==
In the summer of 2015 The Dot was repainted. Over the years the paint had peeled off and The Dot needed to be restored to its former state. The toyists set up a crowdfunding project and, when enough money was collected, started the restoration.

In 2013 the toyists did a similar project in Keflavik, Iceland called [[Uppspretta]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3148">In [[political science]], international and comparative [[law]] and [[economics]], '''transitology''' is the name for the study of the process of change from one political [[regime]] to another, mainly from [[authoritarian]] regimes to [[democracy|democratic]] ones.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Transitology tries to explain processes of [[democratization]] in a variety of contexts, from bureaucratic authoritarianism and other forms of dictatorship in [[Latin America]], [[southern Europe]] and [[northern Africa]] to [[postcommunist]] developments in [[eastern Europe]]. The debate has become something of an academic "turf-war" between [[Comparative politics|comparative studies]] and [[area studies]] scholars, while highlighting several problematic features of [[social science]] [[methodology]], including [[generalization]], an overemphasis on [[elite]] attitudes and behavior, [[Eurocentrism]], the role of [[history]] in explaining [[causality]], and the inability to produce testable [[hypotheses]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/2501122]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''University of Missouri''' (also, '''Mizzou''', or '''MU''') is a [[public university|public]], [[Land-grant university|land-grant]] research university in [[Columbia, Missouri]].  It was founded in 1839 as the first public institution of higher education west of the [[Mississippi River]]. As the state's largest university, it enrolled 30,870 students in 2017,&lt;ref name="enroll2017"/&gt; offering over 300 degree programs in 20 academic colleges.&lt;ref name=Undergraduate&gt;{{cite web |url=http://missouri.edu/colleges-schools/ |title=Colleges and Schools |publisher=University of Missouri |accessdate=August 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the flagship campus of the [[University of Missouri System]], which also has campuses in [[University of Missouri–Kansas City|Kansas City]], [[Missouri University of Science and Technology|Rolla]], and [[University of Missouri–St. Louis|St. Louis]].

MU is one of the nation's top research institutions and one of the 34 public universities that are members of the [[Association of American Universities]]. There are more than 300,000 MU alumni living worldwide with over one half residing in Missouri.&lt;ref name=Alumni&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mizzoumag.missouri.edu/2016/02/300k |title=Mizzou |publisher=Missouri Alumni Association |accessdate=April 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university was ranked 103rd among national universities in the 2016 ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' rankings.

Starting in December 1953, it operates the country's only university-owned TV network ([[NBC]]) affiliate ([[KOMU-TV|KOMU]]), operated by the [[Missouri School of Journalism]].&lt;ref name=Undergraduate /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://journalism.missouri.edu/2004/02/komu-celebrates-50-years-of-news-coverage-and-community-service-2/|title=KOMU Celebrates 50 Years of News Coverage and Community Service|last=|first=|date=February 9, 2004|work=[[Missouri School of Journalism]]|access-date=September 4, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, one of the first [[Journalism school|schools of journalism]] was founded by [[Walter Williams (journalist)|Walter Williams]] as the Missouri School of Journalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=World's First J-School Celebrates 100 Years| url=http://www.britannica.com/bps/additionalcontent/18/33306422/Worlds-First-JSchool-Celebrates-100-Years |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica| accessdate=November 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Missouri Research Reactor Center]] is the world's most powerful university research reactor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=J.

The athletics teams compete in [[NCAA Division I]] and are known as the [[Missouri Tigers]]. The [[Football Bowl Subdivision|FBS]] [[Missouri Tigers football team|football team]] in Missouri is the only FBS program in Missouri and it competes as a member of the [[Southeastern Conference]]. The school's mascot, [[Truman the Tiger]], is named after Missourian and former U.S. president [[Harry S. Truman]]. MU claims that the university held the first American football [[homecoming]] in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Brooke|first1=Eliza|title=The History of Homecoming|url=https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/59mmwa/the-history-of-homecoming |website=Vice: Broadly|publisher=Vice Magazine|accessdate=January 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of the University of Missouri}}

===Early years===
In 1839, the Missouri Legislature passed the [[Geyer Act]] to establish funds for a state university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = History of the Board of Curators| publisher= Archives of the University of Missouri|url=http://muarchives.missouri.edu/uw-rg1b.html |accessdate =November 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would be the first public university west of the [[Mississippi River]].&lt;ref name=MUHistory&gt;{{cite web|title =History of the University of Missouri-Columbia|publisher=Office of Web Communications |url=http://www.missouri.edu/about/history/mu-history.phpl| accessdate=November 19, 2009}}{{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; To secure the university, the citizens of Columbia and [[Boone County, Missouri|Boone County]] pledged $117,921 in cash and land to beat out five other central Missouri counties for the location of the state university.&lt;ref name=MUHistory /&gt;  The land on which the university was constructed was just south of Columbia's downtown and owned by [[James S. Rollins]]. He was later called the "Father of the University."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Founding father descendant establishes slavery atonement endowment |publisher=University Development |url=http://formizzou.missouri.edu/news/mering-gift.php |accessdate=November 19, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509122910/http://formizzou.missouri.edu/news/mering-gift.php |archivedate=May 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the first public university in the [[Louisiana Purchase]], the school was shaped by [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s ideas about public education.&lt;ref name=SystemHistory&gt;{{cite web| title =History of the University| publisher= Curators of the University of Missouri|url=http://www.umsystem.edu/ums/about/history/|accessdate=November 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1862 the [[American Civil War]] forced the university to close for much of the year.&lt;ref name=MUDates&gt;{{cite web| title=Significant Dates in the History of the University of Missouri| publisher= University Archives| url =http://muarchives.missouri.edu/sigdates.html| accessdate =November 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Residents of Columbia formed a Union "home guard" [[militia]] that became known as the "Fighting Tigers of Columbia". They were given the name for their readiness to protect the city and university. In 1890, the university's newly formed football team took the name the [[Missouri Tigers|"Tigers"]] after the Civil War militia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Border War Rages On| publisher=Missouri Civil War Museum| url=http://www.mcwm.org/history_mizzoukansas.html| accessdate=November 19, 2009| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091125214159/http://www.mcwm.org/history_mizzoukansas.html| archivedate=November 25, 2009| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1870 the institution was granted [[land-grant college]] status under the [[Morrill Land-Grant Acts|Morrill Act]] of 1862.&lt;ref name=SystemHistory /&gt;  The act led to the founding of the Missouri School of Mines and Metallurgy as an offshoot of the main campus in Columbia. It developed as the present-day [[Missouri University of Science and Technology]].&lt;ref name=SystemHistory /&gt; In 1888 the Missouri Agricultural Experiment Station opened. This grew to encompass ten centers and research farms around Missouri.&lt;ref name=MUHistory /&gt;  By 1890 the university encompassed a [[normal college]] (for training of teachers of students through high school), engineering college, arts and science college, school of agriculture and mechanical arts. school of medicine, and school of law.&lt;ref name=MUDates /&gt;

===1892–present===
[[File:Academic Hall Fire.jpg|thumb|Fire at [[Academic Hall]], 1892]]
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:CoMoMuPano.JPG|thumb|Painting of the Red Campus soon after the construction of [[Jesse Hall]]]] --&gt;

[[File:Students_at_Missouri_State_University,_today's_U_of_M,_as_drawn_by_Marguerite_Martyn,_1910.jpg|thumb|upright|Journalist [[Marguerite Martyn]] visited the campus in 1910 and sketched these two fashionable students with the architectural columns behind them. At that time, the campus was known as ''Missouri State University.'']]
On January 9, 1892, [[Academic Hall]], the institution's main building, burned in a fire that gutted the building, leaving little more standing than six stone [[Ionic columns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=History of the Columns| publisher= University of Missouri Office of Web Communications| url =http://www.missouri.edu/about/history/columns.php| accessdate =November 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the administration of [[Governor of Missouri|Missouri Governor]] [[David R. Francis]], the university was rebuilt, with additions that shaped the modern institution.

After the fire, some state residents tried to have the university moved further west to [[Sedalia, Missouri|Sedalia]]; but Columbia rallied support to keep it.  The columns were retained as a symbol of the historic campus.  Today they are surrounded by the [[Francis Quadrangle]], the oldest part of campus. At the quad's southern end is [[Academic Hall]]'s replacement, [[Jesse Hall]], named for [[Richard Henry Jesse|Richard Jesse]] (the president of the university at the time of the fire). Built in 1895, Jesse Hall holds many administrative offices and Jesse Auditorium. The buildings surrounding the quad were constructed of red brick, leading to this area becoming known as [[Red Campus]]. The area was tied together in planned landscaping and walks in 1910 by [[George Kessler]] in a [[City Beautiful movement|City Beautiful]] design of the grounds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgekessler.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=31&amp;Itemid=43 georgekessler.org – Retrieved July 13, 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808051207/http://www.georgekessler.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=31&amp;Itemid=43 |date=August 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesse Hall is scheduled for a $9.8 mil. makeover to include a fire sprinkler system, work on its elevators, and a new heating and cooling system as part of a $92 mil. total renovation package the Board of Curators approved in June 2013. This upgrade is expected to be completed in March 2015.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/education/million-in-campus-upgrades-headed-for-mizzou/article_6e680f15-8c22-558e-8020-05117c9b5148.html|title=$92 Million in Campus Upgrades Headed for Mizzou|last=Barker|first=Tim|date=June 13, 2013|work=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To the east of the quadrangle, later buildings constructed of white limestone in 1913 and 1914 to accommodate the new academic programs became known as the White Campus. In 1908 the world's first journalism school opened at MU. It became notable for its "Missouri Method" of hands-on, experience-based instruction. It later established an award for "Distinguished Journalism".

In April 1923, a black janitor was accused of the rape of the daughter of a University of Missouri professor. James T. Scott was abducted from the Boone County jail by a mob of townsfolk and students, and was [[lynching|lynched]] to death from a bridge near the campus before his trial took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.chronicle.com/blogs/ticker/local-leaders-mark-1923-lynching-of-u-of-missouri-janitor/28206|title=Local Leaders Mark 1923 Lynching of U. of Missouri Janitor|last=Mytelka|first=Andrew|date=November 9, 2010|work=[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the winter of 1935, four graduates of [[Lincoln University (Missouri)|Lincoln University]]—a [[historically black colleges and universities|traditionally black school]] about {{convert|30|mi|km|0}} away in [[Jefferson City, Missouri|Jefferson City]]—were denied admission to MU's graduate school. One of the students, [[Lloyd L. Gaines]], brought his case to the [[United States Supreme Court]]. On December 12, 1938, in a landmark 6–2 decision, the court ordered the State of Missouri to admit Gaines to MU's law school or provide a facility of equal stature. Gaines disappeared in Chicago on March 19, 1939, under suspicious circumstances. The university granted Gaines a posthumous honorary law degree in May 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.columbiatribune.com/2006/may/20060514News023.asp "MU awards law degree to kin of rights pioneer"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150828060131/http://archive.columbiatribune.com/2006/may/20060514News023.asp |date=August 28, 2015 }} by Alan Scher Zagier, ''Columbia Daily Tribune'', May 14, 2006, retrieved on August 15, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Undergraduate divisions were integrated by court order in 1950, when the university was compelled to admit African Americans to courses that were not offered at Lincoln University.

On June 5, 1935, the university erected a memorial to the Confederate soldiers of Missouri popularly known as the Confederate Rock. The monument was removed in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Confederate Rock|url=http://umcspace.missouri.edu/historic/buildings/ConfederateRock/general.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530070350/http://umcspace.missouri.edu/historic/buildings/ConfederateRock/general.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=May 30, 2010|website=MU in Brick and Mortar|publisher=University of Missouri|accessdate=November 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II, the enrollment at universities around the country grew at an extraordinary pace, and MU was no exception. This was due in part to the [[G.I. Bill]], which allowed veterans to attend college with the assistance of the federal government.

Following the [[2015–16 University of Missouri protests]], the chancellor and [[University of Missouri System|System president]] resigned, amid racial complaints by students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wibw.com/home/headlines/The-Latest-University-of-Missouri-System-president-resigns-343731172.html|title=University of Missouri Chancellor Follows President in Stepping Down|author=Viviani|first=Nick|date=November 9, 2015|website=[[WIBW-TV]]|publisher=|accessdate=November 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
[[File:University of Missouri - Memorial Union.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Tower of [[Memorial Union (University of Missouri)|Memorial Union]]]]

The campus of the University of Missouri is {{convert|1262|acre|sqmi ha|1|adj=on}}&lt;ref name="MissouriEDU" /&gt; just south of [[Downtown Columbia, Missouri|Downtown Columbia]] and is maintained as a [[botanical garden]]. The historical campus is centered on [[Francis Quadrangle]], a [[Historic districts in the United States|historic district]] listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], and contains a number of buildings on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

The academic buildings are classified into two main groups: [[Red Campus]] and White Campus. Red Campus is the historical core of mostly brick academic buildings around the landmark columns of the [[Francis Quadrangle]]; it includes Jesse Hall and [[Switzler Hall]]. In the early 20th century, the College of Agriculture began a period of rapid expansion in which several buildings were constructed to accommodate the growing program and student body. The new buildings, constructed in Neo-Gothic style from native Missouri [[limestone]], form the White Campus. Its most notable building is [[Memorial Union (University of Missouri)|Memorial Union]].

During the 1990s, Red Campus was extended to the south with the creation of the Carnahan Quadrangle. Hulston Hall of the [[University of Missouri School of Law]], completed in 1988, formed the eastern border of the future quad. The Reynolds Alumni Center was completed in 1992 on the west side of the new quad. It was completed in 2002 with Cornell Hall of the [[Trulaske College of Business]] and Tiger Plaza. Plans for a new plaza on the north end of the Carnahan Quadrangle were unveiled in 2014. Called Traditions Plaza, it was opened on October 25, 2014 during homecoming festivities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mizzou.com/s/1002/alumni/interior.aspx?sid=1002&amp;gid=1001&amp;pgid=4174|title=Traditions Plaza|last=|first=|date=|website=Mizzou Alumni Association|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602101723/http://www.mizzou.com/s/1002/alumni/interior.aspx?sid=1002&amp;gid=1001&amp;pgid=4174|archive-date=2016-06-02|dead-url=yes|accessdate=August 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the original MU intercollegiate athletic facilities, such as [[Rollins Field]] and Rothwell Gymnasium, were just south of the academic buildings, later expanded facilities were constructed across Stadium Boulevard, where [[Memorial Stadium (Columbia)|Memorial Stadium]] opened in 1926. The [[Hearnes Center]] was built to the east of the stadium in 1972. In 1994, the university developed the first draft of a master plan for the campus to tie together all of Tiger athletic facilities to the south of Stadium Boulevard and add to its design. Today, the MU Sports Park includes the [[Mizzou Arena]], [[Taylor Stadium]], [[Audrey J. Walton Stadium (Columbia, Missouri)|Walton Stadium]], Mizzou Athletics Training Complex, University Field and Devine Pavilion.  Student athletic facilities remain in the core area of campus. Rothwell Gymnasium and Brewer Fieldhouse are part of the {{convert|283579|sqft|m2|adj=on}} Student Recreation Center, which was ranked number one in the nation in 2005 by ''[[Sports Illustrated]].''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.colotime.com/pdf/University%20of%20Missouri.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.themaneater.com/stories/campus/rec-center-receives-national-recognition|title=Rec Center Receives National Attention|last=Lewis|first=Megan|date=February 17, 2012|work=[[The Maneater]]|access-date=September 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main campus of the [[University of Missouri Health Care|University of Missouri Hospitals and Clinics]] is north of the sports complex. It includes the [[University of Missouri Hospital]] and [[Truman Memorial Veterans Hospital]]. Two of the hospitals, [[Columbia Regional Hospital]] and [[Ellis Fischel Cancer Center]], are northeast of the main campus near I-70.

[[File:Mizzou TigerPlazaFountain.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A fountain and statue make up Tiger Plaza on the Carnahan Quadrangle.]]

To the south of the MU Sports Park is the MU Research Park. It includes the University of Missouri Research Reactor Center, International Institute for Nano and Molecular Medicine, MU Life Science Business Incubator at Monsanto Place, and Dalton Cardiovascular Research Center. In 2005, the University of Missouri Board of Curators approved legislation to designate the South Farm of the College of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources (CAFNR) as a research park. The {{convert|114|acre|ha|1|adj=on}} park, {{convert|3|mi|km|1|spell=in}} southeast of the main campus on US63, is now known as Discovery Ridge Research Park. Tenants at Discovery Ridge include ABC Laboratories and the MU Research Animal Diagnostic Laboratory.

The main campus is flanked to the east and west by Greek Life housing. The University of Missouri has nearly 50 national social fraternities and sororities, many of which occupy historical residences now valued in the millions of dollars. [[Beta Sigma Psi]], [[Kappa Alpha Order]], [[Sigma Chi]], [[Zeta Phi|Beta Theta Pi]], [[Alpha Gamma Rho]], [[Tau Kappa Epsilon]] and [[Sigma Nu]] form a Greek Row (also called Frat Row) along College Avenue in the [[East Campus (University of Missouri)|East Campus]] area. [[Delta Tau Delta]], [[Kappa Sigma]], [[Lambda Chi Alpha]], and [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]] are in the West Campus area along Stewart Street, which leads directly into the [[Francis Quadrangle]]. Most of the Greek-letter organizations are in a Greek Town, with approximately 30 Greek residences, to the north of Memorial Stadium.{{clear left}}

The main campus, along with all other MU-owned or operated facilities, is protected by the [[University of Missouri Police Department]], which is in the Virginia Avenue parking garage on the main campus.

In 1908, the [[Missouri School of Journalism]] (known colloquially as the "J-school"), was founded in Columbia, claiming to be the first of its kind internationally. The French established their ''[[Ecole Supérieure de Journalisme de Paris]]'' in 1899.&lt;ref name="esj-paris.com"&gt;[http://www.esj-paris.com "''École supérieure de journalisme''"], Official website {{fr}}, accessed July 4, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The UM System owns and operates [[KOMU-TV]], the [[NBC]]/[[The CW|CW]] affiliate for Columbia and nearby [[Jefferson City]]. It is a full-fledged commercial station and a working lab for journalism students. The MU School of Journalism publishes the ''[[Columbia Missourian]]'' and ''Vox Magazine,''&lt;ref&gt;Vox Magazine: http://www.voxmagazine.com/&lt;/ref&gt; where students learn reporting, editing and design in a newsroom managed by professional editors.  It operates the local National Public Radio Station KBIA and produces ''Radio Adelante'', a Spanish-language radio program.

Founded in 1978 after 23 years as a unit of the School of Medicine, the School of Health Professions became an autonomous division in December 2000. The school's five departments and eight accredited academic programs have a long history, some dating to the early 20th century. It is Missouri's only state-supported school of health professions on a campus with an academic health center, and the only allied health school in the UM system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://shp.missouri.edu/visitors/history.php "History of the School of Health Professions"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601154842/http://shp.missouri.edu/visitors/history.php |date=June 1, 2010 }}, University of Missouri&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[American Civil War]], Union troops used the Library in Academic Hall as a guard room. The Union troops caused significant damage, including taking 467 volumes to build fires. The Board of Curators later sued the US Army for the destruction on campus. Settled in 1915, the suit's award was used to build the Memorial Gateway on the northern edge of Red Campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://muarchives.missouri.edu/libraryex.html |title=The Heart of the University: MU Libraries |publisher=Muarchives.missouri.edu |accessdate=October 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913, construction began on a new main library, completed in 1915. It was expanded in 1935, 1958, and 1985. It was dedicated as Elmer Ellis Library on October 10, 1972, in honor of the thirteenth president of the University of Missouri. Today, the MU libraries are home to the 47th largest research collection in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mulibraries.missouri.edu/journalism/afflibraries.htm |title=JLib affiliated libraries |publisher=Mulibraries.missouri.edu |accessdate=October 8, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930190002/http://mulibraries.missouri.edu/journalism/afflibraries.htm |archivedate=September 30, 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jeffrey E. Smith Institute of Real Estate was founded in 2005 by a donation from alumnus Jeffrey Smith to meet the growing interest of students in the College of Business, seeking to learn more about the real estate industry.

===SECU: SEC Academic Initiative===
The University of Missouri is a member of the SEC Academic Consortium. Now renamed the [[Southeastern Conference#The formation of SECU and SEC academic network|SECU]], the initiative was a collaborative endeavor designed to promote research, scholarship and achievement amongst the member universities in the [[Southeastern conference]]. The SECU formed its mission to serve as a means to bolster collaborative academic endeavors of [[Southeastern Conference#Member universities|Southeastern Conference universities]]. Its goals include highlighting the endeavors and achievements of SEC [[Faculty (academic staff)|faculty]], students and its universities and advancing the academic reputation of SEC universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SECU|url=http://www.secsymposium.com/secu.php|publisher=SEC|accessdate=February 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SECU: The Academic Initiative of the SEC |url=http://www.secdigitalnetwork.com/AcademicConsortium |publisher=SEC Digital Network |accessdate=February 13, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120721055557/http://www.secdigitalnetwork.com/AcademicConsortium |archivedate=July 21, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the University of Missouri participated in the SEC Symposium in [[Atlanta]] which was organized and led by the [[University of Georgia]] and the [[University of Georgia#UGA Bioenergy Systems Research Institute|UGA Bioenergy Systems Research Institute]].

The University of Missouri is organized into seven colleges, eleven schools and hosts approximately 300 majors.

===Name===
Upon creation of the system, each university was renamed with its host city; thus, the university in Columbia became the University of Missouri–Columbia. In the proceeding decades, colloquial and verbal usage of the generic name in reference to MU continued. There were attempts to drop Columbia from its name by students, faculty, alumni, and administrators who felt it might cause the university to be perceived as a regional institution. This change was long resisted by the UM System and the other universities on the basis of uniformity and fairness. However, after a renewed effort for "name restoration", the Board of Curators voted unanimously on November 29, 2007 to allow MU to drop Columbia from its name for all public use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.missouri.edu/news/name-restoration.php |title=UM Curators recognize historic status of MU |publisher=Missouri.edu |accessdate=October 8, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927014957/http://www.missouri.edu/news/name-restoration.php |archivedate=September 27, 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Continued use of the name University of Missouri–Columbia is not incorrect but is being phased out by MU, except as required on official internal documents within the UM System. Its use also continues to be advocated by some faculty, administration, and alumni of UMKC, UMSL, and Missouri S&amp;T.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://archive.columbiatribune.com/2007/Nov/20071130News002.asp| title=MU name deal ruffles some feathers| publisher=[[Columbia Daily Tribune]]| accessdate=November 19, 2009| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716135449/http://archive.columbiatribune.com/2007/Nov/20071130News002.asp| archivedate=July 16, 2011| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.themaneater.com/stories/campus/umsl-opposes-mu-name-change|title=UMSL Opposes MU Name Change|last=Njus|first=Elliot|date=September 21, 2007|work=[[The Maneater]]|access-date=November 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presidents and chancellors===
Each campus of the [[University of Missouri System]] is led by a [[chancellor (education)|chancellor]], who reports to the [[University president|president]] of the UM System. Prior to the formation of the system in 1963, the Columbia campus and its offshoot in [[Missouri University of Science and Technology|Rolla]] were led directly by the president and the position of chancellor did not exist. The below contains a list of presidents from 1963–present but does not include [[interim]] presidents or chancellors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://muarchives.missouri.edu/indexLeaders.html |title=University of Missouri Leaders |publisher=Muarchives.missouri.edu |date=September 10, 2002 |accessdate=October 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umsystem.edu/ums/president/former.shtml Former presidents of the University of Missouri] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819142254/http://www.umsystem.edu/ums/president/former.shtml |date=August 19, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  John Lathrop is the only president or chancellor to have served nonconsecutive terms.

† Ellis became president of the University of Missouri System upon its creation, serving until 1966.

==Student life==

===Residential life===
The University of Missouri operates 23 on-campus residence halls and least two other off-campus sites.  The two off-campus locations include: Tiger Diggs at Campus View Apartments and True Scholars House.  Many residence halls on campus offer learning communities and freshman interest groups.  Both programs seek to ensure students succeed academically while living in the residence halls.

Three of the older halls: Jones, Lathrop, and Laws are scheduled to be torn down and replaced as the largest and first part ($71 mil.) of a $92 mil. campus improvement project approved by the Board of Curators on June 13, 2013. The plan also includes replacing the dining hall north of [[Faurot Field]]. The three halls presently can house up to 1,010 students. The new halls will expand the capacity to 1,242 by the time the first part is completed in May 2017. The renovation of Swallow Hall (1893) is also part of the plan, costing $11.5 mil. of the total.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Two residence halls, Excellence and Respect will be on standby starting in the Fall 2016 semester, and only used if necessary because Fall enrollment is expected to drop by 1,500 students, which it did by 2,273 including 1,412 fewer freshmen.&lt;ref name=2016enroll&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.columbiamissourian.com/news/higher_education/fall-mu-freshmen-enrollment-slightly-more-than-projected/article_06176c10-68b1-11e6-af6e-e76aa72886f0.html |title=Fall 2016 MU freshmen enrollment slightly more than projected |website=[[Columbia Missourian]] |date=August 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 319 beds will be used over the summer until August 4, 2016. Both halls will undergo repairs if not needed. The new George C. Brooks Hall will open as planned for the Fall 2016 semester and house 293 students.&lt;ref name=Excellence-Respect&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.columbiamissourian.com/news/higher_education/two-residence-halls-to-be-on-standby-because-of-declining/article_547b3a1c-ffe8-11e5-89e1-4f1175f6e175.html |title=Two residence halls to be on standby because of declining enrollment |website=[[Columbia Missourian]] |date=April 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three more residence halls will temporarily close in the Fall of 2017: Center, Responsibility, and Discovery. Previously it was announced Respect, Excellence, Schurz and McDavid wouldn't operate in the Fall unless there was sufficient demand to reopen some of them. Combined, the seven halls are capable of housing about 1,500 students. The closures are estimated to save about $2 million, largely through reduced utility costs. The university says two of the closed halls also could get some use as guest and conference housing. The temporary closures come after freshman enrollment dropped 24 percent for this academic year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/education/university-of-missouri-to-temporarily-close-more-dorms/article_6e951473-8ee3-5c50-858b-adf1783ad81e.html |title=University of Missouri to temporarily close more dorms |website=''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'' |date=April 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The declining enrollment precipitated a budget plan to cut 400 jobs, but most of them are from those resigning or retiring, so less than 100 actual jobs will be eliminated for the 2018 fiscal year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbiamissourian.com/news/higher_education/mu-budget-proposal-calls-for-eliminating-jobs/article_ad24d9b4-39c8-11e7-9e49-4bd251d5984e.html|title=MU Budget Proposal Calls For Eliminating 400 Jobs|last=Kessel|first=Andrew|date=May 15, 2017|website=[[Columbia Missourian]]|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Groups and activities===
Tap Day is an annual spring ceremony in which the identities of the members of the six secret honor societies are revealed. The participating societies are [[QEBH]], [[Mystical Seven (Missouri)|Mystical Seven]], [[LSV Society|LSV]], [[Omicron Delta Kappa]], [[Mortar Board]], and the Rollins Society. The ceremony, first held in 1927, takes place at the columns on Francis Quadrangle.

The Associated Students of the University of Missouri (ASUM) is a student-run lobbying organization that represents the students' interests in the state and national capitals. ASUM's platform has included issues such as equalizing the "Access Missouri" grant, expanding "Bright Flight" funding, and giving students a vote on the Board of Curators.

The Trulaske Consulting Association was started in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Trambu|first=Aamer|title=About us page|url=http://tca.students.missouri.edu/?page_id=51|website=TCA|publisher=TCA|accessdate=November 14, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302005354/http://tca.students.missouri.edu/?page_id=51|archive-date=March 2, 2012|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a relatively new student organization and is open to students of all departments. However, most members are MBA and undergrad business students.

==Athletics==
{{main|Missouri Tigers}}
[[File:Faurot Field sunset skyline.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Hearnes Center]], [[Mizzou Arena]], and [[Faurot Field]]]]
The [[Missouri Tigers]] are a member of the [[Southeastern Conference]] with the exception of wrestling, which competes in the [[Mid-American Conference]]. Mizzou is the only school in the state with all of its sports in the [[NCAA Division I]] and a football team that competes in the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS).  These are the highest levels of college sports in the United States. The official colors are black and gold.

Athletic sports for the Tigers include men's and women's basketball, baseball, [[cross country running|cross country]], [[American football|football]], golf, gymnastics, swimming &amp; [[Diving (sport)|diving]], [[softball]], track, tennis, volleyball, [[women's soccer]], and [[collegiate wrestling|wrestling]]. Historic sports included a shooting club, in which the ladies' team in 1934 won a national championship. Former football coach [[Gary Pinkel]] holds the record at the university for the most wins on the gridiron. Additionally, former basketball coach and alum [[Norm Stewart]] maintains the record for the most wins on the hardcourt.

MU football games are played on [[Faurot Field|Faurot Field at Memorial Stadium ("The Zou")]]. Built in 1926, this stadium has an official capacity of 71,168,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mutigers.com/facilities/?id=1 |title=University of Missouri Athletics |publisher=Mutigers.com |date= |accessdate=November 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and features a nearly {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide "M" behind the north-end zone. Men's and women's basketball games take place at the [[Mizzou Arena]], just south of the football stadium. The [[Hearnes Center]] had hosted men's and women's basketball from 1972 to 2004 and it is still used for other athletic (including wrestling, volleyball, and indoor track and field) and school events.

[[File:Dangerous Women.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Ladies champion team of the Missouri University shooting club, 1934&lt;ref&gt;''National Archieff'', the Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The Missouri Tiger men's basketball team has had 22 [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] appearances, the second-most Tournament appearances without a [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship#Final Four|Final Four]]. The Tigers have appeared in the regional finals (Elite Eight) of the [[NCAA]] Tournament six times (twice under coach Norm Stewart, Missouri head coach from 1967 to 1999). The Tigers have won 15 conference championships, beginning with the [[Missouri Valley Conference]], followed by the [[Big Six Conference|Big Six]], the [[Big Eight Conference|Big Eight]], and the [[Big 12 Conference]]. In 1994, the Tigers went undefeated in the Big Eight to take the regular season title. In 2009, Missouri won its first Big 12 Championship&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.big12sports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=10410&amp;ATCLID=205160610 |title=All-Time Big 12 Championships – Big 12 Conference – Official Athletic Site |publisher=Big12sports.com |date= |accessdate=August 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; over [[Baylor University|Baylor]]. Missouri went on to win its second Big 12 Championship in its final season in the Big 12 in 2012, once again defeating Baylor. Standout players from the Mizzou's basketball team include, [[Anthony Peeler]], John Brown, [[Jon Sundvold]], [[Steve Stipanovich]], [[Kareem Rush]], [[Keyon Dooling]] [[Doug Smith (basketball)|Doug Smith]], Willie Smith, [[Norm Stewart]], [[Linas Kleiza]], [[Derrick Chievous]], [[DeMarre Carroll]], [[Kim English (basketball)|Kim English]]. [[Jordan Clarkson]] and [[Marcus Denmon]].

The official [[mascot]] for Missouri Tigers athletics is [[Truman the Tiger]], created on September 16, 1986. Following a campus-wide contest, Truman was named in honor of [[Harry S. Truman]], the only U.S. president from Missouri. Today, Truman appears to cheer on the team, mingle with supporters at Mizzou athletic events as well as at pep-rallies, alumni association functions, and frequent visits to Columbia-area schools.

[[File:Farout field from the air moments before a game.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Faurot Field]] during a football game]]
On November 24, 2007, the Mizzou football team played against its biggest rival, [[Kansas Jayhawks football|Kansas]], at [[Arrowhead Stadium]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. At that time, KU was ranked No. 2 and MU was ranked No. 3 nationally. At the end of the [[Border Showdown|game]], Mizzou defeated KU, 36–28. The following day MU was ranked No. 1 in the country for the second time in its history.
On December 1, 2007, the Mizzou football team lost the Big 12 Championship game in [[San Antonio, Texas]], to [[University of Oklahoma|Oklahoma]] 38–17, falling out of national title and Bowl Championship Series contention. The team regrouped and played in the [[Cotton Bowl Classic|Cotton Bowl]] January 1, 2008, at [[Dallas, Texas]], defeating [[University of Arkansas|Arkansas]], 38–7. In the final [[Associated Press]] "Top 25 football poll" of the 2007 season, Mizzou was ranked No. 4 in the country, its highest finishing position in the team's history.

On November 6, 2011, the University of Missouri announced it would leave the [[Big 12 Conference]] to join the [[Southeastern Conference]] effective July 1, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/13/sports/ncaabasketball/missouris-shift-to-the-sec-ignites-a-war-of-words.html|title=Missouri to SEC Ignites a War of Words|last=Associated Press|first=|date=November 12, 2011|work=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=March 6, 2012|author-link=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2012, the school's wrestling team became an associate member of the [[Mid-American Conference]], as the SEC does not sponsor wrestling.

On December 7, 2013, Mizzou played in the SEC Championship Game in [[Atlanta]] in the [[Georgia Dome]] against [[Auburn University|Auburn]]. The teams were ranked 5th and 3rd, respectively in the nation. Mizzou fell to the eventual national runners-up 59-42, and ended up playing in the [[2014 Cotton Bowl Classic]] in [[Dallas]]. Missouri (#9) defeated [[Oklahoma State University|Oklahoma State]] (#13) 41-31, winning their second Cotton Bowl Classic.&lt;ref&gt;[[2014 Cotton Bowl Classic#Missouri]]&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 6, 2014, #17 Mizzou played #1 [[University of Alabama|Alabama]] in its second consecutive SEC Championship Game falling to the Crimson Tide, 42-13. Mizzou went on to play [[University of Minnesota|Minnesota]] in the [[Citrus Bowl]], winning 33-17 and finishing #16 in the nation.

==Traditions==

===Tiger Walk and Prowl===
The Tiger Walk is held annually before the fall semester in the Quad, as welcome and orientation for new students to the university. Students can meet and also learn about school organizations, which have stations around the Quad. After hearing of the four pillars of success, students walk in procession through the quad and the Columns toward Jesse Hall, symbolizing their entrance into the university.  Tiger Prowl is held for graduation seniors on the Quad. They walk through the columns, away from Jesse Hall, to symbolize becoming alumni. Refreshments, such as famous tiger stripe ice cream, are provided after the ceremony.

===Official song===
[[File:House Decs at Dawn.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Students working on house decorations, a yearly [[Homecoming]] tradition for fraternities and sororities]]

The university song is "Old Missouri".  With lyrics written in 1895, it is sung to the tune of "[[Annie Lisle]]."

&lt;poem&gt;''First verse:''
Old Missouri, fair Missouri
Dear old Varsity.
Ours are hearts that fondly love thee
Here's a health to thee.

''Chorus:''
Proud art thou in classic beauty
Of thy noble past
With thy watch words: honour, duty,
Thy high fame shall last!

''Second verse:''
Every student, man and maiden
Swells the glad refrain.
'Till the breezes, music-laden
Waft it back again.

''(repeat chorus)''&lt;/poem&gt;

===Homecoming===
In 1911, athletic director [[Chester Brewer]] invited alumni to "come home" for the big football game against the [[University of Kansas]]. A spirit rally and parade were planned as part of the celebration. The [[Council for Advancement and Support of Education]] has called MU's homecoming celebration the best in the nation and a model program {{citation needed|date=January 2018}}. Missouri Homecoming also includes several service elements, and the homecoming [[blood donation|blood drive]] has earned the [[Guinness Record]] as the nation's largest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redcross.org/images/MEDIA_CustomProductCatalog/m4440202_CampusConnections.pdf|title=Red Cross Campus Connections|format=PDF|accessdate=January 5, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150108234206/http://www.redcross.org/images/MEDIA_CustomProductCatalog/m4440202_CampusConnections.pdf|archive-date=January 8, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Storm Drain.JPG|thumb|Urban runoff flowing into a storm drain]]
'''Urban runoff''' is [[surface runoff]] of rainwater created by [[urbanization]]. This runoff is a major source of [[Flood#Urban flooding|flooding]] and [[water pollution]] in urban communities worldwide.

[[Impervious surfaces]] ([[road]]s, [[parking lot]]s and [[sidewalk]]s) are constructed during [[land development]]. During [[rain]] storms and other [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] events, these surfaces (built from materials such as [[asphalt]] and [[concrete]]), along with [[roof]]tops, carry polluted [[stormwater]] to [[storm drains]], instead of allowing the water to [[Infiltration (hydrology)|percolate]] through [[soil]].&lt;ref name="USGS-runoff"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://water.usgs.gov/edu/runoff.html |title=Runoff (surface water runoff) |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2016-12-02 |website=USGS Water Science School |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) |location=Reston, VA}}&lt;/ref&gt; This causes lowering of the [[water table]] (because [[groundwater recharge]] is lessened) and [[flood]]ing since the amount of water that remains on the surface is greater.&lt;ref name="ASCE1"&gt;[http://wef.org/ Water Environment Federation], Alexandria, VA; and [http://www.asce.org/ American Society of Civil Engineers], Reston, VA. [https://books.google.com/books?id=AdU-VXXV_H0C "Urban Runoff Quality Management."] WEF Manual of Practice No. 23; ASCE Manual and Report on Engineering Practice No. 87. 1998. {{ISBN|1-57278-039-8}}. Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schueler |first=Thomas R. |editor1-last=Schueler |editor2-last=Holland |editor2-first=Heather K. |title=The Practice of Watershed Protection |chapter=The Importance of Imperviousness |chapterurl=http://www.cwp.org/online-watershed-library/doc_download/308-the-importance-of-imperviousness |location=Ellicott City, MD |publisher=Center for Watershed Protection |pages=1–12 |year=2000 |origyear=initial publ. 1995 |isbn= |accessdate=2014-12-24 |chapter-format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most municipal storm sewer systems discharge stormwater, untreated, to [[stream]]s, [[river]]s and [[bay]]s. This excess water can also make its way into people's properties through basement backups and seepage through building wall and floors.

==Urban flooding==
[[File:Walking in the Rain New Orleans.jpg|thumb|Flooded streets in [[New Orleans]]]]
[[File:Natural &amp; impervious cover diagrams EPA.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Relationship between [[impervious surfaces]] and [[surface runoff]]]]
Urban runoff is a major cause of [[Flood#Urban flooding|urban flooding]], the inundation of land or property in a built-up environment caused by rainfall overwhelming the capacity of [[drainage|drainage systems]], such as [[storm sewers]].&lt;ref name="USGS-water cycle"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://water.usgs.gov/edu/watercyclerunoff.html |title=Surface Runoff - The Water Cycle |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2016-12-15 |website=USGS Water Science School |publisher=USGS}}&lt;/ref&gt; Triggered by events such as [[flash flooding]], [[storm surges]], overbank flooding, or [[snow melt]], urban flooding is characterized by its repetitive, costly and systemic impacts on communities, regardless of whether or not these communities are located within formally designated floodplains or near any body of water.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Neighborhood Technology, Chicago IL [http://www.cnt.org/media/CNT_PrevalenceAndCostOfUrbanFlooding.pdf "The Prevalence and Cost of Urban Flooding."] May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several ways in which stormwater enters properties: backup through sewer pipes, toilets and sinks into buildings; seepage through building walls and floors; the accumulation of water on property and in public rights-of-way; and the overflow of water from water bodies such as rivers and lakes. Where properties are built with [[basements]], urban flooding is the primary cause of basement flooding.

Flood flows in urban environments have been investigated relatively recently despite many centuries of flood events.&lt;ref name=Chanson_2011c&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:243550|title=Turbulent Velocity and Suspended Sediment Concentration Measurements in an Urban Environment of the Brisbane River Flood Plain at Gardens Point on 12–13 January 2011|journal=Hydraulic Model Report No. CH83/11 |year=2011|issue=CH83/11|pages=120 pp|first1=Richard |last1=Brown|authorlink2=Hubert Chanson|first2=Hubert |last2=Chanson|first3= Dave |last3=McIntosh |first4= Jay |last4=Madhani|publisher= The University of Queensland, School of Civil Engineering |location=Brisbane, Australia|isbn=978-1-74272-027-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers mentioned the storage effect in urban areas.

==Pollutants==
[[File:Pollutedflood.JPG|thumb|A creek filled with urban runoff after a storm]]
Water running off these impervious surfaces tends to pick up [[gasoline]], [[motor oil]], [[heavy metals]], [[waste|trash]] and other pollutants from roadways and parking lots, as well as [[fertilizers]] and [[pesticides]] from lawns. Roads and parking lots are major sources of [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s (PAHs), which are created as [[combustion]] byproducts of gasoline and other [[fossil fuel]]s, as well as of the heavy metals [[nickel]], [[copper]], [[zinc]], [[cadmium]], and [[lead]]. Roof runoff contributes high levels of [[chemical synthesis|synthetic]] [[organic compound]]s and [[zinc]] (from [[galvanization|galvanized]] gutters). Fertilizer use on residential lawns, parks and golf courses is a measurable source of [[nitrates]] and [[phosphorus]] in urban runoff when fertilizer is improperly applied or when turf is over-fertilized.&lt;ref name="ASCE1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Stormwater Effects Handbook: A Toolbox for Watershed Managers, Scientists, and Engineers|authors=G. Allen Burton, Jr., Robert Pitt|publisher=CRC/Lewis Publishers|location=New York|year=2001|isbn=0-87371-924-7|url=http://unix.eng.ua.edu/~rpitt/Publications/BooksandReports/Stormwater%20Effects%20Handbook%20by%20%20Burton%20and%20Pitt%20book/MainEDFS_Book.html}} Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eroding soils or poorly maintained construction sites can often lead to increased [[Nonpoint source pollution#Sediment|sedimentation]] in runoff. Sedimentation often settles to the bottom of water bodies and can directly affect water quality. Excessive levels of sediment in water bodies can increase the risk of infection and disease through high levels of nutrients present in the soil. These high levels of nutrients can reduce oxygen and boost algae growth while limiting native vegetation growth. Limited native vegetation and excessive algae has the potential to disrupt the entire aquatic ecosystem due to limited light penetration, lower oxygen levels, and reduced food reserves. Excessive levels of sediment and [[suspended solids]] have the potential to damage existing infrastructure as well.  Sedimentation can increase runoff by plugging underground injection systems, thereby increasing the amount of runoff on the surface. Increased sedimentation levels can also reduce storage behind reservoirs.  This reduction of reservoir capacities can lead to increased expenses for public land agencies while also impacting the quality of water recreational areas.&lt;ref&gt;Oregon Environmental Council. Chapter 1: Impacts of urban stormwater runoff. Retrieved from website: http://www.oeconline.org/our-work/rivers/stormwater/stormwater report/impacts&lt;/ref&gt;

Runoff can also induce heavy metal poisoning in ocean life. Small amounts of heavy metals are carried by runoff into the oceans. These metals are ingested by ocean life. These heavy metals cannot be disposed so they accumulate within the animals. Over time, these metals build up to a toxic level, and the animal dies. This heavy metal poisoning can also affect humans. If we eat a poisoned animal, we have a chance of getting heavy metal poisoning too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bortman|first1=Marci|title=Marine Pollution|journal=Environmental Encyclopedia|date=2011|volume=3|pages=21–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weiss|first1=Kenneth R.|title=Endangered Oceans|date=2009|publisher=Glenhaven Press|location=Farmington Hills, MI|pages=39–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As stormwater is channeled into storm drains and surface waters, the natural [[sediment]] load discharged to receiving waters decreases, but the water flow and velocity increases. In fact, the impervious cover in a typical city creates five times the runoff of a typical woodland of the same size.&lt;ref name="EPA2"&gt;{{cite report |date=February 2003 |title=Protecting Water Quality from Urban Runoff |url=https://www.epa.gov/polluted-runoff-nonpoint-source-pollution/nonpoint-source-fact-sheets |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 841-F-03-003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
A 2008 report by the [[United States National Research Council]] (textbox below) identified urban runoff as a leading source of [[water quality]] problems.
&lt;blockquote class="toccolours" style="width:25%; float:right; padding:10px 15px; display:table;"&gt;...further declines in water quality remain likely if the land-use changes that typify more diffuse sources of pollution are not addressed... These include land-disturbing agricultural, silvicultural, urban, industrial, and construction activities from which hard-to-monitor pollutants emerge during wet-weather events. Pollution from these landscapes has been almost universally acknowledged as the most pressing challenge to the restoration of waterbodies and aquatic ecosystems nationwide.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;– National Research Council, ''Urban Stormwater Management in the United States''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author=National Research Council (United States) |date=2009 |title=Urban Stormwater Management in the United States |url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12465/urban-stormwater-management-in-the-united-states |publisher=National Academies Press |location=Washington, D.C. |doi=10.17226/12465 |isbn=978-0-309-12539-0 |page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Weaselbrgrandavpassaicjeh.JPG|thumb|Weasel Brook in [[Passaic, New Jersey]] has been [[River engineering#Channelization|channelized]] with concrete walls to control localized flooding.]]

The runoff also increases temperatures in streams, harming [[fish]] and other organisms. (A sudden burst of runoff from a rainstorm can cause a fish-killing shock of hot water.) Also, [[road salt]] used to melt snow on sidewalks and roadways can contaminate streams and groundwater [[aquifer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;United States Geological Survey. Atlanta, GA. [http://ga.water.usgs.gov/edu/urbanrun.html "The effects of urbanization on water quality: Urban runoff."] Accessed 2009-12-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most pronounced effects of urban runoff is on watercourses that historically contained little or no water during dry weather periods (often called ''[[ephemeral stream]]s''). When an area around such a stream is [[urbanization|urbanized]], the resultant runoff creates an unnatural year-round [[streamflow]] that hurts the vegetation, [[wildlife]] and [[stream bed]] of the waterway. Containing little or no sediment relative to the historic ratio of sediment to water, urban runoff rushes down the stream channel, ruining natural features such as [[meander]]s and [[sandbar]]s, and creates severe erosion—increasing sediment loads at the mouth while severely incising the [[stream bed]] upstream. As an example, on many [[Southern California]] beaches at the mouth of a waterway, urban runoff carries trash, pollutants, excessive silt, and other wastes, and can pose moderate to severe health hazards.

Because of fertilizer and organic waste that urban runoff often carries, [[eutrophication]] often occurs in waterways affected by this type of runoff. After heavy rains, organic matter in the waterway is relatively high compared with natural levels, spurring growth of [[algae]] blooms that soon consume most of the [[oxygen]]. Once the naturally occurring oxygen in the water is depleted, the algae blooms die, and their decomposition causes further eutrophication. Algae blooms mostly occur in areas with still water, such as [[stream pool]]s and the pools behind [[dam]]s, [[weir]]s, and some [[drop structure]]s. Eutrophication usually comes with deadly consequences for fish and other aquatic organisms.

Excessive stream bank erosion may cause flooding and property damage. For many years governments have often responded to urban stream erosion problems by [[river engineering]] through construction of hardened [[levee|embankments]] and similar control structures using concrete and masonry materials. Use of these hard materials destroys habitat for fish and other animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Laws |first1=Edward A. |last2=Roth |first2=Lauren |year=2004 |title=Impact of Stream Hardening on Water Quality and Metabolic Characteristics of Waimanalo and Kane'ohe Streams, O'ahu, Hawaiian Islands |journal=Pacific Science |publisher= University of Hawai'i Press |volume=58 |issue=2 |pages= |hdl=10125/2725 |doi= 10.1353/psc.2004.0019|issn=0030-8870}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a project may stabilize the immediate area where flood damage occurred, but often it simply shifts the problem to an upstream or downstream segment of the stream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=2007 |title=National Management Measures to Control Nonpoint Source Pollution from Hydromodification |chapter=Ch. 3.

Urban flooding has significant economic implications. In the US, industry experts estimate that wet basements can lower property values by 10%-25% and are cited among the top reasons for not purchasing a home.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://www.cnt.org/media/CNT_PrevalenceAndCostOfUrbanFlooding.pdf "The Prevalence and Cost of Urban Flooding."] May 2013, Center for Neighborhood Technology, Chicago IL.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|U.S Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)]], almost 40% of small businesses never reopen their doors following a flooding disaster.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Emergency Management Agency (U.S.). "Protecting Your Businesses," last updated March, 2013, http://www.fema.gov/protecting-yourbusinesses  {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130917193030/http://www.fema.gov/protecting-yourbusinesses |date=2013-09-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[UK]], urban flooding is estimated to cost £270 million a year in [[England]] and [[Wales]]; 80,000 homes are at risk.&lt;ref&gt;Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology, London, UK. [http://www.parliament.uk/documents/post/postpn289.pdf "Urban Flooding."]  Postnote 289, July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of [[Cook County, Illinois]], identified 177,000 property damage insurance claims made across 96% of the county's ZIP codes over a five-year period from 2007-2011. This is the equivalent of one in six properties in the County making a claim. Average payouts per claim were $3,733 across all types of claims, with total claims amounting to $660 million over the five years examined.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Despite concerted efforts, many communities lack the funds to fully address these issues, and often seek funds elsewhere. Numerous watersheds within [[Los Angeles County, California]] do not meet state water quality standards, despite spending $100 million a year on clean water programs to combat issues such as urban runoff. To combat this problem, officials have introduced a measure that would assess a fee to homeowners and local businesses in attempt to raise $290 million for effective urban runoff management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sewell |first=Abby |date=2013-01-03 |title=County seeks parcel fee to pay for projects to combat urban runoff |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jan/03/local/la-me-adv-stormwater-20130103 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Effective control of urban runoff involves reducing the velocity and flow of stormwater, as well as reducing pollutant discharges. A variety of stormwater management practices and systems may be used to reduce the effects of urban runoff. Some of these techniques (called [[best management practice for water pollution|best management practices]] (BMPs) in the US), focus on water quantity control, while others focus on improving water quality, and some perform both functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=August 1999 |title=Preliminary Data Summary of Urban Storm Water Best Management Practices |chapter=Ch. 5: Description and Performance of Storm Water Best Management Practices |url=https://www.epa.gov/eg/industrial-wastewater-studies-miscellaneous |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C. |id=EPA-821-R-99-012}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Pollution prevention practices include [[Low-impact development (Canada/US)|low impact development (LID)]] or [[green infrastructure]] techniques - known as [[Sustainable drainage system|Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS)]] in the UK, and [[Water-sensitive urban design|Water-Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD)]] in Australia and the Middle East - such as the installation of [[green roof]]s and improved chemical handling (e.g. management of motor fuels &amp; oil, fertilizers and pesticides).&lt;ref name="EPA2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EPA3"&gt;{{cite AV media |year=2009 |title=Reduce Runoff: Slow It Down, Spread It Out, Soak It In |medium=Video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huO_NRn34GI |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Runoff mitigation systems include [[infiltration basin]]s, [[bioretention]] systems, [[constructed wetland]]s, [[retention basin]]s and similar devices.&lt;ref&gt;California Stormwater Quality Association. Menlo Park, CA. [http://www.cabmphandbooks.com/ "Stormwater Best Management Practice (BMP) Handbooks."] 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. Trenton, NJ. [http://www.njstormwater.org/bmp_manual2.htm "New Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual."] April 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Providing effective urban runoff solutions often requires proper city programs that take into account the needs and differences of the community. Factors such as a city's mean temperature, precipitation levels, geographical location, and airborne pollutant levels can all affect rates of pollution in urban runoff and present unique challenges for management. Human factors such as urbanization rates, land use trends, and chosen building materials for impervious surfaces often exacerbate these issues.

The implementation of citywide maintenance strategies such as street sweeping programs can also be an effective method in improving the quality of urban runoff. [[Street sweeper|Street sweeping vacuums]] collect particles of dust and suspended solids often found in public parking lots and roads that often end up in runoff.&lt;ref name="EPA4"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://water.epa.gov/polwaste/npdes/swbmp/Parking-Lot-and-Street-Cleaning.cfm |title=Parking Lot and Street Cleaning |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150828022543/http://water.epa.gov/polwaste/npdes/swbmp/Parking-Lot-and-Street-Cleaning.cfm |archive-date=2015-08-28 |website=National Menu of Stormwater Best Management Practices |publisher=EPA |accessdate=2014-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Yellow Fish.jpg|thumb|Blue drain and yellow fish symbol used by the UK Environment Agency to raise awareness of the ecological impacts of contaminating surface drainage]]Educational programs can also be an effective tool for managing urban runoff. Local businesses and individuals can have an integral role in reducing pollution in urban runoff simply through their practices, but often are unaware of regulations. Creating a productive discussion on urban runoff and the importance of effective disposal of household items can help to encourage environmentally friendly practices at a reduced cost to the city and local economy.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Victorian burlesque''', sometimes known as '''travesty''' or '''extravaganza''',&lt;ref&gt;According to the ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'',  "the various genre terms were always applied freely", and by the 1860s their use had become "arbitrary and capricious": see [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/04381 "Burlesque,"] ''Grove Music Online''. Oxford Music Online, accessed 3 February 2011 {{subscription}}.  In an 1896 article on Burlesque in ''The Theatre'', the three terms are used interchangeably: see Adams, W. Davenport. "Burlesque: Old ''v.'' New", ''The Theatre'', 1 March 1896, pp. 144–45&lt;/ref&gt; is a genre of theatrical entertainment that was popular in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] England and in the New York theatre of the mid 19th century. It is a form of [[parody music|parody]] in which a well-known opera or piece of classical theatre or ballet is adapted into a broad comic play, usually a musical play, usually risqué in style, mocking the theatrical and musical conventions and styles of the original work, and often quoting or [[pastiche|pastiching]] text or music from the original work. Victorian burlesque is one of several forms of [[burlesque]].

Like [[ballad opera]], burlesques featured musical scores drawing on a wide range of music, from popular contemporary songs to operatic arias, although later burlesques, from the 1880s, sometimes featured original scores.  Dance played an important part, and great attention was paid to the staging, costumes and other spectacular elements of stagecraft, as many of the pieces were staged as [[extravaganza]]s.  Many of the male roles were played by actresses as [[breeches role]]s, purposely to show off their physical charms, and some of the older female roles were taken by male actors.

Originally short, one-act pieces, burlesques were later full-length shows, occupying most or all of an evening's programme. Authors who wrote burlesques included [[J. R. Planché]], [[H. J. Byron]], [[G. R. Sims]], [[F. C. Burnand]], [[W. S. Gilbert]] and [[Fred Leslie]].

==History==
Burlesque theatre became popular around the beginning of the [[Victorian era]]. The word "burlesque" is derived from the Italian ''burla'', which means "ridicule or mockery".&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', which defines the word as "That species of literary composition, or of dramatic representation, which aims at exciting laughter by caricature of the manner or spirit of serious works, or by ludicrous treatment of their subjects; a literary or dramatic work of this kind."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Baldick&gt;Baldick, Chris. [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t56.e153 "Burlesque",] ''The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms'', Oxford University Press, 2008. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press, accessed 16 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', Victorian burlesque was "related to and in part derived from [[pantomime]] and may be considered an extension of the introductory section of pantomime with the addition of gags and 'turns'."&lt;ref name=grove&gt;[[Erich Schwandt|Schwandt, Erich]] et al. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/04381 "Burlesque",] ''Grove Music Online''. Oxford Music Online, accessed 3 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another antecedent was [[ballad opera]], in which new words were fitted to existing tunes.&lt;ref&gt;Moss,  Harold Gene. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/830406 "Popular Music and the Ballad Opera",] ''Journal of the American Musicological Society'', Vol. 26, No. 3 (Autumn, 1973), pp. 365–82, University of California Press, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:1831 Royal Olympic.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Olympic Theatre]], for which Planché wrote ''Olympic Revels'']]
[[Lucia Elizabeth Vestris|Madame Vestris]] produced burlesques at the [[Olympic Theatre]] beginning in 1831 with ''Olympic Revels'' by [[J. R. Planché]].&lt;ref&gt;Adams, W. Davenport. ''A Book of Burlesque'' (London: Henry and Co., 1891), p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;  In these pieces, comedy stemmed from the incongruity and absurdity of the grand classical subjects, with realistic historical dress and settings, being juxtaposed with the everyday modern activities portrayed by the actors. For example, ''Olympic Revels'' opens with the gods of Olympus in classical Greek dress playing [[whist]].&lt;ref&gt;Reinhardt, p. 541&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early burlesques, the words of the songs were written to popular music, as had been done earlier in ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]''.  Later in the Victorian era, burlesque mixed [[operetta]], [[music hall]] and [[revue]], and some of the large-scale burlesque spectacles were known as [[extravaganza]]s.&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[H. J. Byron]]'s 1863 ''Il trovatore'' parody, which was labelled "a burlesque extravaganza": see Marvin, Roberta Montemorra. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3878318 "Verdian Opera Burlesqued: A Glimpse into Mid-Victorian Theatrical Culture",] ''Cambridge Opera Journal'', Vol. 15, No. 1 (March 2003), p. 42, Cambridge University Press, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The English style of burlesque was successfully launched in New York in the 1840s by the manager and comedian William Mitchell, who had opened his Olympic Theatre in December 1839. Like the London prototypes, his burlesques included characters with nonsensical names such as Wunsuponatyme and The King of Neverminditsnamia, and made fun of all kinds of music currently being presented in the city.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Delmer D. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/779924 "Public Music Performances in New York City from 1800 to 1850",] ''Anuario Interamericano de Investigacion Musical'', Vol. 6 (1970), pp. 5–50, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike pantomime, which aimed at all ages and classes, burlesque was aimed at a narrower, highly literate audience;&lt;ref name=tls/&gt; some writers, such as the Brough brothers,&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Barnabas Brough]] and his brother [[William Brough (writer)|William Brough]] wrote successful burlesques, sometimes jointly and sometimes alone. Their burlesques include ''The Enchanted Isle'' (1848), ''Medea'' (1856), ''Masaniello'' (1857), ''The Sphinx'' (1849) and ''The Last Edition of Ivanhoe'' (1850). See Dereli, Cynthia. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/3577 "Brough, Robert Barnabas (1828–1860)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 3 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; aimed at a conservative middle class audience, and [[H. J. Byron]]'s success was attributed to his skill in appealing to the lower middle classes.&lt;ref name=tls&gt;Speaight, George. "All froth and bubble", ''The Times Literary Supplement'', 1 October 1976, p. 1233&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most frequent subjects for burlesque were the plays of Shakespeare and grand opera. From the 1850s onwards, burlesquing of Italian, French and, later in the century, German opera was popular with London audiences. [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s ''[[Il trovatore]]'' and ''[[La traviata]]'' received their British premieres in 1855 and 1856 respectively; British burlesques of them followed quickly.  ''Our Lady of the Cameleon'' by [[Leicester Silk Buckingham]] and ''Our Traviata'' by William F. Vandervell (both 1857) were followed by five different burlesque treatments of ''Il trovatore'', two of them by H. J. Byron: ''Ill Treated Trovatore, or the Mother the Maiden and the Musicianer'' (1863) and ''Il Trovatore or Larks with a Libretto'' (1880).&lt;ref name=marvin&gt;Marvin,  Roberta Montemorra.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
By the 1880s, almost every truly popular opera had become the subject of a burlesque. Generally appearing after an opera's premiere or following a successful revival, they usually enjoyed local production runs, often for a month or longer. The popularity of stage burlesque in general and operatic burlesque in particular seems to have stemmed from the many ways in which it entertained a diverse group, and the manner in which it fed and fed on the circus-like or carnivalesque atmosphere of public Victorian London.&lt;ref name=marvin/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[W. S. Gilbert]] wrote five opera burlesques early in his career, beginning with ''[[Dulcamara, or the Little Duck and the Great Quack]]'' (1866), the most successful of which was ''[[Robert the Devil (Gilbert)|Robert the Devil]]'' (1868).&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1870s, [[Lydia Thompson]]'s burlesque troupe, with [[Willie Edouin]], became famous for their burlesques, by such authors as [[H. B. Farnie]] and [[Robert Reece]], both in Britain and the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, W. J., rev. J. Gilliland.

The Shakespeare scholar [[Stanley Wells]] notes that although parodies of Shakespeare had appeared even in Shakespeare's lifetime, the heyday of Shakespearean burlesque was the Victorian era.&lt;ref&gt;Wells, Stanley. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2867735 "Shakespearian Burlesques",] ''Shakespeare Quarterly'', Vol. 16, No. 1 (Winter, 1965), pp. 49–61, Folger Shakespeare Library in association with George Washington University, accessed 2 February 2011  {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wells observes that the typical Victorian Shakespeare burlesque "takes a Shakespeare play as its point of departure and creates from it a mainly comic entertainment, often in ways that bear no relation to the original play."&lt;ref name=Wells55&gt;Wells, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;  Wells gives, as an example of the puns in the texts, the following: Macbeth and Banquo make their first entrance under an umbrella.  The witches greet them with "Hail! hail! hail!": Macbeth asks Banquo, "What mean these salutations, noble thane?" and is told "These showers of 'Hail' anticipate your 'reign'".&lt;ref name=Wells55/&gt;  Musically, Shakespearean burlesques were as varied as the others of the genre.  An 1859 burlesque of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' contained 23 musical numbers, some from opera, such as the serenade from ''[[Don Pasquale]]'', and some from traditional airs and popular songs of the day including "[[Buffalo Gals]]", and "Nix my Dolly".&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs,  Henry E., [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2869557 "The Bard Debunked",] ''Shakespeare Quarterly'', Vol. 31, No. 2 (Summer, 1980), pp. 294–96, Folger Shakespeare Library in association with George Washington University, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Faustupto.jpg|right|thumb|Sheet music from ''[[Faust up to Date]]'']]
The dialogue for burlesques was generally written in rhyming couplets, or, less often, in other verse forms, such as blank verse; it was notable for its bad [[pun]]s.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;  For example, in ''[[Faust up to Date]]'' (1888), a couplet reads:
:Mephistopheles: "Along the Riviera dudes her praises sing."
:Walerlie: "Oh, did you Riviera such a thing?"&lt;ref&gt;Lubbock, Mark.  [http://www.theatrehistory.com/british/lightopera001.html "History of British musical theatre",] ''The Complete Book of Light Opera'', New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1962, pp. 467–68&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Grove'', although "an almost indispensable element of burlesque was the display of attractive women dressed in tights, often in [[Breeches role|travesty roles]] ... the plays themselves did not normally tend to indecency."&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;  Some contemporary critics took a sterner view; in an 1885 article, the critic Thomas Heyward praised Planché ("fanciful and elegant") and Gilbert ("witty, never vulgar"), but wrote of the genre as a whole, "the flashy, 'leggy', burlesque, with its 'slangy' songs, loutish 'breakdowns', vulgar jests, paltry puns and witless grimacing at all that is graceful and poetic is simply odious. … Burlesque, insensate, spiritless and undiscriminating, demoralizes both the audience and the players. It debases the public taste."&lt;ref&gt;Heyward, Thomas, "Burlesque: Its Uses and Abuses", ''Tinsley's Magazine'', November 1885,  p. 477&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert expressed his own views on the worth of burlesque:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The question whether burlesque has a claim to rank as art is, I think, one of degree. Bad burlesque is as far removed from true art as is a bad picture. But burlesque in its higher development calls for high intellectual power on the part of its professors. [[Aristophanes]], [[Rabelais]], [[George Cruikshank|Geo Cruikshank]], the authors of the ''[[Rejected Addresses]]'', [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]], Planché were all in their respective lines professors of true burlesque.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, W. S., Letter to Blanche Reives, ''quoted'' in "Modern Burlesque", ''The Orchestra'', November 1880, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his 1859 [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow|Longfellow]] burlesque ''Hi-A-Wa-Tha'', the American playwright Charles Walcot encapsulated the character of burlesque in the epilogue, addressed to the audience by [[Mrs. John Wood]] as Minnehaha:
:Ye who love extravaganza,
:Love to laugh at all things funny,
:Love the bold anachronism.
:And the work of paste and scissors,
:And "the unities" destruction,
:Nigger airs, old glees, and catches,
:Interspersed with gems of Op'ra,
:Jokes and puns, good, bad, and so-so, –
:Come and see this mutilation,
:This disgraceful Hiawatha, Mongrel, doggerel Hiawatha!&lt;ref&gt;''Quoted'' in Hewitt, Barnard. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3204686  "Mrs. John Wood and the Lost Art of Burlesque Acting",] ''Educational Theatre Journal'', Vol. 13, No. 2 (May, 1961), pp. 82–85, Johns Hopkins University Press, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar vein, ten years later, Gilbert gave an English viewpoint on burlesque, in his epilogue to ''[[The Pretty Druidess]]'':
:So for burlesque I plead. Forgive our rhymes;
:Forgive the jokes you've heard five thousand times;
:Forgive each breakdown, cellar-flap, and clog,&lt;ref&gt;Three types of dance popular in burlesque&lt;/ref&gt;
:Our low-bred songs – our slangy dialogue;
:And, above all – oh, ye with double barrel –
:Forgive the scantiness of our apparel! &lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender reversal and female sexuality==
[[File:The_High_Rollers_Extravaganza_Co._-_Bend_Her_-_c.1900.jpg|thumb|300px|American burlesque on ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ|Ben Hur]]'', c. 1900.]]
Actresses in burlesque would often play [[breeches role]]s, which were male roles played by women; likewise, men eventually began to play older female roles.&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;Hall, Edith. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/30222456 "Classical Mythology in the Victorian Popular Culture"], ''International Journal of the Classic Tradition'', 1999, vol. 5, issue 3, pp. 336–366, accessed 4 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  These reversals allowed viewers to distance themselves from the morality of the play, focusing more on joy and entertainment than catharsis, a definitive shift away from neoclassical ideas.&lt;ref name=Hall /&gt;

The depiction of female sexuality in Victorian burlesque was an example of the connection between women as performers and women as sexual objects in Victorian culture.&lt;ref name="Buszek"&gt;Buszek, Maria-Elena.  [http://ehis.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?sid=394dd17c-6070-4982-a2c4-2e5723826ac7%40sessionmgr104&amp;vid=5&amp;hid=115 "Representing 'Awarishness': Burlesque, Feminist Transgression, and the 19th-Century Pin-up"]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''The Drama Review'', 1999, vol. 43, issue 4, pp. 141–162, accessed 4 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout the history of theatre the participation of women on stage has been questioned.  Victorian culture viewed paid female performance as being closely associated with prostitution, “a profession in which most women in the theatre dabbled, if not took on as a primary source of income.”&lt;ref name=Buszek /&gt;

==Gaiety Theatre==
[[Image:Florence St. John.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Florence St. John]] in ''[[Carmen up to Data]]'']]
Burlesque became the specialty of London's [[Royal Strand Theatre]] and [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]] from the 1860s to the early 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;Sherson, Erroll, "Lost London Playhouses", ''The Stage'', 28 June 1923, p. 21, one of a series of articles later published in a 1925 book of same name.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1860s and 1870s, burlesques were often one-act pieces running less than an hour and using [[pastiche]]s and parodies of popular songs, opera [[aria]]s and other music that the audience would readily recognize. [[Nellie Farren]] starred as the Gaiety Theatre's "principal boy" from 1868, and [[John D'Auban]] choreographed the burlesques there from 1868 to 1891.&lt;ref name=Timesobit&gt;"Mr. D'Auban's 'Startrap' Jumps". ''The Times'', 17 April 1922, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tm&gt;Biographical file for John D'Auban, list of productions and theatres, [[The Theatre Museum]], London (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward O'Connor Terry]] joined the theatre in 1876. Early Gaiety burlesques included ''[[Robert the Devil (Gilbert)|Robert the Devil]]'' (1868, by Gilbert), ''The Bohemian G-yurl and the Unapproachable Pole'' (1877), ''Blue Beard'' (1882), ''Ariel'' (1883, by [[F. C. Burnand]]) and ''[[Galatea, or Pygmalion Reversed]]'' (1883).

Beginning in the 1880s, when comedian-writer [[Fred Leslie]] joined the Gaiety, composers like [[Meyer Lutz]] and [[Osmond Carr]] contributed original music to the burlesques, which were extended to a full-length two- or three-act format.&lt;ref&gt;"Theatrical Humour in the Seventies", ''[[The Times]]'', 20 February 1914, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; These later Gaiety burlesques starred Farren and Leslie.  They often included Leslie's [[libretti]], written under his pseudonym, "A. C. Torr",&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Maurice. 'The spark that lit the bonfire', in ''Gilbert and Sullivan News'' (London) Spring 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and were usually given an original score by Lutz: ''[[Little Jack Sheppard]]'' (1885), ''[[Monte Cristo Jr.]]'' (1886), ''Pretty Esmeralda'' (1887), ''[[Frankenstein, or The Vampire's Victim]]'' (1887),&lt;ref&gt;Hollingshead, pp. 14 and 55&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mazeppa'' and ''[[Faust up to Date]]'' (1888).  ''[[Ruy Blas and the Blase Roue|Ruy Blas and the Blasé Roué]]'' (1889) made fun of the play ''[[Ruy Blas]]'' by [[Victor Hugo]].&lt;ref&gt;Hollingshead, pp. 57–58&lt;/ref&gt;  The title was a pun, and the worse the pun, the more Victorian audiences were amused.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Donald J., [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3825187 "The Uses of Victorian Laughter",] ''Victorian Studies'', Vol. 10, No. 2 (December 1966), pp. 145–76,  Indiana University Press, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The last Gaiety burlesques were ''[[Carmen up to Data]]'' (1890),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Archive/August/prog1detail1.htm |title=Programme for ''Carmen up to Data'' |access-date=10 December 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210092757/http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Archive/August/prog1detail1.htm |archive-date=10 December 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adams, pp. 254–55&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Cinder Ellen up too Late]]'' (1891), and ''Don Juan'' (1892, with lyrics by [[Adrian Ross]]).&lt;ref&gt;Hollingshead, pp. 63–64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cuttings&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Gaiety.htm Arthur Lloyd Music Hall site (on Gaiety) ''Cuttings''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080104132022/http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Gaiety.htm |date=4 January 2008 }} accessed 01 Mar 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1890s, Farren retired, Leslie died, and musical burlesque went out of fashion in London, as the focus of the Gaiety and other burlesque theatres changed to the new genre of [[Edwardian musical comedy]].&lt;ref&gt;Gänzl, Kurt.

From her retirement, Nellie Farren endorsed this judgment.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, W. Davenport. "Burlesque: Old ''v.'' New", ''The Theatre'', 1 March 1896, pp. 144–45&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zoology''' ({{IPAc-en|z|u|ˈ|ɒ|l|ə|dʒ|i|,_|z|oʊ|-}}) or '''animal biology''' is the branch of [[biology]] that studies the animal kingdom, including the [[anatomy|structure]], [[embryology]], [[evolution]], [[Biological classification|classification]], [[Ethology|habits]], and distribution of all [[animal]]s, both living and [[extinction|extinct]], and how they interact with their ecosystems. The term is derived from [[Ancient Greek]] ζῷον, ''zōion'', i.e. "[[animal]]" and λόγος, ''logos'', i.e. "knowledge, study".&lt;ref name=OnlineEtDict&gt;{{cite web|title=zoology|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=zoology&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Ancient history to Darwin===
[[File:Gessner Conrad 1516-1565.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Conrad Gesner]] (1516–1565). His ''[[Historiae animalium (Gesner)|Historiae animalium]]'' is considered the beginning of modern zoology.]]
{{Main article|History of zoology (through 1859)}}

The history of zoology traces the study of the [[animal|animal kingdom]] from ancient to modern times. Although the concept of ''zoology'' as a single coherent field arose much later, the zoological sciences emerged from [[natural history]] reaching back to the [[Aristotle's biology|biological works of Aristotle]] and [[Galen]] in the ancient [[Greco-Roman world]]. This ancient work was further developed in the Middle Ages by [[Islamic medicine|Muslim physicians]] and scholars such as [[Albertus Magnus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Mehmet|last=Bayrakdar |year=1986 |title=Al-Jahiz and the rise of biological evolution |journal=Ankara Üniversitesi İlahiyat Fakültesi Dergisi |publisher=[[Ankara University|Ankara Üniversitesi İlahiyat Fakültesi]]|volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=307–15 |url=http://dergiler.ankara.edu.tr/dergiler/37/772/9842.pdf |doi=10.1501/Ilhfak_0000000674|accessdate=21 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Thinking about Life: The History and Philosophy of Biology and Other Sciences|author1=Paul S.

Prominent in this movement were [[Vesalius]] and [[William Harvey]], who used experimentation and careful observation in physiology, and naturalists such as [[Carl Linnaeus]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]], and [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]] who began to [[Scientific classification|classify the diversity of life]] and the [[fossil record]], as well as the development and behavior of organisms. [[Microscopy]] revealed the previously unknown world of microorganisms, laying the groundwork for [[cell theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lois N. Magner |title=A History of the Life Sciences, Revised and Expanded |year=2002 |publisher=CRC Press |pages=133–144 |isbn=0-8247-0824-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The growing importance of [[natural theology]], partly a response to the rise of [[mechanical philosophy]], encouraged the growth of [[natural history]] (although it entrenched the [[teleological argument|argument from design]]).

Over the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, zoology became an increasingly professional [[scientific discipline]]. Explorer-naturalists such as [[Alexander von Humboldt]] investigated the interaction between organisms and their environment, and the ways this relationship depends on geography, laying the foundations for [[biogeography]], [[ecology]] and [[ethology]]. Naturalists began to reject [[essentialism]] and consider the importance of [[extinction]] and the [[history of evolutionary thought|mutability of species]]. [[Cell theory]] provided a new perspective on the fundamental basis of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jan Sapp |title=Genesis: The Evolution of Biology |year=2003 |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Chapter 7 |isbn=0-19-515619-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=William Coleman |title=Biology in the Nineteenth Century |year=1978 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |chapter=Chapter 2 |isbn=0-521-29293-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Darwin===
{{Main article|History of zoology (since 1859)}}
These developments, as well as the results from [[embryology]] and [[paleontology]], were synthesized in [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]]. In 1859, Darwin placed the theory of organic evolution on a new footing, by his discovery of a process by which organic evolution can occur, and provided observational evidence that it had done so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Why Evolution is True |author=Jerry A. Coyne |year=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location= Oxford |isbn=0-19-923084-6 |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin gave a new direction to [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] and [[physiology]], by uniting them in a common biological theory: the theory of organic evolution. The result was a reconstruction of the classification of animals upon a [[genealogical]] basis, fresh investigation of the development of animals, and early attempts to determine their genetic relationships. The end of the 19th century saw the fall of [[spontaneous generation]] and the rise of the [[germ theory of disease]], though the mechanism of [[biological inheritance|inheritance]] remained a mystery. In the early 20th century, the rediscovery of [[Gregor Mendel|Mendel's]] work led to the rapid development of [[genetics]], and by the 1930s the combination of [[population genetics]] and natural selection in the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] created [[evolutionary biology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Science and Creationism: a view from the National Academy of Sciences |url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=6024&amp;page=28 |format=php |accessdate= September 24, 2009 |edition=Second |year= 1999 |publisher=The National Academy of Sciences |location=Washington, DC |isbn=-0-309-06406-6 |page=28 |chapter=Appendix: Frequently Asked Questions |chapterurl=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=6024&amp;page=27#p200064869970027001 |ref=NAS }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

===Structural===
[[Cell biology]] studies the structural and [[physiology|physiological]] properties of [[cell (biology)|cells]], including their [[behavior]], interactions, and [[natural environment|environment]]. This is done on both the [[microscope|microscopic]] and [[molecule|molecular]] levels, for single-celled organisms such as [[bacterium|bacteria]] as well as the specialized cells in multicellular organisms such as [[human]]s.  Understanding the structure and function of cells is fundamental to all of the biological sciences. The similarities and differences between cell types are particularly relevant to molecular biology.

[[Anatomy]] considers the forms of macroscopic structures such as [[organ (biology)|organs]] and organ systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Henry Gray |title=Anatomy of the Human Body |year=1918 |publisher=Lea &amp; Febiger|url=http://www.bartleby.com/107/1.html |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It focuses on how organs and organ systems work together in the bodies of humans and animals, in addition to how they work independently. Anatomy and cell biology are two studies that are closely related, and can be categorized under "structural" studies.

===Physiological===
[[File:Dog anatomy anterior view.jpg|thumb|Animal anatomical engraving from ''Handbuch der Anatomie der Tiere für Künstler''.]]
Physiology studies the mechanical, physical, and biochemical processes of living organisms by attempting to understand how all of the structures function as a whole. The theme of "structure to function" is central to biology. Physiological studies have traditionally been divided into [[plant physiology]] and [[animal physiology]], but some principles of physiology are universal, no matter what particular [[organism]] is being studied. For example, what is learned about the physiology of [[yeast]] cells can also apply to human cells. The field of animal physiology extends the tools and methods of [[human physiology]] to non-human species. Physiology studies how for example [[nervous system|nervous]], [[immune system|immune]], [[endocrine system|endocrine]], [[respiratory system|respiratory]], and [[circulatory system|circulatory]] systems, function and interact.

===Evolutionary===
Evolutionary research is concerned with the origin and descent of [[species]], as well as their change over time, and includes scientists from many taxonomically oriented disciplines. For example, it generally involves scientists who have special training in particular [[organism]]s such as [[mammalogy]], [[ornithology]], [[herpetology]], or [[entomology]], but use those organisms as systems to answer general questions about evolution.

===Classification===
[[Biological classification|Scientific classification in zoology]], is a method by which zoologists group and categorize [[organism]]s by [[biological type]], such as [[genus]] or [[species]]. Biological classification is a form of [[Taxonomy (biology)|scientific taxonomy]]. Modern biological classification has its root in the work of [[Carl Linnaeus]], who grouped species according to shared physical characteristics. These groupings have since been revised to improve consistency with the [[Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] principle of [[common descent]]. [[Molecular phylogenetics]], which uses [[DNA sequences]] as data, has driven many recent revisions and is likely to continue to do so. Biological classification belongs to the science of [[systematics|zoological systematics]].

[[File:Linnaeus - Regnum Animale (1735).png|thumb|left|Linnaeus's table of the animal kingdom from the first edition of ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' (1735).]]
Many scientists now consider the [[five-kingdom system]] outdated. Modern alternative classification systems generally start with the [[three-domain system]]: [[Archaea]] (originally Archaebacteria); [[Bacterium|Bacteria]] (originally Eubacteria); [[Eukaryote|Eukaryota]] (including [[protist]]s, [[fungi]], [[plant]]s, and [[animal]]s)&lt;ref name="domain"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Woese C, Kandler O, Wheelis M | title = Towards a natural system of organisms: proposal for the domains Archaea, Bacteria, and Eucarya | url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/87/12/4576 | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume = 87 | issue = 12 | pages = 4576–9 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2112744 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.87.12.4576 | pmc = 54159 | ref = harv | bibcode=1990PNAS...87.4576W}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These domains reflect whether the cells have nuclei or not, as well as differences in the chemical composition of the cell exteriors.&lt;ref name="domain"/&gt;

Further, each kingdom is broken down recursively until each species is separately classified. The order is:
[[Domain (biology)|Domain]]; [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdom]]; [[phylum]]; [[Class (biology)|class]]; [[Order (biology)|order]]; [[Family (biology)|family]]; [[genus]]; [[species]]. The scientific name of an organism is generated from its genus and species. For example, humans are listed as ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. ''Homo'' is the genus, and ''sapiens'' the specific epithet, both of them combined make up the species name. When writing the scientific name of an organism, it is proper to capitalize the first letter in the genus and put all of the specific epithet in lowercase. Additionally, the entire term may be italicized or underlined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=hVUU7Gq8QskC&amp;lpg=PA198&amp;dq=species%20epithet%20capitalize&amp;pg=PA198#v=onepage&amp;q=species%20epithet%20capitalize | page = 198 | title = Writing for Science and Engineering: Papers, Presentation | author = Heather Silyn-Roberts | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-7506-4636-5 | publisher = Butterworth-Heinemann | location = Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dominant classification system is called the [[Linnaean taxonomy]]. It includes ranks and [[binomial nomenclature]]. The classification, [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], and nomenclature of zoological organisms is administered by the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]. A merging draft, BioCode, was published in 1997 in an attempt to standardize nomenclature, but has yet to be formally adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | title=The BioCode: Integrated biological nomenclature for the 21st century? | booktitle=Proceedings of a Mini-Symposium on Biological Nomenclature in the 21st Century | author=John McNeill | date=4 November 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethology===
[[File:Larus Dominicanus with young.jpg|right|thumb|[[Kelp gull]] chicks peck at red spot on mother's beak to stimulate the regurgitating reflex.]]
[[Ethology]] is the [[scientific method|scientific]] and objective study of animal behavior under natural conditions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of ETHOLOGY|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ethology|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=30 October 2012|quote=2 : the scientific and objective study of animal behaviour especially under natural conditions }}&lt;/ref&gt;  as opposed to [[behaviourism]], which focuses on behavioral response studies in a laboratory setting.  Ethologists have been particularly concerned with the [[evolution]] of behavior and the understanding of behavior in terms of the theory of [[natural selection]]. In one sense, the first modern ethologist was [[Charles Darwin]], whose book, ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]],'' influenced many future ethologists.&lt;ref name="black"&gt;{{Cite journal | pmc = 1279921 | pmid = 12042386 |date=Jun 2002 | author = Black, J | title = Darwin in the world of emotions | volume = 95 | issue = 6 | pages = 311–3 | issn = 0141-0768 | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine | url = http://www.jrsm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12042386 | format = Free full text | doi = 10.1258/jrsm.95.6.311 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biogeography===

[[Biogeography]] studies the spatial distribution of organisms on the [[Earth]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wiley, R. H. |year=1981 |title=Social structure and individual ontogenies: problems of description, mechanism, and evolution |journal= Perspectives in ethology |volume=4 |issue= |pages=105–133 |url=http://www.unc.edu/home/rhwiley/pdfs/IndividualOntogenies.pdf |accessdate=21 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; focusing on topics like [[plate tectonics]], [[climate change]], [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]] and [[Animal migration|migration]], and [[cladistics]]. The creation of this study is widely accredited to [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], a British biologist who had some of his work jointly published with [[Charles Darwin]].

Although the study of animal life is ancient, its scientific incarnation is relatively modern. This mirrors the transition from [[natural history]] to [[biology]] at the start of the 19th century. Since [[John Hunter (surgeon)|Hunter]] and [[Georges Cuvier|Cuvier]], comparative [[Anatomy|anatomical]] study has been associated with morphography, shaping the modern areas of zoological investigation:  [[anatomy]], [[physiology]], [[histology]], [[embryology]], [[teratology]] and [[ethology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/zoology#toc48756|title=zoology|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-09-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern zoology first arose in German and British universities. In Britain, [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] was a prominent figure. His ideas were centered on the [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] of animals. Many consider him the greatest comparative anatomist of the latter half of the 19th century. Similar to [[John Hunter (surgeon)|Hunter]], his courses were composed of lectures and laboratory practical classes in contrast to the previous format of lectures only.

Gradually zoology expanded beyond Huxley's [[comparative anatomy]] to include the following sub-disciplines:
* [[Zoography]], also known as ''descriptive zoology'', is the applied science of describing animals and their [[habitat]]s
* [[Comparative anatomy]] studies the structure of animals
* [[Animal physiology]]
* [[Behavioral ecology]]
* [[Ethology]] studies animal behavior
* [[Invertebrate zoology]]
* [[Vertebrate zoology]]
* [[Soil zoology]]
* The various taxonomically oriented disciplines such as [[mammalogy]], [[biological anthropology]], [[herpetology]], [[ornithology]], and [[entomology]] identify and classify [[species]] and study the structures and mechanisms specific to those groups.

Related fields:
* [[Evolutionary biology]]: Development of both animals and plants is considered in the articles on [[evolution]], [[population genetics]], [[heredity]], [[Genetic variability|variation]], [[Mendelism]], and [[reproduction]].
* [[Molecular biology]] studies the common [[genetics|genetic]] and developmental mechanisms of animals and plants
* [[Palaeontology]]
* [[Systematics]], [[cladistics]], [[phylogenetics]], [[phylogeography]], [[biogeography]], and [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] classify and group species via common descent and regional associations.
