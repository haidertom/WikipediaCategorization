[[File:AVA from Spruce St.jpg|thumb|The Academy of Vocal Arts as seen from Spruce Street]]
The '''Academy of Vocal Arts''' (AVA) is a school dedicated to providing free higher education to aspiring [[opera]] singers. The school was founded in 1934 by Helen Corning Warden and is located at 1920 Spruce Street in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/north-america/united-states/pennsylvania/philadelphia/attraction-detail.html?vid=1154654657102&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=Academy%20of%20Vocal%20Arts&amp;st=cse New York Times 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820045152/http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/north-america/united-states/pennsylvania/philadelphia/attraction-detail.html?vid=1154654657102&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=Academy%20of%20Vocal%20Arts&amp;st=cse |date=August 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
During the [[Great Depression]], few people could afford any kind of higher education, especially the long and costly training needed for a career in opera. Recognizing this difficulty, Helen Corning Warden, a prominent member of Philadelphia society, set out to establish a school where talented singers could receive highest quality training without having to suffer the financial burdens that such an education would normally entail. Encouraged by voice teacher Edgar Milton Cooke, Mrs. Warden and a group of her friends set out to establish a school for professional singers that would provide tuition-free education.

For more than six decades, gifted singers have come from throughout the world to seek training. Many current and former teachers, such as Sidney Dietch, Nicola Moscona, Giovanni Consiglio, Louis Quilico, Benita Valente, Nell Rankin, Bill Schuman and William Stone, have had highly successful careers.  Admission into AVA's four-year program is highly competitive, with approximately 28 singers enrolled in any given year. Today, AVA is the only tuition-free institution dedicated exclusively to the study of voice.

Helen Corning Warden served as the Academy's chairperson until her death. She was succeeded by her daughter, [[Adele W. Paxson|Adele Warden Paxson]], who was followed by her daughter, Sally Paxson Davis.  Since 1977, Christofer Macatsoris has held the position of music director.  Baritone and 1983 alum K. James McDowell has served as president and artistic director since 1987.

==Program==
The program of training offered by the Academy of Vocal Arts is centered on one-on-one repertoire coaching with a faculty of conductors and coaches and a weekly voice lesson with one of AVA's esteemed voice instructors. The program also includes French, German and Italian language classes, movement &amp; dance, stagecraft and stage combat classes, history of opera &amp; care of the professional voice seminars, and professional development coaching through private classes and workshops. AVA mounts four operatic productions each year featuring resident artists in leading and supporting roles, produced and directed by visiting professional directors with full orchestra. Additionally, chamber music recitals, a sacred music concert and an annual vocal competition feature in the Academy's season. Resident artists are given opportunities to audition for visiting companies from the US and Europe as well as international agents and managers. The Academy of Vocal Arts is also unique among training institutions in offering all residents merit-based fellowships to help offset the cost of living expenses while attending AVA.

==Alumni==
Notable alumni of the school include: [[Lando Bartolini]], [[Burak Bilgili]], [[Gwendolyn Bradley]], [[Stephen Costello (tenor)|Stephen Costello]], [[Joyce DiDonato]], [[Michael Fabiano]], [[Othalie Graham]], [[Eglise Gutiérrez]], [[Bryan Hymel]], [[Angela Meade]], [[Latonia Moore]], [[James Morris (bass-baritone)|James Morris]], [[Ailyn Pérez]], [[Seymour Schwartzman]], [[Gregory Stapp]],  [[Ruth Ann Swenson]], [[Richard Troxell]], [[James Valenti]],   and [[Beverly Wolff]].

Many AVA alumni have national and international careers as   operatic soloists. From 2009 to 2012, every recipient of the [[Richard Tucker Award]] was an AVA graduate. Current resident artists have been selected as grand final winners of the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions every year since 2011. Each year since 2012, the Metropolitan Opera's Beverly Sills Award has been awarded to an AVA alumnus.

Between 1890 and 1918, [[Scramble for Africa|Western colonial expansion in Africa]] led to the removal of many pieces of sub-Saharan [[African art]] that were subsequently brought to Europe and displayed.&lt;ref name="Coombes 1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Coombes|first=Annie E.|title=Reinventing Africa : museums, material culture and popular imagination in late Victorian and Edwardian England|year=1997|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=0300068905|edition=2nd pr}}&lt;/ref&gt; These objects entered the collections of natural history museums, art museums (both encyclopedic and specialist) and private collections in Europe and the United States.

==The removal of African artworks from their source countries during the 19th Century==
Before the [[Berlin Conference]] of 1885, traders and explorers to Africa bought or stole art as souvenirs and [[wikt:curios|curios]],&lt;ref name="Schildkrout and Keim" /&gt; speading beyond the coast; ivory objects made along African coasts had been collected for centuries, and many were made by Africans for European markets in a style matching European taste, mainly in areas reached by the Portuguese, the [[Kongo_ivories#Afro-Portuguese_ivories|Afro-Portuguese ivories]]. The period dominated by curio collecting, in which objects served as souvenirs, was followed by a period of trophy collecting in which large collections of artifacts (mostly weapons), and animal skins, horns, and tusks from hunting expeditions, were a tangible means of showing penetration, conquest and domination.&lt;ref name="Schildkrout and Keim"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Scramble for Art in Central Africa|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|editor=Enid Schildkrout and Curtis A. Keim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the 1870s, thousands of African sculptures arrived in Europe in the aftermath of colonial conquest and exploratory expeditions. They were placed on view in museums such as the [[Musée d'Ethnographie du Trocadéro]], founded in 1878 in Paris, and its counterparts in other European cities.&lt;ref name="Murrell, African Influences" /&gt; At the time, these objects were treated as artifacts of colonized cultures rather than as artworks and were very cheap, often sold in flea markets and pawnshops.&lt;ref name="Murrell, African Influences"&gt;{{cite web|last=Denise|first=Murrell|title=African Influences in Modern Art|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/aima/hd_aima.htm|work=Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|location=New York|date=April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==European collections==
[[File:Musée du Congo, Tervuren, Belgium; one of five interior scen Wellcome V0014543.jpg|thumb|Art on display at the [[Royal Museum of Central Africa]].]]

The different histories of museums inEurope and the United States affected the collecting and display of African art in both places.&lt;ref name="Berzock &amp; Clark 2011" /&gt; European museums typically were founded as state institutions and thus their collections and displays were shaped by national interests. The appreciation of African objects purely as fine art in Europe was largely limited to private galleries in the early twentieth century. In Paris, dealers such [[Paul Guillaume]], [[Charles Ratton]] and [[Louis Carre]] played a role in the formation of major private collections of African art. The latter half of the twentieth century saw the opening of the first European art museums devoted to collecting and displaying African art, including the [[Barbier-Mueller Museum|Musee Barbier-Mueller]] in Geneva (1977), the [[Musee Dapper]] in Paris (1986),&lt;ref name="Berzock &amp; Clark 2011" /&gt; but many if not most general national art museums by then had collections.

===Royal Museum for Central Africa in Belgium===
In 1897, [[King Leopold II]] took advantage of the [[Brussels International Exhibition]] in [[Tervuren]] to promote his holdings of the [[Congo Free State|Congo]]. The [[Brussels International (1897)|1897 International Exhibition]] piqued scientific interest in the people and animals of Central Africa, thus King Leopold II decided to build on his promotion of Congo. The [[Royal Museum of Central Africa]] was established in 1898 as a permanent museum and scientific institution responsible for mounting exhibitions for the Belgian public and encouraging the study of Central Africa.&lt;ref name="Royal Museum for Central Africa"&gt;{{cite web|title=History: From Congo Museum to RMCA|url=http://www.africamuseum.be/museum/about-us/museum/history/Congomuseum|work=Royal Museum for Central Africa|accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===British Museum===

The Sainsbury African Galleries in the [[British Museum]] in London display 600 objects from the greatest permanent collection of African arts and culture in the world. The three permanent galleries provide a substantial exhibition space for the Museum's African collection comprising over 200,000 objects. A curatorial scope that encompasses both archaeological and contemporary material, including both unique masterpieces of artistry and objects of everyday life. A great addition was material amassed by Sir [[Henry Wellcome]], which was donated by the [[Wellcome Collection|Wellcome Historical Medical Museum]] in 1954. 

Highlights of the African collection include the [[Benin Bronzes|Benin]] and [[Igbo-Ukwu]] bronze sculptures, the beautiful [[Bronze Head of Queen Idia]], a magnificent [[Bronze Head from Ife|brass head]] of a Yoruba ruler from [[Ife]], the [[Apapa Hoard]] from Lagos, southern Nigeria, a dozen exquisite [[Kongo ivories#Afro-Portuguese ivories|Afro-Portuguese ivories]], Asante goldwork from Ghana including the [[Thomas Edward Bowdich|Bowdich]] collection, the rare [[Akan Drum]] from the same region in West Africa, a series of soapstone figures from the [[Kissi people]] in Sierra Leone and Liberia, the [[Emil Torday|Torday]] collection of Central African sculpture, textiles and weaponry, important material from Ethiopia following the [[British Expedition to Abyssinia]], the unique [[Luzira Head]] from Uganda, excavated objects from [[Great Zimbabwe]] and satellite towns such as [[Mutare]] including a large hoard of Iron Age soapstone figures, a rare divining bowl from the [[Venda]] peoples and cave paintings and [[petroglyph]]s from [[Wildebeest Kuil Rock Art Centre|South Africa]].


The [[Benin Bronzes]] were seized by a [[United Kingdom|British]] force in the [[Benin Expedition of 1897]] and given to the British [[Foreign Office]]. As Paula Girshick Ben-Amos, a professor of anthropology and African Studies at Indiana University, states in The Art of Benin, “art of the Benin Kingdom came to public and scholarly attention in the West in 1897 when members of a British Punitive Expedition brought out thousands of objects as war booty.”2

Around 200 of the bronzes were passed on to the British Museum, while the remainder were divided among a variety of collections, with the majority being purchased by [[Felix von Luschan]] on behalf of the ''Königliches Museum für Völkerkunde'' in [[Berlin]] (the present-day [[Ethnological Museum of Berlin|Ethnological Museum]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=von Luschan|first=Feliz|title=Die Altertümer von Benin|year=1919|location=Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, Oba [[Akenzua II]] began the movement to return the corpus of objects now known in modern discourse as the 'Benin Bronzes'.

===Musée d'Ethnographie du Trocadéro===
The Musée d'Ethnographie du Trocadéro was the first [[Anthropology|anthropological]] museum in Paris, founded in 1878. It closed in 1935 when the building that housed it, the [[Trocadéro#The old Palais du Trocadéro|Trocadéro Palace]], was demolished; its descendant is the [[Musée de l'Homme]], housed in the [[Trocadéro#The new Palais de Chaillot|Palais de Chaillot]] on the same site, and its French collections formed the nucleus of the [[Musée national des Arts et Traditions Populaires (France)|Musée National des Arts et Traditions Populaires]], also in the Palais de Chaillot. Numerous [[Fauvism|Fauvist]] and [[Cubism|Cubist]] artists discovered African art at the Trocadéro Museum.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Paul Crespelle, ''The Fauves'', tr. Anita Brookner, Greenwich, Connecticut: New York Graphic Society, 1962, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=fLIcTrzKNJOssAPtgrmhBQ&amp;ct=result&amp;id=yxcOAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Fauves+Trocad%C3%A9ro&amp;q=In+1904%2C+the+two+had+been+in+the+habit+of+visiting+the+Trocadero+Museum+%E2%80%94+ancestor+of+the+Musee+de+I%27Homme+%E2%80%94+to+look+at+the+African+and+Polynesian+collections.+They+regarded+them+simply+as+curiosities%2C+and+it+was+not+until#search_anchor p. 114].&lt;/ref&gt; Picasso said that this art taught him "what painting was all about", seeing it in the museum's African masks, which had been created "as a kind of mediation between [humanity] and the unknown hostile forces that [surround us]",&lt;ref name=Gilot266&gt;Françoise Gilot and Carlton Lake, ''Life with Picasso'', 1964, repr. New York: Anchor/Doubleday, 1989, {{ISBN|978-0-385-26186-9}}, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=9eEZTuqRHoiisAPa8fDPDQ&amp;ct=result&amp;sqi=2&amp;id=8TfYAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Picasso+depressed+Gilot&amp;q=Trocadero#search_anchor p. 266].&lt;/ref&gt;  and to have been influenced by the masks in the forms of the figures in [[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]], which eventually led to Cubism.&lt;ref&gt;According to Christopher Green, ''Picasso: Architecture and Vertigo'', New Haven, Connecticut: Yale University, 2005, {{ISBN|978-0-300-10412-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=e2V5dnM_x4UC&amp;pg=PA51 p. 51] this is "generally accepted" although denied by Picasso himself.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur I. Miller]], ''Einstein, Picasso: Space, Time and the Beauty that Causes Havoc'', New York: Basic, 2001, {{ISBN|978-0-465-01859-8}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=VEPaSUitrDkC&amp;pg=PA92 p. 92]: [A]lthough the sharp change in the right-hand demoiselles occurred after Picasso's visit to Trocadéro, . . . . [i]t turns out that African art supported his conceptual approach and convinced him of the deep meaning of geometry as the language of the new art."&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the African collection has since been transferred to the [[Musee du Quai Branly]].

==African art in ethnological collections==

Initially, all African art objects were viewed as [[ethnographic]] specimens.  Notably, during the period of 1890 through 1913, all large museums redefined their public image in terms of an educational prerogative.&lt;ref name="Coombes 1997" /&gt; In response to the debate around the use of the terms ''curio'' and ''curiosity'', the League of the Empire in 1904 recommended the "orderly arrangement and the transformation of mere curios into objects of scientific interest by appropriate classification."{{Ref|1}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=none|journal=Museums Journal|date=September 1904|volume=4|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, as a means of validating the expansion of ethnographic collections, the rhetoric often employed was one of the necessity of conservation and preservation in the face of the inevitable extinction of the producers of the materials culture in their custody (121).

[[Stewart Culin]], curator at the [[Brooklyn Museum]], was the first American curator to display ethnological collections as art objects, not as ethnographic specimens, which he did in 1923. Culin distinguished his installation from those of contemporaneous ethnological collections at institutions such as the [[American Museum of Natural History]] and the [[Smithsonian Museum of Natural History]] in saying that "the objects of Negro art which are displayed publicly form part of museum collections of African ethnology and receive no special attention at the hands of ethnologists... In the majority of these collections their artistic significance is obscured by the wealth of material, and lost, not infrequently, in the efforts made for its elucidation."&lt;ref name="Culin 1923"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Culin|first=Stewart|title=Negro art|journal=Brooklyn Museum Quarterly|year=1923|volume=10|issue=3|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Siegmann 2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Siegmann|first=William C.|title=African art a century at the Brooklyn Museum|year=2009|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|location=Brooklyn, NY|isbn=9780872731639|author2=Dumouchelle, Kevin D. (contributions)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''Art/Artifact'', an exhibition organized by [[Susan Vogel]] in 1988, presented 160 objects of art and ethnography selected from the [[Buffalo Museum of Science]], the [[Hampton University Museum]] (Virginia), and the [[American Museum of Natural History]] (New York City). All three are anthropology museums founded in the 1860s with distinguished African collections. The exhibition examined the shifting definitions of art and artifact, and dealt with the question of how we look at objects from traditional African cultures whose classification systems differ from contemporary Western culture.

==African art and Western Modernism==
During the early 1900s, the aesthetics of traditional African sculpture became a powerful influence among European artists who formed an avant-garde in the development of modern art, known as the "[[Primitivism]]" movement.&lt;ref name="Murrell, African Influences" /&gt; In France, [[Henri Matisse]], [[Pablo Picasso]], and their [[School of Paris]] friends blended the highly stylized treatment of the human figure in African sculptures with painting styles derived from the [[post-Impressionist]] works of [[Cézanne]] and [[Gauguin]]. The resulting pictorial flatness, vivid color palette, and fragmented [[Cubist]] shapes helped to define early [[modernism]]. While these artists knew nothing of the original meaning and function of the West and Central African sculptures they encountered, they claimed to instantly recognize the spiritual aspect of the composition and to adapt these qualities to their own efforts to move beyond the naturalism that had defined Western art since the Renaissance.&lt;ref name="Murrell, African Influences" /&gt;

[[German Expressionist]] painters such as [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]] of [[Die Brücke]] (The Bridge) group, based in [[Dresden]] and [[Berlin]], conflated African aesthetics with the emotional intensity of dissonant color tones and figural distortion, to depict the anxieties of modern life, while [[Paul Klee]] of the [[Blaue Reiter]] (Blue Rider) in [[Munich]] developed transcendent symbolic imagery.&lt;ref name="Murrell, African Influences" /&gt; The Expressionists' interest in non-Western art intensified after a 1910 [[Gauguin]] exhibition in [[Dresden]], while modernist movements in Italy, England, and the United States initially engaged with African art through contacts with School of Paris artists. These [[avant-garde]] artists, their dealers, and leading critics of the era were among the first Europeans to collect African sculptures for their aesthetic value.

==American collections==
The 1913 [[Armory Show]] marked a seminal moment for America’s [[avant-garde]]. An exposition of about 1,300 works, it introduced the New York art audience to movements like [[Cubism]], [[Fauvism]] and [[Futurism]], as well as the work of European artists including [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]]. The Armory Show and its promotion of [[Modernism]] also helped create a taste and a market for African art in New York.&lt;ref name="Murrell, African Influences" /&gt;

Notably, in 1914 two New York galleries introduced African sculpture to their audiences: [[Robert J. Coady]]’s newly opened [[Washington Square Gallery]] and [[Alfred Stieglitz]]'s well-established [[Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession]]. Stieglitz’s held an exhibition in 1914 dedicated entirely to African artifacts as works of art.&lt;ref name="Met Press Room" /&gt;

New York City progressively positioned itself as a central marketplace for African art.&lt;ref name="Murrell, African Influences" /&gt; During the years 1915-19, American dealers began promoting African objects as art to a growing group of collectors. Among the dealers, Mexican artist [[Marius de Zayas]] (1880–1961) was largely responsible for helping some adventurous modern-art collectors, including [[Walter Arensberg|Walter and Louise Arensberg]], [[John Quinn (collector)|John Quinn]], and Agnes and [[Eugene Meyer (financier)|Eugene Meyer]], to build their African art collections. During the early 1920s, several American institutions began opening their doors to African art.&lt;ref name="Met Press Room"&gt;{{cite web|title=Special Exhibition Tells Story of How African Artifacts Were First Recognized as Art in U.S.|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/press-room/exhibitions/2012/african-art-new-york-and-the-avant-garde|work=Press Room|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brooklyn Museum===
[[File:Brooklyn Museum 69.133.5 Mask.jpg|thumb|upright|A mask of the [[We people]] at the Brooklyn Museum.]]
In 1903, [[Stewart Culin]] (1858–1929) became the founding curator of the Department of Ethnology at the Museum of the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences, now the [[Brooklyn Museum]].&lt;ref name="Siegmann 2009" /&gt;  Culin, a self-taught ethnologist, built the foundation of four curatorial collections for the Museum, acquiring objects representing African, Asian, Native American, and Eastern European cultures. Culin was among the first curators to recognize museum installation as an art form. He was also among the first to display ethnological collections as art objects, not as ethnographic specimens. This approach is evidenced in his exhibition "Primitive Negro Art, Chiefly from the Belgian Congo". The exhibition opened in April 1923, and displayed African objects he had acquired in Europe from dealers.

===Barnes Foundation===
[[Albert C. Barnes|Albert Barnes]] was one of the first American collectors to selectively acquire an extensive collection of African sculpture purely on aesthetic merits. In 1923, two years before the [[Barnes Foundation]] opening in [[Merion]], Pennsylvania, Barnes wrote, "When the foundation opens, negro art will have a place among the great manifestations of all times."&lt;ref&gt;Albert C. Barnes to Paul Guillaume, November 5, 1923, the Barnes Foundation Archives, Merion, Pennsylvania.&lt;/ref&gt; Through his active promotion of the foundation's collection of African sculpture and its aesthetic importance, Barnes himself played a critical role in fostering appreciation of African art in the United States in the early twentieth century.&lt;ref name="Berzock &amp; Clark 2011" /&gt;

===Museum of Primitive Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art===

Founded in 1954 by [[Nelson A. Rockefeller]] and [[Rene d'Harnoncourt]], the [[Museum of Primitive Art]] was the first art museum exclusively devoted to exhibiting and collecting works of art from Africa, Oceania, and the Americas for their aesthetic value rather than as ethnographic documents or colonial trophies.&lt;ref name="Ezra 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ezra|first=Kate|title=Representing Africa in American art museums : a century of collecting and display|year=2010|publisher=University of Washington Press|location=Seattle|isbn=9780295989617|authorlink=Collecting African Art at New York's Museum of Primitive Art|editor=Kathleen Bickford Berzock, Christa Clarke}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The museum closed in 1974, and its collection, staff and library were transferred to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] according to an agreement made between Rockefeller and the Met in 1969. The Museum of Primitive Art was in many ways an outgrowth of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA).&lt;ref name="Ezra 2010" /&gt;  It was located directly behind MoMA and was also built on Rockefeller-owned property. Rockefeller was MoMA's president and d'Harnoncourt was its director. MoMA's 1935 landmark exhibition African Negro Art was influential in shaping the director of the Museum of Primitive Art.&lt;ref name="Ezra 2010" /&gt; Today, the Museum of Primitive Art collection is housed in the Metropolitan Michael C. Rockefeller Wing.

===National Museum of African Art===
The [[National Museum of African Art]] in Washington D.C. was founded by [[Warren M. Robbins]] in 1964 as a private and relatively small collection. In 1979 the collection, by then about 8,000 objects, was taken over by the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and is now housed in a central if underground location on the [[National Mall]].

==Problems of display==
Many scholars and curators have debated the efficacy of different modes of display of African art in Western museums. Generally, scholars agree that the Western art museum was, and continues to be, incompatible with the contexts from which most traditional [[African arts]] emerged. The following quotation from Kathleen Bickford Berzock and Christa Clarke's introduction to their book ''Representing Africa in American Art Museum'' summarizes the reasons for this incompatibility:

{{quote|text="Art museums reinforced hierarchies of value based on media or genre, favoring paintings and sculpture created solely for artistic appreciation. In contrast, the visual arts of Africa encompass not only sculpture in wood and metal but also beadwork, textiles, basketry, and other works of diverse media, all of which may hold equal value for their creators. And while aesthetics may guide the production of art in Africa, often there are other social, religious, or political concerns that inform its design and use. With this range of forms and materials and the different circumstances of creation and use within society, the diverse arts of Africa were not suited to the aesthetic hierarchies and systems of classification established by art museums. Moreover, museum practices of collecting and display emphasized the artist as individual genius, the school of artists working in a similar style and vein, and chronology. Such categorization was not easily replicated with African objects, which were often collected with fragmentary documentation that rarely identified the individual artist or the specific time period of creation."&lt;ref name="Berzock &amp; Clark 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Berzock|first=Kathleen Bickford|title=Representing Africa in American Art Museums|year=2011|publisher=University of Washington Press|location=Seattle &amp; London|pages=3–19|authorlink=A Historical Introduction|author2=Christa Clark}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

==Post-1980s African Art==
Post-1980s [[curator]]ial approaches to collecting and displaying historical African art tend towards greater specialization, broadening definitions, and a desire for contextualization.&lt;ref name="Berzock &amp; Clark 2011" /&gt;

Curatorial debate surrounds questions about where boundaries should be drawn between traditional and modern, between African and the [[African diaspora]] in the Americas and Europe, and between [[sub-Saharan]] and [[North African]] art. In certain instances, tradition-based and contemporary works have been exhibited together, a practice that began with the exhibition "Astonishment and Power: Kingo Minkisi &amp; the Art of Renee Stout" at the National Museum of African Art in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="Atwood ARTnews"&gt;{{cite news|last=Atwood|first=Roger|title=African Art: Beyond the Masks|url=http://www.artnews.com/2012/09/17/beyond-the-masks/|accessdate=16 October 2013|newspaper=ARTnews|date=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this exhibition was criticized for suggesting a cultural continuity between pre-modern African art and African-American art today while ignoring crucial cultural differences between these two bodies of work.&lt;ref name="Cotter 1993"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cotter|first=Holland|title=ART VIEW; Art That's Valued for What It Can Do|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/18/arts/art-view-art-that-s-valued-for-what-it-can-do.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|accessdate=16 October 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=18 July 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Benin]] artist [[Meschac Gaba]]'s installation "Museum of Contemporary African Art" at [[Tate Modern]] belies the fact that there is no such thing as a museum of [[contemporary African art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Museum of Contemporary African Art|url=http://www.museumofcontemporaryafricanart.com/entree.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes==

'''Algorithmic art''', also known as ''algorithm art'', is art, mostly [[visual art]], of which the design is generated by an [[algorithm]]. Algorithmic artists are sometimes called '''algorists'''.

==Overview==
{{further|Mathematics and art}}
Algorithmic art, also known as [[computer-generated art]], is a subset of [[generative art]] (generated by an autonomous system) and is related to [[systems art]] (influenced by systems theory). [[Fractal art]] is an example of algorithmic art.&lt;ref name=UCSB&gt;{{cite web |title=Approximating Reality with Interactive Algorithmic Art |url=http://www.mat.ucsb.edu/~g.legrady/academic/courses/01sp200a/students/brentYokota/200a_fin.html |publisher=University of California Santa Barbara |accessdate=25 December 2015 |date=7 June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For an image of reasonable size, even the simplest [[algorithm]]s require too much calculation for manual execution to be practical, and they are thus executed on either a single computer or on a cluster of computers.  The final output is typically displayed on a [[computer monitor]], printed with a [[wikt:raster|raster]]-type printer, or drawn using a [[plotter]].  Variability can be introduced by using [[pseudo-random]] numbers.  There is no consensus as to whether the product of an algorithm that operates on an existing image (or on any input other than pseudo-random numbers) can still be considered computer-generated art, as opposed to computer-assisted art.&lt;ref name=UCSB/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Darb-i Imam shrine spandrel.JPG|thumb|left|[[Islamic geometric patterns]] such as this [[girih]] tiling in the [[Darb-e Imam]] shrine in [[Isfahan]], are precursors of algorithmic art.&lt;ref name=Verostko/&gt;]]

[[Roman Verostko]] argues that [[Islamic geometric patterns]] are constructed using algorithms, as are [[Italian Renaissance]] paintings which make use of [[mathematics and art|mathematical techniques]], in particular [[linear perspective]] and proportion.&lt;ref name=Verostko/&gt;

[[File:San Romano Battle (Paolo Uccello, London) 01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2&lt;!--width for very low image--&gt;|[[Paolo Uccello]] made innovative use of a geometric algorithm, incorporating [[linear perspective]] in paintings such as ''[[The Battle of San Romano]]'' (c. 1435–1460): broken lances run along perspective lines.]]

Some of the earliest known examples of computer-generated algorithmic art were created by [[Georg Nees]], [[Frieder Nake]], [[A. Michael Noll]], [[Manfred Mohr]] and [[:fr:Vera Molnár|Vera Molnár]] in the early 1960s. These artworks were executed by a [[plotter]] controlled by a [[computer]], and were therefore computer-generated art but not [[digital art]]. The act of creation lay in writing the [[Computer program|program]], which specified the sequence of actions to be performed by the [[plotter]]. [[Sonia Landy Sheridan]] established Generative Systems as a program at the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]] in 1970 in response to social change brought about in part by the computer-robot communications revolution.&lt;ref name = "SLS 83"&gt;Sonia Landy Sheridan, "Generative Systems versus Copy Art: A Clarification of Terms and Ideas", in: ''[[Leonardo Journal|Leonardo]]'', Vol. 16, No. 2 (Spring, 1983), pp. 103-108. {{doi|10.2307/1574794}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her early work with copier and telematic art focused on the differences between the human hand and the algorithm.&lt;ref name="MF1"&gt;Flanagan, Mary. "An Appreciation on the Impact of the work of Sonia Landy Sheridan." The Art of Sonia Landy Sheridan. Hanover, NH: [[Hood Museum of Art]], 2009, pp. 37–42.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Aside from the ongoing work of Roman Verostko and his fellow algorists, the next known examples are [[fractal art]]works created in the mid to late 1980s. These are important here because they use a different means of execution. Whereas the earliest algorithmic art was "drawn" by a [[plotter]], [[fractal art]] simply creates an image in [[computer memory]]; it is therefore [[digital art]]. The native form of a [[fractal art]]work is an image stored on a [[computer]]&amp;nbsp;–this is also true of very nearly all equation art and of most recent algorithmic art in general. However, in a stricter sense "fractal art" is not considered algorithmic art, because the algorithm is not devised by the artist.&lt;ref name=UCSB/&gt;

In light of such ongoing developments, pioneer algorithmic artist [[Ernest Edmonds]] has documented the continuing prophetic role of art in human affairs by tracing the early 1960s association between art and the computer up to a present time in which the algorithm is now widely recognized as a key concept for society as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mdpi.com/2076-0752/7/1/3|author=Ernest Edmonds|date=15 January 2018|title=Algorithmic Art Machines|publisher=Arts|doi=10.3390/arts7010003|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==The role of the algorithm==
[[File:Judson Rosebush Visions 15101 Computer Art April 22, 1978 JGR19780422 100.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|''Letter Field'' by Judson Rosebush, 1978. [[Calcomp plotter]] computer output with liquid inks on rag paper, 15.25 x 21 inches. This image was created using an early version of what became [[Digital Effects]]' Vision software, in [[APL (programming language)|APL]] and [[Fortran]] on an [[IBM 370]]/158. A database of the Souvenir font; [[Statistical randomness|random number]] generation, a statistical basis to determine letter size, color, and position; and a hidden line algorithm combine to produce this scan line [[raster image]], output to a plotter.]]

From one point of view, for a work of art to be considered algorithmic art, its creation must include a process based on an [[algorithm]] devised by the artist. Here, an algorithm is simply a detailed recipe for the design and possibly execution of an artwork, which may include [[computer code]], [[function (mathematics)|functions]], [[expression (mathematics)|expressions]], or other input which ultimately determines the form the art will take.&lt;ref name=Verostko/&gt; This input may be [[mathematical]], [[computation]]al, or generative in nature. Inasmuch as algorithms tend to be [[deterministic]], meaning that their repeated execution would always result in the production of identical artworks, some external factor is usually introduced. This can either be a random number generator of some sort, or an external body of data (which can range from recorded heartbeats to frames of a movie.) Some artists also work with organically based gestural input which is then modified by an algorithm. By this definition, [[fractal]]s made by a fractal program are not art, as humans are not involved. However, defined differently, algorithmic art can be seen to include fractal art, as well as other varieties such as those using [[genetic algorithm]]s. The artist [[Kerry Mitchell]] stated in his 1999 ''Fractal Art Manifesto'':&lt;ref name=Mitchell2009&gt;{{cite book |last=Mitchell |first=Kerry |title=Selected Works |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-QUyAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA7 |date=24 July 2009| publisher=Lulu.com&lt;!--This book is published by the artist himself, and can be relied on only for his own point of view.--&gt;|isbn=978-0-557-08398-5|pages=7–8}} This artist is notable for his place in the Fractal Art movement, as is his opinion and manifesto.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UCSB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mitchell, Kerry |title=The Fractal Art Manifesto |url=https://www.fractalus.com/info/manifesto.htm |publisher=Fractalus.com |accessdate=27 December 2015 |date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Fractal Art is not..Computer(ized) Art, in the sense that the computer does all the work. The work is executed on a computer, but only at the direction of the artist. Turn a computer on and leave it alone for an hour. When you come back, no art will have been generated.&lt;ref name=Mitchell2009/&gt;}}

==Algorists==
"Algorist" is a term used for [[digital artist]]s who create algorithmic art.&lt;ref name=Verostko&gt;{{cite web |last1=Verostko |first1=Roman |title=Algorithmic Art |url=http://www.verostko.com/algorithm.html |date=1999 |origyear=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Algorists formally began correspondence and establishing their identity as artists following a panel titled "Art and Algorithms" at [[SIGGRAPH]] in 1995. The co-founders were [[Jean-Pierre Hébert]] and [[Roman Verostko]]. Hébert is credited with coining the term and its definition, which is in the form of his own algorithm:&lt;ref name=Verostko/&gt;

 if (creation &amp;&amp; object of art &amp;&amp; algorithm &amp;&amp; one's own algorithm) {
      return * an algorist *
 } else {
      return * not an algorist *
 }

[[Cellular automata]] can be used to generate artistic patterns with an appearance of randomness, or to modify images such as photographs by applying a transformation such as the stepping stone rule (to give an impressionist style) repeatedly until the desired artistic effect is achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hoke |first1=Brian P. |title=Cellular Automata and Art |url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/math5.pattern/FinalProject/Hoke.html |publisher=Dartmouth College |accessdate=24 December 2015 |date=21 August 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their use has also been explored in music.&lt;ref name="Burraston Edmonds 2005 pp. 165–185"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Burraston | first=Dave | last2=Edmonds | first2=Ernest | title=Cellular automata in generative electronic music and sonic art: a historical and technical review | journal=Digital Creativity | volume=16 | issue=3 | year=2005 | doi=10.1080/14626260500370882 | pages=165–185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fractal art]] consists of varieties of computer-generated [[fractals]] with colouring chosen to give an attractive effect.&lt;ref name="fgad"&gt;{{cite book |title=Fractal geometry in architecture and design |last=Bovill |first=Carl |year=1996 |publisher=Birkhauser |location=Boston |isbn=0-8176-3795-8 |page=153 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w5ptaiGsac4C |accessdate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially in the western world, it is not drawn or painted by hand. It is usually created indirectly with the assistance of [[fractal-generating software]], [[iteration|iterating]] through three phases: setting [[parameter]]s of appropriate fractal software; executing the possibly lengthy calculation; and evaluating the product. In some cases, other [[graphics software|graphics programs]] are used to further modify the images produced. This is called post-processing. Non-fractal imagery may also be integrated into the artwork.&lt;ref name="mra"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.casperjournal.com/article_bbe58a64-0b86-5e64-8fc5-459eafbe67fb.html |title=Meet Reginald Atkins, mathematical artist |author=Conner, Elysia |date=25 February 2009 |publisher=CasperJournal.com |accessdate=28 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetic or evolutionary art makes use of [[genetic algorithm]]s to develop images iteratively, selecting at each "generation" according to a rule defined by the artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Eberle |first1=Robert |title=Evolutionary Art - Genetic Algorithm |url=http://www.saatchiart.com/art/New-Media-Evolutionary-Art-Genetic-Algorithm/57335/1837679/view |publisher=Saatchi Art |accessdate=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Reynolds |first1=Craig |title=Evolutionary Computation and its application to art and design |url=http://www.red3d.com/cwr/evolve.html |publisher=Reynolds engineering &amp; Design |accessdate=25 December 2015 |date=27 June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Algorithmic art is not only produced by computers. Wendy Chun explains:&lt;ref name=Chun2011/&gt;

{{quote|Software is unique in its status as metaphor for metaphor itself. As A universal imitator/machine, it encapsulates a logic of general substitutability ; a logic of ordering and creative, animating disordering.

[[File:Praia-Palácio Presidencial (1).jpg|thumb|right|350px|The Presidential Palace, one of the most renowned buildings in Cape Verde]]
The '''Architecture of Cape Verde''' has different architectural styles in the nation.  Unlike the African mainland, Cape Verde was uninhabited until 1461 when the Portuguese arrived, most of the other islands were first inhabited after the end of the 15th century.  Its architecture was introduced in the 1460s and has its first origins from Portuguese settlers from the Madeira Islands, after the first arrival of mainland Africans, a bit of African architecture would be elements mainly in rural areas. The Manueline was its first architectural style on the island, it was later followed by Renaissance, Baroque, Pombaline (late-Baroque and Neoclassical), Early Modern and Modern.  It was one of the last in the whole of Africa to introduce architecture late.  Cape Verde has one of the richest architecture in the western portion of West Africa, the sub-Saharan portion, the richest probably being Mali.

After independence, modern architecture along with African continued to be influenced in newer buildings and is now the dominant influence on its buildings in the nation today, in its newer resorts particularly in Sal features a mixture of Spanish, African, probably Mexican and Moorish elements of architecture including the Garupa and the Funana hotels, both owned by RIU.  Also [[Aristides Pereira International Airport]] has a mixture of African, Capeverdean and Arabic-Moorish architecture.

The nation also has several buildings and homes with a resemblance of Portuguese and mainland African architectural origins.

==Architectural styles==
Its main architectural styles includes [[funco (architecture)|funco]], dominant on the islands of Fogo, Santiago and Maio, [[loja (architecture)|loja]], used for bars and [[sobrado (architecture)|sobrado]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barbosa.acthus.com/historiasobrados.html|title=Acthus.com|website=Barbosa.acthus.com|accessdate=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a house style particularly founded in the city of São Filipe in Fogo.  In the Colonial times, the funco style were mainly used for blacks, the loja style were once used for the mixed people and the sobrado style were for the white people used before independence.

==Colonial architecture==
{{Commonscat|Portuguese colonial architecture in Cape Verde}}[[File:Cidade Velha-Igreja Nossa Senhora do Rosário (1).jpg|thumb|right|300px|Nossa Senhora do Rosário (Our Lady of Rosary) church, the first colonial church in the world and the sub-Saharan portion of West Africa]]The first 500 years would have mainly Portuguese elements in its architecture and continued until the independence of Cape Verde in 1975.

===Manueline architecture===
When the city of Ribeira Grande (now [[Cidade Velha]]) was enlarged in its early years in the 1450s, in the 1490s and the start of the 15th century, [[Manueline style|Manueline architecture]]  would be featured in its buildings.  Some of its styles survived in some buildings in [[São Filipe, Cape Verde|São Filipe]].  The town's pillory (not a building) is one example, the other was [[Nossa Senhora do Rosário church (Cidade Velha)|Nossa Senhora do Rosário church]], the world's first colonial church and the Sé Cathedral.  After the [[Cassard expedition]] of 1712, all of its buildings were destroyed.  Its ruins remain on a few. By the 20th century, there were rebuilt in different locations and these buildings are part of UNESCO's [[World Heritage Site]] since 2009.

===Renaissance and Mannerist architecture===
[[File:ForteSFilipeQuarteis.JPG|thumb|left|300px|Ruins of the São Filipe fort]]Most of Cidade Velha's 500 buildings until the destruction of the French featured Renaissance and Mannerist architecture, it included the churches of São Roque, São Pedro, Monte Alverne, Nossa Senhora da Conceição,  the chapel of Santa Luzia, and the church and hospital of Santa Casa de Misericórdia.

[[Fort Real de São Filipe]] built on Achada de São Filipe sobre Ribeira Grande, a fort built in 1585 to protect from further attacks from corsairs after the damages during the [[Capture of Santiago (1585)|raid by Sir Francis Drake]], it was restored in 1968 and in 1999.  Minimal architectural changes occurred with the [[Philippine Dynasty|Habsburg Philippine Dynasty]] in the Portuguese Empire which included Cape Verde for sixty years.

===Restoration and Early Baroque architecture===
Fortim Carlota in São Filipe, Fogo are one of the buildings, a fortress featuring Restoration era architecture.  The Convent of Saint Francis (São Francisco) in Cidade Velha was built in the mid-16th century, it was destroyed by the French in 1712 during a raid and has been restored.

===Pombaline architecture===
====Late Baroque architecture====
[[Ribeira Grande, Cape Verde|Ribeira Grande]] has examples of late 18th century architecture in the center of the city.

As the colonial capital of Praia was moved in 1770, some architectural buildings were added including the warehouses and the port office, late Baroque Pombaline architecture appeared in Praia, almost all of these would be demolished by around the late 19th century and were replaced by neoclassical buildings.  Only the warehouse survives today which is in Praia da Gamboa.

Other examples is São Filipe's Our Lady of Conception church ( ''Nossa Senhora da Conceição'') which was built in a comparatively simple style at the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=lipps&gt;Susanne Lipps: ''Kapverdische Inseln'', p. 253-254. Ostfildern 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Opposite the church there are several well-preserved colonial houses dating from the 18th century.  Another one was the Pedra de Lume saltworks built in the early 20th century and its residential complexes.

====Neoclassical architecture====
[[File:Palacio Governador (S Vicente, Cabo Verde).JPG|thumb|300px|Palácio do Povo, Mindelo which serves as the center of the administration of the island, it features an Indian building style, its walls and fences are colored in pink]][[File:São Filipe-Musée municipal (4).jpg|thumb|left|300px|Museu Municipal de São Filipe, located in what was a sobrado style house]]
Neoclassical architecture dominated the building styles from 1822 up to the start of the 20th century, its most prominent were in Praia, the [[Platô]] and Mindelo.  Praia underwent large modernization by the colonial governor [[João da Mata Chapuzet]], one of the buildings he designed was [[Quartel Jaime Mota]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asemana.publ.cv/spip.php?article63659&amp;ak=1|title=Como estragar uma bela Praça|newspaper=A Semana|language=pt|date=30 April 2011|accessdate=7 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the buildings features roofs detached from its walls, common in Portugal and the Portuguese Empire at the time.
As [[Mindelo]] flourished in the mid to late 19th centuries with its coal refueling and telegraph services, numerous Pombaline and neoclassical architecture appeared across Mindelo. notable examples include [[Centro Nacional de Artesanato]] (founded as Centro de Artesanato), [[Palácio do Povo]] which features Indian style architecture with its walls and fences in pink, today which serves as the center of the island's administration and offices, others are [[Fortim d'El-Rei]] built in 1852 and used as a defense of Porto Grande and the city, the Mindelo Cultural Center, Mindelo Library, the old barracks, a replica of Lisbon's Torre de Belém, [[Paço do Concelho]], Liceu Gil Eanes, the former British consulate, the French Cultural Center, bandstands or kiosks of Praças Estreia and Amilcar Cabral and the Mindelo Cathedral of Our Lady of Grace.
[[File:Museu da tabanca, Assomada, Cape verde.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Museu da Tabanka, Assomada]][[File:Ponta do Sol 2.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Center of Ponta do Sol with its decorated street along with buildings with colonial architecture, one of them has modern architecture today]]
Other notable examples include those in Praia, the [[Praia, Cape Verde (municipality)|Praia City Hall]] and the buildings around [[Praça Alexandre Albuquerque|Albuquerque square]] (also the 12 de Setembro Square) including the kiosk, Escola Grande and its buildings around Loreno Square, [[Museu Etnográfico da Praia]], [[Pro-Cathedral of Our Lady of Grace, Praia|Praia Cathedral]], the former [[Banco Nacional Ultramarino]] (BNU) Praia branch which is now the headquarters of [[Banco Comercial do Atlântico]], Hospital Agostinho Neto (first as Praia Hospital), Praia Maria and Boutique hotels, Palácio Cultural Ildo Lobo, the building where [[Quintal da Música]] is located and most of all the [[Palácio Presidencial|Presidential Palace of Cape Verde]] with its luxuriant garden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite work|last=Lesourd|first=Michel|title=Le Cap-Vert|publisher=Jaguar|place=Paris|page=75|isbn=978-2-86950-408-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Fogo in São Filipe including one that is now Casa de Memória, the town kiosk which is also used as a bandstand and the [[Museu Municipal de São Filipe]] featuring a traditional hut&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barbosa.acthus.com/historiasobrados.html|title=Ilha do Fogo - Históroa dos sobrados|trans-title=Fogo Island - History of Sobrados|website=Barbosa.acthus.com|accessdate=2017-09-09|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the municipal halls of Paul and Ribeira Grande.
[[File:Espargos- Sal.JPG|thumb|right|300px|The city center of Espargos founded as Preguiça, its first buildings features early modern architecture as the town was founded in the late 1940s]]

Other cities featuring late Pombaline and neoclassical architecture across Cape Verde are in the centers of Paul (Pombas), [[Ponta do Sol, Cape Verde|Ponta do Sol]], [[Porto Novo, Cape Verde|Porto Novo]], built when it was called Carvoeiros, [[Ribeira Brava, Cape Verde|Ribeira Brava]], [[Tarrafal de São Nicolau]], a few in [[Santa Maria, Cape Verde|Santa Maria]], [[Sal Rei]], [[Cidade do Maio]], [[Pedra Badejo]], [[Assomada]], [[Calheta de São Miguel]], [[Tarrafal, Cape Verde|Tarrafal]], [[Cova Figueira]], [[Mosteiros, Cape Verde|Mosteiros]], [[Furna, Cape Verde|Furna]], [[Fajã de Agua]] and [[Nova Sintra]] and villages including [[Rabil, Cape Verde|Rabil]] and [[Povoação Velha]], both on Boa Vista.

Other churches built that time included [[Nossa Senhora da Conceição church (Boa Vista)|Nossa Senhora da Conceição church]] located near Povoação Velha.

In the late 19th century, numerous lighthouses were built across Cape Verde and feature colonial architecture; notable ones includes [[Farol de D. Maria Pia|Farol de Ponta Temerosa]] in Praia, [[Farol de Fontes Pereira de Melo|Farol de Ponta Tumbo]] near Janela and Porto Novo, [[Farol de D. Amélia|Farol de São Pedro]] southwest of Mindelo which has a rectangular building, Sal's [[Farol da Ponta Norte]] and [[Farol da Ponta do Sinó]].  [[Farol de Pedra de Lume]], built in 1853 is a lighthouse that is also a chapel that has a white exterior, made out of tile and black and white horizontal bands painted on the roof and the edges, around it serves as a diurnal marking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imieiviaggi.info/capoverde/cv11.jpg|title=Image with a primitive tower and the diurnal marking|website=Imieiviaggi.info|accessdate=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later neoclassical architecture in other parts of Praia are seen in Fazenda and [[Gamboa, Praia|Gamboa]] including the [[Electra (company)|Electra]] offices.

Today, some or most of the buildings in the Platô neighborhood have been demolished and replaced with newer buildings including [[Banco de Cabo Verde]]'s headquarters and the colorful buildings in the middle of [[Avenida Andrade Corvo]].

Building projects slowed at the early 20th century which was led by drought and rain shortages across Cape Verde at the time.

===Late colonial and early modern architecture===
Early modern architecture started to appear in newer buildings in the 1930s such as art nouveau.  During the time, [[Raul Pires Ferreira Chaves]] was director of public works for Cape Verde and Guinea-Bissau, he also lived in Cape Verde for some years, he did architectural works including the terminal and facilities of the Sal International Airport (now known as [[Amílcar Cabral International Airport]]), [[Farol de Fiúra]] in the north point (Ponta Norte) of Sal, an urban plan for the square now known as 5 do Outubro in Praia.

There were hardly any building projects in Cape Verde during the Great Depression and the Famine of the 1940s and remained up until the 1950s.

A town founded for airport services, the center of Espargos once known as Preguiça features late colonial and early modern architecture, one of its buildings is the Sal Municipal Hall.

Several Mormon and Protestant churches built before independence have modern architecture.

Other buildings built during that time included Estádio da Fontinha (now [[Estádio Municipal Adérito Sena]]) in Mindelo and Liceu Domingos Ramos in the north of the plateau.  Seminaro de São José, located near Ponta Temerosa, Praia was also built during that time.

==Modern architecture==
After independence, as the population grew, a lot of buildings featuring modern architecture (or modernism) spread up and many buildings today have a flat roof as other modern buildings on the African mainland.  Many houses and some buildings have little, poor or no architecture today.  One of these were a building that is now part of the [[University of Cape Verde]], its main campus in [[Palmarejo]] and other buildings in the new section of Palmarejo.
[[File:Hotel Riu 1 (Sal, Cabo Verde).JPG|thumb|right|300px|Funaná Hotel, an example of modern architecture which features African, Spanish, probably Mexican and Moorish elements]]
Other areas with buildings that contain only modern architecture includes the towers of [[Gamboa, Praia|Gamboa/Chã das Areias]] in the center of Praia and nearby.  Another is an information pavilion near [[Barragem de Poilão]] in the middle of the island of Santiago.  Escola Jorge Barbosa and Hotel Porto Grande, both are in Mindelo also features modern architecture.  Constructed in the late 1990s, one of the most notable is the [[National Library of Cape Verde|National Library]] located in Várzea in the center of Praia.  The other is the headquarters of the [[Bank of Cape Verde]] in the Plateau, being one of the first glass buildings.

After the end of the 20th century, modern architecture are featured in several sports stadiums including the [[Estádio Marcelo Leitão]] in Espargos built in 2003, [[Estádio Municipal Arsénio Ramos]] in Sal Rei built in 2008 and [[Estádio Municipal do Porto Novo]] in 2009.  Also in some resorts and vilas, Afro-Moorish architecture appears in Santa Maria (Funana, Garupa) and near Sal Rei (Karamboa, also features Arabesque architecture) along with a mixture of modern Afro-Northern Mediterranean architecture in places like Ribeira do Rabil southeast of Sal Rei and Murdeira, Sal.  One of the recent international airports constructed was the [[Aristides Pereira International Airport]], the airport of Boa Vista Island located in Rabil.  Its style is a mixture of Portuguese origin and Moorish architectural elements and has peach-rose stone bricks with two arches, entrance and exit doors and a yellow exterior where the airport name is and in the south are three melon colored exteriors with two fudge-brown exteriors in between and are bordered with a stone-brick outer wall.

===In parts of the island of Fogo===
[[File:Chã das Caldeiras-Maison traditionnelle (1).jpg|thumb|left|300px|One notable example was a hut (known as [[funco]]) in Chã das Caldeiras featuring traditional architecture, its bricks were made out of lava]]One of the unique architecture on Fogo was [[Chã das Caldeiras]] which has building material made out of lava, most of the buildings were built after independence especially the southwest part which were rebuilt after the 1995 eruption.  Its architecture is not only of Portuguese origin but contain elements of mainland African styles such as old traditional huts and a circular plan as those in mainland African villages and towns and had only one story.  It had straw roofs, bricks mainly black made out of lava, straw windowpanes and doors  In other parts of Cape Verde, only a very few village have hut style buildings.  Huts covered a quarter of the village.  One of the most notable were a house with blue exterior walls with white facades, brown windowpane and door and on the bottom triangular bricks, painted houses did not dominate the majority of the village, another was a hut that housed the vineyard offices, The other was the Catholic church of Portela which had a circular roof, two rims and green doors.  Some of the houses were rectangular with windows and some narrow doors and detached roofs, some buildings also had a flat roof.  One other examples were the village's primary school which had stucco walls, white roofs and mostly white doors and some brown, nearby had a playground with its benches built out of lava, the other was Vinho do Fogo, where wine is manufactured, a small bungalow was in the middle with two small flat windows on each side, black-grey bricks made out of lava, wide doors  and on the right is a part of the building, the others are outside but sheltered and a near rectangular café with sky blue exterior walls, windows and three narrow doors.

Almost the whole of the village were destroyed by lava flows of the 2014-15 eruption between November and February, several survive with minimal or moderate damages, a few were unharmed.

In early 2016, newer buildings and huts were built and out of lava and some new inhabitants moved in.

The rare architectural style's project was awarded the National Architecture Award in 2013, as Best Project of the Year and was awarded the Archdaily Building of the Year International Award in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fernandoguerra.exposure.co/cabo-verde|title=Fernando Guerra - Cabo Verde on Exposure|website=Fernandoguerra.exposure.co|accessdate=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elsewhere on Fogo, some of the buildings built out of lava have good architecture and some of these are in the east of São Filipe.

==In the media==
[[File:Aeroporto-Internacional-Aristides-Pereira-Terminal-2012.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Terminal building of Aristides Pereira International Airport in Rabil, Boa Vista.  The building style is a mixture of Portuguese and Moorish and has stone bricks]]A documentary film titled ''Architecture of Cidade Velha'' (''Arquitectura de Cidade Velha'') was released in 2007 and was directed by Catarina Alves Costa.  The film was about all the historic buildings in Cidade Velha including the Nossa Senhora do Rosário church, the pillory and its fort.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4797">The '''Bibliography of Aeolian Research''' (BAR) is a comprehensive bibliography focused on the study of the detachment, transport, and deposition of sediments by wind.&lt;ref name=BAR&gt;{{Citation | last =Warren | first = A. | last2 = Gill | first2 = T.E. | last3 = Stout | first3 = J.E. | title = Bibliography of Aeolian Research |publisher = USDA-Agricultural Research Service, Lubbock, Texas | url = https://www.lbk.ars.usda.gov/wewc/biblio/bar.htm | accessdate = 2014-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aeolian research is a sub-discipline of the physical sciences that focuses on the activity of the winds, with an emphasis on the winds' ability to interact with and shape the surface of the Earth and other planets.&lt;ref name=Stout&gt;{{Citation| last = Stout| first = J.E.| last2 = Warren| first2 = A.| last3 = Gill| first3 = T.E.| title =Publication trends in aeolian research: an analysis of the Bibliography of Aeolian Research| journal =Geomorphology| volume =105| issue =1-2| pages =6–17| year =2009| doi =10.1016/j.geomorph.2008.02.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Aeolian research spans a broad array of disciplines and may include the study of [[aeolian processes]] and associated [[aeolian landform]]s, aeolian deposits, and sedimentary features; the study of [[wind erosion]] and its control by [[tillage]], [[cover crop]]s, [[Windbreak|shelterbelts]], and other management practices; and the study of [[mineral dust]], [[dust storm]]s and the effects of [[Particulates|fine particulate matter]] on [[climate]] and [[air quality]].

An extensive Bibliography of Aeolian Research (BAR) was constructed that contains references to every known scientific manuscript published in the field of aeolian research from 1646 to 2015.&lt;ref name=BAR/&gt; The BAR contains over 43,000 bibliographic citations.

As with most bibliographies, the Bibliography of Aeolian Research has benefited from past bibliographies.  The BAR lists more than forty-five bibliographies that focus on at least one aspect of aeolian research and parts of these have been incorporated into the BAR.  Older bibliographies are especially important because they provide a record of early publications.  The oldest bibliography incorporated into the BAR is the ''Bibliography of Meteorology'' compiled by [[Oliver Lanard Fassig|Oliver Fassig]] in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Fassig | first =O.L. | title =Bibliography of Meteorology | publisher =United States of America War Department, Signal Office, Washington DC | year = 1889 | pages =475}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Citations have also been extracted from the Bibliography of Eolian Geology prepared for the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] by Conrad Stuntz and Edward Free.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Stuntz | first =S.C. | last2 =Free | first2 =E.E. | title =Bibliography of Eolian Geology.

(eds), Arid Lands in Perspective | publisher = American Association for the Advancement of Science, Washington D.C. and Tucson: University of Arizona Press | year = 1969 | pages =75–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Bibliography of Aeolian Research contains more citations extracted from these two bibliographies than from any other source.  Citations were also obtained from a monthly internet posting called ''Aeolian Papers of the Month'', a list of published papers compiled each month from 1996-2001 by Thomas Gill at the [[Texas Tech University]].

Editors Andrew Warren, John Stout and Thomas Gill collected bibliographic citations by searching databases and extracting citations from recent publications.&lt;ref name=BAR/&gt; New entries included citations to scholarly articles, books, theses, dissertations, and reports.

'''Charles Bargue''' (c. 1826/1827 – April 6, 1883) was a [[France|French]] painter and lithographer noted for devising an influential drawing course.

==Life and career==
[[Image:Bargue The Chess Game.jpg|thumb|''The Chess Game'', by Charles Bargue]]
He is mostly remembered for his ''Cours de dessin'', one of the most influential classical drawing courses conceived in collaboration with [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]]. The course, published between 1866 and 1871 by [[Goupil &amp; Cie]], comprised 197 [[lithograph]]s printed as individual sheets, was to guide students from plaster casts to the study of great master drawings and finally to drawing from the living model. The Charles Bargue Drawing Course is used by many academies and ateliers which focus of [[classical realism]]. Among the artists whose work is based on the study of Bargue's plate work are Pablo Picasso&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Glueck|first1=Grace|title=In the Days When Artists Were Taught How to Draw|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/26/books/art-review-in-the-days-when-artists-were-taught-how-to-draw.html|website=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vincent van Gogh]], who copied the complete set in 1880/1881, and (at least a part of it) again in 1890.

Bargue was a student of Jean-Léon Gérôme.  Bargue worked closely with Gérôme and was influenced by his style, which included Orientalist scenes and historical genre.  Bargue's last painting was completed by Gérôme and is now conserved in the Malden Public Library, [[Malden, Massachusetts]], USA. He travelled extensively through North Africa, and the Balkans, during which time he executed many portraits of local people with meticulous detail.

'''Cornelis van der Geest''' (1575 – 10 March 1638) was a [[spice]] merchant from Antwerp, who used his wealth to support the Antwerp artists and to establish his art collection. He was also the dean of the [[haberdasher]]s [[guild]].&lt;ref name=Rosa/&gt;

==Art collection==
He is best known today for his art collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kamers vol kunst in 17de eeuws Antwerpen|url=http://www.rubenshuis.be/Museum_Rubenshuis_NL/RubenshuisNL/RubenshuisNL-Activiteiten/Activiteiten-Evenementen-NL/Evenementen-NL-Activiteiten/Activiteiten-Expo/Kamers-vol-kunst-in-17de-eeuws-Antwerpen.html?highlight=van%2c%20der%2c%20geest|publisher=Rubenshuis|accessdate=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was portrayed repeatedly by [[Anthony van Dyck]], while [[Willem van Haecht]], who he had hired as curator, painted his "[[Cabinet of Curiosities|constcammer]]" several times, including a view of the visit of [[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria]] and [[Isabella Clara Eugenia]] to his art collection.

He owned two paintings by [[Quentin Matsys]], one of which, a ''Madonna'', can be seen in the Van Haecht painting. Other works included in that view are ''Women at her toilet'' by [[Jan van Eyck]], a still life by [[Frans Snyders]], ''Ceres Mocked'' by [[Adam Elsheimer]], ''[[Danaë]]'' by Van Haecht, ''Battle of the Amazons'' and a portrait by [[Peter Paul Rubens]], ''Peasant Company with Woman making Pancakes'' by [[Pieter Aertsen]], ''Apelles'' by [[Wierix family|Jan Wierix]] and a hunting scene by [[Jan Wildens]]. The painting also shows some of Van der Geest's sculptures, with copies of the ''[[Venus de' Medici]]'', the ''[[Farnese Hercules]]'', and the ''[[Apollo Belvedere]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sutherland Harris|first=Ann|title=Seventeenth-century art &amp; architecture|year=2005|publisher=Laurence King Publishing|isbn=978-1-85669-415-5|pages=426|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xd0CuzsPYJcC&amp;pg=PA191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maecenas==
[[File:Anberesko katedrala (cropped - Skull plaque for Quentin Metsys).JPG|thumb|1620 skull plaque financed by Van der Geest for Quentin Metsys]]
Van der Geest also functioned as a [[maecenas]]. He arranged for Rubens to get the order for a triptych for the [[Saint Walpurga]] church in Antwerp, which resulted in the ''[[The Elevation of the Cross (Rubens)|Elevation of the Cross]]'', now in the [[Cathedral of Our Lady (Antwerp)|Cathedral of Antwerp]].&lt;ref name=Timmermans&gt;{{cite book|last=Timmermans|first=Bert|title=Patronen van patronage in het zeventiende-eeuwse Antwerpen|year=2008|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|isbn=978-90-5260-247-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vg3ZzhtUbwAC&amp;pg=PA240|accessdate=23 July 2016|page=250|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the order for the 1630-1632 ''Triptych of Saint Ildephonsus'', intended for the Saint James church, but now in the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in Vienna, was given to Rubens through the influence of Van der Geest.&lt;ref name=Rosa&gt;{{cite book|last=Giorgi|first=Rosa|title=European art of the seventeenth century|year=2008|publisher=Getty Publications|isbn=978-0-89236-934-8|pages=383|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6ifEIpw-B9kC&amp;pg=PA169}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Van der Geest also financed a new memorial for [[Quentin Metsys]] against the tower of the Antwerp Cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.nl/books?id=jSkUAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA67&amp;lpg=PA67 Geschiedenis der Antwerpsche rederykkamers]'', chapter 1, ''Geschiedenis der violieren'', by J.

'''Creative computing''' covers the interdisciplinary area at the cross-over of the [[creative arts]] and [[computing]]. Issues of [[creativity]] include [[knowledge discovery]], for example.&lt;ref name="yang15"&gt;{{cite book| doi=10.1007/978-3-319-23766-4_7 | chapter=Knowledge Discovery in Creative Computing for Creative Tasks | first1=Lu | last1=Zhang | first2=Hongji | last2=Yang | authorlink2=Hongji Yang | title=Creativity in Intelligent, Technologies and Data Science | volume=535 | publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | series=Communications in Computer and Information Science | pages=93–104 | year=2015 | isbn=978-3-319-23765-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Overview==
The ''International Journal of Creative Computing'' describes creative computing as follows:&lt;ref name="IJCrC"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.inderscience.com/ijcrc | title=International Journal of Creative Computing | publisher=[[Inderscience Publishers]] | accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Creative computing refers to a meta-technology to coalesce knowledge in computing and other disciplines.  People use computers as aids to  creativity and creative-computing topics may reshape the world as we know it. Applications are seen in [[arts]], [[entertainment]]/[[games]], [[mobile applications]], [[multimedia]], product/[[web design]] and other [[interactive system]]s.&lt;!-- ICRC aims to shape a significant body of creative computing research. --&gt;}}

Creative computing is [[interdisciplinary]] in nature and topics relating to it include [[Application software|applications]], [[Software development|development method]], [[evaluation]], [[Conceptual model|modeling]], [[philosophy]], [[principle]]s, [[Operating environment|support environment]], and [[theory]].&lt;ref name="IJCrC" /&gt;

The term "creative computing" is used both in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]] (e.g., at [[Harvard University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://scratched.gse.harvard.edu/guide/ | title=Creative Computing – An Introductory Computing Curriculum using Scratch | publisher=[[Harvard University]] | accessdate=24 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[MIT]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://cs4hs.media.mit.edu/ | title=Creative Computing | publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] | work=[[MIT Media Lab]] | accessdate=24 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

'''''De re aedificatoria''''' ('''''On the Art of Building''''') is a classic architectural treatise written by [[Leon Battista Alberti]] between 1443 and 1452.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Grayson, in ''Kunstkronik'' '''213''' (1960:359ff, and ''Münchener Jahrbuch der Bildenden Kunst'' '''11''' (1960), demonstrated that the bulk of the composition was carried out between these dates.&lt;/ref&gt; Although largely dependent on [[Vitruvius]]'s ''[[De architectura]]'', it was the first theoretical book on the subject written in the [[Italian Renaissance]], and in 1485 it became the first printed book on architecture.  It was followed in 1486 with the first printed edition of Vitruvius.

Alberti's ''Ten Books'' consciously echoes Vitruvius's writing, but Alberti also adopts a critical attitude toward his predecessor. In his discussion, Alberti includes a wide variety of literary sources, including [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], presenting a concise version of the [[sociology]] of [[architecture]]. ''De re aedificatoria'' is subdivided into ten books and includes:

* Book One: ''Lineaments''
* Book Two: ''Materials''
* Book Three: ''Construction''
* Book Four: ''Public Works''
* Book Five: ''Works of Individuals''
* Book Six: ''Ornament''
* Book Seven: ''Ornament to Sacred Buildings''
* Book Eight: ''Ornament to Public Secular Buildings''
* Book Nine: ''Ornament to Private Buildings''
* Book Ten: ''Restoration of Buildings''

In his survey of desirable floor plans for sacred buildings— "temples" in his phrase—Alberti begins with the ideal form of the circle, which is expressed in numerous examples of Nature. Nine ideal centrally-planned geometrical shapes are recommended for churches; besides the circle he lists the square, the hexagon, octagon, decagon and dodecagon, all derived from the circle, and, derived from the square, rectangles that exhibit the square and a half, square and a third and double square, all of which have enharmonic parallels in music. Chapels add  small geometric figures to the basic circles and polygons to give a great variety of floor plans, in which each geometrical figure retains its clear unity and simple ratios that bind all elements of the plans and elevations into a harmonic unity.

''De re aedificatoria'' remained the classic treatise on architecture from the 16th until the 18th century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4914">The '''Death of the Virgin Mary of Košátky''' is a [[Bohemia]]n panel painting from the period around 1340-1350.
[[File:Dormition of the Virgin from Košátky.JPG|thumb|400 px|Dormition of the Virgin from Košátky]]

== History of the painting ==
The picture was discovered in 1922 in the Chapel of the Black Madonna at [[Košátky]] Castle near [[Mladá Boleslav]] and loaned to the Gallery of the Society of Patriotic Friends of Art. It originally belonged to the Krabice of Veitmile family that purchased [[Košátky]] fortress in 1420, and its actual owner was in all likelihood Beneš Krabice of Veitmile (Benesch von Weitmühl), the chronicler and director of the construction of [[St Vitus Cathedral]]. From this family, the picture came into the Kolowrat family through marriage. The Kolowrats owned it until 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Matějček A, 1950, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; The picture is now in the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/dormition-of-the-virgin-33412 Dormition of the Virgin, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description and context ==
The picture is painted in tempera on an oak panel covered with stretched canvas. A preparatory drawing is etched into the chalk base and its contours outlined in black.

The work is a highly advanced example of the Gothic style, combining elements of Northern European Gothic and the strong influence of Italian, more specifically [[Sienese School|Sienese painting]]. It was painted by an unknown master during the reign of [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] and belongs to the broader circle of paintings executed in a similar way, such as the [[Master of Vyšší Brod|Vyšší Brod Altarpiece]], the [[Kaufmann Crucifixion]] and the panels of the [[Morgan Library &amp; Museum|Morgan Collection]] (the ''Small Morgan Panels''). The panel was probably originally the wing of a diptych, the second part of which was the [[Holy Trinity of Wrocław|Wrocław Holy Trinity]].&lt;ref&gt;Pešina J, 1976, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

In the quality of its execution, the picture ranks among the finest known works dating from the 14th century. It is at the same time the most Italian work of the entire [[Bohemia]]n school.&lt;ref&gt;Kutal J, 1972, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of space reveals that the artist was acquainted with the central [[Sienese School|Italian painting of Siena]] (namely that of [[Simone Martini]]). Its composition is monumental and complex, while the facial type is derived from the Venetian school (namely Paolo di Venezia). A peculiar aspect of the work is the figure of [[Jesus|Christ]] (holding the soul of Mary), who doesn’t ascend in a [[Aureola|mandorla]] above the group but stands among the [[Apostle (Christian)|apostles]]. The mandorla is substituted by small stylised clouds around the figure.

The theme of depicting the [[Death of the Virgin|death of the Virgin Mary]] itself is Byzantine in origin. In [[Bohemia]], the oldest depiction of this kind (the Koímēsis) is a miniature on [[parchment]] inserted into the relic panels of a St George reliquary dating from 1306. Later works then gradually abandon the Byzantine scheme, replacing it with the motif of ''Last Prayer of the Virgin Mary''. This was first recorded in the Czech lands from the 1360s.&lt;ref&gt;Pazderová J, 2014, pp. 9-10&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dīvān-e Kabīr''''' or '''''Dīvān-e Šams-e Tabrīzī''''' ''(The Works of [[Shams Tabrizi|Šams Tabrīzī]])'' ({{Lang-fa|دیوان شمس تبریزی}}) or '''''Dīvān-e Šams''''' is one of [[Mawlānā Jalāl-ad-Dīn Muhammad Balkhī]]'s masterpieces. A collection of lyric poems that contains more than 40,000 verses, it is written in the [[New Persian]] language and is considered one of the greatest works of [[Persian literature]]. 

''Dīvān-e Kabīr'' ("the great divan") contains poems in several different styles of Eastern-Islamic poetry (e.g. odes, eulogies, quatrains, etc.). It contains 44,282 lines (according to Foruzanfar's edition,&lt;ref&gt;Furuzanfar, Badi-uz-zaman. ''Kulliyat-e Shams'', 8 vols., Tehran: Amir Kabir Press, 1957–66. Critical edition of the collected odes, qutrains and other poems of Rumi with glossary and notes.&lt;/ref&gt; which is based on the oldest manuscripts available): 3,229 odes, or ghazals (total lines = 34,662); 44 tarji-bands (total lines = 1698); and 1,983 quatrains (total lines = 7932).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dar-al-masnavi.org/about_divan.html|title=About the Divan|work=dar-al-masnavi.org|accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most of the poems are in [[New Persian]], there are also some in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], and a small number of mixed Persian/Greek and Persian/Turkish poems. ''Dīvān-e Šams-e Tabrīzī'' is named in honour of Rumi's spiritual teacher and friend [[Shams Tabrizi]].

The following are Greek verses in the poetry of [[Rumi|Mawlana Jalal ad-Din Rumi]] (1207-1273), and his son, [[Sultan Walad]] (1226-1312). The works have been difficult to edit, because of the absence of vowel pointing in most of the verses, and the confusion of scribes unfamiliar with Greek; different editions of the verses vary greatly&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.opoudjis.net/Play/rumiwalad.html|title=Untitled Document|website=www.opoudjis.net|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4108">The '''Embroidery Software Protection Coalition''' (ESPC) was a United States embroidery industry [[industry trade group|trade group]].  Its primary activity was the investigation and prosecution of alleged acts of [[copyright infringement]].  The group drew media attention for its campaign of settlement demands against individual buyers as well as sellers of embroidery patterns and software.  It drew further attention with a 2006 [[slander and libel|defamation]] suit against two individual Internet critics, in which it attempted to subpoena the identities of every subscriber of the critics' [[electronic mailing list]].

==eBay buyer infringement claims==
[[Image:ESPC Letterhead-1-.jpg|thumb|160px|right|This ESPC letter accuses an eBay buyer of copyright infringement.]]
&lt;!-- FAIR USE of ESPC Letterhead-1-.jpg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:ESPC Letterhead-1-.jpg for rationale --&gt;

On August 3, 2005, the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas]] approved the dismissal of a lawsuit brought by the ESPC and ESPC member companies against [[eBay]] and [[PayPal]], pursuant to a stipulation agreement between the parties.

On September 7, 2005, [[WNDU-TV]] reported that the ESPC was mailing settlement demands to individual eBay buyers.&lt;ref name="wndu_wayback"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wndu.com/ |title=WNDU-TV: South Bend, IN|publisher=Accessed on [[Internet Archive]]|date=09-07-2005 |archiveurl = http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20041016181331/http%3A//www%2Ewndu%2Ecom/ |archivedate = October 16, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to one such demand letter, dated October 17, 2005, the buyers were identified by personal records provided by eBay and eBay sellers.

The October 17 letter further claimed that buyers, by purchasing and possessing unlicensed copies of embroidery software or patterns, had violated United States copyright law.  "By purchasing the counterfeit goods, they're encouraging the pirates to stay out there and put the legitimate businesses out of business," said Carole Faulkner, attorney for the ESPC, in the September 7 WNDU-TV report.  A [[University of Notre Dame]] law professor disagreed, telling WNDU-TV "copyright laws make it illegal to distribute copies, not buy them".

==Defamation suit==

As of April 28, 2006, the ESPC claimed to represent seven United States embroidery publishers and distributors.&lt;ref name="espc_wayback"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.embroideryprotection.org/about_us.html|title=About the Embroidery Software Protection Coalition|date=2006-04-28|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060428085918/http://www.embroideryprotection.org/about_us.html|archivedate=2006-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The legitimacy of the ESPC was disputed by critics, who suggested that the ESPC was associated with only one publisher, Great Notions Embroidery Designs.{{Fact|date=November 2007}}

On June 28, 2006, the ESPC responded to two such critics, against whom the ESPC had previously filed copyright infringement lawsuits, by filing a new lawsuit.  In the new lawsuit, the ESPC alleged defamation, [[intentional infliction of emotional distress]], [[conspiracy (civil)|conspiracy]], business disparagement, and [[tortious interference]].

The ESPC subsequently petitioned for a subpoena seeking the identities of every subscriber to the two critics' Internet mailing list.  In September 2006, after the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] intervened on behalf of the anonymous targets of the subpoena, the subpoena was withdrawn.
&lt;ref name="eff_espc_v_ebert"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/legal/cases/ESPC_v_Ebert/|title=EFF: Embroidery Software Protection Coalition v. Ebert &amp; Weaver|publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]|date=2006-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The referenced critics, since February 2006 have entered an out of court settlement with ESPC. Prior out of court settlements show that the infringers hand over lists of buyers and individuals to whom the machine embroidery designs were sent.

'''''Fair Game: My Life as a Spy, My Betrayal by the White House''''' (New York: [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], 2007) is a [[memoir]] by [[Valerie Plame|Valerie Plame Wilson]]. Mrs. Wilson is the former [[Non-official cover|covert]] [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] officer whose then-classified [[non-official cover]] (NOC) identity as "[[Valerie Plame]]" was leaked to the press in July 2003, after her husband, former Ambassador [[Joseph C. Wilson|Joseph C. Wilson, IV]], had criticized the [[Presidency of the United States|George W. Bush administration]]'s rationale for the [[Iraq War]].  The outing made her the center of the [[List of federal political scandals in the United States|American political scandal]] known as the [[Plame affair]].  Her public outing led to her decision to resign from the CIA in December 2005, when she attempted to retire early at the age of 42. Being told that she could not collect her pension until the age of 56, she determined to write this book both as a means of telling her own story in her own words and as a means of earning income to replace her deferred retirement annuity.  She encountered resistance from the CIA in the course of chronicling her work with the organization.&lt;ref name=LiptakAug&gt;Adam Liptak, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/03/washington/03plame.html?_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;oref=login&amp;adxnnlx=1206245413-gmc8PySloz5lTGt0nKkH1Q "Judge Backs C.I.A. in Suit On Memoir"], ''[[The New York Times]]'' August 3, 2007, accessed March 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Solomon&gt;John Solomon, [https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2005-07-15-rove-testimony_x.htm "Rove Learned CIA Agent's Name from Novak"], ''[[USA Today]]'', July 15, 2005, accessed July 15, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Seidman&gt;Joel Seidman (Producer, [[NBC News]]), [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18924679/ "Plame Was 'covert' Agent at Time of Name Leak: Newly Released Unclassified Document Details CIA Employment"], ''[[MSNBC]]'', May 29, 2007, accessed August 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Goldstein&gt;Bonnie Goldstein, [http://www.slate.com/id/2168490/entry/0/ "Free Valerie Plame's Memoirs!"], ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', June 15, 2007, accessed October 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Janet Maslin]] writes in her ''New York Times'' review on the day of publication, "the story of how her career was derailed and her C.I.A. cover blown ... has its combative side.  But the real proof of Ms. Wilson’s fighting spirit is the form in which her version of events has been brought into the light of day."

{{Main article|Plame affair}}
The phrase "fair game" in the title of Mrs. Wilson's [[memoir]] refers to a comment that [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]]'s [[Deputy White House Chief of Staff]] for Strategic Planning and Senior Advisor [[Karl Rove]] reportedly told [[Chris Matthews]], the host of [[MSNBC]]'s television show ''[[Hardball with Chris Matthews]]'': "I just got off the phone with Karl Rove. He says, and I quote, '[[Joseph C. Wilson|Wilson]]'s wife is fair game.'"&lt;ref name=WilsonPolitics&gt;Russ Hoyle, "The [[Niger uranium forgeries|Niger Affair]]: The Investigation That Won't Go Away," "Foreword" (xiii-xlix) in Joseph C.

Cf. Joseph C. Wilson, "The Sixteen Words", chap. 1 in ''The Politics of Truth'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;"'WILSON'S WIFE IS FAIR GAME.'" Those are fighting words for any man, and I'd just had them quoted to me by MSNBC's [[Chris Matthews]].  It was July 21, 2003, barely a week since a column by [[Robert Novak]] in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' had named my wife, Valerie, as a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] officer, and now the host of ''[[Hardball with Chris Matthews|Hardball]]'' was calling to tell me that as far as the [[The White House|White House]] was concerned, they had declared open season on my family. ... In his signature staccato, Matthews was blunt: "I just got off the phone with [[Karl Rove]].  He says, and I quote, 'Wilson's wife is fair game.'"

"Fair Game" serves as a metaphor derived from more recent contexts of her life that the author relates in this book; given the nature of [[Non-official cover|covert espionage]], it may suggest multiple meanings.&lt;ref name=Waas&gt;[[Murray Waas]], [http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=plugging_leaks "Plugging Leaks:] More Details Emerge on the Plame Investigation, As Karl Rove's Testimony Is Revealed for the First Time", ''[[The American Prospect]]'', March 8, 2004, accessed August 23, 2007.

=====Karl Rove's disavowal of the phrase "fair game"=====
After the title of Valerie Plame Wilson's book had already been widely disseminated, on August 19, 2007, on ''[[Meet the Press]]'' with [[David Gregory (journalist)|David Gregory]], Gregory asked Rove, who identified himself as an "avid [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]",&lt;ref name=MTP1&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20302351/ "'Meet the Press' Transcript for Aug. 19, 2007"], ''[[MSNBC|MSNBC.com]]'', August 19, 2007, accessed August 21, 2007.  (Page 1 of 6 pages.)&lt;/ref&gt; among other statements pertaining to the [[CIA leak grand jury investigation]] attributed to him, whether he "considered her fair game in this debate" between her husband and [[The White House]] over the President's so-called "[[September Dossier|sixteen words]]".  Rove responded that the phrase "fair game" attributed to him by [[Chris Matthews]] was Matthews' phrase not his own and that he himself did not consider Mrs. Wilson (in Gregory's phrase) "an appropropriate target in this debate."&lt;ref name=MTP3&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20302351/page/3/ "'Meet the Press' Transcript for Aug. 19, 2007"], ''[[MSNBC|MSNBC.com]]'', August 19, 2007, accessed August 21, 2007:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
MR. GREGORY:  Do you think you owe Valerie Plame an apology?&lt;br&gt;
MR. ROVE:  No.&lt;br&gt;
MR. GREGORY:  You do not?&lt;br&gt;
MR. ROVE:  No.&lt;br&gt;
MR. GREGORY:  You considered her fair game in this debate?&lt;br&gt;
MR. ROVE:  No.  And you know what?  Fair game, that wasn’t my phrase.  That’s a phrase of a journalist.  In fact, a colleague of yours [Matthews].&lt;br&gt;
MR. GREGORY:  Was she an appropriate target in this debate?&lt;br&gt;
MR. ROVE:  No.&lt;br&gt;
MR. GREGORY:  She was not.&lt;br&gt;
MR. ROVE:  No.  (Page 3 of 6 pages.)&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Related contexts=====
In October 2003 Evan Thomas and [[Michael Isikoff]] reported in ''[[Newsweek]]'' that "The White House spokesman dismissed as 'ridiculous' the charge that Rove outed Plame."&lt;ref name=ThomasIsikoff3a&gt;Evan Thomas and [[Michael Isikoff]], [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3129941/site/newsweek/ "Secrets and Leaks:] Pssst ... You Might Think This Washington Leak Investigation Will Peter Out Like Most Others, with No Culprits and No Penalties. But Here's Why This One May Be Different", ''[[Newsweek]]'', October 6, 2003,  online version, October 13, 2003 ("Updated: 1:20 p.m. ET July 12, 2005"): 3 (of 4 pages), accessed August 22, 2007: &lt;blockquote&gt;A source familiar with Rove's conversation acknowledged that Rove spoke to Matthews a few days after [[Robert Novak|Novak's]] column appeared, but said that Rove never told Matthews that Wilson’s wife was "fair game"—rather, that it "was reasonable to discuss who sent Wilson to Niger." Novak wrote last week that the leaker was "no partisan gunslinger."  That suggests that the original leak came from someone in [[the White House]] [[national security|national-security]] apparatus, which holds itself above politics. Many White House staffers are potential suspects, but various press reports have suggested that the Feds will want to interview [[Lewis Libby|I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby]], [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Dick Cheney|Cheney's]] [[Chief of Staff to the Vice President of the United States|chief of staff]], an aggressive consumer of intelligence regarded by some CIA analysts as an intimidating figure.&lt;/ref&gt;  As Thomas and Isikoff note, "It may be significant that both Rove and Libby deny leaking classified information. They may say that in talking to reporters they used her name without knowing that she was undercover."&lt;ref name=ThomasIsikoff3/&gt;

[[Chris Matthews]] reportedly declined to discuss the telephone conversation that he had had with Rove, according to Thomas and Iskikoff in ''[[Newsweek]]'', who quote the conversation that Wilson reported having with Matthews and then add parenthetically: "(Matthews told ''Newsweek'': 'I’m not going to talk about off-the-record conversations.')"&lt;ref name=ThomasIsikoff3/&gt; [[David Corn]] of ''[[The Nation]]'' notes Matthews' statement to ''Newsweek'' "that he would not discuss off-the record conversations," adding, also parenthetically, that, earlier, "he [Matthews] told me the same...."&lt;ref name=ThomasIsikoff3/&gt;&lt;ref name=Waas/&gt;&lt;ref name=Corn&gt;As cited in [[David Corn]], [http://www.thenation.com/blogs/capitalgames?bid=3&amp;pid=991 "The Spin Is Not Holding"], ''Capital Games'' (blog),  ''[[The Nation]]'', October 4, 2003, accessed August 22, 2007:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The newsmagazine [Newsweek] also notes that, according to a source close to Wilson, shortly after the leak occurred Bush's senior aide Karl Rove told Hardball host Chris Matthews that Wilson's wife was "fair game." Matthews told Newsweek that he would not discuss off-the-record conversations. (He told me the same weeks ago when I made a similar inquiry about this chat with Rove.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Solomon" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Isikoff&gt;[[Cf.]] [[Michael Isikoff]], [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8445696/site/newsweek/ "The Rove Factor: Time Magazine Talked to Bush's Guru for Plame Story"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050706043356/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8445696/site/newsweek |date=2005-07-06 }}, ''[[Newsweek]]'', July 11, 2006, accessed August 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7102243 "Legal Affairs: Reporter Says Libby, Rove Told Him of Plame's Work"], ''[[All Things Considered]]'', ''[[National Public Radio]]'', January 31, 2007, accessed August 23, 2007; includes audio link (NPR Player).&lt;/ref&gt;

Matthews was one of over twenty-five journalists subpoenaed by [[U.S. Department of Justice Office of Special Counsel|Special Counsel]] [[Patrick Fitzgerald]] regarding their conversations with high-level [[Presidency of the United States|Bush administration]] officials pertaining to the [[CIA leak grand jury investigation]] (2003–2005), leading to the indictment and prosecution, conviction, and sentencing of [[Lewis Libby|Scooter Libby]] in ''[[United States v. Libby]]'' (2007).{{Further information|Valerie Plame#Judicial and legislative actions pertaining to "Plamegate"}}

Ultimately, whereas Fitzgerald's grand jury did not indict Rove for committing any alleged crimes, and, in October 2005, it did indict Libby not for allegedly having leaked Mrs. Wilson's identity but for allegedly having lied in his sworn testimony pertaining to the leak investigation, federal [[felony|felonies]] for which a jury convicted and a judge sentenced him, a sentence which was commuted by Presidential proclamation.  On July 19, 2007, a district court judge dismissed the Wilsons' [[civil lawsuit]] ([[Plame v. Cheney]]) which charged related offenses by the various government officials. The dismissal was on jurisdictional grounds, that the case belonged in federal court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/2007-07-19-plame-lawsuit_N.htm|title=Plame's lawsuit against Cheney dismissed - USATODAY.com|website=usatoday30.usatoday.com|access-date=2016-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://us.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/07/19/cia.leak/index.html|title=Judge tosses out ex-spy's lawsuit against Cheney in CIA leak case - CNN.com|website=us.cnn.com|access-date=2016-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/19/AR2007071901395.html?hpid=topnews|title=Plame's Suit Against  Top Officials Dismissed|last=Leonnig|first=Carol D.|date=2007-07-20|newspaper=The Washington Post|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|access-date=2016-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2006cv1258-52|title=Memorandum Opinion|last=in "Valerie Wilson, et al., Plaintiffs, v.

On April 6, 2006, Matthews stated his own point of view on the CIA leak publicly in some detail in his conversation with Senator [[John Kerry]] on ''[[Hardball with Chris Matthews]]'', describing as "high drama" [[Lewis Libby|Scooter Libby]]'s testimony that the [[President of the United States]] via the [[Vice President of the United States]] had "ordered" Libby to leak classified information pertaining to [[national security]] in order to bolster the case for the [[Iraq War]] after it began in March 2003.&lt;ref name="Matthews2006"&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12193430/ "Kerry: 'Immoral to allow our kids to be killed':] Sen. John Kerry talks to Chris Matthews about Iraq, CIA leak: ''Following the CIA leak disclosure, Chris Matthews sat down with Senator John Kerry in his Capitol office to discuss the big developments in the CIA leak case and vision for Iraq policy''", ''[[Hardball with Chris Matthews]]'', ''[[MSNBC]]'', April 6, 2006, accessed August 22, 2007 (Transcript):&lt;blockquote&gt;Let's talk about the timing of this and we all remember this.  It was July 6th that Joseph Wilson, the former ambassador who had been sent down there by the CIA to the government of [[Niger]] to check out the story which appeared mysteriously in an Italian newspaper, that there had been a deal by Saddam Hussein to purchase nuclear materials, [[yellowcake|uranium yellow cake]], from the government of Niger.
Within two days, the [[vice president of the United States]] said the [[president of the United States]] wanted [[Lewis Libby|Scooter Libby]] to leak to [[Judith Miller (journalist)|Judy Miller]], someone he had been working with on stories, had written stories that were supportive of the war, in effect, if not in intent, to tell her, this is a specific determination by the president.
You tell Scooter to go tell Judy that there was a real case for these aluminum tubes being material for use in developing a nuclear weapon.  You tell her this.  This is the conversation we're getting recounted under oath from Scooter Libby.  Pretty high drama here, isn't it?
I mean, it tells you that the president himself was in charge of this operation. He wasn't some, faded backroom guy getting orders from the vice president.  He was in fact, calling the shots particularly, and making the case for the war after the fact.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 7, 2007, the day after [[Lewis Libby]]'s sentencing, in a conversation with actor and political activist [[Ben Affleck]] about other matters, [[Chris Matthews]] used the phrase "fair game" several times, initially citing its use in a question submitted for Affleck by a viewer, whose own use of the phrase could reflect Matthews' already well-publicized reported use of it by Wilson, ''[[Newsweek]]'', and many other [[mass media|media]] sources.&lt;ref name=MatthewsJune2007&gt;[[Chris Matthews]], [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19110556/ "'Hardball with Chris Matthews' for June 7"], ''[[MSNBC]]'', updated June 8, 2007, 12:09 p.m. ET, accessed August 23, 2007: "Here's a question from [...].  'Are the personal or religious beliefs of candidates ''fair game'' for scrutiny when deciding for whom to vote?'  What do you make of that, Ben?  It's been happening in these debates, lots of questions about, you know, evolution, Genesis, the whole thing, creationism.  Are they ''fair game'', or is that a religious test?" (Italics added.) (Transcript; "Guests: [[Ben Affleck]], [[Loretta Sanchez]], [[Brian Bilbray]], [[Ezra Klein]], Karen Hanretty.")&lt;/ref&gt;  His later usage of the phrase "fair game" in talking with Affleck about other matters raises a possibility that the phrase "fair use" that he reportedly used in talking with Wilson about Rove's comments about "Wilson's wife" (as quoted in ''[[The Politics of Truth]]'' [2004, 2005] and as previously quoted in ''[[Newsweek]]'' [2003]) was his own phrase and not Rove's, as Rove later disavowed it.

Nevertheless, whether or not Rove originated it, the phrase still conveys metaphorically what Matthews and the Wilsons appear to think that Rove literally may have intended: to "target" (in Gregory's later terminology) Wilson and, collaterally, to leak the information about his wife's CIA identity in the process.  The [[CIA leak grand jury investigation]] did not result in charging that anyone leaked her name intentionally while knowing that it was a classified [[Non-official cover|covert]] identity, in part, Special Counsel Fitzgerald later argued in ''[[United States v. Libby]]'', because of Libby's [[obstruction of justice]].  The jury [[Conviction|convicted]] Libby on four of the five counts in the indictment: one count of [[obstruction of justice]]; two counts of [[perjury]]; and one count of [[making false statements]] to [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|federal investigators]], he was sentenced on June 5, 2007, and [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush|Bush]] [[Commutation of sentence|commuted]] his 30-month prison sentence on July 2, 2007.&lt;ref name=TheCounts&gt;[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/l/i_lewis_libby_jr/index.html "I.

Libby}}

On July 3, 2007, the day after President Bush commuted Libby's sentence, [[Chris Matthews]] talked again with former Ambassador [[Joseph C. Wilson|Wilson]], who reiterated his belief that the Bush administration had inappropriately leaked his wife's then-classified [[Non-official cover|covert]] CIA identity to retaliate against him politically, in effect targeting her. Matthews asked Wilson: "When did you sense that the White House was trying to destroy your reputation?" and he replied: "Well, it was pretty clear to me shortly after I wrote my article [[Joseph C. Wilson#"What I Didn't Find in Africa"|"What I Didn't Find in Africa"]], when Mr. Novak spoke to a friend of mine on the street and said that, Wilson's a 'blank,' and his wife works for the CIA, that the nature of the smear campaign they were going to run against me was going to include the betrayal of her identity as a covert CIA officer.

====Subtitle====
The subtitle "My Life as a Spy, My Betrayal by the White House" corresponds to parts of the subtitle of the 2005 paperback edition of former Ambassador Wilson's memoir ''[[The Politics of Truth|Inside the Lies that Put the White House on Trial and Betrayed My Wife's CIA Identity: A Diplomat's Memoir]]''.  Since her identity was leaked by Richard Armitage, then Deputy Secretary of State, the subtitles are not entirely accurate.

==Review excerpts==
[[Janet Maslin]]:
{{cquote|'Anyone not living in a cave for the last few years [since the outing in 2003] knew I had a career at the C.I.A.,' writes Ms. Wilson .... Once that career was destroyed, she wrote this account of her experiences as a means of both supporting herself and settling scores. She was contractually obligated to submit a draft of the book to the Central Intelligence Agency’s Publications Review Board. That draft came back heavily expurgated. She was then expected to rewrite her book so that it made sense despite many deletions.

But Ms. Wilson and her publisher, Simon &amp; Schuster, contend that much of the censored information is in the public domain—and that the suppression of information is itself part of Ms. Wilson's story. So ''Fair Game'' has been published with the censor's marks visible as blacked-out words, lines, paragraphs or pages. The publisher amplifies the book with an 80-page afterword by Laura Rozen, a reporter, who uses matters of public record to fill in some of the gaps.

'My days of spelling "P-L-A-M as in Mary-E" over the phone would be over,' she writes in what is this book's biggest understatement. But however widely known she has become, Ms. Wilson has not previously revealed what it was like for her to follow the trial of [[Lewis Libby|I. Lewis Libby Jr.]], known as Scooter; to be infuriated that [[Judith Miller (journalist)|Judith Miller]], then of ''[[The New York Times]]'', and [[Matthew Cooper (American journalist)|Matthew Cooper]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' tried to protect secret sources at Ms. Wilson's expense ('These reporters were allowing themselves to be exploited by the administration and were obstructing the investigation'); and to learn that Ms. Miller, in her notebook, had gotten her name wrong, calling her "Valerie Flame" ('my exotic-dancer stage name,' Ms. Wilson joked to friends). She was outraged by the extent to which she had become fodder for the gossip mill.

Citing the dismay voiced by [[Ari Fleischer]], the [[White House]] press secretary, that such loose talk about an undercover agent might actually be criminal, she writes angrily: 'If he was so surprised that his actions might have adverse national security implications, then he's not smart enough to work in the White House. That goes for all the officials who thought that using my name as catnip was just playing the Washington game as usual.'

That idea of gamesmanship gives 'Fair Game,' the book's already stinging title, an even harsher meaning.}}

Alan Cooperman:
{{cquote|There is no reason to doubt that Wilson wrote ''Fair Game'' herself. To put it kindly, the memoir lacks the sheen of a ghostwriter's work and has the voice of an ordinary person caught up in extraordinary events. It doesn't help that the CIA redacted the manuscript heavily before approving it for publication. Each time she is about to launch into a juicy anecdote, it seems, lines are blacked out, sometimes for pages on end.

The book is, however, greatly assisted by an afterword by Laura Rozen, a reporter for the ''American Prospect''. Rozen faithfully echoes Wilson's point of view but fills in many of the censored dates, places and other details from published sources. Readers would be smart to turn to the afterword first, before tackling Wilson's disjointed narrative.}}

==Film adaptation==
In 2010, the book was adapted into [[Fair Game (2010 film)|a film]] starring [[Sean Penn]] and [[Naomi Watts]] as Plame.

'''Gold leaf''' is [[gold]] that has been hammered into thin sheets by [[goldbeating]] and is often used for [[gilding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/gold-leaf|title=gold leaf {{!}} art|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-06-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gold leaf is available in a wide variety of [[carat (purity)|karat]]s and shades. The most commonly used gold is 22-karat yellow gold.

Gold leaf is a type of [[metal leaf]], but the term is rarely used when referring to gold leaf. The term ''metal leaf'' is normally used for thin sheets of metal of any color that do not contain any real gold. Pure gold is 24 karats. Real, yellow gold leaf is approximately 91.7% pure gold. Silver-colored [[white gold]] is about 50% pure gold.

Layering gold leaf over a surface is called '''gold leafing''' or [[gilding]]. Traditional [[water gilding]] is the most difficult and highly regarded form of gold leafing. It has remained virtually unchanged for hundreds of years and is still done by hand.

==In art==
[[File:goldleaf.jpg|left|thumb|22k gold leaf applied with an ox hair brush during the process of [[gilding]]]]

Gold leaf is sometimes used in art in a "raw" state, without a gilding process. In cultures including the [[European Bronze Age]] it was used to wrap objects such as [[bulla (amulet)|bullae]] simply by folding it tightly over, and the Classical group of [[gold lunula]]e are so thin, especially in the centre, that they might be classed as gold leaf.  It has been used in [[jewellery]] in various periods, often as small pieces hanging freely.

Gold leaf has traditionally been most popular and most common in its use as [[gilding]] material for decoration of art (including [[statue]]s and [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] [[icon]]s) or the [[picture frame]]s that are often used to hold or decorate paintings, [[mixed media]], small objects (including [[jewelry]]) and paper art. [[Gold glass]] is gold leaf held between two pieces of glass, and was used for decorated Ancient Roman vessels, where some of the gold was scraped off to form an image, as well as [[tesserae]] gold mosaics.  "Gold-ground" paintings, where the background of the figures was all in gold, was introduced in mosaics in later [[Early Christian art]], and then used in [[icon]]s and Western panel paintings until the late [[Middle Ages]]; all techniques use gold leaf. Gold leaf is also used in [https://royalthaiart.com/painting-catalog/buddha-painting/ Buddhist art] to decorate statues and symbols. Gold leafing can also be seen on domes in religious and public architecture. "Gold" frames made without leafing are also available for a considerably lower price, but traditionally some form of gold or metal leaf was preferred when possible and gold leafed (or silver leafed) moulding is still commonly available from many of the companies that produce commercially available moulding for use as picture frames.

==In architecture==
[[File:Rom, Basilika Santa Maria Maggiore, Innenansicht.jpg|thumb|left|Interior of the [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]]]]
Gold leaf has long been an integral component of [[architecture]] to designate important structures, both for aesthetics and because gold's non-reactive nature provides a protective finish.

Gold in architecture became an integral component of Byzantine and Roman churches and basilicas in 400 AD, most notably [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]] in Rome. The church was built by [[Pope Sixtus III]] and is one of the earliest examples of [[Mosaic gold|gold mosaics]]. The mosaics were made of stone, tile or glass backed on gold leaf walls, giving the church a beautifully intricate backdrop. The Athenian marble columns supporting the nave are even older, and either come from the first basilica, or from another antique Roman building; thirty-six are marble and four granite, pared down, or shortened to make them identical  by Ferdinando Fuga, who provided them with identical gilt-bronze capitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beny|Gunn|1981|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 14th century [[campanile]], or bell tower, is the highest in Rome, at 240 feet, (about 75 m.). The basilica's 16th-century coffered ceiling, designed by [[Giuliano da Sangallo]], is said to be gilded with gold that [[Christopher Columbus]] presented to [[Ferdinand and Isabella]], before being passed on to the Spanish pope, [[Pope Alexander VI|Alexander VI]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles A. Coulombe]], ''Vicars of Christ'', p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt; The apse mosaic, the [[Coronation of the Virgin]], is from 1295, signed by the [[Franciscan]] friar, [[Jacopo Torriti]].
[[File:Senate ceiling.jpg|thumb|right|Gold leaf and painted coffers of the Senate chamber ceiling in [[Centre Block]]]]
In [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], The [[Centre Block]] is the main building of the Canadian parliamentary complex on Parliament Hill, containing the House of Commons and Senate chambers, as well as the offices of a number of members of parliament, senators, and senior administration for both legislative houses. It is also the location of several ceremonial spaces, such as the Hall of Honour, the Memorial Chamber, and Confederation Hall.
In the east wing of the Centre Block is the [[Senate of Canada|Senate]] chamber, in which are the [[throne]]s for the [[Monarchy of Canada|Canadian monarch]] and her [[List of Canadian monarchs#List of royal consorts of Canada|consort]], or for the [[Governor General of Canada|federal viceroy]] and his or her [[Viceregal consort of Canada|consort]], and from which either the sovereign or the governor general gives the [[Speech from the Throne]] and grants [[Royal Assent]] to bills passed by parliament. &lt;ref name=Senate&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collineduparlement-parliamenthill.gc.ca/histoire-history/centre/senat-senate-eng.html |title=A Treasure to Explore &gt; Parliament Hill &gt; History of the Hill &gt; Centre Block &gt; Senate |author=Public Works and Government Services Canada |publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada |accessdate=2008-12-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090914000132/http://www.collineduparlement-parliamenthill.gc.ca/histoire-history/centre/senat-senate-eng.html |archivedate=2009-09-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The overall color in the Senate chamber is red, seen in the upholstery, carpeting, and draperies, and reflecting the color scheme of the [[Palace of Westminster#Lords Chamber|House of Lords]] in the United Kingdom; red was a royal color, associated with the Crown and [[hereditary peer]]s. Capping the room is a [[Gilding|gilt]] ceiling with deep octagonal [[coffer]]s, each filled with [[Heraldry|heraldic]] symbols, including maple leaves, fleur-de-lis, [[Lion (heraldry)#Lions rampant|lions rampant]], [[clàrsach]], [[Welsh Dragon]]s, and [[Lion (heraldry)#Lions passant|lions passant]]. This plane rests on six pairs and four single [[pilaster]]s, each of which is capped by a [[caryatid]], and between which are [[clerestory]] windows. Below the windows is a continuous architrave, broken only by [[baldachin]]s at the base of each of the above pilasters.
On the east and west walls of the chamber are eight [[mural]]s depicting scenes from the First World War; painted in between 1916 and 1920, they were originally part of the more than 1,000 piece Canadian War Memorials Fund, founded by [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|the Lord Beaverbrook]], and were intended to hang in a specific memorial structure. However, the project never eventuated, and the works were stored at the [[National Gallery of Canada]] until 1921, when the Parliament requested a loan for some of the collection's oil paintings to display in the Centre Block.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/about/warpaintings/intro-e.asp| title=The War Paintings in the Senate Chamber &gt; Introduction| author=Library of Parliament| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=2009-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/about/warpaintings/foreword-e.asp| title=The War Paintings in the Senate Chamber &gt; Foreword| author=Library of Parliament| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=2009-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The murals have remained in the Senate chamber ever since.
[[File:Crit Photo.jpg|thumb|left|Interior of the [[Criterion Restaurant]]]]


In [[London]], the [[Criterion Restaurant]] is an opulent building facing [[Piccadilly Circus]] in the heart of London. It was built by architect [[Thomas Verity]] in [[Neo-Byzantine]] style for the partnership [[Felix Spiers|Spiers]] and [[Christopher Pond|Pond]] who opened it in 1873. One of the restaurant’s most famous features is the 'glistering' ceiling of gold mosaic, coved at the sides and patterned all over with lines and ornaments in blue and white [[tesserae]]. The wall decoration accords well with the real yellow gold leaf ceiling, incorporating semi-precious stones such as [[jade]], [[mother of pearl]], [[turquoise]] being lined with warm [[marble]] and formed into [[Blind arcade|blind arcades]] with semi-elliptical [[Arch|arches]] resting on slender octagonal columns, their unmolded capitals and the impost being encrusted with [[Monreale|goldground mosaic]] &lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vols29-30/pt1/pp251-270#fnn37 |title=Survey of London: Volumes 29 and 30, St James Westminster, Part 1 |work=British History Online |date=1960 |accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Gold leaf adorns the wrought iron gates surrounding the [[Palace of Versailles]] in France, when refinishing the gates nearly 200 years after they were torn down during the [[French Revolution]], it required hundreds of kilograms of gold leaf to complete the process&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=February 1989|title="L'ameublement de la chambre de Louis XIV à Versailles de 1701 à nos jours".|url=|journal=gazette des Beaux-Arts (6th ed.)|volume=|pages=79-104|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Culinary uses==
Gold leaf (as well as other [[metal leaf]] such as [[vark]]) is sometimes used to decorate food or drink, typically to promote a perception of luxury and high value; however, it is flavorless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hopkins | first1 = Jerry | title = Extreme Cuisine: The Weird &amp; Wonderful Foods that People Eat | publisher = Tuttle Publishing | year = 2004 | pages = 289–292 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=DJDKaxEEfYgC&amp;dq | accessdate = 2013-08-15 | isbn = 978-0794602550}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is occasionally found in [[dessert]]s and [[confectionery]], including chocolates, honey and ''[[Indian sweets|mithai]]''. In India it may be used effectively as a garnish, with thin sheets placed on a main dish, especially on festive occasions. When used as an additive to food, gold has the [[E-number]] E175.  A traditional (centuries old) artisan variety of green tea contains pieces of gold leaf; 99% of this kind of tea is produced in [[Kanazawa]], [[Japan]], a historic city for [[samurai]] craftsmanship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.city.kanazawa.ishikawa.jp/dentou_e/way/tea/try/trye.html|title=Japanese Culture/The Way/Tea ceremony/Let's Try|website=www.city.kanazawa.ishikawa.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The city is also home to a gold leaf museum, [[Kanazawa Yasue Gold Leaf Museum]].

[[File:Infuehr-Oesterreich-Gold-trocken-effekt.jpg|thumb|100px|Austrian Gold sparkling wine with gold leaves]] 
In [[Continental Europe]] liquors with tiny floating pieces of gold leaf are known of since the late 16th century; originally the practice was regarded as medicinal.  Well-known examples are [[Danziger Goldwasser]], originally from [[Gdańsk]], Poland, which has been produced since at least 1598, [[Gold Strike (drink)|Goldstrike]] from [[Amsterdam]], [[Schwabacher Goldwasser (drink)|Goldwasser]] from [[Schwabach]] in [[Germany]], and the Swiss [[Goldschläger]], which is perhaps the best known in the United States.

'''Imparja Television''' (IMP) is an Australian television station servicing remote eastern and central Australia, that began broadcasting on 2 January 1988. It is based in [[Alice Springs]], where it has a studio and satellite uplink facility. Notably, it is controlled by [[Australian Aboriginals]] through ownership by [[Imparja Television Pty Ltd]], and is widely regarded as a symbol of Aboriginal Australia. Most viewers receive Imparja via [[free to view]] satellite transmission, whilst a smaller proportion receive it via analogue terrestrial transmission.

''Imparja'' is an [[Arrernte language|Arrernte]] word meaning [[footprints]]. The word is used to represent that Imparja Television aims to service Arrente people wherever they may live, from [[Mutitjulu]] to [[Kings Canyon (Northern Territory)|King's Canyon]] to [[Alice Springs]] to [[Tennant Creek]] and beyond. They describe their range as a footprint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Imparja Television was identified on-air and in print as '''Nine Imparja''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release
  | title = New Current Affairs Program
  | publisher = Imparja Television
  | date = 27 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; following its dropping of Network Ten affiliation. In 2009, the station again identifies as simply "Imparja" and "IMP", although the Nine Network's nine dots seen in the logo still remain.

==History==

===Origins===
The then [[Australian Broadcasting Authority|Australian Broadcasting Tribunal]] was asked by the Federal Minister for Communications in October 1984 to inquire into the allocation of commercial television licences for a number of remote areas. Licences were granted in 1985 to the [[Golden West Network]], which broadcast to Western Australia, and [[Southern Cross Central|QSTV]] in north-eastern Australia.&lt;ref name="company"&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.imparja.com.au/company.htm

 |df=dmy-all 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986 hearings for the allocation of the licence began, and the [[Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association]] (CAAMA), which began providing Central Australian radio programs in local languages in 1980, formed [[Imparja Television Pty Ltd]] as a company.&lt;ref name="company" /&gt; Soon after, the [[Government of the Northern Territory]] announced support to underpin the viability of the Central Zone Remote Television Service (RCTS) by offering to purchase an estimated $2&amp;nbsp;million package of services from the successful applicant. The [[Government of South Australia]] undertook a similar promise, offering loans of $1&amp;nbsp;million to Imparja if they were successful.&lt;ref name="company" /&gt; An extraordinary saga of political, legal and commercial intrigue then ensued during the protracted [[Australian Broadcasting Tribunal]] (ABT) hearing process, pitching Federal, State and Territory Governments against one another with loan promises being substantially watered down or withdrawn as it became apparent the CAAMA application may prevail. Windfall funding from the Australian Bicentennial Authority and the Aboriginal Development Commission ultimately underpinned the feasibility of the CAAMA bid and they were successfully allocated the licence. However subsequent Federal Administrative Tribunal court proceedings brought about by the unsuccessful applicant, Darwin based Territory Television Ltd., attempting to overturn the ABT's decision delayed construction commencement of the new service until May 1987.&lt;ref name="Bell 2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Wendy|title=A Remote Possibility: The Battle for Imparja Television|date=May 2008|publisher=IAD Press|location=Alice Springs|isbn=978-1-86465-097-6|chapter=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By October 1987 the new station had begun to build rebroadcast sites and new studios and a main transmitter based in [[Alice Springs]] were completed.&lt;ref name="Bell 2008"/&gt; Imparja's first test program, ''[[Test Cricket|Australia versus Sri Lanka Test Cricket]]'', was telecast on 2 January 1988 in [[Alice Springs]].&lt;ref name="company" /&gt; Two weeks later, on 15 January 1988, the station was officially inaugurated at Imparja Television's head office in Alice Springs by Minister for Communications [[Ralph Willis]] and [[Warren Snowdon]], the Australian federal [[member of parliament#Australia|member of parliament]] for the [[Division of Lingiari]] in [[Northern Territory]].&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web

Imparja became the first Aboriginal member of the [[FreeTV Australia|Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations]] and the now-defunct Regional Television Association, both dominant organisations at the time.&lt;ref name="company" /&gt;

Imparja was chaired by [[Freda Glynn]] for its first 10 years and, for a time, she was the only female chair of a television network in the world. Freda was one of the first three founders of [[CAAMA]] – the others being [[John Macumba]] and [[Philip Batty]].

Imparja had an initial population reach of 62,000 people, which by 1993 had grown to 125,000.&lt;ref name="about" /&gt; Imparja was available through retransmission sites at [[Ceduna]], [[Coober Pedy]], [[Leigh Creek]] and [[Woomera, South Australia|Woomera]] in South Australia, and [[Alice Springs]], [[Tennant Creek]], [[Katherine]] and [[Bathurst Island (Northern Territory)|Bathurst Island]] in the [[Northern Territory]], as well as on the [[Optus Aurora]] [[satellite television|satellite]] platform.

Imparja initially carried programming from all three major Australian commercial television networks, but following aggregation of market area with [[Southern Cross Central|QSTV]], it affiliated with the [[Nine Network]] and [[Network Ten]]. Imparja also screened some [[ABC Television (Australia)|ABC Television]] and [[SBS Television]] indigenous programs, all in addition to original programs commissioned by the station.

===1990s===
In 1990, ''Imparja Local News'' was launched as a fifteen-minute insert of local news into the national bulletin. The station also covered the [[Northern Territory general election, 1990|Northern Territory general election]] live from its Alice Springs studios. This followed the lead taken in 1989 when the station began to produce weather reports for parts of the [[Northern Territory]], South Australia and [[New South Wales]], presented by [[Lavinia Hampton]].&lt;ref name="company" /&gt;

By 1993, Imparja's viewing audience had doubled to approximately 125,000 Australians. This in turn led to the increased allocation of government funding in 1994 to produce ''Yamba's Playtime'', which was the station's first in-house televisual production. [[Yamba's Playtime]] features the station's official mascot, "Yamba". Also in 1994, the Imparja board of directors established the Imparja Business Development Sub Committee, to monitor and provide strategic recommendations for areas of growth for the company.

In 1995, Imparja received the [[Telstra]] Indigenous Business Award for Business of the Year.&lt;ref name="about" /&gt; Also in 1995, Imparja's satellite transmission moved from the [[Optus fleet of satellites#A-Class|Aussat A-Class satellites]] to the [[Optus fleet of satellites#Optus B1|Optus B1]] satellite, and the station's licence was renewed.

Two new in-house productions were launched in 1996. The first being the ''BRACS Program'', which was almost fully produced by [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] communities, and ''Corroboree Rock'', an Aboriginal music program.

Imparja's parent company, [[Imparja Pty Ltd]], converted to a [[proprietary company]] in 1997, whilst in the late 1990s, Imparja moved to digital satellite technology on the [[Optus Aurora]] platform. This meant that Imparja's satellite transmission moved from the [[Optus fleet of satellites#Optus B1|Optus B1]] satellite to the [[Optus fleet of satellites#Optus C1|Optus C1]] satellite.

===2000s===
By 2001 the station's coverage area had grown to include over 430,000 people.&lt;ref name="company" /&gt; Around this time 'Imparja Info Channel' ('Channel 31') was launched, providing additional programming, news, and community information to remote Aboriginal communities. The Aboriginal programming on this channel later became known as [[Indigenous Community Television]] (ICTV). In 2007, the whole channel was replaced by [[National Indigenous Television]] (NITV).

Imparja faced criticism by a number of community groups in 2004, following the station's decision to introduce advertising for alcohol for the first time. The network pledged to donate 30% of the total income received from [[alcohol advertising]] towards alcohol and substance abuse programs in communities.

In 2005, ''Imparja National News'', which primarily covered the news in [[Alice Springs]] in addition to other national and international news stories, was axed. The move was taken in anticipation of the Remote Eastern &amp; Central Australia TV1 licence area being merged with that of [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]]. Regulations imposed by the [[Australian Communications and Media Authority]] relating to minimum levels of local news coverage led to 2006 reinstatement of ''Imparja National News''. The news service began broadcasting again from the middle of February 2006, with [[Ryan Liddle]] as presenter.&lt;ref name="alcohol"&gt;{{cite web

In the mid-2000s, it was widely expected that the [[Australian Communications and Media Authority]] would merge the "[[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]]" and "Remote Eastern and Central Australia" commercial television licence areas. This would have most likely seen Imparja Television become a [[Network Ten]] affiliate in Darwin. However, this did not eventuate. Instead [[PBL Media]] and [[Southern Cross Broadcasting]], the two existing Darwin Commercial licence holders were invited to bid individually or together. Their successful joint bid used a company called [[Darwin Digital Television]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

On 3 February 2008, Imparja Television updated its logo removing the emblem, which had been present on the logo for two decades. The logo change coincided with Imparja dropping [[Network Ten]] affiliation, becoming a sole [[Nine Network]] affiliate, in addition to axing ''Imparja National News'', and also adding Nine Network's dots to its new logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===2010s===
On 19 May 2010, the ACMA (Australian Communications and Media Authority) approved a licence for a new remote area digital-only TV channel, a joint venture by Imparja Pty Ltd and Southern Cross Central.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acma.gov.au/WEB/STANDARD/pc=PC_312142 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=18 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019212642/http://acma.gov.au/WEB/STANDARD/pc%3DPC_312142 |archivedate=19 October 2010 |df=dmy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was launched on 30 June 2010 as "[[Central Digital Television|Ten Central (CDT)]]". It had two feeds, Ten Central North (QLD/NT) and Ten Central South (NSW/SA/Vic/Tas).

In December 2010, Imparja Television began broadcasting on terrestrial digital TV and the new [[Viewer Access Satellite Television|VAST]] satellite service. This expansion included the establishment of two feeds for these platforms, Imparja North (Qld/NT) and Imparja South (NSW/SA/Vic/Tas). As of 2010, their programming is exactly the same.

Imparja Pty Ltd also began to launch digital channels [[9Go!|GO!]] and [[9Gem|GEM]].

As of the moment, Imparja continues to stream the HD feed of [[9Gem]], which was rebranded as a standard definition channel in Nine Network-only on 26 November 2015 in its metropolitan and Darwin stations, along with [[9Life]] and the relaunch of [[9HD]]. There are currently no plans at this stage for Imparja to launch an HD simulcast or introduce 9Life to its viewers. It will continue with its existing lineup of three broadcast channels.

Imparja Television is a sole [[Nine Network]] affiliate. The station previously broadcast both Nine and Ten programming, however it stopped broadcasting [[Network Ten]] programming on 3 February 2008.&lt;ref name="affiliation"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Imparja Television has also aired  original programs produced by local Aboriginal community members, such as [[Bush Mechanics]] and the children's program ''[[Yamba's Playtime]]''. Imparja also airs programming relating to local [[Australian rules football]] and community sports, as well as news updates and religious ''thought for the day'' programs. Imparja Television also regularly broadcasts films created by the [[Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association]], which is a shareholder of its parent company.

Imparja's programming schedule is currently based on the Nine Network schedule for Brisbane (based on [[Australian Eastern Standard Time|Eastern Standard Time]]). Prior to February 2008, scheduling was generally based on [[Australian Central Standard Time|Central Standard Time]], reflecting its Alice Springs-based heritage. As a result, programs are now broadcast half an hour earlier than they previously would have been under the previous arrangement.

===News and current affairs===
Imparja does not currently produce its own evening regional news bulletin. In 2008, Imparja replaced ''[[Imparja National News]]'' – a 30-minute, weeknightly program combining local and national/international news – with local news updates, plus a 30-minute local news magazine program, ''Footprints'' (which later ceased production in 2009). The news updates were presented by Emma Groves from 2014 until July 2016. This brings Imparja's daily news service roughly into line with its competitor in the Remote Eastern and Central Australia licence area, [[QQQ|Southern Cross Central (QQQ)]].

The 6:00&amp;nbsp;pm ([[Australian Eastern Standard Time|AEST]]) time slot is filled by a simulcast of ''[[Nine News Queensland]]''. Imparja cites its geographic distribution, with a majority of the remote licence area's viewers now located in Queensland, as a "key factor" in selecting the Queensland bulletin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 Imparja began airing the Darwin edition of [[Nine News#Darwin|Nine News]] live at 6:30&amp;nbsp;pm (AEST) on weekdays, immediately following the Brisbane edition, in place of ''[[A Current Affair (Australian TV series)|A Current Affair]]'' – thereby restoring a [[Northern Territory]]-based bulletin to the station.

===Sport===
Imparja airs most sports coverage from the Nine Network, including [[rugby league]], [[cricket]], golf and tennis. The station also broadcast [[motorsport]] and [[Australian rules football]] coverage until 2008.

==Availability==
Imparja Television broadcasts throughout most of the Northern Territory, and also to some remote parts of [[Queensland]], [[New South Wales]], South Australia, [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]], [[Tasmania]] and [[Norfolk Island]]. It is generally available by satellite on the [[Viewer Access Satellite Television|VAST]] or [[Optus Aurora]] platforms, though in some locations it is broadcast terrestrially. Imparja Television has the largest geographic range of any commercial television network in Australia. Imparja is also received on the [[TT-Line (Australia)|Spirit of Tasmania]] Bass Strait Ferries.

Imparja Television was previously available in [[New Zealand]] until March 2008 when the New Zealand government pressured the Australian government to remove the service from the satellite footprint that includes New Zealand.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

The total population serviced by Imparja Television is over 700,000 people, boasting the largest footprint in the southern hemisphere.

Imparja is also available in Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea through the HiTRON subscription television service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hitron.com.pg/mmds_2006.html HiTRON Limited – Papua New Guinea :: MMDS TV] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615202949/http://www.hitron.com.pg/mmds_2006.html |date=15 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logos==
Imparja Television's first logo was developed from a painting produced by an [[Arrernte people|Arrernte]] artist and traditional owner. The logo symbolised the [[MacDonnell Ranges]], the [[Todd River]] and the [[Yeperenye caterpillar]].&lt;ref name="aboutlogo"&gt;{{cite web

An '''incunable''', or sometimes '''incunabulum''' (plural '''incunables''' or '''incunabula''', respectively), is a [[book]], pamphlet, or [[Broadside (printing)|broadside]] [[printing|printed]] in [[Europe]] before the year 1501. (Importantly, incunabula are not [[manuscript]]s.) {{As of|2014|post=,}} there are about 30,000 distinct known incunable [[Edition (book)|edition]]s extant. The number of surviving copies in [[Germany]] alone is estimated at around 125,000.&lt;ref&gt;[[British Library]]: [http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/istc/index.html Incunabula Short Title Catalogue] gives 30,375 editions as of March 2014, which also includes some prints from the 16th century though (retrieved 23 July 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to Bettina Wagner: "Das Second-Life der Wiegendrucke. Die Inkunabelsammlung der Bayerischen Staatsbibliothek", in: Griebel, Rolf; Ceynowa, Klaus (eds.): "Information, Innovation, Inspiration. 450 Jahre Bayerische Staatsbibliothek", K G Saur, München 2008, {{ISBN|978-3-598-11772-5}}, pp. 207–224 (207f.) the Incunabula Short Title Catalogue lists 30,375 titles published before 1501.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
"Incunable" is the [[Anglicisation|anglicised]] singular form of ''incunabula'', [[Latin]] for "[[swaddling]] clothes" or "[[bassinet|cradle]]",&lt;ref&gt;C.T. Lewis and C. Short, ''A Latin Dictionary'', Oxford 1879, p. 930. The word ''incunabula'' is a neuter plural only; the singular ''incunabulum'' is never found in Latin and not used in English by most specialists.&lt;/ref&gt; which can refer to "the earliest stages or first traces in the development of anything".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 1933, I:188.&lt;/ref&gt; A former term for "incunable" is '''"fifteener"''',&lt;!--fifteener redirects here--&gt; referring to the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Introduction to Incunabula | url=http://www.historicpages.com/texts/incun1.htm | publisher=Barber, Phil | accessdate=6 July 2017 | quote="Incunabula" is a generic term coined by English book collectors in the seventeenth century to describe the first printed books of the fifteenth century. It is a more elegant replacement for what had previously been called 'fifteeners', and is formed of two Latin words meaning literally 'in the cradle' or 'in swaddling clothes'. The word is plural; in referring to a single fifteenth century book, "incunabulum" is correct.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Fifteener" is a coinage of the bibliographer [[Thomas Frognall Dibdin]], a term endorsed by [[William Morris]] and [[Robert Proctor (bibliographer)|Robert Proctor]]. {{harv|Carter|Barker|2004|p=130}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''incunabula'' as a printing term was first used by the Dutch physician and humanist [[Hadrianus Junius|Hadrianus Iunius]] (Adriaan de Jonghe, 1511–1575) and appears in a passage from his posthumous work (written in 1569): Hadrianus Iunius, ''Batavia'', [...], [Lugduni Batavorum], ex officina Plantiniana, apud Franciscum Raphelengium, '''1588''', p. 256 l. 3: «inter prima artis [typographicae] '''incunabula'''», a term ("the first infancy of printing") to which he arbitrarily set an end of 1500 which still stands as a convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Glomski|first1=J|title=Incunabula Typographiae: seventeenth-century views on early printing|journal=The Library|volume=2|pages=336|year=2001|doi=10.1093/library/2.4.336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only by a misunderstanding was [[Bernhard von Mallinckrodt]] (1591–1664) considered to be the inventor of this meaning of ''incunabula''; the identical passage is found in his Latin pamphlet ''De ortu ac progressu artis typographicae'' ("On the rise and progress of the typographic art", [[Cologne]], 1640): Bernardus a Mallinkrot, ''De ortu ac progressu artis typographicae dissertatio historica'', [...], Coloniae Agrippinae, apud Ioannem Kinchium, '''1640''' (in frontispiece: 1639), p. 29 l. 16: «inter prima artis [typographicae] '''incunabula'''», within a long passage of several pages, which he (correctly) quotes entirely in italic characters (that is between quotation marks), referring to the name of author and work cited: «Primus istorum [...] Hadrianus Iunius est, cuius integrum locum, ex ''Batavia'' eius, operae pretium est adscribere; [...]. Ita igitur Iunius» (ibid., p. 27 ll. 27-32, followed by the long passage, «Redeo → sordes», ibid., p. 27, l. 32 – p. 33 l. 32 [= ''Batavia'', p. 253 l. 28 – p. 258 l. 21]). So the source is only one, the other is a quotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2009|title=Le baptême inconscient de l'incunable: non pas 1640 mais 1569 au plus tard|url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00791398v2|journal=Gutenberg Jahrbuch|volume=84|pages=102–105|language=French|doi=|last1=Sordet|first1=Yann}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''incunabula'' came to denote the printed books themselves in the late 17th century. [[John Evelyn]], in moving the [[Arundel Manuscripts]] to the [[Royal Society]] in August 1678, remarked of the printed books among the manuscripts: "The printed books, being of the oldest impressions, are not the less valuable; I esteem them almost equal to MSS."&lt;ref&gt;Evelyn, ''The Diary of John Evelyn From 1641 to 1705/6''.&lt;/ref&gt; The convenient but arbitrarily chosen end date for identifying a printed book as an incunable does not reflect any notable developments in the printing process, and many books printed for a number of years after 1500 continued to be visually indistinguishable from incunables.  

'''"Post-incunable"''' typically refers to books printed after 1500 up to another arbitrary end date such as 1520 or 1540. From around this period the dating of any edition becomes easier, as the practice of printers including information such as the place and year of printing became more widespread.

==Types==
There are two types of ''incunabula'' in printing: the [[block book]], printed from a single carved or sculpted wooden block for each page, employing the same process as the [[woodcut]] in art (these may be called ''xylographic''); and the ''[[Typography|typographic book]]'', made with individual pieces of cast-metal [[movable type]] on a [[printing press]]. Many authors reserve the term ''incunabula'' for the latter kind only.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Companion to the Book'', ed. M. F. Suarez and H. R. Woudhuysen, OUP, 2010, s.v. 'Incunabulum', p. 815.&lt;/ref&gt;

The spread of [[printing]] to cities both in the north and in Italy ensured that there was great variety in the texts chosen for printing and the styles in which they appeared. Many early [[typeface]]s were modelled on local forms of [[writing]] or derived from the various European forms of [[Blackletter|Gothic]] script, but there were also some derived from documentary scripts (such as most of [[William Caxton|Caxton]]'s types), and, particularly in Italy, types modelled on handwritten scripts and [[calligraphy]] employed by [[Renaissance humanism|humanists]].

Printers congregated in urban centres where there were [[scholar]]s, [[ecclesiastic]]s, [[lawyers]], and [[nobles]] and [[profession]]als who formed their major customer base. Standard works in [[Latin]] inherited from the medieval tradition formed the bulk of the earliest printed works, but as books became cheaper, [[vernacular]] works (or translations into vernaculars of standard works) began to appear.

==Famous examples==
[[File:Pfister.faks.1.jpg|thumb|left|240px|First incunable with illustrations, Ulrich Boner's ''Der Edelstein,'' printed by Albrecht Pfister, Bamberg, 1461]]
The most famous ''incunabula'' include two from [[Mainz]], the [[Gutenberg Bible]] of 1455 and the ''[[Peregrinatio in terram sanctam]]'' of 1486, printed and illustrated by [[Erhard Reuwich]]; the ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'' written by [[Hartmann Schedel]] and printed by [[Anton Koberger]] in 1493; and the ''[[Hypnerotomachia Poliphili]]'' printed by [[Aldus Manutius]] with important illustrations by an unknown artist. 

Other printers of incunabula were [[Günther Zainer]] of [[Augsburg]], [[Johannes Mentelin]] and [[Heinrich Eggestein]] of [[Strasbourg]], [[Heinrich Gran]] of [[Haguenau]] and [[William Caxton]] of [[Bruges]] and [[London]]. The first incunable to have woodcut illustrations was [[Ulrich Boner]]'s ''Der Edelstein'', printed by [[Albrecht Pfister]] in [[Bamberg]] in 1461.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel De Simone (ed), ''A Heavenly Craft: the Woodcut in Early Printed Books,'' New York, 2004, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-incunable ==
Many incunabula are undated, needing complex bibliographical analysis to place them correctly. The post-incunabula period marks a time of development during which the printed book evolved fully as a mature artefact with a standard format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |title=The Book Triumphant: Print in Transition in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries |editor1-last=Walsby |editor1-first=Malcolm |editor2-last=Kemp |editor2-first=Graeme |publisher=Brill |year=2011 |page=viii |isbn=9789004207233 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cysqnfvAUEAC&amp;pg=PR7}}&lt;/ref&gt; After c. 1540 books tended to conform to a template that included the author, title-page, date, seller, and place of printing. This makes it much easier to identify any particular edition.{{sfn|Walsby|Kemp|2011|p=viii}}

As noted above, the ''end date'' for identifying a printed book as an incunable is convenient but was chosen arbitrarily; it does not reflect any notable developments in the printing process around the year 1500. Books printed for a number of years after 1500 continued to look much like incunables, with the notable exception of the small format books printed in [[italic type]] introduced by [[Aldus Manutius]] in 1501. The term '''post-incunable''' is sometimes used to refer to books printed "after 1500—how long after, the experts have not yet agreed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv| |first=John |last=Carter |first2=Nicolas |last2=Barker |title=ABC for Book Collectors |url=http://www.ilab.org/download.php?object=documentation&amp;id=29 |format=PDF |accessdate=28 May 2010 |edition=8th |year=2004 |publisher=Oak Knoll Press and the British Library |location=New Castle, Del. |isbn=1-58456-112-2 |page=172}} {{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; For books printed in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], the term generally covers 1501–1520, and for books printed in mainland [[Europe]], 1501–1540.{{sfn|Carter|Barker|2004|p=172}}

The 18 languages that incunabula are printed in, in descending order, are: Latin, [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], English, [[Hebrew]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Church Slavonic]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Breton language|Breton]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Frisian languages|Frisian]] and [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]] (see diagram).

Only about one edition in ten (i.e. just over 3,000) has any illustrations, [[woodcut]]s or [[metalcut]]s.

The "commonest" incunable is Schedel's ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'' ("Liber Chronicarum") of 1493, with c 1,250 surviving copies (which is also the most heavily illustrated). Many incunabula are unique, but on average about 18 copies survive of each. This makes the [[Gutenberg Bible]], at 48 or 49 known copies, a relatively common (though extremely valuable) edition. Counting extant incunabula is complicated by the fact that most libraries consider a single volume of a multi-volume work as a separate item, as well as fragments or copies lacking more than half the total leaves. A complete incunable may consist of a slip, or up to ten volumes.

In terms of [[Book size|format]], the 29,000-odd editions comprise: 2,000 [[broadside (printing)|broadsides]], 9,000 [[Folio (printing)|folios]], 15,000 [[quarto]]s, 3,000 [[octavo]]s, 18 [[Book size|12mos]], 230 [[Book size|16mos]], 20 [[Book size|32mos]], and 3 [[Book size|64mos]].

ISTC at present cites 528 extant copies of books printed by [[William Caxton|Caxton]], which together with 128 fragments makes 656 in total, though many are broadsides or very imperfect (incomplete).

Apart from migration to mainly North American and Japanese universities, there has been little movement of incunabula in the last five centuries. None were printed in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], and the latter appears to possess less than 2,000 copies, about 97.75% remain north of the equator. However many incunabula are sold at auction or through the rare book trade every year.

==Major collections==
The [[British Library]]'s [[Incunabula Short Title Catalogue]] now records over 29,000 titles, of which around 27,400 are incunabula editions (not all unique works). Studies of incunabula began in the 17th century. [[Michel Maittaire]] (1667–1747) and [[Georg Wolfgang Panzer]] (1729–1805) arranged printed material chronologically in annals format, and in the first half of the 19th century, [[Ludwig Hain]] published, ''Repertorium bibliographicum''— a checklist of incunabula arranged alphabetically by author: "Hain numbers" are still a reference point. Hain was expanded in subsequent editions, by [[Walter A. Copinger]] and [[Dietrich Reichling]], but it is being superseded by the authoritative modern listing, a German catalogue, the ''[[Gesamtkatalog der Wiegendrucke]]'', which has been under way since 1925 and is still being compiled at the [[Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin]]. North American holdings were listed by [[Frederick R. Goff]] and a worldwide union catalogue is provided by the [[Incunabula Short Title Catalogue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/istc/|title=ISTC|accessdate=2009-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable collections, with the approximate numbers of incunabula held, include:

He has also produced [[limited edition]] prints. He was a friend of the [[conservation movement|conservationist]] and fellow painter [[Peter Scott]], with whom he travelled to [[Antarctica]]. Like Scott, he went to [[Oundle School]]. He was also a presenter on the [[BBC]] children's television programme ''[[Animal Magic (TV series)|Animal Magic]]'' and of the [[Children's ITV]] series ''Animals in Action'', produced by [[Anglia Television]] using footage from its ''[[Survival (TV series)|Survival]]'' series.

A [[retrospective]] exhibition of his "Polar Art", depicting creatures and scenery from both the [[Arctic]] and Antarctic was open at the [[Scott Polar Research Institute]] in May and June 2007.

Shackleton was appointed [[Member of the Order of the British Empire]] (MBE) in the 2012 Birthday Honours for services to the conservation of wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=60173|supp=y|page=21|date=16 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Landscape with a Windmill Near a Town Moat''''' (c. 1650s) is an [[oil painting|oil]] on canvas painting by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] landscape painter [[Jacob van Ruisdael]].
It is an example of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and is now in a private collection.

This painting was documented by [[Hofstede de Groot]] in 1911, who wrote; "174. LANDSCAPE WITH A WIND-MILL. [[John Smith (art historian)|Sm. 135.]] A town-moat stretches from the distance to the foreground, which it almost fills. In the immediate right foreground is the reedy bank with a wooden bridge. Farther back are brick walls, the remains of a sluice, which are connected by planks. A man with a dog crosses to the left bank which is thickly planted with trees. Near the bank is a boat on the water. In the middle distance is a man in a flat-bottomed boat on the sunlit water. Farther back is a wooden drawbridge over the moat to the town, above whose wall rise house-roofs and a great wooden mill. A fine summer day with clouds in the sky. More or less in the style of Hobbema. The figures are by Ruisdael himself. An attractive picture. Canvas, 25 inches by 30 1/2 inches. Engraved by J. H. Wright in the Stafford Gallery. In the collection of Lord Francis Egerton, London, 1835 (Sm.). In the collection of the Earl of Ellesmere, Bridgewater House, London, 1892 catalogue, No. 197."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/catalogueraisonn04hofsuoft#page/60/mode/1up  Entry 174 for ''''Landscape with a Wind-Mill''] in Hofstede de Groot, 1911&lt;/ref&gt;

This painting was documented in earlier estate sale catalogs of Pieter Locquet and [[Jan Gildemeester]] and Hofstede de Groot therefore listed it also as #16, though at the time he didn't know it was the same painting as his #174.

'''Macro Sea''' is an American real estate development firm formed in 2009 by developer [[David Belt]]. Primarily known for its development of adaptive reuse and interim use projects, Macro Sea has been the subject of substantial media coverage recently because of its development of New Lab, Building 128 in the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Brooklyn Navy Yard Is Home to Manufacturing Cooperative|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/nyregion/brooklyn-navy-yard-is-home-to-manufacturing-cooperative.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2013-05-08|access-date = 2015-10-02|issn = 0362-4331|first = Patrick|last = Mcgeehan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = From Relic to Beacon: Brooklyn Navy Yard Gets New Life as Cutting-Edge Manufacturing Hub|url = http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/231905|accessdate = 2015-10-02|first = Catherine|last = Clifford}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A Manufacturing Renaissance at the Brooklyn Navy Yard|url = http://www.thirteen.org/metrofocus/2012/08/a-manufacturing-renaissance-at-the-brooklyn-navy-yard/|accessdate = 2015-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their portfolio includes educational, arts, retail, residential buildings, student housing, and cultural centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title = David Belt - One Thing Leads to Another|url = https://vimeo.com/91425413|accessdate = 2015-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==
Although Macro Sea is often dubbed a "creative" company in news coverage, Belt, the firm's managing principal and founder, has tended to disagree with this description. In a recent interview he argued: "I think all developers should care about design. I’ve met super creative people in business, in law, in government, and the idea that artists have the only right to be creative is becoming less prevalent as the field of design and design impact becomes more ubiquitous in the business world."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Innovator: Interview with David Belt of Macro Sea {{!}} Artinfo|url = http://uk.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/1231264/the-innovator-interview-with-david-belt-of-macro-sea#|accessdate = 2015-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the firm's official website, Macro Sea's mission is to: "pursue projects we find interesting."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Macro Sea — About|url = http://macro-sea.com/about/|website = macro-sea.com|accessdate = 2015-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a recent lecture introduction at the [[University of Michigan]]'s [[Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning]], Venezuelan architect [[Mónica Ponce de León]], described Macro Sea as a development firm that "draws on a multi-disciplinary approach...to create real estate projects that make money, look good, and have meaning," that transforms "underused objects and areas into covetable destinations." &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title = David Belt - One Thing Leads to Another|url = https://vimeo.com/91425413|accessdate = 2015-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Organizationally, Macro Sea is unique in that it exists as a series of ongoing collaborations between experts in a wide variety of disciplines including lawyers, artists, architects, designers and others. The company has served as the entrepreneurial framework for most of Belt's development pursuits since 2009.

Early collaborators included Jocko Weyland (2009-2011), Alix Feinkind (2009-2012), Elise DeChard (2011–2013), and Alexandra Escamilla (2012-2014). Currently the firm is composed of Belt, Rebecca Birmingham who serves as Creative Director and General Counsel (2010–present), Nicko Elliott as Design Director (2013–present), Liz Song as Designer and Project Manager (2015–present), Studio Director Stephanie Hemshrot (2014–present), and Special Projects Coordinator Allison Moss (2016-present).

==Notable projects==

=== New Lab ===
[[File:NewLabBrooklynNavyYardRendering.jpg|thumb|Front view artist's rendering of New Lab. Building 128 of the Brooklyn Navy Yard]]
The result of a public-private partnership with the City of [[New York City|New Yor]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;k, [[New Lab]] is a repurposing of Building 128 in the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]], which was a boiler and machine shop for shipmaking during most of the last century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = History  : BROOKLYN NAVY YARD DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION|url = http://brooklynnavyyard.org/the-navy-yard/history/|website = brooklynnavyyard.org|accessdate = 2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It serves as a design and new manufacturing facility for companies and individuals creating products and hardware, many of which use [[additive manufacturing]] technologies. New Lab opened in June 2016 and has received substantial recent coverage in the media because of its significant role in attracting new industry back to the once dormant [[Brooklyn Navy Yard|Navy Yard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Brooklyn Navy Yard Is Home to Manufacturing Cooperative|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/nyregion/brooklyn-navy-yard-is-home-to-manufacturing-cooperative.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2013-05-08|access-date = 2015-10-01|issn = 0362-4331|first = Patrick|last = Mcgeehan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = From Relic to Beacon: Brooklyn Navy Yard Gets New Life as Cutting-Edge Manufacturing Hub|url = http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/231905|accessdate = 2015-10-01|first = Catherine|last = Clifford}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A Manufacturing Renaissance at the Brooklyn Navy Yard|url = http://www.thirteen.org/metrofocus/2012/08/a-manufacturing-renaissance-at-the-brooklyn-navy-yard/|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Design Brooklyn|url = http://design-brooklyn.tumblr.com/|website = Design Brooklyn|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major goal of the project is to provide an environment that fosters designers, engineers, and entrepreneurs who are hardware and product focused and allow them the ability to consult with one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Brooklyn Navy Yard Is Home to Manufacturing Cooperative|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/nyregion/brooklyn-navy-yard-is-home-to-manufacturing-cooperative.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2013-05-08|access-date = 2015-10-02|issn = 0362-4331|first = Patrick|last = Mcgeehan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 84,000 sq. ft. structure provides an interdisciplinary setting for companies and individuals working in product design, material science, biology, industrial design, and physical computing. New Lab's initial members included [[Honeybee Robotics]], [[Matthew Putman (scientist)|Nanotronics Imaging]], 10x Beta, Spuni, RockPaperRobot, [[Terreform ONE]], The Living, D.N.I., Eco Systems, NEA Studio, Jenna Spevack Studio, The Extrapolation Factory, Eric Forman Studio, Zago, and Itemology. Strongarm Technologies, Voltaic Systems, Farmshelf, and Waverly Labs are more recent additions to the roster. 

=== G27 Global Institute ===
[[File:MacroSeaG27BerlinGlobalInstituteExterior.jpg|left|thumb|Exterior of G27 Global Institute]]

Located in the historic Kreuzberg neighborhood in [[Berlin|Berlin, Germany]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Macro Sea: G27|url = http://www.domusweb.it/en/architecture/2015/09/01/macro_sea_g27.html|website = domusweb.it|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; G27 Global Institute is a "design-centric"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = G27 CIEE Global Institute / Macro Sea|url = http://www.archdaily.com/772841/g27-ciee-global-institute-macro-sea|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; residence&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = G27 Academic Campus &amp; Student Housing  DBI Projects|url = http://projects.dbinyc.com/g27-academic-campus-student-housing/|website = projects.dbinyc.com|accessdate = 2015-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; for study-abroad students. The project confronts the current design paradigm of student housing as it is, according to Belt, "one of the most overlooked and under-explored design disciplines. At its best, it's institutional and sterile and at its worst is confined to dilapidated couches and condescending amenities."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Innovator: Interview with David Belt of Macro Sea {{!}} Artinfo|url = http://uk.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/1231264/the-innovator-interview-with-david-belt-of-macro-sea#|accessdate = 2015-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent article in Slate magazine said the project was indicative of a major paradigm shift in student housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Berlin’s New Stylish Student Housing Doesn’t Look Anything Like Standard Dingy Dorms|url = http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_eye/2015/09/22/g27_global_institute_from_macro_sea_and_ciee_are_stylish_digs_for_study.html|newspaper = Slate|date = 2015-09-22|access-date = 2015-10-03|issn = 1091-2339|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In line with Macro Sea's theme of finding buildings that have a history with which a forthcoming project will resonate, the firm identified the former Roka manufacturing complex in Berlin.

In order to realize their vision, Macro Sea and sister firm DBI Projects completely gutted and renovated the 85,000 sq. ft. complex and courtyard. Roka's facility would be transformed into "a five-story front building located at 27 Gneisenaustrasse, home to future administrative offices and faculty apartments, and a large six-story factory building set back from the street and separated by a magnificent tree-lined interior courtyard."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = G27 CIEE Global Institute / Macro Sea|url = http://www.archdaily.com/772841/g27-ciee-global-institute-macro-sea|accessdate = 2015-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:MacroSeaG27BerlinGobalInstituteInterior.jpg|thumb|G27 Global Institute interior]]

Macro Sea conceived G27 "as a veritable vertical campus, meaning that spaces for living, academic classes, dining and socializing are configured in a vertical fashion, creating a campus within a building."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Innovator: Interview with David Belt of Macro Sea {{!}} Artinfo|url = http://uk.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/1231264/the-innovator-interview-with-david-belt-of-macro-sea#|accessdate = 2015-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interior of G27 consists of contemporary, custom-made and vintage furniture of Bavarian and Danish origin. Many of the furnishings are repurposed local items and salvaged objects from the original facility. From a design perspective G27 is laid out to encourage interaction between students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Macro Sea: G27|url = http://www.domusweb.it/en/architecture/2015/09/01/macro_sea_g27.html|website = domusweb.it|accessdate = 2015-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campus orients around an open common room that contains a large fireplace and a marble bar and cafe. The residential portion of the building will house 200 people and the rooms and bathrooms are customizable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = An Old Factory Becomes Germany's College Housing of the Future {{!}} The Creators Project|url = http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/an-old-factory-becomes-germanys-college-housing-of-the-future|accessdate = 2015-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; G27 opened for the Fall 2015 semester and has been leased to the [[Council on international educational exchange|Council on International Educational Exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = G27 CIEE Global Institute / Macro Sea|url = http://www.archdaily.com/772841/g27-ciee-global-institute-macro-sea|accessdate = 2015-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Glassphemy! ===

Glassphemy! is a "psychological recycling experiment" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/12/arts/design/12glass.html?_r=0|title = The New York Times|last = Ryzik|first = Melena|date = 11 May 2010|work = |access-date = 24 September 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; devised by Macro Sea in 2010 as a way to incite the public to rethink contemporaneous discourses around recycling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = GLASSPHEMY! (Macro Sea)|url = http://designandviolence.moma.org/glassphemy-macro-sea/|accessdate = 2015-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was set up in a private space in [[Gowanus, Brooklyn]], as a 20' x 30' steel and bulletproof glass structure provided a means to "make recycling a more direct, visceral experience and to purge some New York aggression simultaneously."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Eco-Friendly Aggression at David Belt’s Glassphemy!|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/12/arts/design/12glass.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2010-05-11|access-date = 2015-10-02|issn = 0362-4331|first = Melena|last = Ryzik}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants were afforded the opportunity to throw glass bottles at one another without harm. Standing at one end of a raised platform those involved could hurl their bottles at people standing or walking by on the lower opposite platform, but with the protection of the bulletproof glass.

Design and installation on the project was the collaborative effort of Vamos Architects, John Wischmann, Paul Maiello, and Jason Krugman. It was made of plexiglass, steel, wood, responsive light installation, and glass bottles. Glassphemy! was featured in the 2013 [[Museum of Modern Art|MoMA]] Design and Violence Exhibition and book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://designandviolence.moma.org/glassphemy-macro-sea/|title = MoMA|date = 4 December 2013|accessdate = 19 September 2015|website = |publisher = |last = Manaugh|first = Geoff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mobile Pools ===
[[File:MacroSeaDumpsterPools2009.JPG|thumb|MacroSeaDumpsterPools2009|left]]
Macro Sea's 2009-2010 mobile pool project, sometimes referred to as the "dumpster pools"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.vice.com/tag/dumpster%20pools%20new%20york|title = Vice|date = August 5, 2015|accessdate = 2015-10-15|website = vice.com|publisher = |last = Smith|first = Jonathan}}&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the first projects the firm undertook and served as a "way to experiment with underused space and materials, repurposing them with urban renewal in mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Macro Sea — Mobile Pools|url = http://macro-sea.com/projects/mobile-pools-2010/#1|website = macro-sea.com|accessdate = 2015-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pools were made from donated dumpsters which were readily available due to the economic downturn at the time. They were cleaned, sealed with plastic liners, and given filtration systems much like those found on above ground pools in other parts of the country. Belt, Jocko Weyland and Alix Feinkind used the idea as a "template for a larger idea: turning eyesore strip malls into artsy community destinations, with Dumpster pools and other indie attractions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Forget the Trash Bag, Bring a Towel to the Dumpster Pools|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/20/arts/design/20pool.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2009-07-19|access-date = 2015-10-03|issn = 0362-4331|first = Melena|last = Ryzik}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the firm had plans to repurpose a strip mall in Atlanta, Georgia, with a similar adaptive aesthetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Forget the Trash Bag, Bring a Towel to the Dumpster Pools|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/20/arts/design/20pool.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2009-07-19|access-date = 2015-10-03|issn = 0362-4331|first = Melena|last = Ryzik}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next year, in 2010, the New York City Mayor’s Office and the Department of Transportation invited Macro Sea to participate in NYC’s Annual Summer Streets event. The pools were set up at the [[Park Avenue Viaduct]], on the east side of Park Avenue between 40th and 41st Streets, for three Saturdays in August 2010. Hundreds of New Yorkers came out to swim over the course of the three weekends. In 2011 the pools were featured in the Venice Biennale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = US Pavilion at Venice Biennale Focuses on Design Actions for Common Good|url = http://inhabitat.com/us-pavilion-at-venice-biennale-will-focus-on-design-actions-for-common-good/|accessdate = 2015-09-25|first = Andrew|last = Goodwin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Morton Allport''' [[Linnaean Society|FLS]] (4 December 1830 – 10 September 1878) was an English-born Australian colonial naturalist.

Allport was born to Joseph and [[Mary Morton Allport|Mary Morton]] Allport, at [[West Bromwich]], Staffordshire. His family moved in 1831 to [[Tasmania]]. He trained for law, his father's profession, and was admitted as a solicitor of the Supreme Court of Tasmania in 1852.&lt;ref name=AE /&gt;&lt;ref name=Australasia&gt;{{Cite Australasia|Allport, Morton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allport was an ardent and accomplished naturalist, and by his original work added largely to the knowledge of the zoology and botany of Tasmania. To the study of the fishes of the colony he gave special attention, and he made it his concern to send specimens of every new [[fish]] he could procure to the best authorities of [[England]] and elsewhere. He was an authority on [[Tasmania]]n [[fish]] and catalogued, described and drew pictures of his specimens. He was a leader in the introduction of [[salmon]] and [[trout]] to Tasmanian waters and also introduced the [[Nymphaea alba|white water-lily]] and the [[perch]].&lt;ref name=AE&gt;''Australian Encyclopædia'' (1912 - third edition revised 1927) published by Angus &amp; Robertson Limited, 89 Castlereagh Street, Sydney New South Wales (page 52)&lt;/ref&gt;

Allport was a Fellow of the Linnæan Society of London and of the Zoological Society, corresponding member of the Anthropological Institute, life member of the Entomological and Malacological Societies, and foreign member of several Continental scientific societies. He was a Vice-President of the Royal Society of Tasmania, to the Proceedings of which last-named Society he contributed a number of valuable pacers on the subjects of his favourite studies. He was a member of the Council of Education for many years. He died at Hobart on 10 September 1878.&lt;ref name=Australasia /&gt;

'''''Moses Leaving for Egypt''''' is a fresco by the Italian Renaissance painter [[Pietro Perugino]] and his workshop,  executed around 1482 and located in the [[Sistine Chapel]], [[Rome]].

==History==
The commission of the work originated in 1480, when Perugino was decorating a chapel in the [[Old St. Peter's Basilica]] in [[Rome]]. [[Pope Sixtus IV]] was pleased by his work, and decided to commission him also the decoration of the new Chapel he had built in the Vatican Palace. Due to the size of the work, Perugino was later joined by a group of painters from Florence, including [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio|Ghirlandaio]] and others.
[[File:Perugino, Viaggio di Mosè in Egitto 05.jpg|left|thumb|230px|Detail.]]
Perugino's assistants in the Sistine Chapel included [[Pinturicchio]]. Some  figures in the fresco were traditionally attributed to him, but this has been disputed by 20th-century art historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Filippo|last=Todini|title=La Pittura Umbra|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were  painted by [[Andrea d'Assisi]], Rocco Zoppo or, less likely, [[Lo Spagna]] or [[Bartolomeo della Gatta]], other Perugino's collaborators of the time.

==Description==
The fresco depicting the voyage of [[Moses]] is the first on the wall right to the altar, and faces the ''[[Baptism of Christ (Sistine Chapel)|Baptism of Christ]]'' on the opposite wall. 

The painting shows Moses (dressing in yellow and green as in the other frescoes of the cycle) leaving for Egypt, after he had been exiled from [[Midian]], with [[Zipporah]] to his right. In the center, an angel asks him to circumcise his son [[Eliezer]] (scene on the right), as a sign of the alliance between [[Yahweh]] and the [[Israelites]]. The baptism, depicted on the opposite fresco, was in fact considered by several early Christian writers, including [[Augustine]], as a kind of "spiritual circumcision". The ceremony is on the right, and includes Zipporah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harwood|first1=Edith|title=Notable pictures in Rome|date=1907|publisher=J.M. Dent|page=6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KIwZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA6|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the right background [[Moses]] and Zipporah are greeting [[Jethro (Bible)|Jethro]] before leaving. Natural elements include the hill landscape in the background, characterized by thin trees (including a palm, a symbol of Christian sacrifice), and the birds: two of them are mating, an allusion to the renovations cycles of the nature. On the left background is a group of shepherds. The dames with flying dresses were a common element of Florentine early Renaissance painting, used also by [[Domenico Ghirlandaio|Ghirlandaio]] and [[Botticelli]].

The '''National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Tamil''' is one of the [[National Film Awards]] presented annually by the [[Directorate of Film Festivals]], the organisation set up by [[Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (India)|Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, India]].

The [[National Film Awards]], established in 1954, are the most prominent film awards in India that merit the best of the [[Indian cinema]]. The ceremony also presents awards for films in various [[Languages of India|regional languages]].

Three awards of "President's Silver Medal for Best Feature Film", "Certificate of Merit for the Second Best Feature Film" and "Certificate of Merit for the Third Best Feature Film" were instituted. The later two certificate awards were discontinued from [[15th National Film Awards]] (1967).

The 1954 film, directed by [[S. M. Sriramulu Naidu]], ''[[Malaikkallan]]'' was honoured with the first president's Silver Medal for Best Feature Film in Tamil.

A '''nefesh''' (plural: ''nefashot'') is a [[Semitic people|Semitic]] monument placed near a grave so as to be seen from afar.

==Nabataea==

[[File:Obelisk Tomb and Triclinium.jpg|thumb|alt=Several nepheshes can be seen on this tomb.|Obelisk Tomb and Bab el-Siq Triclinium, [[Petra]], [[Jordan]].]]
[[File:Nefesh at Petra, Jordan.JPG|thumb|Carving of a Nefesh on the rock face near Tomb 70, Petra]]
In a Nabataean [[votive]] [[inscription]] from [[Salkhad]], an [[Aramaic]] heap of stones set up in memorial is described as "for [[Allat]] and her ''wgr''", a term equated to the [[Hasaitic]] ''nephesh''. In [[Sabeans|Sabean]], this term could mean a [[tumulus]] above a tomb, while in [[Arabic]] this term could indicate a grotto or a tomb.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Wenning, “The Betyls of Petra,”Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research, No.324. Nabataean Petra (Nov., 2001),83&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''nephesh'' is also linked to the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''[[stele]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Bert de Vries, "'Be of good cheer!No one on earth is immortal':Religious Symbolism in Tomb Architecture and Epitaphs at the Umm el-Jimal and Tall Hisban Cemeteries,"in Douglas R. Clark et al, ed. ''The Madaba Plains Project: Forty Years of Archaeological Research in Jordan's Past.'' Equinox, 2011 803-805&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[Aniconism|aniconic]] culture, the Nabataean representation of deities lacked figural imagery. Related to betyls, ''nepheshes'' served as aniconic [[memorial]] markers for the dead. Unlike the [[Israelites|Israelite]] prohibition of the graven image, Nabataean aniconism allows [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] representation of deities but demonstrates a preference for non- figural imagery. [[Baetylus|Betyls]] are one form of Nabataean aniconic sculpture. Often explained as representations of [[Dushara]], the central Nabataean deity, betyls occur in a wide variety of shapes, groupings, and niches. This variety suggests that betyls may be representative of other deities as well.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Wenning, “The Betyls of Petra,”Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research, No.324. Nabataean Petra (Nov., 2001), 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nabataean ''nephesh'' is a standing stone, [[obelisk]]oid in shape, often featuring a blossom/pinecone or stylized crown on the top. Roughly carved or engraved in [[bas-relief]], these structures are often set upon a base that bears the name of the deceased. Occurring outside and inside tombs,some are engraved near or in votive niches.However, many ''nepheseshes'' can be found unconnected from tombs, and many line the paths to [[Petra]] or along other protruding rock faces such as those of the [[Siq]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Wenning, “The Betyls of Petra,”Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research, No.324. Nabataean Petra (Nov., 2001),87-88&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this type of funerary marker can be found in the Obelisk Tomb and Bab el-Siq Triclinium, [[Petra]], [[Jordan]].

==Jerusalem==

Some examples of monumental funerary sculpture near Jerusalem bear inscriptions that include the term ''nephesh'', and the word is generally accepted as a reference to the pyramid structure above or beside the tomb.&lt;ref&gt;Joe Zias and Emile Puech, "The Tomb of Absalom Reconsidered," ''NearEastern Archeology',Wol.c68, No. 4 (Dec.,2005), 157&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tomb of Absalom===

[[File:Tomb of Avshalom in the Kidron Valley;.jpg|thumb|[[Yad Avshalom]] in Kidron Valley]]
Standing among a group of tombs in [[Jerusalem]], the [[tomb of Absalom]] is an important example of [[Second Temple period|Late Second Temple]] funerary architecture. To the lower left of the entrance to the tomb, the word ''nephesh'' is inscribed in Greek. In this context, the Greek ''nephesh'' is translated as two Hebrew-Aramaic words as ''nephesh'' and ''qubr,'' now interpreted as an amalgam of "tomb" and "stele." The carved rock is thus a memorial that evokes the essence or spirit of the deceased.&lt;ref&gt;Joe Zias and Emile Puech, "The Tomb of Absalom Reconsidered," ''NearEastern Archeology',Wol.c68, No. 4 (Dec.,2005), 157&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jason's Tomb===

Dated to the first century BCE, [[Jason's Tomb]] bears an Aramaic inscription that states: "because I built for you a tomb (''nephesh'') and a memorial (''qubr''), be in peace in Jer[u]sa[le]m."&lt;ref&gt;Emile Puech,"Inscriptions funeraires pelestiniennes:tombeau de Jason et ossuaires.''Revue biblique'' 1983. 90:481-533&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tomb of Benei Hezir===

The [[Tomb of Benei Hezir]] also bears an epithet in Hebrew that states: "This is the tomb and the stele/memorial (''nephesh'') of [[Eleazar]]...".&lt;ref&gt;N. Avigad. ''Ancient Monuments in the Kidron Valley.'' Jerusalem:Israel Exploration Society. 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8136">[[File:Self-portrait of John Duncan Fergusson.jpg|thumb|Self portrait of leading figure in the Group [[John Duncan Fergusson]] in 1902]]
The '''New Scottish Group''' was a loose collection of artists based in Glasgow, who exhibited from 1942 to 1956. It was formed around [[John Duncan Fergusson]] after his return to Glasgow in 1939. It had its origins in the New Art Club formed in 1940, and had its first exhibition in 1942. Members did not have a common style, but shared left-wing views and were influenced by contemporary continental art. Members included Donald Bain, William Crosbie, Marie de Banzie and Isabel Babianska. Tom MacDonald, [[Bet Low]] and William Senior formed the '''Clyde Group''' to pursue political painting that manifested in urban industrial landscapes. The group helped start the careers of a generation of Glasgow-based artists and was part of a wider cultural "golden age" for the city.

==History==
[[John Duncan Fergusson]] (1874–1961), who was the longest surviving of the group of artists known as the [[Scottish Colourists]], had settled in France, but returned to Scotland in 1939, just before the outbreak of the Second World War, with his wife, the dancer and choreographer [[Margaret Morris (dancer)|Margaret Morris]] (1891–1980). There he became a leading figure of a group of younger Glasgow artists. Members of Fergusson's group formed the New Art Club in 1940, in opposition to the established [[Glasgow Art Club]]. In 1942 they held the first of what would be a series of shows of their own exhibiting society, the New Scottish Group, with Fergusson as its first president. The introduction to the catalogue of their first show was written by novelist and poet [[Naomi Mitchison]] (1897–1999).&lt;ref name="Macmillan2001p80"&gt;D. Macmillan, ''Scottish Art in the 20th century, 1890–2001'' (Mainstream, 2001), {{ISBN|1840184574}}, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; The group held annual exhibitions in the period 1943–48, and larger shows in 1951 and 1956.&lt;ref name="FergussonGalleryp14"&gt;J. Kinnear, [https://web.archive.org/web/20141218180510/http://www.pkc.gov.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=829&amp;p=0 ''The Fergusson Gallery''] (Perth Museum &amp; Art Gallery, 2005), {{ISBN|0-907495-25-7}}, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Important to the artists was the nationalist and left-wing publisher William MacLellan, who produced a number of works of Glasgow artists in the 1940s, including Fergusson's book ''Modern Scottish Painting'' (1943), which expressed his anti-academic and democratic ideals and his desire to form a British equivalent to the French [[Société des Artistes Indépendants|Salon des Indépendants]].&lt;ref name=Macmillan1990pp369-71/&gt; Members of the group were involved in two of MacLellan's magazines in this period, supplying visual material or ''Poetry Scotland'' (1943–49) and ''Scottish Art and Letters'' (1944–50), which played an important part in disseminating ideas of the [[Scottish Renaissance]]. Fergusson designed the covers for ''Scottish Art and Letters'' and acted as its artistic director.&lt;ref&gt;M. Palmer McCulloch, "Continuing the Renaissance: little magazines and a late phase of Scottish Modernism in the 1940s", ''Etudes Ecossaises'', 15 (2012), ISSN 1240-1439, pp. 59–73.&lt;/ref&gt; Fergusson also illustrated MacLellan's edition of by [[Hugh MacDiarmid]]'s ''[[In Memoriam James Joyce]]'' (1955) and his paintings from this period included ''Danu mother of the Gods'', both of which combined elements of Celtic culture and modernism.&lt;ref name="Koch2006p112"&gt;J. T. Koch, ed., ''Celtic Culture: a Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 2'' (ABC-CLIO, 2006), {{ISBN|1851094407}}, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; In their last exhibition in 1956 the group displayed with another organisation, the Society of Scottish Independent Artists, a title that recalled Fergusson's ambition. Fergusson died in 1961.&lt;ref name=Macmillan2001p80/&gt;

==Members==
The group had no single style, but shared left-wing tendencies and included artists strongly influenced by trends in contemporary continental art. Painters involved included Donald Bain (1904–79), whose work was often crowded with rich colour and heavily worked paint, as in his ''The Striped Vase'' (1943), which was influenced by [[expressionism]].  William Crosbie (1915–99) was strongly influenced by [[surrealism]],&lt;ref name=Macmillan1990pp369-71/&gt; which can be seen in his ''Heart Knife'' (1934), an early example of a Scottish artist using the semi-abstract style derived from [[cubism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgalleries.org/collection/artists-a-z/C/3020/artist_name/William%20Crosbie/record_id/2064 "William Crosbie, Heart Knife, 1934], ''National Galleries Scotland'', retrieved 16 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Margaret Oliver Brown]] (1912–90) was known for her portraiture.&lt;ref&gt;A. Strang, ''Modern Scottish Women: Painters and Sculptors 1885-1965'' (Edinburgh: National Galleries of Scotland, 2015), {{ISBN|978-1-906270-89-6}}, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Marie de Banzie (1918–90) was influenced by expressionism and particularity the [[post-expressionism|post-expressionist]] work of [[Gauguin]], as can be seen in her 1945 painting ''Shadow'', which borrows from his Haitian pictures. Isabel Babianska (b. 1920), who had trained with de Banzie at the [[Glasgow School of Art]], was influenced by expressionist [[Chaim Soutine]], as can be seen in the collection of grotesque faces in her painting ''Fiesta'' (1943). Expressionism can also be seen as an influence on the work of Millie Frood (1900–88), in dislocated landscapes such as ''October'' (1946) and ''Turning Hay'', which included vivid colours and brushwork reminiscent of [[Van Gogh]]. Frood's urban scenes contain an element of social commentary and realism, influenced by Polish refugees [[Josef Herman]] (1911–2000), resident in Glasgow between 1940 and 1943&lt;ref name="Macmillan1990pp369-71"&gt;D. Macmillan, ''Scottish Art, 1460–1990'' (Mainstream, 1990), {{ISBN|1851582517}}, pp. 369–71.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jankel Adler]] (1895–1949), who was based in [[Kirkudbright]] from 1941–43.&lt;ref&gt;M. MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), {{ISBN|0500203334}}, p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; Also influenced by Herman were husband and wife Tom MacDonald (1914–85) and  [[Bet Low]] (1924–2007), who with painter William Senior (b. 1927) formed the Clyde Group, aimed at promoting political art. Their work included industrial and urban landscapes such as MacDonald's ''Transport Depot'' (1944–45) and Bet Low's ''Blochairn Steelworks'' (c. 1946).&lt;ref name=Macmillan1990pp369-71/&gt;

==Significance==
The New Scottish Group helped launch the careers of a number of young artists.&lt;ref name=FergussonGalleryp14/&gt; It was also part of a cultural "golden age" for Glasgow, that included dance, theatre, literature and architecture.&lt;ref name=Macmillan1990pp369-71/&gt; This included Margaret Morris' foundation of a professional dance troop, Celtic Ballet, in 1947, which combined traditional Scottish and classical dance.&lt;ref name=Koch2006p112/&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''''Oni'''''|鬼|}} are a kind of ''[[yōkai]]'', supernatural demon, devils, [[ogre]], or [[troll]] in [[Japanese folklore]]. They are typically portrayed as hulking figures with one or more horns growing out of their heads. Stereotypically, they are conceived of as red or blue-colored (green-colored), wearing [[loincloths]] of [[tiger]] [[pelt]], and carrying iron clubs.

They are popular characters in [[Japanese art]], [[Japanese literature|literature]], and [[Theatre of Japan|theatre]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X0ntg_EzA0kC&amp;pg=PA242 |title=Reading the literatures of Asian America |first1=Shirley |last1=Lim|first2=Amy |last2=Ling|publisher=Temole University Press|year=1992|page=242|isbn=978-0-87722-935-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and appear as [[Stock character|stock villains]] in the well-known fairytales of ''[[Momotaro]]'' (''Peach Boy''), ''[[Issun-bōshi]]'', and ''[[Kobutori Jisan|Kobutori Jīsan]]''.

==Description==

Depictions of ''oni'' vary widely but usually portray them as hideous, gigantic ogre-like creatures with a single horn or multiple horns emerging from their heads,{{sfnp|Reider|2003|p=135}} with sharp [[claw]]s and wild hair.&lt;ref name="Mack"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1IDS3UUrqAIC&amp;pg=PA116 |title=A Field Guide to Demons, Fairies, Fallen Angels, and Other Subversive Spirits |first1=Carol |last1=Mack |first2=Dinah |last2=Mack|publisher=Arcade Publishing|page=116|year=1998|isbn=978-1-55970-447-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are often depicted wearing [[tiger]]-skin [[loincloth]]s and carrying iron clubs called {{Nihongo|''[[kanabō]]''|金棒|}}.{{sfnp|Reider|2003|p=135}} This image leads to the expression {{Nihongo|"oni with an iron club"|鬼に金棒|oni-ni-kanabō}}, that is, to be invincible or undefeatable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_oFqBqj4HVAC&amp;pg=PA168 |title=Evil in Our Midst: A Chilling Glimpse of Our Most Feared and Frightening Demons |first=David E. |last=Jones|publisher=[[Square One Publishers]]|page=168|year=2002|isbn=978-0-7570-0009-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=buchanan&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wGb4zNqYj10C&amp;pg=PA136 |title=Japanese Proverbs and Sayings|first=Daniel Crump |last=Buchanan |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|year=1965|page=136|isbn=978-0-8061-1082-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their skin may be any number of colors, but red, blue, and green are particularly common.&lt;ref name="Hackin"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0ECwJUcn1_UC&amp;pg=PA443 |title=Asiatic Mythology 1932 |first1=J.| last1=Hackin|first2=Paul Louis |last2=Couchoud|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|page=443|year=2005|isbn=978-1-4179-7695-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Turne"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jEcpkWjYOZQC&amp;pg=PA363 |title=Dictionary of ancient deities|first1=Patricia |last1=Turne|first2=Charles Russell |last2=Coulter|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2000|page=363|isbn=978-0-19-514504-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may sometimes also be depicted as black-skinned, or yellow-skinned.{{sfnp|Reider|2003|p=135}}

They may occasionally be depicted with a third eye on their forehead,{{sfnp|Reider|2003|p=135}}&lt;ref name="Bush"/&gt; or extra fingers and toes.&lt;ref name="Bush"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lesg5YSXckQC&amp;pg=PA141 |title=Asian horror encyclopedia: Asian horror culture in literature, manga and folklore |first=Laurence C. |last=Bush|publisher=Writers Club Press|page=141|year=2001|isbn=978-0-595-20181-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==

An old etymology for "''oni''" is that the word derives from ''on'', the [[Kanji#On'yomi (Chinese reading)|''on'yomi'' reading]] of a character ({{lang|ja|{{linktext|隠}}}}) meaning "to hide or conceal", due to ''oni'' having the tendency of "hiding behind things, not wishing to appear". This explanation is found in the 10th century dictionary ''[[Wamyō Ruijushō|Wamyōshō]]'', which reveals that the ''oni'' at the time had a different meaning, defined as "a soul/spirit of the dead".{{sfnp|Reider|2003|pp=134–135}}&lt;ref name="kuki"/&gt;

The character for ''oni'', 鬼 ({{zh|p=guǐ|j=gwai&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}) in Chinese also means a dead or ancestral spirit, and not necessarily an evil specter.{{sfnp|Reider|2003|pp=134–135}} Accordingly, Chinese ([[Taoism|Taoist]]) origins for the concept of ''oni'' has been proposed by {{illm|Takahashi Masaaki|ja|高橋昌明}}.&lt;ref&gt;Takahashi (1972) ''Shutendoji no tanjo: mou hitotsu no Nihon bunka'' 酒呑童子の誕生: もうひとつの日本文化, p. 41, cited in {{harvp||Reider|2003|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''oni'' was [[syncretism|syncretized]] with [[Hinduism|Hindu]]-[[Buddhism|Buddhist]] creatures such as the man-devouring ''[[yaksha]]'' and the ''[[rakshasa]]'', and became the ''oni'' who tormented sinners as wardens of [[Di Yu|Jigoku]] (Hell),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Reider|2016|pp=10–11}}, {{harvp|Reider|2016|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; administering sentences passed down by Hell's magistrate, King [[Yama]] (Enma Daiō).&lt;ref name="Hackin"/&gt; The [[hungry ghost]]s called {{nihongo|''[[Preta|gaki]]''|餓鬼}} has also been sometimes considered a type of ''oni'' (the letter "ki" 鬼 is also read "oni").&lt;ref name="Hackin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kuki"/&gt;

Some scholars have even argued that the ''oni'' was entirely a concept of Buddhist mythology.&lt;ref&gt;Anesaki &amp; Ferguson (1928), ''The Mythology of all Races'', p. 280, cited by {{harvp|Reider|2003|p=314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SekienOni.jpg|thumb|Oni depicted in ''[[Konjaku Gazu Zoku Hyakki]]'' by [[Toriyama Sekien]].]]
[[File:Oni.jpg|thumb|A statue of a red oni wielding a [[kanabō]].]]

According to Chinese Taoism and esoteric [[Onmyōdō]], the ways of [[yin and yang]], the [[northeast|northeasterly]] direction is termed the ''kimon'' ([[:ja:鬼門|鬼門]], "demon gate") and considered an unlucky direction through which evil spirits passed. Based on the assignment of the [[Chinese zodiac#The twelve animals|twelve zodiac animals]] to the cardinal directions, the ''kimon'' was also known as the ''ushitora'' (丑寅), or "[[Ox (zodiac)|Ox]] [[Tiger (zodiac)|Tiger]]" direction. One theory is that the ''oni''{{'}}s bovine horns and tiger-skin loincloth developed as a visual depiction of this term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EEQlVC_clo8C&amp;pg=PA611 |title=Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics |volume=Part 8|first=James |last=Hastings|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|page=611|year=2003|isbn=978-0-7661-3678-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Reider|2010|p=7}}{{sfnp|Foster|2015|p=119}}

[[Temple]]s are often built facing that direction, for example, [[Enryaku-ji]] was deliberately built on  [[Mount Hiei]] which was in the ''kimon'' (northeasterly) direction from [[Kyoto]] in order to guard the capital, and similarly [[Kaneiji|Kan'ei-ji]] was built towards that direction from [[Edo Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Havens |first=Norman |last2=Inoue |first2=Nobutaka |title=Konjin |encyclopedia=An Encyclopedia of Shinto (Shinto Jiten): Kami |publisher=Institute for Japanese Culture and Classics Kokugakuin University |year=2006 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a_YQAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Enryakuji+northeast |page=98|isbn=9784905853084 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Kan'ei-ji |encyclopedia=Japan Encyclopedia |first=Louis |last=Frédéric |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC&amp;q=Kan'ei-ji&amp;pg=PA480 |publisher=President and Fellows of Harvard College |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-674-00770-3 |page=468}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, skeptics doubt this could have been the initial design of Enryaku-ji temple, since the temple was founded in 788, six years before Kyoto even existed as a capital,&lt;!--The spot where Kyoto was built was called Kadono-gun in Yamashiro-no-kuni--&gt; and if the ruling class were so [[feng shui]] minded, the subsequent northeasterly move of the capital from [[Nagaoka-kyō]] to Kyoto would have certainly been taboo.&lt;ref&gt;Huang Yung-jing 黄永融 (1993), master's thesis, "''Fūsui shisō ni okeru gensokusei kara mita Heiankyō wo chūshin to suru Nihon kodai kyūto keikaku no bunseki'' 風水思想における原則性から見た平安京を中心とする日本古代宮都計画の分析",  Kyoto Prefectural University, The Graduate School of Human Life Science. Cited by {{cite book|last=Yamada |first=Yasuhiko&lt;!--山田安彦--&gt; |title=Hōi to Fūdo |script-title=方位と風土 |publisher=Kokin Shoin &lt;!--古今書院--&gt;|year=1994 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=STshAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%E9%95%B7%E5%B2%A1%E4%BA%AC+%E9%AC%BC%E9%96%80 |page=201}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, Japanese buildings may sometimes have L-shaped indentions at the northeast to ward oni away, for example the walls surrounding the [[Kyoto Imperial Palace]] have notched corners in that direction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parry  |first=Richard Lloyd |author-link=Richard Lloyd Parry |title=Tokyo, Kyoto &amp; ancient Nara |publisher=Cadogan Guides |year=1999 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=afQwAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=notch+corner+northeast|page=246}}: "the walls of the Imperial Palace have a notch in their top-right hand corner to confuse the evil spirits".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional culture==
The traditional bean-throwing custom to drive out ''oni'' is practiced during [[Setsubun]] festival in February. It involves people casting roasted [[soybean]]s indoors or out of their homes and shouting {{Nihongo|"''Oni wa soto! Fuku wa uchi!''"|"鬼は外！福は内！"||"Oni go out! Blessings come in!"}}.{{sfnp|Foster|2015|p=125}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T2blg2Kw_zcC&amp;pg=PP17 |title=Introduction to Japanese culture | first=Daniel |last=Sosnoski|publisher=Charles E. Tuttle Publishing|page=9|year=1966|isbn=978-0-8048-2056-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This custom has grown from the medieval ritual of ''[[tsuina]]'' (Chinese: ''[[Nuo folk religion|nuo]]'') or ''oni-yarai'', an year-end rite to drive away ''oni'' (ghosts).{{sfnp|Foster|2015|p=125}}&lt;ref name=hearn-glimpses/&gt;

Regionally around [[Tottori Prefecture]]&lt;!--因伯地方は柊 (Inaba and Hoki Provinces)--&gt; during this season, a charm made of [[holly]]-leaves and dried sardine heads are used as guard against oni.&lt;ref name=hearn-glimpses/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ema |first=Tsutomu &lt;!--江馬務--&gt;|title=Ema Tsutomu zenshū |volume=8 |page=412 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WWwNAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%E6%9F%8A%E9%B0%AF+%E5%9C%B0%E6%96%B9}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There is also a well known game in Japan called {{Nihongo|''oni gokko''|鬼ごっこ}}, which is the same as the game of [[tag (game)|tag]] that children in western countries play. The player who is "it" is instead called the "oni".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eOlQJauoRAEC&amp;pg=PA41 |title=Information Networking: Wired communications and management |first=Ilyoung |last=Chong|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=2002|page=41|isbn=978-3-540-44256-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Reider|2010|pp=155–156}}&lt;!-- The Japanese [[hide-and-seek]] is called called {{Nihongo|''kakurenbo''|隠れんぼ}}, and the seeker is called the ''oni''. Kakurenbo may be known as {{Nihongo|''kakure oni''|隠れ鬼|literally "hidden oni"}}, recorded by Yanagita Kunio (1977) [https://books.google.com/books?id=AZ3kAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT12] but not really often heard.--&gt; 

Oni are featured in Japanese children's stories such as ''[[Momotaro]]'' (''Peach Boy''), ''[[Issun-bōshi]]'', and ''[[Kobutori Jisan|Kobutori Jīsan]]''.

In more recent times, ''oni'' have lost some of their original wickedness{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} and sometimes take on a more protective function. Men in oni costumes often lead Japanese [[parade]]s to dispel any bad luck, for example.

Japanese buildings sometimes include oni-faced roof tiles called {{Nihongo|''[[onigawara]]''|[[:ja:鬼瓦|鬼瓦]]|}}, which are thought to ward away bad luck, much like [[gargoyle]]s in Western tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SsmN4jxwnfUC&amp;pg=PA21 |page=21 |title=Nihon no ishokujū marugoto jiten |script-title=「日本の衣食住」まるごと事典|last=Toyozaki |first=Yōko |publisher=IBC Publishing |year=2007|isbn=978-4-89684-640-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Japanese idioms and proverbs also make reference to oni. For example, the expression {{Nihongo|''oya ni ninu ko wa oni no ko''|親に似ぬ子は鬼の子}} means literally "a child that does not resemble its parents is the child of an oni", and may be used by a parent to chastise a misbehaving child.&lt;ref name=buchanan/&gt;

The term evokes the related concept of [[open-source software]].&lt;ref name="OpenContent19990128"&gt;{{cite web| last = Wiley| first = David| title = Open Content| work = OpenContent.org| accessdate = 2012-04-17| year = 1998| url = http://www.opencontent.org/home.shtml| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/19990128224600/http://www.opencontent.org/home.shtml| archivedate = 28 January 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such [[content (media)|content]] is said to be under an '''open licence'''.

== History ==
Originally, the Open content [[concept]] was invented by Michael Stutz, who in 1994 wrote the paper "[https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/nonsoftware-copyleft.en.html Applying Copyleft to Non-Software Information]" for the GNU Project. The "Open Content" term was later evangelized via the ''[[Open Content Project]]'' by [[David A. Wiley]] in 1998, and described works licensed under the [[Open Content License]] (a non-free share-alike license, see 'Free content' below) and other works licensed under similar terms.&lt;ref name="OpenContent19990128"/&gt;

It has since come to describe a broader class of content without conventional copyright restrictions. The [[openness]] of content can be assessed under the '5Rs Framework' based on the extent to which it can be reused, revised, remixed and redistributed by members of the public without violating copyright law.&lt;ref name="OpenContentDefinition"&gt;{{cite web | last = Wiley| first = David| title = Open Content| work = OpenContent.org| accessdate = 2011-11-18| url = http://opencontent.org/definition/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[free content]] and content under [[Open-source license|open-source licenses]], there is no clear threshold that a work must reach to qualify as 'open content'.

Although open content has been described as a counterbalance to [[copyright]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apdip.net/publications/fosseprimers/foss-opencontent-nocover.pdf |title=Lawrence Liang, "Free/Open Source Software Open Content", '&amp;#39;Asia-Pacific Development Information Programme: e-Primers on Free/Open Source Software'&amp;#39;, United Nations Development Programme – Asia-Pacific Development Information Programme, 2007. |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; open content licenses rely on a copyright holder's power to license their work, similarly as [[copyleft]] which also utilizes copyright for such a purpose.

In 2003 Wiley announced that the Open Content Project has been succeeded by [[Creative Commons]] and their [[Creative commons license|licenses]], where he joined as "Director of Educational Licenses".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030802222546/http://opencontent.org/ OpenContent is officially closed.

Another successor project is the ''[[Open Knowledge Foundation]]'' (''OKF''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.timdavies.org.uk/2014/04/12/data-information-knowledge-and-power-exploring-open-knowledges-new-core-purpose/|title = Data, information, knowledge and power – exploring Open Knowledge's new core purpose |first = Tim|last = Davies|date = 12 April 2014|work = Tim's Blog|accessdate = 25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; founded by [[Rufus Pollock]] in [[Cambridge]], UK in 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://blog.okfn.org/2004/05/24/open-knowledge-foundation-launched/|title = Open Knowledge Foundation launched|work = Open Knowledge Foundation Weblog|accessdate = 25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a global non-profit network to promote and share open content and data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Open Knowledge: About|url = https://okfn.org/about/|website = okfn.org|accessdate = 25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 the [[Open Knowledge Foundation]] gave an ''Open Knowledge Definition'' for ''"Content such as music, films, books; Data be it scientific, historical, geographic or otherwise; Government and other administrative information"''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070818100846/http://www.opendefinition.org/1.0 version 1.0] on opendefinition.org (archived 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2014 with version 2.0 ''Open Works'' and ''Open Licenses'' were defined and "open" is described as synonymous to the definitions of open/free in the [[Open Source Definition]], the [[Free Software Definition]] and the [[Definition of Free Cultural Works]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://opendefinition.org/od/2.1/en/ Open Definition 2.1] on opendefinition.org&lt;/ref&gt; A distinct difference is the focus given to the [[public domain]] and that it focuses also on the accessibility ("[[open access]]") and the readability ("[[open format]]s"). Among several conformant licenses, six are recommended, three own (Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and Licence (PDDL), Open Data Commons Attribution License (ODC-BY), [[Open Data Commons Open Database License]] (ODbL)) and the [[CC BY]], [[CC BY-SA]], and [[CC0]] creative commons licenses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://opendefinition.org/licenses/ licenses] on opendefintion.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://blog.creativecommons.org/2013/12/27/creative-commons-4-0-by-and-by-sa-licenses-approved-conformant-with-the-open-definition/ Creative Commons 4.0 BY and BY-SA licenses approved conformant with the Open Definition] by Timothy Vollmer on creativecommons.org (27 December 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://blog.creativecommons.org/2014/10/07/open-definition-2-0-released/ Open Definition 2.0 released] by Timothy Vollmer on creativecommons.rog (7 October 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

== "Open content" definition ==

The OpenContent website once defined OpenContent as 'freely available for modification, use and redistribution under a license similar to those used by the open-source / free software community'.&lt;ref name="OpenContent19990128"/&gt; However, such a definition would exclude the [[Open Content License]] (OPL) because that license forbade charging 'a fee for the [OpenContent] itself', a right required by free and open-source software licenses.{{citation needed|reason=The FOSS licences require a right to charge a fee for creating or delivering a copy, not a right to charge for the content itself|date=March 2015}}

The term since shifted in meaning. OpenContent ''"is licensed in a manner that provides users with free and perpetual permission to engage in the 5R activities."''&lt;ref name="OpenContentDefinition"/&gt;

The 5Rs are put forward on the OpenContent website as a framework for assessing the extent to which content is open:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
#Retain – the right to make, own, and control copies of the content (e.g., download, duplicate, store, and manage)
#Reuse – the right to use the content in a wide range of ways (e.g., in a class, in a study group, on a website, in a video)
#Revise – the right to adapt, adjust, modify, or alter the content itself (e.g., translate the content into another language)
#Remix – the right to combine the original or revised content with other open content to create something new (e.g., incorporate the content into a mashup)
#Redistribute – the right to share copies of the original content, your revisions, or your remixes with others (e.g., give a copy of the content to a friend)&lt;ref name="OpenContentDefinition"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This broader definition distinguishes open content from open-source software, since the latter must be available for commercial use by the public. However, it is similar to several definitions for [[open educational resources]], which include resources under noncommercial and verbatim licenses.&lt;ref name="oer-review"&gt;{{Cite conference | publisher = The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation | last = Atkins | first = Daniel E. | author2 = John Seely Brown | author3 = Allen L. Hammond | title = A Review of the Open Educational Resources (OER) Movement: Achievements, Challenges, and New Opportunities | location = Menlo Park, CA | date = February 2007 | accessdate = 2010-12-03 | page = 4 | url = http://www.hewlett.org/uploads/files/Hewlett_OER_report.pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/67UwoyzbR?url=http://www.hewlett.org/uploads/files/Hewlett_OER_report.pdf | archivedate = 8 May 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|first = Guntram|last= Geser |title= Open Educational Practices and Resources.

The later ''[[The Open Definition|Open Definition]]'' by the Open Knowledge Foundation (now known as [[Open Knowledge International]]) define [[open knowledge]] with open content and [[open data]] as sub-elements and draws heavily on the [[Open Source Definition]]; it preserves the limited sense of open content as free content,&lt;ref name="Open Definition"&gt;{{cite web | title = Open Definition| work = OpenDefinition.org| accessdate = 2011-11-18| url = http://opendefinition.org/okd/}}&lt;/ref&gt; unifying both.

==Open access==
[[File:Open Access logo PLoS white.svg|thumb|100px|[[Open access]] logo, originally designed by [[Public Library of Science]]]]
"[[Open access]]" refers to toll-free or [[Gratis versus libre|gratis]] access to content, mainly published originally [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] scholarly journals. Some open access works are also licensed for reuse and redistribution ("libre open access"), which would qualify them as open content.

==Open content and education==
{{further|Open Education Resources}}
[[File:Global_Open_Educational_Resources_Logo.svg|thumb|100px|[[Open Educational Resources]] logo]]
[[File:Ocaheader.jpg|thumb|[[Open Content Alliance]] logo]]
Over the past decade, open content has been used to develop alternative routes towards higher education. Traditional universities are expensive, and their tuition rates are increasing.&lt;ref name="Tuition Inflation" &gt;{{cite web
| last = Kantrowitz| first = Mark| title = Tuition Inflation| work = FinAid.org| accessdate = 2012-04-18| year = 2012| url = http://www.finaid.org/savings/tuition-inflation.phtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; Open content allows a free way of obtaining higher education that is "focused on collective knowledge and the sharing and reuse of learning and scholarly content."&lt;ref name="Horizon Report"&gt;{{cite web| last = NMC| first = | title = One Year or Less: Open Content| work = 2010 Horizon Report| accessdate = 2012-04-18| year = 2012| url = http://wp.nmc.org/horizon2010/chapters/open-content/| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120316120303/http://wp.nmc.org/horizon2010/chapters/open-content/| archivedate = 16 March 2012| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are multiple projects and organizations that promote learning through open content, including [[OpenCourseWare| OpenCourseWare Initiative]], [[The Saylor Foundation]] and [[Khan Academy]]. Some universities, like [[MIT]], [[Yale]], and [[Tufts]] are making their courses freely available on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Textbooks===
{{main|Open textbooks}}
The textbook industry is one of the educational industries in which open content can make the biggest impact.&lt;ref name = "funny monkey"&gt;{{cite web
| last = Fitzgerald| first = Bill| title = Using Open Content To Drive Educational Change| work = Funny Monkey| accessdate = 2012-04-18| year = 2012| url = https://funnymonkey.com/2010/using-open-content-to-drive-educational-change }}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional textbooks, aside from being expensive, can also be inconvenient and out of date, because of publishers' tendency to constantly print new editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Being openly licensed and online can be helpful to teachers, because it allows the textbook to be modified according to the teacher's unique curriculum.&lt;ref name="funny monkey" /&gt; There are multiple organizations promoting the creation of openly licensed textbooks. Some of these organizations and projects include The University of Minnesota's Open Textbook Library, [[OpenStax CNX|Connexions]], [[OpenStax College]], The Saylor Foundation Open Textbook Challenge and [[Wikibooks]]

==Licenses==

According to the current definition of open content on the OpenContent website, any general, royalty-free copyright license would qualify as an open license because it 'provides users with the right to make more kinds of uses than those normally permitted under the law. These permissions are granted to users free of charge.'&lt;ref name="OpenContentDefinition" /&gt;

However, the narrower definition used in the Open Definition effectively limits open content to [[libre content]], any [[free content]] license, defined by the [[Definition of Free Cultural Works]], would qualify as an open content license. According to this narrower criteria, the following still-maintained licenses qualify:

* [[Creative Commons licenses]] (only [[Creative Commons Attribution]], [[CC BY-SA|Attribution-Share Alike]] and [[CC0|Zero]])
* [[Open Publication License]] (the original license of the [[Open Content Project]], the [[Open Content License]], did not permit for-profit copying of the licensed work and therefore does not qualify)
* [[Against DRM license]]
* [[GNU Free Documentation License]] (without invariant sections)
* [[Open Game License]] (a license designed for role-playing games by [[Wizards of the Coast]])
* [[Free Art License]]
(For more licenses see [[Open Knowledge]], [[Free content]] and [[Free Cultural Works]] licenses)

In [[film industry|film]] and [[television]], a '''production designer''' ('''PD''') is the person responsible for the overall visual look of the production. Production designers have a key creative role in the creation of motion pictures and television. Working directly with the [[film director|director]], [[cinematographer]], and [[film producer|producer]], they must select the settings and style to visually tell the story. The term ''production designer'' was coined by [[William Cameron Menzies]] while he was working on the film ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Cairns |first=David |year=2011 |title=The Dreams of a Creative Begetter |url=https://believermag.com/the-dreams-of-a-creative-begetter/ |magazine=The Believer |issue=79 |access-date=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously (and often subsequently) the people with the same responsibilities were called ''[[art director]]s''.{{sfn|Preston|1994|p=150}} It is sometimes also described as ''[[scenic design]]'' or ''set design''.

== Societies and trade organizations ==
In the United States and British Columbia,{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} production designers are represented by the [[International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees]] local 800,{{sfn|Rizzo|2015|p=396}} the Art Directors Guild. The production design credit must be requested by the producer, prior to completion of photography, and submitted to the Art Directors Guild Board of Directors for the credit approval. 
In the rest of Canada, production designers are represented by the [[Director's Guild of Canada]].

[[File:Universidad de Alcala.jpg|thumb|300px|Facade of the [[Colegio Mayor de San Ildefonso]], [[University of Alcalá|University of Alcalá de Henares]], by [[Rodrigo Gil de Hontañón]] (1537–1553).]]
'''Purism''' is an initial phase of [[Architecture of the Spanish Renaissance|Renaissance architecture in Spain]], which took place between 1530 and 1560, after to [[Isabelline Gothic]] and prior to the [[Herrerian]] architecture in the last third of the 16th century. The name "Prince Philip" refers to the period in which [[Philip II of Spain]] (born in 1527) had not yet received the inheritance of the [[Spanish Monarchy]] by abdication of his father the [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]] (1556). The name "Serlian" is due to the influential architect and treatise [[Sebastiano Serlio]] (in addition to the architectural element called ''Serlian'' in his honor). The [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]], the purist and the [[Castizo|casticist]] are related to the interpretation given to different elements of style, whether intellectual, formal, structural or decorative. Until then, writers of the period termed the [[Classicism|classicist]] forms of the [[Italian Renaissance]] as the ''roman'' (Diego de Sagredo ''Las Medidas del Romano'', 1526), while the late-Gothic forms were called ''the modern''.&lt;ref&gt;Maroto, J. ''Historia del Arte'', Casals, {{ISBN|978-84-218-4021-4}}, pg. 195&lt;/ref&gt; For a more stylistic periodization more common in the [[art history]], at that point of the 16th century the ''[[Cinquecento]]'' had entered in its [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] phase, while for the Spanish art is commonly used the expression High Renaissance (reserving the term Low Renaissance for the last third of the century).

== Description ==
The introduction of the [[Renaissance]] in Spain coincided with a period of great splendor political, economic and social, after the union between [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]], the end of the [[Reconquista]], the [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|discovery of America]] and the coming to power of the [[Habsburg Spain|Habsburgs]]. Although in its beginning the new style from [[Italy]] lived with the persistence of [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and [[Mudéjar]] forms, gradually took hold and served as the expression of the new political power, linked to the new conception of the Catholic [[Counter-Reformation]]. In the first third of the 16th century came the [[Plateresque]], fine and elegant style of decoration, characterized by the use of [[Rustication (architecture)|rustication]] on the exterior walls, [[baluster]]ed [[column]]s with [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]], [[arch]]es or basket-handle, and [[pilaster]]s decorated with grotesques.

In front of the excessive decorate of [[Plateresque]] style, the Purism sought ways simpler and refined, in a sober and classic line, balance and technical perfection, taking more on structural issues and harmonious proportions. The architects have better preparation and training, with the publication of several theoretical treatises as ''Las Medidas del Romano'', [[Diego de Sagredo]] ([[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], 1526), first Renaissance Treaty writing outside Italy, which highlights the prevalence of proportion and the proper disposal of the elements over the decoration.

The purism was characterized by the use of oval or [[barrel vaults]], [[arch]]es, half domes and carved decoration limited to some strategic areas, evaluating the smooth space as an exponent of this new more pure and harmonious aesthetic. In general, the aspect of Purist architecture is of balance and monumentality, compared to the apparent fragility and decorativism of plateresque.

== Works ==
The main signs of the style are found in [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]] and [[Andalusia]].

In [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] developed his work [[Alonso de Covarrubias]], launched in the [[plateresque]] (Courtyard of the [[Hospital de la Santa Cruz, Toledo|Hospital de la Santa Cruz]]), which reached the position of ''arquitecto real'' (1537). Among his buildings are the [[Puerta de Bisagra]] (in the form of a [[triumphal arch]]), the [[Alcázar of Toledo|Alcázar]] (rectangular and severe facade flanked by towers) and the [[Hospital de Tavera]] (1541), which for its classicism and sobriety aimed for Herrerian style. In [[Alcalá de Henares]] built the Palacio Arzobispal, a monumental facade topped by a gallery of arches.

[[File:Leon-diputacion.jpg|thumb|left|Palacio de los Guzmanes.]]
[[Rodrigo Gil de Hontañón]] worked mainly in [[Salamanca]], but was involved in projects throughout Castile. Also formed in the plateresque, although his most representative works are of purism. In 1539, projected –with Fray Martín de Santiago–, the [[Palace of Monterrey]], built only in one quarter, but that is a remarkable example of civil architecture, with magnificent towers with [[crenellation]]s and lookouts drafts. One of his best works would be the façade of [[Colegio Mayor de San Ildefonso]] in the University of Alcalá de Henares (1537–1553), decorated with evenly distributed at regular intervals, [[pediment]] and top of [[crenellation]]s with garlands. Other works were the [[Palacio de los Guzmanes]] in [[León, León|León]], the [[Church of Santa María Magdalena (Valladolid)|church of Santa María Magdalena]] in [[Valladolid]] and the façades of the cathedralics dependences of [[Façade das Platerías|das Platerías]] in the [[Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela]] (1540).

[[File:Cathedral de granda plan.jpg|thumb|Ground plan of the Cathedral of Granada.]]
[[Diego Siloe|Diego de Siloé]] also was initially one of the leading exponents of plateresque (Courtyard of the [[Colegio Mayor de Santiago el Zebedeo]], [[Salamanca]]; Golden Staircase of the [[Cathedral of Burgos]]). Subsequently, spent most of his work in [[Granada]], where he made the [[Pantheon (structure)|pantheon]] for [[El Gran Capitán]] in the [[Monastery of Saint Jerome (Granada)|Monastery of San Jerónimo]], in collaboration with the Italian [[Jacopo Torni]]. His main work was the [[Cathedral of Granada]] (begun in 1528), continuing the original Gothic design by [[Enrique Egas]], who made numerous changes, became the [[Presbytery (architecture)|presbytery]] in a round dome shaped, preceded by a large triumphal arch type. In the [[Column|pillars]] of the [[nave]]s increased height with small columns on an entablature located in the capital, as had [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]] in [[Florence]]. This provision influenced later works such as the cathedrals of [[Málaga Cathedral|Málaga]] and [[Guadix Cathedral|Guadix]], as well as [[Guadalajara Cathedral|Guadalajara (Mexico)]], [[Cathedral of Lima|Lima]] and [[Cathedral of Santo Domingo, Cusco|Cuzco (Peru)]].

[[File:Ubeda.jpg|thumb|left|Sacra Capilla del Salvador in Úbeda.]]
in Granada also worked [[Pedro Machuca]], author of the [[Palace of Charles V]] at the [[Alhambra]] (started in 1528 and interrupted to death of the architect in 1550). The palace included a circular courtyard and an [[octagonal]] chapel, which was never built. The courtyard, of [[Donato Bramante|Bramante]] influence, is one of the masterpieces of the Purism and the Spanish Renaissance architecture, example of balance and perfection of classical, with two-story with columns of [[Doric order|Doric]]-[[Tuscan order]] (lower) and [[Ionic order|Ionic]] (upper).

[[File:AlcarazTwinTowers.jpg|thumb|Torres de Alcaraz.]]
Another great example of Andalusian purism was [[Andrés de Vandelvira]], of own style that was directed then to [[Mannerism]]. One of his characteristic was the use of [[vault (architecture)|vault]]s, and in the Sacra Capilla del Salvador in [[Úbeda]] (1536) -project initiated by Siloé, with who Vandelvira worked in its beginning-. His great work was the [[Jaén Cathedral|Cathedral of Jaén]] (begun in 1540), rectangular, with pillars inspired by the [[Cathedral of Granada]]. Remarkably in this work the Sacristy, with double entablature and overlap of arches of Mannerist style, although of great structural simplicity. Other works were: the Chapel of San Francisco (1546), the Torre del Tardón in [[Alcaraz]] (1555), the palaces of Vela-Cobos (1561) and [[Vázquez de Molina Palace|Vázquez de Molina]] (1562) and the [[Hospital de Santiago]] (1562–1575), all in [[Úbeda]]. The work of Vandelvira left a strong mark on subsequent architecture, especially in Andalusia, Murcia and Alicante.

In Seville highlights the construction of the Royal Chapel of the [[Cathedral of Seville|cathedral]] and the [[Hospital de las Cinco Llagas]], by [[Martín de Gainza (arquitecto)|Martín de Gaínza]], and the top of the Giralda, by [[Hernán Ruiz the Younger]], of [[Sebastiano Serlio|Serlian]] influence, that influence the later Andalusian altars.

[[File:Roman Tomb Silistra TB.JPG|thumb|Exterior view of the Roman Tomb of Silistra]]
The '''Roman Tomb of Silistra''' ({{lang-bg|Римска гробница в Силистра}}, ''Rimska grobnitsa v Silistra'') is an [[Roman funerary practices|Ancient Roman burial tomb]] in the town of [[Silistra]] in northeastern [[Bulgaria]]. Dating to the mid-4th century AD, the Roman Tomb is the best-preserved architectural monument of the [[Roman Empire|Ancient Roman]] city of Durostorum. The tomb is considered "one of the most investigated and most discussed monuments of the late antique art in Bulgaria" and the [[Balkans]],&lt;ref name="atanasov447"&gt;Atanasov, p. 447.&lt;/ref&gt; owing in large part to the quality and extent of its interior frescoes.

==History==
Though the influence of Christianity had reached Silistra by the time, the Roman Tomb is clearly an example of pagan art commissioned by a pagan owner. Thus, it is considered likely that it predates [[Theodosius I]]'s persecution of [[Roman paganism]]. Its construction also likely preceded the [[Goths|Gothic]] invasion of Durostorum of 376–378, which caused great turmoil in the city. The invasion may have caused the master's family depicted in the tomb to flee the city, explaining the lack of burials in the tomb.&lt;ref&gt;Atanasov, p. 451.&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, the tomb must be stylistically ascribed to the 4th century and specifically to Theodosius I's reign.&lt;ref name="henning"&gt;{{cite book|last=Henning|first=Joachim|title=Post-Roman Towns, Trade and Settlement in Europe and Byzantium: Byzantium, Pliska, and the Balkans|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|date=2007|isbn=3110183579|pages=84–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman Tomb was coincidentally discovered in 1942 in the southern outskirts of Silistra, a major town in [[Southern Dobruja]] on the banks of the Lower [[Danube]]. Silistra had only recently been transferred by [[Romania]] back to Bulgaria as part of the 1940 [[Treaty of Craiova]]. Since 1984, the Roman Tomb of Silistra has been on [[UNESCO]]'s Tentative List of [[World Heritage Site]]s.&lt;ref name="unesco"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/48/|title=The late ancient tomb of Silistra|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture and frescoes==
[[File:Roman Tomb Silistra fresco servant.jpg|thumb|A fresco portraying a female servant carrying gifts to the master's family]]
The stone tomb features a single [[burial chamber]] and measures {{convert|3.30|by|2.60|m|ft|abbr=off|lk=on}}. It has a west-east orientation, with the entrance on the east wall and a semi-cylindrical brick vault.&lt;ref name="atanasov448"&gt;Atanasov, p. 448.&lt;/ref&gt; It is located amidst the ruins of a [[necropolis]] from [[Late Antiquity]] which included other similar structures.&lt;ref name="henning"/&gt;

Ceramic plates, rectangular in shape and painted using the [[fresco-secco]] technique, cover the entirety of its floor. In contrast to most other known Roman tombs from the period in the Balkans, the entire interior is covered by multi-coloured mural paintings. The northern, southern and eastern walls feature a procession of [[Slavery in ancient Rome|servants]],&lt;ref name="atanasov448"/&gt; whereas the frescoes of the western wall, directly opposite the entrances, depict the master and his wife.&lt;ref&gt;Atanasov, p. 449.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[frieze]] running along the walls of the tomb contains 11 panels featuring the portraits of male and female slaves bringing various gifts and garments to the masters.&lt;ref name="henning"/&gt;&lt;ref name="unesco"/&gt; The procession runs from either side of the central panel that portrays the masters, providing for a symmetrical composition. The tomb's decoration also includes hunting scenes, candlesticks, plants and animals, including [[peacock]]s and [[pigeon]]s.&lt;ref name="henning"/&gt; Overall, the decoration's remarkable level of preservation and the quality of the mural paintings makes the tomb a "unique example of art and life" in the outer regions of the Roman Empire during the turbulent 4th century.&lt;ref name="unesco"/&gt;

The Roman Tomb of Silistra is situated at the intersection of the Sedmi Septemvri and Boyka Voyvoda Streets in the town. As of 2016, it can only be toured after a prior reservation at the Regional Historical Museum of Silistra.&lt;ref name="rim-silistra"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://museumsilistra.com/index.php/2-uncategorised/49-rimska-grobnitza|title=Римска гробница|publisher=Регионален исторически музей|language=Bulgarian|accessdate=23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Rustic Wedding Symphony''''', Op. 26 (''Ländliche Hochzeit'') is a symphony in [[E-flat major|E flat major]] by [[Karl Goldmark]], written in 1875,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AF0m0117DIwC&amp;pg=PA240&amp;lpg=PA240&amp;dq=rustic+wedding+symphony&amp;source=web&amp;ots=3jnmB7ur5n&amp;sig=KkU4AZX-M85ZW325bQkFkbujzRg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result  David Ewen: Music for the Millions – The Encyclopedia of Musical Masterpieces]&lt;/ref&gt; a year before his renowned [[Violin Concerto No. 1 (Goldmark)|Violin Concerto No. 1]].
The symphony was premiered in [[Vienna]] on 5 March 1876, conducted by [[Hans Richter (conductor)|Hans Richter]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://encyclopedia.farlex.com/Rustic+Wedding The Free Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johannes Brahms]], who was a frequent walking companion of Goldmark's, and whose own [[Symphony No. 1 (Brahms)|Symphony No. 1]] was not premiered until November 1876, told him "That is the best thing you have done; clear-cut and faultless, it sprang into being a finished thing, like Minerva from the head of Jupiter".&lt;ref name=braunstein&gt;Joseph Braunstein, notes to Abravanel recording&lt;/ref&gt; Its first American performance was at a New York Philharmonic Society concert, conducted by [[Theodore Thomas (conductor)|Theodore Thomas]] on 13 January 1877.&lt;ref name=braunstein/&gt;

The work does not conform to the standard structure of a symphony, and it could just be named a Suite. It is in five movements rather than the usual four, which is same as [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|''Pastoral Symphony'']], [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]]'s ''[[Symphonie fantastique]]'' and [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]]'s [[Symphony No. 3 (Schumann)|''Rhenish Symphony'']].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1093WaBF3p4C&amp;pg=PA29&amp;lpg=PA29&amp;dq=rustic+wedding+symphony&amp;source=web&amp;ots=PrYutZIOts&amp;sig=mzgn8HLDZKo-YyCN0gYctRNdGQk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ct=result Michael Talbot, The Finale in Western Instrumental Music]&lt;/ref&gt; It is full of Central European charm, joviality and good humour.  While Goldmark did not provide any specific program for the work, he did give each of the movements titles suggestive of aspects of a wedding in the countryside. 

The first movement is a Wedding March (''Hochzeitsmarsch'') followed by a set of 13 variations.  While variations are commonly found in symphonies, it is most unusual for them to appear in the first movement.  The variations offer constant changes of tempo, meter, rhythm, mood and harmony, and display his fine craftsmanship.&lt;ref name=braunstein/&gt;
* The theme of the March is reminiscent of ''[[Adeste Fideles]]'', and is stated by cellos and basses in octaves.
* Variation 1 is played in horns, clarinets and flutes
* Variation 2, ''Poco animato'', introduces the violins
* Variation 3, full orchestra
* Variation 4, ''Andante con moto'', B flat minor, the theme played by the violins
* Variation 5, ''Allegretto'', basses, bassoons and horns
* Variation 6, ''Allegro vivace'', horns, bassoons, flutes and violins
* Variation 7 involves part writing, again in a minor key
* Variation 8, ''Allegro scherzando'', strings, flutes, oboes and clarinets
* Variation 9, minor key, basses, violins and flutes
* Variation 10, ''Molto vivace'', violins with other strings pizzicato
* Variation 11, ''Andante con moto'', violins, oboe and clarinet
* Variation 12, ''Moderato'', a new melody based on the original theme, oboe, bassoon, viola and two violins
* Variation 13, after a brief fanfare, the original theme is played in the original tempo, but with the full orchestra, and then ends quietly.&lt;ref name=faulkner&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-XWDqySOhrAC&amp;pg=PA474&amp;lpg=PA474&amp;dq=rustic+wedding+symphony&amp;source=web&amp;ots=C5HFIVMSKa&amp;sig=9gszQG8CVJ0VKd_RVCS4U9NbFuI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPA475,M1 Anne Shaw Faulkner, What We Hear in Music]&lt;/ref&gt;

The second movement is a Bridal Song (''Brautlied'').  The third movement, ''Serenade'', opens with a theme played by two oboes, later developed by the strings.&lt;ref name=faulkner/&gt;  It includes an imitation of bagpipes, played on oboe, clarinet, bassoon and cellos.

The fourth movement, In the Garden (''Im Garten''), is slow and lyrical, its middle section moving to E-flat minor.  The finale, ''Dance'', is the only movement of the work written in [[sonata form]].  It opens with a fugue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buywell.com/booklets/4768743.pdf Raymond Tuttle, Notes to Decca recording]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Garden theme briefly reappears, before the Dance returns to end the movement rousingly.

The ''Rustic Wedding Symphony'' was a favourite of conductors such as [[Thomas Beecham]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.classicalsource.com/db_control/db_concert_review.php?id=4252 classical.source.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Leonard Bernstein]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/arts/sydney-symphony/2008/03/16/1205602189219.html Harriet Cunningham, review of Sydney Symphony performance, Sydney Morning Herald, 17 March 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been recorded a number of times, by conductors such as Beecham, Bernstein, [[André Previn]], [[Maurice Abravanel]], [[Jesús López-Cobos]], [[Yondani Butt]] and [[Stephen Gunzenhauser]].

'''''Saint John the Evangelist''''' is a painting by the Italian Baroque painter [[Domenico Zampieri|Domenichino]].  In February 2014 it was on display in the [[National Gallery, London]], on loan from a private collection. 

==History==
The painting is thought to have been commissioned by either [[Benedetto Giustiniani|Benedetto]] (1554–1621) or his brother [[Vincenzo Giustiniani]] (1564–1637) since it appears in the 1638 [[Giustiniani]] inventory. Paintings of Saints [[Saint Matthew|Matthew]], [[Saint Mark|Mark]] and [[Saint Luke|Luke]] (by [[Nicolas Régnier]], [[Francesco Albani]] and [[Guido Reni]] respectively) are also included, all stated to be the same size as the Saint John. It has been suggested therefore that the four paintings were originally intended as a series.&lt;ref name="christies"/&gt;

Despite the prestigious commission, the date of the painting's execution remains unclear. Richard E. Spear, author of numerous publications on [[Seicento|17th-century Italian painting]] and one of the foremost scholars on the life and work of Domenichino,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oberlin.edu/faculty/rspear/spear.html|title=Richard E. Spear|publisher=|accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; put the work at around 1627 to 1629. This is due to stylistic similarities with works such as the Sant'Andrea della Valle's ''Saint John''. An alternative theory, put forward in Squarzina's analysis of the 1938 Giustiniani inventory, speculates that the work could be from before 1621. Others have concluded dates between 1624 and 1628.

The painting descended via Vincenzo Giustiniani's heir to Prince Benedetto Giustiniani, in whose posthumous inventory of 1793 it appears, then to Andrea Giustiniani, who in 1804 declined a purchase offer of 6,500 [[scudo (Italian coin)|scudi]] for it. Andrea then had it taken to Paris, probably before 1806, where he sold it to [[Alexis Delahante]]. Delahante and W. Harris then sold it to Richard Hart Davis and it was then sold in around 1813 with the rest of Davis's collection to Philip John Miles. Inherited firstly by his son, [[Sir William Miles, 1st Baronet|William Miles]] then his grandson [[Sir Philip John William Miles, 2nd Baronet|Philip Miles]], the picture was kept at [[Leigh Court]] where it, along with others in the family's extensive collection, could be viewed upon application.   The impact of the [[Long Depression]] and an agricultural crisis depressing farm prices due to cheap imports from abroad, however, simultaneously attacked this landowning and banking family's sources of income and caused Sir Philip to seek to sell in 1884 at [[Christie's]] where part of the collection was among the first to be sold under the terms of Gladstone's [[Settled Lands Act]].   However, Domenichino and his contemporaries had by then gone out of fashion with British buyers and the ''Saint John the Evangelist'' remained unsold. 

It was then auctioned at Christie's again in 1899 on the death of Cecil Miles, 3rd Baronet who was Philip John Miles's great-grandson – this time it was bought in at 100 guineas and subsequently sold for 70 guineas to M. Colnaghi, acting as agent for Augustus Langham Christie of Tapeley Park, Devonshire and Glyndebourne, East Sussex, part of the Christie family. The painting passed down through that family (later headed by [[John Christie (opera manager)|John Christie]] and known for their connection to the [[Glyndebourne Festival Opera]]) for more than a century until it was auctioned in London in December 2009 to an American buyer for £9.2 million. However, it was then the object of an [[export bar]] to keep it in the [[United Kingdom]] due to its history of ownership in the country. British galleries were unable to raise enough money to buy it (the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]] and [[National Galleries of Scotland]] already being committed to an expensive deal to buy ''[[Diana and Actaeon (Titian)|Diana and Actaeon]]'' and ''[[Diana and Callisto]]'', both by [[Titian]]), but another anonymous collector was allowed to acquire it on the condition that it be displayed to the public for three months each year. He then loaned it to the National Gallery in London from May 2010 to August 2011, where it had previously been displayed from 1992 to 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120917155603/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23741650-details/Glyndebourne+family+to+sell+Old+Master+for+10+million/article.do Glyndebourne family to sell Old Master for £10 million], ''London Evening Standard'', 9 Sept 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/may/18/saved-painting-domenichino-national-gallery 'Saved' Domenichino painting loaned to National Gallery], Guardian, 18 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment_and_arts/10119883.stm|title=Baroque painting by master Domenichino saved for nation|work=BBC News|accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/private-collectors-16392m-saves-masterpiece-from-export-1975587.html|title=Private collector's &amp;#163;9.2m saves masterpiece from export - News - Art - The Independent|work=The Independent|accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artdaily.org/index.asp?int_sec=11&amp;int_new=33182|title=Domenichino Masterpiece to Be Offered at Christie's Auction of Old Masters and 19th Century Art|author=Ignacio Villarreal|publisher=|accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[John the Evangelist|Saint John the Evangelist]] is depicted as a young man accompanied by his traditional symbol the eagle and two [[putti]]. His gaze is directed upwards towards God as he receives the inspiration for his [[gospel]], emphasised by the strong [[chiaroscuro]] light bearing down upon him. This was typical of the artist's style, continuing in the manner of late [[Raphael]] and his own master [[Annibale Carracci]].

The composition is said to have been inspired by classical sculpture, with some commentators pointing specifically to [[Laocoön and His Sons|The Laocoon]].&lt;ref name="christies"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?from=searchresults&amp;intObjectID=5277781&amp;sid=c6f04220-8a30-494e-be4f-fc7874d4c049|title=Domenico Zampieri, Il Domenichino (Bologna 1581-1641 Naples)|author=Christie?s|publisher=|accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also evident in Domenichino's other large-scale treatments of the subject such as Madonna and Child with the Saints John the Evangelist and Petronius and the pendentive in the church of  [[Sant'Andrea della Valle]]. The painting also includes an example of the artist's landscape painting, an aspect of his work that was particularly influential on the likes of [[Claude Lorrain]] and [[Nicolas Poussin]]. This element of the work was originally more compressed into the right-hand section of the canvas, the architecture taking precedence. However,  Domenichino reconsidered this layout and over painted an extension of the landscape onto the wall. Other alterations are also visible in the books, the hand of the right putto and the larger hill of the landscape.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9679">[[Ukiyo-e]] artists may be organized into [[Art movement|schools]], which consist of a founding artist and those artists who were taught by or strongly influenced by him.  Artists of the Osaka school are united both stylistically and geographically.&lt;ref&gt;Assignment of artists into schools is derived from ''Hotei Encyclopedia of Japanese Woodblock Prints,'' 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  Not all of these artists designed [[Woodblock printing|woodblock prints]], and some ukiyo-e artists had more than one teacher, and others are not known to be associated with any particular school.

'''''Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors''''' ({{lang-uk|Тіні забутих предків}}, ''Tini zabutykh predkiv''), also called ''Shadows of Our Forgotten Ancestors'', ''Shadows of Our Ancestors'', or ''Wild Horses of Fire'' &amp;ndash; is a 1965&lt;ref name="SteffenXVI"&gt;{{cite book |last= Steffen |first=James |date=2013 |title= The Cinema of Sergei Parajanov |url= https://books.google.com/?id=RbDxAAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=shadows+parajanov+september+1964#v=snippet&amp;q=1964%20september&amp;f=false |location=Madison |publisher= University of Wisconsin Press |isbn= 978-0-299-29653-7 |page="xvi}}&lt;/ref&gt; film by the Soviet filmmaker [[Sergei Parajanov]] based on the classic book by Ukrainian writer [[Mykhailo Kotsiubynsky]]. The film was Parajanov's first major work and earned him international acclaim for its rich use of costume and color. The film also features a detailed portrayal of [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] [[Hutsul]] culture, showing not only the harsh [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian]] environment and brutal family rivalries, but also the various aspects of Hutsul traditions, music, costumes, and dialect.

==Plot==
In a small [[Hutsul]] village in the [[Carpathian mountains]] of [[Ukraine]], a young man, Ivan, falls in love with the daughter of the man who killed his father. Though their families share a bitter enmity, Ivan and Marichka have known each other since childhood. In preparation for their marriage, Ivan leaves the village to work and earn money for a household. While he is gone, Marichka accidentally slips into a river and drowns while trying to rescue a lost lamb.

Ivan returns and falls into despair after seeing Marichka's body. He continues to work, enduring a period of joyless toil, until he meets another woman, Palahna, while shoeing a horse. Ivan and Palahna get married in a traditional [[Hutsul]] wedding in which they are blindfolded and yoked together. The marriage quickly turns sour, however, as Ivan remains obsessed with the memory of Marichka. Estranged from her emotionally distant husband, Palahna becomes involved with a local sorcerer, while Ivan begins to experience hallucinations.

At a tavern, Ivan witnesses the sorcerer embrace Palahna and strike one of his friends. Roused into an uncharacteristic fury, Ivan snatches up his axe, only to be struck down by the sorcerer. Ivan stumbles into the nearby woods and perceives Marichka's spirit to be with him, reflected in the water and gliding amongst the trees. As reality merges into dream, the colorless shade of Marichka reaches out across a great space and touches Ivan's outstretched hand. Ivan screams and dies. The community gives him a traditional Hutsul burial while children watch through cross braced windows.

==Themes==
The film is highly symbolic, making frequent use of religious and folkloric images that include crosses, lambs, graves, and spirits. The film also uses color to represent mood. During Ivan's period of mourning, black and white film stock is used. In other scenes, colors are often muted, but provide a contrast to vivid use of red and yellow. On its release, the film's presentation contrasted with the common [[socialist realism]] style that had government approval. After refusing to change the film, Parajanov was soon blacklisted from Soviet cinema.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parajanov.com/maestro.html Sergei Paradzhanov&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 2001, Norrington was originally attached to [[Dimension Films]]'s ''[[Ghost Rider (2007 film)|Ghost Rider]]'' before the project was acquired by [[Columbia Pictures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/18676|title=WWII Backdrop, Monsters and 'The Lost Patrol'|publisher=BloodyDisgusting}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Michael|first=Fleming|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117785776.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1|title='Ghost' adds a Dimension|publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''|date=2000-08-30|accessdate=2006-12-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was eventually released in 2007 directed by [[Mark Steven Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Harris|first=Dana|url=http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=story&amp;articleid=VR1117884327&amp;categoryid=13&amp;cs=1|title=Johnson sees 'Ghost'|publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''|date=2003-04-08|accessdate=2006-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Hands of Shang-Chi''===
* In 2001, Norrington announced that he had agreed to direct a film based on ''The Hands of Shang-Chi: Master of Kung Fu'', a film adaptation based on the Marvel character ''[[:w:c:marvel:Shang-Chi|Shang-Chi]]''. Norrington described the film as "a real honest-to-goodness martial arts film, rather than a film that simply has martial arts in it". In 2004, it was announced that [[Ang Lee]] had been brought on as producer. In 2005, it was announced that Stan Lee had agreed to executive produce the film for DreamWorks, with Yuen Woo-ping directing from a Bruce McKenna screenplay.&lt;ref name="leechiback"&gt;[http://blog.moviefone.com/2006/02/27/ang-lees-shang-chi-movie-is-back/ Ang Lee's Shang-Chi movie is back]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, [[Avi Arad]] stated that he thought that a PG-13 adaptation was possible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtv.com/shared/movies/interviews/a/arad_avi_062005/ Future Shocks: What's Ahead For Avi Arad and his Marvel empire?]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Ang Lee confirmed his and Yuen's continued involvement with the project.&lt;ref name="leechiback" /&gt; However, no further developments have been announced to date.

===''Akira'' remake===
* Shortly after Warner Bros. acquired the rights in 2002, Stephen Norrington was slated to direct a remake to the 1988 film ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'', with [[James Robinson (writer)|James Robinson]] writing the screenplay and [[Dan Lin]] producing.&lt;ref name="ign la 2017"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/06/akira-the-tortured-history-of-the-unmade-live-action-adaptation | title = Akira: The Tortured History of he Unmade Live-Action Adaptation | first = Christopher | last = Marc | date = April 6, 2017 | accessdate = August 31, 2017 | work = [[IGN]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ign.com/articles/2002/04/12/akira-hollywood-remake]&lt;/ref&gt; Norrington had planned to make the remake more appealing to Western audiences, making Kaneda and Tetsuo brothers. Following the commercial failure of ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (film)|The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'' in 2003, which both Norrington and Robinson were also on, the project was put on hold.&lt;ref name="ign la 2017"/&gt;

===''The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen'' (sequel and reboot)===
* In 2003, Norrington's ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (film)|The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'' was intended to spawn a [[Media franchise|film franchise]] based on further titles in the original comic book series, but there was little enthusiasm for a sequel due to performing poorly at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2003/TLOEG.php|title=The Numbers: Box Office Data|publisher=|accessdate=October 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the sequel was scrapped, ''The Tracking Board'' reported, on May 26, 2015, that 20th Century Fox and [[Davis Entertainment]] had agreed to develop a reboot with hopes of launching a new franchise. The report stated that a search was underway for a director who could help "continue to develop the reboot".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tracking-board.com/tb-exclusive-fox-enters-development-on-a-reboot-of-the-league-of-extraordinary-gentlemen/|title={TB EXCLUSIVE} Fox Enters Development on "The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen" Reboot – The Tracking Board|work=The Tracking Board}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Davis (producer)|John Davis]] told Collider in an interview that the reboot will be a female-centric film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/league-of-extraordinary-gentlemen-reboot-female-centric/|title='League of Extraordinary Gentlemen' Reboot to Be Female-Centric|publisher=Collider|last=Goldberg|first=Matt|date=August 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, there has not been any further announcements, falling into development hell.

===''Clash of the Titans'' (2010)===
* In 2007, Norrington was originally set to direct the remake of the 1981 fantasy film ''[[Clash of the Titans (2010 film)|Clash of the Titans]]''. However, Norrington was unsure about his direction for the project because he did not grow up with the original. [[Louis Leterrier]], who did, contacted Norrington through their shared agent about replacing him. Leterrier's film was released in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Crow To Fly Again: LXG's Norrington to write, direct|url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=23871|date=15 December 2008|accessdate=13 January 2009|publisher=Empire Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Fleming, Michael |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117977672.html?categoryid=1238&amp;cs=1 |title=Norrington to direct ''Titans'' |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=2007-12-13 |accessdate=2008-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Crow'' (reboot)===
* In 2008, it was announced that Norrington would direct a reboot of ''[[The Crow#In_other_media|The Crow]]'' franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/19918|title='The Crow' Redo Flying Back to Detroit?|publisher=BloodyDisgusting}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left the film by 2013 and was replaced by [[F.

==2010s==

===''The Lost Patrol''===
* In 2010, Norrington was going to direct and write the supernatural action thriller ''The Lost Patrol'' to be distributed by [[Legendary Pictures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/35313/stephen-norrington-helm-the-lost-patrol-wwii-plus-monsters|title=Stephen Norrington to Helm The Lost Patrol - WWII Plus Monsters!|publisher=DreadCentral}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, there has not been any further development.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42152">The following is '''a list of unproduced [[Steven Spielberg]] projects''' in roughly chronological order. During his long career, American film director [[Steven Spielberg]] has worked on a number of projects which never progressed beyond the pre-production stage under his direction. Some of these projects fell in [[development hell]], were officially canceled, or were in [[development limbo]].

== 1970s ==
=== ''Flushed with Pride: The Story of Thomas Crapper'' ===
At the beginning of the 1970s, Spielberg tried to greenlight the production of ''Flushed with Pride: The Story of Thomas Crapper'', the semi-satirical biography of [[Thomas Crapper]], who, as the book suggested, invented the flushing toilet. Spielberg approached screenwriters [[Gloria Katz]] and [[Willard Huyck]] to write the script.&lt;ref name="Awalt2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Awalt|title=Steven Spielberg and Duel: The Making of a Film Career|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yjsfAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=Flushed|date=14 March 2014|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|isbn=978-0-8108-9261-3|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the film was never made due to various problems, so Spielberg left the project to direct ''[[The Sugarland Express]]''.

=== ''Cruising'' ===
In the early 1970s, film producer [[Philip D'Antoni]] hired Spielberg to direct a film adaptation of Gerald Walker's novel ''[[Cruising (novel)|Cruising]]''.&lt;ref name=gingold&gt;{{cite web|last=Gingold|first=Michael|title=Steven Spielberg’s Strange History With ‘Cruising’|date=15 February 2017|publisher=[[IndieWire]]|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2017/02/steven-spielberg-cruising-al-pacino-1201783514/|accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Spielberg was reportedly attached to the project for three years before officially dropping out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Malkin|first=Marc|title=No ''Cruising'' for Steven Spielberg|date=30 August 2007|publisher=''[[E! News]]''|url=https://www.eonline.com/news/59449/no-cruising-for-steven-spielberg|accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;   According to D'Antoni, "We just couldn’t come up with a script that met with my satisfaction... So we decided to abandon the project, and figured we’d go on to do something else together some other day, and Steven went back to LA.”&lt;ref name=gingold/&gt;  The [[Cruising (film)|film adaptation]] was eventually directed by [[William Friedkin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=William Friedkin: ‘Cruising’ Was Almost Directed By Steven Spielberg (VIDEO)|date=3 May 2013|publisher=''[[HuffPost]]''|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/03/william-friedkin-cruising_n_3204257.html|accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Lucky Lady'' ===
Spielberg was considered to direct ''[[Lucky Lady]]'' for [[20th Century Fox]].  The script was written by Huyck and Katz and [[Paul Newman]] was to have starred in the film had Spielberg directed.  However, Spielberg could not direct the film due to his commitment with ''Jaws''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yjsfAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA183&amp;lpg=PA183&amp;dq=steven+spielberg+lucky+lady&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=z_gd0zZB-_&amp;sig=QEotz3UyVhJqF3h7qYHscuA_UUQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjOkvH9mqfcAhWD94MKHVrpDks4ChDoAQg-MAM#v=onepage&amp;q=steven%20spielberg%20lucky%20lady&amp;f=false|last=Awalt|first=Steven|title=Steven Spielberg and Duel: The Making of a Film Career|year=2014|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9780810892613}}page 183&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Freer|first=Ian|title=Steven Spielberg's Interstellar?!

=== ''Superman: The Movie'' ===
Around 1975, after the success of ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', [[Alexander Salkind]] and his son [[Ilya Salkind|Ilya]] wanted to hire Spielberg to direct ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman: The Movie]]'', the first theatrical movie based on the [[Superman]] comic book series. However, due to Spielberg's commitment to ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', the Salkinds finally hired [[Richard Donner]] to direct the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|url=http://www.supermanhomepage.com/movies/movies.php?topic=interview-salkind|title=One-on-One Interview with Producer Ilya Salkind|author=Barry M. Freiman|date=|website=www.supermanhomepage.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Adventures of Indiana Smith'' ===
In May 1977, Spielberg met his colleague [[George Lucas]] in [[Hawaii]]. During that vacation, Lucas convinced Spielberg to make a film based on the [[Movie serial|film serials]] of the 1930s and 1940s. Lucas previously wrote a script for the planned film, entitled ''The Adventures of Indiana Smith''; in which the main character, Indiana Smith, was based on [[James Bond]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2008/02/spielberg_qanda200802?currentPage=4|title=Q&amp;A: Steven Spielberg on Indiana Jones|first=Jim|last=Windolf|date=|website=vanityfair.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, at the final moment, both Lucas and Spielberg made many changes to the script, whose concept was used to create ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', and subsequently, the [[Indiana Jones (franchise)|''Indiana Jones'' film franchise]].

=== ''Close Encounters of the Third Kind 2'' ===
In late 1977, after the successful reception of ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', Spielberg expressed interest in filming a [[Close Encounters of the Third Kind#Legacy|sequel or a prequel]]. However, he later refused the idea, because he felt that "The army's knowledge and ensuing [[cover-up]] is so subterranean that it would take a creative screen story, perhaps someone else making the picture and giving it the equal time it deserves". He also didn't want developer [[Columbia Pictures]] to make a sequel without him, which had happened with [[Universal Pictures]]' ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/movies/et/236015/how-steven-spielbergs-night-skies-became-et|title=How Steven Spielberg's Night Skies Became E.T.|author=|date=|website=denofgeek.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Magic'' ===
In the late 1970s, Spielberg expressed interest in directing a film adaptation of [[William Goldman]]'s novel ''[[Magic (novel)|Magic]]'' and considered casting [[Robert De Niro]] for the lead role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lBz7pwx2I-oC&amp;pg=PT306&amp;dq=steven+spielberg+robert+de+niro+magic&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjq7aLO5brdAhVSnlkKHYVHBtYQ6AEIMzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=steven%20spielberg%20robert%20de%20niro%20magic&amp;f=false|last=Dougan|first=Andy|title=Untouchable: Robert De Niro: Unauthorised|year=2011|publisher=Random House|isbn=9780753546840}}{{page needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schager|first=Nick|title=14 Major Movies That Were ALMOST Directed by Steven Spielberg|date=1 October 2015|publisher=[[Yahoo!]]|url=https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/news/14-major-movies-that-were-almost-made-by-steven-155957788.html|accessdate=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Magic (1978 film)|film]] ended up being directed by [[Richard Attenborough]] and Spielberg admitted, "...I went to see the picture and realized that it was a hell of a lot better than what I would have done."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jf9HBgttTeQC&amp;pg=PA296&amp;dq=steven+spielberg+robert+de+niro+magic&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjq7aLO5brdAhVSnlkKHYVHBtYQ6AEIOTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=steven%20spielberg%20robert%20de%20niro%20magic&amp;f=false|last=McBride|first=Joseph|title=Steven Spielberg: A Biography, Second Edition|year=2011|publisher=Univ. Press of Mississippi|isbn=9781604738377}}page 296&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Night Skies'' ===
{{main|Night Skies}}
After his decision not to make a sequel to ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', Spielberg started the development of  his next project, a [[Science fiction films|science fiction]] [[horror film]] entitled ''[[Night Skies]]'', whose concept was pitched by him during the development of ''Close Encounters''. The film was intended to be a spiritual [[Sequel|follow-up]] to ''Close Encounters''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/rick-baker-night-skies-aliens/|title=See the Rick Baker Night Skies Aliens - /Film|author=|date=26 May 2014|website=slashfilm.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lawrence Kasdan]] was attached to write the screenplay. However, the film wasn't made, although the main concept was the inspiration of two Spielberg's films: ''[[Poltergeist (1982 film)|Poltergeist]]'' and ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' (although the first wasn't directed by Spielberg).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/mar/15/artsfeatures.stevenspielberg|title=Alien resurrection|first=David|last=Thomson|date=15 March 2002|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1980s ==
=== ''Blackhawk'' ===
In the early 1980s, Spielberg announced that he had plans to direct a film adaptation of the [[Blackhawk (DC Comics)|Blackhawk]] comic book series. [[Dan Aykroyd]] was attached to play Blackhawk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cosmicteams.com/quality/evanier-Interview.html|title=Justice Society of America|author=|date=|website=www.cosmicteams.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the project never materialized and Spielberg chose to direct ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]''. In April 2018, new development emerged when it was announced that Spielberg will produce/direct a new film adaptation of ''Blackhawk'' for [[Warner Bros.]], with the screenplay being written by [[David Koepp]]. Spielberg will co-produce the film with [[Kristie Macosko Krieger]] and Sue Kroll.&lt;ref&gt;https://variety.com/2018/film/news/steven-spielberg-blackhawk-dc-1202756319/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ew.com/movies/2018/04/17/steven-spielberg-blackhawk/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Reel to Reel'' ===
Around 1980, during the filming of ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', Spielberg contacted [[Gary David Goldberg]] to make a semiautobiographical musical film entitled ''Reel to Reel''. The film's plot would have been surrounding a filmmaker named Stuart Moss, and his direction of a musical remake of ''[[Invaders from Mars (1953 film)|Invaders From Mars]]''.&lt;ref name="McBride2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph McBride|title=Steven Spielberg: A Biography (Third Edition)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cbbJgbdwUFkC&amp;pg=PT242&amp;dq=reel+to+reel+steven+spielberg|date=1 September 2012|publisher=Faber &amp; Faber|isbn=978-0-571-28055-1|page=242}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was officially announced in production in 1983, but Spielberg finally abandoned the project and chose to direct ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2015/10/the-lost-unmade-projects-of-steven-spielberg-112055/|title=The Lost &amp; Unmade Projects Of Steven Spielberg|first=Oliver|last=Lyttelton|date=14 October 2015|website=indiewire.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Three Amigos'' ===
After he finished ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'', Spielberg almost planned to direct the comedy ''[[Three Amigos]]'' next, with [[Steve Martin]], [[Bill Murray]] and [[Robin Williams]] as the leads.  He chose to direct ''E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial'' instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Evans|first=Bradford|title=The Lost Roles of Three Amigos|date=15 December 2011|publisher=[[Vulture.com]]|url=http://www.vulture.com/2011/12/the-lost-roles-of-three-amigos.html|accessdate=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Green|first=Anna|title=15 Infamous Facts About ¡Three Amigos!|date=12 May 2015|publisher=''[[Mental Floss]]''|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/68307/15-infamous-facts-about-three-amigos|accessdate=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''E.T. II: Nocturnal Fears'' ===
In July 1982, Spielberg hired ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' writer [[Melissa Mathison]] to write a script for a sequel film, entitled ''E.T. II: Nocturnal Fears''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://birthmoviesdeath.com/2015/04/13/the-incredibly-ill-advised-e.t.-sequel-that-almost-was|title=The Incredibly Ill-Advised E.T. Sequel That Almost Was|first=Scott|last=Wampler|date=13 April 2015|website=birthmoviesdeath.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's plot would have shown Elliott and his friends getting kidnapped by evil aliens and follow their attempts to contact E.T. for help. However, Spielberg finally decided to cancel the sequel's production, feeling it "would do nothing but rob the original of its virginity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/doc/154308595.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=&amp;author=&amp;pub=&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=&amp;desc=|title=

=== ''Indiana Jones and the Monkey King'' ===
In September 1984, after the critical and mixed reception of ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'', [[George Lucas]] wrote a script entitled ''Indiana Jones and the Monkey King'' for the third installment of the film series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/31313/lost-scripts-part-i-indiana-jones-and-monkey-king|title=The Lost Scripts, Part I: Indiana Jones and the Monkey King|author=|date=26 July 2012|website=mentalfloss.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film had the [[Fountain of Youth]] as the [[MacGuffin]]. Spielberg was attached to direct, but at the final moment, Spielberg decided to hire [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]] to rewrite the script, and the third film ended up being ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/indiana-jones/29092/the-indiana-jones-films-that-never-happened|title=The Indiana Jones films that never happened|author=|date=|website=denofgeek.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Who Discovered Roger Rabbit'' ===
In 1989, Spielberg discussed with [[J.J. Abrams]] the possibilites of making a sequel to the successful ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' feature film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nerdist.com/nerdist-podcast-j-j-abrams-and-dan-trachtenberg/|title=Nerdist Podcast: J.J. Abrams and Dan Trachtenberg - Nerdist|author=|date=11 March 2016|website=nerdist.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sequel's plot would have been Roger Rabbit, Baby Herman, and Richie Davenport traveling west to seek Roger's mother, in the process meeting Jessica Krupnick (Roger's future wife), a struggling Hollywood actress. While Roger and Ritchie are enlisting in the Army, Jessica is kidnapped and forced to make pro-[[Nazi Germany]] broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmbuffonline.com/FBOLNewsreel/wordpress/2005/08/07/script-review-roger-rabbit-ii-the-toon-platoon/|title=Script Review: ROGER RABBIT II: THE TOON PLATOON - FilmBuffOnline|author=|date=7 August 2005|website=filmbuffonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film would also have been the first true film from [[Amblin Entertainment]]'s animation division [[Amblimation]]. However, after directing ''[[Schindler's List]]'', Spielberg refused to direct any films satirizing the Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2008/04/18/spielberg-lucas-titans-talk|title=Spielberg &amp; Lucas: The titans talk!|author=|date=|website=ew.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Eisner]] commissioned a rewrite in 1997 with [[Sherri Stoner]] and [[Deanna Oliver]]. Although they kept Roger's search for his mother, Stoner and Oliver replaced the WWII subplot with Roger's inadvertent rise to stardom on [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] and Hollywood. Disney was impressed and [[Alan Menken]] was hired to write five songs for the film and offered his services as executive producer. One of the songs, "This Only Happens in the Movies", was recorded in 2008 on the debut album of Broadway actress [[Kerry Butler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://broadwayworld.com/viewcolumn.cfm?colid=25560 | title = Kerry Butler's 'Faith, Trust and Pixie Dust' Set For May Release | work = Broadway World | date = February 28, 2008 | accessdate = November 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eric Goldberg (film director)|Eric Goldberg]] was set to be the new animation director, and began to redesign Roger's new character appearance.

Spielberg became busy establishing [[DreamWorks]], while Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy decided to remain as producers. Test footage for ''Who Discovered Roger Rabbit'' was shot sometime in 1998 at the Disney animation unit in [[Lake Buena Vista, Florida]]; the results were a mix of CGI, traditional animation, and live-action that did not please Disney. A second test had the Toons completely converted to [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]]; but this was dropped as the film's projected budget would escalate past $100 million. Eisner felt it was best to cancel the film. In March 2003, producer [[Don Hahn]] was doubtful about a sequel being made, arguing that public tastes had changed since the 1990s with the rise of computer animation. "There was something very special about that time when animation was not as much in the forefront as it is now."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author =Staff| url = https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2003-03-26-rabbit_x.htm | title = Don't expect a ''Rabbit'' sequel | work = [[USA Today]] | date = March 26, 2003 | accessdate = September 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2007, Marshall stated that he was still "open" to the idea,&lt;ref name="Frank"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2007/12/11/roger-rabbit-sequel-still-in-the-offing-stay-tooned-says-producer/ | title = ''Roger Rabbit'' Sequel Still In The Offing?

Seaman were writing a new script for the project, and the animated characters would be in traditional two-dimensional, while the rest would be in [[motion capture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2009/11/03/exclusive-robert-zemeckis-indicates-hell-use-performance-capture-and-3-d-in-roger-rabbit-sequel/ |title=EXCLUSIVE: Robert Zemeckis Indicates He'll Use Performance-Capture And 3-D In 'Roger Rabbit' Sequel |publisher=Moviesblog.mtv.com |accessdate=November 12, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101103072903/http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2009/11/03/exclusive-robert-zemeckis-indicates-hell-use-performance-capture-and-3-d-in-roger-rabbit-sequel/ |archivedate=November 3, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2010, Zemeckis said that the sequel would remain hand-drawn animated and live-action sequences will be filmed, just like in the original film, but the lighting effects on the cartoon characters and some of the props that the Toons handle will be done digitally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toontownantics.blogspot.com/2010/07/roger-rabbit-2-in-3d.html |title=Toontown Antics - Roger Rabbit's adventures in real and animated life: Roger Rabbit 2 – In 3D? |publisher=Toontownantics.blogspot.com |date=July 20, 2010 |accessdate=November 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2010, Don Hahn, who was the film's original associate producer, confirmed the sequel's development in an interview with ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]''. He stated, "Yeah, I couldn't possibly comment. I deny completely, but yeah... if you're a fan, pretty soon you're going to be very, very, very happy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=28191 |title=Exclusive: The Lion King To Go 3D! &amp;#124; Movie News &amp;#124; Empire |publisher=Empireonline.com |accessdate=November 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, [[Bob Hoskins]] stated he was interested in the project, reprising his role as Eddie Valiant. However, he retired from acting in 2012 after being diagnosed with [[Parkinson's disease]] a year earlier, and died from complications in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/news/update/2012-08-08/bob-hoskins-retires-from-acting/ |title=Bob Hoskins retires from acting |publisher=Itv.com |date=August 8, 2012 |accessdate=August 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marshall has confirmed that the film is a prequel, similar to earlier drafts, and that the writing was almost complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/frank-marshall-roger-rabbit-2-sequel-bourne-legacy/187006/ |title=Frank Marshall Talks WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT 2 Sequel, THE BOURNE LEGACY, THE GOONIES 2, More |publisher=Collider |accessdate=October 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During an interview at the premiere of ''[[Flight (2012 film)|Flight]]'', Zemeckis stated that the sequel was still possible, despite Hoskins' absence, and the script for the sequel was sent to Disney for approval from studio executives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fischer|first=Russ|title=Despite Bob Hoskins' Retirement, the 'Roger Rabbit' Sequel is Still Possible|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/despite-bob-hoskins-retirement-the-roger-rabbit-sequel-is-still-possible/|publisher=[[SlashFilm|/Film]]|accessdate=October 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, Gary K. Wolf, writer of the original novel, said Erik Von Wodtke and he were working on a development proposal for an animated Disney buddy comedy starring Mickey Mouse and Roger Rabbit called ''The Stooge'', based on [[The Stooge|the 1952 film of the same name]]. The proposed film is set to a prequel, taking place five years before ''Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' and part of the story is about how Roger met Jessica, his future wife. Wolf has stated the film is currently wending its way through Disney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdizzy.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=30567 |title=• View topic - Mickey Mouse &amp; Roger Rabbit in The Stooge |publisher=Dvdizzy.com |accessdate=August 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2016, while promoting his latest film ''[[Allied (film)|Allied]]'', in England, Zemeckis stated that the sequel "moves the story of Roger and Jessica Rabbit into the next few years of period film, moving on from film noir to the world of the 1950s". He also stated that the sequel would feature a "digital Bob Hoskins", as Eddie Valiant would return in "ghost form". While the director went on to state that the script is "terrific" and the film would still use hand-drawn animation, Zemeckis thinks that the chances of Disney green-lighting the sequel are "slim". As he explained more in detail, "The current corporate Disney culture [the current studio management of [[The Walt Disney Company]]] has no interest in Roger, and they certainly don't like Jessica at all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brew|first=Simon|title=Who Framed Roger Rabbit 2 would include "digital Bob Hoskins"|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/uk/movies/who-framed-roger-rabbit-2/45599/who-framed-roger-rabbit-2-would-include-digital-bob-hoskins|publisher=Den of Geek|accessdate=November 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1990s ==

=== ''Why Can't I Be Audrey Hepburn?'' ===
According to [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]] on his appearance on the  radio program ''[[Fresh Air with Terry Gross]]'', Ryan sold a script he made for Spielberg called ''Why Can't I Be Audrey Hepburn?'' about a woman obsessed with famous film actress [[Audrey Hepburn]]  who has left at the altar who then meets a man just as Audrey-centric as she. The film was going to star [[Téa Leoni]] and [[Jennifer Love Hewitt]] as different roles. Spielberg was interested in making it, but the film's production was canceled after nothing new came out of it and Spielberg had a lot of other projects in the 90's he was busy working on.  

=== ''Cape Fear'' ===
In the early stages of development, Spielberg was slated to direct the [[Cape Fear (1991 film)|remake]] of the 1962 film ''[[Cape Fear (1962 film)|Cape Fear]]'' whereas [[Martin Scorsese]] would direct ''[[Schindler's List]]'' (1993).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unforgettable Scene: De Niro's Cape Fear Seduction|date=7 October 2011|publisher=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''|url=https://ew.com/article/2011/10/07/unforgettable-scene-de-niros-cape-fear-seduction/|accessdate=18 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Had Spielberg directed, he envisioned the roles of [[Max Cady]] and Sam Bowden to be portrayed by [[Bill Murray]] and [[Harrison Ford]] respectively.&lt;ref name=cf&gt;{{cite web|last=Baldwin|first=Daniel|title=[Exhumed &amp; Exonerated] ‘Cape Fear’ (1991)|date=27 October 2016|publisher=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/3410947/exhumed-exonerated-cape-fear-1991/|accessdate=18 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Spielberg eventually decided to swap projects with Scorsese in favor of directing ''Schindler's List'' instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Collin|first=Robbie|title=The 10 greatest films almost made|date=26 September 2014|publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/11006358/What-if-Scorsese-had-made-Schindlers-List.html|accessdate=18 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although uncredited, Spielberg did remain as a producer of the remake.&lt;ref name=cf/&gt;

=== ''Shrek'' ===
In 1991, Spielberg bought the rights to [[William Steig]]'s 1990 children's book ''[[Shrek!]]''.  Spielberg originally envisioned his adaptation as a [[Traditional animation|traditional animated]] film from [[Amblin Entertainment]], with [[Bill Murray]] as the voice of the [[Shrek (character)|titular character]] and [[Steve Martin]] as the voice of [[Donkey (Shrek)|Donkey]].  Despite co-founding [[DreamWorks Animation]]—the eventual owner of the [[Shrek (franchise)|''Shrek'' franchise]]—in 1994, Spielberg moved on to other projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cormier|first=Roger|title=15 Giant Facts About Shrek|date=22 March 2016|publisher=''[[Mental Floss]]''|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/64343/15-giant-facts-about-shrek|accessdate=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Denninger|first=Lindsay|title=5 Actors Almost Cast In 'Shrek,' Because Mike Myers Wasn't Supposed To Voice The Ogre|date=18 May 2016|publisher=''[[Bustle (magazine)]]''|url=https://www.bustle.com/articles/160924-5-actors-almost-cast-in-shrek-because-mike-myers-wasnt-supposed-to-voice-the-ogre|accessdate=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Indiana Jones and the Saucermen from Mars'' ===
In 1995, a time after the cancellation of ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]'', [[Jeb Stuart (writer)|Jeb Stuart]] wrote a script for the fourth film in the [[Indiana Jones (franchise)|''Indiana Jones'' film series,]] entitled ''Indiana Jones and the Saucermen from Mars''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/31320/lost-scripts-part-ii-indiana-jones-and-saucermen-mars|title=The Lost Scripts, Part II: Indiana Jones and the Saucermen from Mars|author=|date=27 July 2012|website=mentalfloss.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spielberg was supposed to direct it, while [[George Lucas]] was supposed to serve as producer. Although Lucas loved the script, Spielberg and Ford had issues with it, so Spielberg hired ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'' writer [[Jeffrey Boam]] to make a rewrite of Stuart's script. However, the script was finally rejected after the release of ''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]'', which was released one year later. The fourth film, entitled ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'', was finally released in 2008.

=== ''Meet the Parents'' ===
It was reported that back in 1996, Spielberg was slated to direct [[Jim Carrey]] in a remake of [[Greg Glienna]]'s 1992 film ''[[Meet the Parents (1992 film)|Meet the Parents]]'' for [[Universal Pictures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Evans|first=Bradford|title=The Lost Roles of Jim Carrey|date=17 March 2011|publisher=[[Vulture.com]]|url=http://www.vulture.com/2011/03/the-lost-roles-of-jim-carrey.html|accessdate=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cormier|first=Roger|title=15 Fun Facts About Meet the Parents|date=6 October 2015|publisher=''[[Mental Floss]]''|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/69414/15-fun-facts-about-meet-parents|accessdate=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Spielberg, along with Carrey, left the project due to schedule conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Carrey Has 'No Regrets' Over Meet The Parents|date=16 December 2008|publisher=[[Contactmusic.com]]|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/jim-carrey/news/carrey-has-no-regrets-over-meet-the-parents_1089627|accessdate=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Carrey has 'no regrets' over 'Meet The Parents'|date=17 December 2008|publisher=''[[Irish Examiner]]''|url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/entertainment/carrey-has-no-regrets-over-meet-the-parents-390867.html|accessdate=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Spielberg's company [[DreamWorks]] served as a co-distributor of the [[Meet the Parents|2000 remake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meet the Parents|date=14 November 2000|publisher=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''|url=http://ew.com/article/2000/11/14/meet-parents-3/|accessdate=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Truman Show'' ===
Spielberg was among the list of filmmakers considered to direct ''[[The Truman Show]]'' (1998) before [[Peter Weir]] officially assumed the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Charisma|first=James|title=How The Truman Show Predicted the Future|date=4 June 2018|publisher=[[Yahoo!]]|url=https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/truman-show-predicted-future-180106770.html|accessdate=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''I'll Be Home'' ===
In 1999, Spielberg announced that he was working on an autobiographical film, entitled ''I'll Be Home'', but  nothing came of this project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fromdirectorstevenspielberg.tumblr.com/lost-spielberg|title=Lost and Unmade Spielberg|author=|date=|website=fromdirectorstevenspielberg.tumblr.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2000s ==

=== ''The Curse of Monkey Island'' ===
In the start of 2000, Spielberg was set to make his first animated feature film based on the [[Lucasarts]] video game series ''[[Monkey Island (series)|Monkey Island]]'', a game series he was a fan of at the time. Spielberg was set to direct, produce and co-write the screenplay with [[Ted Elliott (screenwriter)|Ted Elliott]], with concept arts by the original game's designer [[Steve Purcell]] and animator [[Anthony Stacchi|Tony Stacchi]], executive produced by Steven's best friend and founder of the game's developer [[George Lucas]] (making the second collaboration between Spielberg and Lucas outside the [[Indiana Jones (franchise)|Indiana Jones]] series), co-production by [[Lucasfilm]] (Lucasarts' owner)  and animation production by [[DreamWorks Animation]] and [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic|ILM]]. Despite the concept arts being released, the film's production was shut down since George was busy making ''[[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones]]'' and money problems. However some of the concepts later appeared in Ted's script to ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]'' that was made  by [[DreamWorks]]' rival [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]. Later in 2011, Spielberg made his first animated film with [[Peter Jackson]] called ''[[The Adventures of Tintin (film)|The Adventures of Tintin]]''.

=== ''Indiana Jones and the City of Gods'' ===
On May 17, 2002, IGN reported that ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]'' writer [[Frank Darabont]] will write the fourth film of the film franchise of ''[[Indiana Jones (franchise)|Indiana Jones]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2002/05/17/ign-filmforce-exclusive-has-indy-iv-found-its-writer|title=IGN FilmForce Exclusive: Has Indy IV Found Its Writer?|first=Stax &amp; Ken|last=Plume|date=17 May 2002|website=ign.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; entitled ''Indiana Jones and the City of Gods'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2008/02/spielberg_qanda200802|title=Q&amp;A: Steven Spielberg on Indiana Jones|first=Jim|last=Windolf|date=|website=vanityfair.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which ex-[[Nazis]] would chase Indiana Jones. The script is very similar to the final script, including Indy's and Marion's wedding and a scene with army ants, but it didn't include Indiana Jones' son. Spielberg liked the script very much, but [[George Lucas]] disliked it, and for that reason, he hired [[David Koepp]] to write the film. The film ended up being ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'' which was released in 2008, with Spielberg returning as director.

=== ''The Catcher in the Rye'' ===
It was reported in 2003 that Spielberg attempted to direct a film adaptation of [[J.D. Salinger]]'s novel ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'' but could not obtain the rights from Salinger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spielberg wanted to film Catcher In The Rye|date=5 December 2003|publisher=''[[Irish Examiner]]''|url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/entertainment/spielberg-wanted-to-film-catcher-in-the-rye-124346.html|accessdate=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Goonies 2'' ===
On June 6, 2005, [[Richard Donner]] stated that he and Spielberg had written a story for a film sequel of Donner's acclaimed ''[[The Goonies]]'', despite the fact that the main cast did not have any interest in reprising their roles for a sequel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/20390|title=Chunk says Goonies Never Say Die, news on GOONIES 2!|first=|last=staff|date=|website=aintitcool.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2008, [[Corey Feldman]] stated on his personal blog that a sequel was unlikely to happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://coreyfeldman.wordpress.com/2008/11/25/goonies-2-lost-boys-3truth-movement-digital-release-today/|author=truecorylove|work=The Feldman Journal|date=November 25, 2008|title=GOONIES 2?

=== ''OldBoy'' ===
Spielberg was attached to adapt the manga Oldboy in the late 2000's. Will Smith was set to star and it was reported to be based on the manga not the earlier film adaptation.

'''Teague''' is a global design consultancy headquartered in [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]]. Established in 1926 by [[Walter Dorwin Teague]], Teague is known for its design contributions through the disciplines of product design, interaction design, environmental design, and mechanical design. The privately held company is particularly recognized for its work in aviation and consumer goods, with clients such as [[The Boeing Company]], [[Microsoft]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Samsung]] and [[Panasonic Corporation|Panasonic]].

Teague's early role in consumer culture is most popularly associated with designs such as the first [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]] camera, the [[United Parcel Service|UPS]] truck, [[Texaco]] service stations, and the Pringles Chips canister; while [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] and the [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner]] headline Teague's post-2000 design work.&lt;ref name="Teague"&gt;[http://www.teague.com  Teague], "Work".&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the mid-1920s, Walter Dorwin Teague (1883 to 1960) was one of a group of individuals interested in pioneering the design of products for manufacturers as a distinct occupation. The illustrator and typographer departed an advertising career at New York-based Calkins &amp; Holden to establish Teague as a sole-proprietorship in 1926.&lt;ref name="Grove"&gt;''The Grove Encyclopedia of Decorative Arts,'' Gordon Campbell 2006 ed., Oxford University Press; Volume 2, p 437. {{ISBN|0-19-518948-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; As one of the first industrial design firms of its kind, Teague's value proposition was to improve the appearance, function and sales of clients' products, thereby strengthening businesses' brand image while translating the era's cultural context through tangible objects.&lt;ref name="Profile"&gt;Seldes, Gilbert, "Profiles: Industrial Classicist - Profile of Walter Dorwin Teague," ''New Yorker'', December 15, 1934.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WDTSD"&gt;"Walter Dorwin Teague: Industrial Designer Remembered," ''Business News - San Diego,'' December 19, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MOMAconf"&gt;''Industrial Design: A New Profession'', Minutes from Museum of Modern Art conference, New York, NY, 1946. MOMA archive 45.1 S624 1946&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Expansion===
Although product design culture was still limited to the wealthy through the 1930s, Teague pursued strategic relationships with businesses offering products to benefit the masses, citing a loss of concern for appearance in manufacturing when the Industrial Revolution replaced craftsmanship with machinery.&lt;ref name=Profile /&gt;&lt;ref name="Woodham"&gt;Woodham, Jonathan M., "Twentieth-Century Design," from ''Oxford History of Art''. Oxford University Press (USA), 1997. {{ISBN|0192842048}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dcsm"&gt;Teague, Walter Dorwin, "Design as a Construction Stimulant in Marketing," Reprinted from the ''Seventh International Management Congress'', Washington DC, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927, Teague was commissioned by [[Eastman Kodak]] to design cameras, and by the following year had co-located with Kodak in Upstate New York.&lt;ref name="QuarterCen"&gt;Teague, Walter Dorwin, "A Quarter Century of Industrial Design in the United States," ''Art &amp; Industry'', London, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; During what would become a thirty-year relationship, Teague designed some of Kodak's most iconic products, including the Baby Brownie, Super Six-20, Kodak Medalist, and the Kodak Bantam Special, one of the most popular cameras ever produced.&lt;ref name=Profile /&gt;&lt;ref name=QuarterCen /&gt;&lt;ref name="TEighty"&gt;"Teague80: 8 Decades of Influential Design." Published and printed by Walter Dorwin Teague Associates, copyright 2006, Seattle.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Baby Brownie had outsold any other camera ever made.&lt;ref name=WDTSD /&gt;

Teague expanded its portfolio in the early 1930s with: the Marmon 16, the first production automobile conceived by an industrial designer; 32 design patterns for Steuben Glass, a division of Corning Glass Works; and the design of passenger cars and diners for the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroads.&lt;ref name=Profile /&gt;&lt;ref name=QuarterCen /&gt;&lt;ref name=TEighty /&gt;  By 1938, Teague's office grew to 55 employees, including architects, engineers, 3D artists and industrial designers. Teague had also signed its first highly lucrative design retainer contract with Polaroid, culminating in the later development of the Land Camera, the first camera able to develop its own prints, introduced in 1948.&lt;ref name=QuarterCen /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fifty"&gt;Abercrombie, Stanley, "Fifty Years of Interior Design," ''Interiors'', New York, June 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental Design and Corporate Identity===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Texaco Station designed by Walter Dorwin Teague.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Texaco Station.|'''Corporate Identity emerges through Teague's design of the Texaco Station.''' In the 1930’s, Walter Dorwin Teague laid the foundation for corporate branding. Moving beyond a logo, the new brand identity included pumps, trucks, cans, signs and a well-executed station layout that that became the standard for all service stations through the 1950's.]] --&gt;Teague's product designs for Kodak evolved into the design of Kodak's offices, retail stores, and exhibitions at the New York World's Fair. The concept of "corporate identity" emerged from this cross-disciplined work of commercial design and the applied arts and science of creating the human-designed environment.&lt;ref name=Woodham /&gt;&lt;ref name=QuarterCen /&gt;&lt;ref name=TEighty /&gt;  Initiating the first corporate identity program of its kind, Teague created a full branding image for Texaco, including the design of full station layouts for Texaco service stations, pumps, trucks, cans and signs.&lt;ref name="LastMan"&gt;[http://www.core77.com/reactor/08.06_teague.asp DiTullo, Michael, “Last Man Standing: 80 years of Teague Design,” Core77, August 2006.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315133401/http://www.core77.com/reactor/08.06_teague.asp|date=2012-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TEighty /&gt;&lt;ref name=Fifty /&gt; Considered [[Art deco|Art Deco]] icons of their era, more than 20,000 of these Texaco stations had been built worldwide by 1960.&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt;[[File:National Cash Register Building.jpg|thumb|left|Designed for the 1939 New York World's Fair, the '''National Cash Register Building''' functioned not only as an exhibit center, but as the world's largest active cash register. The design showcases NCR's new 100 Model through the seven-story register atop the building.|alt=]]

===World Fairs===
In the 1930s and 1940s, Teague parlayed the new concept of corporate identity into designing corporate industrial exhibits for companies such as Con Edison, Du Pont, Kodak, US Steel, and the National Cash Register Company.&lt;ref name=QuarterCen /&gt; In 1933, Teague designed numerous displays for the Ford Motor Company at the Chicago Century of Progress Exposition, and expanded its showcase of architectural savvy through the design of the Texaco exhibition hall at the 1935 Texas Centennial Exposition in Dallas, Texas, as well as the Ford pavilion for the California Pacific International Exposition in San Diego, California (now housing the San Diego Aerospace Museum).&lt;ref name="Fairs"&gt;Keyes, Jacqueline Abbot, "The Fair - Demonstration of Modern Methods of Living," ''Art&amp; Industry'', December 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Ford Century of Progress Building.jpg|thumb|right|'''The Ford Exposition Building''', designed by Teague, featured at the 1939 New York World’s Fair. Consisting of four separate exhibits, the Ford exhibition embodied the 1939 “Building the World of Tomorrow” theme.]] --&gt;
Having designed multiple exhibitions at the New York World's Fair, including the Kodak Hall of Lights and the National Cash Register Building, Walter Dorwin Teague was invited to serve on its Board of Design, as well as design the Ford Exposition Building at [[1939 New York World's Fair|New York's World Fair of 1939]].&lt;ref name="Jet"&gt;Watts, Al, "Jet-Age Group Turns 50," ''Seattle Business Magazine'', June 14, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dict"&gt;Woodham, Jonathan M. ''A Dictionary of Modern Design.'' Oxford University Press, 2005. {{ISBN|0192800973}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teague would also later design the U.S. Science Center for the World's Fair in Seattle, as well as the "House of the Future" for the Festival of Gas at the [[1964/1965 New York World's Fair|1964 World's Fair]].&lt;ref name=Fifty /&gt;&lt;ref name=Fairs /&gt;&lt;ref name="AmDes"&gt;Votolato, Gregory. ''American Design in the Twentieth Century.'' Manchester and New York: Manchester University Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-7190-4530-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structure and Scope===
By the 1940s, product design culture had only just begun to come of age through consideration of a product's functional, technological, cultural and economic factors.&lt;ref name=AmDes /&gt; In 1945, a year after establishing an engineering division, Teague's corporate structure changed from a sole proprietorship to a partnership, allowing senior staff to be partners in the company. Profit-sharing increased employee retention and pride in ownership in the company encouraged project-successes.&lt;ref name="bionotes"&gt;''Biographical Notes of Walter Dorwin Teague''; Walter Dorwin Teague Associates, New York, 1951; Print, Teague Archives, accessed 2010 and 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Diversifying the firm's portfolio, Teague's projects included packaging for Ac'cent, a product for the [[International Minerals and Chemical Corporation]], equipment design for the Navy Bureau of Ordinance of the U.S. Navy, design of the UPS delivery truck&lt;ref name="IDSA"&gt;[http://www.idsa.org/walter-dorwin-teague  "Walter Dorwin Teague: 2007 Personal Recognition Winner,"] Industrial Designers Society of America, http://idsa.org, last accessed February 2, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and the visual styling of Steinway Pianos, the first of which is on display at the Smithsonian museum (as of 2012).&lt;ref name="smiths"&gt;[http://americanhistory.si.edu/steinwaydiary/annotations/?id=477  "Building a Relationship: The Steinways and the Smithsonian," Excerpt from ''The William Steinway Diary: 1861-1896''] of the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History, William Steinway Diary Project, http://americanhistory.si.edu (Last accessed February 2, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1940s also commenced Teague's collaborative relationship with The Boeing Company, which began in 1946&lt;ref name="SDTBoeing"&gt;"Design Firm's Boeing Link in 20th Year," ''Seattle Daily TImes,'' May 28, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; and continues to date, as of January 2012. (See [[#Aviation|Aviation]].)

===Post-War Decades: Product Packaging and Interior Design===
Products of mass-consumption and the expansion of pop culture in the 1950s strengthened the influence of industrial design in both public consciousness and big business.&lt;ref name=Woodham /&gt;&lt;ref name=dcsm /&gt; By the late 1950s, Teague expanded its work in product packaging design, creating a new corporate identity for Schaefer Beer. This early work would later lead to projects with [[Ivory soap]], [[Downy]], [[Comet (cleanser)|Comet cleanser]], [[Cheetos]], [[Scope (mouthwash)|Scope mouthwash]], [[Head &amp; Shoulders]], and [[Chiffon margarine]].&lt;ref name=LastMan /&gt;&lt;ref name=TEighty /&gt; With offices in New York and Seattle,&lt;ref name=QuarterCen /&gt;&lt;ref name="Luce"&gt;"Industrial Design," ''Luce'' Press Clipping, New York, NY, April 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; and design labs in several domestic and overseas locations, Teague strengthened its application of package design through the consumer revolution of the 1960s, forming lasting relationships with both Procter &amp; Gamble and the General Foods Corporation.&lt;ref name=Fifty /&gt;&lt;ref name="tinytubes"&gt;Duggan, Dennis, "Design--From Tiny Tubes to Giant Jets," ''Newsday - The Long Island Newspaper,'' May 11, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1973 oil crisis|Oil Crisis]] and anger toward American imperialism waned the mass-impact of industrial design for nearly two decades.&lt;ref name=AmDes /&gt; During the early 1970s, the majority of Teague's work was in architectural and interior design. In addition to banks, showrooms, museums, corporate headquarters, supermarkets and government facilities, Teague's largest space of interior design was for Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill's Air Force Academy in Colorado, where design work covered 3.5 million square feet of space, including dining halls, dormitory rooms, classrooms, and more than 60,000 objects.&lt;ref name="bigjob"&gt;"Air Force Academy Biggest Design Job," (UPI) ''Chicago Tribune,'' February 5, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1977, Walter Dorwin Teague Associates was larger than any of its competitors, employing roughly 150 designers, architect and technicians.&lt;ref name=Fifty /&gt;

As the Information Age and its new media culture surfaced, Teague continued collaborative work with key clients, such as [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] and Boeing, and established new client relationships that resulted in numerous classic package designs, including the Lays Potato Chips and Frito Corn Chips bags, the Pringles Potato Chips canister, Ivory, and the Scope Mouthwash Bottle.&lt;ref name=LastMan /&gt;&lt;ref name=WDTSD /&gt;&lt;ref name="chips"&gt;"Styles, William, "These Potato Chips are Reconstituted," ''The Cincinnati Post,'' May 7, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable post-1975 design achievements include the Kenworth Sleeper truck, the first truck designed to house a sleeper cabin, developed in 1976;&lt;ref name=Fifty /&gt; and the crew quarters for the NASA space station, designed in 1987.&lt;ref name="eyeair"&gt;"Smith, Susan, "Having an Eye for an Air of Comfort," ''Seattle Post Intelligencer'', April 21, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aviation==
Teague's history in aviation began with Boeing in 1946, when Teague designed the aircraft interior for the Boeing [[Boeing 377|Stratocruiser]]. The inverted figure-8 double deck fuselage provided 6,600 feet of interior space designed specifically for luxury air travel. The Stratocruiser's interior later inspired the iconic interior cabins of both the [[Boeing 707]] and [[Boeing 747|747 planes]].&lt;ref name=LastMan /&gt;&lt;ref name=TEighty/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jet /&gt;&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Boeing 787 Dreamliner Interior Architecture.jpg|thumb|left|The '''Boeing 787 Dreamliner''' is considered the most successful commercial airplane launch in the history of aviation, with more than 800 orders valued at over $150 billion (as of December 2011).]] --&gt;

The 707 aircraft model marked a "new flight era" for passengers, with more windows, a passenger service unit, illuminated seat-belt signs, and 1,300 square feet of interior space.&lt;ref name="AvHigh"&gt;Watkin, Richard, "Aviation High Style," ''The New York Times'', May 27, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; Boeing's 747, the world's first wide-body commercial jetliner, two and a half times the size of the 707, was used to create the Reagan-era [[Air Force One]] in 1988.  The Boeing-Teague team's Air-Force One project received tremendous media attention throughout its development, as the aircraft designed to transport the US President and White House staff included  100 telephones, two fully equipped kitchens, 16 televisions, seven bathrooms, 31 executive sleeper suites, and other extravagant amenities.&lt;ref name="WhiteHouse"&gt;"Bartel, Bill, and Tom Webb, "White House in the Sky," ''The Seattle Times,'' September 25, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, the collaborative team unveiled the [[Boeing 737]] interior and exterior design at the Paris Air Show, where eight years later the 777-200LR Worldliner would also premier, a model to break distance records during its "Going the Distance" world tour.&lt;ref name="BoeingSite"&gt;The Boeing Company official Website: "[http://www.boeing.com/commercial/products.html Commercial Airplanes] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110129205502/http://www.boeing.com/commercial/products.html |date=2011-01-29 }}" ("737","777" and "787"), last accessed on February 2, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2012, Boeing announced the 777 once again set a new record for orders in a single year (2011) at 200.&lt;ref name="mktwatch"&gt;[http://www.marketwatch.com/story/boeing-wraps-up-2011-with-record-breaking-order-announcements-2012-expected-to-be-year-of-the-737-max-2012-01-05  “Boeing Wraps up 2011 with Record-breaking Announcements”], ''The Wall Street Journal: Market Watch,'' Press release, January 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The Boeing-Teague team also developed the Boeing Skyloft Concept in 2005, a first-of-its-kind architectural transformation to create a new level of commercial space in cabin real estate.&lt;ref name=Teague /&gt;&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Emirates Airline First Class Cabin.jpg|thumb|right|A collaboration between Teague, Boeing, Emirates Airline and Pierrejean Design Studio, the 777 G6 First Class Cabin and Door 1 Entry has three-meter ceilings and dynamic LED lighting.]] --&gt;

The result of a five-year collaboration between Boeing and Teague, the [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner]] set new world records for distance and speed during an endurance flight around the world in 2011, the year of the 787's first delivery.&lt;ref name=mktwatch /&gt; Dubbed "The New Plane for the New World," the 787 is considered the most successful commercial airplane launch in aviation history.&lt;ref name=Teague /&gt;&lt;ref name=BoeingSite /&gt;

In 2006, Teague and Boeing celebrated the 60th year anniversary of collaborative aviation design.&lt;ref name=LastMan /&gt;

Teague's architectural innovation for jetliner interiors includes projects for global airlines, such as [[Singapore Airlines|Singapore]] and [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]] airlines. In 2008, Teague earned the international Red Dot Design award for Emirates Airline First-Class Cabin and Entry-Way, designed in collaboration with Boeing, Emirates, and Paris-based Pierrejean Studios to create a dramatic new cabin interior for the airline's 777-models.&lt;ref name=Teague /&gt;

Leading the proliferation of in-flight entertainment and communications, Teague has developed both hardware and software solutions for clients like [[Rockwell Collins, Inc.|Rockwell-Collins]] and [[Panasonic Avionics Corporation|Panasonic Avionics]], with whom Teague's relationship began in the early 1990s. [[Weber Aircraft LLC|Weber Aircraft]], Panasonic and Teague collaboratively developed the first ever fully integrated in-flight entertainment seat for commercial aircraft, the Panasonic Integrated Smart Monitor.&lt;ref name="mascorp"&gt;[http://www.mascorp.com/pressrelease/detail.aspx?PressReleaseID=61  "Panasonic Avionics Corporation's In-Flight Entertainment Systems Earn 'Hottest New Product Designs' Honors"], Press Release, Panasonic, mascorp.com, June 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Deleted image removed:  [[File:Xbox 360 Wireless Racing Wheel.jpg|thumb|right|The first gaming accessory of its kind, the '''Xbox 360 Wireless Racing Wheel''' combines real world automotive design cues with practical ergonomic solutions to immerse gamers in an authentic racing experience. ]] --&gt;

==New Millennium: Consumer Electronics==
At the turn of the millennium, leveraging collaborative relationships with A-list clients of the Digital Age, Teague's work focused heavily on consumer electronics.

In 2001, Seattle-based Microsoft called on Teague to co-design its first gaming console, the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]].&lt;ref name=TEighty /&gt; The project's success culminated in a series of additional collaborative projects between Microsoft and Teague. Expanding its client-base and award-winning portfolio in the consumer electronics market, Teague collaborated with companies such as Samsung, Panasonic, [[Gateway, Inc.|Gateway]], [[Intel Corporation|Intel]], LG, Hewlett-Packard, and T-Mobile. Widely acclaimed designs include the Samsung Portable Digital Projector, the Gateway One computer, the Xbox 360 Wireless Racing Wheel, and the Microsoft Shell Laptop.

In January 2012, Teague celebrated its 200th project with Microsoft.

==Mission &amp; Approach==
As part of Teague's post-millennium brand revival, the company reinstated the mission "Design This Day," the title of Walter Dorwin Teague's book, published in 1940. Outlining design techniques and philosophical perspectives, the book serves as Teague's timeless basis through which to approach design. From the book's preface: "What I have tried to do is to outline with reasonable clarity the technique that must be applied to the solution of any problem of design, whether it is a new motorcar or a new city or a new environment. If this technique is basically sound for one it will be sound for the others. It is a method of approach, a listing of the factors that must be dealt with if satisfactory order is to be created on a small or a large scale." –Walter Dorwin Teague, Aug 30, 1949.&lt;ref name="DTD"&gt;Teague, Walter Dorwin. ''Design This Day: The Technique of Order in the Machine Age.''(original title) New York: Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co., 1940; reprinted ''Design This Day'' (abridged) by Teague, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Company's business practice emphasizes collaboration and client-designer relationships, as Walter Dorwin Teague first publicly articulated at the 1946 Museum of Modern Art Conference in New York, "Industrial Design: A New Profession," wherein the meeting minutes reflect Teague's remark, "[W]e wait for the client to come to us."&lt;ref name=MOMAconf /&gt; Additionally, Teague has applied a "thinking through making" approach since its founding, using off-site laboratories to build full-scale mock-ups of designs, including aircraft interiors.

==Corporate==
In 2004, John Barratt signed on as Teague's President and CEO. {{As of|2012}}, Teague employs approximately 300 designers and support staff within the Seattle-based Aviation Studio and Design Studio.&lt;ref name="TMKTG"&gt;[http://www.teague.com  Teague]: Sarah Matheny, Director of Marketing, direct contact, contacted January 24, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Teague acquired a Munich-based design studio to expand into the European market.&lt;ref name="munich"&gt;[http://www.core77.com/blog/announcements/teague_goes_global_acquires_munich-based_consultancy_signce_19812.asp “Teague Goes Global: Acquires Munich-based consultancy, Signce”], ''Core77'', July 5, 2011 (posted by "corejr").&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Michelangelo, Giudizio Universale 03.jpg|thumb|330px|Mary and Christ]]
'''''The Last Judgment''''' ({{lang-it|Il Giudizio Universale}}&lt;ref name="museums"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Last Judgement|url=http://mv.vatican.va/3_EN/pages/x-Schede/CSNs/CSNs_G_Giud.html|publisher=Vatican Museums|access-date=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[fresco]] by the Italian Renaissance painter [[Michelangelo]] covering the whole [[altar]] wall of the [[Sistine Chapel]] in [[Vatican City]]. It is a depiction of the [[Second Coming of Christ]] and the [[Last Judgment|final and eternal judgment]] by God of all humanity. The souls of humans rise and descend to their fates, as judged by Christ who is surrounded by prominent [[saints]].  Altogether there are over 300 figures, with nearly all the males and angels originally shown as nudes; many were later partly covered up by painted draperies, of which some remain after recent cleaning and restoration. 

The work took over four years to complete between 1536 and 1541 (preparation of the altar wall began in 1535). Michelangelo began working on it twenty-five years after having finished the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]], and was nearly 67 at its completion.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt, 639&lt;/ref&gt;  Michelangelo originally accepted the commission from [[Pope Clement VII]], but it was completed under [[Pope Paul III]], whose stronger reforming views probably affected the final treatment.&lt;ref name="Freedberg_471"&gt;Freedberg, 471&lt;/ref&gt;

In the lower part of the fresco, Michelangelo followed tradition in showing the saved ascending at the left and the damned descending at the right. In the upper part, the inhabitants of Heaven are joined by the newly saved.  The fresco is more monochromatic than the ceiling frescoes and is dominated by the tones of flesh and sky. The cleaning and restoration of the fresco, however, revealed a greater chromatic range than previously apparent. Orange, green, yellow, and blue are scattered throughout, animating and unifying the complex scene.

The reception of the painting was mixed from the start, with much praise but also criticism on both religious and artistic grounds.  Both the amount of nudity and the muscular style of the bodies has been one area of contention, and the overall composition another.

== Description ==
Where traditional compositions generally contrast an ordered, harmonious heavenly world above with the tumultuous events taking place in the earthly zone below, in Michelangelo's conception the arrangement and posing of the figures across the entire painting give an impression of agitation and excitement,&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 184–185&lt;/ref&gt; and even in the upper parts there is "a profound disturbance, tension and commotion" in the figures.&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 187&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Sydney Joseph Freedberg|Sidney J. Freedberg]] interprets their "complex responses" as "those of giant powers here made powerless, bound by racking spiritual anxiety", as their role of intercessors with the deity had come to an end, and perhaps they regret some of the verdicts.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 471 (quoted), 473&lt;/ref&gt;  There is an impression that all the groups of figures are circling the central figure of Christ in a huge rotary movement.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt, 640; Freedberg, 471&lt;/ref&gt;

At the centre of the work is Christ, shown as the individual verdicts of the Last Judgement are pronounced; he looks down towards the damned.  He is beardless, and "compounded from antique conceptions of [[Hercules]], [[Apollo]], and [[Jupiter]] Fulminator",&lt;ref name="Freedberg_471" /&gt; probably, in particular, the [[Belvedere Apollo]], brought to the Vatican by [[Pope Julius II]].&lt;ref name="Khan"&gt;Khan&lt;/ref&gt;  However, there are parallels for his pose in earlier ''Last Judgments'', especially one in the [[Camposanto]] of [[Pisa]], which Michelangelo would have known; here the raised hand is part of a gesture of ''[[ostentatio vulnerum]]'' ("display of the wounds"), where the resurrected Christ reveals the wounds of his Crucifixion, which can be seen on Michelangelo's figure.&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 185; Hall, 187; [[:File:Buonamico buffalmacco Camposanto.jpg|Detail from Pisa]]&lt;/ref&gt;

To the left of Christ is his mother, [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]], who turns her head to look down towards the Saved, though her pose also suggests resignation.  It appears that the moment has passed for her to exercise her traditional role of pleading on behalf of souls; with [[John the Baptist]] this [[Deesis]] is a regular motif in earlier compositions.&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 185–186; Freedberg, 471; Barnes, 65–69; Murray, 10&lt;/ref&gt;  Preparatory drawings show her standing and facing Christ with arms outstretched, in a more traditional intercessory posture.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, 63–66&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Michelangelo - Cristo Juiz.jpg|thumb|330px|The central group around Christ]]
[[File:Michelangelo, giudizio universale, dettagli 33.jpg|thumb|330px|A group of the Saved]]

Surrounding Christ are large numbers of figures, the saints and other saved souls.  On a similar scale to Christ are John the Baptist on the left, and on the right [[Saint Peter]], holding the [[keys of Heaven]] and perhaps offering them back to Christ, as they will no longer be needed.&lt;ref name="Khan" /&gt;  Several of the main saints appear to be showing Christ their attributes, the evidence of the martyrdom. This used to be interpreted as the saints calling for the damnation of those who had not served the cause of Christ,&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 10&lt;/ref&gt; but other interpretations have become more common,&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 186&lt;/ref&gt; including that the saints are themselves not certain of their own verdicts, and try at the last moment to remind Christ of their sufferings.

Other prominent saints include [[Bartholomew the Apostle|Saint Bartholomew]] below Peter, holding the attribute of his martyrdom, his own skin.  The face on this is usually recognized as being a self-portrait of Michelangelo.&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 206; Hartt, 641; Khan&lt;/ref&gt;  Many others, even of the larger saints, are difficult to identify. [[Ascanio Condivi]], Michelangelo's tame authorized biographer, says that all of the [[Twelve Apostles]] are shown around Christ, "but he does not attempt to name them and would probably have had a difficult time doing so".&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, 72&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Michelangelo, giudizio universale, dettagli 38.jpg|thumb|350px|The damned in the air]]
The movements of the souls reflect the traditional pattern.  They arise from their graves at bottom left, and some continue upwards, helped in several cases by angels in the air (mostly without wings) or others on clouds, pulling them up.  Others, the damned, apparently pass over to the right, though none are quite shown doing so; there is a zone in the lower middle that is empty of souls.  A boat rowed by an aggressive [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]], who ferried souls to the Underworld in classical mythology (and [[Dante]]), brings souls to land beside the entrance to Hell; his threatening them with his oar is a direct borrowing from Dante.  [[Satan]], the traditional Christian devil is not shown, but another classical figure, [[Minos]], supervises the admission of the Damned into Hell; this was his role in Dante's ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]''.  He is generally agreed to have been given the features of [[Biagio da Cesena]], a critic of Michelangelo in the Papal court.&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 187–190; Freedberg, 471&lt;/ref&gt;

In the centre above Charon is a group of angels on clouds, seven blowing trumpets (as in the [[Book of Revelation]]), other holding books that record the names of the Saved and Damned.  To their right is a larger figure of a soul who has just realized that he is damned, and appears paralyzed with horror.  Two devils are pulling him downwards.  To the right of this devils pull down other souls; some are being pushed down by angels above them.&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 189; Khan&lt;/ref&gt;

== Choice of subject ==
[[File:'Sistine Chapel ceiling' by Michelangelo JBU21.JPG|thumb|330px|The ''Last Judgment'' at the end of the chapel]]
[[File:Michelangelo, giudizio universale, dettagli 51 inferno.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Charon (mythology)|Charon]] and his boat of damned souls]]
The [[Doom paintings|Last Judgment was a traditional subject]] for large church frescos, but it was unusual to place it at the east end, over the altar. The traditional position was on the west wall, over the main doors at the back of a church, so that the congregation took this reminder of their options away with them on leaving. It might be either painted on the interior, as for example by [[Giotto]] at the [[Arena Chapel]], or in a sculpted [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] on the exterior.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 186–187; Sistine, 181; Hartt, 640; Hughes&lt;/ref&gt;  However, a number of late medieval panel paintings, mostly altarpieces, were based on the subject with similar compositions, although adapted to a horizontal picture space.  These include the ''[[Beaune Altarpiece]]'' by [[Rogier van der Weyden]], and ones by artists such as [[The Last Judgment (Fra Angelico, Florence)|Fra Angelico]], [[The Last Judgment (Memling)|Hans Memling]] and [[The Last Judgment (Bosch triptych)|Hieronymus Bosch]].  Many aspects of Michelangelo's composition reflect the well-established traditional Western depiction, but with a fresh and original approach.&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 182–184&lt;/ref&gt;

Most traditional versions had a figure of ''[[Christ in Majesty]]'' in about the same position as Michelangelo's, and even larger than his, with a greater disproportion in scale to the other figures.  As here, compositions contained large numbers of figures, divided between angels and saints around Christ at the top, and the souls being judged below.  Typically there is a strong contrast between the ordered ranks of figures in the top part, and chaotic and frenzied activity below, especially on the right side that leads to Hell.  The flow of souls usually began at the bottom (viewer's) left, as here, as resurrected souls rise from their graves and move towards judgement. Some pass judgement and continue upwards or to the left, to join the company in heaven, while others pass over to the right and then downwards towards Hell in the bottom right corner (compositions had difficulty incorporating [[Purgatory]] visually).&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 187; Hartt, 640; Hughes&lt;/ref&gt;  The damned souls may be shown naked, as a mark of their humiliation as devils carry them off, and sometimes the newly-resurrected souls too, but angels and those in Heaven are fully dressed, their clothing a main clue to the identity of groups and individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt, 640; Clark, 300–310 for a famous account of nudity in medieval religious art.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Before starting ==
The project was a long time in gestation.  It was probably first proposed in 1533, but was not then attractive to Michelangelo. A number of letters and other sources describe the original subject as a "Resurrection", but it seems most likely that this was always meant in the sense of the General [[Resurrection of the Dead]], followed in [[Christian eschatology]] by the Last Judgment, rather than the [[Resurrection of Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 180; Hughes; Vasari, 269&lt;/ref&gt;  Other scholars believe there was indeed a substitution of the more sombre final subject, reflecting the emerging mood of the [[Counter-Reformation]], and an increase in the area of the wall to be covered.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 471; Hartt, 639 (both rather older sources than those taking the contrary view, which may be relevant).&lt;/ref&gt;  A number of Michelangelo's drawings from the early 1530s develop a ''Resurrection of Jesus''.&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 180; Hughes&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vasari]], alone among contemporary sources, says that originally Michelangelo was intended to paint the other end wall with a [[War in Heaven|Fall of the Rebel Angels]] to match.&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 178–180; Vasari, 269&lt;/ref&gt;  By April 1535 the preparation of the wall was begun, but it was over a year before painting began.  Michelangelo stipulated the filling-in of two narrow windows, the removal of three [[cornice]]s, and building the surface increasingly forward as it rises, to give a single uninterrupted wall surface slightly leaning out, by about 11 inches over the height of the fresco.&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 31, 178; Murray, 12&lt;/ref&gt;

The preparation of the wall led to the end of more than twenty years of friendship between Michelangelo and [[Sebastiano del Piombo]], who tried to persuade the Pope and Michelangelo to do the painting in his preferred technique of oil on plaster, and managed to get the smooth plaster finish needed for this applied.  It is possible that around this stage the idea was floated that Sebastiano would do the actual painting, to Michelangelo's designs, as they had collaborated nearly 20 years earlier. After, according to Vasari, some months of passivity, Michelangelo furiously insisted that it should be in fresco, and had the wall re-plastered in the rough ''[[arriccio]]'' needed as a base for fresco.&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 178; Vasari covers this in his [http://members.efn.org/~acd/vite/VasariSebastianoPiombo.html life of Sebastiano]&lt;/ref&gt;  It was on this occasion that he famously said that [[oil painting]] was "an art for women and for leisurely and idle people like Fra Sebastiano".&lt;ref&gt;Vasari, [http://members.efn.org/~acd/vite/VasariSebastianoPiombo.html "Life of Sebastiano del Piombo"] (near the end)&lt;/ref&gt;

The new fresco required, unlike his Sistine Chapel ceiling, considerable destruction of existing art. There was an [[altarpiece]] of the [[Assumption of Mary]] by [[Pietro Perugino]] above the altar, for which a drawing survives in the [[Albertina]],&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 31, 34&lt;/ref&gt; flanked by tapestries to [[Raphael Cartoons|designs by Raphael]]; these, of course, could just be used elsewhere. Above this zone, there were two paintings from the 15th-century cycles of Moses and Christ which still occupy the middle zone of the side walls.  These were probably Perugino's ''[[Finding of Moses]]'' and the ''[[Adoration of the Kings]]'', beginning both cycles.&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 51&lt;/ref&gt;  Above them were the first of the series of standing popes in niches, including [[Saint Peter]] himself, probably as well as a [[Saint Paul]] and a central figure of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 32, 79&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the project required the destruction of two [[lunette]]s with the first two ''Ancestors of Christ'' from Michelangelo's own ceiling scheme.&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 180&lt;/ref&gt;  However, some of these works may have already been damaged by an accident in April 1525, when the [[altar curtain]]s went on fire; the damage done to the wall is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 33&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Michelangelo, giudizio universale, dettagli 35.jpg|thumb|350px|The Resurrection of the Dead]]

The structure of the chapel, built in a great hurry in the 1470s,&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 27–28&lt;/ref&gt; had given trouble from the start, with frequent cracks appearing. At Christmas in 1525 a [[Pontifical Swiss Guard|Swiss Guard]] was killed when entering the chapel with the pope when the stone [[lintel]] to the doorway split and fell on him.&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 31–33&lt;/ref&gt;  The site is on sandy soil, draining a large area, and the preceding "Great Chapel" had had similar problems.&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 32–33&lt;/ref&gt;

The new scheme for the altar wall and other changes necessitated by structural problems led to a loss of symmetry and "continuity of window-rhythms and cornices", as well as some of the most important parts of the previous iconographical schemes.&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 38 (quoted), 184&lt;/ref&gt;  As shown by drawings, the initial conception for the ''Last Judgement'' was to leave the existing altarpiece and work round it, stopping the composition below the frescos of Moses and Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sistine Chapel was dedicated to the ''Assumption of the Virgin'', which had been the subject of Perugino's altarpiece. Once it was decided to remove this, it appears that a tapestry of the ''[[Coronation of the Virgin]]'', a subject often linked to the ''Assumption'', was commissioned, which was hung above the altar for important liturgical occasions in the 18th century, and perhaps from the 1540s until then.  The tapestry has a vertical format (it is {{convert|4.3|by|3|m}}), and is still in the [[Vatican Museums]].&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, 65–66&lt;/ref&gt;  A print of 1582 shows the chapel in use, with a large cloth of roughly this shape hanging behind the altar, and a canopy over it. The cloth is shown as plain, but the artist also omits the paintings below the ceiling, and may well not have been present himself, but working from prints and descriptions.

== Reception and later changes ==
[[File:Michelangelo, Giudizio Universale 29.jpg|thumb|350px|Group of the damned, with [[Biagio da Cesena]] as [[Minos]] at right]]
[[File:Marcello Venusti Juicio Universal Tempera Grassa sobre tabla 1549 Museo di Capodimonte.jpg|350px|thumb|1549 copy of the still unretouched mural by [[Marcello Venusti]] ([[Museo di Capodimonte]], Naples).]]
=== Religious objections ===
''The Last Judgment'' became controversial as soon as it was seen, with disputes between critics in the Catholic [[Counter-Reformation]] and supporters of the genius of the artist and the style of the painting. Michelangelo was accused of being insensitive to proper [[decorum]], in respect of nudity and other aspects of the work, and of pursuing artistic effect over following the scriptural description of the event.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 112–114, 118–119; Sistine, 190–198; Khan&lt;/ref&gt;

On a preview visit with Paul III, before the work was complete, the pope's Master of Ceremonies [[Biagio da Cesena]] is reported by Vasari as saying that: "it was most disgraceful that in so sacred a place there should have been depicted all those nude figures, exposing themselves so shamefully, and that it was no work for a papal chapel but rather for the public baths and taverns".&lt;ref name="Vasari_274"&gt;Vasari, 274&lt;/ref&gt;  Michelangelo immediately worked Cesena's face from memory into the scene as [[Minos]],&lt;ref name="Vasari_274" /&gt; judge of the underworld (far bottom-right corner of the painting) with [[donkey ears]] (i.e. indicating foolishness), while his nudity is covered by a coiled snake. It is said that when Cesena complained to the Pope, the pontiff joked that his jurisdiction did not extend to Hell, so the portrait would have to remain.&lt;ref&gt;Reported by [[Lodovico Domenichi]] in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=_2g8AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=RA5-PA668 Historia di detti et fatti notabili di diversi Principi &amp; huommi privati moderni]'' (1556), p. 668&lt;/ref&gt;  Pope Paul III himself was attacked by some for commissioning and protecting the work, and came under pressure to alter if not entirely remove the ''Last Judgement'', which continued under his successors.&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 192–194&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Marcello venusti, santi biagio e caterina prima della censura, 1549.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Marcello Venusti]]'s copy; detail showing an uncensored version of [[Catherine of Alexandria|St. Catherine]] at the bottom left while above her, the figure at the left had a different head position]]
[[File:Michelangelo, Giudizio Universale 28.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Daniele da Volterra]]'s new [[Catherine of Alexandria|St. Catherine]]]]

The mixing of figures from pagan mythology into depictions of Christian subject matter was objected to.  As well as the figures of Charon and Minos, and wingless angels, the very classicized Christ was objected to.  Beardless Christs had in fact only finally disappeared from Christian art some four centuries earlier, but Michelangelo's figure was unmistakenly Apollonian.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 61; Sistine, 190; Blunt, 114&lt;/ref&gt;

Further objections related to failures to follow the scriptural references. The angels blowing trumpets are all in one group, whereas in the Book of Revelation they are sent to "the four corners of the earth".  Christ is not seated on a throne, contrary to Scripture.  Such draperies as Michelangelo painted are often shown as blown by wind, but it was claimed that all weather would cease on the Day of Judgement.  The resurrected souls are in mixed condition, some skeletons but most appearing with their flesh intact.  All these objections were eventually collected in a book, the ''Due Dialogi'' published just after Michelangelo's death in 1564, by the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] theologian [[Giovanni Andrea Gilio]] (da Fabriano), who had become one of several theologians policing art during and after the Council of Trent.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 112–114; Barnes, 84–86; Sistine, 192&lt;/ref&gt;  As well as theological objections, Gilio objected to artistic devices like [[foreshortening]] that puzzled or distracted untrained viewers.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, 84&lt;/ref&gt;

Two decades after the fresco was completed, the final session of the [[Council of Trent]] in 1563 finally enacted a form of words that reflected the [[Counter-Reformation art#Council of Trent|Counter-Reformation attitudes to art]] that had been growing in strength in the Church for some decades.  The Council's decree (drafted at the last minute and generally very short and inexplicit) reads in part : {{Quote|Every superstition shall be removed ... all lasciviousness be avoided;  in such wise that figures shall not be painted or adorned with a beauty exciting to lust... there be nothing seen that is disorderly, or that is unbecomingly or confusedly arranged, nothing that is profane, nothing indecorous, seeing that holiness becometh the house of God. And that these things may be the more faithfully observed, the holy Synod ordains, that no one be allowed to place, or cause to be placed, any unusual image, in any place, or church, howsoever exempted, except that image have been approved of by the bishop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Aldersey-Williams|first=Hugh|title=A History of the Fig Leaf|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/history/2013/07/the_fig_leaf_in_painting_and_sculpture_excerpt_from_anatomies_by_hugh_aldersey.html|work=16 July 2013|publisher=Slate|accessdate=28 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

There was an explicit decree that: "The pictures in the Apostolic Chapel should be covered over, and those in other churches should be destroyed, if they display anything that is obscene or clearly false".&lt;ref&gt;Decision of January 21, 1564, quoted Sistine, 269, n. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

The defences by Vasari and others of the painting evidently made some impact on clerical thinking. In 1573, when [[Paolo Veronese]] was summoned before the Venetian Inquisition to justify his inclusion of "buffoons, drunken Germans, dwarfs, and other such absurdities" in what was then called a painting of the [[Last Supper]] (later renamed as ''[[The Feast in the House of Levi]]''), he tried to implicate Michelangelo in a comparable breach of decorum, but was promptly rebuffed by the inquisitors,&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 23&lt;/ref&gt; as the transcript records:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
Q. Does it seem suitable to you, in the Last Supper of our Lord, to represent buffoons, drunken Germans, dwarfs, and other such absurdities?&lt;br /&gt;
A. Certainly not.&lt;br /&gt;
Q. Then why have you done it?&lt;br /&gt;
A. I did it on the supposition that those people were outside the room in which the Supper was taking place.&lt;br /&gt;
Q. Do you not know that in Germany and other countries infested by heresy, it is habitual, by means of pictures full of absurdities, to vilify and turn to ridicule the things of the Holy Catholic Church, in order to teach false doctrine to ignorant people who have no common sense?&lt;br /&gt;
A. I agree that it is wrong, but I repeat what I have said, that it is my duty to follow the examples given me by my masters.&lt;br /&gt;
Q. Well, what did your masters paint? Things of this kind, perhaps?&lt;br /&gt;
A. In Rome, in the Pope's Chapel, Michelangelo has represented Our Lord, His Mother, St. John, St. Peter, and the celestial court; and he has represented all these personages nude, including the Virgin Mary [this last not true], and in various attitudes not inspired by the most profound religious feeling.&lt;br /&gt;
Q. Do you not understand that in representing the Last Judgment, in which it is a mistake to suppose that clothes are worn, there was no reason for painting any? But in these figures what is there that is not inspired by the Holy Spirit? There are neither buffoons, dogs, weapons, nor other absurdities....&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.efn.org/~acd/Veronese.html Transcript translated per] Crawford, Francis Marion: "Salve Venetia".

=== Revisions to the painting ===
Some action to meet the criticism and enact the decision of the council had become inevitable, and the genitalia in the fresco were painted over with drapery by the Mannerist painter [[Daniele da Volterra]], probably mostly after Michelangelo died in 1564.  Daniele was "a sincere and fervent admirer of Michelangelo" who kept his changes to a minimum, and had to be ordered to go back and add more,&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 193–194, 194 quoted; Freedberg, 477–485, 485 on the overpainting; Blunt, 119&lt;/ref&gt; and for his trouble got the nickname "Il Braghettone", meaning "the breeches maker".  He also chiseled away and entirely repainted the larger part of [[Saint Catherine of Alexandria|Saint Catherine]] and the entire figure of [[Saint Blaise]] behind her. This was done because in the original version Blaise had appeared to look at Catherine's naked behind, and because to some observers the position of their bodies suggested sexual intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 194: Barnes, 86–87&lt;/ref&gt;  The repainted version shows Blaise looking away from Saint Catherine, upward towards Christ.

His work, beginning in the upper parts of the wall, was interrupted when [[Pope Pius IV]] died in December 1565 and the chapel needed to be free of scaffolding for the funeral and conclave to elect the next pope. [[El Greco]] had made a helpful offer to repaint the entire wall with a fresco that was "modest and decent, and no less well painted than the other".&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 119&lt;/ref&gt;  Further campaigns of overpainting, often "less discreet or respectful", followed in later reigns, and "the threat of total destruction ... re-surfaced in the pontificates of [[Pius V]], [[Gregory XIII]], and probably again of [[Clement VIII]]".&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 194&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Anthony Blunt]], "rumours were current in 1936 that [[Pius XI]] intended to continue the work".&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 119, note&lt;/ref&gt;  In total, nearly 40 figures had drapery added, apart from the two repainted. These additions were in [[fresco secco|"dry" fresco]], which made them easier to remove in the most recent restoration (1990–94), when about 15 were removed, from those added after 1600. It was decided to leave 16th-century changes.&lt;ref&gt;Partridge (see Further reading) summarized (with comments) in notes 32 and 33 on p. 204 of Dillenberger, John, ''Images and Relics: Theological Perceptions and Visual Images in Sixteenth-century Europe'', 1999, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-512172-4}}, 9780195121728, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qubuIWylVJUC&amp;pg=PA204 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

At a relatively early date, probably in the 16th century, a strip of about 18 inches was lost across the whole width of the bottom of the fresco, as the altar and its backing was modified.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 12&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Artistic criticism ===
==== Contemporary ====
As well as the criticism on moral and religious grounds, there was from the start considerable criticism based on purely aesthetic considerations, which had hardly been seen at all in initial reactions to Michelangelo's [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]].  Two key figures in the first wave of criticism were [[Pietro Aretino]] and his friend [[Lodovico Dolce]], a prolific Venetian [[Renaissance humanist|humanist]].  Aretino had made considerable efforts to become as close to Michelangelo as he was to [[Titian]], but had always been rebuffed; "in 1545 his patience gave way, and he wrote to Michelangelo that letter on the ''Last Judgement'' which is now famous as an example of insincere prudishness",&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 194–196; Blunt, 122–124, 123 quoted; Barnes, 74–84&lt;/ref&gt; a letter written with a view to publication.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, 74&lt;/ref&gt;  Aretino had not in fact seen the finished painting, and based his criticisms on one of the [[old master print|prints]] that had been quickly brought to market.  He "purports to represent the simple folk" in this new wider audience.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, 82&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it appears that at least the print-buying public preferred the uncensored version of the paintings, as most prints showed this well into the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, 88&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vasari]] responded to this and other criticisms in the 1st edition of his ''Life of Michelangelo'' in 1550.  Dolce followed up in 1557 with a published dialogue, ''L'Aretino'', almost certainly a collaborative effort with his friend.  Many of the arguments of the theologian critics are repeated, but now in the name of decorum rather than religion, emphasizing that the particular and very prominent location of the fresco made the amount of nudity unacceptable; a convenient argument for Aretino, some of whose projects were frankly pornographic, but intended for private audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 194–196; Blunt, 122–124&lt;/ref&gt;  Dolce also complains that Michelangelo's female figures are hard to distinguish from males, and his figures show "anatomical exhibitionism"; criticisms many have echoed.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes; Sistine, 195–196; Blunt, 65–66; Friedländer, 17&lt;/ref&gt;

On these points, a long-lasting rhetorical comparison of Michelangelo and [[Raphael]] developed, in which even supporters such as Vasari participated.  Raphael is held up as the exemplar of all the grace and decorum found lacking in Michelangelo, whose outstanding quality was called by Vasari his ''[[terribiltà]]'', the awesome, sublime or (the literal meaning) terror-inducing quality of his art.&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 194–198; Blunt, 76, 99; Vasari, 269, note on translating ''terribiltà/terribilità''&lt;/ref&gt;  Vasari came to partly share this view by the time of the expanded 2nd edition of his ''Lives'', published in 1568, though he explicitly defended the fresco on several points raised by the attackers (without mentioning them), such as the decorum of the fresco, and "amazing diversity of the figures", and asserted it was "directly inspired by God", and a credit to the Pope and his "future renown".&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 99; Vasari, 276&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Modern ====
[[File:Michelangelo, giudizio universale, dettagli 22.jpg|thumb|350px|Angels at the top left, one with the [[Crown of Thorns]]]]
[[File:Michelangelo, Giudizio Universale 31.jpg|thumb|350px|Saint Bartholomew displaying his flayed skin, with the face of Michelangelo]]
In many respects, modern art historians discuss the same aspects of the work as 16th-century writers: the general grouping of the figures, and rendering of space and movement, the distinctive depiction of anatomy, the nudity and use of colour, and sometimes the theological implications of the fresco. However, Bernadine Barnes points out that no 16th-century critic echoes in the slightest the view of [[Anthony Blunt]] that: "This fresco is the work of a man shaken out of his secure position, no longer at ease with the world, and unable to face it directly.  Michelangelo does not now deal directly with the visible beauty of the physical world".&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, 71, quoting and discussing Blunt, 65&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time, continues Barnes, "it was censured as the work of an arrogant man, and it was justified as a work that made celestial figures more beautiful than natural".&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, 71&lt;/ref&gt;  Many other modern critics take similar lines to Blunt, like him emphasizing Michelangelo's "tendency away from the material and towards the things of the spirit" in his last decades.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 70–81, 70 quoted; Freedberg, 469–477&lt;/ref&gt;

In theology, the [[Second Coming]] of Christ ended space and time.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite this, "Michelangelo’s curious representation of space", where "the characters inhabit individual spaces that cannot be combined consistently", is often commented on.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, quoted; Friedländer, 16–18; Freedberg, 473–474&lt;/ref&gt;

Quite apart from the question of decorum, the rendering of anatomy has been often discussed. Writing of "energy" in the nude figure, [[Kenneth Clark]] has:&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 204&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The twist into depth, the struggle to escape from the here and now of the picture plane, which had always distinguished Michelangelo from the Greeks, became the dominating rhythm of his later works.  That colossal nightmare, the Last Judgement, is made up of such struggles.  It is the most overpowering accumulation in all art of bodies in violent movement"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Of the figure of Christ, Clark says: "Michelangelo has not tried to resist that strange compulsion which made him thicken a torso until it is almost square..".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 61&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sydney Joseph Freedberg|S.J. Freedberg]] commented that "The vast repertory of anatomies that Michelangelo conceived for the ''Last Judgement'' seems often to have been determined more by the requirements of art than by compelling needs of meaning ... meant not just to entertain but to overpower us with their effects. Often, too, the figures assume attitudes of which a major sense is one of ornament..."&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 473–474&lt;/ref&gt;  He notes that the two frescos in the [[Cappella Paolina]], Michelangelo's last paintings, begun in November 1542, almost immediately after the ''Last Judgement'', show from the start a major change in style, away from grace and aesthetic effect to an exclusive concern with illustrating the narrative, with no regard for beauty.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 475–477&lt;/ref&gt;

== Restoration, 1980–1994 ==
{{Main|Restoration of the Sistine Chapel frescoes}}
Early appreciations of the fresco had especially mentioned the colours, especially in small details, but over the centuries the build-up of dirt on the surface had largely hidden these.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes; compare Hartt, 641, probably not revised to reflect the restoration.&lt;/ref&gt;  The built-out wall led to extra deposition of soot from candles on the altar.  In 1953 (admittedly in November) [[Bernard Berenson]] put in his diary: "The ceiling looks dark, gloomy. The ''Last Judgment'' even more so... how difficult to make up our minds that these Sistine frescoes are nowadays scarcely enjoyable in the original and much more so in photographs".&lt;ref&gt;Berenson, 34&lt;/ref&gt;

The fresco was restored along with the Sistine vault between 1980 and 1994 under the supervision of Fabrizio Mancinelli, the [[curator]] of post-classical collections of the [[Vatican Museums]] and Gianluigi Colalucci, head restorer at the Vatican laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 5–7&lt;/ref&gt;  During the course of the restoration, about half of the censorship of the "[[fig leaf|Fig-Leaf Campaign]]" was removed. Numerous pieces of buried details, caught under the smoke and grime of scores of years were revealed after the restoration. It was discovered that the fresco of Biagio de Cesena as Minos with donkey ears was being bitten in the genitalia by a coiled snake.

== Inserted self-portrait ==
Most writers agree that Michelangelo depicted his own face in the flayed skin of [[Bartholomew the Apostle|St. Bartholomew]] (see [[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)#Modern|above]]).  [[Edgar Wind]] saw this as "a prayer for redemption, that through the ugliness of the outward man might be thrown off, and the inward man resurrected pure", in a [[Neoplatonist]] mood, one that Aretino detected and objected to.&lt;ref&gt;Wind, 185–190, 188 quoted; Sistine, 206&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dixon-chapter-2"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.crucifixion.com/visual/theology/johndixon/terror.htm|title= The Terror of Salvation: The Last Judgment|accessdate= 2007-08-01|author= Dixon, John W.

The bearded figure of St. Bartholomew holding the skin was sometimes thought to have the features of Aretino, but open conflict between Michelangelo and Aretino did not occur until 1545, several years after the fresco's completion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Steinberg|first=Leo|title=The Line of Fate in Michelangelo's Painting|journal=Critical Inquiry|year=1980|volume=6|issue=3|pages=411–454|doi=10.1086/448058}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Poseidon Adventure''''' is a 1972 American [[disaster film]] directed by [[Ronald Neame]], produced by [[Irwin Allen]], and based on [[Paul Gallico]]'s [[The Poseidon Adventure (novel)|eponymous 1969 novel]]. It features an [[ensemble cast]], including five [[Academy Award]] winners: [[Gene Hackman]], [[Ernest Borgnine]], [[Jack Albertson]], [[Shelley Winters]], and [[Red Buttons]]. Parts of the movie were filmed aboard the {{RMS|Queen Mary}}. The plot centers on the fictional [[Poseidon (fictional ship)|SS ''Poseidon'']], an aged luxury liner on her final voyage from [[New York City]] to [[Athens]] before being sent to the scrapyard. On [[New Year's Eve]], she is [[Capsizing|overturned]] by a [[tsunami]]. Passengers and crew are trapped inside, and a rebellious preacher attempts to lead a small group of survivors to safety.

It is in the vein of other all-star [[disaster film]]s of the early-mid 1970s such as ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'' (1970), ''[[Earthquake (1974 film)|Earthquake]]'' (1974), and ''[[The Towering Inferno]]'' (1974). By the end of 1974, it was regarded as a widely successful film. The film won two [[Academy Award]]s,&lt;ref name="Oscars1973"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1973 |title=The 45th Academy Awards (1973) Nominees and Winners |accessdate=2011-08-28|website=oscars.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Golden Globe Award]], a [[British Academy Film Awards|British Academy Film Award]], and a [[Motion Picture Sound Editors|Motion Picture Sound Editors Award]].&lt;ref name="NY Times"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/38807/The-Poseidon-Adventure/awards |title=NY Times: The Poseidon Adventure |accessdate=2008-12-28|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1979 sequel, ''[[Beyond the Poseidon Adventure]]'', was also based on a novel by Gallico but was a commercial and critical failure.

==Plot==
The S.S. ''Poseidon'', an ocean liner slated for retirement, is on her way to [[Athens]]. Despite protests from the captain, who fears for the ship's safety, the new owner's representative insists he go full speed to save money, preventing him from taking on [[Ballast tank|ballast]].

Reverend Scott, a minister believing that "[[God helps those who help themselves]]", is travelling to a new parish in Africa as a punishment for his unorthodox views. Detective Lt. Rogo and wife Linda, a former [[prostitute]], deal with her seasickness. Susan and younger brother Robin are traveling to meet their parents. Robin is interested in how the ship works and frequently visits the engine room. Retired [[Jewish]] store owner Manny Rosen and wife Belle are going to [[Israel]] to meet their young grandson for the first time. [[Haberdasher]] James Martin is a love-shy, health-conscious bachelor. The ship's singer, Nonnie Parry, rehearses for the [[New Year's Day]] celebration.

Passengers gather in the dining room to celebrate. The captain is called to the bridge in response to a report of an undersea [[earthquake]]. He receives word from the lookout that a huge [[tsunami]] is approaching from the direction of [[Crete]] at 60&amp;nbsp;[[knot (unit)|knots]]. He issues a [[Mayday (distress signal)|mayday distress signal]] and commands a "hard left" turn into the wave. The ship is unable to turn in time and is hit broadside, causing it to capsize.

In the dining room, survivors take stock of their predicament. Acres, an injured waiter, is trapped at the galley door now high above. Scott surmises that the escape route will be found "upwards", at the outer hull, now above water. Robin tells him the hull near the propeller shaft is only one inch (25.4&amp;nbsp;mm) thick. The Rosens, the Rogos, Susan, Robin, Acres, Nonnie, and Martin agree to go with Scott, using a Christmas tree as a ladder. Scott unsuccessfully tries convincing more passengers to join them. After the group climbs to the galley, there is a series of explosions. As seawater floods the dining room, those remaining attempt to climb the tree, but their weight causes it to fall. The water fills up the room and the ''Poseidon'' begins sinking.

Scott leads his group upward through the ship's hull, toward the engine room. While climbing a ladder inside a ventilation shaft, the ship rocks from more explosions. Acres falls and perishes despite Rogo's attempt to save him. Leaving the shaft, the group meets a large band of survivors led by the ship's medic, heading toward the bow. Scott believes they are heading for their doom, but Rogo wants to follow them and gives Scott 15 minutes to find the engine room. Although he takes longer than allowed, Scott succeeds.

The group discovers the engine room is on the other side of a flooded corridor. Belle reveals she is a former competitive swimmer and volunteers to go through, but Scott refuses her and dives in. Halfway through, a panel collapses on him. The survivors notice something is wrong, and Belle dives in. She frees Scott and they make it to the other side, but Belle suffers a [[heart attack]]. Before dying, she tells Scott to give her [[Chai (symbol)|Chai]] pendant to her husband, who in turn will give it to their grandson. Rogo swims over to make sure Belle and Scott are all right, then leads the rest over. When Rosen finds Belle's dead body, he is unwilling to go on, but Scott gives him her pendant, reminding him that he has a reason to live.

Scott leads the survivors to the propeller shaft room's watertight door, but another series of explosions causes Linda to fall to her death. A heartbroken Rogo blames her death on Scott. A ruptured pipe releases steam, blocking their escape. Scott rants at God for the survivors' deaths. He leaps and grabs onto the burning-hot valve wheel to shut off the steam, then tells Rogo to lead the group before letting go of it, falling to his death in the flaming water below.

Rogo leads the remaining survivors—Rosen, Martin, Nonnie, Susan, and Robin—through the watertight doors and into the propeller shaft tunnel. They hear a noise from outside and bang on the hull to attract attention. The rescuers cut a hole through the hull, assist the sole group of six survivors from the ship, and fly them to safety.

==Sequel and remakes==
A 1979 sequel, ''[[Beyond the Poseidon Adventure]]'', which was also based on a novel by Gallico,  was released later with an equally star-studded cast, but was a commercial and critical failure. In 1998, several episodes of the daytime soap ''[[Sunset Beach (TV series)|Sunset Beach]]'' entitled "Shockwave" revolved around an earthquake and tsunami in California and major parts of the episodes take place on a cruise ship, the S.S. ''Neptune'' that is capsized by the giant wave. The episode borrowed heavily from the plot line of ''The Poseidon Adventure'' and garnered huge audiences and spurring NBC to repeat it several weeks later in prime time. ''The Poseidon Adventure'' was remade twice, first as a [[The Poseidon Adventure (2005 film)|television special in 2005]] with the same name, and as a theatrical release titled ''[[Poseidon (film)|Poseidon]]'' in 2006.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2441">'''The V-Girls''' was a [[Feminist art|feminist]] [[performance art]] group that was active from [[1986 in art|1986]] to [[1996 in art|1996]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Weems, Marianne |author2=Chalmers, Jessica |author3=Fraser, Andrea |author4=Baer, Martha |author5=Cramer, Erin |date=1 January 1995|title=The V-Girls: Daughters of the ReVolution|url=|journal=October|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The V-Girls were composed of Martha Baer, Jessica Chalmers, Erin Cramer, [[Marianne Weems]] and [[Andrea Fraser]]. The group was initially formed as a study group in order to meet-up and read feminist [[psychoanalytic theory]], but soon morphed into discussions of their own art and scholarship.

The V-Girls were influenced by feminist inquiry in relation to institutions, such as universities. Feminist discussions regarding power relations, the status of women, and canon development lead to the need for ways of challenging normalised phallocentric ideas.

==Performance style==
The five women would sit at a long table in order to form a discussion panel. Four of them would be dressed in suits with thickly framed glasses, symbols of traditional power and intellect. The fifth would act as the discussion's mediator and usually be dressed more casually, indicating a symbolic separation of social status. The panel would provide a comedic critique of various professional discourses within the spaces in which they originated, such as conferences, universities, art galleries and museums.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Zita Grover, "The Misrepresentation of Misrepresentation: Jan Zita Grover Turns Her Gaze on the V-Girls," The Women's Review of Books 6, no. 10/11 (1989): 13&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key works==
The V-Girls first performance was titled ''Sex and Your Holiday Season'' and was performed in 1987 at Four Walls gallery in New Jersey.

''Academic in the Alps: In Search of the Swiss Miss(s)'' took place in 1988 at the [[University of Massachusetts]].

''The Question of Manet's Olympia: Posed and Skirted'' was first performed in 1989.

'''Touchstone Theatre''' is a professional theatre company in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]], founded in 1976 by a group of [[University of British Columbia]] theatre graduates. Touchstone's focus is on the development and production of Canadian works.&lt;ref name=TouchstoneHistory&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.touchstonetheatre.com/mandate-history/ |title=Company History|date= |publisher=Touchstone Theatre |accessdate=2011-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current Artistic Director is [[Katrina Dunn]], who has served in that position since 1997.&lt;ref name=TouchstoneHistory/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cdn Theatre Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canadiantheatre.com/dict.pl?term=Touchstone%20Theatre |title=Touchstone Theatre |date=  |publisher= Canadian Theatre Encyclopedia |accessdate=2011-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Artistic Directors are Ian Fenwick, Gordon McCall, John Cooper and Roy Surette.&lt;ref name="Cdn Theatre Encyclopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TheatreBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theatrebc.org/press/newsletr/fall2005.pdf |title=Significant Anniversary Seasons! |date=Fall 2005 |publisher= Theatre BC|accessdate=2011-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

Touchstone Theatre's stated mandate is that it "''develops and presents professional theatrical productions. We explore the contemporary Canadian play through content and form. We stimulate public interest in Canadian cultural perspectives.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=touchstonetheatre.com/mandate-history/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NextStage"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://thenextstage.wordpress.com/2008/02/29/this-one-goes-to-eleven-katrina-dunn/ |title=This One Goes to Eleven: Katrina Dunn |date= 2008-02-29 |publisher= The Next Stage |accessdate=2011-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fulfillment of its mandate, much of Touchstone's activities have fallen into one of three categories: it mounts premiere productions of plays by British Columbian playwrights; it mounts second productions of important plays that premiered in other areas of Canada; and it produces works developed within the company. Touchstone has helped launch and develop the careers of numerous playwrights and actors. Touchstone, with the Playwrights Theatre Centre, also fosters the creation of new works through its "Flying Start" initiative (previously the "Playwright in Residence" program).&lt;ref name="Cdn Theatre Encyclopedia"/&gt; Under the program, Touchstone spends two years working with a playwright to develop a play through workshops and [[dramaturgy]] to production.&lt;ref name="NextStage"/&gt;

Since 2011, in partnership with the [[Arts Club Theatre Company]], Touchstone produces the "In Tune Conference", which supports new Canadian musicals in a national event which takes place every two years.

==History==

As of its 40th anniversary in the 2015-2016 season, Touchstone will have produced 36 World Premiers and works by 42 Canadian playwrights. Touchstone has helped launch and develop the careers of numerous playwrights and actors.

At the start of the 1997-1998 season, Katrina Dunn succeeded Roy Surette as Artistic Director. Dunn created the "Playwright in Residence" program, which has resulted in many plays, including [[Kevin Kerr (actor)|Kevin Kerr]]'s [[Governor General's Awards]]-winning ''Unity (1918)''.  In 2010, the Touchstone program focussed on female Canadian playwrights.&lt;ref name="GeorgiaStraight"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.straight.com/article-330069/vancouver/touchstone-theatres-katrina-dunn-feted-being-femalefriendly |title=Touchstone Theatre's Katrina Dunn feted for being female-friendly |date=2010-06-21 |publisher=[[The Georgia Straight]]|accessdate=2011-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Touchstone partnered with Rumble Productions to found the [[PuSh International Performing Arts Festival]], a [[performing arts]] festival held every January in Vancouver, BC.&lt;ref name=TouchstoneHistory/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cdn Theatre Encyclopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pushfestival.ca/about-the-festival/about-the-festival/ |title=PuSh - About the Festival |date= |publisher=PuSh Festival |accessdate=2011-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
Touchstone's body of work has garnered many awards and nominations, including numerous [[Jessie Richardson Theatre Award|Jessie Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jessies.ca/archives.html |title=The Jessie Richardson Theatre Awards Winners and Nominations since 1982 |date= |publisher=Jessie Richardson Theatre Award Society |accessdate=2011-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807173931/http://www.jessies.ca/archives.html |archivedate=2011-08-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/theatre/spelling-bee-scores-w-i-n-at-vancouver-theatre-awards/article2068160/ |title=Spelling Bee scores w-i-n at Vancouver theatre awards |date= 2011-06-21 |publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]] |accessdate=2011-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stage-directions.com/component/content/article/2491-vancouver-theatre-community-takes-a-bow-at-the-jessies.html |title=Vancouver Theatre Community takes a Bow at the Jessies  |date= |publisher=Timeless Communications |accessdate=2011-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of Touchstone's 38th season in 2014, Touchstone had earned 106 Jessie nominations and won 57 Jessie Awards.&lt;ref name="TheatreBC"/&gt;

Several Unlimited-commissioned pieces have gone on to have a global reach, such as [[Sue Austin]]'s ''Creating the Spectacle,'' which has reportedly been seen by more than 150 million people worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.a-n.co.uk/news/digital-rd-fund-5-an-underwater-wheelchair-with-ambitions-to-fly|title=Digital R&amp;D Fund #5: An underwater wheelchair with ambitions to fly - a-n The Artists Information Company|work=a-n The Artists Information Company|access-date=2017-06-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have won critical and industry acclaim within their field, such as Touretteshero's ''Backstage in Biscuit Land'', which earned the company the 2014 Total Theatre Award for Best Emerging Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edfringe.com/media/news/total-theatre-award-winners-announced|title=Total Theatre Award winners announced {{!}} Edinburgh Festival Fringe|work=Edinburgh Festival Fringe|access-date=2017-06-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlimited is currently delivered in partnership between [[Shape Arts]] and [[Artsadmin]] with senior producer Jo Verrent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.disabilityartsinternational.org/artists/profiles/jo-verrent/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2012 the programme was funded by the [[Olympic Lottery Distributor]], and was delivered in partnership between London 2012, Arts Council England, [[Creative Scotland]], [[Arts Council of Wales]], [[Arts Council of Northern Ireland]] and [[British Council|the British Council]]. It was the first time the UK's four arts councils had collaborated with the British Council to commission new work. The British Council supported "five UK international collaborations with artists from seven countries which premiered in: Birmingham, Cambridge, Liverpool, Newcastle and Weymouth prior to a major showcase during the Paralympics"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title = Unlimited|url = https://www.britishcouncil.org/london-2012/culture-heart-games/unlimited|website = British Council|ref = British Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; London-based disability-led arts organisation, [[Shape Arts|Shape]] was contracted to support the 29 commissioned artists through the programme. This programme culminated at the inaugural Unlimited Festival at London's [[Southbank Centre]] in September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Unlimited|date=2012|publisher=London 2012 Festival|pages=89–94|accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Unlimited programme (2014–16) "offers commissions to disabled artists to develop, produce and show ambitious and high quality work, with mentoring support. The programme includes biennial festivals at [[Southbank Centre]] (2014 and 2016) and the opportunity for artists to showcase their work across the country through partnerships with venues and organisations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Unlimited|url=http://weareunlimited.org.uk/about-unlimited/|website=Unlimited|publisher=Shape and ArtsAdmin|accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlimited is currently delivered in partnership by Shape and [[Artsadmin]], with funding from Arts Council England, Creative Scotland, Arts Council of Wales and Spirit of 2012. Key partners include British Council, [[DaDaFest]], Southbank Centre, and Tramway. Since 2012, [http://disabilityarts.online Disability Arts Online] has been the official media partner for the festival, tasked with documenting the work produced in the form of journalism.

Arts Council England have announced £1.8 million funding for a continuation of the Unlimited programme including festivals in 2018 and 2020.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/funding/apply-funding/apply-for-funding/unlimited/|title=Unlimited (III)|website=Arts Council England|accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=‘Woeful’ arts diversity progress prompts call for ‘more power and influence’|url=http://www.disabilitynewsservice.com/woeful-arts-diversity-progress-prompts-call-for-more-power-and-influence/|website=Disability News Service|accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commissions==

The primary purpose of the Unlimited programme is to commission new work by disabled artists and get it seen by as wide an audience as possible. Funding for commissions has so far come in three tranches. The first (Unlimited) which ran from 2010-2012, was a commissioning pot for work around the London 2012 Paralympics, with work being shown around the UK and at the first Unlimited Festival at [[Southbank Centre]]. The second (Unlimited II) covered the years 2013-2016 with work presented at various venues across the UK, culminating at the Unlimited Festivals in 2014 and 2016, again at Southbank Centre and for 2016, also at Glasgow's Tramway. The third (Unlimited III) will cover the period 2017-2020, which will include a greater focus on international collaborations and will encompass works which will be shown at Unlimited Festivals in 2018 and 2020.

==Unlimited Festivals==

The Unlimited Festivals are biennial events, the first of which was held in 2012 to coincide with the Paralympic Games. Unlimited Festival 2012 was held at London's Southbank Centre from 30 August - 9 September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unlimited Festival Trailer|url=https://vimeo.com/48391700|website=Arts Council Vimeo Channel|accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Unlimited Festival attracted live audiences of 20,000 people at ticketed and free events and engaged with an estimated 11,000 people through digital media.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In 2013, when the Unlimited commissioning programme was taken on by Shape and Artsadmin, the relationship between the commissioning body and the festival changed; Southbank Centre would take responsibility for the festival, whilst Shape and Artsadmin would administer the commissioning programme. The festival would continue to act as a showcase event for the work commissioned by the programme, but other work by disabled artists would also feature alongside the Unlimited-commissioned work. The Southbank Centre hosted the second Unlimited Festival from 2–9 September 2014. Unlimited 2016 marked the first time that the festival went to a venue other than Southbank Centre. The festival took place at the Southbank Centre from 6–11 September, before Tramway in Glasgow hosted their own version of the festival from 15–25 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unlimited.southbankcentre.co.uk/|title=Home - Southbank Unlimited|last=Centre|first=Southbank|website=unlimited.southbankcentre.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.glasgowlife.org.uk/news/pages/tramway's-unlimited-festival-programme-announced.aspx|title=Tramway's Unlimited Festival programme announced|website=www.glasgowlife.org.uk|language=en-us|access-date=2017-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Arts Council England has committed funding for future festivals in 2018 and 2020.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Unlimited Impact==

Unlimited Impact focuses on developing and inspiring the next generation of young disabled people passionate about making change through the arts; extending Unlimited’s reach by supporting venues across the country to successfully programme ambitious and high quality work by disabled artists; and deepening discussion and debate around work by disabled artists.

[[Wall Hangings]] was an exhibition of textile [[fiber art]] at [[Museum of Modern Art]] from 25 February to 4 May 1969. It was planned in 1966 and toured 11 cities in 1968–1969&lt;ref name="String, Felt &amp; Thread" /&gt;.
 

==About==
Wall Hangings Exhibition was curated by [[Mildred Constantine]] and [[Jack Lenor Larsen]] and featured 28 Artists from 8 countries&lt;ref name="Exhibition Catalogue Book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Constantine|first1=Mildred|last2=Lenor Laren|first2=Jack|title=Wall Hangins|date=1969|publisher=The Museum of Modern Art|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It was the first major art exhibition in [[fiber arts]] or textiles.&lt;ref name="String, Felt &amp; Thread"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Auther|first1=Elissa|title=String, felt, thread : the hierarchy of art and craft in American art|date=2010|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis|isbn=9780816656097|page=32-40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artworks were noted for their techniques, material, scale and three-dimensionality and were referenced both to their break from and use of tradition in those areas. The history of the artists in the show were directly attributed to the Austrian [[Wiener Werkstätte]] and the German [[Bauhaus]], though mention was made of other inspirations such as [[Pre-Columbian era|Pre-Columbian]] Peruvian [[Weaving|weavers]].&lt;ref name="Exhibition Catalogue Book" /&gt;  

==Ideology==
The 19 December 1968 Press release by the [[Museum of Modern Art]] for the exhibition Wall Hangings states: "During the last 10 years, developments in weaving have caused us to revise our concepts of this craft and view the work within the context of twenty-first century art. The weavers from eight countries represented in this exhibition are not part of the fabric industry, but of the world of art. They have extended the formal possibilities of weaving, frequently using complex and unique techniques."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.moma.org/momaorg/shared/pdfs/docs/press_archives/4163/releases/MOMA_1968_July-December_0095_135.pdf?2010|title=Press Release| accessdate=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
The only national [[art world]] press was written by [[Louise Bourgeois]] for ''Craft Horizons'' and was negative and suggested that the work was not fine art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Auther|first=Elissa|date=2008|title=Fiber Art and the Hierarchy of Art and Craft, 1960–80|url=|journal=The Journal of Modern Craft|volume=1.1|pages=19–20|via=Taylor and Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="String, Felt &amp; Thread" /&gt; As craft theorist Elissa Auther states in her 2009 book ''String Felt &amp; Thread'': "Despite the awareness of the negative art world attitudes concerning media traditionally associated with the crafts, the strategy Constantine and Larsen adopted to assert fiber's art status was to introduce the new genre into the fine art world on the terms set by that world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Auther|first1=Elissa|title=String, felt, thread : the hierarchy of art and craft in American art|date=2010|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis|isbn=9780816656097|pages=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Yabo'''''|野暮}} is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] term describing something that is unaesthetic or unappealing. ''Yabo'' is the antonym of ''[[Iki (aesthetic ideal)|iki]]''. ''Busui'' (無粋), literally "non-''iki''", is synonymous with ''yabo''. A non-''iki'' thing is not necessarily ''yabo'' but probably is. Something that is ''yabo'' is usually unrefined, gigantic, coarse, childish, colorful, self-conscious, permanent, loud, superficial, vulgar, snobbish, boorish, etc.

The word ''yabo'' was often used by city dwellers, or ''[[Chōnin]]'' (especially those of [[Edo]]). It often refers to [[samurai]] and farmers (''[[nomin]])'' from outside Edo, but could also be applied to another ''chonin''. The city dwellers of Edo sometimes called themselves ''[[Edokko]]'' (similar to ''New Yorker'' or ''Parisian''). Proud of having been born and raised in Edo, they had a tendency to despise outsiders. However, the origins of many chonin could be traced back to other areas and backgrounds.

The meaning of the term has expanded and generalized through the [[modernization of Japan]]. Today, the word ''yabo'' is used more frequently than ''[[iki (aesthetic ideal)|iki]]''.{{fact|date=April 2017}}
