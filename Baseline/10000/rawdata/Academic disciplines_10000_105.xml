'''Aerospace engineering''' is the primary field of [[engineering]] concerned with the development of [[aircraft]] and [[spacecraft]].&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Aerospace Engineering''. [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]], 2010. {{ISBN|978-0-470-75440-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has two major and overlapping branches: Aeronautical engineering and Astronautical Engineering.  [[Avionics]] engineering is similar, but deals with the [[electronic engineering|electronics]] side of aerospace engineering.

[[Aeronautics|Aeronautical engineering]] was the original term for the field. As [[flight technology]] advanced to include craft operating in [[outer space]] ([[astronautics]]), the broader term "[[aerospace]] engineering" has come into common use.&lt;ref name=britannica_Engineering&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title= Engineering |author= Stanzione, Kaydon Al |encyclopedia= Encyclopædia Britannica |volume= 18 |edition= 15 |pages= 563–563 |year= 1989 |location= Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Aerospace engineering, particularly the astronautics branch, is often colloquially referred to as "[[rocket science (disambiguation)|rocket science]]".&lt;ref name=SA/&gt;

==Overview==
Flight vehicles are subjected to demanding conditions such as those produced by changes in [[atmospheric pressure]] and [[temperature]], with [[structural load]]s applied upon vehicle components. Consequently, they are usually the products of various technological and [[List of engineering branches|engineering disciplines]] including [[aerodynamics]], [[Air propulsion|propulsion]], [[avionics]], [[materials science]], [[structural analysis]] and [[manufacturing]]. The interaction between these technologies is known as aerospace engineering. Because of the complexity and number of disciplines involved, aerospace engineering is carried out by teams of engineers, each having their own specialized area of expertise.&lt;ref name=Princeton_review&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princetonreview.com/cte/profiles/dayInLife.asp?careerID=5 |title=Career: Aerospace Engineer |accessdate=2006-10-08 |work=Career Profiles |publisher=The Princeton Review |quote=Due to the complexity of the final product, an intricate and rigid organizational structure for production has to be maintained, severely curtailing any single engineer's ability to understand his role as it relates to the final project. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060509023617/http://www.princetonreview.com/cte/profiles/dayInLife.asp?careerID=5 |archivedate=2006-05-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{See also|Aviation history}}
[[File:First flight2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Orville and Wilbur Wright]] flew the [[Wright Flyer]] in 1903 at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina.]]

The origin of aerospace engineering can be traced back to the aviation pioneers around the late 19th to early 20th centuries, although the work of Sir [[George Cayley]] dates from the last decade of the 18th to mid-19th century. One of the most important people in the history of [[aeronautics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Sir George Cayley |url= http://www.flyingmachines.org/cayl.html |publisher= ? |date= |accessdate= 2009-07-26 |quote= Sir George Cayley is one of the most important people in the history of aeronautics. Many consider him the first true scientific aerial investigator and the first person to understand the underlying principles and forces of flight.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cayley was a pioneer in aeronautical engineering&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Sir George Cayley (British Inventor and Scientist) |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/100795/Sir-George-Cayley-6th-Baronet |publisher= Britannica |date= n.d. |accessdate= 2009-07-26 |quote= English pioneer of aerial navigation and aeronautical engineering and designer of the first successful glider to carry a human being aloft.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is credited as the first person to separate the forces of [[Lift (force)|lift]] and [[Drag (physics)|drag]], which are in effect on any flight vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Sir George Cayley |url= http://www.centennialofflight.net/essay/Dictionary/Cayley/DI15.htm |publisher= U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission |date= |accessdate= 31 January 2016 |quote= A wealthy landowner, Cayley is considered the father of aerial navigation and a pioneer in the science of aerodynamics. He established the scientific principles for heavier-than-air flight and used glider models for his research. He was the first to identify the [[four forces of flight]]--thrust, lift, drag, and weight—and to describe the relationship each had with the other.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Early knowledge of aeronautical engineering was largely empirical with some concepts and skills imported from other branches of engineering.&lt;ref name=americana&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author= [[Kermit Van Every]] |encyclopedia= Encyclopedia Americana |title= Aeronautical engineering |edition= |year= 1988 |publisher= Grolier Incorporated |volume= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists understood some key elements of aerospace engineering, like [[fluid dynamics]], in the 18th century. Many years later after the successful flights by the [[Wright brothers]], the 1910s saw the development of aeronautical engineering through the design of [[World War I]] military aircraft.

The first definition of aerospace engineering appeared in February 1958.&lt;ref name=britannica_Engineering /&gt; The definition considered the Earth's atmosphere and the outer space as a single realm, thereby encompassing both aircraft (''aero'') and spacecraft (''space'') under a newly coined word ''[[aerospace]]''. In response to the USSR launching the first satellite, [[Sputnik]] into space on October 4, 1957, U.S. aerospace engineers launched the [[Explorer I|first American satellite]] on January 31, 1958.  The [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] was founded in 1958 as a response to the Cold War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/factsheet.htm |title=A Brief History of NASA |publisher= NASA |date= |accessdate=2012-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:engine.f15.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|A fighter jet engine undergoing testing. The tunnel behind the engine allows noise and exhaust to escape.]]
* [[Radar cross-section]]&amp;nbsp;– the study of vehicle signature apparent to [[Radar]] [[remote sensing]].
*[[Fluid mechanics]]&amp;nbsp;– the study of [[fluid flow]] around objects. Specifically [[aerodynamics]] concerning the flow of air over bodies such as [[wing]]s or through objects such as [[wind tunnel]]s (see also [[lift (force)|lift]] and [[aeronautics]]).
* [[Astrodynamics]]&amp;nbsp;– the study of [[orbital mechanics]] including prediction of orbital elements when given a select few variables.  While few schools in the United States teach this at the undergraduate level, several have graduate programs covering this topic (usually in conjunction with the Physics department of said college or university).
* [[Statics]] and [[Dynamics (physics)|Dynamics]] (engineering mechanics)&amp;nbsp;– the study of movement, forces, moments in mechanical systems.
* [[Mathematics]]&amp;nbsp;– in particular, [[calculus]], [[differential equations]], and [[linear algebra]].
* [[Electrotechnology]]&amp;nbsp;– the study of [[electronics]] within engineering.
* Propulsion&amp;nbsp;– the energy to move a vehicle through the air (or in outer space) is provided by [[internal combustion engine]]s, [[jet engine]]s and [[turbomachinery]], or [[rocket]]s (see also [[propeller (aircraft)|propeller]] and [[spacecraft propulsion]]). A more recent addition to this module is [[electric propulsion]] and [[ion propulsion]].
* [[Control engineering]]&amp;nbsp;– the study of [[mathematical modeling]] of the [[Flight dynamics|dynamic]] behavior of systems and designing them, usually using feedback signals, so that their dynamic behavior is desirable (stable, without large excursions, with minimum error). This applies to the dynamic behavior of aircraft, spacecraft, propulsion systems, and subsystems that exist on aerospace vehicles.
* [[Aircraft structures]]&amp;nbsp;– design of the physical configuration of the craft to withstand the forces encountered during flight. Aerospace engineering aims to keep structures lightweight and low-cost while maintaining structural integrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Aircraft Structures in Aerospace Engineering |url= http://aerospaceengineering.aero/aircraft-structures-in-aerospace-engineering/ |work= Aerospace Engineering, Aviation News, Salary, Jobs and Museums |accessdate= 2015-11-06 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151109124154/http://aerospaceengineering.aero/aircraft-structures-in-aerospace-engineering/ |archive-date= 2015-11-09 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Materials science]]&amp;nbsp;– related to structures, aerospace engineering also studies the materials of which the aerospace structures are to be built. New materials with very specific properties are invented, or existing ones are modified to improve their performance.
* [[Solid mechanics]]&amp;nbsp;– Closely related to material science is solid mechanics which deals with stress and strain analysis of the components of the vehicle. Nowadays there are several Finite Element programs such as MSC Patran/Nastran which aid engineers in the analytical process.
* [[Aeroelasticity]]&amp;nbsp;– the interaction of aerodynamic forces and structural flexibility, potentially causing [[Aeroelastic flutter|flutter]], divergence, etc.
* [[Avionics]]&amp;nbsp;– the design and programming of [[computer systems]] on board an aircraft or spacecraft and the [[simulation]] of systems.
* [[Software]]&amp;nbsp;– the specification, design, development, test, and implementation of [[computer software]] for aerospace applications, including [[flight software]], [[ground control software]], test &amp; evaluation software, etc.
* [[Reliability engineering|Risk and reliability]]&amp;nbsp;– the study of risk and reliability assessment techniques and the mathematics involved in the quantitative methods.
* [[Noise control]]&amp;nbsp;– the study of the mechanics of sound transfer.
* [[Aeroacoustics]]&amp;nbsp;– the study of noise generation via either turbulent fluid motion or aerodynamic forces interacting with surfaces.
* [[Flight test]]&amp;nbsp;– designing and executing flight test programs in order to gather and analyze performance and [[handling qualities]] data in order to determine if an aircraft meets its design and performance goals and certification requirements.

The basis of most of these elements lies in theoretical [[physics]], such as [[fluid dynamics]] for aerodynamics or the [[equations of motion]] for [[flight dynamics]]. There is also a large [[empiricism|empirical]] component. Historically, this empirical component was derived from testing of scale models and prototypes, either in [[wind tunnel]]s or in the free atmosphere. More recently, advances in [[computing]] have enabled the use of [[computational fluid dynamics]] to simulate the behavior of the fluid, reducing time and expense spent on wind-tunnel testing. Those studying hydrodynamics or [[Hydroacoustics]] often obtained degrees in Aerospace Engineering.

Additionally, aerospace engineering addresses the integration of all components that constitute an aerospace vehicle (subsystems including power, [[aerospace bearing]]s, communications, [[Temperature control|thermal control]], [[life support]], etc.) and its life cycle (design, temperature, pressure, [[radiation]], [[velocity]], [[Fatigue (material)|lifetime]]).

==Degree programs==
{{main|List of aerospace engineering schools}}

Aerospace engineering may be studied at the [[diploma|advanced diploma]], [[bachelor's degree|bachelor's]], [[master's degree|master's]], and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] levels in aerospace engineering departments at many universities, and in [[mechanical engineering]] departments at others. A few departments offer degrees in space-focused astronautical engineering.  Some institutions differentiate between aeronautical and astronautical engineering.  Graduate degrees are offered in advanced or specialty areas for the aerospace industry.

A background in chemistry, physics, computer science and mathematics is important for students pursuing an aerospace engineering degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.myfuture.com/careers/education/aerospace-engineers_17-2011.00 |title=Entry education, Aerospace Engineers |publisher=myfuture.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "[[wikt:rocket scientist|rocket scientist]]" is sometimes used to describe a person of great [[intelligence]] since rocket science is seen as a practice requiring great mental ability, especially technically and mathematically.

An '''archaeophyte''' is a [[plant]] species which is non-native to a geographical region, but which was an [[introduced species]] in "ancient" times, rather than being a modern introduction. Those arriving after are called [[Neophyte (botany)|neophyte]]s. In Britain, archaeophytes are considered to be those species first introduced prior to 1492, when [[Christopher Columbus]] arrived in the [[New World]] and the [[Columbian Exchange]] began.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Preston |first=Christopher D. |last2=Pearman |first2=David A. |last3=Hall |first3=Allan R. |date=1 July 2004 |title=Archaeophytes in Britain |url=https://academic.oup.com/botlinnean/article/145/3/257/2420246 |journal=[[Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society]] |language=en |volume=145 |issue=3 |pages=257–294 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8339.2004.00284.x |issn=0024-4074 |access-date=2018-07-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180306102951/https://academic.oup.com/botlinnean/article/145/3/257/2420246 |archive-date=2018-03-06 |dead-url=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Areni-1_cave_entrance.jpg|thumb|Entrance to the [[Areni-1 cave complex|Areni-1 cave]]]]

The '''Areni-1 winery''' is a 6100-year-old [[winery]] that was discovered in 2007 in the [[Areni-1 cave complex]] in the village of [[Areni]] in the [[Vayots Dzor]] province of [[Armenia]] by a team of Armenian and Irish archaeologists. The excavations were carried out by Boris Gasparyan of the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Armenia]]  and Ron Pinhasi from [[University College Cork]] (Ireland), and were sponsored by the Gfoeller Foundation (USA) and University College Cork. In 2008 the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA) also joined the project with Gregory Areshian as co-director of the Areni Project. Since then the excavations have been sponsored by UCLA and the [[National Geographic Society]] as well. The excavations of the winery were completed in 2010.

The winery consists of [[Fermentation (wine)|fermentation]] [[Barrel|vats]], a [[wine press]], storage jars, pottery sherds, and is believed to be at least a thousand years older than the winery unearthed in [[Judea and Samaria]] in 1963, which is the second oldest currently known.&lt;ref name= "LAT"&gt;Maugh II, Thomas H.

The [[Areni-1 shoe]] was found in the same cave in 2008.

==Discovery==
Excavations at the Areni-1 site began in 2007 and continued until September 2010. Armenian, American and Irish archaeologists fully unearthed a large, well-preserved 2-foot (60 centimeter) deep vat, along with a 3.5-foot (one meter) long basin made of clay and covered with [[malvidin]].&lt;ref name="NatGeo"/&gt; In addition to these discoveries grape seeds, remains of pressed grapes, prunes, walnuts, and desiccated vines were found. A number of drinking cups, found next to a set of ancient graves, were also excavated, suggesting that the site was used for funeral ceremonies and ritualistic practices.&lt;ref&gt;Belluck, Pam.

''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]''. January 11, 2011. Retrieved January 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The cave was abandoned after its roof caved in, and the organic material was preserved thanks to sheep [[Feces|dung]], which prevented [[fungi]] from destroying the remains.&lt;ref name= "LAT"/&gt;

The team's full findings will be published in future.

==Analysis==
The results of the biochemical analysis of the residues from the bottom of the wine-press and the storage jars carried out by Hans Barnard and his colleagues at UCLA were published in the ''Journal of Archaeological Science'' in January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Barnard, Hans et al. "[http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/science/YJASC_2685.pdf Chemical evidence for wine production around 4000 BCE in the Late Chalcolithic Near Eastern highlands]." ''Journal of Archaeological Science'', (2010), {{doi|10.1016/j.jas.2010.11.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Botanical analysis and [[radiocarbon]] tests carried out by researchers at the [[University of California, Irvine]] and [[Oxford University]] have revealed the date of the Areni-1 winery to around 4100 BC and 4000 BC or the [[Copper Age|Late Chalcolithic Period]].&lt;ref name="AFP"/&gt; According to Areshian, the vintners used their feet to press the wine in the clay basin, the juice of which would then drain into the vat, where it would remain to [[Fermentation (wine)|ferment]] until being stored in jars.&lt;ref name="NatGeo"/&gt; The capacity of the vat has been estimated to be about 14–15 gallons (US or imperial??) {{citation needed|date=July 2018}}.

According to Areshian, the discovery of the winery has provided greater insight to the study of [[horticulture]]. Patrick E. McGovern, a biomolecular archaeologist at the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum]], has likewise emphasized the importance of the discovery, describing it as "important and unique, because it indicates large-scale wine production, which would imply, I think, that the grape had already been domesticated."&lt;ref name="NatGeo"/&gt;

The exact identity of the people who lived in the region at the time is not known, although some researchers have postulated that they may have belonged to the [[Kura-Araxes culture|Kura-Araxes]] people and added that they may have been very involved in trade.&lt;ref name= "LAT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AFP"/&gt;

'''BLC Leather Technology Centre''' or '''BLC''' is a testing, auditing and consulting business that specialises in chemicals, leather, footwear and other associated products and related materials, and is based in [[Northamptonshire]] &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.blcleathertech.com/about-us]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laboratory-directory.com/contract-laboratories/profile/blc-leather-technology-centre-ltd]&lt;/ref&gt;. An additional specialism is the safe use and management of chemicals in the supply chain; a concept from which BLC developed the ZDHC approved BLC Chem-MAP certification process for chemicals, chemical companies, brands and their suppliers&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.chem-map.com/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.roadmaptozero.com/news/post/zdhc-announces-blc-chem-map-as-zdhc-accepted-certification-standard/]&lt;/ref&gt;. 

A significant item of note is that BLC is the official facilitator of the Leather Working Group (LWG) which is a significant environmental stewardship programme within the leather industry. The LWG has over 600 member companies that includes over 100 major clothing and footwear brands&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.leatherworkinggroup.com/]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==BLC==

In March 2018, BLC was acquired by [[Eurofins Scientific]] of [[Belgium]] who now have a majority share holding in the company.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eurofins.com/consumer-product-testing/media-centre/news/blc-leather-technology-centre-ltd-joins-eurofins/ Eurofins]&lt;/ref&gt;.

He is also a noted scholar in [[jurisprudence]] and [[legal philosophy]], having introduced ''Civil Recourse Theory'' in the 1998 article ''Rights, Wrongs, and Recourse in the Law of Torts''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-27072594/rights-wrongs-and-recourse-in-the-law-of-torts|title="Rights, Wrongs, and Recourse in the Law of Torts" by Zipursky, Benjamin C. - Vanderbilt Law Review, Vol. 51, Issue 1, January 1998 - Online Research Library: Questia|work=questia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to economic theorists, Zipursky argues that tort law is about legal wrongs and legal rights, not just about economic efficiency.  Contrary to corrective justice theorists, he argues that [[private law]] is more about empowering individuals to seek redress for wrongs, and less about compensating for losses.

Since 1998, Zipursky, along with collaborator and co-author Goldberg, has published a book and numerous articles, essays, and book chapters on civil recourse theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=288083|title=SSRN Author Page for Zipursky, Benjamin C.|work=ssrn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flipdocs.com/showbook.aspx?ID=10005364_622787&amp;p=14|title=Fordham Lawyer - Spring 2012|work=flipdocs.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Civil recourse theory has generated several conferences and commentaries from judges and academics in the United States and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tortstoday.blogspot.com/2012/05/new-private-law-harvard-symposium.html|title=Torts Today: The New Private Law - Harvard symposium|work=tortstoday.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.fsu.edu/journals/lawreview/documents/391.pdf] {{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.unimelb.edu.au/obligations/convenors-and-members/past-events |title=Past Events |work=unimelb.edu.au |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211005505/http://www.law.unimelb.edu.au/obligations/convenors-and-members/past-events |archivedate=2014-12-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zipursky has twice served as Associate Dean at Fordham University School of Law, where he currently holds the James H. Quinn '49 Chair in Legal Ethics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.fordham.edu/assets/bzipursky2014cv.pdf] {{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He has taught as a Visiting Professor at [[Columbia Law School]], [[Harvard Law School]], and [[Vanderbilt University School of Law]].   In addition to products liability law, tort law, and philosophical theory of private law, his scholarly work also addresses analytic legal philosophy, legal ethics, and constitutional theory.&lt;ref name="fordham.edu"/&gt;

He was born and raised in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], Canada and grew up in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], [[Ontario]], Canada. He received his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from [[Swarthmore College]] in 1982, his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree in philosophy from the [[University of Pittsburgh]] in 1987, and his [[Juris Doctor]] degree ''magna cum laude'' from [[New York University School of Law]] in 1991.&lt;ref name="fordham.edu"/&gt;

[[File:Biosensors based on type of biotransducers.png|thumb|right|upright=2.0|Biosensors based on type of biotransducers]] A '''biotransducer''' is the recognition-transduction component of a biosensor system. It consists of two intimately coupled parts; a bio-recognition layer and a physicochemical transducer, which acting together converts a biochemical signal to an electronic or optical signal. The bio-recognition layer typically contains an [[enzyme]] or another binding protein such as [[antibody]]. However, [[oligonucleotide]] sequences, sub-cellular fragments such as organelles (e.g. [[mitochondria]]) and receptor carrying fragments (e.g. [[cell wall]]), single whole cells, small numbers of cells on synthetic scaffolds, or thin slices of animal or plant tissues, may also comprise the bio-recognition layer. It gives the [[biosensor]] selectivity and specificity. The physicochemical transducer is typically in intimate and controlled contact with the recognition layer. As a result of the presence and biochemical action of the analyte (target of interest), a physico-chemical change is produced within the biorecognition layer that is measured by the physicochemical transducer producing a signal that is proportionate to the concentration of the analyte.&lt;ref name=ElectrochemicalGlucoseBiosensor&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = J. | title = Electrochemical Glucose Biosensors | doi = 10.1021/cr068123a | journal = Chemical Reviews | volume = 108 | issue = 2 | pages = 814–825 | year = 2008 | pmid =  18154363| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The physicochemical transducer may be electrochemical, optical, electronic, gravimetric, pyroelectric or piezoelectric. Based on the type of biotransducer, biosensors can be classified as shown to the right.

== Electrochemical biotransducers ==

Electrochemical biosensors contain a biorecognition element that selectively reacts with the target analyte and produces an electrical signal that is proportional to the analyte concentration. In general, there are several approaches that can be used to detect electrochemical changes during a biorecognition event and these can be classified as follows: amperometric, potentiometric, impedance, and conductometric.

===Amperometric===
Amperometric transducers detect change in current as a result of electrochemical oxidation or reduction. Typically, the bioreceptor molecule is immobilized on the [[working electrode]] (commonly gold, carbon, or platinum). The potential between the working electrode and the [[reference electrode]] (usually Ag/AgCl) is fixed at a value and then current is measured with respect to time. The applied potential is the driving force for the electron transfer reaction. The current produced is a direct measure of the rate of electron transfer.  The current reflects the reaction occurring between the bioreceptor molecule and analyte and is limited by the mass transport rate of the analyte to the electrode.

===Potentiometric===
Potentiometric sensors measure a potential or charge accumulation of an [[electrochemical cell]]. The transducer typically comprises an ion selective electrode (ISE) and a reference electrode.  The ISE features a membrane that selectively interacts with the charged ion of interest, causing the accumulation of a charge potential compared to the reference electrode. The reference electrode provides a constant half-cell potential that is unaffected by analyte concentration. A high impedance voltmeter is used to measure the electromotive force or potential between the two electrodes when zero or no significant current flows between them. The potentiometric response is governed by the [[Nernst equation]] in that the potential is proportional to the logarithm of the concentration of the analyte.

===Impedance===
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) involves measuring resistive and capacitive changes caused by a biorecognition event. Typically, a small amplitude sinsusoidal electrical stimulus is applied, causing current to flow through the biosensor. The frequency is varied over a range to obtain the impedance spectrum. The resistive and capacitive components of impedance are determined from in phase and out of phase current responses. Typically, a conventional three-electrode system is made specific to the analyte by immobilizing a biorecognition element to the surface. A voltage is applied and the current is measured. The interfacial impedance between the electrode and solution changes as a result of the analyte binding. An impedance analyzer can be used to control and apply the stimulus as well as measure the impedance changes.

===Conductometry===
Conductometric sensing involves measuring the change in conductive properties of the sample solution or a medium. The reaction between the biomolecule and analyte changes the ionic species concentration, leading to a change in the solution electrical conductivity or current flow. Two metal electrodes are separated at a certain distance and an AC potential is applied across the electrodes, causing a current flow between the electrodes. During a biorecognition event the ionic composition changes, using an ohmmeter the change in conductance can be measured.

== Optical biotransducers ==
Optical biotransducers, used in optical biosensors for signal transduction, use photons in order to collect information about analyte.&lt;ref&gt;Sergey M. Borisov, Otto S. Wolfbeis, Optical Biosensors, Chemical Reviews, 2008, Vol. 108, No. 2&lt;/ref&gt; These are highly sensitive, highly specific, small in size and cost effective.

The detection mechanism of optical biotransducer depends upon the enzyme system that converts analyte into products which are either oxidized or reduced at the working electrode.&lt;ref&gt;Ligler, Frances S.; Rowe Taitt, Chris A. Optical Biosensors - Present &amp; Future. Elsevier.2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Evanescent field detection principle is most commonly used in an optical biosensor system as the transduction principle . This principle is one of the most sensitive detection methods. It enables the detection of fluorophores exclusively in the close proximity of the optical fiber.
&lt;ref&gt;A. P. Abel, M. G. Weller, G. L. Duveneck, M. Ehrat, M. Widmer, “ Fiber-optic Evanescent Wave Biosensors for the Detection of Oligonucleotides” Anal. Chem, 1996, 68, 2905-2912.&lt;/ref&gt;

== FET-based electronic biotransducers ==
Electronic biosensing offers significant advantages over optical, biochemical and biophysical methods, in terms of high sensitivity and new sensing mechanisms, high spatial resolution for localized detection, facile integration with standard wafer-scale semiconductor processing and label-free, real-time detection in a nondestructive manner [6].

Devices based on field-effect transistors (FETs) have attracted great attention because they can directly translate the interactions between target biological molecules and the FET surface into readable electrical signals. In a FET, current flows along the channel which is connected to the source and the drain. The channel conductance between the source and the drain is switched on and off by gate electrode that is capacitively coupled through a thin dielectric layer [6].

In FET-based biosensors, the channel is in direct contact with the environment, and this gives better control over the surface charge. This improves the sensitivity of surface FET-based biosensors as biological events occurring at the channel surface could result in the surface potential variation of the semiconductor channel and then modulate the channel conductance. In addition to ease of on-chip integration of device arrays and the cost-effective device fabrication, the surface ultrasensitivity of FET-based biosensors makes it an attractive alternative to existing biosensor technologies[6].

== Gravimetric/Piezoelectric biotransducers ==
Gravimetric biosensors use the basic principle of a response to a change in mass.  Most gravimetric biosensors use thin piezoelectric quartz crystals, either as resonating crystals ([[Quartz crystal microbalance|QCM]]), or as bulk/surface acoustic wave ([[Surface acoustic wave|SAW]]) devices. In the majority of these the mass response is inversely proportional to the crystal thickness. Thin polymer films are also used in which biomolecules can be added to the surface with known surface mass.  [[Acoustic wave]]s can be projected to the thin film to produce an oscillatory device, which then follows an equation that is nearly identical to the Sauerbrey equation used in the QCM method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=P.W. Walton|author2=M.R. O'Flaherty|author3=M.E. Butler|author4=P. Compton|title=Gravimetric biosensors based on acoustic waves in thin polymer films|journal=Biosensors and Bioelectronics|year=1993|volume=8|issue=9-10|pages=401–407|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/095656639380024J|accessdate=12 November 2013|doi=10.1016/0956-5663(93)80024-J}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Biomolecules, such as proteins or antibodies can bind and its change in mass gives a measureable signal proportional to the presence of the target analyte in the sample.

== Pyroelectric biotransducers ==
Pyroelectric biosensors generate an electric current as a result of a temperature change.  This differential induces a [[Electrical polarity|polarization]] in the substance, producing a [[Electric dipole moment|dipole moment]] in the direction of the temperature gradient.  The result is a net voltage across the material.  This net voltage can be calculated by the following equation.&lt;ref&gt;Heimlich et al. Biosensor technology: Fundamentals and applications, Marcel Dekker, INC.: New York, 1990. PP. 338&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Delta V = \omega PAr\Delta T\left(1+\omega^2\tau_E^2\right)^{-1/2}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\tau_E=rC&lt;/math&gt;

'''Albizu University''' is a private, non-profit university offering undergraduate and graduate degrees in the fields of psychology, education, speech and language, criminal justice, ESOL, and human services. With the main campus in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], [[Puerto Rico]], a branch campus in [[Miami, Florida]], and an additional instructional location in [[Mayagüez, Puerto Rico]], the university provides professional training that is relevant and responsive to the mental health needs of multicultural communities and supports culturally sensitive research that contributes to and helps grow the professions of psychology, health, education, and human services.

==History==
The university’s history began in 1966, when a renowned Puerto Rican psychologist and educator, [[Carlos Albizu Miranda|Dr. Carlos Albizu-Miranda]], founded the Instituto Psicológico de Puerto Rico (Puerto Rico Institute of Psychology) in response to the need for culturally sensitive professional training in the area of clinical psychology. At the time, there were no graduate programs in clinical psychology in Puerto Rico. [[University of Puerto Rico|The University of Puerto Rico]] and the Normal School (later known as the College of Education) included psychology as part of the core curricula as early as 1903—but only for undergraduate studies that were heavily based on the American higher education system and its standards. Graduate-level degrees in psychology could only be obtained through schools in the United States.

By the early 1960s, little had changed, with mental health professionals being trained abroad and then returning to their home country with the challenge of adapting what they had learned in the United States to fit the sociocultural realities of a Hispanic community. Dr. Albizu-Miranda himself received his training at [[Purdue University]] in West Lafayette, Indiana, and incurred the same difficulties of incorporating what he had learned into the culture of the island upon returning home to Puerto Rico.

What had changed, though, was the social climate of the island. Between 1947 and the late 1960s, Puerto Rico saw major industrialization that transformed the island from a rural agrarian to an urban industrial society. With this, came the establishment of social classes, modern capitalism, and economic consumption—along with confusion and insecurity that led to issues such as violence and drug use. By the 1960s, the population had grown to nearly three million people, with only five clinical psychologists on the island to support the growing need for social services.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/953972809|title=Love Reaches Beyond Knowledge: Dr. Carlos Albizu Miranda, Architect of Modern Multicultural Psychology|last=|first=|publisher=Universidad Carlos Albizu and Publicaciones Gaviota|others=Gotay, Samel Silva; Mayo Santana, Raul; Vazquez, Nieve de los Angeles|year=2014|isbn=9781365107672|edition=First|location=San Juan, Puerto Rico|pages=226, 241|oclc=953972809}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to meet the public’s demands, the government established what were known as “assistant psychologists.” These assistant psychologists for the most part had had little training and were not equipped to serve what was becoming an increasingly complex population. By 1964, Dr. Albizu-Miranda had begun envisioning a Puerto Rican-based graduate program that would address the need for multicultural professional training in psychology on the island, along with the need for greater numbers of clinically trained psychologists to serve the growing population.

Between 1964 and 1966, Dr. Albizu-Miranda held multiple meetings with the chancellor of the University of Puerto Rico to discuss the development of a graduate program in psychology. After two years of fruitless efforts, Dr. Albizu-Miranda decided to turn away from the state university and establish a self-governing and independent institution. On August 1, 1966, he incorporated the Puerto Rico Institute of Psychology and welcomed the Institute’s inaugural academic year in 1967-1968.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Recognizing a parallel need for multicultural training in clinical psychology in Southern Florida, which has a large Hispanic population, Dr. Albizu-Miranda opened the Miami Institute of Psychology in Miami, Florida, in 1980. In January 2000, the two main campuses were merged under the shared name Carlos Albizu University in honor of their founder, becoming the first institution in North America to be named after a Hispanic. Today, they are commonly known as Albizu University and continue the tradition of offering programs, both in theory and practice, that stay true to addressing and honoring the multicultural heritages found in both Puerto Rico and South Florida.

==Campuses==
Albizu University has two campuses; the main campus in Old San Juan, Puerto Rico and a branch campus in Miami, Florida. There is a third, instructional, location in [[Mayagüez, Puerto Rico]].

=== San Juan Campus ===
[[File:Carlos Albizu University, San Juan Campus - Buildings in Old San Juan, Puerto Rico - DSC06950.JPG|thumb|Albizu University, San Juan Campus]]
Located in the heart of Puerto Rico’s capital city, the San Juan campus set a precedent as the first independent professional school of psychology in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/pi/oema/resources/ethnicity-health/psychologists/carlos-albizu-miranda.aspx|title=Featured Psychologist: Carlos Albizu Miranda, PhD|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally called the Puerto Rico Institute of Psychology, Dr. Albizu-Miranda modeled the university after institutes of psychology in Europe where practice and internship coexisted. Now, over 50 years since its founding, the San Juan campus has over 1,000 students and has expanded to include two on-campus training clinics: the Clínica de Salud Mental de la Comunidad (Community Mental Health Clinic) and the Clínica de Patología del Habla y Lenguaje (Speech and Language Pathology Clinic).

==== The Community Mental Health Clinic ====
The Community Mental Health Clinic (CMHC) is a training clinic on the campus of Albizu University in San Juan, Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.albizu.edu/our-clinics/community-mental-health-clinic|title=Albizu University &gt; Our Clinics &gt; Community Mental Health Clinic|last=University|first=Albizu|website=www.albizu.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; An active clinic that provides culturally sensitive mental health services to low income and minority clients in San Juan and surrounding communities, CMHC also serves as a practicum and internship site for Albizu University graduate students.

==== Speech and Language Pathology Clinic ====
Based at Albizu University’s San Juan campus, the Speech and Language Pathology Clinic provides culturally sensitive care in the areas of autism, dysphagia, motor-speech disorders, neurological impairments, hearing impairments, cognitive disabilities, and developmental disorders. Graduate students from the university’s M.S. in Speech and Language Pathology program work closely with licensed and certified pathologists to provide care to a diverse population while gaining clinical experience.

===Miami Campus===
[[File:Carlos Albizu University - Miami branch.png|thumb|Albizu University's branch campus in Miami, Florida.]]
Located in the Miami, Florida, metropolitan area, the Miami campus offers over 30 undergraduate and graduate degree and certificate programs in the fields of psychology, education, speech and language, English as a second language (ESOL), criminal justice, and human services. Known as the “Gateway to Latin America and the Caribbean,”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.uschamberfoundation.org/blog/post/miami-innovation-gateway-latin-america/33946|title=Miami: Innovation Gateway to Latin America|last=importer|date=2013-03-20|work=U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation|access-date=2017-03-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miami has one of the largest multi-ethnic populations in the United States, thus providing the perfect environment to support Albizu University in its mission to offer culturally sensitive training to a diverse population in an area with a wide range of practical training sites.

==== The Goodman Psychological Services Center ====
Founded in 1980, The Goodman Psychological Services Center (GPSC), was established with the purpose of providing quality, culturally sensitive, mental health services to low-income, minority, clients in Southern Florida. Sponsored by Albizu University, the Goodman Center is also a practicum site housing four training programs; the Psy.D. in Clinical Psychology program, the M.S. in Psychology program with a major in Marriage and Family Therapy, the M.S. in Speech and Language Pathology program, and the GPSC Doctoral Internship Consortium Program.

Since its inception, the Goodman Center has provided care to nearly 10,000 people of all ages in communities that are typically underserved due to factors such as financial hardship, limited or no insurance coverage, and lack of proficiency in the English language. In addition to the mental health services provided at the center, the Goodman Center is contracted by [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade]] County Public Schools to conduct psychoeducational evaluations for both private referrals and a host of community agencies, including the Florida Department of Families and Children and other health centers. 
[[File:Mayaguez Center view.jpg|left|thumb|Mayagüez City Center]]
In addition to partnering with the [[Miami-Dade County Public Schools]], the Goodman Center has also established a close relationship with [[Camillus House]], a long-standing community center in Miami-Dade County that provides humanitarian services to the poor and homeless. Through its Doctoral Internship Consortium Program, Albizu provides eight full-time internship spots per year—six at the Goodman Center and two at Camillus House—to clinical psychology doctoral students. In the past, these internships were available only to Albizu University students. This year, for the first time, the internships will be available on a national level to all graduate students who come from an APA-accredited clinical psychology doctoral program.

=== Mayagüez University Center ===
In January 2015, Albizu opened an extension in [[Mayagüez, Puerto Rico]]. Under the jurisdiction of the San Juan Campus, the location was created to provide academic offerings and clinical services to the western region of Puerto Rico. Known as the Mayagüez University Center, the facility is much smaller than the other two campuses, with degrees offered exclusively in the fields of psychology and speech and language pathology. With an on-site clinic, the Center is also able to offer students clinical practice while providing health services to the community.

The Mayagüez University Center is located in the heart of the city of Mayagüez. Known as an intellectual mecca, the city houses a number of museums, historic buildings, an array of colleges and universities, and a large student population. In recognition of the cultural and linguistic diversity found not only in Mayagüez but in Puerto Rico as a whole, the Center adopted both Spanish and English as official languages. Though students primarily speak Spanish, they are expected to have adequate reading, writing, and conversational skills in English as well. On occasion, if enough students express interest, teachers will instruct entire classes in English.

== Academics ==
Ranked as one of the nation’s top Hispanic-serving institutions specializing in human behavior science, Albizu attracts a student body committed to preparing themselves to work in community-oriented fields. With curriculums carefully designed to promote cultural sensitivity in today’s diverse society, students are able to choose from over 30 degree and certificate programs, with the largest number of offerings being in the field of psychology.

=== Psychology Program ===
Over half of the programs offered at Albizu are for degrees in psychology, and students are able to select from certificate, undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral programs with a wide range of specializations that include marriage and family therapy, mental health counseling, school counseling, industrial/organizational psychology, child psychology, and clinical psychology.

When Albizu was founded in the late 1960s, Dr. Albizu-Miranda’s blueprint was to create a school offering a master’s degree in clinical psychology that would foster the development of therapeutic processes sensitive to cultural and class differences. At first, there were only 20 students and a handful of teachers committed to the pioneer institution. Over time, the clinical psychology program gained momentum and became the inaugural program at all three locations. To this day, it continues to be the most extensive program that Albizu offers.

Today, all of the psychology programs emphasize cultural and ethnic sensitivity, in recognition of Albizu’s origins as an institution built on the belief that a multicultural society is best served by professionals who are culturally competent and inclusive. In the classroom, where a majority of the professors are practicing mental health professionals, students are taught the intricacies of a multicultural society from the real-world experience and examples provided by their professors. Outside of the classroom, students gain hands-on exposure at over 100 practicum sites that between them offer experience with a wide range of psychological disorders and clinical environments.

==Student life==
Albizu University has numerous clubs and organizations to encourage student involvement in larger communities. Opportunities range from organizations exclusive to Albizu, such as the Student Council, to associations that operate on a national or international level and welcome Albizu students to participate as campus representatives.

Of the clubs and organizations offered to Albizu students, there is a fairly even balance between those hosted by the university and those that represent outside associations. Of the outside associations, some of the most notable with chapters at Albizu include The [[American Psychological Association of Graduate Students]] (APAGS), The Society for Military Psychology, and The International Honor Society in Psychology: [[Psi Chi]]. All offer students the opportunity to have a voice on a national to international level and to advocate on behalf of the science and practice of psychology through events including panel discussions, fundraisers, and walks to raise awareness for different causes such as suicide amongst veterans.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5402">A '''cholinergic crisis''' is an over-stimulation at a [[neuromuscular junction]] due to an excess of [[acetylcholine]] (ACh),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Asensio|first1=Juan A.|last2=Trunkey|first2=Donald D.|title=Current Therapy of Trauma and Surgical Critical Care E-Book|date=Apr 20, 2015|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=9780323079808|page=31|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vkZ9CAAAQBAJ|accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as of a result of the inactivity (perhaps even [[enzyme inhibition|inhibition]]) of the [[AChE]] [[enzyme]], which normally breaks down acetylcholine.  

==[[Cause (medicine)|Etiology]]==

* Contamination with - or excessive exposure to - certain chemicals including:
**[[nerve agent]]s, (''e.g.'' [[sarin]], [[VX (nerve agent)|VX]], [[Novichok agent]]s).
**[[organophosphates|organophosphorus insecticides]] (''e.g.'' [[parathion]])
**[[nicotine poisoning]] can also present with similar symptoms, as it also involves excessive parasympathetic stimulation.&lt;ref name="Schep"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schep|first1=Leo J.|last2=Slaughter|first2=Robin J.|last3=Beasley|first3=D. Michael G.|title=Nicotinic plant poisoning|journal=Clinical Toxicology |volume=47|issue=8|date=September–October 2009|pages=771–781|doi=10.1080/15563650903252186|pmid=19778187}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ingestion of certain [[mushroom poisoning|poisonous fungi]] (particularly the [[muscarine]]-containing members of the genera ''[[Amanita muscaria#Pharmacology|Amanita]]'', ''[[Inocybe]]'' and ''[[Clitocybe]]'').
*In medicine, this is seen in patients with [[myasthenia gravis]] who take too high a dose of medications such as [[cholinesterase inhibitor]]s, or seen following [[general anaesthesia]], when too high a dose of a [[cholinesterase inhibitor]] drug is given to reverse surgical muscle paralysis.

== Symptoms and diagnosis ==
As a result of cholinergic crisis, the muscles stop responding to the bombardment of ACh, leading to [[flaccid paralysis]], [[respiratory failure]], and other signs and symptoms reminiscent of [[organophosphate]] poisoning. Other symptoms include increased sweating, salivation, [[bronchial]] secretions along with [[miosis]].

This crisis may be masked by the concomitant use of [[atropine]] along with cholinesterase inhibitor in order to prevent side effects. Flaccid paralysis resulting from cholinergic crisis can be distinguished from [[myasthenia gravis]] by the use of the drug edrophonium (Tensilon), which worsens the paralysis caused by cholinergic crisis, but strengthens the muscle in the case of myasthenia gravis. (Edrophonium is an cholinesterase inhibitor hence increases the concentration of acetylcholine present).

It is useful to remember some of the [[symptoms]] of increased [[cholinergic]] stimulation that include:
* [[Salivation]]: stimulation of the [[salivary glands]] 
* [[Lacrimation]]: stimulation of the [[lacrimal glands]] (tearing)
* [[Urination]]: relaxation of the [[internal sphincter muscle of urethra]], and contraction of the [[Detrusor urinae muscle|detrusor muscles]]
* [[Defecation]]
* [[Nausea|Gastrointestinal distress]]:     [[Smooth muscle]] tone changes causing [[gastrointestinal problem]]s, including cramping
* [[Emesis]]: Vomiting&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C7_NBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA129&amp;lpg=PA129&amp;dq=Killer+Bs+in+cholinergic,+bradycardia,+bronchorrhea,+bronchospasm&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VBBc0lSk-5&amp;sig=0KASrJi_FdZp1RRnLCWCuOjXaCQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=73FTVYP_H4ulNsW0gKgF&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=Killer%20Bs%20in%20cholinergic%2C%20bradycardia%2C%20bronchorrhea%2C%20bronchospasm&amp;f=false | title=Lehne's Pharmacology for Nursing Care | author=Burchum, Jacqueline}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Miosis]]: stimulation of the [[Iris sphincter muscle|pupillary constrictor muscles]]
* [[Muscle spasm]]: stimulation of [[skeletal muscle]] (due to [[nicotinic]] acetylcholine receptor stimulation)

== Treatment ==
Some elements of cholinergic crisis can be treated with antimuscarinic drugs like atropine, but the most important element, [[respiratory arrest]], cannot. The neuromuscular junction, where the brain communicates with muscles (like the diaphragm, the main breathing muscle), works by acetylcholine activating nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and leading to muscle contraction. Atropine blocks muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (a different subtype than the nicotinic receptors at the neuromuscular junction), so atropine will not improve the muscle strength and ability to breathe in someone with cholinergic crisis. Such a patient will require mechanical ventilation support via endotracheal intubation until the crisis resolves on its own. The respiratory compromise from cholinergic crisis unfortunately has no pharmacologic solution or therapy.

==Nominal return==
Let ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; be the price of a security at time ''t'', including any cash dividends or [[interest]], and let ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sub&gt; be its price at ''t''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1.  Let ''RS''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; be the simple rate of return on the security from ''t''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 to ''t''.  Then

: &lt;math&gt; 1 + RS_{t}=\frac{P_{t}}{P_{t-1}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The '''continuously compounded rate of return''' or '''instantaneous  rate of return''' ''RC&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' obtained during that period is

: &lt;math&gt; RC_{t}=\ln\left (\frac{P_{t}}{P_{t-1}}\right ).&lt;/math&gt;

If this instantaneous return is received continuously for one period, then the initial value ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''t-1''&lt;/sub&gt; will grow to &lt;math&gt;P_t = P_{t-1} \cdot e^{RC_t}&lt;/math&gt;  during that period.  See also [[Compound interest|continuous compounding]].

Since this analysis did not adjust for the effects of [[inflation]] on the purchasing power of ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''RS'' and ''RC'' are referred to as [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|nominal rates of return]].

==Real return==
Let &lt;math&gt; \pi _ t&lt;/math&gt; be the purchasing power of a dollar at time ''t'' (the number of bundles of consumption that can be purchased for $1).  Then &lt;math&gt;\pi_t = 1/(PL_t)&lt;/math&gt;, where ''PL''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; is the price level at ''t'' (the dollar price of a bundle of consumption goods). The simple inflation rate ''IS''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; from ''t'' &amp;ndash;1 to ''t'' is &lt;math&gt;\tfrac {PL_t}{PL_{t-1}} - 1&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, continuing the above nominal example, the final value of the investment expressed in real terms is

:&lt;math&gt;P_t^{real} = P_t \cdot \frac{PL_{t-1}}{PL_t}.&lt;/math&gt;

Then the continuously compounded real rate of return &lt;math&gt;RC^{real}&lt;/math&gt; is

: &lt;math&gt; RC_{t}^{real}=\ln\left (\frac{P_{t}^{real}}{P_{t-1}}\right ).&lt;/math&gt;

The continuously compounded real rate of return is just the continuously compounded nominal rate of return minus the continuously compounded inflation rate.

The '''Department of Physics''' in Lund is a department that belongs to both the Faculty of Natural Sciences and the [[Faculty of Engineering (LTH), Lund University|Faculty of Engineering]] at [[Lund University]]. The main goals are to expand the understanding of physics, its applications and to share scientific progress to new generations. Research is conducted in most of the [[physics]] subdivisions. The department also offers courses and a [[Master's degree|Masters's degree programs]] in pure physics and provides physics education for the [[Master of Science in Engineering|Master of Science in Engineering programs]].

== History ==
In 1666 [[Lund University]] was founded without a faculty of science, so the physics research was conducted under the faculty of philosophy. In addition, during its first 150 years the University had no [[professor]]ship in pure physics, so the teachings was instead given by professors in [[mathematics]]. There were however a course in [[experimental physics]] from the early 18th century, but that course was given by a professor in theoretical medicine; [[Kilian Stobæus]] was appointed as the first professor in 1728.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fysik i Lund under 300 år|last=Litzén|first=Ulf|publisher=Lunds universitetshistoriska sällskap|year=2015|isbn=9789175453200|location=Lund|pages=13–19|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; It wasn't until the early 19th century that the physics professorship split from the mathematics, but then the professorship was shared with the [[astronomy]]. The University received its first full professor in physics in 1839.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fysik i Lund under 300 år|last=Litzén|first=|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=48|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a pure department of [[science]] was not established until the late 19th century, the seeds for the department was established in 1735 when the physics teaching received its own space in the building Kungshuset.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fysik i Lund under 300 år|last=Litzén|first=|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=31–32|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The teaching was held inside Kungshuset until the late 19th century, when the department moved to its own building which had instrumental halls, auditoriums, workshops and a library.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fysik i Lund under 300 år|last=Litzén|first=|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=61–62|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The department moved again in 1950 to a large building complex named ''Fysicum'' due to increased space requirements, and its been where since then.

== Research ==
At the Department of Physics advanced research takes place divided in different divisions. The research areas are: [[Atomic Physics]], [[Combustion|Combustion Physics]], [[Mathematical Physics]], [[Nuclear Physics]], [[Particle Physics]], [[Solid State Physics]] and [[Synchrotron Radiation|Synchrotron Radiation Research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fysik.lu.se/english/contact/ |title=Contact |work=Department of Physics |accessdate=5 Aug 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fysik.lu.se/english/research/research-divisions/ |title=Research divisions |work=Department of Physics |accessdate=5 Aug 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The department also hosts the Lund Nano Lab (LNL), part of NanoLund (formerly known as the Nanometer Structure Consortium), an interdisciplinary research enivronment for nanoscience and its applications in electronics, the life sciences etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nano.lu.se/ |title=NanoLund |work=Lund University |accessdate=10 Sep 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further research centers are ''Lund Laser Centre (LLC)'', ''Consortium for Aerosol Science and Technology (CAST)'' and ''Lund University Combustion Centre (LUCC)''.

== Scientists with activity at the department ==
[[Manne Siegbahn]] was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for his discoveries and research in [[X-ray spectroscopy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1924/|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1924|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johannes Rydberg]] became famous for formulating the [[Rydberg formula]] and he got a [[physical constant]] named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ne.se/uppslagsverk/encyklopedi/l%C3%A5ng/rydbergs-konstant|title=Rydbergs konstant - Uppslagsverk - NE|website=www.ne.se|language=sv|access-date=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three scientists from the departement have participated in the popular television program Fråga Lund: Nina Reistad, Bodil Jönsson&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.va.se/nyheter/2015/02/17/professorn-vi-borde-bara-jobba-tva-timmar-per-dag/|title=Professorn: "Vi borde bara jobba två timmar per dag"|work=Veckans affärer|access-date=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sten von Friesen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gp.se/n%C3%B6je/luuk-leder-fr%C3%A5ga-lund-i-svt-1.45242|title=Luuk leder "Fråga Lund" i SVT|work=Göteborgs-Posten|access-date=2017-05-25|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Hellmuth Hertz|Hellmuth Hertz]] was a pioneer in [[Medical ultrasound|sonography]] and was one of the first to develop the [[Inkjet printing|inkjet printer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fysik i Lund under 300 år|last=Litzén|first=|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=160–163|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Anne L'Huillier]] was a pioneer in the research on [[Laser|ultra short laser pulses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.upmc.fr/en/university/history_and_famous_people/doctors_honoris_causa/dhc_2013/anne_l_huillier.html|title=Anne L'Huillier|last=UPMC|first=Université Pierre et Marie Curie -|date=|work=|access-date=2017-05-25|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the above physicists are or have been members of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].

'''Economic geography''' is the study of the [[location]], distribution and spatial organization of economic activities across the world. It represents a traditional subfield of the discipline of [[geography]]. However, many economists have also approached the field in ways more typical of the discipline of [[economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Gordon L. Clark |editor2=Maryann P. Feldman |editor3=Meric S. Gertler |title=The Oxford Handbook of Economic Geography|isbn=978-0-19-823410-4|publisher=Oxford University Press}} Scroll to chapter-preview [https://books.google.com/books?id=TzZ_oByXYhkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Economic+geography%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=x1w8qTXGfi&amp;sig=DTOZmshfo7muaRIt3ifaAT8Fj5E&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=MEWeS9f5JYP68Aa5g4S7Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false links.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic geography has taken a variety of approaches to many different subject matters, including the location of industries, [[economies of agglomeration]] (also known as "linkages"), [[Transportation geography|transportation]], [[international trade]], development, [[real estate]], [[gentrification]], ethnic economies, gendered economies, [[core-periphery]] theory, the [[urban economics|economics of urban form]], the relationship between the environment and the economy (tying into a long history of geographers studying culture-environment interaction), and [[globalization]].

== Theoretical background and influences ==
The subject matter investigated is strongly influenced by the researcher's methodological approach.  Neoclassical [[location theory|location theorists]], following in the tradition of [[Alfred Weber]], tend to focus on industrial location and use quantitative methods.  Since the 1970s, two broad reactions against neoclassical approaches have significantly changed the discipline: Marxist political economy, growing out of the work of [[David Harvey (social theorist and geographer)|David Harvey]]; and the new economic geography which takes into account social, cultural, and institutional factors in the spatial economy.

Economists such as [[Paul Krugman]] and [[Jeffrey Sachs]] have also analyzed many traits related to economic geography. Krugman called his application of spatial thinking to [[international trade theory]] the "new economic geography", which directly competes with an approach within the discipline of geography that is also called "new economic geography".&lt;ref&gt;From S.N.

==History==
[[File:ElSalvadorfairtradecoffee.jpg|thumb|right|The [[economics of coffee|coffee trade]] is a worldwide industry]]

Some of the first traces of the study of spatial aspects of economic activities can be found in [[History of Cartography#China|seven Chinese maps]] of the [[Qin (state)|State of Qin]] dating to the 4th century BC. Ancient writings can be attributed to the Greek geographer [[Strabo]]'s ''Geographika'' compiled almost 2000 years ago.  As the science of [[cartography]] developed, geographers illuminated many aspects used today in the field; maps created by different European powers described the resources likely to be found in American, African, and Asian territories.  The earliest travel journals included descriptions of the native peoples, the climate, the landscape, and the productivity of various locations.  These early accounts encouraged the development of transcontinental trade patterns and ushered in the era of [[mercantilism]].

World War II contributed to the popularization of geographical knowledge generally, and post-war economic recovery and development contributed to the growth of economic geography as a discipline. During [[environmental determinism]]'s time of popularity, [[Ellsworth Huntington]] and his theory of [[climatic determinism]], while later greatly criticized, notably influenced the field. Valuable contributions also came from location theorists such as [[Johann Heinrich von Thünen]] or [[Alfred Weber]]. Other influential theories include [[Walter Christaller]]'s [[Central place theory]], the theory of core and periphery. {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

[[Fred K. Schaefer]]'s article "Exceptionalism in geography: A Methodological Examination", published in the American journal ''Annals of the [[Association of American Geographers]]'', and his critique of regionalism, made a large impact on the field: the article became a rallying point for the younger generation of economic geographers who were intent on reinventing the discipline as a science, and quantitative methods began to prevail in research. Well-known economic geographers of this period include [[William Garrison (geographer)|William Garrison]], [[Brian Berry]], [[Waldo Tobler]], [[Peter Haggett]] and [[William Bunge]].

Contemporary economic geographers tend to specialize in areas such as [[location theory]] and [[spatial analysis]] (with the help of [[geographic information systems]]), market research, geography of transportation, real estate price evaluation, regional and global development, planning, [[Internet Geography|Internet geography]], innovation, [[social networks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Braha | first1 = Dan | last2 = Stacey | first2 = Blake | last3 = Bar-Yam | first3 = Yaneer | year = 2011 | title = Corporate competition: A self-organized network | url = http://necsi.edu/affiliates/braha/Journal_Version_SON_Braha.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Social Networks | volume = 33 | issue = 3| pages = 219–230 | doi=10.1016/j.socnet.2011.05.004| arxiv = 1107.0539 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approaches to study==
As economic geography is a very broad discipline, with economic geographers using many different methodologies in the study of economic phenomena in the world some distinct approaches to study have evolved over time:
*''[[Theoretical economic geography]]'' focuses on building theories about spatial arrangement and distribution of economic activities.
*''[[Regional geography|Regional]] economic geography'' examines the economic conditions of particular regions or countries of the world. It deals with economic [[regionalization]] as well as local [[Economic growth|economic development]].
*''[[Historical economic geography|Historical]] economic geography'' examines the history and development of spatial economic structure. Using historical data, it examines how centers of population and economic activity shift, what patterns of regional specialization and localization evolve over time and what factors explain these changes.
*''[[Evolutionary]] economic geography'' adopts an [[evolutionary]] approach to economic geography. More specifically, Evolutionary Economic Geography uses concepts and ideas from [[evolutionary economics]] to understand the evolution of cities, regions, and other economic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Boschma | first1 = Ron | last2 = Frenken | first2 = Koen |year = 2006 | title = Why is economic geography not an evolutionary science? Towards an evolutionary economic geography | url = https://doi.org/10.1093/jeg/lbi022 | journal = Journal of Economic Geography | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 273–302 | doi=10.1093/jeg/lbi022}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*''[[Critical geography|Critical]] economic geography'' is an approach taken from the point of view of contemporary [[critical geography]] and its philosophy.
*''[[Behavioral geography|Behavioral]] economic geography'' examines the cognitive processes underlying spatial reasoning, locational decision making, and behavior of firms&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schoenberger | first1 = E | year = 2001 | title = Corporate autobiographies: the narrative strategies of corporate strategists | url = | journal = Journal of Economic Geography | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 277–98 | doi=10.1093/jeg/1.3.277}}&lt;/ref&gt; and individuals.

Economic geography is sometimes approached as a branch of [[Human geography|anthropogeography]] that focuses on regional systems of human economic activity. An alternative description of different approaches to the study of human economic activity can be organized around spatiotemporal analysis, analysis of production/consumption of economic items, and analysis of economic flow. Spatiotemporal systems of analysis include economic activities of region, mixed social spaces, and development.

Alternatively, analysis may focus on production, exchange, distribution, and consumption of items of economic activity. Allowing parameters of space-time and item to vary, a geographer may also examine material flow, commodity flow, population flow and information flow from different parts of the economic activity system. Through analysis of flow and production, industrial areas, rural and urban residential areas, transportation site, commercial service facilities and finance and other economic centers are linked together in an economic activity system.

===Branches===
Thematically, economic geography can be divided into these subdisciplines:
* [[Agricultural geography|Geography of agriculture]]
It is traditionally considered the branch of economic geography that investigates those parts of the Earth's surface that are transformed by humans through primary sector activities. It thus focuses on structures of agricultural landscapes and asks for the processes that lead to these spatial patterns. While most research in this area concentrates rather on production than on consumption,[1] a distinction can be made between nomothetic (e.g. distribution of spatial agricultural patterns and processes) and idiographic research (e.g. human-environment interaction and the shaping of agricultural landscapes). The latter approach of agricultural geography is often applied within regional geography.
* Geography of industry
* Geography of international trade
* Geography of resources
* [[Transportation geography|Geography of transport]] and communication
* [[Geography of finance]]

These areas of study may overlap with other [[geography|geographical sciences]].

===Economists and economic geographers===
Generally, spatially interested economists study the effects of space ''on the economy''. Geographers, on the other hand, are interested in the economic processes' impact ''on spatial structures''.

Moreover, economists and economic geographers differ in their methods in approaching spatial-economic problems in several ways. An economic geographer will often take a more holistic approach to the analysis of economic phenomena, which is to conceptualize a problem in terms of space, place, and scale as well as the overt economic problem that is being examined. The economist approach, according to some economic geographers, has the main drawback of homogenizing the economic world in ways economic geographers try to avoid.&lt;ref name="Coe"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Yeung |first1=Henry W. C. |last2=Kelly |first2=Phillip |year=2007 |title=Economic Geography: A Contemporary Introduction |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New economic geography==
With the rise of the [[New Economy]], economic inequalities are increasing spatially. The New Economy, generally characterized by globalization, increasing use of information and communications technology, the growth of knowledge goods, and feminization, has enabled economic geographers to study social and spatial divisions caused by the rising New Economy, including the emerging [[digital divide]].

The new economic geographies consist of primarily service-based sectors of the economy that use innovative technology, such as industries where people rely on computers and the internet. Within these is a switch from manufacturing-based economies to the digital economy. In these sectors, competition makes technological changes robust. These high technology sectors rely heavily on interpersonal relationships and trust, as developing things like software is very different from other kinds of industrial manufacturing—it requires intense levels of cooperation between many different people, as well as the use of [[tacit knowledge]]. As a result of cooperation becoming a necessity, there is a clustering in the high-tech new economy of many firms.

=== Social and spatial divisions ===
As characterized through the work of Diane Perrons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perrons|first=Diane|title=Understanding Social and Spatial Divisions in the New Economy: New Media Clusters and the Digital Divide|journal=Economic Geography|year=2004|volume=80|issue=1|pages=45–61|doi=10.1111/j.1944-8287.2004.tb00228.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Anglo-American literature, the New Economy consists of two distinct types. New Economic Geography 1 (NEG1) is characterized by sophisticated spatial modelling. It seeks to explain uneven development and the emergence of [[Business cluster|industrial clusters]]. It does so through the exploration of linkages between centripetal and centrifugal forces, especially those of economies of scale.

New Economic Geography 2 (NEG2) also seeks to explain the apparently paradoxical emergence of industrial clusters in a contemporary context, however, it emphasizes relational, social, and contextual aspects of economic behaviour, particularly the importance of tacit knowledge. The main difference between these two types is NEG2's emphasis on aspects of economic behaviour that NEG1 considers intangible.

Both New Economic Geographies acknowledge transport costs, the importance of knowledge in a new economy, possible effects of externalities, and endogenous processes that generate increases in productivity. The two also share a focus on the firm as the most important unit and on growth rather than development of regions. As a result, the actual impact of clusters on a region is given far less attention, relative to the focus on clustering of related activities in a region.

However, the focus on the firm as the main entity of significance hinders the discussion of New Economic Geography. It limits the discussion in a national and global context and confines it to a smaller scale context. It also places limits on the nature of activities carried out in the firm and their position within the global value chain. Further work done by Bjorn Asheim (2001) and Gernot Grabher (2002) challenges the idea of the firm through action-research approaches and mapping organizational forms and their linkages. In short, the focus on the firm in new economic geographies is undertheorized in NEG1 and undercontextualized in NEG2, which limits the discussion of its impact on spatial economic development.

Spatial divisions within these arising New Economic geographies are apparent in the form of the [[digital divide]], as a result of regions attracting talented workers instead of developing skills at a local level (see [[Creative Class]] for further reading). Despite increasing inter-connectivity through developing information communication technologies, the contemporary world is still defined through its widening social and spatial divisions, most of which are increasingly gendered. [[Danny Quah]] explains these spatial divisions through the characteristics of knowledge goods in the New Economy: goods defined by their infinite expansibility, weightlessness, and [[Nonrival good|nonrivalry]]. Social divisions are expressed through new spatial segregation that illustrates spatial sorting by income, ethnicity, abilities, needs, and lifestyle preferences. Employment segregation can be seen through the overrepresentation of women and ethnic minorities in lower-paid service sector jobs. These divisions in the new economy are much more difficult to overcome as a result of few clear pathways of progression to higher-skilled work.

'''Eloquentia Perfecta,''' a tradition of the [[Society of Jesus]], is a value of Jesuit rhetoric that revolves around cultivating a person as a whole, as one learns to speak and write for the common good.

Steven Mallioux, a Professor of Rhetoric at [[Loyola Marymount University|LMU]], concluded that "an optimal orator would combine written and oral language concepts such as morality or ethics and intelligence." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mallioux|first=Steven|date=2013|title=A Good Person Speaking Well: Eloquentia Perfecta in U.S. Jesuit Colleges: A Brief Genealogy|url=|journal=Conversations on Jesuit Higher Education: Vol. 43, Article 6.|volume=|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept has expanded from education in Jesuit colleges and preaching this tradition and guiding [[Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola|Spiritual Exercises]] to courses in American Colleges such as [[Loyola Marymount University|Loyola Marymount University]], [[University of San Francisco]], and [[Fordham University]].

[[Loyola Marymount University|LMU]]'s core curriculum provides a few aspects that construct Eloquentia Perfecta, the first being that "It incorporates the traditional mode of rhetoric through writing, reading, speaking, and listening." The second aspect is, "The remediation of this form of rhetoric in terms of adapting to the information age and its digital elements." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lmu.edu/AssetFactory.aspx?did=65635|title=JESUIT RHETORICAL ARTS: ELOQUENTIA PERFECTA|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History  ==

=== Ancient History ===
In ancient Athens, they had a goal of "perfect eloquence" in their education system, which was long before the Jesuits existed.  They believed that speech had great power and could achieve many things with "perfect eloquence" way of speaking.  [[Isocrates]] taught the "art of word" in his school that he opened and continued with words are needed to express one's thoughts.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Malley|first=John W.|date=May 16, 2011|title=Eloquentia: a short history|url=|journal=America|publisher=America Press, Inc.|volume=204|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1500's ===
Jesuit education is believed by many Jesuits that the late sixteenth century's [[Ratio Studiorum]] was the founding document of Jesuit education. Under [[Ratio Studiorum]], "perfect eloquence" was renamed Eloquentia Perfecta.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Ratio was developed from an idea from [[Ignatius of Loyola]] vision of education which had a baseline of classical humanities with a Renaissance focus. In addition, there was some math and history. As students go up to higher education, there is an integration of the study of science, logic, philosophy, and theology. With each progressive year of education, the Jesuit values of Eloquentia Perfecta is integrated into the curriculum. The goals were not explicit but Eloquentia Perfecta are the ides of "developing an eloquent and mature. For example, when students gave speeches, they had to adapt to different audiences and be able to speak in a variety of styles to persuade the audience.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Changing Practice of Liberal Education and Rhetoric in Jesuit Education, 1600-2000|last=Leigh|first=David|publisher=Fordham University Press|year=2016|isbn=978-0-8232-6453-7|location=New York, NY|pages=125–137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1700's ===
As education of the eighteenth century arose, Jesuit education in France was revised with the addition of sciences, plays, speeches, and the discussion of philosophical ideas. Along with the revision, however, Jesuit education maintained the practices of lectures, critical thinking, public speaking, as well as challenging students with quizzes and exams.  The differences between traditional thinking and modern thinking provided a divide during changing times in the Enlightenment. The goal of education remained as the education aimed to strengthen the students communication skills with leadership skills, emotions, and eloquence. Students who attended Universities in the eighteenth century had the option of only getting a master's degree, however towards the end of the century, universities had incorporate BAs (Bachelor of Arts) and BSs (Bachelor of Science) degrees that students could get. If the student wanted to continue their education then they could get their master's as well.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== 1900's ===
American Jesuit liberal-arts-colleges in the mid-twentieth-century had a new major discipline incorporated into their educational system. In college, students would have to take two thirds of their college requirement credits on liberal education and the other third on their major. Before the twentieth century, students had to learn about classical core education, however, it has changed to a professional field which includes nursing, business, and education. Furthermore, there are still studies in rhetoric and logic that students are required to take involving speech and debate. In the education system, some teachers still use earlier Jesuit colleges methods where they provide lectures and exams while others use more recent methods like discussion and question-answer from students. Graduates from college during this time period say that the most crucial benefit they got out of their educational experience was that they "learned to think", which means integrating concepts from the old and new ideas in society in involving a person's mind and character.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Education  ==

=== Jesuit Rhetoric ===
In 1599, the [[Society of Jesus]] was presented with ''[[Ratio Studiorum]],'' which included Jesuit educational framework and rules for the professors of rhetoric.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Within this framework was the values of Eloquentia Perfecta which was, and continues to be, taught in Jesuit schools worldwide. These schools aim to promote Eloquentia Perfecta by educating their students into ideal [[orator]]s by incorporating critical thinking, civic responsibility, and ethics into a Jesuit rhetoric curriculum.

Gert Beista, the author of ''The Beautiful Risk of Education'', explains that there are three objectives to Jesuit rhetoric that focuses on, "reconnecting with the question of purpose in education." The first is that Jesuit rhetoric provides students with the knowledge, skills, and judgment that enables them to ‘‘do something’’ within their current society such as training for real-world issues with eloquence. The second of the three objectives is ''socialization'' where Beista states that, "Through education, we become members of and part of particular social, cultural and political orders." The last objective is what Beista likes to call, ''subjectification.'' This term is characterized to be the opposite of socialization, in which its emphasis is on individualization and independence in one's thinking and actions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mailloux|first=Steven|date=|title=Jesuit Eloquentia Perfecta and Theotropic Logology|url=|journal=Studies in Philosophy and Education|volume=34|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eloquentia Perfecta in Jesuit Colleges ===
Although Jesuit rhetoric promotes the study of Eloquentia Perfecta, by midcentury in the United States, Jesuit rhetorical studies differed little in comparison to rhetorical studies in non-Jesuit Schools. This is due to the similarity of the fundamental study of Aristotle, Cicero, and Quintilian. After the American Civil War, however, non-Jesuit colleges began to differ in the curriculum. This divergence was due to the molding of non-Jesuit schools by the elective system, while Jesuit colleges conserved classical courses involving Greek and Latin literature.

With the advancements of Jesuit rhetoric, Jesuit colleges introduced three important rhetorics written by Jesuits. These three rhetorics included ''Ars Dicendi'' by German Jesuit [[Joseph Kleutgen]], ''A Practical Introduction to English Rhetoric'', and ''The Art of Oratorical Composition'' both written by a Belgian-born Jesuit, [[Charles Coppen]]s. Coppens taught at multiple American Jesuit colleges including the Jesuit seminary [[St. Stanislaus Kostka Church (St. Louis, Missouri)|St. Stanislaus]] in Missouri. He defines the three terms rhetoric, oratory, and eloquence. Coppens states that rhetoric is, “the art of inventing, arranging, and expressing thought in a manner adapted to influence or control the minds and wills of others.” He defines oratory as, “the branch of rhetoric which expresses through orally.” Lastly, he defines eloquence as, “the expression or utterance of strong emotion in a manner adapted to excite correspondent emotions in others.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rhetorical Ways of Proceeding: Eloquentia Perfecta in American Jesuit Colleges|last=Mailloux|first=Steven|publisher=Fordham University Press|year=2016|isbn=9780823264520|location=United States of America|pages=162–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ignation Pedagogy ===
The [[Ignatius of Loyola]] created a document of the ''Spiritual Exercises,'' a sequence of meditations that have been utilized in universities. These spiritual practices have been around since the sixteenth century and have been more accessible to people around the world as it was published over 4,500 times. Jesuit Spiritual Exercises have been the groundwork of Ignation pedagogy, also known as the [[Ignatian Pedagogical Paradigm|Ignation pedagogical paradigm]]. Ignition pedagogy, which started in 1980's, is the discipline that cultivates a person's understanding, behavior, and contemplation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Unfinished Business of Eloquentia Perfecta in Twenty-First-Century Jesuit Higher Education|last=Gannett|first=Cinthia|publisher=Fordham University Press|year=2016|isbn=978-0-8232-6453-7|location=New York, New York|pages=277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Eloquentia Perfecta in Modern Times  ==

=== Adaptation to Rhetorical Changes in Eloquentia Perfecta ===
Many scholars might have the assumption that the original traditions of Eloquentia Perfecta have been erased in the later century, both through religious and academic teachings. However, though the term has been altered to fit modern society communication, the traditional teachings of the topic are very much alive.  Through both digital technology and verbal communication, Eloquentia Perfecta continues to carry on the original goal of rhetorical eloquence to spread justice to all. Many of the Jesuit scholars have had to really adapt to new medians of expression and constantly have to recreate lesson plans for students to adapt to current societal standards. As stated by Morgan T. Reitmeyer and Susan A. Sci in their article, How To Talk Ethically: Cultivating the Digital Citizen through Eloquentia Perfecta, "News is no longer something to simply consume; rather it is something to which we are compelled to respond within a wide array of media." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parmach|first=Robert J.|date=September 1, 2013|title=Talking Back: Eloquentia Perfecta: A Way of Proceeding|url=|journal=Article 24|volume=46|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As social justice has become a social phenomenon for current day societies, mainly because news is so easily accessible through digital devices, people are feeling more compelled to speak with Eloquentia Perfecta to portray their message.

=== Eloquentia Perfecta in the Digital Age ===
As many Jesuit-affiliated universities have created a required course for all incoming first year students to take on Eloquentia Perfecta, the goal of Eloquentia Perfecta teachings remain, which is to spread the oral and written justice to people all over. Our society's culture today is a place for people to share their voices publicly using all different types of technology. Many of the digital platforms (i.e. Snapchat, Twitter, and Instagram) allow people to integrate their personal insight and moral judgments to their followers. There are many famous people whom use their public voice on these platforms in society to relay eloquent, and justice messages to the public. Many of these messages relate to real-life issues within different cultures around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reitmeyer|first=Morgan T|last2=Sci|first2=Susan A.|date=March 1, 2013|title=How To Talk Ethically: Cultivating the Digital Citizen through Eloquentia Perfecta|url=|journal=Article 19|volume=43|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== People ===
One prime example of Eloquentia Perfecta, being  [[Jeannie Gaffigan]], a writer, actress, and Catholic comedian, was awarded the Inaugural Eloquentia Perfecta Award from Fordham’s Graduate School of Religion and Religious Education (GRE) and the Paulist Press in October 2016.  The award was given to Gaffigan because of her constant dedication to capturing the core significance of humanity.  As a public figure, and social activist, she shines light on the idea that humanity is full of flaws that must be addressed.  She bases her career on bringing people from all over the world together through skepticism, errors and uncertainty.  As she receives much of her inspiration through Catholic religion, one of her most inspirational quotes to live by is by St. Ignatius of Loyola, founder of Society of Jesus, which reads, “Love ought to manifest itself in deeds rather than in words,” and spreads this faith through her many social platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.fordham.edu/faith-and-service/catholic-comedian-jeannie-gaffigan-accepts-eloquentia-perfecta-award/|title=Catholic Comedian Jeannie Gaffigan Accepts Eloquentia Perfecta Award|work=Fordham Newsroom|access-date=2017-04-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''"Eloquentia Perfecta."'''''

Eloquentia Perfecta is the most fundamental goal of all of these four practices listed below.  The perfect eloquence is achieved through literature of many different cultures, where one must first understand other cultural and rhetorical languages to master this practice.  These practices were all created in the early ages of Jesuit teachings, yet all still are related to modern day times. Eloquentia Perfecta is ultimately the only quality in which one must have to fulfill any sort of leadership role. Many believe that it is more important to have perfect eloquence in language and communication than it is to have any sore of technology-based skills in higher up positions in society.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O’Malley|first=John S.J|date=March 1, 2013|title="Not for Ourselves Alone:" Rhetorical Education in the Jesuit Mode With Five Bullet Points for Today|url=|journal=Article 4|volume=43|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''“The fly in the bottle.”'''''

This metaphor first came alive by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] in 1914.  It originally was used to help students get out of their comfort ones and expand their critical thinking skills by becoming exposed to different languages and cultures.  It have been adopted into modern day education where educators can push students to think about the questions of life that don't necessarily apply to their particular areas of skill.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''''“Heritage and Perspective.”'''''

"Heritage and Perspective" became a popular value in school, as it teaches past-recognition.  It is based on the idea that modern day citizens are formed by the past and must grasp the concept that the past is still relevant to today's world. Without the knowledge of the past it is hard to understand some of the current situations in which an individual in society might get caught up in.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''''“We are not born for ourselves alone.”'''''

[[Pedro Arrupe|Father Pedro Arrupe]] made the assertion that all students must become people of the world who help people to truly reach the fundamental goal of academic Jesuit teachings.  He meant this in a rhetorical and philosophical way and not only referred to pure Jesuit practice. Women and men should be serving others to truly reach the Jesuit-practice goals.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''''“The spirit of finesse.”'''''

This phrase became well known by [[Henri-Irénée Marrou|Henri Marrou]], as he dubbed it as the opposite of “geometric spirit.” This phrase is made to push its followers into a humane mentality.  It is meant to “weave webs with words that reflect the webs we weave with our lives, which are not neat geometric patterns but broken in places and filled with knots and tangles.” &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Epigenome editing''' or '''Epigenome engineering''' is a type of genetic engineering in which the [[epigenome]] is modified at specific sites using engineered molecules targeted to those sites (as opposed to whole-genome modifications). Whereas gene editing involves changing the actual DNA sequence itself, epigenetic editing involves modifying and presenting DNA sequences to proteins and other DNA binding factors that influence DNA function. By "editing” epigenomic features in this manner, researchers can determine the exact biological role of an epigenetic modification at the site in question.

The engineered proteins used for epigenome editing are composed of a DNA binding domain that target specific sequences and an effector domain that modifies epigenomic features. Currently, three major groups of DNA binding proteins have been predominantly used for epigenome editing: [[Zinc finger]] proteins, [[TAL effector|Transcription Activator-Like Effectors (TALEs)]] and nuclease deficient Cas9 fusions ([[CRISPR]]).

== General concept ==

Comparing genome-wide [[epigenetic]] maps with [[gene expression]] has allowed researchers to assign either activating or repressing roles to specific modifications. The importance of DNA sequence in regulating the epigenome has been demonstrated by using DNA motifs to predict epigenomic modification.&lt;ref name="Whitaker"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Whitaker JW|author2=Wang W|first=Chen Z|title=Predicting the human epigenome from DNA motifs|journal=Nature Methods|date=2014|doi=10.1038/nmeth.3065|volume=12|issue=3|pages=265–272|pmid=25240437|pmc=4344378}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further insights into mechanisms behind [[epigenetics]] have come from [[in vitro]] biochemical and structural analyses. Using [[model organism]]s, researchers have been able to describe the role of many [[chromatin]] factors through [[Gene knockout|knockout]] studies. However knocking out an entire chromatin modifier has massive effects on the entire genome, which may not be an accurate representation of its function in a specific context. As one example of this, [[DNA methylation]] occurs at [[Repeated sequence (DNA)|repeat regions]], [[Promoter (genetics)|promoters]], [[Enhancer (genetics)|enhancers]], and [[gene]] bodies. Although [[DNA methylation]] at gene promoters typically correlates with gene repression, methylation at gene bodies is correlated with gene activation, and DNA methylation may also play a role in gene splicing.&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=Peter A.|title=Functions of DNA methylation: islands, start sites, gene bodies and beyond|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|date=29 May 2012|volume=13|issue=7|pages=484–492|doi=10.1038/nrg3230|pmid=22641018}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The ability to directly target and edit individual methylation sites is critical to determining the exact function of DNA methylation at a specific site. Epigenome editing is a powerful tool that allows this type of analysis. For site-specific DNA methylation editing as well as for histone editing, genome editing systems have been adapted into epigene editing systems. In short, genome homing proteins with engineered or naturally occurring nuclease functions for gene editing, can be mutated and adapted into purely delivery systems. An epigenetic modifying enzyme or domain can be fused to the homing protein and local epigenetic modifications can be altered upon protein recruitment. 

=== Targeting proteins ===

==== TALE ====

The [[TAL effector|Transcription Activator-Like Effector (TALE)]] protein recognizes specific DNA sequences based on the composition of its [[DNA binding domain]].&lt;ref name="Gaj"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gaj|first=Thomas|author2=Gersbach, Charles A. |author3=Barbas, Carlos F. |title=ZFN, TALEN, and CRISPR/Cas-based methods for genome engineering|journal=Trends in Biotechnology|date=2013|volume=31|issue=7|pages=397–405|doi=10.1016/j.tibtech.2013.04.004|pmid=23664777|pmc=3694601}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This allows the researcher to construct different TALE proteins to recognize a target DNA sequence by editing the TALE's primary protein structure. The binding specificity of this protein is then typically confirmed using [[Chromatin Immunoprecipitation]] (ChIP) and [[Sanger sequencing]] of the resulting DNA fragment.&lt;ref name="Konermann"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Konermann|first=Silvana|author2=Brigham, Mark D. |author3=Trevino, Alexandro |author4=Hsu, Patrick D. |author5=Heidenreich, Matthias |author6=Le Cong |author7=Platt, Randall J. |author8=Scott, David A. |author9=Church, George M. |author10=Zhang, Feng|title=Optical control of mammalian endogenous transcription and epigenetic states|journal=Nature|date=2013|doi=10.1038/nature12466 |pmid=23877069 |pmc=3856241 |volume=500 |issue=7463|pages=472–6|url=https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/11879742/3856241.pdf?sequence=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maeder"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maeder|first=Morgan L |author2=Angstman, James F |author3=Richardson, Marcy E |author4=Linder, Samantha J |author5=Cascio, Vincent M |author6=Tsai, Shengdar Q |author7=Ho, Quan H |author8=Sander, Jeffry D |author9=Reyon, Deepak |author10=Bernstein, Bradley E |author11=Costello, Joseph F |author12=Wilkinson, Miles F |author13=Joung, J Keith |title=Targeted DNA demethylation and activation of endogenous genes using programmable TALE-TET1 fusion proteins|journal=Nature Biotechnology|date=2013|volume=31|issue=12|pages=1137–1142|doi=10.1038/nbt.2726 |pmid=24108092 |pmc=3858462}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mendenhall"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mendenhall|first=Eric M|author2=Williamson, Kaylyn E |author3=Reyon, Deepak |author4=Zou, James Y |author5=Ram, Oren |author6=Joung, J Keith |author7= Bernstein, Bradley E |title=Locus-specific editing of histone modifications at endogenous enhancers|journal=Nature Biotechnology|date=2013|volume=31|issue=12|pages=1133–1136|doi=10.1038/nbt.2701 |pmid=24013198 |pmc=3858395}}&lt;/ref&gt; This confirmation is still required on all TALE sequence recognition research.&lt;ref name="Voigt"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Voigt|first=Philipp|author2=Reinberg, Danny|title=Epigenome editing|journal=Nature Biotechnology|date=2013|volume=31|issue=12|pages=1097–1099|doi=10.1038/nbt.2756|pmid=24316647}}&lt;/ref&gt;
When used for epigenome editing, these DNA binding proteins are attached to an effector protein. Effector proteins that have been used for this purpose include [[TET1|Ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase 1 (TET1)]],&lt;ref name="Maeder" /&gt; [[LSD1|Lysine (K)-specific demethylase 1A (LSD1)]]&lt;ref name="Mendenhall" /&gt; and [[CIB1|Calcium and integrin binding protein 1 (CIB1)]].&lt;ref name="Konermann" /&gt;

==== Zinc finger proteins ====

The use of [[zinc finger]]-fusion proteins to recognize sites for epigenome editing has been explored as well. Maeder et al. has constructed a ZF-TET1 protein for use in DNA demethylation.&lt;ref name="Maeder" /&gt; These zinc finger proteins work similarly to [[TAL effector|TALE proteins]] in that they are able to bind to sequence specific sites in on the DNA based on their protein structure which can be modified. Chen et al. have successfully used a zinc finger DNA binding domain coupled with the [[TET1]] protein to induce demethylation of several previously silenced genes.&lt;ref name="Chen"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chen|first=H. |author2=Kazemier, H. G. |author3=de Groote, M. L. |author4=Ruiters, M. H. J. |author5=Xu, G.-L. |author6=Rots, M. G. |title=Induced DNA demethylation by targeting Ten-Eleven Translocation 2 to the human ICAM-1 promoter|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|date=2013|volume=42|issue=3|pages=1563–1574|doi=10.1093/nar/gkt1019 |pmid=24194590 |pmc=3919596}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== CRISPR-Cas ====

The [[CRISPR|Clustered Regulatory Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat (CRISPR)]]-Cas system functions as a DNA site-specific nuclease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.neb.com/tools-and-resources/feature-articles/crispr-cas9-and-targeted-genome-editing-a-new-era-in-molecular-biology|title=CRISPR/Cas9 and Targeted Genome Editing: A New Era in Molecular Biology {{!}} NEB|last=Biolabs|first=New England|website=www.neb.com|access-date=2016-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the well-studied type II CRISPR system, the Cas9 nuclease associates with a chimera composed of tracRNA and crRNA. This chimera is frequently referred to as a guide RNA (gRNA). When the Cas9 protein associates with a DNA region-specific gRNA, the Cas9 cleaves DNA at targeted DNA loci. However, when the D10A and H840A point mutations are introduced, a catalytically-dead Cas9 (dCas9) is generated that can bind DNA but will not cleave.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.addgene.org/crispr/guide/|title=Addgene: CRISPR/Cas9 Guide|website=www.addgene.org|access-date=2016-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dCas9 system has been utilized for targeted epigenetic reprogramming in order to introduce site-specific DNA methylation. By fusing the [[DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 3A|DNMT3a]] catalytic domain with the dCas9 protein, dCas9-DNMT3a is capable of achieving targeted DNA methylation of a targeted region as specified by the present guide RNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McDonald|first=James I.|last2=Celik|first2=Hamza|last3=Rois|first3=Lisa E.|last4=Fishberger|first4=Gregory|last5=Fowler|first5=Tolison|last6=Rees|first6=Ryan|last7=Kramer|first7=Ashley|last8=Martens|first8=Andrew|last9=Edwards|first9=John R.|date=2016-05-09|title=Reprogrammable CRISPR/Cas9-based system for inducing site-specific DNA methylation|url=http://bio.biologists.org/content/early/2016/05/03/bio.019067|journal=Biology Open|language=en|pages=866–74|doi=10.1242/bio.019067|issn=2046-6390|pmid=27170255|volume=5|issue=6|pmc=4920199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, dCas9 has been fused with the catalytic core of the human acetyltransferase [[EP300|p300]]. dCas9-p300 successfully catalyzes targeted acetylation of histone H3 lysine 27.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hilton|first=Isaac B.|last2=D'Ippolito|first2=Anthony M.|last3=Vockley|first3=Christopher M.|last4=Thakore|first4=Pratiksha I.|last5=Crawford|first5=Gregory E.|last6=Reddy|first6=Timothy E.|last7=Gersbach|first7=Charles A.|date=2015-05-01|title=Epigenome editing by a CRISPR-Cas9-based acetyltransferase activates genes from promoters and enhancers|url=http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v33/n5/abs/nbt.3199.html|journal=Nature Biotechnology|language=en|volume=33|issue=5|pages=510–517|doi=10.1038/nbt.3199|issn=1087-0156|pmc=4430400|pmid=25849900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Commonly used effector proteins ===

[[TET1]] induces demethylation of cytosine at [[CpG sites]]. This protein has been used to activate genes that are repressed by CpG methylation and to determine the role of individual CpG methylation sites.&lt;ref name="Maeder" /&gt; [[LSD1]] induces the demethylation of H3K4me1/2, which also causes an indirect effect of deacetylation on H3K27. This effector can be used on [[histones]] in enhancer regions, which can changes the expression of neighboring genes.&lt;ref name="Mendenhall" /&gt; [[CIB1]] is a light sensitive [[cryptochrome]], this cryptochrome is fused to the TALE protein. A second protein contains an interaction partner ([[CRY2]]) fused with a [[chromatin]]/DNA modifier (ex. [[SID4X]]). [[CRY2]] is able to interact with [[CIB1]] when the cryptochrome has been activated by illumination with blue light.&lt;ref name="Liu"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liu|first=H.|author2=Yu, X. |author3=Li, K. |author4=Klejnot, J. |author5=Yang, H. |author6=Lisiero, D. |author7= Lin, C. |title=Photoexcited CRY2 Interacts with CIB1 to Regulate Transcription and Floral Initiation in Arabidopsis|journal=Science|date=2008|volume=322|issue=5907|pages=1535–1539|doi=10.1126/science.1163927|pmid=18988809}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interaction allows the chromatin modifier to act on the desired location. This means that the modification can be performed in an inducible and reversible manner, which reduces long-term secondary effects that would be caused by constitutive epigenetic modification.&lt;ref name="Konermann" /&gt; 

== Applications ==

=== Studying enhancer function and activity ===

Editing of gene enhancer regions in the genome through targeted epigenetic modification has been demonstrated by Mendenhall et al. (2013).&lt;ref name="Mendenhall" /&gt; This study utilized a TALE-LSD1 effector fusion protein in order to target enhancers of genes, to induce enhancer silencing in order to deduce enhancer activity and gene control. Targeting specific enhancers followed by locus specific [[Real-time polymerase chain reaction|RT-qPCR]] allows for the genes affected by the silenced enhancer to be determined. Alternatively, inducing enhancer silencing in regions upstream of genes allows for gene expression to be altered. [[Real-time polymerase chain reaction|RT-qPCR]] can then be utilized to study effects of this on gene expression. This allows for enhancer function and activity to be studied in detail.&lt;ref name="Mendenhall" /&gt;

=== Determining the function of specific methylation sites ===

It is important to understand the role specific methylation sites play regulating in gene expression. To study this, one research group used a TALE-TET1 fusion protein to demethylate a single CpG methylation site.&lt;ref name="Maeder" /&gt; Although this approach requires many controls to ensure specific binding to target loci, a properly performed study using this approach can determine the biological function of a specific CpG methylation site.&lt;ref name="Maeder" /&gt;

=== Determining the role of epigenetic modifications directly ===

Epigenetic editing using an inducible mechanism offers a wide array of potential use to study epigenetic effects in various states. One research group employed an [[optogenetic]] two-hybrid system which integrated the sequence specific TALE DNA-binding domain with a light-sensitive cryptochrome 2 protein ([[CIB1]]).&lt;ref name="Konermann" /&gt; Once expressed in the cells, the system was able to inducibly edit histone modifications and determine their function in a specific context.&lt;ref name="Konermann" /&gt;

== Limitations ==

Sequence specificity is critically important in epigenome editing and must be carefully verified (this can be done using [[chromatin immunoprecipitation]] followed by [[Sanger sequencing]] to verify the targeted sequence).&lt;ref name="Voigt" /&gt; It is unknown if the TALE fusion may cause effects on the catalytic activity of the epigenome modifier. This could be especially important in effector proteins that require multiple subunits and complexes such as the [[Polycomb]] repressive complex.&lt;ref name="Voigt" /&gt; Proteins used for epigenome editing may obstruct ligands and substrates at the target site.&lt;ref name="Voigt" /&gt; The TALE protein itself may even compete with [[transcription factors]] if they are targeted to the same sequence.&lt;ref name="Voigt" /&gt; In addition, DNA repair systems could reverse the alterations on the chromatin and prevent the desired changes from being made.&lt;ref name="Voigt" /&gt; It is therefore necessary for fusion constructs and targeting mechanisms to be optimized for reliable and repeatable epigenome editing.

The '''European Law Students' Association''' ('''ELSA''') is an international, independent, non-political, non-profit, [[non-governmental organisation]] run by and for law students. ELSA-activities comprise a large variety of academic and professional events that are organised to fulfill the stated vision of ELSA.

==History==
Five law students from [[Austria]], [[Hungary]], [[Poland]] and [[West Germany]] founded ELSA on 4 May 1981. It claims to be the world's largest independent law students association and to be represented at nearly 375 law faculties in 44 countries&lt;ref&gt;https://elsa.org/about/network/&lt;/ref&gt; across Europe with membership of some 50,000 students and young lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;https://elsa.org/#home&lt;/ref&gt;

ELSA-activities comprise a large variety of academic and professional events that are organised to fulfill the stated vision of ELSA and in order to provide its members opportunities to enhance their skills and to interact with each other.

==Organization==
ELSA is organized into local member groups active at university level (Local Group), national member groups active on a national level (National Group), and ELSA International active on an international level. 

Membership of ELSA for individual law students is possible through the Local Groups (for instance ELSA Leiden&lt;ref&gt;https://www.elsaleiden.nl/nl/&lt;/ref&gt;). The Local Groups are member of a National Group (for instance ELSA the Netherlands&lt;ref&gt;http://elsa-thenetherlands.org/&lt;/ref&gt;). The National Groups are part of the international ELSA network, which is managed by ELSA International with headquarters in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]]. ELSA International consists of the International Board, the ELSA International Team, and the Auditors of ELSA.&lt;ref&gt;https://elsa.org/about/team/&lt;/ref&gt; 

The International Board is the supreme executive body of the association. Its members are elected at an International Council Meeting (ICM) (which consists of all the National Groups) for a one-year period. The International Board's responsibilities include the overall co-ordination of the organisation as a whole including the support of member groups both locally and nationally. The International Board also co-ordinates and develops ELSA's collaboration with various international organisations and institutions, governments, law firms, and companies across Europe.

==Identity==
ELSA's 350 university-based local groups and 44 national groups as well as the international board are entirely student-managed and administered. Similar to a small franchise, each group creates its own plan of operation in line with the overall goals of the association. Each group recruits and trains its volunteer executives and markets ELSA's programmes to the academic and business community. In combination with the university curriculum, ELSA prepares its members for their future entry into professional life, especially when working in an international environment. The philosophy of ELSA is defined by the following statements regarding its vision, purpose, and means&lt;ref&gt;https://elsa.org/about/&lt;/ref&gt;: 

''Vision:''&lt;br&gt;"A just world in which there is respect for human dignity and cultural diversity".

''Purpose:''&lt;br&gt;"To contribute to legal education, to foster mutual understanding and to promote social responsibility of law students and young lawyers".

''Means:''&lt;br&gt;
*Providing opportunities for law students and young lawyers to learn about other cultures and legal systems in a spirit of critical dialogue and scientific co-operation.
*Assisting law students and young lawyers to be internationally minded and professionally skilled.
*Encouraging law students and young lawyers to act for the good of society.

==Institutional relations==
ELSA has gained consultative status with several United Nations bodies. In 1994, ELSA was granted Consultative Status in Category C in [[UNESCO]] (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization)&lt;ref&gt;https://en.unesco.org/partnerships/non-governmental-organizations/european-law-students-association&lt;/ref&gt;, and in 1997 ELSA obtained Special Consultative Status with [[ECOSOC]] (United Nations Economic and Social Council)&lt;ref&gt;See section II http://undocs.org/E/2016/INF/5&lt;/ref&gt;. In addition [[UNCITRAL]] (United Nations Commission on International Trade Law) is inviting ELSA delegations to participate in their sessions.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

ELSA was part of the Diplomatic Conference of 1998 in [[Rome]] where the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] was adopted to establish the [[International Criminal Court]]. ELSA participated with a delegation as an NGO represented by an observer.&lt;ref&gt;See Annex IV http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/finalfra.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, ELSA was granted Participatory Status with the [[Council of Europe]]&lt;ref&gt;http://coe-ngo.org/#/ingos&lt;/ref&gt;. This cooperation was further widened with the signing of a Human Rights Partnership between Council of Europe and ELSA in 2008&lt;ref&gt;https://www.coe.int/en/web/human-rights-channel/elsa&lt;/ref&gt;.

Furthermore, ELSA has a co-operation agreement with [[UNHCR]] (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees).{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} In October 2005, ELSA obtained Observer Status with [[WIPO]] (World Intellectual Property Organization)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wipo.int/members/en/organizations.jsp?type=ngo_int&lt;/ref&gt;.

Since 2002, ELSA organizes the [[John H. Jackson Moot Court Competition]] (formerly known as ELSA Moot Court Competition) with the support of the WTO.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/emc2_maps_e.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The final round is held at the WTO headquarters in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news17_e/disp_06jun17_e.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
ELSA's activities include the organization of:

*[[John H. Jackson Moot Court Competition]] (previously called ELSA Moot Court Competition) on WTO Law.
*Lectures, seminars, and conference (both local and international)
*Study visits
*Institutional visits
*[[Essay]] competitions
*[[Moot court|Moot courts]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2375">The '''Fritz John conditions''' (abbr. '''FJ conditions'''), in [[mathematics]], are a [[necessary and sufficient conditions|necessary condition]] for a solution in [[nonlinear programming]] to be [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimal]]. They are used as lemma in the proof of the [[Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions]], but they are relevant on their own.

We consider the following [[optimization problem]]:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
    \text{minimize } &amp; f(x) \, \\
    \text{subject to: } &amp; g_i(x) \ge 0,\ i \in \left \{1,\dots,m \right \}\\
        &amp; h_j(x) = 0, \ j \in \left \{m+1,\dots,n \right \}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''&amp;fnof;'' is the [[function (mathematics)|function]] to be minimized, &lt;math&gt;g_i&lt;/math&gt; the inequality [[constraint (mathematics)|constraints]] and &lt;math&gt;h_j&lt;/math&gt; the equality constraints, and where, respectively, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I'}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt; are the [[indexed family|indices]] [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of inactive, active and equality constraints and &lt;math&gt;x^*&lt;/math&gt; is an optimal solution of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, then there exists a non-zero vector &lt;math&gt;\lambda=[\lambda_0, \lambda _1, \lambda _2,\dots,\lambda _n]&lt;/math&gt; such that:

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{cases}
   \lambda_0 \nabla f(x^*) + \sum\limits_{i\in \mathcal{I}'} \lambda_i \nabla g_i(x^*) + \sum\limits_{i\in \mathcal{E}} \lambda_i \nabla h_i (x^*) =0\\[10pt]
   \lambda_i \ge 0,\  i\in \mathcal{I}'\cup\{0\} \\[10pt]
   \exists i\in \left( \{0,1,\ldots ,n\} \backslash \mathcal{I} \right) \left( \lambda_i \ne 0 \right)
\end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\lambda_0&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; [[If and only if|if]] the &lt;math&gt;\nabla g_i (i\in\mathcal{I}')&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nabla h_i (i\in\mathcal{E})&lt;/math&gt; are [[linearly independent]] or, more generally, when a [[Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions#Regularity conditions .28or constraint qualifications.29|constraint qualification]] holds.

Named after [[Fritz John]], these conditions are equivalent to the [[Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions]] in the case &lt;math&gt;\lambda_0 &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;. When &lt;math&gt;\lambda_0=0&lt;/math&gt;, the condition is equivalent to the violation of Mangasarian Fromovitz Constraint Qualification (MFCQ). In other words, the Fritz John condition is equivalent to the optimality condition KKT or not-MFCQ.

A '''human-based computation game''' or '''game with a purpose''' ('''GWAP'''&lt;ref name="GWAP"/&gt;) is a [[human-based computation]] technique of outsourcing steps within a computational process to humans in an entertaining way ([[gamification]]).&lt;ref name="vonAhn2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vonAhn2008"/&gt;

[[Luis von Ahn]] first proposed the idea of "human algorithm games", or games with a purpose (GWAPs), in order to harness human time and energy for addressing problems that computers cannot yet tackle on their own. He believes that human intellect is an important resource and contribution to the enhancement of computer processing and human computer interaction. He argues that games constitute a general mechanism for using brainpower to solve open computational problems. In this technique, human brains are compared to processors in a distributed system, each performing a small task of a massive computation. However, humans require an incentive to become part of a collective computation. Online games are used as a means to encourage participation in the process.&lt;ref name="vonAhn2008"/&gt;

The tasks presented in these games are usually trivial for humans, but difficult for computers. These tasks include labeling images, transcribing ancient texts, common sense or human experience based activities, and more. Human-based computation games motivate people through entertainment rather than an interest in solving computation problems. This makes GWAPs more appealing to a larger audience. GWAPs can be used to help build the semantic web, annotate and classify collected data, crowdsource general knowledge, and improving other general computer processes.&lt;ref name="vonAhn2008"/&gt;
GWAPs have a vast range of applications in variety of areas such as security, computer vision, Internet accessibility, adult content filtering, and Internet search.&lt;ref name="vonAhn2006"/&gt; In applications such as these, games with a purpose have lowered the cost of annotating data and increased the level of human participation.

==History==

The first human-based computation game or games with a purpose was created in 2004 by [[Luis von Ahn]]. The game was called [[ESP game|ESP]] because players had to come up with labels for images and try to guess what labels a randomly designated partner was coming up with.&lt;ref&gt;Von Ahn, L., &amp; Dabbish, L. (2004, April). Labeling images with a computer game. In Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on Human factors in computing systems (pp. 319-326). ACM.&lt;/ref&gt; The game marked the first of many microtask games.  Microtask games are games containing a simple task that can be solved quickly without the need of any credentials. More specifically, [[ESP game|ESP]] was an output-agreement game.  Games with a Purpose categorized as output-agreement games are microtask games where a pair of randomly assigned partners try to match output with each other given a shared input visible to both. In 2006 von Ahn introduced another microtask game called Peekaboom.  This game extended upon [[ESP game|ESP]] by having players associate a labels with a specific region of an image.  Peekaboom demonstrated a new type of microtask game known as inversion-problem games.  In inversion-problem games, two players are randomly paired together where one is assigned as the describer and the other as the guesser.  The describer is given an input which the guesser must reproduce given hints from the describer.  In ''Peekaboom'', for example, the describer slowly reveals small sections of an image until the guesser correctly guesses the label provided to the describer.&lt;ref&gt;Von Ahn, L., Liu, R., &amp; Blum, M. (2006, April). Peekaboom: a game for locating objects in images. In Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on Human Factors in computing systems (pp. 55-64). ACM.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 Edith L. M. Law created the game called ''TagATune''.  In this game, players label sound clips.  TagATune contributed a new category of microtask games known as input-agreement games.  In input-agreement games two randomly paired players are each given an input that is hidden from the other player.  Player inputs will either match or be different.  The goal of these games is for players to tag their input such that the other player can determine whether or not the two inputs match.  In TagATune, players describe sound clips and guess if their partner's sound clip is the same as their own given their partner's tags.&lt;ref&gt;Law, E. L., Von Ahn, L., Dannenberg, R. B., &amp; Crawford, M. (2007, September). TagATune: A Game for Music and Sound Annotation. In ISMIR (Vol. 3, p. 2).&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2008, [[Foldit]] was introduced by Seth Cooper.  ''Foldit'' was the first game with a purpose to be considered a macrotask game.  Macrotask games contain complex problems usually left to experts to solve.  In ''Foldit'', player attempt to fold a three-dimensional representation of a protein.  While this is a hard problem of computers to automate completely, it is not hard to score.  Thus players are able to focus on their score to perform this complex task without much knowledge of biology.&lt;ref&gt;Khatib, F., Cooper, S., Tyka, M. D., Xu, K., Makedon, I., Popović, Z., ... &amp; Players, F. (2011). Algorithm discovery by protein folding game players. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 108(47), 18949-18953.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lafourcade, M., Joubert, A., &amp; Le Brun, N. (2015). Games with a Purpose (GWAPS). John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Von Ahn, L., &amp; Dabbish, L. (2008). Designing games with a purpose. Communications of the ACM, 51(8), 58-67.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
===''Apetopia''===
The ''Apetopia'' game helps determining perceived color differences. Players' choices are used to model better color metrics.&lt;ref name="colors.htw-berlin.de"&gt;http://colors.htw-berlin.de&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Apetopia'' game, which was launched by [[University of Berlin]], is designed to help scientists understand perceived color differences. ''Apetopia'' is an easy game, accessible to all the public which requires no special skills except manual dexterity that all the experts of this kind of game usually possess. The ''Apetopia'' game helps determine perceived color differences. Players choices are used to model better color metrics.&lt;ref name="colors.htw-berlin.de"/&gt; This game is intended to provide data on how the shades of color are perceived by people in order to model the best color parameters.

As of September 2013, Artigo had over 30,000 (pictures of) artworks mostly of Europe and of the "[[Long nineteenth century|long 19th century]]", from the Promotheus Image Archive,&lt;ref&gt;http://prometheus-bildarchiv.de/en/index&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Rijksmuseum]], Amsterdam, The Netherlands, the [[Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe]], Karlsruhe, Germany, the [[University Museum of Contemporary Art]], campus of the University of Massachusetts Amherst, USA. From 2008 through 2013, Artigo has collected over 7 million of tags (mostly in German), 180,000 players (about a tenth of whom are registered), and in average 150 players per day.&lt;ref&gt;[https://blog.artigo.org/ Artigo Blog (in German)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Artigo is a joint research endeavor of art historians and computer scientists aiming at both, developing an art work search engine and data analysis in art history.

===Duolingo===
{{main|Duolingo}}
''[[Duolingo]]'' is a second language learning game that helps translating the web and Wikipedia specifically to languages other than English .&lt;ref&gt;https://www.duolingo.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

===ESP game===
{{main|ESP game}}
The first example was the [[ESP game]], an effort in [[human computation]] originally conceived by [[Luis von Ahn]] of [[Carnegie Mellon University]], which labels images. To make it an entertaining effort for humans, two players attempt to assign the same labels to an image. The game records the results of matches as image labels and the players enjoy the encounter because of the competitive and timed nature of it. To ensure that people do their best to accurately label the images, the game requires two people (chosen at random and unknown to each other), who have only the image in common, to choose the same word as an image label. This discourages [[vandalism]] because it would be self-defeating as a [[strategy]].
The ESP game is a human-based computation game developed to address the problem of creating difficult [[metadata]]. The idea behind the game is to use the computational power of humans to perform a task that [[computers]] cannot (originally, [[image recognition]]) by packaging the task as a [[game]]. It was originally conceived by [[Luis von Ahn]] of [[Carnegie Mellon University]]. [[Google]] bought a licence to create its own version of the game (Google Image Labeler) in 2006 in order to return better search results for its online images.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7395751.stm "Solving the web's image problem"]. bbc. 2008-05-14. Retrieved 2008-12-14.&lt;/ref&gt; The license of the data acquired by Ahn's ESP Game, or the Google version, is not clear.{{clarify|date=June 2016}} Google's version was shut down on 16 September 2011 as part of the Google Labs closure in September 2011.

===EteRNA===
{{main|EteRNA}}

[[EteRNA]] is a game in which players attempt to design [[RNA]] sequences that fold into a given configuration. The widely varied solutions from players, often non-biologists, are evaluated to improve computer models predicting RNA folding. Some designs are actually [[RNA synthesis|synthesized]] to evaluate the actual folding dynamics and directly compare with the computer models.

===''Eyewire''===
''[[Eyewire]]'' is a game for finding the [[connectome]] of the [[retina]].&lt;ref&gt;http://eyewire.org&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foldit===
{{main|Foldit}}

[[Crowdsourcing]] has been gamified in games like [[Foldit]], a game designed by the [[University of Washington]], in which players compete to manipulate proteins into more efficient structures. A 2010 paper in science journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' credited Foldit's 57,000 players with providing useful results that matched or outperformed algorithmically computed solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=In a Video Game, Tackling the Complexities of Protein Folding |author=John Markoff |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/05/science/05protein.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=10 August 2010 |accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Foldit'', while also a GWAP, has a different type of method for tapping the collective human brain. This game challenges players to use their human intuition of 3-dimensional space to help with protein folding algorithms. Unlike the ESP game, which focuses on the results that humans are able to provide, Foldit is trying to understand how humans approach complicated 3 dimensional objects. By 'watching' how humans play the game, researchers hope to be able to improve their own computer programs. Instead of simply performing tasks that computers cannot do, this GWAP is asking humans to help make current machine algorithms better.

===Guess the Correlation===
{{main|Guess the Correlation}}

Guess the Correlation is a game with a purpose challenging players to guess the true [[Pearson correlation coefficient]] in scatter plots. The collected data is used to study what features in scatter plots skew human perception of the true correlation. The game was developed by Omar Wagih at the [[European Bioinformatics Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The 8-Bit Game That Makes Statistics Addictive |author=Ed Yong |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/03/the-8-bit-game-that-makes-statistics-addictive/475848/ |newspaper=The Atlantic |date=30 March 2016 |accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guessthecorrelation.com|title=Guess the Correlation|author=Omar Wagih|date=10 December 2015|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''JeuxDeMots''===
''{{ill|JeuxDeMots|fr|JeuxDeMots|vertical-align=sup}}''&lt;ref name="JeuxDeMots"/&gt; is a game aiming to build a large [[semantic network]]. People are asked to associate terms according to some instructions that are provided for a given word. The French version of the produced network contains so far more than 160 million relations between 2 million lexical items (October 2017). The project was developed by academics of the [[Laboratoire d'Informatique, de Robotique et de Microélectronique de Montpellier]]/[[Montpellier 2 University]].

===''Nanocrafter''===
''Nanocrafter'' is a game about assembling pieces of [[DNA]] into structures with functional properties, such as [[Logic gate|logic circuits]], to solve problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Science {{!}} Nanocrafter|url = http://nanocrafter.org/science|website = nanocrafter.org|accessdate = 2015-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Foldit, it is developed at the [[University of Washington]].

===''OnToGalaxy''===
''OnToGalaxy'' is a game in which players help to acquire common sense knowledge about words. As implemented as a space shooter, ''OnToGalaxy'' in its design quite different from other human computation games.&lt;ref name="OnToTheGalaxy"/&gt; The game was developed by Markus Krause at the [[University of Bremen]].

===''Phrase Detectives''===
''Phrase Detectives'' is an "annotation game" geared towards lovers of literature, grammar and language. It lets users indicate relationships between words and phrases to create a resource that is rich in linguistic information. Players are awarded with points for their contributions and are featured on a leader board.&lt;ref name="PhraseDet"/&gt; It was developed by academics Jon Chamberlain, Massimo Poesio and Udo Kruschwitz at the [[University of Essex]].

===''Phylo''===
{{main|Phylo (video game)}}
The ''[[Phylo (video game)|Phylo]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Lisa | last=Grossman | url=https://www.wired.com/2010/11/phylo-game | title=Computer Game Makes You a Genetic Scientist | work=Wired | date=30 November 2010 | accessdate=2 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; allows gamers to contribute to the greater good by trying to decode the code for genetic diseases. While playing the game and aligning the colored squares, one is helping the scientific community get a step closer to solving the age-old problem of [[multiple sequence alignment]]. The problem of multiple sequence alignment is too big for computers to handle. The goal is to understand how and where the function of an organism is encoded in the DNA. The game explains that "a sequence alignment is a way of arranging the sequences of DNA, RNA or protein to identify regions of similarity".

===''Play to Cure: Genes in Space''===
''Play to Cure™: Genes in Space'' is a mobile game that uses the collective force of players to analyse real genetic data to help with cancer research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Play to Cure: Genes in Space|url=http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/support-us/play-to-cure-genes-in-space|website=cancerresearchuk.org|accessdate=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Quantum Moves''===
''[[Quantum Moves]]'' is a dexterity and spatial problem solving game, where players move slippery particles across quantum space. Players' solutions on various levels are used to program and fine tune a real [[quantum computer]] at [[Aarhus University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scienceathome.org/index.php?Scientific+challenge|title=Do Science at Home|publisher=Department of Physics and Astronom, Aarhus University|accessdate=13 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The game was first developed as a graphical interface for quantum simulation and education in 2012. In 2013 it was released to the public in a user-friendly form, and has been continually updated throughout 2014.

===''Reverse The Odds''===
''Reverse The Odds'' is a mobile based game which helps researchers learn about analyzing cancers. By incorporating data analysis into Reverse The Odds, researchers can get thousands of players to help them learn more about different cancers including head and neck, lung, and bladder cancer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/support-us/citizen-science-apps-and-games-from-cancer-research-uk/reverse-the-odds&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sea Hero Quest===
{{main|Sea Hero Quest}}
''[[Sea Hero Quest]]'' is an IOx and Android based game that helps advancing the research in the field of dementia .&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seaheroquest.com/site/en
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Smorball'' ===
In the browser-based game ''Smorball'',&lt;ref&gt;http://smorballgame.org&lt;/ref&gt; players are asked to type the words they see as quickly and accurately as possible to help their team to victory in the fictional sport of Smorball. The game presents players with phrases from scanned pages in the Biodiversity Heritage Library. After verification, the words players type are sent to the libraries that store the corresponding pages, allowing those pages to be searched and data mined and ultimately making historic literature more usable for institutions, scholars, educators, and the public. The game was developed by [[Tiltfactor Lab]].

===''Train Robots''===
''Train Robots'' is an annotation game similar to Phrase Detectives. Players are shown pairs of before/after images of a robot arm and blocks on a board, and asked to enter commands to instruct the robot to move from the first configuration to the second. The game collects natural language data for training linguistic and robotic processing systems.&lt;ref name="TrainRobots"/&gt;

===Wikidata Game===
The Wikidata Game represents a gamification approach to let users help resolve questions regarding persons, images etc. and thus automatically edit the corresponding data items in Wikidata, the structured knowledge repository supporting Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons, the other Wikimedia projects, and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://magnusmanske.de/wordpress/?p=203|title=The Game Is On|author=Magnus Manske|date=20 May 2014|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ultimategerardm.blogspot.no/2014/05/wikidata-game.html|title=#Wikidata - the game|author=Gerard Meijssen|date=26 May 2014|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ZombiLingo===
ZombiLingo is a French game where players are asked to find the right head (a word or expression) to gain brains and become a more and more degraded zombie. While playing, they in fact annotate syntactic relations in French corpora.&lt;ref name="Zombilingo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.inria.fr/centre/nancy/actualites/zombilingo-le-jeu-de-zombie-qui-aide-la-recherche-en-informatique&lt;/ref&gt; It was designed and developed by researchers from [[LORIA]] and [[Université Paris-Sorbonne]].&lt;ref&gt;https://hal.inria.fr/hal-00969157/file/4-Fort.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Dellinger III]], [[John Yoo]], [[Michael W. McConnell]], [[Linda Greenhouse]], [[Dahlia Lithwick]], [[Stuart Taylor Jr.]], [[Ted Cruz]] and William &amp; Mary's own [[William Van Alstyne]]. A September 15 panel on the [[Roberts Court]] (with Chemerinsky, Yoo and Greenhouse) was aired on [[C-SPAN]].

The 21st annual Supreme Court Preview was held September 26–27, 2008, again at William &amp; Mary's Law School. Panelists included appellate judges from the Sixth, Seventh, Ninth and Tenth Circuits; journalists from [[CNN]], ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[USA Today]]'' and ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]''; and Supreme Court advocates and U.S. legal scholars.

The 22nd annual Supreme Court Preview was held October 2–3, 2009, at [[The College of William &amp; Mary Law School|William &amp; Mary School of Law]]. [[Sandra Day O'Connor]], Justice of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] (retired) and Chancellor of [[The College of William &amp; Mary]], was the distinguished guest. Panelists included [[Beth Brinkman]] (Deputy Assistant Attorney General), [[Erwin Chemerinsky]] (Dean, [[University of California, Irvine School of Law]]), two former Solicitors General of the United States, and journalists and law professors from all over the nation. 

The 23rd annual Supreme Court Preview was held September 24–25, 2010. In addition to reviewing the Supreme Court's forthcoming docket, panels were held on [[Perry v. Schwarzenegger]], the same-sex marriage case then on appeal before the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals and on the constitutionality of the recently passed [[health insurance mandate]]. Panelists included four former Solicitors General, [[Jeffrey Sutton]] ([[United States Court of Appeal|U.S. Court of Appeals]] for the Sixth Circuit), law professors from [[Yale Law School]] and [[Stanford Law School]], and Supreme Court correspondents for five national publications.

The 25th annual Supreme Court Preview was held September 28–29, 2012. The moot court case was Fisher v. The University of Texas at Austin, argued by Erwin Chemerinsky (University of California at Irvine) and Amy Wax (University of Pennsylvania Law School). Other panel topics included Gay Rights, Business Law, and Election Law. Participants included [[Debo P. Adegbile]] (NAACP), Joan Biskupic (Reuters), Michael Carvin (Jones Day), Walter Dellinger (O'Melveny &amp; Myers), Linda Greenhouse (Yale Law School), Neal Katyal (Hogan Lovells), and Adam Liptak (New York Times).

}}'''Jeffrey Kipnis''' (born 1951, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]) is an [[United States|American]] architectural critic, theorist, designer, film-maker, [[curator]], and educator.

==Education, honors, and career==
Not a registered architect, Kipnis first came to prominence through his association with avant-garde architect [[Peter Eisenman]], and their joint collaboration with French philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]]. Kipnis holds a master's degree in physics from [[Georgia State University]], USA (1981), and in 2006, he was awarded an honorary diploma by the [[Architectural Association]] School of Architecture, [[London]], in recognition of his contributions to the discipline of architecture as a teacher, critic, and theorist. Other honors include the AIA (Georgia Chapter) Bronze Medal for Service to Architecture (1985), a Professional Development Award from the Architectural Society of Ohio Foundation (1992), and an [[Ohio State University]] Distinguished Research Award (2005). He is professor of architecture at the [[Ohio State University]], [[Columbus, Ohio]], USA. He has been a visiting professor at [[Princeton University]], [[New Jersey]], [[Columbia University]], [[New York City|New York]], and the [[Southern California Institute of Architecture]], [[Los Angeles]], the [[Harvard University]] Graduate School of Design, Cambridge, and is currently a Distinguished Visiting Professor at the [[University of Applied Arts Vienna]] (Angewandte Kunst). Kipnis taught at the [[Architectural Association]] from 1992–1995, where he was the founding director of the Graduate Design Program. He also curates Architecture and Design at the [[Wexner Center for the Arts]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]].

As a critic he has written for many different periodicals, including ''[[Assemblage (journal)|Assemblage]]'', ''[[El Croquis]]'', ''[[Architectural Design]]'', ''[[Harvard Design Magazine]]'', ''[[Log (journal)|Log]]'', and ''[[Quaderns]]''.

===Designer===
As a designer, Kipnis collaborated with architects [[Reiser + Umemoto]] (RUR Architects) on the Water Garden in Columbus, Ohio (which won a 1998 PA Design Award) and the Kansai-kan National Diet Library. During the 1990s he collaborated with the Iranian architect [[Bahram Shirdel]] on the design of influential projects such as the Scottish National Museum, Montreal Urban Design 1990-2000, and [[Place Jacques Cartier]].

'''Lawrence University''' is a liberal arts college and conservatory of music in [[Appleton, Wisconsin]], United States. Founded in 1847, the school held its first classes on November 12, 1849. Lawrence was the second college in the United States to be founded as a [[coeducational]] institution. 

In a study by the [[National Science Foundation]], Lawrence ranked 28th nationally in the percentage of graduates who go on to earn doctorates in science and engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/infbrief/nsf13323/|title=National Science Foundation, Baccalaureate Origins of U.S.-trained S&amp;E Doctorate Recipients}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence is consistently ranked in the top tier of national liberal arts colleges by ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]''. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/lawrence-university-3856| title =Lawrence University; US News |publisher=Colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com |date= |accessdate=2018-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Campus ==
The {{convert|84|acre|ha|0|adj=on}} campus is located in downtown Appleton, divided into two parts by the [[Fox River (Wisconsin)|Fox River]]. The academic campus is on the north shore of the river, and the major athletic facilities (including the 5000-seat Banta Bowl) are on the southeast shore. Lawrence also has a {{convert|425|acre|ha|sing=on}} northern estate called [[Björklunden]] (full name: Björklunden vid sjön), which serves as a site for retreats, seminars, concerts, and theatrical performances.  It contains a chapel for weddings.  Donald and Winifred Boynton of [[Highland Park, Illinois|Highland Park]], [[Illinois]], donated the property in [[Door County, Wisconsin|Door County]] to Lawrence in 1963.

===Campus development===
In the mid-1980s, the Physics Department built a $330,000 small laser laboratory (known as the "laser palace"), which includes 800 5&amp;nbsp;mW small lasers and more than 500 mirrors.

In 2009, Lawrence opened the Richard and Margot Warch Campus Center, a gathering place for students, faculty, staff, alumni, and guests from the Fox Cities community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawrence.edu/s/warch_campus_center/about |title=About the Campus Center |accessdate=2013-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 107,000 square foot building is situated on the Fox River on the site of the former Hulburt House. The Warch Campus Center includes a cinema, campus dining services, campus mailboxes, and various meeting and event spaces. The building has earned a [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] Gold certification for meeting sustainability goals in energy conservation, environmental friendliness, and green building.

The college has a long history of razing buildings on its campus, because of the limited land available for constructing new buildings. Many buildings on campus are built on the site of former buildings. Some razed buildings include:
* Peabody Hall of Music (20th century)
* Hamar Union (1960)
* Underwood Observatory (1962)
* Alexander Gym I (1962)
* Carnegie Library (1964)
* Worcester Art Center (1987)
* Stephenson Hall of Science (1998)
* Hulbert House (2006) (new construction: Warch Campus Center, 2009)

==History==
Lawrence's first president, William Harkness Sampson, founded the school with [[Henry R. Colman]], using $10,000 provided by [[philanthropist]] [[Amos Adams Lawrence]], and matched by the [[Methodist]] church. Both founders were ordained Methodist [[minister of religion|ministers]], but Lawrence was [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalian]]. The school was originally named '''Lawrence Institute of Wisconsin''' in its 1847 charter from the Wisconsin Territorial Legislature, but the name was changed to Lawrence University before classes began in November 1849.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawrence.edu/library/archives/history.shtml |title=Lawrence History &amp;#124; Lawrence University |publisher=Lawrence.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also  Charles Breunig’s book, A Great and Good Work: A History of Lawrence University, 1847-1964.&lt;/ref&gt;  Its oldest extant building, [[Main Hall (Lawrence University)|Main Hall]], was built in 1853.&lt;ref name=hcap&gt;Council of Independent Colleges, "[http://hcap.artstor.org/cgi-bin/library?a=d&amp;d=p976 Main Hall]", Historic Campus Architecture Project.&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence University was the second coeducational institution in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lawrence.edu/admissions/about/president |title=President Mark Burstein |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=Lawrence University |publisher=Lawrence University |access-date=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawrence's first period of major growth came during the tenure of [[alumnus]] [[Samuel G. Plantz]] as president. From 1894 to 1924, when Plantz presided over the school, its student body grew from 200 to 800.

From 1913 until 1964, the school was named '''Lawrence College''', to emphasize its small size and [[liberal arts]] education focus. The name was changed to Lawrence University when it merged with [[Milwaukee-Downer College]]. The state of Wisconsin then purchased the Milwaukee-Downer property and buildings to expand the campus of the [[University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee]]. Initially, the university designated two entities: Lawrence College for Men and Downer College for Women. This separation has not lasted in any material form, though degrees are still conferred "on the recommendation of the Faculty of Lawrence and Downer Colleges" and the university by-laws still make the distinction.

During [[World War II]], Lawrence College was one of 131 colleges and universities in the nation that took part in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]], which offered students a path to a Navy commission.&lt;ref name="lawrence-v-12"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.myhistorymuseum.org/WWII/1943/lawrence.htm |title=Call to Duty, Lawrence University's V-12 Program |publisher=Outagamie County Historical Society (OCHS) |last= |first= |accessdate=September 27, 2011 |year=2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208022740/http://www.myhistorymuseum.org/WWII/1943/lawrence.htm |archivedate=February 8, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lawrence Conservatory of Music, usually referred to as "the Con", was founded in 1874.  Lawrence offers two degrees: a [[Bachelor of Arts]] and a [[Bachelor of Music]]. It also offers a five-year dual degree program, where students can receive both B.A. and B.Mus. degrees. 

Freshman Studies at Lawrence is a mandatory two-term class, in which all students study the same selected 11 classic works of literature, art, and music. President [[Nathan M. Pusey]] is credited with initiating the program in 1945, although Professor Waples chaired the Freshman Studies Committee and was responsible for implementing the program. The program continues to this day, despite being temporarily suspended in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freshman Studies History|url=http://www.lawrence.edu/academics/study/freshman_studies/history|website=Lawrence University|publisher=Lawrence University|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 Lawrence University initiated a capital campaign called "More Light!", which aimed at raising $150 million. By October 2011 the college had raised $160,272,839, with the conclusion event held on October 28, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.lawrence.edu/mlfinale/2011/10/photos-from-the-more-light-finale-celebration.html |title=Photos From the More Light! Finale Celebration « More Light Finale |publisher=Blogs.lawrence.edu |date=2011-10-29 |accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawrence University is part of the [[Oberlin Group]], a consortium of liberal arts college libraries.

===Milwaukee-Downer traditions===
[[File:Lawrence University.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The cupola on [[Main Hall (Lawrence University)|Main Hall]] at Lawrence University is an Appleton landmark.]]
The [[traditions]] and heritage of Milwaukee-Downer are woven into the Appleton campus, from the grove of [[Crataegus|hawthorn]] trees (called Hawthornden) between Brokaw and Colman halls, to the [[sundial]] on the back of [[Main Hall (Lawrence University)|Main Hall]], to the bestowing upon each class a class color and banner.

The Lawrence Dean of Women was referred to as the "Dean of Downer", but when the offices of Dean of Men and Dean of Women were merged to form the Dean of Students, the substantive duties of the "Dean of Downer" came to an end; the title is still borne by a senior female professor, but her only duty is to carry the Downer Mace in academic processions. For many years the women's choir was called the Downer Chorus.  At one time the BA was conferred upon women in the name of "Downer College of Lawrence University" and upon men in the name of "Lawrence College of Lawrence University"; now all B.A. degrees are conferred in the name of "Lawrence &amp; Downer Colleges of Lawrence University." (The B.Mus. degree is from "the Lawrence University Conservatory of Music.)

==Academics==
[[File:muddlib.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Seeley G. Mudd Library. The library contains over 420,000 volumes.]]
Lawrence University operates on a [[Academic term|trimester]] calendar. The academic year runs from mid-September to mid-June. The student/faculty ratio at Lawrence is 9:1.&lt;ref name="lawrence1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lawrence.edu/admissions/about/international/ |title=International Resources - Lawrence University |publisher=Lawrence.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-05-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511013306/http://lawrence.edu/admissions/about/international/ |archive-date=2012-05-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence grants Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Music degrees, with a [[double degree]] possible. Lawrence offers a number of cooperative degree programs in areas such as [[engineering]], [[health sciences]] and [[environmental studies]].

The college offers majors in most of the [[liberal arts]]. The school also offers the option of [[interdisciplinary]] areas of study and allows students to design their own majors.  All students are required to take Freshman Studies, which introduces students to broad areas of study and provides a common academic experience for the college. Lawrence's freshman studies program focuses on a mixture of Great Books and more contemporary, influential works. The 2013–2014 list included Plato's ''Republic'' and Alison Bechdel's ''Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic''.

The school has an independent study option that allows students to design their own courses. This allows students to explore academic interests not covered by Lawrence’s classes or to explore topics more deeply. Over 90% of the students take advantage of the independent study program.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Conservatory of Music===
The [[Lawrence University Conservatory of Music]] was founded in 1874 and has been a part of Lawrence University ever since. The Conservatory offers Bachelor of Music degrees in Performance, Theory/Composition, Music Education, and a five-year double degree option that grants both a BM degree from the Conservatory and a BA degree from the College.  Approximately 25% of the Lawrence student body, or 350 students, is in the Conservatory. The Conservatory has three choirs, two bands, two jazz ensembles, a symphony orchestra, an improvisation collective, five world music ensembles, and numerous chamber music groups.

==Student body==
[[File:Hietthall.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Hiett Hall, a dormitory]]
Lawrence enrolls about 1,500 students who hail from nearly every U.S. state. The total enrollment in academic year 2010-2011 was 1,566 students,&lt;ref name=2010profile&gt;As of Fall 2010. {{cite web | title = 2010 Profile | publisher = Lawrence University | url = http://lawrence.edu/about/lu_factsheet.pdf | format = PDF | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120511014100/http://lawrence.edu/about/lu_factsheet.pdf | archivedate = May 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the largest student body in Lawrence University's history. Over 75% of the students identify as white.&lt;ref name=2010profile/&gt;  About 12% are [[international student]]s.&lt;ref name="lawrence1"/&gt; About 25% of students study in the conservatory of music.  In the fall of 2014, a quarter of the incoming class were domestic students of color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hail to the Class of 2018: Lawrence Welcomes More than 400 New Students|url=https://blogs.lawrence.edu/news/2014/09/hail-to-the-class-of-2018-lawrence-welcomes-more-than-400-new-students.html|date=2014-09-09|accessdate=2014-12-02|work= Lawrence University News Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Student traditions==
At the beginning of every academic year in September, incoming freshmen arrive a week before returning students to partake in Welcome Week. During Welcome Week, various activities are planned in order to help the incoming class get to know one another and to help them acclimate to college life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome Week 2016 Schedule|url=https://www.lawrence.edu/mw/DS16-111%20WW%20Schedule-Domestic%20Students_1.pdf|website=Lawrence University|publisher=Lawrence University|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the first night of Welcome Week, students and their parents attend the President's Welcome, which concludes with the traditional matriculation handshake, where every member of the incoming class shakes hands and exchanges words with the university's president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome Week 2016 Schedule|url=https://www.lawrence.edu/mw/DS16-111%20WW%20Schedule-Domestic%20Students_1.pdf|website=Lawrence University|publisher=Lawrence University|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the fall term, the on-campus fraternity [[Beta Theta Pi]] hosts the annual Beach Bash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lawrentian.com/archives/104359 |last1=Denault|first1=Ethan|title=Y’all gonna make me act a fool|website=The Lawrentian|publisher=The Lawrentian |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324213703/http://www.lawrentian.com/archives/104359 |archivedate=24 March 2016 |accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this event, the brothers of Beta Theta Pi shovel approximately 14 tons of sand into the fraternity house basement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Birch|first1=Hannah|title=Senator Tim Kaine campaigns on campus, pushes early voting|url=http://www.lawrentian.com/archives/1009298|website=The Lawrentian|publisher=The Lawrentian|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and install a boardwalk and a lifeguard station that doubles as a DJ booth.

During Spring Term, Lawrence University hosts a music festival, LU-aroo (a play on words on the popular music festival [[Bonnaroo]]). Held on the quad, the festival features many talented student bands, both from the college and the conservatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Senye|first1=Yame|title=LUAROO|url=http://blogs.lawrence.edu/admissions-studentstories/2014/05/luaroo.html|website=Lawrence University Student Stories|publisher=Lawrence University|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the musician [[The Tallest Man on Earth]] played at the festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nyman|first1=Shane|title=LU to host Tallest Man on Earth|url=http://www.postcrescent.com/story/entertainment/music/2016/04/05/lu-host-tallest-man-earth/82656062/|website=The Post-Crescent|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the university's Spring Term, many seniors participate in the Senior Streak, which typically happens during the eighth week of the term.&lt;ref name="The Lawrentian"&gt;{{cite web|title=Staff Editorial: Senior streak re-revisited|url=http://www.lawrentian.com/archives/108681|website=The Lawrentian|publisher=The Lawrentian|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the senior streak is to provide seniors with one last opportunity to let loose before finals, graduation, and post-college life.&lt;ref name="The Lawrentian"/&gt; Although rumor says that the senior streak was created as a result of former president [[Richard Warch]]'s aversion to the activity, this has been proven to be false.&lt;ref name="The Lawrentian"/&gt; Students, often coming from Lawrence's on-campus bar, the Viking Room, strip their clothes and run around the area of Main Hall, as one last hurrah before finals and graduation.

==Media==
The student newspaper, ''[[The Lawrentian]]'', has been published for over a century. 

Lawrence University hosts the [[Great Midwest Trivia Contest]], webcast every January over the college radio station, [[WLFM]].

The '''''Linguistic Bibliography''''' / '''''Bibliographie Linguistique''''' is an annual publication which first appeared in 1949. The publication provides comprehensive bibliographical descriptions of publications in [[theoretical linguistics]], with about 20,000 items added per year. Since 2002, the database has also been available online, as Linguistic Bibliography Online, and contains data from 1993 onward.

==Overview==
The ''Linguistic Bibliography'' covers all disciplines of [[theoretical linguistics]], both general and [[language]] specific, from all geographical areas, with the emphasis on lesser-known [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] and [[non-Indo-European]] [[languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Linguistic Bibliography Online|url=https://www.jisc-collections.ac.uk/Catalogue/FullDescription/Index/944|publisher=JISC Collections}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both ''Linguistic Bibliography / Bibliographie Linguistique'' and ''Linguistic Bibliography Online'' are published by [[Brill Publishers|Brill]] Leiden, Netherlands, on the authority of the Permanent International Committee of Linguists and under the auspices of the [[International Council for Philosophy and Humanistic Studies]].&lt;ref name=brill&gt;{{cite web|title=Linguistic Bibliography|url=http://bibliographies.brillonline.com/browse/linguistic-bibliography|publisher=Brill}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 1993, the online edition contained all entries of the printed volumes, with new records added on a monthly basis. Annual volumes of the ''Linguistic Bibliography'' are still published in print.&lt;ref name=brill/&gt;

==Organization and features==
Linguistic Bibliography's Online [[database]] contains over 360,000 records and is cross-searchable. It is updated 10 times per year with around 20,000 new records added per year. The database contains over 114,000 person's names, 2,400 journals and 10,000 publishers with records classified according to language and subject descriptors. Titles are given in their original language, with English translations provided of titles in lesser-known languages. Only scientific publications are included, and applied linguistic publications are listed only if they have theoretical implications.&lt;ref name=brill/&gt;

The Bibliography is published on the authority of the Permanent International Committee of Linguistics (CIPL) and is in accordance with the rules of the [[International Standard Bibliographic Description]] (ISBD) and the [[International Federation of Library Associations]] (IFLA). Contributors include a network of international specialists, with some of these experts responsible for a specific field of linguistics, while others cover the production of their home country.&lt;ref name=brill/&gt;

The languages of the world are grouped under large categories, e.g. "Semitic". A separate section for [[Pidgin]] and [[Creole language]]s was added in 1952. Though linguists today study [[Sign language|sign languages]] as true languages, the category "Sign languages" was not added until the 1988 volume, when it appeared with 39 entries.

This is a list of all [[sovereign state]]s and [[dependent territory|dependencies]] by [[total fertility rate]] (TFR): the expected number of children born per woman in her child-bearing years.

== Methodology ==
The [[World Bank]] ranking list is based on the data for the year 2016 published online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN?year_high_desc=true|title=Fertility rate, total (births per woman) - Data|author=|date=|website=data.worldbank.org|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Bank is a [[United Nations]] [[international financial institution]], a component of the [[World Bank Group]], and a member of the [[United Nations Development Group]], but it also collects and analyses information on demography issues based on international and national sources: (1) United Nations Population Division. World Population Prospects, (2) United Nations Statistical Division. Population and Vital Statistics Report (various years), (3) Census reports and other statistical publications from national statistical offices, (4) Eurostat: Demographic Statistics, (5) Secretariat of the Pacific Community: Statistics and Demography Programme, and (6) U.S. Census Bureau: International Database.

The [[Population Reference Bureau]] (PRB) ranking list is based on the data of the ''2018 World Population Data Sheet&lt;ref&gt;https://www.prb.org/2018-world-population-data-sheet-with-focus-on-changing-age-structures/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.prb.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/2018_WPDS.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;'' published online.
The [[Population Reference Bureau]] (PRB)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Population Reference Bureau |url=http://www.prb.org/ |title=Population Reference Bureau |publisher=Prb.org |date= |accessdate=2018-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a private, nonprofit organization which informs people around the world about population, health and the environment for research or academic purposes. It was founded in 1929. World Population Data Sheets are double-sided wallcharts (now published online) that present detailed information on demographic, health and environment indicators for more than 200 countries.

The [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] ranking list is sourced from the CIA World Factbook&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/fields/356rank.html&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/fields/356.html&lt;/ref&gt; unless otherwise specified. [[List of sovereign states|Sovereign states]] and [[country|countries]] are ranked. Some countries might not be listed because they are not fully recognized as countries at the time of this census.

The [[Our World In Data]] (OWID) ''Country ranking and comparison by TFR: 1950 and 2015'' list is sourced and based on the OWID website (on the clickable map and quoted sources).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ourworldindata.org/fertility/|title=Fertility Rate|author=|date=|website=Our World in Data|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ourworldindata.org/|title=Our World in Data|author=|date=|website=Our World in Data|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Our World In Data]] (OWID) is an [[online publication]] that presents empirical research and data that show how living conditions around the world are changing. The aim is to show how the world is changing and why. The publication is developed at the [[University of Oxford]] and authored by social historian and development economist [[Max Roser]].

The World Bank ''Country ranking and comparison by TFR: 1960 and 2015'' list is sourced and based on the online published demographic data of the World Bank web site (on the clickable map and quoted sources).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN|title=Fertility rate, total (births per woman) - Data|author=|date=|website=data.worldbank.org|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Population Reference Bureau]] (PRB) ''Country ranking and comparison by TFR: 1970 and 2013'' list is sourced and based on the data of the ''2014 World Population Data Sheet''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Population Reference Bureau |url=http://www.prb.org/Publications/Datasheets/2014/2014-world-population-data-sheet.aspx |title=2014 World Population Data Sheet |publisher=Prb.org |date= |accessdate=2018-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; published online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prb.org/DataFinder/Topic/Rankings.aspx?ind=17&amp;fmt=17&amp;tf=70&amp;loc=249,250,251,252,253,254,34227,255,257,258,259,260,261,262,263,264,265,266,267,268,269,270,271,272,274,275,276,277,278,279,280,281,282,283,284,285,286,287,288,289,290,291,292,294,295,296,297,298,299,300,301,302,304,305,306,307,308,311,312,315,316,317,318,319,320,321,322,324,325,326,327,328,34234,329,330,331,332,333,334,336,337,338,339,340,342,343,344,345,346,347,348,349,350,351,352,353,354,358,359,360,361,362,363,364,365,366,367,368,369,370,371,372,373,374,375,377,378,379,380,381,382,383,384,385,386,387,388,389,390,392,393,394,395,396,397,398,399,400,401,402,404,405,406,407,408,409,410,411,415,416,417,418,419,420,421,422,423,424,425,427,428,429,430,431,432,433,434,435,437,438,439,440,441,442,443,444,445,446,448,449,450,451,452,453,454,455,456,457,458,459,460,461,462,464,465,466,467,468,469,470,471,472,473,474,475,476,477,478,479,480&amp;sort=Descending&amp;notes=True&amp;sortBy=value|title=Population Reference Bureau – Inform, Empower, Advance|author=|date=|website=prb.org|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prb.org/DataFinder/Topic/Rankings.aspx?ind=17&amp;fmt=17&amp;tf=54&amp;loc=249,250,251,252,253,254,34227,255,257,258,259,260,261,262,263,264,265,266,267,268,269,270,271,272,274,275,276,277,278,279,280,281,282,283,284,285,286,287,288,289,290,291,292,294,295,296,297,298,299,300,301,302,304,305,306,307,308,311,312,315,316,317,318,319,320,321,322,324,325,326,327,328,34234,329,330,331,332,333,334,336,337,338,339,340,342,343,344,345,346,347,348,349,350,351,352,353,354,358,359,360,361,362,363,364,365,366,367,368,369,370,371,372,373,374,375,377,378,379,380,381,382,383,384,385,386,387,388,389,390,392,393,394,395,396,397,398,399,400,401,402,404,405,406,407,408,409,410,411,415,416,417,418,419,420,421,422,423,424,425,427,428,429,430,431,432,433,434,435,437,438,439,440,441,442,443,444,445,446,448,449,450,451,452,453,454,455,456,457,458,459,460,461,462,464,465,466,467,468,469,470,471,472,473,474,475,476,477,478,479,480&amp;sort=Descending&amp;notes=True&amp;sortBy=value|title=Population Reference Bureau – Inform, Empower, Advance|author=|date=|website=prb.org|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2835">'''Lusser's law''' in [[systems engineering]] is a prediction of [[reliability (engineering)|reliability]]. Named after engineer [[Robert Lusser]],&lt;ref name="AmSpec"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://spectator.org/51313_lussers-law/ | title=Lusser's Law | work=The American Spectator | date=July 14, 2003 | accessdate=10 August 2015 | author=Collins, R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also known as ''Lusser's product law'' or the ''probability product law of series components'', it states that the reliability of a [[Series circuit|series of components]] is equal to the [[product (mathematics)|product]] of the individual reliabilities of the components, if their [[failure causes|failure modes]] are known to be [[statistically independent]]. For a series of ''N'' components, this is expressed as:&lt;ref name="DeVale"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/des_s99/traditional_reliability/presentation.pdf | title=Basics of Traditional Reliability | date=1998 | accessdate=11 August 2015 | author=DeVale, J. | pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kopp"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ausairpower.net/PDF-A/Reliability-PHA.pdf | title=System Reliability and Metrics of Reliability | publisher=Peter Harding &amp; Associates, Pty Ltd | date=1996 | accessdate=11 August 2015 | author=Kopp, C. | pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;R_s=\prod_{i=1}^N r_i=r_1 \times r_2 \times r_3 \times ... \times r_n&lt;/math&gt;

where ''R&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the overall reliability of the system, and ''r&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the reliability of the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; component.

If the failure probabilities of all components are equal, then as Lusser's colleague [[Erich Pieruschka]] observed, this can be expressed simply as:&lt;ref name="DeVale" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;R_s=r^N&lt;/math&gt;

Lusser's law has been described as the idea that a series system is  "weaker than its weakest link", as the product reliability of a series of components can be less than the lowest-value component.&lt;ref name="Critchley"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ltAqBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA117&amp;lpg=PA117&amp;dq=Lusser%27s+law&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SNPCKYZh-o&amp;sig=NUsUd9m3e45m87gG_bSxWjA7kps&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwB2oVChMI0ZO-5qOfxwIVh4kaCh3oaw9V#v=onepage&amp;q=Lusser's%20law&amp;f=false | title=High Availability IT Services | publisher=CRC Press | author=Critchley, Terry | year=2014 | pages=117 | isbn=9781482255911}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, given a series system of two components with different reliabilities — one of 0.95 and the other of 0.8 — Lusser's law will predict a reliability of

:&lt;math&gt;R_s = 0.95 \times 0.8 = 0.76&lt;/math&gt;

which is lower than either of the individual components.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3703">'''Marchetti's constant''' is the average time spent by a person for [[commuting]] each day, which is approximately one hour. The term is a misnomer, because [[Italian people|Italian]] [[physicist]] Cesare Marchetti himself attributes the "one hour" finding to transportation analyst and engineer Yacov Zahavi.&lt;ref name="mar94"&gt;[http://www.cesaremarchetti.org/archive/electronic/basic_instincts.pdf Marchetti, C., 1994: Anthropological Invariants in Travel Behavior, Technological Forecasting and Social Change , 47 :75–88, Internal Publication, International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, Laxenburg, Austria]&lt;/ref&gt;

Marchetti posits that although forms of [[urban planning]] and [[transport]] may change, and although some live in villages and others in cities, people gradually adjust their lives to their conditions (including location of their homes relative to their workplace) such that the average travel time stays approximately constant.&lt;ref name="mar94"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ausubel1998"&gt;[http://phe.rockefeller.edu/green_mobility/ Toward green mobility: the evolution of transport], Jesse H.

Includes observations on historical cities.&lt;/ref&gt; Ever since [[Neolithic]] times, people have kept the average time spent per day for travel the same, even though the distance may increase due to the advancements in the means of transportation.

A related concept is that of Zahavi, who also noticed that people seem to have a constant "travel time budget", that is, "a stable daily amount of time that people make available for travel."&lt;ref&gt;Metz, David, 2008: The Limits to Travel: How Far Will You Go?, 8, Earthscan, London&lt;/ref&gt; David Metz, former chief scientist at the Department of Transport, UK, cites data of average travel time in Britain drawn from the British National Travel Survey in support of Marchetti's and Zahavi's conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; The work casts doubt on the contention that investment in [[infrastructure]] saves travel time. Instead, it appears from Metz's figures that people invest travel time saved in travelling a longer distance,&lt;ref&gt;The point is also made in a 2009 paper by Yves Crozet: 'Economic Development and the Role of Travel time: The key concept of accessibility' published in Commissioned Papers for the 4th International Future Urban Transport Conference of the Volvo Research and Educational Foundations, Gothenburg, Sweden, April 19–21, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; a particular example of [[Jevons paradox]] described by the [[Lewis–Mogridge position]]. Because of the constancy of travel times as well as induced travel, [[Robert Cervero]] has argued that the World Bank and other international aid agencies evaluate transportation investment proposals in developing and rapidly motorizing cities less on the basis of potential travel-time savings and more on the accessibility benefits they confer.&lt;ref&gt;Cervero, Robert, 2011: Beyond Travel-Time Savings: An Expanded Framework for Evaluating Urban Transport Projects, The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development/The World Bank, Department for International Development, Transport Research Support Program.[http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/466801468178764085/pdf/702060ESW0P1200s0in0Urban0Transport.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10709">'''Matched molecular pair analysis''' ('''MMPA''') is a method in [[cheminformatics]] that compares the properties of two molecules that differ only by a single chemical transformation, such as the substitution of a hydrogen atom by a chlorine one. Such pairs of compounds are known as matched molecular pairs (MMP). Because the structural difference between the two molecules is small, any experimentally observed change in a physical or biological property between the matched molecular pair can more easily be interpreted. The term was first coined by Kenny and Sadowski in the book ''Chemoinformatics in Drug Discovery''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1=Peter W. | last1=Kenny | first2=Jens | last2=Sadowski | chapter=Chapter 11: Structure Modification in Chemical Databases | title=Chemoinformatics in Drug Discovery | editor1-first=Tudor I. | editor1-last=Oprea | publisher=Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA | year=2005 | pages=271–285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==

MMP can be defined as a pair of molecules that differ in only a minor single point change (See Fig 1). Matched molecular pairs (MMPs) are widely used in [[medicinal chemistry]] to study changes in compound properties which includes biological activity, toxicity, environmental hazards and much more, which are associated with well-defined structural modifications. Single point changes in the molecule pairs are termed a chemical transformation or Molecular transformation.  Each molecular pair is associated with a particular transformation. An example of transformation is the replacement of one functional group by another. More specifically, molecular transformation can be defined as the replacement of a molecular fragment having one, two or three attachment points with another fragment. Useful Molecular transformation in a specified context is termed as "Significant" transformations. For example, a transformation may systematically decrease or increase a desired property of chemical compounds. Transformations that affect a particular property/activity in a statistically significant sense are called as significant transformations. The transformation is considered significant, if it increases the property value "more often" than it decreases it or vice versa. Thus, the distribution of increasing and decreasing pairs should be significantly different from the binomial ("no effect") distribution with a particular p-value (usually 0.05).

==Significance of MMP based analysis==

MMP based analysis is an attractive method for computational analysis because they can be algorithmically generated and they make it possible to associate defined structural modifications at the level of compound pairs with chemical property changes, including biological activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Griffen | first1=Ed | last2=Leach | first2=Andrew G. | last3=Robb | first3=Graeme R. | last4=Warner | first4=Daniel J. | title=Matched molecular pairs as a medicinal chemistry tool | journal=[[J.

===Interpretable QSAR models===

MMPA is quite useful in the field of [[quantitative structure–activity relationship]] (QSAR) modelling studies. One of the issues of QSAR models is they are difficult to interpret in a chemically meaningful manner. While it can be pretty easy to interpret simple linear regression models, the most powerful [[algorithm]]s like [[neural network]]s, [[support vector machine]] are similar to "black boxes", which provide predictions that can't be easily interpreted.&lt;ref&gt;Cumming et.al., Chemical predictive modelling to improve compound quality,Nature Reviews Drug Discovery 12, 948–962 (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; This problem undermines the applicability of QSAR model in helping the medicinal chemist to make the decision. If the compound is predicted to be active against some microorganism, what are the driving factors of its activity? Or if it is predicted to be inactive, how its activity can be modulated? The black box nature of the QSAR model prevents it from addressing these crucial issues. The use of predicted MMPs allows to interpret models and identify which MMPs were learned by the model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sushko|first=Yurii|last2=Novotarskyi|first2=Sergii|last3=Körner|first3=Robert|last4=Vogt|first4=Joachim|last5=Abdelaziz|first5=Ahmed|last6=Tetko|first6=Igor V|date=2014-12-11|title=Prediction-driven matched molecular pairs to interpret QSARs and aid the molecular optimization process|url=http://www.jcheminf.com/content/6/1/48|journal=Journal of Cheminformatics|language=En|volume=6|issue=1|doi=10.1186/s13321-014-0048-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MMPs, which were not reproduced by the model, could correspond to experimental errors or deficiency of the model (inappropriate descriptors, too few data, etc.). 

Analysis of MMPs (matched molecular pair) can be very useful for understanding the mechanism of action. A medicinal chemist might be interested particularly in "activity cliff". Activity cliff is a minor structural modification, which changes the target activity significantly.

===Activity Cliff===

Activity cliffs are minor structural modifications, with significant effect on molecular property. Activity cliffs usually have high SAR information content. Because small chemical changes in the set of similar compounds lead to large changes in activity. The assessment of activity cliffs requires careful consideration of similarity and potency difference criteria&lt;ref&gt;Stumpfe D, Bajorath J: Exploring activity cliffs in medicinal chemistry. J Med Chem. 2012; 55(7): 2932–2942 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22236250]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stumpfe D, Hu Y, Dimova D, et al.: Recent progress in understanding activity cliffs and their utility in medicinal chemistry. J Med Chem. 2014; 57(1): 18–28.[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23981118]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hu Y, Stumpfe D, Bajorath J: Advancing the activity cliff concept [v1; ref status: indexed, http://f1000r.es/1wf]. F1000Res. 2013; 2: 199.[https://dx.doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.2-199.v1]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of MMP based analysis==

Matched molecular pair (MMPA) analyses can be classified into two types: supervised and unsupervised MMPA.

===Supervised MMPA===

In supervised MMPA, the chemical transformations are predefined, then the corresponding matched pair compounds are found within the data set and the change in end point computed for each transformation.

===Unsupervised MMPA===

Also known as automated MMPAs. A [[machine learning]] algorithm is used to finds all possible matched pairs in a data set according to a set of predefined rules. This results in much larger numbers of matched pairs and unique transformations, which are typically filtered during the process to identify those transformations that correspond to statistically significant changes in the targeted property with a reasonable number of matched pairs.

== Matched molecular series==

Here instead of looking at the pair of molecules which differ only at one point, a series of more than 2  molecules different at a single point is considered. The concept of matching molecular series was introduced by Wawer and Bajorath.&lt;ref name="Local Structural Changes, Global Data Views: Graphical Substructure−Activity Relationship Trailing"&gt;{{cite journal | first1=Mathias | last1=Wawer | first2=Jürgen | last2=Bajorath | title=Local Structural Changes, Global Data Views: Graphical Substructure−Activity Relationship Trailing | journal=[[J. Med. Chem.]] | volume=54 | issue=8 | pages=2944-2951 | year=2011 | pmid=21443196 | doi=10.1021/jm200026b | url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jm200026b}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that longer matched series is more likely to exhibit preferred molecular transformation while, matched pairs exhibit only a small preference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1=Noel M. | last1=O'Boyle | first2=Jonas | last2=Boström | first3=Roger A. | last3=Sayle | first4=Adrian | last4=Gill | title=Using Matched Molecular Series as a Predictive Tool To Optimize Biological Activity | journal=[[J. Med. Chem.]] | volume=57 | issue=6 | pages=2704-2713 | year=2014 | pmid=24601597 | pmc=3968889 | doi=10.1021/jm500022q | url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jm500022q}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations ==

The application of the MMPA across large chemical databases for the optimization of ligand potency is problematic because same structural transformation may increase or decrease or doesn't affect the potency of different compounds in the dataset. Selection of practical significant transformation from a dataset of molecules is a challenging issue in the MMPA. Moreover, the effect of a particular molecular transformation can significantly depend on the Chemical context of transformations.&lt;ref&gt;Warner, D. J., Bridgland-Taylor, M. H., Sefton, C. E. &amp; Wood, D. J. Prospective prediction of antitarget activity by matched molecular pairs analysis. Mol. Inform. 31, 365–368 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Hajduk | first1=P.J. | last2=Sauer | first2=D.R. | title=Statistical analysis of the effects of common chemical substituents on ligand potency | journal=[[J. Med. Chem.]] | volume=51 | issue=3 | page=553–564 | year=2008 | pmid=18173228 | doi=10.1021/jm070838y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beside these, MMPA might pose some limitations in terms of computational resources, especially when dealing with databases of compounds with a large number of breakable bonds. Further, more atoms in the variable part of the molecule also leads to combinatorial explosion problems. To deal with this, the number of breakable bonds and number of atoms in the variable part can be used to pre-filter the database.

'''Mineralized tissues''' are biological [[tissue (biology)|tissues]] that incorporate minerals into soft matrices. Typically these tissues form a protective shield or structural support.&lt;ref name="Espinosa2009" /&gt; Bone, [[mollusk shell|mollusc shells]], deep sea sponge ''Euplectella'' species, [[radiolarians]], [[diatoms]], [[antler]] bone, [[tendon]], [[cartilage]], [[tooth enamel]] and [[dentin]] are some examples of mineralized tissues.&lt;ref name="Espinosa2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name='Barthelat2007'&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Barthelat | first1 = F.| title = Biomimetics for next generation materials| journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

These tissues have been finely tuned to enhance their mechanical capabilities over millions of years of evolution. Thus, mineralized tissues have been the subject of many studies since there is a lot to learn from nature as seen from the growing field of [[biomimetics]].&lt;ref name="Barthelat2007" /&gt; The remarkable structural organization and engineering properties makes these tissues desirable candidates for duplication by artificial means.&lt;ref name='Espinosa2009'&gt;{{Cite journal| journal = Progress in Materials Science| title = Merger of structure and material in nacre and bone – Perspectives on de novo biomimetic materials| volume = 54| pages = 1059–1100| doi = 10.1016/j.pmatsci.2009.05.001| year = 2009| last1 = Espinosa | first4 = M.

E.| last3 = Barthelat | first3 = F.| issue = 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barthelat2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Glimcher1959" /&gt; Mineralized tissues inspire miniaturization, adaptability and multifunctionality. While natural materials are made up of a limited number of components, a larger variety of material chemistries can be used to simulate the same properties in engineering applications. However, the success of biomimetics lies in fully grasping the performance and mechanics of these biological hard tissues before swapping the natural components with artificial materials for engineering design.&lt;ref name="Barthelat2007" /&gt;

Mineralized tissues combine stiffness, low weight, strength and toughness due to the presence of minerals (the [[Inorganic compound|inorganic]] part) in soft protein networks and tissues (the [[Organic compound|organic]] part).&lt;ref name="Espinosa2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barthelat2007" /&gt; There are approximately 60 different minerals generated through biological processes, but the most common ones are [[calcium carbonate]] found in mollusk shells and [[hydroxyapatite]] present in teeth and bones.&lt;ref name="Barthelat2007" /&gt; Although one might think that the mineral content of these tissues can make them fragile, studies have shown that mineralized tissues are 1,000 to 10,000 times tougher than the minerals they contain.&lt;ref name="Barthelat2007" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://barthelat-lab.mcgill.ca/research.html The Biomimetic Materials Laboratory]''&lt;/ref&gt; The secret to this underlying strength is in the organized layering of the tissue. Due to this layering, loads and stresses are transferred throughout several length-scales, from macro to micro to nano, which results in the dissipation of energy within the arrangement. These scales or hierarchical structures are therefore able to distribute damage and resist cracking.&lt;ref name="Barthelat2007" /&gt; Two types of biological tissues have been the target of extensive investigation, namely [[nacre]] from mollusk shells and bone, which are both high performance natural composites.&lt;ref name="Barthelat2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name='FBarthelat2007'&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 47| pages = 311| year = 2007| doi = 10.1007/s11340-007-9040-1| last1 = Barthelat| journal = Experimental Mechanics | first1 = F.| title = An Experimental Investigation of Deformation and Fracture of Nacre–Mother of Pearl| last2 = Espinosa | first2 = H.

For example, kidney stones contain mineralized tissues that are developed through pathologic processes. Hence, [[biomineralization]] is an important process to understand how these diseases occur.&lt;ref name="Boskey2005" /&gt;

==Evolution==
The evolution of mineralized tissues has been puzzling for more than a century. It has been hypothesized that the first mechanism of mammalian tissue mineralization began either in the oral skeleton of [[conodont]] or the dermal skeleton of early [[agnathans]]. The dermal skeleton is just surface [[dentin]] and basal bone, which is sometimes overlaid by enameloid. It is thought that the dermal skeleton eventually became scales, which are homologous to teeth. Teeth were first seen in [[chondrichthyans]] and were made from all three components of the dermal skeleton, namely dentin, basal bone and enameloid. The mineralization mechanism of mammalian tissue was later elaborated in [[actinopterygians]] and [[sarcopterygians]] during bony fish evolution. It is expected that genetic analysis of [[agnathans]] will provide more insight into the evolution of mineralized tissues and clarify evidence from early fossil records.&lt;ref name='Kawasaki2004'&gt;{{Cite journal| pages = 11356–11361| issue = 31| year = 2004| pmid = 15272073| doi = 10.1073/pnas.0404279101| pmc = 509207| volume = 101| journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America| last2 = Suzuki | first1 = K. | first2 = T.| last3 = Weiss| title = Genetic basis for the evolution of vertebrate mineralized tissue | first3 = K.| last1 = Kawasaki|bibcode = 2004PNAS..10111356K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hierarchical structure==
Hierarchical structures are distinct features seen throughout different length scales.&lt;ref name="Espinosa2009" /&gt; To understand how the hierarchical structure of mineralized tissues contributes to their remarkable properties, those for nacre and bone are described below.&lt;ref name='FFBarthelat2007'&gt;{{Cite journal| journal = Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids| title = On the mechanics of mother-of-pearl: A key feature in the material hierarchical structure | first5 = H.| volume = 55| pages = 306| doi = 10.1016/j.jmps.2006.07.007| year = 2007| last1 = Barthelat| last5 = Espinosa| last2 = Tang | first1 = F. | first2 = H.| last3 = Zavattieri| last4 = Li | first3 = P. | first4 = C.| issue = 2|bibcode = 2007JMPSo..55..306B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hierarchical structures are characteristic of biology and are seen in all structural materials in biology such as bone &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=pradhan|first1=Shashindra | title=Structural Hierarchy Controls Deformation Behavior of Collagen| journal=Biomacromolecules|date=July 18, 2012|volume=13|issue=8|pages=2562–2569|doi=10.1021/bm300801a}}&lt;/ref&gt; and nacre from seashells&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Katti|first1=Kalpana|title=Why is Nacre so strong and tough?|journal=Materials Science and Engineering C|date=October 5, 2005|volume=26|issue=8|pages=1317–1324|doi=10.1016/j.msec.2005.08.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nacre===
Nacre has several hierarchical structural levels.&lt;ref name="FFBarthelat2007" /&gt;

====The macroscale====
[[Image:Brick and mortar.pdf|thumb|350px|Hierarchical structure: brick and mortar concept]]
Some mollusk shells protect themselves from predators by using a two layered system, one of which is nacre.&lt;ref name="Barthelat2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FFBarthelat2007" /&gt; Nacre constitutes the inner layer while the other, outer, layer is made from [[calcite]].&lt;ref name="Barthelat2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FFBarthelat2007" /&gt; The latter is hard and thus prevents any penetration through the shell, but is subject to brittle failure. On the other hand, nacre is softer and can uphold inelastic deformations, which makes it tougher than the hard outer shell.&lt;ref name="FFBarthelat2007" /&gt; The mineral found in nacre is [[aragonite]], CaCO3, and it occupies 95% vol. Nacre is 3000 times tougher than aragonite and this has to do with the other component in nacre, the one that takes up 5% vol., which is the softer organic biopolymers.&lt;ref name="Espinosa2009" /&gt;  Furthermore, the nacreous layer also contains some strands of weaker material called growth lines that can deflect cracks.&lt;ref name="Espinosa2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barthelat2007" /&gt;

====The microscale====
The Microscale can be imagined by a three-dimensional brick and mortar wall. The bricks would be 0.5 μm thick layers of microscopic aragonite polygonal tablets approximately 5-8 μm in diameter. What holds the bricks together are the mortars and in the case of nacre, it is the 20-30&amp;nbsp;nm organic material that plays this role.&lt;ref name="Espinosa2009" /&gt; Even though these tablets are usually illustrated as flat sheets, different microscopy techniques have shown that they are wavy in nature with amplitudes as large as half of the tablet's thickness.&lt;ref name="Espinosa2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barthelat2007" /&gt; This waviness plays an important role in the fracture of nacre as it will progressively lock the tablets when they are pulled apart and induce hardening.&lt;ref name="Barthelat2007" /&gt;

====The nanoscale====
The 30&amp;nbsp;nm thick interface between the tablets that connects them together and the [[aragonite]] grains detected by scanning electron microscopy from which the tablets themselves are made of together represent another structural level. The organic material “gluing” the tablets together is made of proteins and [[chitin]].&lt;ref name="Espinosa2009" /&gt;

To summarize, on the macroscale, the shell, its two layers ([[nacre]] and [[calcite]]), and weaker strands inside nacre represent three hierarchical structures. On the microscale, the stacked tablet layers and the wavy interface between them are two other hierarchical structures. Lastly, on the nanoscale, the connecting organic material between the tablets as well as the grains from which they are made of is the final sixth hierarchical structure in nacre.&lt;ref name="Barthelat2007" /&gt;

===Bone===
Like nacre and the other mineralized tissues, [[bone]] has a hierarchical structure that is also formed by the self-assembly of smaller components. The mineral in bone (known as [[bone mineral]]) is [[hydroxyapatite]] with a lot of carbonate ions, while the organic portion is made mostly of [[collagen]] and some other proteins. The hierarchical structural of bone spans across to a three tiered hierarchy of the collagen molecule itself.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  Different sources report different numbers of hierarchical level in bone, which is a complex biological material.&lt;ref name="Espinosa2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barthelat2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name='Hellmich2004'&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Hellmich | first1 = C.| last2 = Ulm | first2 = F. J.| title = Micromechanical Model for Ultrastructural Stiffness of Mineralized Tissues| journal = Journal of Engineering Mechanics| volume = 128| issue = 8| pages = 898| year = 2002| doi = 10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9399(2002)128:8(898)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The types of mechanisms that operate at different structural length scales are yet to be properly defined.&lt;ref name="Espinosa2009" /&gt; Five hierarchical structures of bone are presented below.&lt;ref name="Hellmich2004" /&gt;

====The macroscale====
Compact bone and spongy bone are on a scale of several millimetres to 1 or more centimetres.&lt;ref name="Hellmich2004" /&gt;

====The microscale====
There are two hierarchical structures on the microscale. The first, at a scale of 100 μm to 1&amp;nbsp;mm, is inside the compact bone where cylindrical units called [[osteons]] and small struts can be distinguished.&lt;ref name="Hellmich2004" /&gt; The second hierarchical structure, the ultrastructure, at a scale of 5 to 10 μm, is the actual structure of the osteons and small struts.&lt;ref name="Hellmich2004" /&gt;

====The nanoscale====
There are also two hierarchical structures on the nanoscale. The first being the structure inside the ultrastructure that are fibrils and extrafibrillar space, at a scale of several hundred nanometres. The second are the elementary components of mineralized tissues at a scale of tens of nanometres. The components are the mineral crystals of [[hydroxyapatite]], cylindrical [[collagen]] molecules, organic molecules such as lipids and proteins, and finally water.&lt;ref name="Hellmich2004" /&gt; The hierarchical structure common to all mineralized tissues is the key to their mechanical performance.&lt;ref name="Espinosa2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barthelat2007" /&gt;

==Mineral component==
The mineral is the inorganic component of mineralized tissues. This constituent is what makes the tissues harder and stiffer.&lt;ref name="Espinosa2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barthelat2007" /&gt; [[Hydroxyapatite]], [[calcium carbonate]], [[silica]], [[calcium oxalate]], [[whitlockite]], and monosodium urate are examples of minerals found in biological tissues.&lt;ref name="Barthelat2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Boskey2005" /&gt; In mollusc shells, these minerals are carried to the site of mineralization in vesicles within specialized cells. Although they are in an [[amorphous]] mineral phase while inside the [[vesicle (biology)|vesicles]], the mineral destabilizes as it passes out of the cell and crystallizes.&lt;ref name='Addadi2005'&gt;{{Cite journal| issue = 4| volume = 12| journal = Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)| pages = 980–987| year = 2006| doi = 10.1002/chem.200500980| pmid = 16315200| title = Mollusk shell formation: a source of new concepts for understanding biomineralization processes | first4 = S.| last2 = Joester | first1 = L. | first2 = D.| last3 = Nudelman| last4 = Weiner | first3 = F.| last1 = Addadi}}&lt;/ref&gt; In bone, studies have shown that [[calcium phosphate]] nucleates within the hole area of the collagen fibrils and then grows in these zones until it occupies the maximum space.&lt;ref name="Fratzl1991" /&gt;

==Organic component==
The organic part of mineralized tissues is made of proteins.&lt;ref name="Espinosa2009" /&gt; In bone for example, the organic layer is the protein collagen.&lt;ref name="Boskey2005" /&gt; The degree of mineral in mineralized tissues varies and the organic component occupies a smaller volume as tissue [[hardness]] increases.&lt;ref name="Espinosa2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name='Currey2003'&gt;{{Cite journal| pages = 517–522| issue = 1538| year = 2004| pmid = 15129962| doi = 10.1098/rspb.2003.2634| pmc = 1691617| volume = 271| journal = Proceedings: Biological Sciences| last2 = Brear | first1 = J. | first2 = K.| last3 = Zioupos| title = Notch sensitivity of mammalian mineralized tissues in impact | first3 = P.| last1 = Currey}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, without this organic portion, the biological material would be [[brittle]] and break easily.&lt;ref name="Espinosa2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barthelat2007" /&gt; Hence, the organic component of mineralized tissues increases their [[toughness]].&lt;ref name='Meyers2008'&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Meyers | first1 = M.| last2 = Lin | first2 = A.| last3 = Chen | first3 = P.| last4 = Muyco | first4 = J.| title = Mechanical strength of abalone nacre: role of the soft organic layer| journal = Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials| volume = 1| issue = 1| pages = 76–85| year = 2008| pmid = 19627773| doi = 10.1016/j.jmbbm.2007.03.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, many proteins are regulators in the mineralization process. They act in the [[nucleation]] or inhibition of hydroxyapatite formation. For example, the organic component in nacre is known to restrict the growth of aragonite. Some of the regulatory proteins in mineralized tissues are [[osteonectin]], [[osteopontin]], [[osteocalcin]], bone sialoprotein and [[dentin phosphoprotein|dentin phosphophoryn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biochemj.org/bj/317/0059/3170059.pdf |title=Nucleation and inhibition of hydroxyapatite formation by mineralized tissue proteins  |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In nacre, the organic component is porous, which allows the formation of mineral bridges responsible for the growth and order of the nacreous tablets.&lt;ref name="Meyers2008" /&gt;

==Formation of minerals==
Understanding the formation of biological tissues is inevitable in order to properly reconstruct them artificially. Even if questions remain in some aspects and the mechanism of mineralization of many mineralized tissues need yet to be determined, there are some ideas about those of mollusc shell, bone and sea urchin.&lt;ref name="Addadi2005" /&gt;

===Mollusk shell===
The main structural elements involved in the mollusk shell formation process are: a [[hydrophobic]] silk gel, aspartic acid rich protein, and a [[chitin]] support.
The silk gel is part of the protein portion and is mainly composed of [[glycine]] and [[alanine]]. It is not an ordered structure. The acidic proteins play a role in the configuration of the sheets. The [[chitin]] is highly ordered and is the framework of the matrix. The main elements of the overall are:&lt;ref name="Addadi2005" /&gt;
# The silk gel fills the matrix to be mineralized before the mineralization takes place.&lt;ref name="Addadi2005" /&gt;
# The highly ordered [[chitin]] determines the orientation of the crystals.&lt;ref name="Addadi2005" /&gt;
# The components of the matrix are spatially distinguishable.&lt;ref name="Addadi2005" /&gt;
# Amorphous [[calcium carbonate]] is the first form of the mineral.&lt;ref name="Addadi2005" /&gt;
# Once [[nucleation]] begins on the matrix, the calcium carbonate turns into crystals.&lt;ref name="Addadi2005" /&gt;
# While crystals grow, some of the acidic proteins get trapped within them.&lt;ref name="Addadi2005" /&gt;

===Bone===
In bone, mineralization starts from a [[heterogeneous]] solution having calcium and phosphate ions. The mineral nucleates, inside the hole area of the collagen fibrils, as thin layers of [[calcium phosphate]], which then grow to occupy the maximum space available there. The mechanisms of mineral deposition within the organic portion of the bone are still under investigation. Three possible suggestions are that nucleation is either due to the precipitation of calcium phosphate solution, caused by the removal of biological inhibitors or occurs because of the interaction of calcium-binding proteins.&lt;ref name="Fratzl1991" /&gt;

===Sea urchin embryo===
The [[sea urchin]] embryo has been used extensively in developmental biology studies. The larvae form a sophisticated [[endoskeleton]] that is made of two [[wikt:spicule|spicules]]. Each of the spicules is a single crystal of mineral [[calcite]]. The latter is a result of the transformation of amorphous CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to a more stable form. Therefore, there are two mineral phases in larval spicule formation.&lt;ref name='Beniash1997'&gt;{{Cite journal| journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences| title = Amorphous calcium carbonate transforms into calcite during sea urchin larval spicule growth| volume = 264| pages = 461| doi = 10.1098/rspb.1997.0066| year = 1997| last1 = Beniash | first4 = S.| last2 = Aizenberg | first1 = E.| last4 = Weiner | first2 = J.| last3 = Addadi | first3 = L.| issue = 1380| pmc = 1688267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organic-inorganic interface==
The mineral-protein interface with its underlying adhesion forces is involved in the toughening properties of mineralized tissues. The interaction in the organic-inorganic interface is important to understand these toughening properties.&lt;ref name='Mohanty2007'&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Mohanty | first1 = B.| last2 = Katti | first2 = K.| last3 = Katti | first3 = D.| title = Experimental investigation of nanomechanics of the mineral-protein interface in nacre| journal = Mechanics Research Communications| volume = 35| pages = 17| year = 2008| doi = 10.1016/j.mechrescom.2007.09.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the interface, a very large force (&gt;6-5&amp;nbsp;nN) is needed to pull the protein molecules away from the [[aragonite]] mineral in nacre, despite the fact that the molecular interactions are non-bonded.&lt;ref name="Mohanty2007" /&gt; Some studies perform a [[finite element method|finite element model]] analysis to investigate the behaviour of the interface.&lt;ref name="FBarthelat2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name='Tang2007'&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 55| journal = Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids| pages = 1410| year = 2007| doi = 10.1016/j.jmps.2006.12.009| last1 = Tang| title = An elasto-viscoplastic interface model for investigating the constitutive behavior of nacre | first1 = H.| last2 = Barthelat | first2 = F. | first3 = H.| last3 = Espinosa| issue = 7|bibcode = 2007JMPSo..55.1410T }}&lt;/ref&gt; A model has shown that during tension, the back stress that is induced during the [[Plastic deformation in solids|plastic]] stretch of the material plays a big role in the hardening of the mineralized tissue. As well, the nanoscale [[Asperity (material science)|asperities]] that is on the tablet surfaces provide resistance to interlamellar sliding and so strengthen the material. A surface [[topology]] study has shown that progressive tablet locking and hardening, which are needed for spreading large [[deformation (engineering)|deformations]] over large volumes, occurred because of the waviness of the tablets.&lt;ref name="Tang2007" /&gt;

==Diseased mineralized tissues==
In [[vertebrates]], mineralized tissues not only develop through normal physiological processes, but can also be involved in [[pathology|pathological]]  processes. Some diseased areas that include the appearance of mineralized tissues include [[atherosclerotic]] plaques,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miller | first1 = J. D. | year = 2013 | title = Cardiovascular calcification: Orbicular origins | url = | journal = Nature Materials | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 476–478 | doi=10.1038/nmat3663 | pmid=23695741| bibcode = 2013NatMa..12..476M}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[tumoral calcinosis]], juvenile [[dermatomyositis]], [[kidney stone|kidney]] and [[sialolithiasis|salivary stones]]. All physiologic deposits contain the mineral [[hydroxyapatite]] or one analogous to it. Imaging techniques such as [[infrared spectroscopy]] are used to provide information on the type of mineral phase and changes in mineral and matrix composition involved in the disease.&lt;ref name="Boskey2005" /&gt; Also, clastic cells are cells that cause mineralized tissue [[Bone resorption|resorption]]. If there is an unbalance of clastic cell, this will disrupt resorptive activity and cause diseases. One of the studies involving mineralized tissues in dentistry is on the mineral phase of [[dentin]] in order to understand its alteration with aging. These alterations lead to “transparent” dentin, which is also called sclerotic. It was shown that a ‘‘dissolution and reprecipitation’’ mechanism reigns the formation of transparent dentin.&lt;ref name='APoreter2005'&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Porter | first1 = A.| last2 = Nalla | first2 = R.| last3 = Minor | first3 = A.| last4 = Jinschek | first4 = J.| last5 = Kisielowski | first5 = C.| last6 = Radmilovic | first6 = V.| last7 = Kinney | first7 = J.| last8 = Tomsia | first8 = A.| last9 = Ritchie | first9 = R.| title = A transmission electron microscopy study of mineralization in age-induced transparent dentin| journal = Biomaterials| volume = 26| issue = 36| pages = 7650–7660| year = 2005| pmid = 16005961| doi = 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.05.059}}&lt;/ref&gt; The causes and cures of these conditions can possibly be found from further studies on the role of the mineralized tissues involved. [[File:Cardiovascular calcification - Sergio Bertazzo.tif|thumbnail|right|Density-Dependent Colour Scanning Electron Micrograph SEM (DDC-SEM) of cardiovascular calcification, showing in orange calcium phosphate spherical particles (denser material) and, in green, the extracellular matrix (less dense material).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bertazzo | first1 = S. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2013 | title = Nano-analytical electron microscopy reveals fundamental insights into human cardiovascular tissue calcification | url = | journal = Nature Materials | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 576–583 | doi=10.1038/nmat3627 | pmid=23603848| bibcode = 2013NatMa..12..576B }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

==Bioinspired materials==
The attractive properties of mineralized tissues like nacre and bone have led to the creation of a large number of [[biomimetic]] materials. Although improvements can be made, there are several techniques used to mimic these tissues. Some of the current techniques are described here for nacre imitation.&lt;ref name="Espinosa2009" /&gt;

===Large scale “model materials”===
The large scale model of materials is based on the fact that crack deflection is an important [[Fracture toughening mechanisms|toughening mechanism]] of nacre. This deflection happens because of the weak interfaces between the [[aragonite]] tiles. Systems on the [[macroscopic]] scales are used to imitate these week interfaces with layered composite ceramic tablets that are held together by weak interface “glue”. Hence, these large scale models can overcome the brittleness of ceramics. Since other mechanisms like tablet locking and damage spreading also play a role in the toughness of nacre, other models assemblies inspired by the waviness of microstructure of nacre have also been devised on the large scale.&lt;ref name="Espinosa2009" /&gt;

===Ice templation===
Ice Templation is a new method that uses the physics of ice formation to develop a layered-hybrid material. In this system, ceramic particles in a concentrated suspension are frozen using carefully controlled freezing kinetics. As a result, a homogeneous, porous [[scaffold]] can be made, which is then filled with a second organic or inorganic phase to build dense layered composites.&lt;ref name="Espinosa2009" /&gt;

===Layer-by-layer deposition===
Layer-by-layer deposition is a technique that as suggested by its name consists of a layer-by-layer assembly to make multilayered composites like nacre. Some examples of efforts in this direction include alternating layers of hard and soft components of TiN/Pt with an [[ion beam]] system. The [[Composite material|composites]] made by this sequential deposition technique do not have a segmented layered microstructure. Thus, sequential adsorption has been proposed to overcome this limitation and consists of repeatedly adsorbing [[electrolytes]] and rinsing the tablets, which results in multilayers.&lt;ref name="Espinosa2009" /&gt;

===Thin film deposition: microfabricated structures===
Thin film deposition focuses on reproducing the cross-lamellar microstructure of conch instead of mimicking the layered structure of nacre using [[microelectromechanical systems|micro-electro mechanical systems (MEMS)]]. Among mollusk shells, the [[conch]] shell has the highest degree of structural organization.  The mineral [[aragonite]] and organic matrix are replaced by [[crystalline silicon|polysilicon]] and [[photoresist]]. The MEMS technology repeatedly deposits a thin silicon film. The interfaces are [[etching (microfabrication)|etched]] by reactive ion etching and then filled with [[photoresist]]. There are three films deposited consecutively.  Although the MEMS technology is expensive and more time consuming, there is a high degree of control over the morphology and large numbers of specimens can be made.&lt;ref name="Espinosa2009" /&gt;

===Self-assembly===
The method of self-assembly tries to reproduce not only the properties, but also the processing of [[bioceramics]]. In this process, raw materials readily available in nature are used to achieve stringent control of nucleation and growth. This [[nucleation]] occurs on a synthetic surface with some success. The technique occurs at low temperature and in an aqueous environment.  Self-assembling films form templates that effect the nucleation of ceramic phases. The downside with this technique is its inability to form a segmented layered microstructure. Segmentation is an important property of nacre used for crack deflection of the ceramic phase without fracturing it. As a consequence, this technique does not mimic microstructural characteristics of nacre beyond the layered organic/inorganic layered structure and requires further investigation.&lt;ref name="Espinosa2009" /&gt;

==The future==
The various studies have increased progress towards understanding mineralized tissues. However, it is still unclear which micro/nanostructural features are essential to the material performance of these tissues. Also constitutive laws along various loading paths of the materials are currently unavailable. For nacre, the role of some nanograins and mineral bridges requires further studies to be fully defined. Successful biomimicking of mollusk shells will depend will on gaining further knowledge of all these factors, especially the selection of influential materials in the performance of mineralized tissues. Also the final technique used for artificial reproduction must be both cost effective and scalable industrially.&lt;ref name="Espinosa2009" /&gt;

'''Mud-puddling''', or simply '''puddling''', is a behaviour most conspicuous in [[butterfly|butterflies]], but occurs in other animals as well, mainly insects; they seek out [[nutrients]] in certain moist substances such as rotting plant matter, [[mud]] and carrion and they suck up the fluid. Where the conditions are suitable, conspicuous insects such as butterflies commonly form aggregations on wet [[soil]], dung or [[carrion]].&lt;ref name="Sculley"&gt;{{aut|Sculley, C.E. &amp; Boggs, C.L.}} (1996): Mating systems and sexual division of foraging effort affect puddling behaviour by butterflies.

''Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society'' '''55'''(1): 73–74.

[[Lepidoptera]] (butterflies and moths) are diverse in their strategies to gather liquid nutrients. Typically, mud-puddling behaviour takes place on wet soil. But even sweat on human skin may be attractive to butterflies such as species of ''[[Halpe]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Collenette, C.L.}} (1934): On the sexes of some South American moths attracted to light, human perspiration and damp sand.

''Journal of Tropical Ecology'' '''22'''(1): 25–33. {{doi|10.1017/S0266467405002750}} (HTML abstract)&lt;/ref&gt; More unusual sources include [[blood]] and [[tears]]. Again, similar behaviour is not limited to the Lepidoptera, and for example, the various species of bees commonly called [[Halictidae|sweat bees]] are attracted to various kinds of sweat and tears, including that of humans, and other bee species have been recorded as doing so to various degrees.&lt;ref name="Hogue1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Leonard Hogue|title=Latin American Insects and Entomology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3CTf8bnlndwC&amp;pg=PA457|year=1993|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-07849-9|pages=457–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Morris2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Morris|title=Insects and Human Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ok-3NLX_8GQC&amp;pg=PA280|year=2004|publisher=Berg|isbn=978-1-84520-075-6|pages=280–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many [[species]] puddling behaviour is more commonly seen in males; for example, ''[[Speyeria mormonia]]'' males puddle with a much higher frequency than females.&lt;ref&gt;Sculley, Colleen E., and Carol L. Boggs. "Mating systems and sexual division of foraging effort affect puddling behaviour by butterflies." ''Ecological Entomology'' 21.2 (1996): 193-197.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, the presence of an assembly of butterflies on the ground acts on ''[[Battus philenor]]'' for example, as a stimulus to join the presumptive mud-puddling flock.&lt;ref name="Sculley"/&gt;

==On soil==
In tropical [[India]] this phenomenon is mostly seen in the post-[[monsoon]] season. The groups generally include several species, particularly members of the families [[Papilionidae]] and [[Pieridae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Sreekumar, P.G. &amp; Balakrishnan, M.}} (2001): Habitat and altitude preferences of butterflies in Aralam Wildlife Sanctuary, Kerala. ''Tropical Ecology'' '''42'''(2): 277-281. [http://www.tropecol.com/pdf/open/PDF_42_2/42213.pdf PDF fulltext]&lt;/ref&gt;

Males seem to benefit from the sodium uptake through mud-puddling behaviour with an increase in reproductive success.

When puddling, many butterflies and moths pump fluid through the digestive tract and release fluid from their anus. In some, such as the male [[Notodontidae|notodontid]] ''[[Gluphisia crenata]]'', this is released in forced anal jets at 3 second intervals. Fluid of up to 600 times the body mass may pass through and males have a much longer ileum (anterior hindgut) than non-puddling females.&lt;ref&gt;Scott R. Smedley in Resh, V. H. &amp; R. T.

In [[Borneo lowland rain forest]], numerous species of butterflies regularly visit decaying fruit to drink. This behavior is mainly [[Opportunism#Biological opportunism|opportunistic]], though some are highly attracted to old fruit, notably [[Satyrinae]] (e.g. ''Neorina lowii'') and [[Limenitidinae]] such as ''[[Bassarona dunya]]''.&lt;ref name="HamerEtAl"/&gt;

[[Carrion]] is usually more intentionally utilized. Carrion-feeders seem to represent a different [[feeding guild]] from "classical" mud-puddlers and fruit-feeders. They include diverse [[taxa]], e.g. [[brush-footed butterflies]] such as ''[[Cirrochroa]] emalea'' of the [[Nymphalinae]] or the [[tawny rajah]] (''Charaxes bernardus'') of the [[Charaxinae]], as well as [[gossamer-winged butterflies]] like ''[[Curetis]] tagalica'' of the [[Curetinae]] or the [[common imperial]] (''Cheritra freja'') of the [[Theclinae]].&lt;ref name="HamerEtAl"/&gt;

Carrion-feeding has [[evolution|evolved]] independently in several lineages. Specialist carrion-feeders may even have the ability to smell out and home in on rotting meat over hundreds of meters. In the Bornean [[Charaxinae]], specialist (''[[Charaxes bernardus]]'') or opportunistic (some other ''[[Charaxes]]'' and ''[[Polyura]]'') tend to have a markedly larger bulk and smaller wings, making them more dashing, maneuvrable flyers than fruit specialists like ''[[Prothoe franck]]'' and opportunistic fruit visitors such as ''[[Charaxes durnfordi]]''. Other butterflies like most [[Pieridae]], [[Papilionidae]] and [[Morphinae]] are rarely if ever seen on carrion, dung and rotting fruit, though they may be avid mud-puddlers in the strict sense. Altogether, the [[Nymphalidae]] show the highest variety of nutrient-gathering strategies among the butterflies; the [[Limenitidinae]] have numerous mud-puddlers that also frequently visit dung but avoid fruits and carrion (namely the genus ''[[Limenitis]]''),&lt;ref name="HamerEtAl"/&gt; and some which are attracted to any pungent substance.&lt;ref&gt;Several ''[[Apatura]]'' species are famous among [[lepidopterologist]]s for being easily attracted with stinking cheese.&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain [[moth]]s, mainly of the [[subfamily]] [[Calpinae]], are somewhat notorious for their blood- and tear-drinking habits. ''[[Hemiceratoides hieroglyphica]]'' of [[Madagascar]] has been noted to visit and suck tears by inserting their proboscis into the closed eyelids of roosting birds.&lt;ref&gt;* {{aut|Hilgartner, R.; Raoilison, Mamisolo; Büttiker, Willhelm; Lees, David C. &amp; Krenn, Harald W.}} (2007): Malagasy birds as hosts for eye-frequenting moths.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20886">'''Multiple trace theory''' is a [[memory consolidation]] model advanced as an alternative model to strength theory. It posits that each time some information is presented to a person, it is neurally encoded in a unique memory trace composed of a combination of its attributes.&lt;ref name=Semon&gt;{{cite book|last=Semon|first=RW|title=Mnemonic psychology|year=1923|publisher=George Allen &amp; Unwin|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further support for this theory came in the 1960s from empirical findings that people could remember specific attributes about an object without remembering the object itself.&lt;ref name=Underwood&gt;{{cite journal|last=Underwood|first=BJ|title=Some correlates of item repetition in free-recall learning|journal=Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior|year=1969|volume=8|pages=83–94|doi=10.1016/s0022-5371(69)80015-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The mode in which the information is presented and subsequently encoded can be flexibly incorporated into the model. This memory trace is unique from all others resembling it due to differences in some aspects of the item's attributes, and all memory traces incorporated since birth are combined into a multiple-trace representation in the brain.&lt;ref name=Hintzman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hintzman|first=DL|author2=Block RA|title=Repetition and memory: Evidence for a multiple trace hypothesis|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology|year=1971|volume=88|pages=297–306|doi=10.1037/h0030907}}&lt;/ref&gt; In memory research, a mathematical formulation of this theory can successfully explain empirical phenomena observed in [[Recognition memory|recognition]] and [[Recall (memory)|recall]] tasks.

==Attributes==
The attributes an item possesses form its trace and can fall into many categories. When an item is committed to memory, information from each of these attributional categories is encoded into the item's trace. There may be a kind of semantic categorization at play, whereby an individual trace is incorporated into overarching concepts of an object. For example, when a person sees a pigeon, a trace is added to the “pigeon” cluster of traces within his or her mind. This new “pigeon” trace, while distinguishable and divisible from other instances of pigeons that the person may have seen within his or her life, serves to support the more general and overarching concept of a pigeon.

===Physical===
Physical attributes of an item encode information about physical properties of a presented item. For a word, this could include color, font, spelling, and size, while for a picture, the equivalent aspects could be shapes and colors of objects. It has been shown experimentally that people who are unable to recall an individual word can sometimes recall the first or last letter or even rhyming words,&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=R|author2=Mcneil D|title=The "tip of the tongue" phenomenon|journal=Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior|year=1966|volume=5|pages=325–337|doi=10.1016/s0022-5371(66)80040-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; all aspects encoded in the physical orthography of a word's trace. Even when an item is not presented visually, when encoded, it may have some physical aspects based on a visual representation of the item.

===Contextual===
Contextual attributes are a broad class of attributes that define the internal and external features that are simultaneous with presentation of the item. Internal context is a sense of the internal network that a trace evokes.&lt;ref name=Bower&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bower|first=GH|title=A multicomponent theory of the memory trace|journal=The psychology of learning and motivation: Advances in research and theory|year=1967|volume=1|pages=229–325|doi=10.1016/s0079-7421(08)60515-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may range from aspects of an individual's mood to other semantic associations the presentation of the word evokes. On the other hand, external context encodes information about the spatial and temporal aspects as information is being presented. This may reflect time of day or weather, for example. Spatial attributes can refer both to physical environment and imagined environment. The [[method of loci]], a mnemonic strategy incorporating an imagined spatial position, assigns relative spatial positions to different items memorized and then "walking through" these assigned positions to remember the items.

===Modal===
Modality attributes possess information as to the method by which an item was presented. The most frequent types of modalities in an experimental setting are auditory and visual. It should be noted, however, that any sensory modality may be utilized practically.

===Classifying===
These attributes refer to the categorization of items presented. Items that fit into the same categories will have the same class attributes. For example, if the item “touchdown” were presented, it would evoke the overarching concept of “football” or perhaps, more generally, “sports”, and it would likely share class attributes with "endzone" and other elements that fit into the same concept. A single item may fit into different concepts at the time it is presented depending on other attributes of the item, like context. For example, the word "star" might fall into the class of astronomy after visiting a space museum or a class with words like "celebrity" or "famous" after seeing a movie.

==Mathematical formulation==
The mathematical formulation of traces allows for a model of memory as an ever-growing matrix that is continuously receiving and incorporating information in the form of a vectors of attributes. Multiple trace theory states that every item ever encoded, from birth to death, will exist in this matrix as multiple traces. This is done by giving every possible attribute some numerical value to classify it as it is encoded, so each encoded memory will have a unique set of numerical attributes.

===Matrix definition of traces===
By assigning numerical values to all possible attributes, it is convenient to construct a [[column vector]] representation of each encoded item. This vector representation can also be fed into computational models of the brain like [[neural networks]], which take as inputs vectorial "memories" and simulate their biological encoding through neurons.

Formally, one can denote an encoded memory by numerical assignments to all of its possible attributes. If two items are perceived to have the same color or experienced in the same context, the numbers denoting their color and contextual attributes, respectively, will be relatively close. Suppose we encode a total of ''L'' attributes anytime we see an object. Then, when a memory is encoded, it can be written as '''m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' with ''L'' total numerical entries in a column vector:

::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{m_1} = \begin{bmatrix} m_{1}(1) \\ m_{1}(2) \\ m_{1}(3) \\ \vdots \\m_{1}(L) \end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;.

A subset of the ''L'' attributes will be devoted to contextual attributes, a subset to physical attributes, and so on. One underlying assumption of multiple trace theory is that, when we construct multiple memories, we organize the attributes in the same order. Thus, we can similarly define vectors '''m&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''m&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''', ..., '''m&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''' to account for ''n'' total encoded memories. Multiple trace theory states that these memories come together in our brain to form a memory matrix from the simple concatenation of the individual memories:

::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{M} = \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{m_1} &amp; \mathbf{m_2} &amp; \mathbf{m_3} &amp; \cdots &amp; \mathbf{m_n} \end{bmatrix} 
= \begin{bmatrix} m_{1}(1) &amp; m_{2}(1) &amp; m_{3}(1) &amp; \cdots &amp; m_{n}(1) \\ m_{1}(2) &amp; m_{2}(2) &amp; m_{3}(2) &amp; \cdots &amp; m_{n}(2) \\ \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \\m_{1}(L) &amp; m_{2}(L) &amp; m_{3}(L) &amp; \cdots &amp; m_{n}(L)\end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;.

For ''L'' total attributes and ''n'' total memories, '''M''' will have ''L'' rows and ''n'' columns. Note that, although the ''n'' traces are combined into a large memory matrix, each trace is individually accessible as a column in this matrix.

In this formulation, the ''n'' different memories are made to be more or less independent of each other. However, items presented in some setting together will become tangentially associated by the similarity of their context vectors. If multiple items are made associated with each other and intentionally encoded in that manner, say an item '''a''' and an item '''b''', then the memory for these two can be constructed, with each having ''k'' attributes as follows:

::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{m_{ab}} = \begin{bmatrix} a(1) \\a(2) \\ \vdots \\a(k) \\b(1) \\b(2) \\ \vdots \\b(k) \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{a} \\ \mathbf{b} \end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;.

===Context as a stochastic vector===
When items are learned one after another, it is tempting to say that they are learned in the same temporal context. However, in reality, there are subtle variations in context. Hence, contextual attributes are often considered to be changing over time as modeled by a [[stochastic process]].&lt;ref name=Estes&gt;{{cite book|last=Estes|first=WK|title=Component and pattern models with markovian interpretations. studies in mathematical learning theory|year=1959|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considering a vector of only ''r'' total context attributes '''t&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' that represents the context of memory '''m&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''', the context of the next-encoded memory is given by '''t&lt;sub&gt;i+1&lt;/sub&gt;''':

::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{t_{i+1}(j)} = \mathbf{t_{i}(j) + \epsilon(j)}&lt;/math&gt;

so, 

::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{t_{i+1}} = \begin{bmatrix} t_i(1)+\epsilon(1) \\t_i(2)+\epsilon(2) \\ \vdots \\ t_i(r)+\epsilon(r) \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Here, '''ε(j)''' is a random number sampled from a [[Gaussian distribution]].

===Summed similarity===
As explained in the subsequent section, the hallmark of multiple trace theory is an ability to compare some probe item to the pre-existing matrix of encoded memories. This simulates the memory search process, whereby we can determine whether we have ever seen the probe before as in recognition tasks or whether the probe gives rise to another previously encoded memory as in cued recall.

First, the probe '''p''' is encoded as an attribute vector. Continuing with the preceding example of the memory matrix '''M''', the probe will have ''L'' entries:

::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} = \begin{bmatrix} p(1) \\ p(2) \\ \vdots \\p(L) \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;.

This '''p''' is then compared one by one to all pre-existing memories (trace) in '''M''' by determining the [[Euclidean distance]] between '''p''' and each '''m&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''':

::&lt;math&gt;\left \Vert \mathbf{p-m_i} \right \| = \sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^L (p(j)-m_i(j))^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

Due to the stochastic nature of context, it is almost never the case in multiple trace theory that a probe item exactly matches an encoded memory. Still, high similarity between '''p''' and '''m&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' is indicated by a small Euclidean distance. Hence, another operation must be performed on the distance that leads to very low similarity for great distance and very high similarity for small distance. A linear operation does not eliminate low-similarity items harshly enough. Intuitively, an exponential decay model seems most suitable:

::&lt;math&gt;similarity(\mathbf{p,m_i}) = e^{-\tau \left \Vert \mathbf{p-m_i} \right \|} &lt;/math&gt;

where '''τ''' is a decay parameter that can be experimentally assigned. We can go on to then define similarity to the entire memory matrix by a summed similarity '''SS(p,M)''' between the probe '''p''' and the memory matrix '''M''':

::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{SS(p,M)} = \sum_{i=1}^n e^{-\tau \left \Vert \mathbf{p-m_i} \right \|} = \sum_{i=1}^n e^{-\tau \sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^L (p(j)-m_i(j))^2}}&lt;/math&gt;.

If the probe item is very similar to even one of the encoded memories, '''SS''' receives a large boost. For example, given '''m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' as a probe item, we will get a near 0 distance (not exactly due to context) for i=1, which will add nearly the maximal boost possible to '''SS'''.  To differentiate from background similarity (there will always be some low similarity to context or a few attributes for example), '''SS''' is often compared to some arbitrary criterion. If it is higher than the criterion, then the probe is considered among those encoded. The criterion can be varied based on the nature of the task and the desire to prevent [[false alarms]]. Thus, multiple trace theory predicts that, given some cue, the brain can compare that cue to a criterion to answer questions like "has this cue been experienced before?" (recognition) or "what memory does this cue elicit?" (cued recall), which are applications of summed similarity described below.

==Applications to memory phenomena==

===Recognition===
Multiple trace theory fits well into the conceptual framework for [[recognition memory|recognition]]. Recognition requires an individual to determine whether or not they have seen an item before. For example, facial recognition is determining whether one has seen a face before. When asked this for a successfully encoded item (something that has indeed been seen before), recognition should occur with high probability. In the mathematical framework of this theory, we can model recognition of an individual probe item '''p''' by summed similarity with a criterion. We translate the test item into an attribute vector as done for the encoded memories and compared to every trace ever encountered. If summed similarity passes the criterion, we say we have seen the item before. Summed similarity is expected to be very low if the item has never been seen but relatively higher if it has due to the similarity of the probe's attributes to some memory of the memory matrix. 

::&lt;math&gt;P(recognizing~p)~=~P(\mathbf{SS(p,M)}&gt;criterion)&lt;/math&gt;

This can be applied both to individual item recognition and associative recognition for two or more items together.

===Cued recall===
The theory can also account for [[cued recall]]. Here, some cue is given that is meant to elicit an item out of memory. For example, a factual question like "Who was the first President of the United States?" is a cue to elicit the answer of "George Washington". In the '''"ab"''' framework described above, we can take all attributes present in a cue and list consider these the '''a''' item in an encoded association as we try to recall the '''b''' portion of the '''m&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt;''' memory. In this example, attributes like "first", "President", and "United States" will be combined to form the '''a''' vector, which will have already been formulated into the '''m&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt;''' memory whose '''b''' values encode "George Washington". Given '''a''', there are two popular models for how we can successfully recall '''b''':

1) We can go through and determine similarity (not summed similarity, see above for distinction) to every item in memory for the '''a''' attributes, then pick whichever memory has the highest similarity for the '''a'''. Whatever '''b'''-type attributes we are linked to gives what we recall. The '''m&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt;''' memory gives best chance of recall since its '''a''' elements will have high similarity to the cue '''a'''. Still, since recall does not always occur, we can say that the similarity must pass a criterion for recall to occur at all. This is similar to how the IBM machine [[Watson (computer)|Watson]] operates. Here, the similarity compares only the '''a'''-type attributes of '''a''' to m&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt;.

::&lt;math&gt;P(recalling~m_{ab})~=~P(similarity(a,m_{ab})&gt;criterion)&lt;/math&gt;

2) We can use a probabilistic choice rule to determine probability of recalling an item as proportional to its similarity. This is akin to throwing a dart at a dartboard with bigger areas represented by larger similarities to the cue item. Mathematically speaking, given the cue '''a''', the probability of recalling the desired memory '''m&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt;''' is:

::&lt;math&gt;P(recalling~m_{ab})~=~\frac{similarity(a,m_{ab})}{SS(a,M)+error}&lt;/math&gt;

In computing both similarity and summed similarity, we only consider relations among '''a'''-type attributes. We add the '''error''' term because without it, the probability of recalling any memory in '''M''' will be 1, but there are certainly times when recall does not occur at all.

===Other common results explained===
Phenomena in memory associated with repetition, word frequency, recency, forgetting, and contiguity, among others, can be easily explained in the realm of multiple trace theory. Memory is known to improve with repeated exposure to items. For example, hearing a word several times in a list will improve recognition and recall of that word later on. This is because repeated exposure simply adds the memory into the ever-growing memory matrix, so summed similarity for this memory will be larger and thus more likely to pass the criterion. 

In recognition, very common words are harder to recognize as part of a memorized list, when tested, than rare words. This is known as the word frequency effect and can be explained by multiple trace theory as well. For common words, summed similarity will be relatively high, whether the word was seen in the list or not, because it is likely that the word has been encountered and encoded in the memory matrix several times throughout life. Thus, the brain typically selects a higher criterion in determining whether common words are part of a list, making them harder to successfully select. However, rarer words are typically encountered less throughout life and so their presence in the memory matrix is limited. Hence, low overall summed similarity will lead to a more lax criterion. If the word was present in the list, high context similarity at time of test and other attribute similarity will lead to enough boost in summed similarity to excel past criterion and thus recognize the rare word successfully.

Recency in the [[serial position effect#Recency|serial position effect]] can be explained because more recent memories encoded will share a temporal context most similar to the present context, as the stochastic nature of time will not have had as pronounced an effect. Thus, context similarity will be high for recently encoded items, so overall similarity will be relatively higher for these items as well. The stochastic contextual drift is also thought to account for forgetting because the context in which a memory was encoded is lost over time, so summed similarity for an item only presented in that context will decrease over time.&lt;ref name=Robinson&gt;{{cite book|last=Robinson|first=ES|title=Association theory to-day; an essay in systematic psychology|year=1932|publisher=The Century Co.|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Karpicke&gt;{{cite journal|last=Karpicke|first=JD|author2=Roediger HL|title=Repeated retrieval during learning is the key to long-term retention|journal=Journal of Memory and Language|year=2007|volume=57|pages=151–162|doi=10.1016/j.jml.2006.09.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Finally, empirical data have shown a [[Contiguity (psychology)|contiguity effect]], whereby items that are presented together temporally, even though they may not be encoded as a single memory as in the '''"ab"''' paradigm described above, are more likely to be remembered together. This can be considered a result of low contextual drift between items remembered together, so the contextual similarity between two items presented together is high.

==Shortcomings==
One of the biggest shortcomings of multiple trace theory is the requirement of some item with which to compare the memory matrix when determining successful encoding. As mentioned above, this works quite well in recognition and cued recall, but there is a glaring inability to incorporate [[free recall]] into the model. Free recall requires an individual to freely remember some list of items. Although the very act of asking to recall may act as a cue that can then elicit cued recall techniques, it is unlikely that the cue is unique enough to reach a summed similarity criterion or to otherwise achieve a high probability of recall.  

Another major issue lies in translating the model to biological relevance. It is hard to imagine that the brain has unlimited capacity to keep track of such a large matrix of memories and continue expanding it with every item with which it has ever been presented. Furthermore, searching through this matrix is an exhaustive process that would not be relevant on biological time scales.&lt;ref name=Burrows&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burrows|first=D|author2=Okada R|title=Memory retrieval from short and long lists|journal=Science|year=1975|volume=188|pages=1031–1033| doi=10.1126/science.188.4192.1031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:P np np-complete np-hard.svg|thumb|300px|right|[[Euler diagram]] for [[P (complexity)|P]], [[NP (complexity)|NP]], NP-complete, and [[NP-hard]] set of problems.  The left side is valid under the assumption that [[P versus NP problem|P≠NP]], while the right side is valid under the assumption that P=NP (except that the empty language and its complement are never NP-complete)]]

In [[computational complexity theory]], an '''NP-complete''' [[decision problem]] is one belonging to both the  [[NP (complexity)|NP]] and the [[NP-hard]] complexity classes. In this context, '''NP''' stands for "[[Non-deterministic Turing machine#Deterministic Turing Machine|nondeterministic]] [[polynomial time]]". The set of NP-complete problems is often denoted by '''NP-C''' or '''NPC'''. 

Although a solution to an NP-complete problem can be verified "quickly," there is no known way to find a solution quickly. That is, the time required to solve the problem using any currently known [[algorithm]] increases rapidly as the size of the problem grows. As a consequence, determining whether it is possible to solve these problems quickly, called the [[P versus NP problem]], is one of the fundamental [[List of open problems in computer science|unsolved problems in computer science]] today.

While a method for computing the solutions to NP-complete problems quickly remains undiscovered, [[computer scientist]]s and [[computer programmer|programmer]]s still frequently encounter NP-complete problems. NP-complete problems are often addressed by using [[heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] methods and [[approximation algorithm]]s.

In this context "quickly" means in [[polynomial time]]. That is, "efficient" or "fast" algorithms can be developed to solve the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Cobham | first=Alan | authorlink=Alan Cobham | year = 1965 | chapter = The intrinsic computational difficulty of functions | title = Proc. Logic, Methodology, and Philosophy of Science II | publisher = North Holland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
NP-complete problems are in [[NP (complexity)|NP]], the set of all [[decision problem]]s whose solutions can be verified in polynomial time; ''NP'' may be equivalently defined as the set of decision problems that can be solved in polynomial time on a [[non-deterministic Turing machine]]. A problem ''p'' in NP is NP-complete if every other problem in NP can be transformed (or reduced) into ''p'' in polynomial time.

It is not known whether every problem in NP can be quickly solved—this is called the [[P versus NP problem]]. But if ''any NP-complete problem'' can be solved quickly, then ''every problem in NP'' can, because the definition of an NP-complete problem states that every problem in NP must be quickly reducible to every NP-complete problem (that is, it can be reduced in polynomial time). Because of this, it is often said that NP-complete problems are ''harder'' or ''more difficult'' than NP problems in general.

== Formal definition ==
{{See Also |P %3D NP problem#NP-completeness |l1 = formal definition for NP-completeness (article ''P = NP'')}}

A decision problem &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle C&lt;/math&gt; is NP-complete if:
# &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle C&lt;/math&gt; is in NP, and
# Every problem in NP is [[Many-one reduction|reducible]] to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle C&lt;/math&gt; in polynomial time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = J. van Leeuwen |year = 1998 |title = Handbook of Theoretical Computer Science |publisher = Elsevier |ISBN = 0-262-72014-0 |page = 84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle C&lt;/math&gt; can be shown to be in NP by demonstrating that a candidate solution to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle C&lt;/math&gt; can be verified in polynomial time.

Note that a problem satisfying condition 2 is said to be [[NP-hard]], whether or not it satisfies condition 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = J. van Leeuwen |year = 1998 |title = Handbook of Theoretical Computer Science |publisher = Elsevier |ISBN = 0-262-72014-0 |page = 80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A consequence of this definition is that if we had a polynomial time algorithm (on a [[Universal Turing machine|UTM]], or any other [[Turing completeness|Turing-equivalent]] [[abstract machine]]) for &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle C&lt;/math&gt;, we could solve all problems in NP in polynomial time.

== Background ==

The concept of NP-completeness was introduced in 1971 (see [[Cook–Levin theorem]]), though the term ''NP-complete'' was introduced later. At 1971 [[STOC]] conference, there was a fierce debate among the computer scientists about whether NP-complete problems could be solved in polynomial time on a [[deterministic]] [[Turing machine]]. [[John Hopcroft]] brought everyone at the conference to a consensus that the question of whether NP-complete problems are solvable in polynomial time should be put off to be solved at some later date, since nobody had any formal proofs for their claims one way or the other.  This is known as the question of whether P=NP.

Nobody has yet been able to determine conclusively whether NP-complete problems are in fact solvable in polynomial time, making this one of the great [[unsolved problems of mathematics]].  The [[Clay Mathematics Institute]] is offering a US $1 million reward to anyone who has a formal proof that P=NP or that P≠NP.

The [[Cook–Levin theorem]] states that the [[Boolean satisfiability problem]] is NP-complete (a simpler, but still highly technical [[Proof that Boolean satisfiability problem is NP-complete|proof of this]] is available). In 1972, [[Richard Karp]] proved that several other problems were also NP-complete (see [[Karp's 21 NP-complete problems]]); thus there is a class of NP-complete problems (besides the Boolean satisfiability problem). Since the original results, thousands of other problems have been shown to be NP-complete by reductions from other problems previously shown to be NP-complete; many of these problems are collected in [[Michael Garey|Garey]] and [[David S. Johnson|Johnson's]] 1979 book ''[[Computers and Intractability: A Guide to the Theory of NP-Completeness]]''.&lt;ref name="GareyJohnson"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Garey |first1=Michael&amp;nbsp;R. |authorlink1 = Michael R.

== NP-complete problems ==
[[File:Relative NPC chart.svg|thumb|right|Some NP-complete problems, indicating the [[reduction (complexity)|reductions]] typically used to prove their NP-completeness]]
{{Main|List of NP-complete problems}}

An interesting example is the [[graph isomorphism problem]], the [[graph theory]] problem of determining whether a [[graph isomorphism]] exists between two graphs.  Two graphs are [[isomorphic]] if one can be [[isomorphism|transformed]] into the other simply by renaming [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]]. Consider these two problems:
* Graph Isomorphism: Is graph G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; isomorphic to graph G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;?
* Subgraph Isomorphism: Is graph G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; isomorphic to a subgraph of graph G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;?

The Subgraph Isomorphism problem is NP-complete. The graph isomorphism problem is suspected to be neither in P nor NP-complete, though it is in NP. This is an example of a problem that is thought to be '''hard''', but is not thought to be NP-complete.

The easiest way to prove that some new problem is NP-complete is first to prove that it is in NP, and then to reduce some known NP-complete problem to it. Therefore, it is useful to know a variety of NP-complete problems. The list below contains some well-known problems that are NP-complete when expressed as decision problems.

To the right is a diagram of some of the problems and the [[reduction (complexity)|reductions]] typically used to prove their NP-completeness. In this diagram, an arrow from one problem to another indicates the direction of the reduction.  Note that this diagram is misleading as a description of the mathematical relationship between these problems, as there exists a [[polynomial-time reduction]] between any two NP-complete problems; but it indicates where demonstrating this polynomial-time reduction has been easiest.

There is often only a small difference between a problem in P and an NP-complete problem. For example, the [[3-satisfiability]] problem, a restriction of the boolean satisfiability problem, remains NP-complete, whereas the slightly more restricted [[2-satisfiability]] problem is in P (specifically, [[NL-complete]]), and the slightly more general max. 2-sat. problem is again NP-complete. Determining whether a graph can be colored with 2 colors is in P, but with 3 colors is NP-complete, even when restricted to [[planar graph]]s. Determining if a graph is a [[cycle graph|cycle]] or is [[bipartite graph|bipartite]] is very easy (in [[L (complexity)|L]]), but finding a maximum bipartite or a maximum cycle subgraph is NP-complete. A solution of the [[knapsack problem]] within any fixed percentage of the optimal solution can be computed in polynomial time, but finding the optimal solution is NP-complete.

== Solving NP-complete problems ==
At present, all known algorithms for NP-complete problems require time that is [[superpolynomial]] in the input size, and it is unknown whether there are any faster algorithms.

The following techniques can be applied to solve computational problems in general, and they often give rise to substantially faster algorithms:
* [[Approximation algorithm|Approximation]]: Instead of searching for an optimal solution, search for a solution that is at most a factor from an optimal one.
* [[Randomized algorithm|Randomization]]: Use randomness to get a faster average [[running time]], and allow the algorithm to fail with some small probability. Note: The [[Monte Carlo method]] is not an example of an efficient algorithm in this specific sense, although evolutionary approaches like [[Genetic algorithm]]s may be.
* Restriction: By restricting the structure of the input (e.g., to planar graphs), faster algorithms are usually possible.
* [[Parameterized complexity|Parameterization]]: Often there are fast algorithms if certain parameters of the input are fixed.
* [[Heuristic (computer science)|Heuristic]]: An algorithm that works "reasonably well" in many cases, but for which there is no proof that it is both always fast and always produces a good result.  [[Metaheuristic]] approaches are often used.

One example of a heuristic algorithm is a suboptimal &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle O(n\log n)&lt;/math&gt; [[greedy coloring|greedy coloring algorithm]] used for [[graph coloring problem|graph coloring]] during the [[register allocation]] phase of some compilers, a technique called [[graph-coloring global register allocation]]. Each vertex is a variable, edges are drawn between variables which are being used at the same time, and colors indicate the register assigned to each variable. Because most [[RISC]] machines have a fairly large number of general-purpose registers, even a heuristic approach is effective for this application.

== Completeness under different types of reduction ==
In the definition of NP-complete given above, the term ''reduction'' was used in the technical meaning of a polynomial-time [[many-one reduction]].

Another type of reduction is polynomial-time Turing reduction.  A problem &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle X&lt;/math&gt; is polynomial-time Turing-reducible to a problem &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Y&lt;/math&gt; if, given a subroutine that solves &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Y&lt;/math&gt; in polynomial time, one could write a program that calls this subroutine and solves &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle X&lt;/math&gt; in polynomial time.  This contrasts with many-one reducibility, which has the restriction that the program can only call the subroutine once, and the return value of the subroutine must be the return value of the program.

If one defines the analogue to NP-complete with Turing reductions instead of  many-one reductions, the resulting set of problems won't be smaller than NP-complete; it is an open question whether it will be any larger.

Another type of reduction that is also often used to define NP-completeness is the [[logarithmic-space many-one reduction]] which is a many-one reduction that can be computed with only a logarithmic amount of space. Since every computation that can be done in [[logarithmic space]] can also be done in polynomial time it follows that if there is a logarithmic-space many-one reduction then there is also a polynomial-time many-one reduction. This type of reduction is more refined than the more usual polynomial-time many-one reductions and it allows us to distinguish more classes such as [[P-complete]]. Whether under these types of reductions the definition of NP-complete changes is still an open problem. All currently known NP-complete problems are NP-complete under log space reductions. All currently known NP-complete problems remain NP-complete even under much weaker reductions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1006/jcss.1998.1583 | last1=Agrawal | first1=M. | author1-link=Manindra Agrawal | last2=Allender | first2=E. | last3=Rudich | first3=Steven | author3-link=Steven Rudich | title=Reductions in Circuit Complexity: An Isomorphism Theorem and a Gap Theorem | publisher=[[Academic Press]]  | year=1998 | journal=Journal of Computer and System Sciences | issn=1090-2724 | volume=57 | issue=2 | pages=127–143 | postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

== Naming ==
According to [[Donald Knuth]], the name "NP-complete" was popularized by [[Alfred Aho]], [[John Hopcroft]] and [[Jeffrey Ullman]] in their celebrated textbook "The Design and Analysis of Computer Algorithms".  He reports that they introduced the change in the [[galley proofs]] for the book (from "polynomially-complete"), in accordance with the results of a poll he had conducted of the [[theoretical computer science]] community.&lt;ref&gt;[[Don Knuth]], Tracy Larrabee, and Paul M. Roberts, ''[http://tex.loria.fr/typographie/mathwriting.pdf Mathematical Writing]'' § 25, ''MAA Notes No. 14'', MAA, 1989 (also [[Stanford University|Stanford]] Technical Report, 1987).&lt;/ref&gt; Other suggestions made in the poll&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The following misconceptions are frequent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2000/000113/full/news000113-10.html

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* ''"NP-complete problems are the most difficult known problems."'' Since NP-complete problems are in NP, their running time is at most exponential. However, some problems &lt;!-- the next word is PROVABLY (as in "to prove" something), not PROBABLY. Do not 'fix' it! --&gt;provably&lt;!-- proVVVVably --&gt; require more time, for example [[Presburger arithmetic]].
* ''"NP-complete problems are difficult because there are so many different solutions."'' On the one hand, there are many problems that have a solution space just as large, but can be solved in polynomial time (for example [[minimum spanning tree]]). On the other hand, there are NP-problems with at most one solution that are NP-hard under randomized polynomial-time reduction (see [[Valiant–Vazirani theorem]]).
* ''"Solving NP-complete problems requires exponential time."'' First, this would imply P ≠ NP, which is still an unsolved question. Further, some NP-complete problems actually have algorithms running in superpolynomial, but subexponential time such as O(2&lt;sup&gt;{{sqrt|''n''}}&lt;/sup&gt;''n''). For example, the [[Independent set problem|independent set]] and [[Dominating set problem|dominating set]] problems are NP-complete when restricted to [[planar graph]]s, but can be solved in subexponential time on [[planar graph]]s using the [[planar separator theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bern|1990}}; {{harvtxt|Deĭneko|Klinz|Woeginger|2006}}; {{harvtxt|Dorn|Penninks|Bodlaender|Fomin|2005}}; {{harvtxt|Lipton|Tarjan|1980}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''"All instances of an NP-complete problem are difficult."'' Often some instances, or even most instances, may be easy to solve within polynomial time. However, unless P=NP, any polynomial-time algorithm must asymptotically be wrong on more than polynomially many of the exponentially many inputs of a certain size.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hemaspaandra | first1 = L.

* ''"If P=NP, all cryptographic ciphers can be broken."'' A polynomial-time problem can be very difficult to solve in practice if the polynomial's degree or constants are large enough. For example, ciphers with a fixed key length, such as [[Advanced Encryption Standard]], can all be broken in constant time (and are thus already known to be in P), though with current technology that constant may exceed the age of the universe. In addition, [[Information-theoretic security|information-theoretic security]] provides cryptographic methods that cannot be broken even with unlimited computing power.

== Properties ==
Viewing a [[decision problem#Definition|decision problem]] as a formal language in some fixed encoding, the set NPC of all NP-complete problems is '''not closed''' under:
* [[Union (set theory)|union]]
* [[intersection]]
* [[concatenation]]
* [[Kleene star]]

It is not known whether NPC is closed under [[Complement (complexity)|complementation]], since NPC=[[co-NP-complete|co-NPC]] if and only if NP=[[co-NP]], and whether NP=co-NP is an [[Open problem|open question]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title = Complexity and Cryptography: An Introduction |first1 = John |last1 = Talbot|first2=D.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ohm's law is an [[empirical law|empirical relation]] which accurately describes the conductivity of the vast majority of [[electrical conductor|electrically conductive materials]] over many orders of magnitude of current.  However some materials do not obey Ohm's law, these are called [[Non-ohmic resistance|non-ohmic]].

The law was named after the German physicist [[Georg Ohm]], who, in a treatise published in 1827, described measurements of applied voltage and current through simple electrical circuits containing various lengths of wire. Ohm explained his experimental results by a slightly more complex equation than the modern form above (see [[#History|History]]).

In physics, the term ''Ohm's law'' is also used to refer to various generalizations of the law; for example the [[Vector (mathematics and physics)|vector]] form of the law used in [[electromagnetics]] and material science:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} = \sigma \mathbf{E},&lt;/math&gt;

where '''J''' is the [[current density]] at a given location in a resistive material, '''E''' is the electric field at that location, and ''σ'' ([[sigma]]) is a material-dependent parameter called the [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]].  This reformulation of Ohm's law is due to [[Gustav Kirchhoff]].&lt;ref&gt;Olivier Darrigol, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZzeYSbqITWkC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=%22alternative+formulation+of+Ohm%27s+law%22+isbn:0198505949&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0#v=onepage&amp;q=%22alternative%20formulation%20of%20Ohm%27s%20law%22%20isbn%3A0198505949&amp;f=false ''Electrodynamics from Ampère to Einstein''], p.70, Oxford University Press, 2000 {{ISBN|0-19-850594-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Ohm3.gif|thumb|200px|Georg Ohm]]
In January 1781, before [[Georg Ohm]]'s work, [[Henry Cavendish]] experimented with [[Leyden jar]]s and glass tubes of varying diameter and length filled with salt solution.  He measured the current by noting how strong a shock he felt as he completed the circuit with his body.  Cavendish wrote that the "velocity" (current) varied directly as the "degree of electrification" (voltage). He did not communicate his results to other scientists at the time,&lt;ref name=eb&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Electricity|volume=9|page=182|first=John Ambrose |last=Fleming}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his results were unknown until [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]] published them in 1879.&lt;ref&gt;Sanford P. Bordeau (1982)  ''Volts to Hertz...the Rise of Electricity.''  Burgess Publishing Company, Minneapolis, MN.  pp.86–107, {{ISBN|0-8087-4908-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Francis Ronalds]] delineated “intensity” (voltage) and “quantity” (current) for the [[Voltaic pile#Dry pile|dry pile]] – a high voltage source – in 1814 using a [[Electrometer#Gold-leaf electrometer|gold-leaf electrometer]].  He found for a dry pile that the relationship between the two parameters was not proportional under certain meteorological conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sir Francis Ronalds: Father of the Electric Telegraph|last=Ronalds|first=B.

[[File:Ohmsches Gesetz in Georg Simon Ohms Laborbuch.jpg|thumb|Ohm's law in Georg Ohm's lab book.]]
Ohm did his work on resistance in the years 1825 and 1826, and published his results in 1827 as the book ''Die galvanische Kette, mathematisch bearbeitet'' ("The galvanic circuit investigated mathematically").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He drew considerable inspiration from [[Joseph Fourier|Fourier]]'s work on heat conduction in the theoretical explanation of his work.  For experiments, he initially used [[voltaic pile]]s, but later used a [[thermocouple]] as this provided a more stable voltage source in terms of internal resistance and constant voltage.  He used a galvanometer to measure current, and knew that the voltage between the thermocouple terminals was proportional to the junction temperature.  He then added test wires of varying length, diameter, and material to complete the circuit.  He found that his data could be modeled through the equation
:&lt;math&gt;x = \frac{a}{b + l},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''x'' was the reading from the [[galvanometer]], ''l'' was the length of the test conductor, ''a'' depended on the thermocouple junction temperature, and ''b'' was a constant of the entire setup.  From this, Ohm determined his law of proportionality and published his results.

In modern notation we would write,

:&lt;math&gt; I = \frac {\mathcal E}{r+R},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal E&lt;/math&gt; is the open-circuit emf of the thermocouple, &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the internal resistance of the thermocouple and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the resistance of the test wire.  In terms of the length of the wire this becomes,

:&lt;math&gt; I = \frac {\mathcal E}{r+\mathcal R l},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal R&lt;/math&gt; is the resistance of the test wire per unit length.  Thus, Ohm's coefficients are,

:&lt;math&gt; a = \frac {\mathcal E}{\mathcal R}, \quad b = \frac {\mathcal r}{\mathcal R} .&lt;/math&gt;

Ohm's law was probably the most important of the early quantitative descriptions of the physics of electricity.  We consider it almost obvious today. When Ohm first published his work, this was not the case; critics reacted to his treatment of the subject with hostility.  They called his work a "web of naked fancies"&lt;ref&gt;
Davies, B, "A web of naked fancies?", ''Physics Education'' 15 57–61, Institute of Physics, Issue 1, Jan 1980 [http://www.iop.org/EJ/S/UNREG/an0VsEw7ynSY0UzIRNaNVQ/abstract/0031-9120/15/1/314]
&lt;/ref&gt; and the German Minister of Education proclaimed that "a professor who preached such heresies was unworthy to teach science."&lt;ref&gt;Hart, IB, ''Makers of Science'', London, Oxford University Press, 1923. p. 243. [http://www.foresight.org/news/negativeComments.html#loc037]&lt;/ref&gt; The prevailing scientific philosophy in Germany at the time asserted that experiments need not be performed to develop an understanding of nature because nature is so well ordered, and that scientific truths may be deduced through reasoning alone.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Schnädelbach, ''Philosophy in Germany 1831–1933'', pages 78-79, Cambridge University Press, 1984 {{ISBN|0521296463}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, Ohm's brother Martin, a mathematician, was battling the German educational system. These factors hindered the acceptance of Ohm's work, and his work did not become widely accepted until the 1840s.  However, Ohm received recognition for his contributions to science well before he died.

In the 1850s, Ohm's law was known as such and was widely considered proved, and alternatives, such as "[[Barlow's law]]", were discredited, in terms of real applications to telegraph system design, as discussed by [[Samuel F. B. Morse]] in 1855.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Shaffner's Telegraph Companion: Devoted to the Science and Art of the Morse Telegraph | author = Taliaferro Preston | authorlink = Taliaferro Preston Shaffner | publisher = Pudney &amp; Russell | volume = Vol.2 | year = 1855 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=TDEOAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA43&amp;dq=ohm%27s-law+date:0-1860 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[electron]] was discovered in 1897 by [[J. J. Thomson]], and it was quickly realized that it is the particle ([[charge carrier]]) that carries electric currents in electric circuits.  In 1900 the first ([[classical physics|classical]]) model of electrical conduction, the [[Drude model]], was proposed by [[Paul Drude]], which finally gave a scientific explanation for Ohm's law.  In this model, a solid conductor consists of a stationary lattice of [[atom]]s ([[ion]]s), with [[conduction electron]]s moving randomly in it.  A voltage across a conductor causes an [[electric field]], which accelerates the electrons in the direction of the electric field, causing a drift of electrons which is the electric current.  However the electrons collide with and scatter off of the atoms, which randomizes their motion, thus converting the kinetic energy added to the electron by the field to [[heat]] ([[thermal energy]]).  Using statistical distributions, it can be shown that the average drift velocity of the electrons, and thus the current, is proportional to the electric field, and thus the voltage, over a wide range of voltages.

The development of [[quantum mechanics]] in the 1920s modified this picture somewhat, but in modern theories the average drift velocity of electrons can still be shown to be proportional to the electric field, thus deriving Ohm's law. In 1927 [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] applied the quantum [[Fermi-Dirac distribution]] of electron energies to the Drude model, resulting in the [[free electron model]]. A year later, [[Felix Bloch]] showed that electrons move in waves ([[Bloch wave]]s) through a solid crystal lattice, so scattering off the lattice atoms as postulated in the Drude model is not a major process; the electrons scatter off impurity atoms and defects in the material. The final successor, the modern quantum [[band theory]] of solids, showed that the electrons in a solid cannot take on any energy as assumed in the Drude model but are restricted to energy bands, with gaps between them of energies that electrons are forbidden to have.   The size of the band gap is a characteristic of a particular substance which has a great deal to do with its electrical resistivity, explaining why some substances are [[electrical conductor]]s, some [[semiconductor]]s, and some [[insulator (electricity)|insulator]]s.

While the old term for electrical conductance, the [[Siemens (unit)|mho]] (the inverse of the resistance unit ohm), is still used, a new name, the [[Siemens (unit)|siemens]], was adopted in 1971, honoring [[Ernst Werner von Siemens]].  The siemens is preferred in formal papers.

In the 1920s, it was discovered that the current through a practical resistor actually has statistical fluctuations, which depend on temperature, even when voltage and resistance are exactly constant; this fluctuation, now known as [[Johnson–Nyquist noise]], is due to the discrete nature of charge.  This thermal effect implies that measurements of current and voltage that are taken over sufficiently short periods of time will yield ratios of V/I that fluctuate from the value of R implied by the time average or [[ensemble average]] of the measured current; Ohm's law remains correct for the average current, in the case of ordinary resistive materials.

Ohm's work long preceded [[Maxwell's equations]] and any understanding of frequency-dependent effects in AC circuits. Modern developments in electromagnetic theory and circuit theory do not contradict Ohm's law when they are evaluated within the appropriate limits.

==Scope==
Ohm's law is an [[empirical law]], a generalization from many experiments that have shown that current is approximately proportional to electric field for most materials. It is less fundamental than [[Maxwell's equations]] and is not always obeyed. Any given material will [[electrical breakdown|break down]] under a strong-enough electric field, and some materials of interest in electrical engineering are "non-ohmic" under weak fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Purcell |first=Edward M. |authorlink=Edward Mills Purcell |year=1985 |title=Electricity and magnetism |edition=2nd |series=Berkeley Physics Course |volume=2 |isbn=0-07-004908-4 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Griffiths |first=David J. |authorlink=David Griffiths (physicist) |year=1999 |title=Introduction to electrodynamics |edition=3rd |publisher=Prentice Hall |isbn=0-13-805326-X |page=289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ohm's law has been observed on a wide range of length scales. In the early 20th century, it was thought that Ohm's law would fail at the [[Atomic spacing|atomic scale]], but experiments have not borne out this expectation. As of 2012, researchers have demonstrated that Ohm's law works for [[silicon]] wires as small as four atoms wide and one atom high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weber | first1 = B. | last2 = Mahapatra | first2 = S. | last3 = Ryu | first3 = H. | last4 = Lee | first4 = S. | last5 = Fuhrer | first5 = A. | last6 = Reusch | first6 = T.

{{Main|Drude model}}

The dependence of the current density on the applied electric field is essentially [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] in nature;  (see Classical and quantum conductivity.)  A qualitative description leading to Ohm's law can be based upon [[classical mechanics]] using the [[Drude model]] developed by [[Paul Drude]] in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The Drude model treats [[electron]]s (or other charge carriers) like pinballs bouncing among the [[ion]]s that make up the structure of the material.  Electrons will be accelerated in the opposite direction to the electric field by the average electric field at their location. With each collision, though, the electron is deflected in a random direction with a velocity that is much larger than the velocity gained by the electric field.  The net result is that electrons take a zigzag path due to the collisions, but generally drift in a direction opposing the electric field.

The [[drift velocity]] then determines the electric [[current density]] and its relationship to '''''E''''' and is independent of the collisions.  Drude calculated the average drift velocity from '''''p'''''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−''e'''E'''τ'' where '''''p''''' is the average [[momentum]], −''e'' is the charge of the electron and τ is the average time between the collisions.   Since both the momentum and the current density are proportional to the drift velocity, the current density becomes proportional to the applied electric field; this leads to Ohm's law.

==Hydraulic analogy==

A [[hydraulic analogy]] is sometimes used to describe Ohm's law.  Water pressure, measured by [[pascal (unit)|pascals]] (or [[pounds per square inch|PSI]]), is the analog of voltage because establishing a water pressure difference between two points along a (horizontal) pipe causes water to flow.  Water flow rate, as in [[liter]]s per second, is the analog of current, as in [[coulomb]]s per second. Finally, flow restrictors—such as apertures placed in pipes between points where the water pressure is measured—are the analog of resistors. We say that the rate of water flow through an aperture restrictor is proportional to the difference in water pressure across the restrictor. Similarly, the rate of flow of electrical charge, that is, the electric current, through an electrical resistor is proportional to the difference in voltage measured across the resistor.

Flow and pressure variables can be calculated in fluid flow network with the use of the hydraulic ohm analogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=A. Akers |author2=M. Gassman |author3=R.

The interchangeability of the equation may be represented by a triangle, where V ([[voltage]]) is placed on the top section, the I ([[electric current|current]]) is placed to the left section, and the R ([[electrical resistance|resistance]]) is placed to the right. The line that divides the left and right sections indicates multiplication, and the divider between the top and bottom sections indicates division (hence the division bar).

===Resistive circuits===

[[Resistor]]s are circuit elements that impede the passage of electric charge in agreement with Ohm's law, and are designed to have a specific resistance value ''R''.  In a schematic diagram the resistor is shown as a zig-zag symbol.  An element (resistor or conductor) that behaves according to Ohm's law over some operating range is referred to as an ''ohmic device'' (or an ''ohmic resistor'') because Ohm's law and a single value for the resistance suffice to describe the behavior of the device over that range.

Ohm's law holds for circuits containing only resistive elements (no capacitances or inductances) for all forms of driving voltage or current, regardless of whether the driving voltage or current is constant ([[direct current|DC]]) or time-varying such as [[alternating current|AC]].  At any instant of time Ohm's law is valid for such circuits.

Resistors which are in ''[[Series and parallel circuits#Series circuits|series]]'' or in ''[[Series and parallel circuits#Parallel circuits|parallel]]'' may be grouped together into a single "equivalent resistance" in order to apply Ohm's law in analyzing the circuit.

===Reactive circuits with time-varying signals===

When reactive elements such as capacitors, inductors, or transmission lines are involved in a circuit to which AC or time-varying voltage or current is applied, the relationship between voltage and current becomes the solution to a [[differential equation]], so Ohm's law (as defined above) does not directly apply since that form contains only resistances having value R, not complex impedances which may contain capacitance ("C") or inductance ("L").

Equations for [[time-invariant]] [[alternating current|AC]] circuits take the same form as Ohm's law. However, the variables are generalized to [[complex number]]s and the current and voltage waveforms are [[complex exponential]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Fundamentals of Electrical Engineering | author = Rajendra Prasad | publisher = Prentice-Hall of India | year = 2006 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nsmcbzOJU3kC&amp;pg=PA140&amp;dq=ohm%27s-law+complex+exponentials | isbn = 978-81-203-2729-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this approach, a voltage or current waveform takes the form &lt;math&gt;Ae^{st}&lt;/math&gt;, where ''t'' is time, ''s'' is a complex parameter, and ''A'' is a complex scalar.  In any [[LTI system theory|linear time-invariant system]], all of the currents and voltages can be expressed with the same ''s'' parameter as the input to the system, allowing the time-varying complex exponential term to be canceled out and the system described algebraically in terms of the complex scalars in the current and voltage waveforms.

The complex generalization of resistance is [[electrical impedance|impedance]], usually denoted ''Z''; it can be shown that for an inductor,

:&lt;math&gt;Z = sL\,&lt;/math&gt;

and for a capacitor,

:&lt;math&gt;Z = \frac{1}{sC}.&lt;/math&gt;

We can now write,

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{V} = \boldsymbol{I} \cdot \boldsymbol{Z}&lt;/math&gt;

where '''''V''''' and '''''I''''' are the complex scalars in the voltage and current respectively and '''''Z''''' is the complex impedance.

This form of Ohm's law, with ''Z'' taking the place of ''R'', generalizes the simpler form.  When ''Z'' is complex, only the real part is responsible for dissipating heat.

In the general AC circuit, ''Z'' varies strongly with the frequency parameter ''s'', and so also will the relationship between voltage and current.

For the common case of a steady [[Sine wave|sinusoid]], the ''s'' parameter is taken to be &lt;math&gt;j\omega&lt;/math&gt;, corresponding to a complex sinusoid &lt;math&gt;Ae^{\mbox{ } j \omega t}&lt;/math&gt;.  The real parts of such complex current and voltage waveforms describe the actual sinusoidal currents and voltages in a circuit, which can be in different phases due to the different complex scalars.

===Linear approximations===

{{See also|Small-signal modeling|Network analysis (electrical circuits)#Small signal equivalent circuit}}

Ohm's law is one of the basic equations used in the [[Network analysis (electrical circuits)|analysis of electrical circuits]].  It applies to both metal conductors and circuit components ([[resistor]]s) specifically made for this behaviour.  Both are ubiquitous in electrical engineering.  Materials and components that obey Ohm's law are described as "ohmic" &lt;ref&gt;Hughes, E, ''Electrical Technology'', pp10, Longmans, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; which means they produce the same value for resistance (R = V/I) regardless of the value of V or I which is applied and whether the applied voltage or current is DC ([[direct current]]) of either positive or negative polarity or AC ([[alternating current]]).

In a true ohmic device, the same value of resistance will be calculated from R = V/I regardless of the value of the applied voltage V.  That is, the ratio of V/I is constant, and when current is plotted as a function of voltage the curve is ''linear'' (a straight line).  If voltage is forced to some value V, then that voltage V divided by measured current I will equal R.  Or if the current is forced to some value I, then the measured voltage V divided by that current I is also R.  Since the plot of I versus V is a straight line, then it is also true that for any set of two different voltages V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; applied across a given device of resistance R, producing currents I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/R and I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/R, that the ratio (V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;−V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)/(I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;−I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is also a constant equal to R.  The operator "delta" (Δ) is used to represent a difference in a quantity, so we can write ΔV = V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;−V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ΔI = I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;−I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  Summarizing, for any truly ohmic device having resistance R, V/I = ΔV/ΔI = R for any applied voltage or current or for the difference between any set of applied voltages or currents.

[[File:FourIVcurves.svg|thumb|400px|The [[I–V curve]]s of four devices: Two [[resistor]]s, a [[diode]], and a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]]. The two resistors follow Ohm's law: The plot is a straight line through the origin. The other two devices do ''not'' follow Ohm's law.]]

There are, however, components of electrical circuits which do not obey Ohm's law; that is, their relationship between current and voltage (their [[I–V curve]]) is ''nonlinear'' (or non-ohmic).  An example is the [[Diode#Shockley diode equation|p-n junction diode]] (curve at right).  As seen in the figure, the current does not increase linearly with applied voltage for a diode.  One can determine a value of current (I) for a given value of applied voltage (V) from the curve, but not from Ohm's law, since the value of "resistance" is not constant as a function of applied voltage.  Further, the current only increases significantly if the applied voltage is positive, not negative.  The ratio ''V''/''I'' for some point along the nonlinear curve is sometimes called the ''static'', or ''chordal'', or [[direct current|DC]], resistance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Engineering System Dynamics | author = Forbes T. Brown | publisher = CRC Press | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-8493-9648-9 | page = 43 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=UzqX4j9VZWcC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=%22chordal+resistance%22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Electromagnetic Compatibility Handbook | author = Kenneth L.

This means the "DC resistance" V/I at some point on the curve is not the same as what would be determined by applying an AC signal having peak amplitude ΔV volts or ΔI amps centered at that same point along the curve and measuring ΔV/ΔI. However, in some diode applications, the AC signal applied to the device is small and it is possible to analyze the circuit in terms of the ''dynamic'', ''small-signal'', or ''incremental'' resistance, defined as the one over the slope of the V–I curve at the average value (DC operating point) of the voltage (that is, one over the [[derivative]] of current with respect to voltage).  For sufficiently small signals, the dynamic resistance allows the Ohm's law small signal resistance to be calculated as approximately one over the slope of a line drawn tangentially to the V-I curve at the DC operating point.&lt;ref name=horowitz-hill&gt;{{cite book |last=Horowitz |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Horowitz |author2=[[Winfield Hill]] | title=The Art of Electronics |edition=2nd |year=1989 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-37095-7 |page = 13 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bkOMDgwFA28C&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=small-signal+%22dynamic+resistance%22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temperature effects==

Ohm's law has sometimes been stated as, "for a conductor in a given state, the electromotive force is proportional to the current produced."  That is, that the resistance, the ratio of the applied [[electromotive force]] (or voltage) to the current, "does not vary with the current strength ."  The qualifier "in a given state" is usually interpreted as meaning "at a constant temperature," since the resistivity of materials is usually temperature dependent. Because the conduction of current is related to [[Joule heating]] of the conducting body, according to [[Joule's first law]], the temperature of a conducting body may change when it carries a current.  The dependence of resistance on temperature therefore makes resistance depend upon the current in a typical experimental setup, making the law in this form difficult to directly verify.  [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]] and others worked out several methods to test the law experimentally in 1876, controlling for heating effects.&lt;ref&gt;

==Relation to heat conductions==
{{See also|Conduction (heat)}}
Ohm's principle predicts the flow of electrical charge (i.e. current) in electrical conductors when subjected to the influence of voltage differences; [[Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier|Jean-Baptiste-Joseph Fourier]]'s principle predicts the flow of [[heat]] in heat conductors when subjected to the influence of temperature differences.

The same equation describes both phenomena, the equation's variables taking on different meanings in the two cases. Specifically, solving a heat conduction (Fourier) problem with ''[[temperature]]'' (the driving "force") and ''[[flux|flux of heat]]'' (the rate of flow of the driven "quantity", i.e. heat energy) variables also solves an analogous [[electrical conduction]] (Ohm) problem having ''[[electric potential]]'' (the driving "force") and ''[[electric current]]'' (the rate of flow of the driven "quantity", i.e. charge) variables.

The basis of Fourier's work was his clear conception and definition of [[thermal conductivity]]. He assumed that, all else being the same, the flux of heat is strictly proportional to the gradient of temperature. Although undoubtedly true for small temperature gradients, strictly proportional behavior will be lost when real materials (e.g. ones having a thermal conductivity that is a function of temperature) are subjected to large temperature gradients.

A similar assumption is made in the statement of Ohm's law: other things being alike, the strength of the current at each point is proportional to the gradient of electric potential. The accuracy of the assumption that flow is proportional to the gradient is more readily tested, using modern measurement methods, for the electrical case than for the heat case.

==Other versions==

Ohm's law, in the form above, is an extremely useful equation in the field of electrical/electronic engineering because it describes how voltage, current and resistance are interrelated on a "macroscopic" level, that is, commonly, as circuit elements in an [[electrical circuit]]. Physicists who study the electrical properties of matter at the microscopic level use a closely related and more general [[Vector (mathematics and physics)|vector]] equation, sometimes also referred to as Ohm's law, having variables that are closely related to the V, I, and R [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] variables of Ohm's law, but which are each functions of position within the conductor.  Physicists often use this continuum form of Ohm's Law:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{E} = \rho \mathbf{J}
&lt;/math&gt;

where "'''E'''" is the [[electric field]] vector with units of volts per meter (analogous to "V" of Ohm's law which has units of volts), "'''J'''" is the [[current density]] vector with units of amperes per unit area (analogous to "I" of Ohm's law which has units of amperes), and "ρ" (Greek "rho") is the [[resistivity]] with units of ohm·meters (analogous to "R" of Ohm's law which has units of ohms).  The above equation is sometimes written&lt;ref&gt;Seymour J, ''Physical Electronics'', Pitman, 1972, pp 53–54&lt;/ref&gt; as '''J''' = &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;'''E''' where "σ" (Greek "sigma") is the [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]] which is the reciprocal of ρ.

[[File:Ohms law vectors.svg|thumb|290px|Current flowing through a uniform cylindrical conductor (such as a round wire) with a uniform field applied.]]
The voltage between two points is defined as:&lt;ref&gt;Lerner L, ''Physics for scientists and engineers'', Jones &amp; Bartlett, 1997, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Nv5GAyAdijoC&amp;pg=PA685 pp. 685–686]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;{\Delta V} = -\int {\mathbf E \cdot d \mathbf l} &lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;d \mathbf l&lt;/math&gt; the element of path along the integration of electric field vector '''E'''. If the applied '''E''' field is uniform and oriented along the length of the conductor as shown in the figure, then defining the voltage V in the usual convention of being opposite in direction to the field (see figure), and with the understanding that the voltage V is measured differentially across the length of the conductor allowing us to drop the Δ symbol, the above vector equation reduces to the scalar equation:

:&lt;math&gt;V = {E}{l}  \ \  \text{or} \ \ E = \frac{V}{l}. &lt;/math&gt;

Since the '''E''' field is uniform in the direction of wire length, for a conductor having uniformly consistent resistivity ρ, the current density '''J''' will also be uniform in any cross-sectional area and oriented in the direction of wire length, so we may write:&lt;ref name=lerner732&gt;Lerner L, ''Physics for scientists and engineers'', Jones &amp; Bartlett, 1997, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Nv5GAyAdijoC&amp;pg=PA732 pp. 732–733]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; J = \frac{I}{a}.&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the above 2 results (for ''E'' and ''J'' respectively) into the continuum form shown at the beginning of this section:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{V}{l} = \frac{I}{a}\rho \qquad \text{or} \qquad V = I \rho \frac{l}{a}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[electrical resistance]] of a uniform conductor is given in terms of [[resistivity]] by:&lt;ref name=lerner732/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;{R} = \rho \frac{l}{a} &lt;/math&gt;
where ''l'' is the length of the conductor in [[International System of Units|SI]] units of meters, ''a'' is the cross-sectional area (for a round wire ''a'' = ''πr''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; if ''r'' is radius) in units of meters squared, and ρ is the resistivity in units of ohm·meters.

After substitution of ''R'' from the above equation into the equation preceding it, the continuum form of Ohm's law for a uniform field (and uniform current density) oriented along the length of the conductor reduces to the more familiar form:
:&lt;math&gt;{V}={I}{R}. \ &lt;/math&gt;

A perfect crystal lattice, with low enough thermal motion and no deviations from periodic structure, would have no [[resistivity]],&lt;ref&gt;Seymour J, ''Physical Electronics'', pp 48–49, Pitman, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; but a real metal has [[crystallographic defect]]s, impurities, multiple [[isotope]]s, and thermal motion of the atoms. Electrons [[scattering|scatter]] from all of these, resulting in resistance to their flow.

The more complex generalized forms of Ohm's law are important to [[condensed matter physics]], which studies the properties of [[matter]] and, in particular, its [[electronic structure]]. In broad terms, they fall under the topic of [[constitutive equations]] and the theory of [[Green–Kubo relations|transport coefficients]].

===Magnetic effects===
If an external '''B'''-field is present and the conductor is not at rest but moving at velocity '''v''', then an extra term must be added to account for the current induced by the [[Lorentz force]] on the charge carriers.
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} = \sigma (\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B})&lt;/math&gt;

In the [[rest frame]] of the moving conductor this term drops out because '''v'''= 0. There is no contradiction because the electric field in the rest frame differs from the '''E'''-field in the lab frame: '''E′'''  = '''E''' + '''v'''×'''B'''.
Electric and magnetic fields are relative, see [[Lorentz transformation]].

If the current '''J''' is alternating because the applied voltage or '''E'''-field varies in time, then reactance must be added to resistance to account for self-inductance, see [[electrical impedance]]. The reactance may be strong if the frequency is high or the conductor is coiled.

===Conductive fluids===
In a conductive fluid, such as a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], there is a similar effect. Consider a fluid moving with the velocity &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; in a magnetic field &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;. The relative motion induces an electric field &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}&lt;/math&gt; which exerts [[electric force]] on the charged particles giving rise to an [[electric current]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}&lt;/math&gt;. The equation of motion for the electron gas, with a [[number density]] &lt;math&gt;n_e&lt;/math&gt;, is written as

:&lt;math&gt; m_en_e{d\mathbf{v}_e\over dt}=-n_e e \mathbf{E}+ n_e m_e \nu (v_i-v_e)-en_e\mathbf{v}_e\times \mathbf{B}, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;m_e&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_e&lt;/math&gt; are the charge, mass and velocity of the electrons, respectively. Also, &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is the frequency of collisions of the electrons with ions which have a velocity field &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_i&lt;/math&gt;. Since, the electron has a very small mass compared with that of ions, we can ignore the left hand side of the above equation to write

:&lt;math&gt; \sigma(\mathbf{E}+\mathbf{v}\times \mathbf{B})=\mathbf{J}, &lt;/math&gt;

where we have used the definition of the [[current density]], and also put &lt;math&gt;\sigma={n_e e^2\over \nu m_e}&lt;/math&gt; which is the [[electrical conductivity]]. This equation can also be equivalently written as

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{E}+\mathbf{v}\times \mathbf{B}=\rho\mathbf{J}, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho=\sigma^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[electrical resistivity]]. It is also common to write &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; which can be confusing since it is the same notation used for the magnetic diffusivity defined as &lt;math&gt;\eta=1/\mu_0\sigma&lt;/math&gt;.

'''''Opus craticum''''' or ''craticii'' is an [[ancient Roman]] construction technique described by [[Vitruvius]] in his books ''[[De architectura]]'' as [[Wattle and daub|wattlework]] which is plastered over. Vitruvius disparaged this building technique as a grave fire risk, likely to have cracked plaster, and not durable.&lt;ref&gt;Vitruvius, De Architectura, Book II, Chapter 8, paragraph 20. http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Vitruvius/2*.html#8.20&lt;/ref&gt; Surviving examples were found in the archaeological excavations at [[Pompeii]] and more so at [[Herculaneum]], buried by the eruption of [[Mt. Vesuvius]] in 79 AD and excavated beginning in 1929. Scholarly confusion exists&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich, Roger Bradley. Roman woodworking. New Haven [CT: Yale University Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adam, Jean Pierre. Roman building: materials and techniques. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1994. 239, photo shows wall with a caption naming the wall as ''opus craticium'' with an infill of ''opus incertum''&lt;/ref&gt; and the term ''opus craticium'' is also used for the Roman building technique very similar, but not identified as being directly related to [[Timber framing|half-timbering]], a timber framework with the wall [[infill]] of stones in mortar called ''[[opus incertum]]''. An example of this technique is the House of Opus Craticum in Herculaneum,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sites.google.com/site/ad79eruption/herculaneum-1/insula-iii-2/house-of-the-opus-craticium |title=House of the Opus Craticium|accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a reconstruction of the original building.

Before the Romans, the Minoans, Etruscans, and Greeks are known to have used similar building techniques. At least since the 13th century, this type of construction, common in Europe, was called half-timbered in English, ''Fachwerk'' (framework) in German, ''entramado de madera'' in Spanish, and ''colombage'' in French.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10066">In applied mathematics – specifically in [[fuzzy logic]] – the '''ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operators''' provide a [[parameter]]ized class of mean type aggregation operators. They were introduced by [[Ronald R. Yager]]. Many notable mean operators such as the max, [[arithmetic average]], median and min, are members of this class. They have been widely used in [[computational intelligence]] because of their ability to model linguistically expressed aggregation instructions.

== Definition ==

Formally an '''OWA''' operator of dimension &lt;math&gt; \ n &lt;/math&gt; is a mapping &lt;math&gt; F: R_n \rightarrow R &lt;/math&gt; that has an associated collection of weights &lt;math&gt; \  W = [w_1, \ldots, w_n] &lt;/math&gt; lying in the unit interval and summing to one and with 		

:&lt;math&gt; F(a_1, \ldots , a_n) =  \sum_{j=1}^n  w_j b_j&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; b_j &lt;/math&gt; is the ''j''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; largest of the &lt;math&gt; a_i &lt;/math&gt;.

By choosing different ''W'' one can implement different aggregation operators. The OWA operator is a non-linear operator as a result of the process of determining the ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;.

== Properties ==

The OWA operator is a mean operator. It is [[Bounded operator|bounded]], [[monotonic]], [[symmetric operator|symmetric]], and [[idempotent]], as defined below.

{|class="wikitable"
|[[Bounded operator|Bounded]]
|&lt;math&gt;   \min(a_1, \ldots, a_n) \le F(a_1, \ldots, a_n) \le \max(a_1, \ldots, a_n) &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|[[Monotonic]]
|&lt;math&gt;   F(a_1, \ldots, a_n) \ge F(g_1, \ldots, g_n) &lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt; a_i \ge g_i &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\ i = 1,2,\ldots,n &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|[[symmetric operator|Symmetric]]
|&lt;math&gt;   F(a_1, \ldots, a_n)  = F(a_\boldsymbol{\pi(1)}, \ldots, a_\boldsymbol{\pi(n)})&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\pi} &lt;/math&gt; is a permutation map
|-
|[[Idempotent]]
|&lt;math&gt;  \ F(a_1, \ldots, a_n)  =  a &lt;/math&gt; if all &lt;math&gt; \ a_i = a &lt;/math&gt;
|}

== Notable OWA operators ==
:&lt;math&gt; \ F(a_1, \ldots, a_n) = \max(a_1, \ldots, a_n) &lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt; \ w_1 = 1 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \ w_j = 0 &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; j \ne 1 &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \ F(a_1, \ldots, a_n) = \min(a_1, \ldots, a_n) &lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt; \ w_n = 1 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \ w_j = 0 &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; j \ne n &lt;/math&gt;
:
:&lt;math&gt; \ F(a_1, \ldots, a_n) = \mathrm{average}(a_1, \ldots, a_n) &lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt; \ w_j = \frac{1}{n} &lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt; j \in [1, n] &lt;/math&gt;

== Characterizing features ==

Two features have been used to characterize the OWA operators. The first is the attitudinal character(orness).

This is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;A-C(W)= \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{j=1}^n (n - j) w_j. &lt;/math&gt;

It is known that &lt;math&gt; A-C(W) \in [0, 1] &lt;/math&gt;.

In addition ''A''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''C''(max) = 1, A&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;C(ave) = A&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;C(med) = 0.5 and A&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;C(min) = 0. Thus the A&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;C goes from 1 to 0 as we go from Max to Min aggregation. The attitudinal character characterizes the similarity of aggregation to OR operation(OR is defined as the Max).

The second feature is the dispersion. This defined as

:&lt;math&gt;H(W) = -\sum_{j=1}^n w_j \ln (w_j).&lt;/math&gt;

An alternative definition is &lt;math&gt;E(W) = \sum_{j=1}^n w_j^2 .&lt;/math&gt; The dispersion characterizes how uniformly the arguments are being used

== A literature survey: OWA (1988-2014)==
The historical reconstruction of scientific development of the OWA field, the identification of the dominant direction of knowledge accumulation that emerged since the publication of the first OWA paper, and to discover the most active lines of research has recently been published, (see: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/int.21673/full). The results suggest, as expected, that Yager's paper[1] (IEEE Trans. Systems Man Cybernet, 18(1), 183–190, 1988) is the most influential paper and the starting point of all other research using OWA. Starting from his contribution, other lines of research developed and we describe them. Full list of papers published in OWA is also available at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/int.21673/full)

== Type-1 OWA aggregation operators ==

The above Yager's OWA operators are used to aggregate the crisp values. Can we aggregate fuzzy sets in the OWA mechanism ? The
'''[[Type-1 OWA operators]]''' have been proposed for this purpose. So the '''[[type-1 OWA operators]]''' provides us with a new technique for directly aggregating uncertain information with uncertain weights via OWA mechanism in soft decision making and data mining, where these uncertain objects are modelled by fuzzy sets.

The '''[[Type-1 OWA operators|type-1 OWA operator]]''' is defined according to the alpha-cuts of fuzzy sets as follows:

Given the ''n'' linguistic weights &lt;math&gt;\left\{ {W^i} \right\}_{i =1}^n &lt;/math&gt; in the form of fuzzy sets defined on the domain of discourse &lt;math&gt;U = [0,\;\;1]&lt;/math&gt;, then for each &lt;math&gt;\alpha \in [0,\;1]&lt;/math&gt;, an &lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt;/math&gt;-level type-1 OWA operator with &lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt;/math&gt;-level sets &lt;math&gt;\left\{ {W_\alpha ^i } \right\}_{i = 1}^n &lt;/math&gt; to aggregate the &lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt;/math&gt;-cuts of fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;\left\{ {A^i} \right\}_{i =1}^n &lt;/math&gt; is given as

: &lt;math&gt;
\Phi_\alpha \left( {A_\alpha ^1 , \ldots ,A_\alpha ^n } \right) =\left\{ {\frac{\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {w_i a_{\sigma (i)} } }{\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {w_i } }\left| {w_i \in W_\alpha ^i ,\;a_i } \right. \in A_\alpha ^i ,\;i = 1, \ldots ,n} \right\}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;W_\alpha ^i= \{w| \mu_{W_i }(w) \geq \alpha \}, A_\alpha ^i=\{ x| \mu _{A_i }(x)\geq \alpha \}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\sigma :\{\;1, \ldots ,n\;\} \to \{\;1, \ldots ,n\;\}&lt;/math&gt; is a permutation function such that &lt;math&gt;a_{\sigma (i)} \ge a_{\sigma (i + 1)} ,\;\forall \;i = 1, \ldots ,n - 1&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., &lt;math&gt;a_{\sigma (i)} &lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;th largest
element in the set &lt;math&gt;\left\{ {a_1 , \ldots ,a_n } \right\}&lt;/math&gt;.

The computation of the '''[[Type-1 OWA operators|type-1 OWA]]''' output is implemented by computing the left end-points and right end-points of the intervals &lt;math&gt;\Phi _\alpha \left( {A_\alpha ^1 , \ldots ,A_\alpha ^n } \right)&lt;/math&gt;:
&lt;math&gt;\Phi _\alpha \left( {A_\alpha ^1 , \ldots ,A_\alpha ^n } \right)_{-} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;
\Phi _\alpha \left( {A_\alpha ^1 , \ldots ,A_\alpha ^n } \right)_ {+},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;A_\alpha ^i=[A_{\alpha-}^i, A_{\alpha+}^i], W_\alpha ^i=[W_{\alpha-}^i, W_{\alpha+}^i]&lt;/math&gt;. Then membership function of resulting aggregation fuzzy set is:

:&lt;math&gt;\mu _{G} (x) = \mathop \vee _{\alpha :x \in \Phi _\alpha \left( {A_\alpha ^1 , \cdots
,A_\alpha ^n } \right)_\alpha } \alpha &lt;/math&gt;

For the left end-points, we need to solve the following programming problem:

:&lt;math&gt; \Phi _\alpha \left( {A_\alpha ^1 , \cdots ,A_\alpha ^n } \right)_{-} = \min\limits_{\begin{array}{l} W_{\alpha - }^i \le w_i \le W_{\alpha + }^i A_{\alpha - }^i \le a_i \le A_{\alpha + }^i  \end{array}} \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {w_i a_{\sigma (i)} / \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {w_i } } &lt;/math&gt;

while for the right end-points, we need to solve the following programming problem:

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi _\alpha \left( {A_\alpha ^1 , \cdots , A_\alpha ^n } \right)_{+} = \max\limits_{\begin{array}{l} W_{\alpha - }^i \le w_i \le W_{\alpha + }^i  A_{\alpha - }^i \le a_i \le A_{\alpha + }^i  \end{array}} \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {w_i a_{\sigma (i)} / \sum\limits_{i =
1}^n {w_i } } &lt;/math&gt;

[https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2010.191 This paper] has presented a fast method to solve two programming problem so that the type-1 OWA aggregation operation can be performed efficiently.

[[Image:Athen Stoa Ostrakismos 2.jpg|right|thumb|280px|Voting ostraca (for [[ostracism]], Ancient Greece)]]

An '''ostracon''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|ὄστρακον}} ''ostrakon'', plural {{lang|grc|ὄστρακα}} ''ostraka'') is a piece of [[pottery]], usually broken off from a [[vase]] or other [[earthenware]] vessel. In an [[archaeology|archaeological]] or [[epigraphy|epigraphical]] context, ''ostraca'' refer to [[sherd]]s or even small pieces of stone that have writing scratched into them. Usually these are considered to have been broken off before the writing was added; ancient people used the cheap, plentiful and durable broken pieces of pottery around them as convenient places to place writing for a wide variety of purposes, mostly very short inscriptions, but in some cases surprisingly long.

==Ostracism==
In [[Classical Athens]], when the decision at hand was to banish or exile a certain member of society, citizen peers would cast their vote by writing the name of the person on the sherd of pottery; the vote was counted and, if unfavorable, the person was [[exile]]d for a period of ten years from the city, thus giving rise to the term ''[[ostracism]]''.

==Egyptian limestone and potsherd ostraca==
[[Image:Heratic script limestone.jpg|right|thumb|210px|One of four official letters to [[Vizier (Ancient Egypt)|vizier]] Khay copied onto a [[limestone]] ostracon, in Egyptian [[Hieratic]] ]]

[[File:Egyptian - Ostracon with a Royal Head - Walters 321.jpg|left|thumb|The [[New Kingdom]] [[pharaoh]] depicted on this limestone fragment  bears the finesse of a master's hand. The two arms, however, are rendered more crudely. It is likely that a master used this ostracon to teach his student, and the work of both individuals can be seen on the piece. [[Walters Art Museum]], [[Baltimore]].|251x251px]]

Anything with a smooth surface could be used as a writing surface. Generally discarded material, ostraca were cheap, readily available and therefore frequently used  for writings of an ephemeral nature such as messages, prescriptions, receipts, students' exercises and notes: pottery [[sherd]]s, limestone flakes,&lt;ref name="Donadoni"&gt;{{Citation |editor-last=Donadoni |editor-first=Sergio |title=The Egyptians |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |year=1997 |isbn=0-226-15555-2 |page=78 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; thin fragments of other stone types, etc., but limestone sherds, being flaky and of a lighter color, were most common. Ostraca were typically small, covered with just a few words or a small picture drawn in ink;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Klauck |first=Hans-Josef |title=Ancient Letters And the New Testament: A Guide to Context and Exegesis |publisher=Baylor University Press |year=2006 |isbn=1-932792-40-6 |page=45 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; but the tomb of the craftsman Sennedjem at  Deir el Medina contained an enormous ostracon inscribed with the [[Story of Sinuhe]].&lt;ref name="Donadoni" /&gt;

The importance of ostraca for Egyptology is immense. The combination of their physical nature and the Egyptian climate have preserved texts, from the medical to the mundane, which in other cultures were lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Michel |last=Chauveau |title=Egypt in the Age of Cleopatra: History and Society Under the Ptolemies |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca, NY |year=2000 |isbn=0-8014-8576-2 |page=7 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; These can often serve as better witnesses of everyday life than literary treatises preserved in libraries.

===Deir el-Medina Medical Ostraca===
{{See also|Medical Ostraca of Deir el-Medina}}
The many ostraca found at [[Deir el-Medina]] provide a deeply compelling view into the medical workings of the [[New Kingdom]]. These ostraca have shown that, like other Egyptian communities, the workmen and inhabitants of Deir el-Medina received care through a combination of [[Ancient Egyptian medicine|medical treatment]], [[Ancient Egyptian religion|prayer]], and  [[Egyptian magic|magic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDowell|2002|p=53 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the records at Deir el-Medina indicate some level of division, as records from the village note both a “[[physician]]” who saw patients and prescribed treatments, and a “scorpion charmer” who specialized in magical cures for scorpion stings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Janssen |first=Jac. J. |title=Absence from Work by the Necropolis Workmen of Thebes |journal=Studien zur Altägyptischen Kultur |volume=8 |year=1980 |issue= |pages=127–152 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ostraca from Deir el-Medina also differed in their circulation. Magical spells and remedies were widely distributed among the workmen; there are even several cases of spells being sent from one worker to another, with no “trained” intermediary.&lt;ref&gt;Lesko, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDowell|2002|p=106}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Written medical texts appear to have been much rarer, however, with only a handful of ostraca containing [[Medical prescription|prescriptions]], indicating that the trained physician mixed the more complicated remedies himself. There are also several documents that show the writer sending for medical ingredients, but it is unknown whether these were sent according to a physician’s prescription, or to fulfill a [[home remedy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDowell|2002|p=57 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saqqara Dream Ostraca===
From 1964–1971, Bryan Emery excavated at [[Saqqara]] in search of [[Imhotep]]'s tomb; instead, the extensive catacombs of animal mummies were uncovered.  Apparently it was a pilgrim site, with as many as 1½ million [[ibis]] birds interred (as well as cats, dogs, rams, and lions). This 2nd-century BC site contained extensive pottery debris from the site offerings of the pilgrims.

Emery's excavations uncovered the "Dream Ostraca", created by a scribe named ''Hor of Sebennytos.'' A devotee of the god [[Thoth]], he lived adjacent to Thoth's sanctuary at the entrance to the North Catacomb and worked as a "proto-therapist", advising and comforting clients. He transferred his divinely-inspired dreams onto ostraca. The Dream Ostraca are 65 [[Demotic Egyptian|Demotic]] texts written on pottery and limestone.&lt;ref&gt;Reeves (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biblical period ostraca==
{{See also|List of artifacts significant to the Bible}}

Famous ostraca for [[Biblical archaeology]] have been found at:
* [[Arad, Israel]], or [[Tel Arad]]
* [[Lachish]]
* [[Mesad Hashavyahu]]
* [[Ostraca House]] at [[Samaria]]
* [[Elah Fortress]] at [[Khirbet Qeiyafa]]&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/meast/10/30/israel.ancient.text/ |title=Archeologist finds 3,000-year old Hebrew text |work=CNN |date=October 30, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Additionally, the lots drawn at [[Masada]] are believed to have been ostraca, and some potsherds resembling the lots have been found.

In October 2008, Israeli archaeologist, [[Yosef Garfinkel]] of the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], has discovered what he says to be the earliest known Hebrew text. This text was written on an Ostracon shard; Garfinkel believes this shard dates to the time of King David from the Old Testament, about 3,000 years ago. Carbon dating of the Ostracon and analysis of the pottery have dated the inscription to be about 1,000 years older than the Dead Sea Scrolls. The inscription has yet to be deciphered, however, some words, such as king, slave and judge have been translated. 
The shard was found about 20 miles southwest of Jerusalem at the Elah Fortress in Khirbet Qeiyafa, the earliest known fortified city of the biblical period of Israel.&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt;

==Christian ostraca==
{{unreferenced|section|date=January 2014}}
Some Christian texts are preserved upon ostraca. In the late 19th century, 20 ostraca were found in [[Upper Egypt]], probably from the 7th century, written in [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Coptic language|Coptic]].

The ostraca are of different sizes and shapes. The more extant is [[Luke 22]]:40-71, which runs over 10 pieces. The ostraca contain from 2 to 9 verses each, and cover {{bibleref|Matthew|27:31–32}}; Mark 5:40-41 (Mark 9:3); Mark 9:17-18, Mark 9:22; Mark 15:21; Luke 12:13-16; Luke 22:40-71; John 1:1-9; John 1:14-17; John 18:19-25; John 19:15-17. There is one ostracon with the inscription "St. Peter the evangelist," perhaps an allusion to the Gospel of Peter.

A Coptic Sa'idic ostracon preserves the [[Pericope Adulterae]] found in John 7:53-8:1, which is otherwise omitted in the Sa'idic New Testament. A Christian hymn to Mary, similar to the canticles of Luke, and some Christian letters have also been found.

Inscriptions on clay, wood, metal, and other hard materials, like [[Papyrus|papyri]], are valuable especially as literary sources for [[Early Christianity]]. They are found chiefly in Oriental countries (i.e. ''east'' of Rome or [[Southwest Asia]]), especially Egypt (which though east of Rome is technically [[North Africa]]). The greatest number are pieces of clay or scraps of pots inscribed with colors or ink. The oldest Christian ostraca, like the papyri, are Greek and date from the [[Christianity in the 5th century|5th century]]; next come the Coptic and Arabian ostraca. Some of the texts not yet deciphered include several Nubian ostraca in a language spoken in the old Christian kingdoms in the vicinity of Aloa on the [[Blue Nile]]. 

In these inscriptions Greek letters are used, with some other signs. As to contents, ostraca are either profane or ecclesiastical. Potsherds were often used for correspondence in place of the less durable papyrus; occasionally the recipient wrote the answer on the back of the potsherd. Ostraca were also used for mercantile purposes, as bills, receipts, etc. C. M. Kaufmann and J. C. Ewald Falls, while excavating the town of Menas in the Libyan desert, discovered ostraca of this class—the oldest Christian potsherds in the Greek language (5th century)—and H. J. Bell and F. G. Kenyon of the British Museum deciphered them. 

They refer to the vine-culture of the sanctuaries of Menas and represent, for the most part, short vouchers for money or provisions. The currency is based upon gold [[solidi]] issued by [[Constantine I|Constantine]]; the date is reckoned by the year of indiction. Of historical interest is the assistance given to invalid workmen, the employment of the lower clergy, the manner of provisioning the workmen, and especially the statements about the harvest periods in the Libyan district. The series of Coptic ostraca which deals with the clergy and the monasteries in the Nile valley is particularly extensive. They refer to all phases of administration and popular life. 

The ecclesiastical ostraca, in a narrow sense, contain Biblical citations from the [[New Testament]], prayers, extracts from the [[synaxaria]] (lives of the saints), and are partly of a liturgic character. Greek, which was then the language of the Church, is much used, with the Coptic. Among the samples published by W.E. Crum, a fine judge of Coptic dialects, there is a local confession of faith from the 6th century, besides the Preface and Sanctus of the Mass, prayers from the [[Liturgy of St. Basil]] and of St. Mark, a part of the [[didascalia]] of [[Schenûte of Athribis]], a Greek confession, and an [[excommunication]], also in Greek.
 
Particularly remarkable are those ostraca which contain liturgical songs. They represent our present song-books for which purpose rolls of papyrus were less suited than the more durable potsherds; in some cases wooden books were used. Among the pieces translated by Crum we find petitions for ordination in which the petitioner promises to learn by heart one of the Gospels, and a reference to an ancient abstinence movement, against which is directed a decree that the consecration-wine should be pure or at least three-fourths pure.

'''Pro Tools''' is a [[digital audio workstation]] developed and released by [[Avid Technology]] for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[OS X|macOS]] which can be used for a wide range of [[sound recording]] and sound production purposes. Pro Tools can run as standalone [[software]], or operate using a range of external [[analog/digital converter]]s and internal [[PCI Local Bus]] (PCI) or [[PCIe]] [[audio card]]s with onboard [[digital signal processor]]s (DSP) to provide [[effects unit|effects]] such as [[reverb]], [[Equalization (audio)|equalization]] and [[compression (audio)|compression]]. Like all digital audio workstation software, Pro Tools can perform the functions of a [[multitrack tape recorder]] and [[audio mixer]], along with additional features that can only be performed in the digital domain, such as non-destructive editing, using the Undo feature.

Most of Pro Tools' basic functions can be controlled within Edit or Mix windows, which the user can see on a [[Flat-panel display|computer screen]]. The Edit window displays audio and [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface]] (MIDI) tracks, and provides graphical representation of the information recorded or imported. Here, audio can be edited in a [[Non-linear editing system|non-linear]], [[non-destructive editing|non-destructive]] fashion. Pro Tools supports 16-bit, 24-bit, and [[32-bit]] [[float (computing)|float]] audio [[Audio bit depth|bit depths]] at [[sample rate]]s up to 192&amp;nbsp;kHz. Pro Tools can handle [[WAV]], [[AIFF]], AIFC, [[mp3]], and formerly SDII audio files. Pro Tools has also most recently incorporated video editing capabilities, so users can import and manipulate high definition video file formats such as XDCAM, MJPG-A, PhotoJPG, DV25, [[QuickTime]], and more. It features [[time code]], tempo maps, elastic audio, [[Console automation|automation]] and [[surround sound]] abilities. The Pro Tools [[Time-division multiplexing|TDM]] mix engine (supported until 2011) employed [[24-bit]] [[fixed-point arithmetic]] for plug-in processing and [[48-bit]] for mixing; current HDX hardware systems, HD Native and native systems use [[32-bit]] [[Floating-point arithmetic|floating point]] resolution for plug-ins and [[64-bit]] floating point summing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.soundonsound.com/reviews/avid-hdx#para3|title=Avid HDX {{!}}|website=www.soundonsound.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==
Pro Tools was developed by [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] graduates Evan Brooks, who majored in [[electrical engineering]] and [[computer science]], and Peter Gotcher. The first incarnation of Pro Tools was introduced in 1984 under the brand name Sound Designer. At the time, the pair were creating and selling [[electronic drums|digital drum]] sound chips under their Digidrums label. Sound Designer was originally designed to edit sounds for the [[E-mu Emulator]] sampling keyboard, but it was rapidly ported to many other sampling keyboards, such as the [[Akai]] S900 and the [[Sequential Circuits Prophet 2000|Prophet 2000]]. Thanks to the universal file specification developed by Brooks, Sound Designer files could be transferred to and from one sampling keyboard to another keyboard made by a different manufacturer. 

This universal file specification, along with the printed source code to a 68000 assembly language interrupt driven [[MIDI]] driver, were distributed through [[Macintosh]] MIDI interface manufacturer Assimilation, which manufactured the first MIDI interface for the Mac in 1985. Macintosh Editor/librarian software development pioneers and visionaries, Beaverton Digital Systems, provided a dial-up service called MacMusic starting in 1985 which used 2400-[[baud]] modems and 100 MB of disk, and used [[Red Ryder (software)|Red Ryder Host]] on a 1 MB [[Macintosh Plus]], allowing users of Sound Designer to download and install the entire Emulator II sound library to other less expensive samplers. MacMusic allowed users worldwide to share sample libraries across different manufacturers platforms without copyright infringement. Beaverton Digital Systems President John Connolly already had several conversations with Evan Brooks in 1985, as he was listed as a contact for technical support for the Assimilation MIDI toolkit, and the current Apple operating system in 1985 did not have native MIDI communications drivers. One evening in 1986 at John Connolly's [[Beaverton, Oregon]] home, an alert was sent online from MacMusic requesting the system operator, and to Connolly's surprise it was Peter Gotcher, thanking him for providing such a revolutionary service and making Sound Designer a much more attractive program to buy, by leveraging both the universal file format and by developing the first online sample file download site in the world, many years before the [[World Wide Web]] use soared.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.emulatorarchive.com/SampleDesign/SDSoundDesigner/sdsounddesigner.html Sound Designer Page at the Emulator Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, Gotcher and Brooks discussed with [[E-mu Systems]] the possibility of integrating their renamed 'Sound Tools' software into the Emulator III. E-mu rejected this offer and the pair started Digidesign, with Gotcher as president and Brooks as lead engineer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eqmag.com/article/the-software-chronicles/Mar-06/19100 Evan Brooks, Digidesign] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004165207/http://www.eqmag.com/article/the-software-chronicles/Mar-06/19100 |date=2008-10-04 }}, EQ Magazine, Mar 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Sound Tools&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.me.com/protoolsman1/deprotoolsman/Geschiedenis_files/soundtools.jpg|title=iCloud|publisher=|accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; debuted on January 20, 1989 at [[NAMM]] (National Association of Music Merchandisers). At this stage Sound Tools was a simple computer-based stereo audio editor. Although the software had the possibility to do far more, it was limited by the hard drive technology, which was used to stream audio and allow for the [[non-destructive editing]] that Sound Tools offered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.namm.org/library/oral-history/evan-brooks|title=Library - NAMM.org|work=NAMM.org|accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first version of Pro Tools was launched in 1991, offering four tracks and selling for $6,000 USD. The core engine technology and much of the user interface was designed by and licensed from a small San Francisco company called OSC, known at the time for creating the first software-based digital multi-track recorder, called DECK, in 1990.&lt;ref name="wired212"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.12/osc.html|title=Wired 2.12: Consume the Minimum, Produce the Maximum|publisher=|accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; That software, manufactured by OSC but distributed by Digidesign, formed the platform upon which Pro Tools version 1 was built. The OSC designers and engineers responsible for that technology, Josh Rosen, Mats Myrberg and John Dalton, split from Digidesign in 1993 in order to focus on releasing lower-cost ($399)&lt;ref name="wired212"/&gt; multi-track software that would run on computers with no additional hardware.  The software was known circa mid-1990s as Session (for stereo-only audio cards) and Session 8 (for multi-channel audio interfaces). Although the original design remained largely the same, Digidesign continued to improve Pro Tools software and hardware, adding a visual [[MIDI sequencer]] and more tracks, with the system offering 16-bit, 44.1&amp;nbsp;kHz audio recording. In 1997, Pro Tools reached 24-bit, 48 tracks. It was at this point that the migration from more conventional analog studio technology to the Pro Tools platform took place within the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inG-VGagm_U|title=YouTube|publisher=|accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ricky Martin]]'s "[[Livin' la Vida Loca]]" (1999) was the first No. 1 single to be recorded, edited, and mixed fully within the Pro Tools environment, by [[Charles Dye]] and [[Desmond Child]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_recordin_la_vida/ |title=Recordin' "La Vida Loca |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604161013/http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_recordin_la_vida/ |archive-date=2011-06-04 |work=Mix Magazine, Nov 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Pro Tools was used for creating the audio for the video games ''[[DJ Hero]]'' and ''[[Guitar Hero]]'', using the modeling plug-in Eleven for the guitar sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://akwww2.digidesign.com/digizine/flashviewer/2009/winter/DZ_Win_Spr09.pdf |title=Unsung Guitar Heroes |format=PDF |work=Digizine Winter/Spring 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interface==
[[Image:protools9screen.png|thumb|Pro Tools 9 running on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]]]
Most of Pro Tools' basic functions can be controlled within Edit or Mix windows. The Edit window displays audio and [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface]] (MIDI) tracks, and provides graphical representation of the information recorded or imported. Here, audio can be edited in a [[Non-linear editing system|non-linear]], [[non-destructive editing|non-destructive]] fashion. MIDI information can also be manipulated. The Mix window displays each track's fader channel and allows for the adjustment of a channel's volume and pan, as well as being the usual place to insert plug-in effects and route audio to and from different outputs and inputs. The release of Pro Tools 8 introduced a MIDI edit window, which enables the user to manipulate MIDI data in either piano-roll or score windows. It also includes MIDI edit lanes so that the user can see note, velocity and other CC data in the same window. These additions took Pro Tools from the long standard 2 edit window approach to having 3 edit windows. Real-time effects processing and virtual instruments in Pro Tools are achieved through the use of plug-ins, which are either processed by the [[digital signal processing|DSP]] chips as DSP plug-ins, or the host computer as Native plug-ins. Additionally, out-of-time processing is available in the form of AudioSuite plug-ins, which also enables time-domain processing.

==Systems==
{{advert|section|date=May 2012}}
{{expert-subject|Pro Tools|section|date=February 2013}}

===HDX systems===
In October 2011 Avid introduced a new line of DSP accelerated cards, named HDX cards, along with version 10 of its Pro Tools software. The cards included DSP processors manufactured by Texas Instruments, operating with increased computational precision – 32-bit floating point versus the previous 24-bit fixed (in the older generation 56k chips made by Motorola). Benefits claimed for the new system included improved technical performance in terms of audio dynamic range, monitoring latency, and overall computational power, when compared to the older HD line. In its marketing Avid aimed the HDX system at customers requiring the highest and most consistent practically achievable levels of technical performance. The practical benefit to the user was the more reliable creation of large and complex productions typical of those demanded in modern music production. A key stated benefit was near-zero monitoring latency.

The "HD" product line was reorganised to include "HD|Native" (without DSP) and HDX. The HD|Native systems made use of the host system's CPU for all audio processing while retaining the augmented workflows and sound quality factors of Pro Tools HD. HDX's primary advantage over HD remained the considerably lower latency for all DSP reliant operations. As a result, in order to maintain the required consistency of performance, HDX products were specified with a fixed maximum number of "voices" (audio tracks). Up to three HDX cards could be installed on a single system, for a maximum of 768 total "voices" (audio channels).

While by comparison, native systems from all manufacturers including Avid may offer an apparently unlimited number of tracks / voices, every system necessarily has practical limits to what can usefully be achieved, depending on technical specification of the host computer, software configuration and user preferences. HDX systems accelerated digital signal processing for Avid's own AAX format plugins only. The company ended support for the older TDM technology for use with its HDX products. (TDM stood for [[Time-division multiplexing|Time Division Multiplexing]]; though it was sometimes known as Time Domain Multiplexing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pro Tools DigiRack Plug-Ins Guide: Version 5.0.1 for Macintosh and Windows|publisher=Digidesign, Inc.|accessdate=23 October 2013|url=http://akarchive.digidesign.com/support/docs/50/DigiRack_Plug-Ins_Guide501.pdf|page=18|format=PDF|year=2000|quote="time domain plug-ins"}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Avid advised users that Pro Tools 10 would be the final release for Pro Tools|HD Process and Accel systems, and that its TDM technology would be discontinued.

===HD systems===
Pro Tools HD and HDX systems represent the company's professional product line. They rely on dedicated chips that aid audio processing, in conjunction with rack-mounted interfaces, which handle outgoing and incoming audio, MIDI, and sync connections. With the introduction of Avid's HDX line, HD ("native") interfaces no longer feature [[digital signal processing|DSP]], and this feature has been reserved for HDX only. HD and HDX systems utilise proprietary cables to interconnect with external units. Older Pro Tools HD cards featured DSP chips from the Motorola 56k family. Newer HDX interfaces rely on DSP chips from Texas Instruments and have split facilities for managing track playback and signal processing operations. At launch Pro Tools HD cards were called HD Process cards. Approximately 2 years later, the HD Process cards were replaced by the HD Accel card, which was designed around a faster variant of the Motorola DSP chip and provided approximately twice the signal processing power per card. When Apple changed the expansion slot architecture of the G5 to PCI Express, Digidesign launched a line of PCIe HD Accel cards that both adopted the new card slot format and also slightly changed the combination of chips. There are TDM plug-ins that require the presence of Accel chips to run and therefore cannot run on the earlier non-Accel HD systems.

On October 6, 2010, Avid released Pro Tools HD Native, a lower cost PCIe card system designed for host-processing with fully functional HD software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avid.com/US/products/Pro-Tools-HD-native?intcmp=AV-HP-S2|title=Avid - Pro Tools - HD Native - Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) from Avid|publisher=|accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Native PCIe card has a FPGA chip to facilitate an upgradable option to the card over time. On November 4, 2010, Avid released Pro Tools 9, a lower-cost application that decoupled hardware from software. Among several new features, Pro Tools 9 has a new track feature named HEAT (Harmonically Enhanced Algorithm Technology), which is used for creating what many in the industry are calling [[Harmonically Enhanced Digital Audio (HEDA)|HEDA (Harmonically Enhanced Digital Audio)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avid.com/US/press-room/Avid-Unleashes-Pro-Tools-9 |title=Avid Unleashes Pro Tools 9 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204193730/http://www.avid.com/US/press-room/Avid-Unleashes-Pro-Tools-9 |archive-date=2010-12-04 |website=Avid.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When first available, Pro Tools systems relied exclusively on integral hard disks for storage and were thus limited to the storage options available on the Apple hardware platform. In 2002, AVID rebranded a proprietary [[Storage area network|SAN]] product called MediaNet and promoted it to Pro Tools users who were becoming aware of the benefits of network-based collaboration and workflows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.editorsguild.com/v2/magazine/Newsletter/MayJun02/tip_avid_unity.html "Avid's Unity MediaNet"], Editor's Guild Magazine, May 2002&lt;/ref&gt; MediaNet was based on WindowsNT and could only be administered using Windows-based tools. To date, neither Pro Tools HD Native nor Pro Tools 9 support commodity [[network attached storage]], and MediaNet remains Avid's only supported option for accessing storage over the network. There has been some positive experience with using remote storage with Pro Tools via iSCSI technology. A company from Netherlands, Ardis Technologies, produces a SAN solution based on iSCSI protocol, which is aimed primarily to the audio/video postproduction market. It is called DDP (Dynamic Drive Pool). It can use existing Gigabit Ethernet network and does not require additional hardware on the DAW side except Gigabit Ethernet adapter.

===LE systems===
The Pro Tools LE (Limited Edition) line is discontinued as of the release of Pro Tools 9. Pro Tools LE systems performed data processing on the host CPU. Purchasers were required to choose from a range of proprietary audio interfaces, one of which was required for all audio I/O (recording and playback). The hardware thus doubled as a copy-protection mechanism for the software, as the software did not function without the specialized Digidesign interface. The entry-level MBox range of interfaces connect via USB or Firewire 400. All have a stereo audio output, and include a small number of line and microphone inputs. The more powerful 003 (formerly 002) interfaces use FireWire and have significantly larger I/O abilities. The Eleven Rack, in addition to its many input options, includes in-box DSP processing via a FPGA chip offloads the Eleven guitar amp/speaker emulation and guitar effects plug-in processing to the interface, allowing those plug-ins to run without taxing the host system.

Pro Tools LE had a similar look and feel to Pro Tools HD, but had a smaller track count and a lower maximum sampling rate. Pro Tools LE also lacked many features such as the ability to export to MP3, SMPTE time code, Automatic Delay Compensation (ADC), ability to import [[Open Media Framework|OMF]] and [[Advanced Authoring Format|AAF]] files, DigiBase Pro, and multi-track Beat Detective. These features, along with higher track counts, could be accessed via the purchase of the "DV Toolkit" and "Music Production Toolkit" or "Complete Production Toolkit" upgrade packages. Under Pro Tools 9, these upgrades have changed and been combined to the "Complete Production Toolkit 2".

===9 system changes===
In 2010–11, Pro Tools upgraded Pro Tools LE with some of the features of HD and effectively merged it into one hardware-independent software package named Pro Tools Standard. Pro Tools 9 has no proprietary hardware requirement, allowing use of the software with any interface. It can operate using the internal sound card of a PC via the [[Audio Stream Input/Output]] (ASIO) driver and a Mac using [[Core Audio]]. Mac Core Audio also allows, for the first time, the use of aggregate devices, allowing the use of more than one interface at the same time. This can also be achieved on a PC by using the third party application [[ASIO4ALL]]. Pro Tools 9 also included a new keyboard shortcut for "New Playlist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonicscoop.com/2010/12/02/pro-tools-9-do-you-need-it-we-ask-the-early-adopters/|title=Pro Tools 9: Do You Need It? We Ask The Early Adopters - SonicScoop|publisher=|accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When operating on a machine containing one or more HD Core, Accel or Native cards, the software will run as Pro Tools HD 9, with the full Pro Tools HD feature set. In all other cases it will run as Pro Tools 9, with a smaller track count and a number of advanced features turned off. However, non-HD Pro Tools 9 users can also gain access to the full feature set with the Complete Production Toolkit 2. Pro Tools 9 also included as standard many features which on Pro Tools LE were only accessible via additional "Toolkit" upgrades. Pro Tools 9 uses [[iLok]] for copy-protection. Pro Tools 9 is the first version to have one 'unified' installer for the software, with the iLok licence determining, which elements of the software are unlocked.

===M-Powered systems===
[[M-Audio]], formerly Midiman, was acquired by [[Avid Technology]] in 2004–2005, and Digidesign soon released Pro Tools M-Powered, which brought Pro Tools LE functionality to a subset of M-Audio USB, FireWire and PCI interfaces. Pro Tools M-Powered uses an [[iLok]] license as copy protection and was formerly the only way to run Pro Tools without using Digidesign/Avid hardware.

===M-Powered Essential===
This is a scaled-down version of the M-Powered system. It was aimed at the starter consumer market, and offers very limited scope, with only 16 tracks, no third-party plug-ins and limited USB device support.

===SE===
Pro Tools SE is a stripped-down version of what used to be Pro Tools LE, also made for beginners. The software is sold in one of three bundles with a hardware unit for guitarists, keyboardists, and vocalists. It also comes with the M-Audio Fast Track and MobilePre USB audio interfaces except for the "Ultra" sub-series. &lt;!--The MobilePre (aka "dongle") may function with Pro Tools as well as Garageband. --&gt;There is no option to upgrade to the full version of Pro Tools from Pro Tools SE.

===Control surfaces===
Digidesign/Avid control surfaces attempt to bridge the gap between old-style analog desks and modern DAWs by providing physical controls for the Pro Tools software. These include the C|24, a 24-fader surface with 16 built-in pre-amps, and the ICON: Integrated Console Environment (consisting of user selectable fader count units D-Command, D-Control and their add-on fader banks and X-Mon monitoring system), which work alongside Pro Tools|HD or Ultimate. Latterly the Avid S6 control surface superseded the ICON as the flagship controller, though ICON systems remain in use worldwide, in mix studios and post production houses, and were the best selling medium/large format "console" of all time.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} VENUE, a similar system, was released for live-sound applications. The Command|8 is a smaller eight-fader control surface. Pro Tools compatible control surfaces have also been developed by other companies. For example, the [[Audient]] ASP2802 has integrated [[digital audio workstation|DAW]] control, and is compatible with Pro Tools as well as [[Logic Pro]] and [[Cubase]].&lt;ref name="SOS2802"&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.soundonsound.com/news?NewsID=12672 | title= Musikmesse 2010: Audient ASP 2802 (Video) | accessdate= 13 July 2010 | publisher= [[Sound on Sound]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It therefore provides an external analog mixing interface for the computer. In April 2010, Avid acquired Euphonix, a manufacturer of high quality control surfaces.

==Related products and services==
An official Pro Tools training curriculum and certification program, which includes courses in music and post production, was introduced by Digidesign in 2002. The curriculum is delivered by a number of schools and universities. The Music Production and DV toolkits increase the abilities of non-HD Pro Tools systems. Both increase the maximum number of tracks and highest possible sample rate to 96&amp;nbsp;kHz and include additional plug-ins. The LE-only DV tool kit adds feet and frames and timecode timelines and functionality.

==Advanced Instrument Research (AIR)==
{{see also|AIR Users Blog}}
In August 2005, [[Avid Technology|Avid]] acquired the German company Wizoo, formerly working mainly for [[Steinberg]] (Cubase, Nuendo) and developers of virtual instruments. They further announced the creation of Advanced Instrument Research (AIR), which meant Avid would be developing virtual instruments and plug-ins for use in Pro Tools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://airvirtualinstruments.blogspot.com/2009/01/interview-with-peter-gorges-head-of-air.html Interview with Peter Gorges of AIR] on Air Users Blog&lt;/ref&gt;

This also resulted in the landmark redevelopment of Pro Tools, versions 8 through 10. This relied heavily on the inclusion of AIR Virtual Instrument plug-ins to bring it closer to its competitor [[Logic Pro]]. Those included with Pro Tools Standard (called the Creative Collection) include:

* Structure FREE, a sample playback instrument.
* Boom, a drum machine
* Xpand2, a multi-timbral sample-playback/synthesis plug-in
* DB33, a [[Hammond Organ]] emulator
* Vacuum, a monophonic vintage synth.
* Mini Grand, Piano.

AIR also contributes reverbs, dynamics, modulation and other effects as part of the Pro Tools, all of these work in native format only.

Some of the additional virtual instruments for Pro Tools that AIR has created include:

* Hybrid, a high definition Synthesizer
* Velvet, vintage electric piano
* Transfuser, real-time loop, phrase and groove creator

In July 2012, [[inMusic Brands]], parent company of brands such as [[Akai Professional]] and [[Alesis]], announced its acquisition of AIR from Avid,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.synthtopia.com/content/2012/07/02/avid-downsizes-sells-m-audio-to-inmusic/ | title= Avid Downsizes, Sells M-Audio To inMusic | accessdate= 17 October 2012 | publisher= Synthtopia}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of a larger acquisition that included Avid's consumer audio products and the [[M-Audio]] brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url= http://www.avid.com/US/press-room/Avid-Divests-Consumer-Businesses-and-Streamlines-Operations | title= Avid Divests Consumer Businesses and Streamlines Operations | accessdate= 17 October 2012 | publisher= Avid | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121002214830/http://www.avid.com/US/press-room/Avid-Divests-Consumer-Businesses-and-Streamlines-Operations | archivedate= 2 October 2012 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.musicradar.com/news/tech/avid-sells-m-audio-551367 | title= Avid sells M-Audio | accessdate= 18 October 2012 | publisher= MusicRadar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:7sigma RainGarden 66.JPG|thumb|300px|Business parking lot that drains to a rain garden. The curb retains the asphalt pavement, yet lets water flow off the edges.]]

One of the wide variety of soil-absorption/filter systems, a '''rain garden''', also called a '''stormwater garden''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Landscape Planning: Environmental Application 5th Edition|last=William|first=Marsh|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=237}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a designed depression storage or a planted hole that allows [[rainwater]] [[Surface runoff|runoff]] from [[Impervious surface|impervious]] [[urban area]]s, like roofs, driveways, walkways, parking lots, and compacted lawn areas, the opportunity to be absorbed. The primary purpose of a rain garden is to improve water quality in nearby bodies of water and to ensure that rainwater becomes available for plants as [[groundwater]] rather than being sent through [[stormwater]] drains straight out to sea. In fact, it can actually reduce rain runoff by allowing stormwater to soak into the ground (as opposed to flowing into [[storm drain]]s and [[surface water]]s which causes [[erosion]], [[water pollution]], [[flooding]], and diminished groundwater)&lt;ref name=uri&gt;

The plants—a selection of [[wetland]] edge vegetation, such as [[wildflower]]s, [[Cyperaceae|sedges]], [[Juncaceae|rushes]], [[fern]]s, [[shrub]]s and small [[tree]]s—take up excess water flowing into the rain garden. Water filters through soil layers before entering the groundwater system. Deep plant roots also create additional channels for stormwater to filter into the ground. Root systems enhance [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]], maintain or even augment soil permeability, provide moisture redistribution, and sustain diverse microbial populations involved in [[Biofilter|biofiltration]].&lt;ref name=wolverton&gt;B.C.

Vol. XXXI, pp. 79-89.&lt;/ref&gt; Microbial populations feed off plant root secretions and break down carbon (such as in mulch or desiccated plant roots) to aggregate soil particles which increases infiltration rates. Also, through the process of [[transpiration]], rain garden plants return [[water vapor]] to the [[atmosphere]].&lt;ref name=dussaillant&gt;A. Dussaillant, Ph.D., et al.

Vol. 5, pp. 173-179.&lt;/ref&gt;

A more wide-ranging definition covers all the possible elements that can be used to capture, channel, divert, and make the most of the natural rain and snow that falls on a property. Thus, the whole garden can become a rain garden, and each component of the whole can become a small-scale rain garden in itself.

==Restoring the water cycle and mitigating urbanization==
{{see|Urbanization}}
In developed areas, natural [[Depression (geology)|depressions]] where [[storm water]] would pool are filled in. The surface of the ground is often [[Regrading|leveled]] or paved. Storm water is directed into [[storm drain]]s which often may cause overflows of [[combined sewer]] systems or poisoning, erosion or flooding of waterways receiving the storm water runoff.&lt;ref name=Kuichling&gt;Kuichling, E. 1889. "The relation between the rainfall and the discharge of sewers in populous districts." ''Trans. Am. Soc. Civ. Eng.'' 20, 1–60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Leopold &gt;Leopold, L. B. 1968.

Morgan (eds), ''Effects of Watershed Changes on Streamflow.'' University of Texas Press, Austin and London.&lt;/ref&gt; Redirected storm water is often warmer than the [[groundwater]] normally feeding a stream, and has been linked to upset in some aquatic ecosystems primarily through the reduction of [[Oxygen saturation|dissolved oxygen]] (DO). Storm water runoff is also a source of a wide variety of pollutants washed off hard or compacted surfaces during rain events. These pollutants include [[volatile organic compounds]], [[pesticides]], [[herbicides]], [[hydrocarbons]] and [[trace metals]]&lt;ref name= Novotny&gt;Novotny, V. and Olem, H. 1994. "Water Quality: Prevention, Identification, and Management of Diffuse Pollution." Van Nostrand Reinhold, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Rain gardens are designed to capture the initial flow of storm water and reduce the accumulation of toxins flowing directly into natural waterways through ground filtration. They also reduce energy consumption. For example, "the cumulative storage capacity of these rain gardens exceeds a conventional stormwater's system's by 10 times."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Strassberg |first=Valerie |author2=Brad Lancaster |title=Fighting water with water: Behavioral change versus climate change |journal=American Water Works Association |date=June 2011 |volume=103 |issue=6 |pages=59 |url=http://www.harvestingrainwater.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/05/Strassberg-Lancaster-AWWA-June-2011.pdf |accessdate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Science Foundation]], the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], and a number of research institutions are presently studying the impact of augmenting rain gardens with materials capable of capture or [[chemical reduction]] of the pollutants to benign compounds.

[[File:SUNY-ESF-rain-garden-2014-b.jpg|thumb|left|Rain garden, [[State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry|SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry]], Syracuse, New York]]
Rain gardens are often located near a building's roof drainpipe (with or without [[rainwater tank]]s). Most rain gardens are designed to be an endpoint of drainage with a capacity to percolate all incoming water through a series of soil or gravel layers beneath the surface plantings. A [[French drain]] may be used to direct a portion of the rainwater to an overflow location for heavier rain events. By reducing peak stormwater discharge, rain gardens extend hydraulic lag time and somewhat mimic the natural [[water cycle]] displaced by [[urban development]] and allow for [[groundwater]] recharge. While rain gardens always allow for restored groundwater recharge, and reduced stormwater volumes, they may also increase [[Water pollution|pollution]] unless [[Environmental remediation|remediation]] materials are included in the design of the filtration layers.&lt;ref name= Dietz&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s11270-005-8266-8 | last1 =  Dietz | first1 = Michael E. | first2 = John C. | last2 = Clausen | year = 2005 | title = A Field Evaluation of Raingarden Flow and Pollutant Treatment | journal = Water, Air, &amp; Soil Pollution | volume = 167 | issue = 1–4 | pages = 123–138 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary challenge of rain garden design centers on calculating the types of pollutants and the acceptable loads of pollutants the rain garden's filtration system can handle during storm-water events. This challenge is specifically acute when a rain event occurs after a longer dry period. The initial storm water is often highly contaminated with the accumulated pollutants from dry periods. Rain garden designers have previously focused on finding robust [[native plants]] and encouraging adequate biofiltration, but recently have begun augmenting filtration layers with media specifically suited to chemically reduce [[redox]] of incoming pollutant streams.

Rain gardens are beneficial for many reasons: improve water quality by filtering runoff, provide localized [[flood control]], are aesthetically pleasing, and provide interesting planting opportunities. They also encourage wildlife and [[biodiversity]], tie together buildings and their surrounding environments in attractive and environmentally advantageous ways, and provide significant partial solutions to important environmental problems that affect us all.

A rain garden provides a way to use and optimize any rain that falls, reducing or avoiding the need for [[irrigation]]. They allow a household or building to deal with excessive rainwater runoff without burdening the public storm water systems. Rain gardens differ from retention basins, in that the water will infiltrate the ground within a day or two. This creates the advantage that the rain garden does not allow [[mosquito]]es to breed. Compost, rather than soil, has better effects on filtering groundwater and rainwater. Compact lawn soil cannot harbor groundwater nearly as well, because the water simply flows off.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==History==
The first rain gardens were created to mimic the natural water retention areas that occurred before development of an area. The rain gardens for residential use were developed in 1990 in [[Prince George's County, Maryland]], when Dick Brinker, a developer building a new housing [[Subdivision (land)|subdivision]] had the idea to replace the traditional [[Best management practice for water pollution|best management practices]] (BMP) pond with a [[bioretention]] area. He approached Larry Coffman, an environmental engineer and the county's Associate Director for Programs and Planning in the Department of Environmental Resources, with the idea.&lt;ref name=urbrun&gt;{{cite magazine |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Urban Runoff |url=http://water.epa.gov/polwaste/nps/archives/upload/42issue.pdf |magazine=Nonpoint Source News-Notes |issue=42 |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |date=August 1995 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707213649/http://water.epa.gov/polwaste/nps/archives/upload/42issue.pdf |archive-date=2012-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was the extensive use of rain gardens in Somerset, a residential subdivision which has a {{convert|300|–|400|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} rain garden on each house's property.&lt;ref name="marcom"&gt;''Wisconsin Natural Resources'' (magazine). [http://dnr.wi.gov/wnrmag/html/supps/2003/feb03/run.htm#one “Rain Gardens Made One Maryland Community Famous.”] February 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; This system proved to be highly cost-effective. Instead of a system of [[Curb (road)|curbs]], [[sidewalk]]s, and [[Street gutter|gutters]], which would have cost nearly $400,000, the planted drainage swales cost $100,000 to install.&lt;ref name=urbrun/&gt; This was also much more cost effective than building BMP ponds that could handle 2-, 10-, and 100-year storm events.&lt;ref name=urbrun/&gt; Flow monitoring done in later years showed that the rain gardens have resulted in a 75–80% reduction in stormwater runoff during a regular rainfall event.&lt;ref name=marcom/&gt;

This is also referred to as [[Water Sensitive Urban Design]] (WSUD) in Australia, [[Sustainable drainage system|Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems or SUDS]] in the United Kingdom, and [[Low-impact development (Canada/US)|low impact development]] (LID) in the United States, and is cited by the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/soakuptherain/rain-gardens |title=Rain Gardens |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016-04-28 |website=Soak Up the Rain |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some ''de facto'' rain gardens predate their recognition by professionals as a significant LID tool. Any shallow garden depression implemented to capture and retain rain water within the garden so as to drain adjacent land without running off a property is at conception a rain garden—particularly if vegetation is maintained with recognition of its role in this function. Vegetated roadside [[Swale (geographical feature)|swales]], now promoted as “[[bioswale]]s”, remain the conventional drainage system in many parts of the world from long before extensive networks of concrete sewers became the conventional engineering practice in the industrialized world.

What is new about such technology is the emerging rigor of increasingly quantitative understanding of how such tools may make [[sustainable development]] possible. This is as true for wealthy developed communities retrofitting [[bioretention]] into built stormwater management systems, as for developing communities seeking a faster and more sustainable development path.

==Characteristics==
[[File:2006NeighborsNewRG2.JPG|thumb|A home rain garden recently planted]]
A rain garden requires an area where water can collect and [[Infiltration (hydrology)|infiltrate]], and plants to maintain infiltration rates, diverse microbe communities, and water holding capacity. This way the rain garden may contribute to urban habitats for native [[Butterfly|butterflies]], [[Bird|birds]], and beneficial [[Insect|insects]]. [[Transpiration]] by growing plants accelerates soil drying between storms. This includes any plant extending roots to the garden area.

Simply adjusting the landscape so that downspouts and paved surfaces drain into existing gardens may be all that is needed because the soil has been well loosened and plants are well established. However, many plants do not tolerate saturated roots for long and often more water runs off one's roof than people realize. Thus, rain garden plants are then selected to match the situation after the required location and storage capacity of the garden area are determined.

===Soil and drainage===
When an area's soils are not [[Permeability (fluid)|permeable]] enough to allow water to drain and filter properly, the soil should be replaced and an underdrain installed. This bioretention mixture should typically contain 60% [[sand]], 20% [[compost]], and 20% [[topsoil]], and there is a current trend to replace compost with [[biochar]]. The former non-permeable soil needs to be removed and replaced. The sandy soil (bioretention) mixture cannot be combined with a surrounding soil that does not have high sand content because the clay particles will settle in between the sand particles and form a concrete-like substance, according to a 1983 study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hriresearch.org/Docs/Publications/JEH/JEH_1983/JEH_1983_1_3/JEH%201-3-77-80.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212091532/http://www.hriresearch.org/Docs/Publications/JEH/JEH_1983/JEH_1983_1_3/JEH%201-3-77-80.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A five-year study by the [[U.S. Geological Survey]] indicates that rain gardens in urban clay soils can be effective without the use of underdrains or replacement of native soils with the bioretention mix. But, it also indicates that pre-installation infiltration rates should be at least .25 in/hour. Type D soils will require an underdrain paired with the sandy soil mix in order to drain properly.&lt;ref&gt;Sustainable City Network, Dubuque, IA (2011-02-21).[http://www.sustainablecitynetwork.com/topic_channels/water/article_b65fe518-3de0-11e0-82aa-00127992bc8b.html "USGS: Rain Gardens Work Regardless of Soil Conditions."]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes a [[drywell]] with a series of gravel layers near the lowest spot in the rain garden will help facilitate percolation. However, a drywell placed at the lowest spot can become clogged with silt prematurely turning the garden into an [[infiltration basin]] defeating its purpose. [[Depression-focused recharge]] of polluted water into wells poses a serious threat and should be avoided. Similarly plans to install a rain garden near a septic system should be reviewed by a qualified engineer. The more polluted the water, the longer it must be retained in the soil for purification. This is often achieved by installing several smaller rain garden basins with soil deeper than the seasonal high [[water table]]. In some cases lined [[bioretention]] cells with [[subsurface drainage]] are used to retain smaller amounts of water and filter larger amounts without letting water percolate as quickly.

Rain gardens are at times confused with [[bioswale]]s. [[Swale (geographical feature)|Swales]] slope to a destination, while rain gardens do not; however, a bioswale may end with a rain garden. Drainage ditches may be handled like bioswales and even include rain gardens in series, saving time and money on maintenance. Part of a garden that nearly always has standing water is a [[water garden]], [[wetland]], or pond, and not a rain garden. Using the proper terminology ensures that the proper methods are used to achieve the desired results.

===Plants===
Although specific plants are selected and designed for respective soils and climates,&lt;ref name="dussa"&gt;Dussaillant et al. [http://cedb.asce.org/cgi/WWWdisplay.cgi?140904] Journal of Hydrologic Engineering&lt;/ref&gt; plants that can tolerate both saturated and dry soil are typically used for the rain garden. They need to have minimal maintenance to survive, and be compatible with adjacent land use.

Native and adapted plants are the examples of such plants that are generally used. They are more tolerant of the local climate, soil, and water conditions; have deep and variable root systems for enhanced water infiltration and drought tolerance; habitat value and diversity for local ecological communities; and overall sustainability once established. There can be trade-offs associated with using native plants, including lack of availability for some species, late spring emergence, short blooming season, and relatively slow establishment.

Trees under power lines, or that up-heave sidewalks when soils become moist, or whose roots seek out and clog drainage tiles can cause expensive damage. Trees generally contribute most when located close enough to tap moisture in the rain garden depression, yet do not excessively shade the garden. That said, shading open surface waters can reduce excessive heating of habitat. Plants tolerate inundation by warm water for less time because heat drives out [[Oxygen saturation|dissolved oxygen]], thus a plant tolerant of early spring flooding may not survive summer inundation.

Bamboo is another plant that works particularly well since it can clean water 27.6% better than domestic plants like grass or clovers. Rice, although it is hard to grow and maintain, works even better.

* [[Islington Council|Islington London Borough Council]] commissioned sustainable drainage consultants Robert Bray Associates to design a pilot rain garden in the Ashby Grove development which was completed in 2011.  This raingarden is fed from a typical modest domestic roof catchment area of 30m² and is designed to demonstrate how simple and cost effective domestic rain gardens are to install.  Monitoring apparatus was built into the design to allow Middlesex University to monitor water volumes, water quality and soil moisture content.  The rain garden basin is 300mm deep and has a storage capacity of 2.17m³ which is just over the volume required to store runoff from the roof catchment in a 1 in 100 storm plus 30% allowance for climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islington.gov.uk/publicrecords/library/Environmental-protection/Information/Guidance/2011-2012/(2012-03-03)-Ashby-Grove-Raingarden-SUDS-Design-Statement.pdf|title=Robert Bray Associates Design Statement - Islington Council Public Records|publisher=Islington Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.susdrain.org/case-studies/case_studies/ashby_grove_residential_retrofit_rain_garden_london.html|title=Ashby Grove residential retrofit rain garden, London|publisher=Susdrain|accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The 12,000 rain garden campaign for Puget Sound is coordinating efforts to build 12,000 rain gardens in the Puget Sound Basin of Western Washington by 2016. The 12,000 rain gardens website provides information and resources for the general public, landscape professionals, municipal staff, and decision makers. By providing access to the best current guidance, easy-to-use materials, and a network of trained "Rain Garden Mentor" Master Gardeners, this campaign seeks to capture and cleanse over 200 Million gallons of polluted runoff each year, and thereby significantly improve Puget Sound's water quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.12000raingardens.org|title=12,000 Rain Gardens - in Puget Sound|website=www.12000raingardens.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Maplewood, Minnesota|Maplewood]], [[Minnesota]] has implemented a policy of encouraging residents to install rain gardens. Many neighborhoods had swales added to each property, but installation of a garden at the swale was voluntary. The project was a partnership between the City of Maplewood, [[University of Minnesota]] Department of Landscape Architecture, and the Ramsey Washington Metro Watershed District. A focus group was held with residents and published so that other communities could use it as a resource when planning their own rain garden projects.&lt;!-- City of Maplewood - broken link reference --&gt;
* In [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]], a prototype project, used to develop a plan for the entire city, was constructed in 2003. Called ''SEA Street,'' for Street Edge Alternatives, it was a drastic facelift of a residential street. The street was changed from a typical linear path to a gentle curve, narrowed, with large rain gardens placed along most of the length of the street. The street has 11% less impervious surface than a regular street. There are 100 evergreen trees and 1100 shrubs along this 3-block stretch of road, and a 2-year study found that the amount of stormwater which leaves the street has been reduced by 99%.&lt;ref&gt;City of Seattle, Washington.

* Dr. Allen P. Davis is an environment and civil engineering professor at in University of Maryland, College Park. For the past 20 years, Davis and his team have been studying the effectiveness of rain gardens. For their research, they constructed two rain gardens on campus near the Anacostia River watershed in the Fall of 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/rwqcb2/water_issues/programs/stormwater/muni/mrp/Rain%20Garden%20Quality%2004-11.pdf|title=WATER QUALITY IMPROVEMENT USING RAIN GARDENS: UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND STUDIES|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the runoff from the University of Maryland campus, a member of the Anacostia Watershed Restoration Partnership, ends up in the Anacostia River feeding into the Chesapeake Bay. This research finds rain gardens to be a very effective method of water capture and filtration, encouraging others in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed to implement rain gardens. 
** Davis' research showed that rain gardens aid in the capturing and bio-degradation of pollutants such as suspended solids, bacteria, metals, oil, and grease. 
** Water quality analyzed at the University of Maryland showed a significant increase in water clarity after rain garden filtration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.anacostia.net/AWSC/documents/raingarden_pylon_2.pdf|title=Rain Garden Pylon|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Socialist Unity Network''' was a small network of the [[far-left]] in the [[United Kingdom]] which was not affiliated with any single [[political party]]. It grew out of the [[Socialist Alliance (England)|Socialist Alliance]] (SA) in England, and was initiated by several non-aligned members of the SA executive in March 2004.

Members of the network were supporters of [[Respect - The Unity Coalition]] and other left electoral initiatives including the [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]]. The main aspect of the network was its now defunct website, which had regularly updated articles from a wide range of socialist  perspectives on issues including the possibilities of creating socialist unity.

==History==
The network was formed in March 2004 by several non-aligned members of the Socialist Alliance in England, and grew to include left-wing activists from a range of political parties and campaigning organisations, and those with no party affiliation. It was centrally involved in the debates around the winding down of the Socialist Alliance and the formation of Respect. It produced its own leaflets on occasions and in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 General Election]] some members of the network stood as "Socialist Unity" candidates, providing a banner under which independent socialists could choose to stand, as part of the [[Socialist Green Unity Coalition]], a coalition with the Socialist Party.

Socialist Unity candidates stood again in the 2006 council elections, gaining over 5% of the vote in Swindon, and over 10% in Hackney. The network also produced a 2005 election guide with ''[[Red Pepper (magazine)|Red Pepper]]'' magazine.

Leading members included Jim Jepps (later a Green Party activist), Declan O'Neill, Andy Newman (later a Labour Party member),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/profile/andy-newman Andy Newman &amp;#124; The Guardian] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420115503/http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/andy-newman |date=April 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Matthew Caygill, John Nicholson, Martin Wicks (of Swindon Trades Council), Pete Green, Nick Bird, Salman Shaheen (journalist, and co-editor of Third Estate blog), Reuben Rosenberg (journalist, and co-editor of Third Estate blog) and Tawfiq Chahboune.

== Core beliefs ==
The "who we are" section on the socialist unity network webpage stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Socialist Unity Network originated in the Socialist Alliance. It is not a political group conceived to add to the competition between the many socialist organisations which already exist. It is a network of activists which campaigns for the widest practical collaboration of left groups and movements resisting the attacks of the Blair government.

In England the left has failed to make the break with the sectarian legacy that has dogged the "far left" for so long. Such divisions undermine our ability to build a fightback against the Blair government.

The Socialist Unity Network therefore believes that, in the interests of building resistance and striving to create the conditions in which a socialist alternative to New Labour can emerge, it is necessary to strive to develop [[collaborative method]]s of working as widely as possible. This is similar to the process that led to the formation of the SSP in Scotland, which was the result of a number of years of common work and discussion which enabled previously competing and sometimes hostile organisations to overcome old antagonisms and to develop greater political agreement.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Sonia M. Altizer''' (born 1970) is a Professor and Associate Dean of Academic Affairs and the Athletic Association Professor of [[Ecology]] in the [[University of Georgia]], [[Odum School of Ecology]].&lt;ref name=uga&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecology.uga.edu/facultyMember.php?Altizer-1/|title=Odum School of Ecology|accessdate=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ocone /&gt;

==Early life==
Altizer was born as the daughter of Jim and Chris Altizer of [[Watkinsville, Georgia]].&lt;ref name=ocone&gt;{{cite news|title=Sonia Altizer named UGA Athletic Association Professor in Ecology|url=http://www.oconeeenterprise.com/news/article_abb49ae0-4efe-11e4-b97e-c375eeb85f2b.html|accessdate=1 March 2015|agency=The Ocone Enterprise|publisher=The Ocone Enterprise|date=October 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her passion for [[biology]] and the natural world began when she received a gift of a [[microscope]] and a grown-your-own-butterflies kit on her twelfth birthday.&lt;ref name=tedxuga&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tedxuga.com/sonia-altizer/|accessdate=28 February 2015|title=Ted x UGA|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150228001609/http://tedxuga.com/sonia-altizer/|archivedate=28 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Altizer received a B.S. from [[Duke University]] in 1992 and a [[Ph.D.]] from the [[University of Minnesota]] and in 1998. She also did a postdoctoral work at [[Princeton University]] and [[Cornell University]].&lt;ref name=uga /&gt;

==Career==
For 20 years since a graduate student of the University of Minnesota, Altizer traveled the world to study [[monarch butterfly]] migration, ecology, and interactions with a [[protozoan]] [[parasite]]. She has researched how [[seasonal]] [[Lepidoptera migration|migration]] of these butterflies affects parasite transmission, and also developed collaborative databases of mammalian infectious diseases, on host behavior, ecology, and life history interact with global-scale patterns of [[parasitism]]. She also focused her research on songbird-pathogen dynamics, including studies of house finch [[conjunctivitis]], [[West Nile virus]], and [[salmonellosis]]. Altizer has published several publications and she recently co-edited a book that would be published in 2015, titled Monarchs in a Changing World: Biology and Conservation of an Iconic Insect. She also and participated in high-level task forces dedicated to monarch butterfly conservation. A citizen science project called Monarch Health is run by her students at University of Georgia, which is now the 8th year. There are hundreds of volunteers across [[North America]] in sampling wild monarchs for a debiliating disease.&lt;ref name=tedxuga /&gt;

==Research areas==
Altizer's research interests are ecology of [[infectious diseases]] in natural populations, evolution of host resistance and [[parasite virulence]], insect ecology and [[evolution]], [[animal migration]]s, and [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] change and infectious disease dynamics.&lt;ref name=ucdavis&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entomology.ucdavis.edu/News/Sonia_Altizer__Migratory_Immunity__Parasite_Infection,_Host_Defense_and_Fitness_Costs_in_Monarch_Butterflies/|title=UC Davis Sonia Altizer|accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
When Altizer is not on campus or traveling for work, she rides on her horse in rural Watkinsville with her husband, with whom she has one son.&lt;ref name=tedxuga /&gt;

'''Stellar triangulation''' is a method of [[geodesy]] which uses cosmic instead of terrestrial targets. It was first done by the Finnish geodesist [[Yrjö Väisälä|Väisälä]] in 1959, who made [[astrometric]] photographs of the sky at two stations together with a [[balloon]] probe between them.

Even this first step showed the potential of the method, because Väisälä got the azimuth between [[Helsinki]] and [[Turku]] (a distance of 150&amp;nbsp;km) with an accuracy of 1″. Soon the method was successfully tested by [[External ballistics|ballistic]] rockets and for some special satellites. Adequate [[computer program]]s were written for
* the astrometric reduction of the photographic plates,
* the [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of the "observation planes" containing the stations and the targets,
* and the adjustment of stellar-terrestric networks with [[Data redundancy|redundancy]].

The advantage of stellar triangulation is the possibility to cross far distances (terrestrial observations are restricted to approx. 30&amp;nbsp;km, and even in high mountains to 60&amp;nbsp;km), and the independency of the Earth's gravity field. The results are [[azimuth]]s between the stations in the [[stellar-inertial navigation system]], despite of no direct [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]].

In 1960 the first appropriate [[space probe]] was launched: [[Project Echo]], a 30&amp;nbsp;m diameter [[balloon satellite]]. By then the whole of [[Western Europe]] could be linked together geodetically with accuracies 2–10 times better than by classical [[triangulation]].

During the late 1960s a global project was begun by [[H.H. Schmid]] (Switzerland) to connect 45 stations all over the continents, with distances of 3000–5000&amp;nbsp;km. It was finished in 1974 by precise reduction of some 3000 stellar plates and network adjustment of 46 stations (2 additional ones in [[Germany]] and the Pacific, but without the areas of [[Russia]] and [[China]]). The mean accuracy was between ±5&amp;nbsp;m (Europe, USA) and 7–10&amp;nbsp;m (Africa, Antarctica), depending of weather and infrastructure conditions. Combined with [[Doppler effect|Doppler]] measurements the global accuracy was even 3&amp;nbsp;m. This is more than 20 times better than previously, because the [[Gravitational field|gravity field]] up to 1974 couldn't be calculated better than 100 meters between distant [[continent]]s.

The use of [[star]]s as a reference system was expanded in the 70s and early 80s for continental networks, but then the [[laser]] and [[electronics|electronic]] measurements became better than 2&amp;nbsp;m and could be carried out automatically. Nowadays some similar techniques are carried out by [[interferometry]] with very distant radio [[quasar]]s instead of optical satellite &amp; star observations. The geodetic connection of [[radio telescope]]s is now possible up to mm–cm precision as published periodically by the [[International Valuation Standards|IVS]] community. This global project group was founded in 2000 by Harald Schuh (Munich/TU Vienna) and some dozen research projects worldwide, and is now a permanent service of [[International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics|IUGG]] and [[International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service|IERS]]. 

The photographic observations as done 1959–1985 are irrelevant now because of their expense, but lead to some [[renaissance]] by electro-optical techniques like [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9707">'''Thermo-mechanical fatigue''' (short '''TMF''') is the overlay of a cyclical mechanical loading, that leads to [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]] of a material, with a cyclical thermal loading. Thermo-mechanical fatigue is an important point that needs to be considered, when constructing turbine engines or gas turbines.

==Failure Mechanisms==
There are three mechanisms acting in thermo-mechanical fatigue
*'''[[Creep (deformation)|Creep]]''' is the flow of material at high temperatures
*'''[[Fatigue (material)|Fatigue]]''' is crack growth and propagation due to repeated loading
*'''Oxidation''' is a change in the chemical composition of the material due to environmental factors. The oxidized material is more brittle and prone to crack creation.

Each factor has more or less of an effect depending on the parameters of loading. In phase (IP) thermo-mechanical loading (when the temperature and load increase at the same time) is dominated by creep. The combination of high temperature and high stress is the ideal condition for creep. The heated material flows more easily in tension, but cools and stiffens under compression. Out of phase (OP) thermo-mechanical loading is dominated by the effects of oxidation and fatigue. Oxidation weakens the surface of the material, creating flaws and seeds for crack propagation. As the crack propagates, the newly exposed crack surface then oxidizes, weakening the material further and enabling the crack to extend. A third case occurs in OP TMF loading when the stress difference is much greater than the temperature difference. Fatigue alone is the driving cause of failure in this case, causing the material to fail before oxidation can have much of an effect.&lt;ref&gt;Nagesha, A et al. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.msea.2010.05.082 "A comparative study of isothermal and thermomechanical fatigue on type 316L(N) austenitic stainless steel"] '''Materials Science and Engineering: A''', 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

TMF still is not fully understood. There are many different models to attempt to predict the behavior and life of materials undergoing TMF loading. The two models presented below take different approaches.

==Models of Thermo-Mechanical Fatigue==
There are many different models that have been developed in an attempt to understand and explain TMF. This page will address the two broadest approaches, constitutive and phenomenological models. Constitutive models utilize the current understanding of the microstructure of materials and failure mechanisms. These models tend to be more complex, as they try to incorporate everything we know about how the materials fail. These types of models are becoming more popular recently as improved imaging technology has allowed for a better understanding of failure mechanisms. Phenomenological models are based purely on the observed behavior of materials. They treat the exact mechanism of failure as a sort of "black box". Temperature and loading conditions are input, and the result is the fatigue life. These models try to fit some equation to match the trends found between different inputs and outputs.

===Damage Accumulation Model===
The damage accumulation model is a constitutive model of TMF. It adds together the damage from the three failure mechanisms of fatigue, creep, and oxidation.

&lt;math&gt; \frac {1} {N_f} = \frac {1} {N_f^{fatigue}} + \frac {1} {N_f^{oxidation}} + \frac {1} {N_f^{creep}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;N_f &lt;/math&gt; is the fatigue life of the material, that is, the number of loading cycles until failure. The fatigue life for each failure mechanism is calculated individually and combined to find the total fatigue life of the specimen.&lt;ref&gt;Changan, Chai et al. [http://www.tms.org/pubs/journals/JOM/9904/Cai/Cai-9904.htm "Recent Developments in the Thermomechanical Fatigue Life Prediction of Superalloys"], '''JOM''', April 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.efatigue.com/hightemp/background/tmf.html "Thermo Mechanical Technical Background"]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fatigue====
The life from fatigue is calculated for isothermal loading conditions. It is dominated by the strain applied to the specimen.

&lt;math&gt; \frac {\Delta \epsilon_m} {2} = C(2N_f^{fatigue})^d &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; are material constants found through isothermal testing. Note that this term does not account for temperature effects. The effects of temperature are treated in the oxidation and creep terms..

====Oxidation====
The life from oxidation is affected by temperature and cycle time.

&lt;math&gt; \frac {1} {N_f^{oxidation}} = \left(\frac {h_{cr}\delta_0} {B\Phi^{oxidation}K_p^{eff}}\right)^{\frac {-1} {\beta}} \frac {2(\Delta \dot{\epsilon_m})^{\frac {2} {\beta} +1}} {\epsilon^{1-\alpha / \beta}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; K_p^{eff} = \frac {1} {t_c} \int_0^t D_0 exp \left(\frac {-Q} {RT(t)} \right) dt&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt; \Phi^{oxidation} = \frac {1} {t_c} \int_0^t exp \left[-\frac {1} {2} \left(\frac{(\dot{\epsilon_{th}} / \dot{\epsilon_m}) + 1} {\dot{\zeta}^{oxidation}} \right)^2 \right] dt&lt;/math&gt;

Parameters are found by comparing fatigue tests done in air and in an environment with no oxygen (vacuum or argon). Under these testing conditions, it has been found that the effects of oxidation can reduce the fatigue life of a specimen by a whole order of magnitude. Higher temperatures greatly increase the amount of damage from environmental factors.&lt;ref&gt;Heckel, T. K. et al. [http://www.springerlink.com/content/7232j3t772580465/fulltext.html "Thermomechanical Fatigue of the TiAl Intermetallic Alloy TNB-V2"] '''Experimental Mechanics''', 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

====Creep====
&lt;math&gt; D^{creep} = \Phi^{creep} \int_0^t Ae^{(-\Delta H/RT(t))} \left(\frac {\alpha_1 \bar{\sigma} + \alpha_2 \sigma_H} {K} \right)^m dt &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Phi^{creep} = \frac {1} {t_c} \int_0^t exp \left[ -\frac {1}{2} \left( \frac {(\dot{\epsilon_{th}}/ \dot{\epsilon_m})-1} {\dot{\zeta}^{creep}} \right)^2 \right] dt&lt;/math&gt;

====Benefit====
The damage accumulation model is one of the most in-depth and accurate models for TMF. It accounts for the effects of each failure mechanism.

====Drawback====
The damage accumulation model is also one of the most complex models for TMF. There are several material parameters that must be found through extensive testing.&lt;ref&gt;Minichmayr, Robert et al. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V35-4NCJCRP-2&amp;_user=571676&amp;_coverDate=02%2F29%2F2008&amp;_alid=1572321743&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_origin=search&amp;_zone=rslt_list_item&amp;_cdi=5721&amp;_sort=r&amp;_st=13&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_ct=1&amp;_acct=C000029040&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=571676&amp;md5=be6d57b6fac5d812e66d17e3afabb53b&amp;searchtype=a "Thermo-mechanical fatigue life assessment of aluminum components using the damage rate model of Sehitoglu"] '''International Journal of Fatigue''', 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strain-Rate Partitioning===
Strain-rate partitioning is a phenomenological model of thermo-mechanical fatigue. It is based on observed phenomenon instead of the failure mechanisms. This model deals only with inelastic strain and ignores elastic strain completely. It accounts for different types of deformation and breaks strain into four possible scenarios:&lt;ref&gt;Zhuang, W. Z. et al. [http://hdl.handle.net/1947/3887 "Thermo-mechanical fatigue life prediction: A critical review"] '''Defence Science and Technology Organisation Publications''', 1998&lt;/ref&gt;
*PP – plastic in tension and compression
*CP – creep in tension and plastic in compression
*PC – plastic in tension and creep in compression
*CC – creep in tension and compression

&lt;!-- [Insert Image] --&gt;

The damage and life for each partition is calculated and combined in the model

&lt;math&gt;\frac {1} {N_f} = \frac {F_{pp}} {N'_{pp}} + \frac {F_{cc}} {N'_{cc}} + \frac {F_{pc}} {N'_{pc}} + \frac {F_{cp}} {N'_{cp}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; F_{pp}=\frac {\Delta \epsilon_{pp}} {\Delta \epsilon_{inelastic}},   F_{cc}=\frac {\Delta \epsilon_{cc}} {\Delta \epsilon_{inelastic}},   F_{pc}=\frac {\Delta \epsilon_{pc}} {\Delta \epsilon_{inelastic}},   F_{cp}=\frac {\Delta \epsilon_{cp}} {\Delta \epsilon_{inelastic}} &lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;N'_{pp} &lt;/math&gt; etc., are found from variations of the equation &lt;math&gt; \Delta \epsilon_{inelastic} = A_{pp}(N'_{pp})^{C_{pp}} &lt;/math&gt;

where A and C are material constants for individual loading.

====Benefit====
Strain-Rate Partitioning is a much simpler model than the damage accumulation model. Because it breaks down the loading into specific scenarios, it can account for different phases in loading.

====Drawback====
The model is based on inelastic strain. This means that it does not work well with scenarios of low inelastic strain, such as brittle materials or loading with very low strain.
This model can be an oversimplification. Because it fails to account for oxidation damage, it may overpredict specimen life in certain loading conditions.

==Looking Forward==
The next area of research is attempting to understand TMF of composites. The interaction between the different materials adds another layer of complexity.

Zhang and Wang are currently investigating the TMF of a unidirectional fiber reinforced matrix. They are using a finite element method that accounts for the known microstructure. They have discovered that the large difference in the thermal expansion coefficient between the matrix and the fiber is the driving cause of failure, causing high internal stress.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, Junqian and Fang Wang [http://ijd.sagepub.com/content/19/7/851.abstract "Modeling of Damage Evolution and Failure in Fiber-Reinforced Ductile Composites Under Thermomechanical Fatigue Loading"] '''International Journal of Damage Mechanics''', 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Obama visit===
[[File:President Barack Obama tours the Pyramids and Sphinx with Secretary General of the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities.jpg|thumb|Zahi Hawass and [[Barack Obama]], June 2009]]
When U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] was in Cairo in June 2009, Hawass gave him personal tours of the sites of ancient Egypt.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} At the end of 2009, he was promoted by President [[Hosni Mubarak]] to the post of Vice Minister of Culture.&lt;ref name="vice-minister"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drhawass.com/blog/dr-hawass-named-vice-minister-culture-egypt |title=Archived copy |accessdate=August 12, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140724162948/http://www.drhawass.com/blog/dr-hawass-named-vice-minister-culture-egypt |archivedate=July 24, 2014 }}{{third-party-inline|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011 protest vandalism===
On January 29, 2011, in the midst of the [[2011 Egyptian protests|Egyptian protests of that year]], Hawass arrived at the [[Egyptian Museum]]  to find that a number of cases had been broken into and a number of antiquities damaged, so police were brought in to secure the museum.&lt;ref name="Joffe"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Joffe | first = Alex | date = 2011 | title= Arts Link: Egypt's Antiquities Fall Victim to the Mob | format = online | issue = February 1 | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703833204576114580200904212 | accessdate= 25 January 2016 | journal = [[The Wall Street Journal]] | quote = "Subtitle: A definitive answer to the question: Should the Elgin Marbles be returned to Greece?" }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Andrew Lawler, reporting for ''Science,'' Hawass "faxed a colleague in Italy that 13 cases were destroyed.

"My heart is broken and my blood is boiling," the U.S.-trained archaeologist lamented." }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawass later told ''[[The New York Times]]'' that thieves looking for gold broke 70 objects, including two sculptures of Tutankhamun, and took two skulls from a research lab, before being stopped as they left the museum.&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;{{cite news | last=Taylor|first=Kate | date = 2011 | title= Middle East: Antiquities Chief Says Sites Are Largely Secure | format = online | issue = February 1 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/02/world/middleeast/02antiquities.html | accessdate= 25 January 2016 |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] | quote = "A vast majority of Egypt’s museums and archaeological sites are secure and have not been looted, Zahi Hawass, Egypt’s chief antiquities official, said in a telephone interview on Tuesday.

On February 13, Mahmoud Kassem of ''Bloomberg'' reported Hawass as saying that "18 artifacts, including statues of [[King Tutankhamun]]," were stolen from the Egyptian Museum in January; Kassem, paraphrasing Hawass, continues, "The missing objects include 11 wooden shabti statuettes from Yuya, a gilded wooden statue of Tutankhamun carried by a goddess and a statue of Nefertiti making offerings."&lt;ref name="Kassem"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kassem | first = Mahmoud | date = 2011 | title= Egyptian Museum Says Two King Tut Statues Missing | issue = February 13 | url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2011-02-13/egyptian-museum-says-two-king-tut-statues-missing-update1- | accessdate= 25 January 2016 | journal = Bloomberg Business | quote = "The Egyptian Museum reported that 18 artifacts, including statues of King Tutankhamun, are missing after a break-in last month, said Zahi Hawass, the head of the Supreme Council of Antiquities. / The police and army are following up on the disappearances with people in custody, Hawass said on his website. The missing objects include 11 wooden shabti statuettes from Yuya, a gilded wooden statue of Tutankhamun carried by a goddess and a statue of Nefertiti making offerings, according to Hawass." }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearances==
[[Image:Egypt.ZahiHawass.01.jpg|200px|thumb|Zahi Hawass signing a book in [[Mexico City]], August 2003.]]
Hawass has appeared on television specials on channels such as the [[National Geographic Channel]], [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] and [[Discovery Channel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.com/minisites/lostpyramid] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320211424/http://www.history.com/minisites/lostpyramid |date=March 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hawass has also appeared in several episodes of the U.S. television show ''[[Digging for the Truth]]'', discussing [[Mummy|mummies]], the pyramids, [[Tutankhamun]], [[Cleopatra VII|Cleopatra]], and [[Ramesses II]]. He also appeared on ''[[Unsolved Mysteries]]'' during a segment on the curse of Tutankhamun's tomb. In 2010, Hawass appeared on a reality-based television show on The History Channel called ''[[Chasing Mummies]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/shows/chasing-mummies/bios/dr-zahi-hawass |title=History Channel: '&amp;#39;"Chasing Mummies"'&amp;#39; Archaeologist Profile: Dr. Zahi Hawass |publisher=History.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002163155/http://www.history.com/shows/chasing-mummies/bios/dr-zahi-hawass |archivedate=October 2, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return of artifacts to Egypt===
Hawass spearheaded a movement to return many prominent unique and/or irregularly taken [[Ancient Egyptian]] artifacts, such as the [[Rosetta Stone]], the [[Nefertiti Bust|bust of Nefertiti]], the [[Dendera zodiac]] ceiling painting from the [[Dendera]] Temple, the [[Ankhhaf (sculpture)|bust]] of [[Ankhhaf]] (the architect of the [[Khafra]] [[Pyramid of Khafre|Pyramid]]), the faces of [[Amenhotep III]]'s [[WV22|tomb]] at the [[Louvre Museum]], the [[Luxor Obelisk|Luxor Temple's obelisk]] at the [[Place de la Concorde]] and the statue of [[Hemiunu]], nephew of the Pharaoh Khufu, builder of the largest pyramid, to Egypt from collections in various other countries. In July 2003 the Egyptians requested the return of the Rosetta Stone from the [[British Museum]]. Hawass, as Secretary General of the [[Supreme Council of Antiquities]] in [[Cairo]], told the press, "If the British want to be remembered, if they want to restore their reputation, they should volunteer to return the Rosetta Stone because it is the icon of our Egyptian identity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Charlotte Edwardes|author2=Catherine Milner|last-author-amp=yes|title=Egypt demands return of the Rosetta Stone|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|date=July 20, 2003|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/egypt/1436606/Egypt-demands-return-of-the-Rosetta-Stone.html|accessdate =August 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Henry Huttinger|title = Stolen Treasures: Zahi Hawass wants the Rosetta Stone back, among other things|work=Cairo Magazine|date=July 28, 2005|url=http://www.cairomagazine.com/?module=displaystory&amp;story_id=1238&amp;format=html|accessdate=October 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to antiquities at the British Museum, Hawass said “These are Egyptian monuments. I will make life miserable for anyone who keeps them.” Britain has refused to return them.&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-01-26/egypt-relics-chief-pulls-in-revenue-as-he-fights-for-nefertiti.html|title=Egypt Relics Chief Pulls in Revenue as He Fights for Nefertiti|last=Williams|first=Daniel|date=Jan 27, 2010|work=Bloomberg Businessweek|accessdate=August 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alex Joffe of the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' expressed the opinion that the looting of antiquities during the [[2011 Egyptian protests|2011 civil unrest]] in Egypt made Hawass' quest to return Egyptian antiquities to Egypt "misguided or at least poorly timed."&lt;ref name="Joffe"/&gt;

===DNA testing of Egyptian mummies===
Hawass has been skeptical of the DNA testing of Egyptian mummies, "From what I understand," he has said, "it is not always accurate and it cannot always be done with complete success when dealing with mummies. Until we know for sure that it is accurate, we will not use it in our research."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tutankhamunexhibition.com/tutankhamun-blog/2010/02/17/dna-identifies-tutankhamuns-parents/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530114926/http://www.tutankhamunexhibition.com/tutankhamun-blog/2010/02/17/dna-identifies-tutankhamuns-parents/ |archivedate=May 30, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2000, a joint team from [[Waseda University]] in Japan and Cairo's [[Ain Shams University]] tried to get permission for DNA testing of Egyptian [[mummy|mummies]], but was denied by the [[Egyptian Government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=99437&amp;page=1|title=DNA Tests Halted on King Tut's Mummy|first=A. B. C.|last=News|date=January 7, 2006|website=ABC News|accessdate=May 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hawass stated at the time that DNA analysis was out of the question because it would not lead to anything.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.egyptologyonline.com/using_dna.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091214080708/http://www.egyptologyonline.com/using_dna.htm |date=December 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010, Hawass and his team announced that they had analyzed the mummies of [[Tutankhamun]] and ten other mummies and said that the king could have died from a malaria infection that followed a leg fracture.&lt;ref name=RobertsBBC10&gt;{{cite journal | last = Roberts | first = Michelle | date = 2010 | title= 'Malaria and Weak Bones' May Have Killed Tutankhamun | journal = [[BBC News]] | format = online | volume = | issue = February 16 | doi = | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8516425.stm | accessdate= 25 January 2016 | quote = "The Egyptian "boy king" Tutankhamun may well have died of malaria after the disease ravaged a body crippled by a rare bone disorder, experts say. / The findings could lay to rest conspiracy theories of murder.

We are sceptical towards this elucidation of the cause of death… and discuss alternative and differential diagnoses, among them, …sickle cell disease and Gauche’s disease." }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, a study signed by Hawass disclosed that [[Ramses III]] had a haplogroup that is associated with the [[Bantu expansion]] and is the most dominant in Sub-Saharan Africa, [[E1b1a]].&lt;ref name=HawassZinkBMJ12&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hawass, Zahi | author2 = Somaia Ismail | author3 =  Ashraf Selim | author4 =  Sahar N.

Unknown man E also had an unusual mummification procedure. According to genetic analyses, both mummies had identical haplotypes of the Y chromosome and a common male lineage. / Conclusions This study suggests that Ramesses III was murdered during the harem conspiracy by the cutting of his throat.

==Recognition and awards==
Hawass is the recipient of the Egyptian state award of the first degree for his work in the Sphinx restoration project.&lt;ref name=alahram/&gt; In 2002, he was awarded the American Academy of Achievements' Golden Plate and the glass obelisk from US scholars for his efforts to the protection and preservation of Ancient Egyptian monuments.&lt;ref name=alahram/&gt; In 2003, Hawass was given international membership in the Russian Academy for Natural Sciences (RANS),&lt;ref name=alahram/&gt; and in 2006, he was chosen as one of the world's 100 most influential people by ''[[Time magazine]]''.&lt;ref name=alahram&gt;{{cite journal|author=Nevine El Aref|title=He made it in Time|journal=Al Ahram Weekly|date=May 4–10, 2006|volume=793|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2006/793/eg10.htm|accessdate=January 3, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508032821/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2006/793/eg10.htm|archivedate=May 8, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

===Relationships with other archaeologists===
Hawass has been accused of domineering behaviour, forbidding archaeologists to announce their own findings, and courting the media for his own gain after they were denied access to archaeological sites because, according to Hawass, they were too amateurish.&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news | last=Waxman | first=Sharon | date = 2005 | title= Art &amp; Design: The Show-Biz Pharaoh of Egypt's Antiquities | format = online | issue = June 13 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/13/arts/design/the-showbiz-pharaoh-of-egypts-antiquities.html | accessdate= 25 January 2016 |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] | quote = "The King Tut exhibition set to open on June 16 in Los Angeles, bringing the boy king's treasures to the United States for the first time in a quarter-century, is in just about every sense a reflection of Zahi Hawass, the man who made the show possible. / Dr. Hawass, who controls Egypt's vast archaeological trove as secretary general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, is part Indiana Jones, part P.T. Barnum -- intent on dusting off Egypt's holdings through a mix of entertainment, commerce and archaeology." }}&lt;/ref&gt; A few, however, have said in interviews that some of what Hawass has done for the field was long overdue.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; Hawass has typically ignored or dismissed his critics, and when asked about it he indicated that what he does is for the sake of [[Egypt]] and the preservation of its antiquities.&lt;ref name = ParkerNYer09&gt;{{cite journal |  author = Parker, Ian | date = 2009 | title = Letter from Cairo, The Pharaoh: Is Zahi Hawass bad for Egyptology? | format = print, online | issue = November 16 | pages =53–63 | url = http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/11/16/the-pharaoh  | access-date = 25 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on Jews and Israel===
Hawass has been a long-standing opponent of normalized relations between Israel and Egypt.&lt;ref name="Slap"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1159674.html |title=Egypt antiquities chief: I gave the Zionist enemy a slap in the face |publisher=[[Haaretz]] |accessdate=March 30, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331133005/http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1159674.html |archivedate=March 31, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2009 Hawass wrote in ''[[Al-Sharq Al-Awsat]]'' that "The concept of killing women, children, and elderly people&amp;nbsp;... seems to run in the blood of the Jews of Palestine" and that "the only thing that the Jews have learned from history is methods of tyranny and torment&amp;nbsp;— so much so that they have become artists in this field."  He explained that he was not referring to the Jews' "[original] faith" but rather "the faith that they forged and contaminated with their poison, which is aimed against all of mankind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.memritv.org/report/en/3213.htm |title=The Middle East Media Research Institute |publisher=Memritv |date= |accessdate=2016-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview on Egyptian television in April 2009 Hawass stated that "although Jews are few in number, they control the entire world" and commented on the "control they have" of the American economy and the media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://network.nationalpost.com/np/blogs/fullcomment/archive/2009/04/20/the-jews-secret-weapon-bickering.aspx ]{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.memritv.org/clip/en/2049.htm?auth=5bbfe6252b977abf4f8cb54219acbdb |title=MEMRI: Renowned Egyptian Archeologist Zahi Hawass: Jews Control the Entire World |publisher=Memritv.org |date= |accessdate=2016-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.memritv.org/clip_transcript/en/2049.htm |title=Clip Transcript |publisher=Memritv.org |date=2009-02-11 |accessdate=2016-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later wrote that he was using rhetoric to explain political fragmentation among the Arabs and that he does not believe in a "Jewish conspiracy to control the world".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drhawass.com/blog/clarification-remarks-jewish-history ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129064750/http://www.drhawass.com/blog/clarification-remarks-jewish-history |date=November 29, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath of 2011 protests===
Criticism of Hawass, in Egypt and more broadly, increased following the protests in Egypt in 2011. On July 12, 2011, ''The New York Times'' reported on a story on page A1 that Hawass receives an honorarium each year "of as much as $200,000 from [[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] to be an explorer-in-residence even as he controls access to the ancient sites it often features in its reports."&lt;ref name="Times-7-14"&gt;{{cite news | last=Taylor | first=Kate | date = 2011 | title= Middle East: Revolution Dims Star Power of Egypt's Antiquities Chief | format = print, online | page = A1ff | issue = July 12 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/13/arts/design/the-showbiz-pharaoh-of-egypts-antiquities.html | accessdate= 25 January 2016 |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] | quote = "Until recently Zahi Hawass, Egypt’s antiquities minister, was a global symbol of Egyptian national pride. A famous archaeologist in an Indiana Jones hat, he was virtually unassailable in the old Egypt, protected by his success in boosting tourism, his efforts to reclaim lost artifacts and his closeness to the country’s first lady, Suzanne Mubarak. / But the revolution changed all that. / Now demonstrators in Cairo are calling for his resignation as the interim government faces disaffected crowds in Tahrir Square." }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Times'' also reported that he has relationships with two American companies that do business in Egypt.&lt;ref name="Times-7-14"/&gt;

On April 17, 2011, Hawass was sentenced to jail for one year for refusing to obey a court ruling&lt;ref name="Taylor2"/&gt; relating to a contract for the gift shop at the [[Egyptian Museum]] to a company with links to Hawass.&lt;ref name="Times-7-14"/&gt; The ruling was appealed and this specific sentence was suspended pending appeal.&lt;ref name="Taylor2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/04/201141720122512511.html |title=Egypt antiquities chief faces jail time - Middle East |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date= |accessdate=2012-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, the National Council of Egypt’s Administrative Court issued a decree to overturn the court's original ruling, specifying that he would serve no jail time, and would instead remain in his position as Minister of Antiquities.&lt;ref name="Times-7-14"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drhawass.com/blog/decision-court-case-against-me] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103163004/http://www.drhawass.com/blog/decision-court-case-against-me |date=January 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The jail sentence was lifted after a new contract was solicited for the running of the gift shop.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

===Association with Mubarak===
As its Minister of Antiquities, Hawass has been closely associated with the government of former President [[Hosni Mubarak]]. His resignation as minister on March 3, 2011 and his re-appointment to the Ministry on March 30, 2011 have been seen as part of the overall events surrounding Mubarak's resignation. It has been reported that his re-appointment has angered numerous factions, who have opposed the appointment of any of the old guard under Mubarak to new positions in the government.&lt;ref name="jpost"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Headlines/Article.aspx?id=214426|title=Breaking News |work=Jerusalem Post|date=March 30, 2011|accessdate=October 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2011 Egyptian protests]] resulted in increased criticism of Hawass. Demonstrators called for his resignation, and the upheaval has increased attention on his relationship with the Mubarak family and the way in which he has increased his public profile in recent years.&lt;ref name="Times-7-14"/&gt;

===Commercial endeavours===
Hawass has lent his name to a line of men's apparel, described by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as "a line of rugged khakis, denim shirts and carefully worn leather jackets that are meant, according to the catalog copy, to hark "back to Egypt’s golden age of discovery in the early 20th century"; the clothing was first sold at [[Harrods]] department store in London, in April 2011.&lt;ref name="Taylor2"&gt;{{cite news | last = Taylor | first = Kate | date = 2011 | title= Art &amp; Design: Using History to Sell Clothes? Don’t Try It With the Pharaohs | format = online | issue = April 18 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/19/arts/design/egyptian-antiquities-official-defends-fashion-line.html | accessdate= 25 January 2016 |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] | quote = "Zahi Hawass, Egypt’s longtime chief antiquities official, has been criticized in recent months for many things: his closeness to former President Hosni Mubarak, some inconsistent reports on the safety of archaeological sites during the uprising and for his role in a dispute over an Egyptian museum bookstore, for which he now possibly faces jail time. / But the source of the latest controversy to beset Mr. Hawass resembles something straight from the mouth of J. Peterman, the character on 'Seinfeld' based on the clothing catalog retailer of the same name. / Mr. Hawass has lent his name to a men’s wear brand: a line of rugged khakis, denim shirts and carefully worn leather jackets that are meant, according to the catalog copy, to hark 'back to Egypt’s golden age of discovery in the early 20th century.' "}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics say the Hawass clothing commercializes Egyptian history, and objected to their understanding that "models had sat on or scuffed priceless ancient artifacts during the photo shoot," an accusation that was denied by Hawass and the clothing manufacturers.&lt;ref name="Taylor2"/&gt; Hawass already sells a line of Stetson hats reproducing the ones he wears, which "very much resemble" the ones worn by [[Harrison Ford]] in the ''[[Indiana Jones]]'' movies.&lt;ref name="Taylor2"/&gt;
