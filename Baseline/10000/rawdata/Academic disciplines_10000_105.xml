'''''An account of the lives and works of the most eminent Spanish painters, sculptors and architects''''' is a book written by the Spanish painter [[Antonio Palomino]] and dedicated to the biographies of the most eminent artists who worked in Spain during the so-called [[Siglo de Oro]], the golden age of Spanish art.

It was published for the first time in the original Spanish edition in 1724, entitled ''El parnaso español pintoresco y laureado'' and appearing as the third and last volume of Palomino's ''El museo pictorico y escala optica'', featuring also biographies of Italian artists who worked in Spain ([[Pietro Torrigiano]], [[Tiziano]], [[Sofonisba Anguissola]], [[Federico Zuccari]], [[Luca Giordano]] and many others) as well as Flemish artists ([[Antonio Moro]], [[Pieter Paul Rubens]]). The book includes the first biographies ever published of many Spanish artists, [[Diego Velázquez]] among others,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionaryofarthistorians.org/palominoa.htm|title=Palomino de Castro y Velasco, [Acisclo] Antonio|publisher=Dictionary of Art Historians|accessdate=29 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127122412/http://dictionaryofarthistorians.org/palominoa.htm|archive-date=2010-11-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, Norbert, Velázquez, Taschen, Köln, 2000, p.95, (Italian edition) {{ISBN|3822864471}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and was translated and published in English, French and German during the 18th century; the English translation appeared in 1739.

The book has been described as "the starting point for all students of Spanish painting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Enggas|first1=Robert|last2=Brown|first2=Jonathan|title=Italian and Spanish Art, 1600-1750: Sources and Documents|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JBYnVv2lKY4C&amp;lpg=PA192&amp;ots=NxmfpIbCQW&amp;dq=Palomino%20Velasquez&amp;pg=PA180#v=onepage&amp;q=Palomino&amp;f=false|year=1992|publisher=Northwestern University Press|isbn=0810110652|page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ashkenazum''' was an [[organized crime]] group active in [[Argentina]] in the first half of the 20th century. Ashkenazum was founded by [[Simon Rubinstein (pimp)|Simon Rubinstein]] as a splinter group from the larger [[Zwi Migdal]], an organized crime group that stretched across five continents and specialized in the sex trafficking of [[Eastern European]] [[Ashkenazi Jews|Jewish]] girls.&lt;ref&gt;Bristow, Edward J. Prostitution and Prejudice: the Jewish Fight against White Slavery, 1870-1939. Schocken Books, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

Simon Rubinstein arrived in [[Buenos Aires]] in 1900 from [[Odessa]], and there he quickly acquired control of a condom factory. He was a notorious silk smuggler, and became affiliated with the Zwi Migdal. At the height of his operation, he had 700 agents in Argentina trafficking women for him.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Hilary. Harlots, Whores &amp; Hookers: a History of Prostitution. Dorset Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the larger Zwi Migdal, the Ashkenazum also had its own cemetery outside of Buenos Aires.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3403899,00.html Kupferboim, Rona. “Argentine Jewry's Dark Secret.” Ynet News, Jewish World, 25 May 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Asian American Studies''' is an academic discipline which critically examines the history, experiences, culture, and policies relevant to [[Asian Americans]]. It is closely related to other [[Ethnic Studies]] disciplines, such as [[African American Studies]], [[Latino/a Studies]], and [[Native American Studies]]. 

==History==
Asian American Studies appeared as a field of intellectual inquiry in the late 1960s&lt;ref&gt;Shirley Hune. "Expanding the International Dimension of Asian American Studies". Amerasia Journal, Vol. 15 No. 2 (1989), pp.xix&lt;/ref&gt; as a result of strikes by the Third World Liberation Front, a group of students of color at [[San Francisco State University]] and at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], which demanded that college classroom instruction include the histories of people of color in the United States told from their perspectives. The demand for Ethnic Studies was a critical response to the Eurocentric bias in university curriculum. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fiel |first=Crystal |date=March 8, 2009 |title=Celebration 40 Years: Third World Liberation Front |url=http://magandamagazine.wordpress.com/2009/03/08/celebrating-40-years-third-world-liberation-front/ |journal={m}aganda magazine |publisher=University of California, Berkeley |accessdate=9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, a College of Ethnic Studies (the only such "college" at any American university at the time) became established at San Francisco State University with American Indian Studies, Asian American Studies, Africana Studies, and Latino/a Studies as its four units,&lt;ref&gt;San Francisco State University: Asian American Studies. &lt;http://www.sfsu.edu/~aas/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and four ethnic studies programs became established at the University of California, Berkeley. The [[Association for Asian American Studies]], a professional organization designed to promote teaching and research in the field, was established in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ABOUT {{!}} Association for Asian American Studies|url = http://aaastudies.org/about/|website = aaastudies.org|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Topics in Asian American Studies==
Drawing from numerous disciplines such as [[sociology]], [[history]], [[literature]], [[political science]], and [[gender studies]], Asian American Studies scholars consider a variety of perspectives and employ diverse analytical tools in their work. Unlike "Asian" Studies which focuses on the history, culture, religion, etc. of Asian people living in Asia, Asian American Studies is interested in the history, culture, experiences, of Asians living in the United States.

Academic programs in Asian American Studies provide students with the opportunity to examine the history of Asian-Americans, which includes topics such as immigration and race-based exclusion policies.&lt;ref&gt;L. Ling-Chi Wang. "Asian American Studies" American Quarterly Vol. 33, No. 3 (1981), pp. 339-354&lt;/ref&gt; 

Asian American Studies provides an academic avenue for addressing issues of racial oppression, capitalism at home, and imperialism abroad.&lt;ref&gt;L. Ling-Chi Wang. "Asian American Studies" American Quarterly Vol. 33, No. 3 (1981), pp. 339-354&lt;/ref&gt; 

The discourse also includes studies on how [[Immigrant generation|first- and second-generation]] Asian Americans deal with adjustment and assimilation, especially on their Americanization and aggressive pursuit of higher education and prestigious occupations in a society that still discriminates against them.&lt;ref&gt;L. Ling-Chi Wang. "Asian American Studies" American Quarterly Vol. 33, No. 3 (1981), pp. 339-354&lt;/ref&gt;

Asian American Studies focuses on the identities, historical and contemporary experiences of individuals and groups in the United States. Concepts and issues that are crucial to this interdisciplinary curriculum include: [[Orientalism]], diaspora, Asian American masculinity, Asian American femininity, cultural politics, and media representation.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

==Major Programs and Departments==
Major Asian American Studies programs in California include those at [[UC Berkeley]], [[UC San Diego]], [[UC Santa Barbara]], [[UC Irvine]],  [[UC Davis]], [[San Francisco State University]] (SFSU), [[California State University, Long Beach]], [[California State University, Northridge]], [[California State University, Fullerton]], [[City College of San Francisco]], [[University of Southern California]], [[The Claremont Colleges]], and at [[UCLA]].

Outside of California, major programs include [[University of Washington]], [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], University of Maryland, College Park, [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]], [http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/aasp/welcome-page Hunter College], [[Cornell University]], [[Binghamton University]], Duke University and [[Columbia University]]. Other rising programs include [[Arizona State University]], [[New York University]], [[Northwestern University]], [[University of Pennsylvania]] and [[University of Minnesota]]. Currently, several universities, including [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]], [[University of Virginia]], [[Syracuse University]], and many others are in the process of developing Asian American Studies departments. 

Master of Arts in Asian American Studies programs are available at UCLA and SFSU.

At the time of its founding in 1987, the Asian American Studies Program at [[Cornell University]] was the first such program in the Ivy League and on the east coast. Today it has four core faculty members in the humanities and social sciences in a variety of departments and colleges. This cross-college, university-wide position accommodates the extensive teaching and research interests of the Program's faculty and reflects the breadth of the vibrant field of Asian American Studies in general. In the classroom, in scholarship, and through campus and community advocacy, the Program is committed to examining the histories and experiences; identities, social and community formations; politics; and contemporary concerns of people of Asian ancestry in the United States and other parts of the Americas.

On the East Coast, the [[State University of New York at Stony Brook]] created an Asian &amp; Asian American Studies Department after a 52 million dollar donation by Charles B. Wang (the founder of Computer Associates). The Charles B. Wang Center is designed as a vital space for multi-disciplinary and multicultural dialogues. The {{convert|120000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} building was officially presented to Stony Brook University by Charles B. Wang on October 22, 2002. It was the largest single private gift ever received by the State University of New York 64-campus system. The Wang Center is used for conferences, art exhibits, film festivals, lectures, seminars, and performances. It is open to all Stony Brook students, faculty, and staff as well as the surrounding community.

[[Hunter College, City University of New York]], located in the [[Upper East Side]] in [[Manhattan]] is home to the only Asian American Studies Program in the [[CUNY]] system. The program was established in 1993 through student and faculty activism, with Peter Kwong as the inaugural director. Despite offering the largest number of Asian American Studies courses in [[New York City]], [[Hunter College]] does not have an Asian American Studies department nor does it offer an Asian American Studies major. In 2006, when the program was under threat of being cut, student activists formed [[The Coalition for the Revitalization of Asian American Studies at Hunter]] to fight to keep Asian American Studies. The students succeeded in saving the minor program, and they continue to fight for an Asian American Studies major and department. 

[[Queens College, City University of New York]], located in the neighborhood of [[Flushing, Queens|Flushing]] in [[New York City]], is home to the [https://www.qc.cuny.edu/academics/centers/asian/Pages/homepage.aspx Asian/American Center]. It was established to conduct research with community needs in mind. It serves as a hub for research into Asian American issues, particularly focusing on the Asian diaspora in the New York area, and offers a minor in Asian American Community Studies (AACS).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4160">[[Image:Beamed notes.svg|thumb|right|alt=image with beamed notes|A quaver, a dotted quaver, and a semiquaver, all joined with a primary beam (the semiquaver has a secondary beam)]]

In [[musical notation]], a '''beam''' is a horizontal or diagonal line used to connect multiple consecutive [[Musical note|note]]s (and occasionally rests) to indicate rhythmic grouping. Only [[eighth note]]s (quavers) or [[note value|shorter]] can be beamed. The number of beams is equal to the number of [[note value|flags]] that would be present on an unbeamed note. '''''Beaming''''' refers to the conventions and use of beams. A '''primary beam''' connects a note group unbroken, while a '''secondary beam''' is interrupted or partially broken.

==Grouping==
The span of beams indicates the rhythmic grouping, usually determined by the time signature. Therefore, beams do not usually cross [[bar line]]s or major subdivisions of bars. If notes extend across these divisions, this is indicated with a [[tie (music)|tie]]. It is basically a line that joins notes together. A single eighth note, or any faster note, is always stemmed with flags, while two or more are usually beamed in groups.&lt;ref&gt;Gerou, Tom (1996). ''Essential Dictionary of Music Notation'', p.211. Alfred. {{ISBN|0-88284-730-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern practice, beams may span across rests in order to make rhythmic groups clearer.

In [[vocal music]], beams were traditionally used only to connect notes sung to the same syllable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Westergaard | first = Peter | title = An Introduction to Tonal Theory | page = 24 | date = 1975 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern practice it is more common to use standard beaming rules, while indicating multi-note syllables with [[slur (music)|slur]]s.&lt;ref name=standard-practice&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080407014159/http://www.mpa.org/music_notation/standard_practice.pdf | archivedate = 2008-04-07 | url = http://www.mpa.org/music_notation/standard_practice.pdf | title = Standard Music Notation Practice | publisher = Music Publishers' Association of the United States | accessdate = 4 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Positioning==
[[File:Exceptional beaming midway beams.png|thumb|Midway beams, though exceptional, can help prevent crowded staves, thus the top staff may be preferable to the bottom two options&lt;ref&gt;[[Gardner Read|Read, Gardner]] (1979). ''Music Notation'', p.89. Crescendo. {{ISBN|0-8008-5453-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Notes joined by a beam usually have all the [[stem (music)|stems]] pointing in the same direction (up or down). The average pitch of the notes is used to determine the direction – if the average pitch is below the middle staff-line, the stems and beams usually go above the notehead, otherwise they go below.&lt;ref name=standard-practice/&gt;

The direction of beams usually follows the general direction of the notes it groups, slanting down if the notes go down, slanting up if the notes go up, and level if the first and last notes are the same.

==Feathered beaming==
[[File:Feathered beams four note run.png|thumb|Feathered beams]]

Feathered beaming shows a gradual change in the speed of notes. It is shown with a primary straight beam and other diagonal secondary beams (that together resemble a feather, hence the name). These secondary beams suggest a gradual acceleration or deceleration from the first note value within the feathered beam to the last. The longest value possible to show being the [[eighth note]] (quaver). When the number of notes played is not of interest, but rather the effect of acceleration or deceleration, an approximate number of headless stems are used. To ensure clarity, sometimes the number of notes within the beam, or the duration of the total beamed notes, is shown above the music, as is done with [[tuplets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.music.indiana.edu/departments/academic/composition/style-guide/#beaming | accessdate = 26 March 2015 | title = Music Notation Style Guide » Beaming | publisher = [[Jacobs School of Music]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Brewing Industry Research Foundation''' is now part of '''[[Campden BRI]]''', a research association serving all sectors of the food and drink industry. The Brewing Division is based next to the [[M23 motorway|M23]], and the other Divisions are located in [[Chipping Campden]], Gloucestershire, where about 330 people are employed.

==History==

===Formation===
In 1946 the [[Institute of Brewing and Distilling|Institute of Brewing]] recommended the setting up of an experimental research station, the '''Brewing Industry Research Foundation''', with a full-time Director of Research and in 1947 Dr J Masson Gulland (Professor of Organic Chemistry, the [[University of Nottingham]]) was appointed to that position. Sadly Dr Masson Gulland was killed in a train crash before taking up his position and hence Sir [[Ian Heilbron]] ([[Imperial College London]]) agreed to become the second Director of Research at the new Brewing Industry Research Foundation (BIRF)in 1949.

===Research building===
In 1948 Lyttel Hall, Nutfield in [[Surrey]] was purchased and the main Hall was converted into laboratories, the squash court into a pilot brewery and other new buildings were developed as a workshops and conference facilities. In 1951 HRH The Duke of Edinburgh [[Prince Philip]] formally opened the site. BIRF later became The Brewing Research Foundation, BRF International, Brewing Research International and today is simply known as BRI.

===Research scope===
Initially the BIRF focused on fundamental and applied research for the malting and brewing industries of the UK. Its staff made useful contributions in the areas of [[barley]] germination and [[yeast]] physiology. Since that time its role has evolved to become more service orientated offering analysis, food safety and information packages to an international client base.

===Brewers Patents Ltd===

The control of Brewing Patents Ltd was transferred in 1976 from the Brewers' Society to the Brewing Research Foundation.

===Important Brewing Scientist Training Ground===

Many young scientists of the Brewing Industry found initial employment at this Foundation to become important contributors elsewhere in the Brewing and allied industries.

===Merger===
In October 2008, Campden BRI was formed by the merger of Brewing Research International with Campden &amp; Chorleywood Food Research Association (CCFRA) of [[Chipping Campden]], which was formed in 1919 and is the largest membership-based food research organisation in the world. In the 1920s it devised the Campden Solution, which was later commercialised as the [[Campden Tablet]].

&lt;!--The [[hops]] analysis laboratory at BIRF. The poster shows the conversion of the humulones (found in hop plants) to the iso-humulones (the bitter substances in beer).--&gt;

==Functions==
Its services are used by the vast majority of the world's brewing companies.

The '''Center for research on Children, Adolescents and the Media (CCAM)''' at the [[University of Amsterdam]], the [[Netherlands]], was founded in 2005 by [[Patti Valkenburg]]. Since then, it has grown into one of the largest research centers in its kind worldwide.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} CCAM hosts 25 international researchers from 9 academic disciplines. It is part of the [[Amsterdam School of Communication Research]] ASCoR. Since 2009, CCAM researchers have organized an international master program on Youth and Media.

==Focus==

Children and adolescents have become the defining users of [[media (communication)|media]] and technologies. Despite a booming media industry aimed at young people, little is known about the uses and effects of these media and technologies. CCAM strives to better understand the role of media in [[children]]'s and adolescents' lives. What are the intended and unintended effects of [[advertising]]? Which children are particularly susceptible to potential negative effects of advertising, pornography, and media [[violence]]? When do [[social media]] have positive and negative influences on young people? Researchers in CCAM have published dozens of articles and chapters that provide answers on questions like these.

==Open access==

CCAM has an [[open access]] policy. All publications can be downloaded from the publication section. In addition, all instruments that CCAM researchers have created to investigate their theories and models are freely accessible via the website of CCAM.

==Knowledge dissemination==

Research within CCAM is targeted at an academic audience as well as the public at large. Every three months, the center publishes a news bulletin to inform the broader audience of the latest research insights.

'''Conservation and restoration of metals''' is the activity devoted to the protection and [[Historic preservation|preservation]] of historical (religious, artistic, technical and ethnographic) and [[archaeological]] objects made partly or entirely of [[metal]]. In it are included all activities aimed at preventing or slowing deterioration of items, as well as improving accessibility and readability of them as objects of [[cultural heritage]]. Despite the fact that metals are generally considered as the relatively permanent and stable materials, in contact with the environment they deteriorate gradually, some faster and some much slower. This applies especially to archaeological finds.

It is very important that a conservator of metals has [[knowledge]] of basic [[metalworking]] techniques, history of metalwork, [[history of art]], [[archaeology]], [[corrosion]] of metals, [[scientific]] [[research]] methods, [[theory]] and [[ethics]] of conservation-restoration.

==Deterioration of metals==
[[File:PerseusSignoriaStatue.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Perseus with the Head of Medusa]]'' in the Loggia dei Lanzi gallery on the edge of the [[Piazza della Signoria]] in Florence; picture taken after the statue's cleaning and restoration.]]
An essential cause of deterioration is corrosion of metal objects or object deterioration by interaction with the environment. As the most influential factors of deterioration of historical objects should be pointed out as the relative humidity and air pollution while in archaeological objects a crucial role has composition, depth, humidity and amount of gasses in the soil. In cases of marine or fresh water finds the most important factors of decay are the amount and composition of soluble salts, water depth, amount of dissolved gases, the direction of water currents and the role of both microscopic and macroscopic living organisms.&lt;ref&gt;

==Deterioration of materials associated with metals==
Associated materials deteriorate depending on the origin whether they are organic or inorganic materials. Organic materials usually fail in a relatively short period of time, primarily due to biodegradation. With inorganic materials are these processes considerably longer and more complex. Amount of gases, humidity, depth and composition of soil are very important. In case of salty and sweet water finds essential are amount of gases dissolved in water, depth of water, direction of currents, and microscopic and macroscopic living organisms.

==Metals conservation planning==

===Basics===
As with the conservation and restoration works on any other material,  here are the basic tenets of conservation-restoration based on the quality of execution and the best possible preservation of cultural, historical and technological identity and integrity of objects. Minimal intervention, reversibility and repeatability of preferred treatment are essential, as well as the possibility of easy identification of restored parts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elsevierdirect.com/brochures/shreir/PDF/Shreirs_PreservationOfMetallicCulturalHeritage.pdf Accessed 16.01.2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Recently non-toxic nature of used materials and procedures becomes important too, both in relation to objects and conservator-restorer as a performer, but also in relation to the environment.

===Research===
Nowadays scientific research is an integral part of the metals conservation treatment, at least in highly developed countries.

====Identification of metals and alloys====
*Simple methods - visual examination, spot tests, specific gravity
*Scientific methods - [[X-ray fluorescence]], [[X-ray Diffraction|XRD]], [[Particle-induced X-ray emission]], [[LIBS]], [[Scanning electron microscope|SEM]], electrochemical techniques, [[metallography]]

====Identification of corrosion processes and products====
*Simple method - visual examination, spot tests
*[[Oddy test|The Oddy test]] - for copper, silver, and lead
*Scientific methods - xrd, SEM, metallography

====Identification of materials associated with metals====
*Simple methods - visual examination, spot tests, specific gravity
*Scientific methods - xrf, [[chromatography]],
Raman spectroscopy

====Identification of technology used to produce objects====
*Simple methods - visual examination
*Scientific methods - metallography, [[x-ray radiography]], [[x-ray computed tomography]]

===Decision making===
In preparing the strategy of the metals conservation project interdisciplinary approach to the same is essential. It implies the participation of as many experts as is possible, as a minimum,  we can take curator (archaeologist, historian, art historian), scientists specialized for corrosion of metallic objects of cultural heritage and the conservator - restorer.

===Documentation===
Systematic and well-managed documentation is today an essential prerequisite for quality executed conservation and restoration treatments, including documentation of the state of objects before, during and after treatment. Identification of materials and procedures used to produce object and the results of any scientific research must be part of documentation too. Last but not least- an integral part of the documentation must be a recommendation for further care of object.

===Ethics and ethical problems in metals conservation===
The ethical concept of conservation of metal objects in principle is the same as those in other fields of conservation-restoration of cultural heritage.

But there are several specific problems that can only be found in the conservation of metals - problem of heat treatment of archaeological objects, and the problem of radical restoration of historic, mostly technical, but also architectonic objects too.

While in the first case problem is primarily in the destruction of valuable scientific data, in case of the technical, the architectural, and somewhat less often, historical objects problem is that a radically restored items just simulate the original appearance of the object, and so in some ways that objects can be considered even as, more or less successful fakes, which only superficially simulate long-lost or never existing state of object.

According to the above-mentioned, whenever it is possible real historical substance must be preserved. Thoroughly documented and technically professionally executed restoration of objects, must be avoided because such objects must be seen only as freshly painted surrogates of authentic historic substance.

Ethical problems connected with conservation of sacred metallic heritage objects can be included too.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, J.C.: On restoring sacred objects http://cool.conservation-us.org/byauth/thompson/sacred/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation==

===Preventive conservation===
{{main article|Collections care}}
Metallic heritage objects are sensitive to environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, air pollution and exposure to light and ultraviolet light. They must be protected in a controlled environment where such variables are maintained within a range of damage-limiting levels.

Preventive conservation, also known as collections care, is an important element of museum policy. It is an essential responsibility of members of the museum profession to create and maintain a protective environment for the collections in their care, whether in store, on display, or in transit. A museum should carefully monitor the condition of collections to determine when an artifact requires conservation work and the services of a qualified conservator.

===Interventive conservation===

====Cleaning====
[[Image:HorsesSaintMark1.jpg|right|thumb|Conservation of gilt bronze [[Horses of Saint Mark]], ([[Venice]]).]]

The most common procedure in conservation and restoration of metals is the cleaning process.  This process can be distinguish between mechanical, chemical, electrochemical, ultrasonic, plasma and laser cleaning. In principle, it is aimed at removing dirt and corrosion products from the surface of a metal object.  In many cases archaeology objects only can be cleaned mechanically.

====Structural consolidation====
Aimed at strengthening of the physical structure of the object, and correcting the shape of the object.

*Soldering - soft / hard
*Welding - oxyacetilene / electric arc / TIG / tack / laser / plasma
*Gluing/Cementing
*Reconstructions -in original material - in polymers - *[[3D printing]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uva.nl/en/about-the-uva/organisation/faculties/content/faculteit-der-geesteswetenschappen/shared-content/events/workshops/2013/10/masterclass-3d.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213222342/http://www.uva.nl/en/about-the-uva/organisation/faculties/content/faculteit-der-geesteswetenschappen/shared-content/events/workshops/2013/10/masterclass-3d.html# |date=2013-12-13 }} Retrieved 13.12.2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reconstruction of missing parts or surface decoration====
In certain cases, metals conservator must re-create the lost parts of objects or restore original surface decoration. This approach is accurate only if we have an exact documentation or photographs of items in a complete, currently non-existent state that we want to return.

New parts must be clearly and visibly marked and at least they must be minimally different from the original historic material.

If needed, those parts must be easily and completely removable from the object, and with methods which will not harm it.

Only cyanide or hexchromate free processes must be used.

Only worn-out spots can be replated.

Replating of entire object must be avoided.

====Stabilization====
Focused on slowing of deterioration of objects – in the case of archaeology objects the thorough removal or blocking of chloride salts. In case of the historical objects it is focused on the use of corrosion inhibitors, conversion coatings, rust converters or eventually oxygen free storage.
*Chloride removal (chemical processes, electrochemical processes)
*Corrosion inhibitors ([[benzotriazole]], [[tannin]])
*[[Rust converter]]s˙
*[[Conversion coating]]s ([[phosphate conversion coating]]s, phosphate/tannin, etc.)
*Oxygen free storage

*Waxes:
'''Renaissance Wax{{main article|Renaissance Wax}}

is a brand of microcrystalline wax polish that is widely encountered in antique restoration and museum curation. Although not appropriate for all materials, it is known to and used by almost every collection. It is also used as a primary finish for cabinetry and furniture. Renaissance wax is also used by reenactors of historic swordsmanship to protect armour and weapons. It is widely recognised that this substance is more protective and longer lasting than oil, especially for swords and helmets that are frequently touched by human hands.

To quote a typical commercial supplier of conservation materials, it is used, to revive and protect valuable furniture, leather, paintings, metals, marble, onyx, ivory etc. Freshens colours and imparts a soft sheen&lt;ref&gt;http://www.picreator.co.uk/articles/3_renaissance_wax.htm{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cosmolloid 80 H'''

is refined white microcrystalline wax. It can be used on historical and archaeological metals. Melting point 60–94&amp;nbsp;°C. Soluble in benzol, ether, chloroform, [[carbon disulfide]], [[carbon tetrachloride]], [[turpentine]], petroleum distillates, and fixed oils; partially soluble in [[acetone]], [[diacetone alcohol]]. Main ingredient in Renaissance Wax.

===Conservation of materials associated with metals===

====Precious and semi precious stones====
In principle do not use any solvent, but only distilled water, or a 10% solution of soapwort plant (''Saponaria officinalis''). You must be Especially careful when working on porous gemstones like [[malachite]], [[opal]], [[chalcedony]], [[chrysoprase]], [[agate]], [[carnelian]], [[lapis lazuli]], [[jade]] and [[turquoise]]. Special attention requires gemstones combined with colored metal foils, in this case, the liquid does not come into contact with the foil. Do not use ultrasonic cleaning.

====Enamels====
{{Main article|Conservation and restoration of glass objects}}

====Niello====
Nielloed items can be cleaned only mechanically, never try to use chemical cleaning. Black pigment mixed with Paraloid B 72 can be used for reconstruction of missing parts.
Concentrated solution of Paraloid B 72 or B 67 (soluble in white spirit) can be used as reversible glue.

====Amber====
Do not clean with solvents, do not use ultrasound, you can use only distilled water, or a mixture of water and ethanol (add up to 0.5% crosslinker).&lt;ref&gt;Nikitin, MK; Meljnikova, EP Himija v restavracii, Leningrad 1990th str.268&lt;/ref&gt; Variety of waxy resin mixtures can be used as glue, depending on the color of amber. You can use 10% solution of Canada balsam in toluene&lt;ref&gt;Huck, J; Bleck, RD Chemikalien und Rezepte, Weimar 1990th&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological material can be cleaned only mechanically.
Soaking in liquid paraffin can be used to consolidate and improve color of amber.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ingolstadt.de/stadtmuseum/scheuerer/ausstell/bernst04.htm archaeological site access 23.03.2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
According to one Korean article for consolidation can be used Paraloid B 67 dissolved in xylene (proved more stable than white spirit, usual solvent for B 67)&lt;ref&gt;Ham, CH, Shin, B. Amber Artifact Consolidation Case Study: Impact of Organic Solvents on Amber Artifacts, Abstracts from the 37th Annual Conference of the Canadian Association for Conservation of Cultural Property, Winnipeg 2011th&lt;/ref&gt; According to one American article as ideal consolidant and adhesive can be used Regalrez 1126&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276594058_Conservation_of_amber_at_the_Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art_New_York_USA_Regalrez_R_1126_as_a_consolidant_and_adhesive_for_amber_and_copal  Accessed 15.11.2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  Artifacts must be Protected from strong light and high temperatures, low humidity and oscillations in humidity, in the case of metal/amber objects do not to use corrosion inhibitors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cr.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/11-17.pdf Access to the site Aus Bruchstücken rekonstruiert Ein Bernsteinkästchen der Gothaer Kunstkammer&lt;/ref&gt;

====Oriental lacquer - urushi====
{{Main article|Conservation and restoration of lacquerware}}

Requires a completely different approach than western lacquers. May be found on the Japanese arms and armour. The best approach – leave it to expert for oriental lacquer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/pdf_publications/urushi.html Accessed 10/02/2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://cool.conservation-us.org/jaic/articles/jaic37-01-009_indx.html Accessed 2.10.2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http: / / art-con.ru/node/651. Accessed 04.12.2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Mixture of 6-8% polyvinyl alcohol and chalk can be used as filling material(Rhoplex WS 24 can be used too).&lt;ref&gt;http://cool.conservation-us.org/jaic/articles/jaic37-01-009_2.html Accessed 18.11.2012 page.&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese conservators use traditional techniques, but as Urushi causes allergic reactions, these methods are not recommended. Clean it with an aliphatic hydrocarbon such as white or mineral spirits. Distilled water or saliva (moistened cottonwool swabs) can caused discoloration and should be avoided by the inexperienced: pH is crucial. Keep objects in rooms with controlled humidity and temperature, preferably about 50% RH, and protect them from UV radiation.

====Coral====
Can be cleaned with cotton wool swabs soaked in distilled water, or with a mixture of distilled water and ethanol.&lt;ref&gt;Nikitin, M.K.; Melynikova, E.P. Himiya v restavracii, Leningrad 1990., p.272.&lt;/ref&gt;
Do not use ultrasound. Avoid any contact with acids.

====Pearls====
Historical objects can be cleaned using a mixture of 70% ethanol and 30% weak ammonia water (1%). To remove the surface layer that has lost luster you can use 3–5% EDTA, after that step rinse with distilled water, and then with 80% ethanol, then with 90% ethanol, and finally with pure ethanol.&lt;ref&gt;Nikitin, M.K.; Melynikova, E.P. Himiya v restavracii, Leningrad 1990., p. 271&lt;/ref&gt;
Do not use ultrasound.
Archaeological finds must be treated as soon as possible, preferably after excavation, you can clean them only mechanically, then consolidate with 2% Paraloid B 72, in the case of dry findings (first saturate with solvent in which it is dissolved), in case of damp or wet findings use Rhoplex WS 24 (acrylic dispersion).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mnhs.org/preserve/conservation/reports/shell_objects.pdf Accessed 17.10.2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
Somewhat More recent Russian literature recommends use of bleached beeswax dissolved in white spirit or medical benzine as protective coating. Fish glue mixed with water and alcohol (7/3), with addition of 1% katamine AB as biocide can be used as glue. Nonionogenic detergent 2-3% in a mixture of water and alcohol can be used for cleaning.&lt;ref&gt;http://art-con.ru/node/4473 Accessed 29.11.2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
Avoid prolonged contact with water, sudden changes in temperature and relative humidity, including strong light or contact with acidic or alkaline solutions (soap water too).

====Mother of pearl====

====Ivory, bone and antler====
{{Main article|Conservation and restoration of ivory objects}}

====Tortoiseshell====

====Jet====
You can clean it with cottonwool swabs soaked in distilled water or soapwort extract (''Saponaria officinalis'', 100 grams of dried root per 1 liter of boiling water). Archaeological material can be cleaned only mechanically. Wax/resin mixtures or concentrated solution of Paraloid B 72 (or B 67) can be 
used as glue for archaeology objects.&lt;ref&gt;Nikitin, M.K.; Melynikova, E.P. Himiya v restavracii, Leningrad 1990., p.269&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storage of metallic heritage objects==
The items should be stored in rooms that are protected from polluted air, dust, ultraviolet radiation, and excessive relative humidity - ideal values are temperature of 16-20&amp;nbsp;°C and up to 40% (35-55% according to recent Canadian Conservation Institute recommendations) relative humidity, noting that if metal is combined with organic materials, relative humidity should not be below 45%. Archaeological objects must be stored in rooms (or plastic boxes) with very low relative humidity, or in the case of particularly valuable items in the chambers with nitrogen or argon. Copper or copper alloy objects with active corrosion up to 35% RH. Iron objects with active corrosion 12-15% RH. Shelves in the storerooms must be of stainless steel or chlorine and acetate free plastic or powder coated steel. Wood and wood-based products ([[Particle board]], [[plywood]]) must be avoided. Also do not use [[rubber]], [[felt]] or [[wool]]. When you are handling metal objects, always wear clean cotton gloves. Lighting levels must be kept below 300 lux (up to 150 lux in case of lacquered or painted objects, up to 50 lux in case of objects with light sensitive materials)&lt;ref&gt;Budija Goran:Čišćenje, zaštita i održavanje umjetničkih predmeta i starina od metala, version December 2010., Zagreb,

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5262">The '''daily urban system (DUS)''' refers to the area around a city, in which daily commuting occurs. It is a means for defining an [[urban area|urban]] region by including the areas from which individuals commute. Daily Urban System is a concept first introduced by American geographer, Berry, and British geographer, Hall. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Halás, Marián|first=and Zuskáčová, Veronika|date=April 23, 2017|title="Travelling to Services in the Daily Urban System of Olomouc."|url=http://apcz.umk.pl/czasopisma/index.php/BGSS/article/viewFile/bog-2013-0009/818|journal=Bulletin of Geography. Socio–economic Series.|volume=20|pages=23–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Orphan|date=June 2016}}

Daily urban system (DUS) mainly focusses on urban cities, where majority of the commuting flow take place. However, some case studies do look at the outskirts and suburban areas around specific urban cities that are being studied. The daily commuting includes both work and leisure, contributing to high density in the daily urban system. That results in slower the speed of transportation. The speed of transportation is about 16km/h at the central parts of urban cities, but speed may vary from place to place.&lt;ref&gt;[[Denise Pumain|Pumain, Denise]]. "Scaling Laws and Urban Systems" (PDF). Santa Fe Institute. Retrieved April 23, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;   

[[Urban sprawl]] is the possible outcome of an expansion of the daily urban system. Therefore, it includes multiple local governments, economies, and demographics. The researchers that study daily urban system (DUS) are basically focusing on the [[transportation planning]]. Some are interested in micro analysis of an urban area per se, some carry out macro analysis of a region that is made up of several urban cities. 

The difference between an agglomeration of an urban area and the daily urban system is that an agglomeration is a multivariate means of combining townships, counties, and other defined areas. It looks at shared economic relationships and other factors. Daily urban system, on the other hand, only attempts to show how far away people who commute into a city are living. It shows how much sprawl has occurred. That is, it shows how people are living unnecessarily far away from where they commute to everyday due to differences in conditions between the regions. 

== Literature Review ==

=== Olomouc ===
A study in Olomouc research on the traveling distance among locations such as schools, hospitals, retail stores, and culture and sports centers of the region, and the towns in the hinterland of Olomouc too. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The findings were different for the region and towns. The towns had shown improvement in traveling distance for commercial services, such as pharmacies and banking services. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There were groceries and retail shops moving to large commercial centers too, cutting down traveling distance, which people were able to shop at the malls without having to travel much.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, the study found little changes region wise, especially in health care and education sectors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Commute for schools and health care institutions had remained stable.  

===Randstad===
In this article, the researchers were looking at the daily urban systems within Randstad to determine if the megalopolis is considered a network city. Commute within Randstad remained loose despite the rising proportions of population commuting to work over a decade (1992 to 2002).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ritsema Van Eck, Snellen|first=Jan, Daniëlle|date=2006|title=Is the Randstad a City Network? Evidence From Commuting Patterns|url=https://stuff.mit.edu/afs/athena/course/11/11.951/oldstuff/albacete/Other_Documents/Europe%20Transport%20Conference/planning_for_sustainab/is_the_randstad_a_1428.pdf|journal=Association for European Transport|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many residents from the suburban areas were still commuting to work at the urban areas - large daily urban system - every day after ten years due to low job growth. Randstad was not considered as a network city because of its negative commuting balance, where large proportion of residents had to commute to large daily urban system for work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

=== Paris ===
Paris's central urban population is 2,125,246.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It's agglomerated population is 9,644,507.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; That's a big difference. Roughly 7 million people live outside of Paris proper, but are easily within the greater Parisian area. Paris's daily urban system has a population of 11,174,743.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; That's 1.5 million people living outside of what can (at the most generous) be called Paris, and yet are commuting there every day. 10% of the city lives far enough away that they cannot really say they 'live outside of Paris,' but commute there daily.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Pumain|first=Denise|title=Scaling Laws and Urban Systems|url=http://www.santafe.edu/media/workingpapers/04-02-002.pdf|publisher=[[Santa Fe Institute]]|accessdate=February 28, 2014|format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Domestic technology''' is the incorporation of applied science into the home.  There are many aspects of domestic technology.  On one level, there are [[home appliance]]s, [[home automation]] and other devices commonly used in the home, such as [[clothes dryer]]s and [[washing machine]]s.  These things are itemized below.  On another level, domestic technology recognizes the use of applied science to construct homes to achieve a particular goal, such as [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] or self-sufficiency.  For more information, read about [[self-sufficient homes]].  It has been claimed that domestic technology has led to decreases in the time people spend on household work, although the factual basis of this claim is disputed (Bittman et al., 2004).
There are many technologies now routinely used around modern homes, itemized below.

{{Economic systems sidebar}}
'''Economic democracy''' is a [[Socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] philosophy that proposes to shift decision-making power from [[Management|corporate managers]] and [[Shareholder|corporate shareholders]] to a larger group of [[stakeholder theory|public stakeholders]] that includes workers, customers, suppliers, neighbors and the broader public. No single definition or approach encompasses economic democracy, but most proponents claim that modern property relations [[externality|externalize]] costs, subordinate the general well-being to private profit and deny the polity a democratic voice in economic policy decisions.{{sfn|Smith|2005}} In addition to these moral concerns, economic democracy makes practical claims, such as that it can compensate for [[capitalism]]'s inherent [[effective demand]] gap.{{sfn|Harvey|2010|p=107}}

Proponents of economic democracy generally argue that modern capitalism periodically results in economic crises characterized by deficiency of effective demand as society is unable to earn enough income to purchase its output production. [[Corporation|Corporate]] monopoly of [[Common-pool resource|common resources]] typically creates [[artificial scarcity]], resulting in socio-economic imbalances that restrict workers from access to economic opportunity and diminish consumer [[purchasing power]].{{sfn|George|1912}}{{sfn|Cook, "Monetary Reform" Part 1|2007}} Economic democracy has been proposed as a component of larger socioeconomic ideologies, as a stand-alone theory and as a variety of reform agendas. For example, as a means to securing full [[Economic, social and cultural rights|economic rights]], it opens a path to full [[Civil Rights|political rights]], defined as including the former.{{sfn|Smith|2005}} Both market and non-market theories of economic democracy have been proposed. As a reform agenda, supporting theories and real-world examples range from [[decentralization]] and [[economic liberalism|economic liberalization]] to [[Cooperative|democratic cooperatives]], [[public banking]], [[fair trade]] and the [[Regionalism (politics)|regionalization]] of [[Local food|food production]] and [[Local currency|currency]].

== Deficiency of effective demand ==
According to many analysts, deficiency of effective demand is the most fundamental economic problem. That is, modern society does not earn enough income to purchase its output. For example, [[geographer]] [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] claims, "Workers spending their wages is one source of effective demand, but the total wage bill is always less than the total capital in circulation (otherwise there would be no profit), so the purchase of wage goods that sustain daily life (even with a suburban lifestyle) is never sufficient for the profitable sale of the total output".{{sfn|Harvey|2010|p=107}} While balanced [[Mixed economy|mixed economies]] have existed briefly throughout history, veteran Project Manager for the [[U.S. Treasury Department]], [[Richard C. Cook]] and other critics claim that [[Planned economy|command economies]] are predominate, citing [[state capitalism]] and [[imperialism]] as related. As common resources are monopolized by imperial centers of wealth and power, conditions of scarcity are imposed artificially upon the majority, resulting in large-scale socio-economic imbalance.{{sfn|Cook, "Monetary Reform" Part 1|2007}}

In the [[Georgist]] view of any [[economics|economic system]], "wealth" includes all material things produced by labor for the satisfaction of human desires and having [[exchange value]]. [[Land (economics)|Land]], [[Labour (economics)|labor]] and capital are generally considered the essential factors in producing wealth. Land includes all natural opportunities and forces. Labor includes all human exertion. [[Capital (economics)|Capital]] includes the portion of wealth devoted to producing more wealth. While the income of any individual might include proceeds from any combination of these three sources—land, labor and capital are generally considered mutually exclusive factors in economic models of the production and distribution of wealth. According to [[Henry George]]: "People seek to satisfy their desires with the least exertion".{{sfn|George|1912|date=January 2012}} Human beings interact with nature to produce goods and services that other human beings need or desire. The laws and [[Custom (law)|customs]] that govern the relationships among these entities constitute the economic structure of a given society.

Alternately, [[David Schweickart]] asserts in his book, ''After Capitalism'': "The structure of a capitalist society consists of three basic components:

* "The bulk of the [[means of production]] are privately owned, either directly by individuals or by corporations that are themselves owned by private individuals.
* "Products are exchanged in a market -- that is to say, goods and services are bought and sold at prices determined for the most part by competition and not by some governmental pricing authority. Individual enterprises compete with one another in providing goods and services to consumers, each enterprise trying to make a profit. This competition is the primary determinant of prices.
* "Most of the people who work for pay in this society work for other people, who own the means of production. Most working people are '[[wage labour]]ers'".{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|pp=22–23}}

[[Supply and demand]] are generally accepted as market functions for establishing [[price]]s. Organisations typically endeavor to 1) minimize the [[Cost-of-production theory of value|cost of production]]; 2) increase sales; in order to 3) maximize profits. But, according to David Schweickart, if "those who produce the goods and services of society are paid less than their productive contribution", then as consumers they cannot buy all the goods produced, and investor confidence tends to decline, triggering declines in production and employment. Such economic instability stems from a central contradiction: Wages are both a cost of production and an essential source of [[effective demand]] (needs or desires backed with purchasing power), {{sfn|Schweickart|2002|pp=36, 40–43, 95}} resulting in deficiency of effective demand along with a growing interest in economic democracy.

In chapter 3 of his book, "Community Organizing: Theory and Practice", [[Douglas Biklen|Douglas P. Biklen]] discusses a variety of perspectives on "The Making of Social Problems". One of those views suggests that "writers and organizers who define social problems in terms of social and economic democracy see problems not as the experiences of poor people, but as the relationship of poverty to wealth and exploitation". Biklen states that according to this viewpoint:

{{Quote|[C]orporate power, upper class power, uneven distribution of wealth and prejudice cause social problems... [T]he problem is not one of poverty, but of enormous wealth. The problem is not one of gaps or cracks in an otherwise fine system but of a system which perpetuates prejudicial views concerning race, sex, age, and disability. The problem is not one of incompetence but of barriers to education, jobs, and power. Accordingly, as long as there is a deep gulf between social classes, both in terms of wealth, power, and outlook, traditional social programs will act merely as palliatives to oppression and not as a way of ending large scale human misery. This perspective is, above all, eclectic. It embraces Marx's criticism of social class inequality but is not only a social class analysis. It is anti-racist, but it is not only a theory of race equality. It favors democratic distribution of power but is also an economic theory. It can be called a social and economic democracy perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Biklen|first=Douglas P.|title=Community Organizing: Theory and Practice|year=1983|publisher=Prentice-Hall, Inc.|location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J. 07632|isbn=0-13-153676-1|pages=41, 42}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

=== Savings, investment and unemployment ===

In his 1879 book ''Progress and Poverty'', Henry George argued that a majority of wealth created in a "free market" economy was appropriated by land owners and [[monopoly|monopolists]] through [[economic rent]]s, and that concentration of such [[Unearned income|unearned wealth]] was the root cause of poverty.{{sfn|George|1912|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}} "Behind the abstraction known as 'the market' lurks a set of institutions designed to maximize the wealth and power of the most privileged group of people in the world—the creditor-rentier class of the first world and their junior partners in the third".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Henwood | first = Doug | title = Wall Street: How It Works and For Whom | publisher = Verso | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-86091-495-2 | page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schweickart claimed that private savings are not only unnecessary for economic growth, they are often harmful to the overall economy.{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p=17}}

In an advanced industrial society, business credit is necessary for a healthy economy. A business that wants to expand production needs to command the labor of others, and money is the default mechanism for exercising this authority.{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}} It is often cheaper for a business to borrow capital from a bank than to stockpile cash.

If private savings are loaned out to entrepreneurs who use them to buy raw materials and hire workers, then aggregate demand is not reduced.{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}} However, when private savings are not reinvested, the whole economy suffers recession, unemployment, and disappearance of savings {{sfn|Schweickart|2002|pp=42–43}} which characterize deficiency of effective demand.

In this view, unemployment is not an aberration, indicating any sort of systemic malfunction. Rather, unemployment is a necessary structural feature of capitalism, intended to discipline the workforce. If unemployment is too low, workers make wage demands that either cut into profits to an extent that jeopardizes future investment, or are passed on to consumers, thus generating inflationary instability. Schweickart suggested, "Capitalism cannot be a full-employment economy, except in the very short term. For unemployment is the "[[invisible hand]]"—carrying a stick—that keeps the workforce in line."{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p=97}} In this view, [[Adam Smith|Adam Smith's]] "invisible hand" does not seem reliable to guide economic forces on a large scale.{{sfn|Smith|2005|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}}

Assuming business credit could come from public sources rather than from private savers, Schweickart and other analysts consider interest payments to private savers both undeserved and unnecessary for economic growth. Moreover, the personal decision to save rather than consume decreases aggregate demand, increases the likelihood of unemployment, and exacerbates the tendency toward economic stagnation. Since wealthy people tend to save more than poor people, the propensity of an economy to slump because of excess saving becomes ever more acute as a society becomes more affluent.{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}} Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett suggested that health and social problems are significantly worse in more unequal wealthy nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wilkinson | first = Richard G | title = The Spirit Level: Why Greater Equality Makes Societies Stronger | publisher = Bloomsbury Press | isbn = 978-1-60819-036-2 |year = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that there are "pernicious effects that inequality has on societies: eroding trust, increasing anxiety and illness, (and) encouraging excessive consumption"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last= Jarvis | first = Brooke |url= http://www.yesmagazine.org/happiness/want-the-good-life-your-neighbors-need-it-too | title = Equality and the Good Life: Interview with Richard Wilkinson, author of The Spirit Level: Why More Equal Societies Almost Always Do Better | work = yesmagazine.org |date = March 4, 2010 |accessdate = January 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Monopoly power versus purchasing power ===

Regarding a social and economic democracy perspective on social problems, Douglas P. Biklen states:

{{quote|The theme of profit superseding individual well-being flows through this antimonopoly view of social problems. On the one hand, poor and middle income people find their lives deformed by their meager or nonexistent ability to pay for goods and services. Wealthy people, on the other hand, find that their relative position, in terms of wealth and power, grows with their ability to maintain the gulf between social classes. Thus monopolies or concentrated wealth plays a large part in creating social problems. Indeed, one might say, monopolies and policies which promote the former or concentrations of wealth are the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Biklen|first=Douglas P.|title=Community Organizing: Theory and Practice|year=1983|publisher=Prentice-Hall, Inc.|location=Englewood Cliffs, N. J. 07632|isbn=0-13-153676-1|pages=43, 44}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

The discipline of economics is largely a study of [[scarcity]] management; "the science which studies human behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robbins|first=Lionel|title=An Essay On The Nature And Significance Of Economic Science|year=1932|publisher=MacMillan &amp; Co, Ltd|location=St. Martin's Street, London|asin=B000XG8SV4|pages=15|url=https://mises.org/books/robbinsessay2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Absent scarcity and alternative uses of available resources, many analysts claim there is no [[economic problem]]". For example, Richard C. Cook asserts that conditions of scarcity are artificially maintained by [[Corporate finance|corporate structures]] that confine [[Abundance (economics)|abundance]] to an exclusively entitled minority. In this view, socio-economic imbalance stems not from a failure to manage limited [[Resource (economics)|resources]] in a world of scarcity, but from mismanagement of virtually unlimited abundance and prosperity.{{sfn|Cook, "Monetary Reform" Part 1|2007}} American businessman Edward Kellogg (1790–1858) supports this perspective in his 1849 book, ''Labor and Other Capital'', where he states:

{{quote|Money power is not only the most governing and influential, but it is also the most unjust and deceitful of all earthly powers. It entails upon millions excessive toil, poverty and want, while it keeps them ignorant of the cause of their sufferings; for, with their tacit consent, it silently transfers a large share of their earnings into the hands of others, who have never lifted a finger to perform any productive labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kellogg |first=Edward |last2=Campbell |first2=Alexander |title=Labor and Other Capital |year=1971 |publisher=Scholar's Bookshelf |isbn=0-678-00803-5 |page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While he considers these functions a public wrong, Kellogg also asserted the responsibility of the public to find and implement a remedy. Generally considered [[Monopoly|monopoly power]], some view this "public wrong" as the most influential factor in [[artificial scarcity]]. For example, Henry George further suggested:

{{quote|There is in reality no conflict between labor and capital; the true conflict is between labor and monopoly... Abolish the monopoly that forbids men to employ themselves and capital could not possibly oppress labor... [R]emove the cause of that injustice which deprives the laborer of the capital his toil creates and the sharp distinction between capitalist and laborer would, in fact, cease to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = George | first = Henry | title = Protection or Free Trade: An Examination of the Tariff Question, With Especial Regard to the Interests of Labor | year = 1998 | publisher = Robert Schalkenbach Foundation | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-911312-83-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

For example, many analysts consider [[invention]] a "more or less costless store of knowledge, captured by monopoly capital and protected in order to make it secret and a 'rare and scarce commodity', for sale at monopoly prices. So far as invention is concerned, a price is put on them not because they are scarce but in order to make them scarce to those who want to use them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Penrose |first=Edith Tilton |title=The International Patent System | publisher = Johns Hopkins Press | location = Baltimore |year=1951 | oclc = 181961 |page=29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nadudere |first=Dan |title=The Political Economy of Imperialism |year=1977 |publisher=Zed Books |page=251 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Smith|2007|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}} Patent monopolies raise share prices above tangible labor value. The difference between labor-value and monopoly-value raises goods prices, and is collected as "profit" by intermediaries who have contributed nothing to earn it.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}}

Analysts generally agree that such conditions typically result in a deficiency of effective demand. Labor does not earn enough to buy what enterprises produce. For example, Richard C. Cook maintains that the difference between earnings and prices is typically appropriated by industrial and banking centers of capital through monopoly control of finance and other market resources. Such exclusive entitlement tends to artificially impose conditions of economic scarcity upon the majority of the population.{{sfn|Cook, "Monetary Reform" Part 1|2007}} While the accelerating advance of technology, developed and maintained by labor, tends to generate abundance, this process depresses wages as workers are replaced by machines, ironically minimizing the purchasing power of workers in the market. {{sfn|Cook, "Monetary Reform" Part 1|2007}} According to Jack Rasmus, author of ''The Trillion Dollar Income Shift'', in June 2006, investment bank Goldman Sachs reported: "The most important contribution to the higher profit margins over the past five years has been a decline in Labor's share of national income." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rasmus|first=Jack|title=The Trillion Dollar Income Shift, Part 1|journal=Z Magazine|date=February 2007|volume=20|issue=2|pages=44–49|url=http://www.armory.com/~rstevew/Wealth/JackRasmusZMag.txt|accessdate=February 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Enclosure of the commons ===
Artificially restricted access of labor to common resources is generally considered monopoly or [[enclosure|enclosure of the commons]]. Due to the economic imbalance inherently imposed, such monopoly structures tend to be centrally dictated by law, and must be maintained by military force, trade agreements, or both.{{sfn|George|1912|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}}

In 1911, American journalist [[Ambrose Bierce]] defined "land" as:

{{quote|A part of the earth's surface, considered as property. The theory that land is property subject to private ownership and control is the foundation of modern society.... Carried to its logical conclusion, it means that some have the right to prevent others from living; for the right to own implies the right exclusively to occupy; and in fact laws of trespass are enacted wherever property in land is recognized. It follows that if the whole area of terra firma is owned by A, B and C, there will be no place for D, E, F and G to be born, or, born as trespassers, to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bierce | first = Ambrose | authorlink = Ambrose Bierce | title = [[The Devil's Dictionary]] | year = 1911 | oclc = 49294964}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

In ''The Servile State'' (1912), [[Hilaire Belloc]] referred to the [[Enclosure|Enclosures Movement]] when he said, "England was already captured by a wealthy [[oligarchy]] before the series of great [[Industrial Revolution|industrial]] discoveries began". If you sought the accumulated wealth preliminary to launching new industry, "you had to turn to the class which had already monopolized the bulk of the means of production in England. The rich men alone could furnish you with those supplies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Belloc|first=Hilaire|title=The Servile State|year=1912|publisher=T. N. Foulis|location=91 Great Russell Street, London, W.C. 15 Frederick Street, Edinburgh|asin=B004QGY2M6|pages=72, 74|url=https://archive.org/stream/servilestate00belluoft/servilestate00belluoft_djvu.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Peter Barnes (entrepreneur)|Peter Barnes]], author of ''Capitalism 3.0'', when Adam Smith wrote ''The Wealth of Nations'' in 1776, the dominant form of business was partnership, in which regional groups of co-workers ran co-owned businesses. From this perspective, many considered the corporate model—stock sold to strangers—inherently prone to fraud. While numerous scandals historically support this dim view of corporate policy, small partnerships could not possibly compete with the aggregate capital generated by corporate [[economies of scale]]. The greatest advantage of corporations over any other business model is their ability to raise capital from strangers. The corporate model benefits from laws that limit stockholders' liability to the amounts they have invested.{{sfn|Barnes|2006}}

In ''A Preface To Economic Democracy'', [[Robert A. Dahl]] suggests that [[Agriculture|agrarian]] economy and society in the early United States "underwent a [[Industrial Revolution|revolutionary]] transformation into a new system of commercial and industrial capitalism that automatically generated vast [[Economic inequality|inequalities]] of wealth, income, [[Social status|status]], and [[Economic power|power]]." Dahl claims that such inequalities result from the "[[liberty]] to accumulate unlimited [[Factors of production|economic resources]] and to organize economic activity into [[Hierarchy|hierarchically]] governed enterprises."{{sfn|Dahl|1985|p=50}}

=== The rise of corporations and ending labor shortage ===
According to author Greg MacLeod, the concept of the corporation originated in Roman times. However, "the modern business corporation evolved radically from its ancient roots into a form with little relation to the purpose as understood by historians of law." John Davis, a legal historian, noted that the precursor of the business corporation was the first [[monastery]], established in the sixth century, the purpose of which was to serve society. Most business corporations before 1900 developed in Great Britain, where they were established by [[royal charter]], with the expectation of contributions to society. Incorporation was a privilege granted in return for service to the crown or the nation. MacLeod goes on to say:

{{quote|A corporation is considered by the law to exist as a legal person. In the [[Middle Ages]] it was called a "persona ficta". This is a very useful way of looking at a business corporation, because it suggests correctly that the [[corporate personhood|corporate person]] has a certain personality. It has duties and responsibilities vested unto it by the legitimate government or society that fostered it. The corporate person receives great benefits from society – and, in return, it must exercise great responsibilities. One of the most basic responsibilities is job creation, a fundamental need in any society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = MacLeod | first = Greg | title = The Public Purpose Corporation | journal = Harvard International Review | date = 2009-04-04 | url = http://hir.harvard.edu/the-mondragon-experiment | accessdate = 2011-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

By the mid-nineteenth century, corporations could live forever, engage in any legal activity, and merge with or acquire other corporations. In 1886, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] legally recognized corporations as “persons”, entitled under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to the same protections as living [[Citizenship|citizens]]. Unlike average citizens, large corporations had large flows of money at their disposal. With this money they can hire [[Lobbying|lobbyists]], donate copiously to politicians, and sway [[public opinion]].

But, despite [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] rulings, the modern corporation is not a real person. Rather, the publicly traded stock corporation is what Barnes terms an "[[automaton]]", explicitly designed to maximize return to its owners. A corporation never sleeps or slows down. It externalizes as many costs as possible, and never reaches an upper limit of profitability, because no such limit has yet been established. As a result, corporations keep getting larger. In 1955, sales of the [[Fortune 500]] accounted for one-third of U.S. gross domestic product. By 2004 they commanded two-thirds. In other words, these few hundred corporations replaced smaller firms organized as partnerships or [[Sole proprietorship|proprietorships]]. Corporations have established a homogeneous global playing field around which they can freely move raw materials, labor, capital, finished products, tax-paying obligations, and profits. Thus, corporate franchise has become a perpetual grant of [[sovereignty]], including [[immortality]], [[Self-governance|self-government]], and [[limited liability]]. By the end of the twentieth century, corporate power—both economic and political—stretched worldwide. International agreements not only lowered [[tariff]]s but extended corporate [[Property|property rights]] and reduced the ability of sovereign nations to regulate corporations.{{sfn|Barnes|2006|p=}}

David Schweickart submits that such "hypermobility of capital" generates economic and political insecurity.{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}} "If the search for lower wages comes to dominate the movement of capital, the result will be not only a lowering of worldwide wage disparities (the good to which some economists point) but also a lowering of total global income (a straight-out utilitarian bad)."{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p=96}} Jack Rasmus, author of ''The War At Home'' and ''The Trillion Dollar Income Shift'', argues that the increasing concentration of corporate power is a cause of the large-scale debt, unemployment, and poverty characteristic of economic [[recession]] and [[depression (economics)|depression]]. According to Rasmus, income inequality in contemporary America increased as the relative share of income for corporations and the wealthiest one percent of households rose while income shares declined for 80-percent of the United States workforce. After rising steadily for three decades after World War II, the standard of living for most American workers has sharply declined between the mid-1970s to the present. Rasmus likens the widening income gap in contemporary American society to the decade leading up to the [[Great Depression]], estimating "well over $1 trillion in income is transferred annually from the roughly 90 million working class families in America to corporations and the wealthiest non-working-class households. While a hundred new billionaires were created since 2001, [[real wages|real weekly earnings]] for 100 million workers are less in 2007 than in 1980 when [[Ronald Reagan]] took office".

According to economist [[Richard D. Wolff]], the 1970s brought an end to the labor shortage which had facilitated more than a century of rising average [[real wage]]s in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard D. Wolff|Wolff, Richard D.]] (2012). ''[http://www.democracyatwork.info/ Democracy at Work: A Cure for Capitalism].'' [[Haymarket Books]]. {{ISBN|1608462471}}.

* "...the combination of computerization, exported jobs, women surging into the labor market, and a new wave of immigration ended the period of rising real wages in the United States."&lt;/ref&gt; Wolff says Americans responded to the resulting deficiency of effective demand by working more hours and excessive borrowing; the latter paving the way for the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]].&lt;ref name="Wolff 2012 46"&gt;[[Richard D. Wolff|Wolff, Richard D.]] (2012). ''[http://www.democracyatwork.info/ Democracy at Work: A Cure for Capitalism].'' [[Haymarket Books]]. {{ISBN|1608462471}}. [https://books.google.com/books?id=-QnzAAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA46#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.46]:
* "Across the 1980s and 1990s and up to 2007, US families worked and borrowed more and more, while real wages stagnated... When they began defaulting on their debts - the system crashed."&lt;/ref&gt;

According to David Harvey, "the export of capital and the cultivation of new markets around the world" is a solution "as old as capitalism itself" for the deficiency of effective demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harvey|first=David|title=The Enigma of Capital: And the Crises of Capitalism|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=USA|isbn=0199836841|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Imperialism, as defined by ''Dictionary of Human Geography'', is "the creation and/or maintenance of an unequal economic, cultural, and territorial relationship, usually between states and often in the form of an empire, based on domination and subordination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Johnston | first = Ronald John | year = 2000 |title = The Dictionary of Human Geography | edition = 4th | publisher =Wiley-Blackwell | page=375 | isbn = 0-631-20561-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; "These geographic shifts", according to David Harvey, "are the heart of uneven geographic development".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harvey|first=David|title=Reading Marx’s Capital Vol 1 – Class 12, Chapters 26-33|url=http://davidharvey.org/2008/09/capital-class-12/|work=Video Lecture|publisher=WordPress|accessdate=August 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vladimir Lenin]] viewed imperialism as the highest stage of capitalism. He asserted that the merging of banks and industrial cartels gave rise to finance capital, which was then exported (rather than goods) in pursuit of greater profits than the home market could offer. Political and financial power became divided among international monopolist firms and European states, colonizing large parts of the world in support of their businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lenin |first=Vladimir |title=Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism |year=1916 |place=London |publisher=Lawrence and Wishart}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to analyst Michael Parenti, imperialism is "the process whereby the dominant politico-economic interests of one nation expropriate for their own enrichment the land, labor, raw materials, and markets of another people."&lt;ref name="Parenti 1995 3"&gt;{{cite book |title=Against Empire |last=Parenti |first=Michael |year=1995 |publisher=City Lights Publishers |isbn=978-0-87286-298-2 |page=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Parenti says imperialism is older than capitalism. Given its expansionist nature, capitalism has little inclination to stay home. While he conceded imperialism is not typically recognized as a legitimate allegation about the United States, Parenti argued:

{{quote|Emperors and conquistadors were interested mostly in plunder and tribute, gold and glory. Capitalist imperialism differs from these earlier forms in the way it systematically accumulates capital through the organized exploitation of labor and the penetration of overseas markets. Capitalist imperialism invests in other countries, transforming and dominating their economies, cultures, and political life, integrating their financial and productive structures into an international system of capital accumulation.&lt;ref name="Parenti 1995 3"/&gt;|sign=|source=}}

In his book, ''The Political Struggle for the 21st century'', [[J. W. Smith|J.W. Smith]] examines the economic basis for the history of imperial civilization. On a global scale, he says developed nations tended to impede or prohibit the economic and technological advancement of weaker developing countries through the military force, martial law, and inequitable practices of trade that typically characterize [[colonialism]]. Rhetorically termed as "[[survival of the fittest]]", or "[[might makes right]]", such economic crises stem from the imbalances imposed by [[corporate imperialism]]. Just as cities in the [[Middle Ages]] monopolized the [[means of production]] by conquering and controlling the sources of raw materials and countryside markets, Smith claims that contemporary centers of capital now control our present world through private monopoly of public resources sometimes known as "the commons". Through inequalities of trade, developing countries are overcharged for import of manufactured goods and underpaid for raw material exports, as wealth is siphoned from the periphery of empire and hoarded at the imperial-centers-of-capital:

{{Quote|Over eight-hundred years ago the powerful of the city-states of Europe learned to control the resources and markets of the countryside by raiding and destroying others’ primitive industrial capital, thus openly monopolizing that capital and establishing and maintaining extreme inequality of pay. This low pay siphoned the wealth of the countryside to the imperial-centers-of-capital. The powerful had learned to plunder-by-trade and have been refining those skills ever since.{{sfn|Smith|2005|p=}}|sign=|source=}}

Smith goes on to say that, like other financial empires in history, the contemporary model forms alliances necessary to develop and control wealth, keeping peripheral nations impoverished providers of cheap resources for the imperial capital centers. Belloc estimated that, during the British Enclosures, "perhaps half of the whole population was [[Proletariat|proletarian]]", while roughly the other "half" owned and controlled the means of production. Under modern Capitalism, J.W. Smith claimed that fewer than 500 individuals possess more wealth than half of the earth's population. The wealth of 1/2 of 1-percent of the United States population roughly equals that of the lower 90-percent. {{sfn|Smith|2005|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}}

Richard Cook claimed that the United States maintained stability by economically dominating the world as a means of filling the gap between production and consumption. Beginning with loans to European combatants during World War I, and continuing through the [[lend-lease]] program of World War II, U.S. domination of trade peaked through economic recovery measures following those wars. Though forming the basis for U.S. prosperity during the 1950s and 1960s, U.S trade domination was exhausted by the mid-1970s, when the United States implemented a policy known as [[dollar hegemony]], intended to stabilize the economy.{{sfn|Cook, "Monetary Reform" Part 2|2007}}

== Alternative models ==

Advocating for an "alternative economic system free of capitalism's structural flaws",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wolff|first1=Richard D|title=Democracy At Work: A Cure For Capitalism|date=2012|publisher=Haymarket Books|location=Chicago, IL|isbn=978-1-60846-247-6|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; economist Richard D. Wolff says reform agendas are fundamentally inadequate, given that capitalist corporations, the dominant institutions of the existing system, retain the incentives and the resources to undo any sort of reform policy. For example, Wolff goes on to say:

{{quote|The [[New Deal]]–era taxes on business and the rich and [[regulation]]s of [[Entrepreneurship|enterprise]] behavior proved vulnerable and unsustainable. The enemies of the New Deal had the incentives ([[profit maximization]]) and the resources (their returns on investments) to undo many of its reforms after [[World War II]], with ever-greater effect in the period since the 1970s. They systematically evaded, then weakened, the taxes and regulations of the New Deal, and eventually, when politically possible, eliminated them altogether. Business profits funded the parties, politicians, public relations campaigns, and professional think tanks that together shaped the real social effects and historical decline of government economic regulation. Examples include the destruction of the [[Glass-Steagall Act]], the current assault on [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], the shift in the federal tax burden from business to individuals and from upper- to middle-income individuals, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wolff|first1=Richard D.|title=Democracy At Work: A Cure For Capitalism|date=2012|publisher=Haymarket Books|location=Chicago, IL|isbn=978-1-60846-247-6|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

According to David Schweickart, a serious critique of any problem cannot be content to merely note the negative features of the existing [[scientific modelling|model]]. Instead, we must specify precisely the structural features of an alternative: "But if we want to do more than simply denounce the evils of capitalism, we must confront the claim that 'there is no alternative'—by proposing one."{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p=45}} Schweickart argued that both full employment and guaranteed basic income are impossible under the restrictions of the U.S. economic system for two primary reasons: a) unemployment is an essential feature of capitalism, not an indication of systemic failure;{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p=97}} and b) while capitalism thrives under [[polyarchy]], it is not compatible with genuine democracy.{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p=151}} Assuming these "democratic deficits" significantly impact the management of both the workplace and new investment,{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p=46}} many proponents of economic democracy tend to favor the creation and implementation of a new economic model over reform of the existing one.

For example, [[Martin Luther King, Jr.|Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.]] claimed "Communism forgets that life is individual. Capitalism forgets that life is social, and the Kingdom of Brotherhood is found neither in the thesis of Communism nor the antithesis of Capitalism but in a higher synthesis. It is found in a higher synthesis that combines the truths of both".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.writespirit.net/inspirational_talks/political/martin_luther_king_talks/where_do_we_go_from_here/ |title=Where Do We Go From Here |first=Martin Luther Jr |last= King|work=writespirit.net | date = August 16, 1967 |accessdate=January 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the gap between productivity and purchasing power, Dr. King maintained:

{{quote|The problem indicates that our emphasis must be two-fold. We must create full employment or we must create incomes. People must be made consumers by one method or the other. Once they are placed in this position, we need to be concerned that the potential of the individual is not wasted. New forms of work that enhance the social good will have to be devised for those for whom traditional jobs are not available.{{sfn|King|1968|p=163}}|sign=|source=}}

According to historian and political economist, [[Gar Alperovitz]]: "King’s final judgment stands as instructive evidence of his understanding of the nature of systemic challenge — and also as a reminder that given the failures of both traditional socialism and corporate capitalism, it is time to get serious about clarifying not only the question of strategy, but what, in fact, the meaning of changing the system in a truly democratic direction might one day entail."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alperovitz|first1=Gar|title=What Then Must We Do?: Straight Talk About The Next American Revolution|date=2013|publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing|location=White River Junction, VT|isbn=978-160358-491-3|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trade unionist and social activist Allan Engler argued further that economic democracy was the working-class alternative to capitalism. In his book, "Economic Democracy", Engler stated:

{{quote|When economic democracy – a world of human equality, democracy and cooperation – is the alternative, capitalism will no longer be seen as a lesser evil. When the working class, not a revolutionary party, is the agency of social transformation, change will be based on workplace organization, community mobilizations and democratic political action. The goal will be to transform capitalism into economic democracy through gains and reforms that improve living conditions while methodically replacing wealth-holders' entitlement with human entitlement, capitalist ownership with community ownership and master-servant relations with workplace democracy.{{sfn|Engler|2010|p=8}}|sign=|source=}}

Assuming that "democracy is not just a political value, but one with profound economic implications, the problem is not to choose between [[Planned economy|plan]] and [[Market economy|market]], but to integrate these institutions into a democratic framework".&lt;ref name="Schweickart Essay"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Schweickart |first=David |title=Economic Democracy: A Worthy Socialism That Would Really Work |journal=Science &amp; Society |volume=56| issue=1 | pages=9–38|date=Spring 1992 |url=http://homepages.luc.edu/~dschwei/economicdemocracy.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like capitalism, economic democracy can be defined in terms of three basic features:

* Worker self-management: each productive enterprise is controlled democratically by its workers.
* Social control of investment: funds for new investment are returned to the economy through a network of public investment banks.{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}}
* The market: enterprises interact with one another and with consumers in an environment largely free of governmental price controls. Raw materials, instruments of production and consumer goods are all bought and sold at prices largely determined by the forces of supply and demand.

In real-world practice, Schweickart concedes economic democracy will be more complicated and less "pure" than his model. However, to grasp the nature of the system and to understand its essential dynamic, it is important to have a clear picture of the basic structure. Capitalism is characterized by private ownership of productive resources, the market, and wage labor. The Soviet economic model subordinated private ownership of productive resources to public ownership by collectivizing farms and factories. It further subordinated the market to central planning—but retained the institution of wage labor.{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p=47}}

Most proposed models for economic democracy generally begin with democratizing the workplace and the ownership of capital. Other proposals advocate replacing the market with some form of planning, as well.

=== Worker self-management ===
{{Main|Worker self-management}}In worker self-management, each productive enterprise is controlled by those who work there. Workers are responsible for the operation of the facility, including organization, discipline, production techniques, and the nature, price, and distribution of products. Decisions concerning distribution are made democratically. Problems of authority delegation are solved by democratic representation. Management is chosen by the worker, not appointed by the State, not elected by the community at large and not selected by a board of directors elected by [[stockholder]]s. Ultimate authority rests with the enterprise's workers, following the one-person, one-vote principle.{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|pp=47–48}}

According to veteran [[World Bank]] economic adviser [[David Ellerman|David P. Ellerman]] it's the [[employment contract]] that needs to be abolished, not private property. In other words, "a firm can be socialized and yet remain 'private' in the sense of not being government-owned."{{sfn|Ellerman|1990|p=56}} In his book, "The Democratic Firm", Ellerman stated:

{{quote|In the world today, the main form of enterprise is based on renting human beings ([[private company|privately]] or [[public enterprise|publicly]]). Our task is to construct the alternative. In the alternative type of firm, employment by the firm is replaced with membership in the firm. Economic democracy requires the abolition of the employment relation, not the abolition of [[private property]]. Democracy can be married with private property in the workplace; the result of the union is the democratic worker-owned firm.{{sfn|Ellerman|1990|pp=44–49}}|sign=|source=}}

Alternately, in Schweickart's model, workers control the workplace, but they do not "own" the means of production. Productive resources are regarded as the collective property of the society. Workers run the enterprise, use its capital assets as they see fit, and distribute the profits among themselves. Here, societal "ownership" of the enterprise manifests itself in two ways: 1) All firms pay tax on their [[capital asset]]s, which goes into society's investment fund. In effect, workers rent capital assets from society. 2) Firms are required to preserve the value of the [[capital stock]] entrusted to them. This means that a [[depreciation]] fund must be maintained to repair or replace existing capital stock. This money may be spent on capital replacements or improvements, but not to supplement workers' incomes. {{sfn|Schweickart|2002|pp=47–49}}

Italy's [[Legacoop]] and Spain's [[Mondragon Corporation|Mondragon]] multi-sectoral worker-cooperatives have both been able to reach significant scale and demonstrate long-term sustainability. According to a study conducted by [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], the greatest lesson to be learned from these European experiences is the importance of developing an economically integrated network of cooperatives rather than a single cooperative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hoyt|first1=Lorlene|last2=Luviene|first2=Nicholas|last3=Stitely|first3=Amy|title=Sustainable Economic Democracy: Worker Cooperatives for the 21st Century|url=http://web.mit.edu/colab/pdf/papers/Sustainable_Economic_Democracy.pdf|website=colab.mit.edu|publisher=MIT Community Innovators Lab  with support from the Barr Foundation|accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report goes on to say:

{{quote|In a market based economy the cooperative business form suffers from several strategic challenges when operating independently. One worker cooperative on its own is most likely doomed to fail in a highly competitive global economy. However, an ecosystem of several worker cooperatives and support organizations can create an infrastructure that leads to sustained growth and expansion. In Mondragon the cooperative network expanded from a single cooperative polytechnic school to a network of 256 industrial, retail, finance, educational, and research and development firms.}}

=== Social control of investment ===
While there is no single approach or 'blueprint' for social control of investment, many strategies have been proposed. For example, [[Gar Alperovitz]] claims many real-world strategies have already emerged to democratize and decentralize the ownership of wealth and capital. In addition to worker cooperatives, Alperovitz highlights ESOPs, [[credit union]]s and other cooperative forms, [[social enterprise]]s, municipally-owned utilities and [[public bank]]s as starting points for what he has termed a "[[Pluralist commonwealth|Pluralist Commonwealth]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alperovitz|first1=Gar|title=What Then Must We Do?: Straight Talk about the Next American Revolution|date=May 1, 2013|publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing|location=85 North Main Street, Suite 120, White River Junction, VT 05001|isbn=1603585044|pages=139–147|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternately, David Schweickart proposes a [[Flat tax|flat-rate tax]] on capital assets to replace all other business taxes. This "capital assets tax" is collected and invested by the central government. Funds are dispersed throughout society, first to regions and communities on a per capita basis, then to public banks in accordance with past performance, then to those firms with profitable [[project]] proposals. Profitable projects that promise increased employment are favored over those that do not. At each level, national, regional and local, legislatures decide what portion of their funds is to be used for public capital expenditures, then send the remainder to the next lower level. Associated with most banks are entrepreneurial divisions, which promote firm expansion and new firm creation. For large (regional or national) enterprises, local investment banks are complemented by regional and national investment banks. These too would be public institutions that receive their funds from the national investment fund.

Banks are public, not private, institutions that make [[Grant (money)|grants]], not loans, to business enterprises. According to Schweickart, these grants do not represent "free money", since an investment grant counts as an addition to the capital assets of the enterprise, upon which the capital-asset tax must be paid. Thus the capital assets tax functions as an interest rate. A bank grant is essentially a loan requiring [[interest]] payments but no repayment of [[Debt|principal]].{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p=56}}

While an economy of worker-self-managed enterprises might tend toward lower unemployment than under capitalism - because banks are mandated to consistently prioritize investment projects that would increase employment - Schweickart notes that it does not guarantee [[full employment]]. Social control of investment serves to increase employment. If the market provides insufficient employment, the public sector becomes the [[employer of last resort]]. The original formulation of the [[Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment Act|U.S. Humphrey-Hawkins Act of 1978]] assumed that only in this way could full employment be assured in a market economy. Economic Democracy adopts this approach. Social control of investment then blocks the cyclical unemployment typical of capitalism.{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|pp=135, 136}}

=== The market ===
Hungarian historian [[Karl Polanyi]] suggested that market economies should subordinate themselves to larger societal needs. He states that human-beings, the source of [[Labour (economics)|labor]], do not reproduce for the sole purpose of providing the market with workers. In [[The Great Transformation (book)|The Great Transformation]] Polanyi says that, while modern states and market economies tend to grow under capitalism, both are mutually interdependent for functional development. In order for market economies to be truly prosperous, he claims social constructs must play an essential role. Polanyi claimed that [[Land (economics)|land]], labor, and money are all [[commodities|commodified]] under capitalism, though the inherent purpose of these items was never intended "for sale"—what he labels "[[fictitious commodities]]." He says [[natural resources]] are "God-given", money is a bookkeeping entry validated by law, and labor is a human prerogative, not a personal obligation to market economies.

Schweickart's economic democracy is a form of [[market economy]], at least insofar as the allocation of [[consumer goods|consumer]] and [[capital goods]] is concerned. [[business entity|Firm]]s buy [[raw materials]] and machinery from other firms and sell their products to other enterprises or consumers. "Prices are largely [[Regulation|unregulated]] except by supply and demand, although in some cases price controls or price supports might be in order – as they are deemed in order in most real-world forms of capitalism."{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}}

Without a [[price mechanism]] sensitive to supply and demand, it is extremely difficult for a producer or planner to know what and how much to produce, and which production and marketing methods are the most efficient. Otherwise, it is difficult to motivate producers to be both efficient and [[Innovation|innovative]]. [[Competition (economics)|Market competition]] resolves these problems, to a significant if incomplete degree, in a [[Authoritarianism|non-authoritarian]], [[Bureaucracy|non-bureaucratic]] fashion.

Enterprises still strive to make a profit. However, "profit" in a worker-run firm is calculated differently than under capitalism. For a capitalist firm, labor is counted as a cost. For a worker-run enterprise it is not. Labor is not another "factor of production" on par with land and capital. Labor is the residual claimant. Workers get all that remains, once other costs, including depreciation set asides and the capital assets tax, have been paid.{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p=49}}

Because of the way workplaces and the investment mechanism are structured, Schweickart's model aims to facilitate [[fair trade]], not [[free trade]], between nations. Under Economic Democracy, there would be virtually no cross-border capital flows. Enterprises themselves would not relocate abroad, since they are democratically controlled by their own workers. [[Financial capital|Finance capital]] stays mostly at home, since funds for investment are publicly generated and are mandated by law to be reinvested domestically. "Capital doesn't flow into the country, either, since there are no [[stock]]s nor [[Bond (finance)|corporate bonds]] nor businesses to buy. The capital assets of the country are collectively owned – and hence not for sale."{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p=63}}

According to Michael Howard, "in preserving commodity exchange, a [[market socialism]] has greater continuity with the society it displaces than does nonmarket socialism, and thus it is more likely to emerge from capitalism as a result of tendencies generated within it." But Howard also suggested, "one argument against the market in socialist society has been that it blocks progress toward full communism or even leads back to capitalism".&lt;ref name="Rose In The Fist"&gt;{{cite book |last=Howard |first=Michael |title=Self-Management and the Crisis of Socialism: The Rose in the Fist of the Present |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc. |isbn=0-8476-8905-0 |year=2000 |page=76 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From this perspective, nonmarket models of economic democracy have also been proposed.

=== Economic democracy as part of an inclusive democracy ===
{{Main|Inclusive democracy}}
Economic democracy is described as an integral component of an [[inclusive democracy]] in Takis Fotopoulos' ''Towards An Inclusive Democracy'' as a stateless, moneyless and marketless economy that precludes private accumulation of wealth and the institutionalization of privileges for some sections of society, without relying on a mythical post-scarcity state of abundance, or sacrificing freedom of choice.

The proposed system aims to meet the basic needs of all citizens ([[macroeconomic]] decisions), and secure freedom of choice ([[microeconomic]] decisions). Therefore, the system consists of two basic elements: (1) democratic planning, which involves a feedback process between workplace assemblies, demotic assemblies and a confederal assembly, and (2) an artificial market using [[Labour voucher|personal vouchers]], which ensures [[choice|freedom of choice]] but avoids the adverse effects of real markets. Although David Pepper called this system "a form of money based on the labour theory of value",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Pepper | first = David | title = Modern environmentalism: An Introduction | publisher = Routledge | location = London; New York | year = 1996 | isbn = 978-0-415-05745-5 | page = 321}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is not a money model since vouchers cannot be used as a general medium of exchange and store of wealth.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Another distinguishing feature of inclusive democracy is its distinction between basic and non-basic needs. Remuneration is determined separately according to the cost of basic needs, and according to degree of effort for non-basic needs. Inclusive democracy is based on the principle that meeting basic needs is a fundamental human right which is guaranteed to all who are in a physical condition to offer a minimal amount of work. By contrast, [[participatory economics]] guarantees that basic needs are satisfied only for public goods or are covered by compassion and by a guaranteed basic income for the unemployed and those who cannot work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Albert  | first = Michael |title = Parecon: Life After Capitalism | publisher = Verso Books | location = New York | year = 2003 | pages = 37–38 | isbn = 978-1-85984-698-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many advocates of participatory economics and [[Participism]] have contested this.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

As part of inclusive democracy, economic democracy is the authority of demos (community) in the economic sphere—which requires equal distribution of economic power. Therefore, all macroeconomic decisions (overall level of production, consumption and investment, amounts of work and leisure implied, technologies to be used and so on) are made collectively and without representation. However, microeconomic decisions are made by the individual production or consumption unit through a proposed system of vouchers.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

As with the case of direct democracy, economic democracy is only feasible if the participants can easily cooperate.

== Reform agendas ==
While [[Reform movement|reform agendas]] tend to critique the existing system and recommend corrective measures, they do not necessarily suggest alternative models to replace the fundamental structures of capitalism; private ownership of productive resources, the market and wage labor.

=== Social credit ===
{{Main|Social credit}}
Rather than an economic shortfall, many analysts{{who|date=January 2012}} consider the gap between production and purchasing power a social dividend. In this view, credit is a [[public utility]] rather than debt to financial centers. Once reinvested in human productive potential, the [[Economic surplus|surplus]] of societal output could actually increase Gross Domestic Product rather than throttling it, resulting in a more efficient economy, overall.{{sfn|Cook, "Monetary Reform" Part 1|2007}} [[Social Credit]] is an economic reform movement that originates from theories developed by Scottish engineer Major [[C. H. Douglas]]. His aim to make societal improvement the goal of economic systems is reflected in the term "Social Credit", and published in his book, entitled ''Economic Democracy''. In this view, the term "economic democracy" does not mean worker control of industry.&lt;ref name="Douglas CP&amp;D"&gt;{{cite book |title=Credit-Power and Democracy |last=Douglas |first=C.H. |year=1933 |publisher=The Social Credit Press |location=Melbourne, Australia |pages=4–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While technological advancement tends to increase unemployment along with productivity, Douglas suggests that our perspective will determine whether this problem is a "catastrophe" or a "magnificent achievement":

{{quote|The so-called unemployment problem is really a problem of leisure. The problem really is a problem, first of the distribution of purchasing power to those who are not required, and will decreasingly be required, in the industrial system, and secondly, of ensuring that the total purchasing distributed shall always be enough to pay for the goods and services for sale.{{sfn|Cook, "C.H. Douglas"|2007}}|sign=|source=}}

A national dividend and a compensated price mechanism are the two most essential components of the Social Credit program. While these measures have never been implemented in their purest form, they have provided a foundation for Social Credit political parties in many countries and for reform agendas that retain the title, "economic democracy".

==== Credit as a public utility ====
Following Douglas and a reform program based on direct government spending set forth by groups such as the [[American Monetary Institute]], veteran Project Manager for the [[U.S. Treasury Department]], [[Richard C. Cook]] proposes two general measures, which together he terms, "economic democracy":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cook| first=Richard C.| year=07/02/2010 | title=Monetary Reform and How a National Monetary System Should Work| publisher=Global Research| url=http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=5615}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Credit as a public utility: "We should spend sufficient credit into existence to supply the basic operating expenses of government at all levels without recourse to either taxes or borrowing. At least ninety percent of all taxes could be eliminated. The only taxes that should be retained would be those in the form of user fees for infrastructure operations and maintenance and those levied only for dire emergencies. Capital expenses for infrastructure construction at the federal, state, and local levels should be financed through a self-capitalized national infrastructure bank lending at zero-interest. Operating on a national scale, such a bank could begin to rebuild our job base starting at the state and local levels. A public program of direct government expenditures as described herein would be as effective, as timely, far less inflationary, and much cheaper than creating new public debt by borrowing credit created 'out of thin air' by the banking system".{{sfn|Cook|2008|pp=128–129}}

[[File:GAP Chart from We Hold These Truths.jpg|thumb|320px|GAP Chart from [[We Hold These Truths: The Hope of Monetary Reform|''We Hold These Truths'']]]]

* A national dividend: "The endemic gap between prices and purchasing power in an advanced economic system in reality is the “leisure dividend” that we never received from our amazing producing economy. That gap should now be filled by a non-taxable national dividend of two types. One would be a cash stipend paid to all citizens which would also serve the purpose of eliminating poverty by providing everyone with a basic income guarantee. The remainder of the national dividend would consist of an overall pricing subsidy, whereby a designated proportion of all purchases, including home building expenses, would be rebated to consumers. The average national dividend per person would probably exceed $12,000 per year under today's economic conditions. It would be a calculated value charged against a government ledger but would be off-budget, with no need to finance it with taxation or borrowing".{{sfn|Cook|2008|pp=128–129}}

While Smith and others suggest an [[Crisis (economic)|economic crisis]] might be necessary to drive a movement toward large-scale economic democracy,{{sfn|Smith|2005|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}} {{sfn|Barnes|2006|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}} Cook argues that "most economic reform programs address symptoms, not causes":{{sfn|Cook, "Monetary Reform" Part 1|2007}}

{{quote|[[Monetary reform]] embraces the enormous productivity of modern industrial methods with approval and hope. But it identifies factors in the nature of industrial production at the level of the corporation as creating a chronic state of instability.{{sfn|Cook, "Monetary Reform" Part 1|2007}} The top priority of the reform program would be to use public credit to rebuild the producing economy which has been wrecked by the phony ideology of 'market' economics and the inept and self-serving manipulation of the money supply by the Federal Reserve and the banks.{{sfn|Cook, "Credit as a Public Utility" Part 2|2007}}|sign=|source=}}

Cook avoided [[Collectivism|collectivist]] solutions. Rather, he affirmed the value of "democratic capitalism," combined with a shift to more public control of credit, and suggested a new approach to achieving worldwide prosperity, starting with economic recovery in the United States. Cook's argument stemmed from prior success in the United States treating credit as a public utility, including [[Early American currency|colonial paper currencies]] which allowed an emerging American society to monetize the value of its goods and services, the [[Greenback (money)|Greenbacks]] issued by President [[Abraham Lincoln]] during the [[American civil war]], and the [[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]] (RFC) which moved to recapitalize failing state banks in rural areas and small towns during the [[Great Depression]]. While President [[Herbert Hoover]]'s efforts failed, Cook credits RFC programs with providing low interest loans to the railroad industry, farmers, exporters, state and local governments, and wartime industries over a period of at least 20 years.{{sfn|Cook|2008|pp=81–112}}

==== National dividend ====
Cook also proposed a national dividend, sometimes known as a [[Basic income|Basic Income Guarantee]] or "BIG", was advocated in the United States by economists, politicians and reformers, including [[Thomas Paine]], [[Milton Friedman]], Dr. [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], and [[John Kenneth Galbraith]]. Friedman originally proposed a [[negative income tax]] to support this system, but then opposed the bill because its revised implementation would have merely supplemented rather than replacing existing tax-structures. Cook suggested that racism might have been at the root of BIG's demise in the late 1960s, as "many beneficiaries of the program would have been African-American".{{sfn|Cook|2008|p=121}} In 2006, Representative [[Bob Filner]] (D-CA) proposed a modest basic income guarantee via an inflation-adjusted refundable tax credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/109th-congress/house-bill/5257 |title=H.R.5257 - Tax Cut for the Rest of Us Act of 2006, 109th Congress (2005-2006)|date=2 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the U.S. Basic Income Guarantee Network:

{{quote|The basic income guarantee (BIG) is a government insured guarantee that no citizen's income will fall below some minimal level for any reason. All citizens would receive a BIG without means test or work requirement. BIG is an efficient and effective solution to poverty that preserves individual autonomy and work incentives while simplifying government social policy. Some researchers estimate that a small BIG, sufficient to cut the poverty rate in half could be financed without an increase in taxes by redirecting funds from spending programs and tax deductions aimed at maintaining incomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=June 1, 2007|url=http://www.usbig.net/ |title=The U.S. Basic Income Guarantee Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Cook suggests existing U.S. (GDP) could support such a system. GDP of $12.98-trillion minus $9.21-trillion in purchasing power ("wages") equals a difference of $3.77-trillion. Distributed equally amongst United States citizens, Cook estimates a "National Dividend" of approximately $12,600 could be provided annually to every U.S. citizen. A primary function of monetary reform is to "provide sufficient individual income"—not merely "create jobs"—for American workers displaced by technological advancement, outsourcing, and other economic influences beyond their control. Funding of the National Dividend would be drawn from a national credit account, which would include all factors that generate production costs and create new capital assets. The national credit account could also be used for price subsidies to discourage manufacturers from cutting costs by shipping jobs overseas. 
Rather than [[Federal Reserve Note]]s, circulated only through debt payable to a bank with interest, the National Dividend would be "real money", based on the productive capacity of the economy expressed as GDP. Cook says, "it's important to realize that [[Social Credit]] is not a socialist system. Rather it is 'democratic capitalism,' in contrast to the 'finance capitalism' that has become so damaging".{{sfn|Cook, "US Economy on Life Support"|2007}} Rooted in the ideals of Social Credit, proposed by Douglas in the 1920s, Cook explains:

{{quote|The difference between a National Dividend and a basic income guarantee is that the dividend is tied to production and consumption data and may vary from year to year. During years that the dividend falls below a designated threshold, the balance of a basic income guarantee could be provided from tax revenues. But in a highly automated economy such as that of the U.S., the National Dividend would normally be sufficient.{{sfn|Cook, "Monetary Reform" Part 2|2007}}|sign=|source=}}

In his book, ''Capitalism 3.0'', Peter Barnes likens a "National Dividend" to the game of [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]], where all players start with a fair distribution of financial opportunity to succeed, and try to privatize as much as they can as they move around "the commons". Distinguishing the board game from real-world business, Barnes claims that "the top 5 percent of the population owns more [[property]] than the remaining 95 percent", providing the smaller minority with an unfair advantage of approximately "$5-trillion" annually, at the beginning of the game. Contrasting "redistribution" of income (or property) with "predistribution", Barnes argues for "propertizing" (without corporately privatizing) "the commons" to spread ownership universally, without taking wealth from some and giving it to others. His suggested mechanism to this end is the establishment of a "Commons Sector", ensuring payment from the Corporate Sector for "the commons" they utilize, and equitably distributing the proceeds for the benefit of contemporary and future generations of society.

One real-world example of such reform is in the U.S. State of [[Alaska]], where each citizen receives an annual share of the part of the state's oil revenues via the "[[Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend]]". Barnes suggests this model could extend to other states and nations because "we jointly own many valuable assets". As corporate pollution of common assets increased, the permits for such pollution would become more scarce, driving prices for those permits up. "Less pollution would equal more revenue", and over time, "trillions of dollars could flow into an American Permanent Fund".{{sfn|Barnes|2006|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}}

However, none of these proposals aspire to the mandates recommended by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.:

{{quote|Two conditions are indispensable if we are to ensure that the guaranteed income operates as a consistently progressive measure. First, it must be pegged to the median income of society, not the lowest levels of income. To guarantee an income at the floor would simply perpetuate welfare standards and freeze into the society poverty conditions. Second, the guaranteed income must be dynamic; it must automatically increase as the total social income grows. Were it permitted to remain static under growth conditions, the recipients would suffer a relative decline. If periodic reviews disclose that the whole national income has risen, then the guaranteed income would have to be adjusted upward by the same percentage. Without these safeguards a creeping retrogression would occur, nullifying the gains of security and stability.{{sfn|King|1968|p=164}}}}

Barnes deemed any such reform unlikely. Thomas Paine originally recommended a National Dividend to compensate for the brutality of British Enclosures, but his idea was never adopted.{{sfn|Barnes|2006|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}}

=== Monopoly power versus public utility ===
{{Main|J. W. Smith}}

Rather than superficially compensating for legalized inequities, Smith recommends abolishing or redefining property rights laws with particular respect for "the commons".{{sfn|Smith|2005|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}} According to Smith [[entitlement|exclusive title]] to natural resources and technologies should be converted to inclusive conditional titles—the condition being that society should collect rental values on all natural resources.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=2}} Smith suggests the basic principles of monopolization under feudalism were never abandoned, and residues of exclusive feudal property rights restrict the potential efficiency of capitalism in [[Western culture]]s.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}} He estimated that roughly 60 percent of American capital is little more than capitalized values of unearned wealth. He proposed that elimination of these monopoly values would double [[economic efficiency]], maintain [[quality of life]], and reduce [[Working time|working hours]] by half. Wasteful monetary flows could be stopped only by eliminating all methods of monopolization typical in Western economies.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=xiv}}

Smith divided "primary (feudal) monopoly" into four general categories: banking; land; technology and [[Telecommunication|communications]]. He listed three general categories of "secondary (modern) monopoly"; insurance, law, health care.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=14}} Smith further claimed that converting these exclusive entitlements to inclusive human rights would minimize battles for [[market share]], thereby eliminating most offices and staff needed to maintain monopoly structures, and stop the wars generated to protect them. Dissolving roughly half the economic activity of a monopoly system would reduce the costs of common resources by roughly half, and significantly minimize the most influential factors of poverty.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}}

In Smith's view, most taxes should be eliminated, and productive enterprise should be privately owned and managed.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=2, 187}} Inventors should be paid well and all technology placed in the public domain. Crucial services currently monopolized through [[License|licensing]] should be legislated as human rights.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=2, 13, 22, 90, 102, 113, 124, 220}}

Smith envisioned a balanced economy under a socially owned banking commons within an inclusive society with full and [[Social equality|equal rights]] for all.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=3}} Federated regions collect [[resource rent]]s on land and technology to a [[social fund]] to operate governments and care for social needs.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=17, 54}} Socially owned banks provide finance capital by creating debt-free money for social infrastructure and industry.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=xv}} Rental values return to society through expenditure on public infrastructures. Local labor is trained and employed to build and maintain water systems, sewers, roads, communication systems, railroads, ports, airports, post offices, and education systems.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=2, 84}} Purchasing power circulates regionally, as labor spends wages in consumption and governments spend resource rent and banking profits to maintain essential services.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=16–17}}

According to Smith, all monetary systems, including [[money market]]s, should function within [[fractional-reserve banking]].{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=15}} Financial capital should be the total savings of all citizens, balanced by primary-created money to fill any shortfall, or its destruction through increased reserve requirements to eliminate any surplus.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=16}} Adjustments of required reserves should facilitate the balance between building with socially created money or savings. Any shortage of savings within a socially owned banking system should be alleviated by simply printing it.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=13}}

=== Cooperatives ===
{{Main|Cooperative}}
A [[cooperative]] is an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly-owned and democratically-controlled enterprise. By various names, cooperatives play an essential role in all forms of Economic Democracy. Classified as either [[consumer cooperative]]s or [[worker cooperative]]s, the cooperative business model is fundamental to the interests of economic democracy.

According to the [[International Cooperative Alliance]]'s [[Statement on the Cooperative Identity]], "cooperatives are democratic organizations controlled by their members, who actively participate in setting policies and making decisions. Men and women serving as elected representatives are accountable to the membership. In primary cooperatives members have equal voting rights (one member, one vote) and cooperatives at other levels are also organized in a democratic manner."

==== Worker cooperatives ====
{{Main|Worker cooperative}}
According to the [[United States Federation of Worker Cooperatives]]: "Worker cooperatives are business entities that are owned and controlled by their members, the people who work in them. The two central characteristics of worker cooperatives are: 1) workers invest in and own the business and (2) decision-making is democratic, generally adhering to the principle of one worker-one vote." Worker cooperatives occupy multiple sectors and industries in the United States, mostly in the Northeast, the West Coast and the Upper Midwest, totaling 300 democratic workplaces in the United States, employing over 3,500 people and generating over $400 million in annual revenues. While a few are larger enterprises, most are small. Growing steadily between 1990 and 2010, technology and home health care experienced most of the recent increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=US Federation of Worker Cooperatives|title=About Worker Cooperatives|url=http://usworker.coop/aboutworkercoops|publisher=US Federation of Worker Cooperatives|accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Worker cooperatives generally employ an industrial model called [[workplace democracy]], which rejects the "master-servant relationship" implicit in the traditional employment contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ellerman|first=David P.|title=The Democratic Worker-Owned Firm: A New Model for the East and West|publisher=Unwin Hyman Limited (HarperCollins Academic)|location=London|isbn=0-04-445743-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Wilkinson and Pickett, neither ownership or participation alone are sufficient to establish democracy in the workplace. "[M]any share-ownership schemes amount to little more than incentive schemes, intended to make employees more compliant with management and sometimes to provide a nest-egg for retirement... To make a reliable difference to company performance, share-ownership has to be combined with more participative management methods." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilkinson|first=Richard|title=The Spirit Level|year=2009|publisher=Bloomsbury Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-60819-036-2|pages=248–249}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahl further argued that self-governing enterprises should not be confused with other systems they might resemble:

{{quote|Self-governing enterprises only remotely resemble pseudodemocratic schemes of employee consultation by management; schemes of limited employee participation that leave all critical decisions with a management elected by stockholders; or Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs) that are created only or primarily to provide corporations with low-interest loans, lower corporate income taxes, greater cash flow, employee pension plans, or a market for their stock, without, however, any significant changes in control.{{sfn|Dahl|1985|pp=92–93 }}|sign=|source=}}

In worker cooperatives, [[net income]] is called [[Economic surplus|surplus]] instead of [[Profit (accounting)|profit]] and is distributed among the members based on hours worked, seniority, or other criteria. In a worker cooperative, workers own their jobs, and therefore have a direct stake in the local environment and the power to conduct business in ways that benefit the community rather than destroying it. Some worker cooperatives maintain what is known as a “multiple bottom line”, evaluating success not merely in terms of net income, but also by factors like their sustainability as a business, their contribution to the community, and the happiness and longevity of their workers.&lt;ref name="usworker" /&gt;

Worker-control can take many forms depending on the size and type of the business. Approaches to decision-making include: an elected board of directors, elected managers, management job roles, no management at all, consensus, majority vote, or combinations of the above.&lt;ref name="usworker" /&gt; Participation in decision-making becomes the responsibility and privilege of each member.{{sfn|DeNies|2003}} In one variation, workers usually invest money when they begin working.&lt;ref name="usworker"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.usworker.coop/front |title=US Federation of Worker Cooperatives |work=usworker.coop |accessdate=January 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each member owns one share, which provides its owner with one vote in company decision-making. While membership is not a requirement of employment, only employees can become members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.canadianworker.coop/worker-co-op |title=What is a Worker Co-op? | publisher = Canadian Worker Co-op Federation |work=canadianworker.coop |year=2012 |accessdate=January 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kenneth W. Stikkers, the [[Mondragon Corporation|Mondragon cooperatives]] in the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque region]] of [[Spain]] have achieved a previously unknown level of economic democracy. Established in 1956, Mondragon has since become an economic model that transcends the capitalist-socialist dichotomy and thereby helps us to imagine creative solutions to current economic problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stikkers|first=Kenneth W.|title=Dewey and the Mondragon Cooperatives|journal=European Journal of Pragmatism and American Philosophy|year=2011|volume=3|series=2036-4091|issue=2|pages=195–197|url=http://lnx.journalofpragmatism.eu/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/stikkers.pdf|accessdate=10/02/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economist [[Richard D. Wolff]] argues that Mondragon is an example of "a stunningly successful alternative to the capitalist organization of production."&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard D. Wolff]] (June 24, 2012). [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/24/alternative-capitalism-mondragon "Yes, there is an alternative to capitalism: Mondragon shows the way."] ''[[The Guardian]].'' Retrieved 27 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Consumer cooperatives ====
{{Main|Consumer cooperative}}
A [[consumers' cooperative]] is owned by its customers for their [[mutual aid (organization)|mutual benefit]]. Oriented towards service rather than profit, consumers often provide capital to launch or purchase the enterprise. In practice, consumer cooperatives price goods and services at competitive market rates. The co-op returns profits to the consumer/owner according to a formula instead of paying a separate investor group.

In his book, ''From Mondragon To America'', Greg MacLeod argues that "in consumer cooperatives where the customer-members own the capital and the employees are subject to capital, the normal dynamic is the adversarial relationship of labor to capital. Sometimes the result is strikes of labor against management." In some cooperatives, however, consumer/owners are workers as well. For example, Mondragon has developed a large "hybrid" cooperative which sells groceries and furniture in Spain.

Consumer cooperatives vary in organization and operations, but typically follow the [[Rochdale Principles]]. Consumer cooperatives may also form [[Co-operative Federation]]s. These may take the form of [[Co-operative Wholesale Society|co-operative wholesale societies]], through which they collectively purchase goods at [[wholesale]] prices and, in some cases, cooperatively own factories. Alternatively, they may be members of [[Co-operative union]]s.

Consumer cooperatives are very different from "discount clubs," which charge annual fees in exchange for a discount on purchases. The club is not owned or governed by the members and profits go to investors, not to members.&lt;ref name="CooperativeGrocer"&gt;[http://www.cooperativegrocer.coop/cg_coops.html What is a Consumer Cooperative? – Cooperative Grocer] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217055607/http://www.cooperativegrocer.coop/cg_coops.html |date=December 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Food cooperatives =====
{{Main|Food cooperative}}Most food co-ops are consumer cooperatives that specialize in grocery products. Members patronize the store and vote in elections. The members elect a board of directors to make high-level decisions and recruit managers.&lt;ref name="CooperativeGrocer" /&gt; [[Food cooperatives]] were originally established to provide fresh, [[Organic food|organic produce]] as a viable alternative to packaged imports. The ideas of local and [[slow food]] production can help local farmers prosper, in addition to providing consumers with fresher products. But the growing ubiquity of organic food products in corporate stores testifies to broadening consumer awareness, and to the dynamics of global marketing.{{sfn|DeNies|2003}}

For example, associated with national and international cooperative communities, Portland Oregon cooperatives manage to survive market competition with corporate franchise. As Lee Lancaster, financial manager for Food Front, states, "cooperatives are potentially one democratic economic model that could help guide business decisions toward meeting human needs while honoring the needs of society and nature". He admits, however, it is difficult to maintain collaboration among cooperatives while also avoiding integration that typically results in centralized authority.{{sfn|DeNies|2003}}

=== Regional trading currencies ===
According to [[Thomas H. Greco, Jr.]], author of New Money for Healthy Communities "The pinnacle of power in today's world is the power to issue money. If that power can be democratized and focused in a direction which gives social and ecological concerns top priority, then there may yet be hope for saving the world". In this regard, he recommended the regionalization of currencies. Cook suggested that "under the [[Bretton Woods system]], the Federal Reserve acted as the world's central bank. This gave America enormous leverage over economic policies of its principal trading partners".{{sfn|Smith|2005|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}} Cook claimed that developing nations were susceptible to exploitation mainly because they have no independent monetary system, using the U.S. dollar instead. This fed the fractional reserve banking system, operated by the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Japan. Developing nations paid heavily for this service through market interest rates and because banking profits and property ownership emigrate to financial centers elsewhere.{{sfn|Cook, "US Immigration Crisis"|2007}}

According to Smith, "Currency is only the representation of wealth produced by combining land (resources), labor, and industrial capital". He claimed that no country was free when another country has such leverage over its entire economy. But by combining their resources, Smith claimed that developing nations have all three of these foundations of wealth:

{{quote|By peripheral nations using the currency of an imperial center as its trading currency, the imperial center can actually print money to own industry within those periphery countries. By forming regional trading blocs and printing their own trading currency, the developing world has all four requirements for production, resources, labor, industrial capital, and finance capital. The wealth produced provides the value to back the created and circulating money.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}}}

Smith further explained that developed countries need resources from the developing world as much as developing countries need finance capital and technology from the developed world. Aside from the superior military power of the imperial centers, the undeveloped world actually has superior bargaining leverage. With independent trading currencies, developing countries could barter their resources to the developed world for the latest industrial technologies. Barter avoids "hard money monopolization"{{clarify|date=January 2012}} and the unequal trade between weak and strong nations that result. Smith suggested that barter was how Germany resolved many financial difficulties "put in place to strangle her", and that "World Wars I and II settled that trade dispute". He claimed that their intentions of exclusive entitlement were clearly exposed when the imperial centers resorted to military force to prevent such barter and maintain monopoly control of others' resources.{{sfn|Smith|2005|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}}

=== Democratizing workplaces and distributing productive assets ===
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2018}}

==== The Workplace as a political entity to be democratized ====
Workplace democracy has been cited as a possible solution to the problems that arise from excluding employees from decision-making such as low-employee morale, employee alienation, and low employee engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://arno.uvt.nl/show.cgi?fid=122513|title=An Alternative Organizational Model: Workplace Democracy|last=van der Vliet|first=Merijn|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political theorist Isabelle Ferreras argues that there exists “a great contradiction between the democratic nature of our times and the reality of the work experience.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Firms as Political Entities: Saving Democracy through Economic Bicameralism|last=Ferreras|first=Isabelle|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2017|isbn=9781108245043|location=|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; She argues that the modern corporation's two basic inputs, capital and labor, are treated in radically different ways. Capital owners of a firm wield power within a system of shareholder democracy that allocates voice democratically according to how much capital investment they place in the firm. Labor, on the other hand, rarely benefits from a system to voice their concerns within the firm. She argues that firms are more than just economic organizations especially given the power that they wield over people's livelihoods, environment, and rights. Rather, Ferreras holds that firms are best understood as political entities. And as political entities “it is crucial that firms be made compatible with the democratic commitments of our nations.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Germany and to a lesser extent the broader European Union have experimented with a way of workplace democracy known as Co-determination, a system that allows workers to elect representatives that sit on the board of directors of a company. Common criticisms of workplace democracy include that democratic workplaces are less efficient than hierarchical workplace, that managers are best equipped to make company decisions since they are better educated and aware of the broader business context.

==== Creating a widespread distribution of productive assets ====
One of the biggest criticisms against capitalism is that it concentrates economic and, as a result, political power in few hands. Theorists of economic democracy have argued that one solution to this unequal concentration of power is to create mechanism that distribute ownership of productive assets across the entire population. In ''Justice as Fairness: A Restatement'', John Rawls argues that only two systems could embody the main features of his principles of justice: liberal socialism or a property-owning democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/45388455|title=Justice as fairness : a restatement|last=1921-2002.|first=Rawls, John,|date=2001|publisher=Harvard University Press|others=Kelly, Erin.|isbn=0674005104|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=45388455}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within property-owning democracy Rawls envisions widespread use of worker-owned cooperatives, partial-employee ownership of firms, systems to redistribute one's asset after death to prevent the accumulation of wealth, as well as a strong system of asset-based redistribution that encourages workers to own productive assets.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Samuel. "'Rawls and Property-Owning Democracy'." In Unpacking Rawls, edited by Nicola Riva., 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Operating under the idea that making ownership more widespread leads to more equitable outcomes various proposals of asset-based welfare and asset-redistribution have been conceived. Individualistic and liberal asset-based welfare strategies such as the United Kingdom's Child Trust Fund of the United States Individual Development Account aimed to help people save money so that it could be invested on education, home-ownership, or entrepreneurship. More expirmental and left-leaning proposals include worker owned cooperatives, ESOPS, or Roemers coupon socialism.

== Critiques ==
[[Ludwig von Mises]] argued that ownership and control over the [[means of production]] belongs to private firms and can only be sustained by means of consumer choice, exercised daily in the marketplace.{{sfn|Mises|1953|loc=preface; p. 443}} "The capitalistic social order", he claimed, therefore "is an economic democracy in the strictest sense of the word".{{sfn|Mises|2006|p=158}} Critics of this claim point out that consumers only vote on the value of the product when they make a purchase—they are not participating in the management of firms, or voting on how the profits are to be used.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21449">'''Engineering management''' is the application of the practice of [[management]] to the practice of [[engineering]].

Engineering management is a career that brings together the technological problem-solving ability of [[engineering]] and the organizational, administrative, and planning abilities of [[management]] in order to oversee the operational performance of complex engineering driven enterprises. A [[Master of Engineering Management]] (MEM) is sometimes compared to a [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) for professionals seeking a graduate degree as a qualifying credential for a career in engineering management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gordon.tufts.edu/programs/m-s-in-engineering-management/msem-vs-mba|title=MSEM vs. MBA - Gordon Institute|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Stevens Institute of Technology]] is believed to have the oldest engineering management department, established as the School of Business Engineering in 1908. This was later called the Bachelor of Engineering in Engineering Management (BEEM) program and moved into the School of Systems and Enterprises. Drexel University established the first graduate engineering management degree in the U.S., which was first offered in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drexel.edu/egmt/about/history/|title=History - Engineering Management|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967 the first university department explicitly titled "Engineering Management" was founded at the [[Missouri University of Science and Technology]] (Missouri S&amp;T, formerly the University of Missouri-Rolla, formerly Missouri School of Mines). In 1959, [[Western Michigan University]] began offering the predecessor to the modern engineering management bachelor's degree (titled "Industrial Supervision") and in 1977, WMU started its MS degree in Manufacturing Administration, later renamed as Engineering Management. 

Outside the USA, in Germany the first department concentrating on Engineering Management was established 1927 in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vwi.org/hauptmenue/beruf-studium/wirtschaftsingenieurwesen/geschichte-und-bedeutung.html|title=Geschichte und Bedeutung - vwi.org|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Turkey the [[Istanbul Technical University]] has a Management Engineering Department established in 1982, offering a number of graduate and undergraduate programs in Management Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.end.itu.edu.tr/tarihce.html&lt;/ref&gt; In UK the [[University of Warwick]] has a specialised department [[Warwick Manufacturing Group|WMG]] (previously known as [[Warwick Manufacturing Group]]) established in 1980, which offers a graduate programme in MSc Engineering Business Management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/wmg/education/wmgmasters/courses/masters_engineering_business_management|title=MSc Engineering Business Management - University of Warwick|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michigan Technological University]] began an Engineering Management program in the School of Business &amp; Economics in the Fall of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtu.edu/registrar/students/major-degree/audit/business/|title=School of Business Audit Forms - The Registrar's Office|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, [[Memorial University of Newfoundland]] has started a complete master's degree Program in Engineering Management.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engr.mun.ca/graduate/course/mem.php Master of Engineering Management]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Denmark, the [[Technical University of Denmark]] offers a MSc program in Engineering Management (in English).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtu.dk/english/Education/msc/Programmes/engineering_management MSc in Engineering Management].&lt;/ref&gt;

In Pakistan, [[University of Engineering and Technology, Taxila]], [[University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore]] and [[National University of Sciences and Technology, Pakistan|National University of Science and Technology]] (NUST) offer admission both at Master and Doctorate level in Engineering Management while [[Capital University of Science &amp; Technology]] (CUST), NED University of Engineering &amp; Technology, Karachi and Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology have been running a Master of Engineering/MS in Engineering Management program. A variant of this program is within Quality Management. COMSATS (CIIT) offers a MSc Project Management program to Local and Overseas Pakistanis as an on-campus/off-campus student.

In Italy, [[Politecnico di Milano]] offers degrees in Management Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dig.polimi.it/index.php?id=37&amp;L=2|title=Studies in Management, Economics and Industrial Engineering|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Russia, since 2014 the Faculty of Engineering Management of The [[Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration]] (RANEPA) offers bachelor and master degrees in Engineering Management.

In France, the  [http://www.epf.fr/en EPF] will offer, from January 2018, a 2 year Engineering &amp; Management major in English for the 4th and 5th years of its 5 year Engineering Master’s degree.  The final 2 years are open to students who have completed an undergraduate engineering degree elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epf.fr/en/studies/majors/engineering-management-major-paris-campus EPF:Engineering Management Paris Campus]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas==

=== Operations management, operations research, and supply chain management ===
[[Operations management]] is concerned with designing and controlling the process of production and redesigning business operations in the production of goods or services. [[Operations research]] deals with quantitative models of complex operations and uses these models to support [[decision-making]] in any sector of industry or public services. [[Supply chain management]] is the process of planning, implementing and managing the flow of goods, services and related information from the point of origin to the point of consumption.&lt;ref name="UWMGTE"&gt;[http://www.mansci.uwaterloo.ca/mgte/index.php University of Waterloo], Management Engineering.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Management of technology ===
The [[Technology management|Management of Technology]] (MOT) theme builds on the foundation of management topics in [[accounting]], [[finance]], [[economics]], [[organizational behavior]] and organizational design. Courses in this theme deal with operational and organizational issues related to managing [[innovation]] and technological change.&lt;ref name="UWMGTE"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gordon.tufts.edu/programs/m-s-in-engineering-management/program-structure|title=Program Structure - Gordon Institute|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New product development and product engineering ===
[[New product development]] (NPD) is the complete process of bringing a new product to market. [[Product engineering]] refers to the process of designing and developing a device, assembly, or system such that it be produced as an item for sale through some production manufacturing process. Product engineering usually entails activity dealing with issues of cost, producibility, quality, performance, reliability, serviceability, intended lifespan and user features. [[Project Management]] techniques are used to manage the design and development progress using the [[phase-gate model]] in the product development process. [[Design for manufacturability]] (also sometimes known as design for manufacturing or DFM) is the general engineering art of designing products in such a way that they are easy to manufacture.

=== Systems engineering ===
[[Systems engineering]] is an interdisciplinary field of engineering and engineering management that focuses on how to design and manage complex systems over their life cycles.

=== Industrial engineering ===
[[Industrial engineering]] is a branch of engineering which deals with the optimization of complex processes, systems or organizations. Industrial engineers work to eliminate waste of time, money, materials, man-hours, machine time, energy and other resources that do not generate value.

=== Management science ===
[[Management science]] uses various scientific research-based principles, strategies, and analytical methods including [[mathematical modeling]], statistics and numerical algorithms to improve an organization's ability to enact rational and meaningful management decisions by arriving at optimal or near optimal solutions to complex decision problems

==Education==
Engineering management programs typically include instruction in [[accounting]], [[economics]], [[finance]], [[project management]], [[systems engineering]], [[industrial engineering]], [[mathematical model]]ing and optimization, [[management information systems]], [[quality control]] &amp; [[six sigma]], [[operations management]], [[operations research]], [[human resources management]], industrial [[psychology]], [[safety]] and [[health]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2002/cip2000/occupationallookup6d.ASP?CIP=15.1501 U.S. Department of Education Institute of Education Sciences: Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP)] - Retrieved on October 26, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://atmae.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=227&amp;Itemid=48 ATMAE Membership Venn Diagram] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113190247/http://atmae.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=227&amp;Itemid=48 |date=2013-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many options for entering into engineering management, albeit that the foundation requirement is an [[engineering degree]] (or other [[computer science]], [[mathematics]] or [[science]] degree) and a [[business degree]].

'''Undergraduate degrees'''

Although most engineering management programs are geared for graduate studies, there are a few elite institutions that teach EM at the undergraduate level.  Some of the ones that are accredited and/or recognized by ASEM include: West Point ([[United States Military Academy]]), [[Norwich University]], [[Western Michigan University]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wmich.edu/edmms/academics/undergraduate/engmanagementtech&lt;/ref&gt; (ABET-accredited by ETAC of ABET), [[New York Institute of Technology]], [[Stevens Institute of Technology]], [[Illinois Institute of Technology]], [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]], [[George Washington University]], [[Arizona State University]], [[Missouri University of Science and Technology]]. Graduates of these programs regularly command nearly $65,000 their first year out of school.&lt;ref name="Stevens Institue of Technology"&gt;{{cite web|title=Accepted Salary Offers |url=http://www.stevens.edu/sit/admissions/careers/2010-Career-Outcomes.cfm |work=Class of 2010 Career Outcomes |accessdate=18 May 2011 |author=Stevens Institute of Technology |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120409114519/http://www.stevens.edu/sit/admissions/careers/2010-Career-Outcomes.cfm |archivedate=9 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside the USA, [[Istanbul Technical University]] Management Engineering Department offers an undergraduate degree in Management Engineering,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isl.itu.edu.tr/isletmeLisansProgramlarEN.htm&lt;/ref&gt; attracting top students. The [[University of Waterloo]] offers a 4-year undergraduate degree (5 years including co-op education) in the field of Management Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mansci.uwaterloo.ca/mgte/index.php Management Engineering]&lt;/ref&gt; This is the first program of its kind in Canada. In Peru, Pacifico University offers a five-year undergraduate degree in this field, the first program in this country. In Germany, [[ESB Business School]]&lt;ref&gt;[[ESB Business School]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=January 2018}} offers a 4-year undergraduate program which consists of five semesters at [[ESB Business School]], two mandatory internships, one is mandatory to be in another country than Germany, and also one mandatory semester abroad. In the annual applied university ranking of the magazine [[Wirtschaftswoche]], the [[Engineering Management]] course of [[ESB Business School]] is ranked on place five of all applied universities in Germany&lt;ref&gt;https://www.esb-business-school.de/fakultaet/aktuelles/detail/artikel/bwl-absolventen-der-esb-auf-platz-eins/&lt;/ref&gt;. The magazine surveyed more than 500 recruiters in the German industry from which university they are most likely to recruit students and which universities satisfy their needs regarding experience in working with projects, multilingual education, and ability to communicate most.

'''Graduate degrees'''
{{main|Master of Engineering Management}}
Many universities offer Master of Engineering Management degrees. Missouri S&amp;T is credited with awarding the first Ph.D. in Engineering Management in 1984. The [[National Institute of Industrial Engineering]] based in [[Mumbai]] has been awarding degrees in the field of Post Graduate Diploma in Industrial Engineering since 1973 and the Fellowship (Doctoral) degrees have been awarded since 2008. 

[[Western Michigan University]] began offering the MS in Manufacturing Administration degree in 1977 and later renamed the degree as Master of Science in Engineering Management&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wmich.edu/ieeem/academics/masters&lt;/ref&gt;. WMU's MSEM alumni work in the automotive, medical, manufacturing, and service sectors, often in roles of project manager, engineering manager, and senior leadership in engineering and technical organizations.

Cornell University started one of the first Engineering Management Masters programs in 1988 with the launch of their Master of Engineering (M.Eng.) in Engineering Management. The program allows students access to courses and programs in the College of Engineering, Johnson School of Management, and across Cornell University more broadly. 

Netaji Subhas Institute of technology (NSIT, website as http://www.nsit.ac.in/ under University of Delhi)New Delhi also provides M.tech degree in Engineering management.Admission to this program happens through GATE(Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering)examination.

Massachusetts Institute of Technology offers a Master in System Design and Management, which is a member of the Consortium of Engineering Management.

Students in the University of Kansas' Engineering Management Program are practicing professionals employed by over 100 businesses, manufacturing, government or consulting firms. There are over 200 actively enrolled students in the program and approximately 500 alumni.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emgt.ku.edu/key-aspects|title=Key Aspects - Engineering Management|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Istanbul Technical University]] Management Engineering Department offers a graduate degree,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isl.itu.edu.tr/isletmeYuksekLisansProgramlarEN.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and a Ph.D. in Management Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isl.itu.edu.tr/isletmeDoktoraProgramlarEN.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[American Society for Engineering Education]] (ASEE) PRISM Magazine (March 2008) the largest Master's of Engineering Management (MEM) programs (in terms of degrees awarded for 2005–2006) are shown in the following chart.

==Management engineering consulting==
Large and small engineering driven firms often require the expertise of external [[management consultant]]s that specialize in companies where engineering practice and product development are key drivers of value.  Most engineering management consultants will have as a minimum a [[professional engineering]] qualification.  But usually they will also have graduate degrees in engineering and or business or a [[management consulting]] designation.  It involves providing [[management consulting]] service that is specific to professional [[engineering]] practice or to the engineering industry sector.  Engineering management consultancies, are typically boutique firms and have a more specialized focus than the traditional mainstream consulting firms, [[A T Kearney]], [[Boston Consulting Group]], [[KPMG]], [[PWC]], and [[McKinsey &amp; Company|McKinsey]]. [[Applied science]] and [[engineering]] practice requires a holistic approach involving a combination of management art, science, and engineering practice. There are many professional service companies delivering services in a consultancy type relationship to the engineering industry, including [[law]], [[accounting]], [[human resources]], [[marketing]], [[politics]], [[economics]], [[finance]], [[Public administration|public affairs]], and [[communication]].  Commonly, engineering management consultants are used when firms require a combination of special [[Technology|technical]] knowledge, and [[management]] know how, to enhance [[knowledge]] or transform organizational performance and also keep any [[intellectual property]] developed confidential.

Engineering management consulting is concerned with the development, improvement, implementation and evaluation of integrated systems of organizations, people, money, knowledge, information, equipment, energy, materials and/or processes.  Management Engineering Consultants strive to improve upon existing organizations, processes, products or systems. Engineering management consulting draws upon the principles and methods of engineering analysis and synthesis, as well as the mathematical, physical and [[social sciences]] together with the principles and methods of engineering design to specify, predict, and evaluate the results to be obtained from such systems or processes. Engineering management consulting can focus on the social impact of the product, process or system that is being analyzed.  There is also an overlap between engineering management consulting and [[management science]] in services that require the adoption of more analytical approaches to problem solving.

Examples of where engineering management consulting might be used include developing and leading a company wide [[business transformation]] initiative, or designing and implementing a [[new product development]] process, designing and implementing a [[manufacturing engineering]] process, including an automated assembly workstation.  Management engineers may specialize in the acquisition and implementation of [[Computer aided design]] (CAD), [[Computer-aided manufacturing]] (CAM) and [[Computer-aided engineering]] (CAE) applications.  Services may include strategizing for various operational logistics, new product introductions, or consulting as an efficiency expert.  It may include using [[management science]] techniques to develop a new financial algorithm or loan system for a bank, streamlining operation and emergency room location or usage in a hospital, planning complex distribution schemes for materials or products (referred to as [[Supply Chain Management]]), and shortening lines (or [[queueing theory|queues]]) at a bank, hospital, or a theme park.  Management engineering consultants typically use [[computer simulation]] (especially [[discrete event simulation]]), along with extensive mathematical tools and modeling and computational methods for system analysis, evaluation, and optimization.

==Professional organizations==
There are a number of societies and organizations dedicated to the field of engineering management. One of the largest societies is a division of IEEE, the Engineering Management Society, which regularly publishes a trade magazine. Another prominent professional organization in the field is the American Society for Engineering Management (ASEM), which was founded in 1979 by a group of 20 engineering managers from industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asem.org|title=American Society for Engineering Management - Home|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ASEM currently certifies engineering managers (two levels) via the Associate Engineering Manager (AEM) or Professional Engineering Manager (PEM) certification exam. The Master of Engineering Management Programs Consortium is a newly formed consortium of prominent universities intended to raise the value and visibility of the MEM degree.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mempc.org Master of Engineering Management Programs Consortium ]&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, engineering management university programs have the possibility of being accredited by [[Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology|ABET]], [[Association of Technology, Management, and Applied Engineering|ATMAE]], or ASEM. In Canada, the Canadian Society for Engineering Management (CSEM) is a constituent society of the Engineering Institute of Canada (EIC), Canada's oldest learned engineering society.

==History==
Free Dirt Records was founded while John Smith was working at [[Smithsonian Folkways]].&lt;ref name="Kithfolk"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leger|first1=Devon|title=Growing Up with Utah Phillips: Nevada City, Erica Haskell, and Utah’s West Coast Legacy|url=http://www.kithfolk.com/kithfolk-blog/2015/8/18/growing-up-with-utah-phillips|website=KITHFOLK|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There he collaborated with an intern named Erica Haskell&lt;ref name="Jackson Free Press"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McLaughlin|first1=Lacey|title=Erica Haskell|url=http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2009/oct/08/erica-haskell/|website=Jackson Free Press|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; on a box set of spoken word recordings by singer and storyteller [[Utah Phillips]].&lt;ref name="Kithfolk" /&gt; After that project, Smith and Haskell decided to create a label where they could work with young artists making traditional music and showcase often overlooked material like spoken word. The label's first official release was by the traditional Bosnian group [[Mostar Sevdah Reunion]]. Since 2006, the label has released music by [[Pokey LaFarge]],&lt;ref name="Riverfront Times"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Horn|first1=Nick|title=Pokey LaFarge on His Rounder Records Debut, Something in the Water|url=http://www.riverfronttimes.com/musicblog/2015/04/22/pokey-lafarge-on-his-rounder-records-debut-something-in-the-water|website=Riverfront Times|accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anna &amp; Elizabeth,&lt;ref name="Vice"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adams|first1=Mason|title=LISTEN TO ANNA &amp; ELIZABETH'S SPOOKY NEW TAKE ON AN OLD APPALACHIAN MURDER BALLAD|url=http://noisey.vice.com/blog/murder-ballad-stream|website=Vice|accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hackensaw Boys]], [[Julian Lage]] &amp; [[Chris Eldridge]] (Grammy-nominated), Cahalen Morrison, [[Dori Freeman]],&lt;ref name="Virginia Songbird"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wicks|first1=Amanda|title=THE VIRGINIA SONGBIRD TAKES FLIGHT: A CONVERSATION WITH DORI FREEMAN|url=http://www.thebluegrasssituation.com/read/virginia-songbird-takes-flight-conversation-dori-freeman|website=The Bluegrass Situation|accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Two Man Gentlemen Band]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prescription Drugs (We're Having A Party!)|url=https://www.discogs.com/Two-Man-Gentlemen-Band-Prescription-Drugs-Were-Having-A-Party/release/3789305|website=Discogs|accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free Dirt also works with [[PM Press]] to co-release spoken word and folk music. Together they've put out lectures by [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Howard Zinn]] and music from [[Chumbawamba]], [[Leon Rosselson]] and [[Robb Johnson]], among others.

&lt;!-- Society and culture --&gt;
Gentamicin was discovered in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pucci|first1=edited by Thomas Dougherty, Michael J.|last2=Weinstein|first2=Marvin J.|title=Handbook of antibiotic discovery and development|date=2011|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=9781461413998|page=238|edition=2012|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=E6Dv5XsXU-IC&amp;pg=PA238|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311020543/https://books.google.ca/books?id=E6Dv5XsXU-IC&amp;pg=PA238|archivedate=2016-03-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is made from the bacteria ''[[Micromonospora purpurea]]''.&lt;ref name=AHFS2015/&gt; Gentamicin is on the [[World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines]], the most effective and safe medicines needed in a [[health system]].&lt;ref name=WHO19th&gt;{{cite web|title=WHO Model List of Essential Medicines (19th List)|url=http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/essentialmedicines/EML_2015_FINAL_amended_NOV2015.pdf?ua=1|work=World Health Organization|accessdate=8 December 2016|date=April 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161213052708/http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/essentialmedicines/EML_2015_FINAL_amended_NOV2015.pdf?ua=1|archivedate=13 December 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is available as a [[generic medication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burchum|first1=Jacqueline|title=Lehne's pharmacology for nursing care|date=2014|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=9780323340267|page=1051|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=C7_NBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1052|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311015121/https://books.google.ca/books?id=C7_NBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1052|archivedate=2016-03-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The injectable's wholesale cost in the [[developing world]] in 2014 was between [[United States dollar|US$]]0.05 and US$0.58 per ml.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gentamicin sulfate|url=http://mshpriceguide.org/en/single-drug-information/?DMFId=369&amp;searchYear=2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180122072149/http://mshpriceguide.org/en/single-drug-information/?DMFId=369&amp;searchYear=2014|dead-url=yes|archive-date=22 January 2018|website=International Drug Price Indicator Guide|accessdate=15 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical uses==
Active against a wide range of bacterial infections, mostly Gram-negative bacteria including ''[[Pseudomonas]]'', ''[[Proteus (bacterium)|Proteus]]'', ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', ''[[Klebsiella pneumoniae]]'', ''Enterobacter aerogenes'', ''[[Serratia]]'', and the Gram-positive ''[[Staphylococcus]]''.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.baxter.ca/en/downloads/product_information/GENTAMICIN(E)_PM_AUG282012_EN.pdf|title = Gentamicin|accessdate = 2 November 2015|publisher = Baxter Corporation|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304124731/http://www.baxter.ca/en/downloads/product_information/GENTAMICIN(E)_PM_AUG282012_EN.pdf|archivedate = 4 March 2016|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gentamicin is used in the treatment of respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, blood, bone and soft tissues infections of these susceptible bacteria.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.sandoz.ca/cs/groups/public/@sge_ca/documents/document/n_prod_1301121.pdf|title = Product Monograph|accessdate = 2 November 2015|publisher = Sandoz Canada Inc|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150412102019/http://www.sandoz.ca/cs/groups/public/%40sge_ca/documents/document/n_prod_1301121.pdf|archivedate = 12 April 2015|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is insufficient evidence to support gentamicin as the first line treatment of ''[[Neisseria gonorrhea]]'' infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Emma|first1=Hathorn|last2=Divya|first2=Dhasmana|last3=Lelia|first3=Duley|last4=Jonathan|first4=DC Ross|title=The effectiveness of gentamicin in the treatment of Neisseria gonorrhoeae: a systematic review|journal=Systematic review|date=2014|volume=3|pages=104|doi=10.1186/2046-4053-3-104|pmid=25239090|pmc=4188483}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Gentamicin is not used for ''[[Neisseria meningitidis]]'' or ''[[Legionella pneumophila]]'' bacterial infections (because of the risk of the person going into shock from lipid A [[endotoxin]] found in certain Gram-negative organisms). Gentamicin is also useful against ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'', its relatives, and ''[[Francisella tularensis]]'' (the organism responsible for [[Tularemia]] seen often in hunters and/or trappers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Goljan|first = Edward F.|title = Rapid Review Pathology|edition = 3rd|year = 2011|publisher = Elsevier|location = Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|isbn = 978-0-323-08438-3|pages = 241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some ''[[Enterobacteriaceae]]'', ''[[Pseudomonas]] spp.'', ''[[Enterococci]]'', ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' and other ''[[Staphylococci]]'' are resistant to gentamicin sulfate, to varying degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Gentamicin spectrum of bacterial susceptibility and Resistance|url = http://www.toku-e.com/Upload/Products/PDS/20120604005203.pdf|accessdate = 15 May 2012|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150220033338/http://www.toku-e.com/Upload/Products/PDS/20120604005203.pdf|archivedate = 20 February 2015|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adverse effects==
Adverse effects of gentamicin can range from less severe reactions such as nausea and vomiting to more severe reactions such as:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* Low blood counts
* [[Hypersensitivity|Allergic responses]] 
* [[Neuromuscular disease|Neuromuscular]] problems
* [[neuropathy|Nerve damage]] 
* [[Nephrotoxicity|Kidney damage (nephrotoxicity)]]
* [[Ototoxicity|Ear disorders (ototoxicity)]]
[[Nephrotoxicity]] and [[ototoxicity]] are thought to be dose related with higher doses causing greater chance of toxicity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These two toxicities may have delayed presentation, sometimes not appearing until after completing treatment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Kidney damage ===
[[Nephrotoxicity|Kidney damage]] is a problem in 10-25% of people who receive aminoglycosides, and gentamicin is one of the most nephrotoxic of the class.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Oftentimes acute nephrotoxicity is reversible, but it may be fatal.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The risk of nephrotoxicity can be affected by the dose, frequency, duration of therapy, and concurrent use of certain medications such as NSAIDs, diuretics, cisplatin, ciclosporin, cephalosporin, amphotericin, iodide contrast media, and vancomycin.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Factors that increase risk of nephrotoxicity include:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* Increased age
* Reduced renal function
* Pregnancy
* Hypothyroidism
* Hepatic dysfunction
* Volume depletion
* Metabolic acidosis
* Sodium depletion
Kidney dysfunction is monitored by measuring [[creatinine]] in the blood, electrolyte levels, [[Oliguria|low urine output]], [[Proteinuria|foamy urine]],  and concentrations of other chemicals in the blood.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = New insights into the mechanism of aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity: an integrative point of view|url = http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/ki.2010.337|journal = Kidney International|pages = 33–45|volume = 79|issue = 1|doi = 10.1038/ki.2010.337|first = Jose M|last = Lopez-Novoa|first2 = Yaremi|last2 = Quiros|first3 = Laura|last3 = Vicente|first4 = Ana I|last4 = Morales|first5 = Francisco J|last5 = Lopez-Hernandez|pmid = 20861826|date = Jan 2011|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160310095505/http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/ki.2010.337|archivedate = 2016-03-10|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inner ear ===
11% of the population who receives aminoglycosides experience damage to their [[inner ear]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Gentamicin induced ototoxicity during treatment of enterococcal endocarditis: resolution with substitution by netilmicin|journal = Heart|date = 2005-05-01|issn = 1355-6037|pmc = 1768868|pmid = 15831617|pages = e32|volume = 91|issue = 5|doi = 10.1136/hrt.2003.028308|first = J E|last = East|first2 = J E|last2 = Foweraker|first3 = F D|last3 = Murgatroyd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The common symptoms of inner ear damage are: [[tinnitus]], hearing loss, [[vertigo]], [[ataxia|trouble with coordination]], dizziness.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Chronic use of gentamicin can affect two areas of the ears. First, damage of the inner ear hair cells can result in irreversible hearing loss. Second, damage to inner ear [[Vestibular system|vestibular]] apparatus can lead to balance problems.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity|journal = Current Pharmaceutical Design|date = 2007-01-01|issn = 1873-4286|pmid = 17266591|pages = 119–126|volume = 13|issue = 1|first = Erol|last = Selimoglu|doi=10.2174/138161207779313731}}&lt;/ref&gt; To reduce the risk of ototoxicity it is recommended to stay hydrated.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Factors that increase risk of inner ear damage include:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* [[Uremia|High blood uric acid levels]]
* Kidney dysfunction  
* Liver dysfunction 
* Higher doses 
* Long courses of therapy
* Elderly
* Also taking strong diuretics (e.g. [[furosemide]])

==Mechanism of action==
Gentamicin is a [[bactericidal]] antibiotic that works by irreversibly binding the 30S subunit of the bacterial ribosome, interrupting protein synthesis.  This mechanism of action is similar to other aminoglycosides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00798|title =DrugBank-Gentamicin|date =|accessdate =|publisher =|work =|deadurl =no|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20131004221814/http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00798|archivedate =2013-10-04|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Components===

==Contraindications==
Gentamicin should not be used if a person has a history of [[hypersensitivity]] such as anaphylaxis shock or other serious toxic reaction to gentamicin or any other [[aminoglycosides]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Special populations ==

===Pregnancy and breastfeeding===
Gentamicin is not recommended in pregnancy unless the benefits outweigh the risks for the mother. Gentamicin can cross the [[placenta]] and several reports of [[congenital hearing loss|irreversible bilateral congenital deafness]] in children have been seen. [[Intramuscular injection|Intramuscular]] injection of gentamicin in mothers can cause [[muscle weakness]] in the [[newborn]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The safety and efficacy for gentamicin in nursing mothers has not been established. Detectable gentamicin levels are found in human breast milk and in nursing babies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Geriatrics===

[[Renal function]] should be assessed before beginning therapy and during in elderly due to a decline in [[Renal function|glomerular filtration rate]]. This population can have longer than usual gentamicin levels in the body. Use cautiously in persons with [[Kidney|renal]], [[Auditory system|auditory]], [[Vestibular system|vestibular]], or [[Neuromuscular junction|neuromuscular]] dysfunction.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Pediatrics ===

Gentamicin may not be appropriate to use in children, including newborns and infants. Studies have shown higher [[Serum (blood)|serum]] levels and a longer [[half-life]] in this population. Check [[renal function]] periodically during therapy. [[Hypocalcaemia|Hypocalcemia]], [[hypokalemia]], and [[muscle weakness]] have been reported after gentamicin injection.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==History==
[[File:Gentamicin for injection.jpg|thumb|Gentamicin for injection]]

Gentamicin is produced by the fermentation of ''[[Micromonospora purpurea]]''. It was discovered in 1963 by Weinstein, Wagman et al. at Schering Corporation in Bloomfield, N.J. working with source material (soil samples) provided by Rico Woyciesjes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weinstein|first=Marvin|author2=Wagman|title=Gentamicin, A New Antimicrobial Complex from Micromonospora|journal=J Med Chem|year=1963|volume=6|pages=463–464|doi=10.1021/jm00340a034}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, it was purified and the structures of its three components determined by Cooper, et al., also at the Schering Corporation. It was initially used as a topical treatment for burns at the Atlanta and San Antonio burn units and was introduced into IV usage in 1971. It remains a mainstay for use in sepsis.

It is synthesized by ''[[Micromonospora]]'', a genus of [[Gram-positive bacteria]] widely present in the environment (water and soil). To highlight their specific biological origins, gentamicin and other related antibiotics produced by this genus ([[verdamicin]], [[mutamicin]], [[sisomicin]], [[netilmicin]], and [[retymicin]]) generally have their spellings ending in ''~micin'' and not in ''~mycin''.

==Research==
Gentamicin is also used in [[molecular biology]] research as an antibacterial agent in tissue and cell culture, to prevent contamination of sterile cultures. Gentamicin is one of the few heat-stable antibiotics that remain active even after [[autoclave|autoclaving]], which makes it particularly useful in the preparation of some microbiological growth media.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

'''Gerontogens''' are environmental agents that can accelerate aging in some animals, including humans. Gerontogens are typically toxic chemical agents, such as those found in cigarette smoke. However, many other things can act as gerontogens, including [[Ultraviolet|ultraviolet radiation]], [[chemotherapy]] treatment, and [[arsenic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Toxins in the Environment Further Age Humanity|url = http://www.natureworldnews.com/articles/7278/20140528/toxins-environment-further-age-humanity.htm|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gerontogens work in two different ways. They can shorten [[telomere]]s, repetitive [[Nucleic acid sequence|nucleotide sequences]] at the end of [[chromosome]]s, which accelerates cell desctruction. Gerontogens can also accelerate the rate of [[Senescence|cellular senescence]], where normal diploid cells cease to divide. This can be measured using the body's levels of the protein [[p16]].&lt;ref name="MyUser_News.nationalgeographic.com_September_30_2015c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/05/140528-gerontogens-chemicals-toxins-environment-study-aging-science/ |title=Scientists Urge Study of Environmental Factors That May Speed Aging |newspaper=News.nationalgeographic.com |date=  |author= |accessdate= September 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MyUser_Eurekalert.org_September_30_2015c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2014-05/cp-tit052014.php |title=Toxins in the environment might make you older than your years |newspaper=Eurekalert.org |date=  |author= |accessdate= September 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BKK-0972 (cropped).JPG|thumb|right|The Giant Swing in Bangkok]]
The '''Giant Swing''' ({{lang-th|เสาชิงช้า}}, {{RTGS|Sao Chingcha}}, {{IPA-th|sǎw t͡ɕʰīŋ.t͡ɕʰáː|pron}}) is a religious structure in [[Phra Nakhon District|Phra Nakhon]], [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]]. Located in front of [[Wat Suthat]], it was formerly used in an old [[Brahmin]] ceremony, and is one of Bangkok's tourist attractions.
&lt;!--N 13° 45.097' E 100° 30.072' according to http://www.kutu.com/thai/gps/Bangkok.htm - but MapQuest shows that coordinate as being at Sanam Luang --&gt;

==History==
The Giant Swing was constructed in 1784 in front of the [[Devasathan]] shrine by King [[Rama I]]. During the reign of [[Buddha Loetla Nabhalai|Rama II]] the swing ceremony was discontinued as the swing had become structurally damaged by lightning. In 1920 it was renovated and moved to its current location in order to make space for a gas plant. The ceremony was again performed until 1935, when it was discontinued after several fatal accidents.

The last renovations were done in 1959, and after 45 years of exposure to the elements the wooden pillars were showing signs of serious damage. A major reconstruction began in April 2005. Six teak tree trunks were used. The two used for the main structure of the swing are over 3.5 m in circumference and over 30m in height. The remaining four are used for support and are 2.30 m in circumference and 20 m in height.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manager.co.th/Daily/ViewNews.aspx?NewsID=9490000067781 Daily News - Manager Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The swing was taken down in late October 2006 and the work finished in December of the same year. The rebuilt swing was dedicated in royal ceremonies presided over by King [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]] in September 2007. The timbers of the original swing are preserved in the [[Bangkok National Museum]].

In 2005, the Giant Swing, together with Wat Suthat, was proposed as a future UNESCO [[World Heritage]] site.

==Surroundings==
'''Wat Suthat Thep Wararam'''&lt;br/&gt;
[[Wat Suthat]] Thep Wararam, commonly shortened to "Wat Suthat", is an important temple in Thailand. Inside the grand hall is a Phra Sri Sagaya Munee, its principal Buddha image which was acquired from Wat Mahathat in [[Sukhothai (city)|Sukhothai]]. Wat Suthat was built by King Rama I in the center of his capital, but it was completed in the reign of Rama III.&lt;ref&gt;ThammaThai "WatSuthat" Retrieved 19 October 2013, [http://www.dhammathai.org/watthai/bangkok/watsutat.php], 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Many people often make pilgrimages to worship the Buddha especially on holy days such as Visakha Bucha Day and Magha Bucha Day.

'''SarnChoa Po Seu or Tiger God Shrine'''
In the quarter there is also a well known and high regarded Chinese shrine, Sarn Choa Po Seu ('tiger shrine'). Originally it was a building on Bamrungmueng Road where the big Chinese communities were. Later, King Rama V expanded the road and had the shrine relocated to the current location on Ta Nao Road near WatMahanaparam.&lt;ref&gt;Travel "PaiWaiSarnJaoPorSeu" Retrieved 19 October 2013, [http://travel.kapook.com/view8796.html], 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The site is a place of worship for Thai and Chinese people seeking success in career, money, love, and infant fertility.

It was built in King Rama III reign which is 1834 and now.. Tiger God Shrine is one of the most ancient and famous shrines in Thailand.  Moreover, this shrine has beautiful interior design and has some antiquities. Most people come to pay respect to "Tua Lao Aie", a Chinese God to have good fortune, especially on Chinese New Year's Day.&lt;ref&gt;ศาลเจ้าพ่อเสือ Retrieved 17 April 2017, [http://chaoporseua.blogspot.com/] , 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

'''LanKonMueng'''&lt;br/&gt;
At the heart of the quarter is LanKonMueng in front of city hall. Every evening, this is the recreational area of the locals where they can exercise such as dance aerobics, jogging, stroll around, gather or just relax, bring children or pets out for a walk and enjoy the breeze.&lt;ref&gt;Travel "Sao ching cha" Retrieved 18 October 2013, [http://www.manager.co.th/travel/viewnews.aspx?NewsID=9560000034732], 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Devasathan'''&lt;br/&gt;
[[Devasathan]] Shrine is the most important religious and ancient place for Brahmin-Hindu in Thailand. It was built in 1784. which is in King Rama I's reign. According to ancient tradition, it was built for holding officiating religious ceremony in the past. Devasathan Shrine has three important sanctuaries which are Shiva sanctuary, Ganesha sanctuary, and Narayana sanctuary.&lt;ref&gt;เทวสถาน Retrieved 17 April 2017, [http://www.devasthan.org/newweb/%E0%B8%9B%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B0%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%95%E0%B8%B4%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%96%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%99%E0%B9%82%E0%B8%9A%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%96%E0%B9%8C%E0%B8%9E%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B2], 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Swing ceremony==
{{main|Triyampawai ceremony}}
An annual swinging ceremony known as ''Triyampavai-Tripavai'' was held at Giant Swings of major cities until 1935, when it was abolished for safety reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=M. E. Manickavasagom Pillai |title=Dravidian Influence in Thai Culture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=soFCAAAAYAAJ |year=1986 |publisher=Tamil University |page=69 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the ceremony was derived from the names of two [[Tamil language]] Hindu chants: ''[[Thiruvempavai]]'' (a [[Shaivite]] hymn by [[Manikkavacakar]]) and ''[[Thiruppavai]]'' (a [[Vaishnavite]] hymn by Andal). Among Thai people, the ceremony was popularly known as ''Lo Jin Ja'' or ''Lo-Chin-Cha'' ("pulling the swing"). It is known that Tamil verses from ''Thiruvempavai'' — ''poet pratu sivalai'' ("opening the portals of Shiva's home") — were recited at this ceremony, as well as the coronation ceremony of the [[Monarchy of Thailand|Thai king]].&lt;ref name="Upendra_1986"&gt;{{cite book |author=Upendra Thakur |title=Some Aspects of Asian History and Culture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m42TldA_OvAC&amp;pg=PA27 |year=1986 |publisher=Abhinav |isbn=978-81-7017-207-9 |pages=27–28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to T.P. Meenakshisundaram, the name of the festival indicates that Thiruppavai might have been recited as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Consider Our Vow: Translation of Tiruppāvai and Tiruvempāvai Into English |author=Norman Cutler |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2fMOAAAAMAAJ |year=1979 |publisher=Muttu Patippakam |page=13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an ancient [[Hindu]] epic, after [[Brahma]] created the world he sent [[Shiva]] to look after it. When Shiva descended to the earth, [[Nāga|Naga]] serpents wrapped around the mountains in order to keep the earth in place. After Shiva found the earth solid, the Nagas moved to the seas in celebration. The Swing Ceremony was a re-enactment of this. The pillars of the Giant Swing represented the mountains, while the circular base of the swing represented the earth and the seas. In the ceremony Brahmins would swing, trying to grab a bag of coins placed on one of the pillars.

}}The term '''''choice theory''''' is the work of [[William Glasser]], [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]], author of the book so named, and is the culmination of some 50 years of theory and practice in [[psychology]] and [[counselling]].

==Characteristics==
Choice theory posits behaviours we choose are central to our existence. Our behaviour ([[choice]]s) are driven by five genetically driven needs, survival, love and belonging, freedom, fun, and power.
Survival needs include
* food
* clothing
* shelter
* breathing
* personal safety
* security and sex, having children
and four fundamental psychological needs:
* Belonging/connecting/[[love]]
* [[Power (sociology)|Power]]/significance/competence
* [[Liberty|Freedom]]/autonomy
* Fun/learning

Choice theory suggests the existence of a "Quality World". Glasser's idea of a "Quality World" restates the [[Jungian archetypes|Jungian idea of archetypes]] but Glasser never acknowledged this. Nonetheless, Glasser's "Quality World" and what [[Carl Jung|Jung]] would call healthy archetypes are indistinguishable.

Our "Quality World" images are our role models of an individual's "perfect" world of parents, relations, possessions, beliefs, etc. How each person's "Quality World" is somewhat unusual, even in the same family of origin, is taken for granted.

Starting from birth and continuing throughout our lives, each person places significant role models, significant possessions and significant systems of belief (religion, cultural values, and [[icon]]s, etc.) into a mostly unconscious framework Glasser called our "Quality World". Glasser mostly ignores the issues of negative role models and stereotypes in choice theory.

Glasser also posits a "Comparing Place" where we compare-contrast our perception of people, places, and things immediately in front of us against our ideal images (archetypes) of these in our Quality World framework. Our subconscious pushes us towards calibrating—as best we can—our real world experience with our Quality World (archetypes).

Behavior ("Total Behavior" in Glasser's terms) is made up of these four components:  [[acting]], [[thinking]], [[feeling]], and [[physiology]]. Glasser suggests we have considerable control or choice over the first two of these; yet, little ability to directly choose the latter two as they are more deeply sub- and unconscious. These four components remain closely intertwined, the choices we make in our thinking and acting greatly affect our feeling and physiology.

A big conclusion for Glasser, one he repeats often, is the source of much personal unhappiness is failing or failed [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]] with people important to us: spouses, parents, [[children]], friends and [[colleague]]s.

The symptoms of unhappiness are widely variable and are often seen as [[mental illness]]. Glasser believed that "pleasure" and "happiness" are related but are far from synonymous. [[Sex]], for example, is a "pleasure" but may well be divorced from a "satisfactory relationship" which is a precondition for lasting "[[happiness]]" in [[life]]. Hence the intense focus on the improvement of relationships in counseling with choice theory—the "new reality therapy". Those familiar with both are likely to prefer choice theory, the more modern formulation.

Choice theory posits most mental illness is, in fact, an expression of unhappiness. Glasser champions how we are able to learn and choose alternate behaviors resulting in greater personal satisfaction. [[Reality therapy]] is the choice theory-based counseling process focused on helping clients to learn to make those self-optimizing choices.

==The ten axioms==

# The only person whose behavior we can control is our own.&lt;br /&gt;
# All we can give another person is information.&lt;br /&gt;
# All long-lasting psychological problems are relationship problems.&lt;br /&gt;
# The problem relationship is always part of our present life.&lt;br /&gt;
# What happened in the past has everything to do with what we are today, but we can only satisfy our basic needs right now and plan to continue satisfying them in the future.&lt;br /&gt;
# We can only satisfy our needs by satisfying the pictures in our Quality World.&lt;br /&gt;
# All we do is behave.&lt;br /&gt;
# All behavior is Total Behavior and is made up of four components: acting, thinking, feeling and physiology&lt;br /&gt;
# All Total Behavior is chosen, but we only have direct control over the acting and thinking components. We can only control our feeling and physiology indirectly through how we choose to act and think.&lt;br /&gt;
# All Total Behavior is designated by verbs and named by the part that is the most recognizable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.choicetheory.com | title=Choice Theory Psychology, Reality Therapy, Lead Management, &amp; Quality Schools}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In classroom management ==
William Glasser's choice theory begins:  behavior is not separate from choice; we all choose how to behave at any time. Second, we cannot control anyone's behavior but our own. Glasser also believed in the vitality of classroom meetings for the purpose of improving communication and solving real classroom problems. In the classroom, it is important for teachers to "help students envision a quality existence in school and plan the choices that lead to it".&lt;ref name="Charles, C.M. 2008"&gt;Charles, C.M. (2008). ''Building Classroom Discipline.'' (9th ed.). Boston: Pearson Education.
&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, Johnny Waits is an 18-year-old high school senior and plans on attending college to become a computer programmer. Glasser suggests Johnny could be learning as much as he can about computers instead of reading Plato. This concept is called quality curriculum, which connects students with practical real world topics, chosen by the student according to their leanings. Topics with actual career potential are most encouraged. Under Glasser's strategy, teachers hold discussions with students when introducing new topics asking them to identify what they would like to explore in depth. As part of the process, students need to explain why the material is valuable in life.&lt;ref name="Charles, C.M. 2008"/&gt;

==Education==

Glasser was no supporter of [[Summerhill School|Summerhill]]. Most Quality Schools he supervised had very conventional curriculum topics. The main innovation was a deeper, humanistic approach to group process between teacher, student and learning.

A typical example of choice theory and education are [[Sudbury school|Sudbury Model schools]], where students decide for themselves how to spend their days. In these schools, students of all ages determine what they will do, as well as when, how, and where they will do it. This freedom is at the heart of the school and it belongs to the students as their right, not to be violated. The fundamental premises of the school are: that all people are curious by nature; that the most efficient, long-lasting, and profound learning takes place when started and pursued by the learner; that all people are creative if they are allowed to develop their unique talents; that age-mixing among students promotes growth in all members of the group; and that freedom is essential to the development of personal responsibility. In practice this means that students initiate all their own activities and create their own environments. The physical plant, the staff, and the equipment are there for the students to use as the need arises. The school provides a setting in which students are independent, are trusted, and are treated as responsible people; and a community in which students are exposed to the complexities of life in the framework of a participatory democracy.

Sudbury schools are based on the premise that students are personally responsible for their acts, in opposition to virtually all schools today that deny it. The denial is threefold: schools do not permit students to choose their course of action fully; they do not permit students to embark on the course, once chosen; and they do not permit students to suffer the consequences of the course, once taken. Freedom of choice, freedom of action, freedom to bear the results of action—these are the three great freedoms that constitute personal responsibility. Thus, members of these schools learn democracy by experience, and enjoy the rights of individuals.

Sudbury schools do not perform and do not offer evaluations, assessments, or recommendations, asserting that they do not rate people, and that school is not a judge; comparing students to each other, or to some standard that has been set is for them a violation of the student's right to privacy and to self-determination. Students decide for themselves how to measure their progress as self-starting learners as a process of self-evaluation: real lifelong learning and the proper educational evaluation for the 21st Century, they adduce.

== Critiques ==

Glasser's theories and teachings have not gone without criticism. In a book review,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychiatrist.com/pcc/pccpdf/v07n02/v07n0208.pdf Review of ''Warning: Psychiatry Can Be Hazardous to Your Mental Health''], Jackson, W. Clay.  2005. The Primary Care Companion to the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, Vol. 7, No. 2&lt;/ref&gt; W. Clay Jackson writes, "Dr. Glasser postulates that everything contained in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders#DSM-IV-TR .282000.29|DSM-IV-TR]] is a result of an individual's brain creatively expressing its unhappiness. ... Dr. Glasser demonizes the entire profession as charlatans who have been brainwashed by their predecessors or who simply misrepresent many of the psychiatric illnesses to patients as having a biological basis. ... Despite claiming to have an appendix full of references demonstrating there is no evidence medications have a role in curing mental illness, the book simply relies on a core group of anti-establishment authors. ... However, what is noticeably absent from the book is a set of randomized clinical trials demonstrating the success of his teachings."

'''Guillermo Morphy y Ferríz de Guzmán''', best known as '''Conde Morphy''' or '''Count Morphy''' (February 29, 1836 – August 27, 1899 in Madrid) was a Spanish aristocrat, music critic, musicologist, historian, educator, composer and politician. He became personal secretary to King [[Alfonso XII of Spain]] in 1875. He became a highly admired figure in artistic circles of late nineteenth century Madrid, and for his service to the Crown of Spain. He was a friend of [[Isaac Albéniz]], who he arranged a grant for to study at the [[Royal Conservatory of Brussels]]. He served as director of the Royal Concert Society at the [[Teatro Real]] in Madrid until 1891.

==Biography==
Born in Madrid on February 29, 1836, he was of Irish descent, son of Joseph Morphy.&lt;ref name= "Clark p. 36"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filomusica.com/filo49/bayreuth.html|title=Guillermo Morphy|publisher=Filomusica.com|accessdate=March 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent his childhood traveling through France, Italy and Germany, among other countries, where he had a European renaissance education becoming a lover of art and literature. He lived for two years in Germany between 1846 and 1848.&lt;ref name= "Clark p. 36"&gt;{{harvnb|Clark|2002|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1858, he took over his father's law firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qlinks.net/FamilyHistory/d0000/g0000032.html#I582|title=Guillermo MORPHY Y FERRIZ DE GUZMAN (Conde de)|publisher=Qlinks.net|accessdate=March 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1863 he took classes under the composer [[François-Joseph Fétis]] in Brussels.&lt;ref name= "Clark p. 7"&gt;{{harvnb|Clark|1998|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he returned he entered the [[Royal Palace of Madrid]] on November 28, 1863 as a gentleman of the then Prince of Asturias and future King [[Alfonso XII of Spain]], a position he held until the Revolution in 1868 that overthrew [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabel II]].&lt;ref name= "Clark p. 36"/&gt;

He moved to France to engage in musicology, and during the [[Franco-Prussian War]] he traveled to [[Vienna]] to be with Prince Alfonso. There he composed the opera ''Lizzie'' and other orchestral parts.&lt;ref name= "boileau-music.com p. "&gt;{{harvnb|boileau-music.com|2012|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the [[Bourbon Restoration]], he returned to Spain with the King, who appointed him his personal secretary on January 18, 1875 and granted him the title Count Morphy on May 3, 1882.&lt;ref name= "Clark p. 36"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Ruvigny-Massue-Ruvigny p. 352"&gt;{{harvnb|Ruvigny|Massue|Ruvigny|2000| p=352}}&lt;/ref&gt; He published several studies and translated into Spanish a biography of [[Beethoven]], and in 1892 entered the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando. He also served as director of the [[Royal Concert Society]] at the [[Teatro Real]] in Madrid until 1891.

Morphy was also an acquaintance and benefactor of several notable musicians of the time, such as [[Tomás Bretón]], [[Pablo Casals]] and [[Isaac Albéniz]].&lt;ref name= "boileau-music.com p. "/&gt; The count was a close friend of Albéniz in particular and was highly enthusiastic towards his talent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaudiallgaudi.com/AM005albeniz.htm|title=Albéniz|publisher=Gaudiallgaudi.com|accessdate=March 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was Morphy who arranged for a grant for him to study at the [[Royal Conservatory of Brussels]].&lt;ref name= "Clark p. 36"/&gt; Morphy also arranged for violinist [[Enrique Fernández Arbós]] to study under [[Henri Vieuxtemps]] in Brussels.&lt;ref name= "Clark p. 36"/&gt; Albéniz dedicated his composition ''[[Sevilla (Albéniz)|Sevilla]]'' to Count Morphy's wife when he premiered in a piano performance in Paris on January 24, 1886.&lt;ref name= "Clark p. 69"&gt;{{harvnb|Clark|2002|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In late 1883, a number of musicians, led by Count Morphy, sharing the same concerns regarding the regeneration of Spanish art, gathered together in a society in Madrid to found the Philharmonic Institute with the aim of offering musical training at the same level as other European centres. The regenerative nature of their educational project, compared to the teachings of the Conservatory of Madrid, is highlighted. In particular, the bel canto school run by Napoleón Verger helped to improve the standard of singing in Spain and to endow opera stages with renowned figures, thus paving the way for the establishment of Spanish lyric drama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=García Álvarez de la Villa |first1=Beatriz |title=El Instituto Filarmónico |journal=Cuadernos de Música Iberoamericana |date=2016 |volume=29 |pages=81–109}}&lt;/ref&gt;
From 1886 to 1895, the Count of Morphy assumed a leading role as president of the Fine Arts section, he engaged with the activities of the society by giving lectures and by introducing the Ateneo to his own aesthetic principles, including his regenerationist agenda and his musical nationalism. He also extended invitations to some of the most relevant international figures and to a young generation of Spanish artists, with the intention of bringing the public closer to the European cultural scene. The Ateneo experienced a period of splendor with a new impulse in vocal, instrumental and chamber music, and a renewed repertoire with contemporary works by Spanish and Central European composers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=García Álvarez de la Villa |first1=Beatriz |title=Regeneracionismo musical en el Ateneo de Madrid bajo la presidencia del Conde de Morphy (1886-1895) |journal=Revista de Musicología |volume=40 |date=2017 |issue=vol.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18253">'''Hyperkino''' is a standardized system of referencing and [[Annotation|annotating]] films on digital carriers - attaching related content and analysis to individual frames. The name of the method, Hyperkino, is based on the intertwining of the concepts of [[textual criticism]] and [[hypertext]].

== From Theory to Practice ==
Hyperkino was developed by [[Natascha Drubek]] and Nikolai Izvolov between 2005 and 2008:&lt;ref&gt;On the relation of textus and apparatus cf. Michal Kosák, K podobě komentáře: nad filmovou sérií Hyperkino. Slovo a smysl, 10, 2013, č. 20, p. 314-317. http://slovoasmysl.ff.cuni.cz/node/499&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We have connected the traditional principles of annotation with digital technologies and their markup languages, applying hypermedia principles of commentary to the linear medium of film. HYPERKINO annotations of a film are comparable to the [[footnotes]] and the commentary in historical-critical editions of texts, with the only difference being that they are {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} various media forms (text, sound, pictures). […] The tradition of scholarly editions provides sophisticated ways of preserving texts over centuries, keeping them alive in constantly evolving receptions and commentaries. The idea of indexing a text, turning it into a network of interrelations and linking it with other texts, goes back to the tradition of editing scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hyperkino.net/hyperkino/What-is-HYPERKINO|title=What is HYPERKINO / hyperkino / convergence - Website Interface|last=Systems|first=eZ|website=hyperkino.net|access-date=2016-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Digital humanities scholar Christian Gosvig Olesen stresses the importance of the analytical and theoretical phase preceding practical steps towards developing and designing the Hyperkino method: “In 2006 Drubek and Izvolov penned an article together that formulated this vision, Critical Editions of Films on Digital Formats, which was published in the eighth edition of the international film studies review Cinema &amp; Cie.&lt;ref&gt;“Critical Editions of Films on Digital Formats”, Cinema &amp; Cie (autumn 2006). A second English edition appeared in Studies in Russian and Soviet Cinema, Volume 2, 2008, Issue 2, 205-216. The method was first described in the 2005 Russian original of the article: Natascha Drubek-Meyer/ Nikolaj Izvolov: “Kommentirovannoe izdanie fil’mov na DVD: neobchodimost’ naučnych standartov”. In: Kinovedcheskie zapiski 72, 2005, p. 372-383.&lt;/ref&gt; in the fall of 2006.”

He characterizes Hyperkino as a philological reaction to audio commentaries which were the early and most popular forms of extras on DVDs: &lt;blockquote&gt;The article departed from a critique of current presentations in academic and contextualizing analyses of films on DVD to conceptualize a new way of DVD editorship relying on annotations and a more extensive and effective use of the hyperlinked structure of the DVD format. One of the points of critique was that existing DVD editions much too often overburdened the works in question […] Drubek and Izvolov instead advocated for a use of annotations which could appear in conjunction with the film but also exist independently of it. As the basis of this proposition they proposed a distinction between the film in itself as textus, which should be able to stand alone and be viewed independently of an analytical interpretive layer, and on the other hand an apparatus including all that which is not part of the filmic text itself: notes on the film’s historical context, script, stills or for example correspondences or business documents related to the film’s production.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://filmhistoryinthemaking.com/2013/08/10/what-is-hyperkino-ruscicos-academia-dvd-series-and-the-historical-critical-film-edition/|title=What Is Hyperkino? Ruscico’s Academia DVD series and the historical-critical film edition|last=Olesen|first=Christian Gosvig|date=2013-08-10|website=Film History in the Making|access-date=2016-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Hyperkino commentaries were made possible by the DVD format, introduced in 1996. In the ten years of its existence this format had produced several noteworthy audio commentaries by either filmmakers or scholars.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.peterbosma.info/?p=blog&amp;blog=30|title=Hyperkino. Een dvd met voetnoten (2010)|last=Bosma|first=Peter|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it hardly had contributed to creating a standard of critical editions of films on digital carriers. In the academic environment of film studies the digital representation of film seemed to usher in a welcome convergence of film and writing on film. Digital technologies offered an option to explore the old medium of film from a new angle. The idea of a scholarly digital edition of a film surfaced several years after the first “Deluxe” editions of films with “deleted scenes” and other DVD extras were published. Scholarly interest in the DVD was driven by the requirement to have a stable “textus” which could be the basis of citations. In addition, film analysis asked for tools to annotate shots or even single frames in a film without destroying the cinematic text itself by intrusive modifications such as inserting talking heads or acousmatic voices of commentators.
From this perspective Hyperkino was an exercise in understatement compared to other DVD extras. Its principle was a hidden annotation linked to the film frame marked by a minimal sign, usually a number.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Clicking the number leads the viewer onto an off-screen commentary text section. “These sections we call 'footnotes' for the film. The main difference to current DVD commentaries is the presentation of scholarly research: It happens not in an audio but in a written format which makes the commentary quotable. Every HYPERKINO DVD edition is tantamount to an introductory article about the film published. The film and texts about the film merge on the digital carrier.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cordis.europa.eu/result/rcn/48480_en.html|title=European Commission : CORDIS : Projects &amp; Results Service : Final Activity Report Summary - HYFIP (Hypertextual Film Presentation. Designing Digital Editions for the European Cinematographic Heritage)|website=cordis.europa.eu|access-date=2016-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hyperkino DVDs ==
As a commercially available DVD format Hyperkino materialized itself three years after the programmatic article by Drubek and Izvolov. In 2008 Drubek produced a Hyperkino DVD in Berlin and Prague, publishing Nikolai Izvolov’s reconstruction of [[Lev Kuleshov]]’s until then unpublished first film: ''Proekt inzhenera Praita''.

Gosvig Olesen writes: “First in the fold of the German DVD publisher Absolutmedien and later as the series KinoAcademia published by RUSCICO. The film to launch the format was Lev Kuleshov’s debut feature Proekt inzhenera Prayta (Engineer Prite’s Project), USSR, 1918). Not only was it the first time the film was made available digitally, it had also, as pointed out by film historian Kristin Thompson, for a long time only existed in a version without intertitles, which left the impression that the film was incomplete.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Hyperkino editions emphasize the importance of incorporating different versions of the film. Two versions can be found on the German DVD of Engineer Prite’s Project allowing to compare the fragmented film as it lies in Gosfilmofond without intertitles with Izvolov’s 2001 reconstruction of the film which incorporated textual material from a surviving original libretto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cinando.com/en/Film/engineer_prites_project_59063/Detail|title=ENGINEER PRITE'S PROJECT|website=cinando.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DVD contains the TV documentary The Kuleshov Effect (USSR, 1969) by Semyon Raitburt (ЭФФЕКТ КУЛЕШОВА, 1969, Семён Райтбурт). The Hyperkino “footnotes” quote from interviews with Kuleshov and [[Viktor Shklovsky]].

In the following years around a dozen of Hyperkino DVDs were released by the Russian publisher RUSCICO under the series title “Kino Academia” containing the annotations of international film scholars specializing in Russian and Soviet film:  Aleksandr Deriabin, Natascha Drubek, Bernard Eisenschitz, Jeremy Hicks, Nikolai Izvolov, Ekaterina Khokhlova, Milena Musina, Sergei Kapterev, Natalia Riabchikova, and Yuri Tsivian. Not all of the initially announced DVDs have been published yet, due to the high production costs.

In line with the aims described in Drubek’s and Izvolov’s 2005 article, every Hyperkino DVD edition consists of a textus and an apparatus. The apparatus in Hyperkino editions consists of alternative versions and “footnotes” connected to the film. Footnote numbers on all Hyperkino DVDs appear during playback in the upper right corner of the frame. In the RUSCICO editions the textus is on disc 1 (language versions) and the apparatus on disc 2 (film without language versions but with Hyperkino footnotes).

== Awards ==
In 2010 at the Bologna festival Il Cinema Ritrovato three Hyperkino titles were awarded with the  “DVD Awards 2010, VII edition. Best Special Features (Bonus) for their innovative handling of printed and illustrated commentaries”. The three DVDs were:

* ENGINEER PRITE’S PROJECT (Russia/1918) by Lev Kuleshov – Ruscico (Russia) - hyperkino annotations by N. Drubek-Meyer / Nikolai Izvolov
* OCTOBER (Russia/1927) by Sergey Eisenstein, Grigori Aleksandrov – Ruscico (Russia) - hyperkino annotations by Yuri Tsivian
In the same year Hyperkino received another award from the Russian Guild of Film Critics and Scholars, the “Elephant 2010” (Kinovedenie i kinokritika v elektronnych SMI, novye technologii).

== Reviews and Reactions ==
“The idea of Hyperkino is a sensational breakthrough: imagine what a potential is looming here!”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In his article "The Mosaic Approach. In defense of a nonlinear film criticism" Jonathan Rosenbaum describes Hyperkino as "a hybrid form—existing somewhere between reading and watching, like various computer-related activities—is part of what seems forward-looking about them […] What all these forms of criticism suggest is not merely a less linear way of approaching film experience but also a more interactive methodology. The fact that movies are being seen more and more often away from public theaters shouldn't necessarily mean that the way we all experience them and share our experiences is any less social. Perhaps it's more pertinent to note that the very forms of our social interactions in relation to films are changing as well."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.movingimagesource.us/articles/the-mosaic-approach-20100818|title=The Mosaic Approach by  Jonathan Rosenbaum - Moving Image Source|website=www.movingimagesource.us|access-date=2016-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Julian Graffy discusses Hyperkino from the perspective of the “commentarist”: “Engaging with the Hyperkino commentaries leads to thoughts about the fundamental differences between a spoken commentary, the only version most viewers will so far have encountered, and the (predominantly written) Hyperkino approach.” Graffy mentions the time factor which challenged the performance of audio commentators: “bottlenecks, where too much is happening at once for you to cover all you want to say; and longueurs, where you wonder how to fill the space, or worry about extended periods of silence. […] None of these problems exists, of course, for the Hyperkino commentarist – he or she is not time-bound, and the notes can be as short or as long as required. They can also be more scholarly – the notes on Strike especially are full of references to sources both printed and archival – indicating to the scholar/student viewer where to do further research. And, above all, they have the advantage of hybridity, which is why the Hyperkino notes are more than just a book on screen.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Graffy|first=Julian|year=2010|title=[Hyperkino] DVD Reviews|url=|journal=Studies in Russian and Soviet Cinema|volume=4|issue=3|pages=345–354|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 film critic and media scholar Joachim Schätz called the Hyperkino publication of the Kuleshov debut a "mediated revolution" (“vermittelte Revolution”)  and Hyperkino "one of the most exciting forms of reflection on film one can experience today."

In the visual arts, '''late modernism''' encompasses the overall production of most recent art made between the aftermath of World War II and the early years of the 21st century. The terminology often points to similarities between late modernism and post-modernism although there are differences. The predominant term for art produced since the 1950s is [[contemporary art]]. Not all art labelled as contemporary art is modernist or post-modern, and the broader term encompasses both artists who continue to work in modern and late modernist traditions, as well as artists who reject modernism for post-modernism or other reasons. [[Arthur Danto]] argues explicitly in ''After the End of Art'' that contemporaneity was the broader term, and that postmodern objects represent a subsector of the contemporary movement which replaced modernity and modernism, while other notable critics: [[Hilton Kramer]],&lt;ref name="Deconstructionists, 2006, pp. 218-221"&gt;''The Citadel of Modernism Falls to Deconstructionists'', 1992 critical essay, ''The Triumph of Modernism'', 2006, [[Hilton Kramer]], pp. 218–221.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert C. Morgan]], [[Kirk Varnedoe]],&lt;ref&gt;''Man of his words: Pepe Karmel on Kirk Varnedoe - Passages'', critical essay, [[Artforum]], Nov. 2003 by Pepe Karmel&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-François Lyotard]] and others have argued that postmodern objects are at best relative to modernist works.

The jargon which encompasses the two terms ''late modernism'' and ''[[postmodern art]]'' is used to denote what may be considered as the ultimate phase of [[modern art]], as art at the end of [[modernism]] or as certain tendencies of [[contemporary art]].

There are those who argue against a division into modern and [[postmodern]] periods. Not all critics agree that the stage called modernism is over or even near the end. There is no agreement that all art after modernism is post-modern. [[Contemporary art]] is the more-widely used term to denote work since roughly 1960, though it has many other uses as well. Nor is post-modern art universally separated from modernism, with many critics seeing it as merely another phase in [[modern art]] or as another form of late [[modernism]].

As with all uses of the term post-modern there are critics of its application, however, at this point, these critics are in the minority.&lt;ref name="Deconstructionists, 2006, pp. 218-221"/&gt; This is not to say that the phase of art denoted by post-modernism is accepted, merely that the need for a term to describe movements in art after the peak of [[abstract expressionism]] is well established.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/postmodernism.html Clement Greenberg: Modernism and Postmodernism], seventh paragraph of the essay. URL accessed on June 15, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; However although the concept of change has come to consensus, and whether it is a post-modernist change, or a late modernist period, is undetermined, the consensus is that a profound change in the perception of works of art has occurred and a new era has been emerging on the world stage since at least the 1960s.

In literature, the term '''late modernism''' refers to works of literature produced after World War II. However, several different definitions of late modernist literature exist. The most common refers to works published between 1930 and 1939, or 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Cheryl Hindrichs, "Late Modernism, 1928–1945: Criticism and Theory" ''Literature Compass'', Volume 8, Issue 11, pages 840–855, November 2011;  J. H. Dettmar "Modernism". David Scott Kastan. Oxford University Press 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are modernists, such as [[Basil Bunting]] (1900–85) and [[T. S. Eliot]] (1888-1965), writing later than 1945, and [[Samuel Beckett]], who died in 1989, has been described as a "later modernist".&lt;ref&gt;Morris Dickstein, "An Outsider to His Own Life", Books, ''The New York Times'', August 3, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Eliot published two plays in the 1950s and Bunting's long modernist poem "[[Briggflatts]]" was published in 1965. The poets [[Charles Olson]] (1910-1970) and [[J. H. Prynne]] (1936- ) are, amongst other writing in the second half of the 20th century, who have been described as late modernists.&lt;ref&gt;''Late modernist poetics: From Pound to Prynne'' by Anthony Mellors; see also Prynne's publisher, Bloodaxe Books.&lt;/ref&gt; There is the further question as to whether late modernist literature differs in any important way from the modernist works produced before 1930. To confuse matters, more recently the term late modernism has been redefined by at least one critic and used to refer to works written after 1945, rather than 1930. With this usage goes the idea that the ideology of modernism was significantly re-shaped by the events of [[World War II]], especially the [[Holocaust]] and the dropping of the atom bomb.&lt;ref&gt;''Late modernist poetics: From Pound to Prynne'' by Anthony Mellors.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences from postmodernism==
Late modernism describes movements which both arise from, and react against, trends in [[modernism]] and reject some aspect of modernism, while fully developing the conceptual potentiality of the modernist enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;The Originality of the Avant Garde and Other Modernist Myths [[Rosalind E. Krauss]], Publisher: The MIT Press; Reprint edition (July 9, 1986), ''Part I, ''Modernist Myths'', pp.8-171&lt;/ref&gt; In some descriptions post-modernism as a period in art is completed, whereas in others it is a continuing movement in [[contemporary art]]. In art, the specific traits of modernism which are cited are generally formal purity, [[medium specificity]], [[art for art's sake]], the possibility of [[authenticity in art]], the importance or even possibility of universal truth in art, and the importance of an avant-garde and originality. This last point is one of particular controversy in art, where many institutions argue that being visionary, forward looking, cutting edge and progressive are crucial to the mission of art in the present, and that postmodern therefore, represents a contradiction of the value of "art of our times".

One compact definition offered is that while post-modernism acts in rejection of modernism's grand narratives of artistic direction, and to eradicate the boundaries between high and low forms of art, to disrupt genre and its conventions with collision, collage and fragmentation. Post-modern art is seen as believing that all stances are unstable and insincere, and therefore irony, parody and humor are the only positions which cannot be overturned by critique or later events.

Many of these traits are present in modern movements in art, particularly the rejection of the separation between high and low forms of art. However, these traits are considered fundamental to post-modern art, as opposed to merely present in one degree or another. One of the most important points of difference, however, between post-modernism, and modernism, as movements in art, is modernism's ultimately progressive stance that new works be more "forward looking" and advanced, whereas post-modern movements generally reject the notion that there can be advancement or progress in art per se, and thus one of the projects of art must be the overturning of the "myth of the [[avant-garde]]". This relates to the negation of what post-structuralist philosophers call "[[metanarratives]]".

[[Rosalind Krauss]] was one of the important annunciators of the view that avant-gardism was over, and that the new artistic era existed in a post-liberal and post-progress normalcy.&lt;ref&gt;The Originality of the Avant Garde and Other Modernist Myths [[Rosalind E. Krauss]], Publisher: The MIT Press; Reprint edition (July 9, 1986), ''Part I, ''Modernist Myths'', pp.8-171, Part II, ''Toward Post-Modernism'', pp. 196-291.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this viewpoint is explained by [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]] in ''The Shock of the New''&lt;ref&gt;''The Shock of the New'' [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]], Publisher: Knopf; Revised edition (August 13, 1991),&lt;/ref&gt; in his chapter "The Future That Was":

{{Quote|
Where did this new academy begin? At its origins the ''avant-garde'' myth had held the artist to be a precursor; the significant work is the one that prepares the future. The cult of the precursor ended by cluttering the landscape with absurd prophetic claims. The idea of a cultural ''avant-garde'' was unimaginable before 1800. It was fostered by the rise of [[liberalism]]. Where the taste of religious or secular courts determined patronage, "subversive" innovation was not esteemed as a sign of artistic quality. Nor was the artist's autonomy, that would come with the [[Romanticism|Romantics]].

As with all uses of the term postmodern there are critics of its application. [[Kirk Varnedoe]], for instance, stated that there is no such thing as postmodernism, and that the possibilities of modernism have not yet been exhausted.&lt;ref&gt;William R. Everdell, ''The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth-century Thought'', University of Chicago Press, 1997, p. 4. {{ISBN|0-226-22480-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; These critics are currently in the minority.&lt;ref name="Deconstructionists, 2006, pp. 218-221"/&gt;

[[Hilton Kramer]] describes postmodernism as "a creation of modernism at the end of its tether".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Oliver Bennett, ''Cultural Pessimism: Narratives of Decline in the Postmodern World'', Edinburgh University Press, 2001, p. 131. {{ISBN|0-7486-0936-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-François Lyotard]], in [[Frederic Jameson]]'s analysis, does not hold that there is a postmodern stage radically different from the period of [[high modernism]]; instead, postmodern discontent with this or that high modernist style is part of the experimentation of high modernism, giving birth to new modernisms.&lt;ref&gt;Frederic Jameson, ''Foreword'' to Jean-François Lyotard, ''The Postmodern Condition'', Manchester University Press, 1997, pxvi. {{ISBN|0-7190-1450-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Radical movements in modern art ==

Radical movements in Modernism, Modern art, and radical trends regarded as influential and potentially as precursors to late modernism and postmodernism emerged around World War I and particularly in its aftermath. With the introduction of the use of industrial artifacts in art, movements such as [[Cubism]], [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]] as well as techniques such as [[collage]] and artforms such as cinema and the rise of [[reproduction]] as a means of creating artworks. Both [[Pablo Picasso]] the [[Modernist]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]] the rebel created important and influential works from [[found objects]].

===Fauvism, cubism, dada, surrealism as the precedent===
{{main|Fauvism|Cubism|Dada|Surrealism}}

[[File:Matissedance.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Henri Matisse]], ''[[The Dance (second version)]]'', 1909 [[Hermitage Museum]], [[St. Petersburg, Russia]]]]
In the early 20th century, following [[Henri Matisse]] and [[André Derain]]'s impact as Fauvist painters and [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Georges Braque]]'s monumental innovations and the worldwide success of [[Cubism]] and the emboldening of the [[avant-garde]], [[Marcel Duchamp]] exhibited a urinal as a sculpture. His point was to have people look at the urinal as if it were a work of art, because he said it was a work of art. He referred to his work as "[[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|Readymades]]." The ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'',  was a urinal signed with the pseudonym R. Mutt, that shocked the art world in 1917. This and Duchamp's other works are generally labelled as [[Dada]].

Dadaism can be viewed as part of the modernist propensity to challenge established styles and forms, along with [[Surrealism]], [[futurism]] and [[abstract expressionism]].&lt;ref&gt;Simon Malpas, ''The Postmodern'', Routledge, 2005. p. 17. {{ISBN|0-415-28064-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a chronological point of view Dada is located solidly within modernism, however a number of critics have held that it anticipates postmodernism, while others, such as [[Ihab Hassan]] and [[Steven Connor]], consider it a possible changeover point between modernism and postmodernism.&lt;ref&gt;Mark A. Pegrum, ''Challenging Modernity: Dada Between Modern and Postmodern'', Berghahn Books, 2000, pp. 2–3. {{ISBN|1-57181-130-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fauvism]] and [[Henri Matisse]] in particular became an important influence on both [[abstract expressionism]] and [[color field painting]], important milestones of Late Modernism. ''[[The Dance (painting)|The Dance]]'' is commonly recognized as "a key point of Matisse's career and in the development of modern painting".&lt;ref&gt;Russell T. Clement. ''Four French Symbolists''. Greenwood Press, 1996. Page 114.&lt;/ref&gt; With its large expanse of blue, simplicity of design and emphasis on pure feeling the painting was enormously influential to American artists who viewed it at [[MoMA]] in New York City.

===High art and culture===

The ignition point for the definition of modernism as a movement was the austere rejection of popular culture as [[kitsch]] by important post-war artists and taste-makers, most notably [[Clement Greenberg]] with his essay ''[[Avant-Garde and Kitsch]]'', first published in ''[[Partisan Review]]'' in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/kitsch.html Avant-Garde and Kitsch]''&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1940s and 1950s Greenberg proved to be an articulate and powerful art critic. In particular his writing on American Abstract expressionism, and 20th-century European modernism persuasively made the case for High art and culture. In 1961 ''Art and Culture'', Beacon Press, a highly influential collection of essays by [[Clement Greenberg]] was first published. Greenberg is primarily thought of as a [[Formalism (art)|formalist]] [[art critic]] and many of his most important essays are crucial to the understanding of [[Modern art]] history, and the history of [[modernism]] and Late Modernism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/postmodernism.html Clement Greenberg: Modernism and Postmodernism], URL accessed on June 15, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jackson Pollock: abstract expressionism===
{{main|Jackson Pollock|Abstract expressionism|Process art|Western painting}}

During the late 1940s [[Jackson Pollock|Pollock]]'s radical approach to painting revolutionized the potential for all [[contemporary art]] that followed him. To some extent Pollock realized that the journey toward making a work of art was as important as the work of art itself. Like [[Pablo Picasso]]'s innovative reinventions of painting and sculpture near the turn of the century via [[Cubism]] and constructed sculpture, Pollock redefined the way art gets made at the mid-century point. Pollock's move — away from easel painting and conventionality — was a liberating signal to his contemporaneous artists and to all that came after. Artists realized that Jackson Pollock's process — working on the floor, unstretched raw canvas, from all four sides, using artist materials, industrial materials, imagery, non-imagery, throwing linear skeins of paint, dripping, drawing, staining, brushing, essentially blasted artmaking beyond any prior boundary. [[Abstract expressionism]] in general expanded and developed the definitions and possibilities that artists had available for the creation of new works of art. In a sense the innovations of Jackson Pollock, [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Franz Kline]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Philip Guston]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Ad Reinhardt]] and others opened the floodgates to the diversity and scope of all the art that followed them.

===Neo-Dada, collage and assemblage===

{{main|Collage|Assemblage art|Installation art}}

Related to [[abstract expressionism]] was the emergence of combined manufactured items — with artist materials, moving away from previous conventions of painting and sculpture. This trend in art is exemplified by the work of [[Robert Rauschenberg]], whose "combines" in the 1950s were forerunners of Pop Art and [[Installation art]], and made use of the assemblage of large physical objects, including stuffed animals, birds and [[commercial photography]].

[[Leo Steinberg]] uses the term postmodernism in 1969 to describe Rauschenberg's "flatbed" picture plane, containing a range of cultural images and artifacts that had not been compatible with the pictorial field of premodernist and modernist painting.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Crimp in Hal Foster (ed), ''Postmodern Culture'', Pluto Press, 1985 (first published as ''The Anti-Aesthetic'', 1983). p. 44. {{ISBN|0-7453-0003-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Craig Owens (critic)|Craig Owens]] goes further, identifying the significance of Rauschenberg's work not as a representation of, in Steinberg's view, "the shift from nature to culture", but as a demonstration of the impossibility of accepting their opposition.&lt;ref&gt;Craig Owens, ''Beyond Recognition: Representation, Power, and Culture'', London and Berkeley: University of California Press (1992), pp. 74–75.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Steven Best]] and [[Douglas Kellner]] identify Rauschenberg and [[Jasper Johns]] as part of the transitional phase, influenced by [[Marcel Duchamp]], between modernism and postmodernism. Both used images of ordinary objects, or the objects themselves, in their work, while retaining the abstraction and painterly gestures of high modernism.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Best, Douglas Kellner, ''The Postmodern Turn'', Guilford Press, 1997, p. 174. {{ISBN|1-57230-221-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abstract painting and sculpture in the 1960s and 1970s===

[[File:SMITH CUBI VI.JPG|thumb|[[David Smith (artist)|David Smith]], ''CUBI VI'', 1963]]
In abstract painting and sculpture during the 1950s and 1960s [[Geometric abstraction]] emerged as an important direction in the works of many sculptors and painters. In painting [[color field painting]], [[minimalism]], [[hard-edge painting]] and [[lyrical abstraction]]&lt;ref&gt;Ratcliff, Carter. The New Informalists, Art News, v. 68, n. 8, December 1969, p.72.&lt;/ref&gt; constituted radical new directions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Barbara Rose]]. ''American Painting. Part Two: The Twentieth Century''. Published by Skira - Rizzoli, New York, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Darby Bannard]]. "Notes on American Painting of the Sixties." ''Artforum'', January 1970, vol. 8, no. 5, pp.40-45.&lt;/ref&gt;

April, 1967. pp. 37-41, Cover Illus.: Six-Ninths Blue, 1966&lt;/ref&gt; [[Howard Hodgkin]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Brice Marden]], [[Robert Mangold]], [[Walter Darby Bannard]], [[Dan Christensen]], [[Larry Zox]], [[Ronnie Landfield]], [[Charles Hinman]], [[Sam Gilliam]], [[Peter Reginato]], were some of the artists whose works characterized abstract painting and sculpture in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich, Larry. Young Lyrical Painters, Art in America, v. 57, n. 6, November–December 1969, pp. 104–113.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Lyrical abstraction]] shares similarities with [[color field]] painting and [[abstract expressionism]] especially in the freewheeling usage of paint — texture and surface. Direct drawing, calligraphic use of line, the effects of brushed, splattered, stained, squeegeed, poured, and splashed paint superficially resemble the effects seen in [[abstract expressionism]] and [[color field]] painting. However the styles are markedly different. Setting it apart from [[abstract expressionism]] and [[action painting]] of the 1940s and 1950s is the approach to composition and drama. As seen in [[action painting]] there is an emphasis on brushstrokes, high compositional drama, dynamic compositional tension. While in lyrical abstraction there is a sense of compositional randomness, all over composition, low key and relaxed compositional drama and an emphasis on process, repetition, and an all over sensibility.
During the 1960s and 1970s artists as powerful and influential as [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Phillip Guston]], [[Lee Krasner]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Jasper Johns]], [[Richard Diebenkorn]], [[Josef Albers]], [[Elmer Bischoff]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Al Held]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Gene Davis (painter)|Gene Davis]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Joan Mitchell]], [[Friedel Dzubas]], and younger artists like [[Brice Marden]], [[Robert Mangold]], [[Sam Gilliam]], [[John Hoyland]], [[Sean Scully]], [[Elizabeth Murray (born 1940)|Elizabeth Murray]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Walter Darby Bannard]], [[Larry Zox]], [[Ronnie Landfield]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[Dan Christensen]], [[Joan Snyder]], [[Ross Bleckner]], [[Archie Rand]], [[Richard Saba]], [[Susan Crile]], [[Mino Argento]]&lt;ref&gt;"Shade acrylic canvases in which geometric shapes are juxtaposed". [[Betty Parsons]] Gallery. The New Yorker. Oct. 3, 1977 p.8&lt;/ref&gt; and dozens of others continued to produce vital and influential paintings.

===Minimalism and post-minimalism===

{{main|Minimalism|Postminimalism}}
[[File:'Red Canvas' by Richard Tuttle, 1967, Corcoran Gallery of Art.jpg|thumb|left|[[Richard Tuttle]], ''Red Canvas'', 1967]]
By the early 1960s [[minimalism]] emerged as an abstract movement in art (with roots in [[geometric abstraction]] via [[Malevich]], the [[Bauhaus]] and [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]]). Important artists who emerged as pioneers of [[minimalism]] include [[Frank Stella]], [[Larry Bell (artist)|Larry Bell]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Donald Judd]], [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]], [[Carl Andre]], [[Robert Smithson]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Robert Mangold]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], and [[Ronald Bladen]] among others. These artists also frequently employed [[shaped canvas]]es, as in the example by [[Richard Tuttle]] shown at right. [[Minimal art]] rejected the idea of relational, and subjective painting, the complexity of [[abstract expressionist]] surfaces, and the emotional zeitgeist and polemics present in the arena of [[action painting]]. [[Minimalism]] argued that extreme simplicity could capture all of the sublime representation needed in art. Associated with painters such as [[Frank Stella]], minimalism in painting and sculpture, as opposed to other areas, is a late modernist movement and depending on the context can be construed as a precursor to the post modern movement.

Hal Foster, in his essay ''The Crux of Minimalism'', examines the extent to which Donald Judd and Robert Morris both acknowledge and exceed Greenbergian modernism in their published definitions of minimalism.&lt;ref&gt;Hal Foster, ''The Return of the Real: The Avant-garde at the End of the Century'', MIT Press, 1996, pp. 44–53. {{ISBN|0-262-56107-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that minimalism is not a "dead end" of modernism, but a "paradigm shift toward postmodern practices that continue to be elaborated today."&lt;ref name=Foster36/&gt;

In the late 1960s the term [[Post-minimalism]] was coined by [[Robert Pincus-Witten]] to describe minimalist derived art which had content and contextual overtones which minimalism rejected, and was applied to the work of [[Eva Hesse]], [[Keith Sonnier]], [[Richard Serra]] and new work by former minimalists [[Robert Smithson]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Sol LeWitt]], and Barry Le Va, and others.&lt;ref&gt;''Movers and Shakers, New York'', "Leaving C&amp;M", by Sarah Douglas, ''[[Art &amp; Auction|Art+Auction]]'', March 2007, V.XXXNo7.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rosalind Krauss]] argues that by 1968 artists such as Morris, LeWitt, Smithson and Serra had "entered a situation the logical conditions of which can no longer be described as modernist."&lt;ref name=Krauss287&gt;The Originality of the Avant Garde and Other Modernist Myths [[Rosalind E. Krauss]], Publisher: The MIT Press; Reprint edition (July 9, 1986), ''Sculpture in the Expanded Field'' pp.287&lt;/ref&gt; The expansion of the category of sculpture to include [[land art]] and [[architecture]], "brought about the shift into postmodernism."&lt;ref&gt;The Originality of the Avant Garde and Other Modernist Myths [[Rosalind E. Krauss]], Publisher: The MIT Press; Reprint edition (July 9, 1986), ''Sculpture in the Expanded Field'' (1979). pp.290&lt;/ref&gt;

Minimalists like [[Donald Judd]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Carl Andre]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[John McCracken (artist)|John McCracken]] and others continued to produce their late [[modernist]] paintings and sculpture for the remainder of their careers.

===Process art===
{{Main|Process art}}

By the late 1960s however, [[process art]] emerged as a revolutionary concept and movement that encompassed painting and sculpture, via [[lyrical abstraction]] and the [[postminimalist]] movement, and in early [[Conceptual Art]]. [[Eva Hesse]], [[Robert Smithson]], [[Walter De Maria]], [[Keith Sonnier]], [[Richard Serra]], [[Nancy Graves]], [[Jannis Kounellis]], [[Bruce Nauman]], [[Richard Tuttle]], [[Mel Bochner]], [[Hannah Wilke]], [[Lynda Benglis]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Barry Le Va]], [[Michael Heizer]], [[Lawrence Weiner]], [[Joseph Kosuth]], and [[Alan Saret]], were some of the process artists that emerged during the 1960s. Process art as inspired by Pollock enabled artists to experiment with and make use of a diverse encyclopedia of style, content, material, placement, sense of time, scale, size, and plastic and real space.&lt;ref&gt;Source: {{cite web |url=http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/glossary_Process_art.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927200906/http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/glossary_Process_art.html |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }} (accessed: March 15, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pop art===
{{main|Pop art|Western painting}}
The term "pop art" was used by [[Lawrence Alloway]] to describe paintings that celebrated [[consumerism]] of the post World War II era.&lt;ref&gt;''Topics in American Art since 1945'', pp. 119–122, by [[Lawrence Alloway]], 1975 by W.W. Norton and Company, NYC {{ISBN|0-393-04401-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This movement rejected [[abstract expressionism]] and its focus on the hermeneutic and psychological interior, in favor of art which depicted, and often celebrated material consumer culture, advertising, and iconography of the mass production age. The early works of [[David Hockney]] and the works of [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]], [[John McHale (artist)|John McHale]], and [[Eduardo Paolozzi]] were considered seminal examples in the movement. While later American examples include the bulk of the careers of [[Andy Warhol]] and [[Roy Lichtenstein]] and his use of [[Benday dots]], a technique used in commercial reproduction. There is a clear connection between the radical works of [[Duchamp]], the rebellious [[Dada]]ist — with a sense of humor; and [[pop art]]ists like [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Andy Warhol]], [[Roy Lichtenstein]] and the others.

In general pop art and [[minimalism]] began as modernist movements, a shift in the paradigm and a philosophical split between [[Formalism (art)|formalism]] and anti-formalism in the early 1970s caused those movements to be viewed by some as precursors, or transitioning to postmodern art. Other modern movements cited as influential to postmodern art are [[Conceptual art]], [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]] and the use of techniques such as [[Assemblage (art)|assemblage]], [[Photomontage|montage]], [[collage]], [[bricolage]] and art forms which used recording or reproduction as the basis for artworks.
 
There are differing opinions as to whether pop art is a late modernist movement or is [[Postmodern]]. Thomas McEvilly, agreeing with [[Dave Hickey]], says that postmodernism in the visual arts began with the first exhibitions of pop art in 1962, "though it took about twenty years before postmodernism became a dominant attitude in the visual arts."&lt;ref name=McEvilly29&gt;Thomas McEvilly in Richard Roth, Jean Dubuffet, Susan King, ''Beauty Is Nowhere: Ethical Issues in Art and Design'', Routledge, 1998. p. 29. {{ISBN|90-5701-311-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frederic Jameson]], too, considers pop art to be postmodern.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Jameson in Hal Foster, ''Postmodern Culture'', Pluto Press, 1985 (first published as ''The Anti-Aesthetic'', 1983). p. 111. {{ISBN|0-7453-0003-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One way that Pop art is postmodern is that it breaks down what [[Andreas Huyssen]] calls the "Great Divide" between high art and popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Malpas, ''The Postmodern'', Routledge, 2005. p. 20. {{ISBN|0-415-28064-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postmodernism emerges from a "generational refusal of the categorical certainties of high modernism."&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Sim, ''The Routledge Companion to Postmodernism'', Routledge, 2001. p. 148. {{ISBN|0-415-24307-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although to presuppose that [[modernism]] stands for "high art" only, and is in any way certain as to what constitutes "high" art is to profoundly and basically misunderstand modernism.

===Performance art and happenings===

{{main|Performance art|List of performance artists|Happenings}}
[[File:Schneemann-Interior Scroll.gif|thumb|left|[[Carolee Schneemann]] performing her piece ''Interior Scroll, 1975.'' [[Yves Klein]] in [[France]], and [[Carolee Schneemann]], [[Yayoi Kusama]], [[Charlotte Moorman]], and [[Yoko Ono]] in [[New York City]] were pioneers of performance based works of art, that often entailed nudity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.caroleeschneemann.com/interiorscroll.html&lt;/ref&gt;]]
During the late 1950s and 1960s artists with a wide range of interests began to push the boundaries of [[contemporary art]]. [[Yves Klein]] in France, and [[Carolee Schneemann]], [[Yayoi Kusama]], [[Charlotte Moorman]], and [[Yoko Ono]] in New York City were pioneers of performance based works of art. Groups like The [[Living Theater]] with [[Julian Beck]] and [[Judith Malina]] collaborated with sculptors and painters creating environments; radically changing the relationship between audience and performer especially in their piece ''Paradise Now''. The [[Judson Dance Theater]] located at the [[Judson Memorial Church]], [[New York City]], and the Judson dancers, notably [[Yvonne Rainer]], [[Trisha Brown]], [[Elaine Summers]], Sally Gross, Simonne Forti, [[Deborah Hay]], [[Lucinda Childs]], [[Steve Paxton]] and others collaborated with artists [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Robert Whitman]], [[John Cage]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], and engineers like [[Billy Klüver]]. These performances were often designed to be the creation of a new art form, combining sculpture, dance, and music or sound, often with audience participation. The works were characterized by the reductive philosophies of [[minimalism]], and the spontaneous improvisation, and expressivity of [[abstract expressionism]].

During the same period — the late 1950s through the mid-1960s various [[avant-garde]] artists created [[Happenings]]. Happenings were mysterious and often spontaneous and unscripted gatherings of artists and their friends and relatives in varied specified locations. Often incorporating exercises in absurdity, physical exercise, costumes, spontaneous [[nudity]], and various random and seemingly disconnected acts. [[Allan Kaprow]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Jim Dine]], [[Red Grooms]], and [[Robert Whitman]] among others were notable creators of Happenings.

===Fluxus===

{{main|Fluxus}}
Fluxus was named and loosely organized in 1962 by [[George Maciunas]] (1931–78), a Lithuanian-born American artist. Fluxus traces its beginnings to [[John Cage]]'s 1957 to 1959 Experimental Composition classes at the [[New School for Social Research]] in New York City. Many of his students were artists working in other media with little or no background in music. Cage's students included Fluxus founding members [[Jackson Mac Low]], [[Al Hansen]], [[George Brecht]] and [[Dick Higgins]].

Fluxus encouraged a do it yourself aesthetic, and valued simplicity over complexity. Like [[Dada]] before it, Fluxus included a strong current of anti-commercialism and an [[anti-art]] sensibility, disparaging the conventional market-driven art world in favor of an artist-centered creative practice. Fluxus artists preferred to work with whatever materials were at hand, and either created their own work or collaborated in the creation process with their colleagues.

[[Andreas Huyssen]] criticises attempts to claim Fluxus for postmodernism as, "either the master-code of postmodernism or the ultimately unrepresentable art movement – as it were, postmodernism's sublime."&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Huyssen, ''Twilight Memories: Marking Time in a Culture of Amnesia'', Routledge, 1995. p. 192. {{ISBN|0-415-90934-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead he sees Fluxus as a major [[Neo-Dada]]ist phenomena within the avant-garde tradition. It did not represent a major advance in the development of artistic strategies, though it did express a rebellion against, "the administered culture of the 1950s, in which a moderate, domesticated modernism served as ideological prop to the [[Cold War]]."&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Huyssen, ''Twilight Memories: Marking Time in a Culture of Amnesia'', Routledge, 1995. p. 196. {{ISBN|0-415-90934-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===High and low===

[[File:OtternessSculpture.JPG|thumb|Tom Otterness sculpture in Nelson A. Rockefeller Park, [[Battery Park City]], New York City]]
As a kind of response to [[Clement Greenberg]]'s ''[[Avant-Garde and Kitsch]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[Clement Greenberg]], ''Art and Culture'', Beacon Press, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; in 1990 [[Kirk Varnedoe]] and [[Adam Gopnik]] curated ''High and Low: Modern Art and Popular Culture'', at New York's [[Museum of Modern Art]]. The exhibition attempted to elucidate the extent that artists and high culture drew on and from popular culture. Although universally panned at the time as the only event that could bring Douglas Crimp and Hilton Kramer together in a chorus of scorn.&lt;ref&gt;''Kirk Varnedoe, 1946&amp;ndash;2003'' - Front Page - Obituary - [[Art in America]],  Oct, 2003 by Marcia E. Vetrocq&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition is remembered today as a benchmark of the conflict between late modernism and postmodernism.

==Movements associated with Postmodern art==

===Conceptual art===
{{main|Conceptual art}}

[[Conceptual art]] became an important development in contemporary art in the late 1960s, it delivered an influential critique on the status quo. Late modernism expanded and contracted during the late 1960s and for some, conceptual art made a complete break with modernism. Sometimes it is labelled as postmodern because it is expressly involved in [[deconstruction]] of what makes a work of art, "art". Conceptual art, because it is often designed to confront, offend or attack notions held by many of the people who view it, is regarded with particular controversy. Duchamp can be seen as a precursor to conceptual art. Thus, because ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' was exhibited, it was a sculpture. [[Marcel Duchamp]] famously gave up "art" in favor of [[chess]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcel Duchamp]]&lt;/ref&gt; Avant-garde composer [[David Tudor]] created a piece, ''Reunion'' (1968), written jointly with Lowell Cross that features a chess game, where each move triggers a lighting effect or projection. At the premiere, the game was played between [[John Cage]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Tudor]]&lt;/ref&gt; Some other famous examples being [[John Cage]]'s 4' 33" which is four minutes and thirty three seconds of silence and Rauschenberg's ''[[Erased De Kooning Drawing]]''.  Many conceptual works take the position that art is created by the viewer viewing an object or act as art, not from the intrinsic qualities of the work itself.

=== Installation art ===

{{main|Installation art}}
An important series of movements in art which have consistently been described as postmodern involved [[installation art]] and creation of artifacts that are conceptual in nature.  One example being the signs of [[Jenny Holtzer]] which use the devices of art to convey specific messages, such as "Protect Me From What I Want".  Installation Art has been important in determining the spaces selected for museums of contemporary art in order to be able to hold the large works which are composed of vast collages of manufactured and found objects. These installations and collages are often electrified, with moving parts and lights.

They are often designed to create environmental effects, as [[Christo and Jeanne-Claude]]'s ''Iron Curtain'' which was a row of barrels intended to create a [[traffic jam]].

=== Intermedia and multi-media ===

{{main|Intermedia}}

Another trend in art which has been associated with the term postmodern is the use of a number of different media together. [[Intermedia]], a term coined by [[Dick Higgins]] and meant to convey new artforms along the lines of [[Fluxus]], [[Concrete Poetry]], [[Found objects]], [[Performance art]], and [[Computer art]]. Higgins was the publisher of the [[Something Else Press]], a [[Concrete poet]], married to artist [[Alison Knowles]] and an admirer of [[Marcel Duchamp]]. [[Ihab Hassan]] includes, "Intermedia, the fusion of forms, the confusion of realms", in his list of the characteristics of postmodern art.&lt;ref&gt;Ihab Hassan in Lawrence E. Cahoone, ''From Modernism to Postmodernism: An Anthology'', Blackwell Publishing, 2003. p. 13. {{ISBN|0-631-23213-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most common forms of "multi-media art" is the use of video-tape and CRT monitors, termed [[Video art]]. While the theory of combining multiple arts into one art is quite old, and has been revived periodically, the postmodern manifestation is often in combination with [[performance art]], where the dramatic subtext is removed, and what is left is the specific statements of the artist in question or the conceptual statement of their action.

=== Appropriation art and neo-conceptual art ===

{{main|Appropriation art|neo-conceptual art}}
In his 1980 essay ''The Allegorical Impulse: Toward a Theory of Postmodernism'', [[Craig Owens (critic)|Craig Owens]] identifies the re-emergence of an [[allegorical]] impulse as characteristic of postmodern art. This impulse can be seen in the [[appropriation art]] of artists such as [[Sherrie Levine]] and [[Robert Longo]] because, "Allegorical imagery is appropriated imagery."&lt;ref&gt;Craig Owens, ''Beyond Recognition: Representation, Power, and Culture'', London and Berkeley: University of California Press (1992), p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; Appropriation art debunks modernist notions of artistic genius and originality and is more ambivalent and contradictory than modern art, simultaneously installing and subverting ideologies, "being both critical and complicit."&lt;ref&gt;Steven Best and Douglas Kellner, ''The Postmodern Turn'', Guilford Press, 1997. p. 186. {{ISBN|1-57230-221-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Neo-expressionism ===
{{main|Neo-expressionism}}

The return to the traditional art forms of sculpture and painting in the late 1970s and early 1980s seen in the work of [[Neo-expressionism|neo-expressionist]] artists such as [[Georg Baselitz]] and [[Julian Schnabel]] has been described as a postmodern tendency,&lt;ref&gt;Tim Woods, ''Beginning Postmodernism'', Manchester University Press, 1999. p. 125. {{ISBN|0-7190-5211-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the first coherent movements to emerge in the postmodern era.&lt;ref&gt;Fred S. Kleiner, Christin J. Mamiya, ''Gardner's Art Through the Ages: The Western Perspective'', Thomson Wadsworth, 2006, p. 842. {{ISBN|0-495-00480-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its strong links with the commercial art market has raised questions, however, both about its status as a postmodern movement and the definition of postmodernism itself. Hal Foster states that neo-expressionism was complicit with the conservative cultural politics of the Reagan-Bush era in the U.S.&lt;ref name=Foster36&gt;Hal Foster, ''The Return of the Real: The Avant-garde at the End of the Century'', MIT Press, 1996, p. 36. {{ISBN|0-262-56107-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Félix Guattari]] disregards the "large promotional operations dubbed 'neo-expressionism' in Germany", (an example of a "fad that maintains itself by means of publicity") as a too easy way for him "to demonstrate that postmodernism is nothing but the last gasp of modernism." These critiques of neo-expressionism reveal that money and public relations really sustained contemporary art world credibility in America during the same period that conceptual and feminist art practices were systematically reevaluating modern art.&lt;ref&gt;Erika Doss, ''Twentieth-Century American Art'', Oxford University Press, 2002, p. 210. {{ISBN|0-19-284239-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the 21st century contemporary painting, contemporary sculpture and contemporary art in general continues in several contiguous modes, characterized by the idea of [[Cultural pluralism|pluralism]]. The "crisis" in painting, sculpture and current art and current [[art criticism]] today is brought about by [[Cultural pluralism|pluralism]]. There is no consensus, nor need there be, as to a representative style of the age. There is an ''anything goes'' attitude that prevails; an "everything going on", and consequently "nothing going on" syndrome; this creates an aesthetic traffic jam with no firm and clear direction and with every lane on the artistic [[superhighway]] filled to capacity. Consequently, magnificent and important works of art continue to be made albeit in a wide variety of styles and aesthetic temperaments, the marketplace being left to judge merit. Frank Stella's ''La scienza della pigrizia'' (''The Science of Laziness''), from 1984, is an example of Stella's transition from two-dimensionality to three-dimensionality and an excellent example of Late Modernism.

[[Hard-edge painting]], [[geometric abstraction]], [[Appropriation (art)|appropriation]], [[hyperrealism]], [[photorealism]], [[expressionism]], [[minimalism]], [[lyrical abstraction]], [[pop art]], [[op art]], [[abstract expressionism]], [[color field painting]], [[monochrome painting]], [[neo-expressionism]], [[collage]], [[intermedia]] painting, [[Assemblage (art)|assemblage]] painting, [[digital painting]], [[postmodern]] painting, [[Neo-Dada]] painting, [[shaped canvas]] painting, environmental [[mural painting]], traditional [[figure painting]], [[landscape painting]], [[portrait painting]], are a few continuing and current directions in painting at the beginning of the 21st century. The New European Painting of the 1990s and the beginning of the 21st century, with painters like [[Gerhard Richter]], [[Bracha Ettinger]] and [[Luc Tuymans]], has opened a complex and interesting dialogue with the legacy of American color field and lyrical abstraction on the one hand and figurality on the other hand.

The '''Leuven Centre for Global Governance Studies''' is an interfaculty interdisciplinary research centre of the Humanities and Social Sciences at [[KU Leuven]], Belgium. It carries out and supports interdisciplinary research on topics related to globalization, global governance processes and multilateralism, and has been recognized as a KU Leuven Centre of Excellence.

== History and Research ==
The Leuven Centre for Global Governance Studies carries out and supports interdisciplinary research on topics related to globalization, global governance processes and multilateralism, with a particular focus on the following areas, taking the many cross-cutting issues into account: (i) the European Union and global governance, (ii) human rights, democracy and rule of law, (iii) trade and sustainable development, (iv) peace and security, (v) emerging powers, (vi) federalism and multi-level governance, (vii) global commons and outer space, and (viii) non-state actors.

In full recognition of the complex issues involved, the Centre approaches global governance from a multilevel and multi-actor perspective. The Centre considers non-European perspectives to global governance of great importance. It also hosts the InBev-Baillet Latour EU-China Chair,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ghum.kuleuven.be/ggs/projects/eu_china_chair|title=– InBev-Baillet Latour EU-China Chair|website=ghum.kuleuven.be}}&lt;/ref&gt; which engages in interdisciplinary research and education on EU-China relations in close synergy with the InBev-Baillet Latour EU-China Chair at the Université catholique de Louvain, and the Leuven India Focus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ghum.kuleuven.be/ggs/projects/india_focus|title=– Leuven India Focus|website=ghum.kuleuven.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which aims at developing knowledge and expertise on India and South Asia by organizing conferences, lectures and seminars and interdisciplinary research. The Centre regularly organizes transatlantic conferences and events focusing on Latin America and Asia, and takes a keen interest in the Global South.

In addition to its fundamental research, the Centre carries out independent applied research and advises policy-makers on multilateral governance and global public policy issues. It works with academic and policy partners from all over the world, including the [[European Parliament]], [[European Commission]], [[European External Action Service]], [[Committee of the Regions]], [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO), [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]] (UNIDO), [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD), [[World Bank]] and [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO). The Centre publishes the Leuven Global Governance Series&lt;ref&gt;http://www.e-elgar.com/search_results.lasso?series_title=Leuven%20Global%20Governance%20series&amp;series_search=Yes&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Edward Elgar Publishing|Edward Elgar Publishers]], makes it research available through academic journal articles, working papers, policy briefs and global governance opinions on its web site and regularly publishes a newsletter.

Since March 2011, the Centre is located in the historical house de Dorlodot&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ghum.kuleuven.be/ggs/contact.html|title=Contact Information|website=ghum.kuleuven.be}}&lt;/ref&gt; near the Centre of Leuven.

| Its significance for the biblical version of Israel's past, particularly in lines 8 and 9, which mention a "king of Israel" and a "[[Davidic line|house of David]]". The latter is generally understood by scholars to refer to the ruling dynasty of Judah. Although the meaning of this phrase has  been disputed by the  minority of scholars,{{sfn|Rainey|1994|p=47}} today it is generally accepted as a reference to [[Davidic dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Grabbe, Lester L.

(see [[Cuneiform law]]).
* [[Hittite texts]] and [[Nuzi Texts|Nuzi texts]] (17th century BCE and later)
* [[Minoan Eruption]] – pumice found at various Tels dated to Late Bronze Age
* [[Execration texts]] – earliest references to many Biblical locations
* [[Shiphrah]] slave list – Shiphrah was one of two midwives who helped prevent the [[genocide]] of Hebrew children by the Egyptians, according to the [[Book of Exodus]] 1:15–21. The name is found in a list of [[slavery|slaves]] in Egypt during the reign of [[Sobekhotep III]]. This list is on Brooklyn 35.1446, a papyrus scroll kept in the [[Brooklyn Museum]].

===1500 BCE===
* Tombs of [[Ahmose, son of Ebana]] and [[Ahmose Pen-Nekhebet]], record the earliest records of Egyptian control of Canaan. The Bible's depiction of Israel does not allow for Egyptian control over the area. {{citation needed|reason=Contradiction not apparent or obvious|date=December 2015}}
* [[Amarna letters]] (c. 13th century BCE) – correspondence on clay tablets between the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] administration and various Middle East kings petty sub-rulers in [[Canaan]] during the New Kingdom. The Bible's depiction of Canaan at this time (the period of the Judges) contradicts these records. {{citation needed|reason=Contradiction not apparent or obvious|date=December 2015}}
* [[Great Hymn to the Aten]] is seen to possess strong similarities to [[Psalm 104]], which may be based on it.
* [[Admonitions of Ipuwer|Ipuwer Papyrus]] (probably 18th century BCE) – poem describing Egypt as afflicted by natural disasters and in a state of chaos. The archeological evidence does not support the story of [[the Exodus]], and most histories of ancient Israel no longer consider it relevant to the story of Israel's emergence.{{sfn|Meyers|2005|p=5-6}}{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=81}} Nevertheless, Ipuwer is often put forward in popular literature as confirmation of the Biblical account, most notably because of its statement that "the river is blood" and its frequent references to servants running away. This ignores the many points on which Ipuwer contradicts Exodus, such as the fact that its Asiatics are arriving in Egypt rather than leaving, and the likelihood that the "river is blood" phrase may refer to the red sediment colouring the Nile during disastrous floods, or may simply be a poetic image of turmoil.{{sfn|Enmarch|2011|p=173-175}}
* North Wall of the [[Medinet Habu (temple)|Medinet Habu temple]] and the [[Papyrus Harris]] (c. 1150 BCE) – depicts the [[Ramesses III]]'s conquests in Canaan including the [[Battle of Djahy]]. This is not reflected in the Biblical history.

*[[Shebna Inscription|Shebna's lintel inscription]] – (8th–7th century BCE ?) found over the [[lintel]] or doorway of a tomb, has been ascribed to [[Hezekiah]]'s comptroller [[Shebna]].
*[[King Ahaz's Seal]] (732 to 716 BCE) – Ahaz was a king of Judah but "did not do what was right in the sight of the Lord his God, as his ancestor David had done" ({{bibleref2|2 Kings|16:2|NKJV}}; {{bibleref2|2 Chronicles|28:1|NKJV}}). He worshiped idols and followed pagan practices. "He even made his son pass through fire, according to the abominable practices of the nations" ({{bibleref2|2 Kings|16:3|NKJV}}). Ahaz was the son and successor of [[Jotham]].
*[[Bulla (seal)|Bullae]] (c.715–687 BCE or 716–687 BCE)&lt;ref&gt;See [[William F. Albright]] for the former and for the latter [[Edwin R. Thiele]]'s, ''The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings'' (3rd ed.; Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan/Kregel, 1983) 217. But [[Gershon Galil]] dates his reign to 697–642 BCE.&lt;/ref&gt; (clay roundels impressed with a personal seal identifying the owner of an object, the author of a document, etc.) are, like ostraka, relatively common, both in digs and on the antiquities market. The identification of individuals named in bullae with equivalent names from the Bible is difficult, but identifications have been made with king [[Hezekiah]]&lt;ref&gt;Grena (2004), p. 26, Figs. 9 and 10&lt;/ref&gt; and his servants (????? ''avadim'' in Hebrew).

However, Israelite and Judaean History, Old Testament Library. Edited by John H. Hayes and J. Maxwell Miller. London: SCM Press, 1977 says, "Recently, Na'aman [Nadav Na'aman. "Sennacherib's 'Letter to God' on His Campaign to Judah," BASOR CCXIV (1974) 25–39] has shown conclusively that the fragment presumably mentioning Azriau king of Yaudi actually belongs to the time of Sennacherib and refers not to Azariah but to Hezekiah. In Tiglath-Pileser's annals there are two references to an Azariah (in line 123 as Az-ri-a-[u] and in line 131 as Az-r-ja-a-í) but neither of these make any reference to his country. Thus the Azriau of Tiglath-pileser's annals and Azariah of the Bible should be regarded as two different individuals. Azriau's country cannot, at the present, be determined." Na'aman separates the country (Yaudi) from the name Azriau (p. 36). Also p. 28 on line 5 where the original transcription was "[I]zri-ja-u mat Ja-u-di" he reads "ina birit misrija u mat Jaudi". However, Kitchen, On the Reliability of the Old Testament (OROT), p. 18, is less dogmatic. He says "Hence we cannot certainly assert that this Azriau (without a named territory!) is Azariah of Judah; the matter remains open and undecided for the present and probably unlikely." See Also CAH, 3:35–36."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5D5GNju1-ggC&amp;pg=PA63#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''In Search of "Ancient Israel": A Study in Biblical Origins''] Philip R.

*[[Elephantine papyri]], ancient Jewish papyri dating to the 5th century BCE, name three persons mentioned in Nehemiah: [[Darius II]], [[Sanballat the Horonite]] and [[Johanan (High Priest)|Johanan]] the high priest.

===2nd century BCE===
*[[Hasmonean coinage]] (164 BCE – 35 BCE)

===1st century BCE===
*[[Western Wall]] – (c. 19 BCE) is an important Jewish religious site located in the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City of Jerusalem]]. Just over half the wall, including its 17 courses located below street level, dates from the end of the Second Temple period, being constructed around 19 BCE by [[Herod the Great]]. The remaining layers were added from the 7th century onwards.

===1st century CE===
*Rock of [[Calvary]] (Golgotha), identified by [[Constantine I|Constantine]]'s mother [[Helena (empress)|Saint Helena]] and [[Macarius of Jerusalem]], within the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]]
*Grotto of the Nativity, identified by [[Constantine I|Constantine]]'s mother [[Helena (empress)|Saint Helena]] and [[Macarius of Jerusalem]], within the [[Church of the Nativity]]
*[[Pilate Stone]] – (c. 36 CE)  carved inscription attributed to Pontius Pilate, a prefect of the Roman-controlled province of Judaea from 26–36 CE.
*[[Pool of Bethesda]] – in the nineteenth century, archaeologists discovered the remains of a pool corresponding to a description in John’s Gospel.
*[[Delphi Inscription]] – (c. 52 CE) The reference to proconsul Gallio in the inscription provides an important marker for developing a chronology of the life of Apostle Paul by relating it to the trial of Paul in Achaea mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles (18:12–17).

==Controversial==
*[[Borsippa]] – identified as the [[Tower of Babel]] in [[Talmudic]] and [[Arabic]] culture, but not accepted by modern scholarship.
*[[Ebla tablets]] – once thought to have made references to, and thus confirmed, the existence of Abraham, David and Sodom and Gomorrah among other Biblical references.
*[[Foundation Stone]] – stone also called the [[Well of Souls]], now located in the [[Dome of the Rock]]. According to the Bible, [[King David]] purchased a threshing floor owned by [[Araunah]] the [[Jebusite]],&lt;ref&gt;[[1 Chronicles]] 21:25, and [[2 Samuel]] 24:18–25.&lt;/ref&gt; and some believe that it was upon this rock that he offered the sacrifice mentioned in the verse.

'''Military engineering''' is loosely defined as the art, science, and practice of designing and building military works and maintaining lines of [[military transport]] and [[military communications]]. Military engineers are also responsible for [[logistics]] behind military tactics. Modern military engineering differs from [[civil engineering]]. In the 20th and 21st centuries, military engineering also includes other engineering disciplines such as mechanical and electrical engineering techniques.&lt;ref name="military engineering"&gt;{{cite web|title=military engineering|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/382334/military-engineering|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc|accessdate=13 February 2013|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[NATO]], "military engineering is that engineer activity undertaken, regardless of component or service, to shape the physical operating environment. Military engineering incorporates support to maneuver and to the force as a whole, including military engineering functions such as engineer support to force protection, counter-improvised explosive devices, environmental protection, engineer intelligence and military search. Military engineering does not encompass the activities undertaken by those 'engineers' who maintain, repair and operate vehicles, vessels, aircraft, weapon systems and equipment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=MC 0560 "MILITARY COMMITTEE POLICY FOR MILITARY ENGINEERING"|author=NATO publication|date=1 April 2008|publisher=NATO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Military engineering is an academic subject taught in [[military academies]] or [[School of Military Engineering (disambiguation)|schools of military engineering]]. The construction and demolition tasks related to military engineering are usually performed by military engineers including [[soldier]]s trained as [[sapper]]s or [[Pioneer (military)|pioneer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=From Crossbow to H-bomb|author=Bernard Brodie, Fawn McKay Brodie|year=1973 |publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-20161-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern armies, soldiers trained to perform such tasks while well forward in battle and under fire are often called [[combat engineer]]s.

In some countries, military engineers may also perform non-military construction tasks in peacetime such as [[flood control]] and river navigation works, but such activities do not fall within the scope of military engineering.

==Etymology==
The word ''engineer'' was initially used in the context of warfare, dating back to 1325 when ''engine’er'' (literally, one who operates an engine) referred to "a constructor of military engines".&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]]&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, "engine" referred to a military machine, i. e., a mechanical contraption used in war (for example, a [[catapult]]).

As the design of civilian structures such as bridges and buildings developed as a technical discipline, the term ''[[civil engineering]]''&lt;ref name="ECPD Definition on Britannica"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9105842/engineering Engineers' Council for Professional Development definition on Encyclopædia Britannica] (Includes Britannica article on Engineering)&lt;/ref&gt; entered the lexicon as a way to distinguish between those specializing in the construction of such non-military projects and those involved in the older discipline. As the prevalence of civil engineering outstripped engineering in a military context and the number of disciplines expanded, the original military meaning of the word "engineering" is now largely obsolete. In its place, the term "military engineering" has come to be used.

==History==
[[File:MulberryB - Piers.jpg|thumb|300px|Aerial view of [[Mulberry harbour]] "B" (27 October 1944)]]

The first civilization to have a dedicated force of military engineering specialists were the Romans, whose army contained a dedicated corps of military engineers known as [[Roman military engineering|''architecti'']]. This group was pre-eminent among its contemporaries. The scale of certain military engineering feats, such as the construction of a double-wall of fortifications {{convert|30|mi|km}} long, in just 6 weeks to completely encircle the besieged city of Alesia in 52 B.C.E., is an example. Such military engineering feats would have been completely new, and probably bewildering and demoralizing, to the Gallic defenders. The best known of these Roman army engineers due to his writings surviving is [[Vitruvius]].

In ancient times, military engineers were responsible for [[siege warfare]] and building field [[fortifications]], temporary camps and roads. The most notable engineers of ancient times were the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] and [[China|Chinese]], who constructed huge siege-machines (catapults, [[battering rams]] and [[siege tower]]s). The Romans were responsible for constructing [[Castra|fortified wooden camps]] and paved roads for their [[Roman legion|legions]]. Many of these [[Roman road]]s are still in use today.

For 500 years after the [[fall of the Roman empire]], the practice of military engineering barely evolved in the west. In fact, much of the classic techniques and practices of Roman military engineering were lost. Through this period, the foot soldier (who was pivotal to much of the Roman military engineering capability) was largely replaced by mounted soldiers. It was not until later in the [[Middle Ages]], that military engineering saw a revival focused on siege warfare.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Forces Publication, A-JS-007-003/JD-001 Customs and Traditions of the Canadian Military Engineers. 30 June 2003 [http://www.cmea-agmc.ca/redbook/CME_Customs_e.pdf]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Military engineers planned castles and fortresses. When laying siege, they planned and oversaw efforts to penetrate castle defenses. When [[castle]]s served a military purpose, one of the tasks of the [[sapper]]s was to weaken the bases of walls to enable them to be breached before means of thwarting these activities were devised. Broadly speaking, sappers were experts at demolishing or otherwise overcoming or bypassing fortification systems.

[[File:Royal Military Artificers working dress 1795.jpg|left|thumb|Working dress of the [[Soldier Artificer Company|Royal Military Artificers]] in Gibraltar, 1795]]
With the 14th-century development of [[gunpowder]], new [[siege engine]]s in the form of [[cannon]]s appeared. Initially military engineers were responsible for maintaining and operating these new weapons just as had been the case with previous siege engines. In England, the challenge of managing the new technology resulted in the creation of the [[Board of Ordnance|Office of Ordnance]] around 1370 in order to administer the cannons, armaments and castles of the kingdom. Both military engineers and [[artillery]] formed the body of this organization and served together until the office's predecessor, the Board of Ordnance was disbanded in 1855.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Museum |first=Royal Engineers |title=Corps History – Part 2 |url=http://www.remuseum.org.uk/corpshistory/rem_corps_part2.htm |accessdate=12 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204084632/http://www.remuseum.org.uk/corpshistory/rem_corps_part2.htm |archivedate=4 February 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In comparison to older weapons, the cannon was significantly more effective against traditional [[medieval fortification]]s. Military engineering significantly revised the way fortifications were built in order to be better protected from enemy direct and plunging shot. The new fortifications were also intended to increase the ability of defenders to bring fire onto attacking enemies. Fort construction proliferated in 16th-century Europe based on the ''[[trace italienne]]'' design.&lt;ref&gt;Langins, Janis.

[[File:Lawrence Alma-Tadema 12.jpeg|thumb|French sappers during the [[Battle of Berezina]] in 1812]]
By the 18th century, regiments of foot (infantry) in the British, French, Prussian and other armies included pioneer detachments. In peacetime these specialists constituted the regimental tradesmen, constructing and repairing buildings, transport wagons, etc. On active service they moved at the head of marching columns with axes, shovels, and pickaxes, clearing obstacles or building bridges to enable the main body of the regiment to move through difficult terrain. The modern [[Royal Welch Fusiliers]] and [[French Foreign Legion]] still maintain pioneer sections who march at the front of ceremonial parades, carrying chromium-plated tools intended for show only. Other historic distinctions include long work aprons and the right to wear beards.

The [[Peninsular War]] (1808–14) revealed deficiencies in the training and knowledge of officers and men of the [[British Army]] in the conduct of siege operations and bridging. During this war low-ranking [[Royal Engineers]] officers carried out large-scale operations. They had under their command working parties of two or three battalions of infantry, two or three thousand men, who knew nothing in the art of siegeworks. [[Royal Engineers]] officers had to demonstrate the simplest tasks to the soldiers, often while under enemy fire. Several officers were lost and could not be replaced, and a better system of training for siege operations was required. On 23 April 1812 an establishment was authorised, by Royal Warrant, to teach "Sapping, Mining, and other Military Fieldworks" to the junior officers of the Corps of [[Royal Engineers]] and the Corps of Royal Military Artificers, Sappers and Miners.

The first courses at the [[Royal Engineers]] Establishment were done on an all ranks basis with the greatest regard to economy. To reduce staff the NCOs and officers were responsible for instructing and examining the soldiers. If the men could not read or write they were taught to do so, and those who could read and write were taught to draw and interpret simple plans. The Royal Engineers Establishment quickly became the centre of excellence for all fieldworks and bridging. Captain [[Charles Pasley]], the director of the Establishment, was keen to confirm his teaching, and regular exercises were held as demonstrations or as experiments to improve the techniques and teaching of the Establishment. From 1833 bridging skills were demonstrated annually by the building of a pontoon bridge across the [[Medway]] which was tested by the infantry of the garrison and the cavalry from [[Maidstone]]. These demonstrations had become a popular spectacle for the local people by 1843, when 43,000 came to watch a field day laid on to test a method of assaulting earthworks for a report to the Inspector General of Fortifications. In 1869 the title of the Royal Engineers Establishment was changed to "The School of Military Engineering" (SME) as evidence of its status, not only as the font of engineer doctrine and training for the [[British Army]], but also as the leading scientific military school in Europe.

The dawn of the [[internal combustion engine]] marked the beginning of a significant change in military engineering. With the arrival of the [[History of the automobile|automobile]] at the end of the 19th century and [[Aviation history#Heavier than air|heavier than air flight]] at the start of the 20th century, military engineers assumed a major new role in supporting the movement and deployment of these systems in war. Military engineers gained vast knowledge and experience in [[explosive]]s. They were tasked with planting bombs, [[land mine|landmines]] and [[dynamite]].

At the end of [[World War I]], the standoff on the Western Front caused the [[Imperial German Army]] to gather experienced and particularly skilled soldiers to form "Assault Teams" which would break through the Allied trenches. With enhanced training and special weapons (such as [[flamethrower]]s), these squads achieved some success, but too late to change the outcome of the war. In early WWII, however, the [[Wehrmacht]] "Pioniere" battalions proved their efficiency in both attack and defense, somewhat inspiring other armies to develop their own combat engineers battalions. Notably, the attack on Fort [[Eben-Emael]] in Belgium was conducted by Luftwaffe [[military glider|glider]]-deployed combat engineers.

The need to defeat the German defensive positions of the "[[Atlantic wall]]" as part of the amphibious landings in Normandy in 1944 led to the development of specialist combat engineer vehicles. These, collectively known as [[Hobart's Funnies]], included a specific vehicle to carry combat engineers, the [[Churchill tank|Churchill AVRE]]. These and other dedicated assault vehicles were organised into the specialised [[79th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|79th Armoured Division]] and deployed during [[Operation Overlord]] – 'D-Day'.

Other significant military engineering projects of [[World War II]] include [[Mulberry harbour]] and [[Operation Pluto]].

Modern military engineering still retains the Roman role of building field [[fortification]]s, road paving and breaching terrain obstacles. A notable military engineering task was, for example, breaching the [[Suez Canal]] during the [[Yom Kippur War]].

== Education ==
Military engineers can come from a variety of engineering programs.  They may be graduates of [[Mechanical engineering|mechanical]], [[Electrical engineering|electrical]], [[Civil engineering|civil]], or [[industrial engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://study.com/articles/Become_a_Military_Engineer_Step-by-Step_Career_Guide.html|title=Become a Military Engineer: Step-by-Step Career Guide|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sub-discipline==
Modern military engineering can be divided into three main tasks or fields: combat engineering, strategic support, and ancillary support. Combat engineering is associated with engineering on the battlefield. Combat engineers are responsible for increasing mobility on the front lines of war such as digging trenches and building temporary facilities in war zones. Strategic support is associated with providing service in communication zones such as the construction of airfields and the improvement and upgrade of ports, roads and railways communication. Ancillary support includes provision and distribution of maps as well as the disposal of unexploded warheads. Military engineers construct bases, airfields, roads, bridges, ports, and hospitals. During peacetime before modern warfare, military engineers took the role of civil engineers by participating in the construction of civil-works projects. Nowadays, military engineers are almost entirely engaged in war logistics and preparedness.&lt;ref name="military engineering" /&gt;

==Institutions &amp; Professional Associations==
[[File:341st company building ribbon bridge.jpg|thumb|The American 341st Engineer Company building a ribbon bridge|alt=A group of soldiers in green fatigues assembling a bridge]]
The [[NATO]] Military Engineering Center of Excellence (MilEng CoE) is co-located with the [[German Army]] Military Engineer School in [[Ingolstadt]]. Prior to becoming a NATO CoE, the institute was known as the Euro NATO Training Engineer Centre (ENTEC) and it was located in [[Munich]]. As ENTEC, the institute was mandated to conduct military engineer interoperability training for participating nations. As the MilEng CoE, the institute's mandate has expanded to include doctrine and NATO standardization agreements ([[STANAG]]s) related to military engineering.

==Military engineering by country==
Military engineers are key in all armed forces of the world, and invariably found either closely integrated into the force structure, or even into the combat units of the national troops.

These skills provide vital components in the Army's operational capability, and [[Royal Engineers]] are currently deployed in [[Afghanistan]], [[Iraq]], [[Cyprus]], [[Bosnia]], [[Kosovo]], [[Kenya]], [[Brunei]], [[Falklands]], [[Belize]], Germany and [[Northern Ireland]]. [[Royal Engineers]] also take part in exercises in [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Kuwait]], Italy, [[Egypt]], [[Jordan]], Canada, [[Poland]] and the United States.

;United States:
{{main|Military engineering of the United States}}
The prevalence of military engineering in the United States dates back to the American Revolutionary War when engineers would carry out tasks in the U.S. Army. During the war, they would map terrain to and build fortifications to protect troops from opposing forces. The first military engineering organization in the United States was the Army Corps of Engineers. Engineers were responsible for protecting military troops whether using fortifications or designing new technology and weaponry throughout the United States’ history of warfare. The Army originally claimed engineers exclusively, but as the U.S. military branches expanded to the sea and sky, the need for military engineering sects in all branches increased. As each branch of the United States military expanded, technology adapted to fit their respective needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chambers|first=John|title=Engineering, Military|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/military_engineering.aspx#1|publisher=Encyclopedia.com|accessdate=14 February 2013|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National University of Cuyo''' ({{lang-es|Universidad Nacional de Cuyo}}, UNCuyo) is the largest center of higher education in the [[provinces of Argentina|province]] of [[Mendoza Province|Mendoza]], [[Argentina]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

As of 2005, the university had 12 academic schools in the city of [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]] and a delegation in the city of [[San Rafael, Mendoza|San Rafael]] (province of Mendoza), in addition to the [[Balseiro Institute]], which is the most developed institute of Physics research in Argentina, located in the city of [[San Carlos de Bariloche]] (province of [[Río Negro Province|Río Negro]]). It includes the University Technological Institute which offers technical education in four other cities in Mendoza province. Moreover, UNCuyo is also devoted to improving education due to having 7 other buildings working as High Schools:

* C.U.C. (Colegio Universitario Central "Gral. Jose de San Martin")
* Escuela de Comercio Martín Zapata
* Liceo Agrícola Domingo Faustino Sarmiento
* Escuela del Magisterio
* Escuela de Agricultura
* D.A.D (Departamento de Aplicación Docente)
* Escuela Carmen Vera Arenas
[[File:Campus UNCuyo.jpg|thumb|Campus]]

==History==
The UNCuyo was established on March 21, 1939 by the presidential decree 26971. The university was established to offer tertiary education provision in the region of [[Cuyo (Argentina)|Cuyo]] (the provinces of Mendoza, [[San Juan Province (Argentina)|San Juan]] and [[San Luis Province|San Luis]]). At its foundation the university was composed of some existing higher education colleges, and new ones were incorporated. Regional affiliations were established in Human Sciences, Medicine, Agronomy and Economics in Mendoza, Engineering and Architecture in San Juan, and Natural Sciences in San Luis. These links remained in place until 1973. That year the [[National University of San Juan]] and the [[National University of San Luis]] were established from the adjunct faculties of the National University of Cuyo already in these regions. Thereafter, the National University of Cuyo concentrated itself in Mendoza, in addition to a campus in Río Negro Province: the [[Balseiro Institute]].

==Recent research==
In recent research conducted by UNCuyo's students it was discovered how methods of cutting and preparing food can affect how many nutrients are retained in a meal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2008/HEALTH/diet.fitness/06/30/cl.bringing.out.best/index.html#cnnSTCText?iref=werecommend Coax flavor, nutrition from produce with proper care, handling]&lt;/ref&gt; Notably they found that the thiosulfinates (that inhibit platelet aggregation and microparticle shedding) found in garlic and onions do not form until crushing or cutting. The research also demonstrated that steaming instead boiling is preferable as vegetables retain more of their water-soluble vitamins.

'''Natural evil''' is [[evil]] for which “no non-divine agent can be held morally responsible for its occurrence.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Nick |last=Trakakis|title=The Evidential Problem of Evil |work=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy (IEP) |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/evil-evi/#SH1b}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, [[moral evil]] is “caused by human activity.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princeton.edu/~grosen/puc/phi203/evil.html|title=The Problem of Evil|work=princeton.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of natural evil challenges belief in the [[omnibenevolence]] or the [[omnipotence]] of [[deities]] and the existence of deities including [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Martin, ''Atheism: A Philosophical Justification'' (Temple University Press, 1992), 412.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature of natural evil==
Moral evil results from a perpetrator, or one who acts intentionally and in so doing has flouted some duty or engaged in some vice. Natural evil has only victims, and is generally taken to be the result of natural processes. The "evil" thus identified is evil only from the perspective of those affected and who perceive it as an affliction. Examples include cancer, birth defects, tornadoes, earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, [[Act of God|acts of God]], and other phenomena which inflict suffering with apparently no accompanying mitigating good. Such phenomena inflict "evil" on victims with no perpetrator to blame.

In the [[Bible]], God is portrayed as both the ultimate creator and perpetrator, since the “sun, moon and stars, celestial activity, clouds, dew, frost, hail, lightning, rain, snow, thunder, and wind are all subject to God's command.”&lt;ref&gt;''Baker's Evangelical Dictionary'', s.v. “Providence of God.”&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of natural evils ascribed to God follow:

[[File:118.Job Hears of His Misfortunes.jpg|thumb|[[Gustave Doré]]: ''Doré's English Bible'' "[[Job (biblical figure)|Job]] Hears of His Misfortunes" (Job 1:1-22)]]
:* Floods: God brought “a flood of waters on the earth” (Genesis 6:17).
:* Thunder, hail, lightning: God “sent thunder and hail, and fire came down” (Exodus 9:23).
:* Destructive Wind: God sent a “great wind” that destroyed Job’s house and killed his family ([[Book of Job|Job]] 1:19).
:* Earthquake: By the Lord “the earth will be shaken” (Isaiah 13:13).
:* Drought and Famine: God will shut off rains, so neither land nor trees yield produce (Leviticus 26:19-20).
:* Forest fires: God says, “Say to the southern forest, 'I will kindle a fire in you, and it shall devour every green tree in you and every dry tree'” (Ezekiel 20:47).

Traditional theism (e.g. [[Thomas Aquinas]]) distinguishes between God's will and God's permission, claiming that while God permits evil, he does not will it.&lt;ref&gt;David Bentley Hart, ''The Doors of the Sea: Where Was God in the Tsunami?'' (William B. Eerdmans, 2005), pp. 82–89.&lt;/ref&gt;  This distinction is echoed by some modern [[open theism|open theists]], e.g. [[Gregory A. Boyd]], who writes, "Divine goodness does not completely control or in any sense will evil."&lt;ref&gt;Gregory A. Boyd, God at War: the Bible and Spiritual Conflict (InterVarsity Press,1997) 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas partly explained this in terms of primary and secondary [[causality]], whereby God is the primary (or transcendent) cause of the world, but not the secondary (or immanent) cause of everything that occurs in it. Such accounts explain the presence of natural evil through the story of the [[Fall of man]], which affected not only human beings, but nature as well (Genesis 3:16–19).

Especially since the Reformation the distinction between God's will and God's permission, and between primary and secondary causality, has been disputed, notably by [[John Calvin]]. Among modern inheritors of this tradition, Mark R. Talbot ascribes evil to God: “God’s foreordination is the ultimate reason why everything comes about, including the existence of all evil persons and things and the occurrence of any evil acts or events.”&lt;ref&gt;Mark R. Talbot, “All the Good That Is Ours in Christ,” in Suffering and the Sovereignty of God, ed. John Piper and Justin Taylor, 43-44 (Crossway Books, 2006). Available online at [http://www.desiringgod.org/ResourceLibrary/OnlineBooks/ByTitle/ desiringgod.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Such models of God's complete foreordination and direct willing of everything that happens lead to the doctrines of [[double predestination]] and [[limited atonement]].&lt;ref&gt;David Bentley Hart, ''The Doors of the Sea: Where Was God in the Tsunami?'' (William B. Eerdmans, 2005), pp. 89–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural versus moral evil==
{{Main|Moral evil}}
[[Jean Jacques Rousseau]] responded to [[Voltaire|Voltaire's]] criticism of the optimists by pointing out that the [[value judgement]] required in order to declare the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]] a natural evil ignored the fact that the human endeavour of the construction and organization of the city of Lisbon was also to blame for the horrors recounted as they had contributed to the level of suffering. It was, after all, the collapsing buildings, the fires, and the close human confinement that led to much of the death.

The question of whether [[natural disaster]]s such as [[hurricane]]s might be natural or moral evil is complicated by new understandings of the effects, such as [[global warming]], of our [[collective action]]s on events that were previously considered to be out of our control. Nonetheless, even before the beginning of the Industrial Revolution (which many believe was the beginning point of global warming), natural disasters (e.g., earthquakes, volcanoes, tsunamis, flooding, fires, disease, etc.) occurred regularly, and cannot be ascribed to the actions of humans. However, human actions exacerbate the evil effects of natural disasters. The [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF) says human activity is a key factor that turns “extreme weather events into greater natural disasters.” For example, “deforestation and floodplain development” by humans turn high rainfall into “devastating floods and mudslides." When humans damage coastal reefs, remove mangroves, destroy dune systems, or clear coastal forests, "extreme coastal events cause much more loss of life and damage.” Damage by tsunamis varied “according to the extent of reef protection and remaining mangrove coverage.” 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expatica.com/fr/news/local_news/Natural-disasters-made-worse-by-human-activity-_43194.html|title=Natural disasters made worse by human activity|work=expatica.com|accessdate=August 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, human development has “contributed to more frequent and regular floods.”&lt;ref&gt;“Natural Disasters Made Worse by Human Activity” (May 20, 2008), [http://www.expatica.com/fr/news/local_news/Natural-disasters-made-worse-by-human-activity-_43194.html# Expatica.com], accessed December 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In earthquakes, people often suffer injury or death because of “poorly designed and constructed buildings.”&lt;ref&gt;“UN Says Poor Construction to Blame for Earthquake Deaths — May 19, 2008,” [http://www.expatica.com/fr/news/local_news/UN-says-poor-construction-to-blame-for-earthquake-deaths-_43155.html Expatica.com], accessed December 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, wildfires that destroy lives and property aren't "entirely natural.” Some fires are caused by human action and the damage inflicted is sometimes magnified by building “in remote, fire-prone areas.”&lt;ref&gt;“Southern California Forest Fires,”  [http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/top10/article/0,30583,1686204_1686252_1690605,00.html time.com], accessed December 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Dusty conditions in the West that “can cause significant human health problems” have been shown to be “a direct result of human activity and not part of the natural system."&lt;ref&gt;“Dust in West up 500 Percent in Past 2 Centuries, says CU-Boulder Study,” [http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-02/uoca-diw022208.php eurekalert.org], accessed December 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In sum, there is evidence that some "natural" evil results from human activity and, therefore, contains an element of moral evil.

==Challenge to religious belief==
Natural evil (also non-moral or surd evil) is a term generally used in discussions of the [[problem of evil]] and [[theodicy]] that refers to states of affairs which, considered in themselves, are those that are part of the natural world, and so are independent of the intervention of a human [[Agency (philosophy)|agent]]. Both natural and moral evil are a challenge to religious believers. Many atheists claim that natural evil is proof that there is no God, at least not an [[omnipotent]], [[Omnibenevolence|omnibenevolent]] one, as such a being would not allow such evil to happen to his/her creation. However, the [[deist]] position states that intervention by God to prevent such actions (or any intervention) is not an attribute of God.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2884">The '''Papyrus Graecus Holmiensis''' (also known as the '''Stockholm papyrus''') is a collection of craft recipes compiled in [[Egypt]] {{circa|300 AD}}. It is written in [[Greek language|Greek]]. The Stockholm papyrus has 154 recipes for dyeing, coloring gemstones, cleaning (purifying) pearls, and imitation gold and silver.&lt;ref&gt;Caley, E. R. (1927) “The Stockholm Papyrus : An English Translation with brief notes”  Journal of Chemical Education  IV:8 : 979-1002.&lt;/ref&gt; Certain of them may derive from the [[Pseudo-Democritus]].  [[Zosimos of Panopolis]], a Greek [[Alchemy|alchemist]] of {{circa|300 AD}}, gives similar recipes. Some of these recipes are found in medieval Latin collections of technological recipes, notably the [[Mappae clavicula]].

[[Leyden papyrus X]] derives from the same (or very similar) sources, and is written in a similar (possibly the same) hand, using chemically identical ink.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Papyrus Graecus Holmiensis | work = World Digital Library | accessdate = 2014-11-25 | url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/14299/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Long2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Long|first=Pamela O.|title=Openness, secrecy, authorship: technical arts and the culture of knowledge from antiquity to the Renaissance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x_k91r2u6NgC|accessdate=1 June 2011|year=2001|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=9780801866067|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Stockholm papyrus and Leyden papyrus X were both found in Thebes by [[Giovanni Anastasi (merchant)|Giovanni Anastasi]], who donated the Leyden papyrus to the Dutch government in 1828 and the Stockholm papyrus to the Swedish government in 1832.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7636">'''Philosophical counseling''', also sometimes called '''philosophical practice''', is a contemporary movement in [[practical philosophy]].  Developing since the 1980s, practitioners of philosophical counseling ordinarily have a doctorate or minimally a master's degree in philosophy and offer their philosophical counseling or consultation services to clients who look for a philosophical understanding of their lives, social problems, or even mental problems. In the last case philosophical counseling might be in lieu of, or in conjunction with, traditional [[psychotherapy]]. The movement has often been said to be rooted in the [[Socrates|Socratic tradition]], which viewed philosophy as a search for the Good and the good life. A life without [[philosophy]] was not worth living for Socrates.

==History ==
Peter Koestenbaum at San Jose State University in California was an early figure in Philosophical Counseling. His 1978 book ''The New Image of the Person: The Theory and Practice of Clinical Philosophy'' set out the essential contributions of philosophy to counseling. His own practice was augmented by extensive training of mental health professionals in applications of philosophical principles.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pib.net/bio_peter.htm | accessdate=2014-05-15&lt;/ref&gt;

The world's oldest association of philosophical counseling and practice appears to be the German Society for Philosophical Practice and Counseling, which was founded in 1982 by the German philosopher, [[Gerd B. Achenbach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://sites.google.com/site/thephilosophicalcounselingweb/home/ |title= The Philosophical Practice and Counseling Website|author= Center Sophon|accessdate= 2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the oldest association of philosophical counseling and practice appears to be the National Philosophical Counseling Association (NPCA), formerly called the American Society for Philosophy, Counseling, and Psychotherapy, which was co-founded in 1992 by three American philosophers, Elliot D. Cohen, Paul Sharkey, and Thomas Magnell. The NPCA offers a primary certificate in [[logic-based therapy]] (LBT) through the Institute of Critical Thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.npcassoc.org/ |title= National Philosophical Counseling Association - Official Website | accessdate=2014-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Philosophical Practitioners Association (APPA) was founded in 1998 in New York City by Professor Lou Marinoff.  APPA offers a certification program in client counseling for those with advanced degrees in philosophy who wish to practice philosophical counseling.  It also publishes a professional Journal and has a membership list of those certified as philosophical counselors on its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.appa.edu/ |title= American Philosophical Practitioners Association - Official Website | accessdate=2012-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marinoff was at the center of a 2004 controversy when his philosophical counseling practice at [[City College of New York]] was temporarily shuttered by college officials who feared he was offering mental health advice without proper training and licensing; Marinoff responded by suing for what he described as his [[freedom of speech]] being stifled.&lt;ref name=Duane2004/&gt;

There are presently a number of professional associations for philosophical counseling throughout the world, including France, Belgium, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Great Britain, Italy, Spain, Greece, the Netherlands, Norway, Denmark, Poland, Finland, Luxembourg, Israel, Canada, South Africa, Australia, Brazil, Portugal, Korea, Turkey, Japan, Taiwan, Singapore and the United States.

==Goals and methods==
According to the Preamble of the NPCA Standards of Practice,
:a philosophical practitioner helps clients to clarify, articulate, explore and comprehend philosophical aspects of their belief systems or world views....Clients may consult philosophical practitioners for help in exploring philosophical problems related to such matters as mid-life crises, career changes, stress, emotions, assertiveness, physical illness, death and dying, aging, meaning of life, and morality. On the other side philosophical practitioners also initiate projects in common life worlds with various goals that are related to essential problems of life, such as sustainable energy, direct democracy, etc. 
Activities common to philosophical practice include:
# the examination of clients' arguments and justifications
# the clarification, analysis, and definition of important terms and concepts
# the exposure and examination of underlying assumptions and logical implications
# the exposure of conflicts and inconsistencies
# the exploration of traditional philosophical theories and their significance for client issues
# the initiation of projects for common goods 
# all other related activities that have historically been identified as philosophical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://npcassoc.org/documents/ |title= Standards of Practice|author= ASPCP|accessdate= 2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The methods and orientations of philosophical counselors vary greatly. Some practitioners, such as [[Gerd B. Achenbach]] (Germany), [[Michel Weber]] (Belgium) and [[Shlomit C. Schuster]] (Israel) are dialogical and dialective engaged, while confessing to a "beyond method" approach. They hold that philosophical counseling has the aim to empower clients' philosophical abilities, which additionally may have therapeutic implications.&lt;ref&gt;Schuster, S.C. (1999). [http://www.abc-clio.com/product.aspx?id=2147498636 ''Philosophy Practice: An Alternative to Counseling and Psychotherapy''.] Westport, CT:[[Praeger Publishers|Praeger]]; cf. [[Michel Weber]]'s own blend of [https://chromatika.academia.edu/MichelWeber praxis].&lt;/ref&gt;  "Others are directive oriented and view philosophical counseling as a form of mental health intervention".&lt;ref&gt;Raabe, P. (2001). ''Philosophical Counseling.'' Westport, CT: [[Praeger Publishers|Praeger]].&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophical practitioners, notably Louis Marinoff (U.S.) and Guenther Witzany (Austria), view philosophical practice as a separate practice area distinct from mental health practices such as psychology and mental health counseling;&lt;ref&gt;Guenther Witzany (ed) (1991). Zur Theorie der Philosophischen Praxis. Essen. {{ISBN|3-89206-407-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; while others, notably Elliot D. Cohen (U.S.), think they are necessarily intertwined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://npcassoc.org/journal/table-of-contents/vol-2-no-2/ |title= Philosophy with Teeth:  The Wedding of Philosophical and Psychological Practices|author= Elliot D. Cohen|accessdate= 2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophical counselors draw inspiration from the [[anti-psychiatry]] movement, arguing that widespread mental health diagnostic criteria as outlined in [[DSM IV]] have unfairly or inaccurately [[psychopathology|pathologized]] humanity.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Z. Kotkowicz (1997). ''R.D. Laing and the Paths of Anti-Psychiatry'', NY: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a ''New York Times'' article on philosophical counseling, "only Cohen and Marinoff have branded easily comprehended techniques. Cohen's [[logic-based therapy]] builds on the work of his mentor [[Albert Ellis]], who invented [[rational emotive behavior therapy]]."&lt;ref name=Duane2004&gt;{{cite news |last=Duane |first=Daniel |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/21/magazine/the-socratic-shrink.html?src=pm |title= The Socratic Shrink |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |date=2004-03-21 |accessdate=2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Positive political theory''' or '''explanatory political theory''' is the study of [[politics]] using formal methods such as [[social choice theory]],  [[game theory]], and [[statistical analysis]]. In particular, social choice theoretic methods are often used to describe and (axiomatically) analyze the performance of rules or institutions.  The outcomes of the rules or institutions described are then analyzed by game theory, where the individuals/parties/nations involved in a given interaction are modeled as ''rational'' agents playing a game, guided by self-interest.  
Based on this assumption, the outcome of the interactions can be predicted as an equilibrium of the game.

The founder of the field was [[William H. Riker]]. In his book ''[[The Theory of Political Coalitions]]'' (1962), he applied the principles of [[game theory]] to the study of politics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33799">'''Mythology''' is the [[myth and ritual|main component]] of '''Religion'''. It refers to systems of concepts that are of high importance to a certain community, making statements concerning the [[supernatural]] or [[sacred]]. Religion is the broader term, besides mythological system, it includes [[ritual]]. A given [[mythology]] is almost always associated with a certain religion such as [[Greek mythology]] with [[Ancient Greek religion]]. Disconnected from its religious system, a myth may lose its immediate relevance to the community and evolve—away from sacred importance—into a [[legend]] or [[Folklore|folktale]]. 

There is a complex relationship between [[myth and ritual|recital of myths and enactment of rituals]].

==Introduction==
{{See also|Myth and ritual}}
The relationship between religion and myth depends on what definition of "myth" one uses. By [[Robert Graves]]'s definition, a religion's [[Traditional story|traditional stories]] are "myths" if and only if one does not belong to the religion in question. By Segal's definition, all religious stories are myths—but simply because nearly all [[Narrative|stories]] are myths. By the [[Folklore studies|folklorists]]' definition, all myths are religious (or "sacred") stories, but not all religious stories are myths: religious stories that involve the [[Creation myth|creation of the world]] (e.g., the stories in the [[Book of Genesis]]) are myths; however, some religious stories that don't explain how things came to be in their present form (e.g., [[Hagiography|hagiographies]] of famous [[saint]]s) are not myths. Generally, mythology is the main component of religion alongside ritual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=KERYGMA AND MYTH by Rudolf Bultmann and Five Critics edited by Hans Werner Bartsch |last=Bultmann |first=Rudolf |year=2005 |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |url=https://www.religion-online.org/book-chapter/the-mythological-element-in-the-message-of-the-new-testament-and-the-problem-of-its-re-interpretation-part-i/ |page=21}}: "The cosmology of the New Testament is essentially mythical in character."&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|1={{harvnb|Rue|2005|pp=315}}: religious traditions are, essentially, mythic traditions}}{{refn|1={{harvnb|Rue|2005|pp=144-145}}: "At the core of every religious tradition there is found a narrative vision, a myth unifying ultimate reality and value, a story that is expressed, transmitted, and revitalized by a variety of ancillary strategies."}}{{refn|1={{harvnb|Leeming|2005|loc=Introduction, xi}}: "Religious stories are “holy scripture” to believers — narratives used to support, explain, or justify a particular system’s rituals, theology, and ethics — and are myths to people of other cultures or belief systems."}}{{refn|1={{harvnb|Gieysztor|1982|p=5}}: "Przez mitologię, stanowiącą część główną religii, rozumiemy system personifikacji, alegorii i symboliki, które wyrażały stosunek człowieka do świata.

But, of course, stories such as the [[Crossing the Red Sea|parting of the Sea of Reeds]] for the fleeing [[Israelites|Hebrews]], [[Muhammad]]’s [[Isra and Mi'raj|Night Journey]], and the dead [[Resurrection of Jesus|Jesus rising from the tomb]] are just as clearly [[Irrationality|irrational]] narratives to which a [[Hindu]] or a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] might understandably apply the word “myth.” All of these stories are definable as myths because they contain events that contradict both our intellectual and physical experience of [[reality]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Most definitions of "myth" limit myths to stories.&lt;ref&gt;Segal 2004, p. 5. See Buxton, p. 18: "There are three elements in [my] definition [of mythology]. '''The least problematic''' is the notion of ''story'': a 'myth' is a narrative, a set of events structured into a sequence". (Bolding added)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, non-narrative elements of religion, such as ritual, are not myths.
===Theology and myth===
The term [[theology]] for the first time appears in the writings of the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] philosophers [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]. Initially, theology and mythology were synonymous. With time, both terms gained distinctive qualities:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Britannica |title=Theology |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/theology |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180818084404/https://www.britannica.com/topic/theology |archive-date=2018-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the first place, theology is a spiritual or religious attempt of “believers” to explicate their faith. In this sense it is not neutral and is not attempted from the perspective of removed observation—in contrast to a general history of religions. The implication derived from the religious approach is that it does not provide a formal and indifferent scheme devoid of presuppositions within which all religions could be subsumed. In the second place, theology is influenced by its origins in the Greek and Christian traditions, with the implication that the transmutation of this concept to other religions is endangered by the very circumstances of origination.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
According to Hege, both primitive and modern theology is inescapably constrained by its mythical backbone:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hege |first=Brent A. R.|title=Myth, History, and the Resurrection in German Protestant Theology |year=2017 |p=132 |url=https://books.google.pl/books?id=SSA6DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA132}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[Hermeneutics|Hermeneutically]], theologians must recognize that mythical thought permeates the [[Bible|biblical texts]]. [[Dogma|Dogmatically]], theologians must be aware of the mythological elements of theology and of how extensively theology relies on mythical forms and functions, especially in light of our awareness of the ubiquity of myth.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Religion===
''[[Religion]]'' is a belief concerning the supernatural, sacred, or [[Divinity|divine]], and the [[moral code]]s, practices, values, and institutions associated with such belief, although some scholars, such as Durkheim, would argue that the supernatural and the divine are not aspects of all religions.&lt;ref&gt;"Religion", ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Religious beliefs and practices may include the following: a [[deity]] or higher being, [[eschatology]], practices of [[worship]], practices of [[ethics]] and [[politics]]. Some religions do not include all these features. For instance, belief in a deity is not essential to [[Buddhism]].

===Mythology===
The term ''[[mythology]]'' usually refers either to a system of myths or to the study of myths.&lt;ref&gt;"Mythology", ''OED'', 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the word "myth" itself has multiple (and some contradictory) definitions:
* 2007: According to the [[Merriam-Webster]] Dictionary, "Myth: "1 a: a usually traditional story of ostensibly historical events that serves to unfold part of the [[world view]] of a people or explain a practice, belief, or natural phenomenon. b: [[Parable]], [[Allegory]]. 2 a: a popular belief or tradition that has grown up around something or someone; especially: one embodying the ideals and institutions of a society or segment of [[society]]. 2b: an unfounded or false notion. 3: a person or thing having only an imaginary or unverifiable existence. 4: the whole body of myths.&lt;ref&gt;"Myth", Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In regards to the study of culture and religion, these are some of the definitions scholars have used:

* 1968: The [[classicist]] [[Robert Graves]] defines myths as "whatever religious or heroic legends are so foreign to a student's experience that he cannot believe them to be true."&lt;ref&gt;Graves 1968, p. v.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1973: Another classicist, GS Kirk, rejects the notion that all myths are religious or sacred. In the category of "myth", he includes many legendary accounts that are "[[Secularity|secular]]" for all practical purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Kirk 1973, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1997: [[Folklorist]]s define a myth as "a sacred [[narrative]] explaining how the world and humankind came to be in their present form".&lt;ref&gt;Dundes 1997, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2004: In religious studies, the word "myth" is usually reserved for stories whose main characters are gods or [[demigod]]s.&lt;ref name="Segal 2004, p. 5"&gt;Segal 2004, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2004: The classicist Richard Buxton defines a myth as "a socially powerful traditional story".&lt;ref&gt;Buxton, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2004: Robert A. Segal, professor of theories of religion at the [[Lancaster University]], defines "myth" broadly as any story whose "main figures [are] personalities -- divine, human, or even animal. Excluded would be impersonal forces such as Plato's Good."&lt;ref name="Segal 2004, p. 5"/&gt;

==Similarities between different religious mythologies==

Given any of the above definitions of "myth", the myths of many religions, both ancient and modern, share common elements. Widespread similarities between religious mythologies include the following:
* an initial [[Paradise]] preceding ordinary historical time&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', 1967 p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;
* the story of a god who undergoes death and resurrection ([[life-death-rebirth deity]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://altreligion.about.com/library/weekly/aa052902a.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paganlibrary.com/reference/pagan_resurrection_myths.php]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The mythical geography of many religions involves an ''[[axis mundi]]'', or Cosmic Center.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Rites, Symbols: A Mircea Eliade Reader'', 1976, pp. 372-75.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Many myths feature a global flood.&lt;ref&gt;For some examples, see Bierlein 2004, pp. 121-27.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Creation myth]]s
* [[Supreme deity (disambiguation)|Supreme deity]]&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt;
* [[Hero's journey]]

The similarities between cultures and time periods can be useful, but it is usually not easy to combine beliefs and histories from different groups. Simplification of cultures and time periods by eliminating detailed data remain vulnerable or flimsy in this area of research.

==Contrasts between different religious mythologies==

Though there are similarities among most religious mythologies, there are also contrasts. Many mythologies focus on explanations of the universe, natural phenomena, or other themes of human existence, often ascribing [[creation myth|agency]] to one or more [[deities]] or other [[supernatural]] forces. However, some religions have very few of this kind of story of cosmic explanation. For instance,  the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[parable of the arrow]] warns against such speculations as "[Is] the world eternal or not eternal? [Is] the soul different from the body? [Does] the enlightened exist after death or not?", viewing them as irrelevant to the goal of escaping suffering.&lt;ref&gt;"The Parable of the Arrow"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic views==
In [[academia]], the term "myth" often refers to stories whose culture regards them as true (as opposed to fictitious).&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p. 1, 8-10; ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, many scholars will call a body of stories "mythology", leaving open the question of whether the stories are true or false. For example, in ''Tree of Souls: The Mythology of Judaism'', English professor Howard Schwartz writes, "the definition of 'mythology' offered here does not attempt to determine if biblical or subsequent narratives are true or false, i.e., historically accurate or not".&lt;ref name="Schwartz, p. lxxviii"&gt;Schwartz, p. lxxviii&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the beginning of modern philosophy and science in the 16th century, many Western intellectuals have seen myth as outdated.&lt;ref&gt;See Armstrong, pp. 122-27. For example, an 18th century intellectual movement called [[deism]] rejected myths about divine intervention, limiting God's role to that of a first cause (Robinson), and a 20th century movement led by the theologian [[Rudolf Bultmann]] sought to "demythologize" Christianity, reinterpreting its myths as psychological allegory (Segal, pp. 47-51; Muthuraj). Some 19th and early 20th century secular scholars predicted that science would replace myth, even in religion. The anthropologist [[Edward Burnett Tylor]] argued that science was pushing traditional mythology out of religion, which would henceforth consist only of metaphysics and ethics (Segal, p. 14). And the anthropologist [[Sir James George Frazer]] even wrote, "In the last analysis, magic, religion, and science are nothing but theories of thought; and as science has supplanted its predecessors, so it may hereafter be itself superseded by some more perfect hypothesis" (Frazer, p. 712).&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, some argued that the Christian religion would be better off without mythology, or even that Christianity would be better off without religion:&lt;ref name="Muthuraj"&gt;Muthuraj&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;[J. A. T.] Robinson argued in favor of "the detaching of the Christian doctrine of God from any necessary dependence on a 'supernaturalistic' worldview". He understood this as a prophetic aspect of the Church's ministry to the world. [...] At this time atheism was regarded as the Christian Gospel that should be preached to the world. J. J. Altizer, for example, maintained [this] boldly by stating, "Throughout its history Christian theology has been thwarted from reaching its intrinsic goal by its bondage to a transcendent, a sovereign, and an impassive God". [...] [Dietrich] Bonhoffer called persistently for "Religionless Christianity".&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In the 20th century, many scholars have resisted this trend, defending myth from modern criticism.&lt;ref&gt;Segal, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mircea Eliade]], a professor of the history of religions, declared that myth did not hold religion back, that myth was an essential foundation of religion, and that eliminating myth would eliminate a piece of the human psyche.&lt;ref&gt;According to religious thought, said Eliade, myths establish models for human behavior, and "the more religious man is, the more paradigmatic models does he possess as a guide to his attitudes and actions" (Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p. 100). Eliade believed that modern novels, ideologies, customs, and pastimes contain "mythological elements" (Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', pp. 181-93), and that some mythological elements fall within the "transconscious", which Eliade defined as a set of universal human images, symbols, and sentiments (Eliade, ''Images and Symbols'', pp. 16-17).&lt;/ref&gt; Eliade approached myth sympathetically at a time when religious thinkers were trying to purge religion of its mythological elements:&lt;ref name="Muthuraj"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Eliade wrote about "sky and sky gods" when Christian theology was shaken at its very foundations by the "death of God" theology. He spoke of "God up there" when theologians such as J. A. T. Robinson were busy with erasing the mythical language of [a] three-storied universe that underlies the early Christian thought and experience.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Similarly, [[Joseph Campbell]] believed that people could not understand their individual lives without mythology to aid them. By recalling the significance of old myths, he encouraged awareness of them.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Campbell claimed that mythology's primary function is "that of eliciting and supporting a sense of awe before the mystery of being" (Campbell, p. 519), and that mythology also serves "to initiate the individual into the order of realities of his own psyche" (Campbell, p. 521).&lt;/ref&gt; In responding to the interview question "How would you define mythology?", Joseph Campbell answered:&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Thou Are That, p. 111 [in:] James W. Menzies, True Myth, s. 25&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;My favorite definition of mythology: other people's religion. My favorite definition of religion: misunderstanding of mythology.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Religious views==
Most religions contain a body of traditional sacred stories that are believed to express profound truth. Some religious organizations and practitioners believe that some or all of their traditional stories are not only sacred and "true" but also historically accurate and [[revelation|divinely revealed]] and that calling such stories "myths" disrespects their special status. Other religious organizations and practitioners have no problem with categorizing their sacred stories as myths.

===Opposition to categorizing all sacred stories as myths===
====Modern-day opposition====
Some religious believers take offense when what they consider to be historical aspects of their faith are labeled as "myth". Such believers distinguish between religious fables or myths, on one hand, and those sacred narratives which are described by their tradition as being history or revelation, on the other. For instance, [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|Catholic priest]] Father [[John Hardon|John A. Hardon]] insists that "Christianity is not mythology. What we believe in is not religious fantasies, no matter how pious."&lt;ref&gt;Hardon&lt;/ref&gt; Evangelical Christian theologian [[Carl F. H. Henry]] insisted that "Judeo-Christian revelation has nothing in common with the category of myth".&lt;ref&gt;Carl F. H. Henry, quoted by Mohler&lt;/ref&gt;

====The roots of the popular meaning of "myth"====
Especially within Christianity, objection to the word "myth" rests on a historical basis. By the time of Christ, the Greco-Roman world had started to use the term "myth" (Greek ''muthos'') to mean "fable, fiction, lie"; as a result, the early Christian theologians used "myth" in this sense.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', 1968, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the derogatory meaning of the word "myth" is the traditional Christian meaning, and the expression "Christian mythology", as used in academic discourse,&lt;ref name=grassie&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Grassie |first1=William |date=March 1998 |title=Science as Epic? Can the modern evolutionary cosmology be a mythic story for our time? |journal=Science &amp; Spirit |volume=9 |issue=1 |quote=The word 'myth' is popularly understood to mean idle fancy, fiction, or falsehood; but there is another meaning of the word in academic discourse. A myth, in this latter sense of the word, is a story that serves to define the fundamental worldview of a culture .... Using the original Greek term ''mythos'' is perhaps a better way to distinguish this more positive and all-encompassing definition of the word.}}&lt;/ref&gt; may offend Christians for this reason.

In addition, this early Christian use of the term "myth" passed into popular usage.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', 1967, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, when essential [[sacred mysteries]] and teachings are described as ''myth'', in modern English, the word often still implies that it is "idle fancy, fiction, or falsehood".&lt;ref name=grassie/&gt; This description could be taken as a direct attack on [[religious belief]], quite contrary to the meaning ostensibly intended by the academic use of the term. Further, in academic writing, though "myth" usually means a fundamental worldview story, even there it is occasionally ambiguous or clearly denotes "falsehood", as in the "[[Christ myth theory]]". The original term "[[mythos]]" (which has no pejorative connotation in English) may be a better word to distinguish the positive definition from the negative.&lt;ref name=grassie/&gt;

===Non-opposition to categorizing sacred stories as myths===
Modern day clergy and practitioners within some religious movements have no problem classifying the religion's sacred stories as "myths". They see the sacred texts as indeed containing religious truths, divinely inspired but delivered in the language of mankind. Some examples follow.

====Christianity====
[[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s love of myths and devout [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] faith came together in his assertion that [[mythology]] is the divine echo of "the Truth".&lt;ref&gt;Wood&lt;/ref&gt; Tolkien wrote that myths held "fundamental things".&lt;ref&gt;Menion, 2003/2004 citing essays by Tolkien using the words "fundamental things".&lt;/ref&gt; He expressed these beliefs in his poem ''[[Mythopoeia]]'' circa 1931, which describes myth-making as an act of "sub-creation" within God's primary creation.&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien, ''Mythopoeia'', circa 1931.&lt;/ref&gt; The poem in part says creation is "myth-woven and elf-patterned":

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;... There is no [[firmament]],
only a void, unless a jewelled tent
myth-woven and [[elf]]-patterned; and no earth,
unless the mother's womb whence all have birth.&lt;/poem&gt;|JRR Tolkien}}

Tolkien's opinion was adopted by another [[Christianity|Christian]] writer, [[C. S. Lewis]], in their conversations: "Tolkien explained to Lewis that the story of Christ was the true myth at the very heart of history and at the very root of reality."&lt;ref&gt;Pearce&lt;/ref&gt; [[C. S. Lewis]] freely called the Christ story a "true myth", and he believed that even pagan myths express spiritual truths. In his opinion, the difference between the Christ story and pagan myths is that the Christ story is historically as well as spiritually true. Lewis writes,&lt;ref&gt;letter to Arthur Greeves, quoted by Brown&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The story of Christ is simply a true myth: a myth working on us in the same way as the others, but with this tremendous difference that it really happened: and one must be content to accept it in the same way, remembering that it is God's myth where the others are men's myths: i. e. the Pagan stories are God expressing Himself through the minds of poets, using such images as He found there, while Christianity is God expressing Himself through what we call real things.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another Christian writer, the Catholic priest Father [[Andrew Greeley]], freely applies the term "myth" to Christianity. In his book ''Myths of Religion'', he defends this terminology:&lt;ref&gt;Greeley, ''Myths of Religion''; quoted in Bierlein 1994, pp. 304-5.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Many Christians have objected to my use of this word [myth] even when I define it specifically. They are terrified by a word which may even have a slight suggestion of fantasy. However, my usage is the one that is common among historians of religion, literary critics, and social scientists. It is a valuable and helpful usage; there is no other word which conveys what these scholarly traditions mean when they refer to myth. The Christian would be well advised to get over his fear of the word and appreciate how important a tool it can be for understanding the content of his faith.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At a "Consultation on the Relationship Between the Wesleyan Tradition
and the Natural Sciences" in Kansas City, Missouri, on October 19, 1991, Dennis Bratcher presented a discussion of the adaptation of Near Eastern mythical thought by the Israelites.&lt;ref name="Bratcher"&gt;Bratcher&lt;/ref&gt; Bratcher argued that the Old Testament absorbed Near Eastern pagan mythology (although he drew a sharp distinction between the literally-interpreted myths of the Near Eastern pagans and the "mythopoetic" use of imagery from pagan myths by the Hebrews). During this presentation, he gave the following disclaimer:&lt;ref name="Bratcher"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;the term "myth" as used here does not mean "false" or "fiction." Even in my old and yellowed Webster's, "fiction" is the ''third'' meaning of the word. In its primary and more technical meaning "myth" refers to a story or group of stories that serve to explain how a particular society views their world.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Judaism====
Some [[Judaism|Jewish]] scholars, including [[Dov Noy]], a professor of folklore at Hebrew University and founder of the Israel Folktale Archives, and [[Howard Schwartz (writer and editor)|Howard Schwartz]], Jewish anthologist and English professor at the University of Missouri – St. Louis, have discussed traditional Jewish stories as "mythology".&lt;ref&gt;Schram&lt;/ref&gt;

Schwarz authored the book ''Tree of Souls: The Mythology of Judaism''. It consists of myths and belief statements excerpted from—and, in some cases, synthesized from a number of excerpts from—both Biblical and non-Biblical Jewish texts. According to Schwartz, the Jewish people continue to elaborate on, and compose additions to, their traditional mythology.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, p. lxxv&lt;/ref&gt; In the book's introduction, Schwartz states that the word "myth", as used in the book, "is not offered to mean something that is not true, as in the current popular usage".&lt;ref name="Schwartz, p. lxxviii"/&gt;

====Neopaganism====
[[Neopaganism|Neopagans]] frequently refer to their sacred stories as "myths". [[Asatru]], a modern-day revival of Germanic Paganism, holds "that the [[Eddas]], Myths and [[saga|Norse Sagas]] are the divinely inspired wisdom of [its] religion".&lt;ref&gt;"About Us"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wicca]], another Neopagan movement, also applies the term "mythology" to its stories.&lt;ref&gt;"The Wheel of the Year / the Sabbats"; "What is Wicca?"; "Workshops and Talks"&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the years, about ten low-power [[nuclear reactor]]s operated at SSFL, in addition to several "critical facilities" that helped develop nuclear science and applications. At least four of the ten nuclear reactors had accidents during their operation. The reactors located on the grounds of SSFL were considered experimental, and therefore, had no [[Containment building|containment structures]].

The site ceased research and development operations in 2006. The years of rocket testing, nuclear reactor testing, and liquid metal research have left the site "significantly contaminated". Environmental cleanup is ongoing.

On March 30, 2018, a 7-year-old girl living in [[Simi Valley, California|Simi Valley]] died of [[neuroblastoma]], prompting public urging to thoroughly clean up the site.&lt;ref name="2018death"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Simon|first1=Melissa|title=Protestors want SSFL cleaned up {{!}} Simi Valley Acorn|url=https://www.simivalleyacorn.com/articles/protestors-want-ssfl-cleaned-up/|accessdate=18 April 2018|work=www.simivalleyacorn.com|agency=Simi Valley Acorn|date=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
[[Image:Ssfl cdc atsdr figure1.gif|thumb|375px|right|Santa Susana Field Laboratory administrative areas, and the surrounding communities]]
Since 1947 the Santa Susana Field Laboratory location has been used by a number of companies and agencies. The first was [[Pratt &amp; Whitney Rocketdyne|Rocketdyne]], originally a division of [[North American Aviation]]-NAA, which developed a variety of pioneering, successful, and reliable [[liquid rocket engine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boeing.com/aboutus/environment/santa_susana/history.html|title=Boeing: Environment - Santa Susana - History|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110226110912/http://www.boeing.com/aboutus/environment/santa_susana/history.html|archive-date=February 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some were those used in the [[SM-64 Navaho|Navaho]] cruise missile, the [[PGM-11 Redstone|Redstone]] rocket, the [[Thor (rocket family)|Thor]] and [[PGM-19 Jupiter|Jupiter]] ballistic missiles, early versions of the [[Delta II|Delta]] and [[Atlas II|Atlas]] rockets, the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rocket family]], and the [[Space Shuttle Main Engine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics | first =  | authorlink = | title = Historic Aerospace Site: The Rocketdyne Santa Susana Field Laboratory, Canoga Park, California  | publisher = [[AIAA]] | year = 2001 | url = http://www.aiaa.org/Participate/Uploads/02-0003%20HAS%20Rocketdyne%20bro.pdf | accessdate = January 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Atomics International]] division of North American Aviation used a separate and dedicated portion of the Santa Susana Field Laboratory to build and operate the first commercial nuclear power plant in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =  DuTemple | first =  Octave | title =  American Nuclear Society Sodium Reactor Experiment Nuclear Historic Landmark awarded, February 21, 1986 | url =  http://www.etec.energy.gov/History/Major-Operations/SREDocs/ANS_SRE_NHL_Letter_color.pdf | accessdate =  January 25, 2010 | deadurl =  yes | archiveurl =  https://web.archive.org/web/20110721042018/http://www.etec.energy.gov/History/Major-Operations/SREDocs/ANS_SRE_NHL_Letter_color.pdf | archivedate =  July 21, 2011 | df =   }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as for the testing and development of compact nuclear reactors, including the first and only known nuclear reactor launched into Low Earth Orbit by the United States, the [[SNAP-10A]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Stokely | first1 = C. | last2 = Stansbury | first2 = E. | lastauthoramp=yes | publication-date = 2008 | title = Identification of a debris cloud from the nuclear powered SNAPSHOT satellite with Haystack radar measurements | periodical = Advances in Space Research | volume = 41 | issue = 7 | pages = 1004–1009 | doi=10.1016/j.asr.2007.03.046}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atomics International also operated the [[Energy Technology Engineering Center]] for the U.S. Department of Energy at the site. The Santa Susana Field Laboratory includes sites identified as historic by the [[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics]] and by the [[American Nuclear Society]]. In 1996, [[The Boeing Company]] became the primary owner and operator of the Santa Susana Field Laboratory and later closed the site.

Three California state agencies and three federal agencies have been overseeing a detailed investigation of environmental impacts from historical site operations since at least 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Santa Susana Field Laboratory Workgroup | title = Santa Susana Field Laboratory Workgroup Charter | date = September 20, 1990 | location = | url = http://www.rocketdynewatch.org/files/pdf/WG%20Charter.pdf | accessdate = January 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns about the environmental impact of past disposal practices have inspired at least two lawsuits seeking payment from Boeing and several interest groups are actively involved with steering the ongoing environmental investigation.

The Santa Susana Field Laboratory is the focus of diverse interests. [[Burro Flats Painted Cave]], listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], is located within the Santa Susana Field Laboratory boundaries, on a portion of the site owned by the U.S. government. The drawings within the cave have been termed "the best preserved Indian pictograph in Southern California." Several [[tributary]] streams to the [[Los Angeles River]] have [[headwater]] [[drainage basin|watersheds]] on the SSFL property, including [[Bell Creek (Southern California)|Bell Creek]] (90% of SSFL drainage), Dayton Creek, Woolsey Canyon, and Runkle Creek.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enviroreporter.com/images/ESADA/2003-SSFL-surface%20water-map.jpg|title=SSFL Surface Water Map}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Ssfl fieldlab aerial.jpg|thumb|375px|right|Aerial view looking north, of the [[Energy Technology Engineering Center]] in Area IV ''(1990)''.]]SSFL was slated as a [[United States]] [[government]] facility dedicated to the development and testing of [[nuclear reactors]], powerful rockets such as the [[Delta II rocket|Delta II]], and the systems that powered the Apollo missions. The location of SSFL was chosen in 1947 for its remoteness in order to conduct work that was considered too dangerous and too noisy to be performed in more densely populated areas. In subsequent years, however, the [[Southern California]] population grew, along with housing developments surrounding "The Hill". Today, more than 150,000 people live within {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} of the facility, and at least half a million people live within {{convert|10|mi|km|0}}.

The site is divided into four production and two buffer areas, (Area I, II, III, and IV, and the northern and southern buffer zones). Areas I through III were used for rocket testing, missile testing, and munitions development. Area IV was used primarily for nuclear reactor experimentation and development. Laser research for the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] (popularly known as "Star Wars"), also was conducted in Area IV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SITE SAFETY AND HEALTH PLAN AREA IV RADIOLOGICAL STUDY SANTA SUSANA FIELD LABORATORY VENTURA COUNTY, CALIFORNIA|url=http://www.dtsc-ssfl.com/files/lib_doe_area_iv%5Cepaareaivsurvey%5Cmiscplansandreports/65845_4-Site_Safety_and_Health_Plan_Revision_1_060611.pdf|website=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rocket engine development===
[[North American Aviation]] (NAA) began its development of liquid propellant rocket engines after the end of [[World War II|WWII]]. The [[Rocketdyne]] division of NAA, which came into being under its own name in the mid-1950s,{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} designed and tested several rocket engines at the facility. They included engines for the Army's Redstone (an advanced short-range version of the German V-2), and the Army Jupiter intermediate range ballistic missile (IRBM) as well as the Air Force's counterpart IRBM, the Thor.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Also included among those developed there, were engines for the Atlas Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM), as well as the twin combustion chamber alcohol/liquid oxygen booster engine for the [[SM-64 Navaho|Navaho]], a large, intercontinental cruise missile that never became operational. Later, Rocketdyne designed and tested the [[Rocketdyne J-2|J-2]] liquid oxygen/hydrogen engine which was used on the second and third stages of the [[Project Apollo]] spacecraft.  While the J-2 was tested at the facility, Rocketdyne's huge [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] engine for the first stage of Apollo was tested in the Mojave desert near Edwards Air Force Base. This was due to safety and noise considerations, since SSFL was too close to populated areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-350/ch-3-2.html | title = Apollo Expeditions to the Moon, Chapter 3.2 | publisher = NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As overall interest in nuclear power declined, Atomics International made a transition to non-nuclear energy-related projects, such as coal gasification, and gradually, ceased designing and testing nuclear reactors. Atomics International eventually was merged with the Rocketdyne division in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sapere and Boeing | title = Santa Susana Field Laboratory Area IV, Historical Site Assessment | date = May 2005 | pages = 2–1 | url = http://etec.energy.gov/Reading-Room/ | accessdate = January 1, 2010 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100128094958/http://www.etec.energy.gov/Reading-Room/ | archivedate = January 28, 2010 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sodium reactor experiment====
{{Main|Sodium Reactor Experiment}}
The [[Sodium Reactor Experiment]]-SRE was an experimental nuclear reactor that operated at the site from 1957 to 1964 and was the first commercial power plant in the world to experience a core meltdown.&lt;ref name=PS&gt;{{cite web|url=https://psmag.com/environment/50-years-after-nuclear-meltdown-3510|title=50 Years After America's Worst Nuclear Meltdown: Human error helped worsen a nuclear meltdown just outside Los Angeles, and now human inertia has stymied the radioactive cleanup for half a century|date=August 24, 2009|work=[[Pacific Standard]]|last1=Trossman Bien|first1=Joan|last2=Collins|first2=Michael|access-date=November 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a decades-long cover-up of the incident by the U.S. Department of Energy.&lt;ref name="ssflap"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssflpanel.org/files/BeyeaSSFL_0b.pdf |title={Pack, 1964 #4592} has map of complex trajectories in Los Angeles basin |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The operation predated environmental regulation, so early disposal techniques are not recorded in detail.&lt;ref name="ssflap" /&gt;  Thousands of pounds of sodium coolant from the time of the meltdown are not yet accounted for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Rockwell International Corporation, Energy Systems Group | title = Sodium Reactor Experiment Decommissioning Final Report | url = http://etec.energy.gov/History/Major-Operations/SREDocs/ESG-DOE-13403_SREDecomReport_(4143).pdf | id = ESG-DOE-13403 | accessdate = 17 February 2011 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110721035336/http://etec.energy.gov/History/Major-Operations/SREDocs/ESG-DOE-13403_SREDecomReport_(4143).pdf | archivedate = 21 July 2011 | df =  }} (see sections 2.1.7.4, 2.2.3, 4.4.2 and 9.3 for discrepancies concerning sodium amounts)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grover|first1=Joel|last2=Glasser|first2=Matthew|title=L.A.'s Nuclear Secret|url=http://data.nbcstations.com/national/KNBC/la-nuclear-secret/|website=NBC|publisher=National Broadcasting Company|accessdate=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reactor and support systems were removed in 1981 and the building torn down in 1999.

The 1959 sodium reactor incident was chronicled on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]'s program Engineering Disasters 19.

====Energy Technology Engineering Center====
{{Main|Energy Technology Engineering Center}}
The [[Energy Technology Engineering Center]]-ETEC, was a government-owned, contractor-operated complex of industrial facilities located within Area IV of the Santa Susana Field Laboratory. The ETEC specialized in non-nuclear testing of components which were designed to transfer heat from a nuclear reactor using liquid metals instead of water or gas.  The center operated from 1966 to 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sapere and Boeing | first =  | title = Santa Susana Field Laboratory, Area IV, Historical Site Assessment | date = May 2005 | pages = 2–1 | url = http://etec.energy.gov/Reading-Room/ | accessdate = January 20, 2010 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100128094958/http://www.etec.energy.gov/Reading-Room/ | archivedate = January 28, 2010 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ETEC site has been closed and is now undergoing building removal and environmental remediation by the [[U.S. Department of Energy]].

==Accidents and site contamination==

===Nuclear reactors===
Throughout the years, approximately ten low-power [[nuclear reactor]]s operated at SSFL, in addition to several "critical facilities": a [[sodium]] burn pit in which sodium-coated objects were burned in an open pit; a [[plutonium]] [[nuclear fuel|fuel]] fabrication facility; a [[uranium carbide]] fuel fabrication facility; and the purportedly largest "Hot Lab" facility in the United States at the time.&lt;ref name="NBC news special"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grover|first1=Joel|last2=Glasser|first2=Matthew|title=L.A.'s Nuclear Secret|url=http://data.nbcstations.com/national/KNBC/la-nuclear-secret/|website=I-Team: 7-part NBC News special report|publisher=NBC News|accessdate=31 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (A Hot Lab is a facility used for remotely cutting up irradiated [[nuclear fuel]].) Irradiated nuclear fuel from other [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC) and [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] (DOE) facilities from around the country were shipped to SSFL to be decladded and examined.

The Hot Lab suffered a number of fires involving [[Radioactive decay|radioactive]] materials. For example, in 1957, a fire in the [[hot cell|Hot Cell]] "got out of control and&amp;nbsp;... massive contamination" resulted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2754946-NAA-SR-1941.html#document/p27/a282659 NAA-SR-1941, Sodium Graphite Reactor, Quarterly Progress Report, January–March 1957], page 27&lt;/ref&gt;

At least four of the ten nuclear reactors suffered accidents: 1) The AE6 reactor experienced a release of [[fission product|fission gases]] in March 1959.&lt;ref name="adv-panel-report"&gt;{{cite web| title = Report of the Santa Susana Field Laboratory Advisory Panel, October 2006 | url = http://www.ssflpanel.org/files/SSFLPanelReport.pdf | accessdate = September 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2) In July 1959, the SRE experienced a [[Criticality accident|power excursion]] and partial [[nuclear meltdown|meltdown]] that released 28 Curies of radioactive noble gasses. The release resulted on the maximum off site exposure of 0.099 millirem and an exposure of 0.018 millirem for the nearest residential building which is well within current limits today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.etec.energy.gov/Library/Main/Doc._No._37_SRE_Original_Accident_Release_Data_Ltr_from_P_Rutherford_to_E_Crawford.pdf |title=Accident report |website=www.etec.energy.gov |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; 3) In 1964, the SNAP8ER experienced damage to 80% of its fuel. 4) Finally, in 1969 the SNAP8DR experienced similar damage to one-third of its fuel.&lt;ref name="adv-panel-report" /&gt;

A radioactive fire occurred in 1971, involving combustible primary reactor [[coolant]] ([[NaK]]) contaminated with mixed [[Nuclear fission|fission]] products.&lt;ref&gt;Rockwell International, Nuclear Operations at Rockwell's Santa Susana Field Laboratory&amp;nbsp;— A Factual Perspective, September 6, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Oak Ridge Associated Universities TEAM Dose Reconstruction Project for NIOSH, Document No. ORAUT-TKBS-0038-2, Rev. 0. page 24 | url =  https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ocas/pdfs/tbd/etec2.pdf | accessdate = September 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reactors located on the grounds of SSFL were considered experimental, and therefore had no [[Containment building|containment structures]]. Reactors and highly radioactive components were housed without the large concrete domes that surround modern [[nuclear power plant|power reactors]].

===Sodium burn pits===
[[Image:SSFL Burnpit illegal waste.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Toxic substances burn and are released into the air.]]The [[sodium]] burn pit, an open-air pit for cleaning sodium-contaminated components, was also contaminated{{when|date=November 2015}} by the burning of radioactively and chemically contaminated items in it, in contravention of safety requirements. In an article in the ''Ventura County Star'', James Palmer, a former SSFL worker was interviewed. The article notes that "of the 27 men on Palmer's crew, 22 died of cancers." On some nights Palmer returned home from work and kissed "his wife [hello], only to burn her lips with the chemicals he had breathed at work." The report also noted that "During their breaks, Palmer's crew would fish in one of three ponds&amp;nbsp;... The men would use [[High test peroxide|a solution]] that was 90 percent [[hydrogen peroxide]] to neutralize the contamination. Sometimes, the water was so polluted it bubbled. The fish died off." Palmer's interview ended on a somber note: "They had seven wells up there, [[water well]]s, and every damn one of them was contaminated," Palmer said, "It was a horror story."&lt;ref&gt;''The Cancer Effect'', October 30, 2006, The Ventura County Star&lt;/ref&gt;

Other spills and releases occurred over the decades of operation as well. In 1989, a [[United States Department of Energy|DOE]] investigation found widespread chemical and [[radioactive contamination]] on the property. Widely publicized in the local press, the revelations led to substantial concern among community members and elected officials, resulting in a challenge to and subsequent shutdown of continued nuclear activity at the site, and the filing of lawsuits. Cleanup commenced, and the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) was brought in at the request of local legislators to provide oversight.

[[Image:SSFL barrels Shooter.jpg|thumb|200px|right| A worker disposes of toxic chemicals by blowing up full barrels with a rifle shot (the reaction to the shot caused an explosion).]]On December 11, 2002, a top [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] (DOE) official, Mike Lopez, described typical clean-up procedures executed by Field Lab employees in the past. Workers would dispose of barrels filled with highly [[toxic waste]] by shooting the barrels with [[rifles]] so that they would explode and release their contents into the air. It is unclear when this process ended, but for certain did end prior to the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://enviroreporter.com/rocketdyne-its-the-pits/ "Rocketdyne, it's the pits"], Ventura County Reporter, December 12, 2002; also see [http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/07-08/bill/sen/sb_0951-1000/sb_990_bill_20070409_amended_sen_v98.html SB990, a bill] before the California legislature relating this almost unbelievable procedure&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 26, 1994, two scientists, Otto K. Heiney, 52, of Canoga Park and Larry A. Pugh, 51, of Thousand Oaks, were killed when the chemicals they were illegally burning in open pits exploded. After a [[grand jury]] investigation and [[FBI]] raid on the facility, three [[Rocketdyne]] officials [[pleaded guilty]] in June 2004 to illegally storing explosive materials. The jury [[hung jury|deadlocked]] on the more serious charges related to illegal burning of hazardous waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/dec/11/local/me-rocket11|title=Scientist Fined $100 in Lab Blast That Killed 2|first=Jean|last=Guccione|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=December 11, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/jan/28/local/me-rocket28|title=Executive Sentenced in '94 Blast|first=Jean|last=Guccione|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=January 28, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At trial, a retired Rocketdyne mechanic testified as to what he witnessed at the time of the explosion:
"I assumed we were burning waste," Lee Wells testified, comparing the process used on July 21 and 26, 1994, to that once used to legally dispose of leftover chemicals at the company's old burn pit. As Heiney poured the chemicals for what would have been the third burn of the day, the blast occurred, Wells said. "[The background noise] was so loud I didn't hear anything&amp;nbsp;... I felt the blast and I looked down and my shirt was coming apart."

When he realized what had occurred, Wells said, "I felt to see if I was all there&amp;nbsp;... I knew I was burned but I didn't know how bad."  Wells suffered second- and third-degree burns to his face, arms and stomach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ex-Rocketdyne Worker Describes Fatal 1994 Blast|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=January 5, 2002|access-date=14 November 2018|first=Jean |last=Guccione |url= http://articles.latimes.com/2002/jan/05/local/me-20512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wildfires and contamination===
In 2005, [[wildfire]]s swept through northern [[Los Angeles County]] and parts of [[Ventura County]]. The fires consumed most of the dry brush throughout the [[Simi Hills]] where SSFL is located. The facility received substantial fire damage. Since the fire, allegations have emerged that vast quantities of on-site contamination were released into the air. Most recently, Los Angeles County firefighters who were assigned to SSFL during the fire have been sent for medical testing to see if any harmful doses were ingested or inhaled while protecting the facility.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

While community members and firefighters have expressed concern about the amount of exposure, [[Boeing]] officials stand by their position that no contamination of the air resulted from the fire, and that any contamination that may have been consumed by the fire was negligible.

[[California Department of Toxic Substances Control]] also claims that no significant contamination occurred as a result of the fire. Although the Field Lab is under current criticism for violating almost 50 discharge permits, state agencies have been silent on the issue. Recently, lawyers disclosed to the [[California State Water Resources Control Board]] that over 80 exceedances of Boeing's discharge permits were found in the preceding year alone. In January 2006, the State Water Resources Control Board finally stepped in, and refused some requests by Boeing for even lighter standards.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

On Thursday November 8, 2018, the [[Woolsey Fire|Woolsey wildfire]] scorched portions of the Santa Susana Field Laboratory (SSFL), also known as ''Rocketdyne'', causing the [[Southern California Edison]]'s Chatsworth electical substation to trip offline at 2:22 pm.&lt;ref name=Rocketdyne2018-11-12&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rocketdynecleanupcoalition.org/woolsey-fire-burns-rocketdyne/|title=Woolsey Fire Burns Rocketdyne: Massive Woolsey Fire Began On Contaminated Santa Susana Field Laboratory Close to Site of Partial Meltdown.

All wildfire smoke can be hazardous to health, but if SSFL had been cleaned up long ago as DTSC promised, we’d at least not have to worry about exposure to dangerous radionuclides and chemicals as well.”&lt;ref name=Rocketdyne2018-11-12/&gt;&lt;ref name=NBCNews2018-11-14/&gt; He added, "When it burns and becomes airborne in smoke and ash, there is real possibility of heightened exposure for area residents."&lt;ref name=NBCNews2018-11-14/&gt;

===Medical claims===
Also in October 2005,  [[plaintiff]] Margaret-Ann Galasso, in a suit against Boeing, criticized her [[lawyer|attorney]]s, who, as she claimed, accepted a $30 million [[Settlement (litigation)|settlement]] with Boeing without her approval. The attorneys stand to collect $18 million, or 60% of the settlement amount after their costs and fees are subtracted{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}. The plaintiff who disclosed the allegedly tainted deal, is splitting the rest of the settlement with other plaintiffs and will only receive around $30,000, insufficient{{vague|date=November 2015}} for the amount she will need for extensive future [[medical treatment]]s for diseases that were linked to contamination from the SSFL facility.

In October 2006, the Santa Susana Field Laboratory Advisory Panel, made up of independent scientists and researchers from around the United States, concluded that based on available data and computer models, contamination at the facility resulted in an estimated 260 [[cancer]] related deaths. The report also concluded that the SRE [[Nuclear meltdown|meltdown]] caused the release of more than 458 times the amount of radioactivity released by the [[Three Mile Island accident]]. While the nuclear core of the SRE released 10 times less radiation than the TMI incident, the lack of proper containment such as concrete structures caused this radiation to be released into the surrounding environment. The radiation released by the core of the TMI was largely contained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssflpanel.org/files/SSFLPanelReport.pdf |title=Panel Report |website=www.ssflpanel.org |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to studies conducted by [[Hal Morgenstern]] between 1988 and 2002, residents living within 2 miles of the laboratory are 60% more likely to be diagnosed with certain cancers compared to residents living 5 miles from the laboratory.&lt;ref name="2018death"/&gt; This 2-mile region includes small sections of far [[Brandeis-Bardin Institute|southeastern Simi Valley]] and most of [[Bell Canyon, California|Bell Canyon]]. Part of [[Chatsworth, Los Angeles|Chatsworth]] and [[Canoga Park, Los Angeles|Canoga Park]], as well as most of [[West Hills, Los Angeles|West Hills]] and [[Simi Valley, California|Simi Valley]] are within 5 miles of the laboratory.

==Cleanup==
During its years of operation widespread use occurred of highly toxic chemical additives to power over 30,000 rocket engine tests and to clean the rocket test-stands afterwards, as well as considerable nuclear research and at least four nuclear accidents, which has resulted in the SSFL becoming a seriously contaminated site and offsite pollution source requiring a sophisticated multi-agency and corporate Cleanup Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boeing.com/principles/environment/santa-susana/|title=Boeing: Santa Susana}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An ongoing  process to determine the site contamination levels and locations, cleanup standards to meet, methods to use, costs, timelines and completion requirements – are still being  debated, and litigated.&lt;ref name="Times Hiltzik Report"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hiltzik|first1=Michael|title=Santa Susana toxic cleanup effort is a mess|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-20140613-column.html|accessdate=31 January 2017|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=June 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of| 2015}} the site's owner is [[Boeing]], with NASA and DOE liable for several parcels within that. On August 2, 2005, [[Pratt &amp; Whitney]] purchased Boeing's [[Pratt &amp; Whitney Rocketdyne|Rocketdyne]] division, but declined to acquire SSFL as part of the sale.

===Standards history===
In 1989, the DOE found widespread chemical and radioactive contamination at their site, and a cleanup program commenced. In 1995 EPA and DOE announced that they had entered into a joint policy agreement to assure that all DOE sites would be cleaned up to standards consistent with the EPA's [[Superfund|Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act]] (CERCLA) standards.

However, in March 2003, the DOE reversed its position and announced that SSFL would not be cleaned up to EPA standards. While the DOE simultaneously claimed compliance with the 1995 joint policy agreement, the new plan included a cleanup of only 1% of the contaminated soil, and the release of SSFL for unrestricted residential use in as little as ten years. The EPA responded to this announcement by claiming that the DOE was not subject to EPA regulation due to the fact that the DOE existed as a separate entity under the executive branch of the federal government, and refused to take steps to force DOE adherence to the 1995 agreement.

In August 2003, the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations|Senate Appropriations Committee]] issued a report on Energy and Water Appropriations, urging the DOE to meet its commitments in the 1995 agreement and clean up SSFL to the EPA's CERCLA standards. The DOE responded to the Senate, claiming it was in fact consistent with both the agreement and EPA's CERCLA standards. In December 2003, soon after DOE's announcement that it was consistent with the 1995 agreement, EPA determined that the cleanup was not consistent with its CERCLA standards, and that sufficient contamination would remain at levels that would be dangerously inappropriate for unrestricted residential, and that the only safe use under DOE's revised cleanup standards would be restricted day hikes with limitations on picnicking.

Critics point out that if the DOE-Boeing cleanup plan was followed through and the site was released for unrestricted residential use, the property would likely become a Superfund site subject to EPA standards. After the sale, the site would no longer be a DOE facility, and thus, the exemption from CERCLA standards would no longer be in effect. The end result being that the site would only be brought into compliance with CERCLA cleanup standards after Boeing has sold the property, relieving the company of any burden of cleanup costs. The costs would likely be passed on to taxpayers, and not those responsible for the actual contamination.

In early May 2007, a Federal Court in San Francisco issued a major ruling which concluded that DOE has not been cleaning up the site to proper standards, and that the site would have to be cleaned up to higher standards if DOE ever wanted to release the site to Boeing, which in turn, would most likely release the land for unrestricted residential development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Judge assails Rocketdyne cleanup|date=May 3, 2007|first=Gregory W. |last=Griggs|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/may/03/local/me-rocket3|access-date=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judge "Conti's ruling requires DOE to prepare a more stringent review of the lab, which is on the border of Los Angeles County. Conti wrote that the department's decision to prepare a less-stringent environmental document prior to cleanup is in violation of the National Environmental Policy Act and noted that the lab 'is located only miles away from one of the largest population centers in the world.'"

====Runoff issues====
On July 26, 2007, staff at the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board recommended a $471,190 fine against Boeing for 79 violations of the [[California Water Code]] during an 18-month period. From October 2004 to January 2006, wastewater and storm water runoff coming from the lab had increased levels of chromium, dioxin, lead, mercury and other pollutants, the board said. The contaminated water flowed into Bell Creek and the [[Los Angeles River]] in violation of a July 1, 2004, permit that allowed release of wastewater and storm water runoff as long as it didn't contain high levels of pollutants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Boeing faces fines over field lab runoff|date=July 27, 2007|first=Gregory W. |last=Griggs|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jul/27/local/me-rocket27|access-date=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Parkland====
On October 15, 2007, Boeing announced that "In a landmark agreement between Boeing and California officials, nearly {{convert|2400|acre|km2|0}} of land that is currently Boeing's Santa Susana Field Laboratory will become state parkland. According to the plan jointly announced by California Gov. [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], Boeing, and state Sen. [[Sheila Kuehl]], the property will be donated and preserved as a vital undeveloped open-space link in the [[Simi Hills]], above the [[Simi Valley]] and the [[San Fernando Valley]]. The agreement will permanently restrict the land for nonresidential, noncommercial use."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Santa Susana|at=A Bright Future, Today|publisher=Boeing|url=http://www.boeing.com/principles/environment/santa-susana/#/future|access-date=November 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Den of Mountain Lion Kittens Found in Unlikely Place|work=[[National Geographic]]|first=Annie|last=Roth |date=June 21, 2018|access-date=21 June 2018|url=https://relay.nationalgeographic.com/proxy/distribution/public/amp/2018/06/four-mountain-lion-kittens-den-simi-hills-california-animals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New cleanup developments===

====SB 990====
The California state senate bill SB 990, passed into law in 2007, set the standards for the site's cleanup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=200720080SB990|title=Bill Text - SB-990 Hazardous waste: Santa Susana Field Laboratory}}&lt;/ref&gt; To achieve them, the R.P.s (responsible parties) consisting of Boeing, DOE, and NASA, need to sign agreements of acceptance and cleanup compliance.

====Boeing====
Boeing has contested the law, filing a lawsuit in September 2009 to release it from compliance, with a court date set for summer 2011. Boeing won the suit and claims it will clean up the site, although to levels far below those outlined in SB 990.&lt;ref&gt;Healy, Patrick and Lloyd, Jonathan (April 29, 2011) [http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Judge-Sides-With-Boeing-in-Rocket-Site-Cleanup-120867799.html "Judge Sides With Boeing in Rocket Site Cleanup"] [[NBC Southern California]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====DOE and NASA====
In September 2010 DOE and NASA agreed to meet the stringent cleanup standards set for the site in the state's SB 990 legislation, and to cover all costs for their cleanup's implementation. This agreement is significant progress in the SSFL cleanup sequence.&lt;ref name=Nuke/&gt; In 2014, NASA issued a [[Environmental impact statement|final environmental impact statement]] containing mitigation measures that would demolish all structures and [[Environmental remediation|remediate soil]] and [[Groundwater remediation|groundwater contamination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vcstar.com/news/2014/mar/14/nasas-santa-susana-cleanup-could-have-impacts/|title=NASA's Santa Susana cleanup could have significant impacts, report says|last=Harris|first=Mike|date=2014-03-14|work=[[Ventura County Star]]|accessdate=15 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316083458/http://www.vcstar.com/news/2014/mar/14/nasas-santa-susana-cleanup-could-have-impacts/|archivedate=16 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; NASA issued a report highlighting cleanup technology feasibility studies, soil and groundwater fieldwork, and additional archaeology surveys that would be performed in preparation for the demolition of the structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vcstar.com/news/2014/may/01/nasa-plans-to-raze-structures-at-santa-susana/|title=NASA plans to raze structures at Santa Susana Field Laboratory|last=Sullivan|first=Bartholomew|date=2014-05-01|work=[[Ventura County Star]]|accessdate=3 May 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504144450/http://www.vcstar.com/news/2014/may/01/nasa-plans-to-raze-structures-at-santa-susana/|archivedate=4 May 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Demolition of the abandoned buildings, including a cafeteria, laboratory and offices for engineers and draftsmen built in the 1950s and 1960s, was scheduled to start in January or February 2015 after abatement of asbestos, lead paint and other regulated materials. The test stands will follow and are the most complex to tear down but all demolition should be completed in 2016. Because of their historical significance, one test stand and one control building will remain if the cleanup goals can still be met.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vcstar.com/news/local-news/simi-valley/historic-nasa-structures-to-be-razed-in-santa-susana-cleanup_81260370|title=Historic NASA structures to be razed in Santa Susana cleanup|last= Harris |first= Mike |date=2014-12-06|work=[[Ventura County Star]]|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cleanup is projected to be completed in 2017.&lt;ref name=Nuke&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/sep/04/local/la-me-0904-cleanup-20100904|title=Nuclear cleanup at Santa Susana facility would finish by 2017 under settlement|last=Sahagun|first=Louis|date=2010-09-04|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=7 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Community involvement===

====PPG – Public Participation Group====
The [http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/SiteCleanup/Santa_Susana_Field_Lab/ CA-DTSC: SSFL Project], the lead regulatory agency for the site cleanup, is forming a new [Sept. 2010] PPG – Public Participation Group, in response to their community 'Listening Sessions' held earlier in the year and the proposed Listening Session Response Plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtsc-ssfl.com/files/lib_pub_involve/other_docs/64651_LSRP.pdf|title=Listening Session Response Plan|publisher=California Environmental Protection Agency|date=August 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820233940/https://www.dtsc-ssfl.com/files/lib_pub_involve/other_docs/64651_LSRP.pdf|archive-date=August 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applications from all the 'stakeholder'  I.P.s – interested parties: the public, community groups, neighbors, local environmental and cultural groups, and others are being accepted currently [Sept. 2010].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/SiteCleanup/Santa_Susana_Field_Lab/|title=SSFL|website=California Department of Toxic Substances Control}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====SSFL Workgroup====
Every quarter the SSFL Workgroup meetings regarding the cleanup are held that are open for public attendance. The SSFL Workgroup is the current version of the [http://www.ssflpanel.org Santa Susana Advisory Panel]. The workgroup consists of representatives from the [[Department of Toxic Substances Control|California Department of Toxic Substances Control]], the U.S. EPA., public policy organizations, and community representatives. The Boeing Company, current owner of the SSFL site, the DOE are also invited.  Other organizations and private companies also attend as part of the workgroup depending on the topic pending. The meetings are usually held at [http://www.simi-arts.org/ The Simi Valley Cultural Arts Center], and are posted on the DTSC-SSFL Calendar page of their website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/SiteCleanup/Santa_Susana_Field_Lab/ssfl_calendar.cfm|title=SSFL Calendar of Events|website=California Department of Toxic Substances Control}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Community advisory group====
A petition to form a "CAG" or community advisory group was denied in March 2010 by DTSC.&lt;ref&gt;http://cleanuprocketdyne.org/cleanuprocketdyne.org/Community_Advisory_Group/Community_Advisory_Group.html. accessed 8/30/2010{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/SiteCleanup/Projects/upload/CAG-Petition-Final-Response.pdf |title=Petition Final Response|website=California Department of Toxic Substances Control|date=March 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012, the current CAG's petition was approved, and their website is at ssflcag.net.  The SSFL CAG recommends that all responsible parties execute a risk-based cleanup to EPA’s suburban residential standard that will minimize excavation, soil removal and backfill and thus reduce danger to public health and functions of surrounding communities. However, SSFL Panel believes the CAG has a conflict of interest, as it is funded in large part by a grant from the U.S. Department of Energy, and three of its members are former employees of Boeing or its parent company, North American Aviation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enviroreporter.com/2016/09/dept-of-energy-secretly-funding-front-group-to-sabotage-its-own-santa-susana-field-lab-cleanup/|title=Dept. of Energy secretly funding front group to sabotage its own Santa Susana Field Lab cleanup|date=1 September 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CAG tried to keep the source of its funding, over $34,000, anonymous.

====Physicians for Social Responsibility====
The Los Angeles chapter of the [[Physicians for Social Responsibility]] has been working with the SSFL Work Group and Rocketdyne Cleanup Coalition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cleaning Up the Santa Susana Field Laboratory|url=http://www.psr-la.org/issues/peace-and-security/cleaning-up-the-santa-susana-field-laboratory/|publisher=Physicians for Social Responsibility, Los Angeles|accessdate=5 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; PSR expressed concern over conflict of interest involving Boeing, CAG, DTSC and others related to the cleanup that were revealed in a 55-page report, ''[http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/resources/InsideJob.pdf Inside Job – How Boeing Fixers Captured Regulators and Derailed a Nuclear and Chemical Cleanup in LA's Backyard]'', published in 2014 by Consumer Watchdog.&lt;ref name="Inside Job"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tucker|first1=Liza|title=Inside Job: How Boeing Fixers Captured Regulators and Derailed a Nuclear and Chemical Cleanup in LA's Backyard|url=http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/resources/InsideJob.pdf|publisher=Consumer Watchdog|accessdate=5 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Silliness''' is defined as engaging in "a ludicrous [[foolishness|folly]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/silliness |title=silliness - definition of silliness by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; showing a "lack of good sense or judgment",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/thesaurus/silliness |title=Silliness - Synonyms and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "the condition of being frivolous, [[Minimisation (psychology)|trivial]], or [[superficiality|superficial]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/silliness |title=Definition of silliness |publisher=Collins English Dictionary |date= |accessdate=2013-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In television, film, and the circus, portrayals of silliness such as [[exaggerated]], funny behavior are used to amuse audiences. Portrayals of silliness, provided by clowns and jesters, are also used to lift the spirits of people in hospitals.
==Psychology==
In "The Art of Roughhousing," Anthony DeBenedet and Larry Cohen argue that "wild play" between a child and a parent can foster "joy, love and a deeper connection"; among the actions they suggest is for the parent to be silly and pretend to fall over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-08-17/health/sc-health-0817-child-health-roughhous20110817_1_light-touch-physical-fitness-freeze |title=The benefits of horseplay - Chicago Tribune |publisher=Articles.chicagotribune.com |date=2011-08-17 |accessdate=2013-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Christianson from New York’s Big Apple Circus "became so interested in the healing qualities of physical comedy that he quit his job"..."to teach [[jester]]s, clowns and [[comedian]]s how to connect with hospital patients through his Clown Care Unit."&lt;ref name="alexthejester1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alexthejester.com/html/historyPopup.html |title=Brief History of the Jester |publisher=Alexthejester.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; A doctor named [[Patch Adams]] "...leads a merry band of mirth makers on trips around the world to locations of crisis or suffering in order to serve up some levity and healing."&lt;ref name="alexthejester1"/&gt;


In the US and Mexico, the US practical joke group Improv Everywhere has created an 'international celebration of silliness' by asking commuters to board the New York and Mexico City subways without trousers on a specific day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/jan/14/no-pants-subway-day-video |title=No Pants Subway Ride celebrates silliness - video &amp;#124; World news &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date= 2013-01-14|accessdate=2013-07-06 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the circus==

[[File:Clown chili peppers.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|A clown with "happy face" painting]]
In the [[circus]], one of the roles that [[clown]]s play is engaging in silliness. When clowning is taught, the different components of silliness include "funny ways of speaking to make people laugh," making "silly face[s] and sound[s]," engaging in "funny ways of moving, and play[ing] with extreme emotions such as "pretending to laugh and cry." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jimdalling.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=50:clown-activities-structured-silliness&amp;catid=18:teachers-resources&amp;Itemid=59 |title=Jim Dalling |publisher=Jimdalling.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, the [[Northern Arts and Cultural Centre]] held a Children's Festival of Silliness in January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naccnt.ca/events/421/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130706012355/http://www.naccnt.ca/events/421/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-07-06 |title=Northern Arts and Cultural Centre: NACC 1st Annual Children's Festival of Silliness! |publisher=Naccnt.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;


==Quotes==
[[C.S. Lewis]] noted that “Children have one kind of silliness, as you know, and grown-ups have another kind.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/silliness |title=Quotes About Silliness (11 quotes) |publisher=Goodreads.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14225">The '''Smart Onboard Data Interface Module''' (SMODIM) is used by the [[United States Army]] and foreign militaries for live simulated weapons training on military platforms. The SMODIM is the primary component of the Longbow Apache Tactical Engagement Simulation System (LBA TESS) that provides weapons systems training and collective Force-on-Force live training participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peostri.army.mil/PRODUCTS/2013_PEOSTRI_DSRG.pdf |title=PEO STRI Desk-Side Reference Guide, LBA TESS (Page 88) |publisher=PEO STRI |date= 2013–2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TESS is an advanced weapons training system developed for the [[AH-64 Apache]] to support force-on-force and force-on-target live training at U.S. Army Combat Training Centers (CTCs), Aviation Home Stations, and deployed locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peostri.army.mil/PRODUCTS/LBA_TESS/ |title=PEO STRI LBA TESS |publisher=PEO STRI |date= |accessdate=2014-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; TESS integrates with aircraft and ground vehicles to provide collective [[opposing force]] participation in live training.

The Aerial Weapons Scoring System (AWSS) integration with LBA TESS provides the ability to conduct force-on-target engagements using live ammunition for 30 mm gun, rockets, and simulated Hellfire missiles. Gunnery scoring is supported by the SMODIM, which transmits aviation data from the LBA to the Exercise Control (EXCON). AWSS scores the pilot’s live-fire gunnery performance and provides constructive After Action Review (AAR) feedback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peostri.army.mil/PRODUCTS/AWSS-LBA-TESS/home.jsp |title=PEO STRI AWSS LBA TESS |publisher=PEO STRI |date= |accessdate=2014-03-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140320202151/http://www.peostri.army.mil/PRODUCTS/AWSS-LBA-TESS/home.jsp |archivedate=2014-03-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peostri.army.mil/PRODUCTS/2013_PEOSTRI_DSRG.pdf |title=PEO STRI Desk-Side Reference Guide, AWSS LBA TESS (Page 83) |publisher=PEO STRI |date= 2013–2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|citeseerx = 10.1.1.177.858 |title=PEO STRI Products and Services Catalog (Page 81) |publisher=PEO STRI |year= 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Designed and manufactured by Inter-Coastal Electronics, Inc (ICE), "The SMODIM is fully compatible with the [[Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System|multiple integrated laser engagement system (MILES)]] and laser-based direct fire weapons. Additionally, it eliminates the requirement for MILES-type lasers by providing the capability to geometrically pair weapon engagements".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inter-coastal.net/smodim.html |title=SMODIM - Smart Onboard Data Interface Module |date= |accessdate=2014-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[File:Smart Onboard Data Interface Module (SMODIM).png|thumb|right|SMODIM]]

== Background ==

In 1992, Inter-Coastal Electronics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inter-coastal.net |title=Inter-Coastal Electronics (ICE) |date= |accessdate=2014-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; was selected by U.S. Army Communications Electronics Command (CECOM)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cecom.army.mil |title= U.S. Army Communications Electronics Command (CECOM) |date= |accessdate=2014-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; to provide the real-time casualty assessment (RTCA) interface for the AH-64 Apache Attack Helicopter. This component was called the onboard data interface module (ODIM). As the Army incorporated new technologies, the SMODIM added GPS and telemetry and became the core component of live helicopter training systems at all U.S. Army Combat Training Centers (CTCs) with a fielding of over 240 systems. In 1997, the SMODIM was modified to provide a proof of concept for the upgraded AH-64 (D model) Longbow Apache. In 1998 the "Modular" SMODIM and the longbow tactical engagement simulation system (TESS) training system was fielded to all three CTCs and Aviation Home Stations, and became the U.S. Army's first fully integrated live aviation training system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a359363.pdf |title=The Development of a Verification and Validation (V&amp;V) Plan for a Proposed Tactical Engagement Simulation System for the AH-64D Attack Helicopter |publisher=Robert A. Pupalaikis, Defense Technical Information Center |date= November 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following 15&amp;nbsp;years, the SMODIM has deployed in multiple systems and platforms with over one thousand SMODIMs fielded in the U.S. and abroad. An "Advanced" SMODIM or "ASMODIM" is currently in development due to parts obsolescence and will provide an 80% increased processing performance. Security encryption is in accordance with [[FIPS 140-2]] level 2. Advanced weapon simulation is augmented by digital terrain elevation data ([[DTED]]) and geometric ranging. Data communication and data transmission upgrades utilize [[RS-422]] and [[RS-485]] full duplex channels, and [[ARINC 429]] technical standards.

== Overview ==

The SMODIM includes a built-in GPS receiver, [[telemetry]] radio, data recorder, and [[MIL-STD-1553]] mux bus processors. The SMODIM interfaces with the weapons systems and actively tracks, records and transmits data to the ground station or exercise control (EXCON). RTCA feedback is passed directly to the weapons processor and the ground station through the onboard telemetry radio. The SMODIM processes area weapons effects (AWE) data received from the EXCON and computes geometric pairing solutions for weapon engagements using the RF Hellfire, semi-automated laser (SAL) Hellfire, 30 mm chain gun, and rockets. It selects a target from its onboard player/position database in the appropriate weapons impact footprint, then uses the probability-of-hit (Ph) factor to determine the assessment (i.e., ‘hit’/‘miss’). Via the data link, it then informs the target it has been selected for assessment.

The SMODIM maintains a dynamic position database through player-to-player network communications. The onboard telemetry radio supports simultaneous distribution to multiple locations. The radio acts as a message repeater to overcome line of sight (LOS) interruptions. The SMODIM interfaces with [[distributed interactive simulation]] (DIS) networks using SMODIM tracking analysis and recording (SMOTAR),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inter-coastal.net/smotar.html |title=SMODIM Tracking Analysis and Recording (SMOTAR) |publisher=Inter-Coastal Electronics (ICE) |date= |accessdate=2014-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; an advanced software suite that provides visual display and tracking of SMODIM instrumented players. GPS provides real-time position data as players are dynamically simulated, tracked and recorded over tactical maps and aerial photos for after-action review (AAR).

The TESS Aircraft System consists of an “A” kit that becomes part of the aircraft, and a “B” kit that is added to the aircraft for training exercises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apd.army.mil/pdffiles/p350_9.pdfl |title=TESS Apache Longbow TESS B-Kit (Pages 88-89) |publisher=Headquarters Department of the Army |date= 12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The “A” kit includes the SMODIM Tray Assembly, modified software in the weapons display and systems processors, with cable connection provisions. The “B” kit includes the SMODIM, Eye-Safe Laser Range Finder/Designator (ESLRF/D), TESS Gun Control Unit (TGCU), Aircraft Internal Boresight Subassembly (AIBS), TESS Training Missile (TTM) with Flash Weapon Effects Signature Simulator (FlashWESS), GPS and telemetry antennas.

{{Evolutionary biology}}

'''Sociobiology''' is a field of [[biology]] that aims to examine and explain [[social behavior]] in terms of [[evolution]]. It draws from disciplines including [[ethology]], [[anthropology]], [[evolution]], [[zoology]], [[archaeology]], and [[population genetics]]. Within the study of human [[society|societies]], sociobiology is closely allied to [[Darwinian anthropology]], [[human behavioral ecology]] and [[evolutionary psychology]].

Sociobiology investigates social behaviors such as mating patterns, territorial fights, pack hunting, and the hive society of [[social insect]]s. It argues that just as selection pressure led to animals evolving useful ways of interacting with the natural environment, so also it led to the genetic evolution of advantageous social behavior.

While the term "sociobiology" originated at least as early as the 1940s, the concept did not gain major recognition until the publication of [[E. O. Wilson]]'s book ''[[Sociobiology: The New Synthesis]]'' in 1975. The new field quickly became the subject of [[scientific controversy|controversy]].  Critics, led by [[Richard Lewontin]] and [[Stephen Jay Gould]], argued that genes played a role in human behavior, but that traits such as aggressiveness could be explained by social environment rather than by biology. Sociobiologists responded by pointing to the complex relationship between [[nature and nurture]].

==Definition==

E. O. Wilson defined sociobiology as "the extension of population biology and evolutionary theory to social organization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Wilson, E. O. |authorlink=E. O. Wilson |year=1978 |title=On Human Nature |page=x |publisher=Harvard |isbn=978-0674016385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociobiology is based on the premise that some behaviors (social and individual) are at least partly inherited and can be affected by [[natural selection]]. It begins with the idea that behaviors have evolved over time, similar to the way that physical traits are thought to have evolved. It predicts that animals will act in ways that have proven to be evolutionarily successful over time. This can, among other things, result in the formation of complex social processes conducive to evolutionary fitness.

The discipline seeks to explain behavior as a product of natural selection. Behavior is therefore seen as an effort to preserve one's genes in the population. Inherent in sociobiological reasoning is the idea that certain genes or gene combinations that influence particular behavioral traits can be [[Heredity|inherited]] from generation to generation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Rethinking The Theoretical Foundation of Sociobiology | author1=Wilson, David Sloan Wilson |author2=Wilson, Edward O. |author2link=E. O. Wilson | journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology | year=2007 | volume=82 | issue=4 | pages=327–348 | doi=10.1086/522809}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, newly dominant male lions often kill cubs in the pride that they did not sire. This [[adaptive behaviour|behavior is adaptive]] because killing the cubs eliminates [[competition (biology)|competition]] for their own offspring and causes the nursing females to come into heat faster, thus allowing more of his genes to enter into the population. Sociobiologists would view this instinctual cub-killing behavior as being inherited through the genes of successfully reproducing male lions, whereas non-killing behavior may have died out as those lions were less successful in reproducing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Packer |first1=Craig |last2=Pusey |first2=Anne E. |title=Adaptations of Female Lions to Infanticide by Incoming Males |journal=Am. Nat.|date=1983 |volume=121 |issue=5 |pages=716–728 |url=https://www.cbs.umn.edu/sites/cbs.umn.edu/files/public/downloads/Adaptations_of_female_lions_to_infanticide.pdf |doi=10.1086/284097}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Plos wilson.jpg|upright|thumb|[[E. O. Wilson]], a central figure in the history of sociobiology, from the publication in 1975 of his book ''[[Sociobiology: The New Synthesis]]'']]

The philosopher of biology [[Daniel Dennett]] suggested that the political philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]] was the first sociobiologist, arguing that in his 1651 book ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' Hobbes had explained the origins of morals in human society from an amoral sociobiological perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dennett, Daniel |authorlink=Daniel Dennett |title=Darwin's Dangerous Idea |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=1995 |pages=453–454 |isbn=978-0140167344}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The geneticist of animal behavior [[John Paul Scott (geneticist)|John Paul Scott]] coined the word ''sociobiology'' at a 1948 conference on genetics and social behaviour which called for a conjoint development of field and laboratory studies in animal behavior research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Life of J.P. Scott |url=https://www.bgsu.edu/arts-and-sciences/neuroscience/john-paul-scott/the-life-of-jp-scott.html |publisher=Bowling Green State University |accessdate=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Levallois 2018"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Levallois |first1=Clement |title=The Development of Sociobiology in Relation to Animal Behavior Studies, 1946–1975 |journal=Journal of the History of Biology |date=2018 |volume=51 |issue=3 |pages=419–444 |doi=10.1007/s10739-017-9491-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;. With John Paul Scott's organizational efforts, a  "Section of Animal Behavior and Sociobiology" of the ESA was created in 1956, which became a Division of Animal Behavior of the American Society of Zoology in 1958. In 1956, [[E. O. Wilson]] came in contact this emerging sociobiology through his PhD student Stuart A. Altmann, who had been in close relation with the participants to the 1948 conference. Altmann developed his own brand of sociobiology to study the social behavior of rhesus macaques, using statistics, and was hired as a "sociobiologist" at the Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center in 1965.&lt;ref name="Levallois 2018"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Wilson's sociobiology is different from [[John Paul Scott (geneticist)|John Paul Scott]]'s or Altmann's, insofar as he drew on mathematical models of social behavior centered on the maximisation of the genetic fitness by [[W. D. Hamilton]], [[Robert Trivers]], [[John Maynard Smith]], and [[George R. Price]]. The three sociobiologies by Scott, Altmann and Wilson have in common to place naturalist studies at the core of the research on animal social behavior and by drawing alliances with emerging research methodologies, at a time when "biology in the field" was threatened to be made old-fashioned by "modern" practices of science (laboratory studies, mathematical biology, molecular biology).&lt;ref name=Dobzhansky1966&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dobzhansky |first1=Theodosius |title=Are Naturalists Old-Fashioned? |journal=The American Naturalist |date=September 1966 |volume=100 |issue=915 |pages=541–550 |doi=10.1086/282448}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Levallois 2018"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a specialist term, "sociobiology" became widely known in 1975 when Wilson published his book ''Sociobiology: The New Synthesis'', which sparked an intense controversy. Since then "sociobiology" has largely been equated with Wilson's vision. The book pioneered and popularized the attempt to explain the evolutionary mechanics behind social behaviors such as [[altruism]], [[aggression]], and nurturance, primarily in ants (Wilson's own research specialty) and other [[Hymenoptera]], but also in other animals. However, the influence of evolution on behavior has been of interest to biologists and philosophers since soon after the discovery of evolution itself. [[Peter Kropotkin]]'s ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]'', written in the early 1890s, is a popular example. The final chapter of the book is devoted to sociobiological explanations of human behavior, and Wilson later wrote a [[Pulitzer Prize]] winning book, ''[[On Human Nature]]'', that addressed human behavior specifically.&lt;ref name="Levallois 2018"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Walsh, Bryan | url=http://entertainment.time.com/2011/08/30/all-time-100-best-nonfiction-books/slide/on-human-nature-by-edward-o-wilson/ | title=All-TIME 100 Nonfiction Books |date=17 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward H. Hagen writes in ''The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology'' that sociobiology is, despite the public controversy regarding the applications to humans, "one of the scientific triumphs of the twentieth century." "Sociobiology is now part of the core research and curriculum of virtually all biology departments, and it is a foundation of the work of almost all field biologists" Sociobiological research on nonhuman organisms has increased dramatically and continuously in the world's top scientific journals such as ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' and ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''. The more general term [[behavioral ecology]] is commonly substituted for the term sociobiology in order to avoid the public controversy.&lt;ref name="Evolutionary Psychology 2005"&gt;The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, edited by David M. Buss, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2005. Chapter 5 by Edward H. Hagen &lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
Sociobiologists maintain that [[Human nature|human behavior]], as well as nonhuman animal behavior, can be partly explained as the outcome of natural selection. They contend that in order to fully understand behavior, it must be analyzed in terms of evolutionary considerations.

[[Natural selection]] is fundamental to evolutionary theory. Variants of hereditary traits which increase an organism's ability to survive and reproduce will be more greatly represented in subsequent generations, i.e., they will be "selected for". Thus, inherited behavioral mechanisms that allowed an [[organism]] a greater chance of surviving and/or reproducing in the past are more likely to survive in present organisms. That inherited adaptive behaviors are present in nonhuman [[Species|animal species]] has been multiply demonstrated by biologists, and it has become a foundation of [[evolutionary biology]]. However, there is continued resistance by some researchers over the application of evolutionary models to humans, particularly from within the social sciences, where culture has long been assumed to be the predominant driver of behavior.

[[File:Nikolaas Tinbergen 1978.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Nikolaas Tinbergen]], whose work influenced sociobiology]]

Sociobiology is based upon two fundamental premises:
* Certain behavioral traits are inherited,
* Inherited behavioral traits have been honed by natural selection. Therefore, these traits were probably "adaptive" in the environment in which the species evolved.

Sociobiology uses [[Nikolaas Tinbergen]]'s [[Tinbergen's four questions|four categories of questions]] and explanations of animal behavior. Two categories are at the species level; two, at the individual level. The species-level categories (often called "ultimate explanations") are
* the function (i.e., [[adaptation]]) that a behavior serves and
* the evolutionary process (i.e., [[phylogeny]]) that resulted in this functionality.
The individual-level categories (often called "proximate explanations") are
* the development of the individual (i.e., [[ontogeny]]) and
* the proximate mechanism (e.g., [[brain anatomy]] and [[hormone]]s).

Sociobiologists are interested in how behavior can be explained logically as a result of selective pressures in the history of a species. Thus, they are often interested in [[instinct]]ive, or [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]] behavior, and in explaining the similarities, rather than the differences, between cultures. For example, mothers within many species of [[mammals]] – including humans – are very protective of their [[offspring]]. Sociobiologists reason that this protective behavior likely evolved over time because it helped the offspring of the individuals which had the characteristic to survive. This parental protection would increase in frequency in the population. The social behavior is believed to have evolved in a fashion similar to other types of nonbehavioral [[adaptation]]s, such as a coat of fur, or the sense of smell.

Individual genetic advantage fails to explain certain social behaviors as a result of gene-centred selection. E.O. Wilson argued that evolution may also act upon [[social group|groups]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1975. Chapter 5. "Group Selection and Altruism"&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanisms responsible for [[group selection]] employ [[paradigms]] and population statistics borrowed from [[evolutionary game theory]]. Altruism is defined as "a concern for the welfare of others". If altruism is genetically determined, then altruistic individuals must reproduce their own altruistic genetic traits for altruism to survive, but when altruists lavish their resources on non-altruists at the expense of their own kind, the altruists tend to die out and the others tend to increase. An extreme example is a soldier losing his life trying to help a fellow soldier. This example raises the question of how altruistic genes can be passed on if this soldier dies without having any children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tessman |first=Irwin |title=Human altruism as a courtship display |journal=Forum |year=1995 |pages=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within sociobiology, a social behavior is first explained as a sociobiological [[hypothesis]] by finding an [[evolutionarily stable strategy]] that matches the observed behavior. Stability of a strategy can be difficult to prove, but usually, it will predict gene frequencies. The hypothesis can be supported by establishing a correlation between the gene frequencies predicted by the strategy, and those expressed in a population.

Altruism between [[social insect]]s and littermates has been explained in such a way. Altruistic behavior, behavior that increases the reproductive fitness of others at the apparent expense of the altruist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Costa-Leonarda |first=Ana Maria |title=Termite Communication during different behavioral activities |journal=In: Witzany G (ed). Biocommunication of Animals |year=2014 |pages=161–190}}&lt;/ref&gt; in some animals has been correlated to the degree of [[genome]] shared between altruistic individuals. A quantitative description of [[infanticide]] by male harem-mating animals when the [[alpha male]] is displaced as well as [[rodent]] female infanticide and fetal resorption are active areas of study. In general, females with more bearing opportunities may value offspring less, and may also arrange bearing opportunities to maximize the [[food]] and protection from mates.

An important concept in sociobiology is that temperament traits exist in an [[ecological]] balance. Just as an expansion of a [[sheep]] population might encourage the expansion of a [[wolf]] population, an expansion of altruistic traits within a gene pool may also encourage increasing numbers of individuals with dependent traits.

Studies of human behavior genetics have generally found behavioral traits such as creativity, extroversion, aggressiveness, and [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] have high [[heritability]]. The researchers who carry out those studies are careful to point out that heritability does not constrain the influence that environmental or cultural factors may have on those traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Johnson |first1=Wendy |last2=Turkheimer |first2=E. |last3=Gottesman |first3=Irving |last4=Bouchard |first4=Thomas |year=2009 |title=Beyond Heritability: Twin Studies in Behavioral Research |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=217–220 |url=http://people.virginia.edu/~ent3c/papers2/Articles%20for%20Online%20CV/Johnson%20%282009%29.pdf |accessdate=29 June 2010 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2009.01639.x |pmc=2899491 |pmid=20625474 |quote=Moreover, even highly heritable traits can be strongly manipulated by the environment, so heritability has little if anything to do with controllability. For example, height is on the order of 90% heritable, yet North and South Koreans, who come from the same genetic background, presently differ in average height by a full 6 inches (Pak, 2004; Schwekendiek, 2008). |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Turkheimer |first=Eric |date=April 2008 |title=A Better Way to Use Twins for Developmental Research |journal=LIFE Newsletter |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=2–5 |url=http://people.virginia.edu/~ent3c/papers2/Articles%20for%20Online%20CV/Turkheimer%20%282008%29.pdf |accessdate=29 October 2010 |quote=But back to the question: What does heritability mean? Almost everyone who has ever thought about heritability has reached a commonsense intuition about it: One way or another, heritability has to be some kind of index of how genetic a trait is. That intuition explains why so many thousands of heritability coefficients have been calculated over the years. . . . Unfortunately, that fundamental intuition is wrong. Heritability isn't an index of how genetic a trait is. A great deal of time has been wasted in the effort of measuring the heritability of traits in the false expectation that somehow the genetic nature of psychological phenomena would be revealed. |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Crime|Criminality]] is actively under study, but extremely controversial. There are arguments that in some environments criminal behavior might be adaptive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbsonline.org/Preprints/OldArchive/bbs.mealey.html The Sociobiology Of Sociopathy: An Integrated&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021026131543/http://www.bbsonline.org/Preprints/OldArchive/bbs.mealey.html |date=2002-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The novelist [[Elias Canetti]] also has noted applications of sociobiological theory to cultural practices such as slavery and autocracy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elias Canetti]], ''[[Crowds and Power]]''. Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1981, p. 444-445.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support for premise==
Genetic mouse mutants illustrate the power that genes exert on behaviour. For example, the [[transcription factor]] FEV (aka Pet1), through its role in maintaining the [[serotonergic system]] in the brain, is required for normal [[aggression|aggressive]] and [[anxiety]]-like behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Hendricks TJ, Fyodorov DV, Wegman LJ, Lelutiu NB, Pehek EA, Yamamoto B, Silver J, Weeber EJ, Sweatt JD, Deneris ES. Pet-1 ETS gene plays a critical role in 5-HT neuron development and is required for normal anxiety-like and aggressive behaviour]. Neuron. 2003 Jan 23;37(2):233-47&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, when FEV is genetically deleted from the mouse genome, male mice will instantly attack other males, whereas their wild-type counterparts take significantly longer to initiate violent behaviour. In addition, FEV has been shown to be required for correct maternal behaviour in mice, such that offspring of mothers without the FEV factor do not survive unless cross-fostered to other wild-type female mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lerch-Haner | first1 = JK | last2 = Frierson | first2 = D | last3 = Crawford | first3 = LK | last4 = Beck | first4 = SG | last5 = Deneris | first5 = ES | date = Sep 2008 | title = Serotonergic transcriptional programming determines maternal behavior and offspring survival | url = | journal = Nat Neurosci | volume = 11 | issue = 9| pages = 1001–3 | doi=10.1038/nn.2176| pmid = 19160496 | pmc = 2679641 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A genetic basis for instinctive behavioural traits among non-human species, such as in the above example, is commonly accepted among many biologists; however, attempting to use a genetic basis to explain complex behaviours in human societies has remained extremely controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fisher |first1=Helen |title='Wilson,' They Said, 'Your All Wet!' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/12/06/specials/wilson-naturalist.html |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=21 July 2015 |date=16 October 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gould |first1=Stephen Jay |title=Sociobiology: the art of storytelling |journal=New Scientist |date=16 November 1978 |volume=80 |issue=1129 |pages=530–533|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tRj7EyRFVqYC&amp;pg=PA530}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

[[Steven Pinker]] argues that critics have been overly swayed by politics and a fear of [[biological determinism]],{{efn|Biological determinism was a right wing philosophy underlying the [[social Darwinism|social Darwinian]] and [[Eugenics#History|eugenics movements]] of the early 20th century, and [[History of the race and intelligence controversy|controversies in the history of intelligence testing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Allen |first1=Garland E. |title=The Roots of Biological Determinism: review of The Mismeasure of Man by Stephen Jay Gould |journal=Journal of the History of Biology |date=1984 |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=141–145 |jstor=4330882 |doi=10.1007/bf00397505}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} accusing among others [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Richard Lewontin]] of being "radical scientists", whose stance on human nature is influenced by politics rather than science,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Pinker, Steven | authorlink=Steven Pinker |title=The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature |publisher=Penguin Books |location=New York |year=2002 |page=149 |isbn=978-0-14-200334-3 |quote=A surprising number of intellectuals, particularly on the left, do deny that there is such a thing as inborn talent, especially intelligence.

Gould grouped sociobiology with [[eugenics]], criticizing both in his book ''[[The Mismeasure of Man]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gould, Stephen Jay |authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould |year=1996 |title=The Mismeasure of Man |page=Introduction to the Revised Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Noam Chomsky]] has expressed views on sociobiology on several occasions. During a 1976 meeting of the [[Sociobiology Study Group]], as reported by [[Ullica Segerstråle]], Chomsky argued for the importance of a sociobiologically informed notion of human nature.{{sfn|Segerstråle|2000|p=205}} Chomsky argued that human beings are biological organisms and ought to be studied as such, with his criticism of the "[[blank slate]]" doctrine in the social sciences (which would inspire a great deal of Steven Pinker's and others' work in evolutionary psychology), in his 1975 ''Reflections on Language''.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam (1975), ''Reflections on Language'':10. New York: Pantheon Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky further hinted at the possible reconciliation of his anarchist political views and sociobiology in a discussion of [[Peter Kropotkin]]'s ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]'', which focused more on altruism than aggression, suggesting that anarchist societies were feasible because of an innate human tendency to cooperate.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky (1995). [http://www.chomsky.info/articles/199505--.htm#TXT2.23 "Rollback, Part II."] ''Z Magazine'' 8 (Feb.): 20–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson has claimed that he had never meant to imply what ''ought'' to be, only what ''is'' the case. However, some critics have argued that the language of sociobiology readily slips from "is" to "ought",&lt;ref name=lrk84/&gt; an instance of the [[naturalistic fallacy]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32834">'''Steam-assisted gravity drainage''' (SAGD; "Sag-D") is an [[enhanced oil recovery]] technology for producing [[heavy crude oil]] and [[Asphalt|bitumen]]. It is an advanced form of [[steam injection (oil industry)|steam stimulation]] in which a pair of [[Directional drilling|horizontal well]]s is drilled into the [[Petroleum reservoir|oil reservoir]], one a few metres above the other. High pressure steam is continuously injected into the upper [[wellbore]] to heat the oil and reduce its [[viscosity]], causing the heated oil to drain into the lower wellbore, where it is pumped out. Dr. Roger Butler, engineer at Imperial Oil from 1955 to 1982, invented the steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) process in the 1970s. Butler "developed the concept of using horizontal pairs of wells and injected steam to develop certain deposits of bitumen considered too deep for mining".&lt;ref name="butlerhalloffame" /&gt;&lt;ref name="guidebook" /&gt; In 1983 Butler became director of technical programs for the [[Alberta Oil Sands Technology and Research Authority]] (AOSTRA),&lt;ref name="butlerhalloffame" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;AOSTRA is now known as the Alberta Energy Research Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Crown corporations of Canada|crown corporation]] created by Alberta [[Peter Lougheed|Premier Lougheed]] to promote new technologies for [[oil sands]] and [[heavy crude oil]] production. AOSTRA quickly supported SAGD as a promising innovation in oil sands extraction technology.&lt;ref name="guidebook" /&gt;

Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) and Cyclic Steam Stimulation (CSS) [[Steam_injection_(oil_industry)]] are two commercially applied primal thermal recovery processes used in the oil sands &lt;ref name="OSUM2009Jiang"&gt;{{cite conference|title=Review of Thermal Recovery Technologies for the Clearwater and Lower Grand Rapids Formations in the Cold Lake Area in Alberta|author1=Qi Jiang|author2=Bruce Thornton|author3=Jen Russel-Houston|author4=Steve Spence|publisher=Osum Oil Sands Corp|conference=Canadian International Petroleum Conference|url=http://www.osumcorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/CIPC_Review-of-Thermal-Recovery-Technologies-for-the-Clearwater-and-Lower-Grand-Rapids-Formations-in-the-Cold-Lake-Area-of-Alberta.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Formation (stratigraphy)|Geological formation]] sub-units, such as Grand Rapids Formation, Clearwater Formation, McMurray Formation, General Petroleum Sand, Lloydminster Sand, of the [[Mannville Group]], a [[Geochronology|Stratigraphic range]] in the [[Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin]].

Canada is now the single largest supplier of imported oil to the United States, supplying over 35% of US imports, much more than Saudi Arabia or Venezuela, and more than all the [[OPEC]] countries combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_move_impcus_a2_nus_ep00_im0_mbblpd_m.htm |title=U.S. Imports by Country of Origin |work=EIA |accessdate=3 February 2015 |year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the new production comes from Alberta's vast oil sands deposits. There are two primary methods of oil sands recovery. The strip-mining technique is more familiar to the general public, but can only be used for shallow bitumen deposits. However, the more recent steam-assisted gravity drainage technique (SAGD) is better suited to the much larger deep deposits that surround the shallow ones. Much of the expected future growth of production in the Canadian oil sands is predicted to be from SAGD.&lt;ref name="GlassmanMar2011"&gt;{{cite report|publisher=The Water-Energy Nexus|title=Adding Water to the Energy Agenda|series=A World Policy Paper|author1=Diana Glassman|author2=Michele Wucker|author3=Tanushree Isaacman|author4=Corinne Champilou|author5=Annie Zhou|date=March 2011|url=http://www.nationalfoodhub.com/images/THE_WATER-ENERGY_NEXUS_REPORT.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9}}

Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage emissions are equivalent to what is emitted by the steam flood projects which have long been used to produce heavy oil in California's [[Kern River Oil Field]] and elsewhere around the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/tar-sands-extraction-without-strip-mining/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The SAGD process of heavy oil or bitumen production is an enhancement on the [[Steam injection (oil industry)| steam injection]] techniques originally developed to produce heavy oil from the [[Kern River Oil Field]] of California.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.spe.org/dl/docs/2011/Law.pdf | last = Law | first = David | title = A New Heavy Oil Recovery Technology to Maximize Performance and to Maximize Performance and Minimize Environmental Impact | work = SPE Distinguished Lecturer Program | publisher  = [[Society of Petroleum Engineers]] | accessdate = 2016-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The key to all steam flooding processes is to deliver heat to the producing formation to reduce the viscosity of the heavy oil and enable it to move toward the producing well. The cyclic steam stimulation (CSS) process developed for the California heavy oil fields was able to produce oil from some portions of the Alberta oil sands, such as the [[Cold Lake oil sands]], but did not work as well to produce bitumen from heavier and deeper [[McMurray Formation | deposits]] in the [[Athabasca oil sands]] and [[Peace River oil sands]], where the majority of Alberta's oil sands reserves lie. To produce these much larger reserves, the SAGD process was developed, primarily by Dr. Roger Butler&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.canadianpetroleumhalloffame.ca/roger-butler.html | title = Dr. Roger M. Butler | work = Canadian Petroleum Hall of Fame | publisher  = [[Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers]] | accessdate = 2016-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Imperial Oil]] with the assistance of the [[Alberta Oil Sands Technology and Research Authority]] and industry partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Practical_Reservoir_Simulation.html?id=qUx5t8oPlZAC | title = Practical Reservoir Simulation: Using, Assessing, and Developing Results | last = Carlson | first = M.R. | publisher  = [[PennWell Books]] | date = 1 January 2003 | accessdate = 2016-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The SAGD process is estimated by the [[National Energy Board]] to be economic when oil prices are at least US$30 to $35 per barrel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.neb-one.gc.ca/nrg/sttstc/crdlndptrlmprdct/rprt/archive/pprtntsndchllngs20152006/pprtntsndchllngs20152006-eng.pdf | title = Canada's Oil Sands: Opportunities and Challenges to 2015 | publisher  = [[National Energy Board]] | accessdate = 2016-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the SAGD process, two parallel horizontal [[oil well]]s are drilled in the [[Petroleum geology|formation]], one about 4 to 6 metres above the other. The upper well injects steam, and the lower one collects the heated [[Petroleum|crude oil]] or bitumen that flows down due to gravity, plus recovered water from the condensation of the injected steam. The basis of the SAGD process is that thermal communication is established with the reservoir so that the injected steam forms a "steam chamber". The heat from the steam reduces the [[viscosity]] of the heavy crude oil or bitumen which allows it to flow down into the lower wellbore. The steam and associated gas rise because of their low density compared to the heavy crude oil below, ensuring that steam is not produced at the lower production well, tend to rise in the steam chamber, filling the void space left by the oil. Associated gas forms, to a certain extent, an insulating heat blanket above (and around) the steam.&lt;ref name="Holdaway_2014"&gt;{{citation |title=Harness Oil and Gas Big Data with Analytics: Optimize Exploration and Production with Data Driven Models |first=Keith |last=Holdaway |work=Wiley |date=13 May 2014  |accessdate=3 February 2014 |isbn=1118910958 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zXaVAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA155&amp;lpg=PA155&amp;dq=Oil+and+water+flow+is+by+a+countercurrent,+gravity+driven+drainage+into+the+lower+well+bore.+The+condensed+water+and&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TE27OxNN7W&amp;sig=AzqWxxf0GAhoRBTj8B99CYBwKhA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JDDSVIycCM7HsQTJv4KADg&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oil and water flow is by a countercurrent, gravity driven drainage into the lower well bore. The condensed water and [[Petroleum|crude oil]] or bitumen is recovered to the surface by pumps such as progressive cavity pumps that work well for moving high-viscosity fluids with suspended solids.&lt;ref name="Alberta_Energy_2013"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.energy.alberta.ca/OilSands/pdfs/FS_SAGD.pdf |format=PDF |title=Talk about SAGD |work=Energy Alberta |date=November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sub-cool is the difference between the saturation temperature (boiling point) of water at the producer pressure and the actual temperature at the same place where the pressure is measured. The higher the liquid level above the producer the lower the temperature and higher is the sub-cool. However real life reservoirs are invariably heterogeneous therefore it becomes extremely difficult to achieve a uniform sub-cool along the entire horizontal length of a well. As a consequence many operators, when faced with uneven stunted steam chamber development, allow a small quantity of steam to enter into the producer to keep the bitumen in the entire wellbore hot hence keeping its viscosity low with the added benefit of transferring heat to colder parts of the reservoir along the wellbore. Another variation sometimes called Partial SAGD is used when operators deliberately circulate steam in the producer following a long shut-in period or as a startup procedure. Though a high value of sub-cool is desirable from a thermal efficiency standpoint as it generally includes reduction of steam injection rates but it also results in slightly reduced production due to a corresponding higher viscosity and lower mobility of bitumen caused by lower temperature. Another drawback of very high sub-cool is the possibility of steam pressure eventually not being enough to sustain steam chamber development above the injector, sometimes resulting in collapsed steam chambers where condensed steam floods the injector and precludes further development of the chamber.

Continuous operation of the injection and production wells at approximately reservoir pressure eliminates the instability problems that plague all high-pressure and cyclic steam processes and SAGD produces a smooth, even production that can be as high as 70% to 80% of oil in place in suitable reservoirs. The process is relatively insensitive to shale streaks and other vertical barriers to steam and fluid flow because, as the rock is heated, differential thermal expansion allows steam and fluids to gravity flow through to the production well. This allows recovery rates of 60% to 70% of oil in place, even in formations with many thin shale barriers. Thermally, SAGD is generally twice as efficient as the older cyclic steam stimulation (CSS) process, and it results in far fewer wells being damaged by the high pressures associated with CSS. Combined with the higher oil recovery rates achieved, this means that SAGD is much more economic than cyclic steam processes where the reservoir is reasonably thick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Speight | first = James G.  | title = The Chemistry and Technology of Petroleum

== History ==

The gravity drainage idea was originally conceived by Dr. Roger Butler, an engineer for [[Imperial Oil]] in the 1970s&lt;ref name="butlerhalloffame"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadianpetroleumhalloffame.ca/roger-butler.html|title=Dr. Roger M. Butler|year=2012|publisher=Canadian Petroleum Hall of Fame}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guidebook" /&gt; In 1975 Imperial Oil transferred Butler from Sarnia, Ontario to [[Calgary|Calgary, Alberta]] to head their heavy oil research effort. He tested the concept with Imperial Oil in 1980, in a pilot at [[Cold Lake oil sands|Cold Lake]] which featured one of the first horizontal wells in the industry, with vertical injectors.

=== Alberta Oil Sands Technology and Research Authority (AOSTRA) 1974 ===

In 1974, former Premier of Alberta Peter Lougheed created the [[Alberta Oil Sands Technology and Research Authority]] (AOSTRA) as an Alberta [[Crown corporations of Canada|crown corporation]] to promote the development and use of new technology for oil sands and heavy crude oil production, and enhanced recovery of conventional crude oil. Its first facility was owned and operated by ten industrial participants and received ample government support (Deutsch and McLennan 2005)&lt;ref name="guidebook" /&gt; including from the [[Alberta Investment Management Corporation|Alberta Heritage Savings Trust Fund]].&lt;ref name="canada"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/alberta-oil-sands-technology-and-research-authority/ | title= Alberta Oil Sands Technology and Research Authority.

==== AOSTRA Underground Test Facility 1984 ====

In 1984, AOSTRA initiated the Underground Test Facility in the [[Athabasca oil sands]], located between the MacKay Rivers and the Devon River west of the Syncrude plant as an [[in-situ]] [[Steam assisted gravity drainage|SAGD]] bitumen recovery facility.&lt;ref name="guidebook" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AOSTRA1974"&gt;{{cite news|title=Harbir Chhina keeps Cenovus Energy Inc. running smoothly|publisher=Alberta Oil|first=Marzena|last=Czarnecka|date=1 January 2013|url=http://www.albertaoilmagazine.com/2013/01/the-executive-vice-president-oil-sands-keeps-cenovus-energy-inc-running-smoothly/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was here that their first test of twin (horizontal) SAGD wells took place, proving the feasibility of the concept, briefly achieving positive cash flow in 1992 at a production rate of about 2000 bbl/day from 3 well pairs.

=== Foster Creek ===

The Foster Creek plant in Alberta Canada, built in 1996 and operated by [[Cenovus Energy]], was the first commercial Steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) project and by 2010 Foster Creek "became the largest commercial SAGD project in Alberta to reach royalty payout status. "&lt;ref name="AOSTRA1974" /&gt;&lt;ref name="YedlinChhina2013"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/business/energy-resources/Yedlin+Showing+cynics+business+done/8545972/story.html?__lsa=50b1-7af0|publisher=Calgary Herald|title=Yedlin: Showing cynics how oil business is done|date=19 June 2013|accessdate=19 June 2013|first=Deborah|last=Yedlin}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original UTF SAGD wells were drilled horizontally from a tunnel in the limestone underburden, accessed with vertical [[Shaft mining|mine shafts]].  The concept coincided with development of directional drilling techniques that allowed companies to drill horizontal wells accurately, cheaply and efficiently, to the point that it became hard to justify drilling a conventional vertical well any more. With the low cost of drilling horizontal well pairs, and the very high [[peak oil|recovery rates]] of the SAGD process (up to 60% of the oil in place), SAGD is economically attractive to oil companies.

At Foster Creek Cenovus has employed its patented&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ic.gc.ca/opic-cipo/cpd/eng/patent/2591498/summary.html?query=cenovus&amp;start=1&amp;num=50&amp;type=basic_search&lt;/ref&gt; 'wedge well' technology to recover residual resources bypassed by regular SAGD operations, this improves the total recovery rate of the operation. The 'wedge well' technology works by accessing the residual bitumen that is bypassed in regular SAGD operations by drilling an infill well between two established operating SAGD well pairs once the SAGD steam chambers have matured to the point where they have merged and are in fluid communication and then what is left to recover in that reservoir area between the operating SAGD well pairs is a 'wedge' of residual, bypassed oil. Wedge well technology has been shown to improve overall recovery rates by 5%-10% at a reduced capital cost as less steam is required once the steam chambers mature to the point where they are in fluid communication and typically at this stage in the recovery process, also commonly known as the 'blow down' phase&lt;ref&gt;https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/SPE-165481-MS&lt;/ref&gt;, the injected steam is replaced with a non-condensable gas such as methane, further reducing production costs.&lt;ref&gt;http://aer.ca/documents/oilsands/insitu-presentations/2011AthabascaCenovusFosterCreekSAGD8623.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current applications ==

This technology is now being exploited due to [[2000s energy crisis|increased oil prices]]. While traditional drilling methods were prevalent up until the 1990s, high crude prices of the 21st Century are encouraging more unconventional methods (such as SAGD) to extract crude oil. The Canadian oil sands have many SAGD projects in progress, since this region is home of one of the largest deposits of bitumen in the world ([[Canada]] and [[Venezuela]] have the world's largest deposits).

The SAGD process allowed the [[Ministry of Energy (Alberta)|Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB)]] to increase its proven [[oil reserves]] to 179 billion barrels, which raised Canada's oil reserves to the third highest in the world after [[Venezuela]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] and approximately quadrupled North American oil reserves. As of 2011, the oil sands reserves stand at around 169 billion barrels.

== Disadvantages ==

=== Oil and water nexus ===

SAGD, a thermal recovery process, consumes large quantities of water and natural gas.&lt;ref name="GlassmanMar2011" /&gt;{{rp|4}}
{{quote|"Petroleum from the Canadian oil sands extracted via surface mining techniques can consume 20 times more water than conventional oil drilling.

"Petroleum from the Canadian oil sands extracted via surface mining techniques can consume 20 times more water than conventional oil drilling." However, by 2011 there was inadequate data on the amount of water used in the increasingly important steam-assisted gravity drainage technique (SAGD) method.&lt;ref name="GlassmanMar2011" /&gt;{{rp|4}} Evaporators can treat the SAGD produced water to produce high quality freshwater for reuse in SAGD operations.&lt;ref name="Alberta Innovates"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lightbown|first1=Vicki|title=NEW SAGD TECHNOLOGIES SHOW PROMISE IN REDUCING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF OIL SAND PRODUCTION|url=http://albertainnovates.ca/media/20420/sagd_technologies_ogm_lightbown.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140925201815/http://albertainnovates.ca/media/20420/sagd_technologies_ogm_lightbown.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2014-09-25|website=Alberta Innovates|publisher=Alberta Innovates|accessdate=June 2015|ref=Alberta Innovates}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, evaporators produce a high volume blowdown waste which requires further management.&lt;ref name="Alberta Innovates"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lightbown|first1=Vicki|title=NEW SAGD TECHNOLOGIES SHOW PROMISE IN REDUCING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF OIL SAND PRODUCTION|url=http://albertainnovates.ca/media/20420/sagd_technologies_ogm_lightbown.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140925201815/http://albertainnovates.ca/media/20420/sagd_technologies_ogm_lightbown.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2014-09-25|website=Alberta Innovates|publisher=Alberta Innovates|accessdate=June 2015|ref=Alberta Innovates}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Use of natural gas for steam generation ===

As in all thermal recovery processes, cost of steam generation is a major part of the cost of oil production. Historically, [[natural gas]] has been used as a fuel for Canadian oil sands projects, due to the presence of large [[stranded gas reserve]]s in the oil sands area. However, with the building of natural gas pipelines to outside markets in Canada and the United States, the price of gas has become an important consideration. The fact that natural gas production in Canada has peaked and is now declining is also a problem. Other sources of generating heat are under consideration, notably gasification of the heavy fractions of the produced bitumen to produce [[syngas]], using the nearby (and massive) deposits of [[coal]], or even building [[nuclear reactor technology|nuclear reactors]] to produce the heat.

=== Use of water for steam generation ===

A source of large amounts of fresh and brackish water and large water re-cycling facilities are required in order to create the steam for the SAGD process. Water is a popular topic for debate in regards to water use and management. As of 2008, American petroleum production (not limited to SAGD) generates over 5 billion gallons of produced water every day.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph M. Hall, Statement to the Committee on Science and Technology for the Produced Water Utilization Act of 2008, 110th Congress 2d Session, Report 110-801.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Water Use Breakdown in Alberta 2005|url=http://www3.gov.ab.ca/env/water/GWSW/quantity/waterinalberta/allocation/AL3_purpose.html|publisher=Government of Alberta|accessdate=2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419171620/http://www3.gov.ab.ca/env/water/GWSW/quantity/waterinalberta/allocation/AL3_purpose.html|archive-date=2012-04-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concern of using large amounts of water has little to do with proportion of water used, rather the quality of the water. Traditionally close to 70 million cubic metres of the water volume that was used in the SAGD process was fresh, surface, water. There has been a significant reduction in fresh water use as of 2010, when approximately 18 million cubic metres were used. Though to offset the drastic reduction in fresh water use, industry has begun to significantly increase the volume of saline [[groundwater]] involved.  This, as well as other, more general water saving techniques have allowed surface water usage by oil sands operations to decrease by more than threefold since production first began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Volume and Quality of Water used in Oil and Gas 1976-2010|url=http://environment.alberta.ca/01729.html|publisher=Government of Alberta|accessdate=4 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111209182743/http://environment.alberta.ca/01729.html|archive-date=2011-12-09|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Relying upon gravity drainage, SAGD also requires comparatively thick and homogeneous reservoirs, and so is not suitable for all heavy-oil production areas.

== Alternative methods ==

By 2009 the two commercially applied primal thermal recovery processes, Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) and Cyclic Steam Stimulation (CSS), were used in oil sands production in the [[Clearwater Formation|Clearwater]] and [[Lower Grand Rapids Formation]]s in the Cold Lake Area in Alberta.&lt;ref name="OSUM2009Jiang" /&gt;

=== Cyclic Steam Stimulation (CSS) ===

[[Canadian Natural Resources]] employs cyclic steam or "huff and puff" technology to develop bitumen resources. This technology requires one well bore and the production consists of the injection to fracture and heat the formation prior to the production phases. First steam is injected above the formation fracture point for several weeks or months, mobilizing cold bitumen, the well is then shut in for several weeks or months to allow the steam to soak into the formation. Then the flow on the injection well is reversed producing oil through the same injection well bore. The injection and production phases together comprise one cycle. Steam is re-injected to begin a new cycle when oil production rates fall below a critical threshold due to the cooling of the reservoir.&lt;ref name="CNRL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnrl.com/operations/north-america/north-american-crude-oil-and-ngls/thermal-insitu-oilsands/|publisher=CNRL|year=2013|title=Cyclic Steam Stimulation|series=Thermal in situ oil sands|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016105950/http://www.cnrl.com/operations/north-america/north-american-crude-oil-and-ngls/thermal-insitu-oilsands/|archivedate=2015-10-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyclic Steam Stimulation (CSS) also has a number of CSS Follow-up or Enhancement Processes, including Pressure Up and Blow Down (PUBD), Mixed Well Steam Drive and Drainage (MWSDD), Vapor Extraction (Vapex), Liquid Addition to Steam for Enhanced Recovery of Bitumen (LASER) and HPCSS Assisted SAGD and Hybrid Process.&lt;ref name="OSUM2009Jiang" /&gt;

=== High pressure cyclic steam stimulation (HPCSS) ===

"Roughly 35 per cent of all ''in situ'' production in the Alberta oil sands uses a technique called High Pressure Cyclic Steam Stimulation (HPCSS), which cycles between two phases: first, steam is injected into an underground oil sands deposit to fracture and heat the formation to soften the bitumen just like CSS does, excepting at even higher pressures; then, the cycle switches to production where the resulting hot mixture of bitumen and steam (called a “bitumen emulsion”) is pumped up to the surface through the same well, again just like CSS, until the resulting pressure drop slows production to an uneconomical stage. The process is then repeated multiple times. "&lt;ref name="SeversonBaker29Jul2013"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cold Lake bitumen blowout first test for new energy regulator|author=Chris Severson-Baker|date=29 July 2013|url=http://www.pembina.org/blog/741}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Alberta Energy Regulator]] (AER) news release explained the difference between high pressure cyclic steam stimulation (HPCSS) and steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD). "HPCSS has been used in oil recovery in Alberta for more than 30 years. The method involves injecting high-pressure steam, well above the ambient reservoir pressure, into a reservoir over a prolonged period of time. As heat softens the bitumen and water dilutes and separates the bitumen from the sand, the pressure creates fractures, cracks and openings through which the bitumen can flow back into the steam-injector wells. HPCSS differs from steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) operations where steam is continuously injected at lower pressures without fracturing the reservoir and uses gravity drainage as the primary recovery mechanism. "&lt;ref name="AER18jul2013"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aer.ca/about-aer/media-centre/news-releases/3632|title=Alberta Energy Regulator orders enhanced monitoring and further steaming restrictions at Primrose and Wolf Lake projects due to bitumen emulsion releases|date=18 July 2013|publisher=AER|access-date=2013-07-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730233259/http://www.aer.ca/about-aer/media-centre/news-releases/3632|archive-date=2013-07-30|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Clearwater Formation near Cold Lake, Alberta the High Pressure Cyclic Steam Stimulation (HPCSS) is used.&lt;ref name="OSUM2009Jiang" /&gt; There are both horizontal and vertical wells. Injection is at fracture pressure. There is a 60 m to 180 m spacing for horizontal wells. Vertical wells are spaced at 2 to 8 Acre spacing for vertical wells. The development can be as low as 7 m net pay. It is used in areas generally with no to minimal bottom water or top gas. The CSOR is 3.3 to 4.5. The ultimate recovery is predicted at 15 to 35%.&lt;ref name="OSUM2009Jiang" /&gt; SAGD thermal recovery method is also used in Clearwater and [[Mannville Group#Grand Rapids Formation#Subunits|Lower Grand Rapids Formations]] with Horizontal Well Pairs (700 to 1000 m), Operating pressure 3 to 5 MPa, Burnt Lake SAGD was started with higher operating pressure close to dilation pressure, 75 m to 120 m spacing, Development to as low as 10 m net pay, In areas with or without bottom water, CSOR: 2.8 to 4.0 (at 100% quality), Predicted ultimate recovery: 45% to 55%.&lt;ref name="OSUM2009Jiang" /&gt;

[[Canadian Natural Resources|Canadian Natural Resources Limited’s (CNRL)]] Primrose and Wolf Lake in situ oil sands project near [[CFB Cold Lake|Cold Lake, Alberta]] in the [[Clearwater Formation]], operated by CNRL subsidiary [[Horizon Oil Sands]], use the high pressure cyclic steam stimulation (HPCSS). &lt;ref name="OSUM2009Jiang" /&gt;

=== Vapor Extraction (Vapex) ===

Alternative enhanced oil recovery mechanisms include VAPEX ('''V'''apor '''A'''ssisted '''P'''etroleum '''Ex'''traction), Electro-Thermal Dynamic Stripping Process (ET-DSP), and ISC (for In Situ Combustion). VAPEX, a "gravity-drainage process that uses vapourized solvents rather than steam to displace or produce heavy oil and reduce its viscosity, was also invented by Butler.&lt;ref name="UofC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Unlocking the oil sands: The late Dr. Roger Butler, Schulich School of Engineering|publisher=University of Calgary|location=Calgary, Alberta|url=https://www.ucalgary.ca/community/research/dr_roger_butlers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ET-DSP is a patented process that uses electricity to heat oil sands deposits to mobilize bitumen allowing production using simple vertical wells.  ISC uses [[oxygen]] to generate heat that diminishes oil viscosity; alongside carbon dioxide generated by heavy crude oil displace oil toward production wells. One ISC approach is called THAI for Toe to Heel Air Injection.&lt;ref name="UofC" /&gt;

=== Enhanced Modified Steam and Gas Push (eMSAGP)===

eMSAGP is a MEG Energy patented&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ic.gc.ca/opic-cipo/cpd/eng/patent/2776704/summary.html?query=meg+energy&amp;start=1&amp;num=50&amp;type=basic_search&lt;/ref&gt; process wherein MEG, in partnership with Cenovus&lt;ref&gt;https://katusaresearch.com/canadian-oil-sands-us-shale-innovation-via-necessity/&lt;/ref&gt;, developed a modified recovery process dubbed “enhanced Modified Steam and Gas Push” (eMSAGP), a modification of SAGP designed to improve the thermal efficiency of SAGD by utilizing additional producers located midway between adjacent SAGD well pairs, at the elevation of the SAGD producers. These additional producers, commonly referred to as “infill” wells, are an integral part of the eMSAGP recovery system.

[[File:StephaneLupasco.jpg|thumb|Stéphane Lupasco]]
'''Stéphane Lupasco''' (born '''Ştefan Lupaşcu'''; 11 August 1900 – 7 October 1988) was a [[Romania]]n [[philosopher]] who developed [[non-Aristotelian logic]].

==Early years==
Stéphane Lupasco was born in [[Bucharest]] on 11 August 1900. His family belonged to the old [[Moldavia]]n [[aristocracy]]. His father was a lawyer and politician, but it was his mother, a pianist and student of [[César Franck]], who established the family in [[Paris]] in 1916. After high school at the [[Lycée Buffon]], he studied [[philosophy]], [[biology]] and [[physics]] at the [[Sorbonne]] and, briefly, [[law]]. He participated fully in the artistic and intellectual life of Paris in the 20s and 30s and defended his State Doctoral Thesis in 1935.

==Academic career==
In 1946, he was named Research Assistant at the [[French National Science Research Centre]], a post he was obliged to leave ten years later because of the inability of the Centre to decide in which Scientific Section his work belonged! The next ten or fifteen years were those of greatest acceptance of his work by the public and other thinkers, but unfortunately not by mainstream logicians and philosophers. His ''Trois Matières'', published in 1960 was a bestseller, and people began calling Lupasco the [[Descartes]], the [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], the [[Hegel]] of the 20th Century, a new [[Claude Bernard]], a new [[Bergson]], etc. He continued to publish books in the 70s and 80s, the last being ''L’Homme et ses Trois Ethiques'' in 1986, two years before his death on October 7, 1988 in Paris. An Award of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1984 was among the few honors that came to Lupasco during his lifetime. Lupasco was one of the founding members of the International Center for Transdisciplinary Research (Centre International de Recherches et Etudes Transdisciplinaires (CIRET)), founded in Paris in 1987 by [[Basarab Nicolescu]], [[Edgar Morin]], [[René Berger]], [[Michel Random]] and other key figures of the French intelligentsia. As Nicolescu has recalled, Lupasco was deeply affected by the stubborn resistance of the academic community to honest debate and discussion of his new principles and postulates, and it is with an understandable bitterness that Lupasco saw in this resistance another example of the operation of his principles.

==Summary of work==
{{Original research|section|date=March 2011}}
Lupasco’s style as an author is not an easy one, and requires the uninterrupted attention of the reader. It is not infrequent to find sentences of almost a page in length, containing multiply nested clauses. His writing is extremely dense in terms of the ideas and meaning of each successive phrase, with only occasional illustrative examples. Lupasco makes many references to his prior publications, unfortunately, often without adequate indexation. As Nicolescu has remarked, Lupasco’s exclusion from French academic life had both advantages and disadvantages: Lupasco was freed from the constraints of teaching and publication of research papers in a rigid format, and he obviously did not find it necessary to apply the discipline of providing references to his sources. In the ''Psychic Universe'', published when Lupasco was seventy-nine, one sees nothing about current work in psychiatry. (Lupasco unfortunately did not read English well, and hence no references to the “anti”-psychiatry of [[R. D. Laing]] and [[Gregory Bateson]], close in spirit to his work, are to be found.) A recent study by Brenner (2008) up-dates Lupasco’s work and shows its relevance to current issues in science and philosophy, as well as logic.

==Influence==
Lupasco was not well served by the (few) exegetes that had looked closely at his work. Only one book, by the sociologist [[Marc Beigbeder]], presents both a substantial description of Lupasco’s theory and development of it as a “logic of society”. A brief monograph by the philosopher [[Benjamin Fondane]], dating from 1944 (just prior to his deportation and death) and published in 1998, discusses the limitations of Lupasco’s view of [[affectivity]] and [[ontology]]. A book by an obscure English artist, [[George Melhuish]], uses Lupasco’s ideas to develop his own concept of the structure of the universe, a sympathetic but not very rigorous reading of his work. Aside from Nicolescu's personal library it has been claimed that access to these and several other texts  are otherwise unavailable. A complete understanding of, for example, Lupasco’s analysis of those precursors that [[André Glucksmann]] has called “Les Maîtres Penseurs” – [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Hegel]], [[Schopenhauer]] and [[Marx]] – must be sought in several different books. The attention of the reader is rewarded, however, by Lupasco’s regular restatements of his basic theses, often in a way that is more economic, meaningful and coherent.

In his introduction to Lupasco’s ''The Principle of Antagonism and the Logic of Energy'', Nicolescu points out that once the reader gets beyond the (relatively few) mathematical formulas in this book, Lupasco’s language is perfectly accessible. “It exemplifies, in a self-referential manner, the ternary aspects of actualization, potentialization and included middle which give it the charm and the privilege of incantations that are at the same time scientific, philosophical and poetic.”

Summarizing briefly, stimulated by [[Einstein]]'s works and [[quantum]] theory, Lupasco founded a new [[logic]], questioning the ''[[tertium non datur]]'' principle of classical logic. He introduced a third state, going beyond the [[String duality|duality]] principle, the T-state. The T-state is  neither 'actual', nor 'potential' (categories replacing in Lupasco's system the 'true' or 'false' values of standard bivalent logic), but a resolution of the two contradictory elements at a higher level of reality or complexity. Lupasco generalised his logic to [[physics]] and [[epistemology]] and above all to a new theory of [[consciousness]].

==Recent studies==
A key reference in French is the compendium of 1999, "Stéphane Lupasco -The Man and the Work" by H. Badescu and B. Nicolescu. The first comprehensive update and comparison of Lupasco's thought in English is the 2008 book by J. E. Brenner, "Logic in Reality". Other useful new references are the combined papers of a Symposium on Lupasco in 2009 "At the Confluence of Two Cultures: Lupasco Today," in French and a biographical paper by Brenner, "The Philosophical Logic of Stéphane Lupasco (1900 - 1988)" in English.

Hagan's major publications include ''City Fights: Debates on Sustainable Cities'' (James &amp; James (Science) Publishers, London, 2000); ''Taking Shape:  A New Contract between Architecture and Nature'' (Architectural Press, Oxford, 2001); and ''Digitalia: Architecture and the Environmental, the Digital and the Avant-garde'' (Routledge, London, 2008).

==Biography==
Hagan was born in London and raised in England and the United States. She studied English and French literature at [[Yale University]] in New Haven, Connecticut, receiving a Bachelor of Arts with Honors degree in 1973.  She then moved to New York City, where she attended the Graduate School of Architecture at [[Columbia University]], earning a Master of Architecture degree in 1978.  As part of her architectural studies, Hagan spent a year abroad as an exchange student at the [[Architectural Association School of Architecture]] in London.

Susannah Hagan moved from United States to London in 1991 to pursue her studies in architectural history and theory, first at the Architectural Association Graduate School and then at [[Birkbeck, University of London]].  In 1999, Hagan was awarded a Doctor of Philosophy degree from the University of London.  In 2002 and 2003, she pursued postdoctoral research at the [[University of Cambridge]], completing the Master of Philosophy Program in Environmental Design and Architecture.

She taught on the faculty of the Environment and Energy Masters Program at the Architectural Association from 1996 to 2002, and in 2002, was invited to set up a new Masters Program at the [[University of East London]]. The MA Architecture: Sustainability + Design&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uel.ac.uk/programmes/ava/postgraduate/sustainabilitydesign.htm|title=MA Architecture: Sustainability + Design, University of East London}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the first to completely integrate the relevant technology and social theory with design. From 2009 to 2011, Hagan was Professor of Urban Studies and Director of the Office of Spatial Research at the [[University of Brighton]].

Her work with R_E_D includes EMPTYing CITIES,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theredgroup.org/urban/emptying-cities/|title=EMPTYing CITIES|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110504161442/http://www.theredgroup.org/urban/emptying-cities/|archivedate=4 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wuppertal, Germany, 2004–05, research-by-design into the problem of "shrinking cities," post-industrial cities losing population; EnLUDe 1 (Environmentally Led Urban DEsign), São Paulo, Brazil, 2005–07, a pilot research project with the LCAEE, University of São Paulo, involving environmentally led urban design on a large [[brownfield land|brownfield site]] earmarked for development by the city of São Paulo; and EnLUDe 2, Royal Docks, London, 2007–08, research-by-design into an environmentally led spatial planning on a high risk floodplain in the Thames Gateway.

In addition to her books on the relationship between environmental design and contemporary architecture and urban design, Hagan has also contributed to numerous others, including ''Nature, Landscape and Building for Sustainability''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upress.umn.edu/Books/S/saunders_nature.html|title=''Nature, Landscape and Building for Sustainability,'' University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis, 2008.}}&lt;/ref&gt; (University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis, 2008) and ''Ecological Urbanism''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lars-mueller-publishers.com/en/catalogsearch/result?q=ecological+urbanism#ecological-urbanism-1|title=''Ecological Urbanism,'' Lars Müller Publishers, Baden, 2010.}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Lars Müller Publishers, Baden, 2010), and to journals ranging from the [[Architectural Review]] to the [[Harvard Design Magazine]].  She has lectured internationally, including the Union of Baltic Cities Commission on Urban Planning, the annual NUTAU conference, São Paulo, the [[Moderna Museet]], Stockholm, and the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], London.

==Awards and recognition==
Hagan is a Fellow of the [[Institute for Urban Design]], New York, and a Fellow of the [[Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures &amp; Commerce]] (RSA), and a member of the International Development Network, the [[Royal Town Planning Institute]], and the Newham Borough Design Review Panel. Hagan was a finalist in the 2008/09 James Stirling Memorial Lecture Competition. In September 2010, "The Seed Catalogue, " an urban design competition entry submitted by Hagan, Silvio Caputo, and Mark Gaterell, was premiated in the international Integrated Habitats Design Competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ihdc.org.uk|title=Integrated Habitats Design Competition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Teachers Without Borders''' (''TWB'') is an international organization launched in 2000, with a mission to connect teachers to information and each other in order to close the education divide and based  upon the premise that teachers are community change agents and key catalysts of global development priorities. The organization was founded by [http://www.teacherswithoutborders.org/founder/ Dr. Fred Mednick]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} 

Teachers Without Borders received the '''[https://luxembourgpeaceprize.org/laureates/outstanding-peace-education/2018-teachers-without-borders/ 2018 Luxembourg Peace Prize]''' for Outstanding Peace Education, recognized for a free Peace Education program involving teachers from regions in conflict, for having embedded peace education into all TWB courses (see below), and its Voice of Teachers Radio Show in Nigeria. 

Teachers Without Borders received the [https://www.changemakers.com/champions-quality-education-africa '''Champions of African Education Award'''] (2010) for its use of radio and local educational capacity building to disseminate information about the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. In 2018, TWB's membership has reached 177 countries. Teachers Without Borders membership is free and enables local educators the opportunity to connect with colleagues globally.

Teachers Without Borders also received the '''[http://peacesymposium.org.uk/the-ahmadiyya-muslim-peace-prize Ahmadiyya Muslim Peace Prize]''' for "outstanding work in the promotion of peace through efforts to convene teachers from regions in conflict, provide unfettered access to courses and networks devoted to teacher professional development, and to ensure that peace education is integrated into all initiatives. The formal announcement can be viewed [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viaSBMQxcAk&amp;t=9s '''here'''].

==Approach==
Teachers Without Borders claims that teachers represent the largest professional community in the world (over 65 million); that teachers are uniquely suited as local leaders to recognize and help address development needs; that professional isolation and inconsequential or missing teacher professional development undermines social change; and that the transformation of pre-service and in-service teacher development can bring about more sustainable, equitable, democratic, and economically stable societies.

==Initiatives and Courses==
Teachers Without Borders' initiatives and courses are offered in various formats and settings: online, in schools, as community workshops, in books and journals, and on the radio. All programs have been conceived and led by Teachers Without Borders' members and partners around the world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6384">The '''Thai Elephant Orchestra''' is a musical ensemble consisting of as many as fourteen [[Thai elephant]]s near [[Lampang]] in Northern [[Thailand]].  The elephants play music, essentially as conducted improvisations, on specially designed heavy-duty [[musical instrument]]s. The orchestra was co-created by elephant conservationist [[Richard Lair]] of the [[National Elephant Institute]]  and the American musical artist and [[neuroscientist]] [[Dave Soldier]].  They have released three CDs on the [[Mulatta Records]] label with an orchestra ranging in size from six to fourteen elephants.  The orchestra currently performs for visitors at the center.

==Background==
It has been noted since ancient times that elephants seem to have an affinity for music.   Performing circus elephants commonly follow musical cues, and early American circuses such as [[Adam Forepaugh]] and [[Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus|Barnum &amp; Bailey]] even featured "elephant bands."&lt;ref name=NYT(2000) /&gt;  In the 1950s, German evolutionary biologist [[Bernard Rensch]] found that elephants can distinguish 12 tones on the musical scale and remember simple melodies, even when played on different instruments at various pitches, timbres, and meters.&lt;ref name=NYT(2000)&gt;{{cite news|last=Scigliano|first=Eric|title=Think Tank; A Band With a Lot More to Offer Than Talented Trumpeters|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/16/arts/think-tank-a-band-with-a-lot-more-to-offer-than-talented-trumpeters.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=December 16, 2000|location=Arts}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Scientist&gt;{{cite web|last=Flores|first=Graciela|title=When I see an elephant...paint?|url=http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/25148/title/When-I-see-an-elephant---paint-/|publisher=The Scientist|accessdate=21 March 2013|date=June 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An album of music created by elephant musicians was conceived by New York-based musical artist Dave Soldier (a.k.a. [[David Sulzer]], PhD) and elephant expert Richard Lair, who works at the Thai Elephant Conservation Center in Lampang. [[Traditional Thai music]] is a genre familiar to the elephants, so they chose Thai music scales with a few blues notes. According to Lair, many of the elephants took to their assignment "with gusto".&lt;ref name="PRI"&gt;{{cite web|title=Elephant Band : Transcript|url=http://www.loe.org/shows/segments.html?programID=01-P13-00009&amp;segmentID=11|work=PRI : Living on Earth|publisher=World Media Foundation|accessdate=28 March 2013|location=Air Date: Week of March 2, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
The Thai Elephant Orchestra primarily uses the ''Lanna'' Thai [[Pentatonic scale|five-note scale]], and most instruments are heavy-duty versions of [[traditional Thai musical instruments]]; additional instruments include drums and harmonica.&lt;ref name=Leonardo&gt;{{cite journal|last=Soldier|first=Dave|title=Eine Kleine Naughtmusik: How Nefarious Nonartists Cleverly Imitate Music|journal=Leonardo Music Journal|year=2002|volume=12|pages=57–58|url=http://mulatta.org/articles/Soldier_Leonardo.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=25 March 2013|doi=10.1162/096112102762295142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their musical works are of two general types. The first type features the elephants individually improvising on the instruments with the only human interaction being cues as to when to start and stop. The other type is compositional and requires [[mahout]]s to teach or train the elephants to perform human tunes as a [[hocket]], with each elephant playing an individual note on tuned instruments such as [[Angklung|angalung]]s.&lt;ref name=WNYC&gt;{{cite web|title=Thai Elephants on Parade|url=http://www.wnyc.org/shows/newsounds/2004/oct/12/|work=WNYC|publisher=New York Public Radio|accessdate=28 March 2013|location=New Sounds : Episode #2329|date=October 12, 2004|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120728104228/http://www.wnyc.org/shows/newsounds/2004/oct/12/|archivedate=28 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''UK Energy Research Centre''' ('''UKERC''') is the focal point for UK research on [[sustainable energy]], and is central to the [[UK Research Councils|Research Councils']] Energy Programme.&lt;ref name=ukerc-about&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/support/tiki-index.php?page=About_us&amp;structure=Home|title=About us|website=www.ukerc.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The centre has its headquarters at the campus of [[Imperial College, London]], providing support to 70 researchers based in 11 universities and research institutions across the UK: UCL; Strathclyde; Leeds; Imperial College London; Exeter; Sussex; the University of East Anglia; the Plymouth Marine Laboratory; Cardiff; Oxford; Aberdeen.

The organisation takes an independent, whole-systems approach, drawing on technical and non-technical disciplines including engineering, economics and the physical, environmental and social sciences. The Centre helps to co-ordinate the overall UK [[energy research]] effort and acts as a bridge between the UK energy research community, the international research community, business and policymakers.&lt;ref name=ukerc-about /&gt;

==History==
UKERC was established in April 2004, following a recommendation from the 2002 Energy Review initiated by Sir David King, the UK Government's Chief Scientific Advisor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/about-us/history.html|title=History|website=www.ukerc.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre was set up to address key controversies in the energy field through comprehensive assessments of the current state of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/support/tiki-download_file.php?fileId=283 Global Oil Depletion: An assessment of the evidence for a near-term peak in global oil production] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091012004031/http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/support/tiki-download_file.php?fileId=283 |date=2009-10-12 }}, page i, August 2009, published October 08, 2009, UK Energy Research Centre, {{ISBN|1-903144-03-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first phase of the Centre ran from 2004 - 2009.

In March 2009, £18.5 million was allocated to support the second phase of work at the UK Energy Research Centre for 2009 – 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nerc.ac.uk/press/releases/2009/07-ukerp.asp £18 million to secure the future of UK energy research], July 2009, NERC&lt;/ref&gt; Under the second phase of funding, UKERC focused on five themes: Energy Demand, Energy Supply, Energy Systems, Energy and Environment, and Technology and Policy Assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/support/tiki-index.php?page=Research|title=Programmes|website=www.ukerc.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2014, the UK Energy Research Centre was awarded funding for a third phase of work, which would run from 2014 to 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epsrc.ac.uk/newsevents/news/ukenergyresearchcentre/|title=RCUK commits £14 million to UK Energy Research Centre - EPSRC website|website=www.epsrc.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current Activity==
UKERC's third phase combines a research programme focused on six core themes: future energy system pathways; resources and vectors; energy systems at multiple scales; energy, economy and societal preferences; decision making; technology, policy and assessment - with an HQ function aimed at engaging with the wider UK energy research community, policy makers and energy industry. 

The Centre acts as the bridge between the UK energy research community and the wider world; fulfilling the role of a national energy research laboratory by both informing and representing the energy research community and acting as a catalyst for UK-wide collaboration in order to address the key energy challenges ahead.

UKERC's interdisciplinary research studentships have enabled whole-systems interdisciplinary research across scientific, engineering and socio-economic boundaries.

Full details of all UKERC's activities and research output can be found at UKERC's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukerc.ac.uk|title=UKERC|website=www.ukerc.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National University of South''' (in Spanish: ''Universidad Nacional del Sur'', '''UNS''') is the largest [[national university]] in southern [[Argentina]]. Its motto is ''Ardua Veritatem'', which means "through the difficulties to the truth".

The university was founded on January 5, 1956, and absorbed what had been the '''Technological Institute of South''' (Instituto Tecnológico del Sur, ITS), a former [[National University of La Plata]] affiliate established in 1946. Located in the city of [[Bahía Blanca]], the school became the sixteenth in Argentina's national university system &lt;ref&gt;https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/latin-american-university-rankings/2016&lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==

The Instituto Tecnológico del Sur was created on October 9, 1946 by Provincial Act No. 5051, and it began its activities under the academic dependence on the National University of La Plata. In 1947, the Nation and the province Buenos Aires signed an agreement that stated that both of them would supply the funds for the operation and maintenance of the institute. On February 12, 1948, the incumbent president, [[Juan Domingo Perón]], appointed Dr. Miguel López Francés as President of the University, who was in charge of adopting the necessary measures for the organization thereof. The official inauguration ceremony of the ITS was held on February 20, 1948. The category of university was granted in 1950, however, it was cancelled in 1952, and it depended again on the Ministry of Economy of the Nation. The first graduate of the Institute was Engineer Nereo Roberto Parro, in 1953, who was a natural of the town of Tornquist. In 1955, after the fall of Perón's government, Professor Pedro González Prieto was appointed auditor of the institute, and proceedings before the national government began for the institute to become a national university. After the studies carried out by an advisor committee appointed by the Executive Power, the creation of the Universidad Nacional del Sur was approved by decree law No. 154, dated January 5, 1956.

==The Universidad Nacional del Sur==

In 1956 Professor Vicente Fatone was appointed Auditor President. Classes at the brand new institution began on April 1 of that same year. The UNS was the seventh national university created in the country, after the universities of Córdoba (1613), La Plata (1890), Tucumán (1912), Litoral (1919), and Cuyo (1939).

The new institution organized its academic structure into Departments, instead of the traditional Schools. Departments have a smaller administrative structure and allow for knowledge flexibility and inter-disciplinarity. Thus, academic units do not have to create for their careers those courses given at other departments, so that students can take them at the corresponding departments. The first Departments were Accountancy, Economics, Physics, Geology and Geography, Mathematics, Engineering, Humanities, and Chemistry.

After just a month of its opening, two students who had begun their careers at the Institute, Jorge Laurent and David Tomás Prieto, took the exams for the last courses, thus becoming the first graduates in the institution. The first woman to obtain her degree at the UNS was Betty Kerlleñevich, from Bahía Blanca, one of the founding students of the ITS, who also obtained a degree in engineering.

==Campus and facilities==

The main university complex is located at Alem 1253, where most of the Departments and laboratories operate as well as the Central Library. It is a large building that takes up more than a block and at the front there is a fountain with a sculpture by the artist Lola Mora. There are other buildings at the same premises:

At the intersection of 12 de Octubre and San Juan streets, are the buildings for the Departments of Humanities, Economics, Geography and Tourism, and Administration Sciences.

In the area known as "Altos del Palihue" there is another complex where the Departments of Agronomy and Law are located. There, the university has several acres of land, in which the Escuela de Agricultura y Ganadería "Ing. Agr. Adolfo J. Zabala" is also located.

The building located at Colon 80 originally corresponded to the headquarters of the Universidad Nacional del Sur. At present, the activities of the President's Office and its Secretariats are focused here, together with other administrative offices.

At Alem 925 is the "Casa de la Cultura", a colonial mansion that was formerly the center of an important villa. In this building, the General Secretariat of Communication and Culture organizes artistic and cultural activities. The University Foundation (FUNS) and Publishing House (EdiUNS) are also located there. In the buildings located at 11 de Abril 445 are the Escuela Superior de Comercio, Escuela de EGB (Initial Level, Levels 1, 2, and 3) and Escuela Normal Superior.

Currently, it includes sixteen departments: 
*[[Agronomy]]
*[[Biochemistry]]
*[[Biology]]
*[[Chemistry]]
*[[Computer science]]
*[[Economics]]
*[[Electrical engineering]]
*[[Engineering]]
*[[Geography]]
*[[Geology]]
*[[Humanities]]
*[[Law]]
*[[Management]]
*[[Mathematics]]
*[[Medicine]]

[[Image:Blessing genie Dur Sharrukin.jpg|thumb|A four-winged genie in the [[Bucket and cone]] motif. Relief from the north wall of the Palace of king [[Sargon II]] at [[Dur Sharrukin]], 713–716 BC.]]
'''Winged genie''' is the conventional term for a recurring motif in the iconography of [[Assyrian sculpture]].
Winged genies are usually bearded male figures sporting birds' [[wing]]s. The Genii are a reappearing trait in ancient [[Assyrian art]], and are displayed most prominently in palaces or places of royalty.  The two most notable places where the genius existed were [[Ashurnasirpal II]]’s palace [[Kalhu]] and [[Sargon II]]’s palace [[Dur-Sharrukin]].

== Variations of style ==

They appear in the reliefs of the walls and throughout the temples and palaces in a wide variety of ways.  There are three common stylistic tendencies in reliefs with genii.  First there are bearded, winged figures wearing a horned helmet.  Next there are bearded, winged figures wearing a diadem instead of helmet.  Finally there are winged, muscular, male figures with bird heads.  They are usually adorned with rosettes on their [[diadem]] and/or wrists.  Most often they are wearing a short sleeved, knee-length tunic with a tasseled hem.  Over the tunic is an ankle length fringed shawl that covers the near leg, wraps around the body and drapes the left shoulder, with the end hanging down the back to the waist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Collins|first=Paul|title=An Assyrian-Style Ivory Plaque from Hansalu, Iran|journal=Metropolitan Museum Journal|year=2006|volume=41|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==

These genii have all been interpreted as beings known as [[antediluvian]] sages or '''[[apkallu]]''' in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]].  They were beings that existed during a godlike generation of humanity.  These beings were closely associated with the god [[Enki]].  During the antediluvian age humanity was "covered" or more commonly referred to as the [[great flood]], and the inhabitants were purified and roamed the earth as invisible genii.  There are also other references to the apkallus as being purified humans that were sent to [[Apsû]], the underground sweet water realm of Enki/Ea by [[Marduk]] the ruler god.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Atac|first=Mehment-Ali|title=Visual Formula and Meaning in Neo Assyrian Relief Sculpture|journal=The Art Bulletin|date=March 2006|volume=88|issue=1|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Functions ==

Aside from their wardrobe, the genii were created with several different functioning symbols.  Several genii are shown carrying a small quadruped. This small creature, possibly a fawn or gazelle, had been interpreted as being a representation of a [[scapegoat]]. This creature was used to contain the spirit of an exorcised demon. The genii would hold the quadruped to show its supernatural protective powers for the king and his people.  The other interpretation of this symbol lies with it association with abundance.  The genii shown holding the quadruped represents the divine reasoning for the kingdom's abundance and protection over said abundance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Collins|first=Paul|title=An Assyrian-Style Ivory Plaque from Hansalu, Iran|journal=Metropolitan Museum Journal|year=2006|volume=41|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other depictions of genii show them holding what appear to be a pine cone and a pail. These two elements are commonly associated with the [[Tree of Life]].  Many interpretations have stated that the depiction is of the genii fertilizing the tree and tending to it. Other interpretations place the pine cone as an object known as a '''mu-li-la''', and in conjunction with the pail, is used to avert evil forces whether real or supernatural.  Another interpretation stated that the tree and sun above it represent the distinction between heaven and earth.  Some theories state that these symbols are directly related to the cult of [[Assur]], where the sun symbolizes [[Shamash]] the sun god and the tree symbolizes Assur himself. Therefore, it is inferred that the genii protecting the tree represent the supernatural forces that the Assyrians believed were protecting the earth and more importantly the [[Assyrian Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grace|first=Fredrick|title=An Assyrian Winged Genius|journal=Bulletin of the Fogg Art Museum|date=March 1940|volume=9|issue=2|pages=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Similarity to the king ==

Due to the ornate nature of the kings and genii, there are many times in which the distinction between the king and a genie are impossible.  They are dressed in identical clothes and if the genie has no wings there is nothing separating it from a human.  Both genii and the king would wear earrings made of a single conical-tipped pendant suspended from a crescent.  Also if a genie was bearded there would be nothing different from a beard on that of a human.  The standard beard of a human consisted three layers, and the genie would have the same as well.  Variations of beards later on do exist, but still do not distinguish the genii from the king.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Collins|first=Paul|title=An Assyrian-Style Ivory Plaque from Hansalu, Iran|journal=Metropolitan Museum Journal|year=2006|volume=41|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cross culture influence ==

Winged genii co-existed with numerous other [[mythological hybrid]]s in the Early Iron Age art of Assyria and Asia Minor. They influenced [[Archaic Greece]] during its "[[orientalizing period]]", resulting in the hybrid creatures of Greek mythology such as the [[Chimera (mythology)|Chimera]], the [[Griffin]] or [[Pegasus]] and, in the case of the "winged man", [[Talos]]. The orientalizing period has its origin in Early Iron Age (9th century BC) [[Crete]], where bearded and winged figures clearly inspired by Assyrian templates are found engraved in bronze bowls and other artefacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John D. |last=Pendlebury |work=The Archaeology of Crete |year=1991 |page=336 |url=http://www.cycladic.gr/frontoffice/portal.asp?cpage=resource&amp;cresrc=1176&amp;cnode=55 |title=The "orientalizing" period in Greek art }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "winged man" also makes an appearance among the [[Chayot]] of [[Ezekiel]]'s [[Merkabah]] vision, and via {{bibleverse||Revelation|4:7|KJV}} becomes the symbol of [[Matthew the Evangelist]]. The [[Seraphim]] of [[Isaiah]] (6:1–3) have six wings each.
