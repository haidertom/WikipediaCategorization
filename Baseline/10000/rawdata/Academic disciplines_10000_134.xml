'''Amusia''' is a [[music-specific disorders|musical disorder]] that appears mainly as a defect in processing [[pitch (music)|pitch]] but also encompasses musical memory and recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pearce J. M. S. | year = 2005 | title = Selected observations on amusia." [Article] | url = | journal = European Neurology | volume = 54 | issue = 3| pages = 145–48 | doi=10.1159/000089606}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two main classifications of amusia exist: acquired amusia, which occurs as a result of [[brain damage]], and congenital amusia, which results from a music-processing anomaly present since birth.

Studies have shown that congenital amusia is a deficit in fine-grained pitch discrimination and that 4% of the population suffers from this disorder.&lt;ref name=Insights&gt;{{cite journal | author = Peretz I., Hyde K. L. | year = 2003 | title = What is specific to music processing? Insights from congenital amusia." [Review] | url = | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 7 | issue = 8| pages = 362–67 | doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(03)00150-5 | pmid=12907232}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acquired amusia, on the other hand, may take several forms. Patients with brain damage may experience the loss of ability to produce musical sounds while sparing [[speech]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Peretz I., Zatorre R. | year = 2005 | title =  Brain Organization for Music Processing| url = | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 56 | issue = | pages = 89–114 | doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.56.091103.070225| pmid = 15709930 }}&lt;/ref&gt; much like [[aphasia|aphasics]] lose speech selectively but can sometimes still [[singing|sing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hébert S., Racette A., Gagnon L., Peretz I. | year = 2003 | title = Revisiting the dissociation between singing and speaking in expressive aphasia | url = http://www.brams.umontreal.ca/plab/publications/articles | journal = Brain | volume = 126 | issue = 8 | pages = 1838–50 | doi = 10.1093/brain/awg186 | pmid = 12821526 | access-date = 17 June 2009 | archive-url = https://archive.is/20120721222425/http://www.brams.umontreal.ca/plab/publications/articles | archive-date = 21 July 2012 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dorgueille, C. 1966. Introduction à l'étude des amusies.
Unpublished doctoral dissertation, Université de la Sorbonne, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; Other forms of amusia may affect specific sub-processes of music processing. Current research has demonstrated [[dissociation (neuropsychology)|dissociations]] between [[rhythm]], [[melody]], and emotional processing of music,&lt;ref&gt;Sacks, Oliver. (2007). ''Musicophilia'', New York: Random House. pp. 3–17, 187–258, 302–03.&lt;/ref&gt; and amusia may include impairment of any combination of these skill sets.

==Basics of music processing==
Neurologically intact individuals appear to be born musical. Even before they are able to talk, infants show remarkable musical abilities that are similar to those of adults in that they are sensitive to [[musical scale]]s and a regular [[tempo]].&lt;ref name=Insights/&gt; Also, infants are able to differentiate between [[Consonance and dissonance|consonant and dissonant]] intervals. These perceptual skills indicate that music-specific predispositions exist.&lt;ref name=Insights/&gt;

Prolonged exposure to music develops and refines these skills. Extensive musical training does not seem to be necessary in the processing of [[Chord (music)|chords]] and [[key (music)|keys]].&lt;ref name=Insights/&gt; The development of musical competence most likely depends on the encoding of pitch along musical scales and maintaining a regular [[pulse (music)|pulse]], both of which are key components in the structure of music and aid in perception, memory, and performance.&lt;ref name=Insights/&gt; Also, the encoding of pitch and temporal regularity are both likely to be specialized for music processing.&lt;ref name=Insights/&gt; Pitch perception is absolutely crucial to processing music. The use of scales and the organization of scale tones around a central tone (called the [[Tonic (music)|tonic]]) assign particular importance to notes in the scale and cause non-scale notes to sound out of place. This enables the listener to ascertain when a wrong note is played. However, in individuals with amusia, this ability is either compromised or lost entirely.&lt;ref name=Insights/&gt;

Music-specific neural networks exist in the brain for a variety of music-related tasks. It has been shown that [[Broca's area]] is involved in the processing of musical syntax.&lt;ref&gt;Burkhard Maess, Stefan Koelsch, Thomas C. Gunter and Angela D. Friederici. "Musical syntax is processed in Broca’s area: an MEG study" (2001) ''Nature Publishing Group''.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, brain damage can disrupt an individual's ability to tell the difference between [[tonality|tonal]] and [[atonality|atonal]] music and detect the presence of wrong notes, but can preserve the individual's ability to assess the distance between pitches and the direction of the pitch.&lt;ref name=Insights/&gt; The opposite scenario can also occur, in which the individual loses pitch discrimination capabilities, but can sense and appreciate the tonal context of the work. Distinct neural networks also exist for music memories, singing, and music recognition. Neural networks for music recognition are particularly intriguing. A patient can undergo brain damage that renders them unable to recognize familiar melodies that are presented without words. However, the patient maintains the ability to recognize spoken lyrics or words, familiar voices, and environmental sounds.&lt;ref name=Insights/&gt; The reverse case is also possible, in which the patient cannot recognize spoken words, but can still recognize familiar melodies. These situations overturn previous claims that speech recognition and music recognition share a single processing system.&lt;ref name=Insights/&gt; Instead, it is clear that there are at least two distinct processing modules: one for speech and one for music.&lt;ref name=Insights/&gt;

==Symptoms==
Symptoms of amusia are generally categorized as receptive, clinical, or mixed. Symptoms of receptive amusia, sometimes referred to as "musical deafness", include the inability to recognize familiar [[melodies]], the loss of ability to read [[musical notation]], and the inability to detect wrong or out-of tune notes.&lt;ref name=Neuroanatomy&gt;http://amusia-brain.blogspot.com/2008/02/definition_25.html Hutchings, Tiffany, Seth Hayden, Mandy Politziner, and Erina Kainuma. "Amusia." Web log post. Amusia: Definition, Welcome to Amusia..., Congenital and Acquired Amusia, Neural Overview. 25 Feb. 2008. Web. 10 Oct. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Clinical, or expressive, symptoms include the loss of ability to sing, write [[musical notation]], and/or play an instrument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bautista R., Ciampetti M. | year = 2003 | title = Expressive Aprosody and Amusia as a Manifestation of Right Hemisphere Seizures | url = | journal = Epilepsia | volume = 44 | issue = 3| pages = 466–67 | doi=10.1046/j.1528-1157.2003.36502.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; A mixed disorder would be a combination of expressive and receptive impairment.

Clinical symptoms of acquired amusia are much more variable than those of congenital amusia and are determined by the location and nature of the lesion.&lt;ref name=Neuroanatomy/&gt; Brain injuries may afflict motor or expressive functioning, including the ability to sing, whistle, or hum a tune (oral-expressive amusia), the ability to play an instrument (instrumental amusia or musical apraxia), and the ability to write music (musical agraphia). Additionally, brain damage to the receptive dimension affects the faculty to discriminate tunes (receptive or sensorial amusia), the ability to read music (musical alessia), and the ability to identify songs that were familiar prior to the brain damage (amnesic amusia).

Research suggests that patients with amusia also have difficulty when it comes to spatial processing.&lt;ref name=nature&gt;{{cite journal | author = Douglas K. M., Bilkey D.K. | year = 2007 | title = Amusia is Associated with Deficits in Spatial Processing | url = | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 10 | issue = 7| pages = 915–21 | doi=10.1038/nn1925}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amusics performed more quickly than normal individuals on a combined task of both spatial and musical processing tasks, which is most likely due to their deficit. Normal individuals experience interference due to their intact processing of both musical and spatial tasks, while amusics do not.&lt;ref name=nature/&gt; Pitch processing normally depends on the cognitive mechanisms that are usually used to process spatial representations.&lt;ref name=nature/&gt;

Those with congenital amusia show impaired performance on discrimination, identification and imitation of sentences with [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonational]] differences in pitch direction in their final word. This suggests that amusia can in subtle ways impair language processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Liu F, Patel AD, Fourcin A, Stewart L | year = 2010 | title = Intonation processing in congenital amusia: discrimination, identification and imitation | url = | journal = Brain | volume = 133 | issue = 6| pages = 1682–93 | doi = 10.1093/brain/awq089 | pmid = 20418275 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classifications==
There are two general classifications of amusia: congenital amusia and acquired amusia.

===Congenital amusia===
'''Congenital amusia''', commonly known as '''tone deafness''',&lt;ref name=Family/&gt; refers to a musical disability that cannot be explained by prior brain lesion, hearing loss, cognitive defects, or lack of environmental stimulation,&lt;ref name="Fine-grained"/&gt; and it affects about 4% of the population.&lt;ref name=Insights/&gt; Individuals who suffer from congenital amusia seem to lack the musical predispositions with which most people are born.&lt;ref name=Time&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hyde K. L., Peretz I. | year = 2004 | title = Brains that are out of tune but in time." [Article] | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 15 | issue = 5| pages = 356–60 | doi=10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00683.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are unable to recognize or hum familiar tunes even if they have normal [[audiometry]] and above-average intellectual and memory skills. Also, they do not show sensitivity to dissonant chords in a melodic context, which, as discussed earlier, is one of the musical predispositions exhibited by infants. The hallmark of congenital amusia is a deficit in fine-grained pitch discrimination, and this deficit is most apparent when congenital amusics are asked to pick out a wrong note in a given melody.&lt;ref name=Insights/&gt; If the distance between two successive pitches is small, congenital amusics are not able to detect a pitch change. As a result of this defect in pitch perception, a lifelong musical impairment may emerge due to a failure to internalize musical scales. A lack of fine-grained pitch discrimination makes it extremely difficult for amusics to enjoy and appreciate music, which consists largely of small pitch changes.&lt;ref name=Time/&gt;

Tone-deaf people seem to be disabled only when it comes to music as they can fully interpret the [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] or [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] of human speech.  Tone deafness has a strong negative [[correlation]] with belonging to societies with [[tonal language]]s.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} This could be evidence that the ability to reproduce and distinguish between notes may be a learned skill; conversely, it may suggest that the genetic predisposition towards accurate pitch discrimination may influence the linguistic development of a population towards tonality. A correlation between [[allele frequencies]] and linguistic typological features has been recently discovered, supporting the latter hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dediu |first=Dan |author2=D. Robert Ladd |title=Linguistic tone is related to the population frequency of the adaptive haplogroups of two brain size genes, ASPM and Microcephalin |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] |volume=104 |issue=26 |pages=10944–49 |date=June 2007 |pmid=17537923 |pmc=1904158 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0610848104 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/104/26/10944 |accessdate=18 July 2008|bibcode=2007PNAS..10410944D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tone deafness is also associated with other musical-specific impairments such as the inability to keep time with music ([[beat deafness]], or the lack of [[rhythm]]), or the inability to remember or recognize a song. These disabilities can appear separately, but some research shows that they are more likely to appear in tone-deaf people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Julie |last=Ayotte |author2=Isabelle Peretz |author3=Krista Hyde |title=Congenital amusia: a group study of adults afflicted with a music-specific disorder |journal=[[Brain (journal)|Brain]] |volume=125 |issue=2 |pages=238–51 |date=February 2002 |pmid=11844725 |doi=10.1093/brain/awf028 |url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/125/2/238 |accessdate=18 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Experienced musicians, such as [[W.

A. |title=Tone-Deaf Choir |url=http://ListeningBookAudio.com/tonedeaf.htm |accessdate=26 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquired amusia===
'''Acquired amusia''' is a musical disability that shares the same characteristics as congenital amusia, but rather than being inherited, it is the result of brain damage.&lt;ref name= Stroke&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sarkamo T., Tervaniemi M., Soinila S., Autti T., Silvennoinen H. M., Laine M. ''et al.'' | year = 2009 | title = Cognitive deficits associated with acquired amusia after stroke: A neuropsychological follow-up study." [Article] | url = | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 47 | issue = 12| pages = 2642–2651 | doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2009.05.015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also more common than congenital amusia.&lt;ref name=Stroke/&gt; While it has been suggested that music is processed by music-specific neural networks in the brain, this view has been broadened to show that music processing also encompasses generic cognitive functions, such as memory, attention, and executive processes.&lt;ref name=Stroke/&gt; A recent study was conducted to investigate the neural and cognitive mechanisms that underlie acquired amusia and contribute to its recovery.&lt;ref name=Stroke/&gt; The study was performed on 53 stroke patients with a left or right hemisphere [[middle cerebral artery]] (MCA) infarction one week, three months, and six months after the stroke occurred.&lt;ref name=Stroke/&gt; Amusic subjects were identified one week following their stroke, and over the course of the study, amusics and non-amusics were compared in both brain lesion location and their performances on neuropsychological tests.

Results showed that there was no significant difference in the distribution of left and right hemisphere lesions between amusic and non-amusic groups, but that the amusic group had a significantly higher number of lesions to the [[frontal lobe]] and [[auditory cortex]].&lt;ref name=Stroke/&gt; [[Temporal lobe]] lesions were also observed in patients with amusia.  Amusia is a common occurrence following an [[ischemic]] MCA stroke, as evidenced by the 60% of patients who were found to be amusic at the one-week post-stroke stage.&lt;ref name= Stroke/&gt; While significant recovery takes place over time, amusia can persist for long periods of time.&lt;ref name=Stroke/&gt; Test results suggest that acquired amusia and its recovery in the post-stroke stage are associated with a variety of cognitive functions, particularly attention, executive functioning, and working memory.&lt;ref name=Stroke/&gt;

==Neuroanatomy==
{{Infobox medical condition |Name=Music Processing and the Brain |Image= |Alt=A diagram showing the different sections of the brain and how they relate to music processing. |Caption=An image depicting the different sections of the brain and specific areas that relate to music processing in particular.}}

===Overview===
Many research studies of individuals with amusia show that a number of cortical regions appear to be involved in processing music. Some report that the [[primary auditory cortex]], secondary auditory cortex, and [[limbic system]] are responsible for this faculty, while more recent studies suggest that lesions in other cortical areas, abnormalities in cortical thickness, and deficiency in neural connectivity and brain plasticity may contribute to amusia. While various causes of amusia exist, some general findings that provide insight to the brain mechanisms involved in music processing are discussed below.&lt;ref name=Neuroanatomy/&gt;

===Pitch relations===
Studies suggest that the analysis of pitch is primarily controlled by the right temporal region of the brain. The right secondary auditory cortex processes pitch change and manipulation of fine tunes; specifically, this region distinguishes the multiple pitches that characterize melodic tunes as [[Pitch contour|contour]] (pitch direction) and interval (frequency ratio between successive notes) information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zatorre R.J., Berlin P. | year = 2001 | title = Spectral and temporal processing in human auditory cortex | url = | journal = Cerebral Cortex | volume = 11 | issue = 10| pages = 946–53 | doi=10.1093/cercor/11.10.946}}&lt;/ref&gt; The right superior temporal gyrus recruits and evaluates contour information, while both right and left temporal regions recruit and evaluate interval information.&lt;ref name=Agnosia&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ayotte J., Peretz I., Rousseau I., Bard C., Bojanowski M. | year = 2000 | title = Patterns of music agnosia associated with middle cerebral artery infarcts | url = | journal = Brain | volume = 123 | issue = 9| pages = 1926–38 | doi=10.1093/brain/123.9.1926 | pmid=10960056}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the right anterolateral part of Heschl's gyrus (primary auditory cortex) is also concerned with processing pitch information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Tramo M., Shah G.D., Braida L.D. | year = 2002 | title = Functional role of auditory cortex in frequency processing and pitch perception | url = | journal = Journal of Neurophysiology | volume = 87 | issue = | pages = 122–39 | doi=10.1152/jn.00104.1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temporal relations===
The brain analyzes the temporal (rhythmic) components of music in two ways: (1) it segments the ongoing sequences of music into temporal events based on duration, and (2) it groups those temporal events to understand the underlying beat to music. Studies on rhythmic discrimination reveal that the right temporal auditory cortex is responsible for temporal segmenting, and the left temporal auditory cortex is responsible for temporal grouping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Di Pietro M., Laganaro M., Leeman B., Schnider A. | year = 2004 | title = Receptive amusia: temporal auditory deficit in a processional musician following a left temporo-parietal lesion | url = | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 42 | issue = 7| pages = 868–977 | doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2003.12.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wilson S.J., Pressing J., Wales R.J. | year = 2002 | title = Modeling rhythmic function in a musician post-stroke | url = | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 40 | issue = 8| pages = 1494–505 | doi=10.1016/s0028-3932(01)00198-1 | pmid=11931954}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies suggest the participation of motor cortical areas in rhythm perception and production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Halsband U., Tanji J. Feund | year = 1993 | title = The role of premotor cortex and the supplementary motor area in the temporal control of movement in man | url = | journal = Brain | volume = 116 | issue = | pages = 243–46 | doi=10.1093/brain/116.1.243}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a lack of involvement and networking between bilateral temporal cortices and neural motor centers may contribute to both congenital and acquired amusia.&lt;ref name= Neuroanatomy/&gt;

===Memory===
Memory is required in order to process and integrate both melodic and rhythmic aspects of music. Studies suggest that there is a rich interconnection between the right temporal gyrus and frontal cortical areas for working memory in music appreciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zatorre R.J., Samson S. | year = 1991 | title = Role of the right temporal neocortex in retention of pitch in auditory short-term memory | url = | journal = Brain | volume = 114 | issue = 6| pages = 2403–17 | doi=10.1093/brain/114.6.2403}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gaab, N., Gaser, C., Zaehle, T., Jancke, L., Schlaug, G. (2003). Functional anatomy of pitch memory-an fMRI study with sparse temoral sampling. NeuroLmage. 19:1417-1426.&lt;/ref&gt; This connection between the temporal and frontal regions of the brain is extremely important since these regions play critical roles in music processing. Changes in the temporal areas of the amusic brain are most likely associated with deficits in pitch perception and other musical characteristics, while changes in the frontal areas are potentially related to deficits in cognitive processing aspects, such as memory, that are needed for musical discrimination tasks.&lt;ref name=Stroke/&gt; Memory is also concerned with the recognition and internal representation of tunes, which help to identify familiar songs and confer the ability to sing tunes in one's head. The activation of the superior temporal region and left inferior temporal and frontal areas is responsible for the recognition of familiar songs,&lt;ref name=Agnosia/&gt; and the right auditory cortex (a perceptual mechanism) is involved in the internal representation of tunes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zatorre R.J., Halpern R. | year = 1993 | title = Effect of unilateral temporal-lobe excision on percention and imagery of songs | url = | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 31 | issue = 3| pages = 221–32 | doi=10.1016/0028-3932(93)90086-f| pmid = 8492875 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings suggest that any abnormalities and/or injuries to these regions of the brain could facilitate amusia.

===Other regions of the brain possibly linked to amusia===
* Lesions (or the absence of) in associations between the right temporal lobe and inferior frontal lobe. In nine of ten tone-deaf people, the superior [[arcuate fasciculus]] in the right hemisphere could not be detected, suggesting a disconnection between the posterior superior temporal gyrus and the posterior inferior frontal gyrus. Researchers suggested the posterior superior temporal gyrus was the origin of the disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Loui | first1 = P. | last2 = Alsop | first2 = D. | last3 = Schlaug | first3 = S. | year = 2009 | title = Tone Deafness: A New Disconnection Syndrome? | journal = Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 29 | issue = 33| pages = 10215–120 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1701-09.2009 | pmid=19692596 | pmc=2747525}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cortical thickness and reduced [[white matter]] – in a recent study, [[voxel-based morphometry]], an imaging technique used to explore structural differences in the brain, revealed a decrease in white matter concentration in the right [[inferior frontal gyrus]] of amusic individuals as compared to controls.&lt;ref name=Morphometry&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hyde K. L., Zatorre R. J., Griffiths T. D., Lerch J. P., Peretz I. | year = 2006 | title = Morphometry of the amusic brain: a two-site study." [Article] | url = | journal = Brain | volume = 129 | issue = 10| pages = 2562–70 | doi=10.1093/brain/awl204}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of extensive exposure to music could be a contributing factor to this white matter reduction.&lt;ref name=Morphometry/&gt; For example, amusic individuals may be less inclined to listen to music than others, which could ultimately cause reduced [[myelination]] of connections to the frontal areas of the brain.&lt;ref name=Morphometry/&gt;
* Involvement of the parahippocampal gyrus (responsible for the emotional reaction to music)&lt;ref name=Neuroanatomy/&gt;

==Discovery==
In 1825, [[Franz Joseph Gall|F. Gall]] mentioned a "musical organ" in a specific region of the human brain that could be spared or disrupted after a traumatic event resulting in brain damage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?typ=fulltext&amp;file=000206851. Alossa, Nicoletta; Castelli, Lorys, "Amusia and Musical Functioning", ''Eur Neurol'', Vol. 61, No. 5, pp. 269–77 (2009)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713135718/http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?typ=fulltext&amp;file=000206851. |date=July 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1865, [[Jean-Baptiste Bouillaud]] described the first series of cases that involved the loss of music abilities that were due to brain injury. Later, during the late nineteenth-century, several influential neurologists studied language in an attempt to construct a [[theory of cognitive development|theory of cognition]]. While not studied as thoroughly as language, music and visual processing were also studied. In 1888–1890, [[August Knoblauch]] produced a cognitive model for music processing and termed it amusia. This model for music processing was the earliest produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0278-2626(02)00527-4 | volume=51 | title=August Knoblauch and amusia: A nineteenth-century cognitive model of music | journal=Brain and Cognition | pages=102–14 | year=2003 | author=Johnson Julene K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case studies==

===First documented case of congenital amusia===
While the possibility that certain individuals may be born with musical deficits is not a new notion, the first documented case of congenital amusia was published relatively recently.&lt;ref name=Fine-grained/&gt; The study was conducted with a female volunteer, referred to as Monica, who declared herself to be musically impaired in response to an advertisement in the newspaper.&lt;ref name=Fine-grained/&gt; Monica had no psychiatric or neurological history, nor did she have any hearing loss. MRI scans showed no abnormalities. Monica also scored above average on a standard intelligence test, and her working memory was evaluated and found to be normal. However, Monica suffers from a lifelong inability to recognize or perceive music, which has persisted even after involvement with music through church choir and band during her childhood and teenage years.&lt;ref name=Fine-grained/&gt; Monica even admits that she does not enjoy listening to music because, to her, it sounds like noise and evokes a stressful response.

In order to determine if Monica's disorder is amusia, she was subjected to the MBEA series of tests. One of the tests dealt with Monica's difficulties in discriminating pitch variations in sequential notes. In this test, a pair of melodies was played, and Monica was asked if the second melody in the pair contained a wrong note.&lt;ref name=Fine-grained/&gt; Monica's score on this test was well below the average score generated by the control group.&lt;ref name=Fine-grained/&gt; Further tests showed that Monica struggles with recognizing highly familiar melodies, but that she has no problems in recognizing the voices of well-known speakers. Thus, it appears that Monica's deficit seems limited to music.&lt;ref name=Fine-grained/&gt; A later study showed that not only do amusics experience difficulty in discriminating variations in pitch, but they also exhibit deficits in perceiving patterns in pitch.&lt;ref name=Tone-deaf&gt;{{cite journal | author = Foxton J. M., Dean J. L., Gee R., Peretz I., Griffiths T. D. | year = 2004 | title = Characterization of deficits in pitch perception underlying 'tone deafness'." [Article] | url = | journal = Brain | volume = 127 | issue = 4| pages = 801–10 | doi=10.1093/brain/awh105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This finding led to another test that was designed to assess the presence of a deficiency in pitch perception.&lt;ref name=Fine-grained/&gt; In this test, Monica heard a sequence of five piano tones of constant pitch followed by a comparison sequence of five piano tones in which the fourth tone could be the same pitch as the other notes in the sequence or a completely different pitch altogether. Monica was asked to respond "yes" if she detected a pitch change on the fourth tone or respond "no" if she could not detect a pitch change.  Results show that Monica could barely detect a pitch change as large as two [[semitone]]s ([[whole tone]]), or half steps.&lt;ref name=Fine-grained/&gt; While this pitch-processing deficit is extremely severe, it does not seem to include speech intonation.&lt;ref name=Fine-grained/&gt; This is because pitch variations in speech are very coarse compared with those used in music.&lt;ref name= Insights/&gt; In conclusion, Monica's learning disability arises from a basic problem in pitch discrimination, which is viewed as the origin of congenital amusia.&lt;ref name=Fine-grained/&gt;

===Family aggregation study===
Another interesting question posed about congenital amusia is if it has a genetic origin.&lt;ref name=Family/&gt; A study was conducted to test for the presence of a genetic origin by studying family aggregation of congenital amusia.&lt;ref name=Family/&gt; Family members of amusics were studied, as well as family members of a control group. The study yielded interesting results. Amusia cannot be attributed solely to family environment due to the presence of at least one unaffected sibling in each tested family in the amusic group.&lt;ref name=Family/&gt; Also, music was found to be present to a lesser extent, but not absent, in the environment of the amusic subjects than in that of the musically intact control group.&lt;ref name=Family/&gt; This supports the claim that the occurrence of congenital amusia cannot be explained by a lack of environmental stimulation. Another interesting finding was that the next generation, or the offspring of those with congenital amusia, was more musical.&lt;ref name=Family/&gt; A reason for this might be that musical stimulation for the offspring probably started early in life when their brains were more plastic.&lt;ref name=Family/&gt;

Overall, test results support the view that congenital amusia is hereditary.&lt;ref name=Family/&gt; It is likely to be influenced by several genes that interact to increase an individual's susceptibility to its development.&lt;ref name=Family/&gt; However, the fact that the offspring have a lower risk of developing congenital amusia shows that it can be less prevalent when the musical environment is enriched.&lt;ref name=Family/&gt; This stresses the importance that experience-dependent tuning has in the musical pitch system.&lt;ref name=Family/&gt;

===Singing in congenital amusia===
While it is known that congenital amusia is a disorder characterized by poor pitch perception, a recent study sought to discover to what extent this pitch deficit may compromise singing.&lt;ref name=Singing&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bella S. D., Giguere J. F., Peretz I. | year = 2009 | title = Singing in congenital amusia | doi = 10.1121/1.3132504 | journal = Journal of the Acoustical Society of America | volume = 126 | issue = 1| pages = 414–24 | bibcode = 2009ASAJ..126..414D }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this study, eleven amusic individuals and eleven controls were asked to sing a familiar song using the lyrics first, and then using the syllable "la". Results showed that individuals with congenital amusia were poor singers.&lt;ref name=Singing/&gt; They could not maintain a stable pitch, nor could they sing the correct pitch intervals that were written in the music. However, many of the amusic testing subjects were able to sing with the correct rhythm.&lt;ref name=Singing/&gt; The results confirmed that the amusics' ability to detect pitch changes influences their level of singing proficiency.&lt;ref name=Singing/&gt; The subjects who struggled the most with pitch perception were the most unstable in producing the correct pitch and made several pitch interval and contour errors. However, there were some remarkable exceptions. A couple of amusic individuals were able to sing proficiently despite extremely impaired pitch perception.&lt;ref name=Singing/&gt;

The results of singing with the lyrics and singing on the syllable "la" can also be compared. Although most of the amusic subjects struggled with maintaining the correct pitch when singing with lyrics, they were able to complete the task. However, when singing the same song on the syllable "la", more than half of the amusic subjects could only sing a few notes.&lt;ref name=Singing/&gt; This is due to a poor memory of the musical component of songs.&lt;ref name=Singing/&gt; Overall, it was concluded that singing deficiency in amusic individuals might be a result of their pitch perception deficit.&lt;ref name=Singing/&gt; However, the existence of amusic individuals who are able to sing proficiently suggests that there may be separate neural pathways for auditory perception and action.&lt;ref name=Singing/&gt;

Amusia has recently been classified as a learning disability that affects musical abilities.&lt;ref name=Congenital&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ayotte Julie, Peretz Isabelle, Hyde Krista | year = 2002 | title = Congenital Amusia | url = | journal = Brain | volume = 125 | issue = 2| pages = 238–51 | doi=10.1093/brain/awf028 | pmid=11844725}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that in congenital amusia, younger subjects can be taught tone differentiation techniques. This finding leads researchers to believe that amusia is related to [[dyslexia]] and other similar disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Peretz Isabelle, Brattico Elvira, Tervaniemi Mari | year = 2002 | title = Abnormal Electrical Brain Responses to Pitch in Congenital Amusia | url = http://www.bio-medicine.org/medicine-news/Brain-Patterns-In-Amusia-May-Be-Related-To-Other-Disorders-4751-1/ | journal = Annals of Neurology | volume = 58 | issue = 3| pages = 478–82| doi = 10.1002/ana.20606 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has been shown that amusia may be related to an increase in size of the [[cerebral cortex]], which may be a result of a malformation in cortical development. Diseases such as dyslexia and [[epilepsy]] are due to a malformation in cortical development and also lead to an increase in cortical thickness, which leads researchers to believe that congenital amusia may be caused by the identical phenomenon in a different area of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hyde Krista, Lerch Jason, Zatorre Robert J | year = 2007| title = Cortical Thickness in Congenital Amusia: When Less Is Better Than More. | url = | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 27 | issue = 47| pages = 13028–32 | doi=10.1523/jneurosci.3039-07.2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amusia is also similar to [[aphasia]] in that they affect similar areas of the [[human brain|brain]] near the [[temporal lobe]]. Most cases of those with amusia do not show any symptoms of aphasia. However, a number of cases have shown that those who have aphasia can exhibit symptoms of amusia, especially in acquired aphasia. The two are not mutually exclusive and having one does not imply possession of the other.&lt;ref name=Congenital/&gt; In acquired amusia, inability to perceive music correlates with an inability to perform other higher-level functions. As musical ability improves, so too do the higher cognitive functions which suggests that musical ability is closely related to these higher-level functions, such as [[memory]] and [[learning]], mental flexibility, and semantic fluency.&lt;ref name=Stroke/&gt;

Amusia can also be related to [[aprosody]], a disorder in which the sufferer's speech is affected, becoming extremely monotonous. It has been found that both amusia and aprosody can arise from seizures occurring in the non-dominant hemisphere.&lt;ref name=aprosody&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bautista R.E., Ciampetti M.Z. | year = 2003 | title = Expressive Aprosody and Amusia as a Manifestation of Right Hemisphere Seizures | url = | journal = Epilepsia | volume = 44 | issue = 3| pages = 466–67 | doi=10.1046/j.1528-1157.2003.36502.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can also both arise from lesions to the brain, as can Broca's aphasia come about simultaneously with amusia from injury.&lt;ref name=aprosody/&gt; There is a relation between musical abilities and the components of speech, however, they are not understood very well.&lt;ref name=aprosody/&gt;

==Social and emotional impact==
Other than their inability to hear music, which is most likely due to a [[genetic disorder|genetic defect]], the rest of an amusic's brain remains normal. The only effect is on the ability to tell different notes apart due to the separation of two key areas in the brain. Most sufferers of amusia describe music as unpleasant. Others simply refer to it as noise and find it annoying. This can have social implications because amusics often try to avoid music, which in many social situations is not an option. In China and other countries in which identical words have different meanings based on pitch, amusia may have a much more pronounced social and emotional impact: difficulty in speaking and understanding the language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gold.ac.uk/media/2005_BBC_Music_Magazine.pdf Stewart, Lauren, "Pitch Fever", BBC Music Magazine, pp. 36–38, (October 2005)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406231451/http://www.gold.ac.uk/media/2005_BBC_Music_Magazine.pdf |date=April 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Currently, no forms of treatment have proven effective in treating amusia. One study has shown tone differentiation techniques to have some success, however future research on treatment of this disorder will be necessary to verify this technique as an appropriate treatment.&lt;ref name=Congenital/&gt;

==Future research==
Over the past decade, much has been discovered about amusia. However, there remains a great deal more to learn. While a method of treatment for people with amusia has not been defined, tone differentiation techniques have been used on amusic patients with some success. It was found with this research that children reacted positively to these tone differentiation techniques, while adults found the training annoying.&lt;ref name=Congenital/&gt; However, further research in this direction would aid in determining if this would be a viable treatment option for people with amusia. Additional research can also serve to indicate which processing component in the brain is essential for normal music development.&lt;ref name=Fine-grained/&gt; Also, it would be extremely beneficial to investigate musical learning in relation to amusia since this could provide valuable insights into other forms of learning disabilities such as [[dysphasia]] and dyslexia.&lt;ref name=Music-specific/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fine-grained/&gt;

[[Image:Newgrange ireland 750px.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The rising [[Sun]] illuminates the inner chamber of [[Newgrange]], [[Ireland]], only at the [[winter solstice]].]]

'''Archaeoastronomy''' (also spelled '''archeoastronomy''') is the study of how people in the past "have understood the [[phenomenon|phenomena]] in the [[sky]], how they used these phenomena and what role the sky played in their [[culture]]s".&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair 2006:13&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clive Ruggles]] argues it is misleading to consider archaeoastronomy to be the study of ancient [[astronomy]], as modern astronomy is a scientific discipline, while archaeoastronomy considers symbolically rich cultural interpretations of phenomena in the sky by other cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles 2005:19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles 1999:155&lt;/ref&gt; It is often twinned with ''ethnoastronomy'', the [[anthropology|anthropological]] study of skywatching in contemporary societies. Archaeoastronomy is also closely associated with [[historical astronomy]], the use of historical records of heavenly events to answer astronomical problems and the [[history of astronomy]], which uses written records to evaluate past astronomical practice.[[File:Equinozio da Pizzo Vento,tramonto fondachelli fantina, sicilia.JPG|thumb| the sunset at the [[equinox]] seen from the prehistoric site of Pizzo Vento at [[Fondachelli-Fantina|Fondachelli Fantina]], [[Sicily]]]]

Archaeoastronomy uses a variety of methods to uncover evidence of past practices including archaeology, anthropology, astronomy, statistics and probability, and history. Because these methods are diverse and use data from such different sources, integrating them into a coherent argument has been a long-term difficulty for archaeoastronomers.&lt;ref&gt;Iwaniszewski 2003, 7-10&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeoastronomy fills complementary niches in [[landscape archaeology]] and [[cognitive archaeology]]. Material evidence and its connection to the sky can reveal how a wider landscape can be integrated into [[Paganism|beliefs about the cycles of nature]], such as [[Maya civilization#Astronomy|Mayan astronomy]] and its relationship with agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Aveni 1980&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples which have brought together ideas of cognition and landscape include studies of the cosmic order embedded in the roads of settlements.&lt;ref&gt;Chiu &amp; Morrison 1980&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Magli 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeoastronomy can be applied to all cultures and all time periods. The meanings of the sky vary from culture to culture; nevertheless there are scientific methods which can be applied across cultures when examining ancient beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;McCluskey 2005&lt;/ref&gt; It is perhaps the need to balance the social and scientific aspects of archaeoastronomy which led Clive Ruggles to describe it as: ''"...[A] field with academic work of high quality at one end but uncontrolled speculation bordering on lunacy at the other"''.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{quote|In his short history of 'Astro-archaeology' John Michell argued that the status of research into ancient astronomy had improved over the past two centuries, going 'from lunacy to heresy to interesting notion and finally to the gates of orthodoxy.' Nearly two decades later, we can still ask the question: Is archaeoastronomy still waiting at the gates of orthodoxy or has it gotten inside the gates?|Todd Bostwick quoting John Michell&lt;ref&gt;Bostwick 2006:13&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Two hundred years before Michell wrote the above, there were no archaeoastronomers and there were no [[Archaeology#History of archaeology|professional archaeologists]], but there were astronomers and [[Antiquarianism|antiquarians]]. Some of their works are considered precursors of archaeoastronomy; antiquarians interpreted the astronomical orientation of the ruins that dotted the English countryside as [[William Stukeley]] did of [[Stonehenge]] in 1740,&lt;ref&gt;Michell, 2001:9-10&lt;/ref&gt; while [[John Aubrey]] in 1678&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, 1912:225&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Henry Chauncy]] in 1700 sought similar astronomical principles underlying the orientation of churches.&lt;ref&gt;Hoskin, 2001:7&lt;/ref&gt;  Late in the nineteenth century astronomers such as [[Richard Proctor]] and [[Charles Piazzi Smyth]] investigated the astronomical orientations of [[Egyptian pyramids|the pyramids]].&lt;ref&gt;Michell, 2001:17-18&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''archaeoastronomy'' was first used by Elizabeth Chesley Baity (at the suggestion of Euan MacKie) in 1973,&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair 2006:17&lt;/ref&gt; but as a topic of study it may be much older, depending on how archaeoastronomy is defined. Clive Ruggles&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles 2005:312-3&lt;/ref&gt; says that [[Heinrich Nissen]], working in the mid-nineteenth century was arguably the first archaeoastronomer. Rolf Sinclair&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair 2006:8&lt;/ref&gt; says that [[Norman Lockyer]], working in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, could be called the 'father of archaeoastronomy'. Euan MacKie&lt;ref&gt;Mackie 2006:243&lt;/ref&gt; would place the origin even later, stating: "...the genesis and modern flowering of archaeoastronomy must surely lie in the work of [[Alexander Thom]] in Britain between the 1930s and the 1970s".

[[Image:Auglish.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Early archaeoastronomers surveyed Megalithic constructs in the British Isles, at sites like [[Auglish]] in [[County Londonderry]], in an attempt to find statistical patterns.]]
In the 1960s the work of the engineer Alexander Thom and that of the astronomer [[Gerald Hawkins]], who proposed that [[Stonehenge]] was a [[Neolithic]] computer,&lt;ref&gt;Hawkins 1976&lt;/ref&gt; inspired new interest in the astronomical features of ancient sites. The claims of Hawkins were largely dismissed,&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson 1966&lt;/ref&gt; but this was not the case for Alexander Thom's work, whose survey results of [[megalith]]ic sites hypothesized widespread practice of accurate astronomy in the British Isles.&lt;ref&gt;Thom 1988:9-10&lt;/ref&gt;  Euan MacKie, recognizing that Thom's theories needed to be tested, excavated at the Kintraw standing stone site in Argyllshire in 1970 and 1971 to check whether the latter's prediction of an observation platform on the hill slope above the stone was correct. There was an artificial platform there and this apparent verification of Thom's long alignment hypothesis (Kintraw was diagnosed as an accurate [[winter solstice]] site) led him to check Thom's geometrical theories at the Cultoon [[stone circle]] in Islay, also with a positive result. MacKie therefore broadly accepted Thom's conclusions and published new prehistories of Britain.&lt;ref name = "zkuawc"&gt;MacKie 1977&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast a re-evaluation of Thom's fieldwork by Clive Ruggles argued that Thom's claims of high accuracy astronomy were not fully supported by the evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Gingerich 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Thom's legacy remains strong, Krupp&lt;ref&gt;Krupp 1979:18&lt;/ref&gt; wrote in 1979, "Almost singlehandedly he has established the standards for archaeo-astronomical fieldwork and interpretation, and his amazing results have stirred controversy during the last three decades." His influence endures and practice of statistical testing of data remains one of the methods of archaeoastronomy.&lt;ref&gt;Hicks 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Iwaniszewski 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Uxmal01-panorama.jpg|thumb|left|250px|It has been proposed that [[Maya civilization|Maya]] sites such as [[Uxmal]] were built in accordance with astronomical alignments.]]The approach in the [[New World]], where anthropologists began to consider more fully the role of astronomy in [[Amerindian]] civilizations, was markedly different. They had access to sources that the [[prehistory]] of Europe lacks such as [[ethnography|ethnographies]]&lt;ref&gt;Zeilik 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zeilik 1986&lt;/ref&gt; and the historical records of the early [[Colonization of the Americas|colonizers]]. Following the pioneering example of Anthony Aveni,&lt;ref&gt;Milbraith 1999:8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Broda 2000:233&lt;/ref&gt; this allowed New World archaeoastronomers to make claims for motives which in the Old World would have been mere speculation. The concentration on historical data led to some claims of high accuracy that were comparatively weak when compared to the statistically led investigations in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Hoskin 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

This came to a head at a meeting sponsored by the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) in [[Oxford]] in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles 1993:ix&lt;/ref&gt; The methodologies and research questions of the participants were considered so different that the conference proceedings were published as two volumes.&lt;ref&gt;Aveni 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heggie 1982&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the conference was considered a success in bringing researchers together and Oxford conferences have continued every four or five years at locations around the world. The subsequent conferences have resulted in a move to more interdisciplinary approaches with researchers aiming to combine the contextuality of archaeological research,&lt;ref&gt;Aveni, 1989a:xi–xiii&lt;/ref&gt; which broadly describes the state of archaeoastronomy today, rather than merely establishing the existence of ancient astronomies, archaeoastronomers seek to explain why people would have an interest in the night sky.

== Relations to other disciplines ==
{{quote|...[O]ne of the most endearing characteristics of archaeoastronomy is its capacity to set academics in different disciplines at loggerheads with each other.|Clive Ruggles&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles 2000&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Archaeoastronomy has long been seen as an interdisciplinary field that uses written and unwritten evidence to study the astronomies of other cultures.  As such, it can be seen as connecting other disciplinary approaches for investigating ancient astronomy: astroarchaeology (an obsolete term for studies that draw astronomical information from the alignments of ancient architecture and landscapes), [[history of astronomy]] (which deals primarily with the written textual evidence), and ethnoastronomy (which draws on the ethnohistorical record and contemporary ethnographic studies).&lt;ref&gt;Aveni 1981: 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aveni 2003: 150&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflecting Archaeoastronomy's development as an interdisciplinary subject, research in the field is conducted by investigators trained in a wide range of disciplines. Authors of recent doctoral dissertations have described their work as concerned with the fields of archaeology and cultural anthropology; with various fields of history including the history of specific regions and periods, the history of science and the history of religion; and with the relation of astronomy to art, literature and religion. Only rarely did they describe their work as astronomical, and then only as a secondary category.&lt;ref&gt;McCluskey 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Both practicing archaeoastronomers and observers of the discipline approach it from different perspectives. George Gummerman and Miranda Warburton view archaeoastronomy as part of an archaeology informed by [[cultural anthropology]] and aimed at understanding a "group's conception of themselves in relation to the heavens', in a word, its cosmology.&lt;ref&gt;Gummerman &amp; Warburton 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  Todd Bostwick argued that "archaeoastronomy is anthropology – the study of human behavior in the past and present."&lt;ref&gt;Bostwick 2006:3&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Paul Bahn]] has described archaeoastronomy as an area of cognitive archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;Bahn 1996:49&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers relate archaeoastronomy to the history of science, either as it relates to a culture's observations of nature and the conceptual framework they devised to impose an order on those observations&lt;ref&gt;McCluskey 2001&lt;/ref&gt; or as it relates to the political motives which drove particular historical actors to deploy certain astronomical concepts or techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Broda 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aldana 2007:14-15&lt;/ref&gt;  Art historian Richard Poss took a more flexible approach, maintaining that the astronomical rock art of the North American Southwest should be read employing "the hermeneutic traditions of western art history and art criticism"&lt;ref&gt;Poss 2005:97&lt;/ref&gt; Astronomers, however, raise different questions, seeking to provide their students with identifiable [[Precursorism|precursors]] of their discipline, and are especially concerned with the important question of how to confirm that specific sites are, indeed, intentionally astronomical.&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer 2006a:30&lt;/ref&gt;

The reactions of professional archaeologists to archaeoastronomy have been decidedly mixed. Some expressed incomprehension or even hostility, varying from a rejection by the archaeological mainstream of what they saw as an archaeoastronomical fringe to an incomprehension between the cultural focus of archaeologists and the quantitative focus of early archaeoastronomers.&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles 1999: 3-9&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet archaeologists have increasingly come to incorporate many of the insights from archaeoastronomy into archaeology textbooks&lt;ref&gt;Fisher 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and, as mentioned above, some students wrote archaeology dissertations on archaeoastronomical topics.

Since archaeoastronomers disagree so widely on the characterization of the discipline, they even dispute its name. All three major international scholarly associations relate archaeoastronomy to the study of culture, using the term ''Astronomy in Culture'' or a translation. Michael Hoskin sees an important part of the discipline as fact-collecting, rather than theorizing, and proposed to label this aspect of the discipline ''Archaeotopography.''&lt;ref&gt;Hoskin 2001:13-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Ruggles and Saunders proposed ''Cultural Astronomy'' as a unifying term for the various methods of studying folk astronomies.&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles &amp; Saunders 1993:1-31&lt;/ref&gt; Others have argued that astronomy is an inaccurate term, what are being studied are [[cosmology|cosmologies]] and people who object to the use of [[logos]] have suggested adopting the Spanish ''cosmovisión''.&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles 2005:115-117&lt;/ref&gt;

When debates polarise between techniques, the methods are often referred to by a colour code, based on the colours of the bindings of the two volumes from the first Oxford Conference, where the approaches were first distinguished.&lt;ref name = "jgswke"&gt;Aveni 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Green ([[Old World]]) archaeoastronomers rely heavily on statistics and are sometimes accused of missing the cultural context of what is a social practice. Brown ([[New World]]) archaeoastronomers in contrast have abundant ethnographic and historical evidence and have been described as 'cavalier' on matters of measurement and statistical analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Hoskin 2001:2&lt;/ref&gt; Finding a way to integrate various approaches has been a subject of much discussion since the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles &amp; Saunders. 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Iwaniszewski 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodology ==
{{quote|For a long time I have believed that such diversity requires the invention of some all-embracing theory. I think I was very naïve in thinking that such a thing was ever possible.|Stanislaw Iwaniszewski&lt;ref&gt;Iwaniszewski 2003:7&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There is no one way to do Archaeoastronomy. The divisions between archaeoastronomers tend not to be between the physical scientists and the social scientists. Instead it tends to depend on the location of kind of data available to the researcher. In the Old World, there is little data but the sites themselves; in the New World, the sites were supplemented by ethnographic and historic data. The effects of the isolated development of archaeoastronomy in different places can still often be seen in research today. Research methods can be classified as falling into one of two approaches, though more recent projects often use techniques from both categories.

===Green archaeoastronomy===

Green Archaeoastronomy is named after the cover of the book ''Archaeoastronomy in the Old World''.&lt;ref&gt;Aveni 1989:1&lt;/ref&gt; It is based primarily on statistics and is particularly apt for prehistoric sites where the social evidence is relatively scant compared to the historic period. The basic methods were developed by Alexander Thom during his extensive surveys of British megalithic sites.

Thom wished to examine whether or not prehistoric peoples used high-accuracy astronomy. He believed that by using horizon astronomy, observers could make estimates of dates in the year to a specific day. The observation required finding a place where on a specific date the sun set into a notch on the horizon. A common theme is a mountain which blocked the Sun, but on the right day would allow the tiniest fraction to re-emerge on the other side for a '[[double sunset]]'. The animation below shows two sunsets at a [[hypothetical]] site, one the day before the [[summer solstice]] and one at the summer solstice, which has a double sunset.

&lt;center&gt;[[File:Doublesunset.ogg]]&lt;/center&gt;

To test this idea he surveyed hundreds of stone rows and circles. Any individual alignment could indicate a direction by chance, but he planned to show that together the distribution of alignments was non-random, showing that there was an astronomical intent to the orientation of at least some of the alignments. His results indicated the existence of eight, sixteen, or perhaps even thirty-two approximately equal divisions of the year. The two [[solstice]]s, the two [[equinox]]es and four [[cross-quarter day]]s, days half-way between a solstice and the equinox were associated with the medieval Celtic calendar.&lt;ref&gt;Thom 1967: 107-117&lt;/ref&gt; While not all these conclusions have been accepted, it has had an enduring influence on archaeoastronomy, especially in Europe.

Euan MacKie has supported Thom's analysis, to which he added an archaeological context by comparing [[Neolithic Britain]] to the [[Mayan civilization]] to argue for a stratified society in this period.&lt;ref name = "zkuawc"/&gt; To test his ideas he conducted a couple of excavations at proposed prehistoric observatories in Scotland. [[Kintraw]] is a site notable for its four-meter high standing stone. Thom proposed that this was a foresight to a point on the distant horizon between Beinn Shianaidh and Beinn o'Chaolias on [[Jura, Scotland|Jura]].&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles 1999:25-29&lt;/ref&gt; This, Thom argued, was a notch on the horizon where a double sunset would occur at midwinter. However, from ground level, this sunset would be obscured by a ridge in the landscape, and the viewer would need to be raised by two meters: another observation platform was needed. This was identified across a gorge where a platform was formed from small stones. The lack of artifacts caused concern for some archaeologists and the petrofabric analysis was inconclusive, but further research at [[Maes Howe]]&lt;ref name="MacKie 1997"&gt;MacKie 1997&lt;/ref&gt; and on the [[Bush Barrow]] Lozenge&lt;ref&gt;MacKie 2006:362&lt;/ref&gt; led MacKie to conclude that while the term 'science' may be anachronistic, Thom was broadly correct upon the subject of high-accuracy alignments.&lt;ref&gt;MacKie 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast [[Clive Ruggles]] has argued that there are problems with the selection of data in Thom's surveys.&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles 1999:19-29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles and Barclay 2000: 69-70&lt;/ref&gt; Others have noted that the accuracy of horizon astronomy is limited by variations in [[Atmospheric refraction|refraction]] near the horizon.&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer and Liller 1990&lt;/ref&gt; A deeper criticism of Green archaeoastronomy is that while it can answer ''whether'' there was likely to be an interest in astronomy in past times, its lack of a social element means that it struggles to answer ''why'' people would be interested, which makes it of limited use to people asking questions about the society of the past. Keith Kintigh wrote: "To put it bluntly, in many cases it doesn't matter much to the progress of anthropology whether a particular archaeoastronomical claim is right or wrong because the information doesn’t inform the current interpretive questions."&lt;ref&gt;Kintigh 1992&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless the study of alignments remains a staple of archaeoastronomical research, especially in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Hoskin 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brown archaeoastronomy ===

In contrast to the largely alignment-oriented statistically led methods of Green archaeoastronomy, Brown archaeoastronomy has been identified as being closer to the [[history of astronomy]] or to [[cultural history]], insofar as it draws on historical and ethnographic records to enrich its understanding of early astronomies and their relations to calendars and ritual.&lt;ref name = "jgswke"/&gt; The many records of native customs and beliefs made by the Spanish chroniclers means that Brown archaeoastronomy is most often associated with studies of astronomy in the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;Aveni 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

One famous site where historical records have been used to interpret sites is [[Chichen Itza]]. Rather than analysing the site and seeing which targets appear popular, archaeoastronomers have instead examined the ethnographic records to see what features of the sky were important to the [[Maya civilization|Maya]]ns and then sought archaeological correlates. One example which could have been overlooked without historical records is the Mayan interest in the planet [[Venus]]. This interest is attested to by the [[Dresden codex]] which contains tables with information about the Venus's appearances in the sky.&lt;ref name = "mlxqkn"&gt;Kelley and Milone 2005:369-370&lt;/ref&gt; These cycles would have been of astrological and ritual significance as Venus was associated with [[Quetzalcoatl]] or [[Xolotl]].&lt;ref&gt;Kelley and Milone 2005:367-8&lt;/ref&gt; Associations of architectural features with settings of Venus can be found in Chichen Itza, Uxmal, and probably some other Mesoamerican sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=La estrella de Quetzalcóatl: El planeta Venus en Mesoamérica|last=Šprajc|first=Ivan|publisher=Editorial Diana|year=1996|isbn=978-968-13-2947-1|location=Mexico City|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Chichen Itza Observatory 2 1.jpg|left|thumb|200px|"El Caracol" a possible observatory temple at Chichen Itza.]]The Temple of the Warriors bears iconography depicting feathered serpents associated with Quetzalcoatl or Kukulcan. This means that the building's alignment towards the place on the horizon where Venus first appears in the evening sky (when it coincides with the rainy season) may be meaningful.&lt;ref&gt;Milbraith 1988:70-71&lt;/ref&gt; However, since both the date and the azimuth of this event change continuously, a solar interpretation of this orientation is much more likely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sánchez Nava|first1=Pedro Francisco|last2=Šprajc|first2=Ivan|title=Orientaciones astronómicas en la arquitectura maya de las tierras bajas|date=2015|publisher=Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia|location=Mexico City|isbn=978-607-484-727-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aveni claims that another building associated with the planet Venus in the form of Kukulcan, and the rainy season at Chichen Itza is the [[Caracol]].&lt;ref&gt;Aveni 2006:60-64&lt;/ref&gt; This is a building with circular tower and doors facing the cardinal directions. The base faces the most northerly setting of Venus. Additionally the pillars of a stylobate on the building's upper platform were painted black and red. These are colours associated with Venus as an evening and morning star.&lt;ref&gt;Aveni 1979:175-183&lt;/ref&gt; However the windows in the tower seem to have been little more than slots, making them poor at letting light in, but providing a suitable place to view out.&lt;ref&gt;Aveni 1997:137-138&lt;/ref&gt;

Aveni states that one of the strengths of the Brown methodology is that it can explore astronomies invisible to statistical analysis and offers the astronomy of the [[Inca]]s as another example. The empire of the Incas was conceptually divided using ''ceques'' radial routes emanating from the capital at [[Cusco]]. Thus there are alignments in all directions which would suggest there is little of astronomical significance, However, ethnohistorical records show that the various directions do have cosmological and astronomical significance with various points in the landscape being significant at different times of the year.&lt;ref&gt;Aveni 1989:5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bauer and Dearborn 1995&lt;/ref&gt; In eastern Asia archaeoastronomy has developed from the History of Astronomy and much archaeoastronomy is searching for material correlates of the historical record. This is due to the rich historical record of astronomical phenomena which, in China, stretches back into the [[Han dynasty]], in the second century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Xu ''et al.'' 2000:1-7&lt;/ref&gt;

A criticism of this method is that it can be statistically weak. Schaefer in particular has questioned how robust the claimed alignments in the Caracol are.&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer 2006a:42-48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer 2006b&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the wide variety of evidence, which can include artefacts as well as sites, there is no one way to practice archaeoastronomy.&lt;ref&gt;Iwaniszewski 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this it is accepted that archaeoastronomy is not a discipline that sits in isolation. Because archaeoastronomy is an interdisciplinary field, whatever is being investigated should make sense both archaeologically and astronomically. Studies are more likely to be considered sound if they use theoretical tools found in archaeology like [[analogy]] and [[homology (anthropology)|homology]] and if they can demonstrate an understanding of accuracy and precision found in astronomy. Both quantitative analyses and interpretations based on ethnographic analogies and other contextual evidence have recently been applied in systematic studies of architectural orientations in the Maya area&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=González-García|first1=A. César|last2=Šprajc|first2=Ivan|title=Astronomical significance of architectural orientations in the Maya Lowlands: A statistical approach|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports|date=2016|volume=9|pages=191–202|doi=10.1016/j.jasrep.2016.07.020}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in other parts of Mesoamerica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Šprajc|first1=Ivan|title=Astronomy, Architecture, and Landscape in Prehispanic Mesoamerica|journal=Journal of Archaeological Research|volume=26|issue=2|pages=197–251|date=2017|doi=10.1007/s10814-017-9109-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Source materials ==

Because archaeoastronomy is about the many and various ways people interacted with the sky, there are a diverse range of sources giving information about astronomical practices.

===Alignments===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[History of astronomy]] --&gt;

A common source of data for archaeoastronomy is the study of alignments. This is based on the assumption that the axis of alignment of an archaeological site is meaningfully oriented towards an astronomical target. Brown archaeoastronomers may justify this assumption through reading historical or ethnographic sources, while Green archaeoastronomers tend to prove that alignments are unlikely to be selected by chance, usually by demonstrating common patterns of alignment at multiple sites.

An alignment is calculated by measuring the [[azimuth]], the angle from north, of the structure and the altitude of the horizon it faces&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles, 2005:112-113&lt;/ref&gt; The azimuth is usually measured using a [[theodolite]] or a [[compass]]. A compass is easier to use, though the deviation of the Earth's magnetic field from true north, known as its [[magnetic declination]] must be taken into account. Compasses are also unreliable in areas prone to magnetic interference, such as sites being supported by scaffolding. Additionally a compass can only measure the azimuth to a precision of a half a degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brunton.com/manuals/current/Compasses/Transit.pdf |format=PDF|title=Brunton Pocket Transit Instruction Manual|page=22|accessdate=2008-03-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060304060347/http://www.brunton.com/manuals/current/Compasses/Transit.pdf |archivedate=2006-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A theodolite can be considerably more accurate if used correctly, but it is also considerably more difficult to use correctly. There is no inherent way to align a theodolite with North and so the scale has to be [[calibration|calibrated]] using astronomical observation, usually the position of the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles 2005:423-425&lt;/ref&gt; Because the position of celestial bodies changes with the time of day due to the Earth's rotation, the time of these calibration observations must be accurately known, or else there will be a systematic error in the measurements. Horizon altitudes can be measured with a theodolite or a [[clinometer]].

=== Artifacts ===

[[Image:NAMA Machine d'Anticythère 1.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The Antikythera mechanism (main fragment)]]For artifacts such as the [[Nebra skydisk|Sky Disc of Nebra]], alleged to be a Bronze Age artefact depicting the cosmos,&lt;ref&gt;Scholsser 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meller 2004&lt;/ref&gt; the analysis would be similar to typical [[Archaeology#Post-excavation analysis|post-excavation analysis]] as used in other sub-disciplines in archaeology. An artefact is examined and attempts are made to draw analogies with historical or ethnographical records of other peoples. The more parallels that can be found, the more likely an explanation is to be accepted by other archaeologists.

A more mundane example is the presence of [[astrological symbol]]s found on some shoes and sandals from the Roman Empire. The use of shoes and sandals is well known, but Carol van Driel-Murray has proposed that astrological symbols etched onto sandals gave the footwear spiritual or medicinal meanings.&lt;ref&gt;van Driel-Murray 2002&lt;/ref&gt; This is supported through citation of other known uses of astrological symbols and their connection to medical practice and with the historical records of the time.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Another well-known artefact with an astronomical use is the [[Antikythera mechanism]]. In this case analysis of the artefact, and reference to the description of similar devices described by Cicero, would indicate a plausible use for the device. The argument is bolstered by the presence of symbols on the mechanism, allowing the disc to be read.&lt;ref&gt;T. Freeth ''et al.'' 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Art and inscriptions ===

[[Image:Fajadadiagram.JPG|thumb|250px|left|Diagram showing the location of the sun daggers on the [[Fajada Butte]] petroglyph on various days]]Art and inscriptions may not be confined to artefacts, but also appear painted or inscribed on an archaeological site. Sometimes inscriptions are helpful enough to give instructions to a site's use. For example, a Greek inscription on a stele (from [[Itanos (city)|Itanos]]) has been translated as:"Patron set this up for Zeus Epopsios. Winter solstice. Should anyone wish to know: off ‘the little pig’ and the stele the sun turns."&lt;ref&gt;Inscriptiones Creticae III iv 11; Isager and Skydsgaard 1992:163&lt;/ref&gt; From Mesoamerica come [[Maya codices|Mayan]] and [[Aztec codices]]. These are folding books made from [[Amatl]], processed tree bark on which are [[glyph]]s in [[Maya script|Mayan]] or [[Aztec script]]. The [[Dresden codex]] contains information regarding the Venus cycle, confirming its importance to the Mayans.&lt;ref name = "mlxqkn"/&gt;

More problematic are those cases where the movement of the Sun at different times and seasons causes light and shadow interactions with [[petroglyph]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Williamson 1987:109-114&lt;/ref&gt; A widely known example is the Sun Dagger of [[Fajada Butte]] at which a glint of sunlight passes over a spiral petroglyph.&lt;ref&gt;Sofaer 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The location of a dagger of light on the petroglyph varies throughout the year. At the summer solstice a dagger can be seen through the heart of the spiral; at the winter solstice two daggers appear to either side of it. It is proposed that this petroglyph was created to mark these events. Recent studies have identified many similar sites in the US Southwest and Northwestern Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Fountain 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robins &amp; Ewing 1989&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that the number of solstitial markers at these sites provides statistical evidence that they were intended to mark the solstices.&lt;ref&gt;Preston &amp; Preston 2005: 115-118&lt;/ref&gt; The Sun Dagger site on Fajada Butte in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico, stands out for its explicit light markings that record all the key events of both the solar and lunar cycles: summer solstice, winter solstice, equinox, and the major and minor [[lunar standstill]]s of the moon's 18.6 year cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Science Mag, Sofaer et al. 1979: 126&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cambridge"&gt;Cambridge U, 1982 sofaer et al.: 126&lt;/ref&gt; In addition at two other sites on Fajada Butte, there are five light markings on petroglyphs recording the summer and winter solstices, equinox and solar noon.&lt;ref&gt;Sofaer and Sinclair: 1987. UNM, ABQ&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous buildings and interbuilding alignments of the great houses of Chaco Canyon and outlying areas are oriented to the same solar and lunar directions that are marked at the Sun Dagger site.&lt;ref&gt;Sofaer 1998: Lekson Ed, u of utah: 165&lt;/ref&gt;

If no ethnographic nor historical data are found which can support this assertion then acceptance of the idea relies upon whether or not there are enough petroglyph sites in North America that such a correlation could occur by chance. It is helpful when petroglyphs are associated with existing peoples. This allows ethnoastronomers to question informants as to the meaning of such symbols.

=== Ethnographies ===

As well as the materials left by peoples themselves, there are also the reports of other who have encountered them. The historical records of the [[Conquistadores]] are a rich source of information about the pre-Columbian Americans. [[Ethnography|Ethnographers]] also provide material about many other peoples.

Aveni uses the importance of zenith passages as an example of the importance of ethnography. For peoples living between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn there are two days of the year when the noon Sun passes directly overhead and casts no shadow. In parts of Mesoamerica this was considered a significant day as it would herald the arrival of rains, and so play a part in the cycle of agriculture. This knowledge is still considered important amongst Mayan Indians living in Central America today. The ethnographic records suggested to archaeoastronomers that this day may have been important to the ancient Mayans. There are also shafts known as 'zenith tubes' which illuminate subterranean rooms when the sun passes overhead found at places like [[Monte Albán]]  and [[Xochicalco]]. It is only through the ethnography that we can speculate that the timing of the illumination was considered important in Mayan society.&lt;ref&gt;Aveni 1980:40-43&lt;/ref&gt; Alignments to the sunrise and sunset on the day of the zenith passage have been claimed to exist at several sites. However, it has been shown that, since there are very few orientations that can be related to these phenomena, they likely have different explanations.&lt;ref&gt;Šprajc and Sánchez 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnographies also caution against over-interpretation of sites. At a site in [[Chaco Canyon]] can be found a [[pictograph]] with a star, crescent and hand. It has been argued by some astronomers that this is a record of the [[SN 1054|1054 Supernova]].&lt;ref&gt;Brandt and Williamson 1979&lt;/ref&gt; However recent reexaminations of related 'supernova petroglyphs' raises questions about such sites in general&lt;ref&gt;Krupp. et al. 2010: 42&lt;/ref&gt; and anthropological evidence suggests other inrepretations. The [[Zuni people]], who claim a strong ancestral affiliation with Chaco, marked their sun-watching station with a crescent, star, hand and sundisc, similar to those found at the Chaco site.&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles 2005:89&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnoastronomy is also an important field outside of the Americas. For example, anthropological work with Aboriginal Australians is producing much information about their [[Aboriginal astronomy|Indigenous astronomies]]&lt;ref&gt;Cairns 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hamacher 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and about their interaction with the modern world.&lt;ref&gt;Saethre 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recreating the ancient sky ==
{{quote|...[A]lthough different ways to do science and different scientific results do arise in different cultures, this provides little support for those who would use such differences to question the sciences' ability to provide reliable statements about the world in which we live.|Stephen McCluskey&lt;ref&gt;McCluskey 2005:78&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Once the researcher has data to test, it is often necessary to attempt to recreate ancient sky conditions to place the data in its historical environment.

=== Declination ===
{{Main|Declination}}

To calculate what astronomical features a structure faced a coordinate system is needed. The stars provide such a system. If you were to go outside on a clear night you would observe the stars spinning around the celestial pole. This point is +90° if you are watching the North Celestial Pole or −90° if you are observing the Southern Celestial Pole.&lt;ref name = "byuqqi"&gt;Ruggles 1999:18&lt;/ref&gt; The concentric circles the stars trace out are lines of celestial latitude, known as ''declination''. The arc connecting the points on the horizon due East and due West (if the horizon is flat) and all points midway between the Celestial Poles is the Celestial Equator which has a declination of 0°. The visible declinations vary depending where you are on the globe. Only an observer on the North Pole of Earth would be unable to see any stars from the Southern Celestial Hemisphere at night (see diagram below). Once a declination has been found for the point on the horizon that a building faces it is then possible to say whether a specific body can be seen in that direction.

{{clear}}

[[Image:Decdiag600.jpg|center|thumb|600px|Diagram of the visible portions of sky at varying latitudes.]]

{{clear}}

=== Solar positioning ===

While the stars are fixed to their declinations the Sun is not. The rising point of the Sun varies throughout the year. It swings between two limits marked by the solstices a bit like a [[pendulum]], slowing as it reaches the extremes, but passing rapidly through the midpoint. If an archaeoastronomer can calculate from the azimuth and horizon height that a site was built to view a declination of +23.5° then he or she need not wait until 21 June to confirm the site does indeed face the summer solstice.&lt;ref&gt;A.F. Aveni 1997:23-27&lt;/ref&gt; For more information see [[History of solar observation]].

=== Lunar positioning ===

The Moon's appearance is considerably more complex. Its motion, like the Sun, is between two limits — known as [[Lunar standstill|''luni''stices]] rather than ''sol''stices. However, its travel between lunistices is considerably faster. It takes a [[Sidereal month#Sidereal month|sidereal month]] to complete its cycle rather than the year-long trek of the Sun. This is further complicated as the lunistices marking the limits of the Moon's movement move on [[Lunar standstill|an 18.6 year cycle]]. For slightly over nine years the extreme limits of the moon are outside the range of sunrise. For the remaining half of the cycle the Moon never exceeds the limits of the range of sunrise. However, much lunar observation was concerned with the ''[[Lunar phase|phase]]'' of the Moon. The cycle from one [[New Moon]] to the next runs on an entirely different cycle, the [[Synodic month]].&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles 1999:36-37&lt;/ref&gt; Thus when examining sites for lunar significance the data can appear sparse due the extremely variable nature of the moon. See [[Moon]] for more details.

=== Stellar positioning ===
{{Main|Precession of the equinoxes}}

[[Image:Earth precession.jpg|thumb|right|Precessional movement.]]Finally there is often a need to correct for the apparent movement of the stars. On the timescale of human civilisation the stars have largely maintained the same position relative to each other. Each night they appear to rotate around the celestial poles due to the Earth's rotation about its axis. However, the Earth spins rather like a [[spinning top]]. Not only does the Earth rotate, it wobbles. The Earth's axis takes around 25,800 years to complete one full wobble.&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles 2005:345-347&lt;/ref&gt; The effect to the archaeoastronomer is that stars did not rise over the horizon in the past in the same places as they do today. Nor did the stars rotate around [[Polaris]] as they do now. In the case of the [[Egyptian pyramids]], it has been shown they were aligned towards [[Thuban]], a faint star in the constellation of [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]].&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles 2005:354-355&lt;/ref&gt; The effect can be substantial over relatively short lengths of time, historically speaking. For instance a person born on 25 December in Roman times would have been born with the sun in the constellation [[Capricornus|Capricorn]]. In the modern period a person born on the same date would have the sun in [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]] due to the [[precession of the equinoxes]].

=== Transient phenomena ===

[[Image:Bayeux Tapestry scene32 Halley comet.jpg|thumb|left|Halley's Comet depicted on the [[Bayeux tapestry]]]]Additionally there are often transient phenomena, events which do not happen on an annual cycle. Most predictable are events like [[eclipse]]s. In the case of [[solar eclipse]]s these can be used to date events in the past. A solar eclipse mentioned by [[Herodotus]] enables us to date a battle between the [[Medes]] and the [[Lydia]]ns, which following the eclipse failed to happen, to 28 May, 585 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Herodotus|authorlink=Herodotus|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Hdt.+1.74.1|title=The Histories I.74|accessdate=2008-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other easily calculated events are [[supernova]]e whose remains are visible to astronomers and therefore their positions and magnitude can be accurately calculated.

Some [[comet]]s are predictable, most famously [[Halley's Comet]]. Yet as a class of object they remain unpredictable and can appear at any time. Some have extremely lengthy [[orbital period]]s which means their past appearances and returns cannot be predicted. Others may have only ever passed through the [[Solar System]] once and so are inherently unpredictable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.space.com/spacewatch/050701_bright_comets.html Predicting the next bright comet], Space.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Meteor shower]]s should be predictable, but some [[meteor]]s are cometary debris and so require calculations of orbits which are currently impossible to complete.&lt;ref&gt;Steel 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Other events noted by ancients include [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurorae]], [[sun dog]]s and [[rainbow]]s all of which are as impossible to predict as the ancient weather, but nevertheless may have been considered important phenomena.

=== The use of calendars ===

A common justification for the need for astronomy is the need to develop an accurate [[calendar]] for [[agriculture|agricultural]] reasons. Ancient texts like [[Hesiod]]'s Works and Days, an ancient farming manual, would appear to contradict this. Instead astronomical observations are used in combination with [[ecology|ecological]] signs, such as [[bird migration]]s to determine the seasons. Ethnoastronomical work with the [[Mursi people|Mursi]] of [[Ethiopia]] shows that haphazard astronomy continued until recent times in some parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Turton &amp; Ruggles 1978&lt;/ref&gt; All the same, calendars appear to be an almost universal phenomenon in societies as they provide tools for the regulation of communal activities.

An example of a non-agricultural calendar is the ''[[Tzolk'in]]'' calendar of the [[Maya civilization]] of [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]], which is a cycle of 260 days. This count is based on an [[260-day Mesoamerican calendar|earlier calendar and is found throughout Mesoamerica]]. This formed part of a more comprehensive system of [[Maya calendar]]s which combined a series of astronomical observations and ritual cycles.&lt;ref&gt;Aveni 1989b&lt;/ref&gt;

Other peculiar calendars include ancient [[Hellenic calendar|Greek calendars]]. These were nominally [[Lunar calendar|lunar]], starting with the [[New Moon]]. In reality the calendar could pause or skip days with confused citizens inscribing dates by both the civic calendar and ''ton theoi'', by the [[moon]].&lt;ref&gt;McCluskey 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of any universal calendar for ancient Greece suggests that coordination of panhellenic events such as [[Panhellenic Games|games]] or rituals could be difficult and that astronomical symbolism may have been used as a politically neutral form of timekeeping.&lt;ref&gt;Salt &amp; Boutsikas 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Orientation measurements in Greek temples and Byzantine churches have been associated to deity's name day, festivities, and special events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Liritzis | first1 = I | last2 = Vassiliou | first2 = H | date = 2002 | title = Astronomical orientations of ancient temples at Rhodes and Attica with a tentative interpretation | journal = Mediterranean Archaeology &amp; Archaeometry | volume = 2 | issue = 1| pages = 69–79 | bibcode = 2002MAA.....2...69L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Liritzis.I and Vassiliou.H (2006) Were Greek temples oriented towards aurora?

A preliminary study. ''Byzantinische Zeitscrift'' (K.G.Saur Munchen, Leipzig) 99, 2, 523-534&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Myth and cosmology ===

[[Image:Argo Navis Hevelius.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The constellation [[Argo Navis]] drawn by Johannes Hevelius in 1690.]]Another motive for studying the sky is to understand and explain the [[universe]]. In these cultures [[mythology|myth]] was a tool for achieving this and the explanations, while not reflecting the standards of modern [[science]], are [[cosmology|cosmologies]].

The [[Inca]]s arranged their empire to demonstrate their cosmology. The capital, [[Cusco]], was at the centre of the empire and connected to it by means of ceques, conceptually straight lines radiating out from the centre.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer &amp; Dearborn 1995&lt;/ref&gt; These ceques connected the centre of the empire to the four ''suyus'', which were regions defined by their direction from Cusco. The notion of a quartered cosmos is common across the [[Andes]]. Gary Urton, who has conducted fieldwork in the Andean villagers of Misminay, has connected this quartering with the appearance of the [[Milky Way]] in the night sky.&lt;ref&gt;Urton 1981&lt;/ref&gt; In one season it will bisect the sky and in another bisect it in a [[perpendicular]] fashion.

The importance of observing cosmological factors is also seen on the other side of the world. The [[Forbidden City]] in [[Beijing]] is laid out to follow cosmic order though rather than observing four directions. The Chinese system was composed of five directions: [[North]], [[South]], [[East]], [[West]] and [[Centre (geometry)|Centre]]. The Forbidden City occupied the centre of ancient Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;Krupp 1997a:196–9&lt;/ref&gt; One approaches the Emperor from the south, thus placing him in front of the [[Circumpolar constellation|circumpolar stars]]. This creates the situation of the heavens revolving around the person of the Emperor. The Chinese cosmology is now better known through its export as [[feng shui]].

There is also much information about how the universe was thought to work stored in the mythology of the [[constellation]]s. The Barasana of the [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazon]] plan part of their annual cycle based on observation of the stars. When their constellation of the Caterpillar-Jaguar (roughly equivalent to the modern Scorpius) falls they prepare to catch the pupating caterpillars of the forest as they fall from the trees.&lt;ref&gt;Hoskin 1999:15–6&lt;/ref&gt; The caterpillars provide food at a season when other foods are scarce.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh-Jones 1982:191-3&lt;/ref&gt;

A more well-known source of constellation myth are the texts of the Greeks and Romans. The origin of their constellations remains a matter of vigorous and occasionally fractious debate.&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blomberg 2003, esp page 76&lt;/ref&gt;

The loss of one of the sisters, Merope, in some Greek myths may reflect an astronomical event wherein one of the stars in the Pleiades disappeared from view by the naked eye.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pleiade.org/pleiades_02.html ''The Pleiades in mythology''], Pleiade Associates, Bristol, United Kingdom, accessed June 7, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Giorgio de Santillana]], professor of the History of Science in the School of Humanities at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], along with Hertha von Dechend believed that the old mythological stories handed down from antiquity were not random fictitious tales but were accurate depictions of celestial [[cosmology]] clothed in tales to aid their oral transmission. The chaos, monsters and violence in ancient myths are representative of the forces that shape each age. They believed that ancient myths are the remains of preliterate [[astronomy]] that became lost with the rise of the Greco-Roman civilization. Santillana and von Dechend in their book ''Hamlet's Mill, An Essay on Myth and the Frame of Time'' (1969) clearly state that ancient myths have no historical or factual basis other than a cosmological one encoding astronomical phenomena, especially the [[precession of the equinoxes]].&lt;ref&gt;Giorgio de Santillana &amp; Hertha von Dechend, ''Hamlet's Mill'', David R Godine: Boston, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; Santillana and von Dechend's approach is not widely accepted.

=== Displays of power ===

[[Image:1st Pylon Karnak Temple.JPG|thumbnail|250px|left|The [[Precinct of Amun-Re]] was aligned on the midwinter solstice.]]

By including celestial motifs in clothing it becomes possible for the wearer to make claims the power on Earth is drawn from above. It has been said that the Shield of [[Achilles]] described by [[Homer]] is also a catalogue of constellations.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah 1994&lt;/ref&gt; In North America shields depicted in [[Comanche]] [[petroglyph]]s appear to include Venus symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;Krupp 1997a:252–3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Solstice|Solsticial]] alignments also can be seen as displays of power. When viewed from a ceremonial plaza on the [[Isla del Sol|Island of the Sun]] (the mythical origin place of the Sun) in [[Lake Titicaca]], the Sun was seen to rise at the June solstice between two towers on a nearby ridge. The sacred part of the island was separated from the remainder of it by a stone wall and ethnographic records indicate that access to the sacred space was restricted to members of the [[Inca]] ruling elite. Ordinary [[Pilgrimage|pilgrims]] stood on a platform outside the ceremonial area to see the solstice Sun rise between the towers.&lt;ref&gt;Dearborn, Seddon &amp; Bauer, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

In Egypt the temple of [[Amun-Re]] at [[Karnak]] has been the subject of much study. Evaluation of the site, taking into account the change over time of the [[obliquity of the ecliptic]] show that the Great Temple was aligned on the rising of the midwinter sun.&lt;ref&gt;Krupp 1988&lt;/ref&gt; The length of the corridor down which sunlight would travel would have limited illumination at other times of the year.

In a later period the [[Serapeum]] in [[Alexandria]] was also said to have contained a [[Sun|solar]] alignment so that, on a specific sunrise, a shaft of light would pass across the lips of the statue of [[Serapis]] thus symbolising the [[Sun]] saluting the god.&lt;ref&gt;Rufinus&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Newgrange ===
[[Image:Newgrange Eingang Stein.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The sunlight enters the tomb at Newgrange via the roofbox built above the door.]]

{{Main|Newgrange}}

Newgrange is a passage tomb in the Republic of Ireland dating from around 3,300 to 2,900 BC&lt;ref&gt;Eogan 1991&lt;/ref&gt; For a few days around the Winter Solstice light shines along the central passageway into the heart of the tomb. What makes this notable is not that light shines in the passageway, but that it does not do so through the main entrance. Instead it enters via a hollow box above the main doorway discovered by Michael O'Kelly.&lt;ref&gt;O'Kelly 1982:123-124&lt;/ref&gt; It is this roofbox which strongly indicates that the tomb was built with an astronomical aspect in mind. Clive Ruggles notes:{{blockquote|...[F]ew people - archaeologists or astronomers- have doubted that a powerful astronomical symbolism was deliberately incorporated into the monument, demonstrating that a connection between astronomy and funerary ritual, at the very least, merits further investigation.&lt;ref name = "byuqqi"/&gt;}}

=== Egypt ===
[[Image:All Gizah Pyramids.jpg|thumb|left|The pyramids of [[Giza]]]]

{{Main|Giza Necropolis}}

Since the first modern measurements of the precise cardinal orientations of the pyramids by [[Flinders Petrie]], various astronomical methods have been proposed for the original establishment of these orientations.&lt;ref&gt;Belmonte 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neugebauer 1980&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Magli 2013&lt;/ref&gt; It was recently proposed that this was done by observing the positions of two stars in [[Ursa Major|the Plough / Big Dipper]] which was known to Egyptians as the thigh. It is thought that a vertical alignment between these two stars checked with a [[plumb bob]] was used to ascertain where north lay. The deviations from true north using this model reflect the accepted dates of construction.&lt;ref&gt;Spence 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Senenmout-constellations.jpg|thumb|Constellations on the astronomical ceiling of [[Senemut]] Tomb]]

Some have argued that the pyramids were laid out as [[Orion correlation theory|a map of the three stars]] in the belt of Orion,&lt;ref&gt;Hancock 1996:168&lt;/ref&gt; although this theory has been criticized by reputable astronomers.&lt;ref name="Fairall"&gt;Fairall 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Krupp"&gt;Krupp 1997b&lt;/ref&gt; The site was instead probably governed by a spectacular hierophany which occurs at the summer solstice, when the sun, viewed from the Sphinx terrace, forms - together with the two giant pyramids - the symbol Akhet, which was also the name of the Great Pyramid. Further, the south east corners of all the 3 pyramids align towards the temple of Heliopolis, as first discovered by the Egyptologist Mark Lehner.

The [[Astronomical ceiling of Senemut Tomb|astronomical ceiling of the tomb of Senenmut]] ({{c.|1470}}{{nbsp}}BC) contains the Celestial Diagram depicting circumpolar constellations in the form of discs. Each disc is divided into 24 sections suggesting a 24-hour time period. Constellations are portrayed as sacred deities of Egypt. The observation of lunar cycles is also evident.

=== El Castillo ===
{{Main|El Castillo, Chichen Itza}}

El Castillo, also known as Kukulcán's Pyramid, is a [[Mesoamerican pyramids|Mesoamerican step-pyramid]] built in the centre of [[Maya civilization|Maya]]n center of [[Chichen Itza]] in Mexico. Several architectural features have suggested astronomical elements. Each of the stairways built into the sides of the pyramid has 91 steps. Along with the extra one for the platform at the top, this totals 365 steps, which is possibly one for each day of the year (365.25) or the number of lunar orbits in 10,000 rotations (365.01).

[[Image:Serpent head at the base of El Castillo.jpg|left|thumb|Plumed Serpent]]
A visually striking effect is seen every March and September as an unusual shadow occurs around the equinoxes. A shadow appears to descend the west balustrade of the northern stairway. The visual effect is of a serpent descending the stairway, with its head at the base in light. Additionally the western face points to sunset around 25 May, traditionally the date of transition from the dry to the rainy season.&lt;ref&gt;Krupp 1997a:267-269&lt;/ref&gt; The intended alignment was, however, likely incorporated in the northern (main) facade of the temple, as it corresponds to sunsets on May 20 and July 24, recorded also by the central axis of Castillo at Tulum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Šprajc |first1=Ivan |last2=Sánchez Nava |first2=Pedro Francisco |title=Astronomía en la arquitectura de Chichén Itzá: una reevaluación |journal=Estudios de Cultura Maya |date=2013 |volume=XLI |pages=31–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two dates are separated by 65 and 300 days, and it has been shown that the solar orientations in Mesoamerica regularly correspond to dates separated by calendrically significant intervals (multiples of 13 and 20 days).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Šprajc|first1=I.|title=Astronomy, Architecture, and Landscape in Prehispanic Mesoamerica|journal=Journal of Archaeological Research|volume=26|issue=2|pages=197–251|date=2018|doi=10.1007/s10814-017-9109-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stonehenge ===
[[Image:Summer Solstice Sunrise over Stonehenge 2005.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The sun rising over [[Stonehenge]] at the 2005 Summer [[Solstice]].]]

{{Main|Archaeoastronomy and Stonehenge}}

Many astronomical alignments have been claimed for Stonehenge, a complex of [[megalith]]s and [[Earthworks (archaeology)|earthwork]]s in the [[Salisbury Plain]] of England. The most famous of these is the midsummer alignment, where the Sun rises over the Heel Stone. However, this interpretation has been challenged by some archaeologists who argue that the midwinter alignment, where the viewer is outside Stonehenge and sees the sun setting in the henge, is the more significant alignment, and the midsummer alignment may be a coincidence due to local topography.&lt;ref&gt;Parker Pearson ''et al.'' 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as solar alignments, there are proposed lunar alignments. The four station stones mark out a rectangle. The short sides point towards the midsummer sunrise and midwinter sunset. The long sides if viewed towards the south-east, face the most southerly rising of the moon. Aveni notes that these lunar alignments have never gained the acceptance that the solar alignments have received.&lt;ref&gt;Aveni 1997:65-66&lt;/ref&gt; The Heel Stone azimuth is one-seventh of circumference, matching the latitude of Avebury, while summer solstice sunrise azimuth is no longer equal to the construction era direction.{{citation needed | reason=Source for claim was a personal website; citation was removed, and should be replaced with a reliable source. | date=March 2014}}

=== Maeshowe ===
[[Image:PicMaesEntrance.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The interior of [[Maeshowe]] chambered tomb.]]

{{Main|Maeshowe}}

This is an architecturally outstanding Neolithic chambered tomb on the Mainland of [[Orkney]], [[Scotland]] – probably dating to the early 3rd millennium BC, and where the setting sun at midwinter shines down the entrance passage into the central chamber (see Newgrange). In the 1990s further investigations were carried out to discover whether this was an accurate or an approximate solar alignment. Several new aspects of the site were discovered. In the first place the entrance passage faces the hills of the island [[Hoy]], about 10 miles away. Secondly, it consists of two straight lengths, angled at a few degrees to each other. Thirdly, the outer part is aligned towards the midwinter sunset position on a level horizon just to the left of Ward Hill on Hoy.  Fourthly the inner part points directly at the Barnhouse standing stone about 400m away and then to the right end of the summit of Ward Hill, just before it dips down to the notch between it at Cuilags to the right. This indicated line points to  sunset on the first Sixteenths of the solar year (according to A. Thom) before and after the winter solstice and the notch at the base of the right slope of the Hill is at the same declination. Fourthly a similar 'double sunset' phenomenon is seen at the right end of Cuilags, also on Hoy; here the date is the first Eighth of the year before and after the winter solstice, at the beginning of November and February respectively – the Old Celtic festivals of [[Samhain]] and [[Imbolc]]. This alignment is not indicated by an artificial structure but gains plausibility from the other two indicated lines.   Maeshowe is thus an extremely sophisticated calendar site which must have been positioned carefully in order to use the horizon foresights in the ways described.&lt;ref name="MacKie 1997"/&gt;

=== Uxmal ===
[[Image:Uxmal-Palace-of-the-Governor.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Palace of the Governor at Uxmal.]]

{{Main|Uxmal}}

Uxmal is a Mayan city in the Puuc Hills of [[Yucatán Peninsula]], Mexico. The Governor's Palace at Uxmal is often used as an exemplar of why it is important to combine ethnographic and alignment data. The palace is aligned with an [[azimuth]] of 118° on the pyramid of Cehtzuc. This alignment corresponds approximately to the southernmost rising and, with a much greater precision, to the northernmost setting of Venus; both phenomena occur once every eight years. By itself this would not be sufficient to argue for a meaningful connection between the two events. The palace has to be aligned in one direction or another and why should the rising of Venus be any more important than the rising of the Sun, Moon, other planets, Sirius ''et cetera''? The answer given is that not only does the palace point towards significant points of Venus, it is also covered in [[glyph]]s which stand for Venus and Mayan zodiacal constellations.&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles 2005:163-165&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the great northerly extremes of Venus always occur in late April or early May, coinciding with the onset of the rainy season. The Venus glyphs placed in the cheeks of the Maya rain god Chac, most likely referring to the concomitance of these phenomena, support the west-working orientation scheme.&lt;ref&gt;Šprajc 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chaco Canyon ===
[[Image:Chaco Canyon Chetro Ketl great kiva plaza NPS.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Great Kiva at Chaco Canyon.]]

In Chaco Canyon, the center of the ancient Pueblo culture in the American Southwest, numerous solar and lunar light markings and architectural and road alignments have been documented. These findings date to the 1977 discovery of the Sun Dagger site by Anna Sofaer.&lt;ref&gt;Science Magazine, Sofaer et al., 1979: 126&lt;/ref&gt; Three large stone slabs leaning against a cliff channel light and shadow markings onto two spiral petroglyphs on the cliff wall, marking the solstices, equinoxes and the lunar standstills of the 18.6 year cycle of the moon.&lt;ref name="Cambridge" /&gt; Subsequent  research by the Solstice Project and others demonstrated  that numerous building and interbuilding alignments of the great houses of Chaco Canyon are oriented to solar, lunar and cardinal directions.&lt;ref&gt;Malville and Putnam, 1989. Johnson Books:111&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sofaer 1998. Lekson Ed, U of Utah: 165.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, research shows that the Great North Road, a thirty-five mile engineered “road”, was constructed  not for utilitarian purposes but rather to connect the ceremonial center of Chaco Canyon with the direction north.&lt;ref&gt;Sofaer, Marshall and Sinclair, 1989. Cambridge: 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lascaux Cave ===
[[File:Lascaux 01.jpg| thumb | According to Rappenglueck, the eyes of the bull, the bird, and the bird-man may represent the three stars Vega, Altair, and Deneb commonly known as the [[Summer Triangle]]. ]]
In recent years, new research has suggested that the [[Lascaux]] cave paintings in France may incorporate prehistoric star charts. Michael Rappenglueck of the [[University of Munich]] argues that some of the non-figurative dot clusters and dots within some of the figurative images correlate with the constellations of [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]], the [[Pleiades]] and the grouping known as the "[[Summer Triangle]]".&lt;ref name=bbcnews_starmap&gt;{{cite web|last=Whitehouse|first=David|title=Ice Age star map discovered|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/871930.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=30 December 2012|date=9 August 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on her own study of the astronomical significance of Bronze Age [[petroglyphs]] in the [[Vallée des Merveilles]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vallée des Merveilles |publisher=Archeociel |url=http://www.archeociel.com/nouvelle.htm |language=French |accessdate=1 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218140644/http://www.archeociel.com/nouvelle.htm |archivedate=2010-12-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and her extensive survey of other prehistoric cave painting sites in the region—most of which appear to have been selected because the interiors are illuminated by the setting sun on the day of the [[winter solstice]]—French researcher Chantal Jègues-Wolkiewiez has further proposed that the gallery of figurative images in the Great Hall represents an extensive star map and that key points on major figures in the group correspond to stars in the main [[constellation]]s as they appeared in the Paleolithic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archeociel: Chantal Jègues Wolkiewiez|url= http://www.archeociel.com|language=French|accessdate=1 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Lascaux cave: a Prehistoric sky-map...|url=http://issuu.com/lightmediation/docs/the_lascaux_cave___a_prehistoric_sky-map_3390?mode=embed&amp;documentId=080926150256-7f1d39d0e87c4e28a7515a2712d1e473&amp;layout=grey|publisher=lightmeditation&lt;!-- this is a blog --&gt;|accessdate=1 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Note that these interpretations rose skepticism among the scientific community &lt;ref&gt;Neyret, F.

Appliying phylogenetics to myths of the Cosmic Hunt, Julien d'Huy suggested that the palaeolithic version of this story could be the following:  there is an animal that is a horned herbivore, especially an elk. One human pursues this ungulate. The hunt locates or gets to the sky. The animal is alive when it is transformed into a constellation. It forms the Big Dipper.

Archaeoastronomy owes something of this poor reputation among scholars to its occasional misuse to advance a range of [[Pseudohistory|pseudo-historical]] accounts. During the 1930s, Otto S. Reuter compiled a study entitled ''Germanische Himmelskunde'', or "Teutonic Skylore". The astronomical orientations of ancient monuments claimed by Reuter and his followers would place the ancient Germanic peoples ahead of the [[Ancient Near East]] in the field of astronomy, demonstrating the intellectual superiority of the "[[Aryan race|Aryans]]" (Indo-Europeans) over the [[Semitic people|Semites]].&lt;ref&gt;Pedersen 1982:269&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 19th century, numerous scholars have sought to use [[Archaeoastronomy and Vedic chronology|archaeoastronomical calculations]] to demonstrate the antiquity of Ancient Indian Vedic culture, computing the dates of astronomical observations ambiguously described in ancient poetry to as early as 4000 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Witzel 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  [[David Pingree]], a historian of Indian astronomy, condemned "the scholars who perpetrate wild theories of prehistoric science and call themselves archaeoastronomers."&lt;ref&gt;Pingree 1982:554-563, esp. p. 556&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently Gallagher,&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher 1983&lt;/ref&gt; Pyle,&lt;ref&gt;Pyle 1983&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Barry Fell|Fell]]&lt;ref&gt;Fell 1983&lt;/ref&gt; interpreted inscriptions in West Virginia as a description in Celtic [[Ogham]] alphabet of the supposed winter solstitial marker at the site. The controversial translation was supposedly validated by a problematic archaeoastronomical indication in which the winter solstice sun shone on an inscription of the sun at the site. Subsequent analyses criticized its cultural inappropriateness, as well as its linguistic and archeaoastronomical&lt;ref&gt;Wise 2003&lt;/ref&gt; claims, to describe it as an example of "[[Pseudoarchaeology|cult archaeology]]".&lt;ref&gt;Lesser, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeoastronomy is sometimes related to the fringe discipline of [[Archaeocryptography]], when its followers attempt to find underlying mathematical orders beneath the proportions, size, and placement of archaeoastronomical sites such as Stonehenge and the Pyramid of Kukulcán at Chichen Itza.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Schmeh | first = Klaus| title = The Pathology of Cryptology—A Current Survey | journal = Cryptologia | volume= 36 | date = 2012 | pages = 14–45 | doi = 10.1080/01611194.2011.632803 | postscript = , at pp. 19-20.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Archaeoastronomical organisations and publications ==

There are currently three academic organisations for scholars of archaeoastronomy. [http://www.archaeoastronomy.org/ ISAAC&amp;mdash;the International Society for Archaeoastronomy and Astronomy in Culture]&amp;mdash;was founded in 1995 and now sponsors the Oxford conferences and ''Archaeoastronomy — the Journal of Astronomy in Culture''. [http://www.archeoastronomy.org/ SEAC&amp;mdash; La Société Européenne pour l’Astronomie dans la Culture]&amp;mdash;is slightly older; it was created in 1992. SEAC holds annual conferences in Europe and publishes refereed conference proceedings on an annual basis. There is also [https://web.archive.org/web/20070927043749/http://www.arqueoastronomia.org/siac.htm SIAC&amp;mdash; La Sociedad Interamericana de Astronomía en la Cultura], primarily a [[Latin America]]n organisation which was founded in 2003. Two new organisations focused on regional archaeoastronomy were founded in 2013: [http://members.ozemail.com.au/~mmichie/bulletin_oct13.pdf ASIA - the Australian Society for Indigenous Astronomy] in Australia and [http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/SC1306/S00043/modern-uses-for-ancient-maori-knowledge.htm SMART - the Society of Māori Astronomy Research and Traditions] in New Zealand.

Additionally the ''[[Journal for the History of Astronomy]]'' publishes many archaeoastronomical papers. For twenty-seven volumes (from 1979 to 2002) it published an annual supplement ''Archaeoastronomy''.  The ''[[Journal of Astronomical History and Heritage]]'' (National Astronomical Research Institute of Thailand), ''Culture &amp; Cosmos'' (University of Wales, UK) and ''Mediterranean Archaeology and Archaeometry'' (University of Aegean, Greece) also publish papers on archaeoastronomy.

Various national archaeoastronomical projects have been undertaken. Among them is the program at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research named "[http://www.tifr.res.in/~archaeo/ Archaeo Astronomy in Indian Context]" that has made interesting findings in this field.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/first-indian-record-of-supernova-found-in-kashmir/article2221426.ece&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Aspen Center for Physics''' is a non-profit Center for research in Physics based in [[Aspen, Colorado]], [[United States]].&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|last=Overbye|first=Dennis|title=In Aspen, Physics on a High Plane|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/28/science/in-aspen-physics-on-a-high-plane.html?src=pm|accessdate=1 January 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 28, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center organizes workshops and conferences to facilitate interactions among research physicists.&lt;ref name=aboutus&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.aspenphys.org/aboutus/index.html|publisher=Aspen Center for Physics|accessdate=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center was founded in 1962 by [[Purdue University]] postdoctoral fellow George Stranahan (later known for owning-operating the Flying Dog [[cattle ranch]] and co-founding the [[Flying Dog Brewery]]), [[University of Pennsylvania]] professor Michael Cohen and [[Aspen Institute]] director Robert W. Craig. While working on his doctoral dissertation at the [[Carnegie Institute of Technology]] in 1957, Stranahan first moved to Aspen, where he enjoyed the mountainous surroundings and fishing. In the aftermath of this experience, he was motivated to establish the center as a retreat for physicists.&lt;ref name=aspen-times&gt;{{cite news|last=Agar|first=Charles|title=Physics (and a little fishin')|url=http://www.aspentimes.com/article/20070527/NEWS/105270044|accessdate=1 January 2013|newspaper=Aspen Times|date=May 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Program==
During the Summer Program, late–May through mid–September, the Center provides individual researchers and small working groups with double offices and campus activities for over 500 leading scientists. Ten to thirteen informal workshops of two– to five–weeks in the areas of biophysics, astrophysics and cosmology, particle physics, and condensed matter physics are also scheduled, but the most important aspect of attendance is the cross–fertilization of ideas that spontaneously arises during one–on–one conversations and across fields. &lt;ref name=public&gt;{{cite web|title=Aspen Physics Turns 50|url=http://aspenphys.org/public/publicimages/nature2012.pdf|publisher=Nature|accessdate=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;Participants include post–doctoral fellows, professors, researchers and experimentalists. More than fifty of the Nobel Prize recipients in physics have participated in Aspen.  &lt;ref name=science&gt;{{cite web|title=Science for Science's Sake|url=http://aspenphys.org/public/publicimages/2012july8aspendailynews.html|publisher=Aspen Daily News|accessdate=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Housing expenses are partially underwritten by the National Science Foundation. Families often accompany participants.

The Winter Conferences in January, February and March consist of specific and intensive week long conferences. Each week, fifty to a hundred participants meet daily for talks at the Center, share a block of hotel rooms and eat meals together, totally immersing in the subject of study.

==Outreach==
The Center offers free public lectures during both summer and winter sessions, bringing cutting–edge research to the interested non–scientist.  With the Aspen Science Center, the Aspen Center for Physics also hosts summer barbecues for local and visiting youth who come with their families to picnic and hear an entertaining and informative physics talk. The Physics Cafe held before the winter lectures offers students and adults an opportunity to talk informally with physicists. &lt;ref name=outreach&gt;{{cite web|title=Get Smart|url=http://aspenphys.org/public/publicimages/2013_01_25aspentimes.pdf|publisher=The Aspen Times|accessdate=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Center also hosts conversational dialogues, conducts interviews on local access television (Grassrootstv.org “Physics Preview”) and radio (″Radio Physics″ with high school students on KDNK), offers opportunities for high school physics students to engage with participants, and provides a science resource for schools and youth organizations. &lt;ref name=informing&gt;{{cite web|title=Informing the Public|url=http://www.aspenphys.org/public/index.html|publisher=Aspen Center for Physics|accessdate=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15716">'''Attachment theory and psychology of religion''' research explores the ways that a belief in [[God]] can fulfill the criteria of an attachment figure and examines how individual differences in attachment lead to correspondence or compensation pathways.

==Introduction to attachment theory==
[[Attachment theory]] began with evolutionary psychologist [[John Bowlby]] in 1969.  Attachment theory was initially grounded in the observation that human beings appear to be born with an innate psychobiological system (the "attachment behavioral system") that motivates them to seek proximity to significant others (''attachment figures'').&lt;ref name="Granqvist. Mikulincer, Shaver"&gt;Granqvist, P., Mikulincer, M. &amp; Shaver, P. R. (2010). Religion as attachment: Normative processes and individual differences. ''Personality and Social Psychology Review'', 14. doi: 10.1177/1088868309348618&lt;/ref&gt;  This revolutionary theory has found application in topics such as friendships, romantic relationships, coping with stress, loneliness and grief.&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick"&gt;Kirkpatrick, L. A., (2005). Attachment, evolution, and the psychology of religion. New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bowlby described an attachment system as an evolved behavioral system in humans and other primates, which was designed by natural selection to maintain proximity between people and their attachment figures.  He postulated that the attachment system is in line with control systems theory, a goal-corrected, or homeostatic system.  The system monitors proximity to the primary caregiver, friends,&lt;ref&gt;ATTACHMENT AS A PREDICTOR OF FRIENDSHIP OUALITIES IN COLLEGE YOUTH by JOCELYN A. SAFERSTEIN, ''SOCIAL BEHAVIOR AND PERSONALITY'', 2005, 33(8), 767-776&lt;/ref&gt; pets,&lt;ref&gt;Pets as safe havens and secure bases: The moderating role of pet attachment orientations, Sigal Zilcha-Manoor, ''Journal of Research in Personality'', 2012&lt;/ref&gt; romantic partners and compares it to the desired level of proximity.  If the attachment figure is regarded as unavailable or not near enough, attachment behaviors are activated and deactivated when attachment figure becomes sufficient.&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick"/&gt;

On the “flip side” of attachment is the exploration system.  When the exploration system is activated, the attachment system is deactivated.  While the attachment system keeps the primary caregiver, adult romantic partner, pets or friends in close proximity, the exploration system allows for acquiring and practicing new skills while exploring the environment.&lt;ref name="Granqvist. Mikulincer, Shaver"/&gt;  These two functions are crucial in defining and distinguishing attachment relationships from other types of [[interpersonal relationships]].  Insecurely attached individuals either defensively minimize closeness seeking behaviors or maximize behaviors to become closer to attachment figure.&lt;ref name="Granqvist. Mikulincer, Shaver"/&gt;  These two behaviors can be conceptualized as avoidant attachment (the extent to which a person distrusts attachment figure and strives to maintain behavioral independence and emotional distance) and anxious attachment (the degree to which a person worries that an attachment figure will not be available partly because the anxiously attached person doubts his or her own lovability and value).&lt;ref name="Granqvist. Mikulincer, Shaver"/&gt;

==God as an attachment figure==
[[Psychoanalysis]] has a long history of conceptualizing religious belief in terms of relationship between the self and others.&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick"/&gt;  A religious believer's perception that they have a relationship with a deity or God leaves open the question of whether such a relationship is an attachment relation. It is easy to draw analogies between beliefs about God and mental models of attachment figures, but it is a difficult distinction to make that God "really" can be an attachment figure.&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick"/&gt;   In addition, research has shown that adult attachments and attachment to God are fundamentally distinct phenomenon, for instance Simon and Low (2003).&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of Psychology and Theology'', 2010: Adult Attachment, God, Attachment and Gender in Relation to Perceived Stress by Sarah R. Reiner&lt;/ref&gt; Kirkpatrick suggests that for many people in many religions, the attachment system is fundamentally involved in their thinking, beliefs, and reasoning about God and their relationship to God.  According to this theory our knowledge of how attachment processes work in non-religious relationships should prove useful in understanding the ways in which people see God and interact with God.&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick"/&gt;

===Seeking and maintaining proximity to God===

One biological function of the attachment system, according to Bowlby,&lt;ref name="Bowlby"&gt;Bowlby, J. (1969/1982). ''Attachment and Loss'': Vol. 1. ''Attachment''. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; is to maintain proximity between a person and an attachment figure.  Religions provide many ways that believers can maintain closeness to God.  Most theistic traditions describe God as being omnipresent, that is, is all places at all times, and while this is a key aspect of religion that creates closeness to God it is not the only way.  Virtually all religions have a place or building in which believers come to worship and be closer to their deity or God.  Within these places of worship, as well as outside of them, there is an array of idols and symbols; such as artwork, jewelry, and images of crosses that serve to remind believers of God’s closeness.&lt;ref name="Granqvist &amp; Kirkpatrick"&gt;Granqvist, P. &amp; Kirkpatrick, L. A. (2008). Attachment and religious representations and behavior. In J. Cassidy, P. R. Shaver, J. Cassidy, P. R. Shaver (eds.), ''Handbook of attachment: Theory, research, and clinical applications'' (2nd ed.) (pp. 906–933). New York, NY US: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Granqvist and Kirkpatrick suggest that [[prayer]] is the most important way that believers maintain proximity to God.&lt;ref name="Granqvist &amp; Kirkpatrick"/&gt;

===God as haven of safety===

Another function of the attachment system, according to Bowlby,&lt;ref name="Bowlby"/&gt; is the attachment figure serving as a haven of safety in times of danger or threat. Bowlby&lt;ref name="Bowlby"/&gt; also described three situations that activate the attachment behaviors: (1) frightening or alarming environmental events; (2)illness, injury or fatigue; and (3) separation or threat of separation from attachment figure.&lt;ref name="Granqvist &amp; Kirkpatrick"/&gt;

===God as secure base===

A “secure base” provides security for exploration in one’s environment.&lt;ref name="Granqvist &amp; Kirkpatrick"/&gt; By most definitions God is omnipresent, omnipotent, and omniscient.  Bowlby&lt;ref name="Bowlby"/&gt; described a secure base and its psychological effects as  this, “When an individual is confident that an attachment figure will be available to him whenever he desires it, that person will be much less prone to either intense or chronic fear than will an individual who for any reason has no such confidence.”  It is easy to see how God would be the most secure of secure bases.&lt;ref name="Granqvist &amp; Kirkpatrick"/&gt;

In religious scripture God is often described as by one’s side, one’s rock and fortress, one’s strength, and many other terms that reflect an [[attachment theory|attachment relationship]].  Research done by Myers (1992), as mentioned by Granqvist and Kirkpatrick,&lt;ref name="Granqvist &amp; Kirkpatrick"/&gt; on the psychological outcomes associated with “attachment to God” (such as religious faith giving believers a sense of optimism and hope for the future) suggest that at least some forms of religiousness are associated with the kind of confident, self-assured approach to life that a secure base is thought to provide.

===Responses to separation and loss===

Ainsworth (1985), as mentioned by Granqvist and Kirkpatrick,&lt;ref name="Granqvist &amp; Kirkpatrick"/&gt; outlines the fourth and fifth defining criteria of attachment as concern responses to separation from, or loss of, the attachment figure per se: The threat of separation causes anxiety in the attached person, and loss of the attachment figure causes grief.  Because of God’s perceived omnipresence, it is difficult to determine whether God meets these criteria.  A believer does not lose a relationship with God as he or she loses a human relationship.  There are instances in religious life when believers are unable to experience God as they did at some point in their life.  It is important to note that in most Christian belief systems, separation from God is the very essence of hell.&lt;ref name="Granqvist &amp; Kirkpatrick"/&gt;

===Perceiving God as stronger and wiser===

Bowlby&lt;ref name="Bowlby"/&gt; further described an “attachment relationship” as a weaker, less competent individual having another individual that he or she perceives as stronger and wiser, but this is now known to be wrong, as research has identified that  adult attachments include friendships, romantic relationships and even pets&lt;ref&gt;Pets as safe havens and secure bases: The moderating role of pet attachment orientations by Sigal Zilcha-Mano, ''Journal of Research into Personality'', 2012&lt;/ref&gt; in which the reciprocal partner, be it human or non-human, is not necessarily perceived as stronger or wiser.

==Individual differences==

Individual differences in attachment security often affect the output of the attachment system in human relationships.  In the same way, they often modify the effects of attachment processes in the context of believers’ perceived relationships with God.&lt;ref name="Granqvist. Mikulincer, Shaver"/&gt;  Two general hypotheses have been suggested and are seen as describing two distinct developmental pathways in religion—the compensation hypothesis and the correspondence hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Granqvist &amp; Kirkpatrick"/&gt;

===Compensation pathway===

The compensation pathway is related to the regulation of distress following experiences with insensitive caregivers.  This situation describes a negative answer to the question of whether an attachment figure is sufficiently near, attentive, responsive, and approving.&lt;ref name="Granqvist. Mikulincer, Shaver"/&gt;  According to the [[attachment theory]] this situation activates attachment behaviors to restore an adequate degree of proximity, but under certain condition the individual may anticipate that their efforts are unlikely to be successful. Bowlby described what is likely to happen if such a case occurs, “Whenever the natural object of attachment behavior is unavailable, the behavior can become directed towards some substitute object.  Even though it is inanimate, such an object frequently appears capable of filling the role of an important, though subsidiary, attachment ‘figure.’  Like the principal attachment figure, the inanimate substitute is sought especially when a child is tired, ill or distressed”.&lt;ref name="Bowlby"/&gt;{{rp|313}}

Granqvist and others&lt;ref name="Granqvist. Mikulincer, Shaver"/&gt; suggest that people should also be able to turn to God as a substitute attachment-like figure under such conditions.  The compensation pathway’s focus is on the degree to which experiences with insensitive caregivers and/or attachment insecurities are associated with use of God and religion to regulate attachment-related distress.

Studies on attachment and religion have been ambiguous with no clear findings. 
According to Hall, Fukujima and Delaney after an independent review of literature: "On the surface, it appears that the empirical literature to date presents a rather inconsistent picture."&lt;ref name="TODD W. HALL 2010"&gt;TODD W. HALL, Attachment to God and Implicit Spirituality, Clarifying Correspondence and Compensation Models, ''Journal of Psychology and Theology'', 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The same authors in 2010 found that the compensation model was not supported, and insecure individuals high in parental insensitivity were not more religious.&lt;ref name="TODD W. HALL 2010"/&gt;

Hagekull and Granqvist in 2001 found that childhood insecure attachment to a mother were strongly related to holding positive beliefs about astrology, the occult, parapsychology and UFOs in a Swedish sample.&lt;ref&gt;Personality and cognitive predictors of New Age practices and beliefs by Miguel Farias, Gordon Claridge and Mansur Lalljee, ''Personality and Individual Differences'', 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Since these New Age beliefs, such as parapsychology or astrology are unrelated to a personal God, these results argue against the model that insecure individuals adopt concepts involving a personal loving God to compensate for inadequate childhood relationships.
 
Granqvist and Kirkpatrick&lt;ref name=G&gt;Granqvist, P. &amp; Kirkpatrick, L. A. (2004). Religious conversion and perceived childhood attachment: A meta-analysis. ''International Journal For The Psychology Of Religion'', 14(4), 223-250. doi:10.1207/s15327582ijpr1404_1&lt;/ref&gt; found that people who had sudden conversions to religion not only outscored non-converts in parental insensitivity but also outscored individuals who had experienced a more gradual increase in religiousness, however, the same authors have also found that people who suddenly deconverted from a religion, such as agnostics and atheists also scored higher in childhood insecure attachments to a mother or father.&lt;ref&gt;''Attachment, Evolution and the Psychology of Religion'' by Lee A. Kirkpatrick, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly to insecure parental attachment, insecure romantic attachment predicts sudden religious conversions and deconversions.&lt;ref name="Granqvist. Mikulincer, Shaver"/&gt;  

===Correspondence pathway===

Bowlby&lt;ref name="Bowlby"/&gt; suggests attachment patterns continue across time partly because the way a person sees themselves and others ([[Attachment theory|internal working model]]) guides behavioral, emotional, and cognitive responses in social interactions over the life span.  The correspondence hypothesis suggests individual differences in religious beliefs and experience should correspond with individual differences in the internal working models and attachment patterns.&lt;ref name="Granqvist. Mikulincer, Shaver"/&gt;  This theory suggests a "secure" IWM of self and others predicts viewing God as supporting.  A person with a preoccupied or anxious attachment may be expected to have a deeply emotional, grasping relationship with God, while a person with an avoidant attachment would be expected to view God as remote or inaccessible.&lt;ref name="Granqvist. Mikulincer, Shaver"/&gt;

The correspondence hypothesis suggests securely attached people would be expected to reflect the religious standards while insecurely attached people would not be expected to reflect their attachment figure’s religious standards.&lt;ref name="Granqvist"&gt;Granqvist, P. (2002). Attachment and religiosity in adolescence: Cross-sectional and longitudinal evaluations. ''Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin'', 28(2), 260-270. doi:10.1177/0146167202282011&lt;/ref&gt;  People who report being more cared for by parents score higher on measures of religiousness, but only if their parents also displayed high levels of religiosity.&lt;ref name="Granqvist"/&gt; Another study found that such people had a higher assessed religiosity as socially rooted in the parental relationship.  This aspect of the correspondence hypothesis, that is, people reflecting attachment figure’s religious standards, can be called "[[Correspondence principle (sociology)|social correspondence]]".&lt;ref name="Granqvist"/&gt;

The '''Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences''', abbreviated '''BITSS''', is an academic initiative dedicated to advancing [[transparency]] and openness in [[social science]] research. It was established in 2012 by the [[University of California, Berkeley]]'s [[Center for Effective Global Action]]. It is led by an interdisciplinary group of academics from ten different universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.bitss.org/about/ |title=About |date=2015-10-08 |website=Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences |language=en-US |access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has worked with the [[Center for Open Science]] to define and promote a set of best practices for social scientists to maximize transparency in their research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Miguel |first=E. |last2=Camerer |first2=C. |last3=Casey |first3=K. |last4=Cohen |first4=J. |last5=Esterling |first5=K.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6669">The '''Canadian Conservation Institute''' ('''CCI''') is a special operating agency of the federal [[Department of Canadian Heritage]]. CCI provides research, information, and services regarding the [[Conservator-restorer|conservation and preservation]] of [[cultural artifact]]s.&lt;ref name = NSERCC&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Students-Etudiants/PD-NP/Laboratories-Laboratoires/CCI-ICC_eng.asp|title=Canadian Conservation Institute |last= |first= |date= |website= Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada |publisher= Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada |others= |archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=3 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A-AD-266-000/AG-001 Canadian Forces Museums –Operations and Administration 2002-04-03&lt;/ref&gt; Materials and media it handles includes paper, textiles, metals, and glass, as well as electronic media, such as audio tape and compact discs. The CCI offices are located in the [[Ottawa]] suburb of [[Gloucester, Ontario|Gloucester]].

==Mission==
The CCI is recognized as a pioneer and leader in the conservation of [[cultural heritage]] in [[Canada]].&lt;ref name= McElhone &gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.ngcmagazine.ca/features/nathan-stolow-1928-2014-an-art-conservation-pioneer |title= Nathan Stolow (1928–2014): An Art Conservation Pioneer |last= McElhone |first= John |date= 12 December 2014 |website= National Gallery of Canada Magazine |publisher= [[National Gallery of Canada]] |others= |archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CCI supports the heritage community in preserving Canada's heritage collections so they can be accessed by current and future generations. The CCI is charged with the duty "to promote the proper care and perservation of Canada's moveable cultural heritage, and to advance the practice, science, and technology of conservation."&lt;ref name= Commission &gt;{{cite book |last= Turko |first= Karen|date= February 1996|title= Preservation Activities in Canada: A Unifying Theme in a Decentralised Country|url= https://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub60/pub60.pdf|location= |publisher= The Commission on Preservation and Access|page= |isbn= 1-887334-47-5|author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The CCI originated within the [[National Gallery of Canada]] in 1957, as its Conservation and Scientific Research Division under the leadership of Dr. Nathan Stolow.&lt;ref name= McElhone /&gt; In 1964, the division was granted greater autonomy and became the National Conservation Research Laboratory ("NCRL").&lt;ref name= McElhone /&gt; As a result of its success, in 1972 the NCRL was split off from the National Gallery of Canada and was renamed the Canadian Conservation Institute with Dr. Stolow as its first Director General.&lt;ref name= McElhone /&gt; It now operates as an agency of the federal government of Canada, currently under the auspices of the Department of Canadian Heritage.

The CCI is primarily a research organization, but provides education and services on conservation and restoration-related matters.&lt;ref name= Commission /&gt; The CCI now promotes the proper care and preservation of Canada's cultural heritage and to advance the practice, science, and technology of conservation. The Institute has worked closely with hundreds of Canadian museums, art galleries, archives, libraries, historic sites, academic institutions, and other heritage organizations to help them better preserve their collections.&lt;ref name= Commission /&gt; The primary role of CCI's clients is to acquire, conserve, research, communicate, and exhibit permanent heritage collections that are accessible to the Canadian public for purposes of study, education, and enjoyment. As a Special Operating Agency of the Department of Canadian Heritage, CCI has widened its scope of activities and now markets its services and products around the world. The CCI was included amongst other architecturally interesting and historically significant buildings in [[Doors Open Ottawa]], held June 2, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://ottawa.ca/doorsopen Doors Open Ottawa&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==
The following are but some of the services CCI provides:&lt;ref name = NSERCC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Wright|first= Julia|date= 18 November 2016|title= Historic quilt stitches together Confederation story|url= http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/confederation-quilt-restored-1.3855102| work= |location= |access-date= 11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CCI also provides project-specific teams for conservation, scientific, and testing projects. Its Paper Group works with archives and libraries in preserving and restoring their collections.&lt;ref name= Commission /&gt; Research conducted by the Paper Group includes paper bleaching, [[enzyme]] use, washing, and de-acidification.&lt;ref name= Commission /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Tse |first= Season |last2= Bégin |first2= P. |date= July 2014|title= Highlights of Paper Research at the Canadian Conservation Institute |journal= Studies in Conservation |volume= 47|issue= s3|pages= 193–198|doi= 10.1179/sic.2002.47.s3.040}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CCI also self-publishes a variety of materials related to its work.&lt;ref name= Commission /&gt; As well, each year it publishes the ''CCI, the Journal of the Canadian Conservation Institute''. With a staff of about 80 to 100,&lt;ref name= Commission /&gt; the CCI has treated more than 13,000 objects for the heritage community, has published hundreds of scientific papers, and has distributed in excess of one million publications.&lt;ref name = NSERCC/&gt; The Institute responds to at least 2,000 requests for assistance annually. Working together in well-equipped, fully secure, climate-controlled laboratories, [[Conservator-restorer|conservators]], [[chemists]], [[engineers]], [[biologists]], and other professionals handle projects ranging from information inquiries to complex treatments and [[research]].

'''Consensus theory''' is a [[social theory]] that holds a particular [[political system|political]] or [[economic system]] is a fair system, and that [[social change]] should take place within the [[social institution]]s provided by it. Consensus theory contrasts sharply with [[conflict theory]], which holds that social change is only achieved through conflict.

Under consensus theory the absence of conflict is seen as the equilibrium state of society and that there is a general or widespread agreement among all members of a particular society about [[Norm (philosophy)|norms]], [[value (ethics)|values]], [[Law|rules]] and [[regulation]]s. Consensus theory is concerned with the maintenance or continuation of social order in society.

Consensus theory serves as a sociological argument for the furtherance and preservation of the [[status quo]]. It is antagonistic to [[conflict theory]], which serves as a sociological argument for modifying the status quo or for its total reversal. In consensus theory, the rules are seen as integrative, and whoever doesn't respect them is a deviant person. Under conflict theory, the rules are seen as coercive, and who transgresses them is considered an agent of change.{{dubious|date=September 2012}}{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

'''''Curse of the Forty-Niner''''' is a 2002 horror film directed by [[John Carl Buechler]]. It is known more commonly by its video title, Miner's Massacre.
 
==Plot==
A group of explorers go hiking in the forests of northern California. While exploring, they stumble upon an old mine which mined gold in the [[California Gold Rush]]. In the depths of the mine, they find a large amount of gold that they, of course, take. However, what they do not know is that the gold belonged to a miner named Jerimiah Stone, who died in the mine. He has awaken from the dead and is planning on killing anyone who gets in the way of his gold, exacting revenge in whatever way he can.

'''DPSIR''' (drivers, pressures, state, impact and response model of intervention) is a causal framework for describing the interactions between society and the environment: [[Human impact on the environment]] and vice versa because of the [[interdependence]] of the components.

== Description ==

This framework has been adopted by the [[European Environment Agency]]. The components of this model are:
* '''D'''riving forces: e.g. [[industry]], [[tourism]], [[economic growth]]
* '''P'''ressures: e.g. [[pollution]], [[land-use change]], [[population growth]]
* '''S'''tates : e.g. [[water quality]], [[soil quality]], [[air quality]], [[habitat]], [[vegetation]]
* '''I'''mpacts : e.g. ill [[public health]], [[habitat fragmentation]], [[economic crisis]], [[environmental damage]], [[biodiversity loss]]
* '''R'''esponses : e.g. [[tax]]es, [[environmental law]]s, 

This framework is an extension of the pressure-state-response model developed by [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

As a first step, data and information on all the different elements in the DPSIR chain is collected. Then possible connections between these different aspects are postulated. Through the use of the DPSIR modelling framework, it is possible to gauge the effectiveness of responses put into place.

[[File:Hans Baldung 006.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Hans Baldung]], ''Der Tod und das Mädchen'', 1517]]

'''''Death and the Maiden''''' (''Der Tod und das Mädchen'' in German) was a common [[motif (narrative)|motif]] in [[Renaissance art]], especially painting and prints in Germany. The usual form shows just two figures, with a young woman being seized by [[Death (personification)|a personification of Death]], often shown as a skeleton. Variants may include other figures.  It developed from the [[Danse Macabre]] with an added [[eroticism|erotic]] subtext. The German artist [[Hans Baldung]] depicted it several times.&lt;ref&gt;Le Mort dans l'Art&lt;/ref&gt; 

The motif was revived during the [[Romanticism|romantic era in the arts]], a notable example being [[Franz Schubert]]'s [[lied|song]] "[[Der Tod und das Mädchen]]", setting a poem by the German poet [[Matthias Claudius]].  Part of the piano part was re-used in Schubert's famous [[String Quartet No. 14 (Schubert)|String Quartet No. 14]], which is therefore also known by this title, in either English or German.&lt;ref&gt;Le Mort dans l'Art&lt;/ref&gt;

{{canon law}}
A  '''Doctor of Canon and Civil Law''', from the Latin ''doctor utriusque juris'', or ''juris utriusque doctor'', or ''doctor juris utriusque'' ("doctor of both laws") (abbreviations include: JUD, IUD, DUJ, JUDr., DUI, DJU, Dr.iur.utr., Dr.jur.utr., DIU, UJD and UID) is a [[scholar]] who has acquired a [[doctorate]] in both [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and [[Canon law|church law]]. The degree was common among [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] and German scholars&lt;ref&gt;Gottfried Leibniz held the degree. Armgardt, Matthias. [http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S1021-545X2014000100003 Leibniz as a legal scholar]. Fundamina (Pretoria) vol.20 n.1 Pretoria Jan. 2014. Accessed 7 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; of the Middle Ages and early modern times. Today the degree is awarded by the [[Pontifical Lateran University]] after a period of six years of study, by the [[University of Würzburg]], and by the [[University of Fribourg]].

Prior to ca. 1800, people who studied law in Europe, studied canon law, Roman law, and feudal law. These laws were the constituent parts of the ''Ius commune''. The ''Ius commune'' was a pan-European legal system that held sway over Europe from approximately the twelfth through the eighteenth century. Graduates earned the decree of Doctor of both laws, because they had to study both canon law and civil law, in order to master the ''Ius commune''.&lt;ref&gt;Pennington, Kenneth. [http://faculty.cua.edu/pennington/Law508/Blurb.htm Course Description: Roman Law and the Ius Commune] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225055932/http://faculty.cua.edu/pennington/Law508/Blurb.htm |date=25 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability to read is believed to depend on two skills:

'''Douglas Mark Rushkoff''' (born 18 February 1961) is an American [[media theorist]], writer, columnist, lecturer, graphic novelist, and documentarian. He is best known for his association with the early [[cyberpunk]] culture, and his advocacy of [[open source]] solutions to social problems.

Rushkoff is most frequently regarded as a [[media theory|media theorist]] and is known for coining terms and concepts including [[Viral marketing|viral media]] (or media virus), [[digital native]], and social currency. He has written ten books on media, technology and culture. He wrote the first syndicated column on [[cyberculture]] for ''[[The New York Times|The New York Times Syndicate]]'', as well as regular columns for ''[[The Guardian]]'' of London,&lt;ref name="guardian2002"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2002/jul/25/onlinesupplement.newmedia |title=Signs of the times &amp;#124; Technology |publisher=The Guardian |date= 2002-07-25|accessdate=2009-07-25 | location=London | first=Douglas | last=Rushkoff}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Arthur (magazine)|Arthur]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arthurmag.com/2009/03/30/crowdsourcing-the-bank-recovery-by-douglas-rushkoff/ |title=Crowdsourcing The Bank Recovery By Douglas Rushkoff &amp;#124; Arthur Magazine – We Found The Others |publisher=Arthurmag.com |date=2009-03-30 |accessdate=2009-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://discovermagazine.com/search?SearchableText=rushkoff&amp;Submit.x=0&amp;Submit.y=0 |title=Science and Technology News, Science Articles |publisher=Discover Magazine |date=2007-01-21 |accessdate=2009-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[online magazine]]s ''[[Daily Beast]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/author/douglas-rushkoff/ |title=Douglas Rushkoff |publisher=The Daily Beast |date= |accessdate=2009-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[TheFeature]].com and meeting industry magazine One+.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mpiweb.org/Magazine|title=Publications - Meeting Professionals International|website=www.mpiweb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

=== Background ===

Rushkoff was born in New York City, New York, and is the son of Sheila, a psychiatric social worker, and Marvin Rushkoff, a hospital administrator.&lt;ref name=reff1/&gt; He graduated from [[Princeton University]] in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://paw.princeton.edu/issues/2009/07/15/sections/search-and-archives/search.xml |title=Princeton Alumni Weekly: Search &amp; Archives |publisher=Paw.princeton.edu |date=2009-07-15 |accessdate=2009-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to Los Angeles and completed a [[Master of Fine Arts]] in Directing from the [[California Institute of the Arts]]. Later he took up a [[Postgraduate education|post-graduate]] fellowship from the [[American Film Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6q3dW91a0fgC&amp;pg=PA138 |title=The devil's candy: The bonfire of ... – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a PhD candidate at [[Utrecht University]]'s New Media Program, writing a dissertation on new media literacies,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.let.uu.nl/tftv/nieuwemedia/comments.php?id=P656_0_3_0_C |title=NewMediaStudies.nl |publisher=Let.uu.nl |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2009-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was approved in June, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/rushkoff/status/217387153188065281 |title=Dissertation approved. |publisher=Twitter |date=2012-06-25 |accessdate=2012-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rushkoff emerged in the early 1990s as an active member of the cyberpunk movement, developing friendships and collaborations with people including [[Timothy Leary]], [[R. U. Sirius|RU Sirius]], [[Paul Krassner]], [[Robert Anton Wilson]], [[Ralph Abraham (mathematician)|Ralph Abraham]], [[Terence McKenna]], [[Genesis P-Orridge]], [[Ralph Metzner]], [[Grant Morrison]], [[Mark Pesce]], [[Erik Davis]], and other writers, artists and philosophers interested in the intersection of technology, society and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.educause.edu/blog/agould/OpenSourceRealityDouglasRushko/167730 |title=Open Source Reality: Douglas Rushkoff Examines the Effects of Open Source &amp;#124; EDUCAUSE |publisher=Educause.edu |date=2008-07-01 |accessdate=2009-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Michael Foord |url=http://www.voidspace.org.uk/cyberpunk/cyberia.shtml |title=Douglas Rushkoff – Cyberia |publisher=Voidspace.org.uk |date=1905-10-14 |accessdate=2009-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.seric.com/timothy/ |title=An Open Letter from the friend's of Dr. Timothy Leary |publisher=Seric.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Cyberia'', his first book on cyberculture, was inspired by the San Francisco [[rave]] scene of the early 1990s.  The initially planned publication was scrapped, however; in Rushkoff's words, "in 1992 Bantam canceled the book because they thought by 1993 the internet would be over."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/digitalnation/extras/interviews/rushkoff.html |title=Frontline: digital nation: interviews: douglas rushkoff |publisher=PBS |date=2009-03-24 |accessdate=2009-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was eventually published in 1994.

As his books became more accepted, and his concepts of the "media virus"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mediamatic.nl/magazine/previews/reviews/marshall/marshall=rushkoff.html |title=Mediamatic Review: J.

In 2002, Rushkoff was awarded the [[Marshall McLuhan]] Award by the Media Ecology Association for his book ''Coercion'', and became a member and sat on the [[board of directors]] of that organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.media-ecology.org/awards/mea_recipients.html |title=Past MEA Award Recipients |publisher=Media-ecology.org |date=2001-02-26 |accessdate=2009-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allied him with the "media ecologists", a continuation of what is known as the Toronto School of media theorists including [[Marshall McLuhan]], [[Walter J. Ong|Walter Ong]], and [[Neil Postman]].

Rushkoff was invited to participate as a consultant ranging to [[United Nations|the United Nations]] Commission on World Culture and the US [[United States Department of State|Department of State]].

Simultaneously, Rushkoff continued to develop his relationship with counterculture figures, collaborating with Genesis P-Orridge as a keyboardist for [[Psychic TV]], and credited with composing music for the album ''Hell is Invisible Heaven is Her/e''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cduniverse.com/sresult.asp?HT_Search=xartist&amp;HT_Search_Info=Douglas+Rushkoff |title=Douglas Rushkoff Discography and Music at CD Universe |publisher=Cduniverse.com |date=2009-03-08 |accessdate=2009-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rushkoff taught classes in media theory and in media subversion for New York University's Interactive Telecommunications Program,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.core77.com/design.edu/school_details.asp?school_id=64319 |title=Core77 / industrial design magazine + resource / Design.EDU |publisher=Core77.com |date=2005-01-08 |accessdate=2009-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; participated in activist pranks with the [[The Yes Men|Yes Men]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.theyesmen.org/yes-men-book |title=Book |publisher=The Yes Men |date= |accessdate=2009-07-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090308025046/http://theyesmen.org/yes-men-book |archivedate=2009-03-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and eToy,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Jill Priluck |url=https://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/news/1999/12/33189 |title=Etoy: 'This Means War' |publisher=Wired.com |date=2009-01-04 |accessdate=2009-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; contributed to numerous books and documentaries on psychedelics, and spoke or appeared at many events sponsored by counterculture publisher Disinformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.disinfo.com/archive/pages/dossier/id176/pg1/ |title=disinformation &amp;#124; douglas rushkoff |publisher=Disinfo.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417062032/http://www.disinfo.com/archive/pages/dossier/id176/pg1/ |archivedate=2009-04-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Influences ===
References to media ecologist and Toronto School of Communication founder [[Marshall McLuhan]] appear throughout Rushkoff's work as a focus on media over content, the effects of media on [[popular culture]] and the level at which people participate when consuming media.&lt;ref name="blogspot1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digitalmindsblog.blogspot.com/2008/03/media-resistance-interview-with-douglas.html |title=Digital Minds Blog: Media Resistance – An Interview with Douglas Rushkoff |publisher=Digitalmindsblog.blogspot.com |date=2008-03-26 |accessdate=2009-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rushkoff worked with both Robert Anton Wilson&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Robert-Anton-Wilson-Maybe-Logic/dp/B000EU1HQM |title=Robert Anton Wilson – Maybe Logic: Robert Anton Wilson, Valerie Corral, Paul Krassner, Tom Robbins, Douglas Rushkoff, R.U. Sirius, Douglass Smith, Lance Bauscher, Cody McClintock, Robert Dofflemyer, Katherine Covell: Movies &amp; TV |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Timothy Leary on developing philosophical systems to explain consciousness, its interaction with technology, and [[social evolution]] of the human species, and references both consistently in his work.
Leary, along with [[John Perry Barlow|John Barlow]] and Terence McKenna characterized the mid-1990s as techno-utopian, and saw the rapid acceleration of culture, emerging media and the unchecked advancement of technology as completely positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/rushkoff/rushkoff_index.html |title=The Thing That I Call Doug |publisher=EDGE |date= |accessdate=2009-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Rushkoff's own unbridled enthusiasm for cyberculture was tempered by the dotcom boom, when the non-profit character of the Internet was rapidly overtaken by corporations and [[venture capital]]. Rushkoff often cites two events in particular – the day Netscape became a [[public company]] in 1995,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mindjack.com/rushkoff/coercion.html |title=Mindjack Magazine: Coercion by Douglas Rushkoff |publisher=Mindjack.com |date=1999-10-01 |accessdate=2009-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the day AOL bought [[Time Warner]] in 2000&lt;ref name="guardian2002"/&gt; – as pivotal moments in his understanding of the forces at work in the evolution of new media.

Rushkoff spent several years exploring [[Judaism]] as a primer for [[media literacy]], going so far as to publish a book inviting Jews to restore the religion to its "open source" roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.zeek.net/feature_03074.shtml |title=A Conversation with Douglas Rushkoff |publisher=Zeek |date= |accessdate=2009-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He founded a movement for progressive Judaism called Reboot, but subsequently left when he felt its funders had become more concerned with marketing and publicity of Judaism than its actual improvement and evolution.&lt;ref name="blogspot1" /&gt;
Disillusioned by the failure of the open source model to challenge entrenched and institutional hierarchies from religion to finance, he became a colleague of [[Mark Crispin Miller]] and [[Naomi Klein]], appearing with them at [[Smith College]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.smith.edu/response/timeline.php |title=Smith College: The Community Responds to Tragedy |publisher=Smith.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-07-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202211906/http://www.smith.edu/response/timeline.php |archivedate=2008-12-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in numerous documentaries decrying the corporatization of public space and consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/persuaders/ |title=frontline: the persuaders |publisher=PBS |date=2004-11-09 |accessdate=2009-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He has dedicated himself most recently to the issues of media literacy,&lt;ref name="namle1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.namle.net/about/national-advisory-council |title=National Advisory Council – NAMLE – National Association for Media Literacy Education – Advancing Media Literacy Education in America |publisher=NAMLE |date= |accessdate=2009-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; participatory government, and the development of local and [[complementary currencies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Newitz |first=Annalee |url=http://www.portfolio.com/views/columns/dual-perspectives/2009/04/13/DIY-Currencies |title=DIY Currencies – Dual Perspectives |publisher=Portfolio.com |date=2008-09-11 |accessdate=2009-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote a book and film called ''Life Inc.'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2009-05-11 |author=rushkoff|url=http://www.boingboing.net/2009/05/11/life-inc-the-movie.html |title=Life Inc: The Movie |publisher=Boing Boing |accessdate=2009-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; which traces the development of [[corporatism]] and centralized currency from the Renaissance to today, and hosts a [[Radio programming|radio show]] called MediaSquat on WFMU, concerned with reclaiming commerce and culture from corporate domination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.wfmu.org/freeform/2009/03/new-podcast-the-media-squat-with-douglas-rushkoff.html |title=WFMU's Beware of the Blog: New Podcast: The Media Squat with Douglas Rushkoff |publisher=Blog.wfmu.org |date=2009-03-25 |accessdate=2009-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Themes ==

=== General ===
Douglas Rushkoff's philosophy developed from a techno-utopian view of new media to a more nuanced critique of cyberculture discourse and the impact of media on society. Viewing everything except for intention as media, he frequently explores the themes of how to make media interactive, how to help people (especially children) effectively analyze and question the media they consume, as well as how to cultivate intention and agency. He has theorized on such media as religion, culture, politics, and money.

=== Technology and cyberculture ===
Up to the late-1990s, Douglas Rushkoff's philosophy towards technology could be characterized as media-deterministic. Cyberculture and new media were supposed to promote democracy and allow people to transcend the ordinary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/issues/vol18/issue34/screens.rushkoff.html |title=Archives: 1998-1999 |publisher=The Austin Chronicle |date= |accessdate=2009-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Cyberia'', Rushkoff states the essence of mid-1990s culture as being the fusion of rave psychedelia, [[chaos theory]] and early [[Computer networking|computer networks]]. The promise of the resulting "counter culture" was that media would change from being passive to active, that we would embrace the social over content, and that empowers the masses to create and react.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/cyberia-salem/cyberia |title=Cyberia Summary – Douglas Rushkoff – Magill Book Reviews |publisher=Enotes.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This idea also comes up in the concept of the media virus, which Rushkoff details in the 1994 publication of ''Media Virus: Hidden Agendas in Popular Culture''. This significant work adopts organic metaphors to show that media, like viruses, are mobile, easily duplicated and presented as non-threatening.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, Andrew. "Truth is a Virus ." Culture Jamming 101 . 2002. Retrieved on May 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Technologies can make our interaction with media an empowering experience if we learn to decode the capabilities offered to us by our media. Unfortunately, people often stay one step behind our media capabilities. Ideally, emerging media and technologies have the potential to enlighten, to aid grassroots movements, to offer an alternative to the traditional "top-down" media, to connect diverse groups and to promote the sharing of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1517/1432 |title=Barbrook |publisher=Firstmonday.org |date= |accessdate=2009-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rushkoff does not limit his writings to the effect of technology on adults, and in ''Playing the Future'' turns his attention to the generation of people growing up who understand the language of media like natives, guarded against coercion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spikemagazine.com/0297rush.php |title=Douglas Rushkoff : Children Of Chaos (Playing The Future) : Lost In Translation |publisher=Spikemagazine.com |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2009-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; These "screenagers", a term originated by Rushkoff,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/turnsofphrase/tp-scr1.htm |title=Screenager |publisher=World Wide Words |date=1998-01-10 |accessdate=2009-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; have the chance to mediate the changing landscape more effectively than digital immigrants.

With ''Coercion'' (1999), Rushkoff realistically examines the potential benefits and dangers inherent in cyberculture and analyzes market strategies that work to make people act on instinct (and buy!) rather than reflect rationally. The book wants readers to learn to "read" the media they consume and interpret what is really being communicated.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

=== Religion ===
In ''Nothing Sacred: The Truth About Judaism'', Rushkoff explores the medium of religion and intellectually deconstructs the Bible and the ways that religion fails to provide true connectivity and transformative experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wishtank.org/magazine/commons/douglas_rushkoff_interview |archive-url=https://archive.is/20080526122741/http://www.wishtank.org/magazine/commons/douglas_rushkoff_interview |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-05-26 |title=Douglas Rushkoff Interview // wishtank magazine |publisher=Wishtank.org |date= |accessdate=2009-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Currency ===
Most recently, Douglas Rushkoff has turned his critical lens to the medium of [[currency]]. One of the most important concepts that he creates and develops is the notion of [[social currency]], or the degree to which certain content and media can facilitate and/or promote relationships and interactions between members of a community. Rushkoff mentions jokes, scandals, blogs, ambiance, i.e. anything that would engender "water cooler" talk, as social currency.

In his book, ''Life, Inc.'' and his dissertation "Monopoly Moneys," Rushkoff takes a look at physical currency and the history of [[corporatism]]. Beginning with an overview of how [[money]] has been gradually centralized throughout time, and pondering the reasons and consequences of such a fact, he goes on to demonstrate how our society has become defined by and controlled by [[Organizational culture|corporate culture]].

=== Social media ===

Rushkoff has long been skeptical of social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2011-09/21/doug-rushkoff-hello-etsy|title=You are Facebook's product, not its customer // Wired |publisher=wired.com |date=2011-09-11 |accessdate=2011-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 25, 2013, he announced in a CNN op-ed that he was leaving [[Facebook]], citing concerns about the company's use of his personal data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/02/25/opinion/rushkoff-why-im-quitting-facebook|title=Why I'm quitting Facebook // CNN |publisher=CNN.com |date=2013-02-25 |accessdate=2013-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 401K Plans ===

In 2016, Douglas Rushkoff penned an article critical of [[401(k)]] plans, in which he refers to the stock market as a "[[pyramid scheme]]" and states "In the 401(k) game, the patsy is anyone who follows the advice of the human resources department and surrenders a portion of his or her paycheck to the retirement planning industry, all under the pretense of personal responsibility." Rushkoff does not suggest any alternatives to 401K plans for retirement savings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-you-might-want-rethink-making-those-401k-douglas-rushkoff|title=Why You Might Want To Rethink Making Those 401(k) Contributions|date=4 April 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:JohnLocke.png|thumb|[[John Locke]] (1632–1704), a leading philosopher of British empiricism]]
In philosophy, '''empiricism''' is a [[theory]] that states that knowledge comes only or primarily from [[Empirical evidence|sensory experience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Psillos|first1=Stathis|last2=Curd|first2=Martin|title=The Routledge companion to philosophy of science|date=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0415546133|pages=129–38|edition=1. publ. in paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is one of several views of  [[epistemology]], the study of human knowledge, along with [[rationalism]] and [[philosophical skepticism|skepticism]]. Empiricism emphasises the role of [[empirical evidence]] in the formation of ideas, over the idea of [[innate idea]]s or [[traditions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Baird | first = Forrest E. | authorlink = |author2=Walter Kaufmann | title = From Plato to Derrida | publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall | year = 2008 | location = Upper Saddle River, New Jersey | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-13-158591-6 }}{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, empiricists may argue that traditions (or customs) arise due to relations of previous sense experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Hume, David. ''Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding'', 1748.{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Empiricism in the [[philosophy of science]] emphasises evidence, especially as discovered in [[experiment]]s. It is a fundamental part of the [[scientific method]] that all hypotheses and theories must be tested against observations of the natural world rather than resting solely on ''[[A priori (philosophy)|a priori]]'' reasoning, [[intuition (knowledge)|intuition]], or [[revelation]].

Empiricism, often used by natural scientists, says that "knowledge is based on experience" and that "knowledge is tentative and probabilistic, subject to continued revision and [[Falsifiability|falsification]]".&lt;ref&gt;Shelley, M. (2006). Empiricism. In F. English (Ed.), Encyclopedia of educational leadership and administration. (pp. 338–39). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Empirical research, including experiments and validated measurement tools, guides the scientific method.

==Etymology==
The English term ''empirical'' derives from the [[Ancient Greek]] word ἐμπειρία, ''empeiria'', which is cognate with and translates to the Latin ''experientia'', from which are derived the word ''experience'' and the related ''experiment''.

==History==

===Background===
{{Main|Empirical method}}

A central concept in  [[science]] and the [[scientific method]] is that it must be ''empirically'' based on the evidence of the senses. Both [[natural science|natural]] and [[social science]]s use working [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] that are [[testable]] by [[observation]] and [[experiment]]. The term ''semi-empirical'' is sometimes used to describe theoretical methods that make use of basic [[axiom]]s, established scientific laws, and previous experimental results in order to engage in reasoned model building and theoretical inquiry.

Philosophical empiricists hold no knowledge to be properly inferred or deduced unless it is derived from one's sense-based experience.&lt;ref&gt;Markie, P. (2004), "Rationalism vs. Empiricism" in Edward D. Zalta (ed.), ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rationalism-empiricism/ Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt; This view is commonly contrasted with [[rationalism]], which states that knowledge may be derived from [[reason]] independently of the senses. For example, [[John Locke]] held that some knowledge (e.g. knowledge of God's existence) could be arrived at through [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] and reasoning alone. Similarly [[Robert Boyle]], a prominent advocate of the experimental method, held that we have innate ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Loeb, Luis E. (1981), ''From Descartes to Hume: Continental Metaphysics and the Development of Modern Philosophy'', Ithaca, Cornell University Press.{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Engfer, Hans-Jürgen (1996), ''Empirismus versus Rationalismus? Kritik eines philosophiegeschichtlichen Schemas'', Padeborn: Schöningh.{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main continental rationalists ([[Descartes]], [[Spinoza]], and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]) were also advocates of the empirical "scientific method".&lt;ref&gt;Buckle, Stephen (1999), "British Sceptical Realism. A Fresh Look at the British Tradition", ''European Journal of Philosophy'', 7, pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Anstey, "[https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/emxphi/2010/09/esp-is-best/ ESP is best]", ''[https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/emxphi/ Early Modern Experimental Philosophy]'', 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early empiricism===
''[[Vaisheshika]]'' [[darsana]], founded by the ancient Indian philosopher [[Kanada (philosopher)|Kanada]], accepted perception and inference as the only two reliable sources of knowledge. This is enumerated in his work [[Vaiśeṣika Sūtra]].

The earliest Western proto-empiricists were the [[Empiric school]] of ancient Greek medical practitioners, who rejected the three doctrines of the [[Dogmatic school]], preferring to rely on the observation of ''[[Phenomenalism|"phenomena"]]''.&lt;ref name=sini&gt;Sini, Carlo (2004), "Empirismo", in Gianni Vattimo et al. (eds.), ''Enciclopedia Garzanti della Filosofia''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of ''[[tabula rasa]]'' ("clean slate" or "blank tablet") connotes a view of mind as an originally blank or empty recorder (Locke used the words "white paper") on which experience leaves marks. This denies that humans have [[innate ideas]]. The image dates back to [[Aristotle]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
What the mind (''[[nous]]'') thinks must be in it in the same sense as letters are on a tablet (''grammateion'') which bears no actual writing (''grammenon'');  this is just what happens in the case of the mind.  (Aristotle, ''[[On the Soul]]'', 3.4.430&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;1).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Aristotle's explanation of how this was possible was not strictly empiricist in a modern sense, but rather based on his theory of [[potentiality and actuality]], and experience of sense perceptions still requires the help of the [[active intellect|active ''nous'']]. These notions contrasted with [[Platonism|Platonic]] notions of the human mind as an entity that pre-existed somewhere in the heavens, before being sent down to join a body on Earth (see Plato's ''[[Phaedo]]'' and ''Apology'', as well as others).  Aristotle was considered to give a more important position to sense perception than [[Plato]], and commentators in the Middle Ages summarized one of his positions as "''nihil in intellectu nisi prius fuerit in sensu''" (Latin for "nothing in the intellect without first being in the senses").

This idea was later developed in ancient philosophy by the [[stoicism|Stoic]] school. Stoic epistemology generally emphasized that the mind starts blank, but acquires knowledge as the outside world is impressed upon it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bardzell|first1=Jeffrey|title=Speculative Grammar and Stoic Language Theory in Medieval Allegorical Narrative: From Prudentius to Alan of Lille|date=June 11, 2014|publisher=Routledge|pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The doxographer [[Aetius (philosopher)|Aetius]] summarizes this view as "When a man is born, the Stoics say, he has the commanding part of his soul like a sheet of paper ready for writing upon."&lt;ref&gt;Diels-Kranz 4.11 translated by {{cite book|last1=Long|first1=A.A.|last2=Sedley|first2=D.N.|title=The Hellenistic Philosophers: Vol. 1|date=1987|publisher=Cambridge|location=Cambridge, Ma|pages=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Avicenna.jpg|thumb|left|A drawing of [[Avicenna|Ibn Sina]] (Avicenna) from 1271]]

During the [[Middle Ages]] Aristotle's theory of ''tabula rasa'' was developed by [[Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosophers]] starting with [[Al Farabi]], developing into an elaborate theory by [[Avicenna]]&lt;ref name=Rizvi/&gt; and demonstrated as a [[thought experiment]] by [[Ibn Tufail]].&lt;ref name=Russell/&gt; For Avicenna ([[Avicenna|Ibn Sina]]), for example, the ''tabula rasa'' is a pure potentiality that is actualized through [[education]], and knowledge is attained through "empirical familiarity with objects in this world from which one abstracts universal concepts" developed through a "[[Syllogism|syllogistic]] method of [[reasoning]] in which observations lead to propositional statements which when compounded lead to further abstract concepts". The [[intellect]] itself develops from a [[passive intellect|material intellect]] (''al-'aql al-hayulani''), which is a [[potentiality]] "that can acquire knowledge to the [[active intellect]] (''al-[['aql]] al-fa'il''), the state of the human intellect in conjunction with the perfect source of knowledge".&lt;ref name=Rizvi&gt;Sajjad H. Rizvi (2006), [http://www.iep.utm.edu/a/avicenna.htm Avicenna/Ibn Sina (c. 980–1037)], ''[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''&lt;/ref&gt; So the immaterial "active intellect", separate from any individual person, is still essential for understanding to occur.

In the 12th century CE the [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]] [[Muslim]] philosopher and novelist Abu Bakr [[Ibn Tufail]] (known as "Abubacer" or "Ebn Tophail" in the West) included the theory of ''tabula rasa'' as a [[thought experiment]] in his [[Arabic literature|Arabic philosophical novel]], ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan]]'' in which he depicted the development of the mind of a [[feral child]] "from a ''tabula rasa'' to that of an adult, in complete isolation from society" on a [[desert island]], through experience alone. The [[Latin]] translation of his [[philosophical novel]], entitled ''Philosophus Autodidactus'', published by [[Edward Pococke]] the Younger in 1671, had an influence on [[John Locke]]'s formulation of ''tabula rasa'' in ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]''.&lt;ref name=Russell&gt;G. A. Russell (1994), ''The 'Arabick' Interest of the Natural Philosophers in Seventeenth-Century England'', pp. 224–62, [[Brill Publishers]], {{ISBN|90-04-09459-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar [[Islamic theology|Islamic theological]] novel, ''[[Theologus Autodidactus]]'', was written by the Arab theologian and physician [[Ibn al-Nafis]] in the 13th century. It also dealt with the theme of empiricism through the story of a feral child on a desert island, but departed from its predecessor by depicting the development of the protagonist's mind through contact with society rather than in isolation from society.&lt;ref name="Roubi"&gt;Dr. Abu Shadi Al-Roubi (1982), "Ibn Al-Nafis as a philosopher", ''Symposium on Ibn al-Nafis'', Second International Conference on Islamic Medicine: Islamic Medical Organization, Kuwait ([[cf.]] [http://www.islamset.com/isc/nafis/drroubi.html Ibn al-Nafis As a Philosopher] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206072116/http://www.islamset.com/isc/nafis/drroubi.html |date=February 6, 2008 }}, ''Encyclopedia of Islamic World'')&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 13th century [[Thomas Aquinas]] adopted the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] position that the senses are essential to mind into [[scholasticism]]. [[Bonaventure]] (1221–1274), one of Aquinas' strongest intellectual opponents, offered some of the strongest arguments in favour of the Platonic idea of the mind.

===Renaissance Italy===
In the late [[renaissance]] various writers began to question the [[medieval]] and [[classical philosophy|classical]] understanding of knowledge acquisition in a more fundamental way. In political and historical writing [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] and his friend [[Francesco Guicciardini]] initiated a new realistic style of writing. Machiavelli in particular was scornful of writers on politics who judged everything in comparison to mental ideals and demanded that people should study the "effectual truth" instead. Their contemporary, [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452–1519) said, "If you find from your own experience that something is a fact and it contradicts what some authority has written down, then you must abandon the authority and base your reasoning on your own findings."&lt;ref&gt;"Seeing the Body: The Divergence of Ancient Chineseand Western Medical Illustration", Camillia Matuk, Journal of Biocommunication, Vol. 32, No. 1, 2006, [http://www.sesp.northwestern.edu/docs/publications/6074956944509ac426aaa6.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

The decidedly anti-Aristotelian and anti-clerical music theorist [[Vincenzo Galilei]] (c. 1520 – 1591), father of [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] and the inventor of [[monody]], made use of the method in successfully solving musical problems, firstly, of tuning such as the relationship of pitch to string tension and mass in stringed instruments, and to volume of air in wind instruments; and secondly to composition, by his various suggestions to composers in his ''Dialogo della musica antica e moderna'' (Florence, 1581). The Italian word he used for "experiment" was ''esperienza''. It is known that he was the essential pedagogical influence upon the young Galileo, his eldest son (cf. Coelho, ed. ''Music and Science in the Age of Galileo Galilei''), arguably one of the most influential empiricists in history. Vincenzo, through his tuning research, found the underlying truth at the heart of the misunderstood myth of '[[Pythagorean hammers|Pythagoras' hammers]]' (the square of the numbers concerned yielded those musical intervals, not the actual numbers, as believed), and through this and other discoveries that demonstrated the fallibility of traditional authorities, a radically empirical attitude developed, passed on to Galileo, which regarded "experience and demonstration" as the ''sine qua non'' of valid rational enquiry.

===British empiricism===
'''British empiricism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, though it was not a term used at the time, derives from the 17th century period of [[early modern philosophy]] and [[modern science]]. The term became useful in order to describe differences perceived between two of its founders [[Francis Bacon]], described as [[The Advancement of Learning|empiricist]], and [[René Descartes]], who is described as a rationalist. [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[Baruch Spinoza]], in the next generation, are often also described as an empiricist and a rationalist respectively. [[John Locke]], [[George Berkeley]], and [[David Hume]] were the primary exponents of empiricism in the 18th century [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], with Locke being the person who is normally known as the founder of empiricism as such.

In response to the early-to-mid-17th century "[[rationalism#Background|continental rationalism]]" [[John Locke]] (1632–1704) proposed in ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1689) a very influential view wherein the ''only'' knowledge humans can have is ''[[a posteriori]]'', i.e., based upon experience. Locke is famously attributed with holding the proposition that the human mind is a ''[[tabula rasa]]'', a "blank tablet", in Locke's words "white paper", on which the experiences derived from sense impressions as a person's life proceeds are written. There are two sources of our ideas: sensation and reflection. In both cases, a distinction is made between simple and complex ideas. The former are unanalysable, and are broken down into primary and secondary qualities. Primary qualities are essential for the object in question to be what it is. Without specific primary qualities, an object would not be what it is. For example, an apple is an apple because of the arrangement of its atomic structure. If an apple was structured differently, it would cease to be an apple. Secondary qualities are the sensory information we can perceive from its primary qualities. For example, an apple can be perceived in various colours, sizes, and textures but it is still identified as an apple. Therefore, its primary qualities dictate what the object essentially is, while its secondary qualities define its attributes. Complex ideas combine simple ones, and divide into substances, modes, and relations. According to Locke, our knowledge of things is a perception of ideas that are in accordance or discordance with each other, which is very different from the quest for [[certainty]] of [[Descartes]].

[[File:George Berkeley by John Smibert.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Bishop George Berkeley]]]]
A generation later, the Irish [[Anglican]] bishop, [[George Berkeley]] (1685–1753), determined that Locke's view immediately opened a door that would lead to eventual [[atheism]]. In response to Locke, he put forth in his ''[[Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge]]'' (1710) an important challenge to empiricism in which things ''only'' exist either as a ''result'' of their being perceived, or by virtue of the fact that they are an entity doing the perceiving. (For Berkeley, God fills in for humans by doing the perceiving whenever humans are not around to do it.)  In his text ''Alciphron'', Berkeley maintained that any order humans may see in nature is the language or handwriting of God.&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, Stephen (1987) "Berkeley's Theory of Reality" in ''The Journal of the Limerick Philosophical Society'', [http://www.ul.ie/~philos/vol1/berkel.html UL.ie]&lt;/ref&gt; Berkeley's approach to empiricism would later come to be called [[subjective idealism]].&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan Encyclopedia of Philosophy (1969), "George Berkeley", vol. 1, p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MEP2"/&gt;

The Scottish philosopher [[David Hume]] (1711–1776) responded to Berkeley's criticisms of Locke, as well as other differences between early modern philosophers, and moved empiricism to a new level of [[skepticism]].  Hume argued in keeping with the empiricist view that all knowledge derives from sense experience, but he accepted that this has implications not normally acceptable to philosophers. He wrote for example, "Locke divides all arguments into demonstrative and probable. On this view, we must say that it is only probable that all men must die or that the sun will rise to-morrow, because neither of these can be demonstrated. But to conform our language more to common use, we ought to divide arguments into demonstrations, proofs, and probabilities—by ‘proofs’ meaning arguments from experience that leave no room for doubt or opposition."&lt;ref name="Hume_human_understanding_chap_prob"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/4320/4320-h/4320-h.htm|last=Hume|chapter=Of Probability|title=Enquiries Concerning the Human Understanding and Concerning the Principles of Morals}}&lt;/ref&gt; And,&lt;ref name="Hume_human_understanding_chap_nec"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/4320/4320-h/4320-h.htm|last=Hume|chapter=Of the Idea of a Necessary Connexion|title=Enquiries Concerning the Human Understanding and Concerning the Principles of Morals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"I believe the most general and most popular explication of this matter, is to say [See Mr. Locke, chapter of power.], that finding from experience, that there are several new productions in matter, such as the motions and variations of body, and concluding that there must somewhere be a power capable of producing them, we arrive at last by this reasoning at the idea of power and efficacy. But to be convinced that this explication is more popular than philosophical, we need but reflect on two very obvious principles. First, That reason alone can never give rise to any original idea, and secondly, that reason, as distinguished from experience, can never make us conclude, that a cause or productive quality is absolutely requisite to every beginning of existence. Both these considerations have been sufficiently explained: and therefore shall not at present be any farther insisted on."|Hume Section XIV "of the idea of necessary connexion in ''A Treatise of Human Nature''}}

Hume divided all of human knowledge into two categories: ''relations of ideas'' and ''matters of fact'' (see also [[Immanuel Kant|Kant's]] [[analytic-synthetic distinction]]). Mathematical and logical propositions (e.g. "that the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the two sides") are examples of the first, while propositions involving  some [[contingent]] observation of the world (e.g. "the sun rises in the East") are examples of the second. All of people's "ideas", in turn, are derived from their "impressions". For Hume, an "impression" corresponds roughly with what we call a sensation. To remember or to imagine such impressions is to have an "idea". Ideas are therefore the faint copies of sensations.&lt;ref name = Hume1/&gt;

[[File:David Hume.jpg|thumb|right|[[David Hume]]'s empiricism led to numerous philosophical schools.]]
Hume maintained that no knowledge, even the most basic beliefs about the natural world, can be conclusively established by reason.  Rather, he maintained, our beliefs are more a result of accumulated ''habits'', developed in response to accumulated sense experiences. Among his many arguments Hume also added another important slant to the debate about [[scientific method]]—that of the [[problem of induction]].  Hume argued that it requires [[inductive reasoning]] to arrive at the premises for the principle of inductive reasoning, and therefore the justification for inductive reasoning is a circular argument.&lt;ref name = Hume1/&gt; Among Hume's conclusions regarding the problem of induction is that there is no certainty that the future will resemble the past.  Thus, as a simple instance posed by Hume, we cannot know with certainty by [[inductive reasoning]] that the sun will continue to rise in the East, but instead come to expect it to do so because it has repeatedly done so in the past.&lt;ref name=Hume1&gt;Hume, D. "An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding", in Enquiries Concerning the Human Understanding and Concerning the Principles of Morals, 2nd edition, L.A. Selby-Bigge (ed.), [[Oxford University Press]], Oxford, UK, 1902 [1748].{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume concluded that such things as belief in an external world and belief in the existence of the self were not rationally justifiable. According to Hume these beliefs were to be accepted nonetheless because of their profound basis in instinct and custom.  Hume's lasting legacy, however, was the doubt that his skeptical arguments cast on the legitimacy of inductive reasoning, allowing many skeptics who followed to cast similar doubt.

===Phenomenalism===
{{Main|Phenomenalism}}
Most of Hume's followers have disagreed with his conclusion that belief in an external world is ''rationally'' unjustifiable, contending that Hume's own principles implicitly contained the rational justification for such a belief, that is, beyond being content to let the issue rest on human instinct, custom and habit.&lt;ref&gt;Morick, H. (1980), Challenges to Empiricism, Hackett Publishing, Indianapolis, IN.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to an extreme empiricist theory known as [[phenomenalism]], anticipated by the arguments of both Hume and George Berkeley, a physical object is a kind of construction out of our experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Marconi, Diego (2004), "Fenomenismo"', in [[Gianni Vattimo]] and Gaetano Chiurazzi (eds.), ''L'Enciclopedia Garzanti di Filosofia'', 3rd edition, Garzanti, Milan, Italy.&lt;/ref&gt;  Phenomenalism is the view that physical objects, properties, events (whatever is physical) are reducible to mental objects, properties, events. Ultimately, only mental objects, properties, events, exist—hence the closely related term [[subjective idealism]]. By the phenomenalistic line of thinking, to have a visual experience of a real physical thing is to have an experience of a certain kind of group of experiences.  This type of set of experiences possesses a constancy and coherence that is lacking in the set of experiences of which hallucinations, for example, are a part. As [[John Stuart Mill]] put it in the mid-19th century, matter is the "permanent possibility of sensation".&lt;ref&gt;Mill, J.S., "An Examination of Sir William Rowan Hamilton's Philosophy", in A.J. Ayer and Ramond Winch (eds.), British Empirical Philosophers, Simon and Schuster, New York, NY, 1968.{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mill's empiricism went a significant step beyond Hume in still another respect: in maintaining that induction is necessary for ''all'' meaningful knowledge including mathematics.  As summarized by D.W. Hamlin:

{{quote|[Mill] claimed that mathematical truths were merely very highly confirmed generalizations from experience; mathematical inference, generally conceived as deductive [and ''a priori''] in nature, Mill set down as founded on induction.  Thus, in Mill's philosophy there was no real place for knowledge based on relations of ideas.  In his view logical and mathematical necessity is psychological; we are merely unable to conceive any other possibilities than those that logical and mathematical propositions assert. This is perhaps the most extreme version of empiricism known, but it has not found many defenders.&lt;ref name = MEP2/&gt;}}

Mill's empiricism thus held that knowledge of any kind is not from direct experience but an inductive inference from direct experience.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Fred (2005), "John Stuart Mill", in Edward N. Zalta (ed.), Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt;  The problems other philosophers have had with Mill's position center around the following issues: Firstly, Mill's formulation encounters difficulty when it describes what direct experience is by differentiating only between actual and possible sensations.  This misses some key discussion concerning conditions under which such "groups of permanent possibilities of sensation" might exist in the first place.  Berkeley put God in that gap; the phenomenalists, including Mill, essentially left the question unanswered. In the end, lacking an acknowledgement of an aspect of "reality" that goes beyond mere "possibilities of sensation", such a position leads to a version of subjective idealism. Questions of how floor beams continue to support a floor while unobserved, how trees continue to grow while unobserved and untouched by human hands, etc., remain unanswered, and perhaps unanswerable in these terms.&lt;ref name = MEP2/&gt;&lt;ref name=MEP6&gt;Macmillan Encyclopedia of Philosophy (1969), "Phenomenalism", vol. 6, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, Mill's formulation leaves open the unsettling possibility that the "gap-filling entities are purely possibilities and not actualities at all".&lt;ref name="MEP6"/&gt;  Thirdly, Mill's position, by calling mathematics merely another species of inductive inference, misapprehends mathematics.  It  fails to fully consider the structure and method of [[mathematical science]], the products of which are arrived at through an internally consistent [[deductive reasoning|deductive]] set of procedures which do not, either today or at the time Mill wrote, fall under the agreed meaning of [[inductive reasoning|induction]].&lt;ref name=MEP2&gt;Macmillan Encyclopedia of Philosophy (1969), "Empiricism", vol. 2, p. 503.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MEP6"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan Encyclopedia of Philosophy (1969), "Axiomatic Method", vol. 5, pp. 188–89, 191ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenalist phase of post-Humean empiricism ended by the 1940s, for by that time it had become obvious that statements about physical things could not be translated into statements about actual and possible sense data.&lt;ref&gt;Bolender, John (1998), "Factual Phenomenalism: A Supervenience Theory"', Sorites, no. 9, pp. 16–31.&lt;/ref&gt;  If a physical object statement is to be translatable into a sense-data statement, the former must be at least deducible from the latter. But it came to be realized that there is no finite set of statements about actual and possible sense-data from which we can deduce even a single physical-object statement.  The translating or paraphrasing statement must be couched in terms of normal observers in normal conditions of observation. There is, however, no ''finite'' set of statements that are couched in purely sensory terms and can express the satisfaction of the condition of the presence of a normal observer. According to phenomenalism, to say that a normal observer is present is to make the hypothetical statement that were a doctor to inspect the observer, the observer would appear to the doctor to be normal.  But, of course, the doctor himself must be a normal observer. If we are to specify this doctor's normality in sensory terms, we must make reference to a second doctor who, when inspecting the sense organs of the first doctor, would himself have to have the sense data a normal observer has when inspecting the sense organs of a subject who is a normal observer. And if we are to specify in sensory terms that the second doctor is a normal observer, we must refer to a third doctor, and so on (also see the [[Third Man Argument|third man]]).&lt;ref&gt;Berlin, Isaiah (2004), The Refutation of Phenomenalism, Isaiah Berlin Virtual Library.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chisholm |first1=Roderick M. |date=September 9, 1948 |title=The Problem of Empiricism |journal=The Journal of Philosophy |volume=45 |issue=19 |pages=512–17 |jstor=2019108 |doi=10.2307/2019108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Logical empiricism===
{{Main|Logical positivism}}
Logical empiricism (also ''logical positivism'' or ''neopositivism'') was an early 20th-century attempt to synthesize the essential ideas of British empiricism (e.g. a strong emphasis on sensory experience as the basis for knowledge) with certain insights from [[mathematical logic]] that had been developed by [[Gottlob Frege]]  and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]. Some of the key figures in this movement were [[Otto Neurath]], [[Moritz Schlick]] and the rest of the [[Vienna Circle]], along with  [[A.J. Ayer]], [[Rudolf Carnap]] and [[Hans Reichenbach]].

The neopositivists subscribed to a notion of philosophy as the conceptual clarification of the  methods, insights and discoveries of the sciences. They saw in the logical symbolism elaborated by Frege (1848–1925) and [[Bertrand Russell]] (1872–1970) a powerful instrument that could rationally reconstruct all scientific discourse into an ideal, logically perfect, language that would be free of the ambiguities and deformations of natural language. This gave rise to what they saw as metaphysical pseudoproblems and other conceptual confusions. By combining Frege's thesis that all mathematical truths are logical with the early Wittgenstein's idea that all [[logical truth]]s are mere linguistic [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]], they arrived at a twofold classification of all propositions: the ''analytic'' (a priori) and the ''synthetic'' (a posteriori).&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Achinstein|Achinstein, Peter]], and [[Stephen Francis Barker|Barker, Stephen F.]] (1969), The Legacy of Logical Positivism: Studies in the Philosophy of Science, Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, MD.{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On this basis, they formulated a strong principle of demarcation between sentences that have sense and those that do not: the so-called [[verification principle]]. Any sentence that is not purely logical, or is unverifiable is devoid of meaning. As a result, most metaphysical, ethical, aesthetic and other traditional philosophical problems came to be considered pseudoproblems.&lt;ref&gt;Barone, Francesco (1986), Il neopositivismo logico, Laterza, Roma Bari.{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the extreme empiricism of the neopositivists—at least before the 1930s—any genuinely synthetic assertion must be reducible to an ultimate assertion (or set of ultimate assertions) that expresses direct observations or perceptions. In later years, Carnap and Neurath abandoned this sort of ''phenomenalism'' in favor of a rational reconstruction of knowledge into the language of an objective spatio-temporal physics.  That is, instead of translating sentences about physical objects into sense-data, such sentences were to be translated into so-called ''protocol sentences'', for example, "''X'' at location ''Y'' and at time ''T'' observes such and such."&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Rescher|Rescher, Nicholas]] (1985), The Heritage of Logical Positivism, University Press of America, Lanham, MD.&lt;/ref&gt;  The central theses of logical positivism (verificationism, the analytic–synthetic distinction, reductionism, etc.) came under sharp attack after World War II by thinkers such as [[Nelson Goodman]], [[W.V. Quine]], [[Hilary Putnam]], [[Karl Popper]], and [[Richard Rorty]].  By the late 1960s, it had become evident to most philosophers that the movement had pretty much run its course, though its influence is still significant  among contemporary [[analytic philosophy|analytic philosophers]] such as [[Michael Dummett]] and other [[anti-realism|anti-realists]].

===Pragmatism===
In the late 19th and early 20th century several forms of [[pragmatism|pragmatic philosophy]] arose.  The ideas of pragmatism, in its various forms, developed mainly from discussions between [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] and [[William James]] when both men were at Harvard in the 1870s.  James popularized the term "pragmatism", giving Peirce full credit for its patrimony, but Peirce later demurred from the tangents that the movement was taking, and redubbed what he regarded as the original idea with the name of "pragmaticism".  Along with its ''[[pragmatic theory of truth]]'', this perspective integrates the basic insights of empirical (experience-based) and [[rationalism|rational]] (concept-based) thinking.

[[File:Charles Sanders Peirce theb3558.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Charles Sanders Peirce]]]]
Charles Peirce (1839–1914) was highly influential in laying the groundwork for today's empirical [[scientific method]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2017/entries/peirce/ |title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Burch|first=Robert|date=2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Peirce severely criticized many elements of Descartes' peculiar brand of rationalism, he did not reject rationalism outright.  Indeed, he concurred with the main ideas of rationalism, most importantly the idea that rational concepts can be meaningful and the idea that rational concepts necessarily go beyond the data given by empirical observation.  In later years he even emphasized the concept-driven side of the then ongoing debate between strict empiricism and strict rationalism, in part to counterbalance the excesses to which some of his cohorts had taken pragmatism under the "data-driven" strict-empiricist view.

Among Peirce's major contributions was to place [[inductive reasoning]] and [[deductive reasoning]] in a complementary rather than competitive mode, the latter of which had been the primary trend among the educated since David Hume wrote a century before.  To this, Peirce added the concept of [[abductive reasoning]].  The combined three forms of reasoning serve as a primary conceptual foundation for the empirically based scientific method today.  Peirce's approach "presupposes that (1) the objects of knowledge are real things, (2) the characters (properties) of real things do not depend on our perceptions of them, and (3) everyone who has sufficient experience of real things will agree on the truth about them.  According to Peirce's doctrine of [[fallibilism]], the conclusions of science are always tentative. The rationality of the scientific method does not depend on the certainty of its conclusions, but on its self-corrective character: by continued application of the method science can detect and correct its own mistakes, and thus eventually lead to the discovery of truth".&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Teddy (n.d.), "Empiricism", [http://personal.ecu.edu/mccartyr/american/leap/empirici.htm Eprint] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120714183655/http://personal.ecu.edu/mccartyr/american/leap/empirici.htm |date=2012-07-14 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wm james.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[William James]]]]
In his Harvard "Lectures on Pragmatism" (1903), Peirce enumerated what he called the "three cotary propositions of pragmatism" ([[Latin|L:]] ''cos, cotis'' whetstone), saying that they "put the edge on the [[pragmatic maxim|maxim of pragmatism]]".  First among these he listed the peripatetic-thomist observation mentioned above, but he further observed that this link between sensory perception and intellectual conception is a two-way street.  That is, it can be taken to say that whatever we find in the intellect is also incipiently in the senses.  Hence, if theories are theory-laden then so are the senses, and perception itself can be seen as a species of [[abductive reasoning|abductive inference]], its difference being that it is beyond control and hence beyond critique—in a word, incorrigible.  This in no way conflicts with the fallibility and revisability of scientific concepts, since it is only the immediate percept in its unique individuality or "thisness"—what the [[Scholastics]] called its ''[[haecceity]]''—that stands beyond control and correction.  Scientific concepts, on the other hand, are general in nature, and transient sensations do in another sense find correction within them.  This notion of perception as abduction has received periodic revivals in [[artificial intelligence]] and [[cognitive science]] research, most recently for instance with the work of [[Irvin Rock]] on ''[[indirect perception]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Rock, Irvin (1983), The Logic of Perception, MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts.{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rock, Irvin, (1997) Indirect Perception, MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts.{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the beginning of the 20th century, William James (1842–1910) coined the term "[[radical empiricism]]" to describe an offshoot of his form of pragmatism, which he argued could be dealt with separately from his pragmatism—though in fact the two concepts are intertwined in James's published lectures. James maintained that the empirically observed "directly apprehended universe needs ... no extraneous trans-empirical connective support",&lt;ref&gt;James, William (1911), The Meaning of Truth.&lt;/ref&gt; by which he meant to rule out the perception that there can be any [[value added]] by seeking [[supernatural]] explanations for [[nature|natural]] [[phenomena]].  James' "radical empiricism" is thus ''not'' radical in the context of the term "empiricism", but is instead fairly consistent with the modern use of the term "[[empirical]]". His method of argument in arriving at this view, however, still readily encounters debate within philosophy even today.

[[John Dewey]] (1859–1952) modified James' pragmatism to form a theory known as [[instrumentalism]].  The role of sense experience in Dewey's theory is crucial, in that he saw experience as unified totality of things through which everything else is interrelated.  Dewey's basic thought, in accordance with empiricism was that [[reality]] is determined by past experience.  Therefore, humans adapt their past experiences of things to perform experiments upon and test the pragmatic values of such experience.  The value of such experience is measured experientially and scientifically, and the results of such tests generate ideas that serve as instruments for future experimentation,&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, John (1906), Studies in Logical Theory.{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in physical sciences as in ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1353/jsp.2011.0000 |title=What Experimentalism Means in Ethics |year=2011 |last1=Weber |first1=Eric Thomas |journal=The Journal of Speculative Philosophy |volume=25 |pages=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, ideas in Dewey's system retain their empiricist flavour in that they are only known ''a posteriori''.

{{Evolutionary biology}}
'''Evolutionary anthropology''' is the interdisciplinary study of the [[human evolution|evolution]] of [[human physiology]] and [[human behaviour]] and the relation between [[hominids]] and non-hominid [[primate]]s. Evolutionary anthropology is based in [[natural science]] and [[social science]]. Various fields and disciplines of evolutionary anthropology are:

* [[Human evolution]] and [[anthropogeny]].
* [[Paleoanthropology]] and [[paleontology]] of both human and non-human primates.
* [[Primatology]] and primate [[ethology]].
* The [[sociocultural evolution]] of [[human behavior]].
* The [[evolutionary psychology]] and [[evolutionary linguistics]] of humans.
* The [[archaeological]] study of human technology and change over time and space.
* [[Human evolutionary genetics]] and changes in the [[human genome]] over time.
* The [[neuroscience]], [[endocrinology]], and [[neuroanthropology]] of human and primate cognition, culture and actions and abilities.
* [[Human behavioural ecology]] and the interaction of humans and the environment.
* Studies of human [[anatomy]], [[physiology]], [[molecular biology]], [[biochemistry]], and differences and changes between species, variation between human groups, and relationships to cultural factors.

Evolutionary anthropology is concerned with both biological and cultural evolution of humans, past and present. It is based on a [[scientific]] approach, and brings together fields such as archaeology, [[behavioral ecology]], [[psychology]], primatology, and [[genetics]]. It is a dynamic and [[interdisciplinary]] field, drawing on many lines of evidence to understand the human experience, past and present.

Studies of biological evolution generally concern the evolution of the human form. Cultural evolution involves the study of cultural change over time and space and frequently incorporate [[cultural transmission]] models. Note that cultural evolution is not the same as biological evolution, and that human culture involves the transmission of cultural information, which behaves in ways quite distinct from [[human biology]] and [[genetics]]. The study of cultural change is increasingly performed through [[cladistics]] and genetic models.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5105">'''Extended order''' is an [[economics]] and [[sociology]] concept introduced by [[Friedrich Hayek]] in his book ''[[The Fatal Conceit]]''. It is a description of what happens when a system embraces [[Specialization (functional)|specialization]] and [[trade]] and "constitutes an information gathering process, able to call up, and put to use, widely [[dispersed knowledge|dispersed information]] that no [[central planning]] agency, let alone any individual, could know as a whole, possess or control.”&lt;ref name="Hayek"&gt;Hayek, F.A. "The Fatal Conceit: The Errors of Socialism". The University of Chicago Press. 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|14}} The result is an interconnected web where people can benefit from the actions and knowledge of those they don't know. This is possible and efficient because a proper [[law|legal]] framework replaces [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]], which is only practical in small circles of people who know each other socially. The extended order is at the heart of Hayek's thesis, in ''The Fatal Conceit'', where he argues that "our civilization depends, not only for its origin but also for its preservation, on what can be precisely described only as the extended order of human cooperation, an order more commonly, if somewhat misleading, known as [[capitalism]].”&lt;ref name="Hayek" /&gt;{{rp|6}}

==Development of the extended order in society==
The ''extended order'' "is a framework of institutions – economic, legal, and moral – into which we fit ourselves by obeying certain rules of conduct that ''we never made'', and which ''we have never understood'' in the sense of which we understand how the things that we manufacture function.”&lt;ref name="Hayek" /&gt;{{rp|14}} This "order resulted ''not'' from human design or intention but spontaneously: it arose from unintentionally conforming to certain traditional &amp; largely moral practices, many of which men tend to dislike, whose significance they usually fail to understand, whose validity they cannot prove, and which have nonetheless fairly rapidly spread by means of an evolutionary selection – the comparative increase in population &amp; wealth – of those groups that happened to follow them.”&lt;ref name="Hayek" /&gt;{{rp|6}}

The adoption of these practices, by these groups, “increased their access to valuable information of all sorts, &amp; enabled them to be 'fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it' (Genesis 1:28). This process is perhaps the least appreciated facet of human evolution.”&lt;ref name="Hayek" /&gt;{{rp|6}}

The extended order's formation “required individuals to change their ‘natural’ or instinctual’ responses to others, something strongly resisted", whereas any &amp; all "constraints on the practices of the small group, it must be emphasized &amp; repeated, are ''hated''.”&lt;ref name="Hayek" /&gt;{{rp|13}} This is because man “knows so many objects that seem desirable but for which he is not permitted to grasp, and he cannot see how other beneficial features of his environment depend on the discipline to which he is forced to submit – a discipline forbidding him to reach out for these same appealing objects. Disliking these constraints so much, we can hardly be said to have selected them; rather, these constraints selected us: they enabled us to survive.”&lt;ref name="Hayek" /&gt;{{rp|14}}

The evolutionary process of the extended order can be stimulated by increases in individual freedom and has even realized some of its greatest advances during times of anarchy, however it can (and quite often has throughout history) been hindered by government constraint, as Hayek says, "Protection of several property, not the direction of its use by government, laid the foundations for the growth of the dense network of exchange of services that shaped the extended order."&lt;ref name="Hayek" /&gt;{{rp|33}} The extended order is "not a creation of man's reason but a distinct second endowment conferred on him by cultural evolution."&lt;ref name="Hayek" /&gt;{{rp|52}}

Not being genetically transferred, the continuing cultural evolution of the extended order requires teaching &amp; passing on to each new generation the prevailing traditions, customs, morality &amp; rules.&lt;ref name="Hayek" /&gt;{{rp|25}} This cultural evolutionary requirement was also analyzed by [[Will Durant|Will]] and [[Ariel Durant]] who said: "Civilization is not inherited; it has to be learned and earned by each generation anew; if the transmission should be interrupted for one century, civilization would die, and we should be savages again."&lt;ref&gt;Will Durant and Ariel Durant, "[[The Lessons of History]]". Simon &amp; Schuster. 1968; p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fairfield Materials Management Ltd''' is a [[Manchester]] based  [[social enterprise]] that operates a community waste management project at Manchester’s New Smithfield Market focused on minimising waste, and bringing social and environmental benefits to Greater Manchester.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fairfieldcompost.co.uk/about/history.html&lt;/ref&gt;

By utilising '[[in-vessel composting]]', Fairfield Materials Management established the UK’s first sustainable [[biodegradable]] [[waste management]] system to operate on a wholesale market,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fairfieldcompost.co.uk/about.html&lt;/ref&gt; diverted 16,500 tonnes of organic market waste material away from [[landfill]] between 2003 and 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fairfieldcompost.co.uk/what_we_do.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Fairfield has developed a composting production model that processes fruit, vegetable, plant and woody waste into [[peat]]-free, [[British Standards Institution]] PAS 100&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wrap.org.uk/composting/compost_
specifications/bsi_pas_100/bsi_pas_100_1.
&lt;/ref&gt; accredited compost.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.letsrecycle.com/materials/composting/news.jsp?story=5785&lt;/ref&gt; It operates on a site fully licensed by the [[Environment Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fairfieldcompost.co.uk/about.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 Fairfield was recognised as the most innovative social enterprise within its sector by The Composting Association.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.compostingconference.com/Community_Init_Award.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Fairfield Materials Management was founded in 2003 by a small group of ecological activists, horticulturists and social entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fairfieldcompost.co.uk/about.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Fairfield Materials Management was initiated by Val Rawlinson (Director) after she became involved in an East Manchester anti-incineration campaign in 1996. The incinerator was not built, but Lucy Danger and Val Rawlinson realised that they had to show Manchester that environmental and social alternatives were available and working successfully throughout the United Kingdom and so Fairfield Composting was established by Val who began promoting home composting and supplying compost bins.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.debdale-eco-centre.com&lt;/ref&gt; and Lucy set up EMERGE Recycling recruiting Val as a director.

Val also recognised the need for a commercial sized composting system for New Smithfield Market and choose a Vertical Composting Unit (VCU) system as the preferred technology; Emma Smith was recruited as a waste auditor in November 2001 to undertake a waste composition analysis of Smithfield Market's waste.  Chris Walsh joined the team and between 2001 and 2003 the group secured several hundred thousand pounds through grants and loans,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adventurecapitalfund.org.uk/content/view/28/59/&lt;/ref&gt; designed the site, obtaining planning permission and a waste management licence.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.communitycompost.org/hotrotters/fmm.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 Fairfield began operating and initially diverted waste from four market traders, taking in [[green waste]] from [[Manchester City Council]] and producing compost.  In 2004 a further two composting units were added and in 2005 a final three units were added to the system.  This enabled Fairfield to process all of the market's fruit and vegetable waste through the in-situ technology.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fairfieldcompost.co.uk/about/history.html&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst remaining a director of Fairfield Val set up Debdale Eco Centre(DEC) and with Emma's help secured funding to promote home composting.  WRAP funding later enabled DEC to run a project supplying low cost compost bins which achieved high home composting levels.  When Manchester City Council working in partnership with BIFFA introduced the Green Bin home composting levels were reduced negating the work undertaken by Val. Val retired from DEC aged 70 in 2010 but continues as a Director of Fairfield  

The business became sustainable through the efforts of Ian Trippier who was recruited as office manager bringing his vast experience of social enterprises and business acumen to the organisation. Ian and Eric Lowry, Operations Manager, have proved an invaluable partnership raising standards in Waste Management and turning Fairfield into a very successful organisation.   

In 2009 the Fairfield Group in partnership national [[renewable energy]] business Bio Group Ltd &lt;ref&gt;http://www.crainsmanchesterbusiness.co.uk/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090106/FREE/301069997/1046/energy&lt;/ref&gt; secured planning permission in [[Bredbury]], [[Stockport]] for their second waste management site.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.englandsnorthwest.com/invest/news/archive/8162-food-recycle-plant-approved.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rogier van der Weyden St Luke Some Chick MFA Boston.jpg|thumb|''Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin'', c. 1435–1440. 137.5 x 110.8cm. [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]. This was the classic subject for paintings given to the guilds]]
The '''Guild of Saint Luke''' was the most common name for a city [[guild]] for painters and other artists in [[early modern Europe]], especially in the [[Low Countries]]. They were named in honor of the [[Four Evangelists|Evangelist]] [[Saint Luke|Luke]], the [[patron saint]] of artists, who was identified by [[John of Damascus]] as having painted the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin's]] portrait.&lt;ref&gt;Howe.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most famous such organizations was founded in [[Antwerp]].&lt;ref&gt;Ford-Wille.&lt;/ref&gt; It continued to function until 1795, although by then it had lost its [[Legal monopoly|monopoly]] and therefore most of its power. In most cities, including Antwerp, the local government had given the Guild the power to regulate defined types of trade within the city.  Guild membership, as a master, was therefore required for an artist to take on apprentices or to sell paintings to the public. Similar rules existed in [[Delft]], where only members could sell paintings in the city or have a shop.&lt;ref&gt;Montias (1977): 98.&lt;/ref&gt; The early guilds in Antwerp and [[Bruges]], setting a model that would be followed in other cities, even had their own showroom or market stall from which members could sell their paintings directly to the public.&lt;ref name="prak248"&gt;Prak (2003): 248.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The guild of Saint Luke not only represented painters, sculptors, and other visual artists, but also—especially in the seventeenth century—dealers, amateurs, and even art lovers (the so-called ''liefhebbers'').&lt;ref name="prak249"&gt;Prak (2004): 249.&lt;/ref&gt; In the medieval period most members in most places were probably [[illuminated manuscript|manuscript illuminators]], where these were in the same guild as painters on wood and cloth—in many cities they were joined with the scribes or "scriveners". In traditional guild structures, house-painters and decorators were often in the same guild. However, as artists formed under their own specific guild of St. Luke, particularly in the Netherlands, distinctions were increasingly made.&lt;ref name="smith432"&gt;Smith (1999): 432.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, guilds also made judgments on disputes between artists and other artists or their clients.&lt;ref name="prak249" /&gt; In such ways, it controlled the economic career of an artist working in a specific city, while in different cities they were wholly independent and often competitive against each other. 

==Antwerp ==
Although it did not become a major artistic center until the sixteenth century, Antwerp was one of, if not the first, city to found a guild of Saint Luke. It is first mentioned in 1382, and was given special privileges by the city in 1442.&lt;ref name="baudouin"&gt;Baudouin (1973): 23–27.&lt;/ref&gt; The registers, or ''[[Liggeren]]'', from the guild exist, cataloging when artists became masters, who the dean for each year was, what their specialities were, and the names of any students.&lt;ref name="baudouin" /&gt;  In Bruges, however, which was the dominant city for artistic production in the Low Countries in the fifteenth century, the earliest known list of guild members dates to 1453, although the guild was certainly older than this.  There all artists had to belong to the guild in order to practice in their own names or to sell their works, and the guild was very strict about which artistic activities could be practiced–distinctly forbidding an artisan to work in an area where another guild's members, such as tapestry weaving, were represented.&lt;ref name="campbell"&gt;Campbell (1976): 191.&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Bruges==
The Bruges guild, in a typically idiosyncratic medieval arrangement, also included the saddlemakers, probably because most members were painting [[illuminated manuscript]]s on [[vellum]], and were therefore grouped as a sort of leatherworker. Perhaps because of this link, for a period they had a rule that all miniatures needed a tiny mark to identify the artist, which was registered with the Guild.&lt;ref&gt;Farquhar (1980): 371–383.&lt;/ref&gt;   Only under special privileges, such as court artist, could an artist effectively practice their craft without holding membership in the guild.&lt;ref name="campbell" /&gt; [[Peter Paul Rubens]] had a similar situation in the seventeenth century, when he obtained special permission from the Archdukes [[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria|Albert]] and [[Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia of Spain|Isabella]] to be both court artist in [[Brussels]] and an active member of the Guild of Saint Luke in Antwerp.&lt;ref&gt;Belkin (1998): 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Membership also allowed members to sell works at the guild-owned showroom. Antwerp, for example, opened a market stall for selling paintings in front of the  [[Cathedral of Our Lady, Antwerp|cathedral]] in 1460, and Bruges followed in 1482.&lt;ref name="prak248" /&gt;

==Dutch Republic==
[[File:Jan de Bray 002.jpg|right|300px|thumb|The Governors of the [[Haarlem Guild of St. Luke]] in 1675. [[Jan de Bray]] painted himself second from the left. Surprisingly, fewer such group portraits exist for painters than other Guild occupations.]] 
Guilds of St. Luke in the [[Dutch Republic]] began to reinvent themselves as cities there changed over to Protestant rule, and there were dramatic movements in population.  Many St. Luke guilds reissued charters to protect the interests of local painters from the influx of southern talent from places like Antwerp and Bruges. Many cities in the young republic became more important artistic centres in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. [[Amsterdam]] was the first city to reissue a St. Luke's charter after the reformation in 1579, and it included painters, sculptors, engravers, and other trades dealing specifically in the visual arts.&lt;ref name="prak241"&gt;Prak (2003): 241.&lt;/ref&gt; When trade between the [[Spanish Netherlands]] and the [[Dutch Republic]] resumed with the [[Twelve Years' Truce]] in 1609, immigration increased and many Dutch cities reissued guild charters as a form of protection against the great number of paintings that began to cross the border.&lt;ref name="prak241" /&gt; 

[[Image:Guild of Saint Luke.jpg|thumb|1730s engraving of the Delft Guild of St. Luke, by an unknown artist. Today the location of the [[Vermeer Centre]]]]
For example, [[Gouda, South Holland|Gouda]], [[Rotterdam]], and [[Delft]], all founded guilds between 1609 and 1611.&lt;ref name="prak241" /&gt; In each of those cases, panel painters removed themselves from their traditional guild structure that included other painters, such as those who worked in fresco and on houses, in favor of a specific "Guild of St. Luke".&lt;ref name="smith432" /&gt; On the other hand, these distinctions did not take effect at that time in Amsterdam or Haarlem.&lt;ref name="smith432" /&gt; In the [[Haarlem Guild of St. Luke]], however, a strict hierarchy was attempted in 1631 with panel painters at the top, though this hierarchy was eventually rejected.&lt;ref name="smith432" /&gt;  In the [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] guild, also founded in 1611, the break was with the saddlemakers, but in 1644 a further split created a new painters' guild, leaving the guild of Saint Luke with only the sculptors and woodcarvers. A similar move in [[The Hague]] in 1656 led to the painters leaving the Guild of Saint Luke to establish a new ''[[Confrerie Pictura]]'' with all other kinds of visual artists, leaving the guild to the house-painters.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, p.66 &amp; 85&lt;/ref&gt;

Artists in other cities were not successful in setting up their own guilds of St. Luke, and remained part of the existing guild structure (or lack thereof). For example, an attempt was made in [[Leiden]] to set up a guild in 1610 specifically for painters to protect themselves against the sale of art from foreigners, especially those from areas of [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] and the area around [[Antwerp]]. However, the town, which traditionally resisted guilds in general, only offered to help them from illegal imports.&lt;ref name="montias93"&gt;Montias (1977): 93.&lt;/ref&gt; Not until 1648 was a loosely organized "quasi-guild" permitted in that city.&lt;ref&gt;Prak (2003): 242.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Guilds of the small but wealthy seat of government The Hague and its near neighbour, Delft, were constantly battling to stop the other's artists encroaching into their city, often without success.  By the later part of the century a kind of balance was achieved, with The Hague's portraitists supplying both cities, whilst Delft's genre painters did the same.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

==Italy==
In [[Renaissance]] [[Florence]] the Guild of St. Luke, ''per se'', did not exist. Painters belonged to the guild of the Doctors and Apothecaries ("Arte dei Medici e Speziali") as they bought their pigments from the apothecaries, while sculptors were members of the Masters of Stone and Wood ("Maestri di Pietri e Legname).&lt;ref name="hughes3"&gt;Hughes (1986): 3–5.&lt;/ref&gt; They were also frequently members in the confraternity of St. Luke (''Compagnia di San Luca'')—which had been founded as early as 1349—although it was a separate entity from the guild system.&lt;ref&gt;Mather (1948): 20; Jack (1976): 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; There were similar confraternal organizations in other parts of Italy, such as Rome.  By the 16th century a guild had even been established in [[Heraklion|Candia]] in [[Crete]], then a Venetian possession, by the very successful Greek artists of the [[Cretan School]]. In the sixteenth century, the ''Compagnia di San Luca'' began to meet at [[Basilica della Santissima Annunziata di Firenze|SS. Annunziata]], and sculptors, who had previously been members of a confraternity dedicated to St. Paul (''Compagnia di San Paolo''), also joined.&lt;ref&gt;Mather (1948): 20.&lt;/ref&gt; This form of the ''compagnia'' developed into the Florentine [[Accademia di Belle Arti Firenze|Accademia del Disegno]] in 1563, which was then formally incorporated into the city's guild system in 1572.&lt;ref name="hughes3" /&gt; The Florence example, in fact, eventually acted more like a traditional guild structure than the [[Accademia di San Luca]] in [[Rome]].&lt;ref name="hughes3" /&gt; 

Founded by [[Federico Zuccari]] in 1593, Rome's Accademia reflects more clearly the "modern" notions of an artistic academy rather than perpetuating what has often been seen as the medieval nature of the guild system.&lt;ref name="hughes3" /&gt;  Gradually other cities were to follow the example of Rome and the [[Accademia degli Incamminati|Carracci]] in [[Bologna]], with leading painters founding an "Academy", not always initially in direct competition with the local Guilds, but tending to eclipse and supplant it in time. This shift in artistic representation is generally associated with the modern conception of the visual arts as a liberal rather than mechanical art, and occurred in cities across Europe. In Antwerp [[David Teniers the Younger]] was both a dean of the Guild and founded the [[Royal Academy of Fine Arts (Antwerp)|Academy]], while in Venice [[Pittoni]] and [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo|Tiepolo]] led a breakaway [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia|Accademia]] from the old ''Fraglia dei Pittori'' as the local guild was known. The new academies began to offer training in drawing and the early stages of painting to students, and artistic theory, including the [[hierarchy of genres]], increased in importance.

==Guilds and intellectual pursuits==
[[File:Rhetoric-enthroned-invitation-antwerp-landjuweel-1561.jpg|thumb|Printed invitation to other [[Chamber of rhetoric|chambers of rhetoric]] by the Antwerp ''[[Violieren]]'', for a ''landjuweel'' event, lasting 19 days, in 1561]]
The late sixteenth-century elevation of artist's status that occurred in Italy was echoed in the Low Countries by increased participation by artists in literary and humanistic societies. The Antwerp Guild of St. Luke, in particular, was closely associated with one of the city's eminent [[Chamber of rhetoric|chambers of rhetoric]], the ''[[Violieren]]'', and, in fact, the two were often discussed as being the same.&lt;ref name="gibson431"&gt;Gibson (1981): 431 (also n. 37).&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-sixteenth century, when [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] was active in the city, most of the members of the ''Violieren'', including [[Frans Floris]], [[Cornelis Floris]], and [[Hieronymus Cock]], were artists.&lt;ref name="gibson431" /&gt; The relationship between the two organizations, one for professionals practicing a trade and the other a literary and dramatist group, continued into the seventeenth century until the two groups formally merged in 1663 when the Antwerp Academy was founded a century after its Roman counterpart. Similar relationships between the Guild of St. Luke and chambers of rhetoric appear to have existed in Dutch cities in the seventeenth century. [[Haarlem|Haarlem's]] "Liefde boven al" ("Love above all") is a prime example, to which [[Frans Hals]], [[Esaias van de Velde]], and [[Adriaen Brouwer]] all belonged.&lt;ref&gt;Heppner (1939): 23.&lt;/ref&gt; These activities also manifested themselves in groups that developed outside of the guild like Antwerp's [[Guild of Romanists|Romanists]], for whom travel to Italy and appreciation of classical and humanist culture were essential.

==Guild rules==
[[File:Judith Leyster - Self-Portrait - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|250px|left| [[Judith Leyster]] self-portrait at 20, three years before she became the second woman to join the Haarlem Guild in 1633]]
Guild rules varied greatly. In common with the Guilds for other trades, there would be an initial [[apprentice]]ship of at least three, more often five years. Typically, the apprentice would then qualify as a "[[journeyman]]", free to work for any Guild member.  Some artists began to sign and date paintings a year or two before they reached the next stage, which often involved a payment to the Guild, and was to become a "[[Master craftsman|free Master]]".   After this the artist could sell his own works, set up his own workshop with apprentices of his own, and also sell the work of other artists.  [[Anthony van Dyck]] achieved this at eighteen, but in the twenties would be more typical.   

In some places the maximum number of apprentices was specified (as for example two), especially in the earlier periods, and alternatively a minimum of one might be specified.  In [[Nuremberg]] painting, unlike say goldsmithing, was a "free trade" without a Guild and regulated directly by the city council; this was intended to encourage growth in a city where much art was becoming linked with book [[publishing]], for which Nuremberg was the largest German centre.  Nonetheless there were rules and for example only married men could operate a workshop.&lt;ref&gt;Bartrum (2002): 105-6.&lt;/ref&gt; In most cities the women who were important members of workshops making [[illuminated manuscript]]s were excluded from the Guild or from being masters; however not in Antwerp, where [[Caterina van Hemessen]] and others were members.  As the Christian title of the Guild suggested, Jews were excluded, at least from becoming masters, in most cities.  

When [[printmaking]] arrived, many [[engraver]]s were from a [[goldsmith]]ing background and stayed in that guild.  As that link weakened with the development of printmaking, some painter' guilds accepted [[engraver]]s or [[etcher]]s who did not paint as Members, and others did not.  In London painters on glass had their own separate guild with the glaziers; elsewhere they would be accepted by the painters.

The rules of the Delft guild have been much puzzled over by art historians seeking to illuminate the undocumented training of [[Vermeer]].  When he joined the Guild there in 1653, he must have received six years training, according to the local rules. In addition, he had to pay a six guilders admission fee, despite the fact that his father was a Guild member (as an art dealer), which would normally have meant only a three guilder fee. This appears to mean that his training had not been received in Delft itself. [[Pieter de Hooch]] on the other hand, as an immigrant to Delft, had to pay twelve guilders in 1655, which he could not afford to pay all at once.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, pp. 166, 285n60, 160,&lt;/ref&gt;

Another aspect of the Guild rules is illustrated by the dispute between [[Frans Hals]] and [[Judith Leyster]] in Haarlem.  Leyster was the second woman in Haarlem to join the Guild, and probably trained with Hals - she was a witness at the [[baptism]] of his daughter.  Some years later, in 1635, she brought a dispute to the Guild complaining that one of her three apprentices had left her workshop after only a few days, and had been accepted into Hals' shop, in breach of Guild rules.  The Guild had the power to fine members, and after discovering that the apprentice had not been registered with them, fined both artists, and made a ruling on the apprentice's position.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, p.49&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Slive, p.129&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline of the guilds==
All guild local monopolies came under general economic disapproval from the 17th century onwards; in the particular case of painters there was in many places a tension between the Guilds and artists imported as court painter by a ruler.  When [[Anthony van Dyck]] was finally enticed to come to England by King Charles I, he was provided with a house at [[Blackfriars, London|Blackfriars]], then just outside the boundary of the [[City of London]] to avoid the monopoly of the London guild.  [[The Hague]] with its Catholic court, split itself in two in 1656 with the [[Confrerie Pictura]]. By that time it was clear to all involved that the one-stop-shop concept of a guild was past its prime, and to ensure high quality and high prices, the education of artists needed to be separated from sales venues. Many towns set up ''academy'' style schools for education, while sales could be generated from arranged viewings at local inns, estate sales, or open markets.  In Antwerp the Habsburg Governors eventually removed the Guild's monopoly, and by the end of the 18th century hardly any guild monopolies survived, even before [[Napoleon]] disbanded all guilds in territories he controlled.  Guilds survived as societies or charitable organisations, or merged with the newer "[[Academy#Academies_of_the_arts|Academies]]" - as happened in Antwerp, but not in London or Paris.  Guild monopoly had a brief 20th century revival in Eastern Europe under [[Communism]], where non-members of the official artist's union or guild found it very hard to work as painters - for example the Czech [[Josef Váchal]].

==Paintings for the guilds==
In many cities the Guild of Saint Luke financed a chapel that was decorated with an altarpiece of their patron saint.&lt;ref name="olds"&gt;Olds (1990): 89–96.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rogier van der Weyden|Rogier van der Weyden's]] ''[[Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin]]'' ([[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]), one of the earliest-known paintings, set up a tradition that was followed by many subsequent artists.&lt;ref name="olds" /&gt; [[Jan Gossaert|Jan Gossaert's]] work in the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna]] (illustrated, top right) revisits Van der Weyden's composition while presenting the scene as a visionary experience instead of a directly witnessed portrait sitting.&lt;ref name="olds" /&gt; Later, [[Frans Floris]] (1556), [[Marten de Vos]] (1602) and [[Otto van Veen]] all represented the subject for the guild in Antwerp, and [[Abraham Janssens]] painted an altarpiece for the guild in [[Mechelen]] in 1605.&lt;ref&gt;King (1985): 254–255.&lt;/ref&gt; These paintings are frequently self-portraits with the artist as Luke, and often provide insight into artistic practices from the time when they were made since the subject is of an artist at work.

The term '''historical period drama''' (also '''historical drama''', '''period drama''', '''costume drama''', and '''period piece''') refers to a work set in a past time period, usually used in the context of [[film]] and [[television]]. It is an informal crossover term that can apply to several [[genre]]s and is often heard in the context of [[historical fiction]] and [[romance film|romance]]s, [[adventure film]]s, and [[swashbuckler]]s. A period piece may be set in a vague or general era such as the [[Middle Ages]] or a specific period such as the [[Roaring Twenties]]. A religious work can qualify as period drama but not as historical drama.

==Historical accuracy==
Some works attempt to accurately portray historical events or persons, to the degree that the available historical research and the length of the work will allow. These types of works are also known as [[docudrama]], examples being ''[[Cinderella Man]]'', ''[[Schindler's List]]'', and ''[[Lincoln (film)|Lincoln]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZcGNAQAAQBAJ|title=Inspired by True Events: An Illustrated Guide to More Than 500 History-Based Films, 2nd Edition: An Illustrated Guide to More Than 500 History-Based Films|last=Niemi|first=Robert|date=2013-10-17|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781610691987|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other works are fictionalized stories based on actual people or events, such as ''[[Braveheart]]'' and ''[[Les Misérables (2012 film)|Les Misérables]]''.

[[Paper]], a thin unwoven material made from milled plant fibers, is primarily used for writing, artwork, and packaging; it is commonly white. The first [[papermaking]] process was documented in China during the [[Eastern Han]] period (25–220 CE), traditionally attributed to the court official [[Cai Lun]]. During the 8th century, Chinese papermaking spread to the [[Islamic world]], where [[pulp mill]]s and [[paper mill]]s were used for papermaking and money making. By the 11th century, papermaking was brought to Europe. By the 13th century, papermaking was refined with paper mills utilizing [[waterwheel]]s in Spain. Later European improvements to the papermaking process came in the 19th century with the invention of [[Wood pulp|wood-based]] papers.

Although precursors such as [[papyrus]] and [[amate]] existed in the [[History of the Mediterranean region|Mediterranean world]] and [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian Americas]], respectively, these materials are not defined as true paper. Nor is true [[parchment]] considered paper{{efn|Confusingly, parchment ''paper'' is a treated paper used in baking, and unrelated to true parchment.}}; used principally for writing, parchment is heavily prepared animal skin that predates paper and possibly papyrus. In the twentieth century with the advent of plastic manufacture some plastic "paper" was introduced, as well as paper-plastic laminates, paper-metal laminates, and papers infused or coated with different products that give them special properties. 

==Precursors: papyrus==
[[File:Papyrus.jpg|thumb|right|In contrast to paper, papyrus has an uneven surface that visibly retains the original structure of the ribbon-like strips that make it up. As the papyrus is worked, it tends to break apart along the seams, leading to long linear cracks and eventually falling apart.]]
[[File:Busto maschile.JPG|thumb|[[Roman portraiture]] fresco of a young man with a [[papyrus]] [[scroll]], from [[Herculaneum]], 1st century CE]]
The word "paper" is etymologically derived from ''papyrus'', [[Ancient Greek]] for the ''[[Cyperus papyrus]]'' plant. [[Papyrus]] is a thick, paper-like material produced from the pith of the ''Cyperus papyrus'' plant which was used in [[ancient Egypt]] and other [[History of the Mediterranean region|Mediterranean societies]] for [[History of writing|writing]] long before paper was used in China.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Papyrus
|title=Papyrus definition
| work=Dictionary.com
|accessdate=2008-11-20

|first=
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Papyrus is prepared by cutting off thin ribbon-like strips of the interior of the ''Cyperus papyrus'', and then laying out the strips side-by-side to make a sheet. A second layer is then placed on top, with the strips running at right angle to the first. The two layers are the pounded together into a sheet. The result is very strong, but has an uneven surface, especially at the edges of the strips. When used in scrolls, repeated rolling and unrolling causes the strips to come apart again, typically along vertical lines. This effect can be seen in many ancient papyrus documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paper contrasts with papyrus in that the plant material is broken down through maceration or disintegration before the paper is pressed. This produces a much more even surface, and no natural weak direction in the material which falls apart over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|It is lucky chance that the date of CE 105 was recorded, because Cai Lun, the official involved, who seems to have introduced some improvements in paper manufacture, worked at the palace as a eunuch. Yet just because the new technology was not trumpeted at the time does not mean that it had no effect. On the contrary: up to this point China was lagging behind those Mediterranean societies where papyrus was used and where light, inexpensive scrolls could be created. But thereafter the advantage swung the other way, since papyrus, which is composed of organic material not as highly processed as paper, was prone to splitting and deterioration at a much greater rate; this may be why vellum eventually came to dominate, especially in the harsher climate of Northern Europe. Paper, by contrast, gave a good, uniform writing surface that could be smoothly rolled and unrolled without damage, while remaining relatively durable.{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=34}}|T.H. Barrett}}

Archaeological evidence of [[papermaking]] predates the traditional attribution given to [[Cai Lun]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; an imperial eunuch official of the [[Han dynasty]] (202 BCE – CE 220), thus the exact date or inventor of paper can not be deduced. The earliest extant paper fragment was unearthed at [[Fangmatan]] in [[Gansu]] province, and was likely part of a map, dated to 179–141 BCE.&lt;ref name="buisseret 1998 p12"&gt;
{{Citation|author=David Buisseret|title=Envisaging the City|year=1998|publisher=U Chicago Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gBvl1wHRTX0C|page=12|isbn=978-0-226-07993-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fragments of paper have also been found at Dunhuang dated to 65 BCE and at Yumen pass, dated to 8 BCE.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=908}}

"Cai Lun's" invention, recorded hundreds of years after it took place, is dated to 105 CE. The innovation is a type of paper made of [[mulberry]] and other [[bast fibre]]s along with [[fishing nets]], old rags, and [[hemp]] waste which reduced the cost of paper production, which prior to this, and later, in the West, depended solely on rags.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=908}}&lt;ref&gt;Papermaking.

===Techniques===
During the [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] (1600–1050 BCE) and [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] (1050–256 BCE) dynasties of [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient China]], documents were ordinarily written on bone or [[bamboo]] (on tablets or on bamboo strips sewn and rolled together into scrolls), making them very heavy, awkward, and hard to transport. The light material of [[silk]] was sometimes used as a recording medium, but was normally too expensive to consider. The [[Han dynasty]] Chinese court official [[Cai Lun]] (c. 50–121 CE) is credited as the inventor of a method of papermaking (inspired by wasps and bees) using rags and other plant fibers in 105 CE.{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=34}} However, the discovery of specimens bearing written [[Chinese character]]s in 2006 at [[Fangmatan]] in north-east China's [[Gansu]] Province suggests that paper was in use by the ancient Chinese military more than 100 years before Cai, in 8 BCE, and possibly much earlier as the map fragment found at the Fangmatan tomb site dates from the early 2nd century BCE.&lt;ref name="buisseret 1998 p12"/&gt; It therefore would appear that "Cai Lun's contribution was to improve this skill systematically and scientifically, fix a recipe for papermaking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-08/08/content_4937457.htm|title=eNewsletter|publisher=World Archeological Congress|date=August 2006|accessdate=2010-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The record in the ''[[Twenty-Four Histories]]'' says&lt;ref name=needham&gt;
{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=40}} uses Wade-Giles transcription&lt;/ref&gt;
:In ancient times writings and inscriptions were generally made on tablets of bamboo or on pieces of silk called chih. But silk being costly and bamboos heavy they were not convenient to use. Tshai Lun then initiated the idea of making paper from the bark of trees, remnants of hemp, rags of cloth and fishing nets. He submitted the process to the emperor in the first year of Yuan-Hsing (105 CE) and received praise for his ability. From this time, paper has been in use everywhere and is universally called the paper of Marquis Tshai.

The production process may have originated from the practice of pounding and stirring rags in water, after which the matted fibres were collected on a mat. The bark of [[paper mulberry]] was particularly valued and high quality paper was developed in the late Han period using the bark of ''tan'' (檀; [[sandalwood]]). In the [[Eastern Jin]] period a fine bamboo screen-mould treated with insecticidal dye for permanence was used in papermaking. After [[printing]] was popularized during the [[Song dynasty]] the demand for paper grew substantially. In the year 1101, 1.5 million sheets of paper were sent to the capital.&lt;ref name=needham /&gt;

===Uses===

{{quotation|Open, it stretches; closed, it rolls up. it can be contracted or expanded; hidden away or displayed.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=908}}|Fu Xian}}

Among the earliest known uses of paper was padding and wrapping delicate bronze mirrors according to archaeological evidence dating to the reign of [[Emperor Wu of Han]] from the 2nd century BCE.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 122"&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Padding doubled as both protection for the object as well as the user in cases where poisonous "medicine" were involved, as mentioned in the official history of the period.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 122"/&gt; Although paper was used for writing by the 3rd century CE,&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 1"&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; paper continued to be used for wrapping (and other) purposes. [[Toilet paper]] was used in China from around the late 6th century.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 123"&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 589, the Chinese scholar-official [[Yan Zhitui]] (531–591) wrote: "Paper on which there are quotations or commentaries from [[Five Classics]] or the names of [[Wise old man|sage]]s, I dare not use for toilet purposes".&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 123"/&gt; An [[Arab]] traveler who visited China wrote of the curious Chinese tradition of toilet paper in 851, writing: "...&amp;nbsp;[the Chinese] do not wash themselves with water when they have done their necessities; but they only wipe themselves with paper".&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 123"/&gt;

During the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907) paper was folded and sewn into square bags to preserve the flavor of [[tea]]. In the same period, it was written that tea was served from baskets with multi-colored paper cups and paper napkins of different size and shape.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 122" /&gt; During the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279) the government produced the world's first known paper-printed money, or [[banknote]] (''see [[Jiaozi (currency)|Jiaozi]] and [[Huizi (currency)|Huizi]]''). Paper money was bestowed as gifts to government officials in special paper [[envelope]]s.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 123"/&gt; During the [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271–1368), the first well-documented [[Europeans in Medieval China]], the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] merchant [[Marco Polo]] remarked how the Chinese burned paper [[effigy|effigies]] shaped as male and female servants, camels, horses, suits of clothing and armor while [[Cremation|cremating]] the dead during [[Funerary art|funerary rites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact of paper===
According to Timothy Hugh Barrett, paper played a pivotal role in early Chinese written culture, and a "strong reading culture seems to have developed quickly after its introduction, despite political fragmentation."{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=36}} Indeed the introduction of paper had immense consequences for the book world. It meant books would no longer have to be circulated in small sections or bundles, but in their entirety. Books could now be carried by hand rather than transported by cart. As a result individual collections of literary works increased in the following centuries.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=909}}

Textual culture seems to have been more developed in the south by the early 5th century, with individuals owning collections of several thousand scrolls. In the north an entire palace collection might have been only a few thousand scrolls in total.{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=37}} By the early 6th century, scholars in both the north and south were capable of citing upwards of 400 sources in commentaries on older works.{{sfn|Barret|2008|p=37-38}} A small compilation text from the 7th century included citations to over 1,400 works.{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=38}}

The personal nature of texts was remarked upon by a late 6th century imperial librarian. According to him, the possession of and familiarity with a few hundred scrolls was what it took to be socially accepted as an educated man.{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=39}} 

According to Endymion Wilkinson, one consequence of the rise of paper in China was that "it rapidly began to surpass the Mediterranean empires in book production."{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=908}} During the Tang dynasty, China became the world leader in book production. In addition the gradual spread of [[woodblock printing]] from the late Tang and Song further boosted their lead ahead of the rest of the world.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=935}}

{{quotation|From the fourth century CE to about 1500, the biggest library collections in China were three to four times larger than the largest collections in Europe. The imperial government book collections in the Tang numbered about 5,000 to 6,000 titles (89,000 ''juan'') in 721. The Song imperial collections at their height in the early twelfth century may have risen to 4,000 to 5,000 titles. These are indeed impressive numbers, but the imperial libraries were exceptional in China and their use was highly restricted. Only very few libraries in the Tang and Song held more than one or two thousand titles (a size not even matched by the manuscript collections of the grandest of the great cathedral libraries in Europe).{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=934}}|Endymion Wilkinson}}

However despite the initial advantage afforded to China by the paper medium, by the 9th century its spread and development in the middle east had closed the gap between the two regions. Between the 9th to early 12th centuries, libraries in Cairo, Baghdad, and Cordoba held collections larger than even the ones in China, and dwarfed those in Europe. From about 1500 the maturation of paper making and printing in Southern Europe also had an effect in closing the gap with the Chinese. The Venetian [[Domenico Grimani]]'s collection numbered 15,000 volumes by the time of his death in 1523. After 1600, European collections completely overtook those in China. The Bibliotheca Augusta numbered 60,000 volumes in 1649 and surged to 120,000 in 1666. In the 1720s the Bibliotheque du Roi numbered 80,000 books and the Cambridge University 40,000 in 1715. After 1700, libraries in North America also began to overtake those of China, and toward the end of the century, [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s private collection numbered 4,889 titles in 6,487 volumes. The European advantage only increased further into the 19th century as national collections in Europe and America exceeded a million volumes while a few private collections, such as that of Lord Action, reached 70,000.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=934}}

{{quotation|European book production began to catch up with China after the introduction of the mechanical printing press in the mid fifteenth century. Reliable figures of the number of imprints of each edition are as hard to find in Europe as they are in China, but one result of the spread of printing in Europe was that public and private libraries were able to build up their collections and for the first time in over a thousand years they began to match and then overtake the largest libraries in China.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=935}}|Endymion Wilkinson}}

Paper became central to the three arts of China – poetry, painting, and calligraphy. In later times paper constituted one of the 'Four Treasures of the Scholar's Studio,' alongside the brush, the ink, and the inkstone.{{sfn|Barret|2008|p=40}}

After its origin in central [[China]], the production and use of paper spread steadily. It is clear that paper was used at [[Dunhuang]] by 150 CE, in [[Loulan]] in the modern-day province of [[Xinjiang]] by 200, and in [[Turpan]] by 399.

The oldest known paper document in the West is the [[Mozarab]] [[Missal of Silos]] from the 11th century, probably using paper made in the [[Al-Andalus|Islamic part of the Iberian Peninsula]]. They used [[hemp]] and [[linen]] rags as a source of fiber. The first recorded paper mill in the Iberian Peninsula was in [[Xàtiva]] in 1056.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Leslie Hills: ''Papermaking in Britain 1488–1988: A Short History.''

Papermaking reached [[Europe]] as early as 1085 in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] and was firmly established in [[Xàtiva]], [[Spain]] by 1150.  It is clear that [[France]] had a paper mill by 1190, and by 1276 mills were established in [[Fabriano]], [[Italy]] and in [[Treviso]] and other northern Italian towns by 1340.  Papermaking then spread further northwards, with evidence of paper being made in [[Troyes]], [[France]] by 1348, in [[Holland]] sometime around 1340–1350, in [[Mainz]], [[Germany]] in 1320, and in [[Nuremberg]] by 1390 in a mill set up by [[Ulman Stromer]].&lt;ref name=fuller&gt;{{cite web|last=Fuller|first=Neathery Batsell|title=A Brief history of paper|year=2002|url=http://users.stlcc.edu/nfuller/paper/|accessdate=2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was just about the time when the [[woodcut]] [[printmaking]] technique was transferred from fabric to paper in the [[old master print]] and [[popular prints]]. There was a paper mill in [[Switzerland]] by 1432 and the first mill in [[England]] was set up by [[John Tate (papermaker)|John Tate]] in 1490 near [[Stevenage]] in [[Hertfordshire]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manufactura.cz/historie.htm Historie ručního papíru&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; but the first commercially successful paper mill in [[Great Britain|Britain]] did not occur before 1588 when [[John Spilman]] set up a mill near [[Dartford]] in [[Kent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dartfordarchive.org.uk/technology/paper.shtml|title=Dartford, cradle of Britain's papermaking industry|accessdate=2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During this time, paper making spread to [[Poland]] by 1491, to [[Austria]] by 1498, to [[Russia]] by 1576, to the [[Netherlands]] by 1586, to [[Denmark]] by 1596, and to [[Sweden]] by 1612.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Arab prisoners who settled in a town called [[Borgo Saraceno]] in the Italian [[Province of Ferrara]] introduced [[Fabriano]] artisans in the [[Province of Ancona]]{{huh|date=April 2016}}&lt;!-- is this the wrong Borgo Saraceno? they seem very far apart--&gt; the technique of making paper by hand.  At the time they were renowned for their wool-weaving and manufacture of cloth.  Fabriano papermakers considered the process of making paper by hand an art form and were able to refine the process to successfully compete with parchment which was the primary medium for writing at the time.  They developed the application of stamping hammers to reduce rags to pulp for making paper, [[sizing]] paper by means of [[animal glue]], and creating watermarks in the paper during its forming process. The Fabriano used glue obtained by boiling scrolls or scraps of animal skin to size the paper; it is suggested that this technique was recommended by the local [[tannery|tanneries]]. The introduction of the first European watermarks in Fabriano was linked to applying metal wires on a cover laid against the mould which was used for forming the paper.&lt;ref name="gasparinetti"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10079/bibid/11263265|title=Early Italian papermaking : a crucial technical revolution|last1=Hills|first1=Richard|date=1936|pages=37–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Americas==

[[File:Huex_codex_1a_loc.jpg|thumb|[[Amate]] is similar to modern paper but has a more fibrous texture.]]

In the Americas, archaeological evidence indicates that a similar bark-paper writing material was used by the [[Maya civilization|Maya]]ns no later than the 5th century CE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathcs.duq.edu/~tobin/maya/ The Construction of the Codex In Classic- and post classic-Period Maya Civilization] Maya Codex and Paper Making&lt;/ref&gt; Called ''[[amatl]]'' or ''[[amate]]'', it was in widespread use among [[Mesoamerican]] cultures until the [[Spanish conquest]]. The earliest sample of [[amate]] was found at [[Huitzilapa]] near the [[Magdalena Municipality, Jalisco]], Mexico, belonging to the [[shaft tomb culture]]. It is dated to 75 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Benz, Bruce; Lorenza Lopez Mestas; Jorge Ramos de la Vega (2006). "Organic Offerings, Paper, and Fibers from the Huitzilapa Shaft Tomb, Jalisco, Mexico". Ancient Mesoamerica.== 17 (2). pp. 283–296.&lt;/ref&gt;

The production of amate is much more similar to paper than papyrus. The bark material is soaked in water, or in modern methods [[boiled]], so that it breaks down into a mass of fibres. They are then laid out in a frame and pressed into sheets. It is a true paper product in that the material is not in its original form, but the base material has much larger fibres than those used in modern papers. As a result, amate has a rougher surface than modern paper, and may dry into a sheet with hills and valleys as the different length fibres shrink.

European papermaking spread to the Americas first in [[Mexico]] by 1575 and then in [[Philadelphia]] by 1690.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Paper mills ==
{{Main|Paper mill}}
[[File:Nuremberg chronicles - Nuremberga.png|thumb|left|The [[Nuremberg]] paper mill, the building complex at the lower right corner, in 1493. Due to their noise and smell, paper mills were required by medieval law to be erected outside the city perimeter.]]

The use of human and animal powered mills was known to Chinese and Muslim [[papermaking|papermakers]]. However, evidence for water-powered paper mills is elusive among both prior to the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;Tsien, Tsuen-Hsuin 1985, pp. 68–73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lucas|2005|p=28, fn. 70}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Burns 1996, 414f."&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|1996|pp=414f.}}: {{quote|It has also become universal to talk of paper "mills" (even of 400 such mills at [[Fes|Fez]]!), relating these to the hydraulic wonders of Islamic society in east and west. All our evidence points to non-hydraulic hand production, however, at springs away from rivers which it could pollute.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson 1978, 169"&gt;{{harvnb|Thompson|1978|p=169}}: {{quote|European papermaking differed from its precursors in the mechanization of the process and in the application of water power. [[Jean Gimpel]], in ''The Medieval Machine'' (the English translation of ''La Revolution Industrielle du Moyen Age''), points out that the Chinese and Muslims used only human and animal force. Gimpel goes on to say : "This is convincing evidence of how technologically minded the Europeans of that era were. Paper had traveled nearly halfway around the world, but no culture or civilization on its route had tried to mechanize its manufacture."'}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general absence of the use of water-powered paper mills in Muslim papermaking prior to the 11th century is suggested by the habit of Muslim authors at the time to call a production center not a "mill", but a "paper manufactory".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|1996|pp=414f.}}: {{quote|Indeed, Muslim authors in general call any "paper manufactory" a ''wiraqah'' – not a "mill" (''tahun'')}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Donald Routledge Hill|Donald Hill]] has identified a possible reference to a water-powered [[paper mill]] in [[Samarkand]], in the 11th-century work of the Persian scholar [[Abu Rayhan Biruni]], but concludes that the passage is "too brief to enable us to say with certainty" that it refers to a water-powered paper mill.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=A history of engineering in classical and medieval times|author=[[Donald Routledge Hill]]|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=1996|isbn=0-415-15291-7|pages=169–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is seen by Halevi as evidence of Samarkand first harnessing waterpower in the production of paper, but notes that it is not known if waterpower was applied to papermaking elsewhere across the Islamic world at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Christian Impurity versus Economic Necessity: A Fifteenth-Century Fatwa on European Paper|author=Leor Halevi|journal=[[Speculum (journal)|Speculum]]|year=2008|volume=83|pages=917–945 [917–8]|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|doi=10.1017/S0038713400017073}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burns remains sceptical, given the isolated occurrence of the reference and the prevalence of manual labour in Islamic papermaking elsewhere prior to the 13th century.&lt;ref name="Burns 1996, 414−417"&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|1996|pp=414−417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clear evidence of a water-powered paper mill dates to 1282 in the Spanish [[Kingdom of Aragon]].&lt;ref name="Burns 1996, 417f."&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|1996|pp=417f.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A decree by the Christian king [[Peter III of Aragon|Peter III]] addresses the establishment of a royal "[[Watermill|molendinum]]", a proper hydraulic mill, in the paper manufacturing centre of [[Xàtiva]].&lt;ref name="Burns 1996, 417f."/&gt; The crown innovation was operated by the Muslim [[Mudéjar]] community in the [[Moorish]] quarter of Xàtiva,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Medieval Science, Technology, and Medicine: An Encyclopedia|author=[[Thomas F.

The first paper mill north of the Alps was established in [[Nuremberg]] by [[Ulman Stromer]] in 1390; it is later depicted in the lavishly illustrated ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stromer|1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the mid-14th century onwards, European paper milling underwent a rapid improvement of many work processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stromer|1993|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the industrialisation of the paper production the most common fibre source was recycled fibres from used textiles, called rags. The rags were from [[hemp]], [[linen]] and [[cotton]].&lt;ref name=PST1&gt;{{Citation |last1=Göttsching|first1=Lothar|authorlink1= |last2=Pakarinen |first2=Heikki |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title=Recycled Fiber and Deinking|url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= Papermaking Science and Technology |volume= 7 |date= |year= 2000|month= |origyear= |publisher= Fapet Oy|location= Finland|isbn= 952-5216-07-1 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= 12–14 |chapter= 1|chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A process for removing printing inks from [[recycled paper]] was invented by German jurist [[Justus Claproth]] in 1774.&lt;ref name=PST1 /&gt; Today this method is called [[deinking]]. It was not until the introduction of [[wood pulp]] in 1843 that paper production was not dependent on recycled materials from [[ragpicker]]s.&lt;ref name=PST1 /&gt;

==19th-century advances in papermaking==
Although cheaper than vellum, paper remained expensive, at least in book-sized quantities, through the centuries, until the advent of steam-driven paper making machines in the 19th century, which could make paper with [[fibres]] from [[wood pulp]]. Although older machines predated it, the [[Fourdrinier machine|Fourdrinier]] papermaking machine became the basis for most modern papermaking. [[Robert brothers|Nicholas Louis Robert]] of [[Essonnes]], [[France]], was granted a patent for a continuous paper making machine in 1799. At the time he was working for [[Leger Didot]] with whom he quarrelled over the ownership of the invention. Didot sent his brother-in-law, John Gamble, to meet  Sealy and [[Henry Fourdrinier]], stationers of [[London]], who agreed to finance the project. Gamble was granted British [[patent]] 2487 on 20 October 1801. With the help particularly of [[Bryan Donkin]], a skilled and ingenious mechanic, an improved version of the Robert original was installed at [[Frogmore Paper Mill]], [[Hertfordshire]], in 1803, followed by another in 1804. A third machine was installed at the Fourdriniers' own mill at [[Two Waters]]. The Fourdriniers also bought a mill at [[St Neots]] intending to install two machines there and the process and machines continued to develop.

However, experiments with wood showed no real results in the late 18th century and at the start of the 19th century. By 1800, [[Matthias Koops]] (in London, England) further investigated the idea of using wood to make paper, and in 1801 he wrote and published a book titled ''Historical account of the substances which have been used to describe events, and to convey ideas, from the earliest date, to the invention of paper.''&lt;ref&gt;Koops, Matthias. Historical account of the substances which have been used to describe events, and to convey ideas, from the earliest date, to the invention of paper. London: Printed by T. Burton, 1800.&lt;/ref&gt; His book was printed on paper made from wood shavings (and adhered together). No pages were fabricated using the pulping method (from either rags or wood). He received financial support from the royal family to make his printing machines and acquire the materials and infrastructure needed to start his printing business. But his enterprise was short lived. Only a few years following his first and only printed book (the one he wrote and printed), he went bankrupt. The book was very well done (strong and had a fine appearance), but it was very costly.&lt;ref&gt;Carruthers, George. Paper in the Making. Toronto: The Garden City Press Co-Operative, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthew, H.C.G. and Brian Harrison. "Koops. Matthias." Oxford Dictionary of National Biography: from the earliest times to the year 2000, Vol. 32. London: Oxford University Press, 2004: 80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burger, Peter. Charles Fenerty and his Paper Invention. Toronto: Peter Burger, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-9783318-1-8}} pp.30–32&lt;/ref&gt;

Then in the 1830s and 1840s, two men on two different continents took up the challenge, but from a totally new perspective. Both [[Friedrich Gottlob Keller]] and [[Charles Fenerty]] began experiments with wood but using the same technique used in paper making; instead of pulping rags, they thought about pulping wood. And at about the same time, by mid-1844, they announced their findings. They invented a machine which extracted the fibres from wood (exactly as with rags) and made paper from it. Charles Fenerty also bleached the pulp so that the paper was white. This started a new era for paper making. By the end of the 19th-century almost all printers in the [[western world]] were using wood in lieu of rags to make paper.&lt;ref&gt;Burger, Peter. Charles Fenerty and his Paper Invention. Toronto: Peter Burger, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-9783318-1-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with the invention of the practical [[fountain pen]] and the mass-produced [[pencil]] of the same period, and in conjunction with the advent of the steam driven rotary [[printing press]], wood based paper caused a major transformation of the 19th century economy and society in industrialized countries. With the introduction of cheaper paper, schoolbooks, fiction, non-fiction, and newspapers became gradually available by 1900. Cheap wood based paper also meant that keeping personal diaries or writing letters became possible and so, by 1850, the [[clerk (position)|clerk]], or writer, ceased to be a high-status job.

The original wood-based paper was acidic due to the use of [[alum]] and more prone to disintegrate over time, through processes known as [[slow fires]]. Documents written on more expensive rag paper were more stable. Mass-market paperback books still use these cheaper mechanical papers (see below), but book publishers can now use [[acid-free paper]] for [[hardback]] and [[Paperback#Trade paperback|trade paperback]] books.

==Determining provenance==
Determining the provenance of paper is a complex process that can be done in a variety of ways.  The easiest way is using a known sheet of paper as an exemplar.  Using known sheets can produce an exact identification.  Next, comparing watermarks with those contained in catalogs or trade listings can yield useful results.  Inspecting the surface can also determine age and location by looking for distinct marks from the production process.  Chemical and fiber analysis can be used to establish date of creation and perhaps location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Book: A Global History|first1=Michael F.|last1= Suarez, S.J.| last2=Woudhuysen|first2=H.R.|isbn=9780199679416|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sbacAQAAQBAJ|year=2013|publisher=OUP Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7840">The '''Indonesia Project''' is a center of research and graduate training on the [[Indonesian economy]] at the [[Australian National University]] (ANU). It is located in the Arndt-Corden Department of Economics, [[Crawford School of Public Policy]], part of the [[ANU]] College of Asia and the Pacific in Canberra. It was established in 1965 with an initial grant from the [[Ford Foundation]].

== History ==
In 1963, when he became head of the Department of Economics in the Research School of Pacific Studies, Professor [[Heinz Wolfgang Arndt|Heinz W. Arndt]] decided to devote substantial resources from the new department to the study of the Indonesian economy.  He worked to recruit research fellows and doctoral students, established a relationship with numerous Indonesian institutions and international academics, and initiated a publication program. These initiatives quickly matured into the ''Indonesia Project''. As part of the activities of the project, the academic journal '''''Bulletin of Indonesian Economic Studies''''' ('''''BIES''''') was established in 1965. Several academic staff were recruited to work on the Indonesian economy including Dr David Penny and Professor {{ill|Panglaykim|id|J. Panglaykim}}.  Among the young scholars awarded scholarships to work on various aspects of Indonesian economy shortly after the establishment of the project were Anne Booth, Howard Dick, Stephen Grenville, Hal Hill, Chris Manning, Peter McCawley and Phyllis Rosendale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCawley|first=Peter|author2=colleagues|title=Heinz Arndt: An Appreciation|journal=Bulletin of Indonesian Economic Studies|date=August 2002|volume=38|issue=2|pages=163–178|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/000749102320145039|accessdate=11 May 2011|doi=10.1080/000749102320145039}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
The Indonesia Project has sponsored many activities related to studies of the Indonesian economy since the mid-1960s. These include the following:

* Support for the [http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/cbie20/current ''Bulletin of Indonesian Economic Studies (BIES)''], published three times each year. Professor Arndt was the editor of the BIES from 1965 to 1980. His successors as editor were Professors Anne Booth and Hal Hill and Associate Professors Ross McLeod and Pierre van der Eng. The current editors are Associate Professors Blane Lewis and Arianto Patunru.
* The [http://crawford.anu.edu.au/acde/ip/update/ Indonesia Update] conference, held annually at the ANU since 1983.&lt;ref&gt;For a report on the 2001 conference, see Carla Bianpoen, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2001/10/10/do-women-provide-a-different-leadership.html Do women provide a different leadership?'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 10 October 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [http://crawford.anu.edu.au/acde/ip/seminars/ Indonesia Study Group] at the ANU which meets around 40 times each year to discuss a wide range of topics relating to Indonesian studies.
* The [http://www.crawford.anu.edu.au/acde/ip/lpem/ Forum Kajian Pembangunan] (Development Studies Forum) which is a series of regular Jakarta seminars held with partner agencies to discuss development issues.
* Support for active links with scholarly institutions in Indonesia such as the [[Centre for Strategic and International Studies (Indonesia)|''Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS)'']], the [http://www.fe.ui.ac.id/index.php/lembaga-feui/lpem Lembaga Penyelidikan Ekonomi dan Masyarakat] (Institute for Social and Economic Research) at the Economics Faculty, University of Indonesia, the [http://www.smeru.or.id/ SMERU] research institute, and the Economics Faculty, [[Gadjah Mada University]], in Yogyakarta.
* The annual [[Mohamad Sadli|Sadli]] Memorial Lecture in Jakarta.
* The [http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/blogs/indonesiaproject/about/Indonesia Indonesia Project] blog.
*A wide range of other meetings and conferences, both at the ANU, at other universities in Australia and Indonesia, and with public and private organisations in Australia in Indonesia.
*An active program of public outreach; staff and students in the project often contribute to media comment in Australia and overseas, and often provide blog commentary on current developments in Indonesia.

During the early years after the Indonesia Project was established, the main activities focused on economic issues in Indonesia. Later, and especially after Professor J.A.C. Mackie&lt;ref&gt;Thee Kian Wie, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/05/06/prof-jamie-mackie-a-forceful-advocate-close-indonesia-australia-relations.html Prof. Jamie Mackie, a forceful advocate for close Indonesia-Australia relations'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 6 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; became head of the Department of Political and Social Change at the ANU in 1980, the activities of the Indonesia project widened to include issues in other areas such as politics, government, social studies, and a range of other topics.  Senior staff of the Department of Political and Social Change such as Professor Ed Aspinall and Associate Professor Greg Fealy, and of the School of Culture, History and Language at the ANU such as Dr Marcus Mietzner and Professor Kathryn Robinson, are now involved with Indonesia Project events.

The Indonesia Project has an active policy of working in close partnership with Indonesian colleagues.  Well-known Indonesian scholars and public policy makers who have worked with the project since the mid-1960s include Professor [[Armida Alisjahbana]], Professor [[Boediono]], Dr [[Hadi Soesastro]], Dr [[Muhamad Chatib Basri]], Professor [[Mari Pangestu]], Professor Panglaykim, Professor Mubyarto, Professor [[Mohamad Sadli]], Dr [[Sri Mulyani Indrawati]], and Dr [[Thee Kian Wie]].

== Management of the Project ==
Professor Arndt led the Indonesia Project from its inception until 1980.&lt;ref&gt;For a review of some of the work of the Indonesia Project during the period of Arndt's leadership, see Thee Kian Wie, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2002/05/18/in-memoriam-prof-arndt-a-great-friend-indonesia.html In Memoriam: Prof. Arndt, a great friend to Indonesia'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 18 May 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Peter McCawley took over management from 1980 to 1986, followed by Professor Hal Hill from 1986 to 1998. Associate Professor Chris Manning led the Project from 1998 to 2011. Associate Professor Budy Resosudarmo is the current Head of the Indonesia Project. Dr Robert Sparrow is the Project's Research Coordinator and Dr Arianto Patunru is the Project's Policy Engagement Coordinator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Indonesia Project Annual Reports (1980), (1985), (1998), (2012) |publisher=Indonesia Project|location=Canberra}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Project has received strong external funding support from both the [http://www.dfat.gov.au/ Australian Department of Foreign Affairs (DFAT)] and [[AusAID]] for many years. Staff of the Indonesia Project cooperate closely with [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|DFAT]] staff in both Canberra and in [http://www.indonesia.embassy.gov.au/jakt/cooperation.html Jakarta].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9788">The '''Jukes family''' was a [[New York (state)|New York]] "hill family" studied in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  The studies are part of a series of other family studies, including the [[Kallikaks]], the Zeros and the Nams, that were often quoted as arguments in support of [[eugenics]], though the original Jukes study, by [[Richard L. Dugdale]], placed considerable emphasis on the environment as a determining factor in criminality, disease and poverty ([[euthenics]]).

==Harris' reports==
Elisha Harris, a doctor and former president of the American Public Health Association, published reports that Margaret, in Upstate New York, was the "mother of criminals" and he described her children as "a race of criminals, paupers and harlots".

==Dugdale's study ==

He studied the records of inmates of the thirteen county jails in [[New York State]], as well as poorhouses and courts, while researching the New York hill family's ancestry in an effort to find the basis for their criminality.  His book claimed Max, a frontiersman who was the descendant of early Dutch settlers and who was born between 1720 and 1740,&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; had been the ancestor of more than 76 convicted criminals, 18 brothel-keepers, 120 prostitutes, over 200 relief recipients, and 2 cases of "feeble-mindedness".&lt;ref name=keely&gt;{{Citation

Many of the criminals could also be linked to "Margaret, the Mother of Criminals", renamed "Ada" in his report, who had married one of Max's sons.&lt;ref name=vergano/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;  Dugdale created detailed genealogical charts and concluded that poverty, disease, and criminality plagued the family.  Dugdale estimated to the [[New York legislature]] that the family had cost the state $1,308,000. He published his findings in ''The Jukes: A Study in Crime, Pauperism, Disease and Heredity'' in 1877.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;
Dugdale debated the relative contribution of environment and heredity and concluded that the family's poor environment was largely to blame for their behavior:  "environment tends to produce habits which may become hereditary" (page 66). He noted that the Jukes were not a single family, but a composite of 42 families and that only 540 of his 709 subjects were apparently related by blood.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

He urged public welfare changes and improvements in the environment in order to prevent criminality, poverty and disease, writing: "public health and infant education... are the two legs upon which the general morality of the future must travel"(page 119).&lt;ref name="keely" /&gt; The book was widely read in the nineteenth century and stimulated discussion about the roles of heredity and environment.&lt;ref name =estabrook&gt;{{Citation

Legal historian [[Paul A. Lombardo]] states that very soon the Jukes family study was turned into a "genetic morality tale" which combined religious notions of the sins of the father and eugenic pseudoscience.&lt;ref name=vergano/&gt;

==Estabrook's study==
A follow-up study was published by Arthur H. Estabrook of the [[Eugenics Record Office]] at [[Cold Spring Harbor, New York]] in 1916 as ''The Jukes in 1915''.  Estabrook noted that Dugdale's conclusions were that the 1877 study "does not demonstrate the inheritance of criminality, pauperism, or harlotry, but it does show that heredity with certain environmental conditions determines criminality, harlotry, and pauperism".&lt;ref name =estabrook/&gt;  Estabrook reanalyzed Dugdale's data and updated it to include 2,820 persons, adding   2,111 Jukes to the 709 studied by Dugdale.  He claimed that the living Jukes were costing the public at least $2 million.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

Estabrook's data suggested that the family had actually shown fewer problems over time, but he pronounced that the Jukes family were  "unredeemed" and suffering from just as much "feeblemindedness, indolence, licentiousness and dishonesty" as they had been in the past.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; Strongly emphasizing heredity, Estabrook's conclusions reversed Dugdale's argument about the environment, proposing that such families be prevented from reproducing, since no amount of environmental changes could alter their genetic inheritance towards criminality.&lt;ref name="keely"/&gt;

Photographs of members of the Jukes family and their homes as well as family trees of some branches of the Jukes family were displayed at the Second International Congress of Eugenics, held at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York City in 1921.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; 
Historians have noted that Dugdale's conclusions have been misused by subsequent generations: "Estabrook's version is the one that carried the day. After 1915, the Jukes cames to symbolize the futility of social change and the need for eugenic segregations and sterilization".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

American scientists, doctors, politicians, clergy and the legal profession all embraced the eugenic movement, and the Jukes family research was used as evidence in [[Buck v. Bell]] a 1927 [[US Supreme Court]] case which made forced sterilizations legal in the United States.&lt;ref name=vergano/&gt;  In the 1930s eugenics was widely repudiated by geneticists, and after the Nazi World War II eugenics program became known, its influence died out.&lt;ref name=vergano/&gt;

==Further research==
Research in the 1960s pointed out fundamental problems with the studies, such as the subjects were not one family and not necessarily related. In addition, the attempt to link a trait such as poverty to genetic makeup, ignoring environmental issues, has been "totally discredited", as noted by geneticist Andrés Ruiz Linares in a 2011 historical review.&lt;ref name=vergano/&gt;

In 2001 a [[poorhouse]] graveyard was discovered in [[New Paltz]], in Ulster County. Some of the unmarked graves belonged to members of the so-called Jukes family. Further information was found in the archives at the [[State University of New York at Albany]] and in records of a forgotten Ulster County poorhouse. A code book, labeled "classified", was found and listed the real surnames of the "Jukes" family.  Hundreds of names were listed, including Plough, Miller, DuBois, Clearwater, Bank and Bush. Max, the "founder", was identified as Max Keyser.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;
However, "the mythology of so-called 'genetically problematic families' is still with us," said Paul A. Lombardo of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at the University of Virginia. "Even today, the Jukeses seem to be getting a third life on the Internet as we see some religious and political groups invoking them as examples of inherited immorality."&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

'''Mesohabitat simulation model (MesoHABSIM)''', created by Dr. [[Piotr Parasiewicz]] addresses the requirements of [[Drainage basin|watershed]]-based management of running waters and is designed to predict an aquatic community's response to [[habitat]] modification.

== Overview ==

'''MesoHABSIM''' builds upon pre-existing physical habitat simulation models (e.g. PHABSIM) which is an essential component of the United States government's methods for establishing minimum [[stream flow]] requirements. 
MesoHABSIM is an augmentation of this system, designed during a restoration study of the [[Quinebaug River]].&lt;ref&gt;Northeast Instream Habitat Program. Northeast Instream Habitat Program – Quinbaug River 10 November. 2008. {{cite web |url=http://neihp.org/projects/quinebaug/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725063409/http://www.neihp.org/projects/quinebaug/index.htm |archivedate=25 July 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The changing spatial distributions of physical attributes of a river as a result of variations in flow and the biological responses of aquatic species to these changes, provide the basis for simulating the consequences of [[ecosystem]] alteration, and consequently the justification of restoration measures. MesoHABSIM modifies the data acquisition technique and analytical approach of similar models by changing the scale of resolution from micro- to meso-scales. Due to this increase in scale, the model takes variations in stream morphology along the river into account and allows for application in larger-scale projects.

== Data collection and analysis ==

Mesohabitat types are defined by their hydromorphological units (HMUs), such as pools and [[rapids]], [[geomorphology]], [[land cover]] and other [[hydrological]] characteristics. Mesohabitats are mapped under multiple flow conditions at extensive sites along the river. Fish data is collected in randomly distributed mesohabitats where habitat surveys are also conducted. This allows modeling of available fish habitat at a range of flows. Rating curves represent the changes in relative area of suitable habitat in response to flow and allow for the determination of habitat quantity at any given flow within the range of surveys. These rating curves can be developed for river units of any size allowing conclusions to be drawn about the suitability of channel patterns or habitat structures for various species of fish for specific sections as well as for the entire river. Rating curves can also be used to evaluate the benefits of various restoration measures on the entire fish community. In combination with hydrologic time series, rating curves are used to create Continuous Under Threshold (CUT) curves for the analysis of frequency, magnitude and duration of significant habitat events. The CUT curve technique described by Capra et al. (1995)&lt;ref&gt;Capra, H., B. Pascal, and Y. Souchon. 1995. A new tool to interpret magnitude and duration of fish habitat variations. Regulated Rivers: Research and Management. 10: 281–289.&lt;/ref&gt;  defines critical thresholds and determines what habitat variability and availability is necessary to support the target river [[fauna]]. CUT curves evaluate durations of unsuitable habitat under a specified threshold by comparing continuous durations in days under this threshold to the cumulative durations in the study period. A highly useful product of the CUT curves are reference tables that can be used to determine how long a given species can tolerate unsuitable conditions depending on its life stage.

== Results ==

To use physical habitat models to analyze and predict ecosystem potential, compositions must also be determined of the native fish community and a subset of species must be selected for model development. The development of a Reference Fish Community (RFC) is based on the Target Fish Community approach, described by Bain and Meixler (2000).&lt;ref&gt;Meixler. 2000. Defining a Target Fish Community for Planning and Evaluating Enhancement on the Quinebaug River in Massachusetts and Connecticut. Report for Quinebaug River Study Agencies. [[Cornell University]], Ithaca, NY&lt;/ref&gt; A comprehensive list of species is generated from literature sources and available regional data collected on relatively intact river reaches. The species are ranked on the basis of abundance in long-term fish collection data from multiple rivers of similar character. Securing habitat for naturally occurring [[dominant species (ecology)]] should preserve the most profound characteristics of the ecosystem, providing survival conditions for the majority of the aquatic community and therefore a reference for restoration efforts. The simplest way to create a river habitat model is therefore to select the five to ten highest ranking species for model development. It can then be assumed that community structure reflects habitat structure; therefore, the most common species should indicate the most common habitat. Since habitat availability forms the structure of aquatic fauna, the affinity between the structure of the river habitat and the structure of the fish community can be used as a measure of habitat quality.

The results of MesoHABSIM creates the framework for integrative analysis of many aspects of the ecosystem. It also allows managers to recreate reference conditions and evaluate possible instream and watershed restoration measures or alterations (such as dam removals or changes in water withdrawals). From the perspective of resource managers, it not only allows for quantitative measures of ecological integrity, but also creates a basis for making decisions where trade-offs between resource use and river restoration need to be considered.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12863">The '''Montreal Institute for Genocide and Human Rights Studies''' ('''MIGS''') is a [[research institute]] based at [[Concordia University (Quebec)|Concordia University]] in [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]], Canada. It was founded in 1986 and promotes [[human rights]] awareness, in the field of [[genocide]] and mass atrocities by hosting frequent events, publishing policy briefs, engaging in counter activism on the web, and many other programs. Its keystone project is the Will to Intervene ([[W2I]]) Project which, under the advisement of Lt. General [[Roméo Dallaire]] and MIGS' Director Frank Chalk, builds domestic political will in Canada and the [[United States]] to prevent future mass atrocities.

== About ==
The Montreal Institute for Genocide and Human Rights Studies (MIGS) is recognized internationally as Canada’s leading research and advocacy Institute for genocide and mass atrocity crimes prevention, MIGS conducts in-depth scholarly research and proposes concrete policy recommendations to resolve conflicts before they degenerate into mass atrocity crimes. MIGS has achieved national and international recognition for its national interest approach to the prevention of genocide and mass atrocity crimes from policymakers, academics, leading research institutes, and the media. Today, MIGS is Canada’s leading voice and international partner on Responsibility to Protect issues.

== Mission ==
MIGS has the following stated goals:
* Develop major research programs focusing on the prevention and punishment of genocide and other mass atrocity crimes.
* Collect and disseminate research results to specialist professionals and to the wider public.
* Create and advocate for innovative public policies to prevent future mass atrocities.
* Educate students, academics, journalists, government officials, civil society groups, and the wider public on threats to the national interest arising from genocide and mass atrocity crimes.
* Provide  professional training and build mass atrocity awareness and prevention capacity of international and national leaders in key fields
* Develop and foster fruitful relationships and networks at the local, national and international levels by working in collaboration with leading organizations, institutions and research institutes.

== History ==
The institute was founded by Dr Frank Chalk, a professor in the history department and the late Dr Kurt Jonassohn in 1986. The institute’s current focus is on its Will to Intervene Project, which is led by Kyle Matthews, a former Canadian diplomat, and MIGS' current Senior Deputy Director. Lt. Gen (retired) The Honourable [[Roméo Dallaire]] has been a Senior Fellow at MIGS since 2006 and cofounded the [[W2I]] Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cjournal.concordia.ca/journalarchives/2006-07/sept_14/007524.shtml |title=Roméo Dallaire named Senior Fellow |publisher=Cjournal.concordia.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; MIGS also has a large number of [[intern]]s who assist with MIGS' initiatives and projects. In recent years, Concordia faculty members and graduate students from Communications, English, Geography, and Political Science have joined in its work, as have colleagues from McGill and the University of Quebec in Montreal.

MIGS develops and manages major research programs focused on the prevention of genocide and [[crimes against humanity]], educates comparatively about genocide, the [[Responsibility to protect]], and helps survivors and their children end their isolation by building bridges with other survivors of genocide and mass [[War crime|atrocity]] crimes.&lt;ref name="Chalk, Frank 2010 p. 189"&gt;Chalk, Frank, Dallaire, Roméo, Matthews, Kyle, Barqueiro, Carla and Doyle, Simon, "Mobilizing the Will to Intervene: Leadership to Prevent Mass Atrocities" (McGill Queens University Press, Montreal:2010), p. 189&lt;/ref&gt;

Drawing on its research, MIGS aims to further understandings of the history, sociology and international legal frameworks pertaining to genocide, crimes against humanity, and [[Conflict resolution|reconciliation]] in their wake. MIGS advances these goals by organising [[workshop]]s and [[Academic conference|conference]]s, sponsoring [[lecture]]s, issuing reports, preparing books and articles, and training students who specialise in genocide studies at undergraduate, masters and doctoral levels. MIGS works locally, nationally and internationally to educate members of the public, the media, and government.&lt;ref name="Chalk, Frank 2010 p. 189"/&gt;

==Initiatives and projects==
Over the years, MIGS has developed a number of [[research]] initiatives and projects which aim to collect and disseminate knowledge about the historical origins of [[mass murder|mass killings]], and seeking to prevent future atrocities of this kind. The staff also produce a number of articles fitting within the scope of each project.[https://www.concordia.ca/research/migs/news/media.html]

=== Will to Intervene (W2I) ===
The Will to Intervene Project (W2I) is MIGS primary project.[https://www.concordia.ca/research/migs/projects/will-to-intervene.html] It was started by Director Frank Chalk and Lt. General Roméo Dallaire as an effort to create domestic building domestic political will in Canada and the United States to prevent future mass atrocities.[https://www.concordia.ca/content/dam/artsci/research/migs/w2i/docs/T11-5602-ARSC-MIGSPamphletCanada-v4-1.pdf][https://www.concordia.ca/content/dam/artsci/research/migs/w2i/docs/T11-5601-ARSC-MIGSPamphletUS-v4-1.pdf] It also aims to understand how to mobilize domestic political will in order to prevent or halt genocide and mass atrocities.&lt;ref name="Chalk, Frank 2010 p. 189"/&gt;

The W2I team works to advance [[public policy]] on mass atrocity crimes prevention through the education and training of policymakers, elected officials, diplomats, journalists and civil society groups. W2I organises conferences, policy briefings, specialized training sessions and civic dialogues to generate awareness and understanding of what policies can be put in place to make "never again" a reality.

W2I's ground-breaking 2009 policy report, ''Mobilizing The Will To Intervene: Leadership and Action to Prevent Mass Atrocities,'' contains concrete policy recommendations for the governments of Canada and of the United States, as well as recommendations for journalists and [[Civil Society Organization|civil society]] groups, which will advance this goal. Based on 80 interviews carried out with high level [[Canadians|Canadian]] and [[United States|American]] [[Politician|policymakers]] it details the long term consequences to Canadian and American security, public health and prosperity that result from mass atrocities, which make engaging in the prevention of such atrocities in each county's national interest.&lt;ref name="w2i"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://migs.concordia.ca/W2I/the_report.htm |title=the_report |publisher=Migs.concordia.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later published as a book in 2010 by [[McGill-Queens University Press]].

=== Digital Mass Atrocity (DMAP) Lab ===
The Digital Mass Atrocity Prevention Lab (DMAP Lab) is a policy hub working to combat genocidal ideologies online and work as a counter force against extremists and their ideas.[https://www.concordia.ca/research/migs/projects/dmap.html] In our modern times, social media enables [[terrorist]] groups to disseminate propaganda, advertise their crimes, incite [[violence]], radicalize and persuade disenfranchised young adults to join their hateful cause. The project asks what governments, international organizations, [[Civil Society Organization|civil society]] groups and individual citizens can do to counter online extremism as the fight against religious extremism increasingly takes place in cyberspace.

==== Goals of the DMAP Lab ====
* Analyze key actors and drivers of online [[extremism]] and radicalization
* Develop tools and strategies to counter extremists who use social media and other digital technologies as a weapon of war
* Propose policy recommendations to governments, [[NGOs]], [[United Nations|UN]] agencies and other stakeholders
* Provide specialized training and policy advice
* Bring together policymakers, journalists, academics, tech expects, human rights activists and community leaders to create a global network as a force for good

=== Media Monitoring Project ===
The Media Monitoring Project is intended to provide early warnings of genocide, crimes against humanity, ethnic cleansing, and serious war crimes by monitoring the domestic news media (newspapers, radio, television and online sources) in at risk countries.[https://www.concordia.ca/research/migs/projects/media-monitoring.html] It also seeks to inform policy makers, academics, NGO workers and students about what government-owned media in countries at risk tell their people in their own language. In order to get the best understanding of the situation and provide an overall account of what the people on the ground are being told, the project covers both government-owned and privately owned domestic media.

This project monitors the domestic media, both government owned and privately owned, in high priority countries such as [[Sudan]], [[Cote d'Ivoire]], [[Somalia]] and the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] in order to act as an early warning system to help prevent genocide and mass atrocity crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://migs.concordia.ca/Media_Monitoring/Media_Monitoring_Reports.html |title=MIGS: The Montreal Institute for Genocide and Human Rights Studies |publisher=Migs.concordia.ca |date=2007-05-15 |accessdate=2011-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Professional Training Program on the Prevention of Mass Atrocities ===
Organized in cooperation with the Human Rights Research and Education Centre, this program is tailored to mid- to senior-level professionals interested in the prevention and interdiction of mass atrocity crimes. It is a two to three day conference, which includes workshops, guest speakers and panel discussions. The training program is divided into several thematic sessions presented by internationally recognized experts in the field of human rights and international affairs,

==== Aim of the program ====
* Providing participants with opportunities to deepen their knowledge
* Providing participants with opportunities to hone their skills through training sessions on topics including international law, the [[Responsibility to protect|Responsibility to Protect]], [[Boko Haram]], [[Military use of children|child soldiers]], and humanitarian affairs. MIGS works with instructors from the [[Child Soldiers Initiative]], the [[Parliament of Canada|Canadian Parliament]], the [[Canadian Armed Forces|Canadian Forces]], and more
* Providing participants with networking opportunities to expand their contacts, to identify new partnerships, and to broaden their knowledge
* Encouraging participants to consider the intersection of their work with other human rights issues

=== The Raoul Wallenberg Legacy of Leadership Project ===
With funding from the Swedish Institute ([[Svenska Institutet]]), MIGS organized a series of events to increase awareness among youth and the general public about the Swedish diplomat [[Raoul Wallenberg]], who is accredited with rescuing the lives of up to one hundred thousand Jews during the [[World War II|Second World War]] in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]].[http://www.raoulwallenberglegacy.org/]

=== Memoirs of Holocaust Survivors in Canada ===
The project to collect unpublished diaries and memoirs written by Holocaust survivors in Canada was initiated some years ago by Professors Mervin Butovsky and Kurt Jonassohn.[https://www.concordia.ca/research/migs/projects/holocaust-memoirs.html] They thought it important that these documents be preserved as a valuable part of the historical record because their contents would differ in significant ways from interview testimonies. Some of these differences are explored in a paper.

The collected manuscripts were deposited in the Archives of Concordia University with the addition of an abstract and a list of key words with explanations. The location of towns and villages was ascertained by consulting standard reference works. The location of camps was facilitated by consulting Weinmann who identifies over 2,000 camps. These memoirs are now accessible to interested scholars by consulting the Concordia University Archives.

The abstracts and key words of all of the manuscripts collected to date are available.[http://migs.concordia.ca/memoirs.html]

'''Neo-conceptual art''' describes art practices in the 1980s and particularly 1990s to date that derive from the [[conceptual art]] movement of the 1960s and 1970s.  These subsequent initiatives have included the [[Moscow Conceptualists]], United States neo-conceptualists such as [[Sherrie Levine]] and the [[Young British Artists]], notably [[Damien Hirst]] and [[Tracey Emin]] in the [[United Kingdom]], where there is also a [[Stuckism]] counter-movement and criticism from the 1970s conceptual art group [[Art and Language]].

==History==

[[File:Neon-bolognini.JPG|thumb|right|170 px|[[Maurizio Bolognini]]'s ''Programmed Machines'' (''Sealed'')  hundreds of computers are programmed to generate endless flows of random images which nobody would see. &lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Many of the concerns of the "conceptual art" movement proper have been taken up by many contemporary artists since the initial wave of conceptual artists. While many of these artists may not term themselves "conceptual artists", ideas such as anti-commodification, social and/or political critique, [[digital art]], and ideas/information as medium continue to be aspects of contemporary art, especially among artists working with [[computer art]], [[installation art]], [[performance art]], [[net.art]] and [[electronic art]]. Many critics and artists may speak of conceptual aspects of a given artist or art work, reflecting the enduring influence that many of the original conceptual artists have had on the art world.

==New York City==
The idea of neo-conceptual art (sometimes later termed [[post-conceptual art]]) in the United States was clearly articulated by [[Tricia Collins]] and [[Richard Milazzo]] (working as a team called: Collins &amp; Milazzo) in the early 1980s in New York City,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/19/arts/art-now-on-view-new-work-by-freelance-curators.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm ART; Now on View, New Work by Freelance Curators]&lt;/ref&gt; when they brought to prominence a whole new generation of artists through their copious writings and curatorial activity. It was their exhibitions and writings that originally fashioned the theoretical context for a new kind of neo (or post) conceptual art; one that argued simultaneously against [[Neo-Expressionism]] and Picture-Theory Art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/DAN+CAMERON+ON+Collins+%26+Milazzo.-a057475774] DAN CAMERON ON Collins &amp; Milazzo&lt;/ref&gt; It was through this context that the work of many of the artists associated with Neo-Conceptualism (or what some of the critics reductively called “Simulationism” and “Neo Geo”) was first brought together: artists such as [[Ross Bleckner]], [[James Welling]], [[Steven Parrino]], [[Richard Prince]], [[Peter Nagy (artist)|Peter Nagy]], [[Joseph Nechvatal]], [[Sarah Charlesworth]], [[Mark Innerst]], [[Allan McCollum]], [[Peter Halley]], [[Jonathan Lasker]], [[Haim Steinbach]], [[Philip Taaffe]], [[Robert Gober]] and [[Saint Clair Cemin]].

==Moscow==
The [[Moscow Conceptualists]], in the 1970s and 80s, attempted to subvert socialist ideology using the strategies of [[conceptual art]] and [[appropriation art]]. The central figures were [[Ilya Kabakov]] and [[Komar and Melamid]]. The group also included [[Eric Bulatov]] and [[Viktor Pivovarov]].

==London==
The [[Young British Artists]] (YBAs), led by [[Damien Hirst]], came to prominence in the 1990s and their work was described at the time as neo-conceptual,&lt;ref&gt;Scott Lash and Celia Lury, ''Global Culture Industries: The Mediation of Things'', Polity, 2007, p211. {{ISBN|0-7456-2483-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though it relies very heavily on the art object to make its impact. The term is used in relation to them on the basis that the object is not the artwork, or is often a [[Found art|found object]], which has not needed artistic skill in its production. [[Tracey Emin]] is seen as a leading YBA and a neo-conceptualist, even though she has denied that she is and has emphasised personal emotional expression. Charles Harrison, a member of the conceptual art group [[Art and Language]] in the 1970s, criticizes the neo-conceptual art of the 1990s as conceptual art "without threat or awkwardness"&lt;ref&gt;Charles Harrison, ''Essays on Art &amp; Language'', MIT Press, 2001, p29. {{ISBN|0-262-58241-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a "vacant" prospect.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Harrison, ''Essays on Art &amp; Language'', MIT Press, 2001, p241. {{ISBN|0-262-58241-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable artists associated with neo-conceptualism in the UK include [[Martin Creed]], [[Liam Gillick]], [[Bethan Huws]], [[Simon Patterson (artist)|Simon Patterson]], [[Simon Starling]] and [[Douglas Gordon]].

==Notable events==
1991: [[Charles Saatchi]] funds Damien Hirst and the next year in the [[Saatchi Gallery]] exhibits his ''[[The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living]]'', a shark in formaldehyde in a vitrine.

1993: [[Vanessa Beecroft]] holds her first performance in Milan, Italy, using models to act as a second audience to the display of her diary of food.

1999: [[Tracey Emin]] is nominated for the [[Turner Prize]]. Part of her exhibit is ''My Bed'', her dishevelled bed, surrounded by detritus such as condoms, blood-stained knickers, bottles and her bedroom slippers.

2001: [[Martin Creed]] wins the Turner Prize for ''The Lights Going On and Off'', an empty room where the lights go on and off.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/1698032.stm BBC Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

2005: [[Simon Starling]] wins the Turner Prize for ''Shedboatshed'', a wooden shed which he had turned into a boat, floated down the Rhine and turned back into a shed again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1905555,00.html ''The Times'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy in the UK==
In [[United Kingdom|Britain]], the rise to prominence of the [[Young British Artists]] (YBAs) after the 1988 ''[[Freeze (exhibition)|Freeze]]'' show, curated by Damien Hirst, and subsequent promotion of the group by the [[Saatchi Gallery]] during the 1990s, generated a media backlash, where the phrases "conceptual art" and "neo-conceptual" came to be terms of derision applied to much [[contemporary art]]. This was amplified  by the [[Turner Prize]] whose more extreme nominees (most notably Hirst and Emin) caused a controversy annually.

[[File:Stuckists Death of Conceptual Art demo (3).jpg|thumb|right|170 px|[[Stuckism|Stuckists']] "Death of Conceptual Art" coffin demonstration, 2002]]
The [[Stuckism|Stuckist]] group of artists, founded in 1999, proclaimed themselves "pro-contemporary figurative painting with ideas and anti-conceptual art, mainly because of its lack of concepts." They also called it pretentious, "unremarkable and boring" and on July 25, 2002 deposited a coffin outside the [[White Cube]] gallery, marked "The Death of Conceptual Art".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/Tate/WhiteCube.html "White Cube Demo 2002"], stuckism.com. Retrieved 19 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cripps, Charlotte. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20040907/ai_n12797891 "Visual arts: Saying knickers to Sir Nicholas], ''[[The Independent]]'', 7 September 2004. Retrieved from findarticles.com, 7 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; They staged yearly demonstrations outside the Turner Prize.

In 2002, [[Ivan Massow]], the Chairman of the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] branded conceptual art "pretentious, self-indulgent, craftless tat" and in "danger of disappearing up its own arse ... led by cultural tsars such as the [[Tate Gallery|Tate]]'s Sir [[Nicholas Serota]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,3604,634797,00.html ''The Guardian'']&lt;/ref&gt; Massow was consequently forced to resign. At the end of the year, the Culture Minister, [[Kim Howells]] (an art school graduate) denounced the Turner Prize as "cold, mechanical, conceptual bullshit".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2002/11/01/nart01.xml ''The Daily Telegraph'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2004 the [[Saatchi Gallery]] told the media that "painting continues to be the most relevant and vital way that artists choose to communicate."&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Nigel 2004 [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/10/02/nsaat02.xml "Saatchi's latest shock for the art world is &amp;ndash; painting"] ''The Daily Telegraph'' 10 February 2004. Accessed  April 15, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Following this [[Charles Saatchi]] began to sell prominent works from his YBA collection.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8101">'''New Source Performance Standards''' ('''NSPS''') are pollution control [[Technical standard|standards]] issued by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA).  The term is used in the [[Clean Air Act (1970)|Clean Air Act Extension of 1970]] (CAA) to refer to [[air pollution]] emission standards, and in the [[Clean Water Act]] (CWA) referring to standards for [[water pollution]] discharges of [[industrial wastewater treatment|industrial wastewater]] to [[surface water]]s.

== Introduction ==
Some pollution control laws are organized with varying degrees of stringency. The different standards may be based on several factors, including whether the pollution source is an existing facility at the time the standard is published, or is constructed after publication. The standards for new sources may be more stringent than that for existing facilities, on the principle that a new plant can be designed with the latest and most advanced control technologies.&lt;ref name=carruth&gt;{{cite book |last1=Carruth |first1=Russellyn S. |last2=Goldstein |first2=Bernard D. |date=2013 |title=Environmental Health Law: An Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mXhjAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT82 |chapter=Defining New Sources |publisher=John Wiley |location=Hoboken, NJ |isbn=9781118420874}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|82-83}}

== Clean Air Act ==
The Clean Air Act NSPS dictate the level of pollution that a new [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|stationary source]] may produce. These standards are authorized by Section 111 of the CAA&lt;ref&gt;United States. Clean Air Act, section 111, {{USC|42|7411}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the regulations are published in [[Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations|40 CFR]] Part 60.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). "Standards of Performance for New Stationary Sources." ''Code of Federal Regulations,'' {{USCFR|40|60}}.&lt;/ref&gt; NSPS have been established for a number of individual industrial or source categories. Examples:

===Basic process for establishing standards===
#Identify type of emitting facility.
#For each type of facility, identify the type of pollutant control technology that is appropriate.
#From a study of all the plants and all the information available about the plants and their technologies, establish an allowed concentration of the [[criteria pollutants]] that is the upper limit of what can be emitted.&lt;ref name=carruth /&gt;{{rp|84-85}}

== Clean Water Act ==
Under the Clean Water Act, NSPS set the level of allowable wastewater discharges from new industrial facilities. EPA issues NSPS for categories of industrial dischargers, typically in conjunction with the issuance of [[effluent guidelines]] for existing sources. In developing NSPS, the CWA requires that EPA determine the "best available demonstrated control technology" (BADCT) for the particular industrial category. BADCT may be more stringent than the [[best available technology|best available technology economically achievable]] standard used for existing dischargers. This consideration may include setting a "no discharge of pollutants standard" (also called a "zero discharge" standard) if practicable.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Clean Water Act, section 306(a), {{USCSub|33|1316|a}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/eg/learn-about-effluent-guidelines |title=Learn About Effluent Guidelines |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016-01-29 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NSPS regulations are published at [[Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations|40 CFR]] Subchapter N (Parts 405-499). NSPS issued by EPA include the following categories:
* Coal Mining&lt;ref&gt;EPA, Coal Mining Point Source Category Effluent Guidelines and Standards. {{USCFR|40|434}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dairy Products&lt;ref&gt;EPA, Dairy Products Processing Point Source Category Effluent Guidelines and Standards. {{USCFR|40|405}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Inorganic Chemicals Manufacturing (including a zero discharge requirement for several subcategories)&lt;ref&gt;EPA, Inorganic Chemicals Manufacturing Point Source Category Effluent Guidelines and Standards. {{USCFR|40|415}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Iron and Steel Manufacturing&lt;ref&gt;EPA, Iron and Steel Manufacturing Point Source Category Effluent Guidelines and Standards. {{USCFR|40|420}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Oil and Gas Extraction&lt;ref&gt;EPA, Oil and Gas Extraction Point Source Category Effluent Guidelines and Standards. {{USCFR|40|435}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Petroleum Refining&lt;ref&gt;EPA, Petroleum Refining Point Source Category Effluent Guidelines and Standards. {{USCFR|40|419}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Pulp, Paper and Paperboard&lt;ref&gt;EPA, Pulp, Paper and Paperboard Point Source Category Effluent Guidelines and Standards. {{USCFR|40|430}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sugar Processing (including a zero discharge requirement for one subcategory)&lt;ref&gt;EPA, Sugar Processing Point Source Category Effluent Guidelines and Standards. {{USCFR|40|409}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Textile Mills.&lt;ref&gt;EPA, Textile Mills Point Source Category Effluent Guidelines and Standards. {{USCFR|40|410}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

EPA has published a general definition of "new source" in the federal wastewater permit regulations.&lt;ref&gt;
"EPA Administered Permit Programs: The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System." ''Code of Federal Regulations,'' {{USCFR|40|122.2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; More specialized definitions of "new source" are included in some of the individual category regulations, e.g., the definition for the Pulp, Paper and Paperboard category.&lt;ref&gt;EPA, Pulp, Paper and Paperboard Point Source Category. ''Code of Federal Regulations,'' {{USCFR|40|430.01}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paremiology''' ({{Etymology|gre|παροιμία (paroimía)|proverb, maxim, saw}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dparoimi%2Fa παροιμία], [[Henry George Liddell]], Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;  is the collection and study of [[proverb]]s.

==History==
Paremiology can be dated back as far as [[Aristotle]]. [[Paremiography]], on the other hand, is the collection of proverbs. The proverb scholar [[Wolfgang Mieder]] defines the term ''proverb'' as follows:

{{Quote|A proverb is a short, generally known sentence of the folk which contains wisdom, truth, morals, and traditional views in a metaphorical, fixed and memorizable form and which is handed down from generation to generation.|Mieder 1985:119; also in Mieder 1993:24}}

==Categorization==
As well as actual proverbs, the following may be considered proverbial phrases:
* proverbial comparison, such as "as busy as a bee."
* proverbial interrogative, such as "Does a chicken have lips?"
* [[wellerism]], named after [[Sam Weller (fictional character)|Sam Weller]] from [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]'' (1837), is a triad that consists of a statement (often a proverb), an identification of a speaker (person or animal), and a phrase that places the statement into an unexpected situation. An example: "Every evil is followed by some good," the man said when his wife died the day after he became bankrupt.
*[[anti-proverb]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mieder|first1=Wolfgang|last2=Litovkina|first2=Anna|title=Twisted Wisdon: Modern Anti-Proverbs|date=2002|publisher=DeProverbio}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[perverb]]. This is a misuse or adaptation of a familiar proverb to twist or change its meaning. Examples include: "Nerds of a feather flock together," "Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and likely to talk about it," and "Absence makes the heart grow wander." Anti-proverbs are common on T-shirts, such as "If at first you don't succeed, skydiving is not for you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neatoshop.com/product/If-At-First-You-Dont-Succeed-Skydiving-Isnt-For-You |title=T-shirt with anti-proverb |publisher=Neatoshop.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even classic Latin proverbs can be remolded as anti-proverbs, such as "[[Carpe diem|Carpe noctem]]." and "Carpe per diem." Anti-proverbs are not new; [[Aristophanes]] is credited with creating one over 2,300 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;p. 5, Alster, Bendt. 1979. "An Akkadian and a Greek proverb: A comparative study". ''Die Welt des Orients'' 10:1-5.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[proverbial expression]], such as "to bite the dust." This is not strictly a proverb, which should be a fixed unchangeable sentence; a proverbial expression permits alteration to fit the grammar of the context.&lt;ref name=folk&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1497581 "Proverbial Phrases from California"], by Owen S. Adams, ''[[Western Folklore]]'', Vol. 8, No. 2 (1949), pp. 95-116 {{doi|10.2307/1497581}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[allusion]], which is a reference to a proverb rather than a statement of the proverb. An example: "The new boss will probably fire some of the old staff, you know what they say about a ''new broom''." This allusion refers to the proverb "A new broom sweeps clean."&lt;ref name=folk/&gt;

==Styles==
Typical stylistic features of proverbs (as Shirley Arora points out in her article, ''The Perception of Proverbiality'' (1984)) are:

* [[Alliteration]]&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Fionnuala Carson. 2011. Alliteration in English-Language Versions of Current Widespread European Idioms and Proverbs. Jonathan Roper,  (ed.) ''Alliteration in Culture'', pp. 34-44. England: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; (Forgive and forget)
* [[Parallelism (rhetoric)|Parallelism]] (Nothing ventured, nothing gained)
* [[Rhyme]] (When the cat is away, the mice will play)
* [[Ellipsis (linguistics)|Ellipsis]] (Once bitten, twice shy)

==Poetic techniques==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
In some languages, [[assonance]], the repetition of a vowel, is also exploited in forming artistic proverbs, such as the following extreme example from [[Oromo language|Oromo]], of Ethiopia.
* kan mana baala, aɂlaa gaala ("A leaf at home, but a camel elsewhere"; somebody who has a big reputation among those who do not know him well.)
Similarly, from [[Tajik language|Tajik]]:
* Az yak palak ― chand handalak ("From one vine, many different melons.")
* Man taanna adraka ma tamanna ("No point in running, one should leave on time.") Arabic
Notice that in all of these cases of complete assonance, the vowel is &lt;a&gt;, the most common vowel in human languages.

Also in [[Amharic]], complete assonance is not infrequent when verbs are in the 3rd person masculine singular, past tense. The vowel &lt;ä&gt; is the most frequent vowel in the language.
*yälämmänä mänämmänä - (The one who begs becomes thin.)

Internal features that can be found quite frequently include:
* [[Hyperbole]] (All is fair in love and war)
* [[Paradox]] (For there to be peace there must first be war)
* [[Personification]] (Hunger is the best cook)

==Metaphorical links==
To make the respective statement more general most proverbs are based on a [[metaphor]].&lt;ref&gt;Mac Coinnigh, Marcas. ‘[https://www.academia.edu/2353903/_The_Heart_of_Irish-Language_Proverbs_An_Linguo-Stylistic_Analysis_of_Explicit_Metaphor The Heart of Irish-Language Proverbs? A Linguo-stylistic Analysis of Explicit Metaphor’]. Proverbium: Yearbook of International Proverb Scholarship 30 (2013): 113-150.&lt;/ref&gt; Further typical features of the proverb are its shortness and the fact that its author is generally unknown.
[[File:Nimm dich selbst by der Nase.JPG|thumb|''Nimm dich selbst bei der Nase'' ("take yourself by your nose"). It's also called "Vogel Selbsterkenntnis" (Bird of self-knowledge)]]

==Interpretations from other languages==
In the article "Tensions in Proverbs: More Light on International Understanding", Joseph Raymond comments on what common [[Russian proverbs]] from the 18th and 19th centuries portray: Potent antiauthoritarian proverbs reflected tensions between the Russian people and the [[Czar]]. The rollickingly malicious undertone of these folk verbalizations constitutes what might be labeled a "paremiological revolt". To avoid openly criticizing a given authority or cultural pattern, folk take recourse to proverbial expressions which voice personal tensions in a tone of generalized consent.{{huh|date=January 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;J. Raymond. 1956. Tensions in Proverbs: More Light on International Understanding. ''Western Folklore'' 15.3, pg 153-154&lt;/ref&gt;  Proverbs that speak to the political disgruntlement include: "When the Czar spits into the soup dish, it fairly bursts with pride"; "If the Czar be a rhymester, woe be to the poets"; and "The hen of the [[Czarina]] herself does not lay swan's eggs". While none of these proverbs state directly, "I hate the Czar and detest my situation" (which would have been incredibly dangerous), they do get their points across.

Proverbs are found in many parts of the world, but some areas seem to have richer stores of proverbs than others (such as West Africa), while others have hardly any (North and South America) (Mieder 2004b:108,109).

==Users of proverbs==
Proverbs are used by speakers for a variety of purposes.  Sometimes they are used as a way of saying something gently, in a veiled way (Obeng 1996). Other times, they are used to carry more weight in a discussion, a weak person is able to enlist the tradition of the ancestors to support his position, or even to argue a legal case.&lt;ref&gt;John C. Messenger Jr. The Role of Proverbs in a Nigerian Judicial System. ''Southwestern Journal of Anthropology''. 15:1 (Spring, 1959) pp. 64-73.&lt;/ref&gt;  Proverbs can also be used to simply make a conversation/discussion more lively.  In many parts of the world, the use of proverbs is a mark of being a good orator.

==Uses of paremiology==
The study of proverbs has application in a number of fields. Clearly, those who study [[folklore]] and [[literature]] are interested in them, but scholars from a variety of fields have found ways to profitably incorporate the study proverbs. For example, they have been used to study abstract reasoning of children, acculturation of immigrants, intelligence, the differing mental processes in mental illness, cultural themes, etc.  Proverbs have also been incorporated into the strategies of social workers, teachers, preachers, and even politicians. (For the deliberate use of proverbs as a propaganda tool by [[Nazi]]s, see Mieder 1982.)

There are collections of sayings that offer instructions on how to play certain games, such as [[dominoes]] (Borajo ''et al.'' 1990) and the Oriental board game [[go (board game)|go]] (Mitchell 2001).  However, these are not prototypical proverbs in that their application is limited to one domain.

==Folklore==
One of the most important developments in the study of proverbs (as in folklore scholarship more generally) was the shift to more ethnographic approaches in the 1960s. This approach attempted to explain proverb use in relation to the context of a speech event, rather than only in terms of the content and meaning of the proverb.&lt;ref&gt;E. Ojo Arewa and [[Alan Dundes]].  Proverbs and the Ethnography of Speaking Folklore. American Anthropologist. 66: 6, Part 2: The Ethnography of Communication (Dec 1964), pp. 70-85. Richard Bauman and Neil McCabe. Proverbs in an LSD Cult. The Journal of American Folklore. Vol. 83, No. 329 (Jul. - Sep., 1970), pp. 318-324.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cognitive science==
Another important development in scholarship on proverbs has been applying methods from cognitive science to understand the uses and effects of proverbs and proverbial metaphors in social relations.&lt;ref name="Richard P. Honeck 1997"&gt;Richard P. Honeck. A proverb in mind: the cognitive science of proverbial wit and wisdom. Routledge, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4682">'''Policy advocacy''' is defined as active, covert, or inadvertent support of a particular [[policy]] or class of policies.&lt;ref&gt;Lackey (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Whether it is proper for [[scientists]] and other technical experts to act as advocates for their personal policy preferences is contentious.  In the scientific community, much of the controversy around policy advocacy involves precisely defining the proper role of [[science]] and scientists in the political process.&lt;ref&gt;Shannon (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;  Some scientists choose to act as policy advocates, while others regard such a dichotomous role as inappropriate.&lt;ref&gt;Lackey (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Providing technical and scientific information to inform policy deliberations in an objective and relevant way is recognized as a difficult problem in many scientific and technical professions.&lt;ref&gt;Rykiel (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;  The challenge and conflicts have been studied for those working as stock analysts in brokerage firms,&lt;ref&gt;Boni (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; for medical experts testifying in malpractice trials,&lt;ref&gt;Caldwell (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; for funding officers at international development agencies,&lt;ref&gt;Béné (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; and for intelligence analysts within governmental national security agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;  The job of providing accurate, relevant, and policy neutral information is especially challenging if highly controversial policy issues (such as [[climate change]]) that have a significant scientific component.&lt;ref&gt;Pielke (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of [[normative science]] by scientists is a common method used to subtly advocate for preferred policy choices.&lt;ref&gt;Scott (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6104">'''Preservation survey''' (also known as '''condition survey''', '''conservation needs survey''' or '''preservation assessment''') is the process of collecting and analyzing data about the physical condition of [[library]] materials.

Preservation surveys are used by libraries to determine the condition of their collections and identify necessary actions for preserving, conserving or repairing materials.  They are most often conducted at research and university libraries.

Preservation surveys are often the first step when planning and implementing a preservation program in a library.  By collecting data and compiling statistics about a collection’s condition, library staff can determine environmental threats and preservation needs.  It is also possible to use the resulting data to predict future deterioration.&lt;ref&gt;Robert DeCandido. “Condition Survey of the United States History, Local History and Genealogy Collection of the New York Public Library,” ''Library Resources and Technical Services'', 33,3 (July, 1989), 281.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since preservation needs usually well exceed an institution’s resources, the data acquired in an assessment can aid libraries in establishing priorities in regard to deteriorating materials.&lt;ref&gt;Brian J. Baird, Jana Krentz, and Brad Schaffner, “Findings from the Condition Surveys Conducted by the University of Kansas Libraries,” ''College and Research Libraries'', 58, 2 (March 1997), 115.&lt;/ref&gt;  As Ross Harvey wrote in his ''Preservation in Libraries'', the data from surveys can "be used to plan how best to deploy available resources."&lt;ref&gt;Ross Harvey, ''Preservation in Libraries: Principles, Strategies and Practices for Librarians'', London: Bowker-Saur, 1993, pg. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The need for surveying library materials was born of the increasing awareness of the problem of brittle books.  [[William Barrow (chemist)|William Barrow]]’s ''Deterioration of Book Stock: Problems and Remedies'' from 1959 alerted the library world to the alarmingly short shelf life of books composed of acidic paper.  While major libraries had estimated high percentages of acidic books,&lt;ref&gt;Gay Walker, Jane Greenfield, John Fox, and Jeffrey S. Simonoff, “The Yale Survey: A Large-Scale Study of Book Deterioration in the Yale University Library,” ''College and Research Libraries'', 46 (March 1985), 111.&lt;/ref&gt; it wasn’t until 1979 that an empirical study was conducted on a library collection to determine its condition.  This study,&lt;ref&gt;Sara Buchanan and Sandra Coleman, “Deterioration Survey of the Stanford University Libraries Green Library Stack Collection,” In ''Preservation Planning Program Resource Notebook'', comp. Pamela W. Darling (Washington DC: Association of Research Libraries, Office of Management Studies, 1987): 159-230.&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Stanford University]]’s Green Library, was a benchmark in the field and established the methodology for conducting preservation surveys in research libraries.

[[Yale University]] conducted a large-scale assessment of its library materials in 1985&lt;ref&gt;Gay Walker, Jane Greenfield, John Fox, and Jeffrey S. Simonoff, “The Yale Survey: A Large-Scale Study of Book Deterioration in the Yale University Library,” ''College and Research Libraries'', 46 (March 1985), 111-132.&lt;/ref&gt; that is also considered a landmark in the field.  Yale’s survey sounded the warning bell for research libraries worldwide, discovering that 86% of the more that 36,500 books in the sample were either brittle or composed of paper with an acidic pH.&lt;ref&gt;Gay Walker, Jane Greenfield, John Fox, and Jeffrey S. Simonoff, “The Yale Survey: A Large-Scale Study of Book Deterioration in the Yale University Library,” ''College and Research Libraries'', 46 (March 1985), 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conducting a Survey==
Many preservation surveys are conducted by collecting data on a random sample of items.&lt;ref&gt;M. Carl Drott, "Random Sampling: A Tool for Library Research," ''College and Research Libraries'' 30 (March 1969), 119-125&lt;/ref&gt;  University librarians may consult with the institution’s statistics department to design a reliable sampling plan.&lt;ref&gt;Gay Walker, Jane Greenfield, John Fox, and Jeffrey S. Simonoff, “The Yale Survey: A Large-Scale Study of Book Deterioration in the Yale University Library,” ''College and Research Libraries'', 46 (March 1985), 127.&lt;/ref&gt;  A random sample may be derived by the randomization of call numbers, by the creation of a sampling frame that assigns a unique number to each item in the target population&lt;ref&gt;Gay Walker, Jane Greenfield, John Fox, and Jeffrey S. Simonoff, “The Yale Survey: A Large-Scale Study of Book Deterioration in the Yale University Library,” ''College and Research Libraries'', 46 (March 1985), 127.&lt;/ref&gt; or by generating random numbers and locating volumes by counting on the shelf.&lt;ref&gt;Robert DeCandido. “Condition Survey of the United States History, Local History and Genealogy Collection of the New York Public Library,” ''Library Resources and Technical Services'', 33,3 (January, 1989), 276.&lt;/ref&gt;

A pilot survey of a small sample population may be run prior to the actual survey in order to address any problems with the sampling plan or the survey questions.&lt;ref&gt;Gay Walker, Jane Greenfield, John Fox, and Jeffrey S. Simonoff, “The Yale Survey: A Large-Scale Study of Book Deterioration in the Yale University Library,” ''College and Research Libraries'', 46 (March 1985), 113-114.&lt;/ref&gt;  The pilot survey may reveal unclear or ambiguous wording, superfluous questions, or existing conditions that have not been addressed.

After the pilot survey, the library may hold a workshop to train surveyors to properly collect data and handle materials.&lt;ref&gt;Tina Chrzastowski, David Cobb, Nancy Davis, Jean Geil, and Betsy Kruger “Library Collection Deterioration: A Study at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,” College and Research Libraries, 50, 5 (September 1989): 579.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andrêsa do Nascimento''' (1859{{ndash}}1927) was a [[courtesan]] and celebrated society figure in ''[[fin de siècle]]'' [[Lisbon]]. She was better known as '''Preta Fernanda''' (literally: Black Fernanda) and '''Fernanda do Vale''' (her ''[[nom de plume]]''). She was, perhaps, the best known black citizen of the city in that period.&lt;ref name="hatton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="debaixo"&gt;{{cite newspaper |url=https://expressodasilhas.cv/opiniao/2017/08/08/debaixo-da-nossa-pele-iv-retrato-de-uma-senhora/54219 |title=Debaixo da nossa Pele IV: Retrato de Uma Senhora |date=8 August 2017 |newspaper=Expresso das Ilhas |language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nascimento was born to poor parents in a small village near [[Ribeira da Barca]] on the island of [[Santiago, Cape Verde|Santiago]] in [[Cape Verde]], probably in 1859.&lt;ref name="arlivre"&gt;{{cite newspaper |url=https://expressodasilhas.cv/opiniao/2017/10/20/ar-livre-a-preta-fernanda-no-coracao-do-imperio/55003 |title=Ar livre: A preta Fernanda no coração do império |date=20 October 2017 |newspaper=Expresso das Ilhas |language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="testemunhos"/&gt; Cape Verde, a volcanic archipelago off the west coast of Africa, was a [[Portuguese discoveries|Portuguese colony]] and a nexus for the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. Although slavery was abolished in [[Portugal]] nearly a century earlier, it was only selectively abolished in Cape Verde in 1857 with complete abolition in 1878.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Cape Verde at the End of Atlantic Slavery |author-first=Daryle |author-last=Williams |journal=Slavery &amp; Abolition |year=2015 |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=160-179 |doi=10.1080/0144039X.2014.924253|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0144039X.2014.924253}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible, therefore, that one or both of Nascimento's parents were enslaved when she was born or had been enslaved.

When she was about 19, she sailed away from the small Atlantic island in the company of a ship's captain, Jerónimo Martins, who promised her marriage, but abandoned her once they arrived in [[Dakar]], on the African coast.&lt;ref name="arlivre"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guinote"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/41105182 |title=The Old Bohemian Lisbon (c. 1870-c. 1920): Prostitutes, Criminals and Bohemians |author-first=Paulo |last=Guinote |journal=Portuguese Studies |volume=18 |year=2002 |pages=71-95 |publisher=Modern Humanities Research Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="valdemar"&gt;{{cite newspaper |author-first=António |author-last=Valdemar |title=Avenida da Liberdade |newspaper=Diário de Notícias |url=http://domedioorienteeafins.blogspot.com/2014/03/a-preta-fernanda.html |language=Portuguese |access-date=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She subsequently married a German beer maker, Frederick "Fritz" Kemps, who took her to [[Lisbon]], and with whom she had twins. According to some sources her husband died; others say he was habitually drunk and abandoned her.&lt;ref name="debaixo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="arlivre"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guinote"/&gt;

Regardless, Nascimento found herself alone again, and in order to support herself and her children, she worked briefly as a model for Italian sculptor [[Giovanni Ciniselli]]. She is immortalized in [[Dom Luís Square]] in Lisbon as a figure supporting the sculpture of the [[Bernardo de Sá Nogueira de Figueiredo, 1st Marquis of Sá da Bandeira|Marquis of Sá da Bandeira]], famed for his [[abolitionist]] efforts. Nascimento posed for Ciniselli's depiction of an [[Slavery in Portugal|enslaved African woman]], broken chains on her ankles and a child in her lap. The woman faces her child while pointing at the figure of the Marquis above them, as if extolling the nobleman. The sculpture was funded by a public subscription and was unveiled by [[Luís I of Portugal|King Luís I]] in 1884.&lt;ref name="apartheid"&gt;{{cite newspaper |url=https://www.publico.pt/2017/03/25/local/noticia/andar-atras-das-memorias-africanas-para-conhecer-lisboa-1766414 |title=Do ''apartheid'' envergonhado à "Preta Fernanda": o rasto de África nas ruas de Lisboa |author-first=Margarida David |author-last=Cardoso |date=25 March 2017 |newspaper=Publico |language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hatton"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=stB0DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA108 |title=Queen of the Sea: A History of Lisbon |author-first=Barry |author-last=Hatton |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2018 |isbn=9781787381070 |pages=108-109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She found steadier work in 1889 as a lady's maid for a high society woman, a member of the influential Cavalcanti family.&lt;ref name="debaixo"/&gt; She stayed in this position for nearly two decades.

After eighteen years, she left the lady's service and, using her savings and her society contacts, opened a brothel in Lisbon's [[Bairro Alto]] neighborhood, which she quickly established as a nightly meeting place for writers, politicians and [[Bohemianism|bohemians]] of the Portuguese capital.&lt;ref name="arlivre"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hatton"/&gt; Nascimento became one of the most famous courtesans in Lisbon; she had many lovers, from sailors and soldiers to influential writers and legal scholars, and was a regular figure at the hottest night-spots.&lt;ref name="guinote"/&gt; Glamorous and unafraid of scandal, Nascimento, it is claimed, once [[Portuguese-style bullfighting|fought a bull on horseback]] in [[Algés (Oeiras)|Algés]], and she accompanied famed author [[José Maria de Eça de Queirós]] to his box at the [[Teatro da Trinidade]].&lt;ref name="apartheid"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hatton"/&gt; She was also, reportedly, the only woman who remained in the room when [[futurism|futurist]] [[Almada Negreiros]] presented his—at the time—shocking ''Ultimatum Futurista'' in April of 1917.&lt;ref name="apartheid"/&gt;&lt;ref name="testemunhos"&gt;{{cite web |title=Preta Fernanda |work=Testemunhos da Escravatura (Testimonies of Slavery) |publisher=Lisbon City Hall |url=http://testemunhosdaescravatura.pt/pt/pessoas/figuras/preta-fernanda |access-date=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Recordações d'uma Colonial.jpg|thumb|Nascimento dressed as a bull-fighter on the cover of the first edition of ''Recordações d'uma Colonial'']]
In 1912 Nascimento published an autobiography, ''Recordações d'uma Colonial'' (''Recollections of a Colonial Subject''), written with help from two friends.&lt;ref name="arlivre"/&gt; The memoir tells the story of her life in Cape Verde and Portugal, but the authors sometimes forsook accuracy in favor of a more exciting story.&lt;ref name="hatton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="arlivre"/&gt; She diligently recorded all of the men who had shared her bed (but not their true names), and in the final chapter offered candid commentary on each man's sexual performance.&lt;ref name="debaixo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="valdemar"/&gt; A modern reader notes that, in today's context, the language of the book is racist and reflects stereotypes of its time.&lt;ref name="debaixo"/&gt;

Little is known of her life after 1912. Nascimento died in Lisbon on 20 August 1927.&lt;ref name="testemunhos"/&gt;

The '''Professional College of Engineers and Land Surveyors of Puerto Rico''' —{{lang-es|Colegio de Ingenieros y Agrimensores de Puerto Rico}} ('''CIAPR''')— is the [[professional association]] mandated by law that groups all [[engineer]]s and [[land surveyor]]s that call, present, or represent themselves as 'engineers' or 'land surveyors' in [[Puerto Rico]].{{efn|CIAPR "In order to be called, presented or represented as an engineer, architect or land surveyor in Puerto Rico, you have to be [...] a member of the CIAPR."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fig.net/admin/ga/2006/ppt_app/app_22_04_2011_bid_puertorico.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;}} As with many other countries, [[Regulation and licensure in engineering|the profession of engineering and land surveying is both regulated and licensed in Puerto Rico]]; while another entity, namely the Puerto Rico Examining Board of Engineers and Land Surveyors, regulates the profession and emits its corresponding licenses, the Puerto Rico Annotated Codes and Act 173 of 1988 requires that all licensed engineers and land surveyors in Puerto Rico must be members of the College. The quasi-public nonprofit corporation was established on May 15, 1938, through Act 319 of 1938 in order to bring together professionals with the right to practice engineering, architecture and surveying in [[Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sba.gov/content/sba-and-puerto-rico-engineers-and-land-surveyors-cosponsor-8th-annual-business-matchmaking-e |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215023359/http://www.sba.gov/content/sba-and-puerto-rico-engineers-and-land-surveyors-cosponsor-8th-annual-business-matchmaking-e |archivedate=2013-12-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary mission of the Professional College is to promote the protection and development of engineering and surveying to promote ethics and excellence in professional practice for the benefit of referees and the people of Puerto Rico.

==Organizational structure==
The Professional College is composed primarily of its governing board, which in turn is composed of the presidents and delegates elected by the enrollment of the schools in their respective annual meetings, and delegates elected by their chapters are registered for their assemblies year. Also part of the governing board are the president, a vice-president for engineering and a vice-president for surveyors, elected at the annual meeting.
The professional college institutes are semi-autonomous bodies, which represent the various professional bodies board of government or publicly.ico.
In addition to these agencies, the Professional College has about twenty permanent committees and ad hoc committees designated for specific projects.
The college also has an independent disciplinary tribunal that is used in cases of violations of professional conduct or ethics, or disputes between colleges.

{{Revolution sidebar}}
'''Rebellion''', '''uprising''', or '''insurrection''' is a refusal of obedience or order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cyclopædia of Political Science, Political Economy, and of the Political ... |last=Lalor |first=John Joseph |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1884 |publisher=Rand, McNally |location= |isbn= |pages=632 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to the open resistance against the orders of an established [[authority]]. The term comes from the Latin verb ''rebellō,'' "I renew war" (from ''re-'' ("again") + ''bellō'' ("I wage war/I revolt").  The rebel is the individual that partakes in rebellion or rebellious activities, particularly when armed. Thus, the term ''rebellion'' also refers to the ensemble of rebels in a state of revolt.

A rebellion originates from a sentiment of indignation and disapproval of a situation and then manifests itself by the refusal to submit or to obey the authority responsible for this situation. Rebellion can be individual or collective, [[peace]]ful ([[civil disobedience]], [[civil resistance]], and [[nonviolent resistance]]) or [[violent]] ([[terrorism]], [[sabotage]] and [[guerrilla warfare]].) {{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

In political terms, rebellion and revolt are often distinguished by their different aims. If rebellion generally seeks to evade and/or gain concessions from an oppressive power, a revolt seeks to overthrow and destroy that power, as well as its accompanying laws. The goal of rebellion is resistance while a '''revolt''' seeks a revolution.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}  As power shifts relative to the external adversary, or power shifts within a mixed [[coalition]], or positions harden or soften on either side, an insurrection may seesaw between the two forms.

== Causes ==

=== Macro approach ===
The following theories broadly build on the Marxist interpretation of rebellion. They explore the causes of rebellion from a wide lens perspective.{{clarify|date=May 2016}} Rebellion is studied, in Theda Skocpol's words, by analyzing "objective relationships and conflicts among variously situated groups and nations, rather than the interests, outlooks, or ideologies of particular actors in revolutions".{{sfn|Skocpol|1979|p=291}}

==== Marxist insight ====
[[Karl Marx]]'s analysis of revolutions sees such expression of [[political violence]] not as anomic, episodic outbursts of discontents but rather the symptomatic expression of a particular set of objective but fundamentally contradicting class-based relations of power. Indeed, the central tenet of Marxist philosophy, as expressed in [[Capital: Critique of Political Economy|Capital]], is the analysis of society's mode of production (technology and labor) concomitant with the ownership of productive institutions and the division of profit. Marx writes about "the hidden structure of society" that must be elucidated through an examination of "the direct relationship of the owners of the conditions of production to the direct producers". The mismatch, between one mode of production, between the social forces and the social ownership of the production, is at the origin of the revolution.{{sfn|Skocpol|1979|p=7}} The inner imbalance within these modes of production is derived from the conflicting modes of organization, such as capitalism within feudalism, or more appropriately socialism within capitalism. The dynamics engineered by these class frictions help class consciousness root itself in the collective imaginary. For example, the development of the bourgeoisie class went from oppressed merchant class to urban independence, eventually gaining enough power to represent the state as a whole. Social movements, thus, are determined by an exogenous set of circumstances. The proletariat must also, according to Marx, go through the same process of self-determination which can only be achieved by friction against the bourgeoisie. In Marx's theory revolutions are the "locomotives of history", it is because rebellion has for ultimate goal to overthrow the ruling class and its antiquated mode of production. Later, rebellion attempts to replace it with a new system of political economy, one that is better suited to the new ruling class, thus enabling societal progress. The cycle of rebellion, thus, replaces one mode of production by another through the constant class friction.{{sfn|Skocpol|1979|p=8}}

==== Ted Gurr: Roots of political violence ====
In his book ''Why Men Rebel'', [[Ted Robert Gurr|Ted Gurr]] looks at the roots of political violence itself applied to a rebellion framework. He defines political violence as: "all collective attacks within a political community against the political [[Political regime|regime]], its actors [...] or its policies. The concept represents a set of events, a common property of which is the actual or threatened use of violence".{{sfn|Gurr|1970|p=3}} Gurr sees in violence a voice of anger that manifests itself against the established order. More precisely, individuals become angry when they feel what Gurr labels as [[Relative deprivation thesis|relative deprivation]], meaning the feeling of getting less than one is entitled to. He labels it formally as the "perceived discrepancy between value expectations and value capabilities".{{sfn|Gurr|1970|p=37}} Gurr differentiates between three types of relative deprivation:
# ''Decremental deprivation'': one's capacities' decrease when expectations remain high. One example of this is the proliferation and thus depreciation of  the value of higher education.{{sfn|Gurr|1970|p=47}}
# ''Aspirational Deprivation'': one's capacities stay the same when expectations rise. An example would be a first generation college student lacking the contacts and network to obtain a higher paying job while watching her better-prepared colleagues bypass her.{{sfn|Gurr|1970|p=52}}
# ''Progressive deprivation'': expectation and capabilities increase but the former cannot keep up. A good example would be an automotive worker being increasingly marginalized by the automatisation of the assembly line.{{sfn|Gurr|1970|p=53}}
Anger is thus comparative. One of his key insight is that "The potential for collective violence varies strongly with the intensity and scope of relative deprivation among members of a collectivity".{{sfn|Gurr|1970|p=24}} This means that different individuals within society will have different propensities to rebel based on their particular internalization of their situation. As such, Gurr differentiates between three types of political violence:{{sfn|Gurr|1970|p=11}}
# ''Turmoil'' when only the mass population encounters relative deprivation;
# ''Conspiracy'' when the population but especially the elite encounters relative deprivation;
# ''Internal War'', which includes revolution. In this case, the degree of organization is much higher than turmoil, and the revolution is intrinsically spread to all sections of society, unlike the conspiracy.

==== Charles Tilly: Centrality of collective action ====
In ''From Mobilization to Revolution'', [[Charles Tilly]] argues that political violence is a normal and endogenous reaction to competition for power between different groups within society. "Collective violence", Tilly writes, "is the product of just normal processes of competition among groups in order to obtain the power and implicitly to fulfill their desires”.{{sfn|Tilly|1978|p=54}} He proposes two models to analyze political violence:
# The ''polity'' model takes into account government and groups jockeying for control over power. Thus, both the organizations holding power and the ones challenging them are included.{{sfn|Tilly|1978|p=ch3}} Tilly labels those two groups "members" and "challengers". 
# The ''mobilization'' model aims to describe the behavior of one single party to the political struggle for power. Tilly further divides the model in two sub-categories, one that deals with the internal dynamics of the group, and the other that is concerned with the "external relations" of the entity with other organizations and/or the government. According to Tilly, the cohesiveness of a group mainly relies on the strength of common interests and the degree of organization. Thus, to answer Gurr, anger alone does not automatically create political violence. Political action is contingent on the capacity to organize and unite. It is far from irrational and spontaneous.
Revolutions are included in this theory, although they remain for Tilly particularly extreme since the challenger(s) aim for nothing less than full control over power.{{sfn|Tilly|1978|p=ch7}} The "revolutionary moment occurs when the population needs to choose to obey either the government or an alternative body who is engaged with the government in a zero sum game. This is what Tilly calls "multiple sovereignty".{{sfn|Tilly|1978|p=213}} The success of a revolutionary movement hinges on "the formation of coalitions between members of the polity and the contenders advancing exclusive alternative claims to control over Government.".{{sfn|Tilly|1978|p=213}}

==== Chalmers Johnson and societal values ====
For Chalmers Johnson, rebellions are not so much the product of political violence or collective action but in "the analysis of viable, functioning societies".{{sfn|Johnson|1966|p=3}} In a quasi-biological manner, Johnson sees revolutions as symptoms of pathologies within the societal fabric. A healthy society, meaning a "value-coordinated social system"{{sfn|Johnson|1966|p=36}} does not experience political violence. Johnson's equilibrium is at the intersection between the need for society adapt to changes but at the same time firmly grounded in selective fundamental values. The legitimacy of a political order, he posits, relies exclusively on its compliance with these societal values and in its capacity to integrate and adapt to any change. Rigidity is, in other words, inadmissible. Johnson writes "to make a revolution is to accept violence for the purpose of causing the system to change; more exactly, it is the purposive implementation of a strategy of violence in order to effect a change in social structure".{{sfn|Johnson|1966|p=57}} The aim of a revolution is to re-align a political order on new societal values introduced by an externality that the system itself has not been able to process. Rebellions automatically must face a certain amount of coercion because by becoming "de-synchronized", the now illegitimate political order will have to use coercion to maintain its position. A simplified example would be the French Revolution when the Parisian Bourgeoisie did not recognize the core values and outlook of the King as synchronized with its own orientations. More than the King itself, what really sparked the violence was the uncompromising intransigence of the ruling class. Johnson emphasizes "the necessity of investigating a system's value structure and its problems in order to conceptualize the revolutionary situation in any meaningful way".{{sfn|Johnson|1966|p=32}}

==== Theda Skocpol and the Autonomy of the State ====
Skocpol introduces the concept of the social revolution, to be contrasted with a political revolution. While the later aims to change the polity, the former is "rapid, basic transformations of a society's state and class structures; and they are accompanied and in part carried through by class-based revolts from below".{{sfn|Skocpol|1979|p=4}} Social revolutions are grassroots movement by nature because they do more than change the modalities of power, they aim to transform the fundamental social structure of society. As a corollary, this means that some "revolutions" may cosmetically change the organization of the monopoly over power without engineering any true change in the social fabric of society. Her analysis is limited to studying the French, Russian, and Chinese revolutions. Skocpol identifies three stages of the revolution in these cases (which she believes can be extrapolated and generalized), each accordingly accompanied by specific structural factors which in turn influence the social results of the political action. 
# ''The Collapse of the Old-Regime State'': this is an automatic consequence of certain structural conditions. She highlights the importance of international military and economic competition as well as the pressure of the misfunctioning of domestic affairs. More precisely, she sees the breakdown of the governing structures of society influenced by two theoretical actors, the "landed upper class" and the "imperial state".{{sfn|Skocpol|1979|p=49}} Both could be considered as "partners in exploitation" but in reality competed for resources: the state (monarchs) seek to build up military and economic power to ascertain their geopolitical influence. The upper class works in a logic of [[profit maximization]], meaning preventing as much as possible the state to extract resources. All three revolutions occurred, Skocpol argues, because states failed to be able to "mobilize extraordinary resources from the society and implement in the process reforms requiring structural transformations".{{sfn|Skocpol|1979|p=50}} The apparently contradicting policies were mandated by a unique set of geopolitical competition and modernization. "Revolutionary political crises occurred because of the unsuccessful attempts of the Bourbon, Romanov, and Manchu regimes to cope with foreign pressures."{{sfn|Skocpol|1979|p=50}} Skocpol further concludes "the upshot was the disintegration of centralized administrative and military machineries that had theretofore provided the sole unified bulwark of social and political order".{{sfn|Skocpol|1979|p=51}}
# ''Peasant Uprisings'': more than simply a challenge by the landed upper class in a difficult context, the state needs to be challenged by mass peasant uprisings in order to fall. These uprisings must be aimed not at the political structures ''per se'' but at the upper class itself, so that the political revolution becomes a social one as well. Skocpol quotes Barrington Moore who famously wrote: "peasants [...] provided the dynamite to bring down the old building".{{sfn|Skocpol|1979|p=112}} Peasant uprisings are more effective depending on two given structural socioeconomic conditions: the level of autonomy (from both an economic and political point of view) peasant communities enjoy, and the degree of direct control the upper class on local politics. In other words, peasants must be able to have some degree of agency in order to be able to rebel. If the coercive structures of the state and/or the landowners keep a very close check on peasant activity, then there is no space to forment dissent. 
# ''Societal Transformation'': this is the third and decisive step after the state organization has been seriously weakened and peasant revolts become widespread against landlords. The paradox of the three revolutions Skocpol studies is that stronger centralized and bureaucratic states emerge after the revolts.{{sfn|Skocpol|1979|p=162}} The exact parameters depend, again, on structural factors as opposed to voluntarist factors: in Russia, the new state found most support in the industrial base, rooting itself in cities. In China, most of the support for the revolt had been in the countryside, thus the new polity was grounded in rural areas. In France, the peasantry was not organized enough, and the urban centers not potent enough so that the new state was not firmly grounded in anything, partially explaining its artificiality. 
Here is a summary of the causes and consequences of social revolutions in these three countries, according to Skocpol:{{sfn|Skocpol|1979|p=155}}

=== Microfoundational evidence on causes ===
The following theories are all based on [[Mancur Olson]]'s work in ''[[The Logic of Collective Action]]'',a 1965 book that conceptualizes the inherent [[Tragedy of the commons|problem]] with an activity that has concentrated costs and diffuse benefits. In this case, the benefits of rebellion are seen as a [[public good]], meaning one that is non-excludable and non-rivalrous.{{sfn|Olson|1965|p=9}}  Indeed, the political benefits are generally shared by all in society if a rebellion is successful, not just the individuals that have partaken in the rebellion itself. Olson thus challenges the assumption that simple interests in common are all that is necessary for [[Collective action theory|collective action]]. In fact, he argues the "[[Free rider problem|free rider]]" possibility, a term that means to reap the benefits without paying the price, will deter rational individuals from collective action. That is, unless there is a clear benefit, a rebellion will not happen en masse. Thus, Olson shows that "selective incentives", only made accessible to individuals participating in the collective effort, can solve the free rider problem.{{sfn|Olson|1965|p=76}}

==== ''The Rational Peasant'' ====
{{Main article|The Rational Peasant: The Political Economy of Rural Society in Vietnam}}

Samuel L. Popkin builds on Olson's argument in ''The Rational Peasant: The Political Economy of Rural Society in Vietnam.'' His theory is based on the figure of a hyper rational peasant that bases his decision to join (or not) a rebellion uniquely on a cost-benefit analysis. This formalist view of the collective action problem stresses the importance of individual economic rationality and self-interest: a peasant, according to Popkin, will disregard the ideological dimension of a social movement and focus instead on whether or not it will bring any practical benefit to him. According to Popkin, peasant society is based on a precarious structure of economic instability. Social norms, he writes, are "malleable, renegotiated, and shifting in accord with considerations of power and strategic interaction among individuals"{{sfn|Popkin|1979|p=22}} Indeed, the constant insecurity and inherent risk to the peasant condition, due to the peculiar nature of the patron-client relationship that binds the peasant to his landowner, forces the peasant to look inwards when he has a choice to make. Popkin argues that peasants rely on their "private, family investment for their long run security and that they will be interested in short term gain vis-à-vis the village. They will attempt to improve their long-run security by moving to a position with higher income and less variance".{{sfn|Popkin|1979|p=23}} Popkin stresses this "investor logic" that one may not expect in agrarian societies, usually seen as pre-capitalist communities where traditional social and power structures prevent the accumulation of capital. Yet, the selfish determinants of collective action are, according to Popkin, a direct product of the inherent instability of peasant life. The goal of a laborer, for example, will be to move to a tenant position, then smallholder, then landlord; where there is less variance and more income. Voluntarism is thus non-existent in such communities.

Popkin singles out four variables that impact individual participation:
# Contribution to the expenditure of resources: collective action has a cost in terms of contribution, and especially if it fails (an important consideration with regards to rebellion) 
# Rewards : the direct (more income) and indirect (less oppressive central state) rewards for collective action 
# Marginal impact of the peasant's contribution to the success of collective action
# Leadership "viability and trust" : to what extent the resources pooled will be effectively used.
Without any moral commitment to the community, this situation will engineer free riders. Popkin argues that selective incentives are necessary to overcome this problem.{{sfn|Popkin|1979|p=34}}

===== Opportunity cost of rebellion =====
Political Scientist Christopher Blattman and World Bank economist Laura Alston identify rebellious activity as an "occupational choice".{{sfn|Blattman and Rason|2015|p=22}} They draw a parallel between criminal activity and rebellion, arguing that the risks and potential payoffs an individual must calculate when making the decision to join such a movement remains similar between the two activities. In both cases, only a selected few reap important benefits, while most of the members of the group do not receive similar payoffs.{{sfn|Blattman and Rason|2015|p=23}} The choice to rebel is inherently linked with its opportunity cost, namely what an individual is ready to give up in order to rebel. Thus, the available options beside rebellious or criminal activity matter just as much as the rebellion itself when the individual makes the decision. Blattman and Alston, however, recognize that "a poor person's best strategy" might be both rebellion illicit and legitimate activities at the same time.{{sfn|Blattman and Rason|2015|p=23}} Individuals, they argue, can often have a varied "portofolio" of activities, suggesting that they all operate on a rational, profit maximizing logic. The authors conclude that the best way to fight rebellion is to increase its opportunity cost, both by more enforcement but also by minimizing the potential material gains of a rebellion.{{sfn|Blattman and Rason|2015|p=23}}

===== Selective incentives based on group membership =====
The decision to join a rebellion can be based on the prestige and social status associated with membership in the rebellious group. More than material incentives for the individual, rebellions offer their members [[club good]]s, [[public good]]s that are reserved only for the members inside that group. Economist [[Eli Berman]] and Political Scientist David D. Laitin's study of radical religious groups show that the appeal of club goods can help explain individual membership. Berman and Laitin discuss [[Suicide attack|suicide]] operations, meaning acts that have the highest cost for an individual. They find that in such a framework, the real danger to an organization is not volunteering but preventing defection. Furthermore, the decision to enroll in such high stakes organization can be rationalized.{{sfn|Berman and Laitin|2008|p=1965}} Berman and Laitin show that religious organizations supplant the state when it fails to provide an acceptable quality of public goods such a public safety, basic infrastructure, access to utilities, or schooling.{{sfn|Berman and Laitin|2008|p=1944}} Suicide operations "can be explained as a costly signal of “commitment” to the community".{{sfn|Berman and Laitin|2008|p=1943}} They further note "Groups less adept at extracting signals of commitment (sacrifices) may not be able to consistently enforce incentive compatibility."{{sfn|Berman and Laitin|2008|p=1954}} Thus, rebellious groups can organize themselves to ''ask'' of members proof of commitment to the cause. Club goods serve not so much to coax individuals into joining but to prevent defection.

===== Greed vs grievance model =====
{{Main article|Greed versus grievance}}
World Bank economists [[Paul Collier]] and Anke Hoeffler compare two dimensions of incentives:
# [[Greed]] rebellion: "motivated by predation of the rents from primary commodity exports, subject to an economic calculus of costs and a military survival constraint".{{sfn|Collier and Hoeffler|2002|p=26}}
# [[Grievance]] rebellion: "motivated by hatreds which might be intrinsic to ethnic and religious differences, or reflected objective resentments such as domination by an [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] majority, political repression, or [[economic inequality]]".{{sfn|Collier and Hoeffler|2002|p=26}} The two main sources of grievance are political exclusion and inequality.
Vollier and Hoeffler find that the model based on grievance variables systematically fails to predict past conflicts, while the model based on greed performs well. The authors posit that the high cost of risk to society is not taken into account seriously by the grievance model: individuals are fundamentally risk-adverse. However, they allow that conflicts create grievances, which in turn can become risk factors. Contrary to established beliefs, they also find that a multiplicity of ethnic communities make society safer, since individuals will be automatically more cautious, at the opposite of the grievance model predictions.{{sfn|Collier and Hoeffler|2002|p=26}} Finally, the authors also note that the grievances expressed by members of the [[diaspora]] of a community in turmoil has an important on the continuation of violence.{{sfn|Collier and Hoeffler|2002|p=27}} Both greed and grievance thus need to be included in the reflection.

==== ''The Moral Economy of the Peasant'' ====
{{Main article|The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Rebellion and Subsistence in Southeast Asia}}

Spearheaded by political scientist and anthropologist [[James C. Scott]] in his  book ''[[The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Rebellion and Subsistence in Southeast Asia|The Moral Economy of the Peasant]]'', the [[moral economy]] school considers moral variables such as social norms, moral values, interpretation of justice, and conception of duty to the community as the prime influencers of the decision to rebel. This perspective still adheres to Olson's framework, but it considers different variables to enter the cost/benefit analysis: the individual is still believed to be rational, albeit not on material but moral grounds.{{sfn|Scott|1976|p=6}}

===== Early conceptualization: E. P. Thompson and bread riots in England =====
Before being fully conceptualized by Scott, British historian [[E. P. Thompson|E.P. Thompson]] was the first to use the term "moral economy" in ''Moral Economy of the English Crowd in the Eighteenth Century''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=E. P.|date=1971-01-01|title=The Moral Economy of the English Crowd in the Eighteenth Century|jstor=650244|journal=Past &amp; Present|issue=50|pages=76–136}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this work, he discussed English bread riots, regular, localized form of rebellion by English peasants all through the 18th century. Such events, Thompson argues, have been routinely dismissed as "riotous", with the connotation of being disorganized, spontaneous, undirected, and undisciplined. In other words, anecdotal. The reality, he suggests, was otherwise: such riots involved a coordinated peasant action, from the pillaging of food convoys to the seizure of grain shops. Here, while a scholar such as Popkin would have argued that the peasants were trying to gain material benefits (crudely: more food), Thompson sees a legitimization factor, meaning "a belief that [the peasants] were defending traditional rights and customs".  Thompson goes on to write: "[the riots were] legitimized by the assumptions of an older moral economy, which taught the immorality of any unfair method of forcing up the price of provisions by profiteering upon the necessities of the people". Later, reflecting on this work, Thompson would also write: "My object of analysis was the ''mentalité'', or, as I would prefer, the political culture, the expectations, traditions, and indeed, superstitions of the working population most frequently involved in actions in the market".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Customs-Common-Studies-Traditional-Popular/dp/1565840747|title=Customs in Common: Studies in Traditional Popular Culture|last=Thompson|first=E. P.|date=1993-08-01|publisher=The New Press|isbn=9781565840744|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposition between a traditional, paternalist, and the communitarian set of values clashing with the inverse liberal, capitalist, and market-derived ethics is central to explain rebellion.

===== James C. Scott and the formalization of the moral economy argument=====
In [[The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Rebellion and Subsistence in Southeast Asia|The Moral Economy of Peasant: Rebellion and Subsistence in Southeast Asia]], James C. Scott looks at the impact of exogenous economic and political shocks on peasant communities in Southeast Asia. Scott finds that peasants are mostly in the business of surviving and producing enough to subsist.{{sfn|Scott|1976|p=15}} Therefore, any extractive regime needs to respect this careful equilibrium. He labels this phenomenon the "subsistence ethic".{{sfn|Scott|1976|p=13}} A landowner operating in such communities is seen to have the moral duty to prioritize the peasant's subsistence over his constant benefit. According to Scott, the powerful colonial state accompanied by market capitalism did not respect this fundamental hidden law in peasant societies. Rebellious movements occurred as the reaction to an emotional grief, a moral outrage.{{sfn|Scott|1976|p=193}}

===== Other non-material incentives=====
[[Chris Blattman|Blattman]] and Ralston recognize the importance of immaterial selective incentives, such as anger, outrage, and injustice ("grievance") in the roots of rebellions. These variable,s they argue, are far from being irrational, as they are sometimes presented. They identify three main types of grievance arguments:
# ''Intrinsic [[incentive]]s'' holds that "[[injustice]] or perceived transgression generates an intrinsic willingness to punish or seek retribution".{{sfn|Blattman and Rason|2015|p=24}} More than material rewards, individuals are naturally and automatically prompted to fight for justice if they feel they have been wronged. The [[ultimatum game]] is an excellent illustration: player one receives $10 and must split it with another player who doesn't get the chance to determine how much he receives, but only if the deal is made or not (if he refuses, everyone loses their money). Rationally, player 2 should take whatever the deal is because it is better in absolute term ($1 more remains $1 more). However, player 2 is most likely unwilling to accept less than 2 or 2 dollars, meaning that they are willing to pay a-$2 for justice to be respected. This game, according to Blattman and Ralston, represents "the expressive pleasure people gain from punishing an injustice".{{sfn|Blattman and Rason|2015|p=24}}
# ''[[Loss aversion]]'' holds that "people tend to evaluate their satisfaction relative to a reference point, and that they are 'loss adverse".{{sfn|Blattman and Rason|2015|p=25}} Individuals prefer not losing over the risky strategy of making gains. There is a substantial [[Subjectivity|subjective]] part to this, however, as some may realize alone and decide that they are comparatively less well off than a neighbor, for example. To "fix" this gap, individuals will in turn be ready to take great risks so as to not enshrine a loss.{{sfn|Blattman and Rason|2015|p=25}}
# ''Frustration-aggression'': this model holds that the immediate emotional reactions to highly stressful environments do not obey to any "direct utility benefit but rather a more impulsive and emotional response to a threat".{{sfn|Blattman and Rason|2015|p=25}} There are limits to this theory: violent action is to a large extent a product of goals by an individual which are in turn determined by a set of [[preference]]s.{{sfn|Blattman and Rason|2015|p=26}} Yet, this approach shows that contextual elements like economic precarity have a non-negligible impact on the conditions of the decisions to rebel at minimum.

== Recruitment ==
Stathis N. Kalyvas, a political science professor at Yale University, argues that political violence is heavily influenced by hyperlocal socio-economic factors, from the mundane traditional family rivalries to repressed grudges.{{sfn|Kalyvas|2003|p=476}} Rebellion, or any sort of political violence, are not binary conflicts but must be understood as interactions between public and private identities and actions. The "convergence of local motives and supralocal imperatives" make studying and theorizing rebellion a very complex affair, at the intersection between the political and the private, the collective and the individual.{{sfn|Kalyvas|2003|p=475}}
Kalyvas argues that we often try to group political conflicts according to two structural paradigms:
# The idea that political violence, and more specifically rebellion, is characterized by a complete breakdown of authority and an anarchic state. This is inspired by Thomas Hobbes' views. The approach sees rebellion as being motivated by greed and loot, using violence to break down the power structures of society.{{sfn|Kalyvas|2003|p=476}}
# The idea that all political violence is inherently motivated by an abstract group of loyalties and beliefs, "whereby the political enemy becomes a private adversary only by virtue of prior collective and impersonal enmity".{{sfn|Kalyvas|2003|p=476}} Violence is thus not a "man to man" affair as much as a :state to state" struggle, if not an "idea vs idea" conflict.{{sfn|Kalyvas|2003|p=476}}
Kalyvas' key insight is that the central vs periphery dynamic is fundamental in political conflicts. Any individual actor, Kalyvas posits, enters into a calculated ''alliance'' with the collective.{{sfn|Kalyvas|2003|p=486}} Rebellions thus cannot be analyzed in molar categories, nor should we assume that individuals are automatically in line with the rest of the actors simply by virtue of ideological, religious, ethnic, or class cleavage. The agency is located both within the collective and in the individual, in the universal and the local.{{sfn|Kalyvas|2003|p=486}} Kalyvas writes: "Alliance entails a ''transaction'' between supralocal and local actors, whereby the former supply the later with external muscle, thus allowing them to win decisive local advantage, in exchange the former rely on local conflicts to recruit and motivate supporters and obtain local control, resources, and information- even when their ideological agenda is opposed to localism".{{sfn|Kalyvas|2003|p=486}} Individuals will thus aim to use the rebellion in order to gain some sort of local advantage, while the collective actors will aim to gain power. Violence is a mean as opposed to a goal, according to Kalyvas.

The greater takeaway from this central/local analytical lens is that violence is not an anarchic tactic or a manipulation by an ideology, but a conversation between the two. Rebellions are "concatenations of multiple and often disparate local cleavages, more or less loosely arranged around the master cleavage".{{sfn|Kalyvas|2003|p=486}} Any pre-conceived explanation or theory of a conflict must not be placated on a situation, lest one will construct a reality that adapts itself to his pre-conceived idea. Kalyvas thus argues that political conflict is not always political in the sense that they cannot be reduced to a certain discourse, decisions, or ideologies from the "center" of collective action. Instead, the focus must be on "local cleavages and intracommunity dynamics".{{sfn|Kalyvas|2003|p=487}} Furthermore, rebellion is not "a mere mechanism that opens up the floodgates to random and anarchical private violence".{{sfn|Kalyvas|2003|p=487}} Rather, it is the result of a careful and precarious alliance between local motivations and collective vectors to help the individual cause.

{{expand section| Correcting the abstractions and anecdotes, and write a comprehensive overview of the classification of rebellion. |date=May 2016}}

An armed but limited rebellion is an insurrection,&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd edition, 1989. Insurrection: "The action of rising in arms or open resistance against established authority or governmental restraint; with pl., an instance of this, an armed rising, a revolt; an incipient or limited rebellion."&lt;/ref&gt; and if the established government does not recognize the rebels as [[belligerent]]s then they are insurgents and the revolt is an [[insurgency]].&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd edition, 1989. Insurgent "One who rises in revolt against constituted authority; a rebel who is not recognized as a belligerent."&lt;/ref&gt; In a larger conflict the rebels may be recognized as [[belligerent]]s without their government being recognized by the established government, in which case the conflict becomes a [[civil war]].&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Kermit L.''The Oxford Guide to United States Supreme Court Decisions'', Oxford University Press US, 2001. {{ISBN|0-19-513924-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-19-513924-2}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=nO093wNz1PoC&amp;pg=RA1-PA246&amp;dq=insurrection+civil+war&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3 pp. 246,247] "In supporting Lincoln on this issue, the Supreme Court upheld his theory of the Civil War as an insurrection against the United States government that could be suppressed according to the rules of war. In this way the United States was able to fight the war as if it were an international war, without actually having to recognize the ''de jure'' existence of the Confederate government."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Civil resistance]] movements have often aimed at, and brought about, the fall of a government or head of state, and in these cases could be considered a form of rebellion. In many of these cases the opposition movement saw itself not only as nonviolent, but also as upholding their country's constitutional system against a government that was unlawful, for example if it had refused to acknowledge its defeat in an election. Thus the term "rebel" does not always capture the element in some of these movements of acting as a defender of legality and constitutionalism.&lt;ref&gt;See the chapters by specialists on the various above-cited cases of civil resistance in [[Adam Roberts (scholar)|Adam Roberts]] and [[Timothy Garton Ash]] (eds.), ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present'', Oxford University Press, 2009. See [https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&amp;dq=Civil+resistance+and+power+politics&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s].&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of terms that are associated with ''rebel'' and ''rebellion''. They range from those with positive connotations to those with pejorative connotations. Examples include:
* [[Civil resistance]], [[civil disobedience]], and [[nonviolent resistance]] which do not include violence or paramilitary force .{{Citation needed|reason=Who defined this term in this way=April 2016|date=April 2016}}
* [[Mutiny]], which is carried out by military or security forces against their commanders {{Citation needed|reason=Who defined this term in this way=April 2016|date=April 2016}}
* Armed [[resistance movement]], which is carried out by [[Resistance movement#Freedom fighter|freedom fighters]], often against an occupying foreign power {{Citation needed|reason=Who defined this term in this way=April 2016|date=April 2016}}
* Revolt, a term that is sometimes used for a more localized rebellions rather than a general uprising {{Citation needed|reason=Who defined this term in this way=April 2016|date=April 2016}}
* [[Revolution]], which is carried out by radicals, usually meant to overthrow the current [[government]] {{Citation needed|reason=Who defined this term in this way=April 2016|date=April 2016}}
* [[Riot]], a form of civil disorder involving violent public disturbance
* [[Subversion]], which are non-overt attempts at sabotaging a government, carried out by spies or other subversives {{Citation needed|reason=Who defined this term in this way=April 2016|date=April 2016}}
* [[Terrorism]], which is carried out by different kinds of political, economic or religious [[Militant (word)|militant]] individuals or groups {{Citation needed|reason=Who defined this term in this way=April 2016|date=April 2016}}

&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|'''سیّد صادِقَین احمد نقوی '''}}}}), ''[[Tamgha-e-Imtiaz]], [[Pride of Performance]], [[Sitara-e-Imtiaz]],'' also often referred to as Sadequain Naqqash, was a Pakistani artist, best known for his skills as a calligrapher and a painter. He is considered as one of the finest painters and calligraphers [[Pakistan]] has ever produced.&lt;ref name="Amazing" /&gt; He was also a poet, writing hundreds of [[rubāʿiyāt]] in the style of [[Omar Khayyam]] and [[Sarmad Kashani]].&lt;ref&gt;Iftikhar Dadi, ''Modernism and the Art of Muslim South Asia'', Univ of North Carolina Press (2010), p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Sadequain was born on June 30, 1923 in [[Amroha]], into a family of calligraphers.&lt;ref name=DailyTimes/&gt; In late 1940s he joined the Progressive Writers and Artists Movement. His true talent was discovered by [[Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy]] who brought Sadequain into the limelight.&lt;ref&gt;[[Begum Shaista Suhrawardy Ikramullah]], ''Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy: a biography'', Oxford University Press, 1991. {{ISBN|978-0-19-577414-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TNI/&gt; He also spent some time in Paris augmenting his skills.&lt;ref&gt;Partha Mitter, Indian Art, Oxford University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|978-0-19-284221-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sadequain received much praise for his [[calligraphic]] style, which is widely considered iconic by many critics of South Asian art.&lt;ref name=DailyTimes&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dailytimes.com.pk/4174/calligraphy-maestro-sadequains-birthday-goes-unnoticed/|title=Calligraphy maestro Sadequain's birthday goes unnoticed|author=Arsalan Haider|date=1 July 2017|publisher=Daily Times (newspaper)|accessdate=9 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Calligraphy ===
Sadequain was part of a broader Islamic art movement that emerged independently across North Africa and parts of Asia in the 1950s and known as the ''[[Jordanian art#Hurufiyah Art_Movement|hurufiyah art movement]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Dadi. I., "Ibrahim El Salahi and Calligraphic Modernism in a Comparative Perspective," ''South Atlantic Quarterly,'' 109 (3), 2010 pp 555-576, DOI:https://doi.org/10.121500382876-2010-006; Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1294 &lt;/ref&gt; Hurufiyah refers to the attempt by artists to combine traditional art forms, notably calligraphy as a graphic element within a contemporary artwork.&lt;ref&gt;Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' Online: https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5/;Tuohy, A. and Masters, C., ''A-Z Great Modern Artists,'' Hachette UK, 2015, p. 56; Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1294&lt;/ref&gt; Hurufiyah artists rejected Western art concepts, and instead searched for a new visual languages that reflected their own culture and heritage. These artists successfully transformed calligraphy into a modern aesthetic, which was both contemporary and indigenous.&lt;ref&gt;Lindgren, A. and Ross, S., ''The Modernist World,'' Routledge, 2015, p. 495; Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' Online: https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5/; Tuohy, A. and Masters, C., ''A-Z Great Modern Artists,'' Hachette UK, 2015, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to Sadeqain's work, only a few painters had experimented with the medium in [[Pakistan]]. Sadequain is a pioneer of the style, bringing calligraphy into a mainstream art form, and influencing subsequent generations of Pakistani artists.

Salahi carried the script with a flourish in all directions, giving it the 'power of space, vigor and volume'.&lt;ref&gt;Abdul Hamid Akhund, Farida Munavarjahan Said and Zohra Yusuf (ed.), Sadequain: The Holy Sinner, Mohatta Palace Museum, [[Karachi]]. {{ISBN|969-8100-17-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sadequain painted classical literature from the poetic verses of [[Ghalib]], [[Muhammad Iqbal|Iqbal]] and Faiz. He belonged to the school of thought which enriched [[Realism (arts)|realism]] with [[lyricism]]. His work was essentially linear. He also illustrated French Nobel Prize–winning writer [[Albert Camus]], [[Ghalib]], [[Muhammad Iqbal|Iqbal]], and [[Faiz Ahmed Faiz|Faiz]]. Thousand of the drawings he executed, were given away to his admirers. He wrote and published hundreds of quartets.

Sadequain was the most prolific painter in the period following the [[Pakistan Movement|independence]] of [[Pakistan]] in 1947. He was constantly at work and he worked on large scale. He repeatedly stated that he was not interested in decorating drawing rooms of rich and powerful. He worked on large murals for public buildings, symbolic of the collective labour of humanity, and his work was mostly donated to the public.

Sadequain in his own words was primarily a painter of figures with allegorical significance.

=== Murals ===
[[File:Roof of Frere Hall (2).JPG|thumb|right|300px|Ceiling of [[Frere Hall]]]]
[[File:Roof of Frere Hall.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Ceiling of [[Frere Hall]]]]
Sadequain was a social commentator. His [[murals]] depict man's endless quest to discover and develop the potentialities that lie within him. His murals are densely filled and tightly packed with images to render adequately the lofty subject. As a master [[muralist]] some of his works adorn the halls of:
* The [[State Bank of Pakistan]] (100 x 12&amp;nbsp;ft)&lt;ref name="Holy"/&gt;
* The Power House at the [[Mangla Dam]] (170 x 23&amp;nbsp;ft)
* [[Lahore Museum]], [[Lahore]]&lt;ref name="LahoreMuseum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/434064/sadequain-mural-long-process-of-restoration-begins/|title=Sadequain mural: Long process of restoration begins|author= Sonia Malik|date= 10 September 2012|publisher=The Express Tribune (newspaper)|accessdate=9 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Aligarh Muslim University]] (70 x 12&amp;nbsp;ft)
* [[Banaras Hindu University]] (70 x 12&amp;nbsp;ft) and
* [[Geological Society of India|Geological Institute of India]] (70 x 25&amp;nbsp;ft)
* [[Frere Hall]] [[Karachi]]
* Powerhouse at [[Abu Dhabi]]
* [[University of the Punjab|Punjab University Library]]

His monumental murals, in excess of thirty-five, adorn the halls of State Bank, Frere Hall Karachi; Lahore Museum; Punjab University; Mangla Dam; Aligarh Muslim University; Banaras Hindu University; Indian Institute of Geological Sciences; Islamic Institute in Delhi, and Abu Dhabi Power House, among others. His paintings and calligraphies in the building of Islamic Institute in Delhi alone cover more than seven thousand square feet. Sadequain painted his earliest murals at Jinnah Hospital and PIA headquarters in 1950s. These murals have disappeared and their fate is unknown.

In 1961 he painted the huge mural (62'X10') in the Head Office of the State Bank of Pakistan at Karachi, titled "Treasures of Time," in which he showed the intellectual advance of man from the times of Socrates to that of lqbal and Einstein. It is a linear creation that shows a pageant of intellectuals and thinkers of the Greek era, mathematicians and chemists of the Middle East, the scholars of the European Renaissance, and the 20th-century laureates. This large mural has endured transportation from the State Bank to Mohatta Palace (for the exhibition The Holy Sinner), and back to State Bank and has deep scars to prove the ordeal.

Sadequain painted the ceiling of the Lahore museum entrance hall, depicting Evolution of Mankind, and additional nine large panels of calligraphies for the Islamic Gallery. The ceiling spans approximately 100 x {{convert|35|ft|m}}. The Panjab government has recently allocated money for the restoration of the mural.&lt;ref name="LahoreMuseum" /&gt;

Punjab University houses the mural "Quest of Knowledge" in its library. The mural appropriately depicts the academic theme commensurate with the institution of learning where it is housed. Young men and women are shown holding high the key to learning that unleashes riches in their lives. The mural is mounted high up against the ceiling of the main library and appears to be in good condition.

The mural in the Punjab Library (adjacent to Lahore Museum) is mounted in the library hall located on the main floor. All four sections of the mural have been disassembled and dismounted because of the damage to the building due to water seepage.

The ceiling of the [[Frere Hall]], Karachi displays in bold, the words, ''Arz-o-Samawat'' (Earth and the Heavens) bears a historical significance, since it represents the last piece of work by Sadequain. He died before he could complete it.&lt;ref name=TNI2/&gt; Before he started painting the stupendous mural on the ceiling he dedicated it to the citizens of the great city of Karachi. The mural is for the citizens to cherish and it should be treated as a national treasure. However, because of the security conditions the citizens are deprived of entry in Frere Hall and the impressive historical building along with the Mural lie in desperate need of care. The bright colours Sadequain used in the mural to depict the Earth and the Heavens are fading away because of the environmental conditions. The large mural is painted on dozens of individual panels that are put together like the pieces of a puzzle. Several of the panels are detached and hang down under their own weight. It is only a matter of time before the panels start falling apart.

The mural titled "Saga of Labor" by Sadequain at Mangla Dam is a glowing tribute to the working men and women of all times and places who form the backbone of any society. The mural hangs in the powerhouse of Mangla Dam and so far endured the harsh environmental conditions of the huge enclosure that also houses gigantic electric turbines.

Banaras Hindu University houses one large mural. It is kept in good condition because of care provided to it by the authorities.

In addition to the murals mentioned above, Sadequain did many others, perhaps in the neighbourhood of over thirty-five in all. However, whereabouts of several of them are not certain. For example, one mural was done for the Naval Headquarters, but cannot be located. There was one done for the PIA's office in Paris, which does not exist at that location. There were murals dedicated to the War of 1965 that cannot be traced.

Sadequain painted thousands of paintings, drawings, and murals in his lifetime. He hardly ever sold his work and mostly gave it away; sometimes his work was simply taken, and sometimes even stolen. In his lifetime there were two galleries named after him by the authorities, but they no longer exist.

===Speaker of truth===

In an interview he said, "People ask why I don't paint flowers, butterflies and landscapes? I tell them that I seek the truth and I am after reality. I am not inspired by someone posing against the backdrop of roses in a vase or pink curtains. What inspires me is a person who has gone hungry for hours and is struggling for survival. The expression that lights his face at the end of the day when he has finally found some scraps, that is what touches me. I am a painter of the expression of reality."{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Self-proclaimed "[[Faqir]]," Sadequain was outside society's worldly greed or hypocrisy and called himself "speaker of truth."

Best known for his calligraphies, Sadequain painted abstracts, drawings, and sketches on thousands of canvases, volumes of paper, and multitudes of other conventional and unconventional materials.

===Renaissance of Islamic calligraphy===
Sadequain was responsible for the renaissance of [[Islamic calligraphy]] in Pakistan. He was one of the greatest calligraphers of Pakistan and helped transform the art of calligraphy into serious expressionist paintings. He claimed that his transformation into a calligrapher was manifested by divine inspiration. He did not follow the established tradition and created his own style of script.&lt;ref name=archive/&gt; His alphabets exude motion, mood, and paint vivid pictures of the message of the words of [[Quran]]. Sadequain claimed that many of his paintings, especially after the seventies, had been based on calligraphic forms to portray images of cities, buildings, forests, men, and women.

In [[Pakistan]], the art of calligraphy was relegated to a second-class status until Sadequain adapted this medium in the late nineteen sixties. Until then a few painters experimented with the medium but it remained just that, an experiment. After Sadequain transformed the art of calligraphy into a mainstream art form, most of the known Pakistani artists have followed Sadequain and calligraphic art now dominates the art scene.

===True artist===
In nineteen sixties Sadequain was invited by the French authorities to illustrate the award-winning novel "The Stranger" by French writer [[Albert Camus]]. Sadequain also illustrated on canvas the poetry of [[Ghalib]], [[Muhammad Iqbal|Iqbal]] and Faiz as homage to their place in classical literature. Sadequain wrote thousands of quartets, which address a common theme of social and cultural dogmas and published them.

A special word is warranted about the large murals Sadequain painted, which are spread all over the subcontinent. His murals depict man's struggle, his achievements and persistent thirst to discover his endless potential. His murals are full of activity, ideas, and they read like an unfolding story about their particular theme.

One of his most powerful works is the gigantic mural measuring 200×30 feet for the Power House of [[Mangla Dam]]. He completed it in an incredible period of three months during which he worked day and night. Aptly so, the mural is titled "The Saga of Labor," The mural, one of the largest in the world portrays the history of mankind. Its pays homage to its characters, which are exclusively labourers and worker, facing and struggling against the powerful elements of nature.

Sadequain was a social commentator. He crafted his message on canvas by the aid of powerful symbols and rich colours. Characteristically he would address particular situations through a series of paintings, which would follow a common theme and yet maintain their individuality. His symbols transformed with time as he adapted to the changing conditions.

===His works===
[[File:Sketch, Frere Hall.JPG|thumb|Sketch Sadequain with Muhammad Ali Jinnah, by Sadequain, on display at Frere Hall]]
During the 1960s he stayed in interior [[Sindh]], in areas surrounded by desert, where nothing could grow except cactus which would break through the rugged sandy ground. The sight of the wild cactus growing in scorching heat and surviving the harshest of conditions left a lasting impression on Sadequain. He adapted this symbol to depict labour, struggle, and persistence against natural elements of resistance and triumph of hard work.

Sadequain sketched numerous drawings titled Cobweb Series, Crow Series, Christ Series, Hope Series, and Sun Series during the sixties, which were commentaries on prevailing social and cultural conditions. Sadequain saw cobwebs engulfing our society rendering it speechless and motionless. The Crow Series projected men as timid worshippers of scarecrows because they have lost self-respect and spirituality. Crows however are not intimidated and gang up on humanity in flocks and pick on lifeless humans. In the Christ Series Sadequain showed the crime being committed in front of the Christ while he was still alive on the Cross.

Contrary to man's images portrayed in Cobweb or Crow Series of drawings, Sadequain glorified the hard work and labour of ordinary workingmen by showing them struggling with primitive tools during the stone age, developing agricultural land, discovering scientific breakthroughs, and exploring the universe. He sometimes used Kufic script to form human images and carried that theme through vast canvases. One of the representative works of this genre is titled "The Last Supper," which was awarded the prestigious Binnale de Paris award in France. Sadequain was awarded first prize in National Exhibition of [[Pakistan]] in the early sixties. He was bestowed with several awards and medals in [[Pakistan]] as well as foreign counties. But he seldom attended the award ceremonies neither accepted the award money.

Sadequain had a commanding knowledge of literature. He wrote thousands of "Rubaiyats," which he published in several books. These verses have been adjudged unique and critically acclaimed by literary elite. Like his paintings, the verses also address the topics of human nature, virtues and weaknesses of society.

During his life Sadequain exhibited his works on all continents. His exhibitions in foreign countries were sponsored at State levels and were attended by large audiences from all walks of life. A "faqir" at heart he gave away most of his paintings to friends and foes, and painted gigantic murals in public buildings at no cost. He declared the giveaways as gifts to the citizens of the cities where the public buildings were situated.

Sadequain has been covered in the print and electronic media extensively such as the TV series "Mojeeza-e-Fun" which highlighted his work in a masterful documentary. "The Holy Sinner" is a book published in 2003, cataloguing a number of his paintings, which were exhibited at [[Mohatta Palace]], [[Karachi]] during the same year. The massive book is one of the largest and heaviest ever published in [[Pakistan]] and it also has a collection of articles about Sadequain published previously in magazines and papers over the course of years.

===Reverence===

The mammoth book "[[The Holy Sinner]]: Sadequain",&lt;ref name="Holy"&gt;[http://www.dawn.com/news/134395/karachi-sadequain-the-holy-sinner-launched KARACHI: Sadequain: The Holy Sinner launched] DAWN (newspaper), Published 10 August 2003, Retrieved 9 February 2018&lt;/ref&gt; is a tribute and celebration of this Pakistani artist's vitality, innovation, restless fervor and immense amount of energy. This book launched as the third stage of a monumental project with the same title is possibly the largest art project in the sub-continent to pay tribute to a single artist under the aegis of Mohatta Palace Museum. The first stage of the project was an exhibition of paintings of Sadequain under the same title and the second stage of the project; a black and white catalogue of Sadequain's work was launched last year. The fourth stage of the project will consist of four documentaries; both in [[Urdu]] and English language and one special feature film would be produced about the internationally recognised artist.&lt;ref name="Holy"/&gt;

The book of about 700 pages, weighing 12&amp;nbsp;kg, includes the reproduction of some 400 of Sadequain's creations, supported by an anthology of critical commentaries by the artist's contemporaries and journalists including renowned artistic figures and critics. It contains essays on the great artist and plates of his paintings and sketches. The sections in the book consist of Photographic Essay, Critical Approaches, Recollections, Reproductions, Catalogue, Pictures at an Exhibition, Rubaiyat, Photo Epilogue, Afterward, Life and Works. The book is largest monograph in the region compiled and produced to pay unprecedented tribute to a single artist, setting a new trend for paying tributes to artists in South Asia.

Some of the themes of the paintings in the book are 'A stranger in paradise', 'Endless purgatory', 'Rhapsody in Blue', 'Wheel in fire', 'A long day', 'Of human bondage' also included in bold form the poetic verses of [[Ghalib]], [[Muhammad Iqbal|Iqbal]] and Faiz.

The book is primarily based on the famous exhibition of paintings of Sadequain titled, ''The Holy Sinner: Sadequain'' which ended about a year ago and was by far the largest-attended and longest-running exhibition in the history of Pakistani art. [[Salima Hashmi]], daughter of the late poet [[Faiz Ahmad Faiz]] and [[Hameed Haroon]], proprietor of Dawn Publications were the co-curators of the groundbreaking exhibition. The exhibition, featuring more than 200 non-calligraphic works of the [[Amroha]]-born artist, was held at [[Mohatta Palace]] Museum and it remained open for approximately one year.&lt;ref name="Holy"/&gt;

The exhibition was attended by more than 90,000 art lovers at a cost of Rs 100 each who saw rare paintings and murals by Sadequain whose commercial worth, at a low estimate, was more than Rs 500&amp;nbsp;million.

Sadequain was an untraditional and self-made, self-taught painter and calligrapher who created a mysterious and mystic environment with his bold and uninhibited use of media and lines had a cult-like following in his own lifetime. His unique style, whether pertaining to his paintings or calligraphy, was widely referred to as "Khat-e-Sadequain" primarily evolved during his stay at a [[Karachi]] seaside desert called [[Gadani]]. The Holy Sinner: Sadequain contains over 400 of his series of drawings, paintings, and murals, each representing a different phase of his career and depicting his unique strokes, style, and color schemes. It was at Gadani that Sadequain observed the wild growth of cactus in the scorching heat of desert where water was scarce and conditions were harshest. Yet the cactus grew tall, shooting upwards in defiance of all odds. The powerful symbol of defiant cactus transcends throughout Sadequain’s work and creates a lasting impression on the observer.

The exhibition was a rare opportunity for the viewers because Sadequain, who became a virtual household word for his calligraphic works did not exhibit his abstract paintings during the last days of his life and of course the large number of murals that he painted were dedicated to specific locations only. [[Hameed Haroon]] described very aptly as follows: "Sadequain's symbols are part-calligraphic strokes, part-sacred standards or alams that first emerged in the eighth century as the symbols of the armies of Shi'ite Islam, perhaps most visible as representations of allegorical virtue in the annual Moharram ritual following the [[Battle of Karbala|Karbala massacre]]; part Sufic tributes to the son-in-law of the [[Prophets in Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]], the martyred Ali, whose horned alif in the Kufic script provokes a militancy of sentiment and a plea for transformation based, ironically enough, on the fundamentals of early Islam."

The paintings in the exhibition were loaned by virtually who is who of the Pakistani elite. In his lifetime Sadequain hardly ever sold his paintings to individuals. As an ironic twist of circumstances he is perhaps the only artist with the distinction that his work is openly copied and sold for handsome profits by his imitators. Recently two news stories were printed in local papers, which testify, in the most unconventional manner, to the great stature of Sadequain. Both news stories were related to burglars, one in which a house belonging to one of the prominent artists in [[Karachi]] was broken in and the thieves got away with jewellery and other petty items, and the other incident involved the house of a well to do citizen where the stolen items included only the paintings by Sadequain.

The book, The Holy Sinner: Sadequain, includes drawings series titled, Cacti series, the Sun series, Exposition series, Cobweb series, etc. A word about the Cobweb series is appropriate because it was created during the turbulent times of 1960s and the drawings depict men and women, even the building structures immobilised by cobwebs as though in decay and transgressing instead of marching on the rocky road to the peaks of perfection.

The paintings in The Holy Sinner: Sadequain, represent various themes such as man’s struggle against natural odds, mother and child, still life figures from the early life of the artist and many others. The centerpiece of the book is its treatment of the famous mural by Sadequain commissioned for the State Bank of Pakistan. The mural titled “The Treasures of Time” depicts evolution of mankind and traces the history of great scholars, philosophers, scientists, mathematicians, poets, and writers. It is said that the mural became a turning point in the intellectual development of Sadequain. Hameed Haroon noted that from this onwards, his intellectual force entered the world of Ovid, the romance of Alexander and the Amroha-spun tales of ancient Greece and Rome, leading to a unique fusion in Pakistan's art history.

===Lost paintings===

In his lifetime two art galleries were established by the official authorities, one in Islamabad called Gallery Sadequain, which was located in Block F and the second one in the [[Frere Hall]] [[Karachi]], also called Gallery Sadequain. After he died, the [[Islamabad]] gallery was disassembled and some two hundred paintings were unaccounted for and the Frere Hall gallery is closed for all practical purposes because of the security reasons. Forty calligraphic panels on marble slabs measuring {{convert|6|ft|m|abbr=on}} x 5&amp;nbsp;ft each have disappeared.

At the time of his death at OMI Clinic in Karachi, his attendant was present when Sadequain took his last breath at 2:00&amp;nbsp;am. The attendant did not inform the doctors of Sadequain's death and instead took off for Frere Hall where Sadequain had been working on the ceiling. The attendant loaded as many paintings as he could in a Suzuki van, took them to a safe house and then returned to the hospital to inform the doctors. The stolen paintings are resurfacing for sale at regular frequency.

PIA owned Mid Way House hotel had a big Sadequain's painting at entrance and lot of other artwork by renowned Pakistani artists. After the sale of the hotel, all that art treasure is not on display or submitted to any art gallery.

== Death ==
Sadeqain died on 10 February 1987 at [[Karachi]], Pakistan at the age of 63. He is buried in [[Sakhi Hassan]] graveyard in Karachi.&lt;ref name=TNI2/&gt;

[[File:Tennessee Ernie Ford 1957.JPG|thumb|[[Tennessee Ernie Ford]]'s version of "Sixteen Tons" was a number-one hit in the United States.]]

"'''Sixteen Tons'''" is a song written by [[Merle Travis]] about a [[coal mining|coal miner]], based on life in coal mines in [[Muhlenberg County, Kentucky]].&lt;ref name="ernieford.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ernieford.com/SIXTEENTONS.html |title=Sixteen Tons |website=Ernieford.com |date=1956-07-29 |accessdate=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Merle Travis|Travis]] first recorded the song at the Radio Recorders Studio B in Hollywood, California on August 8, 1946. Cliffie Stone played bass on the recording.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrydiscography.blogspot.com/2010/03/merle-travis.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150519095032/http://countrydiscography.blogspot.com/2010/03/merle-travis.html |archivedate=May 19, 2015 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first released in July 1947 by [[Capitol Records|Capitol]] on Travis' album ''[[Folk Songs of the Hills]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Billboard |date=June 28, 1947|title= Advance Record Releases| page= 119}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The song became a [[Music recording sales certification|gold record]].

The line "You load sixteen tons and what do you get? Another day older and deeper in debt" came from a letter written by Travis' brother John.&lt;ref name="ernieford.com"/&gt; Another line came from their father, a coal miner, who would say: "I can't afford to die. I owe my soul to the [[company store]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=LIFE |date=December 5, 1955 |title=You Load 16 Tons... Coal Mine Song Is a Gold Mine| page= 183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1955 version recorded by [[Tennessee Ernie Ford]] reached number one in the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts,&lt;ref name=pc9/&gt; while another version by [[Frankie Laine]] 1956 was released only in Western Europe, where it gave Ford's version competition.

On March 25, 2015, Ford's version of the song was inducted into the [[National Recording Registry|Library of Congress's National Recording Registry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2015/15-041.html | title=National Recording Registry To "Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate the Positive" | work=the Library of Congress | date=25 March 2015 | accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authorship==
The sole authorship of "Sixteen Tons" is attributed to [[Merle Travis]] on all recordings&lt;ref name=pc9/&gt; beginning with Travis' own 1946 record and is registered with [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] as a Merle Travis composition. [[George S. Davis]], a [[folk singer]] and songwriter who had been a Kentucky coal miner, claimed on a 1966 recording for [[Folkways Records]] to have written the song as "Nine-to-ten tons" in the 1930s;&lt;ref&gt;John Cohen, liner notes to the album ''George Davis: When Kentucky Had No Mining Men'' (Folkways FA 2343, 1967)&lt;/ref&gt; he also at different times claimed to have written the song as "Twenty-One Tons".  There is no supporting evidence for Davis' claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.steynonline.com/4434/sixteen-tons|title=SIXTEEN TONS|first=Mark|last=Steyn|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Davis' 1966 recording of his version of the song (with some slightly different lyrics and tune, but titled "Sixteen Tons") appears on the albums ''George Davis: When Kentucky Had No Union Men''&lt;ref&gt;Folkways FA 2343, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Classic Mountain Songs from Smithsonian''.&lt;ref&gt;Folkways Recordings ASIN B000S9DIHK, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Travis, the line "another day older and deeper in debt" from the chorus was a phrase often used by his father, a coal miner himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.countrymusichalloffame.org/full-list-of-inductees/view/merle-travis |title=Full List of Inductees |publisher=Country Music Hall of Fame |date= |accessdate=2014-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106031653/http://countrymusichalloffame.org/full-list-of-inductees/view/merle-travis |archivedate=November 6, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This and the line "I owe my soul to the [[company store]]" are a reference to the [[truck system]] and to [[debt bondage]]. Under this [[scrip]] system, workers were not paid cash; rather they were paid with non-transferable credit vouchers that could be exchanged only for goods sold at the company store. This made it impossible for workers to store up cash savings. Workers also usually lived in company-owned dormitories or houses, the rent for which was automatically deducted from their pay. In the United States the truck system and associated debt bondage persisted until the strikes of the newly formed [[United Mine Workers]] and affiliated [[labour union|unions]] forced an end to such practices.

==Other versions==
[[Tennessee Ernie Ford]] recorded "Sixteen Tons" in 1955 as the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] of his cover of the [[Moon Mullican]] standard "[[You Don't Have to Be a Baby to Cry]]". With Ford's snapping fingers and a unique clarinet-driven pop arrangement, it quickly became a million seller.&lt;ref name=pc9&gt;{{Pop Chronicles|9|2|Merle Travis &amp; Ernie Ford}}&lt;/ref&gt; It hit [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']]'s [[country music]] chart in November and held the No. 1 position for ten weeks, then crossed over and held the number 1 position on the pop music chart for eight weeks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Ace | last= Collins| year= 1996| title= The Stories Behind Country Music's All-time Greatest: 100 Songs| publisher= The Berkeley Publishing Group| location=New York| pages= 91–93| isbn=1-57297-072-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; besting the competing version by [[Johnny Desmond]]. In the [[United Kingdom]], Ford's version competed with versions by [[Edmund Hockridge]] and [[Frankie Laine]]. Nevertheless, Ford's version was the more successful, spending four weeks at number 1 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in January and February 1956.&lt;ref name="500 Number One Hits"&gt;{{cite book

}}'''Stellenbosch University''' ({{lang-af|Universiteit Stellenbosch}}) is a [[public university|public]] [[research university]] situated in [[Stellenbosch]], a town in the [[Western Cape]] province of South Africa. Stellenbosch is jointly the oldest university in South Africa and the [[List of oldest universities in continuous operation|oldest extant university in Sub-Saharan Africa]] alongside the [[University of Cape Town]] which received full university status on the same day in 1918. Stellenbosch University (abbreviated as SU) designed and manufactured Africa's first microsatellite, [[SUNSAT]], launched in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/s/sunsat|title=SUNSAT - eoPortal Directory - Satellite Missions|website=directory.eoportal.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stellenbosch University was the first African university to sign the Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10019.1/4828|title=Signing of the Berlin Declaration by Prof Russel Botman, Rector and Vice-Chancellor of the Stellenbosch University|first=Botman, H.|last=Russel|date=20 October 2010|website=handle.net|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The students of Stellenbosch University are nicknamed "Maties". The term probably arises from the Afrikaans word "tamatie" (meaning tomato, and referring to the maroon sport uniforms and blazer colour). An alternative theory is that the term comes from the Afrikaans colloquialism ''maat'' (meaning "buddy" or "mate") originally used diminutively ("maatjie") by the students of the [[University of Cape Town]]'s precursor, the [[South African College]].

Stellenbosch University is the second-highest ranked African University according to the 2017-2018 [[QS World University Rankings]]. 

== History ==
The origin of the university can be traced back to the '''Stellenbosch Gymnasium''', which was founded in 1864 and opened on 1 March 1866. The first five students matriculated in 1870, but capacity did not initially exist for any tertiary education. However, in the 1870s the Cape Colony's first locally elected government took office and prioritised education. In 1873, four of the five 1870 matriculants became the institution's first graduates by attaining the "Second Class Certificate" through distance learning, and the gymnasium's student numbers rose to over a hundred.

In 1874, a series of government acts provided for colleges and universities, with generous subsidies and staff. A personal intervention by the Prime Minister in the same year ensured that Stellenbosch qualified, after initially being allocated to be purely a secondary school. Later in 1874, the institution acquired its first Professor and in the coming few years its capacity and staff grew rapidly. Its first academic senate was constituted at the beginning of 1876, when several new premises were also acquired. The first MA degree (in Stellenbosch and in South Africa) was completed in 1878, and also in that year, the Gymnasium's first four female students were enrolled.&lt;ref name="Smuts"&gt;{{cite book | title=Stellenbosch.

== Location ==
[[File:UniStellenbosch.jpg|thumb|left|upright|View over the "Red Square" of Stellenbosch University with the peak,"The Twins" beyond]]
[[Stellenbosch]] is located about 50 kilometres from Cape Town and is situated on the banks of the ''Eersterivier'' ("First River") in the famous wine-growing region and is encircled by picturesque mountains. Teaching at Stellenbosch University is divided between the main campus in Stellenbosch, the Tygerberg campus (where the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences is situated), the [[Bellville, Western Cape|Bellville Park]] campus (where the [[University of Stellenbosch Business School]] (USB) is situated), and the [[Saldanha Bay|Saldanha]] campus (housing the Faculty of Military Science at the Military Academy of the South African National Defence Force).

== Language ==
Stellenbosch University used to be a predominantly [[Afrikaans]]-medium university. However, as the student body became more diversified, pressure mounted for more classes in English. 

Today, the university's Language Policy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sun.ac.za/language|title=Language at Stellenbosch University|website=www.sun.ac.za|language=en|access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; promotes multilingualism as a means to increase equitable access for all students and staff. Afrikaans, English and isiXhosa are used in academic, administrative, professional and social contexts, and classes are offered in Afrikaans and English.

Students are allowed to write their assignments, tests and examinations in English or Afrikaans. The language of tuition also varies depending on the faculty. The Faculty of Arts for example, is 40% English, so courses are lectured bilingually and the language of most handouts or prescribed material is determined by the student.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

At postgraduate level the language of tuition is determined by the composition of the class. Most advanced postgraduate courses are conducted in English. According to the 2016 language profile of the university, 40.7% of its students stated Afrikaans as their home language, 46.1% stated English, 0.9% stated English and Afrikaans, and 3.1% of students stated [[Xhosa language|isiXhosa]] as their home language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sun.ac.za/english/_layouts/15/WopiFrame.aspx?sourcedoc=/english/Documents/Statistics/2016/Statistiese%20Profiel%202016%20-%20Tabel%206.xlsx&amp;action=default|title=Statistiese Profiel 2016 - Tabel 6.xlsx|website=www.sun.ac.za|access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The language policy is still an ongoing issue for the University, since it is one of the very few tertiary institutions left in South Africa still offering tuition in Afrikaans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lejournalinternational.fr/Afrique-du-Sud-Stellenbosch-bastion-de-l-ombre-de-l-apartheid_a1180.html  |title=Afrique du Sud : Stellenbosch, bastion de l’ombre de l’apartheid |date=2013-08-20 |accessdate=2015-12-20 |language=French |author=Arthur Cerf |newspaper=Le Journal International}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is situated in the Western Cape province, where 67% of the population have Afrikaans as home language, and the only one of four universities in the province to offer degree courses in Afrikaans. Due to this, it is held in high regard by the Afrikaner community.

The University annually hosts the SU ''Woordfees'', a predominantly Afrikaans-language festival of the written and spoken word.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sun.ac.za/english/Lists/news/DispForm.aspx?ID=4497|title=News - SU Woordfees launches its 2017 programme...|website=www.sun.ac.za|language=en|access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Student housing==
[[File:Dagbreek lug.jpg|thumb|An aerial view of the Dagbreek student residence hall at Stellenbosch University.]]
Stellenbosch has 34 [[Dormitory|residence halls]] in configurations for women only, men only and mixed gender. Each residence is supervised by a warden assisted by a House Committee of senior students. The House Committee assists students with security, maintenance, and social programs. Each residence incorporates a laundry room and a common living room. Residences for women have a communal lounge while several men's residences include a pub.

The number of available rooms in university residences is limited, which requires some students to find private boarding. Students in private lodgings can join the Private Students' Organisation (PSO), also known as Private Wards. There are 6 PSO wards, and a student is assigned to one according to the location of their lodgings in Stellenbosch. Students who commute to the university are assigned to one of two mixed-gender wards. As of 2008, four new PSO wards had been commissioned. The oldest residence is Wilgenhof men's residence, established in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www0.sun.ac.za/willows/|title=Wilgenhof Manskoshuis|website=www0.sun.ac.za|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PSO wards are grouped into six clusters with nearby residences to form student communities (a seventh cluster is on the Tygerberg campus)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www0.sun.ac.za/ssg/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=83&amp;Itemid=529&amp;lang=en|title=Clusters|first=Mathew|last=Smorenburg|date=|website=www0.sun.ac.za|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. For each of these clusters, a hub facility is being built, of which two have already been completed, namely amaMaties and Wimbledon. In this way, day students can enjoy the same benefits as residence students, such as mentor support, meals and a well-appointed place to go to between classes.

'''''An Expository Dictionary of New Testament Words''''' was written by [[William Edwy Vine]] and published as a four volume set in 1940.  In common usage, the title is often shortened to '''''Vine's Expository Dictionary''''', or simply '''''Vine's'''''.  It is a cross-reference from key English words in the [[Authorized King James Version]] to the original words in the Greek texts of the New Testament.  In his preface to the book, Vine wrote, "The present volumes are produced especially for the help of those who do not study Greek, though it is hoped that those who are familiar with the original will find them useful."  
It provides a concise meaning of the original Greek word, often providing Bible verse references as examples.  If there are several Greek words that may translate to the same English word, Vine's distinguishes the shadings of meaning and connotation that may be lost in the English translation.  For example, there are a number of Greek words that may be translated by the English word '''''love'''''.

Vine's also provides the definition of a word (as used in the King James Version) more accurately than an English dictionary, because it expands the Greek use of the word. For example, the word, "godliness" in 1 Tim. 2:2 is defined in the Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary as "1: Divine 2: pious, devout -", but in Vines, it is defined as " 'to be devout,' denotes that piety which is characterized by a Godward attitude, does that which is well-pleasing to Him." So we have a fuller meaning of the word by seeing how the word is used in the NT.

Vine's can be used with [[Strong's Concordance]]. Every word is numbered with the equivalent Strong's number so you can use it more efficiently.  

Vine did not write an equivalent work for Old Testament Hebrew words; however, Vine's work is sometimes combined with another author's Hebrew dictionary and marketed under Vine's name as a "complete" expository dictionary. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ultimatebiblereferencelibrary.com/Vines_Expositary_Dictionary.pdf ''Vine's Complete Expository Dictionary of Old and New Testament Words'']&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8824">Women have made significant contributions to [[literature]] from the earliest times. The involvement of women in writing occurred in several early civilizations.

==History==

One of the earliest known female writer was [[Enheduanna]], whom also is the earliest known [[poet]] whose name has been recorded. She was the [[Ordination of women#Sumeria and Akkadia|High Priestess]] of the goddess [[Inanna]] and the moon god [[Nanna (Sumerian deity)|Nanna]] (Sin). She lived in the [[Sumer]]ian city-state of [[Ur]].&lt;ref&gt;''Gods, Demons, and Symbols of Ancient Mesopotamia: An Illustrated Dictionary'' by Jeremy Black and Anthony Green (1992, {{ISBN|0-292-70794-0}}), p. 134 (entry "Nanna-Suen").&lt;/ref&gt;

Enheduanna's contributions to [[Sumerian literature]], definitively ascribed to her, include several personal devotions to Inanna and a collection of hymns known as the "Sumerian Temple Hymns". Further additional texts are ascribed to her.&lt;ref&gt;[[William W. Hallo|Hallo]] and Van Dijk 1968 p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; This makes her the first named author in world history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Roberta Binkley|title=Rhetoric before and beyond the Greeks|year=2004|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=9780791460993|pages=47|chapter=Reading the Ancient Figure of Enheduanna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was the first known woman to hold the title of [[EN (cuneiform)|EN]], a role of great political importance that was often held by royal daughters.&lt;ref&gt;J Renger 1967: "Untersuchungen zum Priestertum in der altbabylonischen Zeit", ''Zeitschrift für Assyriologie und vorderasiatische Archäologie''. Vol. 58. p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; She was appointed to the role by her father, King [[Sargon of Akkad]]. Her mother was probably Queen [[Tashlultum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Women, Crime, and Punishment in Ancient Law and Society: The ancient Near East |author=Elisabeth Meier Tetlow |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ONkJ_Rj1SS8C&amp;pg=PA245&amp;dq=Tashlultum#v=onepage&amp;q=Tashlultum&amp;f=false |publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group]] |isbn=978-0-8264-1628-5 |year=2004 |accessdate=29 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Mesopotamia and the ancient Near East |author=Michael Roaf |authorlink=Michael Roaf |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SapVAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=Tashlultum&amp;dq=Tashlultum|publisher=Stonehenge Press |isbn=978-0-86706-681-4 |year=1992 |accessdate=29 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Enheduanna was appointed to the role of High Priestess in a shrewd political move by Sargon to help secure power in the south of his kingdom, where the City of Ur was located.&lt;ref name="Franke, p. 831"&gt;Franke, p. 831&lt;/ref&gt;

===7th century B.C.===
'''Sappho''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|æ|f|oʊ}}; [[Aeolic Greek]] {{lang|grc|Ψαπφώ}} ''Psapphô''; c. 630 &amp;ndash; c. 570 BC) was an [[archaic Greek]] poet from the island of [[Lesbos]].{{efn|The fragments of Sappho's poetry are conventionally referred to by fragment number, though some also have one or more common names. The most commonly used numbering system is that of E. M. Voigt, which in most cases matches the older Lobel-Page system. Unless otherwise specified, the numeration in this article is from Diane Rayor and André Lardinois' ''Sappho: A New Translation of the Complete Works'', which uses Voigt's numeration with some variations to account for the fragments of Sappho discovered since Voigt's edition was published.}} Sappho is known for her [[Greek lyric|lyric poetry]], written to be sung while accompanied by a lyre.{{sfn|Freeman|2016|p=8}} Most of Sappho's poetry is now lost, and what is extant has survived only in fragmentary form, except for one complete poem: the "[[Ode to Aphrodite]]". As well as lyric poetry, ancient commentators claimed that Sappho wrote elegiac and iambic poetry. Three epigrams attributed to Sappho are extant, but these are actually [[Hellenistic]] imitations of Sappho's style.

===15th century===

[[Christine de Pizan]] was the most know late medieval French writer, rhetorician, and critic, wrote ''[[Book of the City of Ladies]]'' in 1405, a text about an allegorical city in which independent women lived free from the slander of men. In her work she included real women artists, such as [[Anastasia (artist)|Anastasia]], who was considered one of the best Parisian illuminators, although none of her work has survived. Other humanist texts led to increased education for Italian women.

===18th century===

In 1986, the Institute of Work Psychology became a fully independent institute and renamed the Work Research Institute, and the other institutes shortly after became the [[National Institute of Occupational Health]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.afi-wri.no/modules/module_123/proxy.asp?D=2&amp;C=412&amp;I=3108&amp;pId=0&amp;mids=a347a&lt;/ref&gt;

The institute was organized as a [[government agency]] under the Ministry of Labour and Government Administration until 2002, when it became a wholly owned governmental limited company, since 2005 administered by the Ministry of Education and Research. In 2014, it merged with [[Oslo and Akershus University College]], while maintaining its separate identity and autonomy; in 2018 Oslo and Akershus University College became [[Oslo Metropolitan University]]. It is currently part of the Centre for Welfare and Labour Research at Oslo Metropolitan University, together with the sister institutes [[Norwegian Social Research]], the [[Norwegian Institute for Urban and Regional Research]] and the [[National Institute for Consumer Research]].

The current director of WRI is Elisabeth Nørgaard. The institute publishes series of reports, occasional papers and monographs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.afi.no/modules/module_123/proxy.asp?D=2&amp;C=415&amp;I=3119&amp;pId=0&amp;mids=&lt;/ref&gt;

The institute's history is linked to the [[action research]] tradition where partaking in development work is central.
