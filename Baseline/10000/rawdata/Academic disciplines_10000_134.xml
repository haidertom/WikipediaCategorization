'''Actor–network theory''' ('''ANT''') is a theoretical and methodological approach to [[social theory]] where everything in the social and natural worlds exists in constantly shifting networks of relationship.&lt;ref name="doi.org"&gt;Simandan, D., 2017. Competition, contingency, and destabilization in urban assemblages and actor-networks. Urban Geography, pp.1-12. https://doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2017.1382307&lt;/ref&gt; It posits that nothing exists outside those relationships. All the factors involved in a social situation are on the same level, and thus there are no external social forces beyond what and how the network participants interact at present. Thus, objects, ideas, processes, and any other relevant factors are seen as just as important in creating social situations as humans. ANT holds that social forces do not exist in themselves, and therefore cannot be used to explain social phenomena.  Instead, strictly empirical analysis should be undertaken to "describe" rather than "explain" social activity.  Only after this can one introduce the concept of social forces, and only as an abstract theoretical concept, not something which genuinely exists in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Latour, Bruno. Reassembling the social: An introduction to actor-network-theory. Oxford university press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The fundamental aim of ANT is to explore how networks are built or assembled and maintained to achieve a specific objective.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ulir.ul.ie/handle/10344/2579 Carroll, N., Richardson, I., and Whelan, E. (2012). Service science: an actor-network theory approach. International Journal of Actor-Network Theory and Technological Innovation (IJANTTI);4(3), pp. 51-69]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rpx_BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA115&amp;lpg=PA115&amp;dq=carroll+A+Bureaucratic+View+of+Public+Service+Innovation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OrMOvhK-8k&amp;sig=YljSfKMKSn1HchgCBBiJYmRnMMc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwit-ITauIrQAhXDA8AKHbdPBS0Q6AEIKjAD#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Carroll, N. (2014). Actor-Network Theory: A Bureaucratic View of Public Service Innovation, Chapter 7, Technological Advancements and the Impact of Actor-Network Theory, pp. 115-144, Publisher IGI Global, Hershey, PA]&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is best known for its controversial insistence on the capacity of [[non human|nonhumans]] to act or participate in systems or [[Social network|networks]] or both, ANT is also associated with forceful critiques of conventional and critical sociology. Developed by [[science and technology studies]] (STS) scholars [[Michel Callon]] and [[Bruno Latour]], the sociologist [[John Law (sociologist)|John Law]], and others, it can more technically be described as a "material-semiotic" method. This means that it maps relations that are simultaneously material (between things) and [[semiotic]] (between concepts). It assumes that many relations are both material and semiotic.

Broadly speaking, ANT is a [[social constructivism|constructivist]] approach in that it avoids [[essentialist]] explanations of events or innovations (i.e. ANT explains a successful theory by understanding the combinations and interactions of elements that make it successful, rather than saying it is true and the others are false). Likewise, it is not a cohesive theory in itself.&lt;ref name="doi.org"/&gt; Rather, ANT functions as a strategy that assists people in being sensitive to terms and the often unexplored assumptions underlying them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mol|first=A.|date=2010|title=Actor-Network Theory: sensitive terms and enduring tensions|url=http://dare.uva.nl/search?identifier=75bbc661-0a89-475a-9eef-8c8c5a2e9904|journal=Kölner Zeitschrift für Soziologie und Sozialpsychologie. Sonderheft|volume=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is distinguished from many other [[science and technology studies|STS]] and sociological [[Social network|network theories]] for its distinct material-semiotic approach.

==Background and context==
ANT was first developed at the [[Centre de Sociologie de l'Innovation]] (CSI) of the [[École nationale supérieure des mines de Paris]] in the early 1980s by staff ([[Michel Callon]] and [[Bruno Latour]]) and visitors (including [[John Law (sociologist)|John Law]]). The 1984 book co-authored by John Law and fellow-sociologist Peter Lodge (''Science for Social Scientists''; London: Macmillan Press Ltd.) is a good example of early explorations of how the growth and structure of knowledge could be analyzed and interpreted through the interactions of actors and networks.  Initially created in an attempt to understand processes of innovation and knowledge-creation in science and technology, the approach drew on existing work in [[Science and technology studies|STS]], on studies of [[large technical system|large technological systems]], and on a range of French intellectual resources including the semiotics of [[Algirdas Julien Greimas]], the writing of philosopher [[Michel Serres]], and the [[Annales School]] of history.

ANT appears to reflect many of the preoccupations of French [[post-structuralism]], and in particular a concern with non-foundational and multiple material-semiotic relations. At the same time, it was much more firmly embedded in English-language academic traditions than most post-structuralist-influenced approaches. Its grounding in (predominantly English) [[science and technology studies]] was reflected in an intense commitment to the development of theory through qualitative empirical case-studies. Its links with largely US-originated work on large technical systems were reflected in its willingness to analyse large scale technological developments in an even-handed manner to include political, organizational, legal, technical and scientific factors.

Many of the characteristic ANT tools (including the notions of translation, generalized symmetry and the “heterogeneous network”), together with a [[scientometric]] tool for mapping innovations in science and technology (“co-word analysis”) were initially developed during the 1980s, predominantly in and around the CSI. The “state of the art” of ANT in the late 1980s is well-described in Latour’s 1987 text, ''Science in Action''.&lt;ref name=science&gt;Latour, B. (1987). ''[[Science in Action: How to Follow Scientists and Engineers Through Society]].'' Milton Keynes: Open University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

From about 1990 onwards, ANT started to become popular as a tool for analysis in a range of fields beyond STS. It was picked up and developed by authors in parts of organizational analysis, informatics, health studies, geography, sociology, anthropology, feminist studies, technical communication&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Network: Theorizing Knowledge Work in Telecommunications|last=Spinuzzi|first=Clay|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2008|isbn=9780521895040|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Read|first=Sarah|last2=Swarts|first2=Jason|date=2015|title=Visualizing and Tracing: Research Methodologies for the Study of Networked, Sociotechnical Activity, Otherwise Known as Knowledge Work|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/10572252.2015.975961|journal=Technical Communication Quarterly|volume=24|issue=1|pages=14-44|doi=10.1080/10572252.2015.975961|via=Taylor &amp; Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt; and economics.&lt;ref name="Müller, M 2016. pp.217-229"&gt;Müller, M. and Schurr, C., 2016. Assemblage thinking and actor‐network theory: conjunctions, disjunctions, cross‐fertilisations. Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers, 41(3), pp.217-229.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2008}}, ANT is a widespread, if controversial, range of material-semiotic approaches for the analysis of heterogeneous relations. In part because of its popularity, it is interpreted and used in a wide range of alternative and sometimes incompatible ways. There is no orthodoxy in current ANT, and different authors use the approach in substantially different ways. Some authors talk of “after-ANT” to refer to “successor projects” blending together different problem-focuses with those of ANT.&lt;ref&gt;John Law and John Hassard (eds) (1999). ''Actor Network Theory and After'' (Oxford and Keele: Blackwell and the Sociological Review).&lt;/ref&gt;

==A material-semiotic method==
Although it is called a “[[Philosophical theory|theory]]”, ANT does not usually explain “why” or "how" a network takes the form that it does.&lt;ref name=RtS /&gt; Rather, ANT is a way of thoroughly exploring the relational ties within a network (which can be a multitude of different things). As Latour notes,&lt;ref name=technology&gt;Latour, B. (1999). [http://www.bruno-latour.fr/sites/default/files/46-TECHNOLOGY-DURABLE-GBpdf.pdf "Technology Is Society Made Durable"]. In Law, J., ed., ''Sociology of Monsters''.&lt;/ref&gt; "explanation does not follow from description; it is description taken that much further." It is not, in other words, a theory "of" anything, but rather a method, or a "how-to book" as Latour &lt;ref name=RtS /&gt; puts it.

The approach is related to other versions of material-semiotics (notably the work of philosophers [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Michel Foucault]], and feminist scholar [[Donna Haraway]]). It can also be seen as a way of being faithful to the insights of [[ethnomethodology]] and its detailed descriptions of how common activities, habits and procedures sustain themselves.  Similarities between ANT and [[symbolic interactionist]] approaches such as the newer forms of [[grounded theory]] like [[situational analysis]], exist,&lt;ref&gt;Fernback, J., 2007. “Beyond the Diluted Community Concept: A Symbolic Interactionist Perspective on Online Social Relations.” ''New Media &amp; Society'', 9(1), pp.49-69. [[doi:10.1177/1461444807072417]]&lt;/ref&gt; although Latour&lt;ref&gt;Blok, A, &amp; Elgaard Jensen, T. (2011). ''[http://www.excursions-journal.org.uk/index.php/excursions/article/download/100/134 Bruno Latour: Hybrid thoughts in a hybrid world] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524023006/http://www.excursions-journal.org.uk/index.php/excursions/article/download/100/134 |date=May 24, 2015 }}''. Suffolk: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; objects to such a comparison.

Although ANT is mostly associated with studies of science and technology and with the sociology of science, it has been making steady progress in other fields of sociology as well.  ANT is adamantly empirical, and as such yields useful insights and tools for sociological inquiry in general. ANT has been deployed in studies of identity and subjectivity, urban transportation systems, and passion and addiction.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Gomart, Emilie, and Hennion, Antoin (1999) “[https://www.academia.edu/866668/A_Sociology_of_Attachment_Music_Amateurs_Drug_Addicts A Sociology of Attachment: Music Amateurs, Drug Users]”.

==The actor-network==
As the term implies, the actor-network is the central concept in ANT. The term "network" is somewhat problematic in that as Latour &lt;ref name=RtS /&gt;&lt;ref name=technology /&gt;&lt;ref name=on&gt;Latour, B. "[http://www.bruno-latour.fr/sites/default/files/P-67%20ACTOR-NETWORK.pdf On Actor Network Theory: A Few Clarifications]"&lt;/ref&gt; notes, it has a number of unwanted connotations. Firstly, it implies that what is described takes the shape of a network, which is not necessarily the case. Secondly, it implies "transportation without deformation," which, in ANT, is not possible since any actor-network involves a vast number of [[#Translation|translations]]. Latour,&lt;ref name=on /&gt; however, still contends that network is a fitting term to use, because "it has no a priori order relation; it is not tied to the axiological myth of a top and of a bottom of society; it makes absolutely no assumption whether a specific locus is macro- or micro- and does not modify the tools to study the element 'a' or the element 'b'." This use of the term "network" is very similar to Deleuze and Guattari's [[Rhizome (philosophy)|rhizomes]]; Latour &lt;ref name=technology /&gt; even remarks tongue in cheek that he would have no objection to renaming ANT "actant-rhizome ontology" if it only had sounded better, which hints at Latour's uneasiness with the word "theory".

Actor–network theory tries to explain how material–semiotic networks come together to act as a whole; the clusters of actors involved in creating meaning are both material and semiotic. As a part of this it may look at explicit strategies for relating different elements together into a network so that they form an apparently coherent whole. These networks are potentially transient, existing in a constant making and re-making.&lt;ref name=RtS&gt;Latour, B., 2005. ''[[Bruno Latour#Reassembling the Social|Reassembling the Social: An Introduction to Actor-Network-Theory]]''. Oxford: Oxford UP.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that relations need to be repeatedly “performed” or the network will dissolve. They also assume that networks of relations are not intrinsically coherent, and may indeed contain conflicts. Social relations, in other words, are only ever in process, and must be [[Performativity|performed]] continuously.

Actants denote human and non-human actors, and in a network take the shape that they do by virtue of their relations with one another. It assumes that nothing lies outside the network of relations, and as noted above, suggests that there is no difference in the ability of technology, humans, animals, or other non-humans to act (and that there are only enacted alliances). As soon as an actor engages with an actor-network it too is caught up in the web of relations, and becomes part of the [[entelechy]].

If taken to its logical conclusion, then, nearly any actor can be considered merely a sum of other, smaller actors. A car is an example of a complex system. It contains many electronic and [[machine|mechanical]] components, all of which are essentially hidden from view to the driver, who simply deals with the car as a single object. This effect is known as ''punctualisation'', and is similar to the idea of [[Encapsulation (object-oriented programming)|encapsulation]] in [[object-oriented programming]].

When an actor network breaks down, the punctualisation effect tends to cease as well. In the automobile example above, a non-working engine would cause the driver to become aware of the car as a collection of parts rather than just a vehicle capable of transporting them from place to place. This can also occur when elements of a network act contrarily to the network as a whole. In his book ''Pandora’s Hope'', Latour likens depunctualization to the opening of a black box. When closed, the box is perceived simply as a box, although when it is opened all elements inside it becomes visible.

==Human and non-human actors==
ANT is often associated with the equal treatment of human and non-human actors. ANT assumes that all entities in a network can and should be described in the same terms. This is called the principle of ''[[generalized symmetry]]''. The rationale for this is that differences between them are generated in the network of relations, and should not be presupposed.&lt;ref name="Müller, M 2016. pp.217-229"/&gt;

===Intermediaries and mediators===
The distinction between intermediaries and mediators is key to ANT sociology. Intermediaries are entities which make no difference (to some interesting state of affairs which we are studying) and so can be ignored. They transport the force of some other entity more or less without transformation and so are fairly uninteresting. Mediators, on the other hand, are entities which multiply difference and so should be the object of study. Their outputs cannot be predicted by their inputs. From an ANT point of view, sociology has tended to treat too much of the world as intermediaries.

For instance, a sociologist might take silk and nylon as intermediaries, holding that the former “means”, “reflects”, or “symbolises” the upper classes and the latter the lower classes. In such a view, the real-world silk–nylon difference is irrelevant — presumably, many other material differences could also, and do also, transport this class distinction. But taken as mediators, these fabrics would have to be engaged with by the analyst in their specificity: the internal real-world complexities of silk and nylon suddenly appear relevant, and are seen as actively constructing the ideological class distinction which they once merely reflected.

For the committed ANT analyst, social things like class distinctions in taste, as in the silk and nylon example, are examples of social construction, but also groups and power must constantly be constructed or performed anew through complex engagements with complex mediators. There is no stand-alone social repertoire lying in the background to be reflected off, expressed through, or substantiated in, interactions (as in an intermediary conception). That being said, it doesn't make sense to say there are social aspects of things. Things themselves are a constitutive part of the social reality they are able to enact.&lt;ref name=RtS /&gt;

==Other central concepts==

===Translation===
{{main|Translation (sociology)}}
Central to ANT is the concept of translation which is sometimes referred to as '''sociology of translation''', in which innovators attempt to create a ''forum,'' a central network in which all the actors agree that the network is worth building and defending. In his widely debated 1986 study of how marine biologists try to restock the St Brieuc Bay in order to produce more scallops,&lt;ref&gt;Michel Callon (1986). “[http://www.vub.ac.be/SOCO/tesa/RENCOM/Callon%20%281986%29%20Some%20elements%20of%20a%20sociology%20of%20translation.pdf Some Elements of a Sociology of Translation: Domestication of the Scallops and the Fishermen of St Brieuc Bay]”. In John Law (ed.), ''Power, Action and Belief: A New Sociology of Knowledge'' (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michel Callon]] has defined 4 moments of translation: [[problematization]], [[interessement]], enrollment and mobilisation of allies.  Also important to the notion is the role of network objects in helping to smooth out the translation process by creating equivalencies between what would otherwise be very challenging people, organizations or conditions to mesh together.  Bruno Latour spoke about this particular task of objects in his work ''Reassembling the Social'' (2005).

=== Tokens, or quasi-objects ===
In the above examples, “social order” and “functioning car” come into being through the successful interactions of their respective actor-networks, and actor-network theory refers to these creations as ''tokens'' or ''quasi-objects'' which are passed between actors within the network.

As the token is increasingly transmitted or passed through the network, it becomes increasingly punctualized and also increasingly [[Reification (Marxism)|reified]]. When the token is decreasingly transmitted, or when an actor fails to transmit the token (e.g., the oil pump breaks), punctualization and reification are decreased as well.

== Actor network theory and specific disciplines ==
Recently, there has been a movement to introduce Actor Network Theory as an analytical tool to a range of applied disciplines outside of sociology, including nursing, public health, business (Klein and Czarniawska, 2005), library and information science (Beagle, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Cite journal|url = |title = The Sociotechnical Networks of Scholarly Communication.|last = Beagle|first = Donald|date = 2001|journal = Portal: Libraries and the Academy |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=421–443|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;); urban studies (Farias and Bender, 2010), and community, urban, and regional planning (Beauregard, 2012;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Planning with Things|last = Beauregard|first = Robert|date = 2012|journal = Journal of Planning Education and Research |volume=32 |pages=182–190|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beauregard and Lieto, 2015; Rydin, 2012;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Using Actor-Network Theory to understand planning practice: Exploring relationships between actants in regulating low-carbon commercial development|last = Rydin|first = Yvonne|date = 2012|journal = Planning Theory |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=23–45|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rydin and Tate, 2016, Tate, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Growth management implementation in Metro Vancouver: Lessons  from actor network theory.|last = Tate|first = Laura|date = 2013|journal = Environment and Planning B |volume=40 |issue= |pages=783–800|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== ANT and international relations ===
Actor-Network Theory has become increasingly prominent within the discipline of [[International Relations]] and [[Political Science]].

Theoretically, scholars within IR have employed ANT in order to disrupt traditional world political binaries (civilised/barbarian, democratic/autocratic, etc.),&lt;ref name="ejt.sagepub.com"&gt;Austin, Jonathan Luke., 2015. [http://ejt.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/11/26/1354066115616466.abstract "We have never been civilized: Torture and the Materiality of World Political Binaries."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151204051611/http://ejt.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/11/26/1354066115616466.abstract |date=2015-12-04 }} ''European Journal of International Relations'', [[doi:10.1177/1354066115616466]]&lt;/ref&gt; consider the implications of a posthuman understanding of IR,&lt;ref&gt;Cudworth, E. and Hobden, S, 2013. “Of parts and wholes: International Relations beyond the human.” ''Millennium: Journal of International Studies', 41(3), pp.430-450.&lt;/ref&gt; explore the infrastructures of world politics,&lt;ref&gt;Barry, A., 2013. “Material Politics.”&lt;/ref&gt; and consider the effects of technological agency.&lt;ref&gt;Leander, A., 2013. “Technological agency in the co-constitution of legal expertise and the US drone program.” ''Leiden Journal of International Law', 26(4), pp.811-831.&lt;/ref&gt;

Empirically, IR scholars have drawn on insights from ANT in order to study phenomena including political violences like the use of torture and drones,&lt;ref name="ejt.sagepub.com"/&gt; piracy and maritime governance,&lt;ref&gt;Bueger C., 2013. “Practice, pirates, and coast guards.” ''Third World Quarterly', 34(10), pp.1811-1827.&lt;/ref&gt; and garbage.&lt;ref&gt;Acuto, M., 2014. “Everyday International Relations.” ''International Political Sociology', 8(4).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ANT and design ===
The Actor-Network Theory can also be applied to design, using a perspective that is not simply limited to an analysis of an object's structure. From the ANT viewpoint, design is seen as a series of features that account for a social, psychological, and economical world. ANT argues that objects are designed to shape human action and mold or influence decisions. In this way, the objects' design serves to mediate human relationships and can even impact our morality, ethics, and politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yaneva|first=Albena|title=Making the Social Hold: Towards an Actor-Network Theory of Design|journal=Design and Culture|publication-date=2009|volume=1|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Actor–network theory insists on the capacity of [[non human|nonhumans]] to be actors or participants in networks and systems. Critics including figures such as [[Langdon Winner]] maintain that such properties as ''[[intentionality]]'' fundamentally distinguish humans from animals or from “things” (see [[Activity Theory]]).&lt;ref&gt;Winner, L. (1993). [http://www.nyu.edu/projects/nissenbaum/papers/openingblackbox.pdf "Upon Opening the Black Box and Finding It Empty : Social Constructivism and the Philosophy of Technology Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values"] (Vol. 18, pp. 362-378).&lt;/ref&gt; ANT scholars {{Who|date=December 2012}} respond with the following arguments:
* They do not attribute intentionality and similar properties to [[non human|nonhumans]].
* Their conception of [[human agency|agency]] does not presuppose intentionality.
* They locate agency neither in human “subjects” nor in non-human “objects”, but in heterogeneous associations of humans and nonhumans.

ANT has been criticized as amoral. [[Wiebe Bijker]] has responded to this criticism by stating that the amorality of ANT is not a necessity. Moral and political positions are possible, but one must first describe the network before taking up such positions. This position has been further explored by Stuart Shapiro who contrasts ANT with the history of ecology, and argues that research decisions are moral rather than methodological, but this moral dimension has been sidelined.&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, S. (1997). Caught in a web: The implications of ecology for radical symmetry in STS. Social Epistemology, 11(1), 97-110. [[doi:10.1080/02691729708578832]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Whittle and Spicer note that "ANT has also sought to move beyond deterministic models that trace organizational phenomena back to powerful individuals, social structures, hegemonic discourses or technological effects. Rather, ANT prefers to seek out complex patterns of causality rooted in connections between actors." They argue that ANT's ontological realism makes it "less well equipped for pursuing a critical account of organizations—that is, one which recognises the unfolding nature of reality, considers the limits of knowledge and seeks to challenge structures of domination." &lt;ref&gt;Andrea Whittle and [[André Spicer]], 2008. Is actor network theory critique? ''Organization Studies'' 2008 29: 611&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that ANT does not account for pre-existing structures, such as power, but rather sees these structures as emerging from the actions of actors within the network and their ability to align in pursuit of their interests. Accordingly, ANT can be seen as an attempt to re-introduce [[Whig history]] into [[science and technology studies]]; like the myth of the [[Heroic theory of invention and scientific development|heroic inventor]], ANT can be seen as an attempt to explain successful innovators by saying only that they were successful. Likewise, for organization studies, Whittle and Spicer assert that ANT is, "ill suited to the task of developing political alternatives to the imaginaries of market managerialism."

Key early criticism came from other members of the STS community, in particular the "Epistemological Chicken" debate between Collins and Yearley with responses from Latour and Callon as well as Woolgar.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} Collins and Yearley accused ANTs approach of collapsing into an endless relativist regress.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, H. M., &amp; Yearley, S. (1992). Epistemological Chicken. In A. Pickering (Ed.), Science as Practice and Culture (pp. 301-326). Chicago: The University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;   Some critics&lt;ref&gt;Amsterdamska, O. (1990). 'Surely You're Joking, Mr Latour!'. Science, Technology, Human Values. Vol.15(4) pp.495-504.&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that research based on ANT perspectives remains entirely descriptive and fails to provide explanations for social processes. ANT—like comparable social scientific methods—requires judgement calls from the researcher as to which actors are important within a network and which are not. Critics{{Who|date=July 2013}} argue that the importance of particular actors cannot be determined in the absence of “out-of-network” criteria. Similarly, others{{Who|date=October 2014}} argue that actor-networks risk degenerating into endless chains of association ([[six degrees of separation]]—we are all networked to one another). Other research perspectives such as [[social constructionism]], [[social shaping of technology]], [[social network theory]], [[normalization process theory]], [[Diffusion of Innovations]] theory are held to be important alternatives to ANT approaches.

In a workshop called “On Recalling ANT”, [[Bruno Latour]] stated that there are four things wrong with actor-network theory: “actor”, “network”, “theory” and the hyphen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/sociology/research/publications/papers/latour-recalling-ant.pdf Keynote Speech: On Recalling ANT] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714210351/http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/sociology/research/publications/papers/latour-recalling-ant.pdf |date=July 14, 2014 }}, Lancester University, Department of Sociology&lt;/ref&gt; In a later book however (''[[Bruno Latour#Reassembling the Social|Reassembling the Social: An Introduction to Actor–Network–Theory]]''), Latour reversed himself, accepting the wide use of the term, “''including'' the hyphen” (Latour 2005:9).{{Full citation needed|date=May 2014}} He also remarked how he had been helpfully reminded that the ANT acronym “was perfectly fit for a blind, myopic, workaholic, trail-sniffing, and collective traveler” (the ant, Latour 2005:9) — qualitative hallmarks of actor-network [[epistemology]].

The Balbino de Freitas Archaeological Collection was one of the collections on display in [[National Museum of Brazil]], in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. It reunited works belonging to the house of [[Balbino Luiz de Freitas]], one of the first archaeological collections of Brazil. The collection was [[Cultural heritage management|listed]] by the [[National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage|IPHAN]] in [[1938]].

The collection was assembled by Freitas, especially with indigenous objects of [[Torres, Rio Grande do Sul|Torres]]. A [[basket]] was one of the main elements of the collection, collected in a [[sambaqui]] in the coastal area. The importance of the piece is given by the difficult maintenance of objects made with organic material in tropical countries, such as [[Brazil]].

This archaeological collection was, at least in part, destroyed in the fire of 2018 in the National Museum [[National Museum of Brazil fire|the fire of 2018 in the National Museum]].

In biology, a '''blastomere''' is a type of [[Cell (biology)|cell]] produced by [[cleavage (embryo)|cleavage]] (cell division) of the [[zygote]] after [[fertilization]] and is an essential part of [[blastula]] formation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/69084/blastomere Blastomere  Encyclopædia Britannica]. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2012. Web. 06 Feb. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human blastomere==

In humans, '''blastomere''' formation begins immediately following fertilization and continues through the first week of [[embryonic development]].  About 90 minutes after fertilization, the [[zygote]] divides into two cells.  These [[mitosis|mitotic division]]s continue and result in a grouping of cells called blastomeres. During this process, the total size of the [[embryo]] does not increase, so each division results in smaller and smaller cells.  When the zygote contains 16 to 32 blastomeres it is referred to as a "[[morula]]."

===Clinical disorders===

It is possible for errors to occur during this process of repetitive cell division.  Common among these errors is for the [[DNA|genetic material]] to not be divided evenly.  Normally, when a cell divides each daughter cell has the same genetic material as the parent cell.  If the genetic material does not split evenly between the two daughter cells, an event called "[[nondisjunction]]" occurs.  Since this event occurs in only one of the several cells that exist at this point, the embryo will continue to develop but will have some normal cells and some abnormal cells.  The people are "mosaics" of normal and abnormal cells, so this disorder is called "[[Mosaic (genetics)|numerical mosaicism]]".

Further analysis and comparison with observations by Risa Wechsler’s group at [[Stanford University|Stanford]] and others are reflected in the papers based on the Bolshoi simulations.&lt;ref name=BolshoiPublications&gt;{{cite web|last=High-Performance AstroComputing Center|first=University of California|title=Publications|url=http://hipacc.ucsc.edu/Bolshoi/Papers.html|work=Bolshoi Cosmic Simulation|publisher=UC-HiPACC|accessdate=3 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rationale ==

A successful large-scale simulation of the evolution of [[galaxies]], with results consistent with what is actually seen by astronomers in the night sky, provides evidence that the theoretical underpinnings of the models employed, i.e., the supercomputer implementations ΛCDM, are sound bases for understanding galactic dynamics and the history of the universe, and opens avenues to further research. The Bolshoi Simulation isn't the first large-scale simulation of the universe, but it’s the first to rival the extraordinary precision of modern astrophysical observations.&lt;ref name=IEEESpectrum/&gt;

The previous largest and most successful simulation of galactic evolution was the [[Millennium run|Millennium Simulation Project]], led by Volker Springel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boylan-Kolchin|first=Michael|author2=Volker Springel|author3=Simon D. M. White|author4=Adrian Jenkins|author5=Gerard Lemson|title=Resolving cosmic structure formation with the Millennium-II Simulation|journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]|date=5 Jun 2009|volume=398|issue=3|pages=1150–1164|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2009.15191.x|arxiv=0903.3041|url=http://mnras.oxfordjournals.org/content/398/3/1150|accessdate=11 Jan 2014|bibcode = 2009MNRAS.398.1150B }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the success of that project stimulated more than 400 research papers, the Millennium simulations used early WMAP cosmological parameters that have since become obsolete. As a result, they led to some predictions, for example about the distribution of galaxies, that don’t match very well with observations. The Bolshoi simulations use the latest cosmological parameters, are higher in resolution, and have been analyzed in greater detail.&lt;ref name=BolshoiPublications/&gt;

== Methods ==

The Bolshoi simulation follows the evolving distribution of a statistical ensemble of 8.6 billion particles of [[dark matter]], each of which represents about 200 million [[solar mass]]es, in a cube of 3-dimensional space about 1 billion light years on edge. Dark matter and [[dark energy]] dominate the evolution of the cosmos in this model. The dynamics are modeled with the ΛCDM theory and [[Einstein]]'s [[general theory of relativity]], with the model including [[cold dark matter]] (CDM) and the Λ [[cosmological constant]] term simulating the [[cosmic acceleration]] referred to as dark energy.

The first 100 million years ([[Myr]]) or so of the [[Chronology of the universe|evolution of the universe]] after the [[Big Bang]] can be derived analytically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Loeb |first=Abraham |year=2010 |title=How Did the First Stars and Galaxies Form? |series=Princeton Frontiers in Physics |url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9373.html |location=Princeton, NJ |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |isbn=9781400834068 |accessdate=3 Jan 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bolshoi simulation was started at [[redshift]] z=80, corresponding to about 20 Myr after the Big Bang.  Initial parameters were calculated with linear theory as implemented by the CAMB&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lewis|first1=Antony |last2=Challinor |first2=Anthony |title=Code for Anisotropies in the Microwave Background|url=http://camb.info/|publisher=Antony Lewis|accessdate=3 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  tools,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CAMB Web Interface|url=http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/toolbox/tb_camb_form.cfm|work=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|publisher=Goddard Space Flight Center|accessdate=3 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; part of the WMAP website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|first=Goddard Space Flight Center|title=Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe|url=http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/map/current/|publisher=[[NASA]]|accessdate=3 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The tools provide the initial conditions, including a statistical distribution of positions and velocities of the particles in the ensemble, for the much more demanding Bolshoi simulation of the next approximately 13.8 billion years. The experimental volume thus represents a random region of the universe, so comparisons with observations must be statistical.
[[File:Key Cosmological Parameters σ8 and ΩM from Observations Compared with Simulations.jpg|thumb|350px|right|alt=Key Cosmological Parameters σ8 and ΩM from Observations Compared with Simulations|Two key cosmological parameters, σ8 and ΩM, with values and 1-σ uncertainties from observations and values used in three cosmological simulations. The parameter σ8 represents the amplitude of the fluctuation spectrum on the scale of clusters of galaxies, and the parameter ΩM is the dark + ordinary matter fraction of the cosmic density. The observations represented by the shapes on the figure are from X-ray and gravitational lensing studies of clusters of galaxies. The observations with error bars are from cosmic microwave background data combined with other data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) five-year (2009), seven-year (2011), and nine-year (2013) publications and the Planck (2013) data release. The simulations are the Millennium I, II, and XXL simulations (which all used the same cosmological parameters consistent with the WMAP first-year data release 2003), and the Bolshoi (2011) and Bolshoi-Planck (2014) simulations.]]
The Bolshoi simulation employs a version of an [[adaptive mesh refinement]] (AMR) algorithm called an adaptive refinement tree (ART), in which a cube in space with more than a predefined density of matter is recursively divided into a mesh of smaller cubes. The subdivision continues to a limiting level, chosen to avoid using too much supercomputer time.  Neighboring cubes are not permitted to vary by too many levels, in the case of Bolshoi by more than one level of subdivision, to avoid large discontinuities. The AMR/ART method is well suited to model the increasingly inhomogeneous distribution of matter that evolves as the simulation proceeds. “Once constructed, the mesh, rather than being destroyed at each time step, is promptly adjusted to the evolving particle distribution.”&lt;ref name="ApJS111-73"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cds.cern.ch/record/319000/files/9701195.pdf|format=PDF|title=Adaptive Refinement Tree − A New High-Resolution N-Body Code for Cosmological Simulations |first1=Andrey V.|last1=Kravtsov|first2=Anatoly A.|last2=Klypin|first3=Alexei M.|last3= Khokhlov|publisher=Astrophys.J.Supplement 111, 73, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As the Bolshoi simulation ran, the position and velocity of each of the 8.6 billion particles representing dark matter was recorded in 180 snapshots roughly evenly spaced over the simulated 13.8-billion-year run on the Pleiades supercomputer.&lt;ref name="ApJ740-102"/&gt; Each snapshot was then analyzed to find all the dark matter halos and the properties of each (particle membership, location, density distribution, rotation, shape, etc.).  All this data was then used to determine the entire growth and merging history of every halo.  These results are used in turn to predict where galaxies will form and how they will evolve.  How well these predictions correspond to observations provides a measure of the success of the simulation. Other checks were also made.&lt;ref name="ApJ742-16"/&gt;

== Results ==

The Bolshoi simulation is considered to have produced the best approximation to reality so far obtained for so large a volume of space, about 1 billion light years across. 
“Bolshoi produces a model universe that bears a striking and uncanny resemblance to the real thing. Starting with initial conditions based on the known distribution of matter shortly after the Big Bang, and using Einstein’s general theory of relativity as the ‘rules’ of the simulation, Bolshoi predicts a modern-day universe with galaxies lining up into hundred-million-light-year-long filaments that surround immense voids, forming a cosmic foam-like structure that precisely matches the [[cosmic web]] as revealed by deep galaxy studies such as the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]]. To achieve such a close match, Bolshoi is clearly giving cosmologists a fairly accurate picture of how the universe actually evolved.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/skytel/beyondthepage/Interview-with-Joel-Primack-152323655.html|title=Introduction to Interview with Joel Primack|publisher=Sky and Telescope|date=19 Mar 2012|accessdate=1 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9287">The '''British Alpine Hannibal Expedition''' was an [[experimental archeology]] event that took place in 1959. British engineer John Hoyte led an expedition that tried to reenact aspects of [[Hannibal]]'s legendary crossing of the [[Alps]] during the [[Second Punic War]] in 218 BCE. The group successfully took the female Asian elephant ''Jumbo'', provided by a zoo in [[Turin]], from France over the [[Col du Mont Cenis]] into Italy.

== Background ==
[[File:Hannibal route of invasion.gif|thumb|One possible invasion route proposed for Hannibal's army]]

After the Carthaginian defeat in the [[First Punic War]] of 264–241 BCE, [[Hamilcar Barca]] secured an extensive territory in the [[Iberian peninsula]] for [[Carthage]]. At the beginning of the [[Second Punic War]] in 218 BCE, his son [[Hannibal]] took an army of perhaps 50,000 men and 37 [[war elephants]] from [[Hispania]] (modern-day Spain) to Italy, where he led a 15-year campaign against [[Roman Republic|Rome]]. Hannibal avoided the coastal route, and took his army over the Alps. His march has been described by ancient historians [[Polybius]] and [[Livy]]. The exact route, however, has been subject of long but inconclusive scholarly discourse.&lt;ref name=Jia-stanford-2007/&gt; In his 1955  book ''Alps and elephants: Hannibal's march'', [[Gavin de Beer]] lists 12 possible candidates from 30 different books.&lt;ref name=time-1959/&gt;

== The expedition ==

In 1955, ''[[The Times]]'' published a debate about the route Hannibal might have taken over the Alps. This debate came to the attention of  John Hoyte, then an engineering student at [[Cambridge University]].&lt;!-- Note that  Boser-archeology-2007 mistakenly claims Oxford, however, the other sources, including Hoyte himself in the Stanford University Podcast, agree on Cambridge--&gt;&lt;ref name=Kahn-seattletimes-2009/&gt; Hoyte had an interest in both history and [[mountain climbing]], and spent the summer of 1956 with friends hiking the Alps and comparing possible routes to the ancient descriptions. The group came to the conclusion that the [[Col de Clapier]] was the most likely pass, an opinion still supported by some modern historians.&lt;ref name=Jia-stanford-2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kahn-seattletimes-2009/&gt;

A few years later, a friend suggested to test this theory with an actual elephant. Hoyte wrote letters to the British consuls in [[Lyon]], France, [[Geneva]], Switzerland, and Turin, enquiring about the possibility of obtaining an elephant for the experiment, but without a serious expectation of success. However, the Turin Zoo had just acquired a female Asian elephant, ''Jumbo'', who was trained as a [[circus]] animal. The owner of the zoo volunteered ''Jumbo'' and became the first sponsor of the expedition.  Hoyte put together a team of 8 people, including [[Richard Jolly]] as the expedition secretary and Colonel John Hickman, [[Lecturer]] (later [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]]) in Veterinary Surgery at the University of Cambridge Veterinary School, who had gained experience with elephants during [[World War II]] in [[Burma]].&lt;ref name=Jolly-ids/&gt;&lt;ref name=LB-life-1959/&gt;&lt;ref name=Witten-science20-2009/&gt;&lt;!-- Hickman is only identified by name in the Stanford lecture by Hunt and Hoyte currently in the EL section, but this fact should be uncontroversial --&gt; The group obtained insurance for ''Jumbo'' from [[Lloyd's of London]] and further sponsorship from [[Life (magazine)|''Life'' magazine]], which later published a 7-page photo report.&lt;ref name=LB-life-1959/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hoyte-calling-2010/&gt;
[[Image:Col de Clapier (by Edward Boenig) 01.jpg|thumb|The originally planned route led over the ''Col de Clapier'']]
The expedition started in late July 1959 in [[Montmelian]], France. It followed the valley of the [[Arc (Savoie)|Arc river]] and then ascended towards the Col de Clapier. However, the route up to the pass had become narrowed and dangerous due to [[rockfall]].&lt;ref name=Witten-science20-2009/&gt; The group retracted down into the valley and crossed the [[Col du Mont Cenis]],&lt;ref name=LB-life-1959/&gt;&lt;ref name=Witten-science20-2009/&gt; another pass suggested for Hannibal's route by none less than French emperor [[Napoleon]].&lt;ref name=time-1959/&gt; After 10 days of travel, the expedition successfully "invaded" [[Susa (Italy)|Susa]] in Italy.&lt;ref name=Witten-science20-2009/&gt;

The members of the expedition originally planned to call the 5,700 pound (2.6 t) elephant ''Hannibella'', however, the animal could not be made to respond to the new name and thus remained ''Jumbo''.&lt;ref name=Kahn-seattletimes-2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=Witten-science20-2009/&gt; ''Jumbo'' was 11 years old and equipped with leather boots and knee pads for the most treacherous passages. A specially made coat was provided to keep her warm.&lt;ref name=LB-life-1959/&gt; Despite a diet consisting of {{convert|150|lb|kg}} of hay, {{convert|50|lb|kg}} of apples, {{convert|40|lb|kg}} of bread, {{convert|20|lb|kg}} of carrots, and a vitamin B supplement per day, she lost an estimated {{convert|300|lb|kg}} during the first 4 days of the trip,&lt;ref name=time-1959/&gt; and nearly {{convert|500|lb|kg}} in total. On arrival in Italy, she consumed cake and a [[Wine bottle|Magnum bottle]] of [[Chianti]].&lt;ref name=LB-life-1959/&gt;

In 1960, Hoyte published a report on the expedition as ''Trunk Road for Hannibal: With an Elephant Over the Alps''.&lt;ref name="Hammond-times-2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hoyte-bles-1960/&gt; Expedition member Cynthia Pilkington published the book "Elephant Over the Alps" in 1961, telling the story of the expedition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pilkington|first1=Cynthia|title=Elephant over the Alps|date=1961|publisher=Macmillan|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[botany]], a '''bulb''' is structurally a short [[Plant stem|stem]] with fleshy [[leaf|leaves]] or leaf bases&lt;ref&gt;Bell, A.D. 1997. ''Plant form: an illustrated guide to flowering plant morphology''. Oxford University Press, Oxford, U.K.&lt;/ref&gt; that function as [[food]] [[storage organ]]s during [[dormancy]]. (In [[gardening]], plants with other kinds of storage organ are also called "[[ornamental bulbous plant]]s" or just "bulbs".)

A bulb's leaf bases, also known as scales, generally do not support leaves, but contain food reserves to enable the plant to survive adverse weather conditions. At the center of the bulb is a vegetative growing point or an unexpanded flowering shoot. The base is formed by a reduced [[Plant stem|stem]], and plant growth occurs from this basal plate. [[Root]]s emerge from the underside of the base, and new stems and leaves from the upper side. '''Tunicate''' bulbs have dry, membranous outer scales that protect the continuous lamina of fleshy scales.&lt;ref name="Mishra"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=giqdNdoJNQsC |first=S.R. |last=Mishra |title=Plant Reproduction |publisher=Discovery Publishing House |year=2005 |isbn=978-81-7141-955-5 |pages=120–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Species in the genera ''[[Allium]]'', ''[[Hippeastrum]]'', ''[[Narcissus (plant)|Narcissus]]'', and ''[[Tulip]]a'' all have tunicate bulbs. Non-tunicate bulbs, such as ''[[Lilium]]'' and ''[[Fritillaria]]'' species, lack the protective tunic and have looser scales.&lt;ref name="Ellis"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HeSW3gkjXFMC |first=Barbara W. |last=Ellis |title=Bulbs |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]] |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-618-06890-6 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technical term '''[[geophyte]]''' encompasses plants that form underground storage organs, including bulbs as well as [[tubers]] and [[corms]]. Some [[Epiphyte|epiphytic]] [[orchid]]s (family [[Orchidaceae]]) form above-ground storage organs called '''[[pseudobulb]]s''', that superficially resemble bulbs.

Nearly all plants that form true bulbs are [[monocotyledon]]s, and include:
*''[[Amaryllis]]'', ''[[Crinum]]'', ''[[Hippeastrum]]'', ''[[Narcissus (genus)|Narcissus]]'', and several other members of the amaryllis family [[Amaryllidaceae]]. This includes [[onion]], [[garlic]], and other [[allium]]s, members of the Amaryllid subfamily [[Allioideae]].
*[[Lily]], [[tulip]], and many other members of the lily family [[Liliaceae]].
*Two groups of ''[[Iris (plant)|Iris]]'' species, family [[Iridaceae]]: subgenus ''[[Iris_subg._Xiphium|Xiphium]]'' (the "Dutch" irises) and subgenus ''[[Hermodactyloides]]'' (the miniature "rock garden" irises).
''[[Oxalis]]'', in the family [[Oxalidaceae]], is the only [[dicotyledon]] genus that produces true bulbs.&lt;ref name="Hartmann"&gt;{{cite book |first=Hudson Thomas |last=Hartmann |author2=Dale E.

Bulbous plant species cycle through vegetative and reproductive growth stages; the bulb grows to flowering size during the vegetative stage and the plant flowers during the reproductive stage. Certain environmental conditions are needed to trigger the transition from one stage to the next, such as the shift from a cold winter to spring.&lt;ref name="Mishra"/&gt; Once the flowering period is over, the plant enters a foliage period of about six weeks during which time the plant absorbs nutrients from the soil and energy from the sun for setting flowers for the next year. Bulbs dug up before the foliage period is completed will not bloom the following year but then should flower normally in subsequent years.

After the foliage period is completed, bulbs may be dug up for replanting elsewhere. Any surface moisture should be dried, then the bulbs may be stored up to about 4 months for a fall planting. Storing them much longer than that may cause the bulbs to dry out inside and become nonviable.

== Bulbil ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Lilium]] --&gt;
A '''bulbil''' is a small bulb, and may also be called a '''bulblet''', '''bulbet''', or '''bulbel'''.&lt;ref name=Bell&gt;{{cite book |author=Bell, A.D. |year=1997  |title=Plant form: an illustrated guide to flowering plant morphology |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford, U.K.  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Small bulbs can develop or propagate a large bulb. If one or several moderate-sized bulbs form to replace the original bulb, they are called '''renewal bulbs'''.&lt;ref name=Bell/&gt; '''Increase bulbs''' are small bulbs that develop either on each of the leaves inside a bulb, or else on the end of small underground stems connected to the original bulb.&lt;ref name=Bell/&gt;

Some lilies, such as the tiger lily ''[[Lilium lancifolium]]'', form small bulbs, called bulbils, in their leaf [[axil]]s. Several members of the onion family, Alliaceae, including ''Allium sativum'' ([[garlic]]), form bulbils in their flower heads, sometimes as the flowers fade, or even instead of the flowers (which is a form of [[apomixis]]). The so-called [[tree onion]] (''Allium'' × ''proliferum'') forms small onions which are large enough for [[pickling]].

Some ferns, such as [[Asplenium bulbiferum|the hen-and-chicken fern]], produce new plants at the tips of the fronds' pinnae that are sometimes referred to as bulbils.

'''Carl Troll''' (24 December 1899 in [[Gabersee]] – 21 July 1975 in [[Bonn]]), was a [[Germany|German]] geographer, brother of botanist [[Wilhelm Troll]]. From 1919 until 1922 Troll studied [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[geology]], [[geography]] and [[physics]] at the [[University of Munich|Universität in München]]. In 1921 he obtained his doctorate in [[botany]] and in 1925 his [[habilitation]] in geography. Between 1922 and 1927 he worked as an assistant at the Geography Institute in [[Munich]]. Troll was engaged in research in the ecology and geography of mountainous lands: between 1926 and 1929 went on a research journey throughout [[South America]]n [[Andes|Andean]] countries where he visited [[Chile|northern Chile]], [[Bolivia]], [[Peru]], [[Ecuador]], [[Colombia]], and [[Panama]].  In 1933  and 1934 his research interests took him to East and South Africa; in 1937 Troll was in [[Ethiopia]]; and in 1954 he visited [[Mexico]]. 

In 1930 he became professor of colonial and overseas geography in [[Berlin]], and in 1938 professor of geography in Bonn. Troll, who utilised aerial photographs in his research, coined the term [[Landscape ecology]] in 1939. He developed this terminology and many early concepts of [[landscape ecology]] and of high mountain ecology and geography as part of his early work applying [[Aerial photography|aerial photographs]] interpretation to studies of interactions between environment and vegetation and from his research travels in the mountainous regions of Asia, Africa and South America, as well as his native Europe. He developed [[seasonal climatic charts]] and [[three-dimensional climatic classification]] from hydrological, biological and economical data. 

Carl Troll was president of the [[International Geographical Union]] from 1960 to 1964

==Andean research==
Compared to other scientist of the first half of the 20th century Troll's Andean work stands out by being free of [[developmentalism|developmentalist]] thought and there is "no evidence of triumphalism of Western science in his Andean work".&lt;ref name=Gade1996/&gt; [[altitudinal zonation|Vertical zonation]] is the most acclaimed part of Trolls work in the Andes building upon the work of [[Alexander von Humboldt]].&lt;ref name=Gade1996/&gt;

===The Inca Empire and the environment===
Carl Troll argued that the development of the [[Inca Empire|Inca state]] in the central Andes was aided by conditions that allows for the elaboration of the [[staple food]] [[chuño]]. Chuño which can be stored for long times is made of potato dried at freezing temperatures that are common at nighttime in the southern [[Peru]]vian highlands. Contradicting the link between the Inca state and chuño is that other crops such as maize can also be with dried only sun.&lt;ref name=Gade2016/&gt; Troll did also argue that [[llama]]s, the Inca's pack animal, can be found in its largest numbers in this very same region.&lt;ref name=Gade2016&gt;{{cite book |last=Gade |first=Daniel |date=2016 |title=Spell of the Urubamba: Anthropogeographical Essays on an Andean Valley in Space and Time |url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319208480#aboutBook |chapter=Urubamba Verticality: Reflections on Crops and Diseases |location= |publisher= |page=86 |isbn=978-3-319-20849-7 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is worth considering the maximum extent of the Inca Empire roughly coincided with the greatest distribution of [[alpaca]]s and llamas in Pre-Hispanic America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hardoy |first=Jorge Henríque |date=1973 |title=Pre-Colombian Cities |url=https://books.google.cl/books?id=fbQJBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=llama+inca+expansion+colombia+limi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Rirv1B3ECv&amp;sig=eNEgkUGhfN1RQ2uoR71F2WF52Xw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjFtZvGvZTZAhVJHJAKHeZYA_MQ6AEIdDAP#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location= |publisher= |page=24 |isbn=978-0802703804 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The link between the Andean [[biome]]s of [[Puna grassland|puna]] and [[páramo]], [[pastoralism]] and the Inca state is a matter of research.&lt;ref name=Gade1996/&gt; As a third point Troll pointed out irrigation technology as advantageous to the Inca state-building.&lt;ref name=Gade1996&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gade |first1=Daniel W. |date=1996 |title=Carl Troll on Nature and Culture in the Andes (Carl Troll über die Natur und Kultur in den Anden)  |url= |journal=[[Erdkunde]] |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=301–316 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While Troll theorized environmental influences on the Inca Empire he opposed [[environmental determinism]] arguing that culture lied at the core of the Inca civilization.&lt;ref name=Gade1996/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23751">'''Christian views on environmentalism''' vary among different [[Christian]]s and [[Christianity|Christian]] denominations.

Major Christian denominations endorse the Biblical calling of our stewardship of God's Creation and our responsibility for its care.  Some of this church policy is relatively recent and may not be followed by some parishioners.   According to some [[social science]] research, conservative Christians and members of the [[Christian right]] are typically less concerned about issues of [[environmentalism]] than the general public.&lt;ref&gt;Sherkat, D. E., and C. G. Ellison. 2007. Structuring the religion-environment connection: identifying religious influences on environmental concern and activism. ''[[Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion]]'' 46:71-85.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, M. N., and J. Liu. 2008. Impacts of religion on environmental worldviews: the Teton Valley case. ''Society and Natural Resources'' 21:704-718.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many Christians, however, are environmental activists and promote awareness and action at the church, community, and national levels.

Green Christianity is a broad field that encompasses Christian theological reflection on [[nature]], Christian [[liturgical]] and spiritual practices centered on [[environmental issues]], as well as Christian-based activism in the [[environmental movement]]. Within the activism arena, green Christianity refers to a diverse group of [[Christians]] who emphasize the [[biblical]] or [[theological]] basis for protecting and celebrating the environment. The term indicates not a particular [[Christian denomination|denomination]], but a shared territory of concern.

==Basic beliefs==
Christianity has a long historical tradition of reflection on nature and human responsibility. Christianity has a strong tendency toward [[anthropocentrism]], as emphasized in the early environmentalist critique of [[Lynn Townsend White, Jr.]]. While some Christians favor a more [[biocentrism (ethics)|biocentric]] approach, [[Catholic]] officials and others seek to retain an emphasis on humanity while incorporating environmental concerns within a framework of Creation Care. Christian environmentalists emphasize the ecological responsibilities of all Christians as stewards of God's earth.

Beginning with the [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] [[Genesis creation narrative|1:26-28]], God instructs humanity to manage the creation in particular ways.
{{quote|"And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth." {{bibleref2c-nb|Gen|1:28}} }}

[[Adam]]'s early purpose was to give care to the [[Garden of Eden]]:
{{quote|"And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it." (Genesis 2:15)}}

Green Christians point out that the biblical emphasis is on [[stewardship]], not [[ownership]]—that the earth remains the Lord's ([[Psalms]] 24:1) and does not belong to its human inhabitants. [[Book of Leviticus|Leviticus]] 25:23 states:
{{quote|"The land must not be sold permanently, because the land is mine and you are but aliens and my tenants."&lt;ref&gt;[http://bible.cc/leviticus/25-23.htm Leviticus 25:23]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As a result of the doctrine of stewardship, Christian environmentalists oppose policies and practices that threaten the health or survival of the planet. Of particular concern to such Christians are the current widespread reliance on [[non-renewable resources]], [[habitat destruction]], [[pollution]], and all other factors that contribute to [[climate change]] or otherwise threaten the health of the [[ecosystem]]. Many Christian environmentalists have broken with conservative political leaders as a result of these positions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creationcare.org/resources/scripture.php Evangelical Environmental Network&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://archive.is/20021124084848/http://www.creationcare.org/resources/scripture.php |date=24 November 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anglican - Episcopal Church==
The Anglican Communion and the Episcopal Church have strong beliefs about the need for environmental awareness and actions.  Reducing carbon footprints and moving toward sustainable living are priorities.&lt;ref&gt; {{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orthodox Churches==

===Eastern Orthodox===
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
[[Patriarch Bartholomew I]] of [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Constantinople]], the "first among equals" in the [[Orthodox Church organization|Eastern Orthodox Communion]], has voiced support for aspects of the environmentalist movement, as has [[Pope John Paul II]] of [[Patriarchate of Rome|Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;''Moral Ground: Ethical Action for a Planet in Peril'' chapter author (editors: Kathleen Dean Moore and [[Michael P. Nelson]]) Bartholomew I author with [[Pope John Paul II]], [[Trinity University Press]] (2010) {{ISBN|9781595340665}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fr. [[John Chryssavgis]] serves as advisor to the Ecumenical Patriarch, currently [[Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople|Bartholomew I]], on environmental issues such as [[global warming]]. [[Eastern Orthodox Christian theology|Orthodox Christian theology]] is generally more [[mystical theology|mystical]] and [[panentheism|panentheistic]] than the traditions which developed in the [[Western Christianity|Christian West]], emphasizing the renewal and [[transfiguration (religion)|transfiguration]] of the whole creation through Christ's redemptive work. Many [[Eastern Christian monasticism|Eastern Christian monastics]] are known for having cultivated unusually close relationships with wild animals.

===Non-Chalcedonian, or Oriental Orthodox===

====Armenian Apostolic Church====

In the nineteenth century, [[Catholicos of All Armenians|Catholicos]] [[Nerses V]] of All Armenians planted a forest stretching 100 hectares.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arcworld.org/news.asp?pageID=387|author=ARC: The Alliance of Religions and Conservation|date=16 April 2009|title=Armenian Orthodox start to replant their sacred forest - with a celebration|accessdate=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of it was destroyed during the [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Communist era]] but replanting efforts have begun in the twenty-first century.

The late [[Catholicos of All Armenians|Catholicos]] [[Karekin I]] stated that the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] is committed to the defence of creation because harming the gift of God is a sin when man has a duty to care for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Guaïta |first=Giovanni |date=2000 |title=Between Heaven and Earth: A conversation with His Holiness Karekin I |location=New York, NY, USA |publisher=St. Vartan Press |page=206 |isbn=9780934728393 |others=Translated by Diocese of the Armenian Church of America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[Catholicos of All Armenians|Catholicos]] [[Karekin II]], the Armenian Church produced a seven year ecological action plan &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arcworld.org/downloads/Christian-Armenian-Orthodox-7YP.pdf|title=Plan of the Armenian Apostolic Church for Generational Change|author=ARC: The Alliance of Religions and Conservation|date=2009|accessdate=15 March 2012|page=8)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ethiopian Orthodox 'Tewahedo' Church====

Traditionally, [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Orthodox]] [[monastery|monasteries]] and some churches have preserved small sacred forests around their buildings in memory of the [[Garden of Eden]]. This has allowed many endangered species to survive in areas where their habitat has otherwise been lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Votrin |first=Valery |date=2005 |title=The Orthodoxy and Sustainable Development: A Potential for Broader Involvement of the Orthodox Churches in Ethiopia and Russia |journal=Environment, Development and Sustainability |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=9-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evangelical churches==
{{Main|Evangelical environmentalism}}
As the scientific community has presented evidence of climate change, some members of the [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] community and other Christian groups have emphasized the need for Christian [[ecology]], often employing the phrase "creation care" to indicate the religious basis of their project. Some of these groups are now interdenominational, having begun from an evangelical background and then gained international and interdenominational prominence with the increase in public awareness of environmental issues. Organizations with an evangelical genesis{{Clarify|date=June 2011}} include [[A Rocha]], the [[Evangelical Climate Initiative]] and the Evangelical Environmental Network.

Some prominent members of the so-called [[Christian right]] have broken with the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]] and other [[Conservativism in the United States|conservative]] politicians over the [[Climate change policy of the United States|issue of climate change]]. ''[[Christianity Today]]'' endorsed the [[McCain-Lieberman Bill]], which was eventually defeated by the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States Congress|Congress]] and opposed by [[George W. Bush|Bush]]. According to the magazine, "Christians should make it clear to governments and businesses that we are willing to adapt our lifestyles and support steps towards changes that protect our environment."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2004/october/10.26.html?start=1 "Heat Stroke" (''Christianity Today'', October 2004)]&lt;/ref&gt; The increasing Christian support for strong positions on climate change and related issues has been referred to as "The Greening of Evangelicals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A1491-2005Feb5.html | work=The [[Washington Post]] | first=Blaine | last=Harden | title=The Greening of Evangelicals | date=6 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Christians have expressed dissatisfaction with a leadership they feel places the interests of big businesses over [[Christian doctrine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christian-ecology.org.uk/p0501.htm January 2005 Prayer Guide - Christianity and the Environment - Christian Ecology Link&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many [[Christian right|conservative evangelical Christians]] have embraced [[climate change denialism]] or maintain a neutral stance due to the lack of internal consensus on such issues. The [[Cornwall Alliance]] is an organization which takes an opposing view on the issue to the Evangelical Climate Initiative. The [[National Association of Evangelicals]] has stated that "global warming is not a consensus issue", and is [[Global warming controversy|internally divided]] on the Christian response to climate change.

{{also|Mormonism and Christianity}}
{{Expand section|date=March 2012}}
The [[Latter Day Saint movement]] has a complex relationship with environmental concerns, involving not only the religion but politics and economics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patheos.com/Resources/Additional-Resources/Mormon-Belief-and-the-Environment.html "Mormon Belief and the Environment"], by [[George B. Handley]] in [[Patheos]] September 15, 2009.{{Verify credibility|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(1998) ''New Genesis: A Mormon Reader on Land and Community'' Editors: [[Terry Tempest Williams]], Gibbs M. Smith, William B.

==Lutheran==
Major Lutheran Synods acknowledge that the Bible calls us to care for God's creation.  The dominion that God gave His human creatures has  often been abused, carried out to the detriment of creation:  [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]], [[resource depletion]], [[environmental damage]], etc.   We are called to live according to God’s wisdom in Creation with his other creatures. Sustainable living is needed.&lt;ref&gt; {{Citation

==Roman Catholic Church==
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
Catholic environmental activists have found support in teachings by [[Pope Paul VI]] (''[[Octogesima adveniens]]'', #21) and [[Pope John Paul II]] (e.g., the [[encyclical]] ''[[Centesimus annus]]'', #37-38).

Pope Francis has published an encyclical, named "[[Laudato si']] (Be Praised), On the Care of Our Common Home", which aims to inspire everyone - not just Roman Catholics - to protect the Earth.
He endorses climate action and has made cases on Christian environmentalism on several occasions. 
"Take good care of creation. St. Francis wanted that. People occasionally forgive, but nature never does. If we don’t take care of the environment, there’s no way of getting around it."&lt;ref&gt;Pope Francis meets with President of Ecuador

==Seventh-day Adventists==
{{Expand section|date=June 2012}}
The [[Seventh-day Adventist church]] is committed to environmental stewardship &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adventist.org/beliefs/statements/main_stat9.html A Statement on the Environment], 1995 and [http://www.adventist.org/beliefs/statements/main_stat10.html Statement on Stewardship of the Environment], 1996. See also fundamental beliefs #6, "Creation" and #21, "Stewardship".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, F. E., and W. K. Hayes (2011)  Seventh-day Adventist faith and environmental stewardship. In H. T. Goodwin (ed.), [book title not yet specified]. [[Andrews University Press]], [[Berrien Springs, Michigan]].&lt;/ref&gt; as well as taking action to [[Avoiding dangerous climate change|avoid the dangers]] of [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adventist.org/beliefs/statements/main_stat8.html The Dangers of Climate Change: A Statement to Governments of Industrialized Countries], 1995 (Official statement)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to its official statement, the church "advocates a simple, wholesome lifestyle, where people do not step on the treadmill of unbridled [[over-consumption]], accumulation of goods, and production of waste. A reformation of lifestyle is called for, based on respect for nature, restraint in the use of the world's resources, reevaluation of one's needs, and reaffirmation of the dignity of created life."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adventist.org/beliefs/statements/main-stat10.html Statement on Stewardship of the Environment], 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[Loma Linda University]], one of the church's largest universities, introduced the [[Loma Linda University Center for Biodiversity and Conservation Studies]]. The goal of the center is to address the comparative lack of environmental concern among Christians by increasing awareness of environmental issues. The center features animal displays representing global [[biodiversity hotspots]] of special concern and also introduces visitors to original scientific research being conducted in the school's biology, geology and natural sciences departments.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Southern Baptist==
{{Expand section|date=June 2012}}
The Southern Baptist Environment and Climate Initiative is an independent coalition of [[Southern Baptist]] pastors, leaders, and laypersons who believe in [[Stewardship (theology)|stewardship]] that is both biblically rooted and intellectually informed.&lt;ref&gt;

==United Methodist Church==
The United Methodist Church believes in the need for environmental stewardship.  For Christians, the idea of sustainability flows directly from the biblical call to human beings to be stewards of God's creation.&lt;ref&gt; {{Citation

The segmentation algorithm partitioned the sequence and correctly identified 4 domains as compositionally homogeneous domains and 2 compositionally nonhomogeneous domains.{{Primary source inline|date=May 2012}}]]

A '''compositional domain''' in [[genetics]] is a region of [[DNA]] with a distinct [[guanine]] (G) and [[cytosine]] (C) G-C and C-G content (collectively [[GC content]]).&lt;ref name=pmid20571085&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/nar/gkq532 |title=Identifying compositionally homogeneous and nonhomogeneous domains within the human genome using a novel segmentation algorithm |year=2010 |last1=Elhaik |first1=Eran |last2=Graur |first2=Dan |last3=Josić |first3=Krešimir |last4=Landan |first4=Giddy |journal=Nucleic Acids Research |volume=38 |issue=15 |pages=e158 |pmid=20571085 |pmc=2926622}}&lt;/ref&gt; The homogeneity of compositional domains is compared to that of the chromosome on which they reside. As such, compositional domains can be homogeneous or nonhomogeneous domains. Compositionally homogeneous domains that are sufficiently long (= 300 kb) are termed [[isochore (genetics)|isochores]] or isochoric domains.

The '''compositional domain model''' was proposed as an alternative to the [[isochoric model]]. The isochore model was proposed by Bernardi and colleagues to explain the observed non-uniformity of genomic fragments in the genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.4001930 |title=The mosaic genome of warm-blooded vertebrates |year=1985 |last1=Bernardi |first1=G |last2=Olofsson |first2=B |last3=Filipski |first3=J |last4=Zerial |first4=M |last5=Salinas |first5=J |last6=Cuny |first6=G |last7=Meunier-Rotival |first7=M |last8=Rodier |first8=F |journal=Science |volume=228 |issue=4702 |pages=953–8 |pmid=4001930|bibcode = 1985Sci...228..953B }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, recent sequencing of complete genomic data refuted the isochoric model. Its main predictions were:

* GC content of the third codon position (GC3) of protein coding genes is correlated with the GC content of the isochores embedding the corresponding genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0378-1119(01)00644-8 |title=Misunderstandings about isochores.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4764">The '''critical apparatus''' ({{lang-la|apparatus criticus}}) is the critical and [[primary source]] material that accompanies an edition of a text. A critical apparatus is often a by-product of [[textual criticism]].

Many editions employ a standard format for a critical apparatus, as illustrated by a line from ''[[Hamlet]]'', which the Oxford ''Complete Works'' (1988) prints as follows:&lt;ref&gt;William Shakespeare, ''The Complete Works'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1991), p. 682&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|{{sc|LAERTES}}. Alas, then is she drowned.}}

The apparatus for the line might be rendered as:&lt;ref&gt;Suggested by Stanley Wells and Gary Taylor, ''William Shakespeare: A Textual Companion'' (New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1997), p. 408.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|4.7.156 Alas, then is she drowned.] {{sc|'''HIBBARD'''}}; Alas then, is she drown'd? '''F''';&lt;br&gt;Alas then is she drownd. '''Q3'''; Alas, then, she is drownd. '''Q2''';&lt;br/&gt;So, she is drownde: '''Q1'''.}}

The format of the apparatus has several parts:
* The location of the variant in the text (act, scene, line number)
* The ''lemma'', which is the portion of the text to which the note applies
* A right bracket (])
* The source from which the edition took its reading
* A list of variants, in each case followed by the source in which the variant is found, and set off with a semicolon.

To save space, frequently cited sources are usually assigned an abbreviation called a ''siglum''. In Shakespeare editions, '''F''' always signifies the [[First Folio]]; the second through fourth folios are referred to as '''F2''' through '''F4''' respectively. Similarly, '''Q1''' is the first [[quarto]], '''Q2''' the second quarto, and '''Q3''' the third.

In the example given, the first folio ('''F''') and the three early quartos ('''Q1''' to '''Q3''') each have a different reading of the line in question. The editors have concluded that all four early sources are corrupt, and instead have adopted a reading suggested by [[G. R. Hibbard]]. Other editors of the play may choose a different reading of the line. The apparatus summarizes all of the textual evidence, allowing readers to assess for themselves whether the editor has made the best choice. Sometimes the editor will add a commentary, defending the choice made, explaining why other readings were rejected, or discussing how other editors have treated the passage.

This format has been used for critical apparatuses of [[Shakespeare]] and many other authors. In [[variorum]] editions, the apparatus is often placed at the bottom of the page. Sometimes a three-part format is employed, with the main text at the top of the page, textual variants in the middle, and the editor's commentary at the bottom. This remains the most common format for Shakespeare editions, although the Oxford ''Complete Works'' breaks with tradition by putting its critical apparatus in a separately published volume.

In the United States, bibliographer [[Fredson Bowers]] established a tradition of putting the critical apparatus at the back of the book, leaving the edited text clear of apparatus. This has the advantage of leaving the main text uncluttered with editorial details that may not be of interest to the general reader. However, this format is a disadvantage to scholarly readers, who are not able to see all of the textual evidence in one place.

==Bible==
The first printed edition of the [[New Testament]] with ''critical apparatus'', noting variant readings among the manuscripts, was produced by the printer [[Robert Estienne]] of Paris in 1550. The Greek text of this edition and of those of Erasmus became known as the ''[[Textus Receptus]]'' (Latin for "received text"), a name given to it in the [[House of Elzevir|Elzevier]] edition of 1633, which termed it as the text ''nunc ab omnibus receptum'' ("now received by all").

==Electronic representation==
The de facto standard for the representation of critical apparatus in digital scholarly editions is to follow the recommendations of the [[Text Encoding Initiative]].&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/TC.html&lt;/ref&gt; While other formats are also used in digital literary studies this has become the most accepted storage format.&lt;ref&gt; See also James Cummings, "[http://www.digitalhumanities.org/companion/view?docId=blackwell/9781405148641/9781405148641.xml&amp;chunk.id=ss1-6-6&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=ss1-6-6&amp;brand=9781405148641_brand The Text Encoding Initiative and the Study of Literature]" in 'A Companion to Digital Literary Studies', ed.

A '''defence in depth''' uses multi-layered protections, similar to [[Redundancy (engineering)|redundant]] protections. The intention is to create a reliable system using the multiple layers, rather than making any one layer perfectly reliable.

==Examples==
The term defence in depth is now used in many non-military contexts.

===Fire prevention===
A defence in depth strategy to fire prevention does not focus all the resources only on the prevention of a fire; instead, it also requires the deployment of fire alarms, extinguishers, evacuation plans, mobile rescue and fire-fighting equipment and even nationwide plans for deploying massive resources to a major blaze.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Defense-in-depth is incorporated into fire protection regulations for nuclear power plants. It requires preventing fires, detecting and extinguishing fires that do occur, and ensuring the capability to safely shutdown.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/cfr/part050/part050-appr.html NRC: 10 CFR Appendix R to Part 50—Fire Protection Program for Nuclear Power Facilities Operating Prior to January 1, 1979&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Engineering===
Defence in depth may mean engineering which emphasizes [[redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]] – a system that keeps working when a component fails – over attempts to design components that will not fail in the first place. For example, an [[aircraft]] with four engines will be less likely to suffer total engine failure than a single-engined aircraft no matter how much effort goes into making the single engine reliable. However, [[Charles Perrow]], author of ''[[Normal accidents]]'', has said that sometimes redundancies backfire and produce less, not more reliability. This may happen in three ways: First, redundant safety devices result in a more complex system, more prone to errors and accidents. Second, redundancy may lead to shirking of responsibility among workers. Third, redundancy may lead to increased production pressures, resulting in a system that operates at higher speeds, but less safely.&lt;ref name=perr2004&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iis-db.stanford.edu/pubs/20276/sagan_oe_dec03.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040714202943/http://iis-db.stanford.edu/pubs/20276/sagan_oe_dec03.pdf |archivedate=2004-07-14 |title=Learning from Normal Accidents |author=Scott D. Sagan |date=March 2004 |work=Organization &amp; Environment |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nuclear engineering====
{{Main article|Defense in depth (nuclear engineering)}}
In [[nuclear engineering]] and [[nuclear safety]], all safety activities, whether organizational, behavioural or equipment related, are subject to layers of overlapping provisions, so that if
a failure should occur it would be compensated for or corrected without causing harm to individuals or the public at large. Defence in depth consists in a hierarchical deployment of different levels of equipment and procedures in order to maintain the effectiveness of physical barriers placed between radioactive materials and workers, the public or the environment, in normal operation, anticipated operational occurrences and, for some barriers, in accidents at the plant. Defence in depth is implemented through design and operation to provide a graded protection against a wide variety of transients, incidents and accidents, including equipment failures and human errors within the plant and events initiated outside the plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub1013e_web.pdf |title=Defence in depth in nuclear safety (INSAG-10) |author=International Nuclear Energy Agency |year=1996 |isbn=92-0-103295-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Information security===
{{main article|Defense in depth (computing)}}
Likewise, in [[information security]] / [[Information Assurance]] defence in depth represents the use of multiple [[computer security]] techniques to help mitigate the risk of one component of the defence being compromised or circumvented. An example could be [[anti-virus software]] installed on individual [[workstations]] when there is already virus protection on the [[Firewall (networking)|firewall]]s and [[Server (computing)|server]]s within the same environment. Different security products from multiple vendors may be deployed to defend different potential [[vector (malware)|vector]]s within the [[computer network|network]], helping prevent a shortfall in any one defence leading to a wider failure; also known as a "layered approach".{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

}}

The '''discourse of power''' is used when it comes to differentiating the levels of [[Power (social and political)|power]] due to cultural and social characteristics that come about through societal upbringing. The ways we think and talk about a subject influence and reflect the ways we act in relation to that subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Karlburg|first1=Michael|title=The Power of Discourse and the Discourse of Power: Pursuing Peace Through Discourse Intervention|url=http://www.gmu.edu/programs/icar/ijps/vol10_1/Karlberg_101IJPS.pdf|website=International Journal of Peace Studies|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The idea of the discourse of power within media has a domino effect and it can play a huge role in determining the patterns of access to the mass media: who has preferential access to journalists, who will be interviewed, who will be quoted and described in news reports, and whose opinions will influence the public? Through access to the mass media, dominant groups also may have access to and partial control over the public at large.&lt;ref name="Discourse Power and Access"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Van Dijk|first1=Teun|title=Discourse Power and Access|url=http://www.discourses.org/OldArticles/Discourse,%20power%20and%20access.pdf|website=discourse.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The role of mass media and power in the United States ==
{{See also|Media of the United States}}

Those with power and influence know that media control or influence is crucial. A free press is crucial for a functioning democracy, but if not truly free, paves the way for manipulation and concentration of views, thus undermining democracy itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shah|first1=Anup|title=Media in the United States|url=http://www.globalissues.org/article/163/media-in-the-united-states|website=Global Issues|accessdate=27 April 2015|date=28 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The First Amendment to the U.S Constitution, which provides that "Congress shall make no law...abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press," has given the media an exceptionally strong basis for resisting government controls in the United States. A limited number of controls, such as regulatory laws, court decisions, and informational social pressures guard against excess by the media. In the United States courts have been loath to impose restraints prior to publication, such as granting injunctions that would stop publication of information on the grounds that it would cause irreparable harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graber|first1=Doris|last2=Dunaway|first2=Johanna|title=Mass media and American politics|date=2015|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=9781452287287|edition=9th}}&lt;!--|accessdate=27 April 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Major mass media conglomerates in the United States===
*[[Walt Disney Company]]
*[[News Corporation]]
*[[Time Warner]]
*[[CBS Corporation]]
*[[Viacom]]
*[[General Electric]]

These media conglomerates control 90% of the traditional media that is present in our daily lives, media has never been more consolidated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lutz|first1=Ashley|title=These 6 Corporations Control 90% of the Media in America|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/these-6-corporations-control-90-of-the-media-in-america-2012-6|website=Business Insider|accessdate=27 April 2015|date=14 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Power of media versus reality==
The shaping of ones reality or perception is based on three elements including experienced reality, symbolic reality, and socially constructed reality. Much of the symbolic reality is based on media practices that we are exposed to daily. Individuals make assumptions on the world based on what their media tells them. The media is a [[hegemony|hegemonic]] form of power that maintains their position, not through force, but through elaboration of a particular world view, an ideology, or a particular notion of common sense, which is widely infused into everyday cultural practices. This results in people consenting to power even when it may not be in their best interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bybee|first1=Carl|title=Mass Media and Society|url=http://journalism.uoregon.edu/~cbybee/j201/overheads/hegemony_def.htm|website=University of Oregon - Journalism Department}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assumption of media hegemony is that the ideas of the ruling class become ruling ideas in society, because of this the mass media are controlled by the dominant class in society which uses it as a vehicle for exerting control over the rest of society.&lt;ref name="Discourse Power and Access"/&gt;

=== Socially constructed reality ===
[[Social constructionism|Social construct]] examines the development of jointly constructed understandings of the world. It assumes that understanding, significance, and meaning are developed not separately within the individual, but in coordination among other human beings. To say something that it is socially constructed is to emphasize its dependence on contingent aspects of an individuals social selves. It can say this thing could not have existed had we not built it. Had someone been brought up in a different kind of society, had different needs, values, or interests, an individual might have built a different kind of thing, or built this social construct differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boghossian|first1=Paul|title=What is Social Construction?|url=http://philosophy.fas.nyu.edu/docs/IO/1153/socialconstruction.pdf|website=New York University}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to be aware that the values we hold, the beliefs we harbor and the decisions we make are based on our assumptions, our experiences, our education and what we know for a fact. Social construct allows us rely on mass media for the current news and facts about what is important and what we should be aware of.  We trust the media as an authority for news, information, education and entertainment. Considering that powerful influence, then, we should know how it really works. The degree of influence depends on the availability and pervasiveness of media.  Traditional mass media still has a great influence within society today. Books once were supremely influential because they came first before newspapers, magazines, radio or television. Newspapers and magazines became large influencers after they were developed. Sound recordings and film were and still are influential. Radio and then television were very influential. As the 20th century closed, TV exposed us to a number of new examples advertising and marketing, suffering and relief, sexuality and violence, celebrity entertainment, and much more. New and influential media-distribution channels have appeared in the 21st century. We are currently being influenced through the internet by daily by blogs, popular culture websites and various social media outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Curtis|first1=A|title=Mass Media Influence on Society|url=http://www2.uncp.edu/home/acurtis/Courses/ResourcesForCourses/Media&amp;Society/MassMediaInfluenceOnSociety.html|website=University of North Carolina Pembroke|accessdate=27 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215065257/http://www.uncp.edu/home/acurtis/Courses/ResourcesForCourses/Media%26Society/MassMediaInfluenceOnSociety.html|archivedate=15 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Experienced reality===
Experienced reality is that reality that comes to us via the senses and also via insight or intuition. It underlies all of our cognitive efforts. Because direct experience is largely sensory, automatic and constant, we pay less attention to it than the reality we have to work at to construct. It is somewhat of an illusion that effort equates to importance in our culture.&lt;ref name="Guide to Reality"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baggott|first1=Jim|title=A beginner's guide to reality : [exploring our everyday adventures in wonderland]|date=2006|publisher=Pegasus books|location=New York|isbn=9781933648040|edition=1st Pegasus Books}}&lt;!--|accessdate=5 May 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Events or experiences spark change in an individual. Through societal influence we are becoming a generation that needs to see to believe, and experienced reality is what initiates this idea. Power through this idea of experienced reality is relayed through the ideologies of the major media conglomerates and the way that they have created such a large cultural bias towards what we have experienced.

===Symbolic reality===
Symbols exist everywhere for an individual. Symbols are the intermediary between the world internal and the world external, between inner and external reality of human being as a person. The appeal to symbolic reality allows us to overcome [[personal boundaries]] including power struggles. Symbolic reality exists in and through person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ekaterina|first1=Dr. Dvoretskaya|title=Personal approach to Symbolic reality|url=http://www.crvp.org/seminar/05-seminar/Ekaterina.htm|website=Council for Research in Values and Philosophy|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symbols are objects, characters, or other representations of ideas, concepts, or abstractions; they are the universal language in a culture. Symbols have been used for thousands of years, they help individuals communicate and interact with one another. Thus, as a representation, their meaning is neither instinctive nor automatic. The culture’s members must interpret, and over time reinterpret, Symbols convey meaning and occur in different forms, such as: verbal or nonverbal, written or unwritten, words on the page, drawings, pictures, gesture. They are things which act as triggers to remind people, in the culture, of its rules, beliefs… Symbols can also be used to indicate status within a culture. Every society has evolved a system of symbols that reflects a specific cultural logic; and every symbolism functions to communicate information between members in much the same way as, but more subtly than, conventional language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Power of Symbols|url=http://bizshifts-trends.com/2012/01/23/power-of-symbols-symbolisms-and-brand-in-developing-global-markets-anthropology-of-business-marketing-leadership/|website=Business Shifts and Trends|accessdate=5 May 2015|date=23 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the level of power, media conglomerates have been using symbolic reality to relay their messages for years.

'''Envenomation''' is the process by which [[venom (poison)|venom]] is injected by the bite or sting of a venomous animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Envenomations: An Overview of Clinical Toxinology for the Primary Care Physician|first1=SCOTT A. |last1=WEINSTEIN |first2=RICHARD C. |last2=DART|display-authors=etal|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2009/1015/p793.html|journal=American Family Physician|date=15 October 2009|volume=80|issue=8|pages=793-802}}&lt;/ref&gt;

J. LITTLE, S. S. PINEDA, P. G. HAINS, G. F. KING et al., 2012 Cloning and activity of a novel α-latrotoxin from red-back spider venom. [[Biochemical Pharmacology (journal)|Biochemical Pharmacology]] 83: 170–183.&lt;/ref&gt; [[insect]]s (e.g., [[wasp]]s), and fish (e.g., [[Synanceia|stone fish]]) employ venom for hunting and for self-defense. 

==Mechanism==

Some venoms are applied externally, especially to sensitive tissues such as the eyes, but most venoms are administered by piercing the skin of the victim. Venom in the saliva of the [[Gila monster]] and some other reptiles enters prey through bites of grooved teeth. More commonly animals have specialized organs such as hollow teeth ([[fangs]]) and tubular [[stinger]]s that penetrate the prey's skin, whereupon muscles attached to the attacker's venom reservoir squirt venom deep within the victim's body tissue. Death may occur as a result of bites or stings. The rate of envenoming is described as the likelihood of venom successfully entering a system upon bite or sting.

==Diagnosis and treatment==
Diagnosing snake envenomation is a crucial step in determining which [[antivenom]] is to be applied. Each year there are around 2 million cases of snake envenomation and up to 100,000 deaths worldwide.&lt;ref name=Kalana /&gt; Various anti-venom treatments exist, typically consisting of [[antibodies]] or antibody fragments, which neutralize the [[venom]]. Certain snakes require certain treatments, such as [[pit vipers]] and [[coral snakes]]. Anti-venom therapy is designed to treat the hemorrhaging and coagulation effects that venom has on humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Envenomations: An Overview of Clinical Toxinology for the Primary Care Physician|first1=SCOTT A. |last1=WEINSTEIN |first2=RICHARD C. |last2=DART|display-authors=etal|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2009/1015/p793.html|journal=American Family Physician|date=15 October 2009|volume=80|issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Fantastic Voyage: Live Long Enough to Live Forever''''' ([[Rodale Books]], {{ISBN|1-57954-954-3}}), published in 2004, is a book authored by [[Raymond Kurzweil|Ray Kurzweil]] and Terry Grossman. The basic premise of the book is that if [[middle age]]d people can live long enough, until approximately 120, they will be able to [[immortality|live forever]]—as humanity overcomes all [[disease]]s and [[old age]] itself. This might also be considered a [[break-even]] scenario where developments made during a year increase [[life expectancy]] by more than one year. Biogerontologist [[Aubrey de Grey]] called this the "[[Longevity escape velocity]]" in a 2005 [[TED talk]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/aubrey_de_grey_says_we_can_avoid_aging.html TED Talks - Aubrey de Grey says we can avoid aging]&lt;/ref&gt;

The book focuses primarily on health topics such as [[heart disease]], [[cancer]], and [[diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]]. It promotes lifestyle changes such as a low [[glycemic index]] [[dieting|diet]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://womenshealth.about.com/od/fitnessandhealth/a/exfantasticvoya.htm Excerpt from ''Fantastic Voyage''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202192822/http://womenshealth.about.com/od/fitnessandhealth/a/exfantasticvoya.htm |date=2010-12-02 }}  ''About.com''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[calorie restriction]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://womenshealth.about.com/od/fitnessandhealth/a/exfantasticvoya_4.htm Excerpt from ''Fantastic Voyage''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203114217/http://womenshealth.about.com/od/fitnessandhealth/a/exfantasticvoya_4.htm |date=2010-12-03 }}  ''About.com''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[exercise]], drinking [[green tea]] and [[water ionizer|alkalinized water]], and other changes to daily living. They also promote aggressive [[dietary supplement|supplementation]]&lt;ref name="fantastic"&gt;[http://www.fantastic-voyage.net/ShortGuidehtml.htm "A Short Guide to a Long Life" (Excerpt from ''Fantastic Voyage'').] ''Fantastic-voyage.net''.&lt;/ref&gt; to make up for nutrient deficiencies they believe are common in [[Western culture|Western society]].  In contrast to his previous book ''[[The 10% Solution for a Healthy Life]]'', in which he recommended a diet with 10% of calories from fat, in this book, Kurzweil recommends consuming less than one third of calories from carbohydrates (and less than one sixth of calories in his low-carbohydrate diet) and consuming 25% of calories from fat.&lt;ref name="fantastic" /&gt;

The book states that the purpose of these changes is to obtain and maintain idyllic health so that an individual can extend his or her life as long as possible. The authors believe that within the next 20 to 50 years technology will advance to the point where much of the [[senescence|aging process]] will be conquered, and [[degenerative diseases]] eliminated. The book is peppered with side notes on these futuristic topics, showing how current research is leading us toward [[life extension]], and explaining how future technologies such as [[nanotechnology]] and [[bioengineering]] might change the way humans live their lives. Ray Kurzweil discusses these topics at further length in his 2005 book ''[[The Singularity Is Near]]''.

A follow-up on ''Fantastic Voyage'', ''Transcend: Nine Steps to Living Well Forever'', was released on April 28, 2009.

==Criticisms==
One claim in the book has been called pseudoscience. Dr. Stephen Lower, retired Professor of Chemistry at Simon Fraser University, disputes some of the book's statements about alkaline water on his [http://www.chem1.com/CQ/ionbunk.html web site]. Kurzweil and Grossman counter this specific criticism directly in their [http://www.fantastic-voyage.net/ReaderQandA.htm#alkaline Reader Q&amp;A].

'''Female sperm storage''' is a biological process and often a type of [[sexual selection]] in which [[spermatozoa|sperm cells]] transferred to a female during mating are temporarily retained within a specific part of the reproductive tract before the [[oocyte]], or egg, is fertilized. The site of storage is variable among different animal taxa and ranges from structures that appear to function solely for sperm retention, such as insect [[spermatheca]]&lt;ref&gt;Klowden MJ. 2003.

==Increased diversity of offspring ==
One important advantage female insects that store sperm gain is increased [[genetic diversity]] in their offspring.  There are many ways that females can alter offspring genetics to increase their success and diversity. An example of how this can be accomplished is in female [[Scathophaga]] that preferentially fertilize eggs to survive in different environments. Since many environments require different traits for success, females are somehow able to match sperm (acquired from multiple mates) that have the best genes for whichever environment in which they will develop.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.0014-3820.2000.tb00712.x |pmid=11108595 |title=Cryptic Female Choice in the Yellow Dung Fly Scathophaga Stercoraria (L.) |journal=Evolution |volume=54 |issue=5 |pages=1680–6 |year=2000 |last1=Ward |first1=Paul I }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the different properties of the environment, including temperature and thermal properties affect the female's sperm choice.&lt;ref name=cats&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1365-294X.2002.01558.x |pmid=12207727 |title=Field experiments on the distributions of eggs of different phosphoglucomutase (PGM) genotypes in the yellow dung fly Scathophaga stercoraria (L.) |journal=Molecular Ecology |volume=11 |issue=9 |pages=1781–5 |year=2002 |last1=Ward |first1=Paul I |last2=Vonwil |first2=Judith |last3=Scholte |first3=Ernst-Jan |last4=Knop |first4=Eva }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have also shown that ovipositing is nonrandom and females lay eggs with varying PGM([[phosphoglucomutase]]) genotypes in different environments in order to optimize offspring success. Females are acutely aware to their environment and manipulate the genetic diversity of their offspring in appropriate ways to ensure their success.

Another way sperm-storing females can alter the diversity of their offspring is controlling the relatedness to the males that provide them with sperm. [[Inbreeding depression]] can have a deleterious impact on populations of organisms and is due to mating of closely related individuals. To combat this effect, female insects appear to be able to sort out the sperm of relatives from the sperm of non-relatives to choose the best option to fertilize their eggs. Female crickets are able to preferentially store sperm of multiple unrelated males to that of their siblings; this results in more of the offspring having unrelated parentage. Being able to choose between sperm after coupling might be advantageous to females because choosing between mates precopulation may be more costly, or it may just be too difficult to tell males apart before mating.&lt;ref name=thunder&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1365-294X.2009.04301.x |pmid=19694961 |title=Promiscuous females avoid inbreeding by controlling sperm storage |journal=Molecular Ecology |volume=18 |issue=16 |pages=3340 |year=2009 |last1=Bretman |first1=Amanda |last2=Newcombe |first2=Devi |last3=Tregenza |first3=TOM }}&lt;/ref&gt; Females possess remarkable abilities to select sperm to store and to fertilize their eggs that will make their offspring diverse. Though it has been shown that a majority of female insect species can store sperm, specific examples that have been studied could include field crickets,&lt;ref name=thunder/&gt; dung flies &lt;ref name=cats/&gt; and Mediterranean fruit flies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1006/anbe.1999.1137 |pmid=10458875 |title=Postcopulatory sexual selection in Mediterranean fruit flies: Advantages for large and protein-fed males |journal=Animal Behaviour |volume=58 |issue=2 |pages=247–254 |year=1999 |last1=Taylor |first1=Phillip W |last2=Yuval |first2=Boaz }}&lt;/ref&gt; Females largely benefit from this mechanism, but males often can experience low fitness because their paternity is not secure.

Sperm stored often determines which male ends up fertilizing the most eggs. An example of this is seen in [[Red flour beetle#Polygamy in Red flour beetles.|Red Flour Beetles]], where most of the sperm is stored in the first mating. Another male can remove previously stored sperm to better chances of successful mating.

==Antagonistic coevolution==
{{Main|Antagonistic coevolution}}
[[File:Callosobruchus analis penis.jpg|thumb|Spiny genitalia, such as of this [[bean weevil]], may help to remove sperm from the sperm storage structures]]
Antagonistic coevolution is the relationship between males and females where sexual morphology changes over time to change with the opposite's sex traits in order to achieve the maximum reproductive success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.0014-3820.2002.tb01386.x |pmid=12038533 |title=Sexually Antagonistic Coevolution in a Mating System: Combining Experimental and Comparative Approaches to Address Evolutionary Processes |journal=Evolution |volume=56 |issue=4 |pages=754–67 |year=2002 |last1=Rowe |first1=Locke |last2=Arnqvist |first2=Göran }}&lt;/ref&gt; One such development is alternative sperm storage sites, such as seminal receptacles, [[spermathecae]], and pseudospermathecae, that are complex and extremely variable to allow for more choice in sperm selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/jmor.10811 |pmid=19941380 |title=Functional morphology of the female reproductive apparatus of ''Stephanitis pyrioides'' (Heteroptera, Tingidae): A novel role for the pseudospermathecae |journal=Journal of Morphology |volume=271 |issue=4 |pages=473–82 |year=2009 |last1=Marchini |first1=Daniela |last2=Bene |first2=Giovanna Del |last3=Dallai |first3=Romano }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some cases, sperm storage sites can produce [[proteases]] that break down various proteins in male seminal fluid resulting in female selection in sperm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00493.x |pmid=18752616 |title=An Evolutionary Expressed Sequence Tag Analysis of Drosophila Spermatheca Genes |journal=Evolution |volume=62 |issue=11 |pages=2936–47 |year=2008 |last1=Prokupek |first1=Adrianne |last2=Hoffmann |first2=Federico |last3=Eyun |first3=Seong-il |last4=Moriyama |first4=Etsuko |last5=Zhou |first5=Min |last6=Harshman |first6=Lawrence }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like females, males have developed responses to counter evolutionary adaptations of the opposite sex. Responses in insects can vary in both genitalia and sperm structures, along with variations in behavior. Spiny male genitalia help to anchor the male to the female during copulation and remove sperm of previous males from female storage structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.0701170104 |pmid=17573531 |pmc=1904142 |title=Coevolution between harmful male genitalia and female resistance in seed beetles |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=104 |issue=26 |pages=10921–5 |year=2007 |last1=Ronn |first1=J |last2=Katvala |first2=M |last3=Arnqvist |first3=G }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Males have also developed alternative ways to copulate. In the case of the bed bug, males [[traumatic insemination|traumatically inseminate]] females, which allows faster passage of sperm to female sperm storage sites.&lt;ref name="Siva-Jothy et al."&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rspb.2002.2260 |pmid=12769466 |pmc=1691276 |title=A matter of taste: Direct detection of female mating status in the bedbug |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=270 |issue=1515 |pages=649–52 |year=2003 |last1=Siva-Jothy |first1=M. T |last2=Stutt |first2=A. D }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The sperm are received by the [[spermalege|mesospermalege]] and eventually reach the spermathecae, also referred to as [[Bed bug#Reproduction|seminal conceptacles]].

At the microscopic level, ''Drosophila'' males have differing sperm tail lengths that correspond to various sizes of female seminal receptacles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1076968 |pmid=12424377 |title=Sperm-Female Coevolution in Drosophila |journal=Science |volume=298 |issue=5596 |pages=1230–3 |year=2002 |last1=Miller |first1=G. T |last2=Pitnick |first2=S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Longer male sperm tail length has shown a greater reproductive success with a larger female seminal receptacle while sperm with short tail lengths have been found to be more successful in smaller seminal receptacles.

=={{anchor|cryptic female choice}}Cryptic female choice==
{{Main|Cryptic female choice}}
The ability to store and separate sperm from multiple males enables females to manipulate paternity by choosing which sperm fertilize their eggs, a process known as cryptic female choice. Evidence for this ability exists in many different taxa, including [[birds]], [[reptiles]], [[gastropods]], [[arachnids]], and [[insects]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2003.0142 |pmid=15252964 |pmc=1810032 |title=Female choice of young sperm in a genetically monogamous bird |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=271 |pages=S134–7 |year=2004 |last1=Wagner |first1=R.

As a result of clutches with greater variation in paternal genes and increased sperm competition, females can maximize both the genetic quality and number of offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.theriogenology.2009.07.002 |pmid=19632711 |title=Sperm storage in the vertebrate female reproductive tract: How does it work so well? |journal=Theriogenology |volume=73 |issue=6 |pages=713–22 |year=2010 |last1=Holt |first1=W.V |last2=Lloyd |first2=R.E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cryptic choice allows females to preferentially choose sperm. Females are thus able to mate multiple times and allocate sperm to their eggs according to paternal [[phenotype]], or according to other characteristics. In some cases, such as in the [[yellow dung fly]], certain male traits will affect the [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] of eggs laid in particular environmental conditions. Females can choose sperm based on male quality as a function of its interaction with the environment.&lt;ref name="cats"/&gt; In other species, such as the fly ''[[Dryomyza anilis]]'', females preferentially choose sperm from one storage location over another. Males of this species have developed behaviors, such as abdominal tapping, to increase their number of sperm stored in the favored storage site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1755-0998.2009.02754.x |pmid=21565024 |title=The assessment of insemination success in yellow dung flies using competitive PCR |journal=Molecular Ecology Resources |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=292–303 |year=2010 |last1=Bussière |first1=L. F |last2=Demont |first2=M |last3=Pemberton |first3=A. J |last4=Hall |first4=M. D |last5=Ward |first5=P. I }}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence for this pattern of storage, cryptic choice, and male behavior also exists in the flour beetle [[Red flour beetle|''Tribolium castaneum'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1420-9101.2003.00501.x |pmid=14635892 |title=A potential mechanism for cryptic female choice in a flour beetle |journal=Journal of Evolutionary Biology |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=170–6 |year=2003 |last1=Bloch Qazi |first1=M. C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanisms==

===Female muscular contractions===
Muscle contraction as a means of moving [[spermatozoa]] through the reproductive system into and out of the storage structures has been examined in [[Diptera]], [[Orthoptera]], and [[Lepidoptera]] as well as in the species ''[[Rhodnius prolixus]]'' and the [[boll weevil]]. In ''R. prolixus'', rhythmic peristaltic contractions of the oviduct cause contractions of the bursa copulatrix and [[spermatheca]] movement. This movement of the spermatheca results in spermatozoa migration into the spermathecal duct and into the spermatheca reservoir.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Davey |first1=KG |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/35/3/694 |title=The migration of spermatozoa in the female of ''Rhodnius prolixus'' |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |year=1958 |volume=35 |pages=694–701 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/1536488 |jstor=1536488 |title=The Internal Phenomena of Reproduction in Drosophila |journal=The Biological Bulletin |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=207–30 |year=1920 |last1=Nonidez |first1=José F }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Omura |first1=S |url=http://eprints.lib.hokudai.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2115/12719/1/40(3)_p111-128.pdf |title=Structure and function of the female genital system of ''Bombyx mori'' with special reference to the mechanism of fertilization |journal=Journal of the Faculty of Agriculture |volume=40 |issue=3 |year=1935 |pages=111–31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the boll weevil, contractions are also used to move sperm from the spermathecae so they can fertilize the egg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0022-1910(75)90099-2 |title=Functions of the spermathecal muscle of the boll weevil, Anthonomus grandis |journal=Journal of Insect Physiology |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=1275–8 |year=1975 |last1=Villavaso |first1=Eric J }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been observed in locusts, that the nervous system initiates female reproductive muscular contractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0022-1910(00)00149-9 |pmid=11249949 |title=Evidence of a neural loop involved in controlling spermathecal contractions in Locusta migratoria |journal=Journal of Insect Physiology |volume=47 |issue=6 |pages=607–616 |year=2001 |last1=Clark |first1=Julie |last2=Lange |first2=Angela B }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some species, such as ''R. prolixus'', the contractions that move spermatozoa into sperm storage are initiated by a male secretion in the ejaculate.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Male secretions, such as the [[glycoprotein]] ACP36D in ''[[Drosophila]]'', can also play a role in preparing the female reproductive system for sperm storage. It causes changes in uterine shape allowing spermatozoa access to the sperm storage organs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.0904029106 |jstor=40484802 |pmid=19805225 |pmc=2747198 |title=Acp36DE is required for uterine conformational changes in mated Drosophila females |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=106 |issue=37 |pages=15796–800 |year=2009 |last1=Avila |first1=F. W |last2=Wolfner |first2=M. F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Female insect nervous system===
The female [[Nervous system#Arthropods|insect nervous system]] affects many of the processes involved in sperm storage. The nervous system may signal for [[Muscle contraction|muscular contractions]], fluid absorption, and [[hormone]] release, all of which aid in moving the sperm into the storage organs.&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/s0022-1910(00)00149-9 |pmid=11249949 |title=Evidence of a neural loop involved in controlling spermathecal contractions in Locusta migratoria |journal=Journal of Insect Physiology |volume=47 |issue=6 |pages=607–616 |year=2001 |last1=Clark |first1=Julie |last2=Lange |first2=Angela B }}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the nervous system of female fruit flies (''Drosophila melanogaster'') was replaced with a masculinized nervous system through genetic manipulation, sperm storage was affected suggesting that the female nervous system is unique and required to store sperm properly.&lt;ref name="Arthur"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rspb.1998.0498 |jstor=51255 |pmc=1689365 |title=A female nervous system is necessary for normal sperm storage in Drosophila melanogaster: A masculinized nervous system is as good as none |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=265 |issue=1407 |pages=1749–53 |year=1998 |last1=Arthur |first1=B |last2=Hauschteck-Jungen |first2=E |last3=Nothiger |first3=R |last4=Ward |first4=P. I }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nervous system is responsible for several fertilization methods. In the [[migratory locust]] (''Locusta migratoria''), the presence of an egg in the genital chamber results in an increase of spermathecal contractions. As a result, sperm is released to fertilize the egg. A neural loop (from the VIIIth [[ganglion]] through the N2B [[nerve]] to N2B2, N2B3, N2B4, and N2B6b nerves) is then activated to direct the sperm to fertilize the egg via muscular contractions.&lt;ref name="Clark" /&gt; In the Caribbean fruit fly (''Anastrepha suspensa''), both the spermathecae and their ducts are innervated by an abdominal ganglion located under the first abdominal [[sternite]].&lt;ref name="Fritz"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1603/0013-8746(2002)095[0103:asagia]2.0.co;2 |title=A Single, Abdominal Ganglion in ''Anastrepha suspensa'' (Diptera: Tephritidae) and Its Innervation of the Female Sperm Storage Organs |journal=Annals of the Entomological Society of America |volume=95 |issue=1 |pages=103–8 |year=2002 |last1=Fritz |first1=Ann H }}&lt;/ref&gt; This location suggests that the sperm receptacle can compress and influence the amount of sperm taken in or released by the female fly.&lt;ref name="Fritz" /&gt;

The '''Fletcher Foundation''' is a nonprofit foundation that supports [[civil rights]], [[education]], and [[environmental education]].  The foundation supports efforts to develop a more just society with more equal opportunities for more of the population primarily by leveraging the financial and non-financial contributions of Fletcher Asset Management, the Fletcher Family including New York financier and philanthropist [[Buddy Fletcher|Alphonse Fletcher, Jr.]],&lt;ref&gt;http://fletcherphilanthropy.org&lt;/ref&gt; and others. Fletcher Asset Management has been accused of fraud related to its management of funds and the value of pledges Fletcher's charitable pledges are in dispute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theday.com/article/20131215/NWS01/312159915/Waterford-success-story-Buddy-Fletcher-accused-of-fraud Waterford success story Buddy Fletcher accused of fraud] 12/15/2014 The Day&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1987 graduate of [[Harvard University]], Fletcher worked in investment banking and in 1991 founded Fletcher Asset Management. A Harvard Class Marshal, Fletcher endowed a University Professorship at his alma mater, first held by philosopher [[Cornel West]] and now held by literary critic [[Henry Louis Gates, Jr]]. In 2004, in commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the landmark Supreme Court decision, [[Brown v. Board of Education]], the Fletcher Foundation announced the creation of the Alphonse Fletcher, Sr. Fellowship program, described by foundation chair Henry Louis Gates, Jr. as "Guggenheims for race issues."&lt;ref&gt;[http://thealgebraproject.org/a_fletcher_fellowship_awarded_to_bob_moses Fletcher Fellowship Awarded to Bob Moses] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113224256/http://thealgebraproject.org/a_fletcher_fellowship_awarded_to_bob_moses |date=2007-11-13 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The inaugural class of Fletcher Fellows, each awarded $50,000, was selected in 2006.

== Asia ==

=== Bangladesh ===

Bangladesh has 5 toll bridges and 4 toll roads. None of them are of an electronic collection system. In Bangladesh, roads and bridges are built by the Government. After building the roads and bridge, the governmement invites tender to give an Operation and management (O&amp;M) contract for 5 years against a fee. The O&amp;M operators maintains the bridge and collects toll on behalf of the government. The toll tariff of Bangabandhu Multipurpose Bridge (formerly known as Jamuna Bridge), length 4.8&amp;nbsp;km, the longest bridge of the country is considered very high compared with other bridges. Mr. Md. Mobarak Hossain, the CEO of Marga Net One Limited (Joint Venture by Pt. Jasa Marga (Persaro) Indonesia and Net One Solutions Ltd. Bangladesh who was also the CEO of the 2nd O&amp;M Operator of Bangabandhu (Jamuna) Bridge, feels that Taka 400 (USD 6.00)per private car is too high, while the trucks and loriies pays a maximum of USD 18.00 for single trip. The Bangabandhu Bridge is a vital link connecting the eastern part of the country with its northern part.

===China===
[[Image:TongshanXian-G106-G316-junction-0020.jpg|thumb|Toll plaza at the junction of [[China National Highway|National Highways]] G106 and G316 in [[Tongshan County, Hubei]]]]
Nearly all Chinese expressways and express routes charge tolls, although they are not often networked from one toll expressway to another. However, beginning with the [[Jingshen Expressway]], tolls are gradually being networked. Given the size of the nation, however, the task is rather difficult.

[[China National Highway]]s, which are not expressways, but "grade-A" routes, also charge tolls. Some provincial, autonomous-regional and municipal routes, as well as some major bridges, will also charge passage fees. In November 2004, legislation in China provided for a minimum length of a stretch of road or expressway in order for tolls to be charged.

===Hong Kong===
{{further|List of tunnels and bridges in Hong Kong}}
In [[Hong Kong]], most tunnels and some bridges that form part of the motorway networks are tolled to cover construction and maintenance costs.  Some built recently are managed in the [[Build-Operate-Transfer]] (BOT) basis.  The companies which build the tunnels or bridges are given franchise of a certain length of time (usually 30 years) to operate.  Ownership will be transferred to the government when the franchise expires. An example is the [[Cross Harbour Tunnel]].

=== India===
{{main|Indian Expressways}}
[[Image:Mumbai Pune ExpresswayDec2007.jpg|thumb|[[Mumbai-Pune Expressway]], [[India]]]]
[[Expressway (India)|Access-controlled roads]] in India are tolled. In addition to cash tolls, toll plazas have dedicated [[electronic toll collection]] lanes for quicker operation.

In addition, most of the [[NHDP|upgraded sections]] of the [[National Highway (India)|National Highway]] network are also tolled. These tolls are lower than those on expressways. The length of [[Expressway (India)|Indian Expressways]] is more than {{convert|500|km|abbr=on}}, also more than {{convert|2500|km|abbr=on}} of expressways are already under construction.

Currently, a [[National Highways Development Project|massive project]] is underway to expand the highway network and the [[Government of India]] plans to add an additional {{convert|18637|km|abbr=on}} of expressways to the  network by the year 2022.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report_expressway-cost-pegged-at-rs20-crore-km_1381235 Govt plans to build 18637 km expressways]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indonesia ===
''Further information: [[List of toll roads in Indonesia]]''
[[Image:Jakpek36.JPG|thumb|KM 36 of [[Jakarta–Cikampek Toll Road]].]]
[[Indonesia]] opened its first toll road, the [[Jagorawi Toll Road]], in 1978. This linked the capital city of [[Jakarta]] to the neighboring cities of [[Bogor]] and [[Ciawi]] south of the capital. 
Today, the system is still limited in its existence, as major toll routes remain in and around the major cities of [[Jakarta]], [[Bandung]], [[Surabaya]], and [[Semarang]]. 
Recently, development in inter–city routes has increased. In 2005, the [[Cipularang Toll Road]] connecting [[Bandung]] in [[West Java]] to [[Jakarta]] was completed. This is a major development for the Indonesian transport system, as a drive between [[Jakarta]] and [[Bandung]] can now be completed in just under 3 hours.

In 2015, the [[Cikampek–Palimanan Toll Road]] connecting [[Jakarta]] and [[Cirebon]] in [[West Java]] was completed. This is another major development as this Toll Road connects [[Jakarta–Cikampek Toll Road]] and [[Palimanan–Kanci Toll Road]], and a drive between [[Jakarta]] and [[Central Java]] using this Toll Road can now be completed around 4 hours.

Indonesia had 34 toll roads until October 2015 :

'''North Sumatra''' : 
[[Belmera]], connecting [[North Sumatra]].

'''Jakarta and Banten''' : 
[[Jakarta–Serpong Toll Road]], [[Jakarta–Tangerang Toll Road]], [[Tangerang–Merak Toll Road]], 
[[Prof. Dr. Sedyatmo Toll Road]], connecting [[Jakarta]] and [[Banten]].

'''Jakarta''' :
[[Jakarta Inner Ring Road]], [[Jakarta Outer Ring Road]], connecting [[Jakarta]].

'''Jakarta and West Java''' :
[[Jakarta–Cikampek Toll Road]], [[Jagorawi Toll Road]], connecting [[West Java]] and [[Jakarta]].

'''West Java''' :
[[Cipularang Toll Road]], [[Padaleunyi Toll Road]], [[Bogor Ring Road]], [[Cikampek–Palimanan Toll Road]], [[Palimanan–Kanci Toll Road]], [[Kanci–Pejagan Toll Road]], connecting [[West Java]].

'''Semarang, Central Java''' :
[[Semarang Section A, B, C Toll Road]], [[Semarang–Ungaran Toll Road]] connecting [[Semarang]].

'''East Java''' :
[[Surabaya–Gresik Toll Road]], [[Surabaya–Gempol Toll Road]], [[Waru–Juanda International Airport Toll Road]], 
[[Surabaya–Madura Bridge Toll Road]], connecting [[East Java]].

'''Denpasar, Bali Island''' :
[[Bali Mandara Toll Road]], connecting Ngurah Rai Airport–Nusa Dua, Ngurah Rai Airport–Denpasar–Benoa.

'''Makasar, South Sulawesi''' :
[[Makassar Airport Toll Road]], connecting [[Sultan Hasanuddin International Airport]].	
 
Plans for another inter–city route in [[Central Java]] between the cities of [[Semarang]] and [[Surakarta]] are under development. Eventually,{{when|date=April 2016}} the whole city in island of Java will be connected by [[Trans–Java toll road]] from [[Merak, Banten|Merak]], [[Banten]] to [[Ketapang]], [[East Java]]. If the [[Sunda Strait Bridge]] is built, the highway network in Java and Sumatra will be connected. By 2025, Indonesia may be connected with the Asia by [[Malacca Strait Bridge]] and [[Trans-Sumatra Toll Road]]. Indonesia also has a project to build [[Trans-Kalimantan Toll Road]] and [[Trans-Sulawesi Toll Road]].

===Israel===
[[Image:Israel Toll Symbol.svg|150px|thumb|right|Israeli toll road sign, showing the [[Israeli new sheqel]] symbol: ₪]]
[[Highway 6 (Israel)|Highway 6]] in [[Israel]], widely known as the Trans-Israel Highway or Cross-Israel Highway, is to date the only electronic toll highway in Israel. Currently Highway 6 is 110&amp;nbsp;km long, all of which is a freeway. This figure will grow in the next few years as additional segments, currently undergoing statutory approvals and permitting processes, are added to the main section of the road. Highway 6 uses a system of cameras and [[transponders]] to toll vehicles automatically. There are no toll booths, allowing Highway 6 to be designed as a normal freeway with interchanges.

=== Japan ===
{{Main|Expressways of Japan}}
The vast majority of Japan's extensive expressway consists of toll roads. Payment of the fare can either be made in cash as one exits or using the [[electronic toll collection]] card system.  As of 2001 the toll fees for an ordinary passenger car was 24.60 [[yen]] per kilometre plus a 150 yen terminal charge.

=== Malaysia ===
{{Main|Malaysian Expressway System}}
[[Malaysia]] has extensive toll roads that forms the majority of country's expressways which in length spans more than 1400&amp;nbsp;km ranging North to the Thai border, South to the Causeway and Second Link to Singapore, West to Klang and Pulau Indah and East towards Kuantan.  Most of the toll roads are in major cities and conurbations such as [[Klang Valley]], [[Johor Bahru]] and [[Penang]].  All of Malaysian toll roads are managed in the [[Build-Operate-Transfer]] basis as in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Japan]] (see [[#Japan|below]]).

===Pakistan===
{{Main|Motorways of Pakistan}}
All motorways and few expressways are toll roads. First such motorway M2 was opened to public in 1997. Since then the M3, M9, M10, and M1, all toll roads, have become operational. The M8 is under construction.

=== Philippines ===
{{main|Philippine expressway network}}
{{further|List of expressways in the Philippines}}
[[File:SCTEX in Dinalupihan.jpg|thumb|[[Subic–Clark–Tarlac Expressway]]]]
[[File:North Luzon Expressway (NLEX) - Balintawak (Quezon City; 2017-03-27).jpeg|thumb|[[North Luzon Expressway]]]]
[[File:SLEX Skyway Northbound.jpg|thumb|[[Metro Manila Skyway]]]]
[[File:NAIA Expressway southbound.jpg|thumb|[[NAIA Expressway]]]]
Currently, the [[Philippines]] have ten toll roads, all on the main Island of [[Luzon]].

The 84 kilometer [[North Luzon Expressway]] or NLEx, connecting [[Manila]] with the Central and Northern parts of Luzon. It starts at [[Balintawak Interchange]] in [[Quezon City]], [[Metro Manila]] and ends at Sta. Ines in [[Pampanga]].

The 93.77 kilometer [[Subic–Clark–Tarlac Expressway]] or SCTEx, connecting the [[Subic Bay Freeport Zone]], [[Clark Freeport Zone]], and the Central Techno Park in [[Tarlac City]], [[Tarlac]]. It is also connected to the North Luzon Expressway via a Spur Road in Mabalacat, Pampanga which makes it the continuation of the connection of Manila to the provinces of Central and Northern parts of Luzon. It is the longest expressway in the Philippines.

The 51 kilometer [[South Luzon Expressway]] or SLEx connecting [[Manila]] with [[Santo Tomas, Batangas]]. It is composed of two segments namely, the Osmeña Highway (formerly/also known by many as South Superhighway) which starts from [[Paco, Manila]] and continues until [[Alabang]] in [[Muntinlupa]] and the Alabang-Calamba-Santo Tomas Expressway, which is also known as the South Luzon Tollway (SLT), which comprises the Alabang to Santo Tomas, Batangas segment.

The 16 kilometer [[Metro Manila Skyway]] or simply Skyway is an elevated expressway that connects Manila with [[Alabang]], [[Muntinlupa City]] which is located above the SLEX.

The 42 kilometer [[Southern Tagalog Arterial Road]] or STAR Tollway which runs south from [[Santo Tomas, Batangas]] to the City of [[Batangas City|Batangas]]. It is also connected to the South Luzon Expressway via an exit in Santo Tomas, Batangas since 2010 which makes it the continuation of the connection of Manila to the provinces of the Southern part of Luzon as it also a part or extension of the Radial Road 3 network (see [[Radial Road 3]]).

The 14 kilometer [[Manila–Cavite Expressway]] or CAVITEx is an expressway in the south of the Manila metropolitan area. Connects Manila with the province of [[Cavite]].

The 88.85 kilometer [[Tarlac–Pangasinan–La Union Expressway]] is a four lane expressway currently under construction north of Manila in the Philippines. It connects Central Luzon and North Luzon. It starts at SCTEX in Tarlac Exit and currently ends at Binalonan Exit in [[Pangasinan]]. When the expressway is complete, the northern terminus will be at Rosario Exit in [[La Union]].

The 8.8&amp;nbsp;km [[Subic-Tipo Expressway]] or the NLEx Segment 7 is a two lane expressway in which the alignment traverses the provinces of [[Zambales]] and [[Bataan]]. It begins at Rizal Highway in [[Hermosa, Bataan]] and ends at [[Subic Freeport Zone]]/SBMA at [[Olongapo, Zambales]].

The 4&amp;nbsp;km [[Muntinlupa-Cavite Expressway]], which is also known as MCX and formerly Daang Hari-SLEX Link Expressway is a long access-controlled toll expressway linking the southern province of [[Cavite]] to [[Muntinlupa]] in the [[Philippines]]. The east end is the SLEX in Muntinlupa and the west end is at Daang Hari and Daang Reyna Road junction in Cavite.

The 11.6 kilometer [[NAIA Expressway]] is an elevated expressway that runs from the [[Metro Manila Skyway]] to [[Diokno Boulevard]], and [[Ninoy Aquino Avenue]] and [[NAIA Road]] near [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport]] Terminal 3. This elevated expressway project is divided into 4 packages. This is also the first airport expressway in the Philippines. It is located in [[Pasay]] and [[Parañaque]], and a little portion in [[Taguig]].

Only the North Luzon Expressway and the South Luzon Expressway (including the Skyway) have an [[electronic toll collection]] system, which is based on the 5.7&amp;nbsp;GHz standard.

===  Singapore ===
''Further information: [[Singapore Area Licensing Scheme]], [[Electronic Road Pricing]]''

In Singapore, toll stations are automated, thus reducing manpower. The automated toll stations, also known to the locals as [[Electronic Road Pricing|ERP]] or Electronic Road Pricing, was introduced by [[Land Transport Authority]] (LTA) to reduce city traffic jams. Although it is advanced, it is still unpopular among Singaporean drivers. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The number of toll stations is increasing rapidly and some Singaporeans even call it "Every road pay".

=== Sri Lanka ===

Sri Lanka currently operates 2 toll roads. The Southern Expressway (E 01) and the Katunayake Expressway (E 03). The Kandy Colombo Expressway (E 02) is under planning at the moment (2013). The toll revenue is used to repair and maintain the expressways.

=== Taiwan===

[[Image:Taiwan Freeway Toll Station Notification.gif|250px|left|thumb|A typical toll booth notification sign in Taiwan]]
[[Image:Taiwan road sign Art060.3.png|100px|right|thumb|Taiwanese Toll Booth Sign off freeways meaning: stop the vehicle to pay toll]]

Freeways in Taiwan are not exactly toll roads in the sense that toll gates/stations are not located at the entrance and exits of the freeway.  Toll stations with [[weigh station]]s are located every thirty to forty kilometres on the No. 1 and No. 3 National Freeways of the [[Republic of China]]. There are usually no freeway exits once a toll station notification sign appears, making it necessary for the driver to be familiar with the locations of the toll stations in advance.

''See [[Highway System in Taiwan#Toll station]] for more detailed information.''

Other toll roads in Taiwan are usually newly built bridges and tunnels. Tolls are frequently collected to pay off the construction cost and once paid off, the tolls may be repealed.

=== Tajikistan ===
Toll roads in Tajikistan are owned and operated by Innovative Road Solutions (IRS). The northern point is in the in Sughd Viloyat and the Southern point ends at Kurgan Tyube (100&amp;nbsp;km south of the capital of the country - Dushanbe). While going from end to end costs roughly $12 US Dollars for regular 2 axle vehicles, it can top to $100 for semitrucks. The IRS is setting up new toll plazas that are going to be able to read off the digital device attached to windshield while passing through at the speed of no more than 15 kph, similar to ones in the United States. This is the only toll road in the entire Central Asia with about 5 cars going through each toll plaza every minute in every direction. The more information can be found on their homepage at www.IRS.tj

=== Thailand ===
Most of the toll roads in Thailand are either within [[Greater Bangkok]] or originated from Bangkok.  They are called [[Controlled-access highway|expressways]], [[tollway]]s, and [[motorway]]s.  Two government agencies under the Ministry of Transport, namely the Expressway Authority of Thailand (EXAT) and the Department of Highways (DoH), own networks of toll roads.  Some are operated by the agencies themselves; others are operated by private concessionaires.  EXAT is in charge of Chaloem Mahanakhon Expressway, Si Rat Expressway, Chalong Rat Expressway, Udon Ratthaya Expressway, Burapha Withi Expressway and Kanchanphisek Outer Ring Road (southern section).  DoH is in charge of Uttraphimuk Tollway (formerly [[Don Mueang]] Tollway), Motorway No. 7 (Bangkok-[[Chonburi (city)|Chonburi]]), and Motorway No. 9 (Kanchanphisek Outer Ring Road - eastern section).  Both agencies have plans to build more toll roads in the future, expanding their networks to the provinces.

[[Electronic Toll Collection]] using passive [[RFID]] tags is used in Chaloem Mahanakhon, Si Rat, Chalong Rat, and Burapha Withi Expressway while Uttraphimuk Tollway  employs passive IC-card-based [[contactless payment|Touch-and-Go]] system.  There are plans to upgrade and expand ETC systems in the near future.

=== United Arab Emirates ===
The toll system [[Salik (Road Toll)|Salik]] started in [[Dubai]] in July 2007.

== Africa ==

===Morocco===
[[Image:A3 Rabat.jpg|thumb|[[Casablanca–Rabat expressway]]]]
[[Morocco]] has an extensive system of toll roads or Autoroutes. These were for the most part recently built, and from [[Casablanca]] connect all of Moroccos major cities such as [[Marrakech]], [[Rabat]], and [[Tangier]]. Operator [[Société Nationale des Autoroutes du Maroc|Autoroutes Du Maroc]] runs the network on a pay-per-use basis, with toll stations placed along its length. Goal is completing a North-South and an East-West link crossing the country. Both axis will be important sections of the ''Pan-African'' main links.&lt;ref&gt;Moroccan operator [[Société Nationale des Autoroutes du Maroc|ADM's]][http://www.adm.co.ma/admin_files/rapport2007.pdf Year 2007 report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720194551/http://www.adm.co.ma/admin_files/rapport2007.pdf |date=2011-07-20 }}, PDF file, downloaded 22 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mozambique===
The Mozambique South Africa Tollway was established in 2014 and is run by private contractors leasing the highway from the Mozambican Government and tolls will be established on many other important paved roads in Mozambique

===South Africa===
In South Africa many of the [[National routes (South Africa)|National routes]] have sections that are toll roads. In cities such as [[Cape Town]] and [[Durban]] the freeways are free of charge. However, with the introduction of electronic tolling (e-tolls) as part of the [[Gauteng Freeway Improvement Project]], tolls were introduced on the upgraded the urban freeways that are National Roads in the province of [[Gauteng]], which includes [[Johannesburg]] and [[Pretoria]]. These Gauteng tolls met resistance in the media and from parts of the population.[https://web.archive.org/web/20140910195422/http://www.thinkafricapress.com/south-africa/buckle-up-going-be-long-ride-e-tolls-gauteng-anc-da] Toll roads are run by the [[South African National Roads Agency Limited]][http://www.nra.co.za/index.html] or in the case of routes like the N3 and N4, by concessionaires.

===Zimbabwe===
In 2013 the Ntabazinduna Toll Plaza was opened outside of Bulawayo and the toll system was introduced by a South African Group named Group Five as part of a government project to provide safer highways and to also benefit the local community and also the local economy. Additionially eight more toll plazas will be operating in Zimbabwe.

{{Main|Toll roads in Europe}}
Toll roads in Europe have a long history. The first turnpike road in England was authorised in the seventeenth century. The term ''turnpike'' refers to a gate on which sharp pikes would be fixed as a defence against cavalry. Early references include the (mythical) Greek ferryman [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]] charging [[Charon's obol|a toll to ferry (dead) people]] across the river [[Acheron]]. Germanic tribes charged tolls to travellers across [[mountain pass]]es. Tolls were used in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in the 14th century and 15th century.

In some European countries payment of road tolls is made using stickers which are affixed to the windscreen.  [[Germany]] uses [[Toll Collect|a system]] based on satellite technology for large vehicles.  In other countries payment may be made in cash, by credit card, by pre-paid card or by an [[electronic toll collection]] system. Tolls may vary according to the distance travelled, the building and maintenance costs of the motorway and the type of vehicle.

Some of these toll roads are privately owned and operated.  Others are owned by the government.  Some of the government-owned toll roads are privately operated.

=== Belarus ===
Major highways in Belarus are [[toll roads]] with [[Open road tolling]] (ORT) or free-flow tolling. BelToll is an [[electronic toll collection]] system (ETC), valid from 1 July 2013 in the Republic of Belarus.

=== Croatia ===
[[Image:Autocesta A1 kod Trogira.jpg|thumb|[[A1 (Croatia)|A1 motorway]] near [[Trogir]].]]
Almost all Croatian highways are [[toll road]]s with the exception of the [[Zagreb bypass]] and [[Rijeka bypass]]. Most of the highways feature a [[closed toll collection]] system. Tolls are usually calculated according to the basic formula of 0,40 [[Croatian kuna|kn]]/km, multiplied by a factor according to the vehicle category. There are four [[Vehicle classification in Croatia|vehicle categories in Croatia]]:

# two-axle vehicles, up to 1.30 m tall measured at the front axle, including motorcycles
# three and multi-axle vehicles, up to 1.30 m tall measured at the first axle, including all vans
# vehicles more than 1.30 m tall measured at the first axle, including all vans with trailers
# same as the 3rd class, but at least four axles

At some motorways, the motorcycles are classified as a separate category and charged less than two-axle vehicles.

Each class of vehicles pays approximately 1,5 times the toll paid by the previous class. The length and the exact toll for a highway section can be found at the official website of Croatian highway authority.&lt;ref name="hrhac"&gt;[[Hrvatske autoceste]] (HAC) - Croatian highway authority&lt;/ref&gt; If a highway features an [[open toll collection]] system, the toll for the whole highway is paid at a mainline plaza. Such toll collection attracts the [[shunpike]]rs.

There are four Croatian companies that build and maintain highways and collect tolls:

* [[Hrvatske autoceste]] (Croatian Motorways Ltd)
* [[Autocesta Zagreb - Macelj]] (Zagreb - Macelj Motorway)
* [[Autocesta Rijeka - Zagreb]] (Rijeka - Zagreb Motorway)
* [[BINA Istra]]

=== France ===
[[Image:French Autoroute.jpg|thumb|A typical French autoroute.]]
In Europe, the most substantial use of toll roads is in [[France]], where most of the [[Autoroutes of France|autoroute]]s carry quite heavy tolls. In a number of countries the companies have often fallen in and out of the public sector,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} and many have had financial problems.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

=== Iceland ===
The [[Hvalfjörður Tunnel]] is tolled.

=== Ireland ===
The [[Republic of Ireland]] has three toll roads, three toll bridges, and two toll tunnels, which are operated by various independent operators. Most were built under a [[public-private partnership]] system, giving the company which arranged for the road to be built the right to collect tolls for a defined period. Tolls vary from €1.65 to €12 for cars.

=== Italy ===

Most [[Autostrada|Italian motorways]] are toll roads, with some exceptions such as some motorways in [[Southern Italy]] and [[Sicily]] or the ''[[Grande Raccordo Anulare]]'' ([[Rome]]'s ring road).

In most motorways, toll is proportional to the distance traveled and has to be paid on exit, where toll gates — {{it}} ''caselli'' — are placed. On other motorways, however, toll gates are placed directly along the route — {{it}} ''barriere'' —. In such cases, it is required to pay a fixed amount, regardless of the distance traveled. [[Autostrada A8 (Italy)|A8]], [[Autostrada A9 (Italy)|A9]], [[Autostrada A52 (Italy)|A52]] are good examples of that system.

Toll can be paid in cash, by credit card, by pre-paid card, or by [[Telepass]].

61% of the Italian motorways are handled by the "Autostrade per l'Italia S.p.A." company, and its subsidiaries. All of these carriers are now privately owned and supervised by ANAS. The network of motorways covers most of [[Italy]]: northern and central Italy are well covered, the south and Sicily are scarcely covered, [[Sardinia]] is not covered at all.

The motorway operators are required to build, operate and maintain their networks at cost and to cover their expenses from the toll they collect. The tolls vary according to the building and maintenance costs of the motorway and the type of vehicle.

Besides the motorways, only some alpine tunnels (such as the [[Mont Blanc Tunnel]]) are tolled. Today, no toll is required on other roads, including motorway-like [[dual carriageway]]s — {{it}} ''superstrade''. The first tolled superstrada is under construction now north of Venice.

=== The Netherlands ===
In the beginning of the 20th century, almost all communities collected toll on all passing traffic, usually including pedestrians and livestock. In 1953, the central government abolished all communal tolls.

As of 2008, there are three effective toll roads in Netherlands. They are for the [[Western Scheldt Tunnel]], [[Kil tunnel]], both major arteries, and the "Tolbrug" (Toll Bridge) in [[Nieuwerbrug]], a local hand-drawn bridge. Also, for the [[Wijkertunnel]], a "shadow toll" is paid by [[Rijkswaterstaat]] for each passed vehicle.

=== Norway ===
Norway has extensively been using toll as a way to finance road infrastructure in the last decades. The toll is called "bompenger" (gate coin) which from comes the first toll roads in Norway, private roads where owners were allowed to charge traffic. The toll ends when the road has been paid off.

There are also toll rings around some cities, where drivers have to pay to enter or leave the city, regardless of if the road is new or old. The first city was [[Bergen]] in 1986. The money goes to construction of intrastructure in and around the city.

=== Poland ===
[[File:Punkty poboru opłat.svg|thumb|Toll plazas in Poland]]
There are three toll highways in Poland, connecting the major cities and the nation's boundaries. Two routes travel east–west, one running between [[Łódź]] and the German border, the other currently connecting [[Katowice]] and [[Kraków]], with current construction extending the roads to the German and Ukrainian boundaries. A north–south route connects Rybnik to Katowice, and [[Torun]] to [[Gdańsk]].

=== Portugal ===
In [[Portugal]] a certain number of roads are designated Toll-Roads. They charge a fixed value per kilometre distance, with several classes depending on vehicle type and regulated by the government. Several authorised franchises run them, the largest at present being [[Brisa - Auto-estradas de Portugal|BRISA]]. For cash-free payments there exists the [[Via Verde]], an electronic toll collection system. On leaving the motorway, charges are automatically debited from a bank account.

=== Russia ===
A number of toll roads in Barnaul and Pskov Region (Nevil-Velezh (RUR 190 ($8)), Pechori-state border RUR 140), also M4-Don (18&amp;nbsp;km close to Lipetsk costs RUR20($0,75) for cars and RUR40 ($1,7) for trucks).

Overall toll network is 383&amp;nbsp;km or 0,05% of total road network. Average price in Pskov region having 226&amp;nbsp;km of toll roads is RUR 2,4-5,5 per km for cars, and RUR 7,9-19,5 for trucks. This comes close to $0,5 per km for trucks.

Ordinary speed limits apply so far. In 2007 adopted Toll Road Law and Concession Law in 2005 to develop this sector.

=== Slovenia ===
For the use of 464,7&amp;nbsp;km of the [[Highways in Slovenia|Slovenian freeways and expressways]] use of toll stickers is obligatory for all vehicles with the permissible maximum weight of 3.5 tons on motorways and expressways as of July 1, 2008. The sticker costs are €15 for 7 days, €30 for a month and €95 for a year. Motorcyclists have to pay €7.50 for 7 days, €25 for a half year and €47.50 for a year.&lt;ref name=price_DARS&gt;[http://www.dars.si/Dokumenti/Toll/Methods_of_payment/Vehicles_up_to_35_t/Vignette_308.aspx Vignette prices on DARS.si]&lt;/ref&gt; Trucks use existing toll road stops.&lt;ref name=cestnina&gt;[http://www.cestnina.si/Default.aspx?id=19766 Cestnina v Sloveniji&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080826075216/http://www.cestnina.si/Default.aspx?id=19766 |date=2008-08-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of highways and expressways without a valid and properly displayed sticker in a vehicle is a violation of the law and is punished with a fine of €300 or more.&lt;ref name=wieninternational /&gt;

Due to the high costs of toll stickers for transit drivers going to vacation to [[Croatia]]n and [[Montenegro|Montenegrin]] coast and others only passing through Slovenia, the highways are avoided by some travellers.&lt;ref name=wieninternational&gt;{{cite web

=== Spain ===
Most [[Spain|Spanish]] toll roads are networked, so you must get a ticket on entering and pay when leaving the road. Technically, all roads belong to the Government, although toll roads are built and maintained by private companies under a State concession; when the concession expires, the road is reverted to State ownership, however most of then are renewed. Toll roads are called in Spanish ''[[Controlled-access highway|autopistas]]''. Freeways, often comparable to ''autopistas'' in building and ride quality, are called '' [[autovía]]s''.

There are some ''autovías'' which are actually built and maintained by private companies, such as Pamplona-Logroño A-12&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navarra.es/home_es/Actualidad/Informes/Obras+Publicas+Transportes+y+Comunicaciones/Autivia+Pamplona-Estella+Logrono.htm Navarra.es Navarran Autonomous Community news bulletin, February 5 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noticiasdenavarra.com/ediciones/2006/04/26/vecinos/estellaymerindad/d26est31.586230.php Noticias de Navarra, May 2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927205716/http://www.noticiasdenavarra.com/ediciones/2006/04/26/vecinos/estellaymerindad/d26est31.586230.php |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or Madrid access road M45.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elpais.com/articulo/madrid/M-45/negocio/sombra/elpepuespmad/20050808elpmad_1/Tes El País, August 8 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; The company assumes the building costs and the [[Autonomous Community]] where they are located (in the given examples, [[Navarre]] and [[Madrid]]) pays a yearly per-vehicle fee to the company based upon usage statistics, called "shadow toll" (in Spanish, ''peaje en la sombra'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capitalmadrid.info/2007-04-02/4293.html Capital Madrid, march 30 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120730010406/http://www.capitalmadrid.info/2007-04-02/4293.html |date=2012-07-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The system can be regarded as a way for the Government to finance the build of new roads at the expense of the building company. Also, since the payment starts only after the road is finished, construction delays are usually shorter than those of regular state-owned freeways. However, those cannot be classified as toll roads since drivers do not need to pay any fees.

=== Sweden ===
The border-crossing [[Oresund Bridge|The Oresund Bridge]] and [[Svinesund Bridge]] have tolls. The [[Stockholm congestion tax|Stockholm]] and [[Gothenburg congestion tax|Gothenburg]] City areas have [[congestion pricing]] on entry. The [[Sundsvall Bridge]] is a proper toll bridge. Before the year 2000 road tolls did not exist in Sweden for several decades.

=== Switzerland ===

[[Image:A2 Bridge.jpg|thumb|The [[A2 motorway (Switzerland)|A2 motorway]] in [[Ticino]], suspended over viaducts]]
For the use of [[Motorways of Switzerland|Swiss motorways]] the use of toll stickers is obligatory. They costs CHF&amp;nbsp;40 per year per vehicle (a car towing a trailer needs two stickers). There are no stickers for shorter periods and they are valid 14 months (the 2010 sticker is valid from 1 December 2009 until 31 January 2011). However, this also means that a sticker bought any time during the year can only be used for less than the maximum period until January 31 of the following year.

=== Republic of Turkey ===

In the Republic of [[Turkey]] toll is collected on certain highways, the so-called ''Otoyolları'' or ''Karayolları''. This is done so by three different systems. Every toll road has lanes for all three payment methods. One method is KGS (Kartlı Geçiş Sistemi) ([[English language|English]]: ''Card passage system'') which requires a [[Stored-value card|Prepaid]] card to be presented at the toll port. Every passing will be withdrawn from the card. Another method is HGS (Hızlı Geçiş Sistemi) ([[English language|English]]: ''Fast passage system''.) which uses a [[RFID]] chip stuck to the windshield of the vehicle. This chip is scanned automatically when passing the toll collecting point and money will be automatically withdrawn from the connected bank account. The last system is OGS which is calles ''Otomatik Geçiş Sistemi'' in [[Turkish language|Turkish]], and translates ''Automatic passage system'' in [[English language|English]]. This form of payment requires a fixed amount of money to be paid for a monthly or annual subscription. When subscribed, your car will be equipped with a [[barcode]]d sticker, which will be checked by [[CCTV]] cameras automatically to check if the car is actually subscribed. The Turkish toll system can't be avoided (except for avoiding toll roads), because one can simply not pass KGS without the required card, and due to the cameras, all cars passing OGS and HGS with no or expired or counterfied chips or stickers will get a fine nicely presented at their home address.

=== United Kingdom ===
{{main|Toll roads in Great Britain|Turnpike Trust}}
[[Image:M6 Toll plaza, Great Wyrley.jpg|thumb|[[M6 Toll|M6]] Toll plaza for northbound traffic at [[Great Wyrley]]]]
Road rates were introduced in [[England]] in the seventeenth century. The first turnpike road, whereby travellers paid tolls to be used for road upkeep, was authorised in 1663 for a section of the [[Great North Road (United Kingdom)|Great North Road]] in [[Hertfordshire]].  The first [[turnpike trust]] was established by Parliament through a Turnpike Act in 1706. From 1751 until 1772 there was a flurry of interest in turnpike trusts and a further 390 were established. By 1825 over 1,000 trusts controlled 25,000 miles (40,000&amp;nbsp;km) of road in England and [[Wales]].

The rise of [[railway]] transport largely halted the improving schemes of the turnpike trusts. Unable to earn sufficient revenue from tolls alone the trusts took to requiring taxes from the local parishes. The system was never properly reformed but from the 1870s Parliament stopped renewing the acts and roads began to revert to local authorities, the last trust vanishing in 1895. The [[Local Government Act 1888]] created county councils and gave them responsibility for maintaining the major roads. There are still a small number of toll bridges left including [[Swinford toll bridge]] near [[Oxford]].

Most UK roads today are maintained from general taxation, some of which is raised from motoring taxes including [[Hydrocarbon oil duty|fuel duty]] and [[vehicle excise duty]].  Today, there are few tolls on roads in the United Kingdom - mainly toll bridges and tunnels. Until recently there were only two toll roads to which there is a [[public right of way]] (Rye Road in [[Stanstead Abbotts]] and College Road in [[Dulwich]]) together with another five or so private toll-roads. However, the motorway recently constructed to the north of [[Birmingham]] levies a usage charge, and is therefore known as the [[M6 Toll]]. It is potentially the first of a new generation of toll roads.

== North and South America ==

=== Brazil ===
In [[Brazil]], toll roads are a recent institution, and were adopted mostly in non-federal [[highways]]. The state of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] has the highest length of toll roads, which are exploited either by private companies which bought a concession from the state, or by a state owned company (see [[Highway system of São Paulo]]). In São Paulo there is also a statewide electronic collection system using a plastic transponder (e-tag) attached to the windscreen, named ''SemParar'''. There is a growing trend towards tolling in all major highways of the country, but some resistance by the population is beginning to be felt, particularly due to some abuses which are being imposed, restricting the constitutional rights of coming and going (because the Brazilian highway system has very few non-tolled vicinal roads in parallel to highways) and making some trips an extremely expensive affair, as compared to average Brazilian earning power (in São Paulo, a 1,000&amp;nbsp;km round trip may cost upward of two hundreds [[Brazilian real]] in some roads, higher than petrol expenses).

=== Canada ===
Most tolled roadways in [[Canada]] are bridges to the [[United States]], although a few domestic bridges in some provinces have tolls. In [[Vancouver]], tolls were set up to pay for the construction of the new [[Port Mann Bridge]] which connects the [[Trans Canada Highway]] from [[Surrey]] to [[Coquitlam]] over the [[Fraser River]].  Toll highways disappeared, for the most part, in the 1970s and 1980s.  In the 1990s, political pressure dropped the new tolls on an upgraded section of the [[Trans-Canada Highway]] in [[New Brunswick]].  [[Ontario Highway 407|Highway 407]] in the [[Greater Toronto Area]] is a modern ''toll route'' and does not have collection booths but an overhead sensor. It's heavily criticized as the government leased it for 99 years with the company having unlimited control of the highway and tolls so it is expensive, but still a necessity for gridlocked [[Toronto]]. [[Nova Scotia]] has a toll highway on the Trans Canada Highway between [[Debert, Nova Scotia|Debert]] and [[Oxford, Nova Scotia|Oxford]].

=== Colombia ===
Many highways in [[Colombia]] charge tolls. Motorcycles are allowed to bypass for free.

=== Ecuador ===
The [[Pan-American Highway]] in [[Ecuador]] charges tolls. Motorcycles pay a reduced fare.

=== Mexico===
[[Mexico]] has an extensive system of toll roads or Autopistas. Autopistas are built and funded by Federal taxes and are built to nearly identical standards as the US Interstate Highways System. Also, many states in Mexico have their own toll roads such as Puebla, Veracruz and Nuevo León. Motorcycles pay the same fare as cars.
All federal toll highways operate with 3 payment options, cash, credit card and electronic tag IAVE.
IAVE in all the highways is operated by Caminos y Puentes Federales (CAPUFE).

=== Panama ===
Most of the toll roads in [[Panama]] were built in the mid 1990s, with the exception of the [[Arraijan-Chorrerra Highway]]. The three modern toll roads were built after the transportation plan made by the Government of [[Japan]] in the mid 1980s using the [[Build–operate–transfer|BOT]] formula. This highways are the [[Corredor Norte]] in the north of the [[Panama City]], and the [[Corredor Sur]] in the south. Another highway was built and is the [[Panama-Colon Highway]].

=== Puerto Rico ===
There are several toll roads in Puerto Rico, where toll roads are called "autopista" (which loosely translates to "car raceway") and toll houses are called "peaje".

=== United States ===
{{Main|Toll roads in the United States}}
[[Image:Pennsylvania Turnpike westbound.jpg|thumb|[[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] westbound, approaching Pittsburgh interchange with I-376/US 22.]]
[[Image:Dallas North Tollway - Texas State Highway Loop 12 Northwest Highway - 4548 - jpfagerback 2013-05-07.jpg|thumb|[[Dallas North Tollway]] just north of the [[Texas State Highway Loop 12|Northwest Highway]]]]

A ''toll road'' in the United States, especially near the east coast, is often called a ''turnpike''. The term ''turnpike'' originated from the ''turnstile'' or gate which blocked passage until the fare was paid at a ''toll house'' (or ''toll booth'' in current terminology). Most tolled facilities in the US today use an [[electronic toll collection]] system as an alternative to paying cash. Examples of this are the [[E-ZPass]] system used on most [[toll bridge]]s and toll roads in the eastern U.S. from [[North Carolina]] to [[Maine]] and [[Illinois]]; [[Houston]]'s [[EZ Tag]], which also works in other parts of the state of [[Texas]], [[Oklahoma]]'s [[PikePass|Pikepass]] (which also works in Texas and Kansas), [[California]]'s [[FasTrak]], [[Illinois]]' [[I-Pass]], and [[Florida]]'s [[SunPass]]. Toll roads are only in 26 states as of 2006. The majority of states without any turnpikes are in the [[Western United States|West]] and [[Southern United States|South]].

After a halt in toll road construction following the establishment of the [[Interstate Highway System]] in 1956, many states are going back to implementing tolls to fund capital improvements and manage congestion.  This is because the cost of expanding and maintaining the highway network is increasing faster than the amount of revenue that can be generated by the federal [[gasoline tax]] for the [[Highway Trust Fund]].  Years after abolishing tolls, [[Kentucky]] and [[Connecticut]] are both re-examining the possibility of reinstating tolls on some highways, while several other states are advancing the construction of new toll roads to supplement their existing networks of toll-free expressways.

== Oceania ==

=== Australia ===
In Australia, a small number of motorways have been tolled due to cover the expense of their construction. Such roads can be found in the Australian cities of Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne. There are no toll roads in the Australian states of [[South Australia]], [[Western Australia]], [[Tasmania]] or any of the mainland [[States and territories of Australia|territories]]. Toll collection is by electronic toll collection; there are no longer any cash booths in Australia.

In [[Brisbane]], there are three tollway operators ([[Brisbane City Council]], [[Queensland Motorways]], and [[RiverCity Motorway]]).  Brisbane City Council owns and operates the [[Go Between Bridge]] over the [[Brisbane River]] in the city.  Queensland Motorways operates the tolls on the [[Sir Leo Hielscher Bridges]], and another two on the [[Logan Motorway]] on the south side.  RiverCity Motorway operates the [[Clem Jones Tunnel]], which runs underneath the city between the inner southern and northern suburbs.  All toll collection points are electronically operated. Another company, BrisConnections, is currently constructing another toll tunnel (the longest tunnel in Australia) called the [[Airport Link, Brisbane|Airport Link]], and will allow traffic to flow from the northern Clem Jones - [[Inner City Bypass]] interchange, direct to [[Brisbane Airport]].  Construction is due to be complete in 2012. International Travellers and people that are new to Brisbane should note, the penalty for non payment of tolls is in excess of $140 (per trip). It is best to avoid toll roads at all costs as it really saves little time and is often classed by the general Brisbane public as "revenue raising".

In [[Melbourne]], there are two companies that operate tollways within the Melbourne metropolitan area. Transurban operates [[CityLink]] covering sections of the [[Monash Freeway]], Southern Link, Western Link and the upgraded sections of the [[Tullamarine Freeway]]. ConnectEast operates [[EastLink, Melbourne|EastLink]] that runs through the Eastern Suburbs of Melbourne. All Melbourne tollways are electronically tolled. The [[West Gate Bridge]] opened as a toll bridge upon its completion in 1978, however the toll was abolished in 1985.

In [[Sydney]], many of the motorways contain at least one tolled section with a mixture of government and private ownership. The State Government owns the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] and [[Sydney Harbour Tunnel]], while the [[Metroad 2|M2 Motorway]], [[Metroad 4|M4 Motorway]], [[Metroad 5|M5 Motorway]], [[Eastern Distributor]], [[Westlink M7]] and [[Lane Cove Tunnel]] are privately operated by a variety of companies such as Macquarie Infrastructure, Transurban, and to a lesser extent Industry Super funds such as Retail Employees Super, SunSuper, and the Industry Funds Management which partly own the M5 motorway in South Western Sydney.

As well as the tolled motorways, the [[Cross City Tunnel]] - an east–west route underneath the Sydney CBD - was opened to traffic in 2005. This road has become somewhat controversial due to the relatively high toll charge and the closure of surrounding roads designed to funnel traffic through the tunnel.

All Sydney tollways accept E-tags; the [[Westlink M7]], [[Sydney Harbour Tunnel]], [[Cross City Tunnel]], [[Lane Cove Tunnel]] and from 1 December 2007 on the [[M2 Hills Motorway|M2 Motorway]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20070705000527/http://www.hillsm2.com.au/transurban_online/ne5nav_hills.nsf/LinkView/7701C3D3519B46E2CA2572C80075D69CABD5DAB709F88F70CA25703E0064DA30] [http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,22023173-5001021,00.html] have no cash booths, just E-Tag readers to zoom on through as they charge their tolls only through electronic tolling methods or through the use of number plate reading as you go through, then you have to pay after a certain time frame (for example; before 24 hours), otherwise you will get a fine in the mail. The [[M5 South Western Motorway|M5 Motorway]] moved to electronic only tolling in 2013. Tolls on the [[M4 Western Motorway|M4 Motorway]] were abolished in 2010. An E-Tag is an RFID device that allow a driver to pass through a toll point without physically stopping. When a vehicle fitted with an E-Tag passes through a toll collection point, the E-Tag identifies the electronic account of the vehicle passing through and the toll-road operator recovers the toll via that account. There are four providers of E-tag accounts in New South Wales (RTA, RoamTag, Interlink Roads, and M2 Consortium). All tags provided by these four providers can be used on every E-Tag-enabled tollway in Australia.

=== New Zealand ===
* [[Auckland Harbour Bridge]] was opened in 1959 and operated as a toll bridge until 1984. In the 1960s a group of university students attempted to disrupt the toll system by repeatedly crossing the bridge using motor-scooters (to which a very low toll applied), and paying their toll in £5 notes; the hope was that they would exhaust the supplies of change held at the toll booths. However, the toll authority got wind of their plans and got a very large supply of small change (copper coinage), so the students were soon weighed down with large amounts of small change.
* The [[Lyttelton Road Tunnel]], linking the City of [[Christchurch]] with the harbour at [[Lyttelton, New Zealand|Lyttelton]], was originally a Toll Tunnel built in 1962. The government of the day promised that as soon as the tunnel was paid for, the toll would be removed The promise was kept, and the toll was removed in the mid-1970s once the tunnel had been paid off. The Tunnel Authority building and toll booths are still there at the Heathcote end.
* The City of [[Tauranga, New Zealand|Tauranga]] operates a toll road running between the outlying settlement of Tauriko on State Highway 2 and central business district of the city. This toll road also act as a feeder route for the [[Tauranga Harbour Bridge]]. Tolls are collected by staff operating tollbooths at the western end of the road.
* The Northern Gateway Toll Road is a 7.5&amp;nbsp;km motorway extension to State Highway 1 just north of [[Auckland]]. Northbound, the toll road begins just before [[Orewa]] and ends via a pair of road tunnels through the Johnstone Hills near Puhoi. The toll road opened in January 2009 and gives motorists a choice between a more direct route or State Highway 17 via Orewa. Tolling is implemented through automatic vehicle license plate reading with cameras in an overhead gantry.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5127">'''Gloger's rule''' is an [[ecogeographical rule]] which states that within a species of [[Warm-blooded|endotherms]], more heavily [[biological pigment|pigmented]] forms tend to be found in more [[humid]] environments, e.g. near the [[equator]]. It was named after the zoologist [[Constantin Wilhelm Lambert Gloger]], who first  remarked upon this phenomenon in 1833 in a review of [[covariation]] of climate and [[aves|avian]] [[plumage]] color.&lt;ref&gt;Gloger (1833)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erwin Stresemann]] noted that the idea was already expressed by [[Peter Simon Pallas|Pallas]] in ''Zoographia Rosso-Asiatica'' (1811).&lt;ref&gt;Stresemann (1975)&lt;/ref&gt; Gloger found that birds in more humid habitats tended to be darker than their relatives from regions with higher [[arid]]ity. Over 90% of 52 North American bird species studies conform to this rule.&lt;ref&gt;Zink &amp; Remsen (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

One explanation of Gloger's rule in the case of birds appears to be the increased resistance of dark feathers to feather- or hair-degrading bacteria such as ''[[Bacillus licheniformis]]''. Feathers in humid environments have a greater bacterial load, and humid environments are more suitable for microbial growth; dark feathers or hair are more difficult to break down.&lt;ref&gt;Burtt &amp; Ichida (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; More resilient [[eumelanin]]s – dark brown to black – are deposited in hot and humid regions, whereas in arid regions, [[pheomelanin]]s – reddish to sandy color – predominate due to the benefit of [[crypsis]].

Among [[mammal]]s, there is a marked tendency in equatorial and [[tropical]] regions to have a darker skin color than poleward relatives. In this case, the underlying cause is probably the need to better protect against the more intense solar [[UV radiation]] at lower latitudes. However absorption of a certain amount of UV radiation is necessary for the production of certain [[vitamin]]s, notably [[vitamin D]] (''see also'' [[Osteomalacia]]).

This principle is also vividly demonstrated among human populations.&lt;ref&gt;Ember ''et al.'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Populations that evolved in sunnier environments closer to the equator tend to be darker-pigmented than populations originating farther from the equator. There are exceptions, however; among the most well known are the [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]]s and [[Inuit]], who have darker skin than might be expected from their native latitudes. In the first case, this is apparently an adaptation to the extremely high UV irradiation on the [[Tibetan Plateau]], whereas in the second case, the necessity to absorb UV radiation is alleviated by the Inuit's diet naturally rich in [[vitamin D]].

Di Stefano, Autilia Vitiello: IEEE 1855TM: The First IEEE Standard Sponsored by IEEE Computational Intelligence Society [Society Briefs]. IEEE Comp.Int. Mag. 11(4): 4-6 (2016)&lt;/ref&gt; FML allows modelling a [[fuzzy logic]] system in a human-readable and hardware independent way. FML is based on eXtensible Markup Language ([[XML]]). The designers of [[fuzzy systems]] with FML have a unified and high-level methodology for describing interoperable fuzzy systems. IEEE STANDARD 1855-2016 uses the [[W3C]] [[XML Schema]] definition language to define the syntax and semantics of the FML programs.

Prior to the introduction of FML, fuzzy logic practitioners could exchange information about their fuzzy algorithms by  adding to their software functions the ability to read, correctly parse, and store the results of their work in a  form compatible with the [[Fuzzy Control Language]] (FCL) described and specified by Part 7 of [[IEC 61131]].&lt;ref name="Di Stefano2013"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2013|title=On the Need of a Standard Language for Designing Fuzzy Systems|volume=296|pages=3–15|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-35488-5_1|issn=1434-9922|last1=Di Stefano|first1=Bruno N.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AcamporaLoia2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Loia|first2=Vincenzo|last3=Lee|first3=Chang-Shing|last4=Wang|first4=Mei-Hui|year=2013|title=On the Power of Fuzzy Markup Language|volume=296|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-35488-5|issn=1434-9922|last1=Acampora|first1=Giovanni}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FML lets people code [[fuzzy systems]] through a collection of correlated semantic tags that model the components of a classical [[fuzzy controller]]—such as [[knowledge base]], [[rule base]], fuzzy variables and fuzzy rules. Therefore, the FML tags used to build a fuzzy controller represent the set of lexemes used to create fuzzy expressions. To design a well-formed XML-based language, an  a XML schema describes an FML context-free grammar that defines name, type, and attributes that characterized each XML element. However, since an FML program represents only a static view of a fuzzy logic controller, the so-called eXtensible Stylesheet Language Translator ([[XSLT]]) changes this static view to a computable version. Indeed, XSLTs modules can convert the FML-based fuzzy controller in a general purpose computer language using an [[XSL]] file containing the translation description. At this level, the control is executable for the hardware. In short, FML is essentially composed by three layers:

* XML to create a new markup language for fuzzy logic control

* An XML schema to define the legal building blocks

* eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations ([[XSLT]]) to convert a fuzzy controller description into a specific language

IEEE 1855 was the first standard sponsored by the [[IEEE Computational Intelligence Society]].

The '''IT baseline protection''' (in German ''IT-Grundschutz'') approach from the German [[Federal Office for Information Security]] (FSI) is a methodology to identify and implement computer security measures in an organization. The aim is the achievement of an adequate and appropriate level of security for IT systems. To reach this goal the FSI recommends "well-proven technical, organizational, personnel, and infrastructural safeguards".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IT-Grundschutz|url=https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/Topics/ITGrundschutz/itgrundschutz_node.html|work=bsi.bund.de|publisher=BSI|accessdate=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations and federal agencies show their systematic approach to secure their IT systems (e.g. [[Information Security Management System]]) by obtaining an ''ISO/IEC 27001 Certificate on the basis of IT-Grundschutz''.

== Overview baseline security ==
The term baseline security signifies standard security measures for typical IT systems. It is used in various contexts with somewhat different meanings. For example:
* [[Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer]]: Software tool focused on Microsoft operating system and services security
* [http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/solutions/Enterprise/Security/Baseline_Security/securebasebook.html Cisco security baseline]: Vendor recommendation focused on network and network device security controls
* [http://www.nortel.com/corporate/news/collateral/ntj3_baseline_04.pdf Nortel baseline security]: Set of requirements and best practices with a focus on network operators
* ISO/IEC 13335-3 defines a baseline approach to risk management. This standard has been replaced by [[ISO/IEC 27005]], but the baseline approach was not taken over yet into the 2700x series.
* There are numerous internal baseline security policies for organizations,&lt;ref name="purdue-university"&gt;{{cite web 
  | url=http://www.ag.purdue.edu/biochem/department/Documents/Baseline%20Security%20Policy%20and%20End%20User%20Agreement.pdf
  | title=Department Baseline Security Policy and End User Agreement
  | publisher=Purdue University
  | accessdate=17 December 2009
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kent-police" /&gt;
* The German FSI has a comprehensive baseline security standard, that is compliant with the [[ISO/IEC 27000-series]]&lt;ref name="iso27000-gs" /&gt;

== FSI IT baseline protection ==
The foundation of an IT baseline protection concept is initially not a detailed risk analysis. It proceeds from overall hazards. Consequently, sophisticated classification according to damage extent and probability of occurrence is ignored. Three protection needs categories are established. With their help, the protection needs of the object under investigation can be determined. Based on these, appropriate personnel, technical, organizational and infrastructural security measures are selected from the [[IT Baseline Protection Catalogs]].

The [[Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik|Federal Office for Security in Information Technology]]'s IT Baseline Protection Catalogs offer a "cookbook recipe" for a normal level of protection. Besides probability of occurrence and potential damage extents, implementation costs are also considered. By using the Baseline Protection Catalogs, costly security analyses requiring expert knowledge are dispensed with, since overall hazards are worked with in the beginning. It is possible for the relative layman to identify measures to be taken and to implement them in cooperation with professionals.

The FSI grants a baseline protection certificate as confirmation for the successful implementation of baseline protection. In stages 1 and 2, this is based on self declaration. In stage 3, an independent, FSI-licensed [[auditor]] completes an audit. Certification process internationalization has been possible since 2006. [[ISO/IEC 27001]] certification can occur simultaneously with IT baseline protection certification. (The ISO/IEC 27001 standard is the successor of [[BS7799|BS 7799-2]]). This process is based on the new [[FSI security standards]]. This process carries a development price which has prevailed for some time. Corporations having themselves certified under the [[BS7799|BS 7799-2]] standard are obliged to carry out a [[risk assessment]]. To make it more comfortable, most deviate from the [[IT baseline protection#Protection needs determination|protection needs analysis]] pursuant to the IT Baseline Protection Catalogs. The advantage is not only conformity with the strict [[Federal Office for Information Security|FSI]], but also attainment of [[BS7799|BS 7799-2]] certification. Beyond this, the FSI offers a few help aids like the policy template and the [[GSTOOL]].

One [[data protection]] component is available, which was produced in cooperation with the German [[Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information]] and the state data protection authorities and integrated into the IT Baseline Protection Catalog.  This component is not considered, however, in the certification process.

== Baseline protection process ==
The following steps are taken pursuant to the baseline protection process during [[IT baseline protection#IT structure analysis|structure analysis]] and [[IT baseline protection#Protection needs determination|protection needs analysis]]:
* The IT network is defined.
* IT structure analysis is carried out.
* Protection needs determination is carried out.
* A baseline security check is carried out.
* IT baseline protection measures are implemented.

Creation occurs in the following steps:
* IT [[IT baseline protection#IT structure analysis|structure analysis]] (survey)
* Assessment of  [[protection need]]s
* Selection of actions
* Running comparison of nominal and actual.

=== IT structure analysis ===
An IT network includes the totality of [[infrastructure|infrastructur]]al, organizational, personnel, and technical components serving the fulfillment of a task in a particular [[electronic data processing|information processing]] application area. An IT network can thereby encompass the entire IT character of an institution or individual division, which is partitioned by organizational structures as, for example, a departmental network, or as shared [[Application software|IT applications]], for example, a personnel information system. It is necessary to analyze and document the information technological structure in question to generate an IT security concept and especially to apply the IT Baseline Protection Catalogs. Due to today's usually heavily networked IT systems, a [[network topology plan]] offers a starting point for the analysis. The following aspects must be taken into consideration:
* The available [[infrastructure]],
* The organizational and personnel framework for the IT network,
* Networked and non-networked [[Information technology|IT systems]] employed in the IT network.
* The communications connections between IT systems and externally,
* IT applications run within the IT network.

=== Protection needs determination ===
The purpose of the protection needs determination is to investigate what protection is sufficient and appropriate for the information and information technology in use.
In this connection, the damage to each application and the processed information, which could result from a breach of confidentiality, integrity or availability, is considered. Important in this context is a realistic assessment of the possible follow-on damages. A division into the three protection needs categories "low to medium", "high" and "very high" has proved itself  of value. "Public", "internal" and "secret" are often used for confidentiality.

=== Modelling ===
Heavily networked IT systems typically characterize information technology in government and business these days. As a rule, therefore, it is advantageous to consider the entire IT system and not just individual systems within the scope of an IT security analysis and concept. To be able to manage this task, it makes sense to logically partition the entire IT system into parts and to separately consider each part or even an IT network. Detailed documentation about its structure is prerequisite for the use of the IT Baseline Protection Catalogs on an IT network. This can be achieved, for example, via the IT structure analysis described above. The IT Baseline Protection Catalogs' components must ultimately be mapped onto the components of the IT network in question in a modelling step.

=== Baseline security check ===
The baseline security check is an organisational instrument offering a quick overview of the prevailing IT security level. With the help of interviews, the status quo of an existing IT network (as modelled by IT baseline protection) relative to the number of security measures implemented from the IT Baseline Protection Catalogs are investigated. The result is a catalog in which the implementation status "dispensable", "yes", "partly", or "no" is entered for each relevant measure. By identifying not yet, or only partially, implemented measures, improvement options for the security of the information technology in question are highlighted.

The baseline security check gives information about measures, which are still missing (nominal vs. actual comparison). From this follows what remains to be done to achieve baseline protection through security. Not all measures suggested by this baseline check need to be implemented. Peculiarities are to be taken into account!  It could be that several more or less unimportant applications are running on a server, which have lesser protection needs. In their totality, however, these applications are to be provided with a higher level of protection. This is called the ([[cumulation effect]]).

The applications running on a server determine its need for protection. In this connection, it is to be noted that several IT applications can run on an IT system. When this occurs, the application with the greatest need for protection determines the IT systems protection category.

Conversely, it is conceivable that an IT application with great protection needs does not automatically transfer this to the IT system. This may happen because the IT system is configured redundantly, or because only an inconsequential part is running on it. This is called the ([[distribution effect]]). This is the case, for example, with clusters.

The baseline security check maps baseline protection measures. This level suffices for low to medium protection needs. This comprises about 80% of all IT systems according to FSI estimates. For systems with high to very high protection needs, risk analysis-based information security concepts, like for example [[ISO/IEC 27000-series]] standards, are usually used.

== IT Baseline Protection Catalog and standards ==
During its 2005 restructuring and expansion of the IT Baseline Protection Catalogs, the FSI separated methodology from the IT Baseline Protection Catalog. The [[BSI 100-1]], [[BSI 100-2]], and [[BSI 100-3]] standards contain information about construction of an [[information security management system]] (ISMS), the methodology or basic protection approach, and the creation of a security analysis for elevated and very elevated protection needs building on a completed baseline protection investigation.

[[BSI 100-4]], the "Emergency management" standard, is currently in preparation. It contains elements from [[BS 25999]], [[ITIL]] Service Continuity Management combined with the relevant IT Baseline Protection Catalog components, and essential aspects for appropriate  [[Business continuity planning|Business Continuity Management]] (BCM). Implementing these standards renders [[certification]] is possible pursuant to [[BS 25999]]-2. The FSI has submitted the FSI 100-4 standards design for online commentary under.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bsi.de/literat/bsi_standard/bsi-standard_100-4_v090.pdf ''Entwurf BSI 100-4''] (pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;

The FSI brings its standards into line with international norms like the [[ISO/IEC 27001]] this way.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="53474">'''Information technology risk''', '''IT risk''', '''IT-related risk''', or '''Cyber Risk''' is any [[risk]] related to [[information technology]]. While information has long been appreciated as a valuable and important asset, the rise of the [[knowledge economy]] and the [[Digital Revolution]] has led to organizations becoming increasingly dependent on information, information processing and especially IT.  Various events or incidents that compromise IT in some way can therefore cause adverse impacts on the organization's business processes or mission, ranging from inconsequential to catastrophic in scale.

Assessing the probability of likelihood of various types of event/incident with their predicted impacts or consequences should they occur is a common way to assess and measure IT risks.&lt;ref&gt;"Risk is a combination of the likelihood of an occurrence of a hazardous event or exposure(s) and the severity of injury or ill health that can be caused by the event or exposure(s)" (OHSAS 18001:2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternative methods of measuring IT risk typically involve assessing other contributory factors such as the threats, vulnerabilities, exposures, and asset values&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://threatsketch.com/3-types-cyber-security-assessments/|title=3 Types Of Cybersecurity Assessments - Threat Sketch|date=2016-05-16|work=Threat Sketch|access-date=2017-10-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://danielmiessler.com/study/security-assessment-types/|title=Information Security Assessment Types|work=danielmiessler.com|access-date=2017-10-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Definitions==

===ISO===
'''IT risk''': ''the potential that a given [[threat (computer)|threat]] will exploit [[vulnerability (computing)|vulnerabilities]] of an [[asset (computing)|asset]] or group of assets and thereby cause harm to the organization. It is measured in terms of a combination of the probability of occurrence of an event and its consequence.''&lt;ref name=ISO27005&gt;ISO/IEC, "Information technology -- Security techniques-Information security risk management" ISO/IEC FIDIS 27005:2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Committee on National Security Systems ===
The [[Committee on National Security Systems]] of [[United States|United States of America]] defined '''risk''' in different documents:
* From CNSS Instruction No. 4009 dated 26 April 2010&lt;ref name=CNSSI4009&gt;[http://www.cnss.gov/Assets/pdf/cnssi_4009.pdf CNSS Instruction No. 4009] dated 26 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; the basic and more technical focused definition:
*: ''Risk - Possibility that a particular threat will adversely impact an IS by exploiting a particular vulnerability.''
*[[National Security Telecommunications and Information Systems Security Advisory Memoranda|National Security Telecommunications and Information Systems Security Instruction]] (NSTISSI) No. 1000,&lt;ref&gt;[http://niatec.info/GetFile.aspx?pid=567 National Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (NIACAP) by National Security Telecommunications and Information Systems Security Committee]&lt;/ref&gt; introduces a probability aspect, quite similar to NIST SP 800-30 one:
*:''Risk - A combination of the likelihood that a threat will occur, the likelihood that a threat occurrence will result in an adverse impact, and the severity of the resulting impact''

[[National Information Assurance Training and Education Center]] defines risk in the IT field as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://niatec.info/Glossary.aspx?term=4253&amp;alpha=R|title=Glossary of Terms|publisher=|accessdate=23 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The loss potential that exists as the result of threat-vulnerability pairs. Reducing either the threat or the vulnerability reduces the risk.
# The uncertainty of loss expressed in terms of probability of such loss.
# The probability that a hostile entity will successfully exploit a particular telecommunications or COMSEC system for intelligence purposes; its factors are threat and vulnerability.
# A combination of the likelihood that a threat shall occur, the likelihood that a threat occurrence shall result in an adverse impact, and the severity of the resulting adverse impact.
# the probability that a particular threat will exploit a particular vulnerability of the system.

===NIST===
Many [[NIST]] publications define '''risk''' in IT context in different publications: FISMApedia&lt;ref&gt;[http://fismapedia.org/index.php a wiki project] devoted to [[FISMA]]&lt;/ref&gt; term&lt;ref&gt;[http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk FISMApedia Risk term]&lt;/ref&gt; provide a list. Between them:
* According to [[NIST]] SP 800-30:&lt;ref name=SP80030&gt;[http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-30/sp800-30.pdf NIST SP 800-30 Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems]&lt;/ref&gt;
*: ''Risk is a function of the likelihood of a given threat-source’s exercising a particular potential vulnerability, and the resulting impact of that adverse event on the organization.''
* From NIST FIPS 200&lt;ref&gt;[http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips200/FIPS-200-final-march.pdf FIPS Publication 200 Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems]&lt;/ref&gt;
*: Risk - The level of impact on organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets, or individuals resulting from the operation of an information system given the potential impact of a threat and the likelihood of that threat occurring.

[[NIST]] SP 800-30&lt;ref name=SP80030/&gt; defines:
;IT-related risk:
:''The net mission impact considering:''
:# ''the probability that a particular threat-source will exercise (accidentally trigger or intentionally exploit) a particular information system vulnerability and''
:# ''the resulting impact if this should occur. IT-related risks arise from legal liability or mission loss due to:''
:## ''Unauthorized (malicious or accidental) disclosure, modification, or destruction of information''
:## ''Unintentional errors and omissions''
:## ''IT disruptions due to natural or man-made disasters''
:## ''Failure to exercise due care and diligence in the implementation and operation of the IT system.''

=== Risk management insight ===
IT risk is the probable frequency and probable magnitude of future loss.&lt;ref name="riskmanagementinsight.com"&gt;[http://www.riskmanagementinsight.com/media/docs/FAIR_introduction.pdf FAIR: Factor Analysis for Information Risks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141118061526/http://www.riskmanagementinsight.com/media/docs/FAIR_introduction.pdf |date=2014-11-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ISACA ===
[[ISACA]] published the [[Risk IT]] Framework in order to provides an end-to-end, comprehensive view of all risks related to the use of IT. There,&lt;ref name=riskit&gt;[http://www.isaca.org/Knowledge-Center/Research/Documents/RiskIT-FW-18Nov09-Research.pdf ISACA THE RISK IT FRAMEWORK] {{ISBN|978-1-60420-111-6}} (registration required)&lt;/ref&gt; IT risk is defined as:
:''The business risk associated with the use, ownership, operation, involvement, influence and adoption of IT within an enterprise''
According to [[Risk IT]],&lt;ref name=riskit/&gt; IT risk has a broader meaning: it encompasses not just only the negative [[impact (security)|impact]] of operations and service delivery which can bring destruction or reduction of the value of the organization, but also the benefit\value enabling risk associated to missing opportunities to use technology to enable or enhance business or the IT project management for aspects like overspending or late delivery with adverse business impact

== Measuring IT risk ==
:''You can't effectively and consistently manage what you can't measure, and you can't measure what you haven't defined.''&lt;ref name="riskmanagementinsight.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Technical Standard Risk Taxonomy {{ISBN|1-931624-77-1}} Document Number: C081 Published by The Open Group, January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Measuring IT risk (or cyber risk) can occur at many levels. At a business level the risks are managed categorically. Front line IT departments and [[Network operations center|NOC]]'s tend to measure more discreet, individual risks. Managing the nexus between them is a key role for modern [[Chief information security officer|CISO]]'s.

When measuring risk of any kind, selecting the correct equation for a given threat, asset, and available data is an important step. Doing so is subject unto itself, but there are common components of risk equations that are helpful to understand. &lt;blockquote&gt;There are four fundamental forces involved in risk management, which also apply to cybersecurity. They are assets, impact, threats, and likelihood. You have internal knowledge of and a fair amount of control over ''assets'', which are tangible and intangible things that have value. You also have some control over ''impact'', which refers to loss of, or damage to, an asset. However, ''threats'' that represent adversaries and their methods of attack are external to your control. ''Likelihood'' is the wild card in the bunch. Likelihoods determine if and when a threat will materialize, succeed, and do damage. While never fully under your control, likelihoods can be shaped and influenced to manage the risk.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Mathematically, the forces can be represented in a formula such as: &lt;math display="inline"&gt;Risk = p(Asset, Threat) \times d(Asset, Threat)
&lt;/math&gt; where p() is the likelihood that a Threat will materialize/succeed against an Asset, and d() is the likelihood of various levels of damage that may occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zu44DwAAQBAJ|title=Cybersecurity: A Business Solution|last=Arnold|first=Rob|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=978-0692944158|location=|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;   &lt;/blockquote&gt;The field of IT risk management has spawned a number of terms and techniques which are unique to the industry. Some industry terms have yet to be reconciled. For example, the term ''vulnerability'' is often used interchangeably with likelihood of occurrence, which can be problematic.  Oft encountered IT risk management terms and techniques include:
&lt;!---- to be moved to specific articles ---------&gt;
;Information security event
:''An identified occurrence of a system, service or network state indicating a possible breach of information security policy or failure of safeguards, or a previously unknown situation that may be security relevant.''&lt;ref name=ISO27005/&gt;
:''Occurrence of a particular set of circumstances''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enisa.europa.eu/act/rm/cr/risk-management-inventory/glossary#G11|title=Glossary|author=|publisher=|accessdate=23 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:* ''The event can be a single occurrence or a series of occurrences. :(ISO/IEC Guide 73)''

:* ''There can be more than one consequence from one event.''
:* ''Consequences can range from positive to negative.''
:* ''Consequences can be expressed qualitatively or quantitatively (ISO/IEC Guide 73)''

The risk '''R''' is the product of the likelihood '''L''' of a security incident occurring times the [[impact (security)|impact]] '''I''' that will be incurred to the organization due to the incident, that is:&lt;ref name=OWASP/&gt;
:'''R''' = '''L''' × '''I'''

The likelihood of a security incident occurrence is a function of the likelihood that a threat appears and the likelihood that the threat can successfully exploit the relevant system vulnerabilities.

The consequence of the occurrence of a security incident are a function of likely impact that the incident will have on the organization as a result of the harm the organization assets will sustain. Harm is related to the value of the assets to the organization; the same asset can have different values to different organizations.

So R can be function of four [[risk factor (computing)|factors]]:
* A = Value of the [[asset (computing)|assets]]
* T = the likelihood of the [[Threat (computer)|threat]]
* V = the nature of [[vulnerability (computing)|vulnerability]] i.e. the likelihood that can be exploited (proportional to the potential benefit for the attacker and inversely proportional to the cost of exploitation)
* I = the likely [[impact (security)|impact]], the extent of the harm

If numerical values (money for impact and probabilities for the other factors), the risk can be expressed in monetary terms and compared to the cost of countermeasures and the residual risk after applying the security control. It is not always practical to express this values, so in the first step of risk evaluation, risk are graded dimensionless in three or five steps scales.

[[OWASP]] proposes a practical risk measurement guideline&lt;ref name=OWASP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology|title=OWASP Risk Rating Methodology|publisher=|accessdate=23 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on:
* Estimation of Likelihood as a mean between different factors in a 0 to 9 scale:
** [[Threat agent]] factors
*** Skill level: How technically skilled is this group of threat agents? No technical skills (1), some technical skills (3), advanced computer user (4), network and programming skills (6), security penetration skills (9)
*** Motive: How motivated is this group of threat agents to find and exploit this vulnerability? Low or no reward (1), possible reward (4), high reward (9)
*** Opportunity: What resources and opportunity are required for this group of threat agents to find and exploit this vulnerability? full access or expensive resources required (0), special access or resources required (4), some access or resources required (7), no access or resources required (9)
*** Size: How large is this group of threat agents? Developers (2), system administrators (2), intranet users (4), partners (5), authenticated users (6), anonymous Internet users (9)
** [[Vulnerability (computing)|Vulnerability]] Factors: the next set of factors are related to the vulnerability involved. The goal here is to estimate the likelihood of the particular vulnerability involved being discovered and exploited. Assume the threat agent selected above.
*** Ease of discovery: How easy is it for this group of threat agents to discover this vulnerability? Practically impossible (1), difficult (3), easy (7), automated tools available (9)
*** Ease of [[exploit (computer security)|exploit]]: How easy is it for this group of threat agents to actually exploit this vulnerability? Theoretical (1), difficult (3), easy (5), automated tools available (9)
*** Awareness: How well known is this vulnerability to this group of threat agents? Unknown (1), hidden (4), obvious (6), public knowledge (9)
*** Intrusion detection: How likely is an exploit to be detected? Active detection in application (1), logged and reviewed (3), logged without review (8), not logged (9)
* Estimation of Impact as a mean between different factors in a 0 to 9 scale
** Technical Impact Factors; technical impact can be broken down into factors aligned with the traditional security areas of concern: confidentiality, integrity, availability, and accountability. The goal is to estimate the magnitude of the impact on the system if the vulnerability were to be exploited.
*** Loss of [[confidentiality]]: How much data could be disclosed and how sensitive is it? Minimal non-sensitive data disclosed (2), minimal critical data disclosed (6), extensive non-sensitive data disclosed (6), extensive critical data disclosed (7), all data disclosed (9)
*** Loss of [[integrity]]: How much data could be corrupted and how damaged is it? Minimal slightly corrupt data (1), minimal seriously corrupt data (3), extensive slightly corrupt data (5), extensive seriously corrupt data (7), all data totally corrupt (9)
*** Loss of [[availability]] How much service could be lost and how vital is it? Minimal secondary services interrupted (1), minimal primary services interrupted (5), extensive secondary services interrupted (5), extensive primary services interrupted (7), all services completely lost (9)
*** Loss of accountability: Are the threat agents' actions traceable to an individual? Fully traceable (1), possibly traceable (7), completely anonymous (9)
** Business Impact Factors: The business impact stems from the technical impact, but requires a deep understanding of what is important to the company running the application. In general, you should be aiming to support your risks with business impact, particularly if your audience is executive level. The business risk is what justifies investment in fixing security problems.
*** Financial damage: How much financial damage will result from an exploit? Less than the cost to fix the vulnerability (1), minor effect on annual profit (3), significant effect on annual profit (7), bankruptcy (9)
*** Reputation damage: Would an exploit result in reputation damage that would harm the business? Minimal damage (1), Loss of major accounts (4), loss of goodwill (5), brand damage (9)
*** Non-compliance: How much exposure does non-compliance introduce? Minor violation (2), clear violation (5), high-profile violation (7)
*** [[Privacy]] violation: How much personally identifiable information could be disclosed? One individual (3), hundreds of people (5), thousands of people (7), millions of people (9)
** If the business impact is calculated accurately use it in the following otherwise use the Technical impact
* Rate likelihood and impact in a LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH scale assuming that less than 3 is LOW, 3 to less than 6 is MEDIUM, and 6 to 9 is HIGH.
* Calculate the risk using the following table

The [[NIST Cybersecurity Framework]] encourages organizations to manage IT risk as part the ''Identify'' (ID) function:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework|title=Cybersecurity Framework|last=Keller|first=Nicole|date=2013-11-12|work=NIST|access-date=2017-10-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://threatsketch.com/free-nist-cybersecurity-framework-tools-and-resources/|title=A 10 Minute Guide to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework|last=Arnold|first=Rob|date=|website=Threat Sketch|access-date=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Risk Assessment (ID.RA)''': The organization understands the cybersecurity risk to organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets, and individuals.
* ID.RA-1: Asset vulnerabilities are identified and documented 
* ID.RA-2: Cyber threat intelligence and vulnerability information is received from information sharing forums and source 
* ID.RA-3: Threats, both internal and external, are identified and documented 
* ID.RA-4: Potential business impacts and likelihoods are identified 
* ID.RA-5: Threats, vulnerabilities, likelihoods, and impacts are used to determine risk 
* ID.RA-6: Risk responses are identified and prioritized 
'''Risk Management Strategy (ID.RM)''': The organization’s priorities, constraints, risk tolerances, and assumptions are established and used to support operational risk decisions. 
* ID.RM-1: Risk management processes are established, managed, and agreed to by organizational stakeholders 
* ID.RM-2: Organizational risk tolerance is determined and clearly expressed 
* ID.RM-3: The organization’s determination of risk tolerance is informed by its role in critical infrastructure and sector specific risk analysis

Topic: General information security. Scope: Non binding guidelines to any OECD entities (governments, businesses, other organisations and individual users who develop, own, provide, manage, service, and use information systems and networks). The OECD Guidelines state the basic principles underpinning risk management and information security practices. While no part of the text is binding as such, non-compliance with any of the principles is indicative of a serious breach of RM/RA good practices that can potentially incur liability.

=== European Union ===
The [[European Union]] issued the following, divided by topic:
* [[Privacy]]
** [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001R0045:EN:NOT Regulation (EC) No 45/2001] on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data provide an internal regulation which is a practical application of the principles of the Privacy Directive described below. Furthermore, article 35 of the Regulation requires the Community institutions and bodies to take similar precautions with regard to their telecommunications infrastructure, and to properly inform the users of any specific risks of security breaches.
** [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31995L0046:EN:NOT Directive 95/46/EC] on the protection of individuals with regard to the [[Data Protection Directive|processing of personal data]] and on the free movement of such data require that any personal data processing activity undergoes a prior risk analysis in order to determine the privacy implications of the activity, and to determine the appropriate legal, technical and organisation measures to protect such activities;is effectively protected by such measures, which must be state of the art keeping into account the sensitivity and privacy implications of the activity (including when a third party is charged with the processing task) is notified to a national data protection authority, including the measures taken to ensure the security of the activity. Furthermore, article 25 and following of the Directive requires Member States to ban the transfer of personal data to non-Member States, unless such countries have provided adequate legal protection for such personal data, or barring certain other exceptions.
** [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001D0497:EN:NOT Commission Decision 2001/497/EC of 15 June 2001] on standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data to third countries, under Directive 95/46/EC; and [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32004D0915:EN:NOT Commission Decision 2004/915/EC] of 27 December 2004 amending Decision 2001/497/EC as regards the introduction of an alternative set of standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data to third countries. Topic: Export of personal data to third countries, specifically non-E.U. countries which have not been recognised as having a data protection level that is adequate (i.e. equivalent to that of the E.U.). Both Commission Decisions provide a set of voluntary model clauses which can be used to export personal data from a data controller (who is subject to E.U. data protection rules) to a data processor outside the E.U. who is not subject to these rules or to a similar set of adequate rules.
** [[International Safe Harbor Privacy Principles]] (see below [[#USA|USA]] and [[International Safe Harbor Privacy Principles]] )

* [[National Security]]
** [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32006L0024:EN:NOT Directive 2006/24/EC] of 15 March 2006 on the retention of data generated or processed in connection with the provision of publicly available electronic communications services or of public communications networks and amending Directive 2002/58/EC (‘Data Retention Directive’). Topic: Requirement for the providers of public electronic telecommunications service providers to retain certain information for the purposes of the investigation, detection and prosecution of serious crime
** [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32008L0114:EN:NOT Council Directive 2008/114/EC] of 8 December 2008 on the identification and designation of European critical infrastructures and the assessment of the need to improve their protection. Topic: Identification and protection of European Critical Infrastructures. Scope: Applicable to Member States and to the operators of European Critical Infrastructure (defined by the draft directive as ‘critical infrastructures the disruption or destruction of which would significantly affect two or more Member States, or a single Member State if the critical infrastructure is located in another Member State. This includes effects resulting from cross-sector dependencies on other types of infrastructure’). Requires Member States to identify critical infrastructures on their territories, and to designate them as ECIs. Following this designation, the owners/operators of ECIs are required to create Operator Security Plans (OSPs), which should establish relevant security solutions for their protection
* Civil and Penal law
** [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32005F0222:EN:NOT Council Framework Decision 2005/222/JHA] of 24 February 2005 on attacks against information systems. Topic: General decision aiming to harmonise national provisions in the field of cyber crime, encompassing material criminal law (i.e. definitions of specific crimes), procedural criminal law (including investigative measures and international cooperation) and liability issues. Scope: Requires Member States to implement the provisions of the Framework Decision in their national legal frameworks. Framework decision is relevant to RM/RA because it contains the conditions under which legal liability can be imposed on legal entities for conduct of certain natural persons of authority within the legal entity. Thus, the Framework decision requires that the conduct of such figures within an organisation is adequately monitored, also because the Decision states that a legal entity can be held liable for acts of omission in this regard.

Apart from the definitions of a series of criminal offences in articles 2 to 10, the Convention is relevant to RM/RA because it states the conditions under which legal liability can be imposed on legal entities for conduct of certain natural persons of authority within the legal entity. Thus, the Convention requires that the conduct of such figures within an organisation is adequately monitored, also because the Convention states that a legal entity can be held liable for acts of omission in this regard.

=== USA ===
United States issued the following, divided by topic:
* Civil and Penal law
** [https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/ Amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure with regard to electronic discovery]. Topic: U.S. Federal rules with regard to the production of electronic documents in civil proceedings. The discovery rules allow a party in civil proceedings to demand that the opposing party produce all relevant documentation (to be defined by the requesting party) in its possession, so as to allow the parties and the court to correctly assess the matter. Through the e-discovery amendment, which entered into force on 1 December 2006, such information may now include electronic information. This implies that any party being brought before a U.S. court in civil proceedings can be asked to produce such documents, which includes finalised reports, working documents, internal memos and e-mails with regard to a specific subject, which may or may not be specifically delineated. Any party whose activities imply a risk of being involved in such proceedings must therefore take adequate precautions for the management of such information, including the secure storage. Specifically: The party must be capable of initiating a ‘litigation hold’, a technical/organisational measure which must ensure that no relevant information can be modified any longer in any way. Storage policies must be responsible: while deletion of specific information of course remains allowed when this is a part of general information management policies (‘routine, good-faith operation of the information system’, Rule 37 (f)), the wilful destruction of potentially relevant information can be punished by extremely high fines (in one specific case of 1.6 billion US$). Thus, in practice, any businesses who risk civil litigation before U.S. courts must implement adequate information management policies, and must implement the necessary measures to initiate a litigation hold.
* [[Privacy]]
** [[Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act]] (GLBA)
** [[USA PATRIOT Act, Title III]]
** [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] (HIPAA) From an RM/RA perspective, the Act is particularly known for its provisions with regard to Administrative Simplification (Title II of HIPAA). This title required the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to draft specific rule sets, each of which would provide specific standards which would improve the efficiency of the health care system and prevent abuse. As a result, the HHS has adopted five principal rules: the Privacy Rule, the Transactions and Code Sets Rule, the Unique Identifiers Rule, the Enforcement Rule, and the Security Rule. The latter, published in the Federal Register on 20 February 2003 (see: http://www.cms.hhs.gov/SecurityStandard/Downloads/securityfinalrule.pdf), is specifically relevant, as it specifies a series of administrative, technical, and physical security procedures to assure the confidentiality of electronic protected health information. These aspects have been further outlined in a set of Security Standards on Administrative, Physical, Organisational and Technical Safeguards, all of which have been published, along with a guidance document on the basics of HIPAA risk management and risk assessment &lt;http://www.cms.hhs.gov/EducationMaterials/04_SecurityMaterials.asp&gt;. European or other countries health care service providers will generally not be affected by HIPAA obligations if they are not active on the U.S. market. However, since their data processing activities are subject to similar obligations under general European law (including the Privacy Directive), and since the underlying trends of modernisation and evolution towards electronic health files are the same, the HHS safeguards can be useful as an initial yardstick for measuring RM/RA strategies put in place by European health care service providers, specifically with regard to the processing of electronic health information. HIPAA security standards include the following:
*** Administrative safeguards:
**** Security Management Process
**** Assigned Security Responsibility
**** Workforce Security
**** Information Access Management
**** Security Awareness and Training
**** Security Incident Procedures
**** Contingency Plan
**** Evaluation
**** Business Associate Contracts and Other Arrangements
*** Physical safeguards
**** Facility Access Controls
**** Workstation Use
**** Workstation Security
**** Device and Media Controls
*** Technical safeguards
**** Access Control
**** Audit Controls
**** Integrity
**** Person or Entity Authentication
**** Transmission Security
*** Organisational requirements
**** Business Associate Contracts &amp; Other Arrangements
**** Requirements for Group Health Plans
** [[International Safe Harbor Privacy Principles]] issued by the US Department of Commerce on July 21, 2000 Export of personal data from a data controller who is subject to E.U. privacy regulations to a U.S. based destination; before personal data may be exported from an entity subject to E.U. privacy regulations to a destination subject to U.S. law, the European entity must ensure that the receiving entity provides adequate safeguards to protect such data against a number of mishaps. One way of complying with this obligation is to require the receiving entity to join the Safe Harbor, by requiring that the entity self-certifies its compliance with the so-called Safe Harbor Principles. If this road is chosen, the data controller exporting the data must verify that the U.S. destination is indeed on the Safe Harbor list (see [http://web.ita.doc.gov/safeharbor/shlist.nsf/webPages/safe+harbor+list safe harbor list])

=== Short description of standards ===
The list is chiefly based on:&lt;ref name="ENISALAW"/&gt;

==== ISO ====
* [[ISO/IEC 13335]]-1:2004 - Information technology—Security techniques—Management of information and communications technology security—Part 1: Concepts and models for information and communications technology security management http://www.iso.org/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=39066. Standard containing generally accepted descriptions of concepts and models for information and communications technology security management. The standard is a commonly used code of practice, and serves as a resource for the implementation of security management practices and as a yardstick for auditing such practices. (See also http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/secpubs/otherpubs/reviso-faq.pdf)
* [[ISO/IEC TR 15443]]-1:2005 – Information technology—Security techniques—A framework for IT security assurance reference:http://www.iso.org/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=39733 (Note: this is a reference to the ISO page where the standard can be acquired. However, the standard is not free of charge, and its provisions are not publicly available. For this reason, specific provisions cannot be quoted). Topic: Security assurance – the Technical Report (TR) contains generally accepted guidelines which can be used to determine an appropriate assurance method for assessing a security service, product or environmental factor
* ISO/IEC 15816:2002 - Information technology—Security techniques—Security information objects for access control reference:http://www.iso.org/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=29139 (Note: this is a reference to the ISO page where the standard can be acquired. However, the standard is not free of charge, and its provisions are not publicly available. For this reason, specific provisions cannot be quoted). Topic: Security management – Access control. The standard allows security professionals to rely on a specific set of syntactic definitions and explanations with regard to SIOs, thus avoiding duplication or divergence in other standardisation efforts.
* ISO/IEC TR 15947:2002 - Information technology—Security techniques—IT intrusion detection framework reference:http://www.iso.org/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=29580 (Note: this is a reference to the ISO page where the standard can be acquired. However, the standard is not free of charge, and its provisions are not publicly available. For this reason, specific provisions cannot be quoted). Topic: Security management – Intrusion detection in IT systems. The standard allows security professionals to rely on a specific set of concepts and methodologies for describing and assessing security risks with regard to potential intrusions in IT systems. It does not contain any RM/RA obligations as such, but it is rather a tool for facilitating RM/RA activities in the affected field.
* [[ISO/IEC 15408]]-1/2/3:2005 - Information technology — Security techniques — Evaluation criteria for IT security — Part 1: Introduction and general model (15408-1) Part 2: Security functional requirements (15408-2) Part 3: Security assurance requirements (15408-3) reference: http://isotc.iso.org/livelink/livelink/fetch/2000/2489/Ittf_Home/PubliclyAvailableStandards.htm Topic: Standard containing a common set of requirements for the security functions of IT products and systems and for assurance measures applied to them during a security evaluation. Scope: Publicly available ISO standard, which can be voluntarily implemented. The text is a resource for the evaluation of the security of IT products and systems, and can thus be used as a tool for RM/RA. The standard is commonly used as a resource for the evaluation of the security of IT products and systems; including (if not specifically) for procurement decisions with regard to such products. The standard can thus be used as an RM/RA tool to determine the security of an IT product or system during its design, manufacturing or marketing, or before procuring it.
* [[ISO/IEC 17799]]:2005 - Information technology—Security techniques—Code of practice for information security management. reference: http://www.iso.org/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=39612&amp;ICS1=35&amp;ICS2=40&amp;ICS3= (Note: this is a reference to the ISO page where the standard can be acquired. However, the standard is not free of charge, and its provisions are not publicly available. For this reason, specific provisions cannot be quoted). Topic: Standard containing generally accepted guidelines and general principles for initiating, implementing, maintaining, and improving information security management in an organization, including business continuity management. The standard is a commonly used code of practice, and serves as a resource for the implementation of information security management practices and as a yardstick for auditing such practices. (See also [[ISO/IEC 17799]])
* ISO/IEC TR 15446:2004 – Information technology—Security techniques—Guide for the production of Protection Profiles and Security Targets. reference: http://isotc.iso.org/livelink/livelink/fetch/2000/2489/Ittf_Home/PubliclyAvailableStandards.htm Topic: Technical Report (TR) containing guidelines for the construction of Protection Profiles (PPs) and Security Targets (STs) that are intended to be compliant with ISO/IEC 15408 (the "Common Criteria"). The standard is predominantly used as a tool for security professionals to develop PPs and STs, but can also be used to assess the validity of the same (by using the TR as a yardstick to determine if its standards have been obeyed). Thus, it is a (nonbinding) normative tool for the creation and assessment of RM/RA practices.
* [[ISO/IEC 27000-series|ISO/IEC 18028]]:2006 - Information technology—Security techniques—IT network security reference: http://www.iso.org/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=40008 (Note: this is a reference to the ISO page where the standard can be acquired. However, the standard is not free of charge, and its provisions are not publicly available. For this reason, specific provisions cannot be quoted). Topic: Five part standard (ISO/IEC 18028-1 to 18028-5) containing generally accepted guidelines on the security aspects of the management, operation and use of information technology networks. The standard is considered an extension of the guidelines provided in ISO/IEC 13335 and ISO/IEC 17799 focusing specifically on network security risks. The standard is a commonly used code of practice, and serves as a resource for the implementation of security management practices and as a yardstick for auditing such practices.
* [[ISO/IEC 27001]]:2005 - Information technology—Security techniques—Information security management systems—Requirements reference: http://www.iso.org/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=42103 (Note: this is a reference to the ISO page where the standard can be acquired. However, the standard is not free of charge, and its provisions are not publicly available. For this reason, specific provisions cannot be quoted). Topic: Standard containing generally accepted guidelines for the implementation of an Information Security Management System within any given organisation. Scope: Not publicly available ISO standard, which can be voluntarily implemented. While not legally binding, the text contains direct guidelines for the creation of sound information security practices The standard is a very commonly used code of practice, and serves as a resource for the implementation of information security management systems and as a yardstick for auditing such systems and/or the surrounding practices. Its application in practice is often combined with related standards, such as BS 7799-3:2006 which provides additional guidance to support the requirements given in ISO/IEC 27001:2005 &lt;http://www.bsiglobal.com/en/Shop/Publication-Detail/?pid=000000000030125022&amp;recid=2491&gt;
* [[ISO/IEC 27001:2013]], the updated standard for information security management systems.
* ISO/IEC TR 18044:2004 – Information technology—Security techniques—Information security incident management reference: http://www.iso.org/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=35396 (Note: this is a reference to the ISO page where the standard can be acquired. However, the standard is not free of charge, and its provisions are not publicly available. For this reason, specific provisions cannot be quoted). Topic: Technical Report (TR) containing generally accepted guidelines and general principles for information security incident management in an organization.Scope: Not publicly available ISO TR, which can be voluntarily used.While not legally binding, the text contains direct guidelines for incident management. The standard is a high level resource introducing basic concepts and considerations in the field of incident response. As such, it is mostly useful as a catalyst to awareness raising initiatives in this regard.
* ISO/IEC 18045:2005 - Information technology—Security techniques—Methodology for IT security evaluation reference: http://isotc.iso.org/livelink/livelink/fetch/2000/2489/Ittf_Home/PubliclyAvailableStandards.htm Topic: Standard containing auditing guidelines for assessment of compliance with ISO/IEC 15408 (Information technology—Security techniques—Evaluation criteria for IT security) Scope Publicly available ISO standard, to be followed when evaluating compliance with ISO/IEC 15408 (Information technology—Security techniques—Evaluation criteria for IT security). The standard is a ‘companion document’, which is thus primarily of used for security professionals involved in evaluating compliance with ISO/IEC 15408 (Information technology—Security techniques—Evaluation criteria for IT security). Since it describes minimum actions to be performed by such auditors, compliance with ISO/IEC 15408 is impossible if ISO/IEC 18045 has been disregarded.
* ISO/TR 13569:2005 - Financial services—Information security guidelines reference: http://www.iso.org/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=37245 (Note: this is a reference to the ISO page where the standard can be acquired. However, the standard is not free of charge, and its provisions are not publicly available. For this reason, specific provisions cannot be quoted). Topic: Standard containing guidelines for the implementation and assessment of information security policies in financial services institutions. The standard is a commonly referenced guideline, and serves as a resource for the implementation of information security management programmes in institutions of the financial sector, and as a yardstick for auditing such programmes. (See also http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/secpubs/otherpubs/reviso-faq.pdf)
* ISO/IEC 21827:2008 - Information technology—Security techniques—Systems Security Engineering—Capability Maturity Model (SSE-CMM): ISO/IEC 21827:2008 specifies the Systems Security Engineering - Capability Maturity Model (SSE-CMM), which describes the essential characteristics of an organization's security engineering process that must exist to ensure good security engineering. ISO/IEC 21827:2008 does not prescribe a particular process or sequence, but captures practices generally observed in industry. The model is a standard metric for security engineering practices.

==== BSI ====
* [[BS 25999]]-1:2006 - Business continuity management Part 1: Code of practice Note: this is only part one of BS 25999, which was published in November 2006. Part two (which should contain more specific criteria with a view of possible accreditation) is yet to appear. reference: http://www.bsi-global.com/en/Shop/Publication-Detail/?pid=000000000030157563. Topic: Standard containing a business continuity code of practice. The standard is intended as a code of practice for business continuity management, and will be extended by a second part that should permit accreditation for adherence with the standard. Given its relative newness, the potential impact of the standard is difficult to assess, although it could be very influential to RM/RA practices, given the general lack of universally applicable standards in this regard and the increasing attention to business continuity and contingency planning in regulatory initiatives. Application of this standard can be complemented by other norms, in particular PAS 77:2006 - IT Service Continuity Management Code of Practice &lt;http://www.bsi-global.com/en/Shop/Publication-Detail/?pid=000000000030141858&gt;.The TR allows security professionals to determine a suitable methodology for assessing a security service, product or environmental factor (a deliverable). Following this TR, it can be determined which level of security assurance a deliverable is intended to meet, and if this threshold is actually met by the deliverable.
* [[BS 7799]]-3:2006 - Information security management systems—Guidelines for information security risk management reference: http://www.bsi-global.com/en/Shop/Publication-Detail/?pid=000000000030125022&amp;recid=2491 (Note: this is a reference to the BSI page where the standard can be acquired. However, the standard is not free of charge, and its provisions are not publicly available. For this reason, specific provisions cannot be quoted). Topic: Standard containing general guidelines for information security risk management.Scope: Not publicly available BSI standard, which can be voluntarily implemented. While not legally binding, the text contains direct guidelines for the creation of sound information security practices. The standard is mostly intended as a guiding complementary document to the application of the aforementioned ISO 27001:2005, and is therefore typically applied in conjunction with this standard in risk assessment practices

The '''Institut d'astrophysique de Paris''' (translated: Paris Institute of [[Astrophysics]]) is a research institute in [[Paris]], [[France]].
The Institute is part of the [[Université Pierre et Marie Curie]] and is associated with the CNRS [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique]].  It is located at 98bis, Boulevard Arago Il in the 14th [[arrondissement]] of Paris, adjacent to the [[Paris Observatory]].

== History ==
The IAP was created in 1936 by the French ministry of education under [[Jean Zay]], initially for the purpose of processing data received from the [[observatoire de Haute-Provence|Observatory of Haute-Provence]], which was created at the same time. Construction of the building started on the 6th of January 1938.  On the 15th of June the following year, [[Henri Mineur]] became the institute's first director. IAP scientists were at first  located in Paris Observatory, then in the [[École Normale Supérieure|École normale supérieure de Paris]] before arriving in the current building in 1944 which was finally completed in 1952.

==Current research==
The IAP includes 160 researchers, engineers, technicians, and administrators and regularly welcomes many visitors and students.

The main areas of research at the IAP are:

* [[General relativity]] and [[cosmology]]
* [[Structure formation|Cosmological structure formation]]
* [[High-energy astronomy|High-energy astrophysics]] 	
* Origin and evolution of [[galaxy|galaxies]]
* [[Stellar structure]]
* [[Exoplanets]]

The IAP is one of five laboratories of AERA, the European association for research in astronomy. The laboratory is situated at the interface between two disciplines, astrophysics and theoretical physics. The [[International Astronomical Union]] has its seat at the IAP.

'''Jane Morris''' (née '''Jane Burden'''; 19 October 1839&amp;nbsp;– 26 January 1914) was an embroiderer and English [[Model (art)|artists' model]] who embodied the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelite]] [[Ideal (ethics)|ideal]] of beauty. She was a model and [[muse]] to [[William Morris]] (1834–1896), the English [[textile design]]er, [[poetry|poet]], [[novel]]ist, [[translation|translator]], and [[Socialism|socialist activist]], whom she later married, and to [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]].

==Life==

[[File:Jane and May Morris circa 1865.jpg|thumb|Jane and May Morris, circa 1865]]
Jane Burden was born in [[Oxford]], the daughter of a [[stable]]man, Robert Burden, and his wife Ann Maizey, who was a laundress. At the time of her birth, her parents were living at St Helen's Passage, in the parish of [[St Peter-in-the-East]], off [[Holywell Street]] in Oxford which has since been marked with a [[blue plaque]].&lt;ref&gt;Lisle, Nicola, Cinderella story and others''[[Oxfordshire Limited Edition]]'', no. 249, pages 23–25, October 2007; and [http://www.oxfordshireblueplaques.org.uk/plaques/burden.html picture of blue plaque]&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother Ann was [[wikt:illiterate|illiterate]] and probably came to Oxford as a [[Domestic service|domestic servant]]. Little is known of Jane Burden's childhood, but it was poor and deprived.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jane &amp; May Morris: A Biographical Story|last=Marsh|first=Jan|publisher=Printed Word|year=2000|isbn=|location=Horsham, UK|pages=5-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1857, Burden and her sister Elizabeth, known as "Bessie," attended a performance of the [[Drury Lane]] Theatre Company in Oxford. Jane Burden was noticed by [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and [[Edward Burne-Jones]] who were members of a group of artists painting the [[Oxford Union murals]], based on [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] tales. Struck by her beauty, they asked her to [[Model (art)|model]] for them. Burden sat mostly for Rossetti as a model for Queen [[Guinevere]] and afterwards for [[William Morris]], who was working on an easel painting, ''La Belle [[Iseult]]'', now in the [[Tate Gallery]]. During this period, Morris fell in love with Burden and they became engaged, though by her own admission she was not in love with Morris.{{Citation needed|date = March 2016}}

Burden's education was limited and she was probably destined to go into [[domestic service]] like her mother. After her engagement, she was privately educated to become a gentleman's wife. Her keen intelligence allowed her to recreate herself. She was a voracious reader who became proficient in French and Italian, and she became an accomplished pianist with a strong background in [[European classical music|classical music]]. Her manners and speech became refined to an extent that contemporaries referred to her as "Queenly." Later in life, she had no trouble moving in upper-class circles. She was possibly the model for the heroine of the 1884 novel ''Miss Brown'' by [[Vernon Lee]] upon which [[George Bernard Shaw]] based the character of Eliza Doolittle in his play ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'' (1914) and the later film ''[[My Fair Lady]]'' (1964). She also became a skilled needlewoman who would be later renowned for her embroideries.{{Citation needed|date = March 2016}}

Jane married William Morris at [[St Michael at the Northgate]] in Oxford on 26 April 1859. Her father was described as a [[Groom (horses)|groom]], in stables at 65 [[Holywell Street]]. After the marriage, the Morrises lived at [[Red House (London)|Red House]] in [[Bexleyheath]], Kent. While living there, they had two daughters, [[Jane Alice Morris|Jane Alice]] "Jenny," born in January 1861, and [[May Morris|Mary "May"]] (March 1862–1938), who later edited her father's works. They moved to 26 Queen Square in London, which they shared with the design firm of [[Morris &amp; Co.|Morris, Marshall, Faulkner &amp; Co]]., and later bought Kelmscott House in [[Hammersmith]] as their main residence.{{Citation needed|date = March 2016}}

In 1871, Morris and Rossetti took out a joint tenancy on [[Kelmscott Manor]] on the Gloucestershire–[[Oxfordshire]]–[[Wiltshire]] borders. William Morris went to [[Iceland]], leaving his wife and Rossetti to furnish the house and spend the summer there. Jane Morris had become closely attached to Rossetti and became a favourite muse of his. Their relationship is reputed to have started in 1865 and lasted, on differing levels, until his death in 1882. They shared a deep emotional relationship, and she inspired Rossetti to write poetry and create some of his best paintings. Her discovery of his dependence on the drug, [[chloral hydrate]], which was taken for insomnia, eventually led her to distance herself from him, although they stayed in touch until he died in 1882.{{Citation needed|date = March 2016}}

In 1884, Jane Morris met the poet and political activist [[Wilfrid Scawen Blunt]] at a house party given by her close friend, [[Rosalind Howard, Countess of Carlisle|Rosalind Howard]] (later Countess of Carlisle). There appears to have been an immediate attraction between them. By 1887 at the latest, they had become lovers.&lt;ref&gt;Mancoff, p.98&lt;/ref&gt; Their sexual relationship continued until 1894 and they remained close friends until his death.{{Citation needed|date = March 2016}}

Jane Morris was an ardent supporter of [[Irish Home Rule]].{{Citation needed|date = March 2016}}

A few months before her death, she bought Kelmscott Manor to secure it for her daughters' future. However, she did not return to the house after having purchased it. Jane Morris died on 26 January 1914, while staying at 5 Brock Street in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]. She is buried in the churchyard of St. George's Church in [[Kelmscott]].{{Citation needed|date = March 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5453">'''Kurt Latte''' (9 March 1891, [[Königsberg]] – 8 June 1964, [[Tutzing]]) was a German [[classical philologist|philologist]] and classical scholar known for his work on [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]].

==Career==
The son of a doctor, Latte studied at the Universities of Königsberg, Bonn and Berlin. After taking his doctorate at Königsberg in 1913 under Ludwig Deubner with a study on cultic dance in ancient Greece, he began work on an edition of the dictionary of [[Hesychius of Alexandria]]. After service in World War I he was ''Assistent'' at the Institut für Altertumskunde of the University of Münster from 1920 to 1923, gaining his [[Habilitation]] there in 1920 with a study of Greek and Roman sacral law. In 1923 he was appointed Professor at Greifswald as successor to Johannes Mewaldts, in 1926 Professor at Basel as successor to Günther Jachmann, and in 1931 Professor at Göttingen, as successor to [[Eduard Fraenkel]]. He was forced to retire on April 1, 1936, having been classified as a Jew by the Nazis.

Having returned to Germany in 1937 from a visiting professorship in Chicago, Latte lived out the period of Nazi rule in Hamburg (where he was supported by [[Bruno Snell]]), Düsseldorf, and Osterode am Harz, where he had been invited by his erstwhile Greifswald colleague Konrat Ziegler, who hid him for a time. In 1945 he was able to resume his chair at Göttingen, but declined to endorse an appointment for Ziegler. In 1947 he was made a corresponding member of the German Academy of Sciences in Berlin. From 1949 to 1956 he was President and Vice President of the Academy of Sciences at Göttingen, as well as chairman of the Mommsen-Gesellschaft. In 1951 he received an honorary doctorate from Heidelberg. After his retirement in 1957 he moved to Tutzing and up until his death held seminars on Greek law at the University of Munich.

==Scholarly Work==
 
His major work is ''Römische Religionsgeschichte'' (Munich, 1960), which was intended to replace the work of [[Georg Wissowa]] that by then was nearly 60 years old. Although widely cited, Latte's work has not escaped criticism. Latte attempted to be systematic and historical at the same time, melding Wissowa's [[Varro]]-based systematic description with the historical approach of [[Franz Altheim]]; the resulting structure can seem haphazard.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Lipka, ''Roman Gods: A Conceptual Approach'' (Brill, 2009), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In the opinion of [[Stefan Weinstock]], Latte's understanding of [[linguistics]] was superior to that of Wissowa.&lt;ref&gt;As noted by C. Robert Phillips III, "Approaching Roman Religion: The Case for ''Wissenschaftsgeschichte''," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 25. Weinstock's essay review of Latte's book appeared in the ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 51 (1961) 206–215.&lt;/ref&gt;

Latte rejected [[animism]] as having explanatory value for the study of Roman religion, but made some use of the concept of [[sympathetic magic]], an approach criticized as inconsistent.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, "Approaching Roman Religion," pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt; His discussion of [[Priesthoods of ancient Rome|Roman priesthoods]]&lt;!--this article exists as a draft on a user page--&gt; is considered "vital."&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Smith, "The Religion of Archaic Rome," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'', p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Latte viewed Roman religious traditions as in decline in the [[Roman Republic#Late Republic (147 BC - 30)|late Republic]], and subject to political abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Susanne William Rasmussen, ''Public Portents in Republican Rome'' («L'Erma» di Bretschneider, 2003), p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; He felt, however, that the importance of [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]] had been exaggerated, and that "emperor worship" was a minor and perhaps not really a religious phenomenon at all. His is a counterweight to the predominant scholarly view that Imperial cult became increasingly central to Roman religion.&lt;ref&gt;As summarized by Allen Brent, ''The Imperial Cult and the Development of Church Order: Concepts and Images of Authority in Paganism and Early Christianity before the Age of Cyprian'' (Brill, 1999), pp. xix–xx.&lt;/ref&gt;

Latte's monumental edition of [[Hesychius of Alexandria]] was left unfinished at the time of his death (vol. 1 published in 1953, vol. 2 posthumously in 1966); the work was completed by [[Peter Allan Hansen]] and Ian C. Cunningham (vols. 3-4, 2005-2009).

[[File:Potleaf.jpg|thumb|Palmately compound leaf of [[Cannabis|hemp]]]]
A '''leaflet''' (occasionally called '''foliole''') in [[botany]] is a leaf-like part of a [[compound leaf]].&lt;ref name="WaltersKeil1996"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Walters|first1=Dirk R.|last2=Keil|first2=David J.|title=Vascular Plant Taxonomy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZbaNxSnNoecC&amp;pg=PA33|edition=4th|year=1996|publisher=Kendall Hunt Publishing Company|language=en|isbn=978-0-7872-2108-9|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though it resembles an [[entire leaf]], a leaflet is not borne on a main [[plant stem]] or branch, as a leaf is, but rather on a [[leaf|petiole]] or a branch of the leaf. Compound leaves are common in many plant families and they differ widely in [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]]. The two main classes of compound leaf morphology are [[Leaf shape|palmate]] and [[pinnate]].
For example, a ''[[Cannabis|hemp]]'' plant has palmate compound leaves, whereas some species of ''[[Acacia]]'' have pinnate leaves.

The ultimate free division (or leaflet) of a compound leaf, or a pinnate subdivision of a multipinnate leaf is called a '''[[pinnule]]''' or '''pinnula'''.

Founded in 1986 as the '''Jerome Levy Economics Institute''', the '''Levy Economics Institute''' of [[Bard College]] is a nonprofit, nonpartisan public policy think tank. The purpose of its research and other activities is to enable scholars and leaders in business, labor, and government to work together on problems of common interest. Its findings are disseminated—via publications, conferences, seminars, congressional testimony, and partnerships with other nonprofits—to a global audience of public officials, private sector executives, academics, and the general public. Through this process of scholarship, analysis, and informed debate, the Levy Institute generates effective public policy responses to economic problems that profoundly influence the quality of life in the United States and abroad.

The Levy Institute is housed on the campus of Bard College in [[Annandale-on-Hudson]], [[New York (state)|New York]], located 90 miles north of New York City. Blithewood, a Georgian-style manor at the campus's western edge, is the Institute's main research and conference facility. Designed as a private residence by [[McKim, Mead and White]] alumnus Francis L. V. Hoppin, it was completed in 1900.  The house and grounds, which includes an Italianate garden overlooking the [[Hudson River]], were incorporated as part of Bard College in 1951.

==Current research==

The Levy Institute has 18 scholars and 50 research associates. Their research focuses on such issues as stock-flow consistent macro modeling, monetary policy and financial structure, financial instability, income and wealth distribution, [[financial regulation]] and governance, gender equality and time poverty, and immigration/ethnicity and social structure.&lt;ref&gt;http://levy.org/scholar.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance==

The board of directors includes [[Leon Botstein]], the president of Bard College; Bruce C. Greenwald and [[Joseph Stiglitz]], both of [[Columbia University]]; [[Lakshman Achuthan]], managing director of the [[Economic Cycle Research Institute]]; [[Martin L. Leibowitz]], managing director of [[Morgan Stanley]]; William Julius Wilson of [[Harvard University]];&lt;ref&gt;http://levy.org/about.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dimitri B. Papadimitriou]], president of the Levy Institute, Jerome Levy Professor of Economics and executive vice president of Bard College, and managing director of [[Bard College Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bard.edu/about/contacts/#quickref About Bard | Contacts]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Masters Program==

In the Autumn of 2014 the first class of students was admitted to the Institute's Masters of Science in Economic Theory and Policy.  The new program is directed by [[Jan Kregel]] and is taught by Research Scholars at the Institute.

The '''National Institute for Health and Welfare''' (THL, {{lang-fi|Terveyden ja hyvinvoinnin laitos}}, {{lang-sv|Institutet för hälsa och välfärd}}) is a [[Finland|Finnish]] research and development institute operating under the [[Ministry of Social Affairs and Health]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stm.fi/en/frontpage Ministry of Social Affairs and Health]&lt;/ref&gt; THL was formed on 1 January 2009, with the merger of the [[National Public Health Institute of Finland]] (KTL) and the {{ill|National Research and Development Centre for Welfare and Health|fi|Stakes}}.&lt;ref name=THL_act&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi Act on the National Institute for Health and Welfare 668/2008]&lt;/ref&gt; It is the biggest expert organisation under the ministry and its most important source of consultation regarding scientific knowledge.&lt;ref name=THL&gt;[http://www.thl.fi/en THL home page]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope of THL==

THL's scope of activity includes both public health and social welfare. The Institute aims at identifying synergy opportunities not only in the collaboration between social welfare and health care, but also in applying research and the knowledge generated with this research.

THL's field of activity includes:&lt;ref name=THL_act/&gt;&lt;ref name=THL/&gt;
* promoting the welfare and health of the population
* preventing diseases and social problems
* developing social and health care activities and services

THL's main office is located in [[Helsinki]]. The Institute also has satellite offices in [[Jyväskylä]], [[Kuopio]], [[Oulu]], [[Tampere]], [[Turku]] and [[Vaasa]]. THL has a total staff of about 1300. THL's annual budget is about 100 million euros, of which about one third comes through funding sources other than the State budget. In addition, the following State institutions are subordinate to THL: state mental hospitals (in Kuopio and Vaasa), and state residential schools.

==Organisation==

Professor [[Juhani Eskola]] is the Director General of THL. The Assistant Directors General, heading the four divisions are: Marina Erhola (Health and Social Services), Terhi Kilpi (Health Protection), Marja Vaarama (Welfare and Health Policies), and Erkki Vartiainen (Welfare and Health Promotion).

==Functions==

THL functions as a governmental research and development institute which has official functions based in law.&lt;ref name=THL_act/&gt;&lt;ref name=THL/&gt; Research and development are usually intertwined. Own research generates new knowledge, but also makes it easier to absorb innovations from international science networks, and the institute then applies it for new development. On the other hand, it monitors the welfare and health of the population, as well as factors causing problems, and develops and promotes measures to improve the situation. This work often leads to new research demands. Thus the aim is high-quality research maintaining close contacts to international research networks, but keeping in mind the practical applications.&lt;ref name=THL/&gt;

THL comprises 14 departments belonging to four divisions. Most of the expenses are covered by the Government through state budget, but about a third of activities are paid from other sources, mainly competed research funding. Important sources are the Academy of Finland, Tekes – the Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation, Framework Programs of the European Union, National Institutes of Health (USA), and ministries through their own budgets. Total budget for 2010 was about €94 million, 68% from the State budget, 27% from outside funding sources, and 5% from chargeable services.&lt;ref name=THLPP&gt;[http://www.thl.fi/thl-client/pdfs/e54b4390-3210-48e0-88a1-bded8f37d5cc THL]&lt;/ref&gt;

The predecessors of THL have been responsible for vaccinations in Finland for almost a century (see [[National Public Health Institute of Finland]]). THL is active in research on vaccines, and also gives recommendations to the ministry to acquire vaccines for the public vaccination programs, monitors adverse events of vaccines, maintains certain statistics and so on. THL also does contract work for pharmaceutical and food industries. A partial source of income is clinical vaccine trials, including funds from the vaccine manufacturer GlaxoSmithKline. The legality of THL's close ties with vaccine manufactures was questioned by some parents and NGOs after unexpected side effects of H1N1 "swine flue" vaccines in 2009 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yle.fi/uutiset/news/2010/11/ties_between_big_pharma_and_thl_draw_complaints_2147563.html YLE News 17 November 2010: Ties Between Big Pharma and THL Draw Complaints]&lt;/ref&gt; The case was investigated by the Justice Chancellor of Finland, and no wrongdoings were found.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Health+officials+exonerated+over+swine+flu+vaccine+acquisition/1135268580641 Helsingin Sanomat, August 15, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the Government and funding agencies have encouraged increased collaboration with companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aka.fi/Tiedostot/Tiedostot/Asiakirjat/INDICA_verkkosivut.pdf Working group appointed by the Academy of Finland, 2005: Long-term and dynamic partnerships. Research co-operation and researcher training between universities, research institutes and business companies.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==International relations==

THL is international, and engages in extensive international co-operation. There is expert collaboration and national participation e.g. in the [[United Nations]] and UN authorities ([[World Health Organization]]), [[European Union]] (DG SANCO, ECDC), and many international associations (e.g. [[IANPHI]]). The researchers of the institute are active in many scientific organisations, there are global activities in health and welfare, European and Nordic collaboration, and co-operation with neighbouring areas.&lt;ref name=THLPP/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10230">In [[Big Bang]] [[cosmology]], '''neutrino decoupling''' refers to the epoch at which neutrinos ceased interacting with [[baryonic matter]], and thereby ceased influencing the dynamics of the universe at early times.&lt;ref&gt;Longair (2006), p. 290&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to decoupling, [[neutrino]]s were in [[thermal equilibrium]] with [[proton]]s, [[neutron]]s, and [[electron]]s, which was maintained through the [[weak interaction]]. Decoupling occurred approximately at the time when the rate of those weak interactions was slower than the rate of [[expansion of the universe]]. Alternatively, it was the time when the time scale for weak interactions became greater than the age of the [[universe]] at that time. Neutrino decoupling took place approximately one second after the Big Bang, when the [[temperature]] of the universe was approximately 10 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] [[kelvin]]s, or 1 [[MeV]].&lt;ref&gt;Longair (2006), p. 291&lt;/ref&gt;

As neutrinos rarely interact with matter, these neutrinos still exist today, analogous to the much later cosmic microwave background emitted during [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]], around 377,000 years after the Big Bang. They form the [[cosmic neutrino background]] (abbreviated CvB or CNB). The neutrinos from this event have a very low energy, around 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; times smaller than is possible with present-day direct detection.&lt;ref name="forbes_neutrino"/&gt; Even high energy neutrinos are [[neutrino detector|notoriously difficult to detect]], so the CNB may not be directly observed in detail for many years, if at all.&lt;ref name="forbes_neutrino"/&gt; However, Big Bang cosmology makes many predictions about the CNB, and there is very strong indirect evidence that the CNB exists.

==Derivation of decoupling time==
Neutrinos are scattered (interfering with [[free streaming]]) by their interactions with [[electron]]s and [[positron]]s, such as the reaction

&lt;math&gt;e^- + e^+ \longleftrightarrow \nu_e + \bar{\nu}_e&lt;/math&gt;.

The approximate rate of these interactions is set by the [[number density]] of electrons and positrons, the averaged product of the [[Cross section (physics)|cross section]] for interaction and the [[velocity]] of the particles. The number density &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; of the [[Theory of relativity|relativistic]] electrons and positrons depends on the cube of the temperature &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, so that &lt;math&gt;n \propto T^3&lt;/math&gt;. The product of the cross section and velocity for weak interactions for temperatures (energies) below W/Z boson masses (~100 GeV) is given approximately by &lt;math&gt;\langle \sigma v \rangle \sim G_F^2 T^2&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;G_F&lt;/math&gt; is [[Fermi's constant]] (as is standard in [[particle physics]] calculations, factors of the [[speed of light]] &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; are set equal to 1). Putting it all together, the rate of weak interactions &lt;math&gt; \Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is

&lt;math&gt;\Gamma = n \langle \sigma v \rangle \sim G_F^2 T^5&lt;/math&gt;.

This can be compared to the expansion rate which is given by the [[Hubble parameter]] &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, with

&lt;math&gt;H = \sqrt{\frac{8\pi}{3}G \rho}&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gravitational constant]] and &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the [[energy density]] of the universe. At this point in cosmic history, the energy density is dominated by radiation, so that &lt;math&gt;\rho \propto T^4&lt;/math&gt;. As the rate of weak interaction depends more strongly on temperature, it will fall more quickly as the universe cools. Thus when the two rates are approximately equal (dropping terms of order [[unity (mathematics)|unity]], including an effective [[degenerate energy level|degeneracy]] term which counts the number of states of particles which are interacting) gives the approximate temperature at which neutrinos decouple:

&lt;math&gt; G_F^2 T^5 \sim \sqrt{G T^4}&lt;/math&gt;.

Solving for temperature gives

&lt;math&gt;T \sim \left( \frac{\sqrt{G}}{G_F^2} \right) ^{1/3} \sim 1~\textrm{MeV}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Bernstein"&gt;Bernstein (1989), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

While this is a very rough derivation, it illustrates the important physical phenomena which determined when neutrinos decoupled.

==Observational evidence==
While neutrino decoupling can not be observed directly, it is expected to have left behind a [[cosmic neutrino background]], analogous to the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] of [[electromagnetic radiation]] which was emitted at a much later epoch. "The detection of the neutrino background is far beyond the capabilities of the present generation of neutrino detectors."&lt;ref&gt;Longair (2006), p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt; There is data, however, which indirectly indicates the presence of a neutrino background. One piece of evidence is damping of the angular [[power spectrum]] of the CMB, which results from anisotropies in the neutrino background.&lt;ref&gt;Trotta (2005), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another indirect measurement of neutrino decoupling is allowed by the role that neutrino decoupling plays in setting the ratio of [[neutron]]s to [[proton]]s. Before decoupling, the number of neutrons and protons are maintained in their equilibrium abundances by weak interactions, specifically [[beta decay]] and [[electron capture]] (or inverse beta decay) according to

&lt;math&gt;n \leftrightarrow p + e^- + \bar{\nu}_e&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt;p + e^- \leftrightarrow \nu_e + n&lt;/math&gt;.

Once the rate of weak interactions is slower than the characteristic rate of the expansion of the universe, this equilibrium cannot be maintained, and the abundance of neutrons to protons "freezes in," at a value

&lt;math&gt;\left[\frac{n}{n + p}\right] = 0.21&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Longair (2006), p. 291–292.&lt;/ref&gt;

This value is simply found by evaluating the [[Boltzmann factor]] for neutrons and protons at decoupling time, according to

&lt;math&gt;\frac{n_n(T)}{n_p(T)} = \exp\left(\frac{-\Delta m}{T}\right)&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;\Delta m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass difference between neutrons and protons and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature at decoupling.&lt;ref name="Bernstein" /&gt; This ratio is critical to the synthesis of [[atom]]s during [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]], the process which formed the majority of [[helium]] atoms in the universe, as it "is the dominant factor in determining the amount of helium produced."&lt;ref&gt;Grupen (2005), p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; As helium atoms are stable, the neutrons are locked in, and [[beta decay]] of neutrons into protons, electrons, and neutrinos can no longer occur. Thus the abundance of neutrons remained essentially fixed to the present day. This abundance can be measured by [[astronomer]]s, and, as it was determined by the ratio of neutrons to protons at neutrino decoupling, the helium abundance indirectly measures the temperature at which neutrino decoupling took place, and is in agreement with the figure derived above.&lt;ref&gt;Longair (2006), p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indirect evidence from phase changes to the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)===

Big Bang cosmology makes many predictions about the CNB, and there is very strong indirect evidence that the cosmic neutrino background exists, both from [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]] predictions of the helium abundance, and from anisotropies in the [[cosmic microwave background]]. One of these predictions is that neutrinos will have left a subtle imprint on the cosmic microwave background (CMB). It is well known that the CMB has irregularities. Some of the CMB fluctuations were roughly regularly spaced, because of the effect of [[baryonic acoustic oscillations]]. In theory, the decoupled neutrinos should have had a very slight effect on the [[Phase (waves)|phase]] of the various CMB fluctuations.&lt;ref name="forbes_neutrino"&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2016/09/09/cosmic-neutrinos-detected-confirming-the-big-bangs-last-great-prediction Cosmic Neutrinos Detected, Confirming The Big Bang's Last Great Prediction] - ''[[Forbes]]'' coverage of original paper: [https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.091301 First Detection of the Acoustic Oscillation Phase Shift Expected from the Cosmic Neutrino Background] -
Follin, Knox, Millea, Pan, pub. 
Phys. Rev. Lett. 26 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, it was reported that such shifts had been detected in the CMB. Moreover the fluctuations corresponded to neutrinos of almost exactly the temperature predicted by Big Bang theory ({{nowrap|1.96 +/-0.02K}} compared to a prediction of 1.95K), and exactly three types of neutrino, the same number of neutrino flavours currently predicted by the [[Standard Model]].&lt;ref name="forbes_neutrino"/&gt;

'''"New York Mining Disaster 1941"''' is the debut American single by the British pop group the [[Bee Gees]], released on 14 April 1967. It was written by [[Barry Gibb|Barry]] and [[Robin Gibb]]. Barring a moderately successful reissue of their Australian single "[[Spicks and Specks (song)|Spicks and Specks]]," it was the first single release of the group's international career and their first song to hit the charts in both the UK and the US. It was produced by [[Ossie Byrne]] with their manager [[Robert Stigwood]] as executive producer. The song was the first track of side two on the group's international debut album, ''[[Bee Gees' 1st]].'' This was the first single with Australian drummer [[Colin Petersen]] as an official member of the band.

==Background and writing==
On 3 January 1967, the Gibb brothers, with their parents and Byrne, set sail from Australia to England on the ship [[Fairsky]], reaching Southampton on 6 February. The brothers performed on board in exchange for passage. Later, the Gibb brothers auditioned for Stigwood; they passed, and they signed to [[RSO Records|Robert Stigwood Organisation]] on 24 February. "New York Mining Disaster 1941" was their first song that was written in 1967.&lt;ref name="own"/&gt;

The first recording session of the Bee Gees after returning to England was a second version of "[[Town of Tuxley Toymaker, Part 1]]," a song recorded by [[Billy J. Kramer|Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas]], but was first recorded by Jon Blanchfield in Australia. Kramer's version was recorded on 4 March 1967 in [[IBC Studios]], London, with the Gibb brothers on background vocals.&lt;ref name="own"/&gt;

Barry and Robin Gibb wrote the song while sitting on a darkened staircase at [[Polydor Records]] following a power cut. The echo of the passing lift inspired them to imagine that they were trapped in a mine.&lt;ref name="accident"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=7494 |title=New York Mining Disaster 1941 (Songfacts) |publisher=Songfacts |accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song recounts the story of a miner trapped in a cave-in. He is sharing a photo of his wife with a colleague ("Mr. Jones") while they hopelessly wait to be rescued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.allmusic.com/song/new-york-mining-disaster-1941-mt0030257568 |title=Bee Gees - New York Mining Disaster 1941 |last=Elias |first=Jason |work=[[Allmusic]] |publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]] |accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the liner notes for their box-set ''[[Tales from the Brothers Gibb]]'' (1990), this song was inspired by the 1966 [[Aberfan disaster|Aberfan mining disaster]] in [[Wales]]. According to Robin, there actually had also been a mining disaster in New York in 1939, but not in 1941.&lt;ref name="also"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brothersgibb.org/history-part-4.html |title=History Part 4 - The story about the Bee Gees |last=Adriaensen |first=Marion |accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second and third verses, the lyrical lines get slower and slower, as if to indicate that life is about to end for the miners. On the second chorus, the drums get louder. On the second verse, when Robin sings the line "I keep straining my ears to hear a sound," a violin was featured in response on Robin's line.

==Recording and composition==
[[File:NYMiningdisaster68sheet.png|thumb|left|1967 sheet music cover, Abigail Music, Ltd., London. "Recorded by the Bee Gees on Polydor".]]
On 7 March, the Bee Gees recorded "New York Mining Disaster 1941" in six takes, along with three other songs: "[[I Can't See Nobody]]," "Red Chair, Fade Away," and "Turn of the Century." The orchestra and some other parts were added on 13 March.&lt;ref name="own"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.columbia.edu/~brennan/beegees/67.html |title=Gibb Songs: 1967 |last=Brennan |first=Joseph |accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "New York Mining Disaster 1941" was done first, and it may have already been nominated as the first single on the strength of the Polydor demo.&lt;ref name="accident"/&gt;

The song begins in the chord of A minor; as Maurice explained: "There's a lot of weird sounds on this song like the Jew's harp, the string quartet, and of course the special way that Barry plays that guitar chord. Because of his tuning when he plays the minor at the beginning of the song which is different from a conventional A minor, it's a nice mixture when I play my conventional tuning together with Barry's tuning because his [[Open D tuning|open D]] and mine are different." Barry said, "It's Hawaiian tuning, there they play the same way I do. I got a guitar for my ninth birthday and the guy who lived across the road from us just came back from Hawaii and he was the one who taught me that tuning, that's how it started and I never changed."&lt;ref name="also"/&gt;

Robin Gibb took both leading and backing vocals, singing the high harmony while Barry sang the low harmony on the first and second verse:

[[Maurice Gibb]] recalled in a June 2001 interview with ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' magazine: "The opening chord doesn't sound like a conventional A minor. Barry was using the open D tuning he'd been taught when he was nine, and I was playing it in conventional tuning. It gives an unusual blend. People went crazy trying to figure out why they couldn't copy it."&lt;ref name="accident"/&gt;

Robin Gibb recalled to ''The Mail on Sunday'' on November 1, 2009: "We recorded this at London's IBC studio because it was dark and emulated a mining shaft. The result was a very lonely sound."&lt;ref name="accident"/&gt;

==Release and reception==
At the time, rumours circulated that the Bee Gees were [[The Beatles]] recording under a pseudonym (the Bee Gees' name was alleged to be code for "Beatles Group"), in part because the record referenced NEMS Enterprises ([[Brian Epstein]]'s management agency, which had just been joined by Bee Gees' manager [[Robert Stigwood]]). The song is unusual in that the lyrics do not contain the song's title, though the originally planned title, "Have You Seen My Wife, Mr. Jones," does appear in the chorus.&lt;ref name=pc49&gt;{{cite web|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19826/m1/ |title=Show 49 - The British are Coming! The British are Coming!: With an emphasis on Donovan, the Bee Gees and the Who. (Part 6) |publisher=Unt Digital Library |accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Atco Records|Atco]] distributed promos with a blank label and the suggestion that it was an English group whose name started with B. Many [[Disc jockey|DJ]]s thought it was a new Beatles song and played the song heavily. Atco also retitled the song "New York Mining Disaster 1941 (Have You Seen My Wife, Mr. Jones?)" to make sure people could find it in the shops.&lt;ref name="own"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://britishinvasionbands.com/the-bands/the-bee-gees/?doing_wp_cron=1363251960.7064080238342285156250 |title=The Bee Gees on British Invasion Bands |publisher=British Invasion |accessdate=14 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022175804/http://britishinvasionbands.com/the-bands/the-bee-gees/?doing_wp_cron=1363251960.7064080238342285156250 |archivedate=22 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Beatles|Beatles]] lead guitarist [[George Harrison]] met Maurice Gibb at a party several years later, and told him that he had bought a copy of "New York Mining Disaster 1941" because he thought it sounded so much like The Beatles. Maurice's response to Harrison was that the resemblance "was unintentional" and Harrison said, "I knew that, I admire your work."&lt;ref name="work"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KugbDQHX0R8C&amp;pg=PT258&amp;dq=new+york+mining+disaster+1941+they+can+tell+the+beatles&amp;hl=fil&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nuvTULrrGaeiigeQrYCAAg&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ |title=The Bee Gees - Tales Of The Brothers Gibb |last=Hughes |first=Andrew |accessdate=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barry Gibb explained about this song:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"If you sounded like the Beatles and also could write a hit single, then the hype of the machine would go into action, and your company would make sure people thought you sounded like the Beatles or thought you were the Beatles. And that sold you, attracted attention to you. It was good for us because everyone thought it was the Beatles under a different name."&lt;ref name="work"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Robin Gibb explained about this track:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"...all the DJs on radio stations in the US picked it up immediately thinking it was the Beatles, and it was a hit on that basis. It established us in those early years. It helped our following record which was nothing like the Beatles."&lt;ref name="work"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The success of this song owes a lot more to the perseverance of Robert Stigwood than he has previously been given credit for. "We had quite a hard time at getting the Bee Gees played. We weren't all totally convinced that Stigwood was picking the right song to plug, but at the end of the day, he was a forceful character. All of these guys were... [[Chas Chandler]] (manager of [[Jimi Hendrix]]) was the same, [[Kit Lambert]] (manager of [[The Who]]) was the same. They all argued their case with passion, you know, they lived it, they were like that," conceded [[Polydor Records|Polydor]]'s [[Alan Bates]]. When the ''Disc &amp; Music Echo'' reported "widespread rumours" that this song had been written by [[Lennon-McCartney|Lennon and McCartney]], Robin countered with, "Rubbish! We've always written our own songs. I've been writing since I was ten, before Lennon and McCartney were even on stage. People can say what they like. If they don't believe us, they can ask The Beatles."

Bassist Maurice Gibb, though, had previously said that "New York Mining Disaster 1941" was in fact influenced by the Beatles:&lt;ref name="work"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"New York Mining Disaster 1941" was a total rip-off of The Beatles, we were so influenced by them. In fact it started a mystery [in the USA] about us, because they started playing [it] and saying, 'They're this new group from England that begins with a B and finished with an s' so they all said, 'Ah, it's The Beatles, not naming it, they're doing that trick again.' The disc jockey would play it and play it and play it and, 'Guess who it is?' and people would guess, and they wouldn't get the answer. I heard [the idea] came actually from [[Ahmet Ertegun]] and [[Jerry Wexler]]. To us it was an honour, to actually think we were as good as The Beatles."&lt;ref name="work"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Music video and live performances==
On the video, the band only features four members (but [[Vince Melouney]] later joined the band), Barry playing his guitar, Maurice playing his [[Rickenbacker 4001]], Robin Gibb on vocals and drummer [[Colin Petersen]] wears a hat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ps-Qq7ucMA0 |title=Bee Gees - New York Mining Disaster 1941 (1967) |publisher=You Tube |accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group found time to record their first BBC session at Playhouse Theatre, Northumberland Avenue, London, with producer Bill Bebb, on which they performed this song, with the songs "In My Own Time," "One Minute Woman," and "Cucumber Castle." When the BBC Light Programme's ''Saturday Club'' presented by Brian Matthew was broadcast on April 22, it was noted that there were "rave reviews from the audition panel."&lt;ref name="work"/&gt; On the song's promotional clip, the band only feature four members (the three Gibb brothers and drummer [[Colin Petersen]]) The group (Barry, Robin, Maurice, Colin and Vince) made their first British TV appearance on ''Top of the Pops'' performing this song on May 11 and were rather awe-struck at the company they were keeping.&lt;ref name="work"/&gt; On 20 May 1967, the group performed this song on ''[[Beat-Club]],'' a German TV program.

The Bee Gees performed this song on 21 July 1967 at the Stockholm Palladium, Stockholm, Sweden., 12 August 1967 at The Civic Hall, Wolverhampton, England and Christ the King College at Newport, England on 27 September 1967. Since 1967, the song has been part of every Bee Gees concert, eventually becoming part of their acoustic medley performed during the middle of the concert. It was also performed on the show ''[[Beat-Club]]'' in [[Germany]], on that performance Robin wears a hat and plays [[violin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlSLDUGKWEc |title=Bee Gees - New York Mining Disaster 1941 Live in Beat Club |publisher=You Tube |accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was performed by the group in 1973 on ''[[The Midnight Special (TV series)|The Midnight Special]]'' with Barry and Maurice on rhythm guitar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZ5tSc3tqOE |title=Bee Gees - New York Mining Disaster - live, 1973 |publisher=You Tube |accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The 1969 [[David Bowie]] song "[[Space Oddity]]" owes a debt to the style, arrangement and lyrics of "New York Mining Disaster 1941." Like "New York Mining Disaster 1941," "Space Oddity" is about a trapped man who is doomed to die, and the song is similarly structured as a series of statements addressed to another person. "'Space Oddity' was a Bee Gees type song," Bowie’s colleague John "Hutch" Hutchinson has said. "David knew it, and he said so at the time, the way he sang it, it’s a Bee Gees thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://davidbowie.com/users/lunamagic/space1.html |title=David Bowie - Space Oddity |accessdate=13 March 2013 }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Marc Bolan]] explained: "I remember David playing me 'Space Oddity' in his room and I loved it and he said he needed a sound like the Bee Gees, who were very big then."

[[Paul McCartney]] said: "It was the 'Mining Disaster' song that [Robert Stigwood] played me. I said 'sign them, they're great!' And they went on to be even greater."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www14.brinkster.com/corteza/bg/citas.htm |title=Bee Gees |publisher=14.brinkster.com |accessdate=2014-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230235737/http://www14.brinkster.com/corteza/bg/citas.htm |archivedate=2013-12-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese Novelist [[Haruki Murakami]] made "New York Mining Disaster" the title of one of his short stories. The piece was included in his collection "[[Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Umrigar |first=Thrity |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2006/10/01/murakami_pulls_mind_bending_stories_from_the_ruins_of_broken_rules/ |title=Murakami pulls mind-bending stories from the ruins of broken rules - The Boston Globe |website=Boston.com |date=2006-10-01 |accessdate=2016-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Noctcaelador''' (from [[Latin]] ''nocturnus'' – nocturnal, ''caelum'' – sky and ''adorare'' – to adore&lt;ref name="questia"&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-175442997/academic-orientation-academic-achievement-and-noctcaelador| title =Academic Orientation, Academic Achievement, and Noctcaelador: Does Interest in Night-Sky Watching Correlate with Students' Approach to the Academic Environment?  |publisher =[[Questia]]| author=Kelly, William E.| author2=Daughtry, Don|accessdate =10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[psychological]] construct, introduced by the psychologist [[William E. Kelly]] in 2003 to describe an "emotional attachment to, or adoration of, the [[night sky]]".&lt;ref name="questia"/&gt;

According to Kelly, "noctcaelador has been associated with higher openness to experience, investigative and artistic vocational interests, sensation-seeking, a rational, cognitive approach to problem solving and need for cognition, a propensity to engage in fantasy, a tendency to become deeply involved and attentive to stimuli of interest, and a willingness to consider unusual ideas and possibilities".&lt;ref name="questia"/&gt;

==History==
In a series of lectures in the United States, the philosopher [[George Santayana]] used the appearance of the night sky as an example of what is attractive to the human mind: an intricacy delicately poised between unfathomable complexity and uninteresting simplicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Barrow| first =John| title =The Artful Universe Expanded| publisher =[[Oxford University Press]]| date =2011 | page =&lt;!-- pages aren't numbered --&gt; | isbn =0191615838}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the absence of light pollution in antiquity, stars of the sixth [[apparent magnitude]] were more widely visible by the naked eye. American philosopher [[Holmes Rolston III]] juxtaposed the ancient [[aesthetics]] of the night sky and the modern one: "Today, we are almost amused at the way the ancients fancied various [[constellation]]s there. At night, we no longer admire the [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] as a hunter, any more than by day do we admire a [[cumulus cloud]] as a basket of washing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://lamar.colostate.edu/~hrolston/Celestial-aesthetics.pdf| title =Celestial Aesthetics: Over Our Heads and/or in Our Heads |author=Holmes Rolston III|publisher =[[Colorado State University]]|page=5|date=2011| accessdate =10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Isaac Asimov]] in his short story ''[[Nightfall (Asimov short story and novel)|Nightfall]]'' (1941) tackled the first experience of the night sky by describing an [[eclipse]] on a fictitious inhabited planet with six suns.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17709">'''Parts Manufacturer Approval (PMA)''' is an approval granted by the [[United States]] [[Federal Aviation Administration|Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)]] to a manufacturer of aircraft parts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://a257.g.akamaitech.net/7/257/2422/01jan20061500/edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2006/janqtr/14cfr21.303.htm 14 C.F.R. 21.303 PMA]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approval==
It is generally illegal in the United States to install replacement or modification parts on a certificated aircraft without an airworthiness release such as a Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) or Parts Manufacturing Approval (PMA).  There are a number of other methods of compliance, including parts manufactured to government or industry standards, parts manufactured under technical standard order authorization [TSO], owner-/operator-produced parts, experimental aircraft, field approvals, etc.&lt;ref name="14_C.F.R._21.9(a)"&gt;[http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;rgn=div5&amp;view=text&amp;node=14:1.0.1.3.9&amp;idno=14#14:1.0.1.3.9.1.11.9  14 C.F.R. 21.9(a)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/AC%2020-62E.pdf|publisher=FAA|title=Advisory Circular 20-62E: Eligibility, Quality, and Identification of Aeronautical Replacement Parts|accessdate=2015-04-02|date=2010-12-23|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PMA-holding manufacturers are permitted to make replacement parts for aircraft, even though they are not the original manufacturer of the aircraft.&lt;ref name ="14_C.F.R._21.9(a)(2)"&gt;[http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;rgn=div5&amp;view=text&amp;node=14:1.0.1.3.9&amp;idno=14#14:1.0.1.3.9.1.11.9  14 C.F.R. 21.9(a)(2)]&lt;/ref&gt;  The process is analogous to 'after-market' parts for automobiles, except that the United States aircraft parts production market remains tightly regulated by the FAA.

An applicant for a PMA applies for approval from the FAA. The FAA prioritizes its review of a new application based on its internal process called Project Prioritization.&lt;ref&gt;See Aircraft Technology, Calnek, Matthew, December 2014, A Change of Priorities, http://www.aecotechnologies.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/AECO_AircraftTechnology_Dec2014.pdf, Seattle, January 5, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The FAA Order covering the application for PMA is Order 8110.42 revision D.  This document is worded as instructions to the FAA reviewing personnel.  An accompanying Advisory Circular (AC) 21.303-4 is intended to address the applicant.  8110.42C addressed both the applicant and the reviewer.  Per the order, application for a PMA can be made per the following ways:  '''Identicality''' in which the applicant attempts to convince the FAA that the PMA part is identical to the OAH (Original Approval Holder) part.  '''Identicality by Licensure i'''s accomplished by providing evidence to the FAA that the applicant has licensed the part data from the OAH.  This evidence is usually in the form of an Assist Letter provided to the applicant by the OAH.  PMA may also be granted based upon prior approval of an STC .  As an example:  If an STC were granted to alter an existing aircraft design then that approval would also apply to the parts needed to make that modification.  A PMA would be required, however, to manufacture the parts.  The last method to obtain a PMA is '''Test &amp; Computation.'''  This approach consist of one or a combination of both of the following methods:  '''General Analysis''' and '''Comparative Analysis'''.  General analysis compares the proposed part to the functional requirements of that part when installed.  Comparative Analysis compares the function of the proposed part to the OAH part.  As an example:  If a PMA application for flight control cables were to show that the PMA part exceeds the pull strength requirements of the aircraft system it is meant for, that is general analysis.  To show that it exceeds that of the OAH part is comparative analysis.  The modern trend is to use a variety of techniques in combination in order to obtain approval of complicated parts - relying on the techniques that are most accurate and best able to provide the proof of airworthiness desired.&lt;ref name="FAA_Order_8110.42C"&gt;[http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;rgn=div5&amp;view=text&amp;node=14:1.0.1.3.9&amp;idno=14#14:1.0.1.3.9.1.11.9  Parts Manufacturer Approval Procedures, FAA Order 8110.42C, Chapter 2, Paragraph 5 (June 23, 2008)]&lt;/ref&gt;  The cognizant regional FAA Aircraft Certification Office (ACO) determines if the applicant has shown compliance with all relevant airworthiness regulations and is thus entitled to design approval.

The second step in the application process is to apply to the FAA Manufacturing Inspection Divisional Office (MIDO) to obtain approval of the manufacturing quality assurance system (known as production approval).  Production approval will be granted when the FAA is satisfied that the system will not permit parts to leave the system until the parts have been verified to meet the requirements of the approved design, and the system otherwise meets the requirements of the FAA quality system regulations.&lt;ref name ="14_C.F.R._21.137"&gt;[http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;rgn=div5&amp;view=text&amp;node=14:1.0.1.3.9&amp;idno=14#14:1.0.1.3.9.7.11.5  14 C.F.R. 21.137]&lt;/ref&gt;  A Production Approval Holder (PAH) will typically already have satisfied this requirement before PMA application is made.

PMA applications based upon licensure or STC do not require ACO approval (since the data has already been approved) and can go straight to the MIDO.

== History ==
Under the Civil Air Regulations (CARs), the government had the authority to approve aircraft parts in a predecessor to the PMA rules.  This authority was found in each of the sets of airworthiness standards published in the Civil Air Regulations.&lt;ref&gt;See, Certification Procedures for Products and Parts, 29 Fed. Reg. 14562 (Oct. 24, 1964) (explaining in the preamble that the authority for producing parts had previously been in the ".18" sections of CARs 3, 4b, 5, 6, 7, 13, and 14).&lt;/ref&gt;  CAR 3.31, for example, permitted the Administrator to approve aircraft parts as early as 1947.&lt;ref&gt;See 12 Fed. Reg. 7898 (1947) (promulgating Amendment 03-3 to CAR 3).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, the Civil Aeronautics Board adjusted the location of the parts production authority from the ".31" regulations to the ".18" regulations.&lt;ref&gt;17 Fed. Reg. 1083 (Feb 5, 1952) (Civil Air Regulation Amendment 3-7 was effective March 5, 1952).&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the CAR 3 authority for modification and replacement parts could be found in section 3.18 after 1952.

In 1955, the Civil Aeronautics Board separated the parts authority out of the airworthiness standards, and placed it in a more general location so that one standard would apply to replacement and modification parts for all different forms of aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Civil Air Regulation (CAR) 1.55 (adopted on April 13, 1956).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965 CAR 1.55 became Federal Aviation Regulation section 21.303.&lt;ref&gt;Certification Procedures for Products and Parts, 29 Fed. Reg. 14562 (Oct. 24, 1964) (this change became effective February 1, 1965).&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1965 regulatory change also imposed specific obligations on the PMA holder related to the Fabrication Inspection System.&lt;ref&gt;14 C.F.R. § 21.303(c) (1965).&lt;/ref&gt;

Amendment 21-38 of Part 21 was published May 26, 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Replacement and Modification Parts, 37 Fed. Reg. 10658 (May 26, 1972) (this change became effective June 26, 1972).&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the next rule change to affect PMAs.  This rule eliminated the incorporation by reference of type certification requirements in favor of PMA-specific data submission requirements.  This change established the separate process and separate requirements for data that must be submitted by an applicant for a PMA (prior to this there was no explicit distinction between the application data requirements for type certificated products and the data requirements for PMAed articles).&lt;ref&gt;14 C.F.R. § 21.303(c) (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;

The aircraft parts [[Aftermarket (merchandise)|aftermarket]] expanded greatly in the 1980s as airlines sought to reduce the costs of spares by finding alternative sources of parts. During this time period, though, many manufacturers failed to obtain PMA approvals from the FAA.

In the 1990s, the FAA engaged in an "Enhanced Enforcement" program that educated the industry about the importance of approval and as a consequence a huge number of parts were approved through formal FAA mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=1995_register&amp;docid=fr27fe95-2 60 Fed. Reg. 10480 (February 27, 1995)]&lt;/ref&gt;   Under this program, companies that had previously manufactured aircraft parts without PMAs could apply for PMAs in order to bring their manufacturing operations into full compliance with the regulations.  This movement brought an explosion of PMA parts to the marketplace.

== 2009 Rule Change ==
The FAA published a significant revision to the U.S. manufacturing regulations on October 16, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faa.gov/aircraft/air_cert/production_approvals/14cfr_amendments/media/FAA-2006-25877.pdf &lt;u&gt;Production and Airworthiness Approvals, Part Marking, and Miscellaneous Amendments&lt;/u&gt;, 74 Fed. Reg. 53368 (October 16, 2009)]&lt;/ref&gt;  This new rule eliminates some of the legal distinctions between forms of production approval issued by the FAA, which should have the effect of further demonstrating the FAA's support of the quality systems implemented by PMA manufacturers.  Specifically, instead of having a separate body of regulations for a PMA Fabrication Inspection System (FIS),&lt;ref&gt;[http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2009/janqtr/pdf/14cfr21.303.pdf 14 C.F.R. 21.303(h)(2009)]&lt;/ref&gt; as was the case in prior regulations, the PMA regulations now include a cross reference to the 14 C.F.R. § 21.137,&lt;ref&gt;[http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2010/janqtr/pdf/14cfr21.137.pdf 14 C.F.R. 21.137]&lt;/ref&gt; which is the regulation defining the elements of a quality system for all production approval holders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faa.gov/aircraft/air_cert/production_approvals/14cfr_amendments/media/FAA-2006-25877.pdf &lt;u&gt;See&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;Production and Airworthiness Approvals, Part Marking, and Miscellaneous Amendments&lt;/u&gt;, 74 Fed. Reg. 53368, 53377 (October 16, 2009) (describing the elimination of the FIS requirements and the new cross reference to section 21.137)]&lt;/ref&gt;  In practice, all production approval holders were held to the same production quality standards before the rule change&lt;ref&gt;[http://rgl.faa.gov/regulatory_and_guidance_library/rgorders.nsf/0/d1d550bbc2c82dd386257472005724ef/$FILE/Order%208110.42C.pdf &lt;u&gt;Parts Manufacturer Approval Procedures&lt;/u&gt;, FAA Order 8110.42C (June 23, 2008)]&lt;/ref&gt; - this will now be more obvious in the FAA's regulations.  Accomplishing this harmonization of standards was an important goal of the [[Modification and Replacement Parts Association]] ([[MARPA]]).

The new rule became effective April 16, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faa.gov/aircraft/air_cert/production_approvals/14cfr_amendments/media/FAA-2006-25877.pdf &lt;u&gt;See&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;Production and Airworthiness Approvals, Part Marking, and Miscellaneous Amendments&lt;/u&gt;, 74 Fed. Reg. 53368, 53380 (October 16, 2009) (describing the implementation schedule, and setting the implementation date at 18 months after publication in the Federal Register)]&lt;/ref&gt;  The  FAA's FAQ on Part 21 stated that PMA quality systems would be evaluated for compliance by the FAA during certificate management activity after the compliance date of the rule.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faa.gov/aircraft/air_cert/production_approvals/14cfr_amendments/QandA/part21/21G/ &lt;u&gt;FAA Questions &amp; Answers: 14 CFR Part 21 Amendments, Subpart G – Production Certificates&lt;/u&gt;, Section 21.137, Question Four (updated April 27, 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, all FAA production approvals - whether for complete aircraft or for piece parts - rely on a common set of quality assurance system elements.  E.g. 14 C.F.R. §§ 21.137 (quality system requirements for production certificates), 21.307 (requiring PMA holders to establish a quality system that meets the requirements of § 21.137), 21.607 (requiring TSOA holders to establish a quality system that meets the requirements of § 21.137).

== Relationship to repair ==
The FAA is also working on new policies concerning parts fabricated in the course of repair.  This practice has historically been confused with PMA manufacturing, although the two are actually quite different practices supported by different FAA regulations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;rgn=div5&amp;view=text&amp;node=14:1.0.1.3.9&amp;idno=14#14:1.0.1.3.9.1.11.9 Compare 14 C.F.R. 21.9(a)(6)(authority for fabrication in the course of maintenance)] with 14 C.F.R. 21.301 et seq. (PMA regulations)&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, FAA Advisory Circular 43.18 provides guidance for the fabrication of parts to be consumed purely during a maintenance operation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/advisory_circulars/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentID/99860|title=AC 43-18 - Fabrication of Aircraft parts by Maintenance Personnel|publisher=FAA|accessdate=2015-04-02|date=March 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and additional guidance is expected to be released in the near future.  One of the key features of FAC 43.18 is that it recommends implementation of a quality assurance system quite similar to the fabrication inspection systems that PMA manufacturers are required to have.

== Industry association ==
The [[trade association]] representing the PMA industry is the Modification and Replacement Parts Association ([[MARPA]]).  [[MARPA]] works closely with the FAA&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faa.gov/news/conferences_events/2008_eu_us_conference/media/agenda.pdf Agenda for the 2008 FAA-EASA International Safety Conference, in which MARPA's President (Jason Dickstein) is speaking on collaborative efforts to improve supplier control] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920095444/http://www.faa.gov/news/conferences_events/2008_eu_us_conference/media/agenda.pdf |date=2008-09-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.regulations.gov/fdmspublic/ContentViewer?objectId=09000064801df696&amp;disposition=attachment&amp;contentType=pdf 70 Fed. Reg. 65713 (November 9, 2006)(FAA acknowledges the assistance of Jack Buster, MARPA Airworthiness Directive Committee)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520123435/http://www.regulations.gov/fdmspublic/ContentViewer?objectId=09000064801df696&amp;disposition=attachment&amp;contentType=pdf |date=May 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and other agencies to promote PMA safety.  [[MARPA]] maintains a website at [http://www.pmaparts.org http://www.pmaparts.org].

==Developments Outside the United States==
The United States has Bilateral Aviation Safety Agreements (BASA) with most of its major trading partners, and the standard language of these BASAs requires the trading partner to treat FAA-PMA as an importable aircraft part that is airworthy and eligible for installation on aircraft registered in the importing jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.faa.gov/aircraft/air_cert/international/bilateral_agreements/baa_basa_listing/ FAA Bilateral Agreement Listing]&lt;/ref&gt;  This process has been facilitated by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) which has published a book on accepting PMA parts. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/workgroups/Documents/MCTF/PMA-DER-2nd-Edition.pdf ''Guidance Material and Best Practices for Alternate Parts (PMA) and Approved (non-OEM) Repairs (DER). 2nd Edition.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the PMA industry began in the United States, several countries have begun promoting production of approved aircraft parts within their own borders.  These jurisdictions include:
*Australia&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.casa.gov.au/airworthiness/standard-page/production-approvals See, e.g., Australian Government Production Approvals Page]&lt;/ref&gt;
*China&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caac.gov.cn/en/ZCFG/ZCXWJ/HKCX/201602/P020160226590367624634.pdf See, e.g., ''Standardization Procedure for Design Approval of Civil Aircraft and Parts'', AP-21-AA-2012-20 (Nov. 5, 2012) (published by the Civil Aviation Authority of China and describing PMA parts in China)]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The European Union (which produces them as "EPA Parts")&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.easa.europa.eu/faq/20095 See, e.g. ''Why and how must Parts and Appliances be marked, when are the letters EPA required, and which exceptions are acceptable?'', EASA FAQ n.20095 (November 23, 2015)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other jurisdictions have established PMA regulations and are working with trading partners to achieve acceptance of their PMA industries, and thus should be expected to enter the PMA marketplace in the near future.  For example, Japan has PMA regulations and has secured a bilateral agreement with the United States that authorizes the export of these parts to the United States as airworthy aircraft parts.  &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.faa.gov/aircraft/air_cert/international/bilateral_agreements/baa_basa_listing/media/Japan_IPA_Amdt_2.pdf ''Implementation Procedures for Airworthiness Under the Agreement between The Government of the United States of America and The Government of Japan For Promotion of Aviation Safety'', Amendment 2, Chapter 1 (explaining that "This amendment will allow the FAA to accept JCAB Parts Manufacturer Approval (PMA) produced by JCAB Approved Production Organization (APO) ....")]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pathos''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|eɪ|θ|ɒ|s}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|p|eɪ|θ|oʊ|s}}; plural: ''pathea''; {{Lang-el|[[wiktionary:πάθος|πάθος]]}}, for "[[suffering]]" or "[[experience]]"; [[adjective|adjectival]] form: ''pathetic'' from {{lang|el|παθητικός}}) [[appeal to emotion|appeals to the emotions]] of the audience and elicits [[feeling]]s that already reside in them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EMXxhuVU-SYC&amp;pg=PA128&amp;dq=Pathos+emotional+appeal&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tUnbULPeFaeD4gT82YGgBg&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Pathos%20emotional%20appeal&amp;f=false |title=Strategic Business Communication: For Leaders |author=Robyn Walker |publisher=Google Books |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pathos is a communication technique used most often in [[rhetoric]] (in which it is considered one of the three [[modes of persuasion]], alongside [[ethos]] and [[logos]]), as well as in literature, film, and other narrative art.

[[Emotion]]al appeal can be accomplished in many ways, such as the following:
* by a [[metaphor]] or [[storytelling]], commonly known as a [[hook (rhetoric)|hook]];
* by [[passion (emotion)|passion]] in the delivery of the speech or writing, as determined by the audience; and
* by personal [[anecdote]].

==Aristotle’s text on pathos==
In ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]'', [[Aristotle]] identifies three artistic modes of persuasion, one of which is "awakening emotion (pathos) in the audience so as to induce them to make the judgment desired."&lt;ref name=CivDis&gt;Aristotle, and George Alexander Kennedy. ''Aristotle On Rhetoric: A Theory of Civic Discourse''. New York: Oxford UP, 1991. Print. p.119&lt;/ref&gt; In the first chapter, he includes the way in which "men change their opinion in regard to their judgment. As such, emotions have specific causes and effects" (Book 2.1.2–3).&lt;ref name=CivDis/&gt; Aristotle identifies pathos as one of the three essential modes of proof by his statement that "to understand the emotions—that is, to name them and describe them, to know their causes and the way in which they are excited (1356a24–1356a25).&lt;ref name=CivDis/&gt; Aristotle posits that, alongside pathos, the speaker must also deploy good [[ethos]] in order to establish credibility (Book 2.1.5–9).&lt;ref name=CivDis/&gt;

Aristotle details what individual emotions are useful to a speaker (Book 2.2.27).&lt;ref name=CivDis/&gt; In doing so, Aristotle focused on whom, toward whom, and why, stating that "[i]t is not enough to know one or even two of these points; unless we know all three, we shall be unable to arouse anger in anyone. The same is true of the other emotions." He also arranges the emotions with one another so that they may counteract one another. For example, one would pair sadness with happiness (Book 2.1.9).&lt;ref name=CivDis/&gt;

With this understanding, Aristotle argues for the [[rhetor]] to understand the entire situation of goals and audiences to decide which specific emotion the speaker would exhibit or call upon in order to persuade the audience. Aristotle’s theory of pathos has three main foci: the frame of mind the audience is in, the variation of emotion between people, and the influence the rhetor has on the emotions of the audience. Aristotle classifies the third of this trio as the ultimate goal of pathos.&lt;ref name="On Rhetoric"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aristotle|last2=Bizzell|first2=Patricia|last3=Herzberg|first3=Bruce|title=On Rhetoric|date=2001|publisher=Bedford/ St. Martin's|location=New York|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Aristotle outlines the individual importance of persuasive emotions, as well as the combined effectiveness of these emotions on the audience. Moreover, Aristotle pointedly discusses pleasure and pain in relation to the reactions these two emotions cause in an audience member.&lt;ref name="On Rhetoric"/&gt; According to Aristotle, emotions vary from person to person. Therefore, he stresses the importance of understanding specific social situations in order to successfully utilize pathos as a mode of persuasion.&lt;ref name="On Rhetoric"/&gt;

Aristotle identifies the introduction and the conclusion as the two most important places for an emotional appeal in any persuasive argument.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Irving|title=Some Conceptions on Emotional Appeal in Rhetorical Theory|journal=Speech Monographs|year=1939|volume=6|issue=1|pages=66–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pathos in politics ===
Pathos has its hand in politics as well, primarily in speech and how to persuade the audience. Mshvenieradze states that "Pathos is directly linked with an audience. Audience is a collective subject of speakers on which an orator tries to impact by own argumentation." &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://go.galegroup.com.db19.linccweb.org/ps/i.do?p=AONE&amp;sw=w&amp;u=lincclin_pbcc&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;id=GALE%7CA353321541&amp;asid=9d2bc550dad3214ec473c84fe078fe62.&amp;authCount=1|title=LINCCWeb Catalog Search|website=go.galegroup.com.db19.linccweb.org|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly to how Aristotle discusses how to effectively utilize pathos in rhetoric, the way in which one appeals to the reader is similar in appealing to an audience of voters. In the case of politics and politicians, it is primarily more in argumentative writing and speaking. In Book II of Aristotle's writing's in ''Rhetoric,'' in essence knowing people's emotions helps to enable one to act with words versus writing alone, to earn another's credibility and faith.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As Aristotle's teachings expanded, many other groups of thinkers would go on to adopt different variations of political usage with the elements of pathos involved, which includes groups such as the Epicureans and Stoics.

==Alternative views on pathos==
Scholars have discussed the different interpretations of Aristotle’s views of [[rhetoric]] and his philosophy. Some believe that it is actually a myth, that Aristotle invented it entirely.{{clarify|date=May 2016}} In the second chapter of ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]'', Aristotle's view on pathos changes from the use in discourse to the understanding of emotions and their effects. William Fortenbaugh pointed out that for the [[Sophist]] [[Gorgias]], "Being overcome with emotion is analogous to rape."&lt;ref name=ArisRhetEmo&gt;Fortenbaugh, ''W. W. Aristotle's Rhetoric on Emotions''. Metuchen, NJ: Scarecrow, 1974. Print. p.232.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle opposed this view and created a systematic approach to pathos. Fortenbaugh argues that Aristotle's systematic approach to emotional appeals "depends upon correctly understanding the nature of individual emotions, upon knowing the conditions favorable to, the objects of, and the grounds for individual emotions".&lt;ref name=ArisRhetEmo/&gt;

Modern philosophers were typically more skeptical of the use of emotions in communication, with political theorists such as [[John Locke]] hoping to extract emotion from reasoned communication entirely. [[George Campbell (minister)|George Campbell]] presents another view unlike the common systematic approach of Aristotle. Campbell explored whether appeals to emotion or passions would be "an unfair method of persuasion," identifying seven circumstances to judge emotions: probability, plausibility, importance, proximity in time, connection of place, relations to the persons concerned, and interest in the consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, George, and Lloyd F. Bitzer. ''The Philosophy of Rhetoric''. Carbondale: Southern Illinois UP, 1963. Print.p.81-89.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 84 BC ''[[Rhetorica ad Herennium]]'' book of an unknown author theorizes that the conclusion is the most important place in a persuasive argument to consider emotions such as mercy or hatred, depending on the nature of the persuasion.&lt;ref name="Rhetorica ad Herennium"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anonymous|last2=Bizzell|first2=Patricia|last3=Herzberg|first3=Bruce|title=Rhetorica ad Herennium|date=2001|publisher=Bedford/ St.Martins}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "appeal to pity", as it is classified in ''Rhetorica ad Herennium'', is a means to conclude by reiterating the major premise of the work and tying while incorporating an emotional sentiment. The author suggests ways in which to appeal to the pity of the audience: "We shall stir pity in our hearers by recalling vicissitudes of future; by comparing the prosperity we once enjoyed with our present adversity; by entreating those whose pity we seek to win, and by submitting ourselves to their mercy."&lt;ref name="Rhetorica ad Herennium"/&gt; Additionally, the text impresses the importance of invoking kindness, humanity and sympathy upon the hearer. Finally, the author suggests that the appeal to pity be brief for "nothing dries more quickly than a tear."&lt;ref name="Rhetorica ad Herennium"/&gt;

=== Other Hellenistic Groups ===
Aristotle's teachings would go on to influence many influential groups of thinkers. One such group of thinkers, the Epicureans who practiced Epicureanism, interpreted and placed pathos in much more colloquial means and situations. The group would place pathos in pleasure, and study it in almost every facet in regards to pleasure, analyzing emotional specificity that an individual may feel or may need to undergo to appreciate said pathos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Warren|first=James|title=Epicureans and Cyrenaics on pleasure as a pathos|url=https://www.academia.edu/4695271/Epicureans_and_Cyrenaics_on_pleasure_as_a_pathos|journal=forthcoming in S. Marchand and F. Verde eds. Épicurisme et scepticisme, Rome: Sapienza Università Editrice: 127–44|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pathos before Aristotle==

The concept of emotional appeal existed in rhetoric long before Aristotle’s ''Rhetoric''. [[George A. Kennedy (classicist)|George A. Kennedy]], a well-respected, modern-day scholar, identifies the appeal to emotions in the newly formed democratic court system before 400 BC in his book, ''The Art of Persuasion in Greece''.&lt;ref name="The Art of Persuasion in Greece"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kennedy|first1=George|title=The Art of Persuasion in Greece|date=1963|publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gorgias]], a Sophist who preceded Aristotle, was interested in the orator’s emotional appeal as well. Gorgias believed the orator was able to capture and lead the audience in any direction they pleased through the use of emotional appeal.&lt;ref name="The Art of Persuasion in Greece"/&gt; In the ''Encomium of Helen'', Gorgias states that a soul can feel a particular sentiment on account of words such as sorrow and pity. Certain words act as "bringers-on of pleasure and takers-off of pain.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gorgias|last2=Bizzell|first2=Patricia|last3=Bruce|first3=Herzberg|title=The Rhetorical Tradition (Second Edition). Encomium of Helen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Gorgias equates emotional persuasion to the sensation of being overtaken by a drug: "[f]or just as different drug draw off different humors from the body, and some put an end to disease and other to life, so too of discourses: some give pain, others delight, others terrify, others rouse the hearers to courage, and yet others by a certain vile persuasion drug and trick to soul."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

[[Plato]] also discussed emotional appeal in rhetoric. Plato preceded Aristotle and therefore laid the groundwork, as did other Sophists, for Aristotle to theorize the concept of pathos. In his dialogue ''[[Gorgias (dialogue)|Gorgias]]'', Plato discusses pleasure versus pain in the realm of pathos though in a fictional conversation between Gorgias and Socrates. The dialogue between several ancient rhetors that Plato created centers around the value of rhetoric, and the men incorporate aspects of pathos in their responses. Gorgias discredits pathos and instead promotes the use of [[ethos]] in persuasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Plato|last2=Bizzell|first2=Patricia|last3=Herzberg|first3=Bruce|title=The Rhetorical Tradition Second Edition). Gorgias|publisher=Bedford/ St. Martin's}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another of Plato’s texts, ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'', his discussion of emotions is more pointed; however, he still does not outline exactly how emotions manipulate an audience.&lt;ref name="Bedford/ St. Martin's"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Plato|last2=Bizzell|first2=Patricia|last3=Herzberg|first3=Bruce|title=The Rhetorical Tradition (Second Edition). Phaedrus|date=2001|publisher=Bedford/ St. Martin's|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plato discusses the danger of emotions in oratory. He argues that emotional appeal in rhetoric should be used as the means to an end and not the point of the discussion.&lt;ref name="Bedford/ St. Martin's"/&gt;

==Contemporary pathos==
[[George Campbell (minister)|George Campbell]], a contributor to the Scottish Enlightenment, was one of the first rhetoricians to incorporate scientific evidence into his theory of emotional appeal.&lt;ref name="American Book Co"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gardiner|first1=Norman|title=Feeling and Emotion: A History of Theories|date=1937|publisher=American Book Co.|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell relied heavily on a book written by physician [[David Hartley (philosopher)|David Hartley]], entitled ''[[Observations on Man]]''. The book synthesized emotions and neurology and introduced the concept that action is a result of impression. Hartley determined that emotions drive people to react to appeals based on circumstance but also passions made up of cognitive impulses.&lt;ref name="American Book Co"/&gt; Campbell argues that belief and persuasion depend heavily on the force of an emotional appeal.&lt;ref name="SIU Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Golden|first1=James|last2=Corbett|first2=Edward|title=The Rhetoric of Blair, Campbell, and Whately|date=1990|publisher=SIU Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Campbell introduced the importance of the audience’s imagination and will on emotional persuasion that is equally as important as basic understanding of an argument.&lt;ref name="SIU Press"/&gt; Campbell, by drawing on the theories of rhetoricians before him, drew up a contemporary view of pathos that incorporates the psychological aspect of emotional appeal.

An orator’s reliance on emotional appeal is evident in modern-day speechmaking, but in some schools of thought this is seen primarily as psychological versus emotional appeal.&lt;ref name="American Book Co"/&gt;{{clarify|date=May 2016}}

=== Speech ===
Speech is one of the primary places where one sees the application of pathos. Pathos is in essence the driving force behind an argument, to hit the emotional pangs that allow the audience to relate to the speaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://go.galegroup.com.db19.linccweb.org/ps/i.do?p=AONE&amp;sw=w&amp;u=lincclin_pbcc&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;id=GALE%7CA503310627&amp;asid=c070d952c2a30962a72ca6167914c0f4|title=LINCCWeb Catalog Search|website=go.galegroup.com.db19.linccweb.org|access-date=2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Film ===
Any emotional response from the audience correlates to pathos used by the director. Pathos can also be utilized for manipulation and propaganda purposes and is very prevalent within the film industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theoriebuero.org/2089/defending-pathos-in-film-eisenstein/|title=Defending Pathos In Film {{!}} Theoriebüro - Zur Förderung kritischer Gesellschaftstheorie und emanzipatorischer Praxis|website=theoriebuero.org|language=de-DE|access-date=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Plane wave expansion method''' (PWE) refers to a computational technique in [[electromagnetics]] to solve the [[Maxwell's equations]] by formulating an [[eigenvalue]] problem out of the equation. This method is popular among the [[photonic crystal]] community as a method of solving for the [[band structure]] (dispersion relation) of specific photonic crystal geometries. PWE is traceable to the analytical formulations, and is useful in calculating modal solutions of  Maxwell's equations over an inhomogeneous or periodic geometry. It is specifically tuned to solve problems in a time-harmonic forms, with [[Dispersion (optics)|non-dispersive]] media.

==Principles==
{{Dubious|date=August 2009}}

[[Plane wave]]s are solutions to the homogeneous [[Helmholtz equation]], and form a basis to represent fields in the periodic media. PWE as applied to photonic crystals as described is primarily sourced 
from Dr. Danner's tutorial.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ece.nus.edu.sg/stfpage/eleadj/planewave.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The electric or magnetic fields are expanded for each field component in terms of the [[Fourier series]] components along the reciprocal lattice vector. Similarly, the dielectric permittivity (which is periodic along reciprocal lattice vector for photonic crystals) is also expanded through Fourier series components. 

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{\epsilon_r} = \sum_{m=-\infty}^{+\infty} K_m^{\epsilon_r} e^{-i \vec{G}.\vec{r}}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
E(\omega,\vec{r}) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{+\infty} K_n^{E_y} e^{-i\vec{G}.\vec{r}} e^{-i\vec{k}\vec{r}}
&lt;/math&gt;

with the Fourier series coefficients being the K numbers subscripted by m, n respectively, and the reciprocal lattice [[Vector (mathematics and physics)|vector]] given by &lt;math&gt;\vec{G}&lt;/math&gt;. In real modeling, the range of components considered will be reduced to just &lt;math&gt;\pm Nmax&lt;/math&gt; instead of the ideal, infinite wave.

Using these expansions in any of the curl-curl relations like,
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{\epsilon(\vec{r})} \nabla \times \nabla \times E(\vec{r},\omega) = \left( \frac{\omega}{c} \right)^2 E(\vec{r},\omega)
&lt;/math&gt;

and simplifying under assumptions of a source free, linear, and non-dispersive region we obtain the [[eigen value]]  relations which can be solved.

==Example for 1D case==
For a y-polarized z-propagating electric wave, incident on a 1D-DBR periodic in only z-direction and homogeneous along x,y, with a lattice period of a. We then have the following simplified relations:

[[Image:Photonic Crystal 1D DBR aircore epsr12point25 DbyA0point8.png|thumb|right|Band structure of a 1D Photonic Crystal, DBR air-core calculated using plane wave expansion technique with 101 planewaves, for d/a=0.8, and dielectric contrast of 12.250.]]

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{\epsilon_r} = \sum_{m=-\infty}^{+\infty} K_m^{\epsilon_r} e^{-i \frac{2\pi m}{a}z}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
E(\omega,\vec{r}) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{+\infty} K_n^{E_y} e^{-i\frac{2\pi n}{a}z} e^{-i\vec{k}\vec{r}}
&lt;/math&gt;

The constitutive eigen equation we finally have to solve becomes,
:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_n{\left( \frac{2\pi n}{a} + k_z \right)\left( \frac{2\pi m}{a} + k_z \right) K_{m-n}^{\epsilon_r} K_{n}^{E_y}} = \frac{\omega^2}{c^2}K_{m}^{E_y}
&lt;/math&gt;

This can be solved by building a matrix for the terms in the left hand side, and finding its eigen value and vectors. The eigen values correspond to the modal solutions, while the corresponding magnetic or electric fields themselves can be plotted using the Fourier expansions. The [[coefficients]] of the field harmonics are obtained from the specific eigen vectors.

The resulting band-structure obtained through the eigen modes of this structure are shown to the right.

===Example code===
We can use the following code in [[Matlab]] or [[GNU Octave]] to compute the same band structure,

==Advantages==
PWE expansions are rigorous solutions. PWE is extremely well suited to the modal solution problem. Large size problems can be solved using iterative techniques like [[Conjugate gradient method]].
For both generalized and normal eigen value problems, just a few band-index plots in the band-structure diagrams are required, usually lying on the [[brillouin zone edges]]. This corresponds to eigen modes solutions using iterative techniques, as opposed to diagonalization of the entire matrix.

The PWEM is highly efficient for calculating modes in periodic dielectric structures.  Being a Fourier space method, it suffers from the [[Gibbs phenomenon]] and slow convergence in some configuration when fast Fourier factorization is not used.  It is the method of choice for calculating the band structure of photonic crystals.  It is not easy to understand at first, but it is easy to implement.

==Disadvantages==
{{Dubious|date=August 2009}}
Sometimes spurious modes appear. Large problems scaled as ''O(n&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)'', with the number of the plane waves (n) used in the problem. This is both time consuming and complex in memory requirements.

Alternatives include Order-N spectral method, and methods using [[Finite-difference time-domain]] (FDTD) which are simpler, and model transients.

If implemented correctly, spurious solutions are avoided.  It is less efficient when index contrast is high or when metals are incorporated.  It cannot be used for scattering analysis.

Being a Fourier-space method, Gibbs phenomenon affects the method's accuracy.  This is particularly problematic for devices with high dielectric contrast.

Adherents of remodernism advocate it as a forward and radical, not reactionary, impetus.&lt;ref name=lewis/&gt;&lt;ref name=medina/&gt;

In 2000, [[Billy Childish]] and [[Charles Thomson (artist)|Charles Thomson]], founders of the [[stuckism]] art movement instigated remodernism,&lt;ref name=packer/&gt; with a manifesto, ''Remodernism'' in an attempt to introduce a period of new spirituality into art, culture and society to replace postmodernism, which they said was cynical and spiritually bankrupt. In 2002, a remodernism art show in [[Albuquerque]] was accompanied by an essay from [[University of California, Berkeley]] art professor, Kevin Radley, who said there was a renewal of artists working without the limitation of irony and cynicism, and that there was a renewal of the sense of beauty.

In 2006, the [[Stedelijk Museum]] and the [[University of Amsterdam]] held a talk on remodernism with Daniel Birnbaum and Alison Gingeras; the introduction to this talked of the revival of painting as a possible return to traditional modernist values, such as [[Authenticity in art|authenticity]], self-expression and autonomy, as opposed to multimedia practice.
&lt;ref name=amsterdam/&gt; In 2008, London ''[[Evening Standard]]'' critic, Ben Lewis, applied the term to three [[Turner Prize]] nominees and saw them amongst a movement which was reviving the formalism of the early 20th century; he advocated values of an aesthetic informed by modesty, generosity and genuine emotion.&lt;ref name=lewis-turner/&gt;

The text from different editions is the same: "Childish and his co-founder, Charles Thomson, ushered in remodernism, 'a period of art . . . to reclaim the vision and spiritual values of the early Modernists and replace the ennui of Post-Modernism'."&lt;/ref&gt; Their ''Remodernism'' manifesto was published on March 1, 2000 to promote vision, authenticity and self-expression, with an emphasis on painting, and subtitled "towards a new spirituality in art." Its premise is that the potential of the [[Modernism|modernist]] vision has not been fulfilled, that its development has been in the wrong direction and that this vision needs to be reclaimed, redefined and redeveloped. It advocates the search for truth, knowledge and meaning, and challenges [[formalism (art)|formalism]].

|colspan="2"|&lt;small&gt;In 1999, Childish and Thomson wrote a remodernism manifesto, calling for a period of new spirituality in art, culture and society to replace [[postmodernism]].&lt;/small&gt;
|}

It has a short introduction, summing up: "Modernism has progressively lost its way, until finally toppling into the bottomless pit of Postmodern balderdash." This is followed by 14 numbered points, stressing bravery, individuality, inclusiveness, communication, humanity and the perennial against nihilism, scientific materialism and the "brainless destruction of convention." Point 7 states:
{{quote|Spirituality is the journey of the soul on earth. Its first principle is a declaration of intent to face the truth. Truth is what it is, regardless of what we want it to be. Being a spiritual artist means addressing unflinchingly our projections, good and bad, the attractive and the grotesque, our strengths as well as our delusions, in order to know ourselves and thereby our true relationship with others and our connection to the divine.}}
Point 9 states: "Spiritual art is not religion. Spirituality is humanity's quest to understand itself and finds its symbology through the clarity and integrity of its artists." Point 12 links its use of the word "God" to enthusiasm&amp;mdash;from the Greek root ''en theos'' (to be possessed by God).

The summary at the end starts, "It is quite clear to anyone of an uncluttered mental disposition that what is now put forward, quite seriously, as art by the ruling elite, is proof that a seemingly rational development of a body of ideas has gone seriously awry," and finds the solution is a spiritual renaissance because "there is nowhere else for art to go. Stuckism's mandate is to initiate that spiritual renaissance now."&lt;ref&gt;Childish, Billy, and Thomson, Charles. [http://www.stuckism.com/remod.html "Remodernism"], stuckism.com, March 1, 2000.

Childish and Thomson sent their remodernism manifesto to [[Nicholas Serota|Sir Nicholas Serota]], Director of the [[Tate Gallery]], who replied, "You will not be surprised to learn that I have no comment to make on your letter, or your manifesto ''Remodernism''."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20021221052217/http://www.hatii.arts.gla.ac.uk/MultimediaStudentProjects/00-01/9704524l/MM%20Project/Html/stuck2.htm "Stuck on the Turner Prize: Send in the clowns"], [[University of Glasgow]].

In March 2000 the [[Stuckism|Stuckists]] declared themselves to be the first remodernist art group at a show ''The Resignation of Sir Nicholas Serota''. In April, remodernism was quoted in ''The Gulf News'' ([[UAE]]).&lt;ref&gt;Lethbridge, Lucy (2000)[&lt;!--http://www.gulf-news.co.ae/18042000/FRIDAY/fri6.htm DEAD LINK REPLACED WITH INTERNET ARCHIVE CACHE --&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20010222155937/http://www.gulf-news.co.ae/18042000/FRIDAY/fri6.htm "Letter from London"] ''The Gulf News'', May 14, 2000.

Accessed April 29, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In June, Thomson and Childish gave a talk on stuckism and remodernism at the Salon des Arts, Kensington, promoted by the [[Institute of Ideas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/Vine1/Salon.html "Stella Vine meets (and joins) the Stuckists"] stuckism.com.

In 2001, Thomson stood in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|UK general election]], stating, "The Stuckist Party aims to bring the ideas of Stuckism and Remodernism into the political arena."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/e01/man/StuckManifesto2.pdf "The Stuckist Party: Manifesto 2001"] pdf accessed from Keele University website, April 29, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The show curator, Yoshimi Hayashi, said:
{{quote|ReMo incorporates ideas from Modernism, Avantegardism, and Post Modernism; thus synthesizing an alternative and real time contemporary approach to art. In ReMo, issues such as multiculturalism, irony, the sublime, and identity are considered; however, they do not become the art itself. The reconsideration and redefinition of the traditions are sought not by mere deconstructionism, but rather by connecting new nodes of ideas. Therefore, by definition, ReMo is fundamentally cellular and its roots stem from provincial art settings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20020207064328/http://www.magnifico.org/exh_pgm/ReMo_2002.html "Magnífico presents ReMo"], Magnifico, 2002.

Stuckist artist [[Bill Lewis]], interviewed by the [[BBC]] at the 2004 [[Liverpool Biennial]], said that remodernism was "not a movement as such,"&lt;ref name=lewis/&gt; but a return to the start of modernism in order to move forward with an art for a new paradigm.&lt;ref name=lewis/&gt; To "remodernise" is to go "back to the root again, starting with painting ... and see where it goes."&lt;ref name=lewis/&gt; He said that this had been called reactionary, but it was radical "in the true sense of the word."&lt;ref name=lewis&gt;[[Bill Lewis|Lewis, Bill]].

In August 2006, an online group called "The Remodernists of Deviantart" was founded by Clay Martin. The group is composed of artists who are active on the website deviantart.com. 

In 2006, artist Matt Bray said, "I do not wish to be considered a Stuckist, as I find some of there (sic) antics unnecessary. The Stuckists are however the first and most famous Remodernist group, so for that, and for bringing this particular manifesto to my attention; I thank them."&lt;ref&gt;Bray, Matt (2006)[http://www.artnowuk.com/ "Art Portal: Matt Bray 2006"] artnow.uk.com.

{{quote|Remodernism in general embraces the bravery of the amateur, so craft is a strange thing to think about. Craft is usually about something striving for perfection, without flaws, to be "professional". I don't like that. However if you consider craft something that can be developed and grown, I like that. I like the idea of filmmakers teaching themselves to paint pictures, to try acting in their own movies and those of others (especially if they are shy), to be nude models for other artists, to meditate, worship if they are religious, to do things that affect their levels of consciousness, try things that make them nervous or uncomfortable, to go out and be involved in life, to find adventure, to jump in the ocean. I think that is the exploration of craft.&lt;ref name=MungBeing&gt;[http://www.mungbeing.com/issue_28.html?page=32&amp;sub_id=1565#1565 "Remodernist Film", MungBeing, October 4, 2009] Retrieved October 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38809">'''Senior dog food diets''' are [[pet food]]s that are catered toward the senior or mature pet population. The senior [[dog]] population consists of dogs that are over the age of seven for most dog breeds,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; though in general large and giant breed dogs tend to reach this life stage earlier when compared to smaller breed dogs who are considered senior at a much later age. Senior dog foods contain nutrients and characteristics that are used to improve the health of the aging dog. [[Aging in dogs]] causes many changes to occur physiologically that will require a change in nutrient composition of their diet.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laflamme|first=Dorthy|date=May 2005|title=Nutrition for Aging Cats and Dogs and the Importance of Body Condition|url=https://ac-els-cdn-com.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/S0195561604001871/1-s2.0-S0195561604001871-main.pdf?_tid=d0e74ada-ba60-11e7-9d4f-00000aacb35f&amp;acdnat=1509031244_1d1d81a201707fe80bac30e75e283d30|journal=Veterinary Clinics of North America: Small Animal Practice|volume=35|pages=713–742|via=Elsevier Science Direct}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major change that occurs is the decrease in energy requirements&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which is addressed by lowered caloric content of senior pet foods. Although energy requirements decrease, protein requirements increase as the dog ages. Senior dog foods include a higher [[protein]] content as well as highly digestible protein sources to deal with this. Nutrients included for joint and bone health include [[glucosamine]], [[chondroitin]], [[Omega-3 fatty acid|omega-3]] fatty acids as well as two main minerals; [[calcium]] and [[phosphorus]]. Sources of [[fiber]] included in senior dog foods include [[beet pulp]] and [[flax seed]] as well as [[fructooligosaccharide]]s (FOS) and mannanoligosaccharides (MOS). These act to increase gastrointestinal health. Brain and cognitive health decline as the dog ages which leads to the inclusion of [[vitamin E]] and [[L-carnitine]] in senior dog diets to combat this decline. Skin and coat health can also decline in older dogs due to various reasons.&lt;ref name=":92"/&gt; The inclusion of [[linoleic acid]] as well as [[vitamin A]] into senior dog diets helps to improve or maintain the skin and coat of senior dogs. Immune system health is important to maintain in older dogs to prevent the development of various diseases. By including omega-3 and [[Omega-6 fatty acid|omega-6]] fatty acids, vitamin E, [[Beta-Carotene|β-carotene]] as well as [[Prebiotic (nutrition)|pre]]- and [[Probiotic|pro-biotics]], the immune system can be boosted and maintained to help improve overall health. &lt;nowiki/&gt;

== Energy demand ==
The maintenance energy requirement (MER), or the energy that is required to maintain normal activity, decreases significantly as a result of [[lean body mass]] loss in aging dogs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The MER can decrease by up to 25% as dogs age due to this loss.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cliniciansbrief.com/sites/default/files/attachments/Nutrition%20for%20Senior%20Dogs.pdf|title=Nutrition for senior dogs: New tricks for feeding old dogs|last=Churchill|first=Julia A.|date=2015|website=Clinician's Brief|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Basal metabolic rate is maintained by lean mass energy expenditure, which accounts for 96% of the function of lean mass.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; The [[metabolizable energy]], or the amount of available energy which is left after the losses in urine, feces and combustible gas is subtracted, can be found on the food bag or calculated using the modified Atwater equation:

ME (kcal/kg) = 10[(3.5 x Crude Protein) + (8.5 x Crude Fiber) + (3.5 x Nitrogen Free Extract)]

This equation takes into consideration the amount of energy availability from [[crude protein]], crude [[fiber]], and the nitrogen free extract from pet foods in order to calculate the amount of energy the animal is receiving from the food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hall J.A., Melendez L.D. and Jewell D.E.|first=|date=2013|title=Using gross energy improves metabolizable energy predictive equations for pet foods whereas undigested protein and fiber content predict stool quality|url=|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=8|pages=1–8|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to consider the metabolizable energy content of senior or mature pet foods using this equation, as energy requirements will vary with age.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?c=1+2244&amp;aid=2842|title=Metabolizable energy and caloric density|last=|first=|date=|website=Pet education|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Protein ==
{{Main|Protein (nutrient)}}
A dog's requirements for protein increases as a result of a reduced ability to synthesize proteins as it ages.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;  As a result, it is extremely important to not restrict protein consumption to a senior dog as it can be as just as harmful as protein deficiency in young dogs.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; To ensure good health, it is important to provide dogs with the 22 amino acids which they require. Of these 22 amino acids, 12 can be synthesized. The rest must be provided by good sources of dietary protein in adequate quantities. Good sources of protein include eggs and fish, which have a high biological value. This value describes the percentage of usable amino acids within the protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://happydogfood.com/blogs/news/dietary-protein-for-dogs-and-cats-the-importance-of-digestible-proteins|title=Dietary protein for dogs and cats - the importance of digestible proteins|last=|first=|date=November 8, 2016|website=Happy Dog Food|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been recommended that a minimum of 2.55 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight should be fed daily to ensure that protein requirements are met.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; It is important to understand that protein requirements based on weight are variable and that many factors influence the protein requirements of each senior dog.

== Bone and joint health ==

Joint deterioration occurs as dogs age. As their joints become less lubricated there is increased friction between the [[bone]] and the [[cartilage]]. With this increased friction, the cartilage deteriorates and wears away. The reduction of this cushion in the joints causes bone-on-bone contact to occur, causing the animal great discomfort. This can cause various related issues such as altered gaits and changes in activity levels resulting in a greater possibility of obesity and other conditions related to mobility and activity levels.

It is important to note the effects of these supplements is not instant and the aforementioned studies showed approximately a 3-month period between the beginning of supplementation and the reduction of symptoms.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arthritis.org/living-with-arthritis/treatments/natural/supplements-herbs/glucosamine-chondroitin-osteoarthritis.php|title=Glucosamine and Chrondroitin for Arthritis|website=www.arthritis.org|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Glucosamine ===
{{Main|Glucosamine}}
Glucosamine is a building block for the synthesis of cartilage tissue.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.purina.com/dogs/dog-articles/understanding-dog-food/what-is-chicken-meal-in-dog-food|title=What is Chicken Meal in Dog Food? - Purina® {{!}} Purina|website=www.purina.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is found naturally in the body, mainly in the [[Synovial fluid|fluid which surrounds the joints]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This can help aging joints by maintaining the cartilage, thus reducing the pain caused by bone-on-bone contact within the joint (this is the primary source of joint pain in aging animals). This will increase the mobility of the dog which is vital for the maintenance of a healthy weight and general body function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vet-organics.com/blogs/news/pet-joint-care-part-two|title=What You Need To Know About Pet Joint Care: Part Two|work=Vet Organics|access-date=2018-09-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been some studies which have showed [[anti-inflammatory]] properties of glucosamine which would also help joint function in aging dogs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Glucosamine is usually provided in supplements in the form of glucosamine sulfate, or by the inclusion of chicken meal in the diet, as it contains glucosamine as well as chondroitin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nutro.ca/en/natural-dog-food/nutro/dry/large-breed-senior-chicken-whole-brown-rice-oatmeal-recipe.aspx|title=NUTRO™ WHOLESOME ESSENTIALS™  Large Breed Senior Farm-Raised Chicken, Brown Rice &amp; Sweet Potato Recipe|last=Nutro|website=www.nutro.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Chondroitin ===
{{Main|Chondroitin sulfate}}
Chondroitin is a major component in the composition of [[cartilage]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It helps the cartilage retain moisture, lubricating the joint and allowing ease of movement of the bone across the cartilage.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This reduces the damage to the cartilage over time. Chondroitin is produced naturally in the body but older dogs can often benefit from a supplemental dose of chondroitin.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Chondroitin is commonly supplied as a supplement in the form of [[chondroitin sulfate]].

=== Omega-3 fatty acids ===
{{Main|Omega-3 fatty acid}}
Omega-3 fatty acids include docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). These two fatty acids have been shown to improve gait score and lameness in dogs with [[osteoarthritis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roush|first=James K.|last2=Cross|first2=Alan R.|last3=Renberg|first3=Walter C.|last4=Dodd|first4=Chadwick E.|last5=Sixby|first5=Kristin A.|last6=Fritsch|first6=Dale A.|last7=Allen|first7=Timothy A.|last8=Jewell|first8=Dennis E.|last9=Richardson|first9=Daniel C.|title=Evaluation of the effects of dietary supplementation with fish oil omega-3 fatty acids on weight bearing in dogs with osteoarthritis|journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association|language=en|volume=236|issue=1|pages=67–73|doi=10.2460/javma.236.1.67|pmid=20043801|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Omega-3 fatty acid]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s have also been shown to have noticeable anti-inflammatory properties.

=== Calcium and phosphorus ===
{{Main|Calcium in biology}}	
{{Main|Phosphorus#Biological role}}
One of the most basic requirements of the aging dog’s body is the requirement for maintenance of their bones. In order for the bones to be able to heal from any injury or erosion, as well as maintain their strength to avoid these problem, they need a ready supply of calcium and phosphorus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/calcium-supplements|title=Calcium Supplements|website=vca_corporate|language=en|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these are essential nutrients according to AAFCO guidelines, and should be included in a senior dog diet.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aafco.org/|title=The Association of American Feed Control Officials &gt; Home|website=www.aafco.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Calcium]] and [[Phosphorus]] are also very valuable in the maintenance tooth health of dogs. In order for calcium to be properly absorbed into the body dogs will require another nutrient, [[vitamin D]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parfitt|first=A. M.|last2=Gallagher|first2=J.

== Gastrointestinal health ==

=== Sources of Fiber ===

[[File:Sugar beet cossettes.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A bowl of sugar beet cossettes.|Beet pulp is a good source of insoluble fiber.]]

==== Beet pulp ====

==== Flax seed ====
{{Main|Flax#Nutrition}}
Flax seed is the whole seed of the flax plant which contains both soluble and insoluble fiber.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.skaervet.com/documents/Common%20Pet%20Food%20Ingredients.pdf|title=Common Pet Food Ingredients|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The insoluble fraction includes [[cellulose]], [[hemicellulose]], and [[lignin]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; These components have a very good water binding capacity which aids in adding bulk into the diet of the dog.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This has varying benefits for dogs depending on their lifestyle. In some dogs, it aids in digestion by preventing [[constipation]], in others it acts to improve [[satiety]] and encourage weight loss.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adolphe|first=Jennifer|last2=Fitzpatrick|first2=Kelley|title=FLAXSEED: Nutrition Benefits for Dogs and Cats|url=https://flaxcouncil.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/FlaxFeed-Nutrition-Benefits-final.pdf|journal=Flax Council of Canada|volume=2|pages=1–4|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flaxseed is also a good source of [[Omega-3 fatty acid|omega-3]] and [[Omega-6 fatty acid|omega-6]] fatty acids which have multiple health benefits for the animal such as improving coat quality.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Flax seed is also one of the richest sources of alpha [[linoleic acid]] (ALA).&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; ALA can be converted by the dog to [[Docosahexaenoic acid|DHA]] and [[Eicosapentaenoic acid|EPA]] to carry out various functions in the body.

===  Fructooligosaccharides and mannanoligosaccharides ===
{{Main|Fructooligosaccharide}}
{{Main|Mannan oligosaccharide-based nutritional supplements}}
[[Fructooligosaccharide]]s, commonly known as FOS, consist of many different types of indigestible [[oligosaccharide]]s.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swanson, K.S., Grieshop, C.M., Flickinger, E.A., Bauer, L.L., Healy, HP., Dawson K.A., Merchen N.R. and Fahey G.G.

Constipation prevention and treatment can be carried out by the supplementation of FOS by its subsequent effect on gut bacteria.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; MOS works in a different manner by effecting the attachment of bad bacteria in the gut of the dog.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; These bad bacteria attach to the [[epithelial lining]] of the gastrointestinal tract and can cause the beginnings of [[pathogenic disease]]s.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; MOS works to counteract these by preventing the binding of these deleterious bacteria.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

A study carried out in dogs determined that these two compounds when supplemented together can help with overall immune function.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; This is due to the decrease in overall bad bacteria and an increase in good bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract. These two compounds also were not found to have any detrimental effects on food consumption, stool quality or stool output.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

== Brain and cognitive health ==
A dogs brain undergoes many pathological changes during the aging process. Some of these changes can include damage to the [[DNA]] (deoxyribonucleic acid), a decrease in the amount of [[myelin]] overlay on nerve cells as well as a buildup of [[protein]] in the brain which can potentially have toxic effects.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Due to these physiological changes senior and aging dog can have possible impairment of proper cognition.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roudebush|first=Philip|last2=Zicker|first2=Steven C.|last3=Cotman|first3=Carl W.|last4=Milgram|first4=Norton W.|last5=Muggenburg|first5=Bruce A.|last6=Head|first6=Elizabeth|date=2005-09-01|title=Nutritional management of brain aging in dogs|journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association|volume=227|issue=5|pages=722–728|doi=10.2460/javma.2005.227.722|issn=0003-1488}}&lt;/ref&gt; This impairment can include complex learning tasks as well as memory issues.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Vitamin E ===
{{Main|Vitamin E}}
The addition of Vitamin E as an [[antioxidant]] in senior dog food can have a positive effect on brain and cognitive health. Vitamin E is a [[Fat-soluble vitamin|fat soluble vitamin]] which works to prevent [[oxidative damage]] from occurring.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; [[Reactive oxygen species]] can develop in the brain and can have a harmful effect by causing oxidative stress on the tissues if they are not subdued by antioxidants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Oxidative Stress and Free Radical Damage in Neurology|last=Gadoth and Gobel|first=Nathan and Hans|publisher=Humana Press|year=2011|isbn=9781603275149|location=Totowa, New Jersey|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitochondrial aerobic metabolism is thought to be the largest source of reactive oxidative species.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; As the [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]] age their function declines which causes an increase in the production of oxidative species.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Studies carried out in aging dogs looking at the effects of antioxidant supplemented diets have shown that older dogs supplemented with antioxidants including Vitamin E were able to correctly perform tasks more often than senior dogs whose diets were not supplemented.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; It has also been shown that in senior dogs consuming these antioxidant enriched diets there was an increase in positive behavioural actions during the feeding period compared to senior dogs consuming diets that were not supplemented.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== L-carnitine ===
{{Main|Carnitine}}
L-carnitine is an [[amino acid]] and precursor of [[Acetylcarnitine|acetyl-L-carnitine]] which is a mitochondrial cofactor.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; It acts to help with overall mitochondrial function as well as [[lipid metabolism]] which is an important function of mitochondria.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; This is important as an increase in mitochondrial function will help to reduce the rates of oxidative reactions in the brain which overall decrease damage to DNA  and stimulates better cognitive function.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

== Skin and coat health ==
Several physiological changes in the senior pet can lead to a decline in skin and coat health.&lt;ref name=":92"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bellows|first=Jan|last2=Colitz|first2=Carmen M.

Skin and coat health are important to upkeep as dogs age and there are many components in senior dog foods that can benefit this important area of health.

[[File:Soybean Oil, Meal and Beans (10059732523).jpg|thumb|alt= soybean oil, meal and beans.|Soybean oil is a good source of linoleic acid.]]

{{Main|Zinc}}Zinc is among one of many trace minerals recommended for dogs of all ages.&lt;ref name=":1122"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marsh|first=K.|last2=Coe|first2=S.|last3=Ruedisueli|first3=F.|last4=Watson|first4=T.|date=2000|title=Effects of zinc and linoleic acid supplementation on the skin and coat quality of dogs receiving a complete and balanced diet|journal=Veterinary Dermatology|volume=11|issue=4|pages=277–284|doi=10.1046/j.1365-3164.2000.00202.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dogs experience loss of elasticity and dryness of the skin as they age.&lt;ref name=":92"/&gt; The addition of zinc in the diet aids in the development of collagen and wound healing, and also will prevent the skin from becoming dry and flaky.&lt;ref name=":1122" /&gt; Senior dogs can obtain zinc in their diet through the addition of various ingredients, including; red meats, whole grains, poultry by-product meals, and fish meals.

=== Copper ===
{{Main|Copper}}Loss of hair pigmentation is a common concern for senior dogs.&lt;ref name=":92" /&gt; Copper has been shown to improve coat conditions by reducing dry skin and improving the overall pigmentation of the coat.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tewari, D.; Singh, V.K.; Gautam, S.; Dwivedi, V.|first=|date=December 2013|title=Nutritional dermatosis - a review|url=|journal=Intas Polivet|volume=14|pages=199–202|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, copper may able to delay the natural aging process of the whitening of a dog's coat.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

===&amp;nbsp;Riboflavin ===
{{Main|Riboflavin}}
Senior dogs require a larger amount of riboflavin for maintenance compared to adult dogs. Vitamin B2, also known as riboflavin, plays an important role as a cofactor for the [[Carbohydrate metabolism|metabolism of carbohydrates]]. Riboflavin is required in the diet to prevent cracking and dry skin, as well as a darkening of the pigmentation of skin.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spies|first=Tom D.|date=1943|title=The Natural Occurrence of Riboflavin Deficiency in the Eyes of Dogs|jstor=1671149|journal=Science|volume=98|issue=2547|pages=369–370|doi=10.2307/1671149|doi-broken-date=2018-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Riboflavin is also important for the vision of the senior dog as deficiencies can cause alterations in blood supply to the [[cornea]] which may lead to impaired vision and potential blindness.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; A source of riboflavin in senior dog diets is important to help prevent changes that aging can cause on skin.

== Immune system health ==
[[Immune system|Immune functions]] start to decline due to compromised ability to efficiently produce various [[protein]]s and cells that are important for the body's defense system as dogs age. [[Free radicals]] can cause [[oxidative stress]], killing the cells or impairing the functional capability of the cells, which leads to weakening of the [[immune system]].&lt;ref name=":27"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Puertollano|first1=Maria A.|last2=Puertollano|first2=Elena|last3=Alvarez de Cienfuegos|first3=Gerardo|last4=de Pablo|first4=Manuel A.|title=Dietary Antioxidants: Immunity and Host Defense|journal=Current Topics in Medicinal Chemistry|date=1 July 2011|volume=11|issue=14|pages=1752–1766|doi=10.2174/156802611796235107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, providing dietary [[antioxidants]] can be an effective method to prevent the oxidative stress and support the immune system.

=== Ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids ===
{{Main|Omega-3 fatty acid#Omega−6 to omega−3 ratio}}
[[Omega-6]] and [[omega-3]] fatty acids are very important for a strong healthy immune system and for preventing [[chronic disease]] in dogs. It is crucial in pet diets that the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids is properly balanced in order to achieve optimal health.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wander|first=R. C.|last2=Hall|first2=J. A.|last3=Gradin|first3=J. L.|last4=Du|first4=S. H.|last5=Jewell|first5=D. E.|date=June 1997|title=The ratio of dietary (n-6) to (n-3) fatty acids influences immune system function, eicosanoid metabolism, lipid peroxidation and vitamin E status in aged dogs|journal=The Journal of Nutrition|volume=127|issue=6|pages=1198–1205|issn=0022-3166|pmid=9187636|doi=10.1093/jn/127.6.1198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is recommended to have a ratio of 5:1 to 10:1, with there being more omega-6 fatty acids than omega-3's. AAFCO has a maximum ratio listed of 30:1.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; For ideal health and decreased risk of low-grade chronic inflammation, it is more beneficial to have a lower ratio versus a higher one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dietary Reference Intakes for Energy, Carbohydrate, Fiber, Fat, Fatty Acids, Cholesterol, Protein and Amino ACids (Macronutrients).|last=|first=|publisher=National Academy Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=Washington D.C.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Omega-3 fatty acids have [[anti-inflammatory]] properties and therefore need to be supplemented in a closer ratio to omega-6's which are more [[Inflammation|inflammatory]].&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simopoulos|first=Artemis P.|date=2002-12-01|title=Omega-3 Fatty Acids in Inflammation and Autoimmune Diseases|journal=Journal of the American College of Nutrition|volume=21|issue=6|pages=495–505|doi=10.1080/07315724.2002.10719248|issn=0731-5724|pmid=12480795}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of all of the omega-3 fatty acids that could be used, the most potent are found in [[fish oil]] in the forms of [[Eicosapentaenoic acid|EPA]] and [[Docosahexaenoic acid|DHA]], these have the highest immunomodulatory activities.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Omega-3 fatty acids tend to increase [[antioxidant]] requirements because they oxidize so rapidly, therefore when they are in a closer ratio to omega-6 fatty acids, as recommended, antioxidants must also be supplemented in the diet.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

=== Vitamin E ===
{{Main|Vitamin E}}
Vitamin E is an antioxidant that can be supplemented in the diet in order to strengthen the effect of [[fatty acid]] supplementations.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; This vitamin works to decrease the production of pro-inflammatory markers that are found in [[synovial fluid]] of the [[joints]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rhouma|first=Mohamed|last2=de Oliveira El Warrak|first2=Alexander|last3=Troncy|first3=Eric|last4=Beaudry|first4=Francis|last5=Chorfi|first5=Younès|date=2013|title=Anti-inflammatory response of dietary vitamin E and its effects on pain and joint structures during early stages of surgically induced osteoarthritis in dogs|journal=Canadian Journal of Veterinary Research|volume=77|issue=3|pages=191–198|issn=0830-9000|pmc=3700444|pmid=24101795}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of this antioxidant, chronic inflammation can be avoided which aids senior dogs in maintaining a healthier immune system as well as helping to ease the symptoms of [[osteoarthritis]]. Also, formation of [[Hydrogen peroxide|{{chem|H|2|O|2}}]], which is a [[reactive oxygen species]] that suppress [[lymphocyte]] proliferation, can be decreased by vitamin E.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hall|first1=Jean A.|last2=Tooley|first2=Katie A.|last3=Gradin|first3=Joseph L.|last4=Jewell|first4=Dennis E.|last5=Wander|first5=Rosemary C.|title=Effects of dietary n-6 and n-3 fatty acids and vitamin E on the immune response of healthy geriatric dogs|journal=American Journal of Veterinary Research|date=June 2003|volume=64|issue=6|pages=762–772}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===β-Carotene===
{{Main|beta-Carotene}}
[[Beta-carotene]] can be found in certain vegetables and it is a highly potent [[antioxidants]]. The number of [[T-cells]] is naturally decreased with age, leading to compromised immune function. However, in old dogs supplemented with dietary beta-carotene had no statistical difference in the amount of [[CD4+ T cells]] when compared to younger dogs.&lt;ref name=":28"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Massimino|first1=Stefan|last2=Kearns|first2=Robert J.|last3=Loos|first3=Kathleen M.|last4=Burr|first4=John|last5=Park|first5=Jean Soon|last6=Chew|first6=Boon|last7=Adams|first7=Scott|last8=Hayek|first8=Michael G.|title=Effects of Age and Dietary β-Carotene on Immunological Variables in Dogs|journal=Journal of Veterinary Internal Medicine|date=November 2003|volume=17|issue=6|pages=835–842|doi=10.1111/j.1939-1676.2003.tb02523.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also enhance cell-mediated immune responses and help prevent cancer.&lt;ref name=":29"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hughes|first1=David A.|title=Effects carotenoids on human immune function|journal=Proceedings of the Nutrition Society|volume=58|pages=713–718}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dogs supplemented with high dose of dietary beta-carotene may show red discolouration of feces and staining of hair.&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=HEYWOOD|first1=R|last2=PALMER|first2=A|last3=GREGSON|first3=R|last4=HUMMLER|first4=H|title=The toxicity of beta-carotene|journal=Toxicology|date=August 1985|volume=36|issue=2–3|pages=91–100|doi=10.1016/0300-483X(85)90043-5|pmid=4049434}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, toxicity level of beta-carotene in dogs is not clearly understood as dogs can also cleave beta-carotene into [[vitamin A]] in their intestines.&lt;ref name=":30"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Head|first1=Elizabeth|last2=Rofina|first2=Jaime|last3=Zicker|first3=Steven|title=Oxidative Stress, Aging, and Central Nervous System Disease in the Canine Model of Human Brain Aging|journal=Veterinary Clinics of North America: Small Animal Practice|date=January 2008|volume=38|issue=1|pages=167–178|doi=10.1016/j.cvsm.2007.10.002|pmid=18249248|pmc=2390776}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prebiotic and probiotic===
{{Main|Prebiotic (nutrition)|Probiotic}}
Since the gastrointestinal tract is exposed to foreign materials from ingested food, a healthy [[microbiota]] in gut is very important component of the immune system.&lt;ref name=":33"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kau|first1=Andrew L.|last2=Ahern|first2=Philip P.|last3=Griffin|first3=Nicholas W.|last4=Goodman|first4=Andrew L.|last5=Gordon|first5=Jeffrey I.|title=Human nutrition, the gut microbiome and the immune system|journal=Nature|date=15 June 2011|volume=474|issue=7351|pages=327–336|doi=10.1038/nature10213|pmid=21677749|pmc=3298082}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prebiotic (nutrition)|Prebiotic]] and [[probiotic]] supplements can help maintain healthy gut flora.&lt;ref name=":34"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deng|first1=Ping|last2=Swanson|first2=Kelly S.|title=Gut microbiota of humans, dogs and cats: current knowledge and future opportunities and challenges|journal=British Journal of Nutrition|date=21 November 2014|volume=113|issue=S1|pages=S6–S17|doi=10.1017/S0007114514002943|pmid=25414978}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of common prebiotic ingredients in dog foods are [[Fructooligosaccharides]](FOS), Mannanoligosaccharides (MOS), and [[beta-glucan]].

The '''Simonyi Professorship for the Public Understanding of Science''' is a chair at the [[University of Oxford]]. The chair was established in 1995 for the [[Ethology|ethologist]] [[Richard Dawkins]] by an endowment from [[Charles Simonyi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/aims/charles-simonyis-manifesto.html ''Charles Simonyi's manifesto''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205051240/http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/aims/charles-simonyis-manifesto.html |date=5 February 2016 }}, [[University of Oxford]] (page visited on 6 December 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=memoirs/&gt; The aim of the Professorship is 'to communicate science to the public without, in doing so, losing those elements of scholarship which constitute the essence of true understanding'. It is a position that had been endowed by [[Charles Simonyi]] with the express intention that the holder "be expected to make important contributions to the public understanding of some scientific field",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/aims/manifesto.shtml |title=Manifesto for the Simonyi Professorship |accessdate=13 March 2008 |author=Simonyi, Charles |authorlink=Charles Simonyi |date=15 May 1995 |publisher=The University of Oxford|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080423211123/http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/aims/manifesto.shtml |archivedate =23 April 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that its first holder should be Richard Dawkins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/aims/index.shtml |title=Aims of the Simonyi Professorship |date=23 April 2008 |accessdate=28 June 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423211118/http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/aims/index.shtml |archivedate=23 April 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Steel design''', or more specifically, '''structural steel design''', is an area of knowledge of structural engineering used to design [[steel structures]]. The structures can range from schools to homes to bridges.

In [[structural engineering]], a structure is a body or combination of pieces of rigid bodies in space to form a fitness system for supporting loads. Structures such as [[building]]s, [[bridge]]s, [[aircraft]] and [[ship]]s are all examples under steel structure. The effects of loads on structures are determined through [[structural analysis]]. Steel structure is [[steel]] construction material, a profile, formed with a specific shape or cross section and certain standards of chemical composition and mechanical properties.

There are currently two common methods of steel design:  The first method is the [[Allowable Strength Design]] (ASD) method.  The second is the [[limit state design|Load and Resistance Factor Design]] (LRFD) method. Both use a strength, or ultimate level design approach. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Steel Construction Manual |publisher= [[American Institute of Steel Construction]] | edition  = 13th |year= 2006 |isbn= 1-56424-055-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Load combination equations==

===Allowable Strength Design===

For ASD, the required strength, R&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, is determined from the following load combinations (according to the AISC SCM, 13&amp;nbsp;ed.) and:&lt;ref&gt;https://shop.iccsafe.org/media/wysiwyg/material/9346S7-sample.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

D + F&lt;br /&gt;
D + H + F + L + T&lt;br /&gt;
D + H + F + (L&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; or S or R)&lt;br /&gt;
D + H + F + 0.75(L + T) + 0.75(L&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; or S or R)&lt;br /&gt;
D + H + F ± (0.6W or 0.7E)&lt;br /&gt;
D + H + F + (0.75W or 0.7E) + 0.75L + 0.75(L&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; or S or R)&lt;br /&gt;
0.6D + 0.6W&lt;br /&gt;
0.6D ± 0.7E

where:
* D = dead load,
* D&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = weight of Ice,
* E = earthquake load,
* F = load due to fluids with well-defined pressures and maximum heights,
* F&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = flood load,
* H = load due to lateral earth pressure, ground water pressure, or pressure of bulk materials,
* L = live load due to occupancy,
* L&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; = roof live load,
* S = snow load,
* R = nominal load due to initial rainwater or ice, exclusive of the ponding contribution,
* T = self straining load,
* W = wind load,
* W&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = wind on ice..

Special Provisions exist for accounting flood loads and atmospheric loads i.e. D&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and W&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;

Note that Allowable Strength Design is NOT equivalent to Allowable Stress Design, as governed by AISC 9th Edition. Allowable Strength Design still uses a strength, or ultimate level, design approach.

===Load and Resistance Factor Design===
For LRFD, the required strength, R&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;, is determined from the following factored load combinations:

1.4(D + F)&lt;br /&gt;
1.2(D + F + T) + 1.6(L + H) + 0.5(L&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; or S or R)&lt;br /&gt;
1.2D + 1.6(L&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; or S or R) + (L or 0.8W)&lt;br /&gt;
1.2D + 1.0W + L + 0.5(L&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; or S or R)&lt;br /&gt;
1.2D ± 1.0E + L + 0.2S + 0.9D + 1.6W + 1.6H&lt;br /&gt;
0.9D + 1.6 H ± (1.6W or 1.0E)

where the letters for the loads are the same as for ASD.

For the wind consideration, the ASCE allows a "position correction factor" which turns the coefficient of wind action to 1.36:

1.2D + 1.36W + .... the same above
or
0.9D - 1.36W

The '''superconducting tunnel junction''' (STJ) — also known as a '''superconductor–insulator–superconductor tunnel junction''' (SIS) — is an [[electronics|electronic]] device consisting of two [[superconductors]] separated by a very thin layer of [[Insulator (electrical)|insulating]] material. Current passes through the junction via the process of [[quantum tunneling]]. The STJ is a type of [[Josephson junction]], though not all the properties of the STJ are described by the Josephson effect.

These devices have a wide range of applications, including high-sensitivity [[Cryogenic particle detectors|detectors]] of [[electromagnetic radiation]], [[SQUID|magnetometers]], [[RSFQ|high speed digital circuit]] elements, and [[superconducting quantum computing|quantum computing]] circuits.

==Quantum tunneling==

The vertical axis is energy, and the horizontal axis shows the [[density of states]]. [[Cooper pairs]] exist at the [[Fermi energy]], indicated by the dashed lines. A bias voltage V is applied across the junction, shifting the Fermi energies of the two superconductors relative to each other by an energy eV, where e is the [[electron]] charge. [[Quasiparticle]] states exist for energies greater than Δ from the Fermi energy, where Δ is the superconducting energy gap. Green and blue indicate empty and filled quasiparticle states, respectively, at zero temperature.]]

The [[Cooper pair]] tunneling current is seen at V = 0, while the [[quasiparticle]] tunneling current is seen for V &gt; 2Δ/e and V &lt; -2Δ/e.]] 
All [[Electrical current|currents]] flowing through the STJ pass through the insulating layer via the process of [[quantum tunneling]].  There are two components to the tunneling current. The first is from the tunneling of [[Cooper pairs]]. This supercurrent is described by the ac and dc [[Josephson effect|Josephson relations]], first predicted by [[Brian David Josephson]] in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;B. D. Josephson, "Possible new effects in superconductive tunnelling," ''Physics Letters'' '''1''', 251 (1962), {{doi|10.1016/0031-9163(62)91369-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this prediction, Josephson received the [[Nobel prize in physics]] in 1973. The second is the [[quasiparticle]] current, which, in the limit of zero temperature, arises when the energy from the bias voltage &lt;math&gt;eV&lt;/math&gt; exceeds twice the value of superconducting energy gap Δ. At finite temperature, a small quasiparticle tunneling current — called the subgap current — is present even for voltages less than twice the energy gap due to the thermal promotion of quasiparticles above the gap.

If the STJ is irradiated with [[photons]] of frequency &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, the dc current-voltage curve will exhibit both Shapiro steps and steps due to photon-assisted tunneling. Shapiro steps arise from the response of the supercurrent and occur at voltages equal to &lt;math&gt;nhf/(2e)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is [[Planck's constant]], &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is the [[electron]] charge, and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is an [[integer]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Shapiro, "Josephson currents in superconducting tunneling: The effect of microwaves and other observations" ''Physical Review Letters'' '''11''', 80 (1963), {{doi|10.1103/PhysRevLett.11.80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Photon-assisted tunneling arises from the response of the quasiparticles and gives rise to steps displaced in voltage by &lt;math&gt;nhf/e&lt;/math&gt; relative to the gap voltage.&lt;ref&gt;M. Tinkham, ''Introduction to Superconductivity'', 2nd edition, Dover Publications, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

== Device fabrication ==
The device is typically [[Semiconductor device fabrication|fabricated]] by first depositing a thin film of a superconducting metal such as [[aluminum]] on an insulating substrate such as [[silicon]]. The deposition is performed inside a [[vacuum chamber]]. [[Oxygen]] gas is then introduced into the chamber, resulting in the formation of an insulating layer of [[aluminum oxide]] (&lt;math&gt;Al_{2}O_{3}&lt;/math&gt;) with a typical thickness of several [[nanometers]]. After the vacuum is restored, an overlapping layer of superconducting metal is deposited, completing the STJ. To create a well-defined overlap region, a procedure known as the [[Niemeyer-Dolan technique]] is commonly used. This technique uses a suspended bridge of [[Resist (semiconductor fabrication)|resist]] with a double-angle deposition to define the junction.

[[Aluminum]] is widely used for making superconducting tunnel junctions because of its unique ability to form a very thin (2-3&amp;nbsp;nm) insulating [[Aluminum oxide|oxide]] layer with no defects that [[short-circuit]] the insulating layer. The [[superconducting]] critical temperature of aluminum is approximately 1.2 [[kelvin]] (K). For many applications, it is convenient to have a device that is superconducting at a higher temperature, in particular at a temperature above the [[boiling point]] of [[liquid helium]], which is 4.2 K at atmospheric pressure. One approach to achieving this is to use [[niobium]], which has a superconducting critical temperature in bulk form of 9.3 K. Niobium, however, does not form an oxide that is suitable for making tunnel junctions. To form an insulating oxide, the first layer of niobium can be coated with a very thin layer (approximately 5&amp;nbsp;nm) of aluminum, which is then oxidized to form a high quality aluminum oxide tunnel barrier before the final layer of niobium is deposited. The thin aluminum layer is [[Proximity effect (superconductivity)|proximitized]] by the thicker niobium, and the resulting device has a superconducting critical temperature above 4.2 K.&lt;ref&gt;A. A. Joseph,  J. Sese, J. Flokstra, &amp; H. G. Kerkhoff, "Structural testing of the HYPRES niobium process," ''IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity'', '''15''', 106 (2005), {{doi|10.1109/TASC.2005.849705}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early work used [[lead]]-lead oxide-lead tunnel junctions.&lt;ref&gt;G. J. Dolan, T. G. Phillips, and D. P. Woody, "Low‐noise 115‐GHz mixing in superconducting oxide‐barrier tunnel junctions," ''Applied Physics Letters'' '''34''', 347 (1979), {{doi|10.1063/1.90783}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lead]] has a superconducting critical temperature of 7.2 K in bulk form, but lead oxide tends to develop defects (sometimes called pinhole defects) that short-circuit the tunnel barrier when the device is thermally cycled between [[cryogenic]] temperatures and room temperature, and as result lead is no longer widely used to make STJs.

==Applications==

===Radio astronomy===
STJs are the most sensitive [[heterodyne]] receivers in the 100&amp;nbsp;GHz to 1000&amp;nbsp;GHz frequency range, and hence are used for [[radio astronomy]] at these frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;J. Zmuidzinas and P. L. Richards, "Superconducting detectors and mixers for millimeter and submillimeter astrophysics," ''Proceedings of the IEEE'' '''92''', 1597 (2004), {{doi|10.1109/JPROC.2004.833670}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this application, the STJ is [[DC bias|dc biased]] at a voltage just below the gap voltage (|V| = 2Δ/e). A high frequency signal from an astronomical object of interest is focused onto the STJ, along with a [[local oscillator]] source. Photons absorbed by the STJ allow quasiparticles to tunnel via the process of photon-assisted tunneling. This photon-assisted tunneling changes the current-voltage curve, creating a nonlinearity that produces an output at the difference frequency of the astronomical signal and the local oscillator. This output is a frequency down-converted version of the astronomical signal.&lt;ref&gt;M. J. Wengler, "Submillimeter-wave detection with superconducting tunnel diodes," ''Proceedings of the IEEE'' '''80''', 1810 (1992), {{doi|10.1109/5.175257}}&lt;/ref&gt; These receivers are so sensitive that an accurate description of the device performance must take into account the effects of [[quantum noise]].&lt;ref&gt;J. R. Tucker, "Quantum limited detection in tunnel junction mixers," ''IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics'' '''15''', 1234 (1979), {{doi|10.1109/JQE.1979.1069931}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Single-photon detection===
In addition to [[heterodyne]] detection, STJs can also be used as direct detectors. In this application, the STJ is biased with a dc voltage less than the gap voltage. A [[photon]] absorbed in the superconductor breaks [[Cooper pairs]] and creates [[quasiparticles]]. The quasiparticles tunnel across the junction in the direction of the applied voltage, and the resulting tunneling current is proportional to the photon energy. STJ devices have been employed as single-photon detectors for photon frequencies ranging from [[X-rays]] to the [[infrared]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=33525 STJ detectors from the European Space Agency], accessed 8-17-11&lt;/ref&gt;

===SQUIDs===
The [[superconducting quantum interference device]] or [[SQUID]] is based on a superconducting loop containing Josephson junctions. SQUIDs are the world's most sensitive [[magnetometer]]s, capable of measuring a single [[magnetic flux quantum]].

===Quantum computing===
[[Superconducting quantum computing]] utilizes STJ-based circuits, including [[charge qubit]]s, [[flux qubit]]s and [[phase qubit]]s.

===RSFQ===
The STJ is the primary active element in [[rapid single flux quantum]] or [[RSFQ]] fast logic circuits.&lt;ref&gt;K. K. Likharev and V. K. Semenov, "RSFQ logic/memory family: a new Josephson-junction technology for sub-terahertz-clock-frequency digital systems," ''IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity'' '''1''', 3 (1991) {{doi|10.1109/77.80745}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Josephson voltage standard===
When a high frequency current is applied to a Josephson junction, the ac Josephson current will synchronize with the applied frequency giving rise to regions of constant voltage in the I-V curve of the device (Shapiro steps).  For the purpose of voltage standards, these steps occur at the voltages &lt;math&gt; nf/K_{J} &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt; is an integer, &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt; is the applied frequency and the Josephson constant 
&lt;math&gt; K_{J} = 483597.9 \,\textrm{GHz}/\textrm{V} &lt;/math&gt; is an internationally defined constant essentially equal to &lt;math&gt; 2e/h &lt;/math&gt;.  These steps provide an exact conversion from frequency to voltage. Because frequency can be measured with very high precision, this effect is used as the basis of the Josephson voltage standard, which implements the international definition of the "[[Conventional electrical unit| conventional]]" volt.&lt;ref&gt;C. A. Hamilton, R. L. Kautz, R. L. Steiner, and F. L. Lloyd, "A practical Josephson voltage standard at 1 V," ''IEEE Electron Device Letters'' '''6''', 623 (1985), {{doi|10.1109/EDL.1985.26253}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nist.gov/pml/div686/devices/voltage.cfm Quantum voltage metrology at NIST], accessed 11-5-11&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5085">'''Transactional sex''' refers to [[sexual relationship]]s where the giving of gifts or services is an important factor. Transactional sex is a [[superset]] of [[prostitution]], in that the exchange of gifts for sex includes a broader set of (usually non-marital) obligations that do not necessarily involve a predetermined payment or gift, but where there is a definite motivation to benefit materially from the sexual exchange.{{sfn|Hunter|2002}} The participants do not necessarily frame themselves in terms of prostitutes/clients, but often as girlfriends/boyfriends, or [[sugar baby|sugar babies]]/sugar daddies.{{sfn|Hoefinger|2010}}{{sfn|Hoefinger|2013}} Those offering sex may or may not feel affection for their partners.

== In Sub-Saharan Africa ==

The pervasiveness of transactional sex in sub-saharan Africa, common in non-marital relationships across all income categories, is closely linked to socio-cultural expectations of gender whereby a man is expected to act as a provider to their partners and women expect a compensation for 'giving' sex.  This results in implicit assumptions of exchange, whereby for example a man might buy a woman a drink and her acceptance implies a willingness to have sex. Transactional sex is also becoming a vehicle for migration in places where younger women have intimate relationships with older men from for example Europe or North America.{{sfn|Groes-Green|2014}}

The general consensus among those studying transactional sex is that it is associated with the joint onslaught of [[poverty]] and the influence of Western [[consumerism]], the differences in economic power between men and women, and the breakdown of traditional African marriage customs involving [[bridewealth]]. Some scholars also associate transactional sex with the use of female erotic power and new inter-generational strategies and argue that these are part of a broader moral economy where the money young women earn from transactional sex is redistributed to kin and peers.{{sfn|Groes-Green|2013}}{{sfn|Groes-Green|2014}}{{sfn|Cole|2010}}

Though these relationships are common in Sub-Sahara Africa, they are also increasingly common in other parts of the world, such as Southeast Asia.

[[File:Shiprock, New Mexico uranium mill aerial photo.png|thumb|Shiprock, New Mexico uranium mill aerial photo]]

The United States encouraged [[uranium mining]] production because of the [[nuclear arms race]] with the [[Soviet Union]], its opponent in the [[Cold War]]. Large [[uranium]] deposits were found on and near the [[Navajo Reservation]] in the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]], and these were developed through the 20th century. Absent much environmental regulation prior to the founding of the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] in 1970 and passage of related laws, the mining endangered thousands of Navajo workers, as well as producing contamination that has persisted in adversely affecting air and water quality, and contaminating Navajo lands.

Private companies hired many Navajo employees to work the mines. Disregarding the known health risks of exposure to uranium, the private companies and the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] failed to inform the Navajo workers about the dangers and to regulate the mining to minimize contamination. As more data was collected, they were slow to take appropriate action for the workers. Studies show that the Navajo mine workers and numerous families on the reservation have suffered high rates of lung, cancers (including [[Xeroderma pigmentosum]])&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peoplesworld.org/article/rare-disease-suddenly-arises-on-navajo-reservation/ review of documentary "Sun Kissed"&lt;/ref&gt; and other diseases, from environmental contamination. For decades, industry and the government failed to regulate or improve conditions, or inform workers of the dangers. As high rates of illness began to occur, workers were often unsuccessful in court cases seeking compensation, and the states at first did not officially recognize [[radon]] illness. In 1990 the US Congress passed the [[Radiation Exposure Compensation Act]], to settle such cases and provide needed compensation.

Despite efforts made in cleaning up uranium sites, significant problems from the legacy of uranium development persist today on the Navajo Nation and in the states of Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona. Hundreds of [[abandoned mine]]s have not been cleaned up, and these present environmental and health risks in many communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-navajo19nov19,0,1645689.story | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Judy | last=Pasternak | title=A peril that dwelt among the Navajos | date=2006-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Environmental Protection Agency]] estimates that there are 4000 mines with documented uranium production, and another 15,000 locations with uranium occurrences in 14 western states.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. EPA, Radiation Protection, "Uranium Mining Waste,"

The [[Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act]] (1978) is a [[United States environmental law]] that amended the [[Atomic Energy Act of 1954]] and authorized the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] to establish health and environmental standards for the stabilization, [[Environmental remediation|restoration]], and disposal of [[Radioactive waste|uranium mill waste]].&lt;ref name=EPASummary&gt;{{citation|title=Laws We Use (Summaries):1978 - Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act(42 USC 2022 et seq.) |publisher=EPA |url=http://www.epa.gov/radiation/laws/laws_sum.html#umtrca |accessdate=December 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cleanup has continued to be difficult, and EPA administers several [[Superfund]] sites located in the Navajo Nation.

==History==

The Navajo people refused to let any industry mine their land in the 1930s, when the appointed federal guardian to the Navajo Nation attempted to decide what mining should take place on their land.

But pressure for mining increased in the postwar years, when the United States believed it had to develop resources to compete with the [[Soviet Union]] in the [[Cold War]]. In 1948, the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC) announced it would be the sole purchaser of any uranium mined in the United States, to cut off dependence on imported uranium. The AEC would not mine the uranium; it contracted with private mining companies for the product.&lt;ref name=Brugge&gt;Brugge, Doug, Timothy Benally, and Esther Yazzie-Lewis. ''The Navajo People and Uranium Mining,'' Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent mining boom led to the creation of thousands of mines; 92% of all western mines were located on the [[Colorado Plateau]] because of regional resources.&lt;ref name=Dawson&gt;Dawson, Susan E, and Gary E Madsen. "Uranium Mine Workers, Atomic Downwinders, and the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act." In ''Half Lives &amp; Half-Truths: Confronting the Radioactive Legacies of the Cold War,'' pp. 117-143. Santa Fe: School For Advanced Research, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Navajo Nation]] encompasses portions of [[Arizona]], [[New Mexico]], and [[Utah]], and their reservation was a key area for uranium mining. More than 1000 mines were established by leases in the reservation.&lt;ref name=Dawson/&gt; From 1944 to 1986, an estimated 3,000 to 5,000 Navajo people worked in the uranium mines on their land.&lt;ref name="Fettus"&gt;{{cite web|last=Fettus|first=Geoffry H.|title=Nuclear Fuel's Dirty Beginnings: Environmental Damage and Public Health Risks From Uranium Mining in the American West|url=http://www.nrdc.org/nuclear/files/uranium-mining-report.pdf|work=National Resources Defense Council|publisher=National Resources Defense Council|accessdate=29 April 2014|author2=Matthew G. Mckinzie |date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other work was scarce on and near the reservation, and many [[Navajo people|Navajo]] men traveled miles to work in the mines, sometimes taking their families with them.&lt;ref name=Brugge/&gt;

Between 1944 and 1989, 3.9 million tons of uranium ore were mined from the mountains and plains.&lt;ref name=Pasternak&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/news/la-na-navajo19nov19,0,5351917.story | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Judy | last=Pasternak | title=A peril that dwelt among the Navajos | date=November 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, the [[US Public Health Service]] made a massive study of uranium miners. In 1962 it published the first report to show a statistical correlation between cancer and uranium mining.&lt;ref name=Dawson/&gt; The federal government finally regulated the standard amount of [[radon]] in mines, setting the level at .3 WL on January 1, 1969.&lt;ref name = Brugge/&gt; The [[Environmental Protection Agency]] was established on December 2, 1970. But, environmental regulation could not repair the damage already suffered. Navajo miners contracted [[lung cancer]] at much higher rates than the rest of the population, and they have suffered higher rates of other lung diseases caused by breathing in radon.&lt;ref name=Brugge/&gt;

Private companies resisted regulation through lobbying Congress and state legislatures. In 1990, the [[United States Congress]] finally passed the [[Radiation Exposure Compensation Act]] (RECA), granting [[reparation (legal)|reparations]] for those affected by the [[radiation]]. The act was amended in 2000 to address criticisms and problems with the original legislation.&lt;ref name = Dawson/&gt;

The [[tribal council]] and Navajo delegates remained in control of mining decisions before the adverse [[Uranium#Human exposure|health effects]] of mining were identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pasternak|first=Judy|title=Yellow Dirt: An American Story of a Poisoned Land and a People Betrayed|year=2010|publisher=Free Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; No one fully understood the [[Health effects of radon#Cancer in miners|effect of radon exposure for miners]], as there was insufficient data before the expansion of mining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brugge|first=Doug|title=The Navajo People and Uranium Mining|year=2006|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|location=Albuquerque}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Judy Pasternak's ''Yellow Dirt: An American Story of a Poisoned Land and a People Betrayed''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Church Rock uranium mill spill===
{{Main|Church Rock uranium mill spill}}
[[File:United Nuclear Corporation Church Rock Uranium Mill.jpeg|thumb|United Nuclear Corporation Church Rock Uranium Mill]]
On July 16, 1979, the tailings pond at United Nuclear Corporation's uranium mill in [[Church Rock, New Mexico]], breached its dam. More than 1,000 tons of [[radioactive waste|radioactive mill waste]] and 93 millions of gallons of acidic, radioactive tailings solution and mine effluent flowed into the [[Puerco River]], and contaminants traveled {{convert|80|mi|km}} downstream to [[Navajo County, Arizona]].&lt;ref name=Pasternak2&gt;Pasternak, ''Yellow Dirt: An American Story of a Poisoned Land and a People Betrayed'', Free Press, 2010, p.149, {{ISBN|1416594833}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flood backed up sewers, affected nearby [[aquifers]] and left stagnating, contaminated pools on the riverside.&lt;ref name=chur&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=1963288 | pmid=17666688 | doi=10.2105/AJPH.2006.103044 | volume=97 | title=The Sequoyah corporation fuels release and the Church Rock spill: unpublicized nuclear releases in American Indian communities | date=September 2007 | journal=Am J Public Health | pages=1595–600 | last1 = Brugge | first1 = D | last2 = Bui | first2 = C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=water&gt;Brendan Giusti, "Radiation Spill in Church Rock Still Haunts 30 Years Later", ''The Daily Times'' ([[Farmington, New Mexico]]), July 16, 2009, Section: Local&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sz&gt;Ferenc Morton Szasz, ''Larger Than Life: New Mexico in the Twentieth Century,'' UNM Press, 2006, pp.82-83, {{ISBN|0-8263-3883-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state contingency plan relied on English-only notification of the largely Navajo public populace affected by the spill. Local residents did not learn immediately of the toxic danger.&lt;ref name=Sequoyah/&gt; The locals were accustomed to using the riverside for recreation and herb gathering. Residents who waded in the acidic water went to the hospital complaining of burning feet and were misdiagnosed with heat stroke. Sheep and cattle died en masse.&lt;ref name=water/&gt; The Navajo Nation asked the governor of New Mexico to request disaster assistance from the US government and have the site declared a disaster area, but the governor refused.&lt;ref name=Sequoyah /&gt; This limited the amount of disaster relief the Navajo Nation received.

For nearly two years, the state and federal government trucked in water to the reservation, but ended the program in 1981. Farmers had little choice but to resume use of the river for watering livestock and crops.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Shuey, MPH [http://www.sric.org/workbook/features/V11_1.html "The Puerco River: Where Did the Water Go?"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226022609/http://www.sric.org/workbook/features/V11_1.html |date=2012-02-26 }}, ''Southwest Research and Information Center,'' 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health studies on exposure to uranium==
Concerned over the adverse health consequences which Europeans experienced from uranium mines, William Bale and John Harley conducted an independent study.  Their work led the US government to start the United States Public Health Study (USPHS) on uranium mine workers. Bale and Harley's studies focused on identifying the level of radon in mines and assessing any correlation with [[disease]], specifically lung cancer. Radon, they found, can attach to mine dust, which would be inhaled and subsequently concentrated in the lung tissue. Because of this action, workers breathed radon gas at concentrations up to 100 times higher than the amount of radon gas indicated.&lt;ref name=Dawson/&gt; The USPHS was subsequently launched in 1951, with two goals: to identify uranium mine [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] exposures, and to conduct a medical evaluation of the miners.&lt;ref name = Dawson/&gt;

===Ethical concerns===
The USPHS study raised ethical concerns. The Navajo workers were rarely notified of the possible dangers which the USPHS was studying.&lt;ref name=Brugge/&gt; As late as 1960, the USPHS [[informed consent|medical consent]] form failed to inform miners about the possible health risks of working in the mine.&lt;ref name=Dawson/&gt; The Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments, created in 1994 to explore the treatment of the workers, said: "'Had they been better informed, they could have sought help in publicizing the fact that working conditions in the mines were extremely hazardous, which might have resulted in some mines being ventilated earlier than they were."&lt;ref name=Dawson/&gt; The USPHS failed to abide by a centerpiece of [[Nuremberg Code]] (1947), by failing to have informed consent of the subjects of a research study.&lt;ref name=Brugge/&gt;

In 1952, the USPHS issued two reports, reporting exceptionally high concentrations of radon in these uranium mines, even higher than those found in European mines years before.&lt;ref name=Dawson/&gt; Medically, there was little evidence found of sickness. But, the [[Incubation period|latency]] from exposure to disease, also found among the European cases, explains why there were few medical effects observed at this early stage.&lt;ref name=Dawson/&gt; In a private meeting between the AEC and the USPHS, the AEC informed the USPHS scientists that not only could the high radon levels eventually cause cancer, but proper ventilation of the mines could avoid the problem.&lt;ref name=Brugge/&gt; The government failed to take any action on this finding.&lt;ref name=Brugge/&gt;

===Continued effects and research===
The USPHS continued to study the uranium miners, eventually including 4,000 [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]] and non-Indian underground uranium miners.  They added miners in 1951, 1953, 1954, 1957 and 1960.&lt;ref name=Dawson/&gt; In 1962, the USPHS published the first account of the effects of radon exposure. It found a significant [[correlation]] between radon exposure and cancer.&lt;ref name=Brugge/&gt; Additional studies were published in 1968, 1973, 1976, 1981, 1987, 1995 and 1997; these demonstrated linear relationships between radon exposure and lung cancer, a latency period of about 20 years between radon exposure and health effects, and noted that, while smoking [[tobacco]] caused a shorter latency period for the development of cancer, it did not fully explain the relationship between radon and cancer.&lt;ref name=Dawson/&gt; Similar reports found instances of other diseases such as [[pneumoconiosis]], [[tuberculosis]], [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD), as well as diseases of the [[blood]].&lt;ref name=Dawson/&gt; A 2000 study of the number of cancer cases among Navajo uranium mine workers concluded that the miners were 28.6 times more likely to contract the disease than the study's control group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brugge|first=Doug|title=The History of Uranium Mining and the Navajo People|pmc=3222290|work=American Journal of Public Health|author2=Rob Goble |date=September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many miners died from radiation-related illnesses. A 1995 report published by [[American Public Health Association]] found: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;excess mortality rates for lung cancer, pneumoconioses and other respiratory diseases, and tuberculosis for Navajo uranium miners. Increasing duration of exposure to underground uranium mining was associated with increased mortality risk for all three diseases… The most important long-term mortality risks for the Navajo uranium miners continue to be lung cancer and pneumoconioses and other nonmalignant respiratory diseases.&lt;ref name=Roscoe&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roscoe | first1 = Robert J | last2 = Deddens James | first2 = A | last3 = Salvan | first3 = Albert | last4 = Schnorr | first4 = Teressa M | year = 1995| title = Mortality Among Navajo Uranium Miners | doi = 10.2105/ajph.85.4.535 | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 85| issue = | pages = 535–541 | pmc = 1615135 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Over the decades, Navajo miners extracted some four million tons of uranium ore, which was used by the U.S. government primarily to make nuclear weapons.  Some miners, unaware of the adverse health effects, carried contaminated rocks and tailings from local mines to build their family homes. These were found to be contaminated, with the family at risk. In 2009, those homes began to be demolished and rebuilt under a new government program, which involved temporarily relocating occupants until the homes could be rebuilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/27/us/27navajo.html?_r=0 |title=Uranium Contamination Haunts Navajo Country |author=Dan Frosch |date=July 26, 2009 |work=New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States government response==
Following the publication of the reports in the early 1950s, some private contractors attempted to properly ventilate their mines. The states of Colorado, New Mexico and Utah established minimum standards for radon concentrations (Dawson and Madsen 2007). But, the AEC was lax in enforcement of the rules; AEC commissioners did not establish national radon standards at the time the studies were released.&lt;ref name=Dawson/&gt; The AEC said it had no authority to regulate uranium, but it regulated [[beryllium]]. The health and activist communities have criticized the AEC for its failure to take action related to the scientific reports. The agency repressed the reports.&lt;ref name=Dawson/&gt;

Government and uranium industry personnel were privy to the information, but it was not until the 1960s that workers were informed of the environmental dangers.&lt;ref name=Dawson/&gt; The government response continued to be slow. Regulation of the uranium industry was first debated in Congress in 1966, but little progress was made. Journalists began to publish stories detailing the illnesses of uranium miners, giving them public attention.&lt;ref name=Brugge/&gt; In 1969, Congress set the standard radon level for mines at .3 WL.&lt;ref name=Brugge/&gt;

Navajo miners began to file lawsuits to seek compensation for health damages, but often lost in court. But the publicity, presentation of harmful evidence, and victim testimony gave support to their cause.&lt;ref name=Dawson/&gt;[[Ted Kennedy]] (D-MA) was the first senator to propose a Radiation Compensation bill, with the goal of avoiding lawsuits and compensating victims fully, though it was defeated in 1979. [[Orrin Hatch]]'s (R-UT) 1981 compensation bill was met with a similar fate, and his attempt in 1983 did not reach the [[United States Senate|Senate]] floor.&lt;ref name=Dawson/&gt;

===Progress toward legislation===
In 1989, Orrin Hatch, supported by fellow Utah Representative [[Wayne Owens]] (D-UT), sponsored the [[Radiation Exposure Compensation Act]] (RECA), which was signed into law by President [[George H.W. Bush]] on October 15, 1990.&lt;ref name=Dawson/&gt; The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA): "Offers an apology and monetary compensation to individuals who contracted certain cancers and other serious diseases following their exposure to radiation released during above-ground atmospheric nuclear weapons tests or, following their occupational exposure to radiation while employed in the uranium industry during the build-up to the Cold War." &lt;ref name=DOJ&gt;United States Department of Justice. Radiation Exposure Compensation Program, About the Program. November 6, 2009. http://www.justice.gov/civil/torts/const/reca/about.htm (accessed October 28, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Department of Justice]] established regulations for implementing the act, related to individuals eligible for payment, and guidelines for identification, including [[marriage licenses]], [[birth certificates]] and official documents, some of which the Navajo did not possess. In some cases, the government did not recognize individual's documentation as legitimate.&lt;ref name=Dawson/&gt;

With additional data from the studies by the [[Public Health Service]] (PHS), in 2000 the act was amended to correct shortcomings: "The RECA Amendments of 2000 broadened the scope of eligibility for benefits to include two new occupationally exposed claimant categories (uranium mill workers and uranium ore transporters), expanding both the time periods and geographic areas covered, and adding compensable diseases, thus allowing more individuals to be eligible to qualify." &lt;ref name=GAO&gt;United States Government Accountability Office. "United States Government Accountability Office." September 7, 2007. www.gao.gov/new.items/d071037r.pdf - (accessed October 28, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; As of November 17, 2009, the government has paid claims of 21,810 people, denied 8,789, and paid $1,455,257,096 in reparations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usdoj.gov/civil/omp/omi/Tre_SysClaimsToDateSum.pdf Department of Justice Civil Division, "Radiation Exposure Compensation System"], Radiation Exposure Compensation Program, 17 November 2009 (accessed November 17, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abandoned Mine Land program===
The ''Navajo Nation Abandoned Mine Land''(s) (NN AML) are numerous [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]-designated "AML sites" on lands of the [[Navajo people]] which were used for [[uranium mining|mining (e.g., uranium)]]. Sites include:

====History====
This specific Superfund site for the AUMs on Navajo land has been in existence since 1994. This is following many years of research on the health effects of uranium mining which eventually led to the [[Radiation Exposure Compensation Act]] in 1990. Since its acceptance as a Superfund site, many federal, tribal, and grassroots organizations have come together to assess and remediate contamination sites on the Navajo Nation. Due to the fact that there are hundreds of contaminated sites, there have been a few big successes and many communities stuck in limbo. The following is a history of this Superfund site, the organizations that have collaborated on this environmental remediation, and recent criticisms of the handling of this large and complicated problem.

The Abandoned Uranium Mines on the Navajo Nation were established as a Superfund site in 1994 in response to a Congressional hearing brought by the Navajo Nation on November 4, 1993. This hearing included the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA), the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] (DOE), and the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA). Superfund status stems from the [[Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act]] of 1980 (CERCLA) which allows the United States federal government to assign funds for environmental remediation of uncontrolled hazardous waste sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Superfund|url=http://www.epa.gov/superfund/|accessdate=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Navajo Nation is located in Region 9 (Pacific Southwest) of the Superfund which serves [[Arizona]], [[California]], [[Hawaii]], [[Nevada]], the [[Pacific Islands]], and Tribal Nations. The site's official EPA # is NNN000906087 and it is located in Congressional District 4. According to the EPA's Superfund site overview, other names for the AUMs may include "Navajo Abandoned Uranium Mines" or "Northeast Church Rock Mine." Church Rock Mine is one of the EPA's most successful clean-up sites among over 500 sites spanning the 27,000 square mile Navajo Nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Addressing Uranium Contamination in the Navajo Nation|url=http://epa.gov/region9/superfund/navajo-nation/index.html|accessdate=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly four years after the initial Congressional hearing, the EPA announced their first helicopter survey for the AUMs in September 1997. Located in the Oljato area in Southeastern [[Utah]] near the Utah-Arizona border, this was first of several helicopter surveys that aimed to measure "naturally occurring radiation ([[gamma radiation]]) coming from abandoned uranium mining areas." The stated purpose of these surveys was to "determine if these sites pose a risk to the people in the area and if so, what measures should be taken to minimize that risk."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. EPA to Perform Helicopter Survey of Abandoned Uranium Mines in the Oljato Area|url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/r9/sfund/r9sfdocw.nsf/3dc283e6c5d6056f88257426007417a2/76cacdcfe20f9547882576cd007e059f/$FILE/1997%20Oljato%20Helicopter%20Survey.pdf|accessdate=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over ten years later, on June 9, 2008, the EPA announced its five-year plan for the clean-up of uranium contamination on the Navajo Nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/r9/sfund/r9sfdocw.nsf/3dc283e6c5d6056f88257426007417a2/bf9a1608e7578ba388257405000499f8/$FILE/NN%205-Year%20Plan-June%2012-final.pdf|title=Health and Environmental Impacts of Uranium Contamination in the Navajo Nation Five-Year Plan|accessdate=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This five-year plan contained nine specific objectives for 2008-2012: assess up to 500 contaminated structures and remediate those that pose a health risk; assess up to 70 potentially contaminated water sources and assist those affected by it; assess and require cleanup of AUMs via a tiered ranking system of high priority mines; clean Church Rock Mine, the highest-priority mine; remediate groundwater of abandoned uranium milling sites; assess the Highway 160 site; assess and clean Tuba City Dump; assess and treat health conditions for populations near AUMs; and lastly to summarize the action of the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] (NRC) in its assistance to the Navajo Nation's cleanup efforts. Since the introduction of the five-year plan, the EPA has released a progress report (available online) each consecutive year. As of August 2011, the EPA lists its accomplishments as: screening 683 structures, sampling 250 unregulated water sources and shutting down 3 such contaminated sources, provision of public outreach and educational programs for safe water practices, instituting a 2.6 million dollar water hauling feasibility project, and providing up to 386 homes with clean drinking water through a 20 million dollar project with Indian Health Services. For 2012, the EPA has listed its next steps as replacing 6 contaminated structures, demolishing other contaminated structures, and continuing screening of these structures for referral to the EPA's Response Program. The 2011 progress report also lists Church Rock, the Oljato Mesa, and the Mariano Lake Mine as sites of current or proposed remediation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/r9/sfund/r9sfdocw.nsf/3dc283e6c5d6056f88257426007417a2/c0c617e006c655c28825791400795ae3/$FILE/Navajo%208_11%20911kb.pdf|title=Health and Environmental Impacts of Uranium Contamination in the Navajo NationEPA Progress in Implementing a 5-Year Cleanup Plan|accessdate=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the EPA's website, the AUM Superfund site is not on the [[National Priorities List]] (NPL) and has no proposals to be put on this list. The NPL is the list of hazardous Superfund sites that are deemed eligible for long-term environmental remediation. The EPA suggests that although NPL listing is a possibility it is "not likely" for the abandoned uranium mines on the Navajo nation. NPL status guides the EPA in its decisions on sites to further investigate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/National_Priorities_List|title=National Priorities List|accessdate=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a process that has been criticized for the handling of these mines. With over 500 uranium sites and only a few sites slated for full-scale remediation plans, the prioritization process has recently been called into question by [[The New York Times]] (see Recent Press).

====Partnership agencies====
Superfund works with many agencies from both the federal government and the Navajo Nation in order to properly assess and direct funding to mining sites. These agencies include: the Navajo Nation Environmental Protection Agency (NNEPA), the [[Indian Health Services]] (IHS), the Diné Network for Environmental Health (DiNEH), the Navajo Nation Department of Water Resources (NNDWR), the Department of Energy (DOE), and US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).
The NNEPA was established in 1972 and officially recognized through legislation as a separate regulatory branch of the Navajo Nation in 1995. With the official acceptance of the NNEPA also came the adoption of the Navajo Nation Environmental Policy Act. According to the NNEPA website, their mission is: "With respect to Diné values, to protect human health, land, air and water by developing, implementing and enforcing environmental laws and regulations with a commitment to public participation, sustainability, partnership, and restoration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navajonationepa.org/index.html |title=NNEPA |publisher=Navajonationepa.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Diné is the word for Navajo in the traditional [[Navajo language]]) NNEPA consults with the US EPA on site assessments (the US EPA is the lead agency for the Site Assessment Project). NNEPA helps the EPA in assessing and deciding which contaminated structures should be demolished and which water sources should be deemed a human health risk. The two also collaborate to perform community outreach for the Navajo people whose lives are affected by the uranium mining.
The [[Center for Disease Control]] and the DiNEH Project are also integral players in the assessment of water quality and community outreach. The Navajo Nation Department of Water Resources, with funding from the EPA, assist Navajo residents by hauling water for residents near 4 contaminated water sources, a 2.6 million dollar project. Indian Health Services helped fund the 20 million dollar drinking water project started in 2011. This project serves 386 homes near 10 contaminated water sources. The NNEPA, IHS, NNDWR, and DiNEH project have been the main partners with the US EPA in water hauling projects.

====Community involvement and response====
Forgotten People&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forgottennavajopeople.org/blog/ |title=Forgotten People &amp;#124; News, Events, and Activism concerning the former Bennett Freeze |publisher=Forgottennavajopeople.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; (FP) is a grassroots organization incorporated on the Navajo Nation which represents the health and well-being of the residents of the Navajo Nation in Arizona. The full name of this organization is Forgotten People Diné Bé Iina' na' hil naa, meaning Diné Rebuilding Communities. Forgotten People began as a political organization dedicated to advocacy for the Navajo people against forced relocation plans which spanned 1974 to 2007. When forced relocation programs were ended in 2007, the organization shifted focus to a broader variety of issues with a focus in environmental remediation. In 2009, Forgotten People received the Environmental Excellence Award from the NNEPA. Forgotten People was an integral aspect of the Black Falls water project, which involved collaboration with the US EPA to provide clean drinking water and educational outreach for the Black Falls community which was affected by uranium mining. FP attributes the success of Black Falls with the evolution "from a needs-based or dependency approach to the agencies into an assumption of full responsibility for their own development." The Black Falls community was able to decide upon their own solutions for their water problems. Their efforts were coordinated by FP and funded by the US EPA. Forgotten People represents an evolving grassroots community which is moving simply from organizing to actually empowering residents to take their development into their own hands.

Forgotten People also gathers and displays pertinent public records for a variety of issues facing the Navajo on their website. For their campaigns against uranium mining, their website displays all official responses US attempts at relaxing uranium restrictions on Navajo territory. FP also preserves the response of the President of the Navajo Nation in response to proposals for uranium mining near the [[Grand Canyon]]. In 2005, the President of the Navajo Nation, [[Joe Shirley, Jr.]], signed the Diné Natural Resources Protection Act which banned uranium mining and processing on Navajo land. After signing the law, President Shirley stated, "As long as there are no answers to cancer, we shouldn't have uranium mining on the Navajo Nation. I believe the powers that be committed [[genocide]] on Navajo land by allowing uranium mining. "&lt;ref&gt;http://www.forgottennavajopeople.org/projects/advocacy/4%2030%2009%20Navajo%20Nation%20issues%20ban%20on%20uranium%20mining.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticism and press====
Despite the EPA's claims of a "strong partnership with the Navajo Nation," recent articles have been published that call into question the equitability and efficiency of the EPA's action on the abandoned uranium mines. On March 31, 2012, The New York Times published an article entitled "Uranium Mines Dot Navajo Land, Neglected and Still Perilous"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Leslie Macmillan|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/01/us/uranium-mines-dot-navajo-land-neglected-and-still-perilous.html?pagewanted=all|title=Uranium Mines Dot Navajo Land, Neglected and Still Perilous|publisher=New York Times|date=March 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Leslie MacMillan. The article suggests that politics and money are influencing the prioritization of mine clean-up efforts. David Shafer, an environmental manager at the United States Department of Energy, has said that questions of whether current uranium problems are due to past mining or to the naturally occurring mineral are delaying the process of cleaning up. Similar concerns are common in environmental remediation projects for victims of industrial pollution.

While the EPA does prioritize mines that are nearest to people's homes, MacMillan highlights some remote locations where people do live and yet have been neglected by the EPA. [[Cameron, Arizona]] is one such site which has a population of nearly 1000. Rancher Larry Gordy stumbled across an abandoned uranium mine on his grazing land for his cattle near Cameron in the summer of 2010. There are still no warning signs in the town of Cameron to alert people of potential contamination.
On December 30, 2010 Scientific American published an article entitled "Abandoned Uranium Mines: An 'Overwhelming Problem' in the Navajo Nation"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Francie Diep|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=abandoned-uranium-mines-a|title= Abandoned Uranium Mines: An "Overwhelming Problem" in the Navajo Nation|publisher=Scientific American|date=December 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Francie Diep. Diep told Gordy's story and reported that the EPA assessed his site on November 9, 2010. Diep suggested that this date was moved up due to publicity of Gordy's story; originally the EPA had promised to visit within six months of his original discovery of the uranium mine.

Similar allegations of prioritization due to negative publicity for the EPA were made of the Skyline Mine in the Oljato Mesa. Elsie Begay, a 71-year-old Navajo woman from the Oljato region was the topic of a series of articles in [[The Los Angeles Times]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/la-na-navajo19nov19,0,5351917.story |title=A peril that dwelt among the Navajos |publisher=latimes.com |date=2006-11-19 |accessdate=2012-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; These articles were written by Yellow Dirt: An American Story of a Poisoned Land and a People Betrayed (2010) author Judy Pasternak, whose work on these articles led to her book. One EPA representative, Jason Musante, stated this publicity "might have bumped the site up the priority list."

Over a year after Gordy stumbled across the mine in his cattle's grazing land, MacMillan reports that the site at Cameron has yet to be given a priority by the EPA. When EPA officials were asked to accompany a reporter to the Cameron site, the officials declined and instead offered to visit the newly cleaned site in Oljato. MacMillan spoke with a Navajo hotel manager near the Skyline Mine who expressed hesitation about the EPAs remediation, stating, "That's what they want you to see: something that's all nice and cleaned up." MacMillan drew attention to the fact that cows are grazing on contaminated land and people are eating these cattle. Taylor McKinnon, a director at the [[Center for Biological Diversity]], went so far as to say the site was the "worst he had seen in the Southwest." Although the locally grown beef is tested, standard tests for meat do not include checking for radioactive substances like uranium. The EPA has put an emphasis on health effects throughout its five-year plan, so the lack of any sort of attention in this matter has raised eyebrows.

In addition to the questioning of political bias in the prioritization of mining sites, there is criticism of the EPA's decision to revisit a 1989 permit proposing to mine for uranium near Church Rock. [[New Mexico]]'s [[KUNM]] radio station reported on May 9, 2012 that Uranium Resources Incorporated has expressed interest in starting production near Church Rock by the end of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://kunm.org/post/epa-revisits-permit-what-could-be-first-new-wave-uranium-mines |title=EPA Revisits Permit for What Could Be First in New Wave of Uranium Mines |publisher=KUNM |date=2012-05-09 |accessdate=2012-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; An online petition has already gained nearly 10,000 signatures against this new mining initiative.

==Navajo treatment, impact and response==
Beginning in the 1960s, uranium miners were beginning to become ill with cancer at increasing rates.&lt;ref name=Brugge/&gt; The state of Utah did not recognize radiation exposure at the time as a category of illness, making workers compensation unattainable for many of the sick Navajo (Dawson and Madsen 2007). Private industry's treatment of the Navajo workers was poor, according to recent standards: companies failed to educate workers on precautionary measures, did not install sufficient [[engineering]] controls, such as adequate ventilation; and did not provide sufficient safety equipment to protect workers to the known dangers related to the mines.&lt;ref name=Dawson2&gt;Dawson, Susan E. "Navajo Uranium Workers and the Effects of Occupational Illnesses: A Case Study," ''Human Organization'' Vol. 51, number 4, 1992: 389-397.&lt;/ref&gt; The Navajo were never told of the radiation effects, and did not have a word for it in their [[language]]. Many Navajo did not speak [[English language|English]] and trusted the uranium companies to have their interests in mind.&lt;ref name=Dawson2/&gt; Navajo workers and residents have felt betrayed as the results of the studies became known, as well as the long delays by companies and the US government to try to prevent the damage, and to pay compensation.&lt;ref name=Dawson2/&gt; Lung cancer became so prevalent among the Navajo people that working in uranium mines was banned on Navajo lands in 2005.&lt;ref name="Fettus"/&gt;

===Allegations of racism===
White workers also faced different conditions: Navajo workers were forced to enter the mine directly after a detonation, while it was filled with dust and smoke. However, the white workers were able to stay behind.&lt;ref name = Dawson2/&gt; Navajo miners were paid less than miners from off-reservation, well below minimum wage.{{sfn|Eichstaedt|1994|p=38}}&lt;ref name=Kuletz&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuletz|first=Valerie|title=The Tainted Desert|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|year=1998|page=25|ref=Kuletz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until radon exposure safety standards were imposed by the [[United States Secretary of Labor|Secretary of Labor]] [[W. Willard Wirtz|Willard Wirtz]] over the objections of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] and the uranium mining industry in June, 1967,&lt;ref name=Pasternak3&gt;{{cite book|last=Pasternak |first=Judy |year=2010 |title=Yellow Dirt: A Poisoned Land and a People Betrayed|publisher=Free Press |isbn= 1416594825 |ref=pasternak|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eichstaedt|first=Peter|title=If You Poison Us: Uranium and Native Americans|publisher=Red Crane Books|location=Santa Fe, NM|year=1994|ref=Eichstaedt|pages=71, 74}}&lt;/ref&gt; mines lacked ventilation, exposing workers to [[radon]].

Widows of mine workers met to discuss their grief; they started a grassroots movement that eventually reached the Congressional floor.&lt;ref name=Brugge/&gt;

The [[Uranium mining and the Navajo people#Church Rock uranium mill spill|Church Rock uranium mill spill]] raised claims that race was a factor in the federal government's paying little attention to the disaster:

{{Quote|text=When there was a relatively minor problem at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, the entire attention of the Nation was focused on this location and the Federal and State assistance brought to bear to deal with it was extraordinary. When the largest release of radioactive material in the history of the United States occurs in Navajo country, however, the attention paid to it by the Federal and State authorities is minimal at best.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher=US Congress, House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, Subcommittee on Energy and the Environment|title=''Mill Tailings Dam Break at Church Rock, New Mexico''|date=October 22, 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|sign=[[Peter MacDonald (Navajo leader)|Peter MacDonald, Chairman of the Navajo Nation]]}}

===Enduring impact===
Many residents of the Navajo Nation have anxiety and concerns about the future because of large amounts of radioactive waste remaining. One Navajo Elder explains: "We, the elderlies, that resides around here don't know what was good and worst about the uranium. There were several deaths in this area that was affected by radiation or cancers. We need help. I lost my wife last year [to cancer] and now I am 87 years. My wife would have been 70 years old which made a lot of difference. I am lonely and can't get anywhere without her help. I was hurted and miserable."&lt;ref name=Dawson2/&gt; The number of cancer cases has continued to rise because of these conditions, as water, air and ground generally have been affected. In areas near uranium mills, residents suffer [[stomach cancer]] at rates 15 times those of the national level. In some areas, the frequency gets as high as 200 times the national average.&lt;ref name=Pasternak/&gt; Hundreds of abandoned uranium mines with exposed tailings remain unremediated in the Navajo Nation area posing a contamination hazard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Diep|first=Francie|date=December 30, 2010|title=Abandoned Uranium Mines: An "Overwhelming Problem" in the Navajo Nation|journal=Scientific American|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=abandoned-uranium-mines-a}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Near the former uranium mills, [[water contamination]] and contamination of rocks which many residents used to build their houses, continue to be problems.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/27/us/27navajo.html "Uranium contamination at Navajo Reservation"], ''New York Times,'' 27 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1995 report published by [[American Public Health Association]] found: "excess mortality rates for lung cancer, pneumoconioses and other respiratory diseases, and tuberculosis for Navajo uranium miners. Increasing duration of exposure to underground uranium mining was associated with increased mortality risk for all three diseases… The most important long-term mortality risks for the Navajo uranium miners continue to be lung cancer and pneumoconioses and other nonmalignant respiratory diseases." That is to say, not stomach cancer, which the Navajo people naturally have a higher rate of experiencing than the national US average.&lt;ref name="Roscoe"/&gt;

===Clean-up efforts===
Since 1994, the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA), along with the [[Navajo Nation]] Environmental Protection Agency, has been mapping areas affected with radioactivity. In 2007, they compiled an [[atlas]] of the abandoned uranium mills in order to rid the area of [[nuclear waste]].&lt;ref name=EPA&gt;United States Environmental Protection Agency. Addressing Uranium Contamination in Navajo Nation. October 7, 2009. http://www.epa.gov/region09/superfund/navajo-nation/index.html (accessed November 17, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the EPA implemented a five-year cleanup plan, focusing on the most pressing issues: contaminated water and structures. The EPA estimates that 30% of all Navajo people lack access to uncontaminated drinking water.&lt;ref name=EPA/&gt;

The EPA is targeting 500 abandoned uranium mills as another part of their five-year cleanup plan, with the goal of ridding the area of nuclear waste.&lt;ref name=EPA/&gt; Its priority was identification of contaminated water sources and structures; many of the latter have been destroyed and removed. In 2011, it completed a multi-year project of removing 20,000 cubic yards of contaminated earth out of the reservation, near the Skyline Mine, to controlled storage on the plateau.&lt;ref name="Fonseca"&gt;[http://www.chron.com/news/article/Navajo-woman-helps-prompt-uranium-mine-cleanup-2155858.php Felicia Fonseca, "Navajo woman helps prompt uranium mine cleanup"], Associated Press, carried in ''Houston Chronicle'', 5 September 2011, accessed 5 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, a $600 million settlement attempts to clean up 94 abandoned uranium mines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://azdailysun.com/lifestyles/health-med-fit/feds-agreement-reached-to-clean-up-abandoned-uranium-mines-on/article_9fb42856-0e34-585d-b25d-a7e5d1fec692.html |title=Feds: Agreement reached to clean up abandoned uranium mines on Navajo Nation|date=18 January 2017|work=[[Arizona Daily Sun]]|accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
