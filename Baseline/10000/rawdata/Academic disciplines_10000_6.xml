      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1440">In 1865, at [[Boston, Massachusetts]], a society for the study of social questions was organized and given the name  '''American Social Science Association'''. The group grew to where its membership totaled about 1,000 persons. About 30 corresponding members were located in [[Europe]].  It published annually the  ''[[Journal of Social Science]]''.  

Members of the group worked in five departments:  
* Education and art
* Health
* Trade and finance
* Social economy
* Jurisprudence

In 1898, the society founded the [[National Institute of Arts and Letters]] which developed into the [[The American Academy of Arts and Letters|American Academy of Arts and Letters]].

'''Apostatic selection''' is a form of negative [[frequency-dependent selection]]. It describes the survival of individual [[prey]] animals that are different (through [[mutation]]) from their species in a way that makes it more likely for them to be ignored by their [[predator]]s. It operates on [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic]] species, species which have different forms. In apostatic selection, the common forms of a species are preyed on more than the rarer forms, giving the rare forms a [[natural selection|selective advantage]] in the population.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford University Press. (2013). Oxford Reference. Retrieved 21 November 2013, from Apostatic Selection: http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095419471&lt;/ref&gt;  It has also been discussed that apostatic selection acts to stabilize prey polymorphisms.

Apostatic selection was used in 1962 by [[Bryan Clarke]] in reference to predation on polymorphic [[grove snail]]s and since then it has been used interchangeably with negative frequency-dependent selection.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, B. 1962. Balanced polymorphism and the diversity of sympatric species. Pp. 47–70 in D. Nichols ed. Taxonomy and Geography. Systematics Association, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;  The behavioural basis of apostatic selection was initially ignored, but eventually established by A.B Bond&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=J.M|date=May 1984|title=Apostatic Selection on Prey that Match the Background|url=https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1095-8312.1984.tb00140.x|journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society|volume=23|pages=221–228|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apostatic selection can also apply to the predator if the predator has various morphs. There are multiple concepts that are closely linked with apostatic selection. One is the idea of prey switching, which is another term used to look at a different aspect of the same phenomenon, as well as the concept of a [[search image]].  Search images are relevant to apostatic selection as it is how a predator is able to detect an organism as a possible prey. Apostatic selection is important in [[evolution]] because it can sustain a stable equilibrium of morph frequencies, and hence maintains large amounts of genetic diversity in natural populations.&lt;ref name=allen&gt;Allen, J.A. (1988) Frequency-dependent selection by predators. Philos. T. Roy. Soc. B 319, 485–503&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to note however, that a rare morph being present in a population does not always mean that apostatic selection will occur, and the rare morph could be targeted at a higher rate. From a predatory view, being able to select for rare morphs actually increases its own fitness&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rutz|first=Christian|date=8 May 2012|title=Predator Fitness Increases with Selectivity for Odd Prey|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982212003156|journal=Current Biology|volume=22|pages=820–824|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prey switching==

In [[prey switching]], predators switch from primary prey to an alternative food source for various reasons.&lt;ref name=suryan&gt;Suryan, R., Irons, D., &amp; Benson, J. (2000). Prey Switching and Variable Foraging Strategies of Black-Legged Kittiwakes and the Effect on Reproductive Success. The Condor , 374–384.&lt;/ref&gt; This is related to apostatic selection because when a rare morph is being selected for, it is going to increase in abundance in a specific population until it becomes recognized by a predator. Prey switching, therefore, seems to be a result of apostatic selection. Prey switching is related to prey preference as well as the abundance of the prey.&lt;ref name=suryan /&gt;

== Effects of Apostatic Selection and Polymorphisms on Populations ==
It has also been determined that apostatic selection causes stabilization of prey polymorphisms, and this is caused by limitations of the predators behaviours.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bond|first=A.B|date=15 August 2007|title=The Evolution of Color Polymorphism: Crypticity, Searching Images, and Apostatic Selection|url=|journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics|volume=38|pages=489–514|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the common prey type is more abundant, they should be able to produce more offspring and grow exponentially, at a much faster rate then those with the rare morph since they are in much smaller numbers. However, due to the fact that the common morph is preyed upon more frequently, it diminish the exponential rate that they are expected to reproduce in, thus maintaining the population in stable amounts of common and rare morphs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Essentially, unless and environmental change or a species evolves it produces a stable equilibrium.

==Search image==
[[File:Blue Tit (12416609855).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Blue tit]] searches for insect prey using a [[search image]], leaving scarcer types of prey untouched.]]

A search image is what an individual uses in order to detect their prey. For the predator to detect something as prey, it must fit their criteria. The rare morph of a species may not fit the search image, and thus not be seen as prey. This gives the rare morphs an advantage, as it takes time for the predator to learn a new search image.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fraser|first=B.A|last2=Hughes|first2=K.A|last3=Tosh|first3=D.N|last4=Rodd|first4=F.H|date=October 2013|title=The role of learning by a predator, Rivulus hartii, in the rare‐morph survival advantage in guppies|url=|journal=Journal of Evolutionary Biology|volume=26|pages=2597–2605|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Search image shift require multiple encounters with the new form of prey, and since a rare morph is typically not encountered multiple times, especially in a row the prey gets left undetected.  An example of this is how a [[Blue tit]] searches for insect prey using a [[search image]], leaving scarcer types of prey untouched. Predatory birds such as insect-eating [[Tit (bird)|tits (''Parus'')]] sometimes look only for a single cryptic type of prey even though there are other equally palatable cryptic prey present at lower density.&lt;ref&gt;Dukas, Reuven, Kamil, Alan. (2000). Limited attention: the constraint underlying search image. Behavioral Ecology, 192–199.&lt;/ref&gt; Luuk Tinbergen supposed that this was because the birds formed a [[search image]], a typical image of a prey that a predator can remember and use to spot prey when that image is common.&lt;ref&gt;Tinbergen, L. (1960). The natural control of insects in pine woods. Factors influencing the intensity of predation by songbirds. Arch. Neerl. Zool. 13:265–343.&lt;/ref&gt; Having a search image can be beneficial because it increases proficiency of a predator in finding a common morph type.&lt;ref name=paulson&gt;Paulson, D. (2013). Predator Polymorphism and Apostatic Selection. Society for the Study of Evolution , 269–277.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hypothesis for polymorphism==

Apostatic selection serves as a hypothesis for [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]] because the variation it causes in prey. It is an explanation for why external polymorphism exists and this theory has been tested many times. Apostatic selection has been referred to as "selection for variation in its own sake".&lt;ref name=paulson /&gt; Apostatic selection has been used as an explanation for many types of polymorphism, including diversity in tropical insects. Selection on different morphs in tropical insects is high because there is pressure for phenotypes to look as different as possible from all others because the insects that have the lowest density in a population are the ones that are preyed on the least.&lt;ref&gt;Rand, A. S. (1967). Predator–prey interactions and the evolution of aspect diversity. Atas do Simposio sobre a Biota Amaz6nica 5 (Zool.): 73–83.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental Mechanisms ==
In order for apostatic selection to occur, and for the rare morph to have the advantage a variety of criteria needs to be met. First, there needs to be polymorphism present. In addition, the prey present can not be in equal proportions, since then there would not be a benefit to be able to detect either one.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Merilaita|first=Sami|last2=Ruxton|first2=Graeme|date=January 2009|title=Optimal apostatic selection: how should predators adjust to variation in prey frequencies?|url=|journal=Elsevier|volume=77|pages=239–245|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is related to frequency dependent predation, where as the predator obtains the greatest advantage from having a [[search image]] for the most common type of prey. This causes the most common form of  the prey is the most vulnerable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Horst|first=Jonathan|last2=Venable|first2=D.L|date=January 2018|title=Frequency‐dependent seed predation by rodents on Sonoran Desert winter annual plants|url=|journal=Ecology- Biological Society of America|volume=99|pages=196–203|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in prey detection of predators occurs, but the speed in which it occurs and the flexibility a predators search image in dependent on the environment.

If the frequency of the different prey types is continuously changes, the predator is not able to change their behavior at a rate in which will provide an advantage.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In these situations, the predators who show a more flexible behaviour and have a more broad [[search image]] are able to survive. In relation to apostatic selection, large changes in prey frequencies decreases the magnitude of the advantage of the rare morph if their predators have a flexible [[search image]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Also, the high changes in polymorphism frequencies can be an advantage to the prey with the rare morph. This is because the predators without the flexibility of their [[search image]] would have to have many encounters with the rare morph to change its [[search image]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Predators need multiple consistent encounters with a prey in order to form its [[search image]] around it.

Apostatic selection is also dependent on temporal variation. Since long periods of time are required for natural selection to act on predators, their degree of flexibility in their search image &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; can not be changed over a short time frame.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Therefore quickly arising rare morphs favors apostatic selection since the predators are not able to change their behavior and search image in that time frame. This is yet another biological process that is a victim to evolutionary time delay.

The predators are more quickly to adapt and decrease apostatic selection when a drastic and abrupt change to the prey frequencies occur.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This does not change the flexibility of the predators, but elicits a very high speed in the change of the search image.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Apostatic selection is most strong in environments in which the prey with the rare morphism match the background.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Behavioural Basis of Apostatic Selection ==
Most of the work done on the behavioural basis of apostatic selection was done by A.B Bond. It has been suggested that for frequency dependent predation, the amount of encounters with the prey aids to shape the predators prey detection.These ideas are based on the assumption that when the predator is learning foraging behaviour, they are going to obtain the common form more frequently. Since the predator is going to learn what is most frequently and commonly captured, the most common morph is what is identified as prey.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This concludes that their foraging behaviour is shaped by this learned preference, thus causing apostatic selection and a fitness benefit to the rare morphs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; From this, it was concluded that this search image formation and adaption is the mechanism that drives the most common prey type to be more easily distinguished from the environment, and thus be eaten more frequently.

==Experimental evidence==

Various types of experiments have been done to look into apostatic selection. Some involve artificial prey because it is a lot easier to control external variables in a simulated environment, though using wild specimens increases the studies [[external validity]] Often a computer screen simulation program is used on animals, often birds of prey, to detect for selection.&lt;ref name=Bond&gt;Bond, A., &amp; Kamil, A. (1998). Apostatic selection by blue jays produces balanced polymorphism in virtual prey. Nature , 594–596.&lt;/ref&gt; Another type looks into how apostatic selection can focus on the predator as well as the prey because predator plumage polymorphism can be another example of how apostatic selection works in a population. They hypothesized that a mutant predator morph will become more abundant in a population due to apostatic selection because the prey will not be able to recognize it as often as the common predator morph&lt;ref name=fowlie&gt;Fowlie, M., &amp; Kruger, O. (2003). The Evolution of plumage polymorphism in birds of prey and owls: the apostatic selection hypothesis revisited. Journal of Evolutionary Biology , 577–583.&lt;/ref&gt; '''.''' Apostatic selection has been observed in both humans and animals, proving that it is not exclusive to lower level organisms, and the cognition it uses is applicable to all organisms in which can display learning. Though a lot of this work has been experimental and lab controlled, there are some examples of it happening with both wild specimens and in the natural habitat of the species.

In [[hawk]]s, almost all of their polymorphism is found on their ventral side it allows for less common coloration to be favored since it will be recognized least.&lt;ref name=paulson /&gt; Polymorphism is defined by foraging strategies, one of which is apostatic selection.&lt;ref name=fowlie /&gt; Because of the different morphs and the varying selection on them, changes in prey detection maintain prey polymorphism due to apostatic selection.&lt;ref name=Bond /&gt;

Apostatic selection can be reflected in [[Batesian mimicry]]. [[Aposematism]] and apostatic selection is used to explain defensive signaling like [[Batesian mimicry]] in certain species.&lt;ref name=matthews&gt;Matthews, E. G. (1997). Signal-based frequency-dependent defense strategies and the evolution of mimicry. The American Naturalist, 213–222.&lt;/ref&gt; A paper by Pfenning et al., 2006 looks into this concept. In allopatric situations, situations where separate species overlap geographically, mimic phenotypes have a really high fitness and are selected for when their model is present but when it is absent, they suffer intense predation. In this article it was suggested that this is caused by apostatic selection because strength of selection is higher on the mimics that are hidden by their original model.&lt;ref&gt;Pfenning, D., Harper, G., Brumo, A., Harcombe, W., &amp; Pfenning, K. (2007). Population differences in predation on batesian mimics in allopatry with their model. Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology , 505–511.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Batesian mimicry, if the mimic is less common than the model, then the rare mimic phenotype is favored because the predator has continued reinforcement that the prey is harmful or unpalatable. When the mimic becomes more common than the model, it switches and is preyed upon much more often. Therefore, the dishonest signals in prey can be selected for or against depending on predation pressure.&lt;ref name=matthews /&gt;

An example in birds is observed within ground dwelling passerines, in which the wild birds were kept in their natural habitat but were presented with dimorphic prey (artificial).&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=November 1968|title=Evidence of Apostatic Selection by Wild Passerines|url=|journal=Nature|volume=220|pages=501–502|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two colors of prey were present in 9:1 ratios, and then the prey were switched so both colors were in the higher and lower ratio.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In all four of the passerine species that were observed, the more common morph of the artifical prey were consumed more frequently. regardless of the color of it.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This study also had a second component in which they allowed the birds to become familiar with one color of the prey, and then presented the dimorphic prey in equal amounts. In this case, the passerines consumed more of the prey that they were accustomed too.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This is consistent with the idea that the search image influences apostatic selection, and the more familiar form is encountered more making it preferred.

Apostatic selection has also been studied in cichlid fish, which presents a rare polymorphism, the gold ('Midas') colour morph.They discussed how apostatic selection a plausible mechanism for the maintenance of this Midas morph, and ruled out various other explanations for this morph. It was concluded that the rare morph is established by a difference in the predators detection probability of the Midas morph.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Torres-Dowall|first=Julian|last2=Golcher-Benavides|first2=Jimena|last3=Machado-Schiaffino|first3=Gonzalo|last4=Meyer|first4=Axel|date=September 2017|title=The role of rare morph advantage and conspicuousness in the stable gold‐dark colour polymorphism of a crater lake Midas cichlid fish|url=|journal=Journal of Animal Ecology|volume=86|pages=1044–1053|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One limitation of this study is that since the morphs in the wild are not able to be manipulated, no definite conclusions can be made, but the evidence predicts apostatic selection.

'''Biological network inference''' is the process of making [[inference]]s and predictions about [[biological network]]s.

==Biological networks==
A network is a set of nodes and a set of directed or undirected edges between the nodes. Many types of biological networks exist, including transcriptional, signalling and metabolic. Few such networks are known in anything approaching their complete structure, even in the simplest [[bacteria]]. Still less is known on the parameters governing the behavior of such networks over time, how the networks at different levels in a cell interact, and how to predict the complete state description of a [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] cell or bacterial organism at a given point in the future. [[Systems biology]], in this sense, is still in its infancy.

There is great interest in [[network medicine]] for the [[modelling biological systems]]. This article focuses on a necessary prerequisite to dynamic modeling of a network: inference of the [[topology]], that is, prediction of the "wiring diagram" of the network. More specifically, we focus here on inference of biological network structure using the growing sets of high-throughput expression data for [[gene]]s, [[protein]]s, and [[metabolism|metabolites]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tieri P, Farina L, Petti M, Astolfi L, Paci P, Castiglione F | title = Network Inference and Reconstruction in Bioinformatics | journal = Encyclopedia of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology | volume = 2 | pages = 805-813 | date = 2018 | doi = 10.1016/B978-0-12-809633-8.20290-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Briefly, methods using high-throughput data for inference of regulatory networks rely on searching for patterns of partial correlation or conditional probabilities that indicate causal influence.&lt;ref name="Marbach2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marbach D, Costello JC, Küffner R, Vega NM, Prill RJ, Camacho DM, Allison KR, Kellis M, Collins JJ, Stolovitzky G | title = Wisdom of crowds for robust gene network inference | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 9 | issue = 8 | pages = 796–804 | date = August 2012 | pmid = 22796662 | pmc = 3512113 | doi = 10.1038/nmeth.2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | vauthors = Sprites P, Glamour C, Scheines R | year = 2000 | title = Causation, Prediction, and Search: Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning | edition = 2nd | publisher = [[MIT Press]] | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such patterns of partial correlations found in the high-throughput data, possibly combined with other supplemental data on the genes or proteins in the proposed networks, or combined with other information on the organism, form the basis upon which such [[algorithm]]s work. Such algorithms can be of use in inferring the topology of any network where the change in state of one [[Node (networking)|node]] can affect the state of other nodes.

===Transcriptional regulatory networks===
Genes are the nodes and the edges are directed. A gene serves as the source of a direct regulatory edge to a target gene by producing an [[RNA]] or protein molecule that functions as a transcriptional activator or inhibitor of the target gene. If the gene is an activator, then it is the source of a positive regulatory connection; if an inhibitor, then it is the source of a negative regulatory connection. Computational algorithms take as primary input data measurements of [[mRNA]] expression levels of the genes under consideration for inclusion in the network, returning an estimate of the network [[topology]]. Such algorithms are typically based on linearity, independence or normality assumptions, which must be verified on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Oates CJ, Mukherjee S | title = Network Inference and Biological Dynamics | journal = The Annals of Applied Statistics | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 1209–1235 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 23284600 | doi = 10.1214/11-AOAS532 | last-author-amp = yes | arxiv = 1112.1047 | pmc=3533376}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clustering or some form of statistical classification is typically employed to perform an initial organization of the high-throughput mRNA expression values derived from microarray experiments, in particular to select sets of genes as candidates for network nodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Guthke R, Möller U, Hoffmann M, Thies F, Töpfer S | title = Dynamic network reconstruction from gene expression data applied to immune response during bacterial infection | journal = Bioinformatics | volume = 21 | issue = 8 | pages = 1626–34 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15613398 | doi = 10.1093/bioinformatics/bti226 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The question then arises: how can the clustering or classification results be connected to the underlying biology? Such results can be useful for pattern classification – for example, to classify subtypes of [[cancer]], or to predict differential responses to a [[drug]] (pharmacogenomics). But to understand the relationships between the genes, that is, to more precisely define the influence of each gene on the others, the scientist typically attempts to reconstruct the transcriptional regulatory network. This can be done by data integration in dynamic models supported by background literature, or information in public [[database]]s, combined with the clustering results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hecker M, Lambeck S, Toepfer S, van Someren E, Guthke R | title = Gene regulatory network inference: data integration in dynamic models-a review | journal = Bio Systems | volume = 96 | issue = 1 | pages = 86–103 | date = April 2009 | pmid = 19150482 | doi = 10.1016/j.biosystems.2008.12.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The modelling can be done by a [[Boolean network]], by [[Ordinary differential equation]]s or [[Linear regression]] models, e.g. [[Least-angle regression]], by [[Bayesian network]] or based on [[Information theory]] approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van Someren EP, Wessels LF, Backer E, Reinders MJ | title = Genetic network modeling | journal = Pharmacogenomics | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = 507–25 | date = July 2002 | pmid = 12164774 | doi = 10.1517/14622416.3.4.507 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance it can be done by the application of a correlation-based inference algorithm, as will be discussed below, an approach which is having increased success as the size of the available microarray sets keeps increasing &lt;ref name="Marbach2012" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Faith JJ, Hayete B, Thaden JT, Mogno I, Wierzbowski J, Cottarel G, Kasif S, Collins JJ, Gardner TS | title = Large-scale mapping and validation of Escherichia coli transcriptional regulation from a compendium of expression profiles | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = e8 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17214507 | pmc = 1764438 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0050008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hayete B, Gardner TS, Collins JJ | title = Size matters: network inference tackles the genome scale | journal = Molecular Systems Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = 77 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17299414 | pmc = 1828748 | doi = 10.1038/msb4100118 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Signal transduction===
[[Signal transduction]] networks (very important in the biology of cancer). Proteins are the nodes and directed edges represent interaction in which the biochemical conformation of the child is modified by the action of the parent (e.g. mediated by [[phosphorylation]], ubiquitylation, methylation, etc.). Primary input into the inference algorithm would be data from a set of experiments measuring protein activation / inactivation (e.g., phosphorylation / dephosphorylation) across a set of proteins. Inference for such signalling networks is complicated by the fact that total concentrations of signalling proteins will fluctuate over time due to transcriptional and translational regulation. Such variation can lead to statistical [[confounding]]. Accordingly, more sophisticated statistical techniques must be applied to analyse such datasets.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal | vauthors = Oates CJ, Mukherjee S | year = 2012 | title = Structural inference using nonlinear dynamics | journal = CRiSM Working Paper | volume = 12 | issue = 7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metabolic===
[[Metabolite]] networks. Metabolites are the nodes and the edges are directed. Primary input into an algorithm would be data from a set of experiments measuring metabolite levels.

===Protein-protein interaction===
Protein-protein interaction networks are also under very active study. However, reconstruction of these networks does not use correlation-based inference in the sense discussed for the networks already described (interaction does not necessarily imply a change in protein state), and a description of such interaction network reconstruction is left to other articles.

The '''British Oceanographic Data Centre''' ('''BODC''') is a national facility for looking after and distributing [[data]] about the [[marine (ocean)|marine]] environment. BODC is the designated marine science data centre for the [[UK]] and part of the [[Natural Environment Research Council]] (NERC). The centre provides a resource for science, education and industry, as well as the general public. BODC is hosted by the [[National Oceanography Centre]] (NOC) — primarily at its facility in [[Liverpool]], with small number of its staff in [[Southampton]].

[[File:Bidston Observatory.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Bidston Observatory, home of BODC from 1975 to 2004.]]
[[File:Joseph Proudman Building.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Joseph Proudman Building, Liverpool.]]

== History ==
The origins of BODC go back to 1969 when NERC created the '''British Oceanographic Data Service''' ('''BODS'''). Located at the National Institute of [[Oceanography]], [[Wormley, Surrey|Wormley]] in [[Surrey]], its purpose was to: 
* Act as the UK's National Oceanographic Data Centre
* Participate in the international exchange of data as part of the [[Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission]] (IOC) network of national data centres

In 1975 BODS was transferred to [[Bidston]] Observatory on the [[Wirral Peninsula|Wirral]], near Liverpool, as part of the newly formed Institute of Oceanographic Sciences. The following year BODS became the Marine Information and Advisory Service (MIAS)[http://www.soton.ac.uk/library/about/nol/mias.html]. Its primary activity was to manage the data collected from weather ships, [[Oil platform|oil rigs]] and [[Data Buoys|data buoys]].
The data banking component of MIAS was restructured to form BODC in April 1989. Its mission was to 'operate as a world-class data centre in support of UK marine science'. BODC pioneered a start to finish approach to marine data management. This involved:
* Assisting in the collection of data at sea
* Quality control of data
* Assembling the data for use by the scientists
* The publication of data sets on [[CD-ROM]]
In December 2004, BODC moved to the purpose-built [[Joseph Proudman]] Building on the campus of the [[University of Liverpool]]. A small number of its staff are based in the [[National Oceanography Centre]] (NOC), Southampton.

== Aims ==
* Work alongside scientists during marine research projects
* Provide quality control and archiving of oceanographic data
* Maintain an online source of information and improve public access to marine data
* Provide innovative marine data products

== National role ==
[[File:Current meter inventory.jpg|250px|right|thumb|BODC [[current meter]] data holdings from around the UK.]]
BODC is one of six designated data centres that manage NERC's environmental data and has a number of national roles and responsibilities:
* Performing data management for NERC-funded marine projects
* Maintaining and developing its archive of marine data, the '''National Oceanographic Database''' ('''NODB''')
* Managing, checking and archiving data from [[tide gauge]]s around the UK coast for the [[UK National Tide Gauge Network|National Tide Gauge Network]], which aims to obtain high quality [[tidal]] information and to provide warning of possible flooding of coastal areas around the British Isles. This  is part of the [[National Tidal and Sea Level Facility|National Tidal &amp; Sea Level Facility]] (NTSLF)
* Hosting the Marine Environmental Data and Information Network ([http://www.oceannet.org/ MEDIN])
* Working in partnership with other NERC marine research centres:
** [[British Antarctic Survey]] (BAS)
** [[National Oceanography Centre]] (NOC), Liverpool, formerly [[Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory]] (POL)
** [[National Oceanography Centre]] (NOC), Southampton
** [[Plymouth Marine Laboratory]] (PML)
** [[Scottish Association for Marine Science]] (SAMS)
** [[Sea Mammal Research Unit]] (SMRU)

== International role ==
BODC's international roles and responsibilities include:
* Contributing to the [[International Council for the Exploration of the Sea]] (ICES) Marine Data Management
* Creating, maintaining and publishing the [[General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans]] (GEBCO) Digital Atlas
* BODC is one of over 60 national oceanographic data centres that form part of the IOC [[International Oceanographic Data and Information Exchange]] (IODE)

==Projects and initiatives==
The following are a selection of the projects that BODC is or has been involved with:

Common misunderstandings include the following ideas:
# Every aspect of the biology of an [[organism]] can be predicted from its [[gene]]s
# Single genes code for specific [[anatomy|anatomical]] or [[ethology|behavioural]] features
# Genes are a [[blueprint]] of an organism's form and behaviour
# Genes are uninterrupted sections of [[DNA]] that only code for a single [[protein]]

==Genetic determinism==
{{Main|Genetic determinism}}
While there are many examples of animals that display certain well-defined behaviour that is genetically programmed,&lt;ref&gt;For example, [http://www.personalityresearch.org/evolutionary/sphexishness.html see this discussion] of the behaviour of the [[Sphex|digger wasp]]&lt;/ref&gt; these examples have been extrapolated to a popular misconception that all patterns of behaviour, and more generally the [[phenotype]], are rigidly genetically determined. There is good evidence that some basic aspects of human behaviour, such as [[circadian rhythm]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Florez JC, Takahashi JS |title=The circadian clock: from molecules to behaviour |journal=Ann. Med. |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=481–90 |date=August 1995 |pmid=8519510 |doi=10.3109/07853899509002457 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are genetically-based, but it is clear that many other aspects are not.

In the first place, much phenotypic variability does not stem from genes themselves. For example:
# [[Epigenetic inheritance]]. In the widest definition this includes all biological inheritance mechanisms that do not change the DNA sequence of the [[genome]]. In a narrower definition it excludes biological phenomena such as the effects of [[prions]] and maternal antibodies which are also inherited and have clear survival implications.
# [[Learning|Learning from experience]]. This is obviously a very important feature of humans, but there is considerable evidence of learned behaviour in other animal species ([[vertebrate]]s and [[invertebrate]]s). There are even reports of learned behaviour in ''[[Drosophila]]'' [[larva]]e.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gerber B, Hendel T |title=Outcome expectations drive learned behaviour in larval Drosophila |journal=Proc. Biol. Sci. |volume=273 |issue=1604 |pages=2965–8 |date=December 2006 |pmid=17015355 |pmc=1639518 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2006.3673 |url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=17015355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==A gene for X==
In the early years of genetics it was suggested that there might be "a gene for" a wide range of particular characteristics. This was partly because the examples studied from [[Gregor Mendel|Mendel]] onwards inevitably focused on genes whose effects could be readily identified; partly that it was easier to teach science that way; and partly because the mathematics of evolutionary dynamics is simpler if there is a simple mapping between genes and phenotypic characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document

 | date=  October 2006
 | isbn = 0-674-02338-2
 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These have led to the general perception that there is "a gene for" arbitrary traits,&lt;ref name=Bishop2010&gt;{{cite web
|last=Bishop
|first=Dorothy

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
leading to controversy in particular cases such as the purported "[[Biology and sexual orientation|gay gene]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
 | title = Doubt cast on 'gay gene'
 | publisher = [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]]
 | date=  1999-04-23
 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/325979.stm
 | accessdate = 2007-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in light of the known complexities of gene expression networks (and phenomena such as [[epigenetics]]), it is clear that instances where a single gene "codes for" a single, discernible phenotypic effect are rare, and that media presentations of "a gene for X" grossly oversimplify the vast majority of situations.

==Genes as a blueprint==
It is widely believed that genes provide a "blueprint" for the body in much the same way that [[architecture|architectural]] or [[mechanical engineering]] blueprints describe buildings or machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dusheck J |title=The interpretation of genes |journal=[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]] |volume=111 |pages=52–9 |year=2002 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1134/is_8_111/ai_92284523}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a superficial level, genes and conventional blueprints share the common property of being low [[dimension]]al (genes are organised as a one-dimensional string of [[nucleotide]]s;&lt;ref name=RD/&gt; blueprints are typically two-dimensional drawings on paper) but containing information about fully three-dimensional structures. However, this view ignores the fundamental differences between genes and blueprints in the nature of the mapping from low order information to the high order object.

In the case of biological systems, a long and complicated chain of interactions separates genetic information from [[macroscopic]] structures and functions. The following simplified diagram of causality illustrates this:

:Genes → Gene expression → Proteins → Metabolic pathways → Sub-cellular structures → Cells → Tissues → Organs → Organisms

Even at the small scale, the relationship between genes and proteins (once thought of as "[[one gene, one polypeptide]]")&lt;ref&gt;Evers, C. [http://www.accessexcellence.org/RC/AB/BC/One_Gene_One_Enzyme.html The One Gene/One Enzyme Hypothesis], [https://web.archive.org/web/20000303105015/http://www.nationalhealthmuseum.org/ National Health Museum], retrieved 12 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; is more complicated, because of [[alternative splicing]].

Also, the causal chains from genes to functionality are not separate or isolated but are entangled together, most obviously in [[metabolic pathway]]s (such as the [[Calvin cycle|Calvin]] and [[citric acid cycle|citric acid]] cycles) which link a succession of [[enzyme]]s (and, thus, gene products) to form a coherent [[biochemistry|biochemical]] system. Furthermore, information flow in the chain is not exclusively one-way. While the [[central dogma of molecular biology]] describes how information cannot be passed back to inheritable genetic information, the other causal arrows in this chain can be [[wikt:bidirectional|bidirectional]], with complex feedbacks ultimately regulating [[gene expression]].

Instead of being a simple, linear mapping, this complex relationship between genotype and phenotype is not straightforward to [[Code|decode]]. Rather than describing genetic information as a blueprint, some have suggested that a more appropriate [[analogy]] is that of a [[recipe]] for [[cooking]],&lt;ref name=RD&gt;{{cite book | first = Richard | last = Dawkins | authorlink = Richard Dawkins |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sPpaZnZMDG0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title = The Blind Watchmaker | publisher = W.

It is popularly supposed that a gene is "a linear sequence of nucleotides along a segment of DNA that provides the coded instructions for synthesis of RNA"&lt;ref&gt;gene. (n.d.). Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1). Retrieved 30 May 2007, from [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/gene Dictionary.com website]&lt;/ref&gt; and even some current medical dictionaries define a gene as "a hereditary unit that occupies a specific location on a chromosome, determines a particular characteristic in an organism by directing the formation of a specific protein, and is capable of replicating itself at each cell division."&lt;ref&gt;gene. (n.d.). The American Heritage Stedman's Medical Dictionary. Retrieved 30 May 2007, from [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/gene Dictionary.com website]&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, as the diagram illustrates schematically, genes are much more complicated and elusive concepts. A reasonable modern definition of a gene is "a locatable region of genomic sequence, corresponding to a unit of inheritance, which is associated with regulatory regions, transcribed regions and/or other functional sequence regions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pearson H |title=Genetics: What is a gene? |journal=Nature |volume=441 |issue= 7092|pages=398–401 |year=2006 |doi=10.1038/441398a |pmid=16724031|bibcode = 2006Natur.441..398P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This kind of misperception is perpetuated when mainstream media report that an organism's genome has been "deciphered" when they mean that it has simply been [[Sequencing|sequenced]].&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''[[The New York Times]]'' [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/01/science/01gene.html?ex=1338350400&amp;en=b0aff834ad39b962&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss Genome of DNA Discoverer Is Deciphered].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19096">The '''compact city''' or '''city of short distances''' is an [[urban planning]] and [[urban design]] concept, which promotes relatively high residential density with mixed land uses. It is based on an efficient public transport system and has an urban layout which – according to its advocates – encourages walking and cycling, low energy consumption and reduced pollution. A large resident population provides opportunities for social interaction as well as a feeling of safety in numbers and 'eyes on the street'.&lt;ref name = "jj"&gt;[[The Death and Life of Great American Cities]]'' (1961) New York: Random House. {{ISBN|0-679-60047-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also arguably a more sustainable urban settlement type than [[urban sprawl]] because it is less dependent on the car, requiring less (and cheaper per capita) infrastructure provision (Williams 2000, cited in Dempsey 2010).&lt;ref name = "nd"&gt;Dempsey, Nicola (2010) Revisiting the Compact City? Built Environment 36(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

Achieving a compact city does not just mean increasing [[urban density]] ''per se'' or across all parts of the city. It means good planning to achieve an ''overall'' more compact urban form:
{{quote| Governments of sprawling cities can take many actions to seek a more compact form, often also involving higher densities. Other cities, such as Cairo, with large, dense slum areas, are responding by reducing urban densities in core areas. In either case, limiting outward urban expansion can be combined with more efficient use of land resources and more effective protection of natural resources. City growth can be physically limited in this way through legislated urban growth boundaries, non-urban green belts, and the quarantining of development in certain areas.&lt;ref name="Routledge"&gt;{{Cite book | year=2013 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink1= Paul James (academic) | last2= Holden | first2=Meg | last3= Lewin | first3= Mary | last4= Neilson | first4= Lyndsay | last5= Oakley | first5= Christine | last6= Truter | first6= Art | last7= Wilmoth | first7= David | chapter= Managing Metropolises by Negotiating Mega-Urban Growth | title= Institutional and Social Innovation for Sustainable Urban Development | editor= Harald Mieg and Klaus Töpfer | url=https://www.academia.edu/7207756/Managing_Metropolises_by_Negotiating_Mega-Urban_Growth | publisher= Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Origins==

The term ''compact city'' was first coined in 1973 by [[George Dantzig]] and [[Thomas L. Saaty]],&lt;ref&gt;Dantzig, G. B. and Saaty, T. L., 1973, ''Compact City: Plan for a Liveable Urban Environment'', W. H. Freeman, San Francisco.&lt;/ref&gt; two mathematicians whose utopian vision was largely driven by a desire to see more efficient use of resources. The concept, as it has influenced [[urban planning]], is often attributed to [[Jane Jacobs]] and her book ''[[The Death and Life of Great American Cities]]'' (1961),&lt;ref name ="jj"/&gt; a critique of [[modern architecture|modernist]] planning policies claimed by Jacobs to be destroying many existing [[inner-city]] communities.

Among other criticisms of the conventional planning and transport planning of the time, Jacobs' work attacked the tendency, inherited from the [[garden city movement]], towards reducing the density of dwellings in urban areas. Four conditions were necessary to enable the diversity essential for [[urban renewal]]: mixed uses, small walkable blocks, mingling of building ages and types, and "a sufficiently dense concentration of people". The 'sufficient' density would vary according to local circumstances but, in general, a hundred dwellings per acre (247 per hectare – high by American standards, but quite common in European and Asian cities) could be considered a minimum.

==The compact city and related concepts==

Although the concept of 'compact city' was coined by American writers, it has been used more in recent years by European and particularly British planners and academics. See, for example, the writings of Michael Jenks.&lt;ref&gt;Jenks, M., Burton, E. and Williams, K. (Editors), 1996, ''The Compact City: A Sustainable Urban Form?'', Spon Press; {{ISBN|0-419-21300-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In North America the term '[[smart growth]]' has become increasingly common linked to the concept of '[[smart city]]'. The concept of 'smart growth' is very similar to 'compact city', although 'smart growth' carries more strongly normative connotations, implicitly accepting the emphasis in current mainstream debates that growth is necessary and good. The term is often used loosely to accommodate these debates&lt;ref&gt;[ See for example, https://www.theatlantic.com/life/archive/2011/07/the-countrys-most-ambitious-smart-growth-project/242549/ Kaid Benfield, "The Country's Most Ambitious Smart Growth Project", ''The Atlantic'', July 26, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cognate concepts include 'sustainable urban development' with no presumption that development equals growth.&lt;ref name="Routledge"&gt;{{Cite book | year=2013 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink1= Paul James (academic) | last2= Holden | first2=Meg | last3= Lewin | first3= Mary | last4= Neilson | first4= Lyndsay | last5= Oakley | first5= Christine | last6= Truter | first6= Art | last7= Wilmoth | first7= David | chapter= Managing Metropolises by Negotiating Mega-Urban Growth | title= Institutional and Social Innovation for Sustainable Urban Development | editor= Harald Mieg and Klaus Töpfer | url=https://www.academia.edu/7207756/Managing_Metropolises_by_Negotiating_Mega-Urban_Growth | publisher= Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another alternative concept is 'green urbanism'. [[Steffen Lehmann]] has extensively written about the compact city and green urbanism. His work presents a series of international case studies and outlines 15 core principles for the design of compact, sustainable cities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sapiens.revues.org/1057; Lehmann, S. (2010) Green urbanism: Formulating a series of holistic principles]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. ''S.A.P.I.EN.S'' '''3''' (2)''The Principles of Green Urbanism'' (Earthscan, 2010; {{ISBN|978-1-84407-817-2}})&lt;/ref&gt;

==The compact city, urban sprawl and automobile dependency==

Whether the compact city (or '[[smart growth]]') does or can reduce problems of [[automobile dependency]] associated with [[urban sprawl]] has been fiercely contested over several decades. An influential study in 1989 by [[Peter Newman (environmental scientist)|Peter Newman]] and Jeff Kenworthy compared 32 cities across North America, Australia, Europe and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Petrol use urban density.svg|''Cities and Automobile Dependence: An International Sourcebook'', Newman P and Kenworthy J, Gower, Aldershot, 1989.]]&lt;/ref&gt; The study's methodology has been criticised&lt;ref&gt;MINDALI, O., RAVEH, A. and SALOMON, I., 2004. Urban density and energy consumption: a new look at old statistics. Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, 38(2), pp. 143-162.&lt;/ref&gt; but the main finding that denser cities, particularly in Asia, have lower car use than sprawling cities, particularly in North America, has been largely accepted – although the relationship is clearer at the extremes across continents than it is within countries where conditions are more similar.

Within cities, studies from across many countries (mainly in the developed world) have shown that denser urban areas with greater mixture of land use and better public transport tend to have lower car use than less dense [[suburb]]an and [[exurb]]an residential areas. This usually holds true even after controlling for socio-economic factors such as differences in household composition and income.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. FRANK, L. and PIVOT, G., 1994. Impact of Mixed Use and Density on Three Modes of Travel. Transportation Research Record, 1446, pp. 44-52.&lt;/ref&gt; This does not necessarily imply that suburban sprawl causes high car use, however. One confounding factor, which has been the subject of many studies, is residential self-selection:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/title~db=all~content=g910669635 Transport Reviews Volume 29 Issue 3 (2009)] was entirely devoted to this issue&lt;/ref&gt; people who prefer to drive tend to move towards low density suburbs, whereas people who prefer to walk, cycle or use transit tend to move towards higher density urban areas, better served by public transport. Some studies have found that, when self-selection is controlled for, the built environment has no significant effect on travel behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Bagley, M.N. and Mokhtarian, P.L. (2002) The impact of residential neighborhood type on travel behavior: A structural equations modeling approach. Annals of Regional Science36 (2), 279.&lt;/ref&gt; More recent studies using more sophisticated methodologies have generally refuted these findings: density, land use and public transport accessibility can influence travel behaviour, although social and economic factors, particularly household income, usually exert a stronger influence.&lt;ref&gt;''e.g.'' Handy, S., Cao, X. and Mokhtarian, P.L. (2005) Correlation or causality between the built environment and travel behavior? Evidence from Northern California. Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment10 (6), 427-444.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The paradox of intensification==

Reviewing the evidence on urban intensification, smart growth and their effects on travel behaviour, Melia ''et al.'' (2011)&lt;ref&gt;[http://eprints.uwe.ac.uk/10555/2/melia-barton-parkhurst_The_Paradox_of_Intensification.pdf Melia, S., Barton, H. and Parkhurst, G. (In Press) The Paradox of Intensification. Transport Policy 18 (1)]&lt;/ref&gt; found support for the arguments of both supporters and opponents of the compact city. Planning policies which increase population densities in urban areas do tend to reduce car use, but the effect is a weak one, so doubling the population density of a particular area will not halve the frequency or distance of car use.

For example, [[Portland, Oregon]], a U.S. city which has pursued [[smart growth]] policies,{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainablefreedomlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/A-Portlanders-View-of-Smart-Growth.pdf|title=A Portlander’s View of Smart Growth|last=O’TOOLE|first=RANDAL|date=2004|website=Sustainable Freedom Lab|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; substantially increased its population density between 1990 and 2000 when other US cities of a similar size were reducing in density.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} As predicted by the paradox, traffic volumes and congestion both increased more rapidly than in the other cities, despite a substantial increase in transit use.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottbeyer/2017/03/29/portlands-urban-growth-boundary-a-driver-of-suburban-sprawl/#1e8bf28d6964|title=Portland's Urban Growth Boundary: A Driver of Suburban Sprawl|last=Beyer|first=Scott|date=29 March 2017|website=Forbes|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These findings led them to propose the paradox of intensification, which states:
{{quote|[[Ceteris paribus]], urban intensification which increases population density will reduce per capita car use, with benefits to the global environment, but will also increase concentrations of motor traffic, worsening the local environment in those locations where it occurs.}}

At the city-wide level it may be possible, through a range of positive measures, to counteract the increases in traffic and congestion which would otherwise result from increasing population densities: [[Freiburg im Breisgau]] in Germany is one example of a city which has been more successful in this respect.

This study also reviewed evidence on the local effects of building at higher densities. At the level of the neighbourhood or individual development, positive measures (e.g. improvements to public transport) will usually be insufficient to counteract the traffic effect of increasing population density. This leaves policy-makers with four choices: intensify and accept the local consequences, sprawl and accept the wider consequences, a compromise with some element of both, or intensify accompanied by more radical measures such as parking restrictions, closing roads to traffic and [[carfree zone]]s.

== Influence in Europe ==
The [[European Commission]] published the [[Green Paper]] ''Towards a new culture for urban mobility''&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52007DC0551:EN:NOT Green Paper - Towards a new culture for urban mobility, European Commission, 27 September 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; on 27 September 2007. Several institutions reacted&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/Result.do?direct=yes&amp;lang=en&amp;where=GRP_CITATION:52007DC0551&amp;whereihm=Instruments%20cited:52007DC0551 EU documents mentioning the 2007 European Commission Green Paper – Towards a new culture for urban mobility]&lt;/ref&gt; to the Green Paper among them the European Parliament.

Based on the preparatory work of its Committee on Transport and Tourism,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=REPORT&amp;reference=A6-2008-0252&amp;language=EN Draft Report on: Towards a new culture of urban mobility], Motion for a European Parliament resolution, In: 2008/2041(INI). European Parliament, Committee on Transport and Tourism, 27 February 2009, downloaded 25 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[European Parliament]] in its Resolution of 9 July 2008&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&amp;reference=P6-TA-2008-0356&amp;language=EN&amp;ring=A6-2008-0252 European Parliament resolution of 9 July 2008 on "Towards a new culture of urban mobility"]&lt;/ref&gt; called among other things for “drawing up customised sustainable mobility plans and supporting measures for regional and urban planning ('city of short distances'), a process in which all parties concerned should be involved from an early stage”. They referred among others to the EU strategy to combat climate change and other environmental problems.

===Influence in the Netherlands===

The Netherlands' urban planning is highly influenced by the 'compacte stad'. In the 1960s cities expanded in large, top-down planned neighbourhoods using the scarce space available to use as efficiently as possible. Later, cities weren't allowed to expand anyhow, giving way for completely new towns on moderate distances from the main city, in order to keep the new towns influenced mainly by their 'capital', however, giving the towns also some own air. Public transport between the main city and its towns in the rural areas connected them. This policy (''groeikernenbeleid'') resulted in typical commuter towns. Afterwards, in the 1980s, governments decided people need and want to live in this capital city itself and the groeikernenbeleid was rejected. New urban neighbourhoods had to be around a city, as a skin, encircling skins of older neighbourhoods. The new neighbourhoods were cleverly designed, relatively dense and with very good connections to get downtown by public transport or bicycle.

This history results in a lack of urban sprawl, or at least of new urban sprawl. As new neighbourhoods need to be built as an outer skin around existing settlements and as other policies prohibited establishing new settlements outside other towns or villages, no new linear villages could be founded without governmental intervention any more. This in order to keep the rural landscape 'clean' and cities dense and compact.

As a result, in Dutch towns all neighbourhoods are close to city centers, enabling inhabitants to get around quickly and cheaply by bike. Getting out of town doesn't involve driving through ever-ongoing sprawled suburbs, making it easy and popular to visit rural areas. By all these regulations, for instance the [[Groene Hart]] (Green Hart amid the Randstad) is kept green, while buffers around cities like [[Amsterdam]], [[Utrecht]] and [[Delft]] avoids getting the cities grown together entirely.

===Influence in the United Kingdom===

The compact city had a particularly strong influence on planning policy in the UK during the Labour Governments of 1997–2010. The first Labour Government in 1998 set up the Urban Taskforce under [[Richard Rogers|Lord Rogers of Riverside]], which produced the report [[Towards an Urban Renaissance]]. Influenced by this report, the UK Government issued [[PPG 3]] Planning Policy Guidance on Housing which introduced a 60% [[brownfield]] target, a minimum net residential density guideline of 30 dwellings per hectare, a sequential hierarchy beginning with urban [[brownfield land]], maximum parking guidelines replacing the previous minima, and a policy of intensification around public transport nodes. Over the succeeding years, these targets were substantially exceeded, with the brownfield proportion reaching 80% by 2009, and average densities 43 dwellings per hectare.&lt;ref&gt;Land Use Change Statistics (England) 2009 – provisional estimates (July 2010) [http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/statistics/lucs2009provisionaljuly Department of Communities and Local Government]&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Russia and other ex-Soviet countries ==

Most cities in [[Russia]] such as regional capitals [[Yaroslavl]], [[Krasnodar]], [[Novosibirsk]], etc., as well as cities and towns in other ex [[Eastern Block]] countries (such as [[Trencin]] or [[Zvolen]] in [[Slovakia]]) can be qualified as compact cities, where most people live in residential areas made up of big apartment blocks between 3 to 8 floors, in parks full of trees, flowers, playgrounds, benches, etc. with small shops and cafés on the ground level or in clusters around the main paths. Residents have thus much space to socialize. Cars typically only have limited access to the “inner garden ” that surrounds the apartment blocks and are limited to the main boulevards. The high population density means people have to walk smaller distances to get to the supermarket, school, kindergarten, pub, restaurant, grocery, library, gym, or access the public transportation system – a mix of public buses and tramway and private minibuses. Most people in those cities do not own a car and if they do, they use it only in the summer to drive to their [[dacha]] (cars are typically covered in 2–3 m of snow in winter). Living in apartments also means fewer losses of energy spent on heating, each apartment block having one central heating system in the basement that can be either publicly or privately run.

'''Computer science''' is the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of [[computer]]s. It involves the study of [[algorithm]]s that process, store, and communicate [[digital data|digital]] [[information]]. A [[computer scientist]] specializes in the theory of computation and the design of computational systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=computer%20scientist |title=WordNet Search—3.1 |publisher=Wordnetweb.princeton.edu |accessdate=14 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its fields can be divided into a variety of theoretical and [[practical disciplines]]. Some fields, such as [[computational complexity theory]] (which explores the fundamental properties of [[Computational problem|computational]] and intractable problems), are highly abstract, while fields such as [[Computer graphics (computer science)|computer graphics]] emphasize real-world visual applications. Other fields focus on challenges in implementing computation. For example, [[programming language theory]] considers various approaches to the description of computation, while the study of [[computer programming]] itself investigates various aspects of the use of [[programming language]]s and [[complex systems]]. [[Human–computer interaction]] considers the challenges in making computers and computations useful, usable, and [[Computer accessibility|universally accessible]] to humans.

[[File:Ada lovelace.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Ada Lovelace]] is often credited with publishing the first [[algorithm]] intended for processing on a computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerhistory.org/babbage/adalovelace/|title=Ada Lovelace {{!}}  Babbage Engine {{!}} Computer History Museum|website=www.computerhistory.org|access-date=28 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

The earliest foundations of what would become computer science predate the invention of the modern [[digital computer]]. Machines for calculating fixed numerical tasks such as the [[abacus]] have existed since antiquity, aiding in computations such as multiplication and division. Further, [[algorithm]]s for performing computations have existed since antiquity, even before the development of sophisticated computing equipment.

[[Wilhelm Schickard]] designed and constructed the first working [[mechanical calculator]] in 1623.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wilhelm Schickard – Ein Computerpionier|url=http://www.fmi.uni-jena.de/fmimedia/Fakultaet/Institute+und+Abteilungen/Abteilung+f%C3%BCr+Didaktik/GDI/Wilhelm+Schickard.pdf|language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1673, [[Gottfried Leibniz]] demonstrated a digital mechanical calculator, called the [[Stepped Reckoner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History of Computing|url=http://blogs.royalsociety.org/history-of-science/2012/06/25/history-of-computing/|first = Fiona|last = Keates|work = The Repository|publisher = The Royal Society|date = 25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He may be considered the first computer scientist and information theorist, for, among other reasons, documenting the binary number system. In 1820, [[Charles Xavier Thomas|Thomas de Colmar]] launched the [[mechanical calculator]] industry&lt;ref group=note&gt;In 1851&lt;/ref&gt; when he released his simplified [[arithmometer]], which was the first calculating machine strong enough and reliable enough to be used daily in an office environment. [[Charles Babbage]] started the design of the first ''automatic mechanical calculator'', his [[Difference Engine]], in 1822, which eventually gave him the idea of the first ''programmable mechanical calculator'', his [[Analytical Engine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/on-line/babbage/index.asp |title=Science Museum—Introduction to Babbage |accessdate=24 September 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908054017/http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/on-line/babbage/index.asp |archivedate=September 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started developing this machine in 1834, and "in less than two years, he had sketched out many of the [[wikt:Special:Search/salient|salient]] features of the modern computer".&lt;ref name="Hyman1982"&gt;{{cite book |author=Anthony Hyman |title=Charles Babbage, pioneer of the computer |year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; "A crucial step was the adoption of a punched card system derived from the [[Jacquard loom]]"&lt;ref name="Hyman1982" /&gt; making it infinitely programmable.&lt;ref group=note&gt;"The introduction of punched cards into the new engine was important not only as a more convenient form of control than the drums, or because programs could now be of unlimited extent, and could be stored and repeated without the danger of introducing errors in setting the machine by hand; it was important also because it served to crystallize Babbage's feeling that he had invented something really new, something much more than a sophisticated calculating machine." [[#COLLIER|Bruce Collier]], 1970&lt;/ref&gt; In 1843, during the translation of a French article on the Analytical Engine, [[Ada Lovelace]] wrote, in one of the many notes she included, an algorithm to compute the [[Bernoulli number]]s, which is considered to be the first computer program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottlan.edu/Lriddle/women/ada-love.htm |title=A Selection and Adaptation From Ada's Notes found in Ada, The Enchantress of Numbers," by Betty Alexandra Toole Ed.D.

In 1937, one hundred years after Babbage's impossible dream, [[Howard H. Aiken|Howard Aiken]] convinced IBM, which was making all kinds of punched card equipment and was also in the calculator business&lt;ref&gt;"In this sense Aiken needed IBM, whose technology included the use of punched cards, the accumulation of numerical data, and the transfer of numerical data from one register to another", [[#AIKEN|Bernard Cohen]], p.44 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; to develop his giant programmable calculator, the [[Harvard Mark I|ASCC/Harvard Mark I]], based on Babbage's Analytical Engine, which itself used cards and a central computing unit. When the machine was finished, some hailed it as "Babbage's dream come true".&lt;ref&gt;[[#ORIGINS|Brian Randell]], p. 187, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1940s, as new and more powerful [[computing]] machines were developed, the term ''computer'' came to refer to the machines rather than their human predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM) was founded in 1947.&lt;/ref&gt; As it became clear that computers could be used for more than just mathematical calculations, the field of computer science broadened to study [[computation]] in general. Computer science began to be established as a distinct academic discipline in the 1950s and early 1960s.&lt;ref name="Denning_cs_discipline"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/conference/EDSAC99/statistics.html |title=Some EDSAC statistics |publisher=University of Cambridge |accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The world's first computer science degree program, the [[Cambridge Diploma in Computer Science]], began at the [[University of Cambridge]] [[Cambridge Computer Lab|Computer Laboratory]] in 1953. The first computer science degree program in the United States was formed at [[Purdue University]] in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.purdue.edu/about/conte.html |title=Computer science pioneer Samuel D.

Although many initially believed it was impossible that computers themselves could actually be a scientific field of study, in the late fifties it gradually became accepted among the greater academic population.&lt;ref name="Levy1984"&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Steven Levy |last=Levy |first=Steven |title=Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution |year=1984 |isbn=978-0385191951 |publisher=Doubleday |title-link=Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tedre2014"&gt;{{cite book |last=Tedre |first=Matti |title=The Science of Computing: Shaping a Discipline |year=2014 |publisher=Taylor and Francis / CRC Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the now well-known [[IBM]] brand that formed part of the computer science revolution during this time. IBM (short for International Business Machines) released the IBM 704&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/computer-graphics-music-and-art/15/222/633 |title=IBM 704 Electronic Data Processing System—CHM Revolution |publisher=Computerhistory.org |accessdate=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later the IBM 709&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=IBM 709: a powerful new data processing system |publisher=Computer History Museum |url=http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/IBM/IBM.709.1957.102646304.pdf |accessdate=December 12, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304130040/http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/IBM/IBM.709.1957.102646304.pdf |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; computers, which were widely used during the exploration period of such devices. "Still, working with the IBM [computer] was frustrating […] if you had misplaced as much as one letter in one instruction, the program would crash, and you would have to start the whole process over again".&lt;ref name="Levy1984"/&gt; During the late 1950s, the computer science discipline was very much in its developmental stages, and such issues were commonplace.&lt;ref name="Tedre2014"/&gt;

Time has seen significant improvements in the usability and effectiveness of [[computing technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Timeline of Computer History|url = http://www.computerhistory.org/timeline/computers/|publisher = Computer History Museum|accessdate = November 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern society has seen a significant shift in the users of computer technology, from usage only by experts and professionals, to a near-[[ubiquitous]] user base. Initially, computers were quite costly, and some degree of humanitarian aid was needed for efficient use—in part from professional computer operators. As computer adoption became more widespread and affordable, less human assistance was needed for common usage.

===Contributions===
[[File:Enigma.jpg|thumb|upright|The German military used the [[Enigma machine]] (shown here) during [[World War II]] for communications they wanted kept secret. The large-scale decryption of Enigma traffic at [[Bletchley Park]] was an important factor that contributed to Allied victory in WWII.&lt;ref name="kahnbook"/&gt;]]

Despite its short history as a formal academic discipline, computer science has made a number of fundamental contributions to science and society—in fact, along with [[electronics]], it is a founding science of the current epoch of human history called the [[Information Age]] and a driver of the [[information revolution]], seen as the third major leap in human technological progress after the [[Industrial Revolution]] (1750–1850 CE) and the [[Neolithic Revolution|Agricultural Revolution]] (8000–5000 BC).

These contributions include:
* The start of the "[[Digital Revolution]]", which includes the current [[Information Age]] and the [[Internet]].&lt;ref name="bgu"&gt;{{cite web|title=Computer Science : Achievements and Challenges circa 2000 |url=http://www.cis.cornell.edu/Dean/Presentations/Slides/bgu.pdf |accessdate=January 11, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060911104502/http://www.cis.cornell.edu/Dean/Presentations/Slides/bgu.pdf |archivedate=September 11, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Computer graphics]] and [[computer-generated imagery]] have become ubiquitous in modern entertainment, particularly in television, [[Filmmaking|cinema]], advertising, animation and video games. Even films that feature no explicit [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] are usually "filmed" now on [[digital camera]]s, or [[video editing|edited]] or [[Video post-processing|post-processed]] using a digital video editor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maly|first1=Timy|title=How Digital Filmmakers Produced a Gorgeous Sci-Fi Movie on a Kickstarter Budget|url=https://www.wired.com/2013/01/kickstarted-scifi-movie/|journal=Wired|accessdate=November 24, 2015|date=2013-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Matthau|first1=Charles|title=How Tech Has Shaped Film Making: The Film vs. Digital Debate Is Put to Rest|url=https://www.wired.com/insights/2015/01/how-tech-shaped-film-making/|journal=Wired|accessdate=November 24, 2015|date=2015-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Simulation]] of various processes, including computational [[fluid dynamics]], physical, electrical, and electronic systems and circuits, as well as societies and social situations (notably war games) along with their habitats, among many others. Modern computers enable optimization of such designs as complete aircraft. Notable in electrical and electronic circuit design are SPICE, as well as software for physical realization of new (or modified) designs. The latter includes essential design software for [[integrated circuit]]s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}
* [[Artificial intelligence]] is becoming increasingly important as it gets more efficient and complex. There are many applications of AI, some of which can be seen at home, such as [[robotic vacuum cleaner]]s. It is also present in video games and on the modern battlefield in drones, anti-missile systems, and [[Legged Squad Support System|squad support robots]].
* [[Human–computer interaction]] combines novel algorithms with design strategies that enable rapid human performance, low error rates, ease in learning, and high satisfaction. Researchers use ethnographic observation and automated data collection to understand user needs, then conduct usability tests to refine designs. Key innovations include the [[direct manipulation]], selectable web links, [[touchscreen]] designs, mobile applications, and [[virtual reality]].

==Etymology==
{{see also|Informatics#Etymology}}

Although first proposed in 1956,&lt;ref name="Tedre2014"/&gt; the term "computer science" appears in a 1959 article in ''[[Communications of the ACM]]'',&lt;ref name="Fine_1959"&gt;
{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
in which Louis Fein argues for the creation of a ''Graduate School in Computer Sciences'' analogous to the creation of [[Harvard Business School]] in 1921,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stanford University Oral History|url=http://library.stanford.edu/guides/stanford-university-oral-history|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=May 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; justifying the name by arguing that, like [[management science]], the subject is applied and interdisciplinary in nature, while having the characteristics typical of an academic discipline.&lt;ref name="Fine_1959"/&gt;
His efforts, and those of others such as [[numerical analysis|numerical analyst]] [[George Forsythe]], were rewarded: universities went on to create such programs, starting with Purdue in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Knuth]] (1972). ''[http://www.stanford.edu/dept/ICME/docs/history/forsythe_knuth.pdf "George Forsythe and the Development of Computer Science"]. ''Comms. ACM''. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020200802/http://www.stanford.edu/dept/ICME/docs/history/forsythe_knuth.pdf |date=October 20, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its name, a significant amount of computer science does not involve the study of computers themselves. Because of this, several alternative names have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Matti Tedre |year=2006 |url=http://epublications.uef.fi/pub/urn_isbn_952-458-867-6/urn_isbn_952-458-867-6.pdf |title=The Development of Computer Science: A Sociocultural Perspective |page=260 |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain departments of major universities prefer the term ''computing science'', to emphasize precisely that difference. Danish scientist [[Peter Naur]] suggested the term ''datalogy'',&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal
 |author=Peter Naur
 |year=1966
 |title=The science of datalogy
 |journal=Communications of the ACM
 |volume=9 |issue=7 |page=485
 |doi=10.1145/365719.366510
}}&lt;/ref&gt; to reflect the fact that the scientific discipline revolves around data and data treatment, while not necessarily involving computers. The first scientific institution to use the term was the Department of Datalogy at the University of Copenhagen, founded in 1969, with Peter Naur being the first professor in datalogy. The term is used mainly in the Scandinavian countries. An alternative term, also proposed by Naur, is [[data science]]; this is now used for a distinct field of data analysis, including statistics and databases.

Also, in the early days of computing, a number of terms for the practitioners of the field of computing were suggested in the ''Communications of the ACM''—''turingineer'', ''turologist'', ''flow-charts-man'', ''applied meta-mathematician'', and ''applied [[epistemology|epistemologist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Communications of the ACM |date=&lt;!-- missing! --&gt; |journal=Communications of the ACM |volume=1 |issue=4 |page=6| doi = 10.1145/368796.368802|last1=Weiss |first1=E.A. |last2=Corley |first2=Henry P.T. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three months later in the same journal, ''comptologist'' was suggested, followed next year by ''hypologist''.&lt;ref&gt;Communications of the ACM 2(1):p.4&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''computics'' has also been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;IEEE Computer 28(12): p.136&lt;/ref&gt; {{anchor|Name of the field in Europe}}In Europe, terms derived from contracted translations of the expression "automatic information" (e.g. "informazione automatica" in Italian) or "information and mathematics" are often used, e.g. ''informatique'' (French), ''Informatik'' (German), ''informatica'' (Italian, Dutch), ''informática'' (Spanish, Portuguese), ''informatika'' ([[Slavic languages]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]) or ''pliroforiki'' (''πληροφορική'', which means informatics) in [[Greek language|Greek]]. Similar words have also been adopted in the UK (as in ''the School of Informatics of the University of Edinburgh'').&lt;ref&gt;P. Mounier-Kuhn, ''L'Informatique en France, de la seconde guerre mondiale au Plan Calcul. L'émergence d'une science'', Paris, PUPS, 2010, ch. 3 &amp; 4.&lt;/ref&gt;
"In the U.S., however, [[informatics]] is linked with applied computing, or computing in the context of another domain."&lt;ref&gt;[http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2010/2/69363-why-an-informatics-degree]&lt;/ref&gt;

A folkloric quotation, often attributed to—but almost certainly not first formulated by—[[Edsger W. Dijkstra|Edsger Dijkstra]], states that "computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes."&lt;ref group=note&gt;See the entry
"[[q:Computer science|Computer science]]" on Wikiquote for the history of this quotation.&lt;/ref&gt; The design and deployment of computers and computer systems is generally considered the province of disciplines other than computer science. For example, the study of computer hardware is usually considered part of [[computer engineering]], while the study of commercial [[computer system]]s and their deployment is often called information technology or [[information system]]s. However, there has been much cross-fertilization of ideas between the various computer-related disciplines. Computer science research also often intersects other disciplines, such as philosophy, [[cognitive science]], [[computational linguistics|linguistics]], [[mathematics]], [[physics]], [[biology]], [[computational statistics|statistics]], and [[logic]].

Computer science is considered by some to have a much closer relationship with mathematics than many scientific disciplines, with some observers saying that computing is a mathematical science.&lt;ref name="Denning_cs_discipline" /&gt; Early computer science was strongly influenced by the work of mathematicians such as [[Kurt Gödel]], [[Alan Turing]], [[Rózsa Péter]] and [[Alonzo Church]] and there continues to be a useful interchange of ideas between the two fields in areas such as [[mathematical logic]], [[category theory]], [[domain theory]], and [[algebra]].&lt;ref name="Tedre2014"/&gt;

The relationship between computer science and software engineering is a contentious issue, which is further muddied by [[Software engineer#Use of the title "Engineer"|disputes]] over what the term "software engineering" means, and how computer science is defined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Tedre | first1 = M. | title = Computing as a Science: A Survey of Competing Viewpoints | doi = 10.1007/s11023-011-9240-4 | journal = Minds and Machines | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 361–387 | year = 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Parnas]], taking a cue from the relationship between other engineering and science disciplines, has claimed that the principal focus of computer science is studying the properties of computation in general, while the principal focus of software engineering is the design of specific computations to achieve practical goals, making the two separate but complementary disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Parnas | first1 = D.L. | journal = Annals of Software Engineering | volume = 6 | pages = 19–37 | year = 1998 | doi = 10.1023/A:1018949113292|title=Software engineering programmes are not computer science programmes}}, p. 19: "Rather than treat software engineering as a subfield of computer science, I treat it as an element of the set, Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, […]"&lt;/ref&gt;

The academic, political, and funding aspects of computer science tend to depend on whether a department formed with a mathematical emphasis or with an engineering emphasis. Computer science departments with a mathematics emphasis and with a numerical orientation consider alignment with [[computational science]]. Both types of departments tend to make efforts to bridge the field educationally if not across all research.

==Philosophy==
{{main|Philosophy of computer science}}
A number of computer scientists have argued for the distinction of three separate paradigms in computer science. [[Peter Wegner]] argued that those paradigms are science, technology, and mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |author=Wegner, P. |title=Research paradigms in computer science—Proceedings of the 2nd international Conference on Software Engineering |location=San Francisco, California, United States |date=October 13–15, 1976 |publisher=IEEE Computer Society Press, Los Alamitos, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter J. Denning|Peter Denning]]'s working group argued that they are theory, abstraction (modeling), and design.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Denning | first1 = P.J. | last2 = Comer | first2 = D.E. | last3 = Gries | first3 = D. | last4 = Mulder | first4 = M.C. | last5 = Tucker | first5 = A. | last6 = Turner | first6 = A.J. | last7 = Young | first7 = P.R. | title = Computing as a discipline | journal = Communications of the ACM | volume = 32 | pages = 9–23 | date = January 1989 | doi = 10.1145/63238.63239}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amnon H. Eden described them as the "rationalist paradigm" (which treats computer science as a branch of mathematics, which is prevalent in theoretical computer science, and mainly employs [[deductive reasoning]]), the "technocratic paradigm" (which might be found in engineering approaches, most prominently in software engineering), and the "scientific paradigm" (which approaches computer-related artifacts from the empirical perspective of [[natural science]]s, identifiable in some branches of [[artificial intelligence]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first1 = A.H. | title = Three Paradigms of Computer Science | journal = [[Minds and Machines]] | last1 = Eden | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | year = 2007 | url = http://www.eden-study.org/articles/2007/three_paradigms_of_computer_science.pdf | doi = 10.1007/s11023-007-9060-8 | pages = 135–167 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160215100211/http://www.eden-study.org/articles/2007/three_paradigms_of_computer_science.pdf | archivedate = February 15, 2016 | df = mdy-all | citeseerx = 10.1.1.304.7763 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas of computer science==

As a discipline, computer science spans a range of topics from theoretical studies of algorithms and the limits of computation to the practical issues of implementing computing systems in hardware and software.&lt;ref name="CSAB1997"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Computing Sciences Accreditation Board|title=Computer Science as a Profession|url=http://www.csab.org/comp_sci_profession.html |date=May 28, 1997| accessdate=23 May 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080617030847/http://www.csab.org/comp_sci_profession.html |archivedate = June 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Committee on the Fundamentals of Computer Science: Challenges and Opportunities, National Research Council |title=Computer Science: Reflections on the Field, Reflections from the Field|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=11106#toc|publisher=National Academies Press|isbn=978-0309093019|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[CSAB (professional organization)|CSAB]], formerly called Computing Sciences Accreditation Board—which is made up of representatives of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM), and the [[IEEE Computer Society]] (IEEE CS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csab.org/ |title=CSAB Leading Computer Education |publisher=CSAB |date=August 3, 2011 |accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;—identifies four areas that it considers crucial to the discipline of computer science: ''theory of computation'', ''algorithms and data structures'', ''programming methodology and languages'', and ''computer elements and architecture''. In addition to these four areas, CSAB also identifies fields such as software engineering, artificial intelligence, computer networking and communication, database systems, parallel computation, distributed computation, human–computer interaction, computer graphics, operating systems, and numerical and symbolic computation as being important areas of computer science.&lt;ref name="CSAB1997"/&gt;

===Theoretical computer science===
{{main|Theoretical computer science}}
''Theoretical Computer Science'' is mathematical and abstract in spirit, but it derives its motivation from practical and everyday computation. Its aim is to understand the nature of '''computation''' and, as a consequence of this understanding, provide more efficient methodologies. All studies related to mathematical, logic and formal concepts and methods could be considered as theoretical computer science, provided that the motivation is clearly drawn from the field of '''computing'''.

====Data structures and algorithms====
Data structures and algorithms are the study of commonly used computational methods and their computational efficiency.

Denning|Peter Denning]], the fundamental question underlying computer science is, "What can be (efficiently) automated?"&lt;ref name="Denning_cs_discipline"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Denning | first=Peter J. | authorlink=Peter J. Denning | year=2000 | title=Computer Science: The Discipline | url=http://www.idi.ntnu.no/emner/dif8916/denning.pdf | journal=Encyclopedia of Computer Science | format=PDF |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060525195404/http://www.idi.ntnu.no/emner/dif8916/denning.pdf |archivedate = May 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theory of computation is focused on answering fundamental questions about what can be computed and what amount of resources are required to perform those computations. In an effort to answer the first question, [[computability theory]] examines which computational problems are solvable on various theoretical [[models of computation]]. The second question is addressed by [[computational complexity theory]], which studies the time and space costs associated with different approaches to solving a multitude of computational problems.

The famous [[P versus NP problem|P = NP?]] problem, one of the [[Millennium Prize Problems]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.claymath.org/millennium/P_vs_NP/ Clay Mathematics Institute] P = NP {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014194456/http://www.claymath.org/millennium/P_vs_NP/ |date=October 14, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is an open problem in the theory of computation.

====Information and coding theory====
{{main|Information theory|Coding theory}}
Information theory is related to the quantification of information. This was developed by [[Claude Shannon]] to find fundamental limits on [[signal processing]] operations such as compressing data and on reliably storing and communicating data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=October 14, 2002 |last=P. Collins |first=Graham |title=Claude E. Shannon: Founder of Information Theory |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=claude-e-shannon-founder |work=Scientific American |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Coding theory is the study of the properties of [[code]]s (systems for converting information from one form to another) and their fitness for a specific application. Codes are used for [[data compression]], [[cryptography]], [[error detection and correction]], and more recently also for [[Linear network coding|network coding]]. Codes are studied for the purpose of designing efficient and reliable [[data transmission]] methods.

====Programming language theory====
{{main|Programming language theory}}
Programming language theory is a branch of computer science that deals with the design, implementation, analysis, characterization, and classification of [[programming language]]s and their individual [[Programming language#Elements|features]]. It falls within the discipline of computer science, both depending on and affecting [[mathematics]], software engineering, and [[linguistics]]. It is an active research area, with numerous dedicated academic journals.

====Formal methods====
{{main|Formal methods}}
Formal methods are a particular kind of [[Mathematics|mathematically]] based technique for the [[formal specification|specification]], development and [[formal verification|verification]] of software and [[computer hardware|hardware]] systems. The use of formal methods for software and hardware design is motivated by the expectation that, as in other engineering disciplines, performing appropriate mathematical analysis can contribute to the reliability and robustness of a design. They form an important theoretical underpinning for software engineering, especially where safety or security is involved. Formal methods are a useful adjunct to software testing since they help avoid errors and can also give a framework for testing. For industrial use, tool support is required. However, the high cost of using formal methods means that they are usually only used in the development of high-integrity and [[life-critical system]]s, where safety or [[computer security|security]] is of utmost importance. Formal methods are best described as the application of a fairly broad variety of [[theoretical computer science]] fundamentals, in particular [[logic in computer science|logic]] calculi, [[formal language]]s, [[automata theory]], and [[program semantics]], but also [[type systems]] and [[algebraic data types]] to problems in software and hardware specification and verification.

===Computer systems===

====Computer architecture and computer engineering====
{{main|Computer architecture|Computer engineering}}
Computer architecture, or digital computer organization, is the conceptual design and fundamental operational structure of a computer system. It focuses largely on the way by which the central processing unit performs internally and accesses addresses in memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=A. Thisted|first=Ronald|title=Computer Architecture |url=http://galton.uchicago.edu/~thisted/Distribute/comparch.pdf|publisher=The University of Chicago|date=April 7, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field often involves disciplines of computer engineering and electrical engineering, selecting and interconnecting hardware components to create computers that meet functional, performance, and cost goals.

====Computer performance analysis====
{{main|Computer performance}}
Computer performance analysis is the study of work flowing through computers with the general goals of improving [[throughput]], controlling [[Response time (technology)|response time]], using resources efficiently, eliminating [[bottleneck (software)|bottleneck]]s, and predicting performance under anticipated peak loads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wescott | first = Bob | title = The Every Computer Performance Book, Chapter 3: Useful laws  | publisher = [[CreateSpace]] | date = 2013 | isbn = 978-1482657753}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Concurrent, parallel and distributed systems====
{{main|Concurrency (computer science)|Distributed computing}}
Concurrency is a property of systems in which several computations are executing simultaneously, and potentially interacting with each other. A number of mathematical models have been developed for general concurrent computation including [[Petri net]]s, [[Process calculus|process calculi]] and the [[Parallel random-access machine|Parallel Random Access Machine]] model. A distributed system extends the idea of concurrency onto multiple computers connected through a network. Computers within the same distributed system have their own private memory, and information is often exchanged among themselves to achieve a common goal.

====Computer networks====
{{main|Computer network}}
This branch of computer science aims to manage networks between computers worldwide.

====Computer security and cryptography====
{{main|Computer security|Cryptography}}
Computer security is a branch of computer technology with an objective of protecting information from unauthorized access, disruption, or modification while maintaining the accessibility and usability of the system for its intended users. [[Cryptography]] is the practice and study of hiding (encryption) and therefore deciphering (decryption) information. Modern cryptography is largely related to computer science, for many encryption and decryption algorithms are based on their computational complexity.

====Databases====
{{main|Database}}
{{Missing information|a structured set of data held in a computer, especially one that is accessible in various ways.|date=September 2018}}
A database is intended to organize, store, and retrieve large amounts of data easily. Digital databases are managed using database management systems to store, create, maintain, and search data, through [[database model]]s and [[query language]]s.

====Informatics practices====  &lt;!-- Redirect target of [[Informatics Practices]] --&gt;
''Informatics practices'' (IP) is a field of software-related study. The course mainly covers [[Coding theory|coding]], software and networking concepts. This field is comparable to computer science, but lacks the [[computer hardware|hardware]] concepts, while focusing more on [[computer network|networking]] concepts than computer science. This branch of [[information science]] and computer science mainly focuses on the study of [[information processing]], particularly with respect to [[system integration]] and human interactions with machine and data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cbseacademic.nic.in/web_material/Curriculum19/Main-SeniorSecondary/15_Information_Practices_New.pdf|title=Informatics Practices (New)|website=Central Board of Secondary Education|accessdate=8 Oct 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computer applications===

====Computer graphics and visualization====
{{main|Computer graphics (computer science)}}
Computer graphics is the study of digital visual contents and involves the synthesis and manipulation of image data. The study is connected to many other fields in computer science, including [[computer vision]], [[image processing]], and [[computational geometry]], and is heavily applied in the fields of special effects and [[video games]].

====Human–computer interaction====
{{main|Human–computer interaction}}
Research that develops theories, principles, and guidelines for user interface designers, so they can create satisfactory user experiences with desktop, laptop, and mobile devices.

====Scientific computing====
[[Scientific computing]] (or [[computational science]]) is the field of study concerned with constructing [[scientific modelling|mathematical models]] and [[numerical analysis|quantitative analysis]] techniques and using computers to analyze and solve [[Science|scientific]] problems. In practical use, it is typically the application of [[computer simulation]] and other forms of [[computation]] to problems in various scientific disciplines.

====Artificial intelligence====
{{main|Artificial intelligence}}
Artificial intelligence (AI) aims to or is required to synthesize goal-orientated processes such as problem-solving, decision-making, environmental adaptation, learning, and communication found in humans and animals. From its origins in [[cybernetics]] and in the [[History of artificial intelligence|Dartmouth Conference]] (1956), artificial intelligence research has been necessarily cross-disciplinary, drawing on areas of expertise such as [[applied mathematics]], [[Mathematical logic|symbolic logic]], [[semiotics]], [[electrical engineering]], [[philosophy of mind]], [[neurophysiology]], and [[social intelligence]]. AI is associated in the popular mind with [[Robotics|robotic development]], but the main field of practical application has been as an embedded component in areas of [[software development]], which require computational understanding. The starting point in the late 1940s was [[Alan Turing]]'s question "Can computers think?", and the question remains effectively unanswered, although the [[Turing test]] is still used to assess computer output on the scale of human intelligence. But the automation of evaluative and predictive tasks has been increasingly successful as a substitute for human monitoring and intervention in domains of computer application involving complex real-world data.

===Software engineering===
{{main|Software engineering}}
{{see also|Computer programming}}
Software engineering is the study of designing, implementing, and modifying software in order to ensure it is of high quality, affordable, maintainable, and fast to build. It is a systematic approach to software design, involving the application of engineering practices to software. Software engineering deals with the organizing and analyzing of software—it doesn't just deal with the creation or manufacture of new software, but its internal maintenance and arrangement.

==The great insights of computer science==
The philosopher of computing [[William J. Rapaport|Bill Rapaport]] noted three ''Great Insights of Computer Science'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/computation.html|title=What Is Computation?|publisher=State University of New York at Buffalo|last = Rapaport|first = William J.|date = 20 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]'s, [[George Boole]]'s, [[Alan Turing]]'s, [[Claude Shannon]]'s, and [[Samuel Morse]]'s insight: there are only ''two objects'' that a computer has to deal with in order to represent "anything".{{refn |group="note"|The word "anything" is written in quotation marks because there are things that computers cannot do. One example is: to answer the question if an arbitrary given computer program will eventually finish or run forever (the [[Halting problem]]).}}
:: All the information about any computable problem can be represented using only 0 and 1 (or any other bistable pair that can flip-flop between two easily distinguishable states, such as "on/off", "magnetized/de-magnetized", "high-voltage/low-voltage", etc.).
{{see also|Digital physics}}
* [[Alan Turing]]'s insight: there are only ''five actions'' that a computer has to perform in order to do "anything".
:: Every algorithm can be expressed in a language for a computer consisting of only five basic instructions:
::* move left one location;
::* move right one location;
::* read symbol at current location;
::* print 0 at current location;
::* print 1 at current location.
{{see also|Turing machine}}
* [[Corrado Böhm]] and [[Giuseppe Jacopini]]'s insight: there are only ''three ways of combining'' these actions (into more complex ones) that are needed in order for a computer to do "anything".
:: Only three rules are needed to combine any set of basic instructions into more complex ones:
::* ''sequence'': first do this, then do that;
::* '' selection'': IF such-and-such is the case, THEN do this, ELSE do that;
::* ''repetition'': WHILE such-and-such is the case DO this.
:: Note that the three rules of Boehm's and Jacopini's insight can be further simplified with the use of [[goto]] (which means it is more elementary than [[structured programming]]).

==Academia==
{{further|List of computer science conferences|Category:Computer science journals}}
Conferences are important events for computer science research. During these conferences, researchers from the public and private sectors present their recent work and meet. Unlike in most other academic fields, in computer science, the prestige of [[proceedings|conference papers]] is greater than that of journal publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meyer|first1=Bertrand|title=Viewpoint: Research evaluation for computer science|journal=Communications of the ACM|date=April 2009|volume=25|issue=4|pages=31–34|doi=10.1145/1498765.1498780}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Patterson|first1=David|title=Evaluating Computer Scientists and Engineers For Promotion and Tenure|url=http://cra.org/resources/bp-view/evaluating_computer_scientists_and_engineers_for_promotion_and_tenure/|publisher=Computing Research Association|date=August 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; One proposed explanation for this is the quick development of this relatively new field requires rapid review and distribution of results, a task better handled by conferences than by journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fortnow|first1=Lance|title=Viewpoint: Time for Computer Science to Grow Up|journal=Communications of the ACM|date=August 2009|volume=52|issue=8|pages=33–35|doi=10.1145/1536616.1536631|url=http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2009/8/34492-viewpoint-time-for-computer-science-to-grow-up/fulltext}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programming paradigms==
{{main|Programming paradigm}}

Programming languages can be leveraged as tools to accomplish a variety of tasks. Therefore, different programming paradigms exist. A few basic programming paradigms used throughout computer science are:

* [[Object-oriented programming|Object-Oriented Programming]]: "Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods. A feature of objects is that an object's procedures can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated. Thus Object-oriented computer programs are made out of objects that interact with one another."
* [[Imperative programming|Imperative Programming]]: "In computer science, imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state. In much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform. Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Imperative programming|date=2018-10-07|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Imperative_programming&amp;oldid=862960283|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Functional programming|Functional Programming]]: "In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions or declarations instead of statements."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Functional programming|date=2018-10-06|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Functional_programming&amp;oldid=862736578|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Procedural programming|Procedural Programming]]: "Procedural programming is a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming, based upon the concept of the procedure call. Procedures, also known as routines, subroutines, or functions (not to be confused with mathematical functions, but similar to those used in functional programming), simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Procedural programming|date=2018-09-09|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Procedural_programming&amp;oldid=858695015|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most programming languages offer support for multiple programming paradigms, making the distinction more a matter of style than of technical capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Multi-Paradigm Programming Language |url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/multiparadigmlanguage.html |website=developer.mozilla.org |publisher=[[Mozilla Foundation]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821052407/https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/multiparadigmlanguage.html |archive-date=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Since computer science is a relatively new field, it is not as widely taught in schools and universities as other academic subjects. For example, in 2014, [[Code.org]] estimated that only 10 percent of high schools in the United States offered computer science education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Computer Science: Not Just an Elective Anymore|url=http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2014/02/26/22computer_ep.h33.html|work=Education Week|date=February 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2010 report by Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) revealed that only 14 out of 50 states have adopted significant education standards for high school computer science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Running on Empty: The Failure to Teach K–12 Computer Science in the Digital Age |url = http://runningonempty.acm.org/fullreport2.pdf | date= 2010|first1 =Cameron |last1=Wilson|publisher = ACM|first2=Leigh Ann|last2= Sudol|first3= Chris|last3 =Stephenson|first4 =Mark |last4=Stehlik}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, computer science education is growing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2016/09/how-to-teach-computational-thinking/|title=How to Teach Computational Thinking—Stephen Wolfram Blog|website=blog.stephenwolfram.com|access-date=16 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some countries, such as Israel, New Zealand and South Korea, have already included computer science in their respective national secondary education curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A is for algorithm|url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21601250-global-push-more-computer-science-classrooms-starting-bear-fruit|work=The Economist|date=April 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Computing at School International comparisons|url=http://www.computingatschool.org.uk/data/uploads/internationalcomparisons-v5.pdf|accessdate=July 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several countries are following suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Adding Coding to the Curriculum|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/24/world/europe/adding-coding-to-the-curriculum.html|work=The New York Times|date=March 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most countries, there is a significant gender gap in computer science education. For example, in the US about 20% of computer science degrees in 2012 were conferred to women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Percentage of Bachelor's degrees conferred to women, by major (1970-2012) |url = http://www.randalolson.com/2014/06/14/percentage-of-bachelors-degrees-conferred-to-women-by-major-1970-2012/|accessdate=July 20, 2015|date = 14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gender gap also exists in other Western countries.&lt;ref name="gender"&gt;{{cite web|title=IT gender gap: Where are the female programmers? |url =http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/software-engineer/it-gender-gap-where-are-the-female-programmers/|first = Justin |last = James |work = TechRepublic}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in some parts of the world, the gap is small or nonexistent. In 2011, approximately half of all computer science degrees in [[Malaysia]] were conferred to women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=what gender is science|url=http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/faculty/mariacharles/documents/WhatGenderisScience.pdf|accessdate=July 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, women made up 54.5% of computer science graduates in [[Guyana]].&lt;ref name="gender"/&gt;

'''Cultural materialism''' is an [[Anthropology|anthropological]] research orientation first introduced by [[Marvin Harris]] in his 1968 book ''The Rise of Anthropological Theory'',&lt;ref name=Harris2001a&gt;{{citation |year=2001a |orig-year=First published 1968 |author=Harris, Marvin |authorlink=Marvin Harris |title=The Rise of Anthropological Theory: A History of Theories of Culture |place=Walnut Creek, California |publisher=AltaMira Press |isbn=978-0-7591-0132-6 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=yUUYN3X18dwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Rise+Anthropological+Theory#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=10 September 2010|ref = harv}} Paperback {{ISBN|0-7591-0133-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a theoretical paradigm and research strategy.

Harris's concept of cultural materialism was influenced by the writings of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], as well as their theories as modified by [[Karl August Wittfogel]] and his 1957 book, ''[[Oriental Despotism (book)|Oriental Despotism]]''.{{sfnb|Harris|2001a| p = 673ff}} Yet this  [[economic materialism|materialism]] is distinct from [[Marxist]] [[dialectical materialism]], as well as from [[materialism|philosophical materialism]].&lt;ref name=Moore&gt;{{citation |year=2004 |author=Moore, Jerry D |chapter=Marvin Harris: Cultural Materialism |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=QAFPjP3yg10C&amp;pg=PA203&amp;dq=%22Marvin+Harris%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BDCLTP_2AYTJcay3-b0E&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Marvin%20Harris%22&amp;f=false |pages=203–215 |title=Visions of Culture: An Introduction to Anthropological Theories and Theorists |edition=2nd |place=Walnut Creek, CA |publisher=AltaMira Press |isbn=978-0-7591-0410-5 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=QAFPjP3yg10C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Visions+of+Culture%22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=10 September 2010}} Paperback {{ISBN|0-7591-0411-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Malthus]]'s work encouraged Harris to consider reproduction of equal importance to production. The research strategy was also influenced by the work of earlier anthropologists including [[Herbert Spencer]], [[Edward Tylor]] and [[Lewis Henry Morgan]] who, in the 19th century, first proposed that cultures evolved from the less complex to the more complex over time. [[Leslie White]] and [[Julian Steward]] and their theories of [[cultural evolution]] and [[cultural ecology]] were instrumental in the reemergence of evolutionist theories of culture in the 20th century and Harris took inspiration from them in formulating cultural materialism.

==[[epistemology|Epistemological]] principles==
Cultural materialism is a scientific [[Research#Research methods|research strategy]] and as such utilizes the [[scientific method]]. Other important principles include [[operational definition]]s, [[Karl Popper]]'s [[falsifiability]], [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s [[paradigms]], and the [[positivism]] first proposed by [[Auguste Comte]] and popularized by the [[Vienna Circle]]. The primary question that arises in applying the techniques of science to understand the differences and similarities between cultures is how the research strategy "treats the relationship between what people say and think as subjects and what they say and think and do as objects of scientific inquiry".&lt;ref name=Harris2001bp29&gt;Harris, Marvin (2001b), p29.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this cultural materialism makes a distinction between behavioral events and ideas, values, and other mental events.

It also makes the distinction between [[emic and etic]] operations. Emic operations, within cultural materialism, are ones in which the descriptions and analyses are acceptable by the native as real, meaningful, and appropriate. Etic operations are ones in which the categories and concepts used are those of the observer and are able to generate scientific theories. The research strategy prioritizes etic behavior phenomena.

==Theoretical principles==
* [[Etic]] and behavioral infrastructure, comprising a society's relations to the environment, which includes their ethics and behavioral modes of production and reproduction (material relations).
* Etic and behavioral [[Structure]], the ethics and behavioral domestic and political economies of a society (social relations).
* Etic and behavioral [[base and superstructure|Superstructure]], the ethics and behavioral symbolic and ideational aspects of a society, e.g. the arts, rituals, sports and games, and science (symbolic and ideational relations).
* Emic and mental Superstructure, including "conscious and unconscious cognitive goals, categories, rules, plans, values, philosophies, and beliefs" (Harris 1979:54) (meaningful or ideological relations).

Within this division of culture, cultural materialism argues for what is referred to as the principle of probabilistic infrastructural determinism.  The essence of its materialist approach is that the infrastructure is in almost all circumstances the most significant force behind the evolution of a culture. Structure and superstructure are not considered "insignificant, epiphenomenal reflexes of infrastructural forces".&lt;ref name=Harris2001bp72&gt;Harris, Marvin (2001b), p.72&lt;/ref&gt; The structure and symbolic/ideational aspects act as regulating mechanisms within the system as a whole.

The research strategy predicts that it is more likely that in the long term infrastructure probabilistically determines structure, which probabilistically determines the superstructures, than otherwise. Thus, much as in earlier Marxist thought, material changes (such as in technology or environment) are seen as largely determining patterns of social organization and ideology in turn.

===Disagreement with Marxism===
In spite of the debt owed to the economic theories of Marx and Engels, cultural materialism rejects the Marxist [[dialectic]] which in turn was based on the theories of the philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]].

== Research ==
During the 1980s, Marvin Harris had a productive interchange with behavioral psychologists, most notably Sigrid Glenn, regarding interdisciplinary work.  Very recently, behavioral psychologists have produced a set of basic exploratory experiments in an effort toward this end.&lt;ref name=Wardetal2009&gt;{{citation |year=2009 |author1=Ward, Todd.A. |author2=Eastman, Raymond. |author3= Ninness, Chris |last-author-amp=yes |title=An Experimental Analysis of Cultural Materialism: The Effects of Various Modes of Production on Resource Sharing |journal=Behavior and Social Issues |volume=18 |pages=58–80 |url=http://www.uic.edu/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/bsi/article/viewFile/1950/2185 |accessdate=10 September 2010 |doi=10.5210/bsi.v18i1.1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently young anthropologists have re-approached the work of Marvin Harris as part of a new anthropology of infrastructures.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |year=2009 |author=Dalakoglou, D. |title=An Anthropology of Road |url= https://books.google.com/?id=N90nlwEACAAJ&amp;dq=an+anthropology+of+the+road+Dalakoglou}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8696">'''Deuterium fusion''', also called '''deuterium burning''', is a [[nuclear fusion]] reaction that occurs in stars and some [[substellar object]]s, in which a [[deuterium]] [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] and a [[proton]] combine to form a [[helium-3]] nucleus. It occurs as the second stage of the [[proton–proton chain reaction]], in which a deuterium nucleus formed from two [[proton]]s fuses with another proton, but can also proceed from [[big bang nucleosynthesis|primordial]] deuterium.

==In protostars==
Deuterium is the most easily fused nucleus available to accreting [[protostar]]s,&lt;ref name="ZuckermanMalkan"&gt;{{Cite book

If there was no deuterium fusion, there would be no stars with masses more than about two or three times the mass of the [[Sun]] in the pre-[[main-sequence]] phase as the more intense [[Stellar nucleosynthesis#Hydrogen fusion|hydrogen fusion]] would occur and prevent the object from accreting matter.&lt;ref name="Palla"/&gt; Deuterium fusion allows further accretion of mass by acting as a thermostat that temporarily stops the central temperature from rising above about one million degrees, a temperature not hot enough for hydrogen fusion, but allowing time for the accumulation of more mass.&lt;ref name="BallyReipurth"&gt;{{Cite book

  | isbn = 9780521801058}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the energy transport mechanism switches from convective to radiative, energy transport slows, allowing the temperature to rise and hydrogen fusion take over in a stable and sustained way. Hydrogen fusion will begin at {{val|e=7|u=K}}.

The rate of energy generation is proportional to (deuterium concentration)×(density)×(temperature)&lt;sup&gt;11.8&lt;/sup&gt;. If the core is in a stable state, the energy generation will be constant. If one variable in the equation increases, the other two must decrease to keep energy generation constant. As the temperature is raised to the power of 11.8, it would require very large changes in either the deuterium concentration or its density to result in even a small change in temperature.&lt;ref name="Palla"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BallyReipurth"/&gt; The deuterium concentration reflects the fact that the gasses are a mixture of ordinary hydrogen and helium and deuterium.

The mass surrounding the radiative zone is still rich in deuterium, and deuterium fusion proceeds in an increasingly thin shell that gradually moves outwards as the radiative core of the star grows. The generation of nuclear energy in these low-[[density]] outer regions causes the protostar to swell, delaying the gravitational contraction of the object and postponing its arrival on the main sequence.&lt;ref name="Palla"/&gt; The total energy available by deuterium fusion is comparable to that released by gravitational contraction.&lt;ref name="BallyReipurth"/&gt;

Due to the scarcity of deuterium in the [[Universe]], a protostar's supply of it is limited. After a few million years, it will have effectively been completely consumed.&lt;ref name="Adams"&gt;{{Cite book

Objects above the deuterium-fusion minimum mass (deuterium burning minimum mass, DBMM) will fuse all their deuterium in a very short time (∼4–50 Myr), whereas objects below that will burn little, and hence, preserve their original deuterium abundance. "The apparent identification of free-floating objects, or [[rogue planet]]s below the DBMM would suggest that the formation of star-like objects extends below the DBMM."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Deuterium Burning in Substellar Objects|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/1538-4357/542/2/L119/fulltext/005577.text.html|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=542|issue=2|pages=L119|accessdate=2 January 2015|bibcode=2000ApJ...542L.119C|last1=Chabrier|first1=G.|last2=Baraffe|first2=I.|last3=Allard|first3=F.|last4=Hauschildt|first4=P.|year=2000|doi=10.1086/312941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In planets==
It has been shown that deuterium fusion should also be possible in planets.

==Other reactions==

Though fusion with a proton is the dominant method of consuming deuterium, other reactions are possible. These include fusion with another deuterium nucleus to form [[helium-3]], [[tritium]], or (more rarely) [[helium-4]], or with helium to form various [[isotopes of lithium|isotopes]] of [[lithium]].&lt;ref name="RolfsRodney"&gt;{{Cite book

Inhomogeneous structures on stellar surfaces, i.e. temperature differences, chemical composition or [[magnetic field]]s, create characteristic distortions in the spectral lines due to the [[Doppler effect]]. These distortions will move across  [[spectral line]] profiles due to the stellar rotation.   The technique to reconstruct these structures on the stellar surface is called '''Doppler-imaging''', often based on the [[Maximum Entropy]] image reconstruction to find the stellar image. This technique gives the smoothest and simplest image that is consistent with observations.

To understand the magnetic field and activity of stars, studies of the [[Sun]] are not sufficient. Therefore, studies of other stars are necessary. Periodic changes in brightness have long been observed in stars which indicate cooler or brighter [[starspot]]s on the surface. These spots are larger than the ones on the Sun, covering up to 20% of the star. Spots with similar size as the ones on the Sun would hardly give rise to changes in intensity. In order to understand the magnetic field structure of a star, it is not enough to know that spots exist because their location and extent are also important.

==History==
Doppler imaging was first used to map chemical peculiarities on the surface of [[Ap and Bp star|Ap stars]]. For mapping starspots it was first used by [[Steven Vogt]] and Donald Penrod in 1983, when they demonstrated that signatures of starspots were observable in the line profiles of the active [[binary star]] HR 1099 (V711 Tau); from this they could derive an image of the stellar surface.

==Criteria for Doppler Imaging==
In order to be able to use the Doppler imaging technique the star needs to fulfill some specific criteria. 
*The [[stellar rotation]] needs to be the dominating effect broadening spectral lines, &lt;math&gt;V \sin i=10-100km s^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.
:The projected equatorial rotational velocity should be at least , &lt;math&gt;V \sin i&lt;10km s^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.  If the velocity in lower, spatial resolution is degraded, but variations in the line profile can still give information of areas with higher velocities.  For very high velocities , &lt;math&gt;V \sin i&gt;100km s^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;., lines become too shallow for recognizing spots.    
*The [[inclination]] angle, ''i'', should preferably be between 20˚-70˚. 
:When ''i'' =0˚ the star is seen from the pole and therefore there is no line-of-sight component of the rotational velocity, i.e. no Doppler effect.  When seen equator-on, ''i'' =90˚ the Doppler image will get a mirror-image symmetry, since it is impossible to distinguish if a spot is on the northern or southern hemisphere. This problem will always occur when ''i'' ≥70˚; Doppler images are still possible to get but harder to interpret.

==Theoretical Basis==
In the simplest case, dark starspots decrease the amount of light coming from one specific region; this causes a dip or notch in the spectral line. As the star rotates the notch will first appear on the short [[wavelength]] side when it becomes visible towards the observer. Then it will move across the line profile and increase in angular size since the spot is seen more face-on, the maximum is when the spot passes the star’s [[meridian (astronomy)|meridian]]. The opposite happens when the spot moves over to the other side of the star. The spot has its maximum Doppler shift for;

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta \,\lambda\,=v\sin i \cos l \sin L km s^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''l'' is the latitude and ''L'' is the longitude.
Thus signatures from spots at higher latitudes will be restricted to spectral line centers, which will also occurring when the rotation axis is not perpendicular to the line of sight. If the spot is located at high latitude it is possible that it will always be seen, in which case the distortion in the line profile will move back and forth and only the amount of distortion will change.

Doppler imaging can also be made for changing chemical abundances across the stellar surface; these may not give rise to notches in the line profile since they can be brighter than the rest of the surface, instead producing a dip in the line profile.

==Zeeman-Doppler imaging==
The [[Zeeman-Doppler imaging]] is a variant of the Doppler imaging technique, by using circular and linear polarization information to see the small shifts in wavelength and profile shapes that occur when a magnetic field is present.

==Binary stars==
Another way to determine and see the extent of starspots is to study stars that are [[binary star|binaries]]. Then the problem with ''i'' =90° is reduced and the mapping of the stellar surface can be improved. When one of the stars passes in front of the other there will be an [[eclipse]], and starspots on the eclipsed hemisphere will cause a distortion in the eclipse curve, revealing the location and size of the spots. This technique can be used for finding both dark (cool) and bright (hot) spots.

'''Electromagnetism''' is a branch of [[physics]] involving the study of the '''electromagnetic force''', a type of [[physical interaction]] that occurs between [[electric charge|electrically charged]] particles. The electromagnetic force usually exhibits [[electromagnetic field]]s such as [[electric field]]s, [[magnetic field]]s, and [[light]], and is one of the four [[fundamental interaction]]s (commonly called forces) in [[nature]]. The other three fundamental interactions are the [[strong interaction]], the [[weak interaction]], and [[gravitation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ravaioli|first1=Fawwaz T. Ulaby, Eric Michielssen, Umberto|title=Fundamentals of applied electromagnetics|date=2010|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-13-213931-1|page=13|edition=6th|ref=Ulaby13}}&lt;!--|accessdate=6 November 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At high energy the weak force and electromagnetic force are unified as a single [[electroweak interaction|electroweak force]].
[[File:Lightning.0257.jpg|thumb|[[Lightning]] is an [[electrostatic discharge]] that travels between two charged regions.]]
Electromagnetic phenomena are defined in terms of the electromagnetic force, sometimes called the [[Lorentz force]], which includes both [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]] as different manifestations of the same phenomenon. The electromagnetic force plays a major role in determining the internal properties of most objects encountered in daily life.  Ordinary matter takes its form as a result of [[intermolecular force]]s between individual atoms and [[molecule]]s in matter, and is a manifestation of the electromagnetic force. [[Electron]]s are bound by the electromagnetic force to [[atomic nuclei]], and their orbital shapes and their influence on nearby atoms with their electrons is described by quantum mechanics. The electromagnetic force governs all chemical processes, which arise from interactions between the [[Molecular orbital|electrons]] of neighboring atoms.

There are numerous [[mathematical descriptions of the electromagnetic field]].  In [[classical electrodynamics]], electric fields are described as [[electric potential]] and [[electric current]]. In [[Faraday law of induction|Faraday's law]], [[magnetic field]]s are associated with [[electromagnetic induction]] and magnetism, and [[Maxwell's equations]] describe how electric and magnetic fields are generated and altered by each other and by charges and currents.

The theoretical implications of electromagnetism, particularly the establishment of the speed of light based on properties of the "medium" of propagation ([[permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] and [[permittivity]]), led to the development of [[special relativity]] by [[Albert Einstein]] in 1905.

==History of the theory==
[[File:Ørsted.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Hans Christian Ørsted]].]]
{{See also|History of electromagnetic theory}}

Originally, electricity and magnetism were considered to be two separate forces. This view changed, however, with the publication of [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s 1873 ''[[A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism]]'' in which the interactions of positive and negative charges were shown to be mediated by one force. There are four main effects resulting from these interactions, all of which have been clearly demonstrated by experiments:
# Electric charges ''{{vanchor|attract}}'' or ''{{vanchor|repel}}'' one another with a force [[Proportionality (mathematics)#Inverse proportionality|inversely proportional]] to the square of the distance between them: unlike charges attract, like ones repel.
# Magnetic poles (or states of polarization at individual points) attract or repel one another in a manner similar to positive and negative charges and always exist as pairs: every north pole is yoked to a south pole.
# An electric current inside a wire creates a corresponding circumferential magnetic field outside the wire.  Its direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise) depends on the direction of the current in the wire.
# A current is induced in a loop of wire when it is moved toward or away from a magnetic field, or a magnet is moved towards or away from it; the direction of current depends on that of the movement.

[[File:Andre-marie-ampere2.jpg|thumb|140px|left|[[André-Marie Ampère]]]]
While preparing for an evening lecture on 21 April 1820, [[Hans Christian Ørsted]] made a surprising observation. As he was setting up his materials, he noticed a [[compass needle]] deflected away from [[magnetic north]] when the electric current from the battery he was using was switched on and off. This deflection convinced him that magnetic fields radiate from all sides of a wire carrying an electric current, just as light and heat do, and that it confirmed a direct relationship between electricity and magnetism.
[[File:SS-faraday.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Michael Faraday]]]]
At the time of discovery, Ørsted did not suggest any satisfactory explanation of the phenomenon, nor did he try to represent the phenomenon in a mathematical framework. However, three months later he began more intensive investigations. Soon thereafter he published his findings, proving that an electric current produces a magnetic field as it flows through a wire. The [[CGS]] unit of [[Electromagnetic induction|magnetic induction]] ([[oersted]]) is named in honor of his contributions to the field of electromagnetism.

[[File:James-clerk-maxwell3.jpg|thumb|left|140px|[[James Clerk Maxwell]]]]
His findings resulted in intensive research throughout the scientific community in [[electrodynamics]]. They influenced French physicist [[André-Marie Ampère]]'s developments of a single mathematical form to represent the magnetic forces between current-carrying conductors. Ørsted's discovery also represented a major step toward a unified concept of energy.

This unification, which was observed by [[Michael Faraday]], extended by [[James Clerk Maxwell]], and partially reformulated by [[Oliver Heaviside]] and [[Heinrich Hertz]], is one of the key accomplishments of 19th century [[mathematical physics]]. It has had far-reaching consequences, one of which was the understanding of the nature of [[light]]. Unlike what was proposed by the electromagnetic theory of that time, light and other [[electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic waves]] are at present seen as taking the form of [[quantum|quantized]], self-propagating [[oscillation|oscillatory]] electromagnetic field disturbances called [[photon]]s. Different [[frequency|frequencies]] of oscillation give rise to the different forms of [[electromagnetic radiation]], from [[radio wave]]s at the lowest frequencies, to visible light at intermediate frequencies, to [[gamma ray]]s at the highest frequencies.

Ørsted was not the only person to examine the relationship between electricity and magnetism. In 1802, [[Gian Domenico Romagnosi]], an Italian legal scholar, deflected a magnetic needle using a Voltaic pile. The factual setup of the experiment is not completely clear, so if current flew across the needle or not. An account of the discovery was published in 1802 in an Italian newspaper, but it was largely overlooked by the contemporary scientific community, because Romagnosi seemingly did not belong to this community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martins |first1=Roberto de Andrade |title=Nuova Voltiana: Studies on Volta and his Times |chapter=Romagnosi and Volta's Pile: Early Difficulties in the Interpretation of Voltaic Electricity |volume=vol. 3 |editors=Fabio Bevilacqua and Lucio Fregonese (eds) |publisher=Università degli Studi di Pavia |pages=81–102 |url=http://ppp.unipv.it/collana/pages/libri/saggi/nuova%20voltiana3_pdf/cap4/4.pdf |accessdate=2010-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530200951/http://ppp.unipv.it/Collana/Pages/Libri/Saggi/Nuova%20Voltiana3_PDF/cap4/4.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An earlier (1735), and often neglected, connection between electricity and magnetism was reported by a Dr. Cookson.&lt;ref&gt;  VIII. An account of an extraordinary effect of lightning in communicating magnetism. Communicated by Pierce Dod, M.D. F. R. S. from Dr. Cookson of Wakefield in Yorkshire.
Phil. Trans. 1735 39, 74-75, published 1 January 1735 &lt;/ref&gt; The account stated, "A tradesman at Wakefield in Yorkshire, having put up a great number of knives and forks in a large box ...  and having placed the box in the corner of a large room, there happened a sudden storm of thunder, lightning, &amp;c.  ... The owner emptying the box on a counter where some nails lay, the persons who took up the knives, that lay on the nails, observed that the knives took up the nails. On this the whole number was tried, and found
to do the same, and that, to such a degree as to take up large nails, packing
needles, and other iron things of considerable weight ..."   [[E. T. Whittaker]] suggested in 1910 that 
this particular event was responsible for lightning to be "credited with the power of magnetizing steel; and it was doubtless this which led Franklin in 1751 to attempt to magnetize a sewing-needle by means of the discharge of Leyden jars." &lt;ref&gt; Whittaker, E. T. (1910). A History of the Theories of Aether and Electricity from the Age of Descartes to the Close of the Nineteenth Century. Longmans, Green and Company.

== Fundamental forces ==
[[File:Circular.Polarization.Circularly.Polarized.Light Right.Handed.Animation.305x190.255Colors.gif|thumb|right|220px|Representation of the electric field vector of a wave of circularly polarized electromagnetic radiation.]]
The electromagnetic force is one of the four known [[fundamental force]]s. The other fundamental forces are:
* the [[weak interaction|weak nuclear force]], which binds to all known particles in the [[Standard Model]], and causes certain forms of [[radioactive decay]]. (In [[particle physics]] though, the [[electroweak interaction]] is the unified description of two of the four known fundamental interactions of nature: electromagnetism and the weak interaction);
* the [[strong interaction|strong nuclear force]], which binds [[quark]]s to form [[nucleon]]s, and binds nucleons to form [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]]
* the [[gravity|gravitational force]].
All other forces (e.g., [[friction]], contact forces) are derived from these four fundamental forces (including momentum which is carried by the movement of particles).&lt;ref&gt;Browne, "Physics for Engineering and Science," p 160: "Gravity is one of the fundamental forces of nature. The other forces such as friction, tension, and the normal force are derived from the electric force, another of the fundamental forces. Gravity is a rather weak force... The electric force between two protons is much stronger than the gravitational force between them."&lt;/ref&gt;

The electromagnetic force is responsible for practically all phenomena one encounters in daily life above the nuclear scale, with the exception of gravity. Roughly speaking, all the forces involved in interactions between [[atom]]s can be explained by the electromagnetic force acting between the electrically charged [[Atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] and [[electron]]s of the atoms. Electromagnetic forces also explain how these particles carry momentum by their movement. This includes the forces we experience in "pushing" or "pulling" ordinary material objects, which result from the [[intermolecular force]]s that act between the individual [[molecule]]s in our bodies and those in the objects. The electromagnetic force is also involved in all forms of [[chemistry|chemical phenomena]].

A necessary part of understanding the intra-atomic and intermolecular forces is the effective force generated by the momentum of the electrons' movement, such that as electrons move between interacting atoms they carry momentum with them. As a collection of electrons becomes more confined, their minimum momentum necessarily increases due to the [[Uncertainty principle|Pauli exclusion principle]]. The behaviour of matter at the molecular scale including its density is determined by the balance between the electromagnetic force and the force generated by the exchange of momentum carried by the electrons themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Purcell, "Electricity and Magnetism, 3rd Edition," p 546: Ch 11 Section 6, "Electron Spin and Magnetic Moment."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical electrodynamics==
{{Main article|Classical electrodynamics}}

In 1600, [[ William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] proposed, in his ''[[De Magnete]]'', that electricity and magnetism, while both capable of causing attraction and repulsion of objects, were distinct effects. Mariners had noticed that lightning strikes had the ability to disturb a compass needle. The link between lightning and electricity was not confirmed until [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s proposed experiments in 1752.  One of the first to discover and publish a link between man-made electric current and magnetism was [[Romagnosi]], who in 1802 noticed that connecting a wire across a [[voltaic pile]] deflected a nearby [[compass]] needle. However, the effect did not become widely known until 1820, when Ørsted performed a similar experiment.&lt;ref name='Oersted'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/whmfield.html |title=Magnetic Fields -- History |accessdate=2009-11-27 |last=Stern |first=Dr. David P. |first2=Mauricio |last2=Peredo |date=2001-11-25 |publisher=NASA Goddard Space Flight Center }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ørsted's work influenced Ampère to produce a theory of electromagnetism that set the subject on a mathematical foundation.

A theory of electromagnetism, known as [[classical electromagnetism]], was developed by various physicists during the period between 1820 and 1873 when it culminated in the publication of a [[A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism|treatise]] by [[James Clerk Maxwell]], which unified the preceding developments into a single theory and discovered the electromagnetic nature of light.&lt;ref&gt;Purcell, p 436. Chapter 9.3, "Maxwell's description of the electromagnetic field was essentially complete."&lt;/ref&gt; In classical electromagnetism, the behavior of the electromagnetic field is described by a set of equations known as [[Maxwell's equations]], and the electromagnetic force is given by the [[Lorentz force|Lorentz force law]].&lt;ref&gt;Purcell: p 278: Chapter 6.1, "Definition of the Magnetic Field." Lorentz force and force equation.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the peculiarities of classical electromagnetism is that it is difficult to reconcile with [[classical mechanics]], but it is compatible with special relativity. According to Maxwell's equations, the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum is a universal constant that is dependent only on the [[Permittivity|electrical permittivity]] and [[magnetic permeability]] of [[free space]]. This violates [[Galilean invariance]], a long-standing cornerstone of classical mechanics. One way to reconcile the two theories (electromagnetism and classical mechanics) is to assume the existence of a [[luminiferous aether]] through which the light propagates. However, subsequent experimental efforts failed to detect the presence of the aether. After important contributions of [[Hendrik Lorentz]] and [[Henri Poincaré]], in 1905, [[Albert Einstein]] solved the problem with the introduction of special relativity, which replaced classical kinematics with a new theory of kinematics compatible with classical electromagnetism. (For more information, see [[History of special relativity]].)

In addition, relativity theory implies that in moving frames of reference, a magnetic field transforms to a field with a nonzero electric component and conversely, a moving electric field transforms to a nonzero magnetic component, thus firmly showing that the phenomena are two sides of the same coin. Hence the term "electromagnetism". (For more information, see [[Classical electromagnetism and special relativity]] and [[Covariant formulation of classical electromagnetism]].)

==Extension to nonlinear phenomena==
[[File:Sun in X-Ray.png|thumb|300px|[[Magnetic reconnection]] in the solar [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] gives rise to [[solar flare]]s, a complex magnetohydrodynamical phenomenon.]]
The Maxwell equations are ''linear,'' in that a change in the sources (the charges and currents) results in a proportional change of the fields. [[Nonlinear system|Nonlinear dynamics]] can occur when electromagnetic fields couple to matter that follows nonlinear dynamical laws. This is studied, for example, in the subject of [[magnetohydrodynamics]], which combines Maxwell theory with the [[Navier–Stokes equations]].

==Quantities and units==
{{see also|List of physical quantities|List of electromagnetism equations}}
'''Electromagnetic units''' are part of a system of electrical units based primarily upon the magnetic properties of electric currents, the fundamental SI unit being the ampere. The units are:
{{Div col}}
*[[ampere]] (electric current)
*[[coulomb]] (electric charge)
*[[farad]] (capacitance)
*[[henry (unit)|henry]] (inductance)
*[[ohm]] (resistance)
*[[siemens (unit)|siemens]] (conductance)
*[[tesla (unit)|tesla]] (magnetic flux density)
*[[volt]] (electric potential)
*[[watt]] (power)
*[[weber (unit)|weber]] (magnetic flux)
{{Div col end}}
In the electromagnetic [[Centimetre gram second system of units|cgs]] system, electric current is a fundamental quantity defined via [[Ampère's law]] and takes the [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] as a dimensionless quantity (relative permeability) whose value in a vacuum is unity. As a consequence, the square of the speed of light appears explicitly in some of the equations interrelating quantities in this system.

{{SI electromagnetism units}}

Formulas for physical laws of electromagnetism (such as [[Maxwell's equations]]) need to be adjusted depending on what system of units one uses. This is because there is no [[one-to-one correspondence]] between electromagnetic units in SI and those in CGS, as is the case for mechanical units. Furthermore, within CGS, there are several plausible choices of electromagnetic units, leading to different unit "sub-systems", including [[Gaussian units|Gaussian]], "ESU", "EMU", and [[Heaviside–Lorentz]]. Among these choices, Gaussian units are the most common today, and in fact the phrase "CGS units" is often used to refer specifically to [[Gaussian units|CGS-Gaussian units]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17014">'''Embodied bilingual language''', also known as '''L2 embodiment''', is the idea that people mentally simulate their actions, [[perception]]s, and [[emotion]]s when speaking and understanding a [[second language]] (L2) as with their [[first language]] (L1).&lt;ref name=Vukovic&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vukovic|first1=Nikola|last2=Shtyrov|first2=Yury|title=Cortical motor systems are involved in second-language comprehension: Evidence from rapid mu-rhythm desynchronisation|journal=NeuroImage|date=2014|volume=102|pages=695–703|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.08.039|pmid=25175538}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is closely related to [[embodied cognition]] and [[embodied language processing]], both of which only refer to native language thinking and speaking.  An example of embodied bilingual language would be situation in which a L1 English speaker learning Spanish as a second language hears the word ''rápido'' ("fast") in Spanish while taking notes and then proceeds to take notes more quickly.

==Overview==
Embodied bilingual language refers to the role second language learning plays in embodied cognition, which proposes that the way the body interacts with its environment influences the way a person thinks or creates mental images.&lt;ref name=Barsalou1999&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barsalou|first1=Lawrence|title=Perceptual symbol systems|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|date=1999|volume=22|issue=44|pages=577–660|doi=10.1017/S0140525X99002149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Embodied cognition theory assumes that embodiment occurs automatically and in a person’s native tongue.&lt;ref name=Bergen&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bergen|first1=Benjamin|last2=Lau|first2=Ting-Ting Chan|last3=Narayan|first3=Schweta|last4=Stojanovic|first4=Diana|last5=Wheeler|first5=Kathryn|title=Body part representations in verbal semantics|journal=Memory and Cognition|date=2010|volume=38|issue=7|pages=969–981|doi=10.3758/MC.38.7.969}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Embodied theories of language posit that word meaning is grounded in mental representations of action, perception, and emotion.&lt;ref name=Barsalou1999/&gt;  Thus, L2 embodiment presupposes that embodied cognition takes place in a language that was learned later in life, outside of a child’s [[critical period]] of learning a language.  In embodied bilingual language, a second language as well as the first language connects cognition with physical body movements.&lt;ref name=Vukovic/&gt;

For example, in first language (L1) embodiment, research shows that participants are quicker to comprehend sentences if they are simultaneously presented with pictures describing the actions in the sentence.&lt;ref name=GK&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Glenberg|first1=Arthur|title=Grounding language in action|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review|date=2002|volume=9|issue=3|pages=558–565|doi=10.3758/BF03196313}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Embodied language assumes that comprehension of language requires mental simulation, or imagination, of the subject and action of a sentence that is being processed and understood.  Following L1 embodiment, L2 embodiment supposes that the understanding of sentences in L2 also require the same mental processes that underlie first language comprehension.&lt;ref name=Vukovic/&gt;

==Theory==
Research shows that embodiment is present in native language processing,&lt;ref name=Bergen/&gt; and if embodiment occurs in first language processing, then embodiment might also occur in second language processing.&lt;ref name=VW&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vukovic|first1=N|last2=Williams|first2=J|title=Automatic perceptual simulation of first language meanings during second language sentence processing in bilinguals|journal=Acta Psychologica|date=2014|volume=145|pages=98–103|doi=10.1016/j.actpsy.2013.11.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  How second language is embodied compared to first language is still a topic of debate. Currently, there are no known theories or models that address the presence or absence of embodiment in second language processing, but there are bilingual processing models that can lead to multiple hypotheses of embodiment effects in second language learning.&lt;ref name=degrawe&gt;{{cite journal|last1=De Grawe|first1=S|last2=Willems|first2=R.M.|last3=Rueschemeyer|first3=S|last4=Lemhöfer|first4=K|last5=Schriefers|first5=H|title=Embodied language in first- and second-language speakers: Neural correlates of processing motor verbs.|journal=Neuropsychologia|date=2014|volume=56|pages=334–349|doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2014.02.003|pmid=24524912}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revised hierarchical model (RHM)===
[[File:Kroll &amp; Stewart's RHM Model.png|thumbnail|According to the RHM, lexical associations from L2 to L1 are stronger than that of L1 to L2.  While the link from L1 to conceptual memory is stronger than the link from L2 to conceptual memory, the two conceptual links are nevertheless bidirectional.]]
The [[Simultaneous bilingualism#Bilingual lexical representations|revised hierarchical model (RHM)]] hypothesizes that [[Lexicon|lexical]] connections are stronger from L2 to L1 than from L1 to L2.  In other words, translating a word from second language to first language occurs faster than vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kroll|first1=Judith|last2=Stewart|first2=Erika|title=Category interference in translation and picture naming: Evidence for asymmetric connection between bilingual memory representations.|journal=Journal of Memory and Language|date=1994|volume=33|issue=2|pages=149–174|doi=10.1006/jmla.1994.1008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, while translating from native language to second language might be delayed, the [[semantics]], or word meanings of the information being conveyed, are maintained and understood by the translator.

What this means in terms of embodied bilingual language is that there should be no difference in embodiment effects between first language processing and second language processing.  Because the RHM model posits that semantic representations are shared across languages, meanings found in first language action, perception, and emotion will transfer equally into second language processing&lt;ref name=degrawe/&gt;

===Extended bilingual interactive activation (BIA+) model===
[[File:Djkstra &amp; van Heuven's BIA+ Model.png|thumbnail|left|According to the BIA+ model, orthographic representations activate first, which then activate phonological and semantic representations.]]
According to the [[Simultaneous bilingualism#Bilingual lexical representations|BIA+ model]] of bilingual lexical processing, the brain activates both languages when recognizing a word in either language.  Rather than selecting a single language, lexical access, or the sound-meaning connections of a language, is non-selective across languages.  The BIA+ model suggests that orthographic representations activate first, followed by their associated phonological and semantic representations.  The speeds of these activations depend on frequency of use of the language.  Given this proposition, if second language is used less often than first language, second language activation occurs more slowly than first language activation.  However, the BIA+ model argues that these differences in activation time are minuscule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dijkstra|first1=Tom|last2=Van Heuven|first2=Walter|title=The architecture of the bilingual word recognition system: From identification to decision|journal=Bilingualism: Language and Cognition|date=2002|volume=5|issue=3|pages=175–197|doi=10.1017/S1366728902003012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to the RHM, the BIA+ model says that while there are slight differences in time when accessing word meanings in both first and second languages, the semantic representations are maintained.  Thus, in terms of embodiment, the BIA+ model would suggest that embodiment effects, too, are maintained across native and second language processing.&lt;ref name=degrawe/&gt;

===Sense model===
[[File:Finkbeiner et al. Sense Model.png|thumbnail|A sense model representation of two translation equivalents which only partially share semantic meaning. Semantics are completely connected to first language but only very little in second language.]]
The sense model takes a different position from the previously stated models. The sense model supposes that native language words are associated with a greater number of semantic senses than second language words and argues for partially overlapping distributed semantic representations for L1 and L2 words.  As a result, the sense model argues that semantic representations in second language are "less rich" than in those in the native language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Finkbeiner|first1=Matthew|last2=Forster|first2=Kenneth|last3=Nicol|first3=Janet|last4=Nakamura|first4=Kumiko|title=The role of polysemy in masked semantic and translation priming|journal=Journal of Memory and Language|date=2004|volume=51|pages=1–22|doi=10.1016/j.jml.2004.01.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If this is the case in embodied bilingual language, then embodiment in second language processing may be minimal or even completely lacking.&lt;ref name=degrawe/&gt;

==Action==

===Non-selective motor systems===
Embodied bilingual processing is rooted in motor processing because research shows that the [[motor cortex]] activates during language processing.  In first language processing, for example, leg-related words like "kick" and "run" stimulate the part of the motor cortex that controls leg motions.&lt;ref name=Pul&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pulvermüller|first1=F|last2=Härle|first2=M|last3=Hummel|first3=F|title=Walking or Talking?: Behavioral and Neurophysiological Correlates of Action Verb Processing|journal=Brain and Language|date=2001|volume=78|issue=2|pages=143–168|doi=10.1006/brln.2000.2390}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This illustrates that language describing motor actions activates motor systems in the brain, but only when the words provide [[literal meaning]] as opposed to figurative meaning.&lt;ref name=BW/&gt; Following L1 embodiment, L2 embodiment assumes that the words "punch" and "throw" in a second language will also stimulate the same parts of the motor cortex as does first language words.&lt;ref name=Vukovic/&gt;  In essence, language that describes motor actions activates [[motor systems]] in the brain.&lt;ref name=Vukovic/&gt;  If this holds true for all languages, then the processing that occurs when understanding and using a second language must also activate motor regions of the brain, just as native language processing does.

Research shows that both first and second language action words rely on the motor cortex for language processing, strengthening the claim that the motor cortex is necessary for action language processing.&lt;ref name=VW/&gt;  This research suggests that action language processing has direct access to semantic motor representations in both languages.&lt;ref name=degrawe/&gt;  This results from second language motor systems calling on and activating information from first language motor systems.  Initially, the semantic representations stimulated by the first language are stronger than that of the second language.  But with more experience and exposure to the second language, sensorimotor involvement and second language comprehension becomes stronger.&lt;ref name=Pul/&gt;  The more often a second language is used, the stronger the neural networks and associations become, and thus some researchers argue that semantic representations in second language become just as prominent as for first language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dudschig|first1=C|last2=Kaup|first2=B|title=Embodiment and second-language: Automatic activation of motor responses during processing spatially associated L2 words and emotion L2 words in a vertical stroop paradigm.|journal=Embodiment and second-language: Automatic activation of motor responses during processing spatially associated L2 words and emotion L2 words in a vertical stroop paradigm.|date=2013|volume=132|pages=14–21|doi=10.1016/j.bandl.2014.02.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perception==
Grounded or embodied cognition is a theoretical view that assumes knowledge is represented in the mind as modal representations, which are memories of perceptual, motor, and affective experiences.&lt;ref name=Barsalou1999/&gt;  Perceptual features include orientation, location, visibility conditions, motion, movement direction, and action direction.  All of these perceptual features are necessary for comprehending language.  If this is true for first language processing, then this must also be true for second language processing.&lt;ref name=BW&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bergen|first1=Benjamin|last2=Wheeler|first2=Kathlyn|title=Grammatical aspect and mental simulation.|journal=Brain and Language|date=2010|volume=112|pages=150–158|doi=10.1016/j.bandl.2009.07.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These perceptual features occur when imagining an action, recalling an action, and observing various sensory information.&lt;ref name=degrawe/&gt;  In addition to motor brain areas, [[somatosensory]] areas, which deal with touch and physical awareness, are also activated.  This sensory information contributes to formulating the mental simulation, or imagination of the action being described, that necessitates language comprehension&lt;ref name=BW/&gt;

Finally, research shows that embodied bilingual language processing not only activates the perceptual simulation of first and second language meanings, but this activation is automatic.&lt;ref name=VW/&gt;  Second language users automatically stimulate word meanings in a detailed perceptual fashion.  Rather than consciously using strategies for language comprehension, bilinguals automatically perceive and construct meaning.

==Emotion==
Embodied bilingual language also assumes that comprehension of language activates parts of the brain that correspond with [[emotion]].  Research provides evidence that emotion words are embedded in a rich semantic network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pavlenko|first1=A|title=Emotion and emotion-laden words in the bilingual lexicon|journal=Bilingualism: Language and Cognition|date=2008|volume=11|pages=147–165|doi=10.1017/S1366728908003283}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Given this information, emotion is better perceived in a first language because linguistic development coincides with conceptual development and development of emotional regulation systems.  Linguistic conditioning spreads to phonologically and semantically related words of the same language, but not to translation equivalents of another language.

===Disembodied bilingual language and emotion===
Some researchers have argued for disembodied cognition when it comes to processing emotion.  The idea of disembodied cognition comes from research, which shows that less emotion is shown by a bilingual person when using a second language.  This may illustrate that less emotionality is attached to second language, which then leads to the reduction of [[biases]] such as decision bias or framing bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pavlenko|first1=A|title=Affective processing in bilingual speakers: Disembodied cognition?|journal=International Journal of Psychology|date=2012|volume=47|issue=6|pages=405–428|doi=10.1080/00207594.2012.743665}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One study examining the anxiety effects of L2 words such as "death" found that those with lower levels of proficiency in L2 were more likely than L1 speakers to experience feelings of anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keysar|first1=B|last2=Hayakawa|first2=S|last3=An|first3=S|title=The foreignlanguage effect: Thinking in a foreign tongue reduces decision biases.|journal=Psychological Science|date=2012|volume=23|pages=661–668.|doi=10.1177/0956797611432178|pmid=22517192}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|How does this figure in to the rest of this paragraph?|date=June 2015}} Because the emotion is less interpreted during second language processing, speakers will be more likely to ignore or fail to comprehend the emotion of a situation when making decisions or analyzing situations. However, others have found that such and similar results may be due not so much to an emotions-based explanation, as the fact that speaking in a second/foreign language seems to release the speaker from the social norms, limitations and political correctness imposed by their mother tongue.&lt;ref name="ParadowskiGawinkowskaBilewicz2013"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gawinkowska M, Paradowski MB, Bilewicz M |title=Second language as an exemptor from sociocultural norms. Emotion-Related Language Choice revisited |url = http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0081225 |journal=PLoS ONE  |volume=8 |issue=12 |pages=e8122 |year=2013 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0081225 |pmid=24349044 |pmc=3859501}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of disembodied cognition posits that because emotions are not as clearly recognized in a second language versus a first language, emotions will not affect and bias a person who is using a second language as much as using a first language.  This lack of comprehension of emotion provides evidence for the sense model, which hypothesizes that embodied cognition fails to be present in second language processing.

'''Encoding''', in '''[[semiotics]]''', is the [[wikt:process|process]] of creating a [[message]] for transmission by an addresser to an addressee. The complementary process{{spaced ndash}}interpreting a message received from an addresser{{spaced ndash}}is called [[Decoding (semiotics)|decoding]].

==Discussion==
The process of message exchanges, or [[semiosis]], is a key characteristic of human life depending on rule-governed and learned [[code (Semiotics)|codes]] that, for the most part, [[Unconscious_mind|unconsciously]] guide the communication of [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]] between [[individual]]s. These interpretive frameworks or linking grids were termed "myths" by [[Roland Barthes]] (1915–1980) and pervade all aspects of [[culture]] from personal conversation to the mass media's output (for code exchange through the mass media, see [[Americanism (semiotics)|Americanism]]).

Early theorists like [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure]] (1857–1913) proposed the theory that when the addresser wishes to transmit a message to an addressee, the intended meaning must be converted into content so that it can be delivered. [[Roman Jakobson]] (1896–1982) offered a [[structuralism|structuralist]] theory that the transmission and response would not sustain an efficient [[discourse]] unless the parties used the same codes in the appropriate social contexts. But, Barthes shifted the emphasis from the ''semiotics of language'' to the exploration of ''semiotics as language''. Now, as Daniel Chandler states, there is no such thing as an uncoded message: all experience is coded. So when the addresser is planning the particular message, both [[denotation (Semiotics)|denotative]] and [[connotation (Semiotics)|connotative]] meanings will already be attached to the range of signifiers relevant to the message. Within the broad framework of [[syntactic]] and [[semantic]] codes, the addresser will select signifiers that, in the particular context, will best represent his or her [[value (Semiotics)|values]] and purposes. But the medium of communication is not necessarily neutral and the ability of the addressee to accurately decode the message may be affected by a number of factors. So the addresser must attempt to compensate for the known problems when constructing the final version of the message and hope that the preferred meanings will be identified when the message is received. One of the techniques is to structure the message so that certain aspects are given [[salience (semiotics)|salience]] (sometimes called ''foregrounding'') and predispose the [[audience]] to interpret the whole in the light of the particular. This relates to [[Gestalt psychology]], [[Max Wertheimer]] (1880–1943) examined the factors that determine grouping in cognitive processes:
#the fact of grouping signs together predisposes an uncritical audience to perceive the signs as similar;
#the audience prefers ''closure'', i.e. it prefers the experience to be as complete as possible and to see things as a whole even though no actual continuity or conclusion is implied; and 
#the audience prefers an everyman's version of [[Occam's Razor]], i.e. the simplest explanations and solutions. In real life that means that assumptions, inferences and prejudices can often fill in gaps. If a conclusion seems to fit the available facts, other possibilities are not considered or are disregarded, producing the suggestion that humans conserve cognitive energy whenever they can and avoid thinking.
If an addresser is writing a speech, [[rhetoric]]al [[Trope (linguistics)|tropes]] may be used to emphasise the elements that the audience is to focus upon and potentially perceive as predicating a particular conclusion. If images are to be selected, [[metonymy]] may indicate common associational values with the preferred meaning of the text.

'''Entertainment management''' is a relatively new [[business management]] discipline that is increasingly being taught as a [[Bachelor of Arts degree]]. Entertainment management courses aim to provide graduates with appropriate knowledge and skills to progress into management careers within the [[show business|entertainment sector]], managing facilities such as sport events, theme parks, theaters, cinemas, live music venues, museums, art galleries, broadcast media companies and night clubs.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

The [[Lubin School of Business]] at [[Pace University]] offers a [[Bachelor of Business Administration|BBA]] degree in [[management]] with a concentration in arts and entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pace.edu/lubin/arts-and-entertainment-bba&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of master's-level programs have emerged recently, including [[Carnegie Mellon University|Carnegie Mellon University's]] [[Heinz College|Master of Entertainment Industry Management]] – which offers students with undergraduate degrees in the film and television the opportunity to refocus their education on the management dimension of the work, or Northwestern University's [http://www.creative.northwestern.edu Master of Science in Leadership for Creative Enterprises] program, which offers students with backgrounds in visual, performing, or interactive arts with management and entrepreneurial skills.

Growth in these courses has been linked with growth in both the creative and cultural industries. This growth is linked to increased [[consumer expenditure]] on recreation and entertainment activities. The result is a population assigning greater importance to the free time they have and a consequential willingness to spend more of their income on the 'experience' economy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13800">'''Evolutionary database design''' involves [[incrementalism|incremental]] improvements to the [[database schema]] so that it can be continuously updated with changes, reflecting the customer's requirements. People across the globe work on the same piece of software at the same time hence, there is a need for techniques that allow a smooth evolution of [[database]] as the design develops. Such methods utilize automated [[refactoring]] and [[continuous integration]] so that it supports [[Agile software development|agile methodologies]] for software development. These development techniques are applied on systems that are in [[pre-production]] stage as well on systems that have already been released. These techniques not only cover relevant changes in the database schema according to customer's changing needs, but also migration of modified data into the database and also customizing the database access code accordingly without changing the [[Semantics (computer science)|data semantics]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://martinfowler.com/articles/evodb.html|title=Evolutionary Database Design|access-date=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
After using the [[waterfall model]] for a long time, the software industry has witnessed a rise in adoption of agile methods for software development. [[Agile software development|Agile methodologies]] don’t assume [[Requirements engineering|requirements]] to be permanent at any stage of the [[Software development process|software life cycle]]. These methods are designed to support sporadic changes in contrast to waterfall design technique. An important part of this approach is [[Iterative and incremental development|iterative development]], where the entire software life-cycle is run multiple times during the life of a project. Every iteration witnesses the complete software development life cycle despite the iterations being of short duration that can vary between weeks to a few months.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Before the adoption of these methodologies, the entire system was designed before starting to develop the code. The same principle was applied to the database schema as well where it was considered to be derived out of the [[Software requirements specification|software requirements]] which were in turn developed by collaboration between the customer, end-users, business analysts, etc. and these requirements were not expected to change with the progress in the software development. This approach proved to be cumbersome because as time progressed, the redundancies in the existing database schema in the form of unused rows or columns were evident. This redundancy along with [[data quality]] problems went on to become a costly affair. It was concluded that  the practice of not having design interleaved with construction and testing was highly inefficient.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Techniques ==
As mentioned in the previous section evolutionary methods are iterative in nature and these methods have become immensely popular over last two decades. Evolutionary database design aims to construct the database schema over the course of the project instead of building the entire database schema at the beginning of the project. This method of database design can capture and deal effectively with the changing requirements of projects.

There are five evolutionary database design techniques that can aid developers in building their database in an iterative fashion. A brief overview about the five techniques are provided below.

=== Database refactoring ===
{{Main article|Database refactoring}}

[[Refactoring]] is the process of making changes to the program without affecting the functionality of the program. Database refactoring is the technique of implementing small changes to the database schema without affecting the functionality and information stored in the database.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vial|first=G.|date=2015-11-01|title=Database Refactoring: Lessons from the Trenches|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/icp.jsp?arnumber=7310988&amp;tag=1|journal=IEEE Software|volume=32|issue=6|pages=71–79|doi=10.1109/MS.2015.131|issn=0740-7459}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main purpose of [[database refactoring]] is to improve the [[database design]] so that the database is more in-sync with the changing requirements. The user can modify [[Table (database)|tables]], [[View (database)|views]], [[stored procedure]]s and [[Database trigger|triggers]]. Dependency between the database and external applications make database refactoring a challenge.

=== Evolutionary data modeling ===
[[Data modeling]] is the technique of identifying [[Entity–attribute–value model|entities]], associating [[Attribute (computing)|attributes]] to the entities and deciding the [[data structure]] to represent the attributes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the traditional database scenario, a logical data model is created at the beginning to represent the entities and their associated attributes. In evolutionary data modeling the technique of data modeling is performed in an iterative manner, that is multiple data models are developed, each model representing a different aspect of the database. This kind of data modeling technique is practiced in an agile environment and it is one of the main principles of agile development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.agilemodeling.com/principles.htm#MultipleModels|title=The Principles of Agile Modeling (AM)|website=www.agilemodeling.com|access-date=2016-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Database regression testing ===
Whenever a new functionality is added to a system, it is essential to verify that the update does not corrupt or render the system unusable. In a database, the business logic is implemented in [[stored procedure]]s, [[Data validation and reconciliation|data validation]] rules and [[referential integrity]] and they have to be tested thoroughly when any change is implemented in the system. [[Regression testing]] is the process of executing all the [[test case]]s whenever a new feature is added to the system. [[test-first development]] (TFD) is a form of regression testing followed in evolutionary database design. The steps involved in TFD approach are,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Refactoring Database: Evolutionary Database Design|last=Ambler|first=Scott|last2=Sadalage|first2=Pramod J|publisher=Addison Wesley Professional|year=2006|isbn=0-321-29353-3|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Before adding a new function to the system, add a test to the test case suite such that the system fails the test
* Run the tests, either the entire set of test cases or just a subset and ensure that the newly added test does indeed fail
* Update the function such that the test passes
* Run the tests again to ensure that all they succeed and that the system is not broken

=== Configuration management of database artifacts ===
[[Configuration management]] is a detailed recording of versions and updates that have been applied to any system. Configuration management is useful in [[Rollback (data management)|rolling back]] updates and changes which have impacted the system in a negative manner. To ensure that any updates made in database refactoring can be rolled back, it is important to maintain database artifacts like [[data definition language]] scripts, data model files, [[Reference database|reference data]], stored procedures, etc. in a configuration management system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://agiledata.org/essays/bestPractices.html|title=Evolutionary/Agile Database Best Practices|website=agiledata.org|access-date=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Developer sandboxes ===
{{Main article|Sandbox (software development)}}

A [[Sandbox (software development)|sandbox]] is a fully functional environment in which the system can be built, tested and executed. In order to make changes to the database schema in an evolutionary manner it is ideal for every developer to have his/her own physical sandbox, copy of [[source code]] and a copy of [[database]]. In a sandbox environment the developer can make changes to the database schema and run tests without affecting the work of other developers and other environments. Once the change has been implemented successfully, it is promoted to [[pre-production]] environment where in [[acceptance testing]] is performed and after the acceptance tests succeed it is deployed into [[Production (computer science)|production]].

== Advantages and disadvantages ==

=== Advantages ===
# High quality of database design: In evolutionary database design, the developer makes small changes to the database schema in an incremental manner and this achieves a highly [[Optimization (computer science)|optimized]] database schema.
# Handling change: In a [[Relational database management system|traditional database]] approach, a lot of time is spent in remodeling and restructuring the database when the requirements change. In evolutionary database technique, the [[Database schema|schema]] of the database is adjusted periodically to keep up with the changing requirements. Hence, evolutionary database design technique is better suited in handling the changing requirements.
# Guaranteed working of system at all times: The evolutionary database design approach follows [[test-first development]] model, in which the complete working of a system is tested before and after implementing an update. Hence, it is guaranteed that the system always works.
# Compatible with software development: The IT industry is progressing towards agile method of software development and evolutionary database design ensures that data development is in sync with software development.
# Reduced overall effort: In an evolutionary environment only the functionality that is required at that moment is implemented and no more.

=== Disadvantages ===
# Cultural impediments: Evolutionary database design approach is relatively a newer concept and many well qualified [[Database administrator|data professionals]] still advocate the traditional approach. Therefore, most of the databases are still being designed in a serial fashion and evolutionary database design is yet to gain support and traction among experienced data professionals.
# Requires a learning curve: Most of the developers are more familiar with the traditional approach and it takes time to learn evolutionary design as it is not intuitive. 
# Complex: When the database has many external dependencies, making changes to the schema becomes all the more complicated as the external dependencies should also be updated to cope up with the changes made in the database schema. With the increase in number of dependencies, Evolutionary Database Design approach becomes extremely complex.

== Comparison with traditional database design ==
Traditional database design technique does not support changes like evolutionary database design technique.'Unfortunately, the traditional data community assumed that evolving database schema is a hard thing to do and as a result never thought through how to do it.'&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  In a way, the evolutionary design is better for application developers and traditional design is better for data professionals.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/08/06/edbd_vs_tdbd/|title=Evolutionary vs. traditional database design|last=Data|first=Big|last2=data|first2=Thank heavens for the silicon chip: A.

|-
|Design
|Traditional databases were developed by collaboration between [[business analyst]]s and users.
|Evolutionary Databases were designed by software developers and data professionals.
|-
|Design Issues
|They demonstrate some design issues in databases. Commercially available databases were developed by experienced individuals, but are now being serviced by the database and not data professionals.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
|They are developed by a close alliance of software developers and data professionals. The database evolves with the development and hence is processed by the same individuals who were responsible for development.
|-
|Approach towards change
|Any change requested by the user is incorporated in the logical model  followed by the physical model and then tested to ensure perfect  functionality.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
|Change is an integral part of evolutionary database design. Any change requested by the user is immediately implemented in the database as well as the code. The [[data migration]] scripts need to be updated as well.
|-
|Dependency on ER diagram
|Traditional design is methodological and due to its dependency on [[Entity–relationship model|ER diagram]] and its detailed design phases such as user, logic, and physical we can track data as well as its meaning.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
|Design is interleaved between stages for evolutionary database design. Thus, the relationship between entities can change over software development cycle and so does the ER diagram.

Dr. '''George Galambos'''  (born in [[Budapest]]) is a computer engineer.

He graduated the Budapest Technical University ([[Budapest University of Technology and Economics]]) in 1972, with a Ph.D. in chemical engineering. Prior to which, he studied chemical engineering at the Leningrad Technology Institute ([[Saint Petersburg State Institute of Technology]]).

He is an [[IBM Fellow]] (2003), an IBM Distinguished Engineer and a member of the IBM Academy of Technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/5250.wss IBM Honors and Rewards Elite Technical Employees]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5vOialXpj?url=http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/5250.wss |date=December 31, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He holds the office of CTO, Global Services (IGS) IBM Canada.

Dr. Galambos was a designer on the team that built the Interac network connecting bank machines around the world. The result was an open system that allowed almost any card to be used in almost any machine, regardless of the user’s financial institution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itbusiness.ca/it/client/en/Home/News.asp?id=1872 Interac architect sounds off on SOA]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5vOib2yra?url=http://www.itbusiness.ca/it/client/en/Home/News.asp?id=1872 |date=December 31, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Galambos advises companies on advanced systems design and strategic IT plans. His current interest includes system design patterns, with a focus on integration.

Dr. Galambos holds patent for 'System and method for transforming an enterprise using a component business model' (Patent #20070174109, Class: 705010000 (USPTO)), A system and method are described for using a Component Business Model (CBM) to transform a business. A CBM map is used to identify components that collaborate to provide a specified capability, and a repository supporting the CBM map is filtered to provide a view of the identified components that highlights how they collaborate. The view is used to identify component features contributing to the specified capability. The specified capability is then enhanced by a transformation strategy that includes re-engineering particular components, identifying a pattern characterizing the collaboration between components and adding a component to perform the collaborative pattern, or adding another feature to the collaboration and adding component to perform the additional feature. The CBM repository provides exemplar best practices that can be adapted for use in a re-engineered component.

'''''Gobar Times''''' is a monthly environmental education magazine for the young adult, published by the [[Centre for Science and Environment]]. It is published along with ''[[Down to Earth (magazine)|Down to Earth]]'' as a supplement. The magazine was first published in May, 1998 and has widespread circulation across India and abroad. The icon of the magazine, Pandit Gobar Ganesh, the pondering panditji is an Indian elderly who takes the reader through current issues, subjects and ideas relating to the environment. He is the icon whose brains can be picked for anything on earth. The current editor of the magazine is Sumita Dasgupta.

"[[Gobar]]" is the [[Hindi language|Hindi]] and  [[Nepali language|Nepali]] word for "cow dung". It was chosen to capture the eco-philosophy and tradition of generating wealth from waste. Waste gobar serves as an [[insecticide]] and is used to plaster mud houses and is a waterproof coating for walls. It is also used to plaster floors to keep them cool. Gobar is the energy source for rural India. It is used as cooking fuel where people have no access to fuels like [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]]. The greatest use of cow dung in India is in farming where it is used as natural manure for farmers' crops. In short, it's a mainstay of rural India, and an appropriate symbol for eco-friendly technology.

[[Anil Agarwal (environmentalist)|Anil Agarwal]] the founder-director of Centre for Science and Environment, India’s leading environmental NGO, aptly called ‘Gobar’ the symbol that embodies the spirit of the Indian environmental movement. As he correctly reflected, the widespread and diverse use of gobar in Indian society stands up to every principle of good environmentalism.

== History ==
In May 1992, the Society for Environmental Communications started India’s only science and environment fortnightly, ''Down To Earth'' (DTE). Over the years the magazine has informed and inspired people about environmental threats facing India and the world - a dimension underplayed in mainstream media. In May, 1998, ''Gobar Times'' was first published as a supplement to ''DTE''. ''Gobar Times'' reaches out to the young, encouraging them to take the lead and make a difference. It informs them and encourages them to save the environment by becoming an action-oriented, knowledgeable and aware community. The tone of the magazine is light-hearted, simple and thought-provoking. Every month the magazine comes up with an activity related center spread which can be pulled out and put up as a poster to encourage readers to become active participants. The magazine has recently entered into a partnership with the leading newspaper ''[[Hindustan Times]]''. Readers can now get a glimpse of what Pandit Gobar Ganesh has to say as they read HTNext.

== Green Schools Program ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:GSP-logo.gif|thumb|left|GSP logo]] --&gt;Conceptualized by the [[New Delhi]]–based Centre for Science and Environment(CSE), The ''Gobar Times'' Green Schools Program allows self-assessment of the environmental practices of a school by its students, using the "Green Schools Manual". This inspection or survey of environmental practices at schools&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gdsalwan.com/Environment.html G D Salwan Public School, Green Schools Program]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kfirural.org/Green_sch.html The Rural centre]&lt;/ref&gt; is a way for them to audit their immediate environment across the key areas of water, air, land, energy and waste.

*'''Water''': To make the school water literate and teach ways of [[rainwater harvesting]] and recycling of waste water.
*'''Air''': Students check out the transport system of the school and understand how people commute to school. This further enables them to understand how transport policies affect air quality and how they can innovate and find ways of reducing [[Air pollution|emissions]].
*'''Land''': The different plant and animal species on the school campus are identified by the students and a survey done on the use of [[pesticides]] in the school. Understanding the concept of carrying capacity.
*'''Energy''': The students study electricity and other forms of energy consumption on the school campus and explore ways in which it can be minimized.
*'''Waste''': Students find out how much and what type of waste the school is producing? Learn [[composting]] and waste segregation methods in the process.

By the end of it all the program gives the students an opportunity to give a report card to the school on its environmental performance and practices. They conduct the audit with the help of an interesting handbook called the 'Green Schools Program Manual' (2007 Edition). This manual gives them step by step guidelines on how to conduct an environmental audit in the school.

The purpose of the Green Schools Program is to encourage and support schools to build up an environmentally aware, active and skilled community&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2007/01/09/stories/2007010902810800.htm Opinion, Director - NCERT]&lt;/ref&gt; of teachers, students and parents. The schools may use the manual as part of their environmental studies program or to conduct activities in eco-clubs. The data collected by students is compiled and rated such that it becomes a self-assessment tool of environmental practices followed by the school. The aim of the rating is, to understand what can be done to improve the schools performance on its environmental sustainability index and to implement changes over the coming years.

=== Awards ===
The ''Gobar Times'' Green Schools Awards is a platform to acknowledge and reward  schools which have adopted the most innovative and effective practices to manage [[natural resources]] within their own premises. Schools send in their green reports to CSE. These reports undergo rigorous verification and selection and the best schools are awarded annually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.outlookindia.com/item.aspx?650467 Outlook Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/delhi-schools-awarded-for-green-initiatives/582368/ Indian Express - Green Initiative]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2010/02/21/stories/2010022158190300.htm The Hindu - Elite 'Delhi' schools fail 'green test']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Award GSP.jpg|thumb|left|Award ceremony for Green Schools Program]]

The top 10 schools of the country which have been working and have implemented tremendous improvement in their environmental practices are awarded the 'Change Makers' award. Schools participating for the first time are considered in the 'New Schools' category.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stpauls-delhi.com/parents%20corner.html St Pauls, Delhi]&lt;/ref&gt; They are judged basis involvement of students and teachers, and the quality of the reports submitted. Also schools which do not necessarily audit all areas but do exceptionally well in a single specific area of water, energy, land, air or waste apply for the coveted 'Best Managers' award.

=== Partners ===
The [[National Green Corps]]&lt;ref&gt;[[National Green Corps#External links|National Green Corps]]&lt;/ref&gt; is a program of the [[Ministry of Environment and Forests (India)|Ministry of Environment and Forest]], Government of India). State nodal offices and CSE partner in many states across India. As the Green Schools network is expanding, the awards are now also organized at the state level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pscst.com/en/about/CSE%20green%20school%20award.htm Punjab State, Green Schools Program]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sikenvis.nic.in/archives.htm Sikkim, Green Schools Training]&lt;/ref&gt; The highest rank holders at the state level in different categories are nominated by state nodal agencies to compete for national awards with CSE in Delhi.

In [[Ancient Greece]], the '''Gorgoneion''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Γοργόνειον) was a special [[apotropaic]]  [[amulet]] showing the [[Gorgon]] head, used most famously by the [[Olympian gods|Olympian deities]] [[Athena]] and [[Zeus]]: both are said to have worn the gorgoneion as a protective [[pendant]].&lt;ref name="Vassilika"&gt;{{harvnb|Vassilika|1998|p=20}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was assumed, among other godlike attributes, as a royal [[aegis]] to imply divine birth or protection, by rulers of the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic age]], as shown, for instance, on the [[Alexander Mosaic]] and the [[Gonzaga Cameo]].

==Origin==
According to [[Marija Gimbutas]], gorgoneia represent certain aspects of the [[Mother Goddess]] cult associated with "dynamic life energy" and asserts that the images may be related to a cultural continuity persisting since Neolithic examples. She defined the gorgoneion as a quintessentially European image. [[Jane Ellen Harrison]], on the other hand, claims that many primitive cultures use similar ritual masks in order to scare the owner from doing something wrong, or, as she terms it, to make an ugly face at the owner: "The ritual object comes first; then the monster is begotten to account for it; then the hero is supplied to account for the slaying of the monster".&lt;ref name="Harrison"&gt;{{harvnb|Harrison|1991|pp=187–188}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
[[Homer]] refers to the Gorgon on four occasions, each time alluding to the head alone, as if she had no body.&lt;ref name="Potts"&gt;{{harvnb|Potts|1982|pp=26–28}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jane Ellen Harrison]] notes that "Medusa is a head and nothing more... a [[mask]] with a body later appended".&lt;ref name="Harrison"/&gt; Prior to the fifth century BC, she was depicted as particularly ugly, with a protruding tongue, [[boar]] [[tusk]]s, puffy cheeks, her eyeballs staring fixedly on the viewer and the snakes twisting all around her.

The direct frontal stare, "seemingly looking out from its own iconographical context and directly challenging the viewer",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ogden|2008|p=35}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was highly unusual in ancient Greek art. (''But see'' the common depiction of the [[Evil_eye#Greece|evil eye]] on 6th century drinking vessels, and particularly, [[eye-cup]]s, which, like Gorgoneia, are assumed apotropaics.) In some instances what sometimes appears as a beard (probably standing for stylized hair or streaks of blood however) was appended to her chin, making her appear as an [[Dionysian Mysteries|orgiastic deity]] akin to [[Dionysus]].

Gorgoneia that decorate the shields of warriors on mid-fifth century Greek vases are considerably less grotesque and menacing. By that time, the Gorgon had lost her tusks and the snakes were rather stylized.&lt;ref name="Potts"/&gt; The [[Hellenistic]] marble known as the [[Medusa Rondanini]] illustrates the Gorgon's eventual transformation into a beautiful woman.&lt;ref name="Potts"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:OlympiaGorgo retouched.jpg|thumb|[[Winged Gorgoneion (Olympia B 110)|Winged Gorgoneion]] from [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], originally an [[apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] shield decoration, early sixth century BC]]
[[File:Gorgoneion Cdm Paris 320.jpg|thumb|Gorgoneion on the Tondo of an [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] Attic [[Black-figure pottery|black-figured]] cup, end of sixth century BC - Cabinet des médailles de la Bibliothèque nationale de France, Paris, France.]]
Gorgoneia appear frequently in Greek art at the turn of the eighth century BC. One of the earliest representations is on an [[electrum]] [[stater]] discovered during excavations at [[Parium]].&lt;ref name="Potts"/&gt; Other early eighth-century examples were found at [[Tiryns]]. Going further back into history, there is a similar image from the [[Knossos]] palace, datable to the fifteenth century BC. [[Marija Gimbutas]] even argues that "the Gorgon extends back to at least 6000 BC, as a ceramic mask from the [[Sesklo culture]] illustrates",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gimbutas|2001|p=25}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in her book, ''Language of the Goddess'', she also identifies the prototype of the Gorgoneion in [[Neolithic]] art motifs, especially in [[anthropomorphic]] vases and [[terracotta]] masks inlaid with gold.

In the sixth century, gorgoneia of a canonical "lion mask type" were ubiquitous on Greek temples, especially in and around [[Corinth]]. [[Pediment]]al gorgoneia were common in [[Sicily]]; probably the earliest occurrence being in the [[Temple of Apollo (Syracuse)|Temple of Apollo]] in [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]].&lt;ref name="Marconi"&gt;{{harvnb|Marconi|2007|pp=214–217}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 500 BC, they ceased to be used for the decoration of monumental buildings, but were still shown on [[antefix]]es of smaller structures throughout the next century.&lt;ref name="Marconi"/&gt;

Apart from temples, the Gorgon imagery is present on dress, dishes, weapons, and coins found across the Mediterranean region from [[Etruria]] to the [[Black Sea]] coast. The Gorgon coins were struck in 37 cities, making her image on coins second in [[numismatics|numismatic ubiquity]] only to several principal [[Olympian gods]].&lt;ref name="Potts"/&gt; On [[mosaic]] floors, the gorgoneion usually was depicted next to the threshold, as if guarding it from hostile intruders. On [[Attica|Attic]] kilns, the gorgoneion over the kiln door protected from mishaps.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harrison|1991|pp=189, figs. 27–30}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gorgon imagery remained popular even in Christian times, especially in the [[Byzantine Empire]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Deutsches Archäologisches Institut|1991|p=132}}.&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Kievan Rus]], and was revived in the West by the [[Italian Renaissance]] artists.

More recently, the gorgoneion was adopted by [[Gianni Versace]] as a logo for his fashion company.

This '''timeline of the Big Bang''' shows a sequence of events as currently theorized by scientists. 

It is a [[logarithmic scale]] that shows &lt;math&gt;10 \cdot \log_{10}&lt;/math&gt; ''second'' instead of ''second''. For example, one microsecond is &lt;math&gt;10 \cdot \log_{10} 0.000 001 = 10 \cdot (-6) = -60&lt;/math&gt;. To convert −30 read on the scale to second calculate &lt;math&gt;10^{-\frac{30}{10}} = 10^{-3} = 0.001&lt;/math&gt; second = one millisecond. On a logarithmic time scale a step lasts ten times longer than the previous step.

'''Hamburger University''' is a {{convert|130000|sqft|sing=on}} [[training]] facility of [[McDonald's]], located in [[Oak Brook, Illinois]], a western [[suburb]] of [[Chicago]]. This [[corporate university]] was designed to instruct personnel employed by McDonald's in the various aspects of [[restaurant management]]. More than 80,000 restaurant managers, mid-managers and owner/operators have "graduated" from this facility.&lt;ref name="hamu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aboutmcdonalds.com/mcd/corporate_careers/training_and_development/hamburger_university.html|title=Hamburger University|publisher=McDonald's|date=2011|accessdate=23 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
Since its establishment, Hamburger University has been situated on an {{convert|80|acre}} campus. Restaurant employees receive approximately 32 hours of training in their first month with McDonald's and more than 5,000 students attend Hamburger University each year. Founder [[Ray Kroc]] oversaw lessons at its beginning.

In 2016 McDonald's Corporation announced it would move its U.S. and world headquarters including Hamburger University from its long time home in Oak Brook to a newly built complex on property which formerly housed [[Oprah Winfrey]]'s [[Harpo Productions|Harpo Studios]] in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2016/06/13/mcdonalds-moving-headquarters-to-chicago/85821422/ McDonald's moving headquarters to downtown Chicago by 2018] (Retrieved from USA Today on 31 March 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-mcdonalds-headquarters-0603-biz-20160602-story.html McDonald's to move HQ to Chicago as soon as 2018, source says] (Retrieved from the Chicago Tribune on 31 March 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-mcdonalds-oak-brook-property-20180112-story.html McDonald's begins selling off Oak Brook property before headquarters move] (Retrieved from the Chicago Tribune on 31 March 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 2017 McDonald's put up for sale or sold most of its Oak Brook campus.

==Popular culture==
Hamburger University was satirized in the 1986 comedy, ''[[Hamburger... The Motion Picture]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{BFI Explore|id=4ce2b722ee9e8|title=Hamburger - The Motion Picture}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also spoofed by McDonald's itself in a commercial with [[Ronald McDonald]] in which several [[animatronic]] hamburgers were shown graduating from school.

The '''Hamshahri Corpus''' ({{lang-fa|'''پیکره همشهری'''}}) is a sizable [[Persian language|Persian]] corpus based on the Iranian newspaper ''[[Hamshahri]]'', one of the first online [[Persian language|Persian]] newspapers in Iran. It was in initially collected and compiled by Ehsan Darrudi at DBRG Group&lt;ref&gt;[http://dbrg.ut.ac.ir/ DBRG News] Database Research Group&lt;/ref&gt; of [[University of Tehran]]. Later a team headed by Ale Ahmad &lt;ref name=ham&gt;[http://dbrg.ut.ac.ir/hamshahri/ Hamshahri] Database Research Group&lt;/ref&gt; built on this corpus and created the first Persian Text Collection suitable for information retrieval evaluation tasks.

This corpus was created by crawling the online news articles from the [[Hamshahri]]'s website and processing the HTML pages to create a standard text corpus for modern [[Information Retrieval]] experiments.

== Version 1.0 ==
The collection contains more than 160,000 articles covering the following subject categories: politics, city news, economics, reports, editorials, literature, sciences, Society, foreign news, sports, etc. The size of the documents varies from short news (under 1 KB) to rather long articles (e.g. 140 KB) with the average of 1.8 KB. 

The corpus is available in several formats for download:&lt;ref name=ham/&gt;
* Tagged Text: 560 MB
* In SQL Server 2000 Tables: 712 MB

== Version 2.0 ==
The second release of Hamshahri Corpus was launched on 20 October 2008. It offers several new features and improvements:
* '''More News:''' 323,616 Text Stories in 3206 XML files (a file for each day)
* '''Increased Time Span:''' From 22 June 1996 to 13 May 2007
* '''Bigger in Size:''' 1.42 GB uncompressed
* '''Standard Container:''' Unicode XML
* '''Included Images:''' images have been extracted from the news and preserved (available in an additional package), which makes it suitable for Image Retrieval tasks.
* '''Categorized News:''' the news stories have been categorized semi-automatically (appropriate for Text Categorization and Classification tasks).

The corpus is available for download in XML format.

'''Harrison’s rule''' is an observation in evolutionary biology by Launcelot Harrison which states that in comparisons across closely related species, host and parasite body sizes tend to covary positively.

== Parasite species’ body size increases with host species’ body size== 
Launcelot Harrison, an Australian authority in zoology and parasitology, published a study in 1915 concluding that host and parasite body sizes tend to covary positively,&lt;ref name=Harrison_1915&gt; {{cite journal | last= Harrison| first=Launcelot| title =Mallophaga from Apteryx, and their significance; with a note on the genus Rallicola | journal= [[ Parasitology]] | year=1915 | volume=8 | pages=88–100 | url= http://www.phthiraptera.info/Publications/0182.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; a covariation later dubbed as 'Harrison’s rule'. Harrison himself originally proposed it to interpret the variability of congeneric [[louse]] species. However, subsequent authors verified it for a wide variety of parasitic organisms including [[nematodes]],&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal | last1 = Kirchner | first1 = TB | last2 = Anderson | first2 = RV| last3 = Ingham | first3 = RE|  title = Natural selection and the distribution of nematode sizes | journal= [[Ecology (journal) | Ecology]] | year= 1980| volume = 61 | pages= 232–237}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Harveyetal&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harvey | first1 = PH| last2 = Keymer | first2 = AE| title = Comparing life histories using phylogenies | journal= [[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B]]| year= 1991| volume = 332 | pages= 31–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal | last1 = Morand | first1 = S| last2 = Legendre | first2 = P| last3 = Gardner | first3 = SL| last4 = Hugot | first4 = JP| title = Body size evolution of oxyurid (Nematoda) parasites: the role of hosts | journal= [[Oecologia]] | year= 1996| volume =  107| pages=274–282 | url= https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://scholar.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1082&amp;context=parasitologyfacpubs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal | last1 = Morand | first1 = S| last2 = Sorci | first2 = G| title = Determinants of life-history evolution in nematodes | journal= [[Parasitology Today]] | year= 1998| volume =  14| pages=193–196 |url= https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/42637076/Determinants_of_Life-history_Evolution_i20160212-1576-1hyxt2f.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1522433278&amp;Signature=HpOSTvmt%2F3St5u2%2FMJuahK8ICCM%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DDeterminants_of_life-history_evolution_i.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rhizocephala | rhizocephalan barnacles]],&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal | last1 = Poulin | first1 = R| last2 = Hamilton | first2 = WJ | title = Ecological correlates of body size and egg size in parasitic Ascothoracida and Rhizocephala (Crustacea) | journal= Acta Oecologica | year= 1997| volume =  18| pages=621–635 | url = https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/45685938/s1146-609x_2897_2980047-120160516-31435-jwqyhj.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1522433364&amp;Signature=LcVBc91CR%2F4%2BfvR8bHW69ltMOSY%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DEcological_correlates_of_body_size_and_e.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[fleas]], [[lice]], [[ticks]], parasitic [[flies]] and [[mites]], as well as herbivorous insects associated with specific host plants.&lt;ref name=Harveyetal&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal | last1 = Morand | first1 = S| last2 = Hafner | first2 = MS | last3 = Page| first3 = RDM| last4= Reed| first4 = DL| title = Comparative body size relationships in pocket gophers and their chewing lice | journal= [[Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society]] | year= 2000| volume = 70 | pages= 239–249 | url= http://www.phthiraptera.info/Publications/37965.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal | last1 = Johnson | first1 = KP| last2 = Bush| first2 = SE| last3 = Clayton | first3 = DH| title = Correlated evolution of host and parasite body size: tests of Harrison’s rule using birds and lice | journal= [[Evolution]] | year= 2005| volume = 59 | pages= 1744–1753 |url = http://www.phthiraptera.info/Publications/46181.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The variability of parasite species’ body size increases with host species’ body size==
[[Robert Poulin (zoologist)|Robert Poulin]] observed that in comparisons across species, the [[Statistical dispersion|variability]] of parasite body size also increases with host body size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Poulin|first=R|title= Evolutionary ecology of parasites |year=2006|publisher= Princeton University Press | isbn= 9780691120850}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
It is self-evident that we expect greater variation coming together with greater mean body sizes due to an allometric [[power law]] scaling effect.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal | last1 = Xiao | first1 = X| last2 = White | first2 = EP| last3 = Hooten | first3 = MB | last4 = Durham | first4 =SL| title = On the use of log-transformation vs. nonlinear regression for analyzing biological power-laws | journal= [[Ecology (journal) | Ecology]] | year= 2011| volume = 92| pages= 1887–1894}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Poulin referred to parasites’ increasing body size variability due to biological reasons, thus we expect an increase greater than that caused by a scaling effect.

Recently, Harnos et al. applied phylogenetically controlled statistical methods to test Harrison’s rule and Poulin’s s Increasing Variance Hypothesis in avian lice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harnos | first1 = A| last2 = Lang | first2 = Z| last3 = Petras | first3 = D | last4 = Bush | first4 =SE| last5 = Szabo | first5 =K| last6 = Rozsa | first6 =L| title = Size matters for lice on birds: coevolutionary allometry of host and parasite body size | journal= [[Evolution (journal) | Evolution]] | year= 2017| volume = 92| pages= 1887–1894 | url= http://www.zoologia.hu/list/2017%20Evolution.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their results indicate that the three major families of avian lice ([[Ricinidae]], [[Menoponidae]], [[Philopteridae]]) follow Harrison’s rule, and two of them (Menoponidae, Philopteridae) also follow Poulin’s supplement to it.

==Implications==
The [[allometry]] between host and parasite body sizes constitutes an evident aspect of [[host–parasite coevolution]]. The slope of this relationship is a taxon-specific character. Parasites' body size is known to covary positively with fecundity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Villa | first1 = SM| last2 = Evans | first2 = MD| last3 = Subhani | first3 = YK | last4 = Altuna | first4 = JC| last5 = Bush | first5 = SE| last6 = Clayton | first6 = DH| title = Body size and fecundity are correlated in feather lice (Phthiraptera: Ischnocera): implications for Harrison's rule | journal= [[Ecological Entomology]] (in press)| year= 2018| volume = | pages= | url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus it likely affects the [[virulence]] of parasitic infections as well.

The '''Subject Centre for History, Classics and Archaeology''' was one of 24 Subject Centres funded within the [[Higher Education Academy]] to promote high quality learning and teaching in [[UK]] [[Higher Education]] (HE) by providing subject-based support for sharing innovations and good practices. Initially the only one of the 24 Subject Centres to be sited in Scotland, it was hosted originally by the [[University of Glasgow]] and later by the [[University of Liverpool]]. Its various Directors were Dr Andrew Roach, Dr Donald Spaeth, Colin Brooks and Dr Anthony Sinclair.

The Higher Education Academy itself came into being in 2004 through the amalgamation of the Learning and Teaching Support Network (LTSN), the Institute for the Learning and Teaching in Higher Education (ILTHE) and the Higher Education Staff Development Agency (HESDA) in order to enable comprehensive, knowledgeable support for practitioners and institutions with an aim to the greater professionalisation of HE teaching.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hefce.ac.uk/news/hefce/2003/tqec.htm HEFCE : News : 2003 : 27 January 2003&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Subject Centre for History, Classics and Archaeology supported teaching and learning in [[history]], [[archaeology]], and [[classics]] as broadly defined (the study of the languages and cultures of the [[Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] Worlds, including [[Byzantine Studies]] and Classical Reception Studies). 

The key role of HCA was to be a "one stop shop" for the subject communities for matters relating to learning and teaching both at an individual subject level and with regard to common issues across these three [[Humanities]] disciplines. HCA did this by identifying, collecting and disseminating information and material on good practice in teaching and learning, enabling practitioners to share their experience with colleagues for mutual benefit. HCA both funded &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heacademy.ac.uk/hca/funding/tdg Subject Centre for History, Classics and Archaeology - funding TDG&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and published disciplinary specific pedagogical research (Ped Res) and development (Ped Dev) and [[scholarship of teaching and learning]] (SOTL).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heacademy.ac.uk/hca/themes/practice/pedr Subject Centre for History, Classics and Archaeology - practice &amp; CPD, pedagogic research&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Subject Centre for History, Classics and Archaeology worked in conjunction with its various subject associations and other relevant national organisations to influence the development of policy and practice within History, Classics and Archaeology in UK higher education. It held several well-attended 3-day Teaching &amp; Learning in History conferences annually at Lady Margaret Hall, University of Oxford.

'''Hydrophily''' is a fairly uncommon form of [[pollination]] whereby [[pollen]] is distributed by the flow of [[water]]s, particularly in [[river]]s and [[stream]]s. Hydrophilous species fall into two categories: 
(i) Those that distribute their pollen to the surface of water. e.g. ''Vallisneria'''s male flower or pollen grain are released on the surface of water, which are passively carried away by water currents; some of them eventually reach the female flower
(ii) Those that distribute it beneath the surface. e.g. seagrasses in which female flower remain submergered in water and pollen grains are released inside the water.

==Surface pollination==
Surface pollination is more frequent,&lt;ref name=encyclopedia&gt;{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and appears to be a transitional phase between [[anemophily|wind pollination]] and true hydrophily. In these the pollen floats on the surface and reaches the stigmas of the female flowers as in ''[[Hydrilla]]'', ''[[Callitriche]]'', ''[[Ruppia]]'', ''[[Zostera]]'', ''[[Elodea]]''. In ''[[Vallisneria]]'' the male flowers become detached and float on the surface of the water; the anthers are thus brought in contact with the stigmas of the female flowers.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia /&gt; Surface hydrophily has been observed in several species of ''[[Potamogeton]]'' as well as some marine species.

==Submerged pollination==
Species exhibiting true submerged hydrophily include ''[[Najas]]'', where the pollen grains are heavier than water, and sinking down are caught by the stigmas of the extremely simple female flowers,&lt;ref name=encyclopedia /&gt; ''[[Posidonia australis]]'' and ''[[Zostera marina]]''.{{sfn|Cox|1988|pp=261–279}}

'''James Charles Napier Webb''' (13 January 1946 – 9 May 1980) was a Scottish historian and biographer. He was born in [[Edinburgh]], and was educated at [[Harrow School|Harrow]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]. He is remembered primarily for his books ''The Harmonious Circle'', ''The Occult Underground'' (originally titled ''Flight from Reason''), and ''The Occult Establishment''.

In 1980 his important biography of [[G. I. Gurdjieff]], titled ''The Harmonious Circle'', was published. He spent 8 years researching the book, making contacts with the Gurdjieff community worldwide. The New York Review of Books described Webb's research and knowledge of the subject as "extremely comprehensive",&lt;ref&gt;Rosemary Dinnage, "The Great Mystifier", The New York Review of Books, 23 October 1980. [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1980/oct/23/the-great-mystifier/]&lt;/ref&gt; and Mistlberger described the book as "scholarly and occasionally gossipy" with Webb being "unquestionably a sincere researcher" who became "deeply involved in the matter of his subject" while remaining "fundamentally an outsider, an investigative journalist".&lt;ref&gt;P. T. Mistlberger, "The Three Dangerous Magi: Osho, Gurdjieff, Crowley", 2010, pages 327 &amp; 397.&lt;/ref&gt; Tamdgidi wrote that, amongst all the biographers of Gurdjieff, "only Webb claimed to have been independent and outside the circle of Gurdjieff's followers", and in 2004, in ''Inventors of Gurdjieff'', Paul Beekman Taylor described ''The Harmonious Circle'' as "the first systematic biographical account by a writer who hadn't known Gurdjieff personally"&lt;ref&gt;Mohammad H. Tamdgidi, "Gurdjieff and Hypnosis: A Hermeneutic Study", Palgrave Macmillan, 2009. Pages 15 &amp; 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Webb established that Gurdjieff's writings revealed substantial evidence of familiarity with the languages and cultures of central Asia, but Webb regarded Gurdjieff more as a self-taught innovator than a member of an esoteric Asiatic group, and, although seeing some of its forms having derived from Asia, saw the content of his teachings deriving from western occult traditions.&lt;ref&gt;K. Paul Johnson, "Initiates of Theosophical Masters", State University of New York Press, 1995, p140.&lt;/ref&gt;

Webb's theories of Gurdjieff's identity as a Russian foreign agent in Central Asia,&lt;ref&gt;Gary Lachman, "Politics and the Occult: The Left, the Right, and the Radically Unseen", 2008, Quest Books, pp124-125. {{ISBN|978-0835608572}}&lt;/ref&gt; and theories on where he actually travelled before 1917, are considered controversial points in ''The Harmonious Circle''.

Webb's work challenges theories of [[secularism]], theories of decline in organised religion and [[spirituality]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Webb argued that the 19th and 20th centuries had also been marked by a revolt against the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], and that the rise of ''irrationalism'' was much more marked than the rise of rationalism, especially before, during and after the [[First World War]] and the [[Second World War]]. Webb traced the influence of [[occult]] and [[mysticism|mystical]] groups and writers on literature, philosophy and politics.

Webb was generally ignored in his lifetime, but with the increasing rise of [[New Age]] spirituality in later years, his work now seems increasingly prescient. After increasing mental health difficulties, Webb committed suicide in 1980.

[[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]] has lauded him as a serious researcher of occultism: "By focusing on functional significance of occultism in political irrationalism, Webb rescued the study of [[Nazi occultism]] for the [[history of ideas]]."&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, The Occult Roots of Nazism: The Ariosophists of Austria and Germany 1890–1935, originally published in 1985 by the Aquarian Press in Wellingborough, England&lt;/ref&gt;

His major works ''The Occult Underground'' and ''The Occult Establishment'' were translated into German and published in 2009 and 2008 respectively.

[[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]] established the "James Webb Prize for the History of Ideas" in his memory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forteantimes.com/features/articles/264/the_damned_the_strange_death_of_james_webb.html Gary Lachman, "The Damned: the strange death of James Webb"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722035959/http://www.forteantimes.com/features/articles/264/the_damned_the_strange_death_of_james_webb.html |date=22 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/history-subject-notes Trinity College, History Subject Notes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007194611/http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/history-subject-notes |date=7 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9580">[[File:Jug from Lydian Treasure Usak.jpg|thumb|200px|Jug from Lydian Treasure found near Uşak]] 

'''Karun Treasure''' is the name given to a collection of 363 valuable [[Lydia]]n artifacts dating from the 7th century BC and originating from [[Uşak Province]] in western Turkey belonging to Karun Khan Bhutto, which were the subject of a [[legal battle]] between [[Turkey]] and [[New York Metropolitan Museum of Art]] between 1987–1993 and which were returned to Turkey in 1993 after the Museum admitted it had known the objects were stolen when they had purchased them. The collection is alternatively known as the ''Lydian Hoard''. The items are exhibited in the [[Uşak Museum of Archaeology]].

The collection made sensational news once again in May 2006 when a key piece, a golden [[hippocamp]], on display in [[Uşak]] Museum along with the rest of the collection, was discovered to have been switched with a [[counterfeit|fake]], probably between March and August 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/5027074.stm | title = Croesus riches replaced by fakes|author=|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]| accessdate=2006-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Yet another term used for the collection is "Croesus Treasure". Although the artifacts were closely contemporary to [[Croesus]], whether they should be directly associated with the legendary Lydian king or not remains debatable. Croesus' wealth had repercussions on a number of [[Asia]]n cultures in a vein similar to his fame in the western cultures, and is referred to either as ''Qarun'' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Urdu language|Urdu]]) or Karun ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]), or [[Korah]], with the mythical proportions of his fortune also echoed in various ways, parallel to the [[English language]] expression "as rich as Croesus".&lt;ref&gt;Qarun and reference to his wealth mentioned in the [[Koran]] (''[28:76] to [28:82]''). In [[Persian mythology]], to which the other citations could be connected, the ''Qârun Treasure'' is a treasure said to be in perpetual motion under the ground. The phrase ''harta karun'' (literally Croesus' Wealth) also worked into the Malay language as the word for ''treasure'' and is synonymous with the term ''buried treasure''. ''Ganj-e-Qarun'' (Croesus Treasure) was also an [[Iran]]ian movie made in 1965 by [[Siamak Yasami]] and widely regarded as one of the classics of [[Iranian cinema]]. The movie recounts the story of a very wealthy man who attempts suicide and then finds happiness in the simplicity of a pauper's home.&lt;/ref&gt; This explains why the term "Karun Treasure" took hold, and in any case, the king Croesus' Treasure consisted of more than 363 pieces and the tomb chamber [[tumulus]] where most artifacts were discovered (they originate from close but different sites) was that of a woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.serfed.com/dergi/10/15-ANADOLU_UYGARLIKLARI.pdf|title=The rich kings of the thousand hills, Lydians|last=|first=|date=|website=http://www.serfed.com|publisher=Turkish Ceramic Federation|author=Nezih Başgelen|accessdate=2005-07-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070122153206/http://www.serfed.com/dergi/10/15-ANADOLU_UYGARLIKLARI.pdf|archivedate=January 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery and smuggling==
The main and the most precious part of the treasure comes from a tomb chamber of a Lydian princess reached through illegal excavations carried out by three fortune-seekers from Uşak's depending Güre village, at the proximity of which the tomb was located, at the locality called Toptepe. After having dug for days and unable to break through the marble masonry of the chamber door, they had [[dynamite]]d the roof of the tomb in the night of 6 June 1966, to be the first to see the breathtaking sight of the buried Lydian noblewoman and her treasures after 2600 years. The treasure looted from this particular tomb was enriched by further finds by the same men in other [[tumuli]] of the locality during 1966-1967. The collection was smuggled outside Turkey in separate dispatches through [[İzmir]] and [[Amsterdam]], to be bought by the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] between 1967–1968, at an invoiced cost of $1.2 million for 200 of the pieces within the collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tayproject.org/Haber.fm$Retrieve?ID=1267&amp;html=haber_detail_tu.html&amp;layout=web|title=Uşak-New York|last=|first=|date=|website=http://www.tayproject.org|publisher=TAY Project|language=Turkish|author=|accessdate=2001-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal battle==

The efforts made by successive Turkish governments to retrieve the collection were incited since the very beginning and followed until conclusion by the journalist [[Özgen Acar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/courier/2001_04/uk/doss27.htm |title=We have to change the buyer's attitude |author=Michel Bessières |publisher=[[UNESCO]] Courrier |accessdate=2001-04-01 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010723161923/http://www.unesco.org/courier/2001_04/uk/doss27.htm |archivedate=2001-07-23 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Acar had chanced upon some pieces of the collection for the first time in 1984 in a Met Museum [[Collection catalog|catalogue]] and had informed Turkey's [[Culture and Tourism Ministry of Turkey|Ministry of Culture]] of their clear provenance, while he also wrote several articles and pursued the bureaucratic channels within Turkey with insistence throughout the affair. He acted as a voluntary envoy of the Ministry within the frame of the judicial case launched in [[New York City]] in 1987 and brought to conclusion in 1993,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.herrick.com/Upload/Publication/Articles/ArticleHF_0208.pdf|title=The Art Theft Experts|author=Thomas Adcock|publisher=[[New York Law Journal]]|accessdate=2006-02-24|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061031010110/http://www.herrick.com/Upload/Publication/Articles/ArticleHF_0208.pdf|archivedate=2006-10-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the same time as he was named [[consultant]] in the larger framework of the Turkey's participation in the work carried out by [[UNIDROIT]] regarding the protection of historic, cultural and religious heritage. Acar's name is also synonymous in Turkey for the retrieval of another set of smuggled archaeological goods, termed "Elmalı Treasure" in reference to their site of origin, the town of [[Elmalı]] in southwestern Turkey, and involving this time [[Lydia]]n coins and extremely rare [[drachma|decadrachms]] dating from the period of the [[Delian League]], with the [[Boston Museum of Fine Arts]] as his opposite party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum-security.org/reports/003199.html#8|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000823041626/http://museum-security.org/reports/003199.html#8|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2000-08-23|title=Elmalı treasure|author=|publisher=Museum Security|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uşak Museum case==
The clear need for a museum worthy of the treasure was being voiced ever since the artifacts had returned to Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.worldpress.org/Europe/1491.cfm | title = Croesus: The poverty of treasure|author=[[Özgen Acar]]|publisher=[[Cumhuriyet]]| accessdate=2003-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the seizure by the authorities of ten other illegally excavated artifacts in 1998, further archaeological discoveries and the known presence of eight gold pieces that had appeared in 2000 during an exhibition in a [[Paris]] private gallery for which attempts for retrieval were yet to be made, a handsome collection of base consisting of a total of 375 pieces was already accumulated. But the small museum in [[Uşak]] where the collection was placed, more focused on storage of [[Ushak carpet]]s and operating under conditions of budgetary and staff restraints,&lt;ref&gt;The number of experts working in Turkish museums halved from 1,500 to 750 in the last ten years. {{cite web|url=http://www.turkishdailynews.com.tr/article.php?enewsid=48792|title=Croesus: Ten people charged in Croesus theft case|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Turkish Daily News]]|author=|accessdate=2003-07-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060717031211/http://www.turkishdailynews.com.tr/article.php?enewsid=48792|archivedate=2006-07-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; did not fully meet the requirements for the preservation of Karun Treasure. Doubts about the site's suitability were reinforced by the filing of currently unresolved legal action against museum staff regarding the 2007 theft. The museum's former director remains the only person to be still kept in [[police custody|custody]] among the ten initially accused in the frame of the case around the hippocamp's replacement with a fake.

==Curse of the treasure==
Some{{who|date=December 2013}} in Uşak and beyond associate the treasure with a [[curse]]. Legend has it that the seven men who took part in the illegal digs "died violent deaths or suffered great misfortune".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/25/king-croesus-treasure-returning-turkey|title= King Croesus's golden brooch to be returned to Turkey |work=The Guardian|author=Constanze Letsch|date=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kashinhou''' (化審法), short for {{nihongo|化学物質の審査及び製造等の規制に関する法律|Kagaku Busshitsu no Shinsa Oyobi Seizoutou no Kisei ni Kansuru Houritsu}}, ("Law Concerning the Examination and Regulation of Manufacture, etc. of Chemical Substances") (Showa Act No. 117, 昭和48年法律第117号) is the current Chemicals and dangerous substances regulation law in Japan.  The more concise abbreviated name is {{nihongo|化学物質審査規制法|Kagaku Busshitsu Shinsa Kiseihou}}, or "Chemical Substances Control Law". This law featured the world's first new chemical pre-examination system.

== Coverage ==
This law was established to provide a framework to examine the import, manufacture, and use of industrial chemicals and refractory organic substances for persistence and health consequences, as well as the necessary legal restrictions in order to achieve those aims.

== History ==
The law has its origins in 1968, with an illness related to [[polychlorinated biphenyls]] poisoning in the [[Kanemi Oil Incident]]. In 1973, this law was established, radically overturning a prevailing attitude that long term contaminants bioaccumulating in humans was not problematic. Refractory organic substances, highly enriched uranium, and substances that possess long term toxicity to humans were classified as Section 1 Chemical Substances. Section 1 items were banned from manufacture or importation.

In 1986, a Section 2 Chemical Substances was added, which included [[trichloroethylene]] and [[tetrachloroethylene]], which had contaminated groundwater. Questionable chemical substances that did not fall into above categories were introduced into a Section 2 Questionable Chemical substances category.

In 1999, the government ministries were reorganized, and the [[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)|Ministry of the Environment]] was added as an overseer to the precursor ministries of the current [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare]], [[Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry]].

In 2003, under pressure from the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]], a third Section was created to surveillance of chemical substances harmful to flora and fauna but not to humans.

Regulation, policing, and surveillance of other laws, namely the Poisonous and Deleterious Substance Control Law, Stimulant Control Law, and Narcotics and Psychotropics Control Law were transferred to the current ministries as mentioned above.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="77312">'''Lambda calculus''' (also written as '''λ-calculus''') is a [[formal system]] in [[mathematical logic]] for expressing [[computability|computation]] based on function [[Abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]] and [[function application|application]] using variable [[Name binding|binding]] and [[Substitution (algebra)|substitution]]. It is a universal [[model of computation]] that can be used to simulate any [[Turing machine]]. It was first introduced by mathematician [[Alonzo Church]] in the 1930s as part of his research of the [[foundations of mathematics]].

Lambda calculus consists of constructing lambda terms and performing reduction operations on them. In the simplest form of lambda calculus, terms are built using only the following rules:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Syntax !! Name !! Description
|-
| x || Variable || A character or string representing a parameter or mathematical/logical value
|-
| (λx.M) || Abstraction || Function definition (M is a lambda term). The variable x becomes [[Free variables and bound variables|bound]] in the expression.
|-
| (M N) || Application || Applying a function to an argument. M and N are lambda terms.
|}

producing expressions such as: (λ''x''.λ''y''.(λ''z''.(λ''x''.''z x'') (λ''y.z y'')) (''x y'')). Parentheses can be dropped if the expression is unambiguous. For some applications, terms for logical and mathematical constants and operations may be included.

The reduction operations include:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Operation !! Name !! Description
|-
| (λx.M[x]) → (λy.M[y]) || α-conversion || Renaming the bound (formal) variables in the expression. Used to avoid [[name collision]]s.
|-
| ((λx.M) E) → (M[x:=E]) || β-reduction || Replacing the bound variable with the argument expression in the body of the abstraction
|}

If [[De Bruijn index]]ing is used then α-conversion is no longer required as there will be no name collisions. If [[Reduction strategy (lambda calculus)|repeated application]] of the reduction steps eventually terminates then by the [[Church-Rosser theorem]] it will produce a [[beta normal form]].

==Explanation and applications==
Lambda calculus is [[Turing completeness|Turing complete]], that is, it is a universal [[model of computation]] that can be used to simulate any [[Turing machine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=A. M. |last=Turing |authorlink=Alan Turing |title=Computability and λ-Definability |jstor=2268280 |journal=The Journal of Symbolic Logic |volume=2 |issue=4 |date=December 1937 |pages=153–163 |doi=10.2307/2268280}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its namesake, the Greek letter lambda (λ), is used in '''lambda expressions''' and '''lambda terms''' to denote [[Free variables and bound variables|binding]] a variable in a [[function (mathematics)|function]].

Lambda calculus may be ''untyped'' or ''typed''. In typed lambda calculus, functions can be applied only if they are capable of accepting the given input's "type" of data. Typed lambda calculi are ''weaker'' than the untyped lambda calculus that is the primary subject of this article, in the sense that ''typed lambda calculi can express less'' than the untyped calculus can, but on the other hand typed lambda calculi allow more things to be proved; in the [[simply typed lambda calculus]] it is, for example, a theorem that every evaluation strategy terminates for every simply typed lambda-term, whereas evaluation of untyped lambda-terms need not terminate. One reason there are many different typed lambda calculi has been the desire to do more (of what the untyped calculus can do) without giving up on being able to prove strong theorems about the calculus.

Lambda calculus has applications in many different areas in [[mathematics]], [[philosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Thierry Coquand|Coquand, Thierry]], [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2013/entries/type-theory/ "Type Theory"], ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''  (Summer 2013 Edition), Edward N.

[[Functional programming language]]s implement the lambda calculus. Lambda calculus is also a current research topic in [[Category theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Basic Category Theory for Computer Scientists|page=53|first=Benjamin C.|last=Pierce|authorlink=Benjamin C.

==History==
The lambda calculus was introduced by mathematician [[Alonzo Church]] in the 1930s as part of an investigation into the [[foundations of mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=A. |last=Church |authorlink=Alonzo Church |title=A set of postulates for the foundation of logic |journal=Annals of Mathematics |series=Series 2 |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=346–366 |year=1932 |doi=10.2307/1968337 |jstor=1968337}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a full history, see Cardone and Hindley's "History of Lambda-calculus and Combinatory Logic" (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; The original system was shown to be [[Consistency|logically inconsistent]] in 1935 when [[Stephen Kleene]] and [[J. B. Rosser]] developed the [[Kleene–Rosser paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kleene|first1=S. C.|authorlink1=Stephen Kleene|last2=Rosser|first2=J. B.|authorlink2=J. B. Rosser|title=The Inconsistency of Certain Formal Logics|journal=The Annals of Mathematics|date=July 1935|volume=36|issue=3|pages=630|doi=10.2307/1968646}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Church|first=Alonzo|authorlink=Alonzo Church|title=Review of Haskell B.

Subsequently, in 1936 Church isolated and published just the portion relevant to computation, what is now called the untyped lambda calculus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=A. |last=Church |authorlink=Alonzo Church |title=An unsolvable problem of elementary number theory |journal=American Journal of Mathematics |volume=58 |number=2 |year=1936 |pages=345–363 |doi=10.2307/2371045 |jstor=2371045 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940, he also introduced a computationally weaker, but logically consistent system, known as the [[simply typed lambda calculus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Church | authorlink=Alonzo Church | first1 = A. | year = 1940 | title = A Formulation of the Simple Theory of Types | journal = Journal of Symbolic Logic | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 56–68 | doi=10.2307/2266170 |jstor=2266170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 1960s when its relation to programming languages was clarified, the λ-calculus was only a formalism. Thanks to [[Richard Montague]] and other linguists' applications in the semantics of natural language, the λ-calculus has begun to enjoy a respectable place in both linguistics&lt;ref name='mm-linguistics'&gt;{{cite book|last1=Partee|first1=B.

Zalta (ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Informal description==
{{no footnotes|section|date=September 2013}}

===Motivation===
[[Computable function]]s are a fundamental concept within computer science and mathematics. The λ-calculus provides a simple [[Semantics#Computer science|semantics]] for computation, enabling properties of computation to be studied formally. The λ-calculus incorporates two simplifications that make this semantics simple.
The first simplification is that the λ-calculus treats functions "anonymously", without giving them explicit names. For example, the function 
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{square\_sum}(x, y) = x^2 + y^2&lt;/math&gt;
can be rewritten in ''anonymous form'' as 
:&lt;math&gt;(x, y) \mapsto x^2 + y^2&lt;/math&gt;
(read as "a tuple of {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} is [[Map (mathematics)|mapped]] to &lt;math display="inline"&gt;x^2 + y^2&lt;/math&gt;"). Similarly, 
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{id}(x) = x&lt;/math&gt;
can be rewritten in anonymous form as
:&lt;math&gt;x \mapsto x&lt;/math&gt;
where the input is simply mapped to itself.

The second simplification is that the λ-calculus only uses functions of a single input. An ordinary function that requires two inputs, for instance the &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\operatorname{square\_sum}&lt;/math&gt; function, can be reworked into an equivalent function that accepts a single input, and as output returns ''another'' function, that in turn accepts a single input. For example, 
:&lt;math&gt;(x, y) \mapsto x^2 + y^2&lt;/math&gt;
can be reworked into 
:&lt;math&gt;x \mapsto (y \mapsto x^2 + y^2)&lt;/math&gt;
This method, known as [[currying]], transforms a function that takes multiple arguments into a chain of functions each with a single argument.

[[Function application]] of the &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\operatorname{square\_sum}&lt;/math&gt; function to the arguments (5, 2), yields at once
:&lt;math display="inline"&gt;((x, y) \mapsto x^2 + y^2)(5, 2)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math display="inline"&gt; = 5^2 + 2^2 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math display="inline"&gt; = 29&lt;/math&gt;,
whereas evaluation of the curried version requires one more step
:&lt;math display="inline"&gt;\Bigl(\bigl(x \mapsto (y \mapsto x^2 + y^2)\bigr)(5)\Bigr)(2)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math display="inline"&gt; = (y \mapsto 5^2 + y^2)(2)&lt;/math&gt; // the definition of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; has been used with &lt;math&gt;5&lt;/math&gt; in the inner expression.  This is like β-reduction.
:&lt;math display="inline"&gt; = 5^2 + 2^2&lt;/math&gt;  // the definition of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; has been used with &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;. Again, similar to β-reduction.
:&lt;math display="inline"&gt; = 29&lt;/math&gt;
to arrive at the same result.

===The lambda calculus===
The lambda calculus consists of a language of '''lambda terms''', which is defined by a certain formal syntax, and a set of transformation rules, which allow manipulation of the lambda terms. These transformation rules can be viewed as an equational theory or as an [[operational definition]].

As described above, all functions in the lambda calculus are anonymous functions, having no names. They only accept one input variable, with currying used to implement functions with several variables.

====Lambda terms====

The syntax of the lambda calculus defines some expressions as valid lambda calculus expressions and some as invalid, just as some strings of characters are valid [[C (programming language)|C]] programs and some are not. A valid lambda calculus expression is called a "lambda term".

The following three rules give an [[inductive definition]] that can be applied to build all syntactically valid lambda terms:
* a variable, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, is itself a valid lambda term
* if &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is a lambda term, and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is a variable, then &lt;math&gt;(\lambda x.t)&lt;/math&gt; is a lambda term (called a '''lambda abstraction''');
* if &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; are lambda terms, then &lt;math&gt;(ts)&lt;/math&gt; is a lambda term (called an '''application''').
Nothing else is a lambda term. Thus a lambda term is valid if and only if it can be obtained by repeated application of these three rules. However, some parentheses can be omitted according to certain rules. For example, the outermost parentheses are usually not written. See ''[[#Notation|Notation]]'', below.

A '''lambda abstraction''' &lt;math&gt;\lambda x.t&lt;/math&gt; is a definition of an anonymous function that is capable of taking a single input &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and substituting it into the expression &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. 
It thus defines an anonymous function that takes &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and returns &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. For example, &lt;math&gt;\lambda x.x^2+2&lt;/math&gt; is a lambda abstraction for the function &lt;math&gt;f(x) = x^2 + 2&lt;/math&gt; using the term &lt;math&gt;x^2+2&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. The definition of a function with a lambda abstraction merely "sets up" the function but does not invoke it.  The abstraction [[Free variables and bound variables|binds]] the variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in the term &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.

An '''application''' &lt;math&gt;ts&lt;/math&gt; represents the application of a function &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; to an input &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;, that is, it represents the act of calling function &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; on input &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; to produce &lt;math&gt;t(s)&lt;/math&gt;.

There is no concept in lambda calculus of variable declaration. In a definition such as &lt;math&gt;\lambda x.x+y&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. &lt;math&gt;f(x) = x + y&lt;/math&gt;), the lambda calculus treats &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; as a variable that is not yet defined. The lambda abstraction &lt;math&gt;\lambda x.x+y&lt;/math&gt; is syntactically valid, and represents a function that adds its input to the yet-unknown &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.

Bracketing may be used and may be needed to disambiguate terms. For example, &lt;math&gt;\lambda x.((\lambda x.x)x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(\lambda x.(\lambda x.x)) x&lt;/math&gt; denote different terms (although they coincidentally reduce to the same value). Here the first example defines a function that defines a function and returns the result of applying x to the child-function (apply function then return), while the second example defines a function that returns a function for any input and then returns it on application of x (return function then apply).

==== Functions that operate on functions ====

In lambda calculus, functions are taken to be '[[First-class object|first class values]]', so functions may be used as the inputs, or be returned as outputs from other functions.

For example, &lt;math&gt;\lambda x.x&lt;/math&gt; represents the identity function, &lt;math&gt;x \mapsto x&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;(\lambda x.x)y&lt;/math&gt; represents the identity function applied to &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. Further, &lt;math&gt;(\lambda x.y)&lt;/math&gt; represents the '''constant function''' &lt;math&gt;x \mapsto y&lt;/math&gt;, the function that always returns &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, no matter the input. In lambda calculus, function application is regarded as [[Operator associativity|left-associative]], so that &lt;math&gt;stx&lt;/math&gt; means &lt;math&gt;(st)x&lt;/math&gt;.

There are several notions of "equivalence" and "reduction" that allow lambda terms to be "reduced" to "equivalent" lambda terms.

====Alpha equivalence====
A basic form of equivalence, definable on lambda terms, is alpha equivalence. It captures the intuition that the particular choice of a bound variable, in a lambda abstraction, does not (usually) matter.
For instance, &lt;math&gt;\lambda x.x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda y.y&lt;/math&gt; are alpha-equivalent lambda terms, and they both represent the same function (the identity function). 
The terms &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; are not alpha-equivalent, because they are not bound in a lambda abstraction.
In many presentations, it is usual to identify alpha-equivalent lambda terms.

The following definitions are necessary in order to be able to define beta reduction:

====Free variables====
The '''free variables''' of a term are those variables not bound by a lambda abstraction. The set of free variables of an expression is defined inductively:
* The free variables of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; are just &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;
* The set of free variables of &lt;math&gt;\lambda x.t&lt;/math&gt; is the set of free variables of &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, but with &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; removed
* The set of free variables of &lt;math&gt;ts&lt;/math&gt; is the union of the set of free variables of &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and the set of free variables of &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, the lambda term representing the identity &lt;math&gt;\lambda x.x&lt;/math&gt; has no free variables, but the function &lt;math&gt;\lambda x. yx&lt;/math&gt; has a single free variable, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.

====Capture-avoiding substitutions====

Suppose &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; are lambda terms and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; are variables.
The notation &lt;math&gt;t[x := r]&lt;/math&gt; indicates substitution of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; in a ''capture-avoiding'' manner. This is defined so that:
* &lt;math&gt;x[x := r] = r&lt;/math&gt;;
* &lt;math&gt;y[x := r] = y&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;x \neq y&lt;/math&gt;;
* &lt;math&gt;(ts)[x := r] = (t[x := r])(s[x := r])&lt;/math&gt;;
* &lt;math&gt;(\lambda x.t)[x := r] = \lambda x.t&lt;/math&gt;;
* &lt;math&gt;(\lambda y.t)[x := r] = \lambda y.(t[x := r])&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;x \neq y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is not in the free variables of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;. The variable &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is said to be "fresh" for &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, &lt;math&gt;(\lambda x.x)[y := y] = \lambda x.(x[y := y]) = \lambda x.x&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;((\lambda x.y)x)[x := y] = ((\lambda x.y)[x := y])(x[x := y]) = (\lambda x.y)y&lt;/math&gt;.

The freshness condition (requiring that &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is not in the free variables of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;) is crucial in order to ensure that substitution does not change the meaning of functions.
For example, a substitution is made that ignores the freshness condition: &lt;math&gt;(\lambda x.y)[y := x] = \lambda x.(y[y := x]) = \lambda x.x&lt;/math&gt;. This substitution turns the constant function &lt;math&gt;\lambda x.y&lt;/math&gt; into the identity &lt;math&gt;\lambda x.x&lt;/math&gt; by substitution.

In general, failure to meet the freshness condition can be remedied by alpha-renaming with a suitable fresh variable.
For example, switching back to our correct notion of substitution, in &lt;math&gt;(\lambda x.y)[y := x]&lt;/math&gt; the lambda abstraction can be renamed with a fresh variable &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;, to obtain &lt;math&gt;(\lambda z.y)[y := x] = \lambda z.(y[y := x]) = \lambda z.x&lt;/math&gt;, and the meaning of the function is preserved by substitution.

====Beta reduction====
The beta reduction rule states that an application of the form &lt;math&gt;( \lambda x . t) s&lt;/math&gt; reduces to the term &lt;math&gt; t [ x := s]&lt;/math&gt;. The notation &lt;math&gt;( \lambda x . t ) s \to t [ x := s ] &lt;/math&gt; is used to indicate that &lt;math&gt;( \lambda x .t ) s &lt;/math&gt; beta reduces to &lt;math&gt; t [ x := s ] &lt;/math&gt;.
For example, for every &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;( \lambda x . x ) s \to x[ x := s ] = s &lt;/math&gt;. This demonstrates that &lt;math&gt; \lambda x . x &lt;/math&gt; really is the identity.
Similarly, &lt;math&gt;( \lambda x . y ) s \to y [ x := s ] = y &lt;/math&gt;, which demonstrates that &lt;math&gt; \lambda x . y &lt;/math&gt; is a constant function.

The lambda calculus may be seen as an idealised version of a functional programming language, like [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] or [[Standard ML]].
Under this view, beta reduction corresponds to a computational step. This step can be repeated by additional beta conversions until there are no more applications left to reduce. In the untyped lambda calculus, as presented here, this reduction process may not terminate.
For instance, consider the term &lt;math&gt;\Omega = (\lambda x . xx)( \lambda x . xx )&lt;/math&gt;.
Here &lt;math&gt;( \lambda x . xx)( \lambda x . xx) \to ( xx )[ x := \lambda x . xx ] = ( x [ x := \lambda x . xx ] )( x [ x := \lambda x . xx ] ) = ( \lambda x . xx)( \lambda x . xx )&lt;/math&gt;.
That is, the term reduces to itself in a single beta reduction, and therefore the reduction process will never terminate.

Another aspect of the untyped lambda calculus is that it does not distinguish between different kinds of data.
For instance, it may be desirable to write a function that only operates on numbers. However, in the untyped lambda calculus, there is no way to prevent a function from being applied to [[truth value]]s, strings, or other non-number objects.

==Formal definition==
{{main|Lambda calculus definition}}

===Definition===
Lambda expressions are composed of:
* variables v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, v&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., v&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, ...
* the abstraction symbols lambda 'λ' and dot '.'
* parentheses ( )
The set of lambda expressions, Λ, can be [[Recursive definition|defined inductively]]:
#If x is a variable, then x ∈ Λ
#If x is a variable and M ∈ Λ, then (λx.M) ∈ Λ
#If M, N ∈ Λ, then (M N) ∈ Λ
Instances of rule 2 are known as abstractions and instances of rule 3 are known as applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===Notation===
To keep the notation of lambda expressions uncluttered, the following conventions are usually applied:
* Outermost parentheses are dropped: M N instead of (M N)
* Applications are assumed to be left associative: M N P may be written instead of ((M N) P)&lt;ref name="lambda-bound"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lambda-bound.com/book/lambdacalc/node27.html |title=Example for Rules of Associativity |publisher=Lambda-bound.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The body of an abstraction extends [[Regular expression#Lazy matching|as far right as possible]]: λx.M N means λx.(M N) and not (λx.M) N
* A sequence of abstractions is contracted: λx.λy.λz.N is abbreviated as λxyz.N&lt;ref name="Selinger"&gt;

===Free and bound variables===
The abstraction operator, λ, is said to bind its variable wherever it occurs in the body of the abstraction. Variables that fall within the scope of an abstraction are said to be ''bound''. All other variables are called ''free''. For example, in the expression &lt;tt&gt;λ''y''.''x'' ''x'' ''y''&lt;/tt&gt;, y is a bound variable and x is free. Also note that a variable is bound by its "nearest" abstraction. In the following example the single occurrence of x in the expression is bound by the second lambda: &lt;tt&gt;λ''x''.''y''  (λ''x''.''z'' ''x'')&lt;/tt&gt;

The set of ''free variables'' of a lambda expression, M, is denoted as FV(M) and is defined by recursion on the structure of the terms, as follows:
# FV(x) = {x}, where x is a variable
# FV(λx.M) = FV(M) \ {x}
# FV(M N) = FV(M) ∪ FV(N)&lt;ref name="BarendregtBarendsen"&gt;{{Citation

An expression that contains no free variables is said to be ''closed''. Closed lambda expressions are also known as combinators and are equivalent to terms in [[combinatory logic]].

==Reduction==
The meaning of lambda expressions is defined by how expressions can be reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Ruy de Queiroz |last=de Queiroz |first=Ruy J. G. B. |doi=10.1111/j.1746-8361.1988.tb00919.x |title=A Proof-Theoretic Account of Programming and the Role of Reduction Rules |journal=Dialectica |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=265–282 |year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three kinds of reduction:
* '''α-conversion''': changing bound variables ('''alpha''');
* '''β-reduction''': applying functions to their arguments ('''beta''');
* '''η-conversion''': which captures a notion of extensionality ('''eta''').
We also speak of the resulting equivalences: two expressions are ''β-equivalent'', if they can be β-converted into the same expression, and α/η-equivalence are defined similarly.

The term ''redex'', short for ''reducible expression'', refers to subterms that can be reduced by one of the reduction rules. For example, &lt;tt&gt;(λ''x''.M) N&lt;/tt&gt; is a beta-redex in expressing the substitution of N for x in M. The expression to which a redex reduces is called its reduct; the reduct of &lt;tt&gt;(λ''x''.M) N&lt;/tt&gt; is &lt;tt&gt;M[''x'':=N]&lt;/tt&gt;.

If &lt;tt&gt;''x''&lt;/tt&gt; is not free in &lt;tt&gt;M&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;λ''x''.M ''x''&lt;/tt&gt; is also an eta-redex, with a reduct of &lt;tt&gt;M&lt;/tt&gt;.

===α-conversion===
Alpha-conversion, sometimes known as alpha-renaming,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Design concepts in programming languages |last1=Turbak |first1=Franklyn |last2=Gifford |first2=David |year=2008 |publisher=MIT press |page=251| isbn=978-0-262-20175-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; allows bound variable names to be changed. For example, alpha-conversion of &lt;tt&gt;λ''x''.''x''&lt;/tt&gt; might yield &lt;tt&gt;λ''y''.''y''&lt;/tt&gt;. Terms that differ only by alpha-conversion are called ''α-equivalent''. Frequently, in uses of lambda calculus, α-equivalent terms are considered to be equivalent.

The precise rules for alpha-conversion are not completely trivial. First, when alpha-converting an abstraction, the only variable occurrences that are renamed are those that are bound to the same abstraction. For example, an alpha-conversion of &lt;tt&gt;λ''x''.λ''x''.''x''&lt;/tt&gt; could result in &lt;tt&gt;λ''y''.λ''x''.''x''&lt;/tt&gt;, but it could ''not'' result in &lt;tt&gt;λ''y''.λ''x''.''y''&lt;/tt&gt;. The latter has a different meaning from the original. This is analogous to the programming notion of [[variable shadowing]].

Second, alpha-conversion is not possible if it would result in a variable getting captured by a different abstraction. For example, if we replace &lt;tt&gt;''x''&lt;/tt&gt; with &lt;tt&gt;''y''&lt;/tt&gt; in &lt;tt&gt;λ''x''.λ''y''.''x''&lt;/tt&gt;, we get &lt;tt&gt;λ''y''.λ''y''.''y''&lt;/tt&gt;, which is not at all the same.

In programming languages with static scope, alpha-conversion can be used to make [[Name resolution (programming languages)|name resolution]] simpler by ensuring that no variable name [[Variable shadowing|masks]] a name in a containing [[scope (programming)|scope]] (see [[Name resolution (programming languages)#Alpha renaming to make name resolution trivial|alpha renaming to make name resolution trivial]]).

In the [[De Bruijn index]] notation, any two alpha-equivalent terms are syntactically identical.

====Substitution====
Substitution, written {{mono|1=''E''[''V'' := ''R'']}}, is the process of replacing all free occurrences of the variable {{mono|''V''}} in the expression {{mono|''E''}} with expression {{mono|''R''}}.
Substitution on terms of the λ-calculus is defined by recursion on the structure of terms, as follows (note: x and y are only variables while M and N are any λ expression).
 ''x''[''x'' := N]&amp;#09;&amp;equiv; N
 ''y''[''x'' := N]&amp;#09;&amp;equiv; ''y'', if ''x'' ≠ ''y''
 (M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)[''x'' := N]&amp;#09;&amp;equiv; (M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;[''x'' := N]) (M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[''x'' := N])
 (λ''x''.M)[''x'' := N]&amp;#09;&amp;equiv; λ''x''.M
 (λ''y''.M)[''x'' := N]&amp;#09;&amp;equiv; λ''y''.(M[''x'' := N]), if ''x'' ≠ ''y'', ''provided'' ''y'' ∉ FV(N)

To substitute into a lambda abstraction, it is sometimes necessary to α-convert the expression. For example, it is not correct for {{mono|1=(λ''x''.''y'')[''y'' := ''x'']}} to result in {{mono|(λ''x''.''x'')}}, because the substituted {{mono|''x''}} was supposed to be free but ended up being bound. The correct substitution in this case is {{mono|(λ''z''.''x'')}}, up to α-equivalence. Notice that substitution is defined uniquely up to α-equivalence.

===&amp;beta;-reduction===
Beta-reduction captures the idea of function application. Beta-reduction is defined in terms of substitution: the beta-reduction of &lt;tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;((λ''V''.''E'') ''E&amp;prime;'')&amp;nbsp;&lt;/tt&gt; is &lt;tt&gt;''E''[''V'' := ''E&amp;prime;'']&lt;/tt&gt;.

For example, assuming some encoding of &lt;tt&gt;2, 7, &amp;times;&lt;/tt&gt;, we have the following β-reduction: &lt;tt&gt;((λ''n''.''n''&amp;times;2) 7) &lt;/tt&gt;→&lt;tt&gt; 7&amp;times;2&lt;/tt&gt;.

===&amp;eta;-conversion===
Eta-conversion expresses the idea of [[extensionality]], which in this context is that two functions are the same [[if and only if]] they give the same result for all arguments. Eta-conversion converts between &lt;tt&gt;λ''x''.(''f'' ''x'')&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;''f''&lt;/tt&gt; whenever &lt;tt&gt;''x''&lt;/tt&gt; does not appear free in &lt;tt&gt;''f''&lt;/tt&gt;.

== Normal forms and confluence ==
{{Main|Normalization property (abstract rewriting)}}
For the untyped lambda calculus, β-reduction as a [[rewrite system|rewriting rule]] is neither [[strongly normalising]] nor [[weakly normalising]].

However, it can be shown that β-reduction is [[confluence (abstract rewriting)|confluent]]. (Of course, we are working up to α-conversion, i.e. we consider two normal forms to be equal, if it is possible to α-convert one into the other.)

Therefore, both strongly normalising terms and weakly normalising terms have a unique normal form. For strongly normalising terms, any reduction strategy is guaranteed to yield the normal form, whereas for weakly normalising terms, some reduction strategies may fail to find it.

==Encoding datatypes==
{{Main|Church encoding|Mogensen–Scott encoding}}

The basic lambda calculus may be used to model booleans, [[arithmetic]], data structures and recursion, as illustrated in the following sub-sections.

===Arithmetic in lambda calculus===
There are several possible ways to define the [[natural number]]s in lambda calculus, but by far the most common are the [[Church numeral]]s, which can be defined as follows:
: &lt;tt&gt;0 := λ''f''.λ''x''.''x''&lt;/tt&gt;
: &lt;tt&gt;1 := λ''f''.λ''x''.''f'' ''x''&lt;/tt&gt;
: &lt;tt&gt;2 := λ''f''.λ''x''.''f'' (''f'' ''x'')&lt;/tt&gt;
: &lt;tt&gt;3 := λ''f''.λ''x''.''f'' (''f'' (''f'' ''x''))&lt;/tt&gt;
and so on. Or using the alternative syntax presented above in ''[[#Notation|Notation]]'':

: &lt;tt&gt;0 := λ''fx''.''x''&lt;/tt&gt;
: &lt;tt&gt;1 := λ''fx''.''f'' ''x''&lt;/tt&gt;
: &lt;tt&gt;2 := λ''fx''.''f'' (''f'' ''x'')&lt;/tt&gt;
: &lt;tt&gt;3 := λ''fx''.''f'' (''f'' (''f'' ''x''))&lt;/tt&gt;

A Church numeral is a [[higher-order function]]—it takes a single-argument function &lt;tt&gt;''f''&lt;/tt&gt;, and returns another single-argument function. The Church numeral &lt;tt&gt;''n''&lt;/tt&gt; is a function that takes a function &lt;tt&gt;''f''&lt;/tt&gt; as argument and returns the &lt;tt&gt;''n''&lt;/tt&gt;-th composition of &lt;tt&gt;''f''&lt;/tt&gt;, i.e. the function &lt;tt&gt;''f''&lt;/tt&gt; composed with itself &lt;tt&gt;''n''&lt;/tt&gt; times. This is denoted &lt;tt&gt;''f''&lt;sup&gt;(''n'')&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; and is in fact the &lt;tt&gt;''n''&lt;/tt&gt;-th power of &lt;tt&gt;''f''&lt;/tt&gt; (considered as an operator); &lt;tt&gt;''f''&lt;sup&gt;(0)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; is defined to be the identity function. Such repeated compositions (of a single function &lt;tt&gt;''f''&lt;/tt&gt;) obey the [[laws of exponents]], which is why these numerals can be used for arithmetic. (In Church's original lambda calculus, the formal parameter of a lambda expression was required to occur at least once in the function body, which made the above definition of &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; impossible.)

One way of thinking about the Church numeral &lt;tt&gt;''n''&lt;/tt&gt;, which is often useful when analysing programs, is as an instruction 'repeat ''n'' times'. For example, using the &lt;tt&gt;PAIR&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;NIL&lt;/tt&gt; functions defined below, one can define a function that constructs a (linked) list of ''n'' elements all equal to ''x'' by repeating 'prepend another ''x'' element' ''n'' times, starting from an empty list. The lambda term is
: &lt;tt&gt;λ''n''.λ''x''.''n'' (PAIR ''x'') NIL&lt;/tt&gt;
By varying what is being repeated, and varying what argument that function being repeated is applied to, a great many different effects can be achieved.

We can define a successor function, which takes a Church numeral &lt;tt&gt;''n''&lt;/tt&gt; and returns &lt;tt&gt;''n'' + 1&lt;/tt&gt; by adding another application of &lt;tt&gt;''f''&lt;/tt&gt;, where '(mf)x' means the function 'f' is applied 'm' times on 'x':
: &lt;tt&gt;SUCC := λ''n''.λ''f''.λ''x''.''f'' (''n'' ''f'' ''x'')&lt;/tt&gt;
Because the &lt;tt&gt;''m''&lt;/tt&gt;-th composition of &lt;tt&gt;''f''&lt;/tt&gt; composed with the &lt;tt&gt;''n''&lt;/tt&gt;-th composition of &lt;tt&gt;''f''&lt;/tt&gt; gives the &lt;tt&gt;''m''+''n''&lt;/tt&gt;-th composition of &lt;tt&gt;''f''&lt;/tt&gt;, addition can be defined as follows:
: &lt;tt&gt;PLUS := λ''m''.λ''n''.λ''f''.λ''x''.''m'' ''f'' (''n'' ''f'' ''x'')&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;PLUS&lt;/tt&gt; can be thought of as a function taking two natural numbers as arguments and returning a natural number; it can be verified that
: &lt;tt&gt;PLUS 2 3&lt;/tt&gt;
and
: &lt;tt&gt;5&lt;/tt&gt;
are β-equivalent lambda expressions. Since adding &lt;tt&gt;''m''&lt;/tt&gt; to a number &lt;tt&gt;''n''&lt;/tt&gt; can be accomplished by adding 1 &lt;tt&gt;''m''&lt;/tt&gt; times, an alternative definition is:
: &lt;tt&gt;PLUS := λ''m''.λ''n''.''m'' SUCC ''n&amp;thinsp;''&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Similarly, multiplication can be defined as
: &lt;tt&gt;MULT := λ''m''.λ''n''.λ''f''.''m'' (''n'' ''f'')&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;ref name="Selinger" /&gt;
Alternatively
: &lt;tt&gt;MULT := λ''m''.λ''n''.''m'' (PLUS ''n'') 0&lt;/tt&gt;
since multiplying &lt;tt&gt;''m''&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;''n''&lt;/tt&gt; is the same as repeating the add &lt;tt&gt;''n''&lt;/tt&gt; function &lt;tt&gt;''m''&lt;/tt&gt; times and then applying it to zero.
Exponentiation has a rather simple rendering in Church numerals, namely
: &lt;tt&gt;POW := λ''b''.λ''e''.''e'' ''b''&lt;/tt&gt;{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}
The predecessor function defined by &lt;tt&gt;PRED ''n'' = ''n'' − 1&lt;/tt&gt; for a positive integer &lt;tt&gt;''n''&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;PRED 0 = 0&lt;/tt&gt; is considerably more difficult. The formula
: &lt;tt&gt;PRED := λ''n''.λ''f''.λ''x''.''n'' (λ''g''.λ''h''.''h'' (''g'' ''f'')) (λ''u''.''x'') (λ''u''.''u'')&lt;/tt&gt;
can be validated by showing inductively that if ''T'' denotes &lt;tt&gt;(λ''g''.λ''h''.''h'' (''g'' ''f''))&lt;/tt&gt;, then &lt;tt&gt;T&lt;sup&gt;(''n'')&lt;/sup&gt;(λ''u''.''x'') = (λ''h''.''h''(''f''&lt;sup&gt;(''n''−1)&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')))&lt;/tt&gt; for &lt;tt&gt;''n'' &gt; 0&lt;/tt&gt;. Two other definitions of &lt;tt&gt;PRED&lt;/tt&gt; are given below, one using [[#Logic and predicates|conditionals]] and the other using [[#Pairs|pairs]]. With the predecessor function, subtraction is straightforward. Defining
: &lt;tt&gt;SUB := λ''m''.λ''n''.''n'' PRED ''m''&lt;/tt&gt;,
&lt;tt&gt;SUB ''m'' ''n''&lt;/tt&gt; yields &lt;tt&gt;''m'' − ''n''&lt;/tt&gt; when &lt;tt&gt;''m'' &gt; ''n''&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; otherwise.

===Logic and predicates===
By convention, the following two definitions (known as Church booleans) are used for the boolean values &lt;tt&gt;TRUE&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;FALSE&lt;/tt&gt;:
: &lt;tt&gt;TRUE := λ''x''.λ''y''.''x''&lt;/tt&gt;
: &lt;tt&gt;FALSE := λ''x''.λ''y''.''y''&lt;/tt&gt;
::(Note that &lt;tt&gt;FALSE&lt;/tt&gt; is equivalent to the Church numeral zero defined above)
Then, with these two λ-terms, we can define some logic operators (these are just possible formulations; other expressions are equally correct):
: &lt;tt&gt;AND := λ''p''.λ''q''.''p'' ''q'' ''p''&lt;/tt&gt;
: &lt;tt&gt;OR := λ''p''.λ''q''.''p'' ''p'' ''q''&lt;/tt&gt;
: &lt;tt&gt;NOT := λ''p''.p FALSE TRUE&lt;/tt&gt;
: &lt;tt&gt;IFTHENELSE := λ''p''.λ''a''.λ''b''.''p'' ''a'' ''b''&lt;/tt&gt;
We are now able to compute some logic functions, for example:

: &lt;tt&gt;AND TRUE FALSE&lt;/tt&gt;
::&lt;tt&gt;≡ (λ''p''.λ''q''.''p'' ''q'' ''p'') TRUE FALSE →&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt; TRUE FALSE TRUE&lt;/tt&gt;
::&lt;tt&gt;≡ (λ''x''.λ''y''.''x'') FALSE TRUE →&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt;  FALSE&lt;/tt&gt;
and we see that &lt;tt&gt;AND TRUE FALSE&lt;/tt&gt; is equivalent to &lt;tt&gt;FALSE&lt;/tt&gt;.

A ''predicate'' is a function that returns a boolean value. The most fundamental predicate is &lt;tt&gt;ISZERO&lt;/tt&gt;, which returns &lt;tt&gt;TRUE&lt;/tt&gt; if its argument is the Church numeral &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;FALSE&lt;/tt&gt; if its argument is any other Church numeral:
: &lt;tt&gt;ISZERO := λ''n''.''n'' (λ''x''.FALSE) TRUE&lt;/tt&gt;
The following predicate tests whether the first argument is less-than-or-equal-to the second:
: &lt;tt&gt;LEQ := λ''m''.λ''n''.ISZERO (SUB ''m'' ''n'')&lt;/tt&gt;,
and since &lt;tt&gt;''m'' = ''n''&lt;/tt&gt;, if &lt;tt&gt;LEQ ''m'' ''n''&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;LEQ ''n'' ''m''&lt;/tt&gt;, it is straightforward to build a predicate for numerical equality.

The availability of predicates and the above definition of &lt;tt&gt;TRUE&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;FALSE&lt;/tt&gt; make it convenient to write "if-then-else" expressions in lambda calculus. For example, the predecessor function can be defined as:
: &lt;tt&gt;PRED := λ''n''.''n'' (λ''g''.λ''k''.ISZERO (''g'' 1) ''k'' (PLUS (''g'' ''k'') 1)) (λ''v''.0) 0 &lt;/tt&gt;
which can be verified by showing inductively that &lt;tt&gt;''n'' (λ''g''.λ''k''.ISZERO (''g'' 1) ''k'' (PLUS (''g'' ''k'') 1)) (λ''v''.0)&lt;/tt&gt; is the add &lt;tt&gt;''n''&lt;/tt&gt; − 1 function for &lt;tt&gt;''n''&lt;/tt&gt; &gt; 0.

A pair (2-tuple) can be defined in terms of &lt;tt&gt;TRUE&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;FALSE&lt;/tt&gt;, by using the [[Church encoding#Church pairs|Church encoding for pairs]]. For example, &lt;tt&gt;PAIR&lt;/tt&gt; encapsulates the pair (&lt;tt&gt;''x''&lt;/tt&gt;,&lt;tt&gt;''y''&lt;/tt&gt;), &lt;tt&gt;FIRST&lt;/tt&gt; returns the first element of the pair, and &lt;tt&gt;SECOND&lt;/tt&gt; returns the second.

: &lt;tt&gt;PAIR := λ''x''.λ''y''.λ''f''.''f'' ''x'' ''y''&lt;/tt&gt;
: &lt;tt&gt;FIRST := λ''p''.''p'' TRUE&lt;/tt&gt;
: &lt;tt&gt;SECOND := λ''p''.''p'' FALSE&lt;/tt&gt;
: &lt;tt&gt;NIL := λ''x''.TRUE &lt;/tt&gt;
: &lt;tt&gt;NULL := λ''p''.''p'' (λ''x''.λ''y''.FALSE)&lt;/tt&gt;

A linked list can be defined as either NIL for the empty list, or the &lt;tt&gt;PAIR&lt;/tt&gt; of an element and a smaller list. The predicate &lt;tt&gt;NULL&lt;/tt&gt; tests for the value &lt;tt&gt;NIL&lt;/tt&gt;. (Alternatively, with &lt;tt&gt;NIL := FALSE&lt;/tt&gt;, the construct &lt;tt&gt;''l'' (λ''h''.λ''t''.λ''z''.deal_with_head_''h''_and_tail_''t'') (deal_with_nil)&lt;/tt&gt; obviates the need for an explicit NULL test).

As an example of the use of pairs, the shift-and-increment function that maps &lt;tt&gt;(''m'', ''n'')&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;(''n'', ''n'' + 1)&lt;/tt&gt; can be defined as
: &lt;tt&gt;Φ := λ''x''.PAIR (SECOND ''x'') (SUCC (SECOND ''x''))&lt;/tt&gt;
which allows us to give perhaps the most transparent version of the predecessor function:
: &lt;tt&gt;PRED := λ''n''.FIRST (''n'' Φ (PAIR 0 0)).&lt;/tt&gt;

==Additional programming techniques==
There is a considerable body of [[programming idiom]]s for lambda calculus. Many of these were originally developed in the context of using lambda calculus as a foundation for programming language semantics, effectively using lambda calculus as a [[low-level programming language]]. Because several programming languages include the lambda calculus (or something very similar) as a fragment, these techniques also see use in practical programming, but may then be perceived as obscure or foreign.

===Named constants===
In lambda calculus, a [[library (computing)|library]] would take the form of a collection of previously defined functions, which as lambda-terms are merely particular constants. The pure lambda calculus does not have a concept of named constants since all atomic lambda-terms are variables, but one can emulate having named constants by setting aside a variable as the name of the constant, using lambda-abstraction to bind that variable in the main body, and apply that lambda-abstraction to the intended definition. Thus to use &lt;tt&gt;''f''&lt;/tt&gt; to mean ''M'' (some explicit lambda-term) in ''N'' (another lambda-term, the "main program"), one can say
: &lt;tt&gt;(λ''f''.&lt;/tt&gt;''N''&lt;tt&gt;)&lt;/tt&gt; ''M''
Authors often introduce [[syntactic sugar]], such as &lt;tt&gt;let&lt;/tt&gt;, to permit writing the above in the more intuitive order
: &lt;tt&gt;let ''f'' = &lt;/tt&gt;''M''&lt;tt&gt; in &lt;/tt&gt;''N''
By chaining such definitions, one can write a lambda calculus "program" as zero or more function definitions, followed by one lambda-term using those functions that constitutes the main body of the program.

A notable restriction of this &lt;tt&gt;let&lt;/tt&gt; is that the name &lt;tt&gt;''f''&lt;/tt&gt; is not defined in ''M'', since ''M'' is outside the scope of the lambda-abstraction binding &lt;tt&gt;''f''&lt;/tt&gt;; this means a recursive function definition cannot be used as the ''M'' with &lt;tt&gt;let&lt;/tt&gt;. The more advanced &lt;tt&gt;letrec&lt;/tt&gt; syntactic sugar construction that allows writing recursive function definitions in that naive style instead additionally employs fixed-point combinators.

===Recursion and fixed points===
{{Main|Fixed-point combinator}}
{{see also|SKI combinator calculus#Self-application and recursion}}
[[Recursion]] is the definition of a function using the function itself. Lambda calculus cannot express this as directly as some other notations: all functions are anonymous in lambda calculus, so we can't refer to a value which is yet to be defined, inside the lambda term defining that same value. However, recursion can still be achieved by arranging for a lambda expression to receive itself as its argument value, for example in&amp;ensp; &lt;tt&gt;(λ''x''.''x'' ''x'') ''E''&lt;/tt&gt;.

Consider the [[factorial]] function &lt;tt&gt;F(''n'')&lt;/tt&gt; recursively defined by

:&lt;tt&gt;F(''n'') = 1, if ''n'' = 0; else ''n'' &amp;times; F(''n'' − 1)&lt;/tt&gt;.

In the lambda expression which is to represent this function, a ''parameter'' (typically the first one) will be assumed to receive the lambda expression itself as its value, so that calling it &amp;ndash; applying it to an argument &amp;ndash; will amount to recursion. Thus to achieve recursion, the intended-as-self-referencing argument (called &lt;tt&gt;''r''&lt;/tt&gt; here) must always be passed to itself within the function body, at a call point:

:&lt;tt&gt;G := λ''r''. λ''n''.(1, if ''n'' = 0; else ''n'' &amp;times; (''r'' ''r'' (''n''−1)))&lt;/tt&gt;
::: with&amp;ensp; &lt;tt&gt; ''r'' ''r'' ''x'' = F ''x'' = G ''r'' ''x''&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;ensp;to hold, so&amp;ensp; &lt;tt&gt;''r'' = G&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;ensp;and
:&lt;tt&gt;F := G G = (λ''x''.''x'' ''x'') G&lt;/tt&gt;

The self-application achieves replication here, passing the function's lambda expression on to the next invocation as an argument value, making it available to be referenced and called there.

This solves it but requires re-writing each recursive call as self-application. We would like to have a generic solution, without a need for any re-writes:

:&lt;tt&gt;G := λ''r''. λ''n''.(1, if ''n'' = 0; else ''n'' &amp;times; (''r'' (''n''−1)))&lt;/tt&gt;
::: with&amp;ensp; &lt;tt&gt; ''r'' ''x'' = F ''x'' = G ''r'' ''x''&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;ensp;to hold, so&amp;ensp; &lt;tt&gt;''r'' = G ''r'' =: FIX G&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;ensp;and
:&lt;tt&gt;F := FIX G&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;ensp;where&amp;ensp; &lt;tt&gt;FIX ''g'' := (''r'' where ''r'' = ''g'' ''r'') = ''g'' (FIX ''g'')&lt;/tt&gt;
::: so that&amp;ensp; &lt;tt&gt; FIX G = G (FIX G) = (λ''n''.(1, if ''n'' = 0; else ''n'' &amp;times; ((FIX G) (''n''−1)))) &lt;/tt&gt;

Given a lambda term with first argument representing recursive call (e.g. &lt;tt&gt;G&lt;/tt&gt; here), the ''fixed-point'' combinator &lt;tt&gt;FIX&lt;/tt&gt; will return a self-replicating lambda expression representing the recursive function (here, &lt;tt&gt;F&lt;/tt&gt;). The function does not need to be explicitly passed to itself at any point, for the self-replication is arranged in advance, when it is created, to be done each time it is called. Thus the original lambda expression &lt;tt&gt;(FIX G)&lt;/tt&gt; is re-created inside itself, at call-point, achieving [[self-reference]].

In fact, there are many possible definitions for this &lt;tt&gt;FIX&lt;/tt&gt; operator, the simplest of them being:

:&lt;tt&gt;'''Y''' := λ''g''.(λ''x''.''g'' (''x'' ''x'')) (λ''x''.''g'' (''x'' ''x''))&lt;/tt&gt;

In the lambda calculus, &lt;tt&gt;'''Y''' ''g''&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;thinsp; is a fixed-point of &lt;tt&gt;''g''&lt;/tt&gt;, as it expands to:

:&lt;tt&gt;'''Y''' ''g''&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;(λ''h''.(λ''x''.''h'' (''x'' ''x'')) (λ''x''.''h'' (''x'' ''x''))) ''g''&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;(λ''x''.''g'' (''x'' ''x'')) (λ''x''.''g'' (''x'' ''x''))&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;''g'' ((λ''x''.''g'' (''x'' ''x'')) (λ''x''.''g'' (''x'' ''x'')))&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;''g'' ('''Y''' ''g'')&lt;/tt&gt;

Now, to perform our recursive call to the factorial function, we would simply call &lt;tt&gt;('''Y''' G) ''n''&lt;/tt&gt;,&amp;nbsp; where ''n'' is the number we are calculating the factorial of. Given ''n'' = 4, for example, this gives:

:&lt;tt&gt;('''Y''' G) 4 &lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;G ('''Y''' G) 4 &lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;(λ''r''.λ''n''.(1, if ''n'' = 0; else ''n'' × (''r'' (''n''−1)))) ('''Y''' G) 4&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;(λ''n''.(1, if ''n'' = 0; else ''n'' × (('''Y''' G) (''n''−1)))) 4&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;1, if 4 = 0; else 4 × (('''Y''' G) (4−1))&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;4 × (G ('''Y''' G) (4−1))&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;4 × ((λ''n''.(1, if ''n'' = 0; else ''n'' × (('''Y''' G) (''n''−1)))) (4−1))&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;4 × (1, if 3 = 0; else 3 × (('''Y''' G) (3−1)))&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;4 × (3 × (G ('''Y''' G) (3−1)))&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;4 × (3 × ((λ''n''.(1, if ''n'' = 0; else ''n'' × (('''Y''' G) (''n''−1)))) (3−1)))&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;4 × (3 × (1, if 2 = 0; else 2 × (('''Y''' G) (2−1))))&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;4 × (3 × (2 × (G ('''Y''' G) (2−1))))&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;4 × (3 × (2 × ((λ''n''.(1, if ''n'' = 0; else ''n'' × (('''Y''' G) (''n''−1)))) (2−1))))&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;4 × (3 × (2 × (1, if 1 = 0; else 1 × (('''Y''' G) (1−1)))))&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;4 × (3 × (2 × (1 × (G ('''Y''' G) (1−1)))))&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;4 × (3 × (2 × (1 × ((λ''n''.(1, if ''n'' = 0; else ''n'' × (('''Y''' G) (''n''−1)))) (1−1)))))&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;4 × (3 × (2 × (1 × (1, if 0 = 0; else 0 × (('''Y''' G) (0−1))))))&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;4 × (3 × (2 × (1 × (1))))&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;24&lt;/tt&gt;

Every recursively defined function can be seen as a fixed point of some suitably defined function closing over the recursive call with an extra argument, and therefore, using &lt;tt&gt;'''Y'''&lt;/tt&gt;, every recursively defined function can be expressed as a lambda expression. In particular, we can now cleanly define the subtraction, multiplication and comparison predicate of natural numbers recursively.

===Standard terms===
Certain terms have commonly accepted names:
: {{anchor|I}} &lt;tt&gt;'''I''' := λ''x''.''x''&lt;/tt&gt;
: {{anchor|K}} &lt;tt&gt;'''K''' := λ''x''.λ''y''.''x''&lt;/tt&gt;
: {{anchor|S}} &lt;tt&gt;'''S''' := λ''x''.λ''y''.λ''z''.''x'' ''z'' (''y'' ''z'') &lt;/tt&gt;
: {{anchor|B}} &lt;tt&gt;'''B''' := λ''x''.λ''y''.λ''z''.''x'' (''y'' ''z'') &lt;/tt&gt;
: {{anchor|C}} &lt;tt&gt;'''C''' := λ''x''.λ''y''.λ''z''.''x'' ''z'' ''y''&lt;/tt&gt;
: {{anchor|W}} &lt;tt&gt;'''W''' := λ''x''.λ''y''.''x'' ''y'' ''y''&lt;/tt&gt;
: {{anchor|U}} &lt;tt&gt;'''U''' := λ''x''.λ''y''.''y'' (''x'' ''x'' ''y'')  &lt;/tt&gt;
: {{anchor|omega}} &lt;tt&gt;'''ω''' := λ''x''.''x'' ''x'' &lt;/tt&gt;
: {{anchor|Omega}} &lt;tt&gt;'''Ω''' := '''ω''' '''ω''' &lt;/tt&gt;
: {{anchor|Y}} &lt;tt&gt;'''Y''' := λ''g''.(λ''x''.''g'' (''x'' ''x'')) (λ''x''.''g'' (''x'' ''x''))&lt;/tt&gt;
Several of these have direct applications in the ''elimination of lambda-abstraction'' that turns lambda terms into [[combinator calculus]] terms.

===Abstraction elimination===
{{main|Combinatory_logic#Completeness_of_the_S-K_basis}}
If ''N'' is a lambda-term without lambda-abstraction, but possibly containing named constants ([[combinatory logic|combinators]]), then there exists a lambda-term ''T''(&lt;tt&gt;''x''&lt;/tt&gt;,''N'') which is equivalent to &lt;tt&gt;λ''x''.&lt;/tt&gt;''N'' but lacks lambda-abstraction (except as part of the named constants, if these are considered non-atomic). This can also be viewed as anonymising variables, as ''T''(&lt;tt&gt;''x''&lt;/tt&gt;,''N'') removes all occurrences of &lt;tt&gt;''x''&lt;/tt&gt; from ''N'', while still allowing argument values to be substituted into the positions where ''N'' contains an &lt;tt&gt;''x''&lt;/tt&gt;. The conversion function ''T'' can be defined by:
: ''T''(&lt;tt&gt;''x''&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;''x''&lt;/tt&gt;) := '''I'''
: ''T''(&lt;tt&gt;''x''&lt;/tt&gt;, ''N'') := '''K''' ''N'' if &lt;tt&gt;''x''&lt;/tt&gt; is not free in ''N''.
: ''T''(&lt;tt&gt;''x''&lt;/tt&gt;, ''M'' ''N'') := '''S''' ''T''(&lt;tt&gt;''x''&lt;/tt&gt;, ''M'') ''T''(&lt;tt&gt;''x''&lt;/tt&gt;, ''N'')
In either case, a term of the form ''T''(&lt;tt&gt;''x''&lt;/tt&gt;,''N'') ''P'' can reduce by having the initial combinator '''I''', '''K''', or '''S''' grab the argument ''P'', just like β-reduction of &lt;tt&gt;(λ''x''.&lt;/tt&gt;''N''&lt;tt&gt;)&lt;/tt&gt; ''P'' would do. '''I''' returns that argument. '''K''' throws the argument away, just like &lt;tt&gt;(λ''x''.&lt;/tt&gt;''N''&lt;tt&gt;)&lt;/tt&gt; would do if &lt;tt&gt;''x''&lt;/tt&gt; has no free occurrence in ''N''. '''S''' passes the argument on to both subterms of the application, and then applies the result of the first to the result of the second.

The combinators '''B''' and '''C''' are similar to '''S''', but pass the argument on to only one subterm of an application ('''B''' to the "argument" subterm and '''C''' to the "function" subterm), thus saving a subsequent '''K''' if there is no occurrence of &lt;tt&gt;''x''&lt;/tt&gt; in one subterm. In comparison to '''B''' and '''C''', the '''S''' combinator actually conflates two functionalities: rearranging arguments, and duplicating an argument so that it may be used in two places. The '''W''' combinator does only the latter, yielding the [[B, C, K, W system]] as an alternative to [[SKI combinator calculus]].

== Typed lambda calculus ==
{{main|Typed lambda calculus}}
{{Summarize|from|typed lambda calculus|date=August 2009}}&lt;!-- this was requested by multiple editor on talk --&gt;
A '''typed lambda calculus''' is a typed [[formalism (mathematics)|formalism]] that uses the lambda-symbol (&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;) to denote anonymous function abstraction. In this context, types are usually objects of a syntactic nature that are assigned to lambda terms; the exact nature of a type depends on the calculus considered (see kinds below). From a certain point of view, typed lambda calculi can be seen as refinements of the [[untyped lambda calculus]] but from another point of view, they can also be considered the more fundamental theory and  ''untyped lambda calculus'' a special case with only one type.&lt;ref&gt;Types and Programming Languages, p. 273, Benjamin C. Pierce&lt;/ref&gt;

Typed lambda calculi are foundational [[programming languages]] and are the base of typed [[functional programming languages]] such as [[ML programming language|ML]] and [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] and, more indirectly, typed [[imperative programming|imperative programming languages]]. Typed lambda calculi play an important role in the design of [[type systems]] for programming languages; here typability usually captures desirable properties of the program, e.g. the program will not cause a memory access violation.

Typed lambda calculi are closely related to [[mathematical logic]] and [[proof theory]] via the [[Curry–Howard isomorphism]] and they can be considered as the [[internal language]] of classes of [[category theory|categories]], e.g. the simply typed lambda calculus is the language of [[cartesian closed category|Cartesian closed categories]] (CCCs).

==Computable functions and lambda calculus==
A function ''F'': '''N''' → '''N''' of natural numbers is a computable function if and only if there exists a lambda expression ''f'' such that for every pair of ''x'', ''y'' in '''N''', ''F''(''x'')=''y'' if and only if ''f'' &lt;tt&gt;''x''&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;tt&gt;''y''&lt;/tt&gt;,&amp;nbsp; where &lt;tt&gt;''x''&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;''y''&lt;/tt&gt; are the Church numerals corresponding to ''x'' and ''y'', respectively and =&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt; meaning equivalence with beta reduction. This is one of the many ways to define computability; see the [[Church–Turing thesis]] for a discussion of other approaches and their equivalence.

==Undecidability of equivalence==
There is no algorithm that takes as input two lambda expressions and outputs &lt;tt&gt;TRUE&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;FALSE&lt;/tt&gt; depending on whether or not the two expressions are equivalent. This was historically the first problem for which undecidability could be proven. As is common for a proof of undecidability, the proof shows that no computable function can decide the equivalence. [[Church's thesis]] is then invoked to show that no algorithm can do so.

Church's proof first reduces the problem to determining whether a given lambda expression has a ''normal form''. A normal form is an equivalent expression that cannot be reduced any further under the rules imposed by the form. Then he assumes that this predicate is computable, and can hence be expressed in lambda calculus. Building on earlier work by Kleene and constructing a [[Gödel numbering]] for lambda expressions, he constructs a lambda expression &lt;tt&gt;''e''&lt;/tt&gt; that closely follows the proof of [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|Gödel's first incompleteness theorem]]. If &lt;tt&gt;''e''&lt;/tt&gt; is applied to its own Gödel number, a contradiction results.

==Lambda calculus and programming languages==
As pointed out by [[Peter Landin]]'s 1965 paper "A Correspondence between ALGOL 60 and Church's Lambda-notation"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=363749&amp;coll=portal&amp;dl=ACM |title=A Correspondence between ALGOL 60 and Church's Lambda-notation |first=P. J. |last=Landin |authorlink=Peter Landin |journal=Communications of the ACM |volume=8 |issue=2 |year=1965 |pages=89–101 |doi=10.1145/363744.363749}}&lt;/ref&gt;, sequential [[procedural programming|procedural programming languages]] can be understood in terms of the lambda calculus, which provides the basic mechanisms for procedural abstraction and procedure (subprogram) application.

===Anonymous functions===
{{main|Anonymous function}}
For example, in [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] the "square" function can be expressed as a lambda expression as follows:
&lt;!-- Please do not add the same example in different languages to this article, see Anonymous function for that. Thank you! --&gt;
&lt;source lang="Lisp"&gt;
(lambda (x) (* x x))
&lt;/source&gt;

The above example is an expression that evaluates to a first-class function. The symbol &lt;code&gt;lambda&lt;/code&gt; creates an anonymous function, given a list of parameter names, &lt;code&gt;(x)&lt;/code&gt; – just a single argument in this case, and an expression that is evaluated as the body of the function, &lt;code&gt;(* x x)&lt;/code&gt;. Anonymous functions are sometimes called lambda expressions.

For example, [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] and many other imperative languages have long supported passing [[subprograms]] as [[arguments]] to other subprograms through the mechanism of [[function pointers]]. However, function pointers are not a sufficient condition for functions to be [[First-class function|first class]] datatypes, because a function is a first class datatype if and only if new instances of the function can be created at run-time. And this run-time creation of functions is supported in [[Smalltalk]], [[JavaScript]], and more recently in [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]], [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]] ("agents"), [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] ("delegates") and [[C++11]], among others.

===Reduction strategies===
{{details|Evaluation strategy}}
Whether a term is normalising or not, and how much work needs to be done in normalising it if it is, depends to a large extent on the reduction strategy used. The distinction between reduction strategies relates to the distinction in functional programming languages between [[eager evaluation]] and [[lazy evaluation]].

;Full beta reductions: Any redex can be reduced at any time. This means essentially the lack of any particular reduction strategy—with regard to reducibility, "all bets are off".
;Applicative order: The rightmost, innermost redex is always reduced first. Intuitively this means a function's arguments are always reduced before the function itself. Applicative order always attempts to apply functions to normal forms, even when this is not possible.
:Most programming languages (including Lisp, ML and imperative languages like C and [[Java programming language|Java]]) are described as "strict", meaning that functions applied to non-normalising arguments are non-normalising. This is done essentially using applicative order, call by value reduction ([[#Call by value|see below]]), but usually called "eager evaluation".
;Normal order: The leftmost, outermost redex is always reduced first. That is, whenever possible the arguments are substituted into the body of an abstraction before the arguments are reduced.
;Call by name: As normal order, but no reductions are performed inside abstractions. For example, &lt;tt&gt;λ''x''.(λ''x''.''x'')''x''&lt;/tt&gt; is in normal form according to this strategy, although it contains the redex &lt;tt&gt;(λ''x''.''x'')''x''&lt;/tt&gt;.
;Call by value: Only the outermost redexes are reduced: a redex is reduced only when its right hand side has reduced to a value (variable or lambda abstraction).
;Call by need: As normal order, but function applications that would duplicate terms instead name the argument, which is then reduced only "when it is needed". Called in practical contexts "lazy evaluation". In implementations this "name" takes the form of a pointer, with the redex represented by a [[thunk (functional programming)|thunk]].

Applicative order is not a normalising strategy. The usual counterexample is as follows: define &lt;tt&gt;'''Ω''' = ωω&lt;/tt&gt; where &lt;tt&gt;'''ω''' = λ''x''.''xx''&lt;/tt&gt;. This entire expression contains only one redex, namely the whole expression; its reduct is again &lt;tt&gt;'''Ω'''&lt;/tt&gt;. Since this is the only available reduction, &lt;tt&gt;'''Ω'''&lt;/tt&gt; has no normal form (under any evaluation strategy). Using applicative order, the expression &lt;tt&gt;'''KIΩ''' = (λ''x''.λ''y''.''x'') (λ''x''.''x'')'''Ω'''&lt;/tt&gt; is reduced by first reducing &lt;tt&gt;'''Ω'''&lt;/tt&gt; to normal form (since it is the rightmost redex), but since &lt;tt&gt;'''Ω'''&lt;/tt&gt; has no normal form, applicative order fails to find a normal form for &lt;tt&gt;'''KIΩ'''&lt;/tt&gt;.

In contrast, normal order is so called because it always finds a normalising reduction, if one exists. In the above example, &lt;tt&gt;'''KIΩ'''&lt;/tt&gt; reduces under normal order to ''I'', a normal form. A drawback is that redexes in the arguments may be copied, resulting in duplicated computation (for example, &lt;tt&gt;(λ''x''.''xx'') ((λ''x''.''x'')''y'')&lt;/tt&gt; reduces to &lt;tt&gt;((λ''x''.''x'')''y'') ((λ''x''.''x'')''y'')&lt;/tt&gt; using this strategy; now there are two redexes, so full evaluation needs two more steps, but if the argument had been reduced first, there would now be none).

The positive tradeoff of using applicative order is that it does not cause unnecessary computation, if all arguments are used, because it never substitutes arguments containing redexes and hence never needs to copy them (which would duplicate work). In the above example, in applicative order &lt;tt&gt;(λ''x''.''xx'') ((λ''x''.''x'')''y'')&lt;/tt&gt; reduces first to &lt;tt&gt;(λ''x''.''xx'')''y''&lt;/tt&gt; and then to the normal order &lt;tt&gt;''yy''&lt;/tt&gt;, taking two steps instead of three.

Most ''purely'' functional programming languages (notably [[Miranda (programming language)|Miranda]] and its descendents, including Haskell), and the proof languages of [[Automated theorem prover|theorem provers]], use ''lazy evaluation'', which is essentially the same as call by need. This is like normal order reduction, but call by need manages to avoid the duplication of work inherent in normal order reduction using ''sharing''. In the example given above, &lt;tt&gt;(λ''x''.''xx'') ((λ''x''.''x'')''y'')&lt;/tt&gt; reduces to &lt;tt&gt;((λ''x''.''x'')''y'') ((λ''x''.''x'')''y'')&lt;/tt&gt;, which has two redexes, but in call by need they are represented using the same object rather than copied, so when one is reduced the other is too.

===A note about complexity===
While the idea of beta reduction seems simple enough, it is not an atomic step, in that it must have a non-trivial cost when estimating [[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=R. |last=Statman |authorlink=Richard Statman |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=4567929 |title=The typed λ-calculus is not elementary recursive |journal=Theoretical Computer Science |year=1979 |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=73–81 |doi=10.1016/0304-3975(79)90007-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; To be precise, one must somehow find the location of all of the occurrences of the bound variable &lt;tt&gt;''V''&lt;/tt&gt; in the expression &lt;tt&gt;''E''&lt;/tt&gt;, implying a time cost, or one must keep track of these locations in some way, implying a space cost. A naïve search for the locations of &lt;tt&gt;''V''&lt;/tt&gt; in &lt;tt&gt;''E''&lt;/tt&gt; is [[Big O notation|''O''(''n'')]] in the length ''n'' of &lt;tt&gt;''E''&lt;/tt&gt;. This has led to the study of systems that use [[explicit substitution]]. Sinot's [[director string]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=F.-R. |last=Sinot |url=http://www.lsv.ens-cachan.fr/~sinot/publis.php?onlykey=sinot-jlc05 |title=Director Strings Revisited: A Generic Approach to the Efficient Representation of Free Variables in Higher-order Rewriting |journal=Journal of Logic and Computation |volume=15 |number=2 |pages=201–218 |year=2005 |doi=10.1093/logcom/exi010 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; offer a way of tracking the locations of free variables in expressions.

===Parallelism and concurrency===
The [[Church–Rosser theorem|Church–Rosser]] property of the lambda calculus means that evaluation (β-reduction) can be carried out in ''any order'', even in parallel. This means that various [[evaluation strategy#Nondeterministic strategies|nondeterministic evaluation strategies]] are relevant. However, the lambda calculus does not offer any explicit constructs for [[parallel computing|parallelism]]. One can add constructs such as [[Futures and promises|Futures]] to the lambda calculus. Other [[process calculi]] have been developed for describing communication and concurrency.

===Optimal reduction===
In Lévy's 1988 paper "[http://pauillac.inria.fr/~levy/pubs/88icot.pdf Sharing in the Evaluation of lambda Expressions]", he defines a notion of optimal sharing, such that no work is ''duplicated''. For example, performing a beta reduction in normal order on &lt;tt&gt;(λ''x''.''xx'') (II)&lt;/tt&gt; reduces it to &lt;tt&gt;II (II)&lt;/tt&gt;. The argument &lt;tt&gt;II&lt;/tt&gt; is duplicated by the application to the first lambda term. If the reduction was done in an applicative order first, we save work because work is not duplicated: &lt;tt&gt;(λ''x''.''xx'') (II)&lt;/tt&gt; reduces to &lt;tt&gt;(λ''x''.''xx'') I&lt;/tt&gt;. On the other hand, using applicative order can result in redundant reductions or even possibly never reduce to normal form. For example, performing a beta reduction in normal order on &lt;tt&gt;(λ''f''.f I) (λy.(λ''x''.''xx'') (y I))&lt;/tt&gt; yields &lt;tt&gt;(λy.(λ''x''.''xx'') (y I)) I&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;(λ''x''.''xx'') (II)&lt;/tt&gt; which we know we can do without duplicating work. Doing the same but in applicative order yields &lt;tt&gt;(λ''f''.f I) (λy.y I (y I))&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;(λy.y I (y I)) I&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;I I (I I)&lt;/tt&gt;, and now work is duplicated.

Lévy shows the existence of lambda terms where there ''does not exist'' a sequence of reductions which reduces them without duplicating work. The below lambda term is such an example.

&lt;tt&gt;((λg.(g(g(λx.x))))
(λh.((λf.(f(f(λz.z))))
(λw.(h(w(λy.y)))))))&lt;/tt&gt;

It is composed of three similar terms, &lt;tt&gt;x=((λg. ... ) (λh.y))&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;y=((λf. ...) (λw.z) )&lt;/tt&gt;, and finally &lt;tt&gt;z=λw.(h(w(λy.y)))&lt;/tt&gt;. There are only two possible beta reductions to be done here, on x and on y. Reducing the outer x term first results in the inner y term being duplicated, and each copy will have to be reduced, but reducing the inner y term first will duplicate its argument z, which will cause work to be duplicated when the values of h and w are made known. Incidentally, the above term reduces to the identity function &lt;tt&gt;(λy.y)&lt;/tt&gt;, and is constructed by making wrappers which make the identity function available to the binders &lt;tt&gt;g=λh...&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;f=λw...&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;h=λx.x&lt;/tt&gt; (at first), and &lt;tt&gt;w=λz.z&lt;/tt&gt; (at first), all of which are applied to the innermost term &lt;tt&gt;λy.y&lt;/tt&gt;.

The precise notion of duplicated work relies on noticing that after the first reduction of &lt;tt&gt;I I&lt;/tt&gt; is done, the value of the other &lt;tt&gt;I I&lt;/tt&gt; can be determined, because they have the same structure (and in fact they have exactly the same values), and result from a common ancestor. Such similar structures can each be assigned a label that can be tracked across reductions. If a name is assigned to the redex that produces all the resulting &lt;tt&gt;II&lt;/tt&gt; terms, and then all duplicated occurrences of &lt;tt&gt;II&lt;/tt&gt; can be tracked and reduced in one go. However, it is not obvious that a redex will produce the &lt;tt&gt;II&lt;/tt&gt; term. Identifying the structures that are similar in different parts of a lambda term can involve a complex algorithm and can possibly have a complexity equal to the history of the reduction itself.

While Lévy defines the notion of optimal sharing, he does not provide an algorithm to do it. In Vincent van Oostrom, Kees-Jan van de Looij, and Marijn Zwitserlood's paper ''[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237723293_Lambdascope_Another_optimal_implementation_of_the_lambda-calculus Lambdascope: Another optimal implementation of the lambda-calculus]'', they provide such an algorithm by transforming lambda terms into [[interaction nets]], which are then reduced. Roughly speaking, the resulting reduction is optimal because every term that would have the same labels as per Lévy's paper would also be the same graph in the interaction net. In the paper, they mention that their prototype implementation of Lambdascope performs as well as the ''optimised'' version of the reference optimal higher order machine BOHM.

More details can be found in the short article [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/312462365_About_the_efficient_reduction_of_lambda_terms About the efficient reduction of lambda terms].

==Semantics==
The fact that lambda calculus terms act as functions on other lambda calculus terms, and even on themselves, led to questions about the semantics of the lambda calculus. Could a sensible meaning be assigned to lambda calculus terms? The natural semantics was to find a set ''D'' isomorphic to the function space ''D'' → ''D'', of functions on itself. However, no nontrivial such ''D'' can exist, by [[cardinality]] constraints because the set of all functions from ''D'' to ''D'' has greater cardinality than ''D'', unless ''D'' is a [[singleton set]].

In the 1970s, [[Dana Scott]] showed that, if only [[Scott continuity|continuous functions]] were considered, a set or [[Domain theory|domain]] ''D'' with the required property could be found, thus providing a [[Model theory|model]] for the lambda calculus.

This work also formed the basis for the [[denotational semantics]] of programming languages.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7198">In [[applied mathematics]], the '''Leslie matrix''' is a [[Discrete mathematics|discrete]], [[Age class structure|age-structured]] model of [[population growth]] that is very popular in [[population ecology]]. It was invented by and named after Patrick H. Leslie. The Leslie [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] (also called the Leslie model) is one of the most well known ways to describe the growth of populations (and their projected age distribution), in which a population is closed to migration, growing in an unlimited environment, and where only one sex, usually the [[female]], is considered.

The Leslie matrix is used in [[ecology]] to model the changes in a population of organisms over a period of time. In a Leslie model, the population is divided into groups based on age classes.  A similar model which replaces age classes with [[ontogenetic stage]]s is called a Lefkovitch matrix,&lt;ref&gt;Hal Caswell (2001). Matrix Population Models: Construction, Analysis, and Interpretation. Sinauer.&lt;/ref&gt; whereby individuals can both remain in the same stage class or move on to the next one. At each time step, the population is represented by a [[vector (geometric)|vector]] with an element for each age class where each element indicates the number of individuals currently in that class.

The Leslie matrix is a square matrix with the same number of rows and columns as the population vector has elements. The (i,j)th cell in the matrix indicates how many individuals will be in the age class ''i'' at the next time step for each individual in stage ''j''. At each time step, the population vector is multiplied by the Leslie matrix to generate the population vector for the subsequent time step.

To build a matrix, some information must be known from the population:

* &lt;math&gt;n_x&lt;/math&gt;, the count of individuals (''n'') of each age class ''x''
* &lt;math&gt;s_x&lt;/math&gt;, the fraction of individuals that survives from age class ''x'' to age class ''x+1'',
* &lt;math&gt;f_x&lt;/math&gt;, [[fecundity]], the [[per capita]] average number of female offspring reaching &lt;math&gt;n_0&lt;/math&gt; born from mother of the age class ''x''. More precisely, it can be viewed as the number of offspring produced at the next age class &lt;math&gt;b_{x+ 1}&lt;/math&gt; weighted by the probability of reaching the next age class. Therefore &lt;math&gt;f_x = s_xb_{x+1}.&lt;/math&gt;

From the observations that &lt;math&gt;n_0&lt;/math&gt; at time ''t+1'' is simply the sum of all offspring born from the previous time step and that the organisms surviving to time ''t+1'' are the organisms at time ''t'' surviving at probability &lt;math&gt;s_x&lt;/math&gt;, one gets &lt;math&gt; n_{x+1} = s_xn_x&lt;/math&gt;. This then implies the following matrix representation:

:&lt;math&gt;
 \begin{bmatrix}
   n_0 \\
   n_1 \\
   \vdots \\
   n_{\omega - 1} \\
 \end{bmatrix}_{t+1}
=
 \begin{bmatrix}
f_0 &amp; f_1 &amp; f_2 &amp; \ldots &amp; f_{\omega  - 2} &amp; f_{\omega  - 1} \\
s_0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \ldots &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; s_1 &amp; 0 &amp; \ldots &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; s_2 &amp; \ldots &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \ldots &amp; s_{\omega - 2}  &amp; 0
 \end{bmatrix}
 \begin{bmatrix}
  n_0 \\ n_1 \\ \vdots\\ n_{\omega - 1}
 \end{bmatrix}_{t}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum age attainable in the population.

This can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}_{t+1} = \mathbf{L}\mathbf{n}_t&lt;/math&gt;

or:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}_{t} = \mathbf{L}^t\mathbf{n}_0&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}_t&lt;/math&gt; is the population vector at time ''t'' and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}&lt;/math&gt; is the Leslie matrix. The dominant [[eigenvalue]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}&lt;/math&gt;, denoted &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, gives the population's asymptotic growth rate (growth rate at the stable age distribution). The corresponding [[eigenvector]] provides the stable age distribution, the proportion of individuals of each age within the population. Once the stable age distribution has been reached, a population undergoes [[exponential growth]] at rate &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[characteristic polynomial]] of the matrix is given by the [[Euler–Lotka equation]].

The Leslie model is very similar to a discrete-time [[Markov chain]]. The main difference
is that in a Markov model, one would have &lt;math&gt;f_x+s_x=1&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;,
while the Leslie model may have these sums greater or less than&amp;nbsp;1.

==Stable age structure==
This age-structured growth model suggests a steady-state, or stable, age-structure and growth rate. Regardless of the initial population size, &lt;math&gt;N_0&lt;/math&gt;, or age distribution, the population tends asymptotically to this age-structure and growth rate. It also returns to this state following perturbation. The [[Euler&amp;ndash;Lotka equation]] provides a means of identifying the intrinsic growth rate. The stable age-structure is determined both by the growth rate and the survival function (i.e. the Leslie matrix). For example, a population with a large intrinsic growth rate will have a disproportionately “young” age-structure. A population with high mortality rates at all ages (i.e. low survival) will have a similar age-structure. Charlesworth (1980) provides further details on the rate and form of convergence to the stable age-structure.

==The random Leslie case==
There is a generalization of the population growth rate to when a Leslie matrix has random elements which may be correlated. When characterizing the disorder, or uncertainties, in vital parameters; a perturbative formalism has to be used to deal with linear non-negative [[random matrix]] [[Matrix difference equation|difference equations]]. Then the non-trivial, effective eigenvalue which defines the long-term asymptotic dynamics of the mean-value population state vector can be presented as the effective growth rate. This eigenvalue and the associated mean-value invariant state vector can be calculated from the smallest positive root of a secular polynomial and the residue of the mean-valued Green function. Exact and perturbative results can thusly be analyzed for several models of disorder.

A '''major stationary source''' is a source that emits more than a certain amount of a [[pollutant]] as defined by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA). The amount of pollutants allowed for certain new sources is defined by the EPA's [[New Source Performance Standard]]s (NSPS).

A '''stationary source''' in air quality terminology is any fixed emitter of air pollutants, such as [[fossil fuel]] burning [[power plant]]s, [[petroleum refineries]], [[Petrochemical|petrochemical plants]], [[Food processing|food processing plants]] and other heavy industrial sources.

A '''mobile source''' in air quality terminology is a non-stationary source of air pollutants, such as automobiles, buses, trucks, ships, trains, aircraft and various other vehicles.

A '''Mason jar''', named after [[John Landis Mason]] who first invented and patented it in 1858, is a molded [[glass]] [[jar]] used in [[home canning]] to [[food preservation|preserve food]]. The jar's mouth  has a [[screw thread]] on its outer perimeter to accept a metal ring (or "band"). The band, when screwed down, presses a separate [[Stamping (metalworking)|stamped]] tin-plated steel disc-shaped [[lid (container)|lid]] against the jar's rim. An integral rubber ring on the underside of the lid creates a [[hermetic seal]]. The bands and lids usually come with new jars, but they are also sold separately. While the bands are reusable, the lids are intended for single use when canning. Largely supplanted by other products and methods for commercial canning, such as tin cans and plastic containers, glass jars and metal lids are still commonly used in [[home canning]]. Mason jars are also called '''Ball jars''', in reference to the [[Ball Corporation]], an early and prolific manufacturer of glass canning jars; '''fruit jars''' for a common content; and '''glass canning jars''' a generic term reflecting their material and purpose. '''Lightning fruit jars''', another type of Mason jar, were not as common as the screw-thread version, but they were popular for home canning in the late nineteenth (19th)  and early twentieth (20th) centuries.

==The jar==
[[File:CucumberDillPickles.jpg|thumb|upright|A wide-mouth Mason jar filled with pickles]]
In the United States, standard-size Mason jars are made of [[soda-lime glass]] and come in two sizes: regular mouth, {{convert|2+3/8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} inner and {{convert|2+3/4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} outer diameter, and wide mouth, {{convert|3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} inner and {{convert|3+3/8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} outer diameter, versions. They are also produced in a variety of volumes, including [[Cup (unit)|cup]] (half-pint), [[pint]], [[quart]], and half-[[gallon]].

Among the most common U.S. brands of Mason jars are Ball, Kerr, and Golden Harvest.

[[Image:Mason-jar-lids.jpg|thumb|300px|Mason jar lids and bands. The integral soft rubber ring on the underside of the lid seals onto the rim of the jar during processing.]]
{{main article|Home canning}}
In home canning, food is packed into the mason jar, leaving some empty "head space" between the level of food and the top of the jar. The lid is placed on top of the jar with the integral rubber seal resting on the rim. A band is screwed loosely over the lid, allowing air and steam to escape. The jar is heat [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterilized]] in boiling water or steam and the lid is secured. The jar is then allowed to cool to room temperature.

The cooling of the contents creates a vacuum in the head space, pulling the lid into tight contact with the jar rim to create a hermetic seal. Once cooled, the band is removed to prevent residual water between the jar threads and the lid from rusting the band. If the jar seal is properly formed, internal vacuum will keep the lid tightly on the jar. Most metal lids used today are slightly domed to serve as a seal status indicator. The vacuum in a properly sealed mason jar pulls the lid down to create a  concave-shaped dome. An improper or failed seal or microbial growth will cause the dome to pop upward.

== History ==
[[File:Boutappertcolljpb.jpg|thumb|left|160px|[[Nicolas Appert]]’s canning jar]]
French chef [[Nicolas Appert]] invented the method of preserving food by enclosing it in sealed containers. Among the earliest glass jars used for home canning were wax sealers, named in reference to the sealing wax that was poured into a channel around the lip to secure a tin lid. This process, which was complicated and error-prone, became popular in the late 1830s or early 1840s and was commonly used to seal fruit jars from the early 1850s until about 1890. The wax sealing process was largely the only one available until other sealing methods were developed,&lt;ref name=Canning-Jars&gt;{{cite web |author=Bill Lindsey | title =Fruit/Canning Jar Closures | work = | publisher =Society for Historical Archaeology | date = | url =http://www.sha.org/bottle/closures.htm#Canning%20Jars | format =| accessdate=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and widely used into the early 1900s.

[[Image:JohnLandisMason.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[John Landis Mason]], inventor of the Mason jar]]
By far the most popular and longest used form of closure for the glass canning jar was a zinc [[screw cap|screw-on cap]], the precursor to today's screw-on lids. It usually had a milk-glass liner, but some of the earliest lids may have had transparent glass liners.&lt;ref name=Canning-Jars/&gt; In 1858, a Vineland tinsmith named [[John Landis Mason]] (1832–1902) invented and patented a screw finish glass jar or bottle that became known as the Mason jar (U.S. Patent No. 22,186.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=John Landis Mason| publisher =National Inventors Hall of Fame | date =|url=http://www.invent.org/inductee-detail/?IID=287| format = | accessdate =2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Edmund F. Ball | title =From Fruit Jars to Satellites: The Story of Ball Brothers Company, Incorporated | publisher =Necomen Society in North America | series = | volume = | edition = | year =1960 | location =New York | page=8 | url = | isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1857, when it was first patented, to the present, Mason jars had hundreds of variations in shape and cap design.&lt;ref name=Canning-Jars/&gt; After it was discovered that Mason's patent had expired, many other manufacturers produced glass jars for home canning using the Mason-style jar.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; "Patent Nov 30th 1858," signifying the date of Mason's patent, was embossed on thousands of jars, which were made in many shapes, sizes, and colors well into the 1900s. Since they were made in such quantity and used for such long periods, many of them have survived to the present day.

Between 1860 and 1900, many other patents were issued for Mason jar improvements and closures.&lt;ref name=Masons&gt;{{cite web| author=Bill Lindsey| title =Bottle Finishes &amp; Closures, Part III: Types of Bottle Closures | work = | publisher =Society for Historical Archaeology | date = |url=  http://www.sha.org/bottle/closures.htm#Masons | format = | accessdate =2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The more esoteric closures were quickly abandoned, and thus can fetch high prices in today's antique market.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} Mason applied for and received a United States trademark, which was registered on May 23, 1871, as U.S. Trademark no. 276.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} Letters of patent issued to Mason on May 10, 1870, for improvements to his fruit-canning jar was determined to be invalid as a result of a patent infringement case brought before the Southern District of New York on June 11, 1874. The court acknowledged that Mason had invented the jar in 1859, but he did not apply for a patent for an improved version of the fruit jar until 1868. In the meantime, several others had patented designs and Mason had known these jars were being produced and sold. The court ruled that Mason's delay in protecting his patent indicated he had abandoned his invention in the intervening years between 1859 and 1868 and had forfeited his patent. The court's decision allowed other manufacturers to patent, produce, and sell glass jars for canning.&lt;ref&gt;"The Consolidated Fruit Jar Company vs. James T. Wright. In Equity" in {{cite book | author=Samuel Blatchford| title =Reports of Cases Argued and Determined in the Circuit Court of the United States for the Second Circuit: 1845–1887 | publisher =Derby and Miller | series = | volume =12 | edition = | year =1875| location =Auburn, NY | pages =149–56 | url =https://books.google.com/?id=kwE8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA149&amp;dq=%22fruit+jar%22| oclc=68813078 |accessdate=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the more popular styles of closures for the Mason jar was the wire bail. The closure consists of a metal wire arrangement with a lever that applies leverage to a glass lid when pivoted downward against the side of the jar, clamping it down over a separate rubber [[O ring]]. The bail-style jars are still widely used in Western Europe, particularly France and Italy, where the two largest manufacturers (France's Le Parfait and Italy's [[Bormioli Rocco]]) produce the Le Parfait and Fido brands, respectively. While bail-type jars are widely available in the United States, they are generally marketed there exclusively for dry storage and only rarely used for home canning.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

On January 5, 1875, Charles de Quillfeldt of New York City invented a wire-bail closure known as the Lightning closure. Within a short time he sold the patent rights to several individuals, including Henry Putnam and Karl Hutter. The stopper or lid was typically made from metal, porcelain, or ceramic, while a rubber gasket was used to seal the container. Putnam modified de Quillfeldt's design so that the lid was secured by centering the wire bail between two raised dots or in a groove along the lid's center. Putnam's closure was patented 1882 (U.S. Patent #256,857).&lt;ref name=Closure-Type&gt;{{cite web| author=Bill Lindsey| title =A. General Closure Types | work = | publisher =Society for Historical Archaeology | date = | url = http://www.sha.org/bottle/closures.htm#General%20Closure%20Types| format = | accessdate =2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Quillfeldt used the term "Lightning" to refer to the sealing method, but the closure's popular use on fruit jars led to the name, Lightning fruit jar. The sealing surface on the jar was a "shelf" that supported the lower edge of the lid. A rubber gasket between the shelf and the bottom surface of the lid formed a secure seal when the wire closure was tightened. Although Lightning jars were popular for home canning use from the early 1880s to the early 1900s, they were not as common as screw-thread Mason jars.&lt;ref name=Closure-Type/&gt; The first U.S.-made brand of jars to use this type of closure was embossed with "Lightning" on the side.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

A new type of Mason jar known as a "bead" jar was introduced around 1910 to 1915. These continuous screw-thread jars were designed with a bead between the screw threads and the shoulder as a sealing surface. The Ball Perfect Mason jar, one of the most common jars of this style, was introduced around 1913 and produced until the mid-twentieth century. It had several variations, including a square-shaped jar.&lt;ref name=Canning-Jars/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=William F. Brantley | title =A Collector's Guide to Ball Jars | publisher = Rosemary Humbert Martin  | series = | volume = | edition = | year =1975 | location =Muncie, IN | page =55 | url = | oclc =3104299}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the twentieth century, bead jars were sealed with two-piece metal lids. The jar lid had a rubber or rubber-like sealing surface and was held in place by a separate metal band. This type of jar and closure, which first became popular in the late 1910s and 1920s, is still in use.&lt;ref name=Canning-Jars/&gt;

The decline in Mason jar manufacturing in North America is due to several factors: the lack of U.S.-based manufacturers of bail-closure jars since the early 1960s, a sharp decline in popularity of home canning in the 1950s and 1960s, consolidation of the U.S. canning jar industry, and the resulting higher cost of imported European-made jars.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} The Ball Corporation, which once dominated the market as the largest domestic manufacturer of home-canning jars, spun off its home-canning business in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Ball Corporation was the largest domestic manufacturer of home canning jars prior to 1933. In 1939 the company manufactured fifty-four percent of all the canning jars made in the United States. See {{cite book | author=Frederic A. Birmingham, | coauthors = | title =Ball Corporation: The First Century | publisher =Curtis Publishing Company | series = | volume = | edition = | year =1980 | location =Indianapolis, IN | pages =139–40 | url = | isbn =9780893870393}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ball ceased production of canning jars when its subsidiary, Alltrista, became a separate company in 1993. Alltrista was renamed Jarden Corporation in 2001. See {{cite web| author= | vauthors = | title =Alltrista Corporation History | work = | publisher =Funding Universe | date = | url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Alltrista-Corporation-Company-History.html | accessdate =2016-03-25}} {{cite web| author= | vauthors = | title =Company History | work = | publisher =Jarden Corporation | date = | url=http://www.jarden.com/about/company-history | format = | accessdate =2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Older styles of home canning jars are "Not Recommended" by the U.S.-based National Center for Home Food Preservation, the United States Department of Agriculture, and University Extension Services.  These include: (A) those using a zinc cap and a rubber jar ring,  and (B) those using a glass lid, wire bail, and rubber sealing ring. These provide "no definitive way to determine if a vacuum seal is formed."&lt;ref&gt;Patti Griffith, University of Wyoming Cooperative Extension Service, in her reference to the use of older versions of Mason jar closures, explains, "Jars requiring a zinc cap and jar rubber or jars requiring a glass lid, wire bail, and jar rubber have not been recommended since 1989 because there is no definitive way to determine if a vacuum seal is formed." See {{cite journal| author=Patti Griffith | title=The Time is Ripe for Summer Melons |journal=Canner's Corner: Enjoying Summer's Bounty| volume=MP-119-2| issue=2 |publisher=University of Wyoming Cooperative Extension Service| location =Laramie, WY| url=http://www.wyomingextension.org/agpubs/pubs/MP119_2.pdf |accessdate=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 15, 2017, the Registrar at National Day Calendar proclaimed National Mason Jar Day to be observed annually as a National Holiday on November 30th, beginning in 2017. This holiday was created by Unboxing the Bizarre. &lt;ref&gt;https://nationaldaycalendar.com/national-mason-jar-day-november-30/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collecting ==
[[File:Antique Mason jars.jpg|thumb|300px|Antique Mason jars.]]
Antique canning jars are often sold through antique stores and auction sites such as [[eBay]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} The value of a jar is related to its age, rarity, color, and condition. A jar's age and rarity can be determined by the color, shape, mold and production marks of the glass, and the jar's closure. Mason jars usually have a proprietary brand embossed on the jar. Early jars embossed with "Mason's Patent November 28th 1858" that date from the late 1850s to early 1860s closely match the illustrations of Mason's 1858 patents. Mouth-blown (or hand-blown) jars embossed with a version of "Mason's Patent November 28th 1858" were made about 1857 to 1908 and often had a ground lip as well. By 1908 semi-automatic machines manufactured the majority of these jars. Machine-made Mason jars that originated around 1909 have a sealing surface on a bead ledge below the threads. This type of jar dominated the market by the mid to late 1910s. Manufacturers continued to make jars with the beaded seal after the mid-twentieth century.&lt;ref name=Canning-Jars/&gt; Ball's "Ideal" canning jar, which first appeared around 1915 and was discontinued in 1962, is one of the company's best-known jars and is popular among collectors.&lt;ref&gt;Brantley, pp. 39–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Colored jars were considered better for canning because the color blocked some light from reaching the food, which helps to retain flavor and nutritional value longer.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} Most antique jars that are not colorless are aqua or  "Ball blue," a blue-green shade that was named for the Ball Corporation, a prevalent jar manufacturer. Most mouth-blown Mason jars embossed with some type of 1858 patent date were produced in aqua glass. The Ball brand of Mason jars were manufactured in several colors, but the most common color was the distinctive "Ball blue," which the Ball Corporation used in its jars from about 1910 to 1930. Mason jars with this particular color of glass may be attributed to Ball, since "virtually no other bottle or jar was made in that color."&lt;ref name=Canning-Jars/&gt; More rarely, jars will turn up in amber, and occasionally in darker shades of green. Rarer still are cobalt blue, black, and milk-glass jars. Some unscrupulous dealers will irradiate jars to bring out colors not original to the jar.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

In ecology, '''matutinal''' is a term used to describe a characteristic behaviour of [[crepuscular animal]]s, that is, when they are significantly active during pre-dawn or early morning hours. The variant term '''matinal''' may also be used in place of matutinal (most often seen in [[Entomology|entomological]] writings).&lt;ref name=":112"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Estes|first=James R.|last2=Thorp|first2=Robbin W.|date=1975|title=Pollination Ecology of Pyrrhopappus carolinianus (Compositae)|jstor=2441589|journal=American Journal of Botany|volume=62|issue=2|pages=148–159|doi=10.2307/2441589}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":122"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Linsley|first=E.

== Etymology ==
{{wikt}}The [[etymology]] of the term “matutinal” is the [[Latin]] word mātūtīnus, "of or pertaining to the morning" (from [[Mater Matuta|Mātūta]], Roman goddess of the dawn + -īnus, "-ine") + -ālis, "-al".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dictionary.com/|title=Dictionary.com - The world’s favorite online dictionary!|website=Dictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Adaptive Relevance ==
[[Evolutionary pressure|Selection pressures,]] such as high predatory activity or low food may require animals to change their behaviours to adapt. An animal changing the time of day at which it carries out significant tasks (e.g., mating and/or foraging) is recognized as one of these adaptive behaviours. For example, human activity, which is more predominant during daylight hours, has forced certain species (most often larger mammals) living in [[urban area]]s to shift their schedules to crepuscular ones.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;  When observed in environments where there is little or no human activity, these same species often do not exhibit this temporal shift.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;  It may be argued that if the goal is to avoid human activity, or any other diurnal predator's activity, a nocturnal schedule would be safer. However, many of these animals depend on sight, so a matutinal or crepuscular schedule is especially advantageous as it allows animals to both avoid predation, and have sufficient light to mate and forage.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

=== Matutinal Mating ===
For certain species, commencing mating during the early morning's twilight period may be adaptive because it could reduce the risk of predation, increase the chance of finding mates, and reduce competition for mates, all of which may increase reproductive success.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Double|first=M|last2=Cockburn|first2=A|date=2000-03-07|title=Pre-dawn infidelity: females control extra-pair mating in superb fairy-wrens. |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume=267|issue=1442|pages=465–470|pmc=1690561|pmid=10737403}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Green|first=David J.|last2=Cockburn|first2=Andrew|last3=Hall|first3=Michelle L.|last4=Osmond|first4=Helen|last5=Dunn|first5=Peter O.|date=1995-12-22|title=Increased opportunities for cuckoldry may be why dominant male fairy-wrens tolerate helpers|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/262/1365/297|journal=Proc.

To mate, they must terminate this pose and take up a more vulnerable one. They only do this during matutinal hours.]]

==== Anti-Predatory Adaptation ====
Animals are generally more vulnerable during [[Sexual intercourse|copulation]] (e.g., praying mantis), so mating during a time when there is less predatory activity may be an anti-predatory adaptation.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Some species may even take up to several hours to finish mating, which increases this vulnerability.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321443883_Matutinal_mating_in_Aeshna_grandis_and_A_Viridis_-A_behavioural_pair_of_twins_prefers_early-morning_sex_Odonata_Aeshnidae|title=Matutinal mating in Aeshna grandis and A. Viridis -A behavioural pair of twins prefers early-morning sex (Odonata: Aeshnidae)|last=Borkenstein|first=Angelika|last2=Schröter|first2=Asmus|last3=Jödicke|first3=Reinhard|date=2017-12-01|volume=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; For species that copulate for longer periods, shifting their mating schedule may additionally allow enough time for the male to completely inseminate the female (i.e., it will reduce the chance of having to escape from a predator mid-copulation). One example of a matutinal mating routine is exhibited by female [[Mantis|tropical praying mantises]] (''Mantis religiosa).''&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; To avoid detection from predators they use different stances to [[Crypsis|blend in]] with their environment. They can orient themselves to look like leaves or sticks. However, when females are ready to mate they will take up a different posture where they expose [[pheromone]]-emitting [[gland]]s that attract mates, and in the process must disengage from their normal camouflaging stance. Likely to compensate for this vulnerability, females will initiate this stance only at first light when diurnal predators that are visual hunters are less active (e.g., birds and insectivorous primates).&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

==== Reduced Competition ====
[[File:Superb_Fairywren.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Superb_Fairywren.jpg|thumb|202x202px|A superb fairywren (''Malurus cyaneus).'' This bird engages in extra-pair copulations during pre-dawn and early morning hours.]]Some animals engage in matutinal searching flights to find mates early in the morning. It is thought that this is adaptive because it increases the chance of finding mates, and reduces competition for mates (i.e., by flying directly to a potential mate before it has a chance to find other mates). This is supported by the mating behaviour of certain [[Monogamy|socially monogamous]] birds. For example, female [[superb fairywren]]s (''Malurus cyaneus)'', are a monogamous bird that perform [[extra-pair copulation]]s during matutinal hours.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Westneat|first=David F.|last2=Sherman|first2=Paul W.|date=1997-10-01|title=Density and extra-pair fertilizations in birds: a comparative analysis|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s002650050381|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|language=en|volume=41|issue=4|pages=205–215|doi=10.1007/s002650050381|issn=0340-5443}}&lt;/ref&gt; One explanation for the prevalence of extra-pair copulation is that it enhances the [[gene pool]] of the species' offspring.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233821647_EPP_results_from_female_preference_for_high-quality_males_in_the_blue_tit|title=EPP results from female preference for high-quality males in the blue tit|last=Kempenaers|first=Bart|last2=Verheyen|first2=Geert|last3=Van den Broeck|first3=Marleen|last4=Burke|first4=Terry|last5=Van Broeckhoven|first5=Christine|last6=Dhondt|first6=André|date=1992-06-11|volume=357}}&lt;/ref&gt; This activity is most often seen matutinally because they: (1) can avoid being followed by their monogamous partner in the dimly-lit early morning, (2) males are more likely to be present in their territory during these hours, and (3) males are more likely to have a higher quantity of sperm in the early morning.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; These points may apply to how matutinal mating is adaptive in other species.

Similar behaviours have been observed in other species, such as in males of two species of [[Dragonfly|dragonflies]] (''Aeshna grandis'' &amp; ''Aeshna viridis'').&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; They engage in matutinal searching flights each morning until they find a receptive female to mate with. A similar phenomenon is seen in male praying mantises, where they respond to the emerging light each morning by increasing flight activity.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

=== Matutinal Foraging ===
Some animals exhibit increased foraging behaviour during the matutinal hours. Some examples of why this may be adaptive are: (1) it may increase predatory success and (2) competition for food may be reduced.&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;
[[File:Blue_shark.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Blue_shark.jpg|left|thumb|220x220px|A blue shark (''Prionace glauca).'' These sharks spend more time at the ocean's surface during matutinal hours - likely for predatory reasons.]]

==== Predatory Adaptation ====
The [[blue shark]] (''Prionace glauca)'' is a predator that primarily hunts during the pre-dawn to dawn period.&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt; During matutinal hours, they spend more time than any other point in the day at the surface of the ocean.&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt; It is likely that they are taking advantage of the increased density of prey at the water's surface during dawn.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; It is also possible that, since only a thin layer at the surface of the ocean is dimly lit during this twilight period, the shark (coming up from the dark ocean depths) has vision of the prey, but the prey do not have vision of the shark, allowing the shark to sneak up on the prey, increasing predatory success.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hammerschlag|first=Neil|last2=Martin|first2=R. Aidan|last3=Fallows|first3=Chris|date=2006-08-01|title=Effects of environmental conditions on predator–prey interactions between white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) and Cape fur seals (Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus) at Seal Island, South Africa|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10641-006-9038-z|journal=Environmental Biology of Fishes|language=en|volume=76|issue=2-4|pages=341–350|doi=10.1007/s10641-006-9038-z|issn=0378-1909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Reduced Competition ====
Some bees (e.g., ''Ptiloglossa arizonensis, Pt. jonesi, Caupolicana,'' and ''Hemihalictus lustrans'') forage matutinally, possibly because there is less competition for food during this period.&lt;ref name=":112" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":122" /&gt; The ''Hemihalictus lustrans,'' for example, is a bee that works mutualistically with the dandellion ''Pyrrhopappus carolinianus'' during matutinal hours''.''&lt;ref name=":112" /&gt; ''Pyrrhopappus carolinianus'' flowers very early in the morning and ''Hemihalictus lustrans'' begins foraging at the same time. The bee tears open the dandellion's anthers just as it is flowering, which speeds up [[anthesis]] and ensures that it almost always has first claim to the dandellion's pollen.&lt;ref name=":112" /&gt;

== Physiological Evidence of Adaptation ==
These matutinal behaviours may be induced by physiological adaptations. Robinson &amp; Robinson&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; reversed the day-night schedule of female tropical praying mantises (i.e., by placing them in light during the night, and in a chamber with no light during the day). After they adjusted to the schedule, the praying mantises were removed from their chambers at different times throughout the newly adjusted night period and placed in the light. Each praying mantis initiated their pheromone-emitting stance during this transition regardless of the time, which suggests that this behaviour depends solely on the transition from dark to light. The authors suggested that this was likely a physiological adaptation.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

'''Mythopoeic thought''' is a hypothetical stage of human thought preceding modern thought, proposed by [[Henri Frankfort]] and his wife Henriette Antonia Frankfort in the 1940s. According to this proposal, there was a "mythopoeic" stage, in which humanity did not think in terms of generalizations and impersonal laws: instead, humans saw each event as an act of will on the part of some personal being. This way of thinking supposedly explains the ancients' tendency to create [[myth]]s, which portray events as acts of gods and spirits. A physiological motivation for this was suggested by [[Julian Jaynes]] in 1976 in the form of [[bicameralism (psychology)|bicameralism]].

==The term==
The term ''[[wikt:mythopoeic|mythopoeic]]'' means "myth-making" (from Greek ''muthos,'' "myth", and ''poiein,'' "to make"). A group of Near Eastern specialists used the term in their 1946 book ''The Intellectual Adventure of Ancient Man: An Essay on Speculative Thought in the Ancient Near East,'' later republished as the 1949 paperback ''Before Philosophy: The Intellectual Adventure of Ancient Man.''&lt;ref&gt; Segal, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; In this book's introduction, two of the specialists, Henri and Mrs. H.A. Frankfort, argue that mythopoeic thought characterizes a distinct stage of human thought that differs fundamentally from modern, scientific thought. Mythopoeic thought, the Frankforts claim, was concrete and personifying, whereas modern thought is abstract and impersonal: more basically, mythopoeic thought is "pre-philosophical", while modern thought is "philosophical".&lt;ref&gt;Segal, p. 40–41&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this basic contrast between mythopoeic and modern thought, the Frankforts often use the term "mythopoeic thought" as a synonym for ancient thought in general.

==Characteristics==

===Personalistic view of nature===
According to the Frankforts, "the fundamental difference between the attitudes of modern and ancient man as regards the surrounding world is this: for modern, scientific man the phenomenal world is primarily an 'It'; for ancient—and also for primitive—man it is a 'Thou'".&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, modern man sees most things as impersonal objects, whereas ancient man sees most things as persons.

According to the Frankforts, ancients viewed the world this way because they didn't think in terms of universal laws. Modern thought "reduces the chaos of perceptions to an order in which typical events take place according to universal laws."&lt;ref name="Frankfort, p. 15"&gt;Frankfort, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; For example, consider a river that usually rises in the spring. Suppose that, one spring, the river fails to rise. In that case, modern thought doesn't conclude that the laws of nature have changed; instead, it searches for a set of fixed, universal laws that can explain why the river has risen in other cases but not in this case. Modern thought is abstract: it looks for unifying principles behind diversity.

In contrast, the Frankforts argue, "the primitive mind cannot withdraw to that extent from perceptual reality".&lt;ref name="Frankfort, p. 15"/&gt; Mythopoeic thought doesn't look for unifying principles behind the diversity of individual events. It is concrete, not abstract: it takes each individual event at face value. When a river rises one year and fails to rise another year, mythopoeic thought doesn't try to unite those two different events under a common law. Instead, "when the river does not rise, it has ''refused'' to rise".&lt;ref name="Frankfort, p. 15"/&gt; And if no law governs the river's behavior, if the river has simply "refused" to rise, then its failure to rise must be a ''choice'': "The river, or the gods, must be angry", and must be ''choosing'' to withhold the annual flooding.&lt;ref name="Frankfort, p. 15"/&gt; Thus, mythopoeic thought ends up viewing the entire world as personal: each event is an act of will.

===Tolerance of contradiction===
The Frankforts argue that mythopoeic thought explains the tolerance of seeming contradictions in mythology. According to the Frankforts' theory, the ancients didn't try to unite different experiences under a universal law; instead, they took each individual experience at face value. Therefore, they sometimes took one experience and developed a myth from it, and took a different experience and developed a different myth from it, without worrying whether those two myths contradicted each other: "The ancients ... are likely to present various descriptions of natural phenomena side by side even though they are mutually exclusive."&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the ancient Egyptians had three different creation myths.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, p. 50–60&lt;/ref&gt;

==The loss of mythopoeic thought==
According to the Frankforts, "ancient Egyptians and Mesopotamians"—the Frankforts' area of expertise—"lived in a wholly mythopoeic world".&lt;ref name="Segal, p. 42"&gt;Segal, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Each natural force, each concept, was a personal being from their viewpoint: "In Egypt and Mesopotamia the divine was comprehended as [[immanent]]: the gods were in nature."&lt;ref name="Frankfort, p. 363"&gt;Frankfort, p. 363&lt;/ref&gt; This immanence and multiplicity of the divine is a direct result of mythopoeic thought: hence, the first step in the loss of mythopoeic thought was the loss of this view of the divine. The ancient Hebrews took this first step through their doctrine of a single, transcendent God: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"When we read in Psalm 19 that 'the heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handiwork,' we hear a voice which mocks the beliefs of the Egyptians and Babylonians. The heavens, which were to the psalmist but a witness of God's greatness, were to the Mesopotamians the very majesty of godhead, the highest ruler, [[Anu]]. [...] The God of the psalmists and the prophets was not in nature. He transcended nature — and transcended, likewise, the realm of mythopoeic thought."&lt;ref name="Frankfort, p. 363"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ancient Hebrews still saw each major event as a divine act. However, they saw the divine as a single being—not a myriad of spirits, one for each natural phenomenon. Moreover, they didn't see the divine as a will within nature: for them, the divine will was a force or law ''behind'' all natural events.

Some Greek philosophers went further. Instead of seeing each event as an act of will, they developed a notion of impersonal, universal law: they finally abandoned mythopoeic thought, postulating impersonal laws behind all natural phenomena.&lt;ref name="Segal, p. 42"/&gt; These philosophers may not have been scientific by today's rigid standards: their hypotheses were often based on assumptions, not empirical data.&lt;ref name ="Frankfort, p. 386"&gt;Frankfort, p. 386&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the mere fact that they looked behind the apparent diversity and individuality of events in search of underlying laws, and defied "the prescriptive sanctities of religion", the Greeks broke away from mythopoeic thought.&lt;ref name="Frankfort, p. 386"/&gt;

==Criticism==
Religious scholar Robert Segal has pointed out that the dichotomy between a personal and an impersonal view of the world is not absolute, as the Frankforts' distinction between ancient and modern thought might suggest: "Any phenomenon can surely be experienced as both an It and a Thou: consider, for example, a pet and a patient."&lt;ref name="Segal, p. 42"/&gt; Furthermore, Segal argues, it is "embarrassingly simplistic" to call the ancient Near East "wholly mythopoeic", the Hebrews "largely nonmythopoeic", and the Greeks "wholly scientific".&lt;ref name="Segal, p. 42"/&gt;

'''Naro Space Center''' is a [[South Korea]]n [[spaceport]] in [[South Jeolla]]'s [[Goheung|Goheung County]], operated by the state-run [[Korea Aerospace Research Institute]].

The spaceport is located about {{convert|485|km|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} south of [[Seoul]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/techscience/2009/08/20/0601000000AEN20090820004200320.HTML ''Software glitch halts rocket launch'' - Yonhap News Agency]&lt;/ref&gt; It includes a launch pad, a control tower, rocket assembly and test facilities, facilities for satellite control testing and assembly, a media center, an electric power station, a space experience hall and a landing field.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.spacedaily.com/news/korea-03b.html South Korea Begins Construction Of New Space Center]'' – Korean Information Service, ''SpaceDaily'', August 12, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Korea to enter space race in 2008", http://www.korea.net/News/News/NewsView.asp?serial_no=20080102014&amp;part=107|, Ro Ji-woong Korea.net Staff Writer, 03 January, 2008, accessed October 28, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The first launch, initially planned for 19 August 2009, was performed on 25 August 2009 using a Russo-South Korean [[Naro-1]] rocket, but failed to reach the desired orbit. Another rocket launch from Naro was planned for May 2010, but delays pushed the launch to June. On June 10, 2010, this second attempt also ended in failure when the rocket lost communications 137 seconds after launch.  The South Korean science minister Ahn Byung-man  later told reporters that the rocket was believed to have exploded. A third attempt was made on January 30th 2013 and finally succeeded in putting a satellite into orbit.

South Korea's next rocket, the [[KSLV-2]] is also scheduled to be launched from Naro in 2019.

The '''OPC Data Access''' Specification is the first of a group of [[Specification (technical standard)|specifications]] known as the [[OLE for process control|OPC]] Classic Specifications.&lt;ref&gt;https://opcfoundation.org/developer-tools/specifications-classic/data-access/&lt;/ref&gt;

OPC Data Access is a group of [[Client-server model|client-server]] standards that provides specifications for communicating real-time data from [[data acquisition]] devices such as [[Programmable logic controller|PLC]]s to display and interface devices like [[human-machine interface|Human-Machine Interfaces]] (HMI), [[SCADA]] systems&lt;ref&gt;https://opcfoundation.org/about/what-is-opc/&lt;/ref&gt; and also [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]]/[[Manufacturing execution system|MES]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com.br/books?id=8Lj8CAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA352&amp;ots=K1soEbX1SM&amp;dq=ERP%2FMES%20%22OPC%20DA%22%20OR%20%22OPC%20Data%20Access%22&amp;pg=PA352#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; The specifications focus on the continuous communication of data.

The OPC Data Access specification is also known as OPC DA. OPC DA deals only with real-time data and not historical data (for historical data you need to use [[OPC Historical Data Access]], or OPC HDA) or events (for Alarms and Events you need to use [[OPC Alarms and Events]], or OPC AE).  There are three attributes associated with OPC DA data. These are
# a value,
# the [[quality (business)|quality]] of the value, and
# a [[timestamp]].

The OPC DA specification states that these three attributes have to be returned to an OPC client making a request. Therefore, if the data source is not capable of providing a timestamp, for example, the OPC DA server must create a timestamp.

The OPC Classic specifications are based on the [[Microsoft]] [[Component Object Model|COM]] technology&lt;ref&gt;https://opcfoundation.org/about/opc-technologies/opc-classic/&lt;/ref&gt; and define a [[C language|C]]/[[C++]] [[Interface (computing)|interface]]. A standard [[OLE Automation|Automation]] [[Wrapper library|wrapper]] interface is also defined for access from [[Visual Basic]], [[Embarcadero Delphi|Delphi]] and other automation-enabled languages.&lt;ref&gt;https://opcfoundation.org/developer-tools/developer-kits-classic/automation-wrapper/&lt;/ref&gt; Several vendors offer [[.NET Framework|.NET]] toolkits to make the OPC interface accessible in .NET [[Application software|applications]].

The newer OPC .NET ([[OPC Xi]]) specification is based on WCF ([[Windows Communication Foundation]]) and defines a .NET interface with the functionality of the OPC Classic specifications OPC DA, OPC HDA and OPC AE (Alarms&amp;Events).&lt;ref&gt;https://opcfoundation.org/about/opc-technologies/opc-net-4-0/&lt;/ref&gt;

The more recent [[OPC Unified Architecture]] allows the same functionality but offers platform independence and optionally complex information modelling capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;https://opcfoundation.org/about/opc-technologies/opc-ua/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paraloid B-72''' or '''B-72''' is a [[thermoplastic]] resin that was created by [[Rohm and Haas]] for use as a surface coating and as a vehicle for [[flexographic ink]]. Today B-72 is commonly being used as an adhesive by [[conservator-restorer]]s, specifically in the [[conservation and restoration of ceramic objects]] and [[conservation and restoration of glass objects|glass objects]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://cameo.mfa.org/wiki/Paraloid_B-72] Paraloid B-72: Museum of Fine Arts Boston: Material Database&lt;/ref&gt; and can also be used for labelling museum objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/01-04.pdf|title=Use Of Acryloid B-72 Lacquer For Labelling Museum Objects|last=|first=|date=|website=https://www.nps.gov/|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
[[File:Paraloid b72.jpg||250px|left|thumb|Paraloid B-72 in pellet form]]
B-72 is a durable and non-yellowing acrylic resin, which can be described chemically as an ethyl-methacrylate copolymer. It is soluble in [[acetone]], [[ethanol]], [[toluene]], and [[xylene]]s, among other solvents and solvent mixtures.&lt;ref&gt;Phenix, A. 1992. Solvents for Paraloid B-72. Conservation News 48:21–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major advantages of B-72 as a consolidant is that it is stronger and harder than [[polyvinyl acetate]] without being extremely brittle. This adhesive is more flexible than many of the other typically used adhesives and tolerates more stress and strain on a join than most others. The major drawbacks to using B-72 are related to its handling properties: as in the case of other acrylic resins it is difficult to apply as an adhesive and to manipulate with precision.&lt;ref name=Koob&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koob|first=Stephen|title=The Use of Paraloid B-72 as an adhesive. Its application for archaeological ceramics and other materials|journal=Studies in Conservation|date=30 April 1986|volume=31|pages=7–14|doi=10.1179/sic.1986.31.1.7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most suitable solvent for B-72 is acetone. However, solvent mixtures with various proportions of acetone, ethanol, and toluene are frequently used to alter the working time of the resin and to produce slightly different properties (hardness and flexibility, e.g.) in the set resin. Unlike [[cellulose nitrate]], B-72 does not need additives like [[plasticizer]]s to stabilize its durability. Fumed [[colloidal silica]] can be added to help with the workability of the resin. Research shows that the silica better distributes the stress and strain that occurs during evaporation of a solvent and during the setting of the adhesive film.&lt;ref name="Koob"/&gt;{{rp|p.9}}

Because of its transparency and versatility, conservators, led by Stephen Koob of the [[Corning Museum of Glass]], have recently begun to use cast sheets of B-72 as a fill material in glass objects.&lt;ref name=Corning&gt;{{cite journal|last=von Giffen|first=Astrid|title=Filling losses with Paraloid B-72.|url=http://www.cmog.org/blog/2011/11/01/filling-losses-with-paraloid-b-72/|publisher=Corning Museum of Glass|accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Personnel Psychology''' is a subfield of [[Industrial and Organizational Psychology]].&lt;ref name=Levy&gt;{{cite book|last=Levy|first=Paul E.|title=Industrial/organizational psychology : understanding the workplace|year=2010|publisher=Worth Publishers|location=New York, NY|isbn=1-4292-2370-7|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Personnel psychology is the area of industrial/organizational psychology that primarily deals with the [[recruitment]], selection and evaluation of [[personnel]], and other job aspects such as morale, [[job satisfaction]], and relationships between managers and workers in the workplace.&lt;ref name=dictionary&gt;{{cite book|last=Reber|first=Arthur S.|title=The Penguin dictionary of psychology|year=2001|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=0-14-051451-1|edition=3.|author2=Reber, Emily S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the field of study that concentrates on the selection and evaluation of employees; this area of psychology deals with [[job analysis]] and defines and measures [[job performance]], [[performance appraisal]], employment testing, employment interviews, employee selection and employee training, and [[human factors and ergonomics]].&lt;ref name=Levy /&gt;

==History==

===Twentieth Century===
By the end of the nineteenth century, industrial, or personnel psychology, was developed as a way to understand work behavior.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia /&gt;  One influential figure in the beginning of this new area was [[Hugo Munsterberg]], a German psychologist who was trained by [[Wilhelm Wundt]] and who also worked with [[William James]].&lt;ref name=encyclopedia /&gt;&lt;ref name=Munger /&gt;  Munsterberg studied selection and fit in the workplace, and he proposed experimental methods as solutions to business problems in his text, ''Psychology and Industrial Efficiency'' (1913).&lt;ref name=encyclopedia&gt;{{cite book|first=Alan E. Kazdin, ed. in chief|title=Encyclopedia of psychology, Vol. 4|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=London|isbn=1-55798-653-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also served on the faculty at Harvard, and in his writings, talked about such topics as fit in a career, from both an employer's and employee's perspective.&lt;ref name=Munger&gt;{{cite book|last=Munger|first=Margaret P.|title=The history of psychology : fundamental questions|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, N.Y [etc.]|isbn=978-0-19-515154-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Dill Scott]], also trained by Wundt and a professor at Northwestern University, is credited with the foundation of I/O psychology, as he used such psychology in advertising and in founding the first personnel consulting firm.&lt;ref name=Levy /&gt;&lt;ref name=encyclopedia /&gt;

===World War I===

The time around WW I brought about significant contributions to the field of industrial psychology. [[Robert Yerkes]], along with Walter Van Dyke Bingham and Scott, headed the selection and placement of army personnel with their [[Army Alpha]] and [[Army Beta]] tests.&lt;ref name=Levy /&gt; These test helped to bring attention to testing as a form of selection and their uses in practical applications.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia /&gt; This was the beginning of industrial psychology in the real world as opposed to the world of academia.&lt;ref name=Levy /&gt;

===World War II===
World War II was marked by much of the same needs as in World War I.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia /&gt; Bingham and Yeakes helped out the military again in developing research programs designed to assess work behavior, including: the Army General Classification Test (AGCT), the Aircrew Classification Test Battery, assessment center methods, and performance appraisal methods.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia /&gt; Post World War II advances were also seen in increased doctoral programs, master's degree programs, and the expansion of other already existing programs.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia /&gt;

===Twenty-first Century===
As opposed to war defining most of the twentieth century and the use of the applied psychology, economics will be the main focus of the twenty-first century.&lt;ref name=Levy /&gt;  Technology is ever changing and decreasing the number of jobs for individuals; organizations are also striving to "flatten" out in their attempts to move away from largely [[hierarchical organization|hierarchical]] companies, and one other changing area of the twenty-first century is the diversifying of the workplace.&lt;ref name=Levy /&gt;  All these applications and areas will help to serve as importance for I/O psychology in the workplace and economic world.&lt;ref name=Levy /&gt;

==Uses==

Personnel psychology is used in a variety of ways. Some of the most important functions it serves range from analyzing [[corporate culture]] and individual and group interactions to developing and evaluating employee selection and appraisal techniques. Other areas of use are assessing corporate [[leadership]] and [[employee motivation]] strategies, identifying causes and resolutions to internal conflicts, advising management of the potential psychological and social impact of corporate policies, and researching ways organizations can effectively manage cultural differences and leadership styles.&lt;ref name="previous book"&gt;{{cite book|last=Aamodt|first=Michael G.|title=Industrial/organizational psychology : an applied approach|year=2010|publisher=Wadsworth|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=0495601063|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Personnel psychologists work in a variety of settings, including education, business, community, and agency environments. Many personnel psychologists serve as human resources specialists, helping organizations with staffing, training, and employee development and management in areas such as strategic planning, quality management, and adjustments to organization changes. Personnel psychologists apply psychological theories and principles to organizations. This field focuses on increasing workplace productivity and related issues such as the physical and mental well being of employees. Personnel psychologists use psychological measurement and research findings related to human abilities, motivation, perception, and learning in seeking to improve the fit between the needs of the work organization and those of the people who populate it.&lt;ref name="previous book" /&gt;

===Job Analysis===
[[Job analysis]] can be defined as "A loose term for the study of particular aspects of a given job. Those aspects may range from the tasks and duties of the position, to an examination of the desirable qualities of an employee, to the conditions of employment including pay, promotion opportunities, vacations, etc.".&lt;ref&gt;[[Industrial &amp; Organizational Assessment]]&lt;/ref&gt; There are many different ways to conduct a job analysis, as there are many different parts to it: job evaluation, job description, and job specifications.&lt;ref name="OD book"&gt;{{cite book|last=Worley|first=Thomas G. Cummings, Christopher G.|title=Organization development &amp; change|year=2009|publisher=South-Western/Cengage Learning|location=Australia|isbn=978-0-324-42138-5|edition=9th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common tool used to measure job design is the ''Job Description Survey'' or JDS,&lt;ref name=WDQ&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morgeson|first=Frederick P.|author2=Humphrey, Stephen E.|title=The Work Design Questionnaire (WDQ): Developing and validating a comprehensive measure for assessing job design and the nature of work.|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|date=1 January 2006|volume=91|issue=6|pages=1321–1339|doi=10.1037/0021-9010.91.6.1321|pmid=17100487}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there is growing literature for other surveys and measures such as the ''Work Design Questionnaire'' or WDQ.&lt;ref name=WDQ /&gt; Such analyses are used to determine "what is important" within the job description, so as to better educate companies and individuals on the descriptions and requirements of the job.&lt;ref name=JDS&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hackman|first=J. Richard|author2=Oldham, Greg R.|title=Development of the Job Diagnostic Survey.|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|date=1 January 1975|volume=60|issue=2|pages=159–170|doi=10.1037/h0076546}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selection===
Selection involves the exchange of information between applicants and employers.&lt;ref name=selection&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bangerter|first=Adrian |author2=Roulin, Nicolas |author3=König, Cornelius J.|title=Personnel selection as a signaling game.|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|date=1 January 2011|doi=10.1037/a0026078|volume=97|pages=719–738|pmid=22040263}}&lt;/ref&gt; Personnel selection involves the goal alignment of applicants and organizations, however those goals may not always line up at times. Thus selection processes are designed to ensure that those goals line up and individuals are the best "fit" for the organization. Thus individuals may be likely to adapt their own behavior to better align with an organization.&lt;ref name=selection /&gt; 
Interviews are one of the most important pieces of information in regards to selection decisions.&lt;ref name="OCB selection"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Podsakoff|first=Nathan P.|author2=Whiting, Steven W. |author3=Podsakoff, Philip M. |author4=Mishra, Paresh |title=Effects of organizational citizenship behaviors on selection decisions in employment interviews.|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|date=1 January 2011|volume=96|issue=2|pages=310–326|doi=10.1037/a0020948 |pmid=20919791}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the interviews, it is found that individuals are more likely to exhibit organizational citizenship behaviors (OCB) in their hopes of being hired by the company, but it is also found that these OCBs play a positive role in the interviewer's evaluation of the individuals.&lt;ref name="OCB selection"/&gt; Today, increases in technology have allowed for a much easier administration of such online tests as measures of aptitude, achievement, and personality. Thus these tests are starting to serve as the first hurdle of the selection process, even more so than the interview.&lt;ref name=feedback&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schinkel|first=Sonja |author2=van Dierendonck, Dirk |author3=van Vianen, Annelies |author4=Ryan, Ann Marie |title=Applicant Reactions to Rejection|journal=Journal of Personnel Psychology|volume=10|issue=4|pages=146–156|doi=10.1027/1866-5888/a000047}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Training===
[[Training and development|Training]] relates to an organization giving an individual the skills, knowledge, and abilities to help put the individual in line with the organization's goal.&lt;ref name="Dardar 2011 929–940"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dardar|first=A. |author2=Jusoh, A. |author3=Rasli A.|title=Impact of training on job turnover: Evidence from contemporary literature.|journal=Interdisciplinary Journal of Contemporary Research in Business|year=2011|volume=3|issue=4|pages=929–940.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Training provides the opportunity for the individual to gain personal, career, and job-related benefits, such as individual increases in job performance, better career relationships and objectives, and pride and job satisfaction.&lt;ref name="Dardar 2011 929–940"/&gt; Research has also shown that the effectiveness of training has a relationship in how the work of an individual is organized.&lt;ref name=Training&gt;{{cite journal|last=Felstead|first=Alan|author2=Gallie, Duncan |author3=Green, Francis |author4= Zhou, Ying |title=Employee involvement, the quality of training and the learning environment: an individual level analysis|journal=The International Journal of Human Resource Management|date=1 August 2010|volume=21|issue=10|pages=1667–1688|doi=10.1080/09585192.2010.500489}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations that allow employees more autonomy and freedom in how they do their work have shown that employees are more able to improve and incorporate training aspects into their work.&lt;ref name=Training /&gt;

===Rewards===
One major approach to [[Wage|compensation]] around the world, is performance based pay.&lt;ref name="performance pay"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ganster|first=Daniel C.|author2=Kiersch, Christa E. |author3=Marsh, Rachel E. |author4=Bowen, Angela |title=Performance-Based Rewards and Work Stress|journal=Journal of Organizational Behavior Management|date=1 October 2011|volume=31|issue=4|pages=221–235|doi=10.1080/01608061.2011.619388}}&lt;/ref&gt; Short of job loss, income security is a major stressor for individuals as they stress out over predictability of income.&lt;ref name="performance pay" /&gt; In contrast, other research has also shown though that such pay systems can actual provide motivation, satisfaction, or desired challenge levels to the job, instead of individuals perceiving it is inequality, unfair, or stressful.&lt;ref name="performance pay" /&gt; 
Stable pay systems have been found to not necessarily be the best link between an individual's performance and his pay level. Stable pay levels can also account for decreases in performance as individuals' incomes are not linked with their performances. Thus these performance levels may drop without a perceived cost to their pay level.&lt;ref name="manager pay"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heneman|first=Herbert G.|title=Impact of performance on managerial pay levels and pay changes.|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|date=1 January 1973|volume=58|issue=1|pages=128–130|doi=10.1037/h0035424}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been found that individuals who perceive a strong connection between their effort and reward are evaluated more highly and in turn have higher work satisfaction.&lt;ref name=effort&gt;{{cite journal|last=SCHNEIDER|first=BENJAMIN|author2=OLSONS, LOREN K.|title=EFFORT AS A CORRELATE OF ORGANIZATIONAL REWARD SYSTEM AND INDIVIDUAL VALUES|journal=Personnel Psychology|date=1 September 1970|volume=23|issue=3|pages=313–326|doi=10.1111/j.1744-6570.1970.tb01659.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feedback===
[[Feedback#Social sciences|Feedback]] has been defined as any response from the environment that helps to influence future actions, information that follows task performance, or information from others in the social world, whether it be approval or disapproval.&lt;ref name=dictionary /&gt;&lt;ref name=Dictionary2&gt;{{cite book|last=Cardwell|first=Mike|title=Dictionary of psychology|year=1999|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers|location=London|isbn=1579580645}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A positive feedback culture is one in which individuals not only receive and solicit feedback for job performance improvement, but also use both formal and informal feedback as means to accomplish performance goals.&lt;ref name=Feedback&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gregory|first=Jane Brodie|author2=Levy, Paul E.|title=It's not me, it's you: A multilevel examination of variables that impact employee coaching relationships.|journal=Consulting Psychology Journal: Practice and Research|date=1 January 2011|volume=63|issue=2|pages=67–88|doi=10.1037/a0024152}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Such an environment is created by an employee's direct supervisors and includes the quality and frequency of
coaching and informal feedback delivery.&lt;ref name=Feedback /&gt; Research has found publicly offering employees negative feedback may decrease positive affect and willingness to show organizational citizenship behaviors, and doing so, also increases tendencies to engage in more destructive forms of work behavior &lt;ref name=Feedback2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Belschak|first=Frank D. |author2=Den Hartog, Deanne N.|title=Consequences of Positive and Negative Feedback: The Impact on Emotions and Extra-Role Behaviors|journal=Applied Psychology|date=1 April 2009|volume=58|issue=2|pages=274–303|doi=10.1111/j.1464-0597.2008.00336.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20431">'''Persuasive technology''' is broadly defined as [[technology]] that is designed to change attitudes or behaviors of the users through [[persuasion]] and [[social influence]], but not through [[coercion]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fogg2002|Fogg 2002]]&lt;/ref&gt; Such technologies are regularly used in [[sales]], [[diplomacy]], [[politics]], [[religion]], [[military|military training]], [[public health]], and [[management]], and may potentially be used in any area of human-human or human-computer interaction. Most self-identified persuasive technology research focuses on interactive, computational technologies, including desktop computers, Internet services, video games, and mobile devices,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Oinas-Kukkonen2008|Oinas-Kukkonen et al. 2008]]&lt;/ref&gt; but this incorporates and builds on the results, theories, and methods of [[experimental psychology]], [[rhetoric]],&lt;ref name="Bogost 2007"&gt;[[#Bogost2007|Bogost 2007]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[human-computer interaction]]. The design of persuasive technologies can be seen as a particular case of design with intent.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lockton2010|Lockton et al. 2010]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomies==

===''Functional Triad''===
Persuasive technologies can be categorized by their functional roles. [[B. J. Fogg]] proposes the ''Functional Triad'' as a classification of three "basic ways that people view or respond to computing technologies": persuasive technologies can function as tools, media, or social actors – or as more than one at once.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fogg1998|Fogg 1998]]&lt;/ref&gt;

* As ''tools'', technologies can increase people's ability to perform a target behavior by making it easier or restructuring it.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fogg2002|Fogg 2002, ch. 3]]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an [[Wizard (software)|installation wizard]] can influence task completion – including completing tasks (such as installation of additional software) not planned by users.
* As ''media'', interactive technologies can use both interactivity and narrative to create persuasive experiences that support rehearsing a behavior, empathizing, or exploring causal relationships.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fogg2002|Fogg 2002, ch. 4]]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, simulations and games instantiate rules and procedures that express a point of view and can shape behavior and persuade; these use ''procedural rhetoric''.&lt;ref name="Bogost 2007"/&gt;
* Technologies can also function as ''social actors''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reeves1996|Reeves &amp; Nass 1996]], [[#Turkle1984|Turkle 1984]]&lt;/ref&gt; This "opens the door for computers to apply ... social influence".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fogg2002|Fogg 2002, p. 90]]&lt;/ref&gt; Interactive technologies can cue social responses, e.g., through their use of language, assumption of established social roles, or physical presence. For example, computers can use [[embodied conversational agent]]s as part of their interface. Or a helpful or [[self-disclosure|disclosive]] computer can cause users to mindlessly [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocate]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fogg1997b|Fogg 1997b]], [[#Moon2000|Moon 2000]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Direct interaction v. mediation===
Persuasive technologies can also be categorized by whether they change attitude and behaviors through direct interaction or through a mediating role:&lt;ref&gt;[[#Oinas-Kukkonen_Harjumaa2008|Oinas-Kukkonen &amp; Harjumaa 2008]]&lt;/ref&gt; do they persuade, for example, through [[human-computer interaction]] (HCI) or [[computer-mediated communication]] (CMC)? The examples already mentioned are the former, but there are many of the latter. Communication technologies can persuade or amplify the persuasion of others by transforming the social interaction,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Licklider1968|Licklider 1968]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bailenson2004|Bailenson et al. 2004]]&lt;/ref&gt; providing shared feedback on interaction,&lt;ref&gt;[[#DiMicco2004|DiMicco 2004]]&lt;/ref&gt; or restructuring communication processes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Winograd1986|Winograd 1986]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persuasion design===
Persuasion design is the design of messages by analyzing and evaluating their content, using established psychological research theories and methods. Andrew Chak&lt;ref&gt;[[#Chak2003|Chak 2003]]&lt;/ref&gt; argues that the most persuasive web sites focus on making users feel comfortable about making decisions and helping them act on those decisions.

===Persuasion by social motivators===
Previous research has also utilized on social motivators like competition for persuasion. By connecting a user with other users,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de Oliveira|first=Rodrigo|last2=Cherubini|first2=Mauro|last3=Oliver|first3=Nuria|date=2010-01-01|title=MoviPill: Improving Medication Compliance for Elders Using a Mobile Persuasive Social Game|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1864349.1864371|journal=Proceedings of the 12th ACM International Conference on Ubiquitous Computing|series=UbiComp '10|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=251–260|doi=10.1145/1864349.1864371|isbn=9781605588438}}&lt;/ref&gt; his/her coworkers,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thieme|first=Anja|last2=Comber|first2=Rob|last3=Miebach|first3=Julia|last4=Weeden|first4=Jack|last5=Kraemer|first5=Nicole|last6=Lawson|first6=Shaun|last7=Olivier|first7=Patrick|date=2012-01-01|title="We'Ve Bin Watching You": Designing for Reflection and Social Persuasion to Promote Sustainable Lifestyles|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2207676.2208394|journal=Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|series=CHI '12|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=2337–2346|doi=10.1145/2207676.2208394|isbn=9781450310154}}&lt;/ref&gt; friends and families,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caraban|first=Ana|last2=Ferreira|first2=Maria José|last3=Gouveia|first3=Rúben|last4=Karapanos|first4=Evangelos|date=2015-01-01|title=Social Toothbrush: Fostering Family Nudging Around Tooth Brushing Habits|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2800835.2809438|journal=Adjunct Proceedings of the 2015 ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing and Proceedings of the 2015 ACM International Symposium on Wearable Computers|series=UbiComp/ISWC'15 Adjunct|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=649–653|doi=10.1145/2800835.2809438|isbn=9781450335751}}&lt;/ref&gt; a persuasive application can apply social motivators on the user to promote behavior changes. Social media such as Facebook, Twitter also facilitate the development of such systems. It has been demonstrated that social impact can result in greater behavior changes than the case where the user is isolated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chiu|first=Meng-Chieh|last2=Chang|first2=Shih-Ping|last3=Chang|first3=Yu-Chen|last4=Chu|first4=Hao-Hua|last5=Chen|first5=Cheryl Chia-Hui|last6=Hsiao|first6=Fei-Hsiu|last7=Ko|first7=Ju-Chun|date=2009-01-01|title=Playful Bottle: A Mobile Social Persuasion System to Motivate Healthy Water Intake|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1620545.1620574|journal=Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Ubiquitous Computing|series=UbiComp '09|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=185–194|doi=10.1145/1620545.1620574|isbn=9781605584317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Persuasive strategies ==
Halko and &amp;nbsp;Kientz&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Halko|first=Sajanee|last2=Kientz|first2=Julie A.|date=2010-06-07|title=Personality and Persuasive Technology: An Exploratory Study on Health-Promoting Mobile Applications|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-13226-1_16|journal=Persuasive Technology|language=en|publisher=Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg|pages=150–161|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-13226-1_16}}&lt;/ref&gt; made an extensive search in the literature for persuasive strategies and methods used in the field of psychology to modify health-related behaviours. Their search concluded that there are 8 main types of persuasive strategies, which can be grouped into the following four categories, where each category has two complementary approaches:

=== 1 – Instruction style ===

'''Authoritative''': Persuade the technology user through an authoritative agent. For example, a strict personal trainer who instructing the user to perform the task that will meet their goal.

'''Non-Authoritative''': Persuade the user through a neutral agent, For example, a friend who encourage the user to meet their goals.

=== 2 – Social feedback ===

'''Cooperative''': Persuade the user through the notion of cooperating and teamwork. For example, allowing the user to team up with friends to complete their goals.

'''Competitive''': Persuade the user through the notion of competing. For example, users can play against friends or peers and be motivated to achieve their goal by winning the competition.

=== 3 – Motivation type ===

'''Extrinsic''': Persuade the user through external motivators. For example, &amp;nbsp;winning trophies, as a reward for completing a task.

'''Intrinsic''': Persuade the user through internal motivators. &amp;nbsp;For example, The good feeling a user would have for being healthy, or for achieving the goal.

=== 4 –&amp;nbsp;Reinforcement type ===

'''Negative Reinforcement:''' Persuade the user by removing an aversive stimulus. For example, turns a brown and dying nature scene green and healthy as the user conducts more healthy behaviors.

'''Positive Reinforcement:''' Persuade the user by adding a positive stimulus. For example, &amp;nbsp;adding flowers, butterflies, and other nice-looking elements to any empty nature scene, as the user conducts more healthy behaviors.

More recently, Lieto and &amp;nbsp;Vernero&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lieto|first=Antonio|last2=Vernero|first2=Fabiana|date=2014-12-30|title=Influencing the o thers’ minds: An experimental evaluation of the use and efficacy of fallacious-reducible arguments in web and mobile technologies|url=http://www.psychnology.org/File/PNJ12(3)/PSYCHNOLOGY_JOURNAL_12_3_LIETO.pdf|journal=PsychNology Journal|language=en|publisher=University of Padova|pages=87–105}}&lt;/ref&gt; have also shown that arguments reducible to [[Logical Fallacies]] are a class of widely adopted persuasive techniques in both web and mobile technologies.

== Reciprocal equality ==

One feature that distinguishes persuasion technology from familiar forms of persuasion is that the individual being persuaded often cannot respond in kind. This is a lack of ''reciprocal equality''. For example, when a [[conversational agent]] persuades a user using social influence strategies, the user cannot also use similar strategies on the agent.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fogg2002|Fogg, 2002]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health behavior change ==
While persuasive technologies are found in many domains, considerable recent attention has focused on behavior change in health domains. Digital [[health coaching]] is the utilization of computers as persuasive technology to augment the personal care delivered to patients, and is used in numerous medical settings.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Elton2007|Elton 2007]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous scientific studies show that online health behaviour change interventions can influence users' behaviours. Moreover, the most effective interventions are modelled on health coaching, where users are asked to set goals, educated about the consequences of their behaviour, then encouraged to track their progress toward their goals. Sophisticated systems even adapt to users who relapse by helping them get back on the bandwagon.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cugelman2011|Cugelman et al. 2011]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Promote sustainable lifestyles ==
Previous work has also shown that people are receptive to change their behaviors for sustainable lifestyles. This result has encouraged researchers to develop persuasive technologies to promote for example, green travels,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Froehlich|first=Jon|last2=Dillahunt|first2=Tawanna|last3=Klasnja|first3=Predrag|last4=Mankoff|first4=Jennifer|last5=Consolvo|first5=Sunny|last6=Harrison|first6=Beverly|last7=Landay|first7=James A.|date=2009-01-01|title=UbiGreen: Investigating a Mobile Tool for Tracking and Supporting Green Transportation Habits|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1518701.1518861|journal=Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|series=CHI '09|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=1043–1052|doi=10.1145/1518701.1518861|isbn=9781605582467}}&lt;/ref&gt; less waste,&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; etc.

One common technique is to facilitate people's awareness of benefits for performing eco-friendly behaviors. For example, a review of over twenty studies exploring the effects of feedback on electricity consumption in the home showed that the feedback on the electricity consumption pattern can typically result in a 5–12% saving.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fischer|first=Corinna|date=2008-02-01|title=Feedback on household electricity consumption: a tool for saving energy?|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12053-008-9009-7|journal=Energy Efficiency|language=en|volume=1|issue=1|pages=79–104|doi=10.1007/s12053-008-9009-7|issn=1570-646X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the environmental benefits such as CO2 savings, health benefit, cost are also often used to promote eco-friendly behaviors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Research challenges ==
Despite the promising results of existing persuasive technologies, there are three main challenges that remain present.

=== Technical challenges ===

Persuasive technologies developed relies on self-report or automated systems that monitor human behavior using sensors and pattern recognition algorithms. Several studies in the medical field have noted that self-report is subject to bias, recall errors and low adherence rates. The physical world and human behavior are both highly complex and ambiguous. Utilizing sensors and machine learning algorithms to monitor and predict human behavior remains a challenging problem, especially that most of the persuasive technologies require just-in-time intervention.

=== Difficulty in studying behavior change ===

In general, understanding behavioral changes require long-term studies. As multiple internal and external factors can influence these changes, such as personality type, age, income, willingness to change and more. For that, it becomes difficult to understand and measure the effect of persuasive technologies.

=== Ethical challenges ===
The question of manipulating feelings and desires through persuasive technology remains an open ethical debate. User-centered design guidelines should be developed encouraging ethically and morally responsible designs, and provide a reasonable balance between the pros and cons of persuasive technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=IJsselsteijn|first=Wijnand|last2=Kort|first2=Yvonne de|last3=Midden|first3=Cees|last4=Eggen|first4=Berry|last5=Hoven|first5=Elise van den|date=2006-05-18|title=Persuasive Technology for Human Well-Being: Setting the Scene|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11755494_1|journal=Persuasive Technology|language=en|publisher=Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg|pages=1–5|doi=10.1007/11755494_1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6135">'''Phrap''' is a widely used program for DNA [[sequence assembly]]. It is part of the [[Phred base calling|Phred]]-Phrap-[[Consed]] package.

== History ==

Phrap was originally developed by Prof. Phil Green for the assembly of [[cosmid]]s in large-scale cosmid shotgun sequencing within the [[Human Genome Project]]. Phrap has been widely used for many different sequence assembly projects, including bacterial genome assemblies and EST assemblies.

Phrap was written as a command line program for easy integration into automated data workflows in genome sequencing centers. For users who want to use Phrap from a graphical interface, the commercial programs [[MacVector]] (for [[Mac OS X]] only) and  [[CodonCode Aligner]] (for [[Mac OS X]] and [[Microsoft Windows]]) are available.

== Methods ==

A detailed (albeit partially outdated) description of the Phrap algorithms can be found in the [http://www.phrap.org/phredphrap/phrap.html Phrap documentation]. A recurring thread within the Phrap algorithms is the use of [[Phred quality score]]s. Phrap used quality scores to mitigate a problem that other assembly programs had struggled with at the beginning of the [[Human Genome Project]]: correctly assembling frequent imperfect repeats, in particular [[Alu sequence]]s. Phrap uses quality scores to tell if any observed differences in repeated regions are likely to be due to random ambiguities in the sequencing process, or more likely to be due to the sequences being from different copies of the Alu repeat. Typically, Phrap had no problems differentiating between the different Alu copies in a cosmid, and to correctly assemble the cosmids (or, later, [[Bacterial artificial chromosome|BACs]]). The logic is simple: a base call with a high probability of being correct should never be aligned with another high quality but different base. However, Phrap does not rule out such alignments entirely, and the cross_match alignment gap and alignment penalties used while looking for local alignments are not always optimal for typical sequencing errors and a search for overlapping (contiguous) sequences. (Affine gaps are helpful for homology searches but not usually for sequencing error alignment). Phrap attempts to classify chimeras, vector sequences and low quality end regions all in a single alignment and will sometimes make mistakes. Furthermore, Phrap has more than one round of assembly building internally and later rounds are less stringent - Greedy algorithm. 

These design choices were helpful in the 1990s when the program was originally written (at Washington University in Saint Louis, USA) but are less so now. Phrap appears error prone in comparison with newer assemblers like Euler and cannot use mate-pair information directly to guide assembly and assemble past perfect repeats. Phrap is not free software so it has not been extended and enhanced like less restricted open-source software [[Sequence assembly]].

== Quality based consensus sequences ==

Another use of [[Phred quality score]]s by Phrap that contributed to the program's success was the determination of consensus sequences using sequence qualities. In effect, Phrap automated a step that was a major bottleneck in the early phases of the [[Human Genome Project]]: to determine the correct consensus sequence at all positions where the assembled sequences had discrepant bases. This approach had been suggested by Bonfield and Staden in 1995,&lt;ref&gt;Bonfield JK, Staden R (1995): The application of numerical estimates of base calling accuracy to DNA sequencing projects. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995 Apr 25;23(8):1406-10. {{PMID|7753633}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was implemented and further optimized in Phrap. Basically, at any consensus position with discrepant bases, Phrap examines the quality scores of the aligned sequences to find the highest quality sequence. In the process, Phrap takes confirmation of local sequence by other reads into account, after considering direction and sequencing chemistry. 

The mathematics of this approach were rather simple, since [[Phred quality score]]s are logarithmically linked to error probabilities. This means that the quality scores of confirming reads can simply be added, as long as the error distributions are sufficiently independent. To satisfy this independence criterion, reads must typically be in different direction, since peak patterns that cause base calling errors are often identical when a region is sequenced several times in the same direction. 

If a consensus base is covered by both high-quality sequence and (discrepant) low-quality sequence, Phrap's selection of the higher quality sequence will in most cases be correct. Phrap then assigns the confirmed base quality to the consensus sequence base. This makes it easy to (a) find consensus regions that are not covered by high quality sequence (which will also have low quality), and (b) to quickly calculate a reasonably accurate estimate of the error rate of the consensus sequence. This information can then be used to direct finishing efforts, for example re-sequencing of problem regions.

The combination of accurate, base-specific [[Phred quality score|quality scores]] and a quality-based consensus sequence was a critical element in the success of the [[Human Genome Project]]. Phred and Phrap, and similar programs who picked up on the ideas pioneered by these two programs, enabled the assembly of large parts of the human genome (and many other genomes) at an accuracy that was substantially higher (less than 1 error in 10,000 bases) than the typical accuracy of carefully hand-edited sequences that had been submitted to the GenBank database before.&lt;ref&gt;Krawetz SA (1989): Sequence errors described in GenBank: a means to determine the accuracy of DNA sequence interpretation. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989 May 25;17(10):3951-7&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pādodaka''' ([[Sanskrit]]: पादोदक, lit. ''foot-water'') is holy water. Its prepared from bathing the [[Linga]] or [[guru]]'s feet. It is one of the [[Ashtavarana]] or the 'eight protections' of [[Lingayatism]].

This holy water is used in many sacred occasions to call upon good fortune and celestial blessing. It is sprinkled across while entering into a new house, on the newly bought vehicle etc.

== What is Space for Life ? ==
{{Advert section|date=February 2017}}

The [[Montreal Biodome]], [[Insectarium]], [[Botanical Garden]] and [[Rio Tinto Alcan Planetarium]] invite us to rethink the ties between human beings and nature, cultivating a new way of living. Together, the four prestigious institutions form a place where nature and science are honoured. They have positioned themselves as a Space for Life and are dedicated to sharing their vast heritage and knowledge with you.

Space for Life is a place that brings together the Montreal Biodome, Insectarium, Botanical Garden and Planetarium, but it is also much more. It’s a participatory movement and a commitment to biodiversity. It is a vast project based on citizen participation and co-creation with visitors. Just like nature belongs to everyone, it is everyone’s movement. It’s a state of mind, a way of experiencing nature. It is a space we visit where we can exchange, collaborate and learn.

=== The mission ===

Through its efforts in communication, conservation, education and research, Space for Life guides humans to better experience nature.

=== Space for Life is a place ===

The Space for Life comprises the Montreal Biodome,Botanical Garden, Insectarium and Rio Tinto Alcan Planetarium. The institutions are interdependent, and designed to inspire visitors to adopt a new way of experiencing nature. They are connected by the Grande Place, a space that inspires new ways of coming together, enjoying the site, playing outside, building, interacting and experiencing everyday life.

Space for Life is the largest natural science museum complex in Canada, one of the leading tourist sites in Montréal and all of Quebec and a place with immense potential to impress and thrill visitors through nature, explain nature and encourage behaviour that is respectful of nature.

=== Space for Life is a commitment ===

Space for Life is also committed to increasing awareness of our planet’s biodiversity and encouraging people to better protect it. In fact, our four institutions have created a sustainable development charter.

By offering visitors immersive experiences combining science and emotion, the Biodôme, Botanical Garden, Insectarium and Planetarium invite us all to look at nature differently.

We have a collective commitment to nature, but also a commitment to achievement, meaningfulness and mobilization.

=== Space for Life is a movement ===

With their participatory, unifying approach that is authentic, inventive, committed and open to the world, our four institutions have joined forces to create a movement, a Space for Life; a place where people come together to create, shaped by Montrealers and visitors from around the world.

Space for Life has initiated a movement that aims to help people better understand the concept of interdependence underlying biodiversity, become aware of the services provided by nature and gradually change the way they live. Our institutions invite you to join the movement, by taking an active part and spreading the message yourself.

The Space for Life is a collective initiative encouraging Montrealers and local stakeholders to become involved and make it their own.

'''A movement to get closer to nature'''
'''A participatory, creative, historic movement'''

=== Sustainable development at Space for Life ===
At Space for Life, our approach to sustainable development informs all our decisions and actions, encouraging us to consider the inextricable connections between society, ethics, the economy and the environment.

With this goal in mind, we are committed to integrating sustainable development principles in all our activities. This includes our charter of commitment and 11 areas of focus:

*Biodiversity;
*Natural and cultural heritage;
*Environmentally responsible practices;
*Waste management;
*Natural resource management;
*Sustainable transportation;
*Ecodesign;
*Information, awareness and education;
*Governance and the workplace;
*Economic activity;
*Social engagement.

==== Major project ====


Montréal Space for Life is the largest natural science museum complex in Canada. By 2019, four major projects will have been developed, creating constantly evolving and changing spaces for life.

==== As Montreal's 375th anniversary approaches ====

The Insectarium Metamorphosis, the Biodôme Migration and two other major Space for Life projects are a legacy for Montrealers, for the planet and for future generations.

At a time when the issues the planet is facing, especially those related to the loss of biodiversity, raise the question of the relevance of our modern lifestyles, Space for Life, which is rooted in these unique institutions whose reputation and credibility are recognized both locally and internationally, has a fundamental role to play.

These two projects – characterized by their uniqueness, both in terms of architecture and design and the memorable and distinctive experiences they offer visitors – will let Space for Life truly play its role by inviting citizens to reconnect with nature and invent new ways of living. Reflecting a multidisciplinary vision wherein the architectural gesture emerges from a global creative approach, a bold architectural design will create living spaces that are permeable, ecological and evolving, while meeting the highest green building standards.

==== The Insectarium’s Metamorphosis ====

===== Winning Submission =====
Kuehn Malvezzi, Pelletier De Fontenay, Jodoin Lamarre Pratte, Dupras Ledoux and NCK

===== The project =====

'''A unique experience'''

The Insectarium will become a true biotope in which insects, plants and people can interact and take an interest in one another. In an architectural space that is both a landscape and an organism, the underground and closed spaces, water, shadow and daylight follow and play off one another along a route that plunges visitors into an immersive, sensory experience in the heart of the world of insects.

===== Technical Aspects =====

*Materials encouraging the greatest proximity with the insects (water, glass)
*New immersive space (butterfly house)
*Changes in architectural and museographic scale and perspective
*Individual experience spaces (face-to-face with insects)
*Museum functional spaces (laboratories, greenhouses, breeding facilities, offices)
*Transparent openings revealing the building’s ecological workings and the support processes for the live insects

==== Biodôme Migration ====

===== The design team =====

KANVA + NEUF architect(e)s, Bouthillette Parizeau + NCK

===== The project =====

'''A renewed experience, re-thinking the deeper meaning of the ecosystems.''' 

The Migration project will revamp the Biodôme and its scenic design, in most areas accessible to the public, to offer an innovative, participatory, immersive experience. The architects compare the Biodôme to a living organism and their concept echoes notions of cellular biology. The cell, the basic building block of life, becomes a model for structuring and shaping the building blocks of nature – ecosystems. The design team is proposing to reorganize the spaces, open up the centre of the Biodôme, and offer bold, complementary experiences.

The overall project budget is $22 million. This includes professional and project management fees, studies, construction costs, restoration, acquisition and relocation of live collections, museology, furniture, various contingencies, etc.

===== Technical Aspects =====
*A curved wall wraps around each ecosystem like a sensitive, delicate skin.
*A mezzanine with a lookout and new perspectives on all the ecosystems.
*The sub-Antarctic region will be expanded and the sub-Arctic region will become more immersive.
*The scenic design in some of the habitats will be redone, for a more immersive and moving visitor experience, appealing to the senses:
*Tropical Forest: larger numbers and more visible birds, fish and invertebrates
*Laurentian Maple Forest: visitors will be closer to the animals
*Gulf of St. Lawrence: reconfigured architecture and scenic design
*New welcoming and distinctive spaces where visitors can wander freely and intuitively.
*A grandiose main lobby, opened up and reconfigured to suit the scale of the building.

'''Women as theological figures''' have played a significant role in the development of various [[religions]] and religious [[hierarchy|hierarchies]]. The study of '''[[women and religion]]''' typically examines the role of [[women]] within particular religious faiths, and religious doctrines relating to [[gender]], [[gender roles]], and particular women in [[religious history]]. It is worth noting from  a gender scientific approach, women occupy the second room in all of the following religions in the examples below. 

George H. Gallup Jr. wrote in an analysis for the Gallup Organization in 2002 that, a mountain of evidence shows that women have more religiosity than men. Gallup goes on to say that women hold on to their faith more heartily, work harder for the church, and in general practice with more consistency than men.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Roy Britt, ''Women More Religious Than Men, http://www.livescience.com/7689-women-religious-men.html, February 28, 2009'' October 27, 2014 (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bahá'í Faith ==
{{details|Bahá'í Faith and gender equality#Historical women figures in Bahá'í history}}

In Bahá'i writings, the [[Holy Spirit]] is often described as the "[[Maid of Heaven]]".&lt;ref name="Abdo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bahai-library.com/abdo_female_holy-spirit |title=Female Representations of the Holy Spirit in Bahá'í and Christian writings and their implications for gender roles |publisher=Bahai-library.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three women figure prominently in the history of the Bahá'í Faith: [[Táhirih]], a disciple of the [[Báb]]; [[Ásíyih Khánum]], the wife of [[Bahá'u'lláh]]; and [[Bahíyyih Khánum]] the daughter of Bahá'u'lláh. Táhirih and Bahíyyih, in particular, held strong leadership positions and are seen vital to the development of the religion.

Several women played leading roles in the early days of the Bahá'í Faith in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetbahai.org/cgi-bin/articles.pl?article=93 |title=Women in the Baha'i Faith |publisher=Planetbahai.org |date= |accessdate=2010-11-19}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bahai-library.com/mazal_comparison_christianity_bahai&amp;chapter=2 |title=Selected Topics of Comparison in Christianity and the Baha'i Faith |publisher=Bahai-library.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bahai-library.com/finch_unclipping_wings |title=Unclipping the Wings |publisher=Bahai-library.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among them are: [[May Maxwell]], [http://bahai-library.com/maneck_women_bahai_faith Corinne True], and [[Martha Root]].  [[Rúhíyyih Khanum]] and a mix of male and female [[Hands of the Cause]] formed an interim leadership of the religion for six years prior to the formation of the [[Universal House of Justice]]. Later prominent women include [http://www.bahai.us/node/80 Patricia Locke], [http://www.creativefilms.com/Pos.html Jaqueline Left Hand Bull Delahunt], [[Layli Miller-Muro]], and [http://bahai-library.com/maneck_women_bahai_faith Dr. Susan Maneck], who herself wrote books documenting the role of women in the Bahá'í Faith.
