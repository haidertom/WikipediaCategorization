Bromley]]{{sfn|Bromley|2012|p=14}} }}

The '''academic study of new religious movements''' is known as '''new religions studies'''' ('''NRS''').{{sfnm|1a1=Bromley|1y=2004|1p=83|2a1=Bromley|2y=2012|2p=13}}
The study draws from the disciplines of [[anthropology]], [[psychiatry]], [[history]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[religious studies]], and [[theology]].&lt;ref name="Teaching bromley"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2007|title=Disciplinary Perspectives on New Religious Movements: Views of from the Humanities and Social Sciences|encyclopedia=Teaching New Religious Movements|url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195177299.001.0001/acprof-9780195177299-chapter-3|accessdate=2014-03-17|date=|author=Sablia, John A.|edition=|pages=41–63|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195177299.001.0001|editor=David G. Brohmley}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eileen Barker]] noted that there five sources of information on [[new religious movements]] (NRMs): the information provided by such groups themselves, that provided by ex-members as well as the friends and relatives of members, organisations that collect information on NRMs, the mainstream media, and academics studying such phenomena.{{sfn|Barker|1989|pp=vii-ix}}

The study of new religions is unified by its topic of interest, rather than by its [[methodology]], and is therefore [[interdisciplinary]] in nature.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2004|1p=8|2a1=Melton|2y=2004b|2p=16}} A sizeable body of scholarly literature on new religions has been published, most of it produced by [[social science|social scientists]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bromley|1y=2012|1p=13|2a1=Hammer|2a2=Rothstein|2y=2012|2p=2}} Among the disciplines that NRS uses are anthropology, history, psychology, religious studies, and sociology.{{sfn|Bromley|2012|p=13}} Of these approaches, sociology played a particularly prominent role in the development of the field,{{sfn|Bromley|2012|p=13}} resulting in it being initially confined largely to a narrow array of sociological questions.{{sfn|Hammer|Rothstein|2012|p=5}} This came to change in later scholarship, which began to apply theories and methods initially developed for examining more mainstream religions to the study of new ones.{{sfn|Hammer|Rothstein|2012|p=5}}

The majority of research has been directed toward those new religions which have attracted a greater deal of public controversy; less controversial NRMs have tended to be the subject of less scholarly research.{{sfn|Melton|2004b|p=20}} It has also been noted that scholars of new religions have often avoided researching certain movements which tend instead to be studied by scholars from other backgrounds; the [[feminist spirituality]] movement is usually examined by scholars of [[women's studies]], African-American new religions by scholars of [[Africana studies]], and Native American new religions by scholars of [[Native American studies]].{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=8}}

==Historical development==
{{double image|right|Massimo Introvigne.jpg|208|Eileen Barker.jpg|140|Scholarly organisations devoted to the study of NRMs have been formed by academics like Massimo Introvigne (left) and Eileen Barker (right)}}

In Japan, the academic study of new religions appeared in the years following the Second World War.{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=3}}&lt;ref name="Gallagher, Eugene V 2007"&gt;Gallagher, Eugene V. 2007. "Compared to What? 'Cults' and 'New Religious Movements.'" History of Religions 47(2/3): 212.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s American sociologist [[John Lofland (sociologist)|John Lofland]] lived with Unification Church [[missionary]] [[Young Oon Kim]] and a small group of American church members in California and studied their activities in trying to promote their beliefs and win new members. Lofland noted that most of their efforts were ineffective and that most of the people who joined did so because of personal relationships with other members, often family relationships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/conversion.htm Conversion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121122133/http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/conversion.htm |date=2012-01-21 }}, [http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/Unification.htm Unification Church] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113080905/http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/Unification.htm |date=2012-01-13 }}, ''Encyclopedia of Religion and Society'', Hartford Institute for Religion Research, [[Hartford Seminary]]&lt;/ref&gt; Lofland published his findings in 1964 as a doctoral thesis entitled: 'The World Savers: A Field Study of Cult Processes', and in 1966 in book form by [[Prentice-Hall]] as ''[[Doomsday Cult: A Study of Conversion, Proselytization, and Maintenance of Faith]]''. It is considered to be one of the most important and widely cited studies of the process of [[religious conversion]], as well as one of the first sociological studies of a new religious movement.&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America: African diaspora traditions and other American innovations'', Volume 5 of Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America, W.

In Western nations the study of new religions became a distinct field in the 1970s;{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=4}} prior to this, new religions had been examined from varying perspectives, with [[Pentecostalism]] for instance being studied by [[church history|church historians]] and [[cargo cults]] by anthropologists.{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=4}} This Western  academic study of new religions emerged in response to growing public concerns regarding the emergence of various NRMs during the 1970s.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2004|1p=3|2a1=Melton|2y=2004b|2p=17}} By the latter part of that decade, increasing numbers of papers on new religions were being presented at the annual conferences of the [[American Academy of Religion]], [[Society for the Scientific Study of Religion]], and the [[Association for the Sociology of Religion]].{{sfn|Melton|2004b|p=20}} The manner in which the scholarly study of new religions rose to prominence due to the public perception that these movements were social threats bore similarities with the manner in which [[Islamic studies]] grew in Western nations following the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001.{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=8}} The study of new religions would only be fully embraced by the Western [[religious studies]] establishment in the 1990s.{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=4}}

In 1988, the charity [[INFORM]] (Information Network Focus on Religious Movements) was established by Barker, who was then a professor of sociology at the [[London School of Economics]]. The organisation was supported by the UK Home Office and the British established churches and was designed to conduct research and disseminate accurate information about new religions.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|pp=105–106}}
Barker established INFORM due to her "conviction that a great deal of unnecessary suffering has resulted from ignorance of the nature and characteristics of the current wave of [NRMs] in the West."{{sfn|Barker|1989|p=vii}}
Also in 1988, the Italian scholar [[Massimo Introvigne]] established [[CESNUR]] (Centre for Studies on New Religions) in [[Turin]]; it brought together academics studying NRMs in both Europe and North America.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|pp=106–107}} In the United States, CESNUR gained representation through the [[Institute for the Study of American Religion]] in [[Santa Barbara, California]], which was directed by [[J. Gordon Melton]].{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=107}}

Scholars of new religion often operate in a politicised environment given that their research can be cited in legal briefs and judicial decisions regarding NRMs.{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=6}} In Barker's view, academic research into NRMs had practical applications in dealing with the problems that people experience with regard to NRMs.{{sfn|Barker|1989|pp=x–xi}} It can, for example, provide accurate information about a particular religious movement that can help guide an individual's reactions to the group; "an awareness of the complexity of a situation might help people to avoid precipitous actions that would later have been regretted."{{sfn|Barker|1989|p=xi}} However, given that scholars of new religions often reject the stereotypes about "cults" promoted by the anti-cultist movements, they have often been criticised by proponents of the latter.{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=6}} Anti-cult groups have sometimes criticised scholarly groups such as these, claiming that they uncritically believe what NRMs tell them, that they are pro-NRM, or that they ignore the issues raised by ex-members.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=109}} They sometimes have accused academic researchers of being "[[cult apologists]]".{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2004|1p=7|2a1=Melton|2y=2004b|2p=21}}

The '''Agriculture and Forestry University''' ('''AFU''') is a public agricultural university with central offices in [[Rampur, Chitwan]], [[Nepal]]. Organized in a manner similar to [[Agricultural Universities (India)|agricultural universities]] in India, it is the only such university in Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.afu.edu.np/about-us&lt;/ref&gt; 

It was created by the [[Parliament of Nepal]], which passed a bill in June 2010 merging two constituent campuses of [[Tribhuvan University]]: the Rampur Agriculture Campus of the [[Institute of Agriculture and Animal Science]] and the Forestry Campus, Hetauda of the Institute of Forestry in [[Hetauda, Makawanpur]]. The university exists to offer agricultural [[workforce development]] and promote research in agriculture, forestry, and allied disciplines. Through teaching, research, and extension programs in agriculture, livestock, and forestry, it aims to raise the socio-economic conditions of rural people.

==Academics==
The university has inherited undergraduate, graduate and PhD programs in agricultural sciences of Rampur Campus and undergraduate program in forestry of Hetauda Campus. The Rampur Campus offers undergraduate degrees including a four-year B.Sc. Ag, five-year B.V.Sc. and A.H, four-year B.Sc Fisheries, two-year Master programs in Agriculture, Animal Science, Veterinary Science and Aquaculture, and Ph.D. programs. 

In addition to its Bachelor of Forestry degree program, the Hetauda Forestry campus offers a Master of Forestry degree and PhD. 

The university has 140 faculty members located at the Rampur Agriculture Campus and 55 at the Hetauda Forestry Campus. The university strength consists of around 800 undergraduate students, 200 postgraduate students and around 50 Ph.D. scholars in disciplines of agriculture and forestry. The Rampur academic complex extends in an area of {{convert|280|ha|acre}} and the Hetauda Campus has an area of {{convert|95|ha|acre}}.

The faculty members focus their research work on increasing production and productivity of agricultural commodities, post-harvest technology, improving the shelf-life of food products, conserving biodiversity, and enhancing livelihood systems and innovation capacities of farming communities. The postgraduate students are contributing thesis research to generate knowledge and technologies to address the issues of agriculture and forestry in the nation.

==History==
Agriculture and Forestry University (AFU) was established as a result of a bill enacted by the Nepalese Parliament in June 2010 authorizing the creation of three new universities at campuses owned by [[Tribhuvan University]]. The Rampur Agriculture Campus, associated with the [[Institute of Agriculture and Animal Science]], and the Forestry Campus, Hetauda, associated with the [[Institute of Forestry]], were designated as campuses for the new university. As of February 2015, [[Tribhuvan University]] has refused to transfer ownership of the campuses to the new university, citing its autonomy from the Nepalese legislature, and the existing Rampur Agriculture Campus has yet to vacate its administrative offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1-last= Thapa |author1-first= Chitranga  |author2-last= Poudel |author2-first= Motilal |author3-last= Khatiwada |author3-first= Bimal |title=New ones struggle to get by |date=10 February 2015 |newspaper=Kathmandu Post |url=http://www.ekantipur.com/2015/02/10/development/new-ones-struggle-to-get-by/401518.html |accessdate=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, in 2015, the first AFU affiliated college was established in Puranchaur V.D.C. of Kaski district with the name College Of Natural Resource Management. This college is currently operating with Bachelors level of Agriculture faculty.

Total 50 students were enrolled as the first batch of the college.

==Campuses==
*Agriculture Campus, Rampur, Chitwan
*Forestry Campus, Hetauda, Makawanpur
*College of Natural Resource Management, Puranchaur, Kaski
The University Complex of AFU and its Central Office, including the offices of the Vice Chancellor and Registrar, are on the Rampur campus.

'''Applied Scholastics''' is a [[non-profit]] corporation founded in 1972 to promote the use of study techniques created by [[L. Ron Hubbard]], the founder of the [[Church of Scientology]].  Hubbard called his theories on learning and education "[[study technology]]." Applied Scholastics runs the "Hollywood Education and Literacy Project" (HELP),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helplearn.org/index-flash.html Hollywood Education and Literacy Project&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061207202503/http://www.helplearn.org/index-flash.html |date=2006-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[World Literacy Crusade]], "Education Alive", and the "Literacy, Education and Abilities Program" (LEAP).

Applied Scholastics' declared mission is: "to promote and develop programs of effective education for educators, business trainers, tutors, parents, children and people in all walks of life who need improved study skills to enhance their scholastic, business and personal activities."

Applied Scholastics is sponsored by the [[Church of Scientology]].&lt;ref name="times2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tighe|first1=Mark|title=Scientologists target schoolchildren|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/ireland/scientologists-target-schoolchildren-m0sv2xgk3|website=The Times|accessdate=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studytech.org/asi.php |title=Scientology's Education Fronts - Applied Scholastics International |year=2007 |publisher=''studytech.org'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514032959/http://www.studytech.org/asi.php |archivedate=2008-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Study Tech==
{{Main|Study Tech}}
Study Tech is a teaching methodology developed by [[L. Ron Hubbard]].

Hubbard's theories on education describe three "barriers to learning". The first is the absence of mass, pertaining to the lack of a physical object relating to a concept. The second is a steep study "gradient", meaning a necessary previous step was skipped to master a skill. The third is the "misunderstood word", which necessitates looking up unclear words in the dictionary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Texts highlight scientology's role in education. |journal=Education Week |last=Walsh |first=Mark |issn=0277-4232 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=2015-12-01 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Students are taught that "misunderstood words" are a major cause of confusion and misunderstanding. They are taught to use dictionaries extensively. Emphasis is also put on making sure children are taught at a "gradient", so that a subject's crucial elementary concepts come before more difficult concepts. "Mass" is described as a measure of mental tangibility that students ascribe to a subject, so that students have a picture in their mind of the thing they are learning about.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

Applied Scholastics licenses [[Study Tech]] to a number of schools throughout the world. In return, these schools pay 4% of their [[gross income]] to Applied Scholastics.&lt;ref name="License Agreement"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040715154510/http://www.able.org/pages/grp_forms/aps_lic_agr.pdf ABLE license contract for the use of Applied Scholastics trademarks] ([[PDF]] format. Archived March 18, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and controversy==
In 1992, [[Applied Materials]] settled a lawsuit for an estimated $600,000. The lawsuit claimed that the three former employees who filed the lawsuit had been driven out of the company because they had complained about the seminars Applied Scholastics had been contracted to teach there. Applied Scholastics said regarding the case, "In ten years of business, we've never had anything come up like this." &lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;{{Cite news

In 1998, the group submitted five of its books for approval as supplemental classroom texts to the [[California Department of Education]]. The review board found no religious content to object to, although they did object to the lack of portrayals of disabled persons and people of color. The Southern California [[American Civil Liberties Union]], however, objected on the basis that the books used many of the terms and concepts that the Church of Scientology uses elsewhere in its [[Study Tech]].&lt;ref name=Free&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Szalanski|first=Andrea |title= 'Clearing' Johnny to read |journal=[[Free Inquiry]]|volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=12 |id= |url= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]], Applied Scholastics convinced the principal of Prescott Middle School in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]] to implement a program of Study Tech.&lt;ref name=door/&gt; Critics worried that the move was "an insidious plan ultimately aimed at promoting Scientology."&lt;ref name=door&gt;{{cite news | first = Robert | last = Farley | title = Scientology makes it in classroom door | url = http://www.sptimes.com/2007/05/20/Worldandnation/Scientology_makes_it_.shtml | publisher = [[St. Petersburg Times]] | date = 2007-05-20 | accessdate = 2008-11-02| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080919141137/http://www.sptimes.com/2007/05/20/Worldandnation/Scientology_makes_it_.shtml| archivedate= 19 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Prescott's principal and two education experts claimed that they "saw [no] hidden Scientology agenda or proselytizing in the text."&lt;ref name="door" /&gt; The school's principal felt that the program was worthwhile.&lt;ref name="door" /&gt; In October 2005, [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] Public Schools superintendent Creg Williams discovered the group's Scientology connections and immediately advised area principals to cease working with Applied Scholastics. Additionally, CEO Bennetta Slaughter falsely claimed a "partnership" with the Hazelwood School District in St. Louis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Kristen | last = Hinman | title = L Is for L.

Some parents were upset when Applied Scholastics methods were introduced in September 2008 at Bambolino [[Montessori method|Montessori]] Academy, a private school in [[Toronto]]. The owner/principal and dean of the school are both Scientologists but they say that Applied Scholastics is secular and that they do not teach Scientology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2008/09/18/bambolino-school.html|title=Scientology link at Montessori school alarms parents|date=2009-09-18|publisher=CBC News|accessdate=2008-09-19| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080923044223/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2008/09/18/bambolino-school.html| archivedate= 23 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, a charter{{clarify|date=August 2017}} school group in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] came under criticism for using tools provided by Applied Scholastics.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/2013/03/27/174441623/peter-o-dowd-tk&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Baltic 21''' is a plan to cooperate on implementing regional sustainable development. It is managed by the [[Council of the Baltic Sea States]] (CBSS).{{r|hist}}

The mission of Baltic 21 is to contribute towards advancing sustainable development in the Baltic Sea Region by coordinating goals and activities, and by serving as a forum for cooperation across borders and between stakeholder groups.

==History==
Initiated by the [[Prime Minister]]s of the [[Baltic Sea]] countries in 1996, '''Baltic 21''' is a regional expression of the global [[Agenda 21]] adopted by the [[United Nations]] “[[Earth Summit]].”&lt;ref name=hist&gt;http://www.cbss.org/sustainable-prosperous-region/egsd-baltic-2030-2/&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, the CBSS updated the plan in accordance with UN's ''[[Sustainable Development Goals|Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development]]''. The CBSS Expert Group on Sustainable Development created the '''Baltic 2030 Action Plan''', specifically tailored for the BSR to guide macro-regional stakeholders through the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The senior adviser was Krista Kampus.{{r|hist}}&lt;ref&gt;http://www.balticseafuture.org/-/media/files/balticseafuture/krista-kampus.ashx&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2017, a presentation of the work involved to archive the targets was given in [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seit.ee/file_dl.php?file_id=550&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation==
As a multinational team, members of Baltic 21 are government ministries and agencies from the 11 Baltic Sea states, the [[European Commission]], numerous intergovernmental and non-governmental organisations, academic and financial institutions, as well as local, city and business networks. The Baltic 21 network brings together people who are active in sectors including [[agriculture]], [[education]], [[energy]], [[fisheries]], [[forests]], [[industry]], [[tourism]], [[transport]] and [[spatial planning]].

The Baltic 21 process is steered, coordinated and monitored by the Senior Officials Group (SOG) consisting of representatives of the member countries, organizations and institutions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3000">[[File:Eagleheaded demon.jpg|thumb|right|An Eagle headed protective spirit holding the bucket and cone, next to a stylized tree]]
'''''Bucket and Cone''''' refer to twin attributes that are frequently held in the hands of [[winged genie]]s depicted in [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Neo-Assyrian]] art and especially [[Assyrian palace reliefs]] - sometimes, however, only the bucket is held, and the other hand is held up in what may be a [[blessing]] gesture. These objects are often displayed in association with a stylised tree, before floral decorations, guardian figures, the king and / or his attendants and open doorways or portals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chronofus.net/inanna/concepts.htm |title=Sumerian Concepts}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cone was apparently held up in the right hand, the bucket held hanging downwards in the left hand of the figure, which is almost always that of a winged genie or an animal-headed [[demon]] or [[monster]] (though not necessarily with the same negative connotations) - only very occasionally might these attributes be borne by a fully human figure.

As to the identity of the twin objects, the "cone" is generally recognised as a pine or fir cone ([[pinus brutia]]); alternative identifications suggest the male flower of the [[date palm]], or as a clay model imitating the form of one or the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bibleorigins.net/ezekielscherubim.html |title=Ezekiel's Cherubim and Ancient Near Eastern Exemplars (9th-6th centuries B.C.) |author=Walter Reinhold Warttig Mattfeld y de la Torre |work=Bible Origins |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bucket was presumably either of metal or [[basketry]] and is thought to have held either water or pollen or both.

Although explanatory texts regarding these objects are exceedingly rare, it does seem likely that they were together employed in [[Ritual purification|rituals of purification]], as revealed by their [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] names: banddudû ("bucket") and mullilu ("purifier").&lt;ref name=Collins&gt;{{cite book |title=Assyrian Reliefs from the palace of Ashurnasirpal|last=Collins|first=Paul |year=2010 |chapter=Attending the King and Eternity|isbn=978-1-58465-817-7 |pages=184 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this case the fir cone would be dipped in the bucket of water before being shaken in order to ritually purify a person or object.&lt;ref name=atac /&gt; Alternatively the close association of the objects with depictions of stylised trees has led to the suggestion that it depicts fertilisation.&lt;ref name=atac /&gt; In this case the pollen from the male flower of the date palm would be being shaken onto the tree.&lt;ref name=atac&gt;{{cite book |title=Assyrian Reliefs from the palace of Ashurnasirpal|last=Ataç|first= Mehmet-Ali |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2010 |chapter=Time and Eternity|isbn=978-1-58465-817-7 |page=167 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology''' (CEH) is the [[United Kingdom]]'s Centre of Excellence for integrated research in [[hydrology]], terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems and their interaction with the atmosphere. As part of the [[Natural Environment Research Council]] (NERC), it provides services based on innovative, independent and interdisciplinary science and long-term environmental monitoring, forming an integral part of NERC's strategy.

The Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology is one of four environmental research organisations wholly owned by NERC, along with the [[British Geological Survey]], the [[British Antarctic Survey]] and the [[National Oceanography Centre]]. The single organisation CEH was established in 2000 from the combination of four existing NERC research centres. &lt;ref name="peer.eu1" /&gt;

The Centre operates from four sites across the UK: [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire|Wallingford]] (headquarters), [[Edinburgh]], [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] (jointly with the [[Lancaster Environment Centre]]) and [[Bangor, Wales|Bangor]] (jointly with [[Bangor University]]).

The current director is Mark J. Bailey.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=How CEH operates |url=http://www.ceh.ac.uk/science/operate.html |publisher=[[Natural Environment Research Council]] |work=Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology website |accessdate=18 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319192933/http://ceh.ac.uk/science/operate.html |archivedate=19 March 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Past directors include [[Pat Nuttall]] (2001–11).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author= |title=Professor Mark Bailey becomes acting Director of the Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology |url=http://www.ceh.ac.uk/news/news_archive/acting-director-ceh_2011_07.html |date=1 March 2011 |publisher=[[Natural Environment Research Council]] |work=Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology website |accessdate=16 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140723165002/http://ceh.ac.uk/news/news_archive/acting-director-ceh_2011_07.html |archivedate=23 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CEH is a member of the [[Partnership for European Environmental Research (PEER)]].&lt;ref name="peer.eu1" /&gt;

==History==
CEH was formed in April 2000 by a merger of four institutions: the Institute of Hydrology, the '''Institute of Terrestrial Ecology''', the Institute of Freshwater Ecology and the Institute of Virology and Environmental Microbiology&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author= |title=Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology timeline |url=http://www.ceh.ac.uk/sites/default/files/CEH%20timeline.pdf  |publisher=Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology |work=Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology website |accessdate=27 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4076">'''Community-based conservation''' is a [[conservation movement]] that emerged in the 1980s through escalating protests and subsequent dialogue with local communities affected by international attempts to protect the [[biodiversity]] of the earth. Older conservation movements disregarded the interests of local inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;Brockington, D. (2002) Fortress Conservation: The Preservation of the Mkomazi Game Reserve, Tanzania. International African Institute, Oxford( {{ISBN|0-253-34079-9}})&lt;/ref&gt; This stems from the [[Western culture|Western]] idea on which the conservation movement was founded, of [[nature]] being separate from [[culture]]. The object of community-based conservation is to incorporate improvement to the lives of local people while conserving areas through the creation of national parks or wildlife refuges.&lt;ref&gt;Gezon, Lisa. (1997) Institutional structure and the effectiveness of integrated conservation and development projects: case study from Madagascar, Human Organization 56(4), pp. 462–470 (ISSN 0093-2930)&lt;/ref&gt;  While there have been some notable successes, unfortunately community-based conservation has often been ineffective because of inadequate resources, uneven implementation, and over-wishful planning.  Some critics have also complained about often unintended [[neocolonialism|neocolonialist]] undertones involved in the particular conservation projects.

==History==
The first protected areas around the world such as Yosemite in 1864 and Yellowstone National Park in 1872 were founded by the colonial or classical conservation method.&lt;ref&gt;Cholchester, M. (2004) Conservation Policy and Indigenous Peoples. Environmental Science &amp; Policy 7(3), pp.145-153&lt;/ref&gt; Classical conservation created protected areas to protect wilderness and wildlife areas of pristine wilderness that was untouched and uninhabited by humans. All people inhabiting these areas were removed from the land and displaced onto marginal land surrounding or near by the newly protected land. It is estimated that 20 million people were displaced from their land.&lt;ref&gt;Veit, P. G., Benson, C. (2004) When Parks and People Collide. Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs. 16 Oct. 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This conservation strategy was used widely until the 1970s when indigenous people started to fight for their rights and land. In 1975 the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the World Parks Congress recognized the rights of indigenous people and to recognize their rights of the protected areas.&lt;ref&gt;Cholchester, M. (2004) Conservation Policy and Indigenous Peoples. Environmental Science &amp; Policy 7(3), pp.145-153&lt;/ref&gt; More policy changes came about that increased the rights of indigenous people. Community-based conservation came into action from these changes.

==Strategies==
One strategy of community-based conservation is co-management or joint management of a protected area. Co-management combines local peoples’ traditional knowledge of the environment with modern scientific knowledge of scientists.&lt;ref&gt;WPC Recommendation 25 Co-management of Protected Areas, World Parks Congress (2003) {{cite web |url=http://www.cceia.org/resources/publications/dialogue/2_11/section_2/4449.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927164214/http://www.cceia.org/resources/publications/dialogue/2_11/section_2/4449.html |archivedate=2006-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Child, B.;Jones, B. (2006), Practical tools for community conservation in southern Africa, Participatory Learning and Action 55 (ISSN 1357-938X)&lt;/ref&gt; This combination of knowledge can lead to increased biodiversity and better management of the protected area.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17137">The '''conservation and restoration of clocks''' refers to the care given to a clock to either prevent or resolve issues faced during its life cycle. The variety of materials from which a clock may be constructed and the complexity of [[clockwork]] warrant such care to be taken by a clock owner so that a clock can continue to function.

== Preventive conservation ==
Proper handling, suitable storage and display environments, and regular maintenance can together prevent issues from arising and impacting a clock’s sustainability. Such controls can extend the life of a clock.

=== Handling ===
Certain precautionary measures taken by a clock handler can deny opportunities for damage to occur:
[[File:Pendulum_removed_from_clockwork.jpg|thumb|right|150x300px|Pendulum removed from clockwork.]]
* Loose items worn by a handler have the potential to come into contact with and cause damage to a clock. Removal of these items prior to clock handling can lower the risk of damage. 
* Wearing “[...] cotton or rubber gloves when handling the metal portions of the clock” &lt;ref name=Fahey&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fahey|first1=Mary M.|title=The Care and Preservation of Clocks|url=http://www.thehenryford.org/research/caring/clocks.aspx|website=Benson Ford Research Center|publisher=The Henry Ford|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; can limit opportunities for transfer of contaminants from hands to clock surfaces. 
* [[Pendulum]] damage during clock movement can be prevented by either removing the pendulum or fixing it within the interior of the clock via a latch or padding prior to clock movement.&lt;ref name=Fahey /&gt; This can also prevent damage to other interior components.
* A clock "[...] should always be grasped at its most sturdy area" &lt;ref name=Fahey /&gt; and moved from one location to the next on its back. 
* The correlation of the size of a clock with the number of people moving it can ensure the safety of the clock. A small, mantle clock for example may only require one mover, while a tall clock can necessitate a number of movers to safely carry it to another location.

=== Storage and display ===
Proper storage and display mechanisms can work to ensure a clock’s safety. The use of a solid, sturdy surface when storing or displaying a clock can prevent it from falling on a hard surface. A wall clock for example requires a secure attachment "[...] to a wall if accidents are to be avoided and clocks are to run properly.” &lt;ref name=ICON&gt;{{cite web|title=Care and Conservation of Clocks|url=http://www.conservationregister.com/PIcon-CareClocks.asp|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|website=Conservation Register|publisher=The Institute of Conservation|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motion sensitive lighting and use of non-direct light sources can limit the amount of light and heat withstood by a clock, both of which are sources of clock damage. A clean clock environment can eliminate opportunities for dangerous contaminants to come into contact with a clock. An [[HVAC]] system can add an extra level of security by removing such contaminants from the air.

==== Humidity and temperature levels ====
The [[humidity]] and [[temperature]] of the environment in which a clock is being displayed or stored can adversely affect the clock’s condition. Damage may be avoided by maintaining certain levels of humidity and temperature within the clock environment, dependent on the materials from which the clock is constructed.
:a. '''Wood clocks'''
:The ideal humidity and temperature ranges for clocks whose cases are made from wood vary depending on the season. In the summer, an environment with a temperature of 70 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit and 40% to 60% [[relative humidity]] is suitable.&lt;ref name=Fahey /&gt; During the winter, an environment with a temperature of 70 degrees Fahrenheit and 35% to 50% relative humidity is prime.&lt;ref name=Fahey /&gt;
:b. '''Metal clocks'''
:Clocks whose cases are made from metal function well in an environment with a temperature of 68 degrees Fahrenheit and a relative humidity of 30%.&lt;ref name=Fahey /&gt;

=== Maintenance ===
Regular maintenance of a clock can ensure its long-term preservation.

==== Condition checks ====
Visual inspection can determine whether a clock should be cleaned and/or lubricated, whether any signs of infestation and/or damage exist, and whether a clock should be wound and/or set to the correct time. 
:a. '''Cleaning, polishing, and lubrication'''
:Regular clock surface dusting can negate opportunities for corrosion or abrasion as a result of dust buildup. It should be stated that such surface cleaning can also result in a loss of information about a clock’s history, as “[...] various “dirt” or “salt” deposits can provide precious clues to an objects past [...].” &lt;ref name=Moss&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moss|first1=James|title=Concerns regarding the Conservation of Functional Horological Objects|url= http://cool.conservation-us.org/byauth//moss/concerns.html|website=Conservation OnLine|publisher=Foundation of the American Institute for Conservation|accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dust and other contaminants can also cause clockwork wear, as “the abrasive particle will become imbedded into the bearing wall and act as a piece of “sandpaper [...].” &lt;ref name=Moss /&gt; Regular clockwork activities can also lead to wear, as lubricants are known to degrade over time. Loss of clock function due to clockwork wear can be avoided through regular clockwork cleaning, polishing, and lubrication performed by a trained professional. In performing such maintenance, a professional will disassemble clockwork so that it can be thoroughly examined “[...] for worn or broken parts, fatigued springs and accumulations of dirt or oil.” &lt;ref name=Fahey /&gt; 
:b. '''Winding and setting'''
:In order to function as time keepers, and to prevent damage to clockwork, clocks must be regularly wound. An established winding schedule eliminates the threat of over-winding. Regular winding can also ensure that clockwork is still functioning. In setting the correct time, the minute hand is turned clockwise to the desired time.

== Typical types of damage ==
Damage can occur via a variety of mechanisms, either rooted in human error or naturally caused.

=== Human interaction ===

:a. '''Mishandling'''
:The failure of a handler to remove loose items from their person can result in these items striking a clock’s surface. A handler who uses his or her bare hands to touch or transport a clock exposes the clock to contaminants, leaving “unsightly and potentially damaging marks.” &lt;ref name=ICON /&gt; A handler who chooses to drag rather than lift a clock “[...] can place stress on the legs and feet of the clock.” &lt;ref name=Fahey /&gt; Lifting a clock via false handles or non-sturdy components may cause these parts to snap off of the clock, potentially leading to the clock falling and smashing on a surface.
:b. '''Over-winding or improper hand setting'''
:Improper clock winding and hand setting procedures can cause serious damage to clockwork components. The use of an inappropriate key to wind a clock is one such improper procedure. The manner in which a clock is wound is also important, as “[...] considerable and potentially expensive damage can be caused by not winding gently and steadily”,&lt;ref name=ICON /&gt; as well as by turning the key one too many times. 
:In terms of improper hand setting, manually moving the hour or seconds hand rather than the minute hand in an attempt to set the time can be damaging, as can be counterclockwise hand turning.&lt;ref name=ICON /&gt; Moving the minute hand ahead on a clock by several hours when setting the time can also lead to clockwork damage. For this reason, “Rather than turning the hands forward through several hours it is better to stop the clock and re-start it when the time matches that on the dial.” &lt;ref name=ICON /&gt; 
:c. '''Unsuitable storage or display''' 
:Unsuitable storage and display environments pose great risks to a clock’s condition. Placement of a clock on an unstable surface or non secure mounting on a wall can cause a clock to fall when external vibrations or human caused accidents occur.
:d. '''Improper cleaning and polishing'''
:Many cleaners and polishers contain properties that “[...] have been proven to age poorly.” &lt;ref name=Fahey /&gt; Resultantly, the use of such cleaners and polishers can prove detrimental. The use of ammonia based cleaning products for example on brass clock components can lead to an irreversible form of damage called [[Stress Corrosion Cracking]].&lt;ref name=Moss /&gt; Depending on the type of metal on which it is used, a metallic brush employed to apply cleaning products not only can create the proper conditions for corrosion, but can “[...] remove any protective oxide layers even with careful use.” &lt;ref name=Moss /&gt; 
:e. '''Improper lubrication'''
:Attempts by non-professionals to lubricate or repair clockwork can lead to serious damage and loss of clock functionality. A lubricant applied without first cleaning and polishing clockwork to remove the previous lubricant and contaminants can result in wear rather than prevent it.&lt;ref name=Moss /&gt; The combination of the newly applied lubricant with the previous lubricant often results in “[...] an unwanted chemical reaction between the two lubricants [...].” &lt;ref name=Moss /&gt; A careless lubricant choice can result in the use of inappropriate or "Poor-quality oil" on clockwork, which "can become sticky leading to mechanical problems." &lt;ref name=Fahey /&gt; The inexperience of a non-professional can also lead to “the use of too much oil, or oil in the wrong place” &lt;ref name=ICON /&gt; during attempts to lubricate clockwork. The application of too much of a lubricant can be damaging because it “[...] usually causes the lubrication to run out of the bearing and by capillary action will cause the bearing to go dry.” &lt;ref name=Moss /&gt; Totally ignoring the lubrication needs of clockwork can be jeopardizing not only because of lubricant degradation, but because of the acidic nature of the organic lubricants often used in antique clocks.&lt;ref name=Moss /&gt;

=== Natural causes ===

:a. '''Humidity and temperature'''
:The amount of water in the air and temperature of a given environment can play a direct role in clock deterioration. “[...] extremes in temperature and humidity” &lt;ref name=Fahey /&gt; can cause drastic changes in the materials from which a clock is made, inevitably leading to damage. Placement of a clock for example near "a heat source of any kind, including strong sunlight or a mantel over a working fire [...] can cause damage to cases and movements." &lt;ref name=ICON /&gt; 
:b. '''Pests'''
:Clocks are as susceptible to pest damage as any other object constructed from organic materials. Pests that are known to infest clocks are attracted to the organic materials from which a clock may be constructed:
:* '''[[Carpet beetle (disambiguation)|Carpet beetle]]'''&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt;- Attracted to protein-based adhesives sometimes used in clock construction, and as such “[...] are generally found at joinery and inside clock cases.” &lt;ref name=Fahey /&gt;
:* '''[[Powderpost beetle]]'''- Lured by any wood materials from which a clock is constructed, they are known to drill holes into wood.&lt;ref name=Fahey /&gt;
:c. '''Light'''
:Over-exposure to light can impact clock materials in a number of ways. Heat from a light source can cause the varnish or finish on a clock surface to melt, resulting in a sticky surface to which harmful contaminants can become attached.&lt;ref name=Fahey /&gt; Too much light exposure can also result in changes to finish color, as well as cause finish deterioration “[...] resulting in a cracked, brittle and/or “alligatored” appearance.” &lt;ref name=Fahey /&gt;
:d. '''Contaminants'''
[[File:Dust_buildup_on_a_clock_case.jpg|thumb|right|Dust buildup on top of a clock case.]]
:Contaminants themselves vary and come into contact with a clock by way of various means. The following are two such examples:  
:* '''Dust''' is one such contaminant which settles on a clock’s surface. If not addressed, dust buildup can lead to abrasion and corrosion. 
:* '''Oil''' is transferred to a clock surface when a clock is handled with bare hands. The presence of oil on a clock can cause damage, particularly corrosion when metal clock components are touched.

=== Types of clock damage ===
Damage can impact all components and materials from which a clock may be constructed.

==== Wood damage ====
Due to its porous nature, wood is significantly impacted through contact with water. When humidity is high, the excess water in the air is absorbed, resulting in wood expansion, while little to no water in the air when humidity is low can cause wood shrinkage.&lt;ref name=Fahey /&gt; Such changes in character from the wood’s original state can lead to damage. Types of low humidity-related wood damage include “[...] structural cracks, lifting veneer and inlays, gaps in joints and the embrittlement of adhesives." &lt;ref name=Fahey /&gt;

==== Metal damage ====
Similar to wood, interaction with water can also prove detrimental to metal. When contaminants come into contact with metal, they either combine with any present moisture or attract moisture to the metal. This “[...] combination with moisture can produce corrosion.” &lt;ref name=Fahey /&gt;

==== Finish or paint damage ====
Finish damage can occur as a result of the use of cleaning products and/or polishes on a clock’s surface. Rather than perform their intended duty to assist in the preservation of a clock, some products “can actually darken or become opaque with age, resulting in a dark, dull and often irreparable finish.” &lt;ref name=Fahey /&gt; Any words or images painted on a clock surface can become faded or even removed when these delicate pieces are touched and exposed to moisture from hands.

==== Interior or clockwork damage ====
Clockwork damage can be inflicted via over-winding, interaction with contaminants, ill-advised lubrication, and clock movement when a pendulum is not secured prior to the clock being moved. A free swinging pendulum can itself be damaged and can inflict damage onto other interior components during such clock movement.

== Conservation and restoration ==
Interventive actions can be taken by trained conservators when clock issues arise, with treatment varying depending on the type of clock and situation.

=== Conservators ===

A [[Conservator-restorer|conservator]] who specializes in clock care will have the qualifications and training to properly treat a clock with the wherewithal to “[...] not totally compromise the historical worth of the object [...].” &lt;ref name=Moss /&gt; Conservators rely on a system of examination, documentation, and research prior to treatment so that proper treatment is received, as “Sometimes the only way one can understand the detailed history, quirks, and specific eccentricities common to a particular timepiece is by studying it to glean as much information from it as possible [...].” &lt;ref name=NAWCC&gt;{{cite web|title=Horological Conservation|url= http://www.nawcc.org/index.php/member-resources/horological-conservation&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|website=NAWCC|publisher=National Association of Watch and Clock Collectors|accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from pinpointing clock issues and providing care to a clock in need, conservators are also able to impart knowledge about procedures like clock winding to ill-informed clock owners so that future clock damage due to human error may be avoided.

=== Example: Anglesey Abbey Pagoda Clock ===
[[Horological]] conservators at West Dean College were responsible for the treatment of an 18th-century pagoda clock sent from the historic house [[Anglesey Abbey]] by the [[National Trust]]. In starting the project, examination of the clock revealed that "The automata and clock elements seem to be running, but struggling, and the music sounds as though it needs a few extra hands to help play its tune." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cox|first1=Brittany N.|title=Anglesey Abbey’s Pagoda Clock|url=http://westdeanconservation.com/2012/06/05/anglesey-abbeys-pagoda-clock/|date=5 June 2012|website=Current Projects|publisher=West Dean Conservation|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clock was then disassembled, and care was taken to document information about each of the over 600 components both textually and photographically, including measurements and where each component fits within the clock. "After examination, each component was cleaned and dried, wrapped in acid-free tissue, and stored with the catalogue number." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cox|first1=Brittany N.|title=The Pagoda Part 2|url=http://westdeanconservation.com/2012/06/28/the-pagoda-part-2/|date=28 June 2012|website=Current Projects|publisher=West Dean Conservation|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:009MA Kritios.jpg|thumb|''Kritios Boy''. c. 480 BCE, was the first known statue to use ''contrapposto''.]]
'''''Contrapposto''''' ({{IPA-it|kontrapˈposto}}) is an [[Italian language|Italian]] term that means counterpoise.  It is used in the [[visual arts]] to describe a human figure standing with most of its weight on one foot so that its shoulders and arms twist off-axis from the hips and legs. This gives the figure a more dynamic, or alternatively relaxed appearance.  It can also be used to refer to multiple figures which are in counter-pose (or opposite pose) to one another.  It can further encompass the tension as a figure changes from resting on a given leg to walking or running upon it (so-called ''ponderation''). The leg that carries the weight of the body is known as the ''engaged'' leg, the relaxed leg is known as the ''free'' leg.&lt;ref name=Janson&gt;[[H. W. Janson|Janson, H.W.]] (1995) ''History of Art''. 5th edn. Revised and expanded by Anthony F. Janson. London: [[Thames &amp; Hudson]], p. 139. {{ISBN|0500237018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrapposto is less emphasized than the more sinuous [[S Curve (art)|S Curve]], and creates the illusion of past and future movement.&lt;ref&gt;"Contrapposto". Grove Encyclopedia Of Materials &amp; Techniques In Art: 142–143. October 2008. {{ISBN|9780195313918}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrapposto was an extremely important sculptural development, for its appearance marks the first time in Western art that the human body is used to express a psychological disposition. The balanced, harmonious pose of the [[Kritios Boy]] suggests a calm and relaxed state of mind, an evenness of temperament that is part of the ideal of man represented. 
[[File:Etruscan Statuette.jpeg|thumb|[[Etruscan art|Etruscan]] statuette, from Italy, 3rd to 1st century BCE, bronze]]
From this point onwards Greek sculptors went on to explore how the body could convey the whole range of human experience, culminating in the desperate anguish and pathos of ''[[Laocoön and His Sons]]'' (1st century CE)  in the Hellenistic period.

==History==

===Classical===
The first known statue to use contrapposto is [[Kritios Boy]], c. 480 BC,&lt;ref name=HF&gt;[[Hugh Honour|Honour, H.]] and J. Fleming, (2009) ''A World History of Art''. 7th edn. London: Laurence King Publishing, p. 122. {{ISBN|9781856695848}}&lt;/ref&gt; so called because it was once attributed to the sculptor [[Kritios]]. It is possible, even likely, that earlier bronze statues had used the technique, but if they did, they have not survived and [[Kenneth Clark]] called the statue "the first beautiful nude in art".&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;Clark, Kenneth. (2010) ''The Nude: A study in ideal form''. New edition. London: [[The Folio Society]], pp. 24-25.&lt;/ref&gt; The statue is a Greek marble original and not a Roman copy.
 
Prior to the introduction of contrapposto, the statues that dominated ancient Greece were the [[Archaic Greece|archaic]] [[kouros]] (male) and the [[Kore (sculpture)|kore]] (female). Contrapposto has been used since the dawn of classical western sculpture. According to the ''canon'' of the Classical Greek [[Sculpture|Sculptor]] [[Polykleitos]] in the 4th century BC, it is one of the most important characteristics of his figurative works and those of his successors, [[Lysippos]], [[Skopas]], etc. The Polykletian statues – for example, [[Discophoros]] (''discus-bearer'') and [[Doryphoros]] (''spear-bearer'') – are idealized athletic young men with the divine sense, and captured in contrapposto. In these works, the pelvis is no longer [[Axial skeleton|axial]] with the [[Kouros|vertical statue as in the archaic style]] of earlier Greek sculpture before ''Kritios Boy''.

Contrapposto can be clearly seen in the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] copies of the statues of [[Hermes]] and [[Heracles]]. A famous example is [[Hermes and the Infant Dionysus|the marble statue]] of Hermes with the infant [[Dionysus]] in [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] by [[Praxiteles]]. It can also be seen in the Roman copies of Polyclitus's [[amazons|Amazon]].

Greek Art emphasized humanism along with the human mind and the human body’s beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Greek Humanism|url = http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/engl257/Ancient/greek_humanism.htm|website = www.webpages.uidaho.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greek youths trained and competed in athletic contests in the nude. A great contribution to the contrapposto pose was the concept of a canon of proportions, in which mathematical properties are used to create proportions.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley, Max (2010). "The 'Golden Canon' of book-page construction: proving the proportions geometrically". Journal of Mathematics &amp; The Arts. 4 no. 3: 137–141.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance===
Classical contrapposto was revived in the [[Renaissance]] by the Italian artists [[Donatello]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]], followed by [[Michelangelo]], [[Raphael]] and other artists of the [[High Renaissance]]. One of the major achievements of the [[Italian Renaissance]] was the re-discovery of contrapposto, although in [[Mannerism]] it became greatly over-used.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

===Modern times===
The technique continues to be widely employed in sculpture.

A '''dead hedge''' is a barrier constructed from cut branches, [[sapling]]s, and [[foliage]]. The material can be from pruning, clearing, or forestry activities. Their succession is a [[beetle bank]] or [[hedge]]. 

==Restoration ecology and biological pest control== 
Dead hedges or wind-rows, as they are known in the coppice trade, are useful keeping the compartments of the coppice tidy, keeping the public from certain areas, being an excellent habitat and corridor for wildlife [[habitat conservation]] and [[restoration ecology]], as they offer shelter for small animals, especially birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://handbooks.btcv.org.uk/handbooks/content/chapter/65 |title=Hedging |work=BTCV handbook |author=[[BTCV]] |accessdate=2008-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be part of a beneficial "biological pest agents" [[habitat]] in [[biological pest control]] programs for [[natural landscape]]s and [[organic gardening]].

==Agriculture==
Dead hedges usually provide an enclosure for the storage of livestock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northwichcommunitywoodlands.org.uk/events-hedgelaying.shtml |accessdate=2008-01-20 |work=Northwich Community Woodlands |title=Hedge-laying - alive and well in the Northwich Community Woodlands |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110021455/http://www.northwichcommunitywoodlands.org.uk/events-hedgelaying.shtml |archivedate=November 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The above biological pest control dead hedges use is also part of [[organic farming]] and [[sustainable agriculture]].

Dead hedges also recycle-reuse [[biomass]] without energy use to transport to landfills, or by burning, reducing a [[carbon footprint]] impact.

{{Anti-consumerism |Theories}}

'''Degrowth''' (&lt;!--originally a French term--&gt;{{lang-fr|décroissance}}) is a political, economic, and social movement based on [[ecological economics]], [[Anti-consumerism|anti-consumerist]] and [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] ideas.&lt;ref name=gd01/&gt;  It is also considered an essential economic strategy responding to the [[The Limits to Growth|limits-to-growth]] dilemma (see ''[[The Path to Degrowth in Overdeveloped Countries]]'' and [[post-growth]]). Degrowth thinkers and activists advocate for the downscaling of [[Production (economics)|production]] and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]]—the contraction of [[Economy|economies]]—arguing that [[overconsumption]] lies at the root of long term [[environmental issue]]s and [[Social inequality|social inequalities]]. Key to the concept of degrowth is that reducing consumption does not require individual [[Martyr|martyring]] or a decrease in [[well-being]].&lt;ref name="Zehner 2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Zehner|first=Ozzie|title=Green Illusions|year=2012|publisher=U. Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln &amp; London|isbn=0803237758|pages=178–183, 339–342|url=http://GreenIllusions.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, "degrowthers" aim to maximize happiness and well-being through non-consumptive means—sharing work, consuming less, while devoting more time to art, music, family, nature, culture and community.

==Background==
The movement arose from concerns over the perceived
consequences of the [[productivism]] and [[consumerism]]
associated with industrial societies (whether
[[Capitalism|capitalist]] or [[Socialism|socialist]]) including:&lt;ref name=fd01/&gt;
* The reduced availability of energy sources (see [[peak oil]])
* The declining quality of the environment (see [[global warming]], [[pollution]], [[Biodiversity#Threats|threats to biodiversity]])
* The decline in the health of flora and fauna upon which humans depend (see [[Holocene extinction]])
* The rise of negative societal side-effects (see un[[sustainable development]], poorer [[health]], [[poverty]])
* The ever-expanding use of resources by [[First World]] countries to satisfy lifestyles that consume more food and energy, and produce greater waste, at the expense of the [[Third World]] (see [[neocolonialism]])

===Resource depletion===
{{Main article|Resource depletion}}
As economies grow, the need for resources grows accordingly (unless there are changes in efficiency or demand for different products due to price changes). There is a fixed supply of non-renewable resources, such as [[petroleum]] (oil), and these resources will inevitably be depleted. Renewable resources can also be depleted if extracted at unsustainable rates over extended periods. For example, this has occurred with [[caviar]] production in the Caspian Sea.&lt;ref&gt;Bardi, U. (2008) 'Peak Caviar'. The Oil Drum: Europe. http://europe.theoildrum.com/node/4367&lt;/ref&gt; There is much concern as to how growing demand for these resources will be met as supplies decrease. Many organizations and governments look to energy technologies such as biofuels, solar cells, and wind turbines to meet the demand gap after peak oil. Others have argued that none of the alternatives could effectively replace versatility and portability of oil.&lt;ref&gt;McGreal, R. 2005. 'Bridging the Gap: Alternatives to Petroleum (Peak Oil Part II)'. Raising the Hammer. http://www.raisethehammer.org/index.asp?id=119&lt;/ref&gt; Authors of the book ''Techno-Fix'' criticize technological optimists for overlooking the limitations of technology in solving agricultural and social challenges arising from growth.&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011). [http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org  ''Technofix: Why Technology Won’t Save Us or the Environment''], New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, British Columbia, Canada, {{ISBN|0865717044}}, 464 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of degrowth argue that decreasing demand is the only way of permanently closing the demand gap. For renewable resources, demand, and therefore production, must also be brought down to levels that prevent depletion and are environmentally healthy. Moving toward a society that is not dependent on oil is seen as essential to avoiding [[societal collapse]] when non-renewable resources are depleted.&lt;ref&gt;Resilience.org. (October 20, 2009). Peak Oil Reports. http://www.resilience.org/stories/2009-10-20/peak-oil-reports-oct-20&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecological footprint===
{{Main article|Ecological footprint}}

The ecological footprint is a measure of human demand on the Earth's ecosystems. It compares human demand with planet Earth's ecological capacity to regenerate. It represents the amount of biologically productive land and sea area needed to regenerate the resources a human 
population consumes and to absorb and render harmless the corresponding [[waste]].
According to a 2005 [[Global Footprint Network]] report,&lt;ref name=footprintnetwork&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/GFN/page/data_sources/|title=Data Sources|work=footprintnetwork.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001074513/http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/GFN/page/data_sources/|archivedate=2009-10-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; inhabitants of high-income countries live off of 6.4 [[global hectare]]s (gHa), while those from low-income countries live off of a single gHa. For example, while each inhabitant of 
[[Bangladesh]] lives off of what they produce from 0.56 gHa, a [[North America]]n requires 12.5 gHa. Each inhabitant of North America uses 22.3 times as much land as a Bangladeshi. According to the same report, the average number of global hectares per person was 2.1, 
while current consumption levels have reached 2.7 hectares per person. In order for the world's population to attain the living standards typical of European countries, the resources of between three and eight planet [[Earth]]s would be required with current levels of efficiency and means of production. In order for world [[economic equality]] to be achieved with the current available resources, proponents say rich countries would have to reduce their [[standard of living]] through degrowth. The constraints on resources would eventually lead to a forced reduction in consumption. Controlled reduction of consumption would 
reduce the trauma of this change assuming no [[technological change]]s increase the planet's [[carrying capacity]].

=== Degrowth and sustainable development&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Farewell to Growth|last=Latouche|first=Serge|publisher=Polity Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-7456-4616-9|location=Cambridge|pages=9-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===
Degrowth thought is in opposition to all forms of [[productivism]] (the belief that economic productivity and growth is the purpose of human organization).  It is, thus, opposed to the current form of [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://degrowth.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Lorek-_Fuchs-2013.pdf|title=Strong sustainable consumption governance - precondition for a degrowth path?}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the concern for 
[[sustainability]] does not contradict degrowth, sustainable development is rooted in mainstream [[international development|development]] ideas that aim to increase capitalist growth and consumption. Degrowth therefore sees sustainable development as an [[oxymoron]],&lt;ref name=Latouche/&gt; as any development based on growth in a finite and environmentally stressed world is seen as inherently unsustainable. 
Critics of degrowth argue that a slowing of [[economic growth]] would result in increased [[unemployment]], increase [[poverty]] and decrease income per capita. Many who understand the devastating environmental consequences of growth still advocate for economic growth in the South, even if not in the North. But, a slowing of economic growth would fail to deliver the benefits of degrowth—self-sufficiency, material responsibility—and would indeed lead to decreased 
employment. Rather, degrowth proponents advocate for a complete abandonment of the current (growth) economic system, suggesting that relocalizing and abandoning the global economy in the [[Global South]] would allow people of the South to become more self-sufficient and would end the overconsumption and exploitation of Southern resources by the North.&lt;ref name=Latouche&gt;Latouche, S. (2004).&gt;[https://mondediplo.com/2004/11/14latouche Degrowth Economics: Why less should be so much more.] ''Le Monde 
Diplomatique''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==="The rebound effect"===
{{Main article|Rebound effect (conservation)}}
Technologies designed to reduce resource use and improve efficiency are often touted as sustainable or green solutions. Degrowth literature, however, warns about these technological advances due to the "[[Rebound effect (conservation)|rebound effect]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zehner|first=Ozzie|title=Green Illusions|year=2012|publisher=U. Neb. Pr.|location=Lincoln|pages=172–73, 333–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This concept is based on observations that when a less resource-exhaustive technology is introduced, [[Jevons paradox|behaviour surrounding the use of that technology may change]], and consumption of that technology could increase or even offset any potential resource savings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Binswanger |first=M. |year=2001 |title=Technological Progress and Sustainable Development: What About the Rebound Effect? |journal=Ecological Economics |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=119–32 |doi=10.1016/S0921-8009(00)00214-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In light of the rebound effect, proponents of degrowth hold that the only effective 'sustainable' solutions must involve a complete rejection of the growth paradigm and a move toward a degrowth paradigm. There are also fundamental limits to technological solutions in the pursuit of degrowth, as all engagements with technology increase the cumulutive matter-energy throughput.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heikkurinen|first=Pasi|title=Degrowth by means of technology? A treatise for an ethos of releasement|url= |journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.07.070}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the convergence of [[digital commons]] of knowledge and design with [[distributed manufacturing]] technologies may arguably hold potential for building degrowth future scenarios.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Kostakis |first1=Vasilis |last2=Latoufis |first2=Kostas |last3=Liarokapis |first3=Minas |last4=Bauwens |first4=Michel |title=The convergence of digital commons with local manufacturing from a degrowth perspective: Two illustrative cases|url= |journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.09.077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the movement==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2013}}
The contemporary degrowth movement can trace its roots back to the anti-industrialist trends of the 19th century, developed in Great Britain by [[John Ruskin]], [[William Morris]] and the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] (1819–1900), in the United States by [[Henry David Thoreau]] (1817–1862), and in Russia by [[Leo Tolstoy]] (1828–1910).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of "degrowth" proper appeared during the 1970s, proposed by [[André Gorz]] (1972) and intellectuals such as [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]], [[Jean Baudrillard]], [[Edward Goldsmith]] and [[Ivan Illich]], whose ideas reflect those of earlier thinkers, such as the economist [[E. J. Mishan]],&lt;ref&gt;Mishan, Ezra J., ''The Costs of Economic Growth'', Staples Press, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; the industrial historian [[L. T. C. Rolt|Tom Rolt]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Rolt|first=L. T. C.|title=High Horse Riderless|year=1947|publisher=George Allen &amp; Unwin|page=171|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/HIGH-HORSE-RIDERLESS-L-T-C-Rolt/dp/B0006ARC3W/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the radical socialist [[Turner Controversy|Tony Turner]]. The writings of [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and [[J. C. Kumarappa]] also contain similar philosophies, particularly regarding his support of [[Simple living|voluntary simplicity]].

More generally, degrowth movements draw on the values of [[humanism]], [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]], [[anthropology]] and [[human rights]].&lt;ref&gt;D’Alisa, G., Demaria, F., Cattaneo, C.

=== Club of Rome reports ===
In 1968, the [[Club of Rome]], a [[think tank]] headquartered in [[Winterthur]], [[Switzerland]], asked researchers at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] for a report on practical solutions to problems of global concern. The report, called ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'', published in 1972, became the first important study that indicated the ecological perils of the unprecedented economic growth the world was experiencing at the time.

The reports (also known as the Meadows Reports) are not strictly the founding texts of the degrowth movement, as these reports only advise [[Steady-state economy|zero growth]], and have also been used to support the [[sustainable development]] movement. Still, they are considered the first official studies explicitly presenting economic growth as a key reason for the increase in global [[environmental issue|environmental problems]] such as pollution, shortage of raw materials, and the destruction of [[ecosystem]]s. A second report was published in 1974, and together with the first, drew considerable attention to the topic.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

=== Lasting influence of Georgescu-Roegen ===
{{Main article|Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen}}
{{See also | Steady-state economy #Declining-state economy }}

The degrowth movement recognises [[Romanian Americans|Romanian American]] [[mathematician]], [[statistician]] and [[economist]] [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]] as the main intellectual figure inspiring the movement.&lt;ref name=sl01/&gt;{{rp|13–16}} &lt;ref name=ck01/&gt;{{rp|548f}} &lt;ref name=jm01/&gt;{{rp|1742}} &lt;ref name=mb01/&gt;{{rp|xi}} &lt;ref name=gd01/&gt;{{rp|1f}} In his magnum opus on [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Magnum opus on The Entropy Law and the Economic Process|''The Entropy Law and the Economic Process'']], Georgescu-Roegen argues that economic scarcity is rooted in physical reality; that all [[natural resource]]s are irreversibly degraded when put to use in economic activity; that the [[Sustainability#Carrying capacity|carrying capacity]] of Earth—that is, Earth's capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels—is bound to decrease sometime in the future as Earth's finite stock of mineral resources is presently being extracted and put to use; and consequently, that the [[world economy]] as a whole is heading towards an inevitable future collapse.&lt;ref name=ngr01/&gt;

Georgescu-Roegen's intellectual inspiration to degrowth goes back to the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Levallois2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Levallois|first1=Clément|title=Can de-growth be considered a policy option? A historical note on Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen and the Club of Rome|journal=Ecological Economics|volume=69|issue=11|year=2010|pages=2271–2278|issn=09218009|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2010.06.020}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Georgescu-Roegen delivered a lecture at the [[University of Geneva]] in 1974, he made a lasting impression on the young and newly graduated French historian and philosopher {{ill|Jacques Grinevald|fr}}, who had earlier been introduced to [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Magnum opus on The Entropy Law and the Economic Process|Georgescu-Roegen's magnum opus]] by an academic advisor. Georgescu-Roegen and Grinevald soon made friends, and Grinevald started devoting his research to a closer study of Georgescu-Roegen's work. As a result, in 1979 Grinevald published a French translation of a selection of Georgescu-Roegen's articles entitled ''Demain la décroissance: Entropie – Écologie – Économie'' ('Tomorrow, the Decline: Entropy – Ecology – Economy').&lt;ref name=ngr03/&gt; Georgescu-Roegen, who spoke French fluently, personally approved the use of the term ''décroissance'' in the title of the French translation. The book gained influence in French intellectual and academic circles from the outset. Later, the book was expanded and republished in 1995, and once again in 2006; however, the word ''Demain'' ('Tomorrow') was removed from the title of the book in these second and third editions.&lt;ref name=jm01/&gt;{{rp|1742}}&lt;ref name=ngr03/&gt; &lt;ref name=jg01/&gt;{{rp|15f}}

By the time Grinevald suggested the term ''décroissance'' to form part of the title of the French translation of Georgescu-Roegen's work, this term had already disseminated through French intellectual circles since the early 1970s to signify a deliberate political action to downscale the economy on a permanent and voluntary basis.&lt;ref name=fd01/&gt;{{rp|195}} Simultaneously, but independently hereof, Georgescu-Roegen had criticised the ideas of ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' and [[Herman Daly]]'s [[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state economy]] in his pointed and polemical article on ''Energy and Economic Myths'', delivered as a series of lectures from 1972 and onwards at various places, but not published in print before 1975. In this article, Georgescu-Roegen stated the following view:

{{cquote | [Authors who] were set exclusively on proving the impossibility of growth ... were easily deluded by a simple, now widespread, but false [[syllogism]]: Since exponential growth in a finite world leads to disasters of all kinds, ecological salvation lies in the stationary state. ... The crucial error consists in not seeing that not only growth, but also a zero-growth state, nay, even a declining state which does not converge toward annihilation, cannot exist forever in a finite environment.&lt;ref name=ngr02/&gt;{{rp|366f}}&lt;br&gt;... [T]he important, yet unnoticed point [is] that ''the necessary conclusion of the arguments in favor of that vision'' [of a stationary state] ''is that the most desirable state is not a stationary, but a declining one.'' Undoubtedly, the current growth must cease, nay, be reversed.&lt;ref name=ngr02/&gt;{{rp|368f}} [Emphasis in original] }}

When reading this particular passage of the text, Grinevald realised that no professional economist of any orientation had ever reasoned like this before. Grinevald also realised the striking conceptual resemblance between Georgescu-Roegen's viewpoint and the French debates progressing by the time; this resemblance then transformed into the title of the French edition. Taken together, the translation of Georgescu-Roegen's work into French ''both'' fed on ''and'' gave further impetus to the concept of ''décroissance'' in the country—and everywhere else in the francophone world—thereby creating something of an intellectual feedback loop.&lt;ref name=jm01/&gt;{{rp|1742}} &lt;ref name=jg01/&gt;{{rp|15f}} &lt;ref name=fd01/&gt;{{rp|197f}}

By the 2000s, when ''décroissance'' was to be translated from French and back into English as the catchy banner for the new social movement, the original term 'decline' was now deemed inappropriate and misdirected for the purpose: 'Decline' usually refers to an unexpected, unwelcome and temporary economic [[recession]], something bad to be avoided or quickly overcome. Instead, the [[neologism]] 'degrowth' was coined to signify a deliberate political action to downscale the economy on a permanent and voluntary basis—as in the prevailing French usage of the term—something good to be welcomed and maintained, or so followers believe.&lt;ref name=ck01/&gt;{{rp|548}} &lt;ref name=jg01/&gt;{{rp|15f}} &lt;ref name=gk01/&gt;{{rp|874–876}}

When the first international degrowth conference of its kind was held in Paris in 2008, the participants bestowed a generous amount of credit and appreciation on Georgescu-Roegen and his work.&lt;ref name=ff01/&gt;{{rp|15f, 28, ''et passim''}} Further, in his [[manifesto]] on ''Petit traité de la décroissance sereine'' ('Farewell to Growth'), leading French champion of the degrowth movement [[Serge Latouche]] has credited Georgescu-Roegen as 'a main theoretical source of degrowth.'&lt;ref name=sl01/&gt;{{rp|13–16}} Likewise, Italian degrowth theorist [[Mauro Bonaiuti]] has considered Georgescu-Roegen's work to be 'one of the analytical cornerstones of the degrowth perspective.'&lt;ref name=mb01/&gt;{{rp|xi}}

=== Serge Latouche ===
[[File:Serge Latouche - Festival Economia 2012.JPG|thumb|200px|Serge Latouche]]
[[Serge Latouche]], a professor of economics at the [[University of Paris-Sud]], has noted that:

{{quote|If you try to measure the reduction in the rate of growth by taking into account damages caused to the environment and its consequences on our natural and cultural patrimony, you will generally obtain a result of zero or even negative growth. In 1991, the United States spent 115 billion dollars, or 2.1% of the [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] on the protection of the environment. The [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] increased this cost by 45 or 55 million dollars per year. [...] The [[World Resources Institute]] tried to measure the rate of the growth taking into account the punishment exerted on the [[natural capital]] of the world, with an eye towards sustainable development. For Indonesia, it found that the rate of growth between 1971 and 1984 would be reduced from 7.1 to 4% annually, and that was by taking only three variables into consideration: [[deforestation]], the reduction in the reserves of oil and natural gas, and [[soil erosion]].&lt;ref&gt;Hervé Kempf, ''L'économie à l'épreuve de l'écologie'' Hatier&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Latouche, Serge (2003) ''Decrecimiento y post-desarrollo'' El viejo topo, p.62&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Schumacher and Buddhist economics ===
[[E. F. Schumacher]]'s 1973 book ''[[Small Is Beautiful]]'' predates a unified degrowth movement, but nonetheless serves as an important basis for degrowth ideas. In this book he critiques the [[Neoliberalism|neo-liberal]] model of economic development, arguing that an increasing "standard of living", based on consumption, is absurd as a goal of economic activity and development. Instead, under what he refers to as [[Buddhist economics]], we should aim to maximize well-being while minimizing consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, E. F. (1973). Small is Beautiful: Economics as if People Mattered. New York: Perennial Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ecological and social issues ===
In January 1972 [[Edward Goldsmith]] and Robert Prescott-Allen—editors of ''[[The Ecologist]]'' journal—published ''[[A Blueprint for Survival]]'', which called for a radical programme of decentralisation and [[deindustrialization]] to prevent what the authors referred to as ''"the breakdown of society and the irreversible disruption of the life-support systems on this planet"''.

The movement has also included international conferences,&lt;ref name="MOINS12"&gt;{{fr}} « La genèse du Réseau Objection de Croissance en Suisse », Julien Cart, in ''[[Moins!]]'', journal [[Suisse romande|romand]] d'écologie politique, n°12, juillet-août 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; promoted by the network Research&amp;Degrowth (R&amp;D),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://degrowth.org/|title=Research &amp; Degrowth|accessdate=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Paris]] (2008),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://events.it-sudparis.eu/degrowthconference/|title=Décroissance économique pour la soutenabilité écologique et l'équité sociale|accessdate=16 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barcelona]] (2010),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://barcelona.degrowth.org/|title=Degrowth Conference Barcelona 2010|accessdate=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Montreal]] (2012),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://montreal.degrowth.org/|title=International Conference on Degrowth in the Americas}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Venice]] (2012),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.venezia2012.it/|title=International Degrowth Conference Venezia 2012 |accessdate=5 Dec 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leipzig]] (2014), [[Budapest]] (2016),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://degrowth.org/2015/03/26/5-international-degrowth-conference-budapest-2016/|accessdate=2018-01-31|title=5^ International Degrowth Conference in Budapest}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Malmö]] (2018).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://malmo.degrowth.org|title=Dialogues in turbulent times|website=Dialogues in turbulent times|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Barcelona Conference (2010)===
The First International Conference on Economic Degrowth for Ecological Sustainability and Social Equity of [[Paris]] (2008) was a discussion about the financial, social, cultural, demographic, environmental crisis caused by the deficiencies of [[capitalism]] and an explanation of the main principles of the degrowth.&lt;ref&gt;''Declaration of the Paris 2008 Conference''. Retrieved from: http://degrowth.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Declaration-Degrowth-Paris-2008.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Second International Conference of [[Barcelona]] on the other hand focused on specific ways to implement a degrowth society.

Concrete proposals have been developed for future political actions, including:
* Promotion of [[Local currency|local currencies]], elimination of [[fiat money]] and reforms of [[interest]]
* Transition to non-profit and small scale companies
* Increase of local commons and support of participative approaches in [[decision-making]]
* Reducing working hours and facilitation of [[volunteering|volunteer work]]
* Reusing empty housing and [[cohousing]]
* Introduction of the [[basic income]] and an income ceiling built on a maximum-minimum ratio
* Limitation of the [[exploitation of natural resources]] and preservation of the [[biodiversity]] and culture by regulations, taxes and compensations
* Minimize the [[waste]] production with education and legal instruments
* Elimination of mega infrastructures, transition from a car-based system to a more local, biking, walking-based one.
* Suppression of advertising from the public space&lt;ref&gt;2nd Conference on Economic Degrowth for Ecological Sustainability and Social Ethic. 2010. ''Degrowth Declaration Barcelona 2010'' and ''Working Groups Results''. Retrieved from: http://barcelona.degrowth.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of the real willingness of reform and the development of numerous solutions, the conference of Barcelona didn’t have a big influence on the world economic and political system. Many critiques have been made concerning the proposals, mostly about the financial aspects, and this has refrained changes to occur.&lt;ref&gt;Responsabilité, Innovation &amp; Management. 2011. ''Décroissance économique pour l’écologie, l’équité et le bien-vivre par François SCHNEIDER.'' Retrieved from http://www.openrim.org/Decroissance-economique-pour-l.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Degrowth around the world ===
Although not explicitly called Degrowth, movements using similar concepts and terminologies can be found around the world, such as Buen Vivir&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/blog/buen-vivir-philosophy-south-america-eduardo-gudynas|title=Buen vivir: the social philosophy inspiring movements in South America|last=Balch|first=Oliver|date=2013-02-04|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Latin America or Eco-Swaraj&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://degrowthcanada.wordpress.com/2015/12/28/alternatives-to-sustainable-development-buen-vivir-degrowth-and-eco-swaraj/|title="Alternatives to Sustainable Development: Buen vivir, Degrowth and Eco-Swaraj"|last=Thomson|first=Bob|date=2015-12-28|website=Degrowth / Decroissance Canada|access-date=2016-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; in India.

=== Relation to other social movements ===
The degrowth movement has a variety of relations to other social movements and alternative economic visions, which range from collaboration to partial overlap. The Konzeptwerk Neue Ökonomie (Laboratory for New Economic Ideas), which hosted the 2014 international Degrowth conference in Leipzig, has published a project entitled “Degrowth in movement(s)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.degrowth.info/en/dim/degrowth-in-movements/|title=Degrowth in movement(s)|accessdate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;” in 2017, which maps relationships with 32 other social movements and initiatives.

== Criticisms ==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2013}}

===Marxist critique===
{{See also | Steady-state economy #Capitalism without growth }}
[[Marxism|Marxists]] distinguish between two types of growth: that which is useful to mankind, and that which simply exists to increase profits for companies. Marxists consider that it is the nature and control of production that is the determinant, and not the quantity. They believe that control and a strategy for growth are the pillars that enable social and economic development. According to Jean Zin, while the justification for degrowth is valid, it is not a solution to the problem.&lt;ref&gt;''L'écologie politique à l'ère de l'information'', Ere, 2006, p. 68-69&lt;/ref&gt;
However, other Marxist writers have adopted positions close to the de-growth perspective.  For example, [[John Bellamy Foster]]&lt;ref name="The Ecological Rift"&gt;https://monthlyreview.org/press/books/pb2181/, Monthly Review Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and Fred Magdoff,&lt;ref name="Harmony and Ecological Civilization, Monthly review, Vol 44 (2), 1-9"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://monthlyreview.org/2012/06/01/harmony-and-ecological-civilization|title=Harmony and Ecological Civilization: Beyond the Capitalist Alienation of Nature|work=Monthly Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; in common with [[David Harvey]], [[Immanuel Wallerstein]], [[Paul Sweezy]] and others focus on endless [[capital accumulation]] as the basic principle and goal of capitalism.  This is the source of economic growth and, in the view of these writers, is unsustainable.  Foster and Magdoff develop Marx's own concept of the metabolic rift, something he noted in the exhaustion of soils by capitalist systems of food production, though this is not unique to capitalist systems of food production as seen in the [[Aral Sea]].

===Systems theoretical critique===
In stressing the negative rather than the positive side(s) of growth, the majority of degrowth proponents remains focused on (de-)growth, thus co-performing and further sustaining the actually criticised unsustainable growth obsession. One way out of this paradox might be in changing the reductionist vision of growth as ultimately economic concept, which proponents of both growth and degrowth commonly imply, for a broader concept of growth that allows for the observation of growth in other [[Differentiation (sociology)|function systems]] of society. A corresponding recoding of growth-obsessed or capitalist organisations has recently been proposed.&lt;ref name="Growth and function. A viral research program for next organizations, International Journal of Technology Management"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://steffenroth.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/15-12-15-growth-and-function1.pdf|last=Roth|first=Steffen|title=Growth and function.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8606">'''Editio Octava Critica Maior''' is a critical edition of the Greek New Testament produced by [[Constantin von Tischendorf]]. It was Tischendorf's eighth edition of the Greek Testament, and the most important, published between 1864 and 1894.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==Edition==
The first volume was issued in 11 parts, beginning in 1864. They were published in two volumes in 1869 and 1872. The edition was accompanied by a rich critical apparatus in which he assembled all of the variant readings that he or his predecessors had found in manuscripts, versions, and fathers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Metzger|first1=Bruce M.|authorlink1=Bruce M.

Tischendorf died before he could finish his edition, and the third volume, containing the Prolegomena, was prepared and edited by [[C. R. Gregory]] and issued in three parts (1884, 1890, 1894).&lt;ref name = Nestle/&gt;&lt;ref name = Waltz/&gt;

Tischendorf gave the evidence known in his time. He used 64 [[List of New Testament uncials|uncial manuscripts]], a single [[List of New Testament papyri|papyrus manuscript]], and a small number of [[List of New Testament minuscules|minuscule manuscripts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The number of inaccuracies is  smaller than in 20th-century manual editions.&lt;ref name = Aland/&gt;

Tischendorf did not have a detailed textual theory. In practice he had a strong preference for the readings of the manuscript of his own discovery – [[Codex Sinaiticus]]. His text is eclectic but generally the [[Alexandrian text-type|Alexandrian]]. It has also  something from the [[Western text-type]], especially when it agrees with [[Codex Bezae]].&lt;ref name = Waltz&gt;Robert Waltz, [http://pericopedeadultera.com/RECON/Tisch-App.html ''Tischendorf's Apparatus'']&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of his work Tischendorf had practically no access to [[Codex Vaticanus]], and it was published too late to alter the basic structure of Tischendorf's edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

== Influence ==

Tischendorf's ''Editio Octava'' and ''[[The New Testament in the Original Greek]]'' of [[Brooke Foss Westcott|Westcott]] and [[Fenton John Anthony Hort|Hort]] were sufficient to make the [[Textus Receptus]] obsolete for the scholarly world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

According to [[Eberhard Nestle]] the text of the eighth edition differs from the seventh edition in 3,572 places.&lt;ref name = Nestle/&gt; Nestle has accused this edition of giving weight to the evidence of [[Codex Sinaiticus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Metzger|first1=Bruce M.|authorlink1=Bruce M.

'''Electrical engineering''' is a [[Regulation and licensure in engineering|professional engineering]] discipline that generally deals with the study and application of [[electricity]], [[electronics]], and [[electromagnetism]]. This field first became an identifiable occupation in the later half of the 19th century after [[commercialization]] of the electric [[telegraph]], the [[telephone]], and [[electric power]] distribution and use. Subsequently, [[broadcasting]] and [[recording media]] made electronics part of daily life.  The invention of the [[transistor]], and later the [[integrated circuit]], brought down the cost of electronics to the point they can be used in almost any household object.

Electrical engineering has now subdivided into a wide range of subfields including [[electronics]], [[digital computers]], [[computer engineering]], [[power engineering]], [[telecommunication]]s, [[control system]]s, [[radio-frequency engineering]], [[signal processing]], [[instrumentation]], and [[microelectronics]]. Many of these subdisciplines overlap with other engineering branches, spanning a huge number of specializations such as hardware engineering, power electronics, electromagnetics &amp; waves, microwave engineering, nanotechnology, electrochemistry, renewable energies, mechatronics, electrical materials science, and much more. See [[glossary of electrical and electronics engineering]].

Electrical engineers typically hold a [[academic degree|degree]] in electrical engineering or electronic engineering.  Practicing engineers may have [[professional certification]] and be members of a [[professional body]]. Such bodies include the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) and the [[Institution of Engineering and Technology]] (IET) ''(formerly the IEE)''.

Electrical engineers work in a very wide range of industries and the skills required are likewise variable. These range from basic circuit theory to the management skills required of a [[project manager]].  The tools and equipment that an individual engineer may need are similarly variable, ranging from a simple [[voltmeter]] to a top end analyzer to sophisticated design and manufacturing software.

==History==
{{Main article|History of electrical engineering}}

[[Electricity]] has been a subject of scientific interest since at least the early [[17th century]].  [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] was a prominent early electrical scientist, and was the first to draw a clear distinction between [[magnetism]] and [[static electricity]]. He is credited with establishing the term "electricity".{{sfn|Martinsen|Grimnes|2011|p=411}} He also designed the [[versorium]]: a device that detects the presence of statically charged objects. In 1762 Swedish professor [[Johan Carl Wilcke]] invented a device later named [[electrophorus]] that produced a static electric charge. By 1800 [[Alessandro Volta]] had developed the [[voltaic pile]], a forerunner of the electric battery

===19th century===
[[File:Faraday Cochran Pickersgill.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The discoveries of [[Michael Faraday]] formed the foundation of electric motor technology]]
In the 19th century, research into the subject started to intensify. Notable developments in this century include the work of [[Georg Ohm]], who in 1827 quantified the relationship between the [[electric current]] and [[potential difference]] in a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]], of [[Michael Faraday]] (the discoverer of [[electromagnetic induction]] in 1831), and of [[James Clerk Maxwell]], who in 1873 published a unified [[Maxwell's equations|theory]] of electricity and [[magnetism]] in his treatise ''Electricity and Magnetism''.{{sfn|Lambourne|2010|p=11}}

Electrical engineering became a profession in the later 19th century.  Practitioners had created a global [[electric telegraph]] network and the first professional electrical engineering institutions were founded in the UK and USA to support the new discipline.  Although it is impossible to precisely pinpoint a first electrical engineer, [[Francis Ronalds]] stands ahead of the field, who created the first working electric telegraph system in 1816 and documented his vision of how the world could be transformed by electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sir Francis Ronalds: Father of the Electric Telegraph|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2016|isbn=978-1-78326-917-4|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|date=2016|title=Sir Francis Ronalds and the Electric Telegraph|url=|journal=Int.

Practical applications and advances in such fields created an increasing need for standardised [[units of measure]]. They led to the international standardization of the units [[volt]], [[ampere]], [[coulomb]], [[ohm]], [[farad]], and [[henry (unit)|henry]]. This was achieved at an international conference in Chicago in 1893.{{Sfn|Rosenberg|2008|p=9}} The publication of these standards formed the basis of future advances in standardisation in various industries, and in many countries, the definitions were immediately recognized in relevant legislation.{{sfn|Tunbridge|1992}}

During these years, the study of electricity was largely considered to be a subfield of [[physics]] since the early electrical technology was considered [[electromechanical]] in nature. The [[Technische Universität Darmstadt]] founded the world's first department of electrical engineering in 1882. The first electrical engineering degree program was started at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) in the physics department under Professor Charles Cross, {{Sfn|Wildes|Lindgren|1985|p=19}} though it was [[Cornell University]] to produce the world's first electrical engineering graduates in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ece.cornell.edu/ece/about/history.cfm|title=History - School of Electrical and Computer Engineering - Cornell Engineering|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first course in electrical engineering was taught in 1883 in Cornell’s [[Cornell University College of Engineering|Sibley College of Mechanical Engineering and Mechanic Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/about/upload/Cornell-Engineering-history.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until about 1885 that [[Cornell University|Cornell]] President [[Andrew Dickson White]] established the first Department of Electrical Engineering in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://president.cornell.edu/andrew-dickson-white/|title=Andrew Dickson White - Office of the President|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, [[University College London]] founded the first chair of electrical engineering in Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Electrical Engineer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TLLmAAAAMAAJ|year=1911|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Mendell P. Weinbach at [[University of Missouri]] soon followed suit by establishing the electrical engineering department in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://engineering.missouri.edu/ece/about/department-history/|title=Department History - Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, [[universities]] and [[institutes of technology]] gradually started to offer electrical engineering programs to their students all over the world.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
During these decades use of electrical engineering increased dramatically. In 1882, [[Thomas Edison]] switched on the world's first large-scale electric power network that provided 110 volts — [[direct current]] (DC) — to 59 customers on [[Manhattan Island]] in [[New York City]]. In 1884, [[Charles Algernon Parsons|Sir Charles Parsons]] invented the [[steam turbine]] allowing for more efficient electric power generation. [[Alternating current]], with its ability to transmit power more efficiently over long distances via the use of [[transformer]]s,  developed rapidly in the 1880s and 1890s with transformer designs by [[Károly Zipernowsky]], [[Ottó Bláthy]] and [[Miksa Déri]] (later called ZBD transformers), [[Lucien Gaulard]], [[John Dixon Gibbs]] and [[William Stanley, Jr.]]. Practical [[AC motor]] designs including [[induction motor]]s were independently invented by [[Galileo Ferraris]] and [[Nikola Tesla]] and further developed into a practical [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase]] form by [[Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky]] and [[Charles Eugene Lancelot Brown]].{{Sfn|Heertje|Perlman|1990|p=138}} [[Charles Steinmetz]] and [[Oliver Heaviside]] contributed to the theoretical basis of alternating current engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=f5FqsDPVQ2MC&amp;pg=PA1229&amp;dq=theoretical%20%20alternating%20current%20%20Oliver%20Heaviside#v=onepage&amp;q=theoretical%20%20alternating%20current%20%20Oliver%20Heaviside&amp;f=false|title=Companion Encyclopedia of the History and Philosophy of the Mathematical Sciences|first=I.|last=Grattan-Guinness|date=1 January 2003|publisher=JHU Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780801873973}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lew5IC5piCwC&amp;pg=PA329&amp;dq=theoretical%20%20alternating%20current%20%20Charles%20Steinmetz#v=onepage&amp;q=theoretical%20%20alternating%20current%20%20Charles%20Steinmetz&amp;f=false|title=Mathematics in Historical Context|first=Jeff|last=Suzuki|date=27 August 2009|publisher=MAA|via=Google Books|isbn=9780883855706}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spread in the use of AC set off in the United States what has been called the ''[[War of Currents]]'' between a [[George Westinghouse]] backed AC system and a Thomas Edison backed DC power system, with AC being adopted as the overall standard.{{sfn|Severs|Leise|2011|p=145}}

===More modern developments===
[[File:Guglielmo Marconi.jpg|upright|left|thumb|[[Guglielmo Marconi]] known for his pioneering work on long distance radio transmission]]
During the [[invention of radio|development of radio]], many scientists and [[inventor]]s contributed to [[radio communications|radio technology]] and electronics. The mathematical work of [[James Clerk Maxwell]] during the 1850s had shown the relationship of different forms of [[electromagnetic radiation]] including possibility of invisible airborne waves (later called "radio waves"). In his classic physics experiments of 1888, [[Heinrich Hertz]] proved Maxwell's theory by transmitting [[radio wave]]s with a [[spark-gap transmitter]], and detected them by using simple electrical devices. Other physicists experimented with these new waves and in the process developed devices for transmitting and detecting them. In 1895, [[Guglielmo Marconi]] began work on a way to adapt the known methods of transmitting and detecting these "Hertzian waves" into a purpose built commercial [[Wireless telegraphy|wireless telegraphic]] system. Early on, he sent wireless signals over a distance of one and a half miles. In December 1901, he sent wireless waves that were not affected by the curvature of the Earth. Marconi later transmitted the wireless signals across the Atlantic between Poldhu, Cornwall, and St. John's, Newfoundland, a distance of {{convert|2100|mi|km}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1909/marconi-bio.html Marconi's biography at Nobelprize.org] retrieved 21 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1897, [[Karl Ferdinand Braun]] introduced the [[cathode ray tube]] as part of an [[oscilloscope]], a crucial enabling technology for [[television|electronic television]].{{sfn|Abramson|1955|p=22}} [[John Ambrose Fleming|John Fleming]] invented the first radio tube, the [[diode]], in 1904. Two years later, [[Robert von Lieben]] and [[Lee De Forest]] independently developed the amplifier tube, called the [[triode]].{{Sfn|Huurdeman|2003|p=226}}

In 1920, [[Albert Hull]] developed the [[Cavity magnetron|magnetron]] which would eventually lead to the development of the [[microwave oven]] in 1946 by [[Percy Spencer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Albert W.

In 1941, [[Konrad Zuse]] presented the [[Z3 (computer)|Z3]], the world's first fully functional and programmable computer using electromechanical parts.  In 1943, [[Tommy Flowers]] designed and built the [[Colossus (computer)|Colossus]], the world's first fully functional, electronic, digital and programmable computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Raúl |last=Rojas |contribution=The history of Konrad Zuse's early computing machines |page=237 |editor1-first=Raúl |editor1-last=Rojas |editor2-first=Ulf |editor2-last=Hashagen |title=The First Computers—History and Architectures History of Computing |publisher=MIT Press |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-262-68137-7}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Anthony E. |last=Sale |contribution=The Colossus of Bletchley Park |pages=354–355 |editor1-first=Raúl |editor1-last=Rojas |editor2-first=Ulf |editor2-last=Hashagen |title=The First Computers—History and Architectures History of Computing |publisher=MIT Press |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-262-68137-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946, the [[ENIAC]] (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) of [[John Presper Eckert]] and [[John Mauchly]] followed, beginning the computing era. The arithmetic performance of these machines allowed engineers to develop completely new technologies and achieve new objectives, including the [[Apollo program]] which culminated in [[moon landing|landing astronauts on the Moon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The ENIAC Museum Online | url = http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~museum/guys.html | accessdate =18 January 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solid-state electronics ===
[[File:Replica-of-first-transistor.jpg|thumb|A replica of the first working transistor.]]
The invention of the [[transistor]] in late 1947 by [[William Shockley]], [[John Bardeen]], and [[Walter Brattain]] of the [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]] opened the door for more compact devices and led to the development of the [[integrated circuit]] in 1958 by [[Jack Kilby]] and independently in 1959 by [[Robert Noyce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Electronics Timeline | work = Greatest Engineering Achievements of the Twentieth Century | url = http://www.greatachievements.org/?id=3956 | accessdate =18 January 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[microprocessor]] was introduced with the [[Intel 4004]]. It began with the "[[Busicom]] Project"&lt;ref name="ieee"&gt;[[Federico Faggin]], [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4776530 The Making of the First Microprocessor], ''IEEE Solid-State Circuits Magazine'', Winter 2009, [[IEEE Xplore]]&lt;/ref&gt; as [[Masatoshi Shima]]'s three-chip [[CPU]] design in 1968,&lt;ref name=tout1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vintagecalculators.com/html/busicom_141-pf_and_intel_4004.html|title=The Busicom 141-PF calculator and the Intel 4004 microprocessor|author=Nigel Tout|accessdate=November 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ieee"/&gt; before [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]]'s [[Tadashi Sasaki (engineer)|Tadashi Sasaki]] conceived of a single-chip CPU design, which he discussed with Busicom and [[Intel]] in 1968.&lt;ref name="sasaki"&gt;{{cite web |url        = http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Oral-History:Tadashi_Sasaki |title      = Oral-History: Tadashi Sasaki |last       = Aspray |first      = William |date       = 1994-05-25 |work       = Interview #211 for the Center for the History of Electrical Engineering |publisher  = The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc. |accessdate = 2013-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Intel 4004 was then developed as a single-chip microprocessor from 1969 to 1970, led by Intel's [[Marcian Hoff]] and [[Federico Faggin]] and Busicom's Masatoshi Shima.&lt;ref name="ieee"/&gt; The microprocessor led to the development of [[microcomputer]]s and [[personal computer]]s, and the [[microcomputer revolution]].

==Subdisciplines==
Electrical engineering has many subdisciplines, the most common of which are listed below. Although there are electrical engineers who focus exclusively on one of these subdisciplines, many deal with a combination of them. Sometimes certain fields, such as electronic engineering and [[computer engineering]], are considered separate disciplines in their own right.

===Power===
{{Main article|Power engineering}}
[[File:Power pole.jpg|thumb|right|[[Utility pole|Power pole]]]]
Power engineering deals with the [[electricity generation|generation]], [[electric power transmission|transmission]], and [[electric power distribution|distribution]] of [[electricity]] as well as the design of a range of related devices.{{Sfn|Grigsby|2012}} These include [[transformer]]s, [[electric generator]]s, [[electric motor]]s, high voltage engineering, and [[power electronics]]. In many regions of the world, governments maintain an electrical network called a [[power grid]] that connects a variety of generators together with users of their energy. Users purchase electrical energy from the grid, avoiding the costly exercise of having to generate their own. Power engineers may work on the design and maintenance of the power grid as well as the power systems that connect to it.&lt;ref name="UNESCO"/&gt; Such systems are called ''on-grid'' power systems and may supply the grid with additional power, draw power from the grid, or do both. Power engineers may also work on systems that do not connect to the grid, called ''off-grid'' power systems, which in some cases are preferable to on-grid systems. The future includes Satellite controlled power systems, with feedback in real time to prevent power surges and prevent blackouts.

===Control===
{{Main article|Control engineering|Automatic control|Control theory}}
[[File:Space Shuttle Columbia launching.jpg|thumb|right|[[Control systems]] play a critical role in [[spaceflight]].]]
[[Control engineering]] focuses on the [[mathematical model|modeling]] of a diverse range of [[dynamic system]]s and the design of [[controller (control theory)|controllers]] that will cause these systems to behave in the desired manner.{{sfn|Bissell|1996|p=17}} To implement such controllers, electrical engineers may use [[electronic circuit]]s, [[digital signal processor]]s, [[microcontroller]]s, and [[programmable logic controller]]s (PLCs). [[Control engineering]] has a wide range of applications from the flight and propulsion systems of [[Airliner|commercial airliners]] to the [[cruise control]] present in many modern [[automobile]]s.{{sfn|McDavid|Echaore-McDavid|2009|p=95}} It also plays an important role in [[industrial automation]].

Control engineers often utilize [[feedback]] when designing [[control system]]s. For example, in an [[automobile]] with [[cruise control]] the vehicle's [[speed]] is continuously monitored and fed back to the system which adjusts the [[Internal combustion engine|motor's]] [[Power (physics)|power]] output accordingly. Where there is regular feedback, [[control theory]] can be used to determine how the system responds to such feedback.{{sfn|Fairman|1998|p=119}}

===Electronics===
{{Main article|Electronic engineering}}

[[File:Componentes.JPG|thumb|left|[[Electronic components]]]]
Electronic engineering involves the design and testing of [[electronic circuit]]s that use the properties of [[electrical element|components]] such as [[resistor]]s, [[capacitor]]s, [[inductor]]s, [[diode]]s, and [[transistor]]s to achieve a particular functionality.&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{cite book|title=Engineering: Issues, Challenges and Opportunities for Development|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=09i67GgGPCYC&amp;pg=PA128|year=2010|publisher=UNESCO|isbn=978-92-3-104156-3|pages=127–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[tuned circuit]], which allows the user of a [[radio]] to [[electronic filter|filter]] out all but a single station, is just one example of such a circuit. Another example to research is a pneumatic signal conditioner.

Prior to the Second World War, the subject was commonly known as ''radio engineering'' and basically was restricted to aspects of communications and [[radar]], [[radio|commercial radio]], and [[television|early television]].&lt;ref name="UNESCO"/&gt; Later, in post war years, as consumer devices began to be developed, the field grew to include modern television, audio systems, [[computer]]s, and [[microprocessors]]. In the mid-to-late 1950s, the term ''radio engineering'' gradually gave way to the name ''electronic engineering''.

Before the invention of the [[integrated circuit]] in 1959,{{Sfn|Thompson|2006|p=4}} electronic circuits were constructed from discrete components that could be manipulated by humans. These discrete circuits consumed much space and [[electric power|power]] and were limited in speed, although they are still common in some applications. By contrast, [[integrated circuit]]s packed a large number—often millions—of tiny electrical components, mainly [[transistor]]s,{{Sfn|Merhari|2009|p=233}} into a small chip around the size of a [[coin]]. This allowed for the powerful [[computer]]s and other electronic devices we see today.

===Microelectronics===
{{Main article|Microelectronics}}
[[File:80486dx2-large.jpg|thumb|right|[[Microprocessor]]]]
[[Microelectronics]] engineering deals with the design and [[microfabrication]] of very small electronic circuit components for use in an [[integrated circuit]] or sometimes for use on their own as a general electronic component.{{Sfn|Bhushan|1997|p=581}} The most common microelectronic components are [[semiconductor]] [[transistor]]s, although all main electronic components ([[resistor]]s, [[capacitor]]s etc.) can be created at a microscopic level. [[Nanoelectronics]] is the further scaling of devices down to [[nanometer]] levels. Modern devices are already in the nanometer regime, with below 100&amp;nbsp;nm processing having been standard since around 2002.{{Sfn|Mook|2008|p=149}}

Microelectronic components are created by chemically fabricating wafers of semiconductors such as silicon (at higher frequencies, [[compound semiconductor]]s like gallium arsenide and indium phosphide) to obtain the desired transport of electronic charge and control of current. The field of microelectronics involves a significant amount of chemistry and material science and requires the electronic engineer working in the field to have a very good working knowledge of the effects of [[quantum mechanics]].{{sfn|Sullivan|2012}}

===Signal processing===
{{Main article|Signal processing}}
[[File:Bayer pattern on sensor.svg|thumb|left|A [[Bayer filter]] on a [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] requires signal processing to get a red, green, and blue value at each pixel.]]
[[Signal processing]] deals with the analysis and manipulation of [[signal (electrical engineering)|signals]].{{Sfn|Tuzlukov|2010|p=20}} Signals can be either [[analog signal|analog]], in which case the signal varies continuously according to the information, or [[Digital signal (signal processing)|digital]], in which case the signal varies according to a series of discrete values representing the information. For analog signals, signal processing may involve the [[amplifier|amplification]] and [[Filter (signal processing)|filtering]] of audio signals for audio equipment or the [[modulation]] and [[demodulation]] of signals for [[telecommunication]]s. For digital signals, signal processing may involve the [[Data compression|compression]], [[error detection]] and [[error correction]] of digitally sampled signals.{{Sfn|Manolakis|Ingle|2011|p=17}}

Signal Processing is a very mathematically oriented and intensive area forming the core of [[digital signal processing]] and it is rapidly expanding with new applications in every field of electrical engineering such as communications, control, radar, [[audio engineer]]ing, [[broadcast engineering]], power electronics, and [[biomedical engineering]] as many already existing analog systems are replaced with their digital counterparts. [[Analog signal processing]] is still important in the design of many [[control system]]s.

DSP processor ICs are found in many types of modern electronic devices, such as digital [[television set]]s,{{sfn|Bayoumi|Swartzlander|1994|p=25}} radios, [[Hi-Fi]] audio equipment, mobile phones, [[Portable Media Player|multimedia players]], camcorders and digital cameras, automobile control systems, [[noise cancelling]] headphones, digital [[spectrum analyzer]]s, missile guidance systems, [[radar]] systems, and [[telematics]] systems. In such products, DSP may be responsible for [[noise reduction]], [[speech recognition]] or [[Speech synthesis|synthesis]], [[Codec|encoding or decoding]] digital media, wirelessly [[Transceiver|transmitting or receiving]] data, triangulating position using [[GPS]], and other kinds of [[image processing]], [[video processing]], [[audio signal processing|audio processing]], and [[speech processing]].{{Sfn|Khanna|2009|p=297}}

===Telecommunications===
{{Main article|Telecommunications engineering}}
[[File:Erdfunkstelle Raisting 2a.jpg|thumb|right|[[Satellite dish]]es are a crucial component in the analysis of satellite information.]]
[[Telecommunications|Telecommunications engineering]] focuses on the [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] of [[information]] across a [[communication channel]] such as a [[coax cable]], [[optical fiber]] or [[free space optical communications|free space]].{{sfn|Tobin|2007|p=15}} Transmissions across free space require information to be encoded in a [[carrier signal]] to shift the information to a carrier frequency suitable for transmission; this is known as [[modulation]]. Popular analog modulation techniques include [[amplitude modulation]] and [[frequency modulation]].{{Sfn|Chandrasekhar|2006|p=21}} The choice of modulation affects the cost and performance of a system and these two factors must be balanced carefully by the engineer.

Once the transmission characteristics of a system are determined, telecommunication engineers design the [[transmitter]]s and [[receiver (radio)|receivers]] needed for such systems. These two are sometimes combined to form a two-way communication device known as a [[transceiver]]. A key consideration in the design of transmitters is their [[power consumption]] as this is closely related to their [[signal strength]].{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=19}}{{sfn|Zhang|Hu|Luo|2007|p=448}} If the signal strength of a transmitter is insufficient the signal's information will be corrupted by [[signal noise|noise]].

===Instrumentation===
{{Main article|Instrumentation engineering}}
[[File:F-18E cockpit m02006112600499.jpg|thumb|right|[[Flight instruments]] provide pilots with the tools to control aircraft analytically.]]
[[Instrumentation engineering]] deals with the design of devices to measure physical quantities such as [[pressure]], [[Volumetric flow rate|flow]], and [[temperature]].{{Sfn|Grant|Bixley|2011|p=159}} The design of such instruments requires a good understanding of [[physics]] that often extends beyond [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic theory]]. For example, [[flight instruments]] measure variables such as [[wind speed]] and [[altitude]] to enable pilots the control of aircraft analytically. Similarly, [[thermocouple]]s use the [[Peltier-Seebeck effect]] to measure the temperature difference between two points.{{sfn|Fredlund|Rahardjo|Fredlund|2012|p=346}}

Often instrumentation is not used by itself, but instead as the [[sensor]]s of larger electrical systems. For example, a thermocouple might be used to help ensure a furnace's temperature remains constant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Manual on the Use of Thermocouples in Temperature Measurement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pos-MXDWb6MC&amp;pg=PA154|date=1 January 1993|publisher=ASTM International|isbn=978-0-8031-1466-1|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, instrumentation engineering is often viewed as the counterpart of control.

===Computers===
{{Main article|Computer engineering}}
[[File:MEGWARE.CLIC.jpg|thumb|right|[[Supercomputer]]s are used in fields as diverse as [[computational biology]] and [[geographic information systems]].]]
Computer engineering deals with the design of [[computer]]s and [[computer system]]s. This may involve the design of new [[computer hardware|hardware]], the design of [[personal digital assistant|PDAs]], tablets, and [[supercomputers]], or the use of computers to control an [[manufacturing|industrial plant]].{{sfn|Obaidat|Denko|Woungang|2011|p=9}} Computer engineers may also work on a system's [[software]]. However, the design of complex software systems is often the domain of [[software engineering]], which is usually considered a separate discipline.{{sfn|Jalote|2006|p=22}} [[Desktop computer]]s represent a tiny fraction of the devices a computer engineer might work on, as computer-like architectures are now found in a range of devices including [[video game console]]s and [[DVD player]]s.

===Related disciplines===
[[File:VIP Bird2.jpg|thumb|left|The Bird VIP Infant ventilator]]
[[Mechatronics]] is an engineering discipline which deals with the convergence of electrical and [[machine|mechanical]] systems. Such combined systems are known as [[electromechanical]] systems and have widespread adoption. Examples include [[automation|automated manufacturing systems]],{{sfn|Mahalik|2003|p=569}} [[HVAC|heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems]],{{sfn|Leondes|2000|p=199}} and various subsystems of [[aircraft]] and [[automobile]]s.
{{sfn|Shetty|Kolk|2010|p=36}}
''Electronic systems design'' is the subject within electrical engineering that deals with the multi-disciplinary design issues of complex electrical and mechanical systems.&lt;ref name="lienig"&gt;{{Cite book|author=J. Lienig|author2=H. Bruemmer|title=Fundamentals of Electronic Systems Design|pp=1|publisher=Springer International Publishing|date=2017|isbn=978-3-319-55839-4|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-55840-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''mechatronics'' is typically used to refer to [[macroscopic]] systems but [[Futures studies|futurists]] have predicted the emergence of very small electromechanical devices. Already, such small devices, known as [[Microelectromechanical systems]] (MEMS), are used in automobiles to tell [[airbag]]s when to deploy,{{sfn|Maluf|Williams|2004|p=3}} in [[digital projector]]s to create sharper images, and in [[inkjet printer]]s to create nozzles for high definition printing. In the future it is hoped the devices will help build tiny implantable medical devices and improve [[optical communication]].{{Sfn|Iga|Kokubun|2010|p=137}}

[[Biomedical engineering]] is another related discipline, concerned with the design of [[medical equipment]]. This includes fixed equipment such as [[ventilator]]s, [[MRI|MRI scanners]],{{Sfn|Dodds|Kumar|Veering|2014|p=274}} and [[electrocardiograph|electrocardiograph monitors]] as well as mobile equipment such as [[cochlear implant]]s, [[artificial pacemaker]]s, and [[artificial heart]]s.

[[Aerospace engineering]] and [[robotics]] an example is the most recent [[electric propulsion]] and ion propulsion.

==Education==
{{Main article|Education and training of electrical and electronics engineers}}
[[File:Osciloscopio locomotora.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Oscilloscope]]]]
Electrical engineers typically possess an [[academic degree]] with a major in electrical engineering, [[electronics engineering]], [[electrical engineering technology]],&lt;ref name=BLS3&gt;{{cite web|title=Electrical and Electronic Engineer|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/electrical-and-electronics-engineers.htm#tab-4|work=[[Occupational Outlook Handbook]], 2012-13 Edition|publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor|accessdate=November 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or electrical and electronic engineering.{{Sfn|Chaturvedi|1997|p=253}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = What is the difference between electrical and electronic engineering? | work = FAQs - Studying Electrical Engineering | url = http://www.ieee.org/portal/site/mainsite/menuitem.818c0c39e85ef176fb2275875bac26c8/index.jsp?&amp;pName=corp_level1&amp;path=education/faqs&amp;file=faqs1.xml&amp;xsl=generic.xsl | accessdate =20 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same fundamental principles are taught in all programs, though emphasis may vary according to title. The length of study for such a degree is usually four or five years and the completed degree may be designated as a Bachelor of Science in Electrical/Electronics Engineering Technology, [[Bachelor of Engineering]], [[Bachelor of Science]], [[Bachelor of Technology]], or [[Bachelor of Applied Science]] depending on the university. The [[bachelor's degree]] generally includes units covering [[physics]], [[mathematics]], [[computer science]], [[project management]], and a [[list of electrical engineering topics|variety of topics in electrical engineering]].&lt;ref name="Enterprise1986"&gt;{{cite book|title=Computerworld|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uVHbRM6mU9gC&amp;pg=PA97|date=25 August 1986|publisher=IDG Enterprise|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially such topics cover most, if not all, of the subdisciplines of electrical engineering. At some schools, the students can then choose to emphasize one or more subdisciplines towards the end of their courses of study.

[[File:LM317 typical schematic.svg|thumb|left|An example [[circuit diagram]]. It is used as a powerful tool in [[troubleshooting]]. ]]

At many schools, electronic engineering is included as part of an electrical award, sometimes explicitly, such as a Bachelor of Engineering (Electrical and Electronic), but in others electrical and electronic engineering are both considered to be sufficiently broad and complex that separate degrees are offered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Electrical and Electronic Engineering|url=http://www.flinders.edu.au/science_engineering/csem/disciplines/eee/|accessdate=8 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some electrical engineers choose to study for a postgraduate degree such as a [[Master of Engineering]]/[[Master of Science]] (M.Eng./M.Sc.), a Master of [[Engineering Management]], a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (Ph.D.) in Engineering, an [[Engineering Doctorate]] (Eng.D.), or an [[Engineer's degree]]. The master's and engineer's degrees may consist of either [[research]], [[coursework]] or a mixture of the two. The Doctor of Philosophy and Engineering Doctorate degrees consist of a significant research component and are often viewed as the entry point to [[academia]]. In the United Kingdom and some other European countries, Master of Engineering is often considered to be an undergraduate degree of slightly longer duration than the Bachelor of Engineering rather than postgraduate.&lt;ref&gt;Various including graduate degree requirements [http://www.eecs.mit.edu/grad/degrees.html at MIT] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060116055044/http://www.eecs.mit.edu/grad/degrees.html |date=16 January 2006 }}, study guide [http://www.ecm.uwa.edu.au/students/study-guides-2012/be-elec-mech at UWA], the curriculum [http://www.queensu.ca/calendars/appsci/pg219.html at Queen's] and unit tables [http://www.abdn.ac.uk/registry/calendar/requirements/07H50116.doc at Aberdeen]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practicing engineers==

In most countries, a bachelor's degree in engineering represents the first step towards [[professional certification]] and the degree program itself is certified by a [[professional body]].&lt;ref name="Labor2008"&gt;{{cite book|title=Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2008–2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F4ZS7UQ1QZoC|date=1 March 2008|publisher=U S Department of Labor, Jist Works|isbn=978-1-59357-513-7|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing a certified degree program the engineer must satisfy a range of requirements (including work experience requirements) before being certified. Once certified the engineer is designated the title of [[Professional Engineer]] (in the United States, Canada and South Africa), [[Chartered engineer|Chartered Engineer]] or [[Incorporated Engineer]]  (in India, Pakistan, the United Kingdom, Ireland and [[Zimbabwe]]), Chartered Professional Engineer (in Australia and New Zealand) or [[European Engineer]] (in much of the [[European Union]]).

[[File:3 Park Avenue.JPG|thumb|left|The [[IEEE]] corporate office is on the 17th floor of [[3 Park Avenue]] in [[New York City]]]]
The advantages of licensure vary depending upon location. For example, in the United States and Canada "only a licensed engineer may seal engineering work for public and private clients".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Why Should You Get Licensed? | work = National Society of Professional Engineers | url = http://www.nspe.org/lc1-why.asp | accessdate =11 July 2005 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050604085233/http://www.nspe.org/lc1-why.asp| archivedate = 4 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; This requirement is enforced by state and provincial legislation such as [[Quebec]]'s Engineers Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Engineers Act | work = Quebec Statutes and Regulations (CanLII) | url = http://www2.publicationsduquebec.gouv.qc.ca/dynamicSearch/telecharge.php?type=2&amp;file=//I_9/I9_A.htm | accessdate =24 July 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other countries, no such legislation exists. Practically all certifying bodies maintain a [[ethical code|code of ethics]] that they expect all members to abide by or risk expulsion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Codes of Ethics and Conduct | work = Online Ethics Center | url = http://onlineethics.org/CMS/profpractice/ethcodes.aspx | accessdate =24 July 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way these organizations play an important role in maintaining ethical standards for the profession. Even in jurisdictions where certification has little or no legal bearing on work, engineers are subject to [[contract law]]. In cases where an engineer's work fails he or she may be subject to the [[negligence|tort of negligence]] and, in extreme cases, the charge of [[criminal negligence]]. An engineer's work must also comply with numerous other rules and regulations, such as [[building codes]] and legislation pertaining to [[environmental law]].

Professional bodies of note for electrical engineers include the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) and the [[Institution of Engineering and Technology]] (IET).  The IEEE claims to produce 30% of the world's literature in electrical engineering, has over 360,000 members worldwide and holds over 3,000 conferences annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = About the IEEE | work = IEEE | url = http://www.ieee.org/about/ | accessdate =11 July 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The IET publishes 21 journals, has a worldwide membership of over 150,000, and claims to be the largest professional engineering society in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = About the IET | work = The IET | url = http://www.theiet.org/about/ | accessdate =11 July 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Journal and Magazines | work = The IET | url = http://www.theiet.org/publishing/journals/ | accessdate =11 July 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Obsolescence of technical skills is a serious concern for electrical engineers. Membership and participation in technical societies, regular reviews of periodicals in the field and a habit of continued learning are therefore essential to maintaining proficiency. An MIET(Member of the Institution of Engineering and Technology) is recognised in Europe as an Electrical and computer (technology) engineer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Electrical and Electronics Engineers, except Computer | work = Occupational Outlook Handbook | url = http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos031.htm | accessdate =16 July 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050713014728/http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos031.htm|archivedate=13 July 2005}} (see [[work of the United States Government|here]] regarding copyright)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, Canada, and the United States electrical engineers make up around 0.25% of the labor force (see [[#demographics|&lt;span id="demographics_back"&gt;note&lt;/span&gt;]]).

==Tools and work==

From the [[Global Positioning System]] to [[electricity generation|electric power generation]], electrical engineers have contributed to the development of a wide range of technologies. They design, develop, test, and supervise the deployment of electrical systems and electronic devices. For example, they may work on the design of [[telecommunication|telecommunication systems]], the operation of [[power station|electric power stations]], the [[lighting]] and [[electrical wiring|wiring]] of [[building]]s, the design of [[home appliance|household appliances]], or the electrical [[control theory|control]] of industrial machinery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Electrical and Electronics Engineers, except Computer |work=Occupational Outlook Handbook |url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos031.htm |accessdate=16 July 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050713014728/http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos031.htm |archivedate=13 July 2005 |deadurl=yes |df= }} (see )&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Molnya-1 Musee du Bourget P1010442.jpg|thumb|left|[[Communications satellite|Satellite communications]] is typical of what electrical engineers work on.]]
Fundamental to the discipline are the sciences of [[physics]] and [[mathematics]] as these help to obtain both a [[Qualitative data|qualitative]] and [[Quantity|quantitative]] description of how such systems will work. Today most [[engineering]] work involves the use of [[computers]] and it is commonplace to use [[computer-aided design]] programs when designing electrical systems. Nevertheless, the ability to sketch ideas is still invaluable for quickly communicating with others.

[[File:Shadow Hand Bulb large.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Shadow Hand|Shadow robot hand]] system]]
Although most electrical engineers will understand basic [[circuit theory]] (that is the interactions of elements such as [[resistor]]s, [[capacitor]]s, [[diode]]s, [[transistor]]s, and [[inductor]]s in a circuit), the theories employed by engineers generally depend upon the work they do. For example, [[quantum mechanics]] and [[solid state physics]] might be relevant to an engineer working on [[VLSI]] (the design of integrated circuits), but are largely irrelevant to engineers working with macroscopic electrical systems. Even [[circuit theory]] may not be relevant to a person designing telecommunication systems that use [[commercial off-the-shelf|off-the-shelf]] components. Perhaps the most important technical skills for electrical engineers are reflected in university programs, which emphasize [[numeracy|strong numerical skills]], [[computer literacy]], and the ability to understand the [[technical terminology|technical language and concepts]] that relate to electrical engineering.{{Sfn|Taylor|2008|p=241}}

[[File:Laser in fibre.jpg|thumb|A [[laser]] bouncing down an [[poly(methyl methacrylate)|acrylic]] rod, illustrating the total internal reflection of light in a multi-mode optical fiber.]]

A wide range of instrumentation is used by electrical engineers.  For simple control circuits and alarms, a basic [[multimeter]] measuring [[voltage]], [[electric current|current]], and [[electrical resistance|resistance]] may suffice.  Where time-varying signals need to be studied, the [[oscilloscope]] is also an ubiquitous instrument.  In [[RF engineering]] and high frequency telecommunications, [[spectrum analyzer]]s and [[Network analyzer (electrical)|network analyzer]]s are used.  In some disciplines, safety can be a particular concern with instrumentation.  For instance, medical electronics designers must take into account that much lower voltages than normal can be dangerous when electrodes are directly in contact with internal body fluids.{{sfn|Leitgeb|2010|p=122}} Power transmission engineering also has great safety concerns due to the high voltages used; although [[voltmeter]]s may in principle be similar to their low voltage equivalents, safety and calibration issues make them very different.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Naidu|Kamaraju|2009|p=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many disciplines of electrical engineering use tests specific to their discipline.  Audio electronics engineers use [[audio system measurements|audio test sets]] consisting of a signal generator and a meter, principally to measure level but also other parameters such as [[harmonic distortion]] and [[noise (electronics)|noise]].  Likewise, information technology have their own test sets, often specific to a particular data format, and the same is true of television broadcasting.

[[File:Navy-Radome.jpg|left|upright=1.2|thumb|[[Radome]] at the Misawa Air Base Misawa Security Operations Center, Misawa, Japan]]
For many engineers, technical work accounts for only a fraction of the work they do. A lot of time may also be spent on tasks such as discussing proposals with clients, preparing [[budget]]s and determining [[schedule (project management)|project schedules]].&lt;ref&gt;Trevelyan, James; (2005). ''What Do Engineers Really Do?''. University of Western Australia. (seminar with [http://www.mech.uwa.edu.au/jpt/Engineering%20Roles%20050503.pdf slides])&lt;/ref&gt; Many senior engineers manage a team of [[technician]]s or other engineers and for this reason [[project management]] skills are important. Most engineering projects involve some form of documentation and [[technical writing|strong written communication]] skills are therefore very important.

The [[Office|workplaces]] of engineers are just as varied as the types of work they do. Electrical engineers may be found in the pristine lab environment of a [[fabrication plant]], onboard a [[Naval ship]], the offices of a [[consulting firm]] or on site at a [[mining|mine]]. During their working life, electrical engineers may find themselves supervising a wide range of individuals including [[scientist]]s, [[electrician]]s, [[computer programmers]], and other engineers.{{Sfn|McDavid|Echaore-McDavid|2009|p=87}}

Electrical engineering has an intimate relationship with the physical sciences.  For instance, the physicist [[Lord Kelvin]] played a major role in the engineering of the first [[transatlantic telegraph cable]].&lt;ref&gt;Huurdeman, pp.&amp;nbsp;95–96&lt;/ref&gt;  Conversely, the engineer [[Oliver Heaviside]] produced major work on the mathematics of transmission on telegraph cables.&lt;ref&gt;Huurdeman, p.90&lt;/ref&gt;  Electrical engineers are often required on major science projects.  For instance, large [[particle accelerator]]s such as [[CERN]] need electrical engineers to deal with many aspects of the project: from the power distribution, to the instrumentation, to the manufacture and installation of the [[superconducting electromagnet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, p.218&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martini, p.179&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4189">{{Semiotics}}

'''Encoding''', in '''[[semiotics]]''', is the [[wikt:process|process]] of creating a [[message]] for transmission by an addresser to an addressee. The complementary process{{spaced ndash}}interpreting a message received from an addresser{{spaced ndash}}is called [[Decoding (semiotics)|decoding]].

==Discussion==
The process of message exchanges, or [[semiosis]], is a key characteristic of human life depending on rule-governed and learned [[code (Semiotics)|codes]] that, for the most part, [[Unconscious_mind|unconsciously]] guide the communication of [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]] between [[individual]]s. These interpretive frameworks or linking grids were termed "myths" by [[Roland Barthes]] (1915–1980) and pervade all aspects of [[culture]] from personal conversation to the mass media's output (for code exchange through the mass media, see [[Americanism (semiotics)|Americanism]]).

Early theorists like [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure]] (1857–1913) proposed the theory that when the addresser wishes to transmit a message to an addressee, the intended meaning must be converted into content so that it can be delivered. [[Roman Jakobson]] (1896–1982) offered a [[structuralism|structuralist]] theory that the transmission and response would not sustain an efficient [[discourse]] unless the parties used the same codes in the appropriate social contexts. But, Barthes shifted the emphasis from the ''semiotics of language'' to the exploration of ''semiotics as language''. Now, as Daniel Chandler states, there is no such thing as an uncoded message: all experience is coded. So when the addresser is planning the particular message, both [[denotation (Semiotics)|denotative]] and [[connotation (Semiotics)|connotative]] meanings will already be attached to the range of signifiers relevant to the message. Within the broad framework of [[syntactic]] and [[semantic]] codes, the addresser will select signifiers that, in the particular context, will best represent his or her [[value (Semiotics)|values]] and purposes. But the medium of communication is not necessarily neutral and the ability of the addressee to accurately decode the message may be affected by a number of factors. So the addresser must attempt to compensate for the known problems when constructing the final version of the message and hope that the preferred meanings will be identified when the message is received. One of the techniques is to structure the message so that certain aspects are given [[salience (semiotics)|salience]] (sometimes called ''foregrounding'') and predispose the [[audience]] to interpret the whole in the light of the particular. This relates to [[Gestalt psychology]], [[Max Wertheimer]] (1880–1943) examined the factors that determine grouping in cognitive processes:
#the fact of grouping signs together predisposes an uncritical audience to perceive the signs as similar;
#the audience prefers ''closure'', i.e. it prefers the experience to be as complete as possible and to see things as a whole even though no actual continuity or conclusion is implied; and 
#the audience prefers an everyman's version of [[Occam's Razor]], i.e. the simplest explanations and solutions. In real life that means that assumptions, inferences and prejudices can often fill in gaps. If a conclusion seems to fit the available facts, other possibilities are not considered or are disregarded, producing the suggestion that humans conserve cognitive energy whenever they can and avoid thinking.
If an addresser is writing a speech, [[rhetoric]]al [[Trope (linguistics)|tropes]] may be used to emphasise the elements that the audience is to focus upon and potentially perceive as predicating a particular conclusion. If images are to be selected, [[metonymy]] may indicate common associational values with the preferred meaning of the text.

In the fields of [[chronology]] and [[periodization]], an '''epoch''' is an instant in time chosen as the origin of a particular [[calendar era|era]]. The "epoch" then serves as a reference point from which time is measured. [[Time#Measurement|Time measurement units]] are counted from the epoch so that the date and time of events can be specified unambiguously.

Events taking place before the epoch can be dated by counting negatively from the epoch, though in pragmatic [[periodization]] practice, epochs are defined for the past, and another epoch is used to start the next era, therefore serving as the ending of the older preceding era. The whole purpose and criteria of such definitions are to clarify and co-ordinate scholarship about a period, at times, across disciplines.

Epochs are generally chosen to be convenient or significant by a consensus of the time scale's initial users, or by authoritarian fiat. The epoch moment or date is usually defined by ''a specific clear event'', condition, or criterion—the epoch event or epoch criterion—from which the period or era or age is usually characterized or described.

== Calendar eras ==
=== Regnal eras ===
{{see|Regnal era}}
The official [[Japanese era name|Japanese system]] numbers years from the accession of the current [[Emperor of Japan|emperor]], regarding the calendar year during which the accession occurred as the first year.
A similar [[Chinese era name|system]] existed in [[China]] before 1912, being based on the accession year of the emperor (1911 was thus the third year of the [[Xuantong]] period). With the establishment of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] in 1912, the republican era was introduced. It is still very common in [[Taiwan]] to date events via the republican era. The People's Republic of China adopted the common era calendar in 1949 (the 38th year of the Chinese Republic).

=== Pre-modern eras ===
* [[Olympiad]]s, the ancient Greek era of four-year periods beginning in 776 BC.
* [[Ab urbe condita]] (753 BC), used in the Roman imperial period.
* The [[Anno Domini]] or "[[Common Era]]" era, still in use with the [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] and [[Julian calendar]]s today, marks the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation of Jesus]] as calculated in the 6th century by [[Dionysius Exiguus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Blackburn |first1=B |last2=Holford-Strevens |first2=L |date=2003 |title=The Oxford Companion to the Year: An exploration of calendar customs and time-reckoning |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Incarnation era |page=881}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Anno Mundi]] (years since the creation of the world) as used in the [[Byzantine calendar]] (5509 BC).
* [[Anno Mundi]] (years since the creation of the world) as used in the [[Hebrew calendar]] (3761 BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/counting-the-years/ |title=Counting the Jewish Years |website=myjewishlearning.com |last=Solomin |first=Rachel M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lee |first=Scott E. |date=2006 |url=http://www.rosettacalendar.com/calendars.html |title=Overview of Calendars |website=rosettacalendar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Islamic calendar]] counts "lunar years" by ''Anno Hegiræ'' (in the year of the ''[[Hijra (Islam)|hijra]]'') or ''AH'' era (AD 622). The year count shifts relative to the solar year as the calendar is [[lunar calendar|purely lunar]]. The official [[Iranian calendars|Iranian calendar]] (used in [[Afghanistan]] as well as [[Iran]]) also dates from the ''hijra'', but as it is a [[solar calendar]] its year numbering does not coincide with the religious calendar.
* The term [[Hindu calendar]] may refer to a number of traditional Indian calendars. A notable example of a Hindu epoch is the [[Vikram Samvat]] (58 BC),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| edition = 3rd| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-70238-6| last1 = Dershowitz| first1 = Nachum| authorlink1 = Nachum Dershowitz | last2 = Reingold| first2 = Edward M.| authorlink2 = Edward Reingold  |title = Calendrical Calculations| date = 2008 | page = 289}}&lt;/ref&gt; also used in modern times as  "national calendar" of [[Nepal]] and [[Bangladesh]].
*   [[Buddhist calendar]]s tend to use the epoch of 544 BC (date of Buddha's ''[[parinirvana]]'').

=== Modern eras ===
* The [[Baha'i calendar]] is dated from the vernal equinox of the year the [[Báb]] proclaimed his religion (AD 1844). Years are grouped in Váḥids of 19 years, and Kull-i-Shay’s of 361 (19 x 19) years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=E. G. |last=Richards |chapter=Calendars |editor-first1=S.

* In [[Thailand]] in 1888 King [[Chulalongkorn]] decreed a National Thai Era dating from the founding of [[Bangkok]] on April 6, 1782. In 1912, New Year's Day was shifted to April 1. In 1941, Prime Minister [[Plaek Pibulsonggram|Phibunsongkhram]] decided to count the years since 543 BC. This is the [[Thai solar calendar]] using the Thai Buddhist Era. Except for this era, it is the Gregorian calendar.
* In the [[French Republican Calendar]], a calendar used by the French government for about twelve years from late 1793, the epoch was the beginning of the "Republican Era", September 22, 1792 (the day the [[French First Republic]] was proclaimed, one day after the Convention abolished the monarchy).
* The [[Indian national calendar]], introduced in 1957, follows the [[Saka era]] (AD 78).
* [[Minguo calendar]] used by officials of [[Taiwan]] and [[Republic of China (1912–49)|its predecessor]] since January 1, 1912, the first year after [[Xinhai Revolution]] which overthrew [[Qing dynasty|Qing Empire]] and the subsequent establishment of the republic.
* [[North Korea]] uses a system that starts in 1912 (= [[Juche]] 1), the year of the birth of their founder [[Kim Il-Sung]].
* In the scientific [[Before Present]] system of numbering years for purposes of [[radiocarbon dating]], the reference date is January 1, 1950 (though the use of January 1 is quite irrelevant, as radiocarbon dating has limited precision).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.c14dating.com/agecalc.html |website=c14dating.com |title=Radiocarbon dating – Age calculation |last=Higham |first=Thomas |authorlink1= Thomas Higham |publisher=Thomas Higham |accessdate=December 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stuiver |first=Minze |author2=Polach HA |year=1977 |title=Discussion; reporting of C-14 data. |journal=Radiocarbon |publisher=University of Arizona |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=355–363 |url=https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/radiocarbon/article/view/493/498 |accessdate=October 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Astronomy ==

{{Main|Epoch (astronomy)}}

In astronomy, an epoch is a specific moment in time for which [[Celestial coordinate system|celestial coordinates]] or [[orbital elements]] are specified, and from which other orbital parametrics are thereafter calculated in order to predict future position. The applied tools of the mathematics disciplines of [[Celestial mechanics]] or its subfield [[Orbital mechanics]] (both predict orbital paths and positions) about a [[center of gravity]] are used to generate an [[ephemeris]] (plural: ''ephemerides''; from the Greek word ''ephemeros'' = daily) which is a table of values that gives the positions of astronomical objects in the sky at a given time or times, or a formula to calculate such given the proper time offset from the epoch. Such calculations generally result in an elliptical path on a plane defined by some point on the orbit, and the two foci of the [[ellipse]]. Viewing from another orbiting body, following its own trace and orbit, creates shifts in three dimensions in the spherical trigonometry used to calculate relative positions. These dynamics in three dimensions are also elliptical, which means the ephemeris need only specify one set of equations to be a useful predictive tool to predict future location of the object of interest.

Over time, inexactitudes and other errors accumulate, creating more and greater errors of prediction, so ephemeris factors need to be recalculated from time to time, and that requires a new epoch to be defined. Different astronomers or groups of astronomers used to define epochs to suit themselves, but in these days of speedy communications, the epochs are generally defined in an international agreement, so astronomers worldwide can collaborate more effectively. It was inefficient and error prone for data observed by one group to need translation (mathematic transformation) so other groups could compare information.

=== J2000.0 ===
The current standard epoch is called "[[J2000.0]]" This is defined by international agreement to be equivalent to:
# The [[Gregorian date]] January 1, 2000 at approximately 12:00 GMT ([[Greenwich Mean Time]]).
# The [[Julian date]] 2451545.0 TT ([[Terrestrial Time]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-first=P. K. |editor-last=Seidelman  |encyclopedia=Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac |location=Sausalito, CA |publisher=University Science Books |date=1992 |pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# January 1, 2000, 11:59:27.816 TAI ([[International Atomic Time]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-first=P. K. |editor-last=Seidelman  |encyclopedia=Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac |location=Sausalito, CA |publisher=University Science Books |date=1992 |title=Glossary: Terrestrial Dynamical Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# January 1, 2000, 11:58:55.816 UTC ([[Coordinated Universal Time]]).{{efn|This article uses a 24-hour clock, so 11:59:27.816 is equivalent to 11:59:27.816 AM.}}

== Computing == &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Microsoft Office Excel]] --&gt;
The [[system time|time kept internally]] by a [[computer]] system is usually expressed as the number of time units that have elapsed since a specified epoch, which is nearly always specified as midnight [[Universal Time]] on some particular date.

Software timekeeping systems vary widely in the granularity of their time units; some systems may use time units as large as a day, while others may use [[nanosecond]]s. For example, for an epoch date of midnight UTC (00:00) on January 1, 1900, and a time unit of a second, the time of the midnight (24:00) between January 1 and 2, 1900 is represented by the number 86400, the number of seconds in one day. When times prior to the epoch need to be represented, it is common to use the same system, but with negative numbers.

These representations of time are mainly for internal use. If an end user interaction with dates and times is required, the software will nearly always convert this internal number into a date and time representation that is comprehensible to humans.

=== Notable epoch dates in computing ===
{{See also|System time}}
The following table lists epoch dates used by popular software and other computer-related systems. The time in these systems is stored as the quantity of a particular time unit (days, seconds, nanoseconds, etc.) that has elapsed since a stated time (usually midnight UTC at the beginning of the given date).

=== Problems with epoch-based computer time representation ===

Computers do not generally store arbitrarily large numbers. Instead, each number stored by a computer is allotted a fixed amount of space. Therefore, when the number of time units that have elapsed since a system's epoch exceeds the largest number that can fit in the space allotted to the time representation, the time representation [[arithmetic overflow|overflows]], and problems can occur. While a system's behavior after overflow occurs is not necessarily predictable, in most systems the number representing the time will reset to zero, and the computer system will think that the current time is the epoch time again.

Most famously, older systems which counted time as the number of years elapsed since the epoch of January 1, 1900 and which only allotted enough space to store the numbers 0 through 99, experienced the [[Year 2000 problem]]. These systems (if not corrected beforehand) would interpret the date January 1, 2000 as January 1, 1900, leading to unpredictable errors at the beginning of the year 2000.

Even systems which allocate more storage to the time representation are not immune from this kind of error. Many [[Unix-like]] [[operating system]]s which keep time as seconds elapsed from the epoch date of January 1, 1970, and allot timekeeping enough storage to store numbers as large as  {{nowrap|2 147 483 647}} will experience an overflow problem on January 19, 2038 if not fixed beforehand. This is known as the [[Year 2038 problem]]. A correction involving doubling the storage allocated to timekeeping on these systems will allow them to represent dates more than 290 billion years into the future.

Other more subtle timekeeping problems exist in computing, such as accounting for [[leap second]]s, which are not observed with any predictability or regularity. Additionally, applications which need to represent historical dates and times (for example, representing a date prior to the switch from the [[Julian calendar]] to the [[Gregorian calendar]]) must use specialized timekeeping [[library (computing)|libraries]].

Finally, some software must maintain compatibility with older software that does not keep time in strict accordance with traditional timekeeping systems. For example, [[Microsoft Excel]] observes the fictional date of [[February 29, 1900]] in order to maintain compatibility with older versions of [[Lotus 1-2-3]].&lt;ref name="excel-leapyear" /&gt; Lotus 1-2-3 observed the date due to an error; by the time the error was discovered, it was too late to fix it—"a change now would disrupt formulas which were written to accommodate this anomaly".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last2=Reingold |first2=Edward |author-link2=Edward Reingold |last1=Dershowitz |first1=Nachum |author-link1=Nachum Dershowitz |date=2008 |edition=3rd |title=Calendrical Calculations |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-70238-6 |pages=xxi, xxvi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Epoch in satellite-based time systems ===

There are at least six [[satellite navigation]] systems, all of which function by transmitting [[time signal]]s. Of the only two satellite systems with global coverage, [[GPS]] calculates its time signal from an epoch, whereas [[GLONASS]] calculates time as an offset from [[UTC]], with the UTC input adjusted for [[leap seconds]]. Of the only two other systems aiming for global coverage, [[Galileo positioning system|Galileo]] calculates from an epoch and [[Compass navigation system|Beidou]] calculates from UTC without adjustment for leap seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |url=http://www.navipedia.net/index.php/Time_References_in_GNSS |title=Time References in GNSS |first1=J.

Juan |last2=Zornoza |first3=M. |last3=Hernández-Pajares |date=2011 |website=gssc.esa.int/navipedia |publisher=European Space Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; GPS also transmits the offset between UTC time and GPS time, and must update this offset every time there is a [[leap second]], requiring GPS receiving devices to handle the update correctly. In contrast, leap seconds are transparent to GLONASS users.
The complexities of calculating UTC from an epoch are explained by the [[European Space Agency]] in Galileo documentation under "Equations to correct system timescale to reference timescale"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unoosa.org/pdf/icg/2016/gst2016.pdf |title=GNSS Timescale Description Galileo |publisher=United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs |date=2016 |at=Section 5d}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''experience machine''' or '''pleasure machine''' is a thought experiment put forward by  philosopher [[Robert Nozick]] in his 1974 book  ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Nozick | first = Robert | title = Anarchy, state, and utopia | publisher = Basic Books | location = New York | year = 1974 | isbn = 0-465-09720-0 | pages = 42–45 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the best known attempts to refute ethical [[hedonism]], and does so by imagining a choice between everyday reality and an apparently preferable [[simulated reality]].

If the primary thesis of hedonism is that "pleasure is the good", then any component of life that is not pleasurable does nothing directly to increase one's [[well-being]]. This is a view held by many value theorists, but most famously by some classical [[Utilitarianism|utilitarians]]. Nozick attacks the thesis by means of a [[thought experiment]]. If he can show that there is something other than pleasure that has value and thereby increases our well-being, then hedonism is defeated.

==The thought experiment==
Nozick asks us to imagine a machine that could give us whatever desirable or pleasurable experiences we could want. Psychologists have figured out a way to stimulate a person's brain to induce pleasurable experiences that the subject could not distinguish from those he would have apart from the machine. He then asks, if given the choice, would we prefer the machine to real life?

Nozick also believes that if pleasure were the only intrinsic value, people would have an overriding reason to be hooked up to an "experience machine," which would produce favorable sensations.

===Initial concerns===
Who would run the machines if everyone plugs in? Nozick asks us to ignore this concern, since it does not adversely affect the thought experiment. One could simply stipulate that the machines have been so well designed as to be fail-proof.

The experiment is also open to multiple interpretations. For instance, Nozick claims that you could either map out the rest of your life in the machine before plugging in, or you could unplug periodically to choose your programming for the next cycle. While interesting, these variations do not directly affect the argument.

===The argument===
The argument is along these lines:

*P1: If experiencing as much pleasure as we can is all that matters to us, then if we will experience more pleasure by doing x than by doing y, we have no reason not to do x rather than y.
*P2: We will experience more pleasure if we plug into the experience machine than if we do not plug into the experience machine.
*C1: If all that matters to us is that we experience as much pleasure as we can then we have no reason not to plug into the experience machine. (P1&amp;P2)
*P3: We have reason not to plug into the experience machine.
*C2: Experiencing as much pleasure as we can is not all that matters to us. (C1&amp;P3, by [[Modus tollens|MT]])

===Reasons not to plug in===
Nozick provides us with three reasons not to plug into the machine.

# ''We want to'' do ''certain things, and not just have the experience of doing them.''
#* "It is only because we first want to do the actions that we want the experiences of doing them." (Nozick, 43)
# ''We want to'' be ''a certain sort of person.''
#* "Someone floating in a tank is an indeterminate blob." (Nozick, 43)
# ''Plugging into an experience machine limits us to a man-made reality (it limits us to what we can make).''
#* "There is no ''actual'' contact with any deeper reality, though the experience of it can be simulated." (Nozick, 43)

===Counterarguments===
Psychologist Felipe de Brigard says that our intuitions about the experience machine may be affected by [[status quo bias]], and suggests reformulating the thought experiment in a form which counters this.&lt;ref name="Lazari-RadekSinger2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Katarzyna de Lazari-Radek|author2=[[Peter Singer]]|title=The Point of View of the Universe: Sidgwick and Contemporary Ethics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x2NeAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA257|date=22 May 2014|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-102242-5|pages=257}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to his version:
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
you wake up in a plain white room. You are seated in a reclining chair with a steel contraption on your head. A woman in a white coat is standing over you. 'The year is 2659,' she explains, 'The life with which you are familiar is an experience machine program selected by you some forty years ago. We at IEM interrupt our client's programs at ten-year intervals to ensure client satisfaction. Our records indicate that at your three previous interruptions you deemed your program satisfactory and chose to continue. As before, if you choose to continue with your program you will return to your life as you know it with no recollection of this interruption. Your friends, loved ones, and projects will all be there. Of course, you may choose to terminate your program at this point if you are unsatisfied for any reason. Do you intend to continue with your program?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
If we feel differently about this version of the story compared to the form that Nozick offers, according to de Brigard this is due to [[status quo bias]].&lt;ref name="Lazari-RadekSinger2014"/&gt;

==In fiction==
{{See also|Simulated reality in fiction}}
Before it became a philosophical thought experiment in the mid seventies, the pleasurable but simulated experience versus reality dilemma had been a staple of science fiction; for example in the short story "[[The Chamber of Life]]" by [[Green Peyton Wertenbaker]] ([[:fr:Green Peyton Wertenbaker|fr]]) , published in the magazine ''[[Amazing Stories]]'' in October 1929. The novel ''[[Infinite Jest]]'' by [[David Foster Wallace]] involves a similar formulation of the experience machine. The novel revolves around a film titled ''Infinite Jest'' that is lethally pleasurable: the film is so entertaining that, once watched, the viewer will desire nothing else but to watch the film over and over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sloane |first=Peter |year=2014 |title=The Divided Selves of David Foster Wallace |journal=Tropos |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=67-73 |doi=10.14324/111.2057-2212.011 |url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1420208/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of movies centering on machines capable of replaying experiences previously recorded include the 1983 film ''[[Brainstorm (1983 film)|Brainstorm]]'' and the 1995 film ''[[Strange Days (film)|Strange Days]]''.&lt;ref name="Baggott2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Jim Baggott]]|title=A Beginner's Guide to Reality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9yAa7kRYiUkC&amp;pg=PT137|date=1 September 2005|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-0-14-104232-9|pages=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also is a running theme of the 1999 film ''[[The Matrix]]''.&lt;ref name="Grau2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Grau|title=Philosophers Explore The Matrix|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Pmld5FXZ0YC&amp;pg=PA18|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-518107-4|pages=18–}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Agent Smith]]'s account of the early history of the Matrix includes the idea that humans reject a virtual reality that offers them paradise; however, later his informant  [[List of minor characters in the Matrix series#Mr. Reagan.2FCypher|Cypher]] is willing to betray his colleagues because he would prefer to be reinserted into an (arguably less perfect) Matrix as a wealthy and successful man than continue to live in the harsh realities outside the simulation. While this later version of the Matrix is not a paradise-like reality in the literal sense, it may be argued that it is a lot like a pleasure-inducing Experience Machine, since Cypher is given the opportunity to have a prominent position of power and wealth in this new simulation. As he says while dining at a simulated restaurant: &lt;blockquote&gt;"You know, I know this steak doesn't exist. I know that when I put it in my mouth, the Matrix is telling my brain that it is juicy, and delicious. After nine years, you know what I realize? Ignorance is bliss."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11921">[[File:Waterfront Park, Portland.jpg|thumb|[[Cherry blossom]] in the [[Tom McCall Waterfront Park]], created with the removal of the [[Harbor Drive]] in [[Portland, Oregon]].]]
'''Freeway removal''' is a [[public policy]] of [[urban planning]] policy to demolish [[freeways]] and create [[mixed-use]] urban areas, parks, residential, commercial, or other land uses. Such highway removal is often part of a policy to promote [[smart growth]], [[transit-oriented development]], [[Walkability|walkable]] and [[bicycle-friendly]] cities. In some cases freeways are re-imagined as [[boulevard]]s, rebuilt as tunneled freeways (see [[tunnel]]s) or relocated through less densely-developed areas.

== Urban design ==
Urban freeways were built to expedite traffic into and out of cities in the mid 20th century. Many of these freeways were built through dense neighborhoods, and destroyed blocks and sometimes entire neighborhoods in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://iqc.ou.edu/2014/12/12/60yrsmidwest/|title=60 Years of Urban Change: Midwest|date=2014-12-12|work=The Institute for Quality Communities|access-date=2017-09-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cities, strategies were implemented or planned for freeway removal policies to tear down highways that cut through neighborhoods. These freeways created blight that minimized use of land space and reduced the quality of life for city residents. The alternative that some cities have chosen for [[urban design]] is to replace elevated highways with [[boulevard]]s to restore neighborhoods affected by highway construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://carfreeamerica.net/2017/09/11/reconnecting-cities-through-urban-highway-removals/|title=Reconnecting Cities through Urban Highway Removals - Car Free America|date=2017-09-11|work=Car Free America|access-date=2017-09-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some regions, freeway removal has been proposed but these plans have not yet been completed or funded. In many cases, there are political battles between citizens' groups who are proponents of freeway removal proposals and drivers that want to keep the freeways.&lt;ref name="preservation"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.preservenet.com/freeways/FreewaysPlansProposals.html |title= Freeway Removal Plans and Proposals |author= Staff |publisher= Preservation Institute |year= 2007 |accessdate= November 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To increase land usage, the demolition of freeways is often a part of the discussion for both city and state’s governmental strategies. Cities planning redevelopment of certain neighborhoods, such as [[Washington, D.C.]]’s [[Whitehurst Freeway]] in the neighborhood of [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown]], were set for demolition but were frozen so the city may do an environmental impact study.  Other cities – such as [[Nashville, Tennessee]], whose government is planning to demolish the downtown loop where three major interstates ([[I-65]], [[I-40]], and [[I-24]]) converge – are planning to replace these areas with parks, boulevards, and mixed-use communities that will reconnect their cores with adjacent neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="preservation"/&gt;

== Urban intensification ==
[[File:Korea-Seoul-Cheonggyecheon-01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cheonggyecheon]] in [[Seoul]], South Korea was formerly the route for a major elevated highway; It was completed in 1976 and removed in 2005.]]
To counteract urban sprawl, some cities have made redevelopment plans around urban intensification. Urban intensification – also known as [[Compact City|Compact Cities]] in Europe – is an urban planning technique which promotes high residential density with mixed land uses based around an efficient public transport system. Typically, cities redevelop neighborhoods to concentrate growth in the center of the city with the goal of better land usage to support a high concentration of jobs and residents.  [[Smart growth]] principles and incentives generate residential, retail, and recreational development.  The purpose is to transform deteriorating, low-density commercial corridors into mixed-use corridors that focus around [[transit-oriented development]]. Cities have implemented plans to use intensification corridors functioning as [[boulevard]]s aimed at being transit supportive and pedestrian friendly, and provide\ a focus for higher density mixed-use development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Melissa |last= Shih |title= Municipal Conformity to the Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe: An Evaluation of Future Density Potential Along the Fairview Street Intensification Corridor in Burlington, Ontario |location= Kingston, ON |publisher= Queens University |year= 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of transit oriented development along these corridors with subsequent increase in transit ridership has been well documented in neighborhoods such as [[Ballston, Arlington, Virginia|Ballston]] and [[Rosslyn, Arlington, Virginia|Rosslyn]] in [[Arlington County, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Urban Form Case Studies |publisher= Ontario Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure |year= 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other cities, such as Portland Oregon, have implemented freeway removal policies to create intensification corridors.  Much of this began in the [[freeway and expressway revolts]] of the 1960s and 1970s.

== Boulevards and urban design ==
[[Portland, Oregon]] and [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] executed freeway removal projects that reduced traffic , spurred economic development, and allowed for the creation of new neighborhoods and commercial districts. The [[Harbor Drive]] Freeway in Portland was replaced by [[Tom McCall Waterfront Park]], while the [[Park East Freeway]] in Milwaukee recovered prime land for development in the urban core.  In [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], the easternmost portion of the [[Gardiner Expressway]], which was located between Don Road and Leslie Street, was demolished in 2000 and replaced with an at-grade urban boulevard with traffic lights, railroad crossings and a [[bike trail]].

After acute damage to San Francisco's double-decked [[Embarcadero Freeway]] occurred during the [[Loma Prieta earthquake]] in 1989, it was demolished, but only after several years' wait &lt;ref&gt;http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Timeline-A-look-back-at-the-Embarcadero-2642356.php, accessed July 19, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and replaced by a boulevard flanked by the restored Beaux-Arts style Ferry Building.&lt;ref&gt;http://streetswiki.wikispaces.com/Embarcadero+Freeway+Removal, accessed July 19, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Underground relocation==
In some situations where removing an urban freeway would exacerbate traffic problems within a city, urban planners may resort to constructing [[tunnel]]s to relocate the freeway underground and reclaim the surface space previously occupied by the facility.

In [[Boston]], Massachusetts, the [[Central Artery]] ([[Interstate 93]]) ran through the center of the city on an elevated green viaduct from its opening in the 1950s until 2005.  The freeway divided historic neighborhoods and business districts in downtown Boston, and it was referred to as Boston's "other [[Green Monster]]."  During the 1990s and early 2000s, a $15 billion project known as the [[Big Dig]] relocated the Central Artery into tunnels underneath downtown Boston; the old viaduct was demolished, and its path was reclaimed for a surface boulevard and park space.

A similar project is underway to replace the crumbling [[Alaskan Way Viaduct]] in [[Seattle]], Washington, with [[Alaskan Way Viaduct replacement tunnel|a tunnel]] that will carry the [[Washington State Route 99|SR-99]] freeway underneath the city.

==Projects==

A '''funeral oration''' or '''''epitaphios logos''''' ({{lang-grc-gre|ἐπιτάφιος λόγος}}) is a formal speech delivered on the ceremonial occasion of a [[funeral]]. Funerary customs comprise the practices used by a culture to remember the dead, from the funeral itself, to various monuments, prayers, and rituals undertaken in their honour. In [[ancient Greece]] and, in particular, in  [[ancient Athens]], the funeral oration was deemed an indispensable component of the funeral ritual.

The ''epitaphios logos'' is regarded as an almost exclusive Athenian creation, although some early elements of such speeches exist in the [[epic poetry|epos]] of Homer and in the [[Lyric poetry|lyric poems]] of [[Pindar]]. [[Pericles' Funeral Oration]] is the earlier extant of the genre.&lt;ref name="Colaiaco"&gt;J.A. Colaiaco, ''Socrates Against Athens'', 75&lt;/ref&gt; The Athenians are those who set the standard and, therefore, [[Demosthenes]] praises them, saying that "you alone of all mankind publicly pronounce over your dead funeral orations, in which you extol the deeds of the brave".&lt;ref name="Leptines"&gt;Demosthenes, ''Against Leptines'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0072&amp;layout=&amp;loc=20.141 141]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Homer and Pindar==
In Homer very few elements of ''epitaphios logos'' or laudation are found. At the funeral of [[Patroclus]] chief in all the mourning is [[Achilles]]; the son of [[Peleus]] laid his bloodstained hand on the breast of his friend and cried, "Fare well Patroklos, even in the house of [[Hades]]. I will now do all that I erewhile promised you; I will drag [[Hector]] hither and let dogs devour him raw; twelve noble sons of Trojans will I also slay before your pyre to avenge you."&lt;ref name="HomerIl19"&gt;Homer, ''The Iliad'', 23, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0217&amp;query=book%3D%2323 19 etc.]&lt;/ref&gt; As he spoke he treated the body of Hector with contumely, laying it at full length in the dust beside the bier of Patroklos.&lt;ref name="HomerIl19" /&gt; At the funeral of Hector the women, [[Andromache]], his mother and Helen, deliver the final public statements over the dead body.&lt;ref name="Foley40"&gt;H. P. Foley, ''Female Acts in Greek Tragedy'', 40&lt;/ref&gt; Andromache laments the loss of her husband with these emotional words:&lt;ref name="HomerIl477"&gt;Homer, ''The Iliad'', 22, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0217&amp;layout=&amp;loc=22.477 477 etc.]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Woe is me, O Hector; woe, indeed, that to share a common lot we were born, you at Troy in the house of Priam, and I at Thebes under the wooded mountain of Plakos in the house of Eetion who brought me up when I was a child - ill-starred sire of an ill-starred daughter - would that he had never begotten me. You are now going into the house of Hades under the secret places of the earth, and you leave me a sorrowing widow in your house. The child, of whom you and I are the unhappy parents, is as yet a mere infant. Now that you are gone, O Hector, you can do nothing for him nor he for you.}}

In the ''Sixth Olympian For Hagesias of Syracuse'', the poet mentions a characteristic example of an [[epitaph]] high praise: "Hagesias, that praise is ready for you, which once Adrastus' tongue rightly spoke for the seer Amphiaraus, son of Oicles, when the earth swallowed up him and his shining horses.  In Thebes, when the seven pyres of corpses had been consumed, the son of Talaus spoke in this way: “I long for the eye of my army, a man who was good both as a prophet and at fighting with the spear.”"&lt;ref name="Pindar"&gt;Pindar, ''Sixth Olympian'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0162&amp;layout=&amp;loc=O.+6.1  15]&lt;/ref&gt; Nicole Loraux observes that the ''epitaphios'' was "born of lyric poetry and in competition with it", since the funeral oratory "uses poetic themes but reinterprets them from a resolutely political perspective".&lt;ref name="Loraux231"&gt;N. Loraux, ''The Invention of Athens'', 231&lt;/ref&gt;

==Athens==
The orator [[Anaximenes of Lampsacus]] claimed that the funeral oration had been originated in the 6th-century BC in Athens by [[Solon]],&lt;ref&gt;Anaximenes, ''Frag.'' 44&lt;/ref&gt; but this is widely doubted by historians.&lt;ref&gt;James P. Sickinger, 1999, ''Public records and archives in classical Athens'', page 30. UNC Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usher"&gt;Stephen Usher, 1999, ''Greek oratory: tradition and originality'', page 349. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; More plausible, but not beyond doubt,&lt;ref name="usher"/&gt; is the statement by [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] that the Athenians instituted the funeral oration "in honour or those who fought at [[Battle of Artemisium|Artemisium]], [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]], and [[Battle of Plataea|Plataea]], and died for their country, or to the glory of their exploits at [[Battle of Marathon|Marathon]]."&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius of Halicarnassus, ''Ant. Rom.'' v. 17. 2-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Thucydides describes in detail the funeral rituals and points out that "the dead are laid in the public sepulchre in the most beautiful suburb of the city, in which those who fall in war are always buried".&lt;ref name="Th2.34"&gt;Thucydides, ''The Peloponnesian War'', 2.[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200&amp;layout=&amp;loc=2.34.1 34]&lt;/ref&gt; This suburb was [[Kerameikos]], where there was a monument for all the Athenians fell in battle, except such of them as fought at Marathon.&lt;ref name="Pausanias"&gt;Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'', 29.[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160&amp;layout=&amp;loc=1.29.1 4]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians now believe that the ''demosion sema'' (a collective burial site for the war dead) and the ''epitaphios logos'' were first established around 470 BC, customs that continued during the Periclean period.&lt;ref name="N95-96"&gt;A.W. Nightingale, ''Genres in Dialogues'', 95-96&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest preserved casualty list, giving the names of those who died fighting for their city in a given year, dates to 490-480 BC and it is associated with the [[battle of Marathon]],&lt;ref&gt;Keesling, C., The Marathon Casualty List from Eua-Loukou and the Plinthedon Style in Attic Inscriptions, Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik, vol. 180 (2012), pp. 139-148&lt;/ref&gt; and white-ground [[lekythos|lekythoi]] depicting funerary scenes started around 470 BC.&lt;ref&gt;J.H. Oakley, ''Bail Oinochoai'', 13&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pericles' Funeral Oration|funeral oration]] of [[Pericles]], as reported by [[Thucydides]], is the earliest ''epitaphios'' presented in full.&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides, II, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0199;query=chapter%3D%23181;layout=;loc=2.36.1/ 35-46]&lt;/ref&gt; The burial of the war dead in the first year of the [[Peloponnesian War]] is regarded as reflecting the fifth-century dominance of the public co-memorial.&lt;ref&gt;K. Derderian, ''Leaving Words to Remember'', 161&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scheme and structure==

Though [[Plato]] is consistently suspicious of the ability of oratory to teach, in the ''[[Menexenus (dialogue)|Menexenus]]'' he demonstrates a theoretical interest in the project of funeral oratory.&lt;ref name="Monoson202"&gt;S. Monoson, ''Plato's Democratic Entanglements'', 202&lt;/ref&gt; He actually describes the scheme of the traditional Athenian funeral oration with the following succinct phrase:&lt;ref name="Menexenus236e"&gt;Plato, ''Menexenus'', 236 [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0180&amp;layout=&amp;loc=Menex.+236e e]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|And the speech required is one which will adequately eulogize the dead and give kindly exhortation to the living, appealing to their children and their brethren to copy the virtues of these heroes, and to their fathers and mothers and any still surviving ancestors offering consolation.}}

Thereby, the traditional ''epitaphios'' must contain: a ''[[eulogy]]'' of the war dead and the city, an ''exhortation'' to the relatives to copy the virtues of the war dead and a ''consolation'' for the living members of their families.&lt;ref name="Helios"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Funeral Oration|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopaedia The Helios]]|year=1952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, the ''epitaphios'' consists of the following parts:
* ''Preamble'', which treats the performance expectations of the audience.&lt;ref name="Derderian181"&gt;K. Derderian, ''Leaving Words to Remember'', 181&lt;/ref&gt; The orator usually asserts that it is almost impossible for him to find words worthy of the glorious achievements of the war dead.&lt;ref name="Helios" /&gt; Such a preamble reveals the position of the ''epitaphios'' as an oral genre within a ritually and socially bounded society.&lt;ref name="Derderian181" /&gt;
*''Origin and ancestors''.
*''The war dead, their self-sacrifice and their devotion to the Athenian Polity''.
*''Epilogue'', which constitutes a consolation and an encouragement for the families of the war dead.&lt;ref name="Helios" /&gt; The epilogue employs a traditional dismissal of the mourners for further private lament, at which point the city's promise of education for the surviving orphans signals the resumption of life in the ''polis''.&lt;ref name="Derderian181" /&gt;

== Function and critics ==

The primary function of the funeral oration was to give public expression to the conception of the potential excellence of [[polis]]. It was an occasion on which Athens "invented" and "reinvented" itself in narrative form.&lt;ref name="Loraux312"&gt;N. Loraux, ''The Invention of Athens'', 312&lt;/ref&gt; The city displayed its achievements, as well as the civic and personal virtues to which the citizens could aspire.&lt;ref name="Monoson202" /&gt; The secular prose of the funeral oration dedicates itself to celebrating the ideal of the democratic Athenian city.&lt;ref&gt;N. Loraux, ''The Children of Athena'', 45&lt;/ref&gt; Through the ''epitaphios'', a civic discourse, the city recognizes itself as it wishes to be.&lt;ref name="Loraux312" /&gt;

It is for this reason that Plato has chosen the funeral oration as a main target of him. In ''Menexenus'' he engages the concerns of funeral oratory and appropriates for philosophy part of the intellectual mission that the Athenians associated with the most celebrated and democratic form of [[epideictic]], the funeral oratory.&lt;ref name="Monoson205"&gt;S. Monoson, ''Plato's Democratic Entanglements'', 205&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extant speeches==

Whereas the ''epitaphios'' originated itself as a public speech composed for a specific occasion, a number of specimens of this genre were not composed for delivery at the public burial. They would have been read to small audiences at the intellectual gatherings that met at so many venues. Gorgias' funeral oration, maybe that of [[Lysias]] and clearly Plato's parodic ''epitaphios'' in ''Menexenus'' were not designed to be delivered before the Athenian people.&lt;ref name="N95-96" /&gt;

The '''Gulbenkian Commission''' sought to address inadequacies in the organization of the [[social sciences|social science]] disciplines that developed in the nineteenth century by indicating a direction for social scientific inquiry for the next 50 years. It was founded by the [[Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation]]. It held three meetings in 1994 and 1995.

== Members ==
Its members included [[Immanuel Wallerstein]] (chair), Calestous Juma, [[Evelyn Fox Keller]], [[Jürgen Kocka]], Dominique Lecourt, [[Valentin Y. Mudimbe]], Kinhide Mushakoji, [[Ilya Prigogine]], Peter J. Taylor, Michel-Rolph Trouillot. Six of them were drawn from the [[social science]]s, two from the [[natural sciences]] and two from the humanities. The commission sought to produce a book length work that would identify new directions for the organization of knowledge in the next fifty years. The report was published in 1996 by [[Stanford University]] as the book, ''Open the Social Sciences'' by [[Immanuel Wallerstein]]. To foster international debate, the report has been published in numerous languages including [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[German language|German]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbocroat]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], and [[Japanese language|Japanese]].

== Debate ==

The ideas in the report have stimulated [[debate]] around the [[world]]. For example, in the Indian Magazine Frontline, Sundar Sarukkai discussed its conclusions and applicability to the [[India]]n context, which he criticizes for being cliquish and unprofessional.&lt;ref&gt;Sarukkai, Sundar (2001). "The Gulbenkian Prognosis", ''Frontline'', 18(22). Retrieved from http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1822/18220900.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 Michael Burawoy, at Berkeley, offered a highly critical perspective: "We hear nothing about how and where this new knowledge will be produced. Nor do we hear for whom this knowledge will be produced, nor for what ends. Instead we have an abstract and totalizing [[utopia]] that reflects the concerns of Western academics, perched high up in the [[ivory tower]], seemingly unaware that the fortress beneath them – supporting them -- was under siege".&lt;ref&gt;Burawoy, Michael (2001). "Open the Social Sciences: To whom and for what?", Portuguese Journal of Social Science, 6(3). Retrieved from http://burawoy.berkeley.edu/PS/Open%20the%20Social%20Sciences.pdf &lt;/ref&gt; This comment was made in spite of the fact that the commission itself included academics from the Caribbean, Africa, and East Asia, as well as Europe and North America. Richard Lee suggests concrete ways that the Commission's goal of breaking down barriers between the disciplines of the social sciences might be achieved.

'''''Hidden Ivies: Thirty Colleges of Excellence'''''  is a college educational guide published in 2000. It focuses on [[college admissions in the United States]].  The authors define both the title of this book as well as their goals in writing it as: "to create greater awareness of the small, distinctive cluster of colleges and universities of excellence that are available to gifted college-bound students."&lt;ref name="greene's"/&gt; In the introduction, the authors further explain their aim by referring specifically to "the group historically known as the '[[Little Ivies]]' (including [[Amherst College|Amherst]], [[Bowdoin College|Bowdoin]], [[Middlebury College|Middlebury]], [[Swarthmore College|Swarthmore]], [[Wesleyan University|Wesleyan]], and [[Williams College|Williams]])" which the authors say have "scaled the heights of prestige and selectivity and also turn away thousands of our best and brightest young men and women."&lt;ref name="greene's"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greene |first1=Howard | first2= Matthew | last2= Greene| url=http://www.harpercollins.com/books/9780060953621/Greenes_Guides_to_Educational_Planning_The_Hidden_Ivies/excerpt.aspx |title=Excerpt from Greenes' Guides to Educational Planning: The Hidden Ivies Thirty Colleges of Excellence by Howard Greene | website=HarperCollins.com |accessdate=2011-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "green"&gt;Greene, Howard and Matthew Greene (2000) ''Greenes' Guides to Educational Planning: The Hidden Ivies: Thirty Colleges of Excellence'', HarperCollins, {{ISBN|0-06-095362-4}}, book description at [http://www.harpercollins.com/global_scripts/product_catalog/book_xml.asp?isbn=0060953624&amp;tc=cx HarperCollins.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050321143927/http://www.harpercollins.com/global_scripts/product_catalog/book_xml.asp?isbn=0060953624&amp;tc=cx |date= 2005-03-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The second edition includes the assessment of all the institutions considered "Little Ivies" except [[Connecticut College]], which is referenced on three occasions in the book for its affiliation and student exchange program with other Little Ivies; the college is included in Appendix II as another college of excellence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1=Greene |first1=Howard | first2= Matthew | last2= Greene |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2613mp_QbBgC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage |title=The Hidden Ivies: 50 Top Colleges-from Amherst to Williams| edition= 2nd |via= books.google.com |accessdate= 2011-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this book, the authors (using the same criteria often used to evaluate [[Ivy League]] schools) discuss 30 American schools that are small in size and are either [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts colleges]] or universities that emulate them. ''The Hidden Ivies: 50 Top Colleges - From Amherst to Williams - That Rival the Ivy League'', the second edition of the guide published in 2009, evaluates 50 "renowned academic institutions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1= Greene |first1=Howard | first2= Matthew | last2= Greene |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=2613mp_QbBgC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage |title=The Hidden Ivies |via=books.google.com |accessdate= 2011-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last1=Greene |first1=Howard | first2= Matthew | last2= Greene |url=http://www.harpercollins.com/books/Hidden-Ivies-2Nd-Edition/?isbn=9780061726729 |title=The Hidden Ivies: 50 Top Colleges—from Amherst to Williams —That Rival the Ivy League  |work= HarperCollins.com |accessdate=2011-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.harpercollins.com/browseinside/index.aspx?isbn13=9780061726729 |title=Browse Inside The Hidden Ivies, 2nd Edition: 50 Top Colleges—from Amherst to Williams —That Rival the Ivy League by Howard Greene, Matthew W.

Nine of the 50 schools in the second edition are located in the [[Midwestern United States]], 24 in the [[Northeastern United States]], 11 in the [[Southern United States]], and six in the [[Western United States]].

==Overview==
''Hidden Ivies'' discusses the college admissions process and attempts to evaluate 63 colleges in comparison to Ivy League colleges. The schools are examined based on academics, admissions process, financial aid, and student experiences. The book argues the importance of a liberal arts education and goes on to inquire about the qualities of Ivy League schools in general, and how such qualities apply to higher education.

The '''history of [[printing]]''' starts as early as 3500 BCE, when the Persian and Mesopotamian civilizations used [[cylinder seal]]s to certify documents written in clay. Other early forms include block seals, pottery imprints and cloth printing. [[Woodblock printing]] on paper originated in China around 200 CE. It led to the development of [[movable type]] in the eleventh century and the spread of book production in East Asia. Woodblock printing was also used in Europe, but it was in the fifteenth century that European printers combined movable type and [[alphabet]]ic scripts to create an economical book publishing industry. This industry enabled the communication of ideas and sharing of knowledge on an unprecedented scale. Alongside the development of text printing, new and lower-cost methods of image reproduction were developed, including [[lithography]], [[screen printing]] and [[photocopying]].

Stencils may have been used to colour cloth for a very long time; the technique probably reached its peak of sophistication in [[Katazome]] and other techniques used on silks for clothes during the [[Edo period]] in Japan.  In Europe, from about 1450 they were commonly used to colour [[old master print]]s printed in black and white, usually [[woodcut]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[A. Hyatt Mayor|Mayor, Hyatt A.]], ''Prints and People'', Metropolitan Museum of Art/Princeton, 1971, no. 51, 65, 80, {{ISBN|0691003262}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was especially the case with playing-cards, which continued to be coloured by stencil long after most other subjects for prints were left in black and white.&lt;ref&gt;[[A.

== Seals == 
[[File:King of Na gold seal.jpg|thumb|The [[King of Na gold seal]], bestowed by [[Emperor Guangwu of Han]] to Wana (Yayoi Japan) in 57 AD.]]

In China seals were used since at least the [[Shang dynasty]]. In the [[Western Zhou]], sets of seal stamps were encased in blocks of type and used on clay moulds for casting bronzes. By the end of the 3rd century BC seals were also used for printing on pottery. In the Northern dynasties textual sources contain references to wooden seals with up to 120 characters.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=909}}

The seals had a religious element to them. [[Daoists]] used seals as healing devices by impressing therapeutic characters onto the flesh of sick people. They were also used to stamp food, creating a talismanic character to ward off disease. The first evidence of these practices appeared under a Buddhist context in the mid 5th century. Centuries later seals were used to create hundreds of Buddha images.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=909}}

== Stone and bronze blocks ==
Stone and bronze blocks have been used to print fabric. Archaeological evidence of them have been unearthed at [[Mawangdui]] and in the tomb of the King of [[Nanyue]], while block printed fabrics have been discovered at Mashan zhuanchang in [[Jiangling County|Jiangling]], [[Hubei]].{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=910}}

In the 4th century the practice of creating paper rubbings of stone carvings such as calligraphic models and texts took hold. Among the earliest evidence of this is a stone inscription cut in mirror image from the early 6th century.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=910}}

{{Main|Woodblock printing}}

Woodblock printing (''diaoban yinshua'' 雕版印刷), known as xylography today, was the first method of printing applied to a paper medium. It became widely used throughout [[East Asia]] both as a method for printing on [[textile]]s and later, under the influence of [[Buddhism]], on [[paper]]. As a method of printing on cloth, the earliest surviving examples from [[China]] date to about 220. ''[[Ukiyo-e]]'' is the best known type of [[Japan]]ese woodblock art print. Most European uses of the technique on paper are covered by the term [[woodcut]] (see below), except for the [[woodblock printing#Block-books in fifteenth century Europe|block-books]] produced mainly in the fifteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Printing Timeline|url=https://printinghistory.org/timeline/|website=American Printing History Association: To Encourage the Study of Printing History|accessdate=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legendary origins===
According to southern Chinese histories, during the 480s, a man named Gong Xuanxuan styled himself Gong the Sage and 'said that a supernatural being had given him a "jade seal jade block writing," which did not require a brush: one blew on the paper and characters formed.'{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=60}} He then used his powers to mystify a local governor. Eventually he was dealt with by the governor's successor, who presumably executed Gong.{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=50}} Timothy Hugh Barrett postulates that Gong's magical jade block was actually a printing device, and Gong was one of the first, if not the first printer. The semi-mythical record of him therefore describes his usage of the printing process to deliberately bewilder onlookers and create an image of mysticism around himself.{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=61}}

===In the Sinosphere===
{{Main|History of printing in East Asia}}

The rise of printing was greatly influenced by [[Mahayana Buddhism]]. According to Mahayana beliefs, religious texts hold intrinsic value for carrying the Buddha's word and act as talismanic objects containing sacred power capable of warding off evil spirits. By copying and preserving these texts, Buddhists could accrue personal merit. As a consequence the idea of printing and its advantages in replicating texts quickly became apparent to Buddhists, who by the 7th century, were using woodblocks to create apotropaic documents. These Buddhist texts were printed specifically as ritual items and were not widely circulated or meant for public consumption. Instead they were buried in consecrated ground. The earliest extant example of this type of printed matter is a fragment of a dhāraṇī (Buddhist spell) miniature scroll written in Sanskrit unearthed in a tomb in [[Xi'an]]. It is called the ''Great spell of unsullied pure light'' (''Wugou jingguang da tuoluoni jing'' 無垢淨光大陀羅尼經) and was printed using woodblock during the Tang dynasty, c. 650-670.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=910}} A similar piece, the ''Saddharma pundarika'' sutra, was also discovered and dated to 690 to 699.&lt;ref name="pan 1997 179 180"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pan |first=Jixing |title=On the Origin of Printing in the Light of New Archaeological Discoveries |journal=Chinese Science Bulletin |year=1997 |volume=42 |issue=12 |pages=976–981 [pp. 979–980] |issn=1001-6538 |doi=10.1007/BF02882611 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This coincides with the reign of [[Wu Zetian]], under which the [[Longer Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra]], which advocates the practice of printing apotropaic and merit making texts and images, was translated by Chinese monks.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=910}}

Evidence of woodblock printing appeared in Korea and Japan soon afterward. [[The Great Dharani Sutra]] ({{lang-ko|무구정광대다라니경|translit=Muggujeonggwang Daedharanigyeong [[Hanja]]: 無垢淨光大陀羅尼經}}) was discovered at [[Bulguksa]], [[South Korea]] in 1966 and dated between 704 and 751 in the era of [[Later Silla]]. The document is printed on a {{convert|8|x|630|cm|abbr=on|adj=on}} [[Paper Mulberry|mulberry]] paper scroll.&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/north-korea/7.htm North Korea&amp;nbsp;— Silla Countrystudies.us] accessed 2009-12-03; [http://www.ifla.org/IV/ifla62/62-yosz.htm ''A History of Writings in Japanese and Current Studies in the Field of Rare Books in Japan''] - 62nd IFLA General Conference, Ifla.org, accessed 009-12-03; [http://www.rightreading.com/printing/gutenberg.asia/gutenberg-asia-9-korea.htm ''Gutenberg and the Koreans: The Invention of Movable Metal Type Printing in Korea''], Rightreading.com, 2006-09-13, accessed 2009-12-03; [http://eng.buddhapia.com/_Service/_ContentView/ETC_CONTENT_2.ASP?pk=0000594295&amp;sub_pk=&amp;clss_cd=0002187369&amp;top_menu_cd=0000000592&amp;Menu_code=0000008846&amp;sub_menu= Cho Woo-suk, ''JoongAng Daily''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719081555/http://eng.buddhapia.com/_Service/_ContentView/ETC_CONTENT_2.ASP?pk=0000594295&amp;sub_pk=&amp;clss_cd=0002187369&amp;top_menu_cd=0000000592&amp;Menu_code=0000008846&amp;sub_menu= |date=2011-07-19 }}, November 22, 2004, Eng.buddhapia.com, accessed 2009-12-03; [http://jikimi.cha.go.kr/newinfo/Culresult_Db_View.jsp?VdkVgwKey=11,01260600,37&amp;queryText=V_KDCD=11 National Treasure No. 126-6], by the Cultural Heritage Administration of South Korea (in Korean), jikimi.cha.go.kr, accessed 2009-12-28; [https://books.google.com/books?id=MziRd4ddZz4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Encyclopedia+of+world+history:+ancient,+medieval,+and+modern%22+by+Peter+N.+Stearns&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Y5dGg9u9uJ&amp;sig=u9uP_DdhfHi8qza6fEK1KldlhQM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=upboTP3MK8Kblge0-6nWCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false National Treasure No. 126-6, by the Cultural Heritage Administration of South Korea (in Korean)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/hightours/diamsutra/index.html The Xiantong era (咸通 Xián tōng) ran from 860-74, crossing the reigns of Yi Zong (懿宗 Yì zōng) and Xi Zong (僖宗 Xī zōng), see [[List of Tang Emperors]]. The book was thus prepared in the time of [[Yi Zong]].&lt;/ref&gt; A dhāraṇī sutra was printed in Japan around AD 770. One million copies of the sutra, along with other prayers, were ordered to be produced by [[Empress Shōtoku]]. As each copy was then stored in a tiny wooden pagoda, the copies are together known as the ''[[Hyakumantō Darani]]'' (百万塔陀羅尼, "1,000,000 towers/pagodas Darani").{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=910}}

The oldest extant evidence of woodblock prints created for the purpose of reading are portions of the [[Lotus Sutra]] discovered at [[Turpan]] in 1906. They have been dated to the reign of Wu Zetian using character form recognition.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=910}}

The oldest text containing a specific date of printing was discovered in the [[Mogao Caves]] of [[Dunhuang]] in 1907 by [[Aurel Stein]]. This copy of the [[Diamond Sutra]] is 14 feet long and contains a [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]] at the inner end, which reads: ''Reverently [caused to be] made for universal free distribution by Wang Jie on behalf of his two parents on the 13th of the 4th moon of the 9th year of Xiantong [i.e. 11 May, AD 868 ]''. It is considered the world's oldest securely-dated woodblock scroll.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=910}}

The Diamond sutra was closely followed by the earliest extant printed almanac, the ''Qianfu sinian lishu'' (乾符四年曆書), dated to 877.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=910}}

From 932 to 955 the [[Thirteen Classics|Twelve Classics]] and an assortment of other texts were printed. During the [[Song dynasty]], the Directorate of education and other agencies used these block prints to disseminate their standardized versions of the ''Classics''. Other disseminated works include the ''Histories'', philosophical works, encyclopedias, collections, and books on medicine and the art of war.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=910}}

In 971 work began on the complete [[Tripiṭaka]] Buddhist Canon (''Kaibao zangshu'' 開寶藏書) in [[Chengdu]]. It took 10 years to finish the 130,000 blocks needed to print the text. The finished product, the [[Sichuan]] edition of the ''Kaibao canon'', also known as the ''Kaibao Tripitaka'', was printed in 983.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=910}}

In 989 [[Seongjong of Goryeo]] sent the monk Yeoga to request from the Song a copy of the complete Buddhist canon. The request was granted in 991 when Seongjong's official Han Eongong visited the Song court.&lt;ref&gt;https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/bitstream/handle/1773/24231/Hyun_washington_0250E_12384.pdf?sequence=1 p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1011, [[Hyeonjong of Goryeo]] issued the carving of their own set of the Buddhist canon, which would come to be known as the ''[[Goryeo Daejanggyeong]]''. The project was suspended in 1031 after Heyongjong's death, but work resumed again in 1046 after [[Munjong of Goryeo|Munjong]]'s accession to the throne. The completed work, amounting to some 6,000 volumes, was finished in 1087. Unfortunately the original set of woodblocks was destroyed in a conflagration during the [[Mongol invasions of Korea|Mongol invasion]] of 1232. King [[Gojong of Goryeo|Gojong]] ordered another set to be created and work began in 1237, this time only taking 12 years to complete. In 1248 the complete ''[[Goryeo Daejanggyeong]]'' numbered 81,258 printing blocks, 52,330,152 characters, 1496 titles, and 6568 volumes. Due to the stringent editing process that went into the ''Goryeo Daejanggyeong'' and its surprisingly enduring nature, having survived completely intact over 760 years, it is considered the most accurate of Buddhist canons written in [[Classical Chinese]] as well as a standard edition for East Asian Buddhist scholarship.&lt;ref name="Memory"&gt;{{cite web|title=Printing woodblocks of the Tripitaka Koreana and miscellaneous Buddhist scriptures|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-7/printing-woodblocks-of-the-tripitaka-koreana-and-miscellaneous-buddhist-scriptures/|website=UNESCO Memory of the World|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Impact of woodblock printing====
Prior to the introduction of printing, the size of private collections in China had already seen an increase since the invention of paper. Fan Ping (215-84) had in his collection 7,000 rolls (''juan''), or a few hundred titles. Two centuries later, Zhang Mian owned 10,000 ''juan'', [[Shen Yue]] (441-513) 20,000 ''juan'', and [[Xiao Tong]] and his cousin Xiao Mai both had collections of 30,000 ''juan''. [[Emperor Yuan of Liang]] (508-555) was said to have had a collection of 80,000 ''juan''. The combined total of all known private book collectors prior to the Song dynasty number around 200, with the Tang alone accounting for 60 of them.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=930}}

Following the maturation of woodblock printing, official, commercial, and private publishing businesses emerged while the size and number of collections grew exponentially. The Song dynasty alone accounts for some 700 known private collections, more than triple the number of all the preceding centuries combined. Private libraries of 10-20,000 ''juan'' became commonplace while six individuals owned collections of over 30,000 ''juan''. The earliest extant private Song library catalogue lists 1,937 titles in 24,501 ''juan''. Zhou Mi's collection numbered 42,000 ''juan'', Chen Zhensun's collection lists 3,096 titles in 51,180 ''juan'', and [[Ye Mengde]] (1077-1148) as well as one other individual owned libraries of 6,000 titles in 100,000 ''juan''. The majority of which were secular in nature. Texts contained material such as medicinal instruction or came in the form of a ''[[leishu]]'' (類書), a type of encyclopedic reference book used to help [[imperial examinations|examination]] candidates.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=910}}{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=930}}

Imperial establishments such as the Three Institutes: Zhaowen Institute, History Institute, and Jixian Institute also followed suit. At the start of the dynasty the Three Institutes' holdings numbered 13,000 ''juan'', by the year 1023 39,142 ''juan'', by 1068 47,588 ''juan'', and by 1127 73,877 ''juan''. The Three Institutes were one of several imperial libraries, with eight other major palace libraries, not including imperial academies.{{sfn|Chia|2011|p=43}} According to Weng Tongwen, by the 11th century, central government offices were saving tenfold by substituting earlier manuscripts with printed versions.{{sfn|Chia|2011|p=21}} The impact of woodblock printing on Song society is illustrated in the following exchange between [[Emperor Zhenzong]] and Xing Bing in the year 1005:

{{quotation|The emperor went to the Directorate of Education to inspect the Publications Office. He asked Xing Bing how many woodblocks were kept there. Bing replied, "At the start of our dynasty, there were fewer than four thousand. Today, there are more than one hundred thousand. The classics and histories, together with standard commentaries, are all fully represented. When I was young and devoted myself to learning, there were only one or two scholars in every hundred who possessed copies of all the classics and commentaries. There was no way to copy so many works. Today, printed editions of these works are abundant, and officials and commoners alike have them in their homes. Scholars are fortunate indeed to have been born in such an era as ours!{{sfn|Chia|2011|p=33}}}}

In 1076, the 39 year old [[Su Shi]] remarked upon the unforeseen effect an abundance of books had on examination candidates:

{{quotation|I can recall meeting older scholars, long ago, who said that when they were young they had a hard time getting their hands on a copy of ''Shiji'' or ''Han shu''. If they were lucky enough to get one, they thought nothing of copying the entire text out by hand, so they could recite it day and night. In recent years merchants engrave and print all manner of books belonging to the hundred schools, and produce ten thousand pages a day. With books so readily available, you would think that students' writing and scholarship would be many times better than what they were in earlier generations. Yet, to the contrary, young men and examination candidates leave their books tied shut and never look at them, preferring to amuse themselves with baseless chatter. Why is this?{{sfn|Chia|2011|p=38}}}}

Woodblock printing also changed the shape and structure of books. Scrolls were gradually replaced by concertina binding (經摺裝) from the Tang period onward. The advantage was that it was now possible to flip to a reference without unfolding the entire document. The next development known as whirlwind binding (''xuanfeng zhuang'' 旋風裝) was to secure the first and last leaves to a single large sheet, so that the book could be opened like an accordion.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=912}}

Around the year 1000, butterfly binding was developed. Woodblock prints allowed two mirror images to be easily replicated on a single sheet. Thus two pages were printed on a sheet, which was then folded inwards. The sheets were then pasted together at the fold to make a [[codex]] with alternate openings of printed and blank pairs of pages. In the 14th century the folding was reversed outwards to give continuous printed pages, each backed by a blank hidden page. Later the sewn bindings were preferred rather than pasted bindings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://idp.bl.uk/IDP/bookbinding/CONCERTINA-FRAMESET.html |title=Dunhuang concertina binding findings |accessdate=2000-03-09 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000309034110/http://idp.bl.uk/IDP/bookbinding/CONCERTINA-FRAMESET.html |archivedate=2000-03-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only relatively small volumes (''[[:wiktionary:菤|juan 卷]]'') were bound up, and several of these would be enclosed in a cover called a ''tao'', with wooden boards at front and back, and loops and pegs to close up the book when not in use. For example, one complete Tripitaka had over 6,400 ''juan'' in 595 ''tao''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nb.no/baser/schoyen/5/5.18/#2540 ]{{dead link|date=December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the productive effect of woodblock printing, historian Endymion Wilkinson notes that it never supplanted handwritten manuscripts. Indeed, manuscripts remained dominant until the very end of Imperial China:

{{quotation|As a result of block-printing technology, it became easier and cheaper to produce multiple copies of books quickly. By the eleventh century, the price of books had fallen by about one tenth what they had been before and as a result they were more widely disseminated. Nevertheless, even in the fifteenth century most books in major libraries were still in manuscript, not in print. Almost to the end of the empire it remained cheaper to pay a copyist than to buy a printed book. Seven hundred and fifty years after the first imperially sponsored printed works in the Northern Song, the greatest book project of the eighteenth century, the ''[[Siku quanshu]]'' 四庫全書, was produced as a manuscript, not as a printed collection. About 4 percent of it was printed in movable type in 1773, but it was hand-carved movable wooden type. Indeed, the entire collection was only printed for the first time in the 1980s. Access to books, especially large works, such as the ''Histories'', remained difficult right into the twentieth century.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=910-911}}|Endymion Wilkinson}}

Not only did manuscripts remain competitive with imprints, they were even ''preferred'' by elite scholars and collectors. The age of printing gave the act of copying by hand a new dimension of cultural reverence. Those who considered themselves real scholars and true connoisseurs of the book did not consider imprints to be real books. Under the elitist attitudes of the time, "printed books were for those who did not truly care about books."{{sfn|Chia|2011|p=41}}

However it should be noted that copyists and manuscript only continued to remain competitive with printed editions by dramatically reducing their price. According to the [[Ming dynasty]] author [[Hu Yinglin]], "if no printed edition were available on the market, the hand-copied manuscript of a book would cost ten times as much as the printed work,"{{sfn|Tsien|1985|p=373}} also "once a printed edition appeared, the transcribed copy could no longer be sold and would be discarded."{{sfn|Tsien|1985|p=373}} The result is that despite the mutual co-existence of hand-copied manuscripts and printed texts, the cost of the book had declined by about 90 percent by the end of the 16th century.{{sfn|Tsien|1985|p=373}} As a result, literacy increased. In 1488, the [[Koreans|Korean]] [[Choe Bu]] observed during his trip to China that "even village children, ferrymen, and sailors" could read, although this applied mainly to the south while northern China remained largely illiterate.{{sfn|Twitchett|1998b|p=636}}

===In India===
Nine inscribed copper plates thought to belong to the mature [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Harappan]] phase (2600 - 1900 BCE), are thought to be used for printing.&lt;ref&gt;Shinde, V. &amp; Willis, R.J., (2014).

In Buddhism, great merit is thought to accrue from copying and preserving texts. The 4th-century{{Fix|text=which?}} master{{Fix|text=who?}} listed the copying of scripture as the first of ten essential religious practices. The importance of perpetuating texts is set out with special force in the [[Infinite Life Sutra|longer Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra]], which urges the devout not only to hear, learn, remember and study the text but to obtain a good copy and to preserve it. This "cult of the book" led to techniques for reproducing texts in great numbers, especially the short prayers or charms known as ''dhāraṇīs''. Stamps were carved for printing these prayers on clay tablets from at least the 7th century, the date of the oldest surviving examples.&lt;ref&gt;Zwalf, ''Buddhism: Art and Faith'' (London: British Museum, 1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Europe===
{{see also|History of Western typography}}
Printing with a press was practiced in Christian Europe as a method for printing on cloth, where it was common by 1300. Images printed on cloth for religious purposes could be quite large and elaborate, and when [[paper]] became relatively easily available, around 1400, the medium transferred very quickly to small [[woodcut]] religious images and [[playing cards]] printed on paper. These [[old master print|prints]] were produced in very large numbers from about 1425 onwards.&lt;ref name="Reference A"&gt;An Introduction to a History of Woodcut, Arthur M. Hind, p ?, Houghton Mifflin Co. 1935 (in USA), reprinted Dover Publications, 1963 {{ISBN|0-486-20952-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=November 2014}}

Around the mid-century, ''block-books'', woodcut books with both text and images, usually carved in the same block, emerged as a cheaper alternative to manuscripts and books printed with [[movable type]]. These were all short heavily illustrated works, the bestsellers of the day, repeated in many different block-book versions: the [[Ars moriendi]] and the [[Biblia pauperum]] were the most common. There is still some controversy among scholars as to whether their introduction preceded or, the majority view, followed the introduction of movable type, with the range of estimated dates being between about 1440–1460.&lt;ref name="Reference B"&gt;Master E.S., Alan Shestack, Philadelphia Museum of Art, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

==Movable type (1041)==

{{Main|Movable type}}
{{See also|History of typography in East Asia}}

'''Movable type''' is the system of [[printing]] and [[typography]] using movable pieces of metal type, made by casting from [[matrix (printing)|matrices]] struck by [[punchcutting|letterpunches]].

===Ceramic movable-type===
Movable-type was invented in the [[Northern Song dynasty]] around the year 1041 by the commoner [[Bi Sheng]]. Bi Sheng's movable-type was fired in [[porcelain]]. After his death, the ceramic movable-type passed onto his descendants. The next mention of movable-type occurred in 1193 when a Southern Song chief counselor, Zhou Bida (周必大), attributed the movable-type method of printing to [[Shen Kuo]]. However Shen Kuo did not invent the movable-type but credited it to Bi Sheng in his ''[[Dream Pool Essays]]''. The ceramic movable-type was also mentioned by [[Kublai Khan]]'s councilor [[Yao Shu]], who convinced his pupil [[Yang Gu]] to print language primers using this method.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=911}}

===Wooden movable type===
Bi Sheng also developed wooden movable type, but it was abandoned in favor of ceramic types due to the presence of wood grains and the unevenness of the wooden type after being soaked in ink.&lt;ref name="tsien"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tsien|first=Tsuen-Hsuin|authorlink=Tsien Tsuen-hsuin|title=Paper and Printing|volume=vol. 5 part 1|series=Needham, Joseph ''Science and Civilization in China:''|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1985|ISBN= 0-521-08690-6|pages=201–217}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shen Kua: Dream Pool Essay&lt;/ref&gt; However wooden movable type had evidently reached the [[Tangut people|Tangut]] [[Western Xia]] to the west by the 12th century. There, the Tanguts printed the [[Auspicious Tantra of All-Reaching Union]], a 449-page text considered to be the earliest extant example of a text printed using the wooden movable type.&lt;ref name="beijing-daily"&gt;{{Cite news |author1 = Hou Jianmei (侯健美) |author2 = Tong Shuquan (童曙泉) |title = 《大夏寻踪》今展国博 |trans-title='In the Footsteps of the Great Xia' now exhibiting at the National Museum |newspaper = [[Beijing Daily]] (《北京日报》) |date = 20 December 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wang Zhen (inventor)|Wang Zhen]], who lived in the [[Yuan dynasty]], also described the wooden movable type in his ''Book of Agriculture'' (''Nongshu'' 農書) of 1313.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=911}}

{{quotation|Now, however, there is another method [beyond earthenware type] that is both more exact and more convenient. A compositor's form is made of wood, strips of bamboo are used to mark the lines and a block is engraved with characters. The block is then cut into squares with a small fine saw till each character forms a separate piece. These separate characters are finished off with a knife on all four sides, and compared and tested till they are exactly the same height and size. Then the types are placed in the columns [of the form] and bamboo strips which have been prepared are pressed in between them. After the types have all been set in the form, the spaces are filled in with wooden plugs, so that the type is perfectly firm and will not move. When the type is absolutely firm, the ink is smeared on and printing begins.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 1 206 207"&gt;Needham, Volume 5, Part 1, 206-207.&lt;/ref&gt;|Wang Zhen}}

Wang Zhen used two rotating circular tables as trays for laying out his type. The first table was separated into 24 trays in which each movable type was categorized based on a number corresponding with a rhyming pattern. The second table contained miscellaneous characters.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=911}}

Using more than 30,000 wooden movable types, Wang Zhen printed a hundred copies of his county gazetteer, ''Records of Jingde County'' (''Jingde xianzhi'' 旌德縣志), a text containing more than 60,000 characters.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=911}}

Wooden movable type printing became relatively common during the [[Ming dynasty]] and became widespread during the [[Qing dynasty|Qing era]].{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=911}}

===Metal movable type===
[[File:SelectedTeachingsofBuddhistSagesandSonMasters1377.jpg|thumb|''Jikji'', ''Selected Teachings of Buddhist Sages and Seon Masters'', the earliest known book printed with movable metal type, 1377. [[Bibliothèque Nationale de France]], Paris.]]

[[File:Beijing.Musee imprimerie.caracteres mobiles.Bisheng.jpg|thumb|Models of Bi Sheng's revolving typecase tables.]]

Metal movable type appeared in the late Song and Yuan. Bronze movable types were used to print [[banknotes]] and official documents by both the Song and [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin]].&lt;ref&gt;Pan Jixing, ''A history of movable metal type printing technique in China 2001'', pp. 41-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Jin dynasty, copper-block prints were slotted with two square holes for embedding bronze movable type characters, each selected from 1000 different characters, such that each printed paper money had a different combination of markers. A copper block printed paper banknote dated between 1215–1216 in the collection of [[Luo Zhenyu]]'s ''Pictorial Paper Money of the Four Dynasties'', 1914, shows two special characters: one called ''Ziliao'', the other called ''Zihao'', for the purpose of preventing counterfeit. Over the ''Ziliao'' there is a small character (輶) printed with movable copper type, while over the ''Zihao'' there is an empty square hole; apparently the associated copper metal type was lost. Another sample of [[Song dynasty]] money of the same period in the collection of [[Shanghai Museum]] has two empty square holes above ''Ziliao'' as well as ''Zihou'', due to the loss of two copper movable types.&lt;ref&gt;''A History of Moveable Type Printing in China'', by Pan Jixing, Professor of the Institute for History of Science, Academy of Science, Beijing, China, English Abstract, p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt;

Metal movable type was received more positively in Korea where its methods were understood sometime before 1232 under [[Goryeo]]. The oldest known book to have been printed by using cast metal type is the ''Sangjeong Gogeum Yemun'', by [[Choe Yun-ui]], in 1234.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Park |first=Hye Ok | date=July 2014 |title=The History of Pre-Gutenberg Woodblock and Movable Type Printing in Korea |trans-title= |url=http://www.ijhssnet.com/journals/Vol_4_No_9_1_July_2014/2.pdf |language=English |journal=International Journal of Humanities and Social Science |volume=4 |issue=9 |pages= |doi= |access-date= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, all 50 original volumes of the book seem to have been lost.

Tin movable type is mentioned in Wang Zhen's ''Zao Huozi Yinshufa'' (造活字印書法) of 1298, but it was considered unsatisfactory due to incompatibility with the inking process.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact of movable type in the Sinosphere===
Movable type printing was hardly used for the first 300 years after its invention by Bi Sheng. Even in Korea where metal movable type was most widespread, it still never replaced woodblock printing. Indeed, even the promulgation of [[Hangeul]] was done through woodblock prints. The general assumption is that movable type did not replace block printing in places that used Chinese characters due to the expense of producing more than 200,000 individual pieces of type. Even woodblock printing was not as cost productive as simply paying a copyist to write out a book by hand if there was no intention of producing more than a few copies. Although [[Sejong the Great]] introduced Hangeul, an alphabetic system, in the 15th century, Hangeul only replaced [[Hanja]] in the 20th century.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=911}} And unlike China, the movable type system was kept mainly within the confines of a highly stratified elite Korean society:

{{quotation|Korean printing with movable metallic type developed mainly within the royal foundry of the Yi dynasty. Royalty kept a monopoly of this new technique and by royal mandate suppressed all non-official printing activities and any budding attempts at commercialization of printing. Thus, printing in early Korea served only the small, noble groups of the highly stratified society.&lt;ref&gt;Sohn, Pow-Key, "Early Korean Printing," ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'', Vol. 79, No. 2 (April -June , 1959), pp.&amp;nbsp;96-103 (103).&lt;/ref&gt;|Sohn Pow-Key}}

Only during the Ming and Qing dynasties did wooden and metal movable types see any considerable use, but the preferred method remained woodblock. Usage of movable type in China never exceeded 10 percent of all printed materials while 90 percent of printed books used the older woodblock technology. In one case an entire set of wooden type numbering 250,000 pieces was used for firewood.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=912}} Woodblocks remained the dominant printing method in China until the introduction of [[lithography]] in the late 19th century.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=909}}

In Japan the use of printing beyond its Buddhist origins was insignificant for centuries after its introduction. Printing of secular materials did not pick up until the late 16th century. The ''Setsuyō-shū'', a two-volume Chinese-Japanese dictionary printed in 1591, was the first secular book to be printed in Japan. Only after [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]'s [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98)|invasions of Korea]], which brought back artisans and printing equipment in 1593, did Japan acquire its own wooden type font. Under [[Emperor Go-Yōzei]]'s orders, the [[Confucian]] ''[[Analects]]'' were printed using metal movable type in 1598. It is generally considered to be the earliest extant Japanese text printed using metal movable type. The popularity of movable type in Japan was short lived. By the 1640s woodblock printing had reasserted itself as the dominant mode of printing in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Sansom, George (1961). "A History of Japan: 1334-1615." Stanford, California: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Controversy====
Traditionally it has been assumed that the prevalence of woodblock printing in East Asia as a result of Chinese characters led to the stagnation of printing culture and enterprise in that region. S. H. Steinberg describes woodblock printing in his ''Five Hundred Years of Printing'' as having "outlived their usefulness" and their printed material as "cheap tracts for the half-literate, ... which anyway had to be very brief because of the laborious process of cutting the letters."{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=10}} John Man's ''The Gutenberg Revolution'' makes a similar case: "wood-blocks were even more demanding than manuscript pages to make, and they wore out and broke, and then you had to carve another one - a whole page at a time."{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=10}}

Recent commentaries on printing in China using contemporary European observers with first hand knowledge complicate the traditional narrative. T. H. Barrett points out that only Europeans who had never seen Chinese woodblock printing in action tended to dismiss it, perhaps due to the almost instantaneous arrival of both xylography and movable type in Europe. The early Jesuit missionaries of late 16th century China, for instance, had a similar distaste for wood based printing for very different reasons. These Jesuits found that "the cheapness and omnipresence of printing in China made the prevailing wood-based technology extremely disturbing, even dangerous."{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=11}} [[Matteo Ricci]] made note of "the exceedingly large numbers of books in circulation here and the ridiculously low prices at which they are sold."{{sfn|Twitchett|1998b|p=637}} Two hundred years later the Englishman John Barrow, by way of the [[Macartney Embassy|Macartney mission]] to Qing China, also remarked with some amazement that the printing industry was "as free as in England, and the profession of printing open to everyone."{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=11}} The commercial success and profitability of woodblock printing was attested to by one British observer at the end of the nineteenth century, who noted that even before the arrival of western printing methods, the price of books and printed materials in [[History of China|China]] had already reached an astoundingly low price compared to what could be found in his home country. Of this, he said:

{{quotation|We have an extensive penny literature at home, but the [[English people|English]] cottager cannot buy anything like the amount of printed matter for his penny that the [[Chinaman (term)|Chinaman]] can for even less. A penny Prayer-book, admittedly sold at a loss, cannot compete in mass of matter with many of the books to be bought for a few [[Cash (Chinese coin)|cash]] in China. When it is considered, too, that a block has been laboriously cut for each leaf, the cheapness of the result is only accounted for by the wideness of sale.{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=14}}}}

Other modern scholars such as Endymion Wilkinson hold a more conservative and skeptical view. While Wilkinson does not deny "China's dominance in book production from the fourth to the fifteenth century," he also insists that arguments for the Chinese advantage "should not be extended either forwards or backwards in time."{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=935}}

{{quotation|European book production began to catch up with China after the introduction of the mechanical printing press in the mid fifteenth century. Reliable figures of the number of imprints of each edition are as hard to find in Europe as they are in China, but one result of the spread of printing in Europe was that public and private libraries were able to build up their collections and for the first time in over a thousand years they began to match and then overtake the largest libraries in China.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=935}}|Endymion Wilkinson}}

It is traditionally surmised that [[Johannes Gutenberg]], of the German city of [[Mainz]], developed European movable type printing technology with the [[printing press]] around 1439&lt;ref name="meggs58-69"/&gt; and in just over a decade, the European age of printing began. However, the evidence shows a more complex evolutionary process, [[Spread of the printing press|spread over multiple locations]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.open2.net/historyandthearts/discover_science/gberg_synopsis.html Review of research by Paul Needham and Blaise Aguera y Arcas at the BBC / Open University]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[Johann Fust]] and [[Peter Schöffer]] experimented with Gutenberg in Mainz.

Compared to [[woodblock printing]], movable type page-setting was quicker and more durable. The metal type pieces were more durable and the lettering was more uniform, leading to typography and [[font]]s. The high quality and relatively low price of the [[Gutenberg Bible]] (1455) established the superiority of movable type, and [[printing press]]es rapidly spread across Europe, leading up to the [[Renaissance]], and later [[spread of the printing press|all around the world]]. Today, practically all movable type printing ultimately derives from Gutenberg's movable type printing, which is often regarded as the most important invention of the second millennium.&lt;ref&gt;In 1997, [[Time Life]] magazine picked Gutenberg's invention to be the most important of the second millennium. In 1999, the A&amp;E Network voted Johannes Gutenberg "Man of the Millennium". See also [http://pirate.shu.edu/~gottlitr/mil_site/lista.html 1,000 Years, 1,000 People: Ranking The Men and Women Who Shaped The Millennium] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012221307/http://pirate.shu.edu/~gottlitr/mil_site/lista.html |date=2007-10-12 }} which was composed by four prominent US journalists in 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gutenberg is also credited with the introduction of an oil-based ink which was more durable than previously used water-based inks. Having worked as a professional [[goldsmith]], Gutenberg made skillful use of his knowledge of metals. He also the first to make his type from an [[alloy]] of lead, tin, and [[antimony]], known as [[type metal]], printer's lead, or printer's metal, which was critical for producing durable type that produced high-quality printed books, and proved to be more suitable for printing than the clay, wooden or bronze types used in East Asia. To create these lead types, Gutenberg used what some considered his most ingenious invention: a special matrix which enabled the moulding of new movable types with an unprecedented precision at short notice. Within a year of printing the Gutenberg Bible, Gutenberg also published the first coloured prints.

The invention of the printing press revolutionized communication and book production, leading to the spread of knowledge. Printing was rapidly spread from Germany by emigrating German printers, but also by foreign apprentices returning home. A printing press was built in [[Venice]] in 1469, and by 1500 the city had 417 printers. In 1470 [[Johann Heynlin]] set up a printing press in [[Paris]]. In 1473 [[Kasper Straube]] published the ''[[Almanach cracoviense ad annum 1474]]'' in [[Kraków]]. [[Dirk Martens]] set up a printing press in [[Aalst, Belgium|Aalst]] ([[Flanders]]) in 1473. He printed a book about the two lovers of [[Enea Piccolomini]] who became [[Pope Pius II]]. In 1476 a printing press was set up in England by [[William Caxton]]. The Italian Juan Pablos set up an imported press in [[Mexico City]] in 1539. The first [[printing press]] in [[Southeast Asia]] was set up in the [[Philippines]] by the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] in 1593. The Rev. Jose Glover intended to bring the first printing press to England's American colonies in 1638, but died on the voyage, so his widow, Elizabeth Harris Glover, established the printing house, which was run by Stephen Day and became The Cambridge Press.&lt;ref&gt;Stowell, Marion B.

The Gutenberg press was much more efficient than manual copying. It remained largely unchanged in the eras of [[John Baskerville]] and [[Giambattista Bodoni]], over 300 years later.&lt;ref name="meggs130-133"&gt;Meggs, Philip B. A History of Graphic Design.

A printing press is a mechanical device for applying pressure to an inked surface resting upon a medium (such as paper or cloth), thereby transferring an image. The systems involved were first assembled in [[Germany]] by the [[goldsmith]] [[Johannes Gutenberg]] in the mid-15th century.&lt;ref name="meggs58-69"&gt;Meggs, Philip B. ''A History of Graphic Design.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. 1998. (pp 58–69) {{ISBN|0-471-29198-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Printing methods based on Gutenberg's printing press spread rapidly throughout first [[Spread of the printing press|Europe and then the rest of the world]], replacing most block printing and making it the sole progenitor of modern movable type printing. As a method of creating reproductions for mass consumption, The printing press has been superseded by the advent of [[offset printing]].

Johannes Gutenberg's work in the printing press began in approximately 1436 when he partnered with Andreas Dritzehen—a man he had previously instructed in gem-cutting—and Andreas Heilmann, owner of a paper mill.&lt;ref name="meggs58-69"/&gt; It was not until a 1439 [[lawsuit]] against Gutenberg that official record exists; witnesses testimony discussed type, an inventory of metals (including lead) and his type mold.&lt;ref name="meggs58-69"/&gt;

Others in Europe were developing movable type at this time, including goldsmith Procopius Waldfoghel of France and [[Laurens Janszoon Coster]] of the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name="meggs58-69"/&gt; They are not known to have contributed specific advances to the printing press.&lt;ref name="meggs58-69"/&gt; While the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]] had attributed the invention of the printing press to Coster, the company now states that is incorrect.&lt;ref name="britannica_web_coster"&gt;''[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-36788/typography Typography - Gutenberg and printing in Germany].''

===Printing houses in Europe===
Early printing houses (near the time of Gutenberg) were run by "master printers." These printers owned shops, selected and edited manuscripts, determined the sizes of print runs, sold the works they produced, raised capital and organized distribution. Some master printing houses, like that of [[Aldus Manutius]], became the cultural center for [[Intellectual|literati]] such as [[Erasmus]].

*Print shop apprentices: Apprentices, usually between the ages of 15 and 20, worked for master printers. Apprentices were not required to be literate, and literacy rates at the time were very low, in comparison to today. Apprentices prepared ink, dampened sheets of paper, and assisted at the press. An apprentice who wished to learn to become a compositor had to learn Latin and spend time under the supervision of a journeyman.
*Journeyman printers: After completing their apprenticeships, ''journeyman''  printers were free to move employers. This facilitated the spread of printing to areas that were less print-centred.
*Compositors: Those who set the type for printing.
*Pressmen: the person who worked the press. This was physically labour-intensive.

The earliest-known image of a European, Gutenberg-style print shop is the ''Dance of Death'' by Matthias Huss, at Lyon, 1499. This image depicts a compositor standing at a compositor's case being grabbed by a skeleton. The case is raised to facilitate his work.  At the right of the printing house a bookshop is shown.

====Financial aspects====
According to court records from the city of Mainz, Johannes Fust was for some time Gutenberg's financial backer. By the 16th century jobs in printing were becoming increasingly specialized. Structures{{clarify|date=June 2017}} supporting publishers were more and more complex, leading to division of labour. In Europe between 1500 and 1700 the role of the Master Printer was dying out and giving way to the bookseller—publisher. During this period, printing had a stronger commercial imperative than previously. Risks associated with the industry however were substantial, although dependent on the nature of the publication.

Bookseller publishers negotiated at trade fairs and at print shops. Jobbing work appeared: some printers performed menial tasks at the beginning of their careers to support themselves.

From 1500–1700 publishers developed several new methods of funding projects:

# Cooperative associations/publication syndicates—a number of individuals shared the risks associated with printing and shared in the profit. This was pioneered by the French.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
# Subscription publishing: pioneered by the English in the early 17th century.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} A prospectus for a publication was drawn up by a publisher to raise funding. The prospectus was given to potential buyers who signed up for a copy. If there were not enough subscriptions the publication did not go ahead. Lists of subscribers were included in the books as endorsements. If enough people subscribed, there might be a reprint. Some authors used subscription publication to bypass the publisher entirely.
# Installment publishing: books were issued in parts until a complete book had been issued. This was not necessarily done within a fixed time period. It was an effective method of spreading the cost over a period of time. It also allowed earlier returns on investment to help cover the production costs of subsequent installments.

The ''Mechanick Exercises'', by Joseph Moxon, in London, 1683, was said to be the first publication in installments.&lt;ref name="serial"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wiles |first1=R. M. |date= |year=2012 |title=Serial Publication in England Before 1750 |trans-title= |url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=SL2gM5RygKwC |access-date=|format= |language=English |location= |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=79 |pages= |isbn= |via= |subscription= |quote= |trans-quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Publishing trade organizations allowed publishers to organize business concerns collectively. These arrangements included systems of self-regulation. For example, if one publisher did something to irritate other publishers he would be controlled by peer pressure. Such systems are known as [[cartel]]s, and are in most countries now considered to be in restraint of trade. These arrangements helped deal with labour unrest among journeymen, who faced difficult working conditions. Brotherhoods predated unions, without the formal regulations now associated with unions.

In most cases, publishers bought the [[copyright]] in a work from the author, and made some arrangement about the possible profits. This required a substantial amount of capital in addition to that needed for the physical equipment and staff. Alternatively, an author with some capital available would sometimes keep the copyright himself, and simply pay the printer to print the book.

====Rotary printing press====
{{Main|Rotary printing press}}
In a rotary printing press, the impressions are carved around a cylinder so that the printing can be done on long continuous rolls of paper, [[Paperboard|cardboard]], [[plastic]], or a large number of other substrates. Rotary drum printing was invented by [[Richard March Hoe]] in 1843 and patented in 1847, and then significantly improved by [[William Bullock (inventor)|William Bullock]] in 1863.

==Intaglio==
[[File:Intaglio-printing.svg|thumb|right|Intaglio printing. The top line is the paper, to which a slightly raised layer of ink adheres; the matrix is beneath]]
{{Main|Intaglio (printmaking)}}
Intaglio ({{IPAc-en|ɪ|n|ˈ|t|æ|l|i|oʊ}}) is a family of [[printmaking]] techniques in which the image is incised into a surface, known as the matrix or plate. Normally, [[copper]] or [[zinc]] plates are used as a surface, and the incisions are created by [[etching]], [[engraving]], [[drypoint]], [[aquatint]] or [[mezzotint]]. [[Collography|Collographs]] may also be printed as intaglio plates.  To print an intaglio plate the surface is covered in thick ink and then rubbed with [[tarlatan]] cloth to remove most of the excess. The final smooth wipe is usually done by hand, sometimes with the aid of newspaper or old public phone book pages, leaving ink only in the incisions. A damp piece of paper is placed on top and the plate and paper are run through a printing press that, through pressure, transfers the ink from the recesses of the plate to the paper.

==Lithography (1796)==
[[File:Litography press with map of Moosburg 02.jpg|thumb|left|Lithography press for printing maps in Munich.]][[File:Lithography stone Princeton motif.jpg|thumb|stone used for a lithograph with a view of [[Princeton University]]
(Collection: Princeton University Library, NJ)]]
{{Main|Lithography}}
Invented by Bavarian author [[Aloys Senefelder]] in 1796,&lt;ref name="meggspage146"&gt;Meggs, Philip B. A History of Graphic Design. ©1998 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. p 146 {{ISBN|0-471-29198-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''lithography''' is a method for printing on a smooth surface. Lithography is a printing process that uses chemical processes to create an image. For instance, the positive part of an image would be a [[hydrophobic]] chemical, while the negative image would be water. Thus, when the plate is introduced to a compatible ink and water mixture, the ink will adhere to the positive image and the water will clean the negative image.  This allows for a relatively flat print plate which allows for much longer runs than the older physical methods of imaging (e.g., embossing or engraving).
High-volume lithography is used today to produce posters, maps, books, newspapers, and packaging — just about any smooth, mass-produced item with print and graphics on it. Most books, indeed all types of high-volume text, are now printed using [[offset lithography]].

In offset lithography, which depends on photographic processes, flexible aluminum, polyester, mylar or paper printing plates are used in place of stone tablets. Modern printing plates have a brushed or roughened texture and are covered with a photosensitive [[emulsion]]. A photographic negative of the desired image is placed in contact with the emulsion and the plate is exposed to ultraviolet light. After development, the emulsion shows a reverse of the negative image, which is thus a duplicate of the original (positive) image. The image on the plate emulsion can also be created through direct laser imaging in a CTP ([[Computer to plate|Computer-To-Plate]]) device called a platesetter. The positive image is the emulsion that remains after imaging. For many years, chemicals have been used to remove the non-image emulsion, but now plates are available that do not require chemical processing.

==Color printing==
{{Main|Colour printing|Woodcut}}
[[File:Uncle Sam Supplying the World with Berry Brothers Hard Oil Finish.jpg|thumb|right|Calvert Lithographic Company, Detroit, MI. ''Uncle Sam Supplying the World with Berry Brothers Hard Oil Finish,'' c. 1880. Noel Wisdom Chromolithograph Collection, Special Collections Department, The University of South Florida Tampa Library.]]
According to Michael Sullivan, the earliest known example of color printing "is a two-color frontispiece to a Buddhist sutra scroll, dated 1346". Color printing continued to be used in China throughout the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing Dynasty]].&lt;ref name="Sullivan"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Sullivan|title=The Arts of China|edition=Third|date=18 June 1984|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-04918-5|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chromolithography]] became the most successful of several methods of [[colour printing]] developed by the 19th century; other methods were developed by printers such as [[Jacob Christoph Le Blon]], [[George Baxter (printer)|George Baxter]] and [[Edmund Evans]], and mostly relied on using several [[woodcut|woodblocks]] with the colors. Hand-coloring also remained important; elements of the official British [[Ordnance Survey]] maps were colored by hand by boys until 1875.  Chromolithography developed from lithography and the term covers various types of lithography that are printed in color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seeing.nypl.org/planographic.html|title=Planographic Printing|date=1999-10-23|accessdate=2014-11-21|publisher=The New York Public Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial technique involved the use of multiple lithographic stones, one for each color, and was still extremely expensive when done for the best quality results. Depending on the number of colors present, a chromolithograph could take months to produce, by very skilled workers.  However much cheaper prints could be produced by simplifying both the number of colors used, and the refinement of the detail in the image.  Cheaper images, like the advertisement illustrated, relied heavily on an initial black print (not always a lithograph), on which colors were then overprinted. To make an expensive reproduction print as what was once referred to as a "’chromo’", a lithographer, with a finished painting in front of him, gradually created and corrected the many stones using proofs to look as much as possible like the painting in front of him, sometimes using dozens of layers.&lt;ref&gt;Clapper, Michael. "'I Was Once a Barefoot Boy!': Cultural Tensions in a Popular Chromo." American Art 16(2002): 16-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aloys Senefelder, the inventor of lithography, introduced the subject of colored lithography in his 1818 ''Vollstaendiges Lehrbuch der Steindruckerey (A Complete Course of Lithography)'', where he told of his plans to print using color and explained the colors he wished to be able to print someday.&lt;ref name="ferry_chromo"&gt;Ferry, Kathryn. "Printing the Alhambra: Owen Jones and Chromolithography." ''Architectural History'' 46(2003): 175–188.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Senefelder recorded plans for chromolithography, printers in other countries, such as [[France]] and [[England]], were also trying to find a new way to print in color. [[Godefroy Engelmann]] of [[Mulhouse]] in France was awarded a patent on chromolithography in July 1837,&lt;ref name="ferry_chromo"/&gt; but there are disputes over whether chromolithography was already in use before this date, as some sources say, pointing to areas of printing such as the production of [[playing card]]s.&lt;ref name="ferry_chromo"/&gt;

==Offset press (1870s)==
{{Main|Offset press}}
Offset printing is a widely used [[printing]] technique where the inked image is transferred (or "offset") from a plate to a rubber blanket, then to the printing surface. When used in combination with the [[Lithography|lithographic]] process, which is based on the repulsion of oil and water, the offset technique employs a flat (planographic) image carrier on which the image to be printed obtains [[ink]] from ink rollers, while the non-printing area attracts a film of water, keeping the non-printing areas ink-free.

==Screenprinting (1907)==
{{Main|Screenprinting}}
Screenprinting has its origins in simple [[stencil]]ling, most notably of the [[Japanese art|Japanese]] form ([[katazome]]), used who cut banana leaves and inserted ink through the design holes on textiles, mostly for clothing. This was taken up in France. The modern screenprinting process originated from patents taken out by Samuel Simon in 1907 in [[England]]. This idea was then adopted in [[San Francisco, California]], by John Pilsworth in 1914 who used screenprinting to form multicolor [[Printmaking|prints]] in a subtractive mode, differing from screenprinting as it is done today.

==Flexography==
{{Main|Flexography}}
[[File:Flexography-Platecloseup.JPG|thumb|right|A flexographic printing plate.]]
Flexography (also called "surface printing"), often abbreviated to "flexo", is a method of [[printing]] most commonly used for packaging (labels, tape, bags, boxes, banners, and so on).

A flexo print is achieved by creating a mirrored master of the required image as a [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] [[relief]] in a [[rubber]] or [[polymer]] material.  A measured amount of [[ink]] is deposited upon the surface of the printing plate (or printing cylinder) using an [[anilox]] roll. The print surface then rotates, contacting the print material which transfers the ink.

Originally flexo printing was basic in quality. Labels requiring high quality have generally been printed Offset until recently. In the last few years great advances have been made to the quality of flexo printing presses.

The greatest advances though have been in the area of PhotoPolymer Printing Plates, including improvements to the plate material and the method of plate creation. —usually [[photography|photographic]] exposure followed by chemical etch, though also by direct [[laser engraving]].

==Photocopier (1960s)==
{{Main|Photocopier}}
Xerographic office photocopying was introduced by [[Xerox]] in the  1960s, and over the following 20 years it gradually replaced copies made by Verifax, [[Photostat]], [[carbon paper]], [[mimeograph machine]]s, and other [[duplicating machines]]. Its availability is one of the factors that rendered undesirable the development of the [[paperless office]] heralded early in the [[digital revolution]].

==Dot matrix printer (1968)==
{{Main|Dot matrix printing}}
A dot matrix printer or impact matrix printer refers to a type of [[computer printer]] with a print head that runs back and forth on the page and prints by impact, striking an ink-soaked cloth ribbon against the paper, much like a [[typewriter]]. Unlike a typewriter or [[daisy wheel printer]], letters are drawn out of a [[dot matrix]], and thus, varied fonts and arbitrary graphics can be produced.  Because the printing involves mechanical pressure, these printers can create [[Carbon copy|carbon copies]] and [[Carbonless copy paper|carbonless copies]].

Each dot is produced by a tiny metal rod, also called a "wire" or "pin", which is driven forward by  the power of a tiny [[electromagnet]] or [[solenoid]], either directly or through small levers (pawls). Facing the ribbon and the paper is a small guide plate (often made of an artificial jewel such as [[sapphire]] or [[ruby]] [http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4194846.html]) pierced with holes to serve as guides for the pins. The moving portion of the printer is called the print head, and when running the printer as a generic text device generally prints one line of text at a time. Most dot matrix printers have a single vertical line of dot-making equipment on their print heads; others have a few interleaved rows in order to improve dot density.

The first dot-matrix [[Printer (computing)|printers]] were invented in Japan.&lt;ref name="kent"&gt;Allen Kent, James G. Williams (1990), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ajpoqYqFrkQC&amp;pg=PA298 ''Encyclopedia of Microcomputers: Volume 6'', page 298], [[CRC Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, Japanese manufacturer [[Epson]] released the [[EP-101]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.dphotographer.co.uk/news/40-years-since-epsons-first-electronic-printer%E2%80%A6/ 40 years since Epson’s first Electronic Printer], Digital Photographer&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://assets.epson-europe.com/eu/epson_eu/about_us.html About Epson], [[Epson]]&lt;/ref&gt; the world's first dot-matrix printer.&lt;ref name="kent"/&gt; The same year, Japanese manufacturer [[OKI (company)|OKI]] introduced the first serial impact dot matrix printer (SIDM), the [[OKI Wiredot]].&lt;ref name="IPSJ_2012"&gt;{{cite web |title=Information Processing Technology Heritage - Wiredot printer |date=2012 |publisher=[[Information Processing Society of Japan]] (IPSJ) |url=http://museum.ipsj.or.jp/en/heritage/Wiredot_printer.html |access-date=2016-10-31 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031182147/http://museum.ipsj.or.jp/en/heritage/Wiredot_printer.html |archive-date=2016-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OKI_2013_1"&gt;{{cite web |title=OKI's Wiredot Printer Receives Information Processing Technology Heritage Certification in Japan |location=Mount Laurel, New Jersey, USA |date=2013-03-14 |url=http://www.okidata.com/oki-datas-wiredot-printer-receives-heritage-certification |access-date=2016-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OKI_2013_2"&gt;{{cite web |title=OKI Printer aus 1968 als technologisch wertvolles Erbe ausgezeichnet |language=German |date=2013-03-26 |url=http://www.oki.at/press-centre/press-releases/detail.aspx?id=tcm:93-153208-16 |access-date=2016-10-31 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031183409/http://www.oki.at/press-centre/press-releases/detail.aspx?id=tcm%3A93-153208-16 |archive-date=2016-10-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thermal printer==
{{Main|Thermal printer}}
A thermal printer (or direct thermal printer) produces a printed image by selectively heating coated [[thermochromic paper]], or [[thermal paper]] as it is commonly known, when the paper passes over the thermal [[Computer printer|print head]]. The coating turns [[black]] in the areas where it is heated, producing an image.

==Laser printer (1969)==

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Pa 1977 9700-medium.jpg|right|thumb|left|Xerox 9700 laser printer (ca. 1977)]] --&gt;
The laser printer, based on a modified xerographic copier, was invented at [[Xerox]] in 1969 by researcher [[Gary Starkweather]], who had a fully functional networked printer system working by 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Milestones in Computer Science and Information Technology | author = Edwin D.

The first commercial implementation of a laser printer was the [[IBM]] [[IBM model 3800 laser printer|model 3800]] in 1976, used for high-volume printing of documents such as invoices and mailing labels. It is often cited as "taking up a whole room," implying that it was a primitive version of the later familiar device used with a [[personal computer]]. While large, it was designed for an entirely different purpose. Many 3800s are still in use.

The first laser printer designed for use with an individual computer was released with the [[Xerox Star]] 8010 in 1981. Although it was innovative, the Star was an expensive ($17,000) system that was only purchased by a small number of laboratories and institutions. After [[personal computer]]s became more widespread, the first laser printer intended for a mass market was the [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] [[LaserJet]] 8ppm, released in 1984, using a [[Canon (company)|Canon]] engine controlled by HP software. The HP LaserJet printer was quickly followed by other laser printers from [[Brother Industries]], IBM, and others.

Most noteworthy was the role the laser printer played in popularizing [[desktop publishing]] with the introduction of the [[Apple Computer|Apple]] [[LaserWriter]] for the Apple [[Macintosh]], along with [[Adobe PageMaker|Aldus PageMaker]] software, in 1985. With these products, users could create documents that would previously have required professional [[typesetting]].

==Inkjet printer==
{{Main|Inkjet printer}}
Inkjet printers are a type of [[computer printer]] that operates by propelling tiny droplets of liquid [[ink]] onto paper.

==Dye-sublimation printer==
{{Main|Dye-sublimation printer}}
A dye-sublimation printer (or dye-sub printer) is a [[computer printer]] which employs a printing process that uses heat to transfer dye to a medium such as a plastic card, printer paper or poster paper.  The process is usually to lay one color at a time using a ribbon that has color panels. Most dye-sublimation printers use CMYO colors which differs from the more recognised [[CMYK]] colors in that the black dye is eliminated in favour of a clear overcoating. This overcoating (which has numerous names depending on the manufacturer) is effectively a thin laminate which protects the print from discoloration from UV light and the air while also rendering the print water-resistant. Many [[consumer]] and [[professional]] dye-sublimation printers are designed and used for producing [[photograph]]ic prints.

==Digital press (1993)==
{{Main|Digital printing}}

Digital printing is the reproduction of [[digital images]] on a physical surface, such as [[paper|common]] or [[photographic paper]] or paperboard-cover stock, [[photographic film|film]], [[cloth]], [[plastic]], [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]], [[magnets]], [[labels]] etc.

It can be differentiated from [[Lithograph|litho]], [[flexography]], [[gravure]] or [[letterpress]] printing in many ways, some of which are;
* Every impression made onto the paper can be different, as opposed to making several hundred or thousand impressions of the same image from one set of printing plates, as in traditional methods.
* The [[Ink]] or [[Toner]] does not absorb into the substrate, as does conventional ink, but forms a layer on the surface and may be fused to the substrate by using an inline fuser fluid with heat process (toner) or UV curing process (ink).
* It generally requires less waste in terms of chemicals used and paper wasted in set up or makeready (bringing the image "up to color" and checking position).
* It is excellent for rapid prototyping, or small print runs which means that it is more accessible to a wider range of designers and more cost effective in short runs.

==Frescography (1998)==
[[File:Comersee Spalier rgb.jpg|thumb|300px|With CAM-program created Frescography]]   
[[File:Frescography.jpg|thumb|left|Screenshot of a CAM program for designing frescographies.]]{{Main|Frescography}}   
'''Frescography''' is a method for reproduction/creation of [[mural]]s using [[digital printing]] methods, invented in 1998 by [[Rainer Maria Latzke]], and patented in 2000. The frescography is based on digitally cut-out motifs which are stored in a [[database]]. [[Computer aided mural|CAM]] software programs then allow to enter the measurements of a wall or ceiling to create a mural design with [[low resolution]] motifs. Since architectural elements such as beams, windows or doors can be integrated, the design will result in an accurately and tailor-fit wall [[mural]]. Once a design is finished, the [[low resolution]] motifs are converted into the original [[high resolution]] images and are printed on canvas by [[Wide-format printer]]s. The canvas then can be applied to the wall in a [[wall-paper]]hanging like procedure and will then look like on-site created mural.

==3D printing==
{{Main|3D printing}}
Three-dimensional printing is a method of converting a virtual [[3D model]] into a physical object. 3D printing is a category of [[rapid prototyping]] technology. 3D printers typically work by 'printing' successive layers on top of the previous to build up a three dimensional object. 3D printers are generally faster, more affordable and easier to use than other additive fabrication technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ptonline.com/articles/200408cu3.html |title=Close-Up On Technology - 3D Printers Lead Growth of Rapid Prototyping - 08/04&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2007-09-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100123144538/http://www.ptonline.com/articles/200408cu3.html |archive-date=2010-01-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technological developments==

===Woodcut===
{{main|Woodcut}}
Woodcut is a [[relief printing]] artistic technique in printmaking in which an image is carved into the surface of a block of wood, with the printing parts remaining level with the surface while the non-printing parts are removed, typically with gouges. The areas to show 'white' are cut away with a knife or chisel, leaving the characters or image to show in 'black' at the original surface level. The block is cut along the grain of the wood (unlike [[wood engraving]] where the block is cut in the end-grain). In Europe [[beech]]wood was most commonly used; in Japan, a special type of [[cherry]] wood was popular.

Woodcut first appeared in ancient China. From 6th century onward, woodcut icons became popular and especially flourished in [[Chinese Buddhism]]. Since the 10th century, woodcut pictures appeared as illustrations in Chinese books, on [[banknote]]s such as [[Jiaozi (currency)]], and as single sheet images. Woodcut [[New Year picture]]s are also very popular with the Chinese.

In China and Tibet printed images mostly remained tied as illustrations to accompanying text until the modern period. The earliest woodblock printed book, the [[Diamond Sutra]] contains a large image as frontispiece, and many Buddhist texts contain some images. Later some notable Chinese artists designed woodcuts for books, the individual print develop in China in the form of [[New Year picture]] as an art-form in the way it did in Europe and Japan.

In Europe, woodcut is the oldest technique used for [[old master print]]s, developing about 1400, by using on paper existing techniques for printing on cloth. The explosion of sales of cheap woodcuts in the middle of the century led to a fall in standards, and many [[popular prints]] were very crude. The development of [[hatching]] followed on rather later than in [[engraving]]. [[Michael Wolgemut]] was significant in making German woodcut more sophisticated from about 1475, and [[Erhard Reuwich]] was the first to use cross-hatching (far harder to do than in engraving or [[etching]]). Both of these produced mainly book-illustrations, as did various Italian artists who were also raising standards there at the same period. At the end of the century [[Albrecht Dürer]] brought the Western woodcut to a level that has never been surpassed, and greatly increased the status of the ''single-leaf'' (i.e. an image sold separately) woodcut.

===Engraving===
{{Main|Engraving}}
Engraving is the practice of incising a design onto a hard, flat surface, by cutting grooves into it. The result may be a decorated object in itself, as when [[silver]], [[gold]] or [[steel]] are engraved, or may provide an [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] printing plate, of [[copper]] or another metal, for printing images on paper, which are called engravings. Engraving was a historically important method of producing images on paper, both in artistic [[printmaking]], and also for commercial reproductions and illustrations for books and magazines. It has long been replaced by [[photography]] in its commercial applications and, partly because of the difficulty of learning the technique, is much less common in printmaking, where it has been largely replaced by [[etching]] and other techniques. Other terms often used for engravings are ''copper-plate engraving'' and ''[[Line engraving]]''. These should all mean exactly the same, but especially in the past were often used very loosely to cover several printmaking techniques, so that many so-called engravings were in fact produced by totally different techniques, such as etching.

In [[Ancient history|antiquity]], the only engraving that could be carried out is evident in the shallow grooves found in some jewellery after the beginning of the 1st Millennium B.C. The majority of so-called engraved designs on ancient gold rings or other items were produced by [[chasing (metalworking)|chasing]] or sometimes a combination of [[lost-wax casting]] and chasing.

In the European Middle Ages goldsmiths used engraving to decorate and inscribe metalwork. It is thought that they began to print impressions of their designs to record them. From this grew the engraving of copper printing plates to produce artistic images on paper, known as [[old master print]]s in Germany in the 1430s. Italy soon followed. Many early engravers came from a goldsmithing background. The first and greatest period of the engraving was from about 1470 to 1530, with such masters as [[Martin Schongauer]], [[Albrecht Dürer]], and [[Lucas van Leiden]].

===Etching===
{{Main|Etching}}
Etching is the process of using strong acid or mordant to cut into the unprotected parts of a metal surface to create a design in intaglio in the metal (the original process—in modern manufacturing other chemicals may be used on other types of material). As an intaglio method of printmaking it is, along with engraving, the most important technique for [[old master print]]s, and remains widely used today.

===Halftoning===
{{Main|Halftone}}
Halftone is the [[reprographic]] technique that simulates ones it is [[continuous tone]] imagery through the use of equally spaced dots of varying size.&lt;ref name="campbell"&gt;Campbell, Alastair. The Designer's Lexicon. ©2000 Chronicle, San Francisco.&lt;/ref&gt; 'Halftone' can also be used to refer specifically to the image that is produced by this process.&lt;ref name="campbell"/&gt;

The idea of halftone printing originates from [[William Fox Talbot]]. In the early 1850s he suggested using "photographic screens or veils" in connection with a photographic [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] process.&lt;ref name=twyman1970&gt;Twyman, Michael. Eyre &amp; Spottiswoode, London 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several different kinds of screens were proposed during the following decades, but the first half-tone photo-engraving process was invented by Canadians George-Édouard Desbarats and William Leggo Jr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DCB |last=Galarneau |first=Claude |title=Desbarats, George-Édouard-Amable |volume=12 |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/desbarats_george_edouard_12E.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 30, 1869, Desbarats published the ''Canadian Illustrated News'' which became the world's first periodical to successfully employ this photo-mechanical technique; featuring a full page half-tone image of His Royal Highness Prince Arthur, from a photograph by Notman.[https://web.archive.org/web/20080523101009/http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/cin/026019-119.01-e.php] Ambitious to exploit a much larger circulation, Debarats and Leggo went to New York and launched the ''New York Daily Graphic'' in March 1873, which became the world's first illustrated daily.

The first truly successful commercial method was patented by [[Frederic Eugene Ives|Frederic Ives]] of [[Philadelphia]] in 1881.&lt;ref name="twyman1970"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meggs (1998), 141.&lt;/ref&gt; But although he found a way of breaking up the image into dots of varying sizes he did not make use of a screen. In 1882 the German [[George Meisenbach]] patented a halftone process in England. His invention was based on the previous ideas of Berchtold and Swan. He used single lined screens which were turned during exposure to produce cross-lined effects. He was the first to achieve  any commercial success with [[relief print|relief]] halftones.&lt;ref name=twyman1970/&gt;

===Xerography===
{{Main|Xerography}}
Xerography (or electrophotography) is a [[photocopying]] technique developed by [[Chester Carlson]] in 1938 and [[patent]]ed on October 6, 1942. He received {{US patent|2297691}} for his [[invention]]. The name xerography came from the Greek radicals ''xeros'' (dry) and ''graphos'' (writing), because there are no liquid chemicals involved in the process, unlike earlier reproduction techniques like [[cyanotype]].

In 1938 [[Bulgaria]]n [[physicist]] [[Georgi Nadjakov]] found that when placed into electric field and exposed to light, some dielectrics acquire permanent electric polarization in the exposed areas.[https://web.archive.org/web/20071101024139/http://www.issp.bas.bg/lab/ephi/Museum/acad_GNadjakov/GN11-page5.html] That polarization persists in the dark and is destroyed in light.
[[Chester Carlson]], the inventor of photocopying, was originally a [[patent attorney]] and part-time researcher and inventor. His job at the patent office in [[New York City]] required him to make a large number of copies of important papers. Carlson, who was [[arthritis|arthritic]], found this a painful and tedious process. This prompted him to conduct experiments with [[photoconductivity]]. Carlson experimented with "[[electrophotography]]" in his kitchen and in 1938, applied for a patent for the process. He made the first "photocopy" using a [[zinc]] plate covered with [[sulfur]]. The words "10-22-38 Astoria" were written on a [[microscope]] slide, which was placed on top of more sulfur and under a bright light. After the slide was removed, a mirror image of the words remained. Carlson tried to sell his invention to some companies, but because the process was still underdeveloped he failed. At the time multiple copies were made using carbon paper or duplicating machines and people did not feel the need for an electronic machine. Between 1939 and 1944, Carlson was turned down by over 20 companies, including [[IBM]] and [[General Electric|GE]], neither of which believed there was a significant market for copiers.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

{{Nihongo|'''Hyozo Omori'''|大森 兵蔵|Ōmori Hyōzō|March 14, 1876 – January 3, 1913}} was a Japanese physical education specialist who studied in America and married the American artist [[Annie Shepley Omori|Annie Barrows Shepley]]. In Japan, they established ''Yurin En'' (House of the Friendly Neighbor), which was a settlement house and leader in the Japanese playground movement. Omori introduced basketball and volleyball to the country and was the team manager at the [[1912 Summer Olympics|1912 Stockholm Olympics]] in Sweden.

==Education==
Hyozo Omori was in the 1905 class of [[Stanford University]]{{r|Stanford}} and then continued his studies in Springfield, Massachusetts as a YMCA exchange student.{{r|Basketball}} He graduated from YMCA's College in Springfield{{r|Japan at Olympics}} with honors in 1907.{{r|Am Gym}}

==Marriage and career==
In October 1907, Omori married artist [[Annie Shepley Omori|Annie Barrows Shepley]].{{r|ws}} In 1908, when he had returned to Japan, he introduced volleyball and basketball to the country{{r|Basketball}}{{r|Japan at Olympics}} and became known as the "Father of Japanese Basketball".{{r|Better late}} In Tokyo, the Omoris established a [[settlement movement|settlement house]], ''Yurin En'' (House of the Friendly Neighbor) which offered dramatic classes and a playground for children. It also offered courses in sewing, flower arranging, cooking, and crafts as well as mother's meetings and opportunities for people to speak English.{{r|Jordan}}{{r|Survey}} Initially, they met resistance because of their co-educational programs, the fact that the Omoris were Christian, and that they broke down well-establish class barriers.{{r|Jordan}} The ''Yurin En'' was at the forefront of the Japanese playground movement.{{r|Japan at Olympics}}{{r|NRA}}

In 1909, Omori was the Physical Director for the Japanese Association. That year, he wrote "A Brief Survey of the Present Conditions of Physical Education in Japan" for ''Hygiene and Physical Education''.{{r|Hastings}}

Hyozo Omori was a physical education specialist and team manager for the Japanese team that competed in the [[1912 Summer Olympics|1912 Stockholm Olympics]] in Sweden. [[Yahiko Mishima]] from Tokyo Imperial University (now University of Tokyo) ran short distances and [[Shizo Kanakuri]], a 20-year-old Tokyo Higher Normal School student ran the marathon. Judo master [[Kanō Jigorō]] was the leader of the team. It was the first time that Japanese runners competed in the Olympics. Omori became quite ill when the group arrived in Stockholm following the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] trip.{{r|Better late}}

Hyozo Omori died in 1913, and Annie continued running ''Yurin En'' after his death.{{r|Jordan}}{{r|NRA}}

[[File:Examples of Ibid, from "Justice" by Michael J- Sandel 2013-04-08 20-17.jpg|thumbnail|An example of Ibid. citations in use, from "Justice" by [[Michael J. Sandel]].]]

'''Ibid''' is an abbreviation for the [[Latin]] word ''[[wikt:ibidem#Latin|ibīdem]]'', meaning "in the same place", commonly used in an [[endnote]], [[footnote]], [[bibliography]] [[citation]], or [[reference#Scholarship|scholarly reference]] to refer to the [[Source text|source]] cited in the preceding note or list item. This is similar to ''[[wikt:idem#Latin|īdem]]'', literally meaning "the same", abbreviated ''Id.'', which is commonly used in [[legal citation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/idem |title=Idem|publisher=thefreedictionary.com |accessdate=11 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibid. may also be used in the Harvard (name-date) system for in-text references where there has been a close previous citation from the same source material.&lt;ref&gt;Chicago Manual of Style Online, (13.64).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New Hart's Rules, Oxford University Press, 2005, p.396&lt;/ref&gt; The previous reference should be immediately visible, e.g. within the same paragraph or page. Some academic publishers now prefer that "ibid." not be italicized, as it is a commonly found term.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., {{cite web |url= http://www.cambridge.org/us/notesforauthors/cambridge_style.doc |title=Style sheet: Cambridge University Press |format=DOC |date=2013 |website= |publisher= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since ibid. is an [[abbreviation]] where the last two letters of the word are omitted, it takes a full stop (period) in both British and American usage.

==Example==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:[1] E. Vijh, ''Latin for Dummies'' (New York: Academic, 1997), 23.
:[2] Ibid.
:[3] Ibid., 29.
:[4] A. Alhazred, ''The Necronomicon'' (Petrus de Dacia, 1994).
:[5] Ibid. 1, 34.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Reference 2 is the same as reference 1: E. Vijh, ''Latin for Dummies'' on page 23, whereas reference 3 refers to the same work but at a different location, namely page 29. Intervening entries require a reference to the original citation in the form Ibid. &lt;citation #&gt;, as in reference 5.

==Cultural references==

* Ibid. is used in the 1960s play ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?]]'' by [[Edward Albee]]. Albee uses an unabbreviated ibid{{huh|date=April 2017}} in his stage directions to tell an actor to use the same tone as the previous line.
* In the 1989 book ''Pyramids'' by [[Terry Pratchett]], one of the Ephebian philosophers is called "Ibid".

{{Data Visualization}}
'''Information design''' is the practice of presenting information in a way that fosters efficient and effective understanding of it. The term has come to be used specifically for [[graphic design]] for displaying information effectively, rather than just attractively or for artistic expression. Information design is closely related to the field of [[data visualization]] and is often taught as part of graphic design courses.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.design.ccsu.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;

Information design is explanation design. It explains facts of the universe and leads to knowledge and informed action.&lt;ref&gt;Per Mollerup,  Data Design: Visualising quantities, locations, connections, Bloomsbury Academic, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term 'information design' emerged as a [[interdisciplinary|multidisciplinary]] area of study in the 1970s. Some [[graphic designer]]s started to use the term, and it was consolidated with the publication of the ''Information Design Journal'' in 1979, and later with the setting up of the related International Institute for Information Design (IIID) in 1987 and  [[Information Design Association]] (IDA) in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.robwaller.org/IDA_origins_RW.pdf |title=The Origins of the Information Design Association |publisher=University of Reading |year=2008 |accessdate=2013-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1982, [[Edward Tufte]] produced a book on information design called ''The Visual Display of Quantitative Information''.
The term [[information graphics]] tends to be used by those primarily concerned with diagramming and display of quantitative information.

In [[technical communication]], information design refers to creating an information structure for a set of information aimed at specified audiences. It can be practiced on different scales.
* On a large scale, it implies choosing relevant content and dividing it into separate manuals by audience and purpose.
* On a medium scale, it means organizing the content in each manual and making sure that overviews, concepts, examples, references, and definitions are included and that topics follow an organizing principle.
* On a fine scale, it includes logical development of topics, emphasis on what's important, clear writing, navigational clues, and even page design, choice of font, and use of white space.
Similar skills for organization and structure are brought to bear in designing [[web site]]s, with additional constraints and functions that earn a designer the title information architect.
In [[computer science]] and [[information technology]], 'information design' is sometimes a rough synonym for (but is not necessarily the same discipline as) [[information architecture]], the design of [[information system]]s, [[database]]s, or [[data structure]]s.  This sense includes [[data modeling]] and [[process analysis]].
{{Citation needed span|text=In the United States, the title of information designer is sometimes used by graphic designers who specialize in creating websites.|date=April 2018|reason=}} The skill set of the information designer, as the title is applied more globally, is closer to that of the [[information architecture|information architect]] in the U.S.

==Early examples==
[[Image:Minard.png|thumb|350px|[[Charles Joseph Minard]]'s 1861 diagram of [[French invasion of Russia|Napoleon's March]] - an early example of an information graphic.]]
Information design is associated with the age of technology but it does have historical roots. Early instances of modern information design include these effective examples:
* [[William Playfair]]'s [[line chart|line]], [[bar chart|bar]], [[pie chart|pie]], and [[area chart]]s illustrating England's trade (1786 and 1801)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anychart.com/blog/2015/12/23/first-area-charts-history/ |title=First Ever Area Charts Created 200+ Years Ago |publisher=AnyChart|accessdate=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tufte&gt;{{cite book|last=Tufte|first=Edward|author-link=Edward Tufte|title=The Visual Display of Quantitative Information|year=1983|publisher=Graphics Press|location=Cheshire, Connecticut|ISBN=0961392142}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]]'s spot maps, which pinpointed the source of a deadly cholera outbreak in 1850s London&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crosier|first1=Scott|title=John Snow: The London Cholera Epidemic of 1854|url=http://webprojects.oit.ncsu.edu/project/bio183de/Black/science/science_reading/8.html|publisher=University of California, Santa Barbara}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Charles Joseph Minard]]'s 1861 diagram depicting Napoleon's Russian campaign of 1812&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Corbett|first1=John|title=Charles Joseph Minard: Mapping Napoleon's March, 1861|url=http://www.csiss.org/classics/content/58|publisher=Center for Spatially Integrated Social Science|accessdate=21 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Otto Neurath]]'s [[Isotype (pictograms)|International Picture Language]] of the 1930s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Popova|first=Maria|title=The Invention of ISOTYPE: How a Vintage Visual Language Paved the Way for the Infographics Age|url=https://www.brainpickings.org/2011/03/08/the-transformer-isotype/|publisher=Brain Pickings|accessdate=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Florence Nightingale]]'s information graphic depicting army mortality rates&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Small|first1=Hugh|title=Florence Nightingale's statistical diagrams|url=http://www.florence-nightingale-avenging-angel.co.uk/GraphicsPaper/Graphics.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Minard diagram shows the losses suffered by Napoleon's army in the 1812-1813 period. Six variables are plotted: the size of the army, its location on a two-dimensional surface (x and y), time, direction of movement, and temperature. This multivariate display on a two dimensional surface tells a story that can be grasped immediately while identifying the source data to build credibility.  [[Edward Tufte]] wrote in 1983 that: "It may well be the best statistical graphic ever drawn."&lt;ref name=Tufte /&gt;

==Applications==
[[File:DALY disability affected life year infographic.svg|thumb|A visual definition of [[Disability Adjusted Life Year]]]]
[[File:Bangalore Outbound Trains Frequency Chart.png|thumb|350px|Visualization of the frequency of outbound trains from [[Bangalore]], [[India]]. Based on the work of [[Étienne-Jules Marey]]]]
Information design can be used for broad audiences (such as signs in airports) or specific audiences (such as personalized telephone bills).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Information Design FAQ|url=http://www.bogieland.com/infodesign_faq.htm|accessdate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The resulting work often seeks to improve a user's trust of a product (such as medicine packaging inserts, operational instructions for industrial machinery and information for emergencies).

Governments and regulatory authorities have legislated about a number of information design issues, such as the minimum size of type in financial small print, the labeling of ingredients in processed food, and the testing of medicine labeling. Examples of this are the [[Truth in Lending Act]] in the USA, which introduced the [[Schumer box]] (a concise summary of charges for people applying for a credit card), and the Guideline on the Readability of the Labelling and Package Leaflet of Medicinal Products for Human Use (European Commission, Revision 1, 12 January 2009).

Professor [[Edward Tufte]] explained that users of information displays are executing particular ''analytical tasks''  such as making comparisons or determining causality. The ''design principle'' of the information graphic should support the analytical task, showing the comparison or causality.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9Y4SxgfGCg Edward Tufte-Presentation-August 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

Simplicity is a major concern in information design. The aim is clarity. Simplification of messages may imply quantitative reduction but is not restricted to that. Sometimes more
information means more clarity. Also, simplicity is a highly subjective matter and should always be evaluated with the information user in mind. Simplicity can be easy when following five simple steps when it comes to information design: 1. Tell the truth, 2. Get to the point, 3. Pick the right tool for the job, 4. Highlight what is important, 5. Of course, keep it simple. These steps will help an information designer narrow down results, as well as keeping their audience engaged. &lt;ref&gt;Duarte, Nancy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7211">{{Fiqh |hygiene}}

'''Islamic hygienical jurisprudence''' includes a number of regulations involving cleanliness during [[Salah|''salat'']] (obligatory prayer) through [[Wudu]] and [[Ghusl]], as well as [[Islamic dietary laws|dietary laws]] and [[Islamic toilet etiquette|toilet etiquette]] for [[Islam|Muslims]]. The ''fiqh'' is based on admonitions in the [[Qur'an]] for Muslims to be ritually clean whenever possible, as well as in [[Hadith|hadith]] (words, actions, or habits of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]]). 

Cleanliness is an important part of Islam, including Qur'anic verses that teach how to achieve [[Ritual purification|ritual cleanliness]]. Keeping [[oral hygiene]] through cleaning the [[Tooth|teeth]] with the use of a form of [[toothbrush]] called [[miswak]] is considered [[sunnah]], the way of Prophet [[Muhammad]]. Ritual [[Ritual purification|ablution]] is also very important, as observed by the practices of [[wudu]] (partial ablution), [[ghusl]] (full ablution), and [[tayammum]] (water-free alternative using any natural surface such as rock, sand, or dust). 

In Muslim countries, bathrooms are often equipped with a [[Muslim shower]] situated next to the toilet, so that individuals may wash themselves properly. This [[Ritual purification|ablution]] is required in order to maintain ritual cleanliness.  The common Muslims practice of taking off shoes when entering mosques and homes is also based on ritual cleanliness.

==Islamic cleanliness and hygiene==
[[Sunni Islam]] has its own hygienical jurisprudence. It is preferable for a Sunni Muslim to remove the hair directly below the navel and under the arms also as trimming the nails once a week. Leaving hair and nails is permissible after 15 days and disliked after 40 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sunnah.com/urn/204970|title=Hadith - The Book of Purification  - Sahih Muslim - Sunnah.com - Sayings and Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.sunnah.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best day for removing needless hair and cutting nails is Friday. It is permissible to use shaving cream to remove needless hair. Needless hair and nails should be buried to prevent illnesses from spreading. Cutting [[eyebrow]]s is permissible if they are too long. Sunni women should put their nails and hair removed from the head, below the navel and under the arms in a place where no non-permissible man can see it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sunnah of Trimming Hair / Nails - ZIKR|url = http://www.zikr.co.uk/content/view/69/110/|website = www.zikr.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Personal grooming]] is also a matter of focus in Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islamqa.info/en/9037|title=Ruling on trimming hair|work=Islam QA|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allowing a [[beard]] to grow while trimming the moustache is emphasized with it being seen as [[Fard|mandatory]] by all respected Sunni scholars from the four major Sunni [[Madh'hab]].

==Islamic dietary laws==
{{Main|Islamic dietary laws}}
'''Islamic dietary laws''' provide a set of rules as to what Muslims eat in their diet. These rules specify the food that is '''[[halal|halāl]]''', meaning lawful. They are found in Qur'an, the holy book of [[Islam]], usually detailing what is unlawful, or '''[[haraam|harām]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.icv.org.au/about/about-islam-overview/what-is-halal-a-guide-for-non-muslims/|title=What is Halal? A Guide for Non-Muslims {{!}} Islamic Council of Victoria (ICV)|work=Islamic Council of Victoria (ICV)|access-date=2018-01-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islamic genitalia hygiene==
Urine is forbidden to be on a Muslim during prayer times, as it is considered dirty. The [[foreskin]] is a possible spot where urine can accumulate. [[Circumcision]] is used to prevent this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sunnah.com/muslim/2/65|title=Hadith - The Book of Purification - Sahih Muslim - Sunnah.com - Sayings and Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)|last=|first=|date=|website=sunnah.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/malecircumcision.shtml|title=BBC - Religions - Islam: Circumcision of boys|access-date=2018-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islamic toilet etiquette==
{{Main|Islamic toilet etiquette}}
The [[Islam]]ic faith has particular rules regarding personal [[hygiene]] when going to the [[toilet]]. This code is known as ''Qadaahul Haajah''.&lt;ref name="MSA"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Compendium of Muslim Texts |last=Shu'aib |first=Tajuddin B. |work=The Prescribed Prayer Made Simple |title=Qadaahul Haajah (Relieving Oneself) |accessdate=2009-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IT&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/surgeons-perform-delicate-operation-for-muslims-124083.html|publisher=[[Irish Independent]]|title=Surgeons perform delicate operation for Muslims|date=April 8, 2007|author=Niamh Horan|postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Issues of laterality, such as whether one uses the left or right hand and the foot used to step into or out of toilet areas, are derived from [[hadith]] sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xRqDv90bAqsC|year=1992|title=The Tao of Islam|author=Sachiko Murata|isbn=978-0-7914-0913-8|chapter=ch. 3 The Two Hands of God|postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only issue which the [[Qur'an]] mentions is the one of washing one's hands especially after using the toilet which is mentioned in verse 5:6.

Examples of these rules include, but are not limited to:

* It is strongly forbidden to make the toilet close to the flowing waters, or to be by flowing water whilst relieving yourself.
* It is more preferable to step into the bathroom area with the left leg and step outside the bathroom area with the right leg.
* One should remain silent whilst on the toilet. Talking, answering greetings or greeting others is heavily disliked.&lt;ref name="MSA"/&gt;
* One should not face nor turn one's back on [[Qibla]] (the direction Muslims face to pray) whilst relieving oneself.&lt;ref name="MSA"/&gt;
* When leaving the toilet one should also say a prayer, "O Allah! Bestow your forgiveness upon me."&lt;ref name="MSA"/&gt;
* Use of [[toilet paper]] is acceptable, but [[Anal cleansing|washing with water]] is still needed for purity and to minimize germs present in feces from touching the skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Israr Hasan |year=2006 |title=Muslims in America |url=https://books.google.com/?id=k5J493fDF38C&amp;pg=PA144&amp;vq=odd |isbn=978-1-4259-4243-4 |page=144 |postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10290">'''Ledger art''' is a term for [[Plains Indians|Plains Indian]] narrative drawing or painting on paper or cloth. Ledger art flourished primarily from the 1860s to the 1920s. A revival of ledger art began in the 1960s and 1970s. The term comes from the accounting [[ledger]] books that were a common source of paper for [[Plains Indians]] during the late 19th century.
[[File:Ledger-sm2.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Kiowa]] ledger art from 1874]]

==Historical precedents==
[[File:At the Sand Creek Massacre, 1874-1875.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Sand Creek massacre]] as drawn by eyewitness [[Howling Wolf (Cheyenne)|Howling Wolf]] (1874–1875).]]
Ledger art evolved from [[Plains hide painting]].&lt;ref name=history&gt;[https://plainsledgerart.org/history/ "Ledger Art History."] ''Department of Ethnic Studies, University of California San Diego: Plains Indian Ledger Art Project.'' 2011 (retrieved 2 Oct 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Among Plains tribes, women traditionally paint abstract, geometrical designs, whereas men paint [[Representation (arts)|representational]] designs. The men's designs were often heraldic devices or visions painted on shields, [[tipi]]s, shirts, leggings, or robes. Before the Plains tribes were forced to live on reservations in the 1870s, men generally painted personal feats in battle or hunting.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, 138&lt;/ref&gt; Plains ledger art depicted communally acknowledged events of valor and tribal importance in order to gain status for the individuals who participated in them, and their band and kin.  Plains pictorial art emphasizes narrative action and eliminates unnecessary detail or backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;Greene, 11&lt;/ref&gt; Figures tended to be drawn in hard outlines and filled with solid fields of color.&lt;ref&gt;Greene, 63&lt;/ref&gt;

These were all traditionally painted on animal hides – particularly [[American bison|buffalo]] hides. When buffalo became scarce after eradication programs encouraged by the US federal government, Plains artists began painting and drawing on paper, canvas, and muslin.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

==New materials==
An increasing supply of ledger books and other paper came from traders, government agents, missionaries, and military officers.&lt;ref&gt;Swan, 70&lt;/ref&gt; With these came pencils, ink fountain pens, crayons, and watercolor paints.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, 139&lt;/ref&gt; These new tools allowed for greater detail and experimentation than the earlier tools, such as bone or wood styli dipped in mineral pigments, had. The compact ledger books and pencils were highly portable, making them ideal for nomadic lifestyles.&lt;ref&gt;Greene, 13&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fort Marion==
[[File:Blackhawk-spiritbeing.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Drawing by [[Black Hawk (artist)|Black Hawk]] ([[Sans Arc|Sans Arc Lakota]]), c. 1880 depicting a horned Thunder Being (''Haokah'') on a horse-like creature with eagle talons and buffalo horns. The creature's tail forms a rainbow that represents the entrance to the Spirit World, and the dots represent hail. Accompanying the picture on the page were the words: "Dream or vision of himself changed to a destroyer and riding a buffalo eagle."]]
The most celebrated ledger artists were prisoners of war at [[Castillo de San Marcos|Fort Marion]] in [[St. Augustine, Florida]]. In 1874, in what became known as the [[Red River War]] or Buffalo War, a group of [[Cheyenne]], [[Kiowa]], [[Comanche]], [[Arapaho]], and [[Caddo]] warriors fought the US Army to protect the last free herd of buffalo and to assert their autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;Szabo, 12–14&lt;/ref&gt; In the harsh winter of 1874 to 1875, many tribal camps were forced to surrender to various Indian agencies, and the supposed leaders of the Red River War were rounded up and sent to Fort Marion.&lt;ref&gt;Szabo, 14&lt;/ref&gt; From 1875 to 1878, the 71 men and one woman were under the command of [[Richard Henry Pratt]], who used the opportunity to give the Indians a Western education.&lt;ref&gt;Szabo, 25&lt;/ref&gt;

He also provided the prisoners with basic art supplies, such as pencils, ink, crayons, watercolor paint, and paper.

Twenty-six of the Fort Marion prisoners engaged in drawing. They were younger Cheyenne, Arapaho, and Kiowa men.&lt;ref&gt;Szabo, 29&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most prolific and well-known artists include [[Paul Caryl Zotom]] (Kiowa); [[David Pendleton Oakerhater]] or Making Medicine (Cheyenne); [[Tichkematse]] or Squint Eyes (Cheyenne), who later worked for the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in Washington, DC; [[Wohaw]] (Kiowa); [[Howling Wolf (Cheyenne)]]; [[Etahdleuh Doanmoe]] (Kiowa); White Bear (Arapaho); Koba (Kiowa); and [[Bear’s Heart]] (Cheyenne).  Tichtematse, Howling Wolf, White Bear, and Koba all continued drawing after their release from prison.&lt;ref&gt;Szabo, 110&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Battle exploits dominated ledger art. Other traditional themes such as hunting, courtship,&lt;ref name=gus&gt;Fauntleroy, Gussie. [http://www.nativepeoples.com/Native-Peoples/September-October-2011/Looking-Between-the-Lines/#.Tj60ZAFyY4Y.facebook "Ledger Art: Looking Between the Lines."] ''Native Peoples.'' Sept/Oct 2011 (retrieved 7 Aug 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; and religious practices were common subjects. Ledger artists also documented their rapidly changing environment by portraying encroaching European Americans and new technologies such as trains and cameras. Many ledger artists worked with ethnologists, by documenting shield and tipi designs, ethnobotanical information, [[winter count]]s, dance customs and regalia, and other cultural information. Dreams and visions inspired ledger art just as they had inspired earlier hide paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, 140&lt;/ref&gt;

The artists creating ledger art today often reference pre-reservation lifeways, historical transitions, and social commentary.  They use this style to illustrate cultural continuity between historical and contemporary Native life.&lt;ref name=gus/&gt;

==As fine art==
[[File:RedDogDrawing.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The warrior "Low Dog" by Red Dog, 1884 ledger art]]
Missionaries, anthropologists, and tourists eagerly collected ledger books in the late 19th century. [[Carl Sweezy]] (1881–1953) (Arapaho) and ''[[Haungooah]]'' (Silver Horn) (1860–1940) (Kiowa) both established professional careers as ledger artists.

They inspired the [[Kiowa Five]] or, as they are increasingly known, the Kiowa Six.  These artists painted with more sophisticated materials and met with international success when they exhibited their work in the 1928 International Art Congress in [[Prague]], [[Czechoslovakia]].

==Today==
Numerous modern Plains artists create ledger paintings, including many women artists despite its history as a male domain.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt;  Many seek out 19th-century documents on which to paint, creating ironic juxtapositions between the printed text and the paintings. [[Dwayne Wilcox]] ([[Oglala Lakota]]) uses the style of 19th-century Lakota painters to express humorous views of modern realities for Lakota people. [[Arthur Amiotte]] (Oglala Lakota) builds upon the collage aspect of ledger art and combines text, photography, naturalistic painting and stylized Plains pictorial art in his work. [[Dolores Purdy Corcoran]] ([[Caddo]]/[[Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska|Winnebago]]) is a female ledger artist who uses bright colors and female figures frequently in her work.&lt;ref&gt;Fauntleroy, Gussie.

'''''Les Caquets de l'accouchée''''' is an anonymous French [[satire]] composed of several quires published in 1622. They were reunited in 1623 under the title « ''Recueil général des Caquets de l'Accouchée'' ».&lt;ref&gt;{{harvsp|Antoine Le Roux de Lincy|1855|p=v}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title refers to the custom, documented by the middle of the fifteenth, of Parisian bourgeoises to visit when one of them is layered.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvsp|Antoine Le Roux de Lincy|1855|p=x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The narrator introduces himself as a convalescing [[History of Paris|Parisian]] to whom a doctor has prescribed to recuperate through entertainment and goes {{Interlanguage link multi|rue Quincampoix|fr}} to listen to gossip with her cousin who has just given birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvsp|Antoine Le Roux de Lincy|1855|p=xv-xvi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Antoine Le Roux de Lincy]], this book, which details various aspects of Parisian life and specifically quotes the personalities of the time covering topics such as politics and religion can be "now classified as historical works, faithful echoes of prejudices and opinions of a period".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvsp|Antoine Le Roux de Lincy|1855|p=xxxii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Low information rationality''' is a [[social theory]] that states that people are [[information]] consumers with limited benefits and time for processing and understanding information. Due to the limited benefits and time individuals have for learning new information, individuals use various shortcuts and [[heuristics]] to understand information quicker. Simply put, it does not make sense for the average individual to develop in depth understandings of most issues. The theory is often used to explain the limited understanding of [[politics]] and [[Science|scientific]] [[Technology|technologies]] by the general [[public]].

==Assumptions==
The concept of low-information rationality is based on the assumption that [[human being]]s are [[cognitive miser]]s and minimize the economic costs of making decisions and forming attitudes. Most citizens will therefore not bother to develop an in-depth understanding of political or scientific issues, which would require significant time and effort. Rather, they collect only as much information as they think is necessary to make any given decision.&lt;ref name="Messages and Heuristics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/stellent/groups/corporatesite/@msh_publishing_group/documents/web_document/wtx032691.pdf|title=3 MESSAGES AND HEURISTICS: HOW AUDIENCES FORM ATTITUDES ABOUT EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES|last=Scheufele|first=Dietram|work=Engaging Science: Thoughts, deeds, analysis and action|accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key mechanisms==
The reason this theory comes about in today's age is due to vast increase in amount of information that each of us is exposed to through the [[internet]], [[Smartphone|smart phones]], and [[Television|TV]]. Therefore, these patterns of [[information processing]] make perfect sense for citizens who have to deal with thousands of pieces of new information every day, and we all use them. We spend less [[Cognition|cognitive]] effort in buying toothpaste than we do when picking a new car. And that difference in [[Information seeking|information-seeking]] is largely a function of the costs.&lt;ref name="Messages and Heuristics" /&gt;

==Shortcuts==
There are a variety of shortcuts individuals use to process information quickly and more efficiently. This does not mean, however, that these methods always lead to accurate and reliable conclusions. Common shortcuts include, [[stereotypes]], opinions of others, interpersonal influences, [[Framing (social sciences)|news frames]], [[heuristic]]s and [[political ideology]].

==Samuel Popkin: ''The Reasoning Voter''==
American pollster and political scientist [[Samuel L. Popkin|Samuel Popkin]] coined the term "low-information" in 1991 when he used the phrase "low-information signaling" in his book ''The Reasoning Voter: Communication and Persuasion in Presidential Campaigns.''&lt;ref name="popkin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Popkin|first=Samuel|title=The Reasoning Voter|year=1991|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, IL|isbn=0226675440|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fAT-IREgyQ8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popkin relies on a theory of low information rationality to explain how voters are able to make rational choices between candidates. Voters do this by using information shortcuts that they receive during campaigns, usually using something like a "drunkard's search." Voters use small amounts of personal information to construct a narrative about candidates. Essentially, they ask themselves this: "Based on what I know about the candidate personally, what is the probability that this presidential candidate was a good governor? What is the probability that he will be a good president?" Popkin's analysis is based on one main premise: voters use low information rationality gained in their daily lives, through the media and through personal interactions, to evaluate candidates and facilitate electoral choices.

==Other models==
The science Literacy/[[knowledge deficit]] model states that the public is willing and able to process information if it is available. Therefore, a lack of public support or participation is caused by a lack of information available to the public.

==Problems for science==
As mentioned above, scientists who use the knowledge deficit model face great difficulty conveying information to the lay public when overwhelming amount of psychology and political science studies show that the public uses the low information rationality model. Some examples of this are in the cutting-edge sciences of [[nanotechnology]] and biotechnology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Brossard, D. |author2=Shanahan, J. |author3=Nesbitt, T.C. |title=The Public, the Media, and Biotechnology|year=2007|publisher=CABI|location=UK|isbn=978 1 84593 204 6|page=231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For issues such as [[agricultural biotechnology]], for example, where developing an in-depth understanding would require significant efforts on the part of ordinary citizens, the pay-offs in terms of being able to make informed policy judgments may simply not be enough. As a result, it makes perfect sense for citizens to rely on shortcuts such as  opinions of others when forming their own opinions and trying to make sense of different policy positions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25341">'''Multiliteracies''' is a term coined in the mid-1990s by the New London Group&lt;ref name=NewLondon&gt;[http://www.informationhabitat.org/mw/index.php/The_New_London_School The New London School], Information Habitat wiki, [[Michigan State University]] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708022433/http://www.informationhabitat.org/mw/index.php/The_New_London_School |date=July 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is an approach to [[literacy]] theory and [[pedagogy]].  This approach highlights two key aspects of literacy: [[linguistic diversity]], and multimodal forms of linguistic expression and representation. The term was coined in response to two significant changes in [[globalized]] environments: the proliferation of diverse modes of communication through new [[communications technologies]] such as the [[internet]], [[multimedia]], and [[digital media]], and the existence of growing linguistic and [[cultural diversity]] due to increased transnational migration.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cope|first=Bill|last2=Kalantzis|first2=Mary|title="Multiliteracies": New Literacies, New Learning|journal=Pedagogies: An International Journal|volume=4|issue=3|pages=164–195|doi=10.1080/15544800903076044}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the way people communicate is changing due to new technologies, and shifts in the usage of the English language within different cultures, a new "literacy" must also be used and developed.
 
==Overview==
There are two major topics that demonstrate the way multiliteracies can be used. The first is due to the world becoming smaller, communication between other cultures/languages is necessary to anyone. The usage of the [[English language]] is also being changed. While it seems that English is the common, [[global language]], there are different dialects and subcultures that all speak different [[Englishes]]. The way English is spoken in Australia,  South Africa, India or any other country is different from how it is spoken in the original English speaking countries in the UK.
 
The second way to incorporate the term multiliteracies is the way technology and multimedia is changing how we communicate.  These days, text and speech are not the only and main ways to communicate. The definition of media is being extended to include text combined with sounds, and images which are being incorporated into movies, billboards, almost any site on the internet, and television. All these ways of communication require the ability to understand a multimedia world.

The formulation of  "A Pedagogy of Multiliteracies" by the New London Group expanded the focus of literacy from reading and writing to an understanding of multiple discourses and forms of representation in public and professional domains.  The new literacy pedagogy was developed to meet the learning needs of students to allow them to navigate within these altered technological, cultural, and linguistically diverse communities.  The concept of multiliteracies has been applied within various contexts and includes oral vernacular genres, visual literacies, information literacy, emotional literacy, and scientific multiliteracies and [[numeracy]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Application to the real world ==

Due to changes in the world, especially [[globalization]] and an increase in [[immigration]], a debate has arisen about the way students are instructed and learning in school. English, and all subjects, should evolve to incorporate multimodal ways of communication. The New London Group (1996) proposes the teaching of all representations of meaning including, linguistic, visual, audio, spatial, and gestural, which are subsumed under the category of multimodal.  A pedagogy of multiliteracies includes a balanced classroom design of Situated Practice, Overt Instruction, Critical Framing and Transformed Practice.  Students need to draw on their own experiences and [[semiotic]] literacy practices to represent and communicate meaning.

The changes that transpire through the field of education affect learning processes, while the application of learning processes affects the use of multiliteracies (Selber, 2004). These include the functional, critical, and rhetorical skills that are applied in diverse fields and disciplines.

Educational pedagogies, including Purpose Driven Education, integrate the use of multi-literacy by encouraging student learning through exploration of their passions using their senses, technology, [[vernacular]]s, as well as alternative forms of communication. 

== The New London Group ==
The New London Group is a group of ten academics who met at New London, New Hampshire, in the United States in September 1994, to develop a new literacy pedagogy that would serve concerns facing educators as the existing literacy pedagogy did not meet the learning needs of students. Their focus was on replacing the existing monolingual, monocultural, and standardized literacy pedagogy that prioritized reading and writing, with a pedagogy that used multiple modes of meaning making. They emphasised the use of multiple modes of communication, languages, and multiple Englishes to reflect the impact of new technologies and linguistic and cultural diversity, instead of developing competence in a single [[national language]] and [[Standard English|standardized form of English]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The ten academics brought to the discussion their expertise and personal experience from different national and professional contexts. Courtney Cazden from the United States has worked in the areas of classroom discourse and multilingual teaching and learning; [[Bill Cope (academic)|Bill Cope]] from Australia, on literacy pedagogy and linguistic diversity, and new technologies of representation and communication; [[Mary Kalantzis]] from Australia, on experimental social education and citizenship education; [[Norman Fairclough]] from the United Kingdom, on critical discourse analysis, social practices and discourse, and the relationship between discursive change and social and cultural change; [[Gunther Kress]] from the United Kingdom, on social semiotics, visual literacy, discourse analysis, and multimodal literacy; [[James Paul Gee|James Gee]] from the United States, on psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics, and language and literacy; [[Allan Luke]] from Australia on critical literacy  and [[applied linguistics]]; Carmen Luke from Australia, on feminism and critical pedagogy; Sarah Michaels from the United States, on classroom discourse; and [http://nuragili.unsw.edu.au/profilemartinnakata.html Martin Nataka] on [[indigenous education]] and [[higher education]] curriculum. The article "A Pedagogy of Multiliteracies: Designing Social Futures" published in 1996,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=The New London Group|last2=Group|first2=The New London|title=A Pedagogy of Multiliteracies: Designing Social Futures|journal=Harvard Educational Review|volume=66|issue=1|pages=60–93|doi=10.17763/haer.66.1.17370n67v22j160u}}&lt;/ref&gt; documents the New London Group's "manifesto" of literacy pedagogy that is recommended for use in educational institutions, in the community, and within organizations.

== A pedagogy of multiliteracies ==
The multiliteracies pedagogical approach involves four key aspects: Situated Practice, Critical Framing, Overt Instruction, and Transformed Practice. Situated Practice involves learning that is grounded in students' own life experiences. Critical Framing supports students in questioning common sense assumptions found within discourses. Overt Instruction is the direct teaching of "[[metalanguage]]s" in order to help learners understand the components of expressive forms or grammars. Transformed Practice is where learners engage in situated practices based in new understandings of literacy practices.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Situated practice ==
Situated Practice, originally formulated by the New London Group (1996)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=The New London Group|year=1996|title=A Pedagogy of Multiliteracies: Designing Social Futures|journal=Harvard Educational Review|volume=66|issue=1|pages=60–93|doi=10.17763/haer.66.1.17370n67v22j160u}}&lt;/ref&gt; as one of the related components of Multiliteracies Pedagogy, is constituted by immersion in meaningful practices within a community of learners who are culturally and linguistically diversified. It involves situating meaning making in real-world contexts and taking account of the affective and sociocultural needs of learners. This aspect of the curriculum needs to draw on the lifeworld experiences of students, as well as their out-of-school communities and discourses, as an integral part of the learning experience. In order to apply Situated Practice to curriculum realities, Cope &amp; Kalantzis (2009)&lt;ref name="Cope 164–195"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cope|first=Bill|last2=Kalantzis|first2=Mary|date=2009-08-06|title="Multiliteracies": New Literacies, New Learning|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15544800903076044|journal=Pedagogies: An International Journal|volume=4|issue=3|pages=164–195|doi=10.1080/15544800903076044|issn=1554-480X}}&lt;/ref&gt; reframed it as “experiencing” (p.&amp;nbsp;184)''.'' They believe human cognition is situated and contextual, and meanings are grounded in the real world of patterns of experience, action and subjective interest. Experiencing takes two forms.
* Experiencing the known–learners bring their own, invariably diverse knowledge, experiences, interests and life-texts to the learning context. Activities of experiencing the known involve showing or talking about something familiar-listen, view, watch and visit, reflecting on learners' own experiences, interests and perspectives (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, 2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://neamathisi.com/_uploads/Things_You_Do_to_Know_Cope__Kalantzis_2015.pdf|title=‘The Things You Do to Know: An Introduction to the Pedagogy of Multiliteracies.’ pp.1-36 in A Pedagogy of Multiliteracies: Learning By Design, edited by B. Cope and M. Kalantzis|last=Cope|first=Bill|last2=Kalantzis|first2=Mary|year=2015|publisher=Palgrave|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Experiencing the new–learners are immersed in new situations or information, observing or taking part in something that is new or unfamiliar, but within the zone of intelligibility and close to their own life-worlds. For example, teachers introduce something new but which makes sense by immersion in experiments, field trips and investigations in projects (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, 2015).

Situated Practice/experiencing connects with a tradition called 'authentic pedagogy'. [http://newlearningonline.com/literacies/chapter-5/kalantzis-and-cope-debating-authentic-pedagogy Authentic pedagogy]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139196581.007|title=literacy|last=Kalantzis|first=Mary|last2=Cope|first2=Bill|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2012|location=Cambridge|publication-place=Cambridge|pages=95–117|doi=10.1017/cbo9781139196581.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; was first formulated as a direct counterpoint to [http://newlearningonline.com/learning-by-design/glossary/didactic didactic pedagogy] in the twentieth century, initially through the work of [http://www.iep.utm.edu/dewey/ John Dewey] in the United States and [http://www.britannica.com/biography/Maria-Montessori Maria Montessori]  in Italy. It focuses on the learner's own meanings, the texts that are relevant to them in their everyday lives. When it comes to reading and writing, authentic literacy pedagogy promotes a process of natural language growth that begins when a child learns to speak, with a focus on internalized understanding rather than the formalities of rules. It is learner-centered and aims to provide space for self-expression.

However, the New London Group (1996) points out limitations to Situated Practice. First, while situated learning can lead to mastery in practice, learners immersed in rich and complex practices can vary significantly from each other and Situated Practice does not necessarily lead to conscious control and awareness of what one knows and does. Second, Situated Practice does not necessarily create learners who can critique what they are learning in terms of historical, cultural, political, ideological, or value-centered relations. Third, there is the question of putting knowledge into action. Learners might be incapable of reflexively enacting their knowledge in practice. Therefore, they clarify that Situated Practice must be supplemented by other components and powerful learning arises from weaving between Situated Practice, Overt Instruction, Critical Framing and Transformed Practice in a purposeful way.

== Critical framing ==
Critical Framing in multiliteracies requires an investigation of the socio-cultural contexts and purposes of learning and designs of meaning. Cope and Kalantzis (2001)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Cope, B.  |author2=Kalantzis, M. |lastauthoramp=yes |date = 2001|title = Putting ‘multiliteracies’ to the test|url = https://www.alea.edu.au/documents/item/59|journal = Newsletter of the Australian Literacy Educators Association.|doi =|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; discuss this in the context of our increasingly diverse and globally interconnected lives where the forces of migration, multiculturalism, and global economic integration intensify the processes of change. The act of meaning-making is also diversifying as digital interfaces level the playing field.

Mills (2009)&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Mills|first = Kathy A.|date = 2009|title = Multiliteracies: interrogating competing discourses|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09500780802152762|journal = Language and Education, 23:2, 103-116|doi =|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; discusses how multiliteracies can help us go beyond heritage print texts that reproduce and sustain dominant cultural values by creating affordances for thinking about textual practices that construct and produce culture. Another dimension of this critical framing may be extended to the diverse types and purposes of literacy in contemporary society. The traditional curricula operates on various rules of inclusion and exclusion in the hierarchical ordering of textual practices, often dismissing text types such as picture books or popular fiction. Similarly, items like blogs, emails, websites, visual literacies, and oral discourses may often be overlooked as "inferior literacies". In excluding them from mainstream literacy practices, we become prone to disenfranchise groups and may lose out on opportunities to sensitize learners to consider underlying issues of power, privilege, and prejudice, both in terms of identifying these in societal practices, as well as in questioning dominant discourses that normalize these. Mills also states how some scholars such as Unsworth (2006a, 2006b) and Mackey (1998) suggest an increased blurring of 'popular culture' and 'quality literature' facilitated by classical literature made available in electronic formats and supported by online communities and forums.

In addition to acknowledging increased socio-cultural contextualization and diversification of text-types, multiliteracies pedagogies also enable us to critically frame and reconceptualize traditional notions of writing, calling into question issues of authority, authorship, power, and knowledge. [http://eprints.ncrm.ac.uk/3084/1/D4Writing_and_Multimodal_social_semiotics.pdf Domingo, Jewitt, &amp; Kress (2014)]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Multimodal social semiotics: Writing in online contexts|last = Domingo, M., Jewitt, C. and Kress, G|publisher = Routledge|year = 2014|isbn = 1317510607|location = London|pages =}}&lt;/ref&gt; address these concepts through a study of template designs on websites and blogs that empowers the readers through non-linear readings paths, with the modular layout allowing them to choose their own reading paths. They also discuss the varying affordances of different modes and how writing become just one part of the multimodal ensemble.

Multiliteracies transcend conventional print literacies and the centrality of cultures that have historically extolled it, offering much scope for arts-based approaches in decolonizing initiatives (Flicker et. al., 2014)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Flicker, S., Danforth, J., Wilson, C., Oliver, V., Larkin, J., Restoule, J-P, Mitchell, C., Konsmo, E., Jackson, R. &amp; Prentice, T.|date = 2014|title = "Because we have really unique art": Decolonizing research with Indigenous youth using the arts.|url = http://journals.uvic.ca/index.php/ijih/article/view/13271|journal = International Journal of Indigenous Health|doi =|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; or reflexive visual methodologies in situated contexts (Mitchell, DeLange, Moletsane, Stuart, &amp; Buthelezi, 2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Mitchell, C., DeLange, N., Moletsane, R., Stuart, J., &amp; Buthelezi, T.|date = 2005|title = Giving a face to HIV and AIDS: On the uses of photo-voice by teachers and community health care workers working with youth in rural South Africa|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1191/1478088705qp042oa|journal = Qualitative Research in Psychology  |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=257–270|doi =|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in so far as access to digital tools and infrastructures is concerned, we still need to take into account issues of agency, capital, socioeconomic status, and digital epistemologies (Prinsloo &amp; Rowsell, 2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Prinsloo, M., &amp; Rowsell, J.|date = 2012|title = Digital literacies as placed resources in the globalised periphery|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09500782.2012.691511|journal = Language and Education |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=271–277|doi =|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overt instruction ==
===Original view===
In the original formulation of the New London Group, Overt Instruction was one of the major dimensions of literacy pedagogy that was identified. The original view of overt instruction includes the teachers and other experts' supporting students through scaffolding and focusing the students on the important features of their experiences and activities within the community of learners (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;33). Cope and Kalantiz argue teachers and other experts allow the learner to gain explicit information at times by building on and using what the learner already knows and has achieved. Overt Instruction is not, as it is often misrepresented, direct transmission, drills, and rote learning. It includes the kinds of collaborative efforts between teacher and student in which the student can do a task that is much more complex than the task s/he can do it individually. According to Cope and Kalantzis, "Overt Instruction introduces an often overlooked element-the connection of the element of the importance of contextualization of learning experiences to conscious understanding of elements of language meaning and design" (p.&amp;nbsp;116) Use of metalanguages, Cope and Kalantzis argue, is one of the key features of Overt Instruction. Metalanguages refer to "languages of reflective generalization that describe the form, content, and function of the discourses of practice" (p.&amp;nbsp;34).

===Updated view===
After applying Overt Instruction orientation to curriculum practices for around a decade, this dimension of literacy pedagogy was reframed and translated in the Learning by Design project into the 'Knowledge Process' of conceptualizing (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, 2009, 2015).&lt;ref name="Cope 164–195"/&gt; 
Conceptualizing involves "the development of abstract, generalizing concepts and theoretical synthesis of these concepts" (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, 2015, p.&amp;nbsp;19). Using these Knowledge Processes, learners can categorize terms, and collect these into the mental models. Conceptualizing, according to Cope and Kalantzis (p.&amp;nbsp;19) occurs in two ways:
Conceptualizing by Naming-categorization is a Knowledge Process by means of which the learner learns to use abstract, generalizing terms. A concept not only names the particular; it also abstracts something general from that particular.

Activity type: define terms, make a glossary, label a diagram, sort or categorize like or unlike things
Conceptualizing with theory-schematization is a Knowledge Process by means of which learners make generalizations and put the key terms together into interpretative framework. They build mental models, abstract frameworks and transferable disciplinary schemas (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;185&lt;ref name="Cope 164–195"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cope 164–195"/&gt;).  
Activity type: draw a diagram, make a concept map, or write a summary, theory or formula which puts the concepts together

== Transformed practice ==
Transformed Practice, originally framed by the New London Group (1996)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=The New London Group|year=1996|title=A Pedagogy of Multiliteracies: Designing Social Futures|journal=Harvard Educational Review|volume=66|issue=1|pages=60–93|doi=10.17763/haer.66.1.17370n67v22j160u}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the four components of Multiliteracies pedagogy, is embedded in [[Authentic Learning|authentic learning]], where activities are re-created according to the lifeworld of learners. Transformed Practice is transfer in meaning-making practice, which involves applied learning, real-world meanings, communication in practice, and applying understanding gained from Situated Practice, Overt Instruction, and Critical Framing to a new context. Once learners are aware of how context affects their learning, the "theory becomes [[reflective practice]]" (The New London Group, 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;87). In other words, learners can reflect on what they have learned while they engage in reflective practice based on their personal goals and values in new contexts. For instance, learners design a personalized research project on a specific topic.

Transformed Practice subsequently underwent reformation and was renamed "Applying" as part of "Knowledge Processes" (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;184),&lt;ref name="Cope 164–195"/&gt; formerly known as Multiliteracy pedagogy. Applying is considered as the typical focus of the tradition of applied or [http://edglossary.org/competency-based-learning/ competency-based learning] (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, 2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://neamathisi.com/_uploads/Things_You_Do_to_Know_Cope__Kalantzis_2015.pdf|title='The Things You Do to Know: An Introduction to the Pedagogy of Multiliteracies.' pp.1-36 in A Pedagogy of Multiliteracies: Learning By Design, edited by B. Cope and M. Kalantzis|last=Cope|first=Bill|last2=Kalantzis|first2=Mary|year=2015|publisher=Palgrave|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; While learners actively learn by applying experiential, conceptual or critical knowledge in the real world, learners act on the basis of knowing something of the world, and learning something new from the experience of acting. That is, applying occurs more or less unconsciously or incidentally everyday in the lifeworld, since learners are usually doing things and learning by doing them. Applying can occur in two ways:
* Applying appropriately concerns how knowledge is perceived in a typical or predictable way in a particular situation. For instance, meanings are expressed in a way that corresponds to the conventions of a [[Semiotics|semiotic]] or [[meaning-making]] setting (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, 2015). Applying appropriately also involves the application of knowledge and understanding of the complexity of real-world situations. Learners then examine if they are valid. Examples of activities include writing, drawing, solving a problem, or behaving in the usual and expected manner in a real-world situation/[[simulation]] (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, 2015).
* Applying creatively involves the way learners transform knowledge they have learned from a familiar context and use it in a different context, unfamiliar to learners. As applying creatively is related to being active in the innovative and creative world, learners’ interests, experiences, and aspirations can be promoted. Examples of activities are taking an intellectual risk, applying knowledge to a different setting, suggesting a new problem, and translating knowledge into a different mix of modes of meaning (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, 2015).

== Neoichnological Methods ==

[[File:Experimental setup for a neoichnological study.JPG|thumb|Experimental setup for a neoichnological study working with living animals]]

=== Working with Living Animals ===
Typically, when working with living animals, a race track is prepared and covered with a substrate, which allows for the production of footprints, i.e. sand of varying moisture content,&lt;ref name="davis" /&gt; clay &lt;ref name="curth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kubo" /&gt; or mud.&lt;ref name="milan2006" /&gt;  After preparation, the animal is lured or shooed over the race track. This results in the production of numerous footprints that constitute a complete track. In some cases the animal is filmed during track production in order to subsequently study the impact of the animal’s velocity or its behavior on the produced track.&lt;ref name="curth" /&gt; This poses an important advantage of working with living animals: changes in speed or direction, resting, slippage or moments of fright become visible in the produced tracks. After track production and prior to reuse, the track can be photographed, drawn or molded. Changes in the experimental setup are possible throughout the experiment, i. e. regulation of the moisture content of the substrate.  As an alternative, also tracks of free living animals can be studied in nature (i.e. nearby lakes) and without any special experimental setup.&lt;ref name="genise" /&gt; However, without the  standardized environment of the lab, matching the tracks with the behavior of the animal during track production is undoubtedly harder.

=== Working with Foot Models or Severed Limbs ===
Another field of methods is the experimental work done with foot models or severed limbs.&lt;ref name="milan2006b"&gt;Milan, J., &amp; Bromley, R. (2006). True tracks, undertracks and eroded tracks, experimental work with tetrapod tracks in laboratory and field. Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology ( 231), S. 253-264.&lt;/ref&gt; With these methods, the natural behavior of the animal is excluded from the analysis. In a typical experimental setup, the prepared foot is pressed into the substrate of interest, which again allows for the production of a footprint. Other than in the methods previously mentioned, the experimenter has now the opportunity to regulate manually the pressure, direction and speed of foot touchdown. Because of that, the effects of those manipulations can be studied more directly. The layering of differently colored substrates furthermore allows to study the consequences of touchdown in lower substrate layers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28103">'''Neurodevelopmental framework for learning''', like all frameworks, is an organizing structure through which learners and learning can be understood. Intelligence theories and [[neuropsychology]] inform many of them. The framework described below is a neurodevelopmental framework for learning. The neurodevelopmental framework was developed by the [[All Kinds of Minds Institute]] in collaboration with Dr. Mel Levine and the [[University of North Carolina]]'s Clinical Center for the Study of Development and Learning. It is similar to other neuropsychological frameworks, including [[Alexander Luria]]'s [[cultural-historical psychology]] and psychological [[activity theory]], but also draws from disciplines such as [[speech-language pathology]], [[occupational therapy]], and [[physical therapy]].  It also shares components with [[#Other learning frameworks|other frameworks]], some of which are listed below. However, it does not include a [[general intelligence factor]] (abbreviated '''g'''), since the framework is used to describe learners in terms of profiles of strengths and weaknesses, as opposed to using labels, diagnoses, or broad ability levels.  This framework was also developed to link with academic skills, such as reading and writing. Implications for education are discussed below as well as the connections to and compatibilities with several major educational policy issues.

This framework consists of 8 constructs, sometimes referred to as systems.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, M.D.  (1998). ''Developmental Variation and Learning Disorders'', Second Edition.  Cambridge, MA:  Educators Publishing Service.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other learning frameworks==
Numerous frameworks are available that describe development and help to organize observations of [[learning]] behavior.  Intelligence theories date back to the 19th century and the early 20th century, such as [[Charles Spearman]]'s concept of [[general intelligence factor]], or g.  Though there were exceptions (e.g., Thorndike), most theories of intelligence included g, a general index of cognitive ability.&lt;ref name="Bolles"&gt;Bolles, R.C.  (1993).  ''The Story of Psychology:  A Thematic History''.  Pacific Grove, CA:  Brooks/Cole.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fancher, R.E.  (1990). ''Pioneers of Psychology, Second Edition''.  New York:  Norton &amp; Company.&lt;/ref&gt;
An intelligence theory that has drawn considerable attention is [[Cattell–Horn–Carroll theory|Cattell-Horn-Carroll]] (CHC), which is grounded in extensive factor analytic research from cognitive ability test databases, as well as studies of development and heritability.  CHC is actually an amalgam of Cattell-Horn Gf-Gc theory and Carroll's three-tier model.&lt;ref&gt;
Carroll, J. B. (1993). ''Human Cognitive Abilities: A Survey of Factor Analytic Studies''. New York: Cambridge University.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a framework with the broadest level a general intelligence factor conceptually similar to Spearman's g.  This general factor was divided into eight narrower abilities, each consisting of narrow factors.  Cattell-Horn's model was similar on several fronts, including its hierarchical structure.  In the 1990s, Carroll's model was combined with Cattell-Horn's work by Flanagan, McGrew, and Ortiz (2000).&lt;ref&gt;
Flanagan, D.P., McGrew, K.S., &amp; Ortiz, S. (2000). The Wechsler Intelligence Scales and Gf- Gc Theory:  A contemporary approach to interpretation. Needham Heights, MA: Allyn &amp; Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt;  CHC contains three strata:  stratum III is g, stratum II consists of broad cognitive abilities, and stratum I consists of narrow cognitive abilities.  The broad cognitive abilities (stratum II) include fluid reasoning (or Gf, forming and recognizing logical relationships among patterns, inferencing, and transforming novel stimuli) and comprehension-knowledge (or Gc, using language and acquired knowledge).  There is on-going discussion by proponents of CHC about g's importance in the framework.  
The Structure of Intellect (SOI) model includes three axes (with 5-6 components per axis) that form a 3-dimensional cube; because each dimension is independent, there are 150 different potential aspects of intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Guilford | first1 = J.P. | year = 1982 | title = Cognitive psychology's ambiguities: Some suggested remedies | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 89 | issue = | pages = 48–59 | doi = 10.1037/0033-295X.89.1.48 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Howard Gardner]] has written about several categories of intelligence, as opposed to a hierarchical model.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, H. (1999). Intelligence Reframed. Multiple intelligences for the 21st century, New York: Basic Books.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Neuropsychologists have sought to map various mental abilities onto brain structures.  In so doing they have created frameworks that include factors and sub-components.  [[Alexander Luria|Luria]]&lt;ref name="Luria 1973"&gt;Luria, A.R.  (1973). ''The Working Brain:  An Introduction to Neuropsychology'' (B. Haigh, Trans.).  New York:  Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; organized brain functions into now-familiar categories, such as [[speech]] and [[memory]].  Luria's conception of [[attention]] included three units:  Unit 1 (brainstem and related areas) regulates cortical activity and levels of alertness, Unit 2 (lateral and posterior regions of neocortex) analyzes and stores newly received information, and Unit 3 (frontal lobes) programs and regulates activity.&lt;ref name="Luria 1973"/&gt;  More recently, the PASS (Planning, Attention, Successive, and Simultaneous) model&lt;ref&gt;Das, J.P., Naglieri, J.A., &amp; Kirby, J.R.  (1994). ''Assessment of Cognitive Processes: The PASS Theory of Intelligence''.  Boston:  Allyn and Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt; yields both a global index of ability while emphasizing specific cognitive processes.  For example, "successive" refers to information that is perceived, interpreted, and/or remembered in a serial order (e.g., language), whereas "simultaneous" refers to material that is perceived, interpreted, and/or remembered as a whole (e.g. visual-spatial).

'''Pauly &amp; C. – Compagnia Venezia Murano''' is a [[Venice|Venetian]] company that produces [[glass art]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Encyclopedia of Decorative Arts | first = Philippe | last = Garner | publisher = Galahad Books | year = 1982 | isbn = 0-88365-641-8 | page = 231}}&lt;/ref&gt; most notably Roman murrine, [[mosaic]]s and [[chandelier]]s.

The company was formed in 1919 by a merger of Pauly &amp; C (founded 1902) and the Compagnia di Venezia e Murano (founded 1866). It has since expanded in 1932 with the acquisition of MVM Cappellin and in 1990 by the addition of the drawings and back catalogues of Toso Vetri d’Arte. The company maintains retail showrooms as well as exhibiting antiques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Venetian Glass: The Nancy Olnick and Giorgio Spanu Collection | first = David Revere | last = McFadden |author2=Susan Sacks |author3=Marino Barovier |author4=Susanne K.

==History==

===Compagnia di Venezia e Murano===
Compagnia di Venezia e Murano began as [[Salviati (glassmakers)|Salviati &amp;C.]] in London in 1866 under the direction of Vicenza attorney [[Antonio Salviati]] and with the backing of two British men: archaeologist [[Austen Henry Layard]] and antiquarian Sir William Drake. The company was dedicated to using ancient techniques and utilized master glassblowers in its efforts to do so. It called in specialists from other fields like [[goldsmith]]ing and [[engraver|engraving]] to ensure authenticity and employed artist [[Giuseppe Devers]] to teach the techniques of enamelling and heat-applied glass gilding to company artisans. Archaeologist Layard was particularly interested in the mosaic glass techniques of Roman and pre-Roman artists, and he spent years personally overseeing the work of the company's technicians and glassblowers in attempting to revive those techniques. In 1872, the company was successful, managing to replicate the type of glass commonly known as "murrina" (plural, "murrine"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = American Studio Glass, 1960-1990: An Interpretive Study | first = Martha Drexler | last = Lynn | publisher = Hudson Hills | year = 2004 | isbn = 1-55595-239-9 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=b4KhNlxnyOEC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;dq=murrina+glass&amp;as_brr=3 | page = 162}}&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= Il Museo vetrario di Murano e la annessa Scuola di disegno negli anni 1882-1884 |author=G.

The company was renamed Venice and Murano Glass and Mosaic Company Limited in 1872, and, in 1877, Layard purchased Salviati's interest so that Salviati could pursue other interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Art &amp; design in Europe and America, 1800-1900 | first = Simon | last = Jervis |author2=Albert Museum | publisher = E.P.

The last specimen, a portrait of [[Abraham Lincoln]], was produced and donated in 1866.

Through the last years of the 19th century, Compagnia di Venezia e Murano took part in many other displays. Prior to the 1878 exhibition in Paris, it had shown at the [[Maritime Exhibition]] in Naples and the Trieste Exhibition in 1871 and at the International Exhibition in Vienna in 1873, where it won 13 prizes for decorative arts. It unveiled a new focus in 1881 with the display of the first of its glass phoenixes at the National Exhibition in Milan. It exported several thousand works for display at the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago in 1893, also setting up a [[kiln]] so that the public could observe the company's glass blowing techniques. In 1895, it exhibited at the first [[Venice Biennale]] (an event at which it would also feature later), with artisan Vincenzo Moretti taking prizes and artisan Attilio Spaccarelli earning special note for his engraving.

1900 saw a change in the company when its British owners sold their interest to a businessman from Venice named Tosolini, who was the owner of shops in St. Mark's Square. Under Tosoloni's ownership, the company stopped production in 1909, though it continued commercial distribution at St. Mark's Square.

===Merger with Pauly &amp; C===
[[File:Ponte dei consorzi.JPG|thumb|upright|Ponte dei Consorzi, front entry of Palazzo Cappello Trevisan in Venice.]]
Pauly &amp; C was formed in 1903 by Emilio Pauly, Alessandro Hirscber Hellman, Vittorio Emanuele Toldo and Ernesto Graziadei, opening showrooms in [[Palazzo Trevisan Cappello]], which would remain the headquarters of the company until its closure in 2007 for restoration. In 1919, Pauly &amp; C. and Compagnia di Venezia e Murano were both purchased by the Milan Società Anonima Sanitaria, which resold them the following year to Gaetano Ceschina of [[Milan]]. The newly merged company, retitled to its present name, continued display in its previous locations of St. Mark's Square and the Palazzo Trevisan Cappello. In 1925, the merged company resumed production of glassworks on Murano and began exhibiting again at the Monza Tirennale.

===Post-merger growth and development===
The company grew in 1933 with the acquisition of Maestri Vetrai Muranesi Cappellin, or MVM Cappellin, a glass company formed in 1925 by Paolo [[Venini]] and Giacomo Cappellin, which transferred to them rights to the works and designs of the MVM Cappellin artists such as [[Vittorio Zecchin]] and [[Carlo Scarpa]]. The company expanded into commissioned chandeliers, with notable pieces from the period being placed in such locations as the [[Quirinal Palace|Palazzo del Quirinale]] in Rome; the [[Vatican Palace]], and the [[Amalienborg Palace|Royal Palace in Copenhagen]]. More recently, interior lighting has been designed for such places as the Palazzo Bezzi in [[Ravenna]] and the Al Assawi family palace. In 1990, the company again expanded with the acquisition of [[Toso Vetri d’Arte]] glassworks.

===Transition===
Ceschina sold his interest in the company in 1963 to the Barbon family, who retained it until 1976, when they sold to Andrea Boscaro. Boscaro owned the company for almost 30 years before 2005.

==Artistic associations==
The company has a long history of association with international artisans. In the period following [[World War II|the second World War]], the company undertook long-term associations with master glassblowers [[Anzolo Fuga]] and [[Alfredo Barbini]], engraver [[Francesco Andolfato]] and painter [[Enzo Scarpa]]. Shorter associations include sculptor [[Napoleone Martinuzzi]] in the 1960s, painter [[Libero Vitali]] in 1971, architect [[Franz Prati]] between 1996 and 1997, and fashion designer [[Romeo Gigli]] in 1997. In the later 1990s, the company also featured exclusive designs by [[Heinz Oestergaard]], [[Maria Teresa Lorella Gnutti]] and [[Berit Johansson]], whose association with the company persisted. Since the turn of the century, associations have included Venetian sculptor [[Livio de Marchi]] and Chinese artist [[Xiao Fan Ru]].

==Museum display==
Glass art produced by Pauly &amp; C. – Compagnia Venezia Murano is on display in a number of museums. Among them:

*The [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in [[London]], UK

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9623">'''Persian studies''' is the study of the [[Persian language]] and its [[Persian literature|literature]] specifically. It is differentiated from [[Iranian studies]] which is a broader, more interdisciplinary subject that focuses more on the [[History of Iran|histories]] and [[Culture of Iran|cultures]] of all [[Iranian peoples]]. 

== History of Persian Studies in Iran ==
=== Before Islam ===

The study of language in Iran reaches back many centuries before [[Islam]]. The [[Avestan alphabet]], developed during the [[Sassanid Empire]], was derived from the Pahlavi alphabet and remained one of the most [[Phonology|phonologically]] sophisticated alphabets until the modern period. The [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] liturgies until that point had been orally transmitted, and the ability to set these ancient texts in writing helped to preserve them.&lt;ref name="Windfuhr"&gt;Windfuhr, Gernot L. "Notes on Motivations in the Study of Persian." ''Persian Studies in North America: Studies in honor of Mohammad Ali Jazayery.'' Ed. Mehdi Marashi. (Bethesda: Iranbooks, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; Even earlier than that, however, the invention of the [[Old Persian cuneiform script|Old Persian syllabary]], whose shapes were adapted from preexisting [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform systems]] demonstrates that Iranian peoples could think critically, logically, and imaginatively about their language. 

=== Early Islam ===

The coming of Islam announced the end of the world of [[Late Antiquity|Antiquity]] and the replacement of Zoroastrianism with Islam as the most important faith of the [[Iranian plateau]]. Iran became part of the great Islamic community, the [[Ummah]], and saw the rise of [[Arabic language|Arabic]] as the new language of [[Arabic literature|literature]] and learning. Iranian-born grammarians, rhetoricians, scientists, philosophers, theologians, contributed to the intellectual vitality of this new and vibrant civilization alongside other Muslims from other nationalities. Among the most prominent are:

* [[Sibawayh]] ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: سیبویه ''Sībawayh'') (c. 760 CE) who wrote one of the first grammars of Arabic
* [[Avicenna]] ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: أبو علي حسین إبن عبد الله إبن سینا ''Abū ʿAlī al-Ḥusayn ibn ʿAbd Allāh ibn Sīnā'') (c. 980 CE) one of the most celebrated and influential thinkers of the [[Islamic Golden Age]] contributed to astronomy, philosophy, logic, and mechanics, and helped to revive the Persian language by coining new words.
* [[Asadi Tusi]] ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: أبو منسور علي أحمد اسدي طوسي ''Abū Mansūr ʿAlī ibn Aḥmad Asadī Ṭūsī'') (d. 1072 CE) whose dictionary represented an attempt to standardize the Persian language.

Many regions of this [[Caliphate|Arab Empire]] saw the almost total replacement the indigenous language by Arabic: the pre-Islamic languages of [[Syria]], [[Iraq]], [[Egypt]], and [[North Africa]] exist only in isolated communities and have been largely replaced by Arabic. Not so in Iran, where the Persian language continued, albeit with an infusion of Arabic vocabulary, and thrived as the courtly language of the Islamic Orient. In fact it was in the Eastern reaches of the Caliphate, far from the seat of Arab power in Baghdad, where New Persian reemerged as a literary and courtly language.

== European study of Persian ==
=== Early Encounters ===

Persian was the ''lingua franca'' of a wide area, not limited to Iran.&lt;ref name="Windfuhr"/&gt;{{rp|5}} The first Europeans to encounter the Persian language were the envoys and diplomats of early modern European nations sent first to Ottoman Turkey and then to other places. The earliest motivation for the study of Persian was to win converts to Christianity.

* [[Codex Cumanicus]], a glossary of Persian and Cuman Turkish words in Latin.&lt;ref name="Windfuhr"/&gt;{{rp|6}}
* a translation of the [[Pentateuch]] into Persian by the Jew Tavus&lt;ref name="Windfuhr"/&gt;{{rp|6}}
* translations from [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] of [[Francis Xavier| Francis Xavier's]] ''History of Christ'' and ''History of Peter'' (c. 1602 CE)

=== Study of the living language, 17th century ===

Grammars and dictionaries of the Persian language were first composed in the 17th century during which efforts were made to understand the "Persian of the people." Later on, Persian as it was actually used declined in importance as [[Persian literature#Classical Persian literature|Classical Persian literature]] was introduced to the continent.

* Raimondo of Cremona seems to have been the first to compose a grammatical sketch of Persian, but his manuscript remained unavailable.&lt;ref name="Windfuhr"/&gt;{{rp|6}}
* the Belgian priest de Dieu published ''Rudimentae Linguae Persicae'' (1639 CE) in which he established the basic [[phonology]] and [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] of Persian&lt;ref name="Windfuhr"/&gt;{{rp|6}}
* Pater Angelus (Joseph Labrosse) studied Persian for fourteen years in the capital of [[Esfahan]] as part of the [[Vatican City|Vatican's]] Oriental Mission. He published a monumental work composed of "fourteen folios of mini-grammar and over 450 pages of words and phrases of the living language."&lt;ref name="Windfuhr"/&gt;{{rp|6–7}}

=== Beginnings of Orientalism, 18th century ===

During this century, Europeans discovered the rich store of Classical Persian literature, and study of the Persian language meant study of the language as it was used in these works. The first edition of the [[Gulistan of Sa'di]] was published in 1654 CE.&lt;ref name="Windfuhr"/&gt;{{rp|7}} As [[British East India Company|British trade]] with the [[Indian subcontinent]] increased, the focus of learning Persian shifted to the "colonial" Persian of India.&lt;ref name="Windfuhr"/&gt;{{rp|8}}

* [[Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron|Anquetil]] published the first edition of the texts of the Zoroastrian [[Parsis]] in his three-volume ''Zend-Avesta'' (1771 CE).
* William Jones's publication of his grammar (also in 1771 CE) marked when knowledge of Persian grammar became really accessible, since the prior works were not available to most people. He hoped the work would open up study of the Persian Classics, but it was intended to assist East India Company employees. William Jones founded the Asiatic Society of Bengal (1784 CE), the first [[Orientalism|Oriental]] society.

=== Orientalism, Rediscovery, 19th century ===

During this period of intense interest in the Orient, Persian proved to be one of the most important languages for the incipient field of [[Comparative Linguistics]]. Many scholars in prior centuries had commented on the similarities between Germanic and Iranian languages,&lt;ref name="Windfuhr"/&gt;{{rp|14–15}} but in the 19th century, scholars for the first time postulated a common ancestor to languages like [[Sanskrit]], [[Persian language|Persian]], and European languages which has since come to be called the [[Proto-Indo-European language]]. 

As important was the deciphering of [[Old Persian]], the language of dozens of inscriptions which still stand in Iran. [[Sir Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baronet|Sir Henry Rawlinson]] first discovered that the language of these inscriptions was an ancient form of the Persian language. Since these inscriptions often included inscriptions in other Cuneiform scripts, this decipherment became like a [[Rosetta Stone]] for the languages of ancient [[Mesopotamia]]. All that we know of the languages and histories of the empires of [[Babylonia]], [[Assyria]], [[Sumer]], [[Elam]], and so on is indirectly indebted to knowledge of the Persian language.

=== Modernization, 20th century ===

During the [[Qajar dynasty]], Iranians first encountered Europeans in the context of the rise of the West. [[Napoleon I of France#Egyptian Expedition of 1798-99|Napoleon's expedition to Egypt]] in 1798 CE was the first European intrusion into the Muslim Middle East and prefigured many more disruptions for the peoples of this region, especially Iran. Iran lost territory in several wars with Russia and Britain. Iran's economy suffered greatly as European sea lanes bypassed the legendary [[Silk Road]] which had always been a pillar of Iran's economy. New [[Industrialization|industrial]] processes of production made traditional ways of living impossible for Iranians. As in many other countries during this time like [[Japan]], [[China]], and [[Ottoman Empire|Turkey]], a [[Nationalism|nationalist]] reaction occurred in Iran as Iranians realized the importance of modernizing as quickly as possible to fight off the encroachment of the Western powers. It was at this point that modern educational institutions in Western tradition were first opened in Iran. Iran would never be the same, and the study of language there merged with the tradition in Europe.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10678">'''Phenomenology''' in architecture can be understood as an aspect of [[philosophy]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; researching into the experience of built space, and as shorthand for [[architectural phenomenology]], a historical architectural movement.

==Overview==
The phenomenology of architecture is the philosophical study of architecture as it appears in experience. In contrast, architectural phenomenology is a movement within architecture beginning in the 1950s, reaching its apogee in the late 1970s and 1980s, and continuing until today, which is both intellectual and an aesthetic in character. Architectural phenomenology, with its emphasis on architecture as a human experience that is historically contingent, stood in sharp contrast to the anti-historicism of postwar modernism. As a movement, it helped give new legitimacy to idea that historical buildings contained valuable experiential lessons for contemporary designers. The emphasis on history was a challenge to postwar [[modern architecture]] which eventually led to [[Postmodern architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last =Otero-Pailos  | first =Jorge  | title =Architecture’s Historical Turn: Phenomenology and the Rise of the Postmodern  | publisher =University of Minnesota Press| year =2010 | location = | pages =  | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=3WDOQgAACAAJ&amp;dq=architecture's%20historical%20turn&amp;source=gbs_book_other_versions  | isbn=9780816666041}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical development==
American architects first started seriously studying phenomenology at Princeton University in the 1950s under Prof. [[Jean Labatut]], whose student [[Charles W. Moore]] was the first to write a PhD dissertation, titled Water and Architecture (1958), that drew heavily on the philosophy of [[Gaston Bachelard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last =Otero-Pailos  | first =Jorge  | title =Architecture’s Historical Turn: Phenomenology and the Rise of the Postmodern  | publisher =University of Minnesota Press| year =2010 | location = | pages =102  | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=3WDOQgAACAAJ&amp;dq=architecture's%20historical%20turn&amp;source=gbs_book_other_versions  | isbn=9780816666041}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, Milanese architect [[Ernesto Nathan Rogers]], through his influential editorship of the journal Casabella Continuità helped to advance architectural phenomenology in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Jorge Otero-Pailos, Theorizing the Anti-Avant-Garde: Invocations of Phenomenology in Architectural Discourse, 1945-1989, (Ph.D. Dissertation: Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; He collaborated with philosopher [[Enzo Paci]], and influenced a generation of young architects including [[Vittorio Gregotti]] and [[Aldo Rossi]].&lt;ref&gt;Vittorio Gregotti and Jorge Otero-Pailos, "Interview with Vittorio Gregotti: The Role of Phenomenology in the Formation of the Italian Neo-Avant-Garde," in Thresholds, n. 21 (Fall 2000), 40-46&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1970s, the Norwegian architect, theorist and historian [[Christian Norberg-Schulz]] achieved international acclaim with his book "Genius Loci: Towards a Phenomenology of Architecture" (1979), which was markedly influenced by [[Martin Heidegger]]'s hermeneutic ontology.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Jarzombek]]—''The Psychologizing of Modernity'' (Cambridge University Press, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;He also wrote ''Intentions in Architecture'' (1963)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For example, Martin Heidegger's essay "Building Dwelling Thinking", 1951&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Christian Norberg-Schulz]] was, for many architecture students of the 1980s, an important reference in architectural phenomenology,&lt;ref&gt;A Norwegian, he graduated from the Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule ([[ETH]]) in Zurich in 1949 and eventually became Dean of the Oslo School of Architecture.&lt;/ref&gt; especially because the combination of texts and images in his books provided readily accessible explanations for how a phenomenological approach to architecture could be translated into designs. Norberg-Schulz spawned a wide following, including his successor at the Oslo School of Architecture, [[Thomas Thiis-Evensen]].&lt;ref&gt;see Thomas Thiis-Evensen, ''Archetypes in Architecture'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1987)&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, the School of Comparative Studies at the [[University of Essex]], under the influence of [[Dalibor Vesely]] and [[Joseph Rykwert]], was the breeding ground for a generation of architectural phenomenologists, which included [[David Leatherbarrow]], professor of architecture at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], [[Alberto Pérez-Gómez]], professor of architectural history at [[McGill University]], and the architect [[Daniel Libeskind]]. In the 1980s, the phenomenological approach to architecture was continued and further developed by Vesely and his colleague [[Peter Carl]] in their research and teaching at the Department of Architecture at the [[University of Cambridge]]. As architectural phenomenology became established in academia, professors developed theory seminars that tried to expand the movement's range of ideas beyond [[Gaston Bachelard]],&lt;ref&gt;Gaston Bachelard ''[[The Poetics of Space]]'' (1958)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Martin Heidegger]], to include [[Edmund Husserl]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]],&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Merleau-Ponty's ''Phenomenology of Perception'' (English version 1962)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] [[Hannah Arendt]] and an ever wider group of theorists whose modes of thinking bordered on phenomenology, such as [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Henri Bergson]], and [[Paul Virilio]] (urban planner).

'''Dwelling'''

The phenomenon of dwelling was a central research theme in architectural phenomenology. Much of the way it was understood in architecture was shaped by the later thought of [[Martin Heidegger]] as set in his influential essay: "Building Dwelling Thinking." He links dwelling to what he refers as the "gathering of the fourfold," namely the regions of being as entailed by the phenomena of: "the saving of earth, the reception of sky (heavens), the initiation of mortals into their death, and the awaiting/remembering of divinities." The essence of dwelling is not architectural, per se, in the same manner that the essence of technology for him is not technological per se.&lt;ref&gt;*[[Nader El-Bizri]], "Being at Home Among Things: Heidegger's Reflections on Dwelling", ''Environment, Space, Place'' Vol. 3 (2011)pp.&amp;nbsp;47–71; and [[Nader El-Bizri]], 'On Dwelling: Heideggerian Allusions to Architectural Phenomenology', ''Studia UBB Philosophia'' 60 (2015)pp.&amp;nbsp;5–30&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence in practice==
Prominent architects, such as [[Daniel Libeskind]] [[Steven Holl]] and [[Peter Zumthor]] are described by [[Juhani Pallasmaa]] as current practitioners of the phenomenology of architecture. In more recent years the phenomenological orientation in architectural thinking has been reinforced through the research of a new generation of younger architectural phenomenologist, such as the philosopher-architect [[Nader El-Bizri]], who is a Heideggerian scholar with extensive works in phenomenology and commentaries on [[Khôra]], and a metaphysician in his own right, or via the practice of the academic-architect Adam Sharr in Britain.

==Background==
The success of physics in "mathematicizing" itself, particularly since [[Isaac Newton]]'s ''[[Principia Mathematica (Newton)|Principia Mathematica]]'', is generally considered remarkable and often disproportionate compared to other areas of inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Eugene Wigner]] remarked "The miracle of the appropriateness of the language of mathematics for the formulation of the laws of physics is a wonderful gift which we neither understand nor deserve.", while [[Richard Feynman]] said "To those who do not know mathematics it is difficult to get across a real feeling as to the beauty, the deepest beauty, of nature ... If you want to learn about nature, to appreciate nature, it is necessary to understand the language that she speaks in."&lt;/ref&gt; "Physics envy" refers to the envy (perceived or real) of scholars in other disciplines for the mathematical precision of fundamental concepts obtained by physicists. It is an accusation raised against disciplines (typically against [[social sciences]] and [[liberal art]]s such as [[literature]], [[philosophy]], and [[psychology]]) when these academic areas try to express their fundamental concepts in terms of mathematics, which is seen as an unwarranted push for [[reductionism]].

[[Evolutionary biology|Evolutionary biologist]] [[Ernst Mayr]] discusses the issue of the inability to reduce biology to its mathematical basis in his book ''What Makes Biology Unique?''.&lt;ref name="Mayr2004"&gt;Mayr (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Noam Chomsky]] discusses the ability and desirability of reduction to its mathematical basis in his article "Mysteries of Nature: How Deeply Hidden."&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky contributed extensively to the development of the field of [[theoretical linguistics]], a [[formal science]].

[[File:SummaryDiagramVertical.png|frame|right|The transition of [[communication technology]]: [[oral culture]], [[manuscript culture]], print culture, and [[Information Age]]]]
'''Print culture''' embodies all forms of printed text and other printed forms of [[visual communication]]. One prominent scholar in the field is [[Elizabeth Eisenstein]], who contrasted print culture, which appeared in Europe in the centuries after the advent of the Western [[printing-press]] (and much earlier in China where [[woodblock printing]] was used from 594 AD), to ''scribal culture''. [[Walter Ong]], by contrast, has contrasted written culture, including scribal, to [[oral culture]]. Ong is generally considered one of the first scholars to define print culture in contrast to [[oral culture]].  These views are related as the printing press brought a vast rise in literacy, so that one of its effects was simply the great expansion of written culture at the expense of oral culture.  The development of [[printing]], like the development of [[writing]] itself, had profound effects on human societies and knowledge. "Print culture" refers to the cultural products of the printing transformation.

In terms of image-based communication, a similar transformation came in Europe from the fifteenth century on with the introduction of the [[old master print]] and, slightly later, [[popular prints]], both of which were actually much quicker in reaching the mass of the population than printed text.

Print culture is the conglomeration of effects on human society that is created by making printed forms of communication. Print culture encompasses many stages as it has evolved in response to technological advances. Print culture can first be studied from the period of time involving the gradual movement from oration to script as it is the basis for print culture. As the printing became commonplace, script became insufficient and printed documents were [[mass production|mass-produced]]. The era of physical print has had a lasting effect on human culture, but with the advent of digital text, some scholars believe the printed word is becoming obsolete.

The [[electronic media]], including the [[World Wide Web]], can be seen as an outgrowth of print culture.

== The development of print ==

===Prior to print===
[[Oral culture]] was all that existed. Oral culture gradually found the need to store what was said for long periods of time, and slowly developed scribal culture. Scribal culture being inaccurate and tedious at best developed into print culture. Each segment is rich with its own effects on the world. Scribal culture, defined by the written or physical conveying of ideas, is important to understand in achieving a grasp on the unfolding of print culture itself. Scholars disagree over when scribal culture developed. [[Walter Ong]] argues that scribal culture cannot exist until an alphabet is created, and a form of writing standardized. On the other hand, [[D. F. McKenzie]] argues that even communicative notches on a stick, or structure, represent “text”, and therefore scribal culture.

Ong suggests scribal culture is defined by an alphabet. McKenzie says that the key to scribal culture is non-verbal communication, which can be accomplished in more ways than using an alphabet. These two views give rise to the importance of print culture. In scribal culture, procuring documents was a difficult task, and documentation would then be limited to the rich only. Ideas are difficult to spread amongst large groups of people over large distances of land, not allowing for effective dissemination of knowledge.

Scribal culture also deals with large levels of inconsistency. It was always considered that the oldest document was the most accurate, as it had been copied the least. In the process of copying documents, many times the meaning became changed, and the words different. Reliance on the written text of the time was never exceedingly strong. Over time, a greater need for reliable, quickly reproduced, and a relatively inexpensive means of distributing written text arose. Scribal culture, transforming into print culture, was only replicated in manners of written text.

===Development of print===
[[Image:Jingangjing.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The intricate frontispiece of the Diamond Sutra from [[Tang Dynasty]] [[China]], 868 AD ([[British Museum]])]] 
The Chinese invention of [[paper]] and [[woodblock printing]], at some point before the first dated [[book]] in 868 (the [[Diamond Sutra]]) produced the world's first print culture.&lt;ref&gt;A Hyatt Mayor, Prints and People, Metropolitan Museum of Art/Princeton, 1971, nos 1-4. {{ISBN|0-691-00326-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of thousands of [[books]], on subjects ranging from [[Confucian|Confusion Classics]] to [[science]] and [[mathematics]], were printed using [[woodblock printing]].

[[Paper]] and [[woodblock printing]] were introduced into Europe in the 15th Century, and the first printed [[book]]s began appearing in Europe. Chinese movable type was spread to Korea during the [[Goryeo Dynasty]]. Around 1230, Koreans invented a metal type movable printing which was described by the French scholar Henri-Jean Martin as "extremely similar to Gutenberg's".&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, Asa and Burke, Peter (2002) A Social History of the Media: from Gutenberg to the Internet, Polity, Cambridge, pp.15-23, 61-73.&lt;/ref&gt; East metal movable type was spread to Europe between the late 14th century and early 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Polenz, Peter von. |title = Deutsche Sprachgeschichte vom Spätmittelalter bis zur Gegenwart: I.

S. Stavrianos]] |title=A Global History: From Prehistory to the 21st Century |edition=7th |year=1998 |origyear=1970 |publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] |location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey |isbn=978-0-13-923897-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The invention of [[Johannes Gutenberg]]'s [[printing press]] (circa 1450) greatly reduced the amount of labor required to produce a book leading to a tremendous increase in the number of books produced. Early printers tried to keep their printed copies of a text as faithful as possible to the original manuscript. Even so, the earliest publications were still often different from the original, for a short time, in some ways [[manuscript]]s still remaining more accurate than printed books.

Hand-copied illustrations were replaced by first [[woodcut]]s, later [[engraving]]s that could be duplicated precisely, revolutionizing technical literature (Eisenstein 155).

== Print culture, the Renaissance, and the Reformation ==
Eisenstein has described how the high costs of copying scribal works often led to their abandonment and eventual destruction.  Furthermore, the cost and time of copying led to the slow propagation of ideas. In contrast, the printing press allowed rapid propagation of ideas, resulting in knowledge and cultural movements that were far harder to destroy.

Eisenstein points to prior renaissances (rebirths) of classical learning prior to the printing press that failed.  In contrast, the Renaissance was a permanent revival of classical learning because the printing of classical works put them into a permanent and widely read form.

Similarly, Eisenstein points to a large number of prior attempts in Western Europe to assert doctrines contrary to the ruling Catholic Church.  In contrast, the [[Protestant Reformation]] spread rapidly and permanently due to the printing of non-conformist works such as the [[95 Theses]].

===Renaissance===
With the shift towards printing presses in the West, after [[Johannes Gutenberg]] developed a method that was cheap, fast, and filling the demand for books, the Renaissance truly came into its own.  Even though the printing press was a paradigm shifting invention, printing had many critics, who were afraid that books could spread lies and subversion or corrupt unsuspecting readers.  Also, they were afraid that the printed texts would spread heresy and sow religious discord.  The [[Gutenberg Bible]] was the first book produced with moveable type in Europe.  Martin Luther's Bible, which was published in German in 1522, started the [[Protestant Reformation]].  Latin's importance as a language started languishing with the rise of texts written in national languages.  The shift from scholarly Latin to everyday languages marked an important turning point in print culture.  The vernacular Bibles were important to other nations, as well.  The [[Authorized King James Version|King James]] Authorized Version was published in 1611, for example.  Along with the religious tracts, the scientific revolution was largely due to the printing press and the new print culture.  Scholarly books were more accessible, and the printing press provided more accurate diagrams and symbols.  Along with scientific texts, like the works of [[Copernicus]],  [[Galileo]], and [[Tycho Brahe]], atlases and cartography started taking off within the new print culture, mostly due to the exploration of different nations around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, Martyn.  Books: A Living History.  Paul Getty Museum, 2011.  Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enlightenment===
With the rise of literacy, books and other texts became more entrenched in the culture of the West.  Along with literacy and more printed words also came censorship, especially from governments.  In France, [[Voltaire]] and [[Rousseau]] were both imprisoned for their works.  Other authors, like [[Montesquieu]] and [[Diderot]], had to publish outside France.  Censored books became a valuable commodity within this environment, and an underground network of book smugglers started operating within France.  Diderot and Jean d'Alembert created the ''[[Encyclopedie]]'', which was published in 1751 in seventeen folio volumes with eleven volumes of engravings.  This work embodied the essence of the [[Age of Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, Martyn.  Books: A Living History.  Paul Getty Museum, 2011.  Chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Print culture and the American Revolution==

===A profound impact===
Numerous eras throughout history have been defined through the use of print culture. The [[American Revolution]] was a major historical conflict fought after print culture brought the rise of literacy. Furthermore, print culture's ability to shape and guide society was a critical component before, during, and after the Revolution.

===Pre-Revolution===
Many different printed documents influenced the beginning of the revolution. The [[Magna Carta]] was originally a scribal document of 1215, recording an oral transaction restricting the power of English kings and defining rights of subjects. It was revitalized by being printed in the 16th century and widely read by the increasingly literate English and colonial population thereafter.  The Magna Carta was used as a basis for the development of English liberties by [[Sir Edward Coke]] and became a basis for writing the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]].

Additionally, during the 18th century, the production of printed newspapers in the colonies greatly increased. In 1775, more copies of newspapers were issued in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] than were printed in all of New England in 1754, showing that the existence of the conflict developed a need for print culture. This onslaught of printed text was brought about by the anonymous writings of men such as [[Benjamin Franklin]], who was noted for his many contributions to the newspapers, including the [[Pennsylvania Gazette]]. This increase was primarily due to the easing of the government's tight control of the press, and without the existence of a relatively free press, the American Revolution may have never taken place. The production of so many newspapers can mostly be attributed to the fact that newspapers had a huge demand; printing presses were writing the newspapers to complain about the policies of the British government, and how the British government was taking advantage of the colonists.

In 1775, [[Thomas Paine]] wrote the pamphlet "[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]," a pamphlet that introduced many ideas of freedom to the Colonial citizens. Allegedly, half a million copies were produced during the pre-revolution era. This number of pamphlets produced is significant as there were only a few million freed men in the colonies. However, "Common Sense" was not the only manuscript that influenced people and the tide of the revolution. Among the most influential were [[James Otis, Jr.|James Otis]]' "Rights of the British Colonies" and  [[John Dickinson (delegate)|John Dickinson]]'s "Farmer's Letters". Both of these played a key role in persuading the people and igniting the revolution.

===During the Revolution===
Newspapers were printed during the revolution covering battle reports and propaganda. These reports were usually falsified by Washington in order to keep morale up among American citizens and troops. Washington was not the only one to falsify these reports, as other generals (on both sides) used this technique as well. The newspapers also covered some of the battles in great detail, especially the ones that the American forces won, in order to gain support from other countries in hopes that they would join the American forces in the fight against the British.

Before the Revolution, the British placed multiple acts upon the colonies, such as the [[stamp act]]. Many newspaper companies worried that the British would punish them for printing papers without a British seal, so they were forced to temporarily discontinue their work or simply change the title of their paper. However, some patriotic publishers, particularly those in Boston, continued their papers without any alteration of their title.

The [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] is a very important written document that was drafted by the original thirteen colonies, as a form of print culture that would declare their independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain and explained the justifications for doing so.  While it was explicitly documented on July 4, 1776, it was not recognized by [[Great Britain]] until September 3, 1783, by the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]].

===Post-Revolution===
After the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]], a cluster of free states in need of a government was created. The basis for this government was known as the [[Articles of Confederation]], which were put to effect in 1778 and formed the first governing document of the United States of America. This document, however, was found to be unsuitable to outline the structure of the government, and thus showed an ineffectual use of print culture, and since printed texts were the most respected documents of the time, this called for an alteration in the document used to govern the confederation.

It was the job of the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]] to reform the document, but they soon discovered that an entirely new text was needed in its place. The result was the [[United States Constitution]]. In the form of written word, the new document was used to grant more power to the central government, by expanding into branches. After it was ratified by all of the states in the union, the Constitution served as a redefinition of the modern government.

[[Thomas Jefferson]] was noted as saying, “The basis of our government being the opinion of the people, the very first object should be to keep that right; and were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers, or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate for a moment to prefer the latter.” This serves as an excellent example of how newspapers were highly regarded by the colonial people. In fact, much like other forms of 18th century print culture, newspapers played a very important role in the government following the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]]. Not only were they one of the few methods in the 18th century to voice the opinion of the people, they also allowed for the ideas to be disseminated to a wide audience, a primary goal of printed text. A famous example of the newspaper being used as a medium to convey ideas were the [[Federalist Papers]]. These were first published in New York City newspapers in 1788 and pushed for people to accept the idea of the United States Constitution by enumerating 85 different articles that justified its presence, adding to a series of texts designed to reinforce each other, and ultimately serving as a redefinition of the 18th century.

== The state of print today ==
Today, print has matured to a state where the majority of modern society has come to have certain expectations regarding the printed book:
* The knowledge contained by printed books is believed to be accurate.
* The cited author of a printed book does indeed exist and is actually the person who wrote it.
* Every copy of a printed book is identical (at least in the important aspects) to every other copy, no matter how far apart the locations are in which they are sold.

Copyright laws help to protect these standards. However, a few regions do exist in the world where literary [[Copyright infringement|piracy]] has become a standard commercial practice. In such regions, the preceding expectations are not the norm. (Johns 61)

Currently, there are still approximately 2.3 billion books still sold each year worldwide. However, this number is steadily decreasing due to the ever-growing popularity of the [[Internet]] and other forms of digital media.

== Transition to the digital era ==
As David J. Gunkel states in his article "What's the Matter with Books?", society is currently in the late age of the text; the moment of transition from print to electronic culture where it is too late for printed books and yet too early for electronic texts. Jay David Bolter, author of ''Writing Space'', also discusses our culture in what he calls "the late age of print."  The current debate going on in the literary world is whether or not the computer will replace the printed book as the repository and definition of human knowledge. There is still a very large audience committed to printed texts, who are not interested in moving to a digital representation of the repository for human knowledge. Bolter, in his own scholarship and also along with Richard Grusin in ''Remediation'', explains that despite current fears about the end of print, the format will never be erased but only remediated.  New forms of technology (new media) will be created which utilize features of old media, thus preventing old media's (aka print's) erasure.  At the same time, there are also concerns over whether obsolescence and deterioration make digital media unsuitable for long-term archival purposes. Much of the early paper used for print is highly acidic, and will ultimately destroy itself.

The way that information is transferred has also changed with this new age of digital text and the shift towards electronic media. Gunkel states that information now takes the form of immaterial bits of digital data that are circulated at the speed of light. Consequently, what the printed book states about the exciting new culture and economy of bits is abraded by the fact that this information has been delivered in the slow and outdated form of physical paper.

In the article, [http://www-unix.oit.umass.edu/%7Eeleclaw/ylj5.html "The First Amendment, Print Culture, and the Electronic Environment"], the author notes that expectations will change as information becomes less tied to specific locations, and as machines become networked and linked to other machines. This means that in the future certain goods will not be associated with their origins.

The article "The First Amendment, Print Culture, and the Electronic Environment" ([https://web.archive.org/web/20060619192001/http://www-unix.oit.umass.edu/~eleclaw/ylj4.html]) also mentions how the new electronic age will make print better. Placing information into electronic form not only liberates the information from its pages but removes the need for specialized spaces to hold particular kinds of information. People have become increasingly accustomed to acquiring information from our homes that used to be only accessible from an office or library. Once computers are all [[computer networking|networked]], all information should, at least in theory, be accessible from all places. Print itself contained a set of invisible and inherent censors, which [[electronic media]] is helping to remove from the creation of text. Points of control that are present in print space are no longer present as distribution channels multiply, as copying becomes faster and cheaper, as more information is produced, as economic incentives for working with information increase, and as barriers and boundaries that inhibited working with information are crossed.

== Changes in technology and its effect on print culture ==
There are more online publications, [[Academic journal|journals]], [[newspaper]]s, [[magazines]], and businesses than ever before. While this brings society closer, and makes publications more convenient and accessible, ordering a product online reduces contact with others. Many online articles are anonymous, making the '[[death of the author]]' even more apparent. Anyone can post articles and journals online anonymously. In effect, the individual becomes separated from the rest of society.

The advances of technology in print culture can be separated into three shifts: 
*spoken language to the written word, 
*the written word to Printing press, 
*the printing press to the computer/internet.

The written word has made history recordable and accurate.  The printing press, some may argue, is not a part of print culture, but had a substantial impact upon the development of print culture through the times. The printing press brought uniform copies and efficiency in print. It allowed a person to make a living from writing. Most importantly, it spread print throughout society.

The advances made by technology in print also impact anyone using cell phones, laptops, and personal digital organizers. From novels being delivered via a cell phone, the ability to text message and send letters via e-mail clients, to having entire libraries stored on PDAs, print is being influenced by devices.

== Non-textual forms of print culture ==

Symbols, logos and printed images are forms of printed media that do not rely on text. They are ubiquitous in modern urban life. Analyzing these cultural products is an important part of the field of [[cultural studies]].  Print has given rise to a wider distribution of pictures in society in conjunction with the printed word.  Incorporation of printed pictures in magazines, newspapers, and books gave printed material a wider mass appeal through the ease of [[visual culture|visual communication]].

== Text and Print ==

There is a common miscommunication that occurs when discussing that which is
print and that which is text. In the literary world, notable scholars such as
[[Walter Ong]] and [[D.F. McKenzie]] have disagreed on the meaning of text. The
point of the discussion at hand is to have a word that encompasses all forms
of communication - that which is printed, that which is online media, even a
building or notches on a stick.  According to Walter Ong text did not come
about until the development of the first alphabet, well after humanity existed.
According to Mckenzie primitive humans did have a form of text they used to
communicate with their cave drawings.  This is discussed in [[literary theory]]. Print, however, is a representation of that which is printed, and
does not encompass all forms of communication (e.g. a riot at a football game).

Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a set of possible `states of the world' or `alternatives';  society wishes to choose some state from &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.  Let &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; be a finite set, representing a collection of people.  For each &lt;math&gt;i \in I&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;u_i:X\longrightarrow\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; be a ''[[utility|utility function]]''.  A ''[[social choice theory|social choice rule]]'' (or ''[[voting system]]'') is a mechanism which uses the data &lt;math&gt;(u_i)_{i \in I}&lt;/math&gt; to select some element(s) from &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; which are `best' for society.  (The basic problem of [[social choice theory]] is to disambiguate the word `best'.)

The classic [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] social choice rule selects the element &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt; which maximizes the ''utilitarian sum''

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; U(x):= \sum_{i\in I} u_i(x).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

However, for this formula to make sense, we must assume that the utility functions &lt;math&gt;(u_i)_{i \in I}&lt;/math&gt; are both [[cardinal utility|cardinal]], and [[social choice theory#Interpersonal utility comparison|interpersonally comparable]] at a cardinal level.

The notion that individuals have cardinal utility functions is not that problematic.  Cardinal utility has been implicitly assumed in [[decision theory]] ever since [[Daniel Bernoulli]]'s analysis of the [[Saint Petersburg Paradox]].  Rigorous mathematical theories of cardinal utility (with application to risky decision making) were developed by [[Frank P. Ramsey]], [[Coherence (philosophical gambling strategy)|Bruno de Finetti]],
[[Von Neumann–Morgenstern utility theorem|von Neumann and Morgenstern]], and [[Subjective expected utility|Leonard Savage]].  However, in these theories, a person's utility function is only well-defined up to an `affine rescaling'.  Thus, if the utility function &lt;math&gt;u_i:X\longrightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is valid description of her preferences, and if &lt;math&gt;r_i,s_i\in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; are two constants with &lt;math&gt;s_i&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, then the `rescaled' utility function &lt;math&gt;v_i(x) := s_i\, u_i(x) +  r_i&lt;/math&gt; is an equally valid description of her preferences.  If we define a new package of utility functions &lt;math&gt;(v_i)_{i\in I}&lt;/math&gt; using possibly different &lt;math&gt;r_i\in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s_i&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;i \in I&lt;/math&gt;, and we then consider the utilitarian sum

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; V(x):= \sum_{i\in I} v_i(x),&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

then in general, the maximizer of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; will ''not'' be the same as the maximizer of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, in a sense, classic utilitarian social choice is not well-defined within the standard model of cardinal utility used in decision theory, unless we specify some mechanism to `calibrate' the utility functions of the different individuals.

''Relative utilitarianism'' proposes a natural calibration mechanism.  For every &lt;math&gt;i \in I &lt;/math&gt;, suppose that the values

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; m_i \ := \ \min_{x \in X} \, u_i(x) \quad \mbox{and}\quad M_i \ := \ \max_{x \in X} \, u_i(x)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

are well-defined.  (For example, this will always be true if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is finite, or if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a compact space and &lt;math&gt;u_i&lt;/math&gt; is a continuous function.)   Then define

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;w_i(x) \ :=  \ \frac{u_i(x) - m_i}{M_i - m_i}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

for all &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, &lt;math&gt;w_i:X \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is a `rescaled' utility function which has a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 1.  The Relative Utilitarian social choice rule selects the element in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; which maximizes the utilitarian sum

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; W(x):= \sum_{i\in I} w_i(x).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

As an abstract social choice function, relative utilitarianism has been analyzed by Cao (1982), Dhillon (1998), Karni (1998), Dhillon and Mertens (1999), Segal (2000), Sobel (2001) and Pivato (2008). (Cao (1982) refers to it as the `modified Thomson solution'.)  When interpreted as a `voting rule', it is equivalent to [[Range voting]].

A ''''''sustainable''' habitat''' is an [[ecosystem]] that produces food and shelter for people and other organisms, without resource depletion and in such a way that no external waste is produced.  Thus the habitat can continue into future tie without external infusions of resource. Such a sustainable habitat may evolve naturally or be produced under the influence of man.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} A [[sustainability|sustainable]] [[habitat]] that is created and designed by human intelligence will mimic nature, if it is to be successful. Everything within it is connected to a complex array of organisms, physical resources and functions. Organisms from many different [[biome]]s can be brought together to fulfill various ''ecological niches''.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The term often refers to sustainable [[:Category:Human habitats|human habitat]]s, which typically involve some form of [[green building]] or [[environmental planning]].

==Overview==
In creating the sustainable habitats, [[environmental scientist]]s, designers, engineers and [[architecture|architects]] must consider no element as a [[waste]] product to be disposed of somewhere off site, but as a nutrient stream for another process to feed on. Researching ways to interconnect waste streams to production creates a more sustainable society by minimizing [[pollution]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

[[Image:Whistler-Nocturne in black and gold.jpg|thumbnail|''[[Nocturne in Black and Gold – The Falling Rocket]]'' by James McNeill Whistler. Whistler sued Ruskin over his criticism of the painting.]]
[[File:12 Butterflies.jpg|thumb|Butterflies designed for the illustration of the book (c. 1890)]]

'''''The Gentle Art of Making Enemies''''' is a book by the painter [[James McNeill Whistler]], published in 1890. The book was in part a response to, in part a transcript of, Whistler's famous libel suit against critic [[John Ruskin]]. Ruskin, in a review of the inaugural showing at the [[Grosvenor Gallery]], had referred to Whistler's painting ''[[Nocturne in Black and Gold – The Falling Rocket]]'' as "flinging a pot of paint in the public's face".&lt;ref&gt;Hewison, Robert. ''John Ruskin''. Oxford University Press, 2007. pg. 98&lt;/ref&gt;  The book contains Whistler's letters to newspapers chronicling his many petty grievances against various acquaintances and friends.

Whistler biographer [[Stanley Weintraub]] suggests the book was controversial enough that Whistler might have been better known for it than for his art at the time of his death.&lt;ref&gt;Weintraub, Stanley. ''Whistler: A Biography''. De Capo Press, 2001: xi. {{ISBN|0-306-80971-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Media Equation''' is a general [[communication theory]] that claims that people tend to treat [[Personal computer|computers]] and other [[Broadcast media|media]] as if they were either [[interpersonal communication|real people]] or real places.  The effects of this phenomenon on people experiencing these media are often profound, leading them to behave and to respond to these experiences in unexpected ways, most of which they are completely unaware of.&lt;ref&gt;Reeves and Nass, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally based on the research of [[Clifford Nass]] and [http://www.stanford.edu/~reeves Byron Reeves] at [[Stanford University]], the theory explains that people tend to respond to media as they would either to another person (by being polite, cooperative, attributing personality characteristics such as aggressiveness, humor, expertise, and even gender) – or to places and phenomena in the physical world – depending on the cues they receive from the media. Numerous studies that have evolved from the research in [[psychology]], [[social science]] and other fields indicate that this type of reaction is automatic, unavoidable, and happens more often than people realize. Reeves and Nass (1996) argue that, “Individuals’ interactions with computers, television, and new media are fundamentally social and natural, just like interactions in real life,” (p. 5).

==The Media Equation Test (1996)==
Reeves and Nass established two rules before the test- when a computer asks a user about itself, the user will give more positive responses than when a different computer asks the same questions. They expected people to be less variable with their responses when they took a test and then answered a questionnaire on the same computer. They wanted to see that computers, although not human, can implement social responses. The independent variable was the computer (there are 2 in the test), and the dependent variable was the evaluation responses. The control was a pen-and-paper questionnaire.

	Reeves and Nass designed an experiment in which 22 people come to a laboratory and told them they would be working with a computer to learn about random facts of American pop culture. At the end of the session they would ask them to evaluate the computer that they used. They would have to tell Reeves and Nass how they felt about that computer and how well it performed. 20 facts were presented in each session, and participants would answer if they knew “a great deal, somewhat, or very little” about the statement. After the session, participants were tested on the material and told which questions they had answered correctly or incorrectly. This computer, computer #1, then made a statement of its own performance, always stating that it “did a good job”.

	Participants were then divided into 2 groups to evaluate the computer’s performance and participants were asked to describe this performance from the choice of about 20 adjectives. Half of the participants were assigned to evaluate on computer #1, the computer that praised its own work. The other half were sent to another computer across the room to evaluate computer#1’s performance.

	The conclusion resulted in evaluations done on computer #1 after testing on computer #1 yielded much more positive responses about the session. Evaluations completed on the other computer after testing on computer #1 resulted in much more varied and more negative responses about the session. For the control, the pen-and-paper questionnaire, the evaluations had similar results to that of evaluations done on computer #2. Respondents felt more comfortable being honest when a different computer or paper asked about the sessions completed on computer #1. It is as if participants were talking behind the computer 1’s back- not being honest to it, but then expressing more honesty to a third party evaluator. Reeves and Nass found that participants had automatic social reactions during the test.

	Reeves and Nass ran the test again but added a voice speaker to both computers that would verbally communicate information to make the human-social theme more explicit. The test resulted in almost exactly the same results. They concluded that people are polite to computers in both verbal and textual scenarios. The respondents did not need much of a cue to respond socially to the computers. The experiment proves that social rules can apply to media and computers can be social initiators. Participants denied being intentionally polite to the computer, but the results suggest differently.

==Propositions==
The media equation relies on eight propositions derived from the research:&lt;ref&gt;Reeves and Nass, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

#Everyone responds socially and naturally to media – The media equation applies to everyone regardless of their experience, education level, age, technology proficiency, or cultures.
#Media are more similar than different – Psychologically speaking, a computer is not much different from a television and a sophisticated version of a technology is remarkably similar to a simpler version of the technology. As Reeves and Nass (1996) say, “social and natural responses come from people, not from media themselves,” (p.&amp;nbsp;252). In other words, the media does not make people react the way they do.
#The media equation is automatic – Since the media equation assumes that responses are “social and natural” then these reactions occur automatically without conscious effort. This can occur with minimal prompting.
#Many different responses characterize the media equation – The media equation occurs even with the most passive uses of media. When using any type of media, a person is likely to assign it a personality, pay extra attention to it, or even assess its personality.
#What seems true is more important than what is true – Perception of reality is far more influential than the actual objective reality. A person can know that a computer is a box made of wires and processors but can still assign a personality to it. The important point to remember is that these responses are just part of being human and participating in a communication event.
#People respond to what is present – Despite knowing that the media merely provide a symbolic version of the world, people still tend to respond to what the media ''appears to be'' as if it were real and immediately present. For the most part, people are more concerned with the interpretation of cues or messages they receive, rather than trying to determine the original intention of the message's creators.
#People like simplicity – The need for simplicity and to reduce complexity is an innate human need. People are comfortable with simple. Simplicity indicates a level of predictability that makes people more comfortable.
#Social and natural is easy – When interacting with media, Reeves and Nass (1996) argue, “people should be able to use what comes naturally – rules for social relationships and rules for navigating the physical world,” (p.&amp;nbsp;255). People already know how to function in the natural world (be polite, how to handle difficult personalities) so designers should take these reactions and phenomena into consideration when designing new media.

==Research-based findings==
The assumptions and conclusions of the media equation are based on a rigorous research agenda that relies on objective empirical data using reliable social science research methods. As Reeves and Nass (1996) explain, “Our strategy for learning about media was to go to the social science section of the library, find theories and experiments about human-human interaction – and then borrow…Take out a pen, cross out ‘human’ or ‘environment’ and substitute media. When we did this, all of the predictions and experiments led to the media equation: People’s responses to media are fundamentally social and natural,” (p.&amp;nbsp;251). 
The empirical data to support the media equation is thorough and expansive. Studies have tested a wide variety of communication characteristics with the media – manners, personality, emotion, social roles and form. Below are explanations of some of the more interesting findings that support the media equation.

===Politeness===
Politeness is one measure that researchers have used to study [[human-computer interaction]]. Being polite is an automatic response in most interpersonal interactions. When a person asks a question about themselves, most people will give a positive response, even if it may be a dishonest answer, to avoid hurting the other person’s feelings. To test this idea with human-computer interaction, researchers designed an experiment in which participants would work with a computer on a tutoring exercise.&lt;ref&gt;Nass, Moon, and Carney, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; The computer would provide them with a fact about American culture and then provide supplemental information. The computer then prompted participants to take a test to evaluate what they have learned. After completing the tests participants were asked to evaluate the computer’s performance. The participants were assigned to one of three conditions – a pencil and paper evaluation, an evaluation on a different computer, or an evaluation on the same computer. The results indicate that participants who were asked to evaluate the same computer gave the computer more positive feedback than the other two conditions. To learn more about this experiment, see Nass, Moon, &amp; Carney, 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Nass, Moon, and Carney, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

===Negativity===
In psychology there is a law of hedonic asymmetry that says evaluations of good and bad are important but not the same; negative experiences tend to dominate. In other words, people tend to dwell on the negative more than the positive.&lt;ref&gt;Reeves and Nass, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Responses to negative situations are automatic and require more attention to process than positive experiences. Allocating more resources to process negative information takes away from resources available to process positive information, thus impeding one’s ability to remember events preceding the negative event. The media equation suggests that people have a similar experience when they encounter a negative experience with media. A study was developed to examine the idea that “negative images retroactively inhibit memory for material that precedes them, while they proactively enhance memory for material that follows them,” (Newhagen &amp; Reeves, 1992, p.&amp;nbsp;25). In other words, will watching negative images on the news prevent someone from remembering information that they learned just prior to viewing the negative material? And conversely, will they better remember information they received just after viewing the negative material?

In the study,&lt;ref&gt;Newhagen and Reeves, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; researchers created two versions of the same news story – one with compelling negative images and one without. Participants were asked to watch a 20-minute news video (half of the participants saw the negative images and the other half did not) and an additional ten-minute video. They were instructed to pay attention because they would be tested afterwards. A follow up survey was sent 6 to 7 weeks later to measure memory and recall from the news video. The results support the idea that people better remember information that comes after a negative event. Respondents who viewed the negative images better remembered the second half of the newscast than the part preceding the negative images. The findings of this study further support the media equation assumption that mediated experiences are the same as natural experiences.

For a more in depth look at this study, see Newhagen &amp; Reeves, 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Newhagen and Reeves, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teammates===
Psychology has demonstrated that being a part of a team has a direct influence on attitude and behavior of team members. Members of a team think they are more similar to each other than people on the outside. There are two main characteristics that define team interactions – identity and interdependence. For a group to become a team the members must identify with each other and exhibit some degree of interdependence on each other. These two characteristics were tested to determine if a computer can be a teammate.

In this study,&lt;ref&gt;Nass, Fogg, Moon, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; participants were assigned to one of two conditions. In the first condition they would be paired with a computer and would become the blue team. The computer had a blue sticker and the human wore a blue wristband to signify that they were in fact a team. The second condition was blue individual, in which a person would use a computer but they were not considered teammates, rather the computer was just a resource. The task was to complete a “Desert Survival Guide” activity in which participants rank items they deem most important if they were left on a deserted island. Human participants initially completed the activity on their own and then completed it using a computer (either as a teammate where both the computer and human were evaluated or just using the computer as a resource). Finally, the participants were allowed to revise their rankings, if they wished to do so. The results of this study indicated that participants who worked with the computer as a teammate viewed the computer as more like them, worked in a similar style to their own, was more cooperative and friendlier than people who worked individually. Another finding of this study showed that participants who worked with the computer as a teammate were more likely to change their behavior and conform to the group ideal even when the teammate was a computer. This study supports the notion that developing a sense of interdependency is the key to establishing team affiliation.
For a more detailed account of this study, see Nass, Fogg, &amp; Moon, 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Nass, Fogg, Moon, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

These are just a few of the many studies that support the media equation. For more in depth reading on this subject and past studies, see the “Further Reading” section at the end of this article.

==Alternative explanations==
Some alternative explanations for the media equation have been proposed.  But, as Nass and Moon (2000)&lt;ref&gt;Nass and Moon, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; argue, these explanations do not add up to the body of empirical evidence that supports media equation.  One explanation is that people attribute human characteristics to computers, also known as [[anthropomorphism]]. Nass and Moon (2000) refute this claim, saying, “Participants in our experiment were adult, [[experienced computer user]]s. When debriefed, they insisted that they would never respond socially to a computer, and vehemently denied the specific behavior they had in fact exhibited during the experiments,” (p.&amp;nbsp;93). A second argument against media equation is that participants are actually responding to the programmers behind the computer. Nass and Moon (2000) refute this argument by citing that studies involving multiple computers generally found differences in interactions from computer to computer. If a person was interacting with the programmer behind the computer, then there would be no difference in interaction between computers. Critics have also argued that the way the experiments and questionnaires were designed in the Stanford research may have predisposed their subjects to interact socially with technology. Nass and Moon (2000) counter-argued by saying that the experiments were not misleading. None of the computers used in the experiments were personalized; the computer never referred to itself as “I” and participants interacted with simple text on a screen.

===Grice's Maxims===
Reeves and Nass explain that [[Paul Grice|H. Paul Grice’s]] [[Cooperative principle|maxims for politeness]] are perhaps the most generally accepted rules on politeness communication and that Grice's rules are a vital basis to explaining the media equation. The four principles consist of Quality, Quantity, Clarity, and Relevance. Reeves and Nass used these principles to help explain how they believed computers could be social actors. Quality refers to how information presented in a conversation should have value, truth, and importance. Quantity refers to how speakers in interaction should present just the right amount of information to make the conversation as useful as possible. Too much or too little information may damage value of information. Reeves and Nass argue that quantity is not something social media executed very well; they feel it causes frustration because computers display too much or too little information to humans when trying to communicate. Relevance refers to the content of information being translated into an interaction- this information should be both relevant and on-topic. Reeves and Nass argue that computers should be customizable so the user has control over relevance, and they observed how computers struggle to respond to wishes or goals of the user.

	Reeves and Nass argue that Grice’s maxims are vital guidelines to the media equation because violations of these rules have a social significance. If one side of social interaction violates a rule, it may come off to the other party as a lack of attention being paid, or a diminishing of the importance of the conversation; in other words, they get offended. This leads to a negative consequence for both the party that violated a rule and to the value of conversation.

'''''The Shape of Time: Remarks on the History of Things''''' is a short book by [[George Kubler]], published in 1962 by Yale University Press. It presents an approach to historical change which challenges the notion of [[style (visual arts)|style]] by placing the history of objects and images in a larger continuum. Kubler proposes new forms of historical sequencing where objects and images provide solutions to evolving problems.  Kubler lays out a perspective where processes of innovation, replication, and mutation are in continuous conversation through time.

==Chapter 1: The History of Things==

Kubler begins the chapter by discussing "The Limitations of Biography" where he lays out the problems encountered when thinking about objects through the histories of their makers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Giulio Angioni]], ''Miseria e nobiltà della tecnica'', in ''Fare, dire, sentire: l'identico e il diverso nelle culture'', Il Maestrale 2011, pp. 71-76&lt;/ref&gt; Within this section he discusses the importance of the point of entrance of the individual maker into the ongoing history of their objects, the role of biological and physical metaphors, and the relation between scientists and artists.

When looking back at the history of things, the historian using biological metaphors is not useful. "Purpose has no place in biology, but history has no meaning without it" (8). Kubler chose the phrase the "history of things" with the intention of rejoining objects with their ideas. The pursuit of the historian is to "identify and reconstruct" problems, actions, and solutions. "We always may be sure that every man-made thing arises from a problem as a purposeful solution" (8). In ''The Shape of Time'', Kubler considers all man-made objects with the idea that everything is invented because of human desire and need.

While both scientists and artists are inventors, one creates solutions to solve physical problems while the other spiritual. Their histories share traits of invention, change and obsolescence (10). Although, at the same time has its extreme differences. The mechanics of a tool may be complicated but is always "intrinsically simple" (11). while a work of art may appear simple yet hold the most complex set of thoughts.

Kubler also discusses the role of the historian, the nature of actuality, and lays out his idea of self-signals and adherent signals.

'''Talent and Genius'''

The comparisons between talent and genius are explored in regard to time and degree.  [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Raphael]] are provided as examples; to debate between who is more talented is a moot point.  Both were extremely talented artists but the other artists of the time "came late when the feast was over through no fault of their own" (7).  The ideas of 'nature vs. nurture' in regard to the inheritable traits of genius; Kubler concludes that genius is indeed a result of 'nurture' as learning is not a biological concern.

==Chapter 2: The Classing of Things==
This chapter begins with Kubler's thoughts about the way objects become sequences. He discusses the difference between the existence of objects created from short term fashionable durations versus objects that provide solutions to concrete or conceptual problems.

'''Prime Object and Replications'''

A Prime Object is an original - whether that be an actual object or an idea. Replications are the reproductions of the Prime Object.
It is often difficult to trace or track the origin of a prime occurrence as we typically see the offspring and relatives to the prime through replications and mutations. Frequently a perceived Prime Object is the result of subtle changes to a true Prime Object through: social, economic or political influences. The person copying the prime object will never have the same circumstances or feelings as the original maker. Investigating the history of an object or idea can give clues as to how authentic is the Prime Object. It is equally difficult to generate a prime occurrence, which is why replicating one is a more prevalent practice.
For example today's hammer is generally various permutations of a "T" shaped object with a metal head placed on a wooden handle - if the entire object itself is not metal. The Prime Object of that hammer may have been a rock used to pound something into the ground.

The problem with classifying a Prime Object is knowing when we are in the presence of a prime object, especially since most (if not all) objects that we come across are really replications of a previous concept. Quite often, Primes are not evident without a significant amount of replications, over a significant period of time, to observe that something influential and indivisible of its parts has presented itself: "When we consider the class of these great moments, we are usually confronted with dead stars. Even their light has ceased to reach us. We know of their existence only indirectly, by their perturbations, and by the immense detritus of derivative stuff left in their paths."

At this point in Chapter 2 Kubler compares great moments in art and inspired ideas to "dead stars". This is an interesting metaphor because of the mythology behind dead stars. On the planet earth it takes many years to see the death of a star, because of the great distance between the stars and the earth. The light of a dead star still can be seen as from earth because when the light began to travel visually to earth the star was still an existence.  When applied to that of an idea it is an interesting parallel. Do viewers of art and artists themselves know the style is already dead and outdated because of the constant evolution of ideas and artistic trends, do they know they are seeing a dying star's last light?

'''Mutants'''

Mutations of a Prime Object occur when a replication of the original concept becomes better, or different, than the original.  The rock might have been the earliest form of a hammer, but it was improved when someone tied a handle onto the rock so it would swing harder and faster.  Another example is a family recipe that is handed down from generation to generation.  Each new generation working with that family recipe may make small changes improving the taste or look of the food.  The later manifestations of that original recipe tend to be even better than the Prime Source.

'''Adherent and Self-signals'''

The self-signal, as Kubler contends, is the obvious purpose of objects—artwork or tool. The self-signal of a hammer, for example, is its "mute declaration" that its intended use is to be grasped by the handle, thus extending the individual's fist through the peen for driving a nail into a plank(24). The adherent signal of the hammer is the patent and protected trademark of a specific manufacturing address stamped on the handle. Using the example of fine art, Kubler explains that the self-signal of a painting is its colors and their arrangement on the two-dimensional surface that alerts the viewer to concede to a visual language that will produce enjoyment. "Part of the self-signal," writes Kubler, "is that thousands of years of painting still have not exhausted the possibilities of such an apparent simple category of sensation" (24, 25). The adherent signal of the painting is, for example, the culturally recognized depiction of a well-known myth or historical scene.

Kubler points out that neither adherent signals, which speak only of meaning, nor self-signals, which prove only existence, are enough to assign value to a tool or artwork. The combination of the two is key. As Kubler explains, "...existence without meaning seems terrible in the same degree as meaning without existence seems trivial" (25).

'''Serial Appreciation'''

Kubler declares that nearly everything is based from an original object.  Whether the copy, manipulated or not, is better or worse than the original ultimately does not matter; The object is still a copy.  However, it is up to the maker to decide how to mutate the original as well as to create another domain for the object.  The maker is the one who subconsciously creates boundaries on the object thus limiting its full potential.

Kubler notes that art has "an unmistakable erosion" (46) that wears down any work of art.  This 'erosion' is particularly caused from the artist's failing to describe the process that was needed to obtain the finished piece as well as "the steps in the artist's elaboration of his conceptions."  Some of these descriptions may be trivial but what lies between the trivial and the factual is the work.

'''Solitary and Gregarious Artist'''

Kubler says that "Today the artist is neither a rebel nor an entertainer."(53) he explains how art is affected by different personalities.  He explains how more social personalities work well in music and theatre while introverted personalities are more common in visual art.   However, even within visual art a certain amount of sociability allows for artists to be more in tune with their clients and rivals. The social artist has even been used as a kind of entertainment in royal houses.  He has also used social characteristics to rebel. However, Kubler ends the section saying that the artist no longer functions as an entertainer or rebel.  "More lonely than ever, the artist today is like Dedalus, the strange artificer of wonderful and frightening surprises for his immediate circle."(53)
 
The revelation of the prime is often revealed in hindsight when history presents itself distant and more easily observed.  The momentary actions of our everyday lives are herald by a much greater force of previous history.  Therefore each action is a compression and replication of the past.  The unique personality reforms the replica as prime by an erosion of its former manifestation understanding of its conceptual replication and places it within contemporary language.

==Chapter 3: The Propagation of Things==
This chapter is concerned with the use of things and examines the point when they become less viable and gradually discarded. There are several topics that Kubler addresses in this chapter: invention and variation, replication, discard and retention. Society is hurt by both too much replication and too much invention. Stagnation occurs when ideas and objects are perpetually replicated, and chaos ensues when society is bombarded with numerous inventions.  In discussing artistic invention, Kubler makes an important distinction between artistic invention and useful invention. Kubler states, "In rough terms, artistic invention is one among many ways of altering the set of the mind, while useful invention marks out the scope of the knowledge the instrument was previously designed to encompass"(66).  Kubler shows that there is a certain complicated logic to the propagation of things, and it is important to follow the different patterns of change in ideas and things.

Kubler considers several ideas surrounding the development of things in the world.  He examines the ways in which our conceptions of time and our attitudes toward change affect the invention, replication, discard, and retention of objects and discusses useful and artistic invention.  These concepts are differentiated in their effect upon humans; thus, artistic inventions change perceptions of our reality and our situation within it, while useful inventions hew more to an alteration of our quotidian needs and concerns based in our physical concrete experiences.  Kubler asserts that society dislikes change to a degree that militates against invention, resulting in a circumstance where it is only those few who escape the bonds of "convention" who produce true inventions.

He posits two manners of this production. The first has to do with the meeting of previously divergent information whose conflux results in a new awareness of solutions or the coming together of "practice" and "principle." The second way in which things develop is more resonant of pure invention, in that the inventor creates solely by means of his own engagement with his milieu: the invention.  In this case, the invention is experientially and theoretically untied to earlier thinking.  Kubler states that an artistic invention does not relate to previous solutions in a formal sequence as readily as a useful invention will.

The useful object, because of its very nature, will proceed by smaller incremental steps to advance through its refinements and toward its greater complexity. Therefore, in Kubler's thinking, there may be no perceptible links between two iterations in an artistic sequence of things, the transformations apparently being magical or immediate, while we may easily apprehend the links in a chain of useful inventions. Replication of the object, in Kubler's terms, is rife with a natural variation produced through inevitable minute changes within the production process. It is thus impossible to reproduce an object with exactitude, which in Kubler's mind results in an inexorable "drift" away from the object's manifestation at inception. Kubler notes that this movement of a replica over time may be either toward or away from quality. If a replica moves toward betterment, it may arise from our natural wish to improve upon a model, or native talent in a practitioner. When a replica's quality decreases, it may be the result either of economic factors, or the manufacturer's lack of ability in comprehending the whole of the object. The replica, according to Kubler, has to do with regular occurrences, of things which happen at regular intervals; thus, it is time-based. The invention, on the other hand, appertains to the historical and to variations and change within the object. Kubler contends that invention without replication "would approach chaos", whereas extended replication without the intervention of invention would conclude in "formlessness".

Kubler claims that we tend to retain the artistic or aesthetic object for a longer time than a useful object (resulting in a longer duration of the sequence) because the useful object can only fulfill one function in our world, whereas an artistic object, in its appeals to our metaphysical lives, and its putative enhancement of them, remains of greater value to us. This more total disappearance of the useful object results in more thoroughly closed sequences. (An example of a closed sequence in the world of the useful object is the buggy whip, which was rendered obsolete through the invention of the automobile.) The ways in which we think about change and respond to our environments, in Kubler's estimation, govern not only the rate at which inventions are made, but also whether we choose to retain them, and to what extent they remain in our consciousness after the fact.

==Chapter 4: Some Kinds of Duration==
'''Fast and Slow Happening'''

Time has a multitude of different "categorical varieties" (84). From the "gravitational field[s]...in the cosmos" to the "different systems of intervals and periods" of humans, animals, and nature, time is so diverse that it is hard to "describe all the...kinds of duration" (84).  There are artifacts that "are so durable" they may be able to surpass time (84). In looking at the "history more than the future of man-made things", we can make an assessment of how to deduce the "rate of change" (84).  Social Scientists use a "quantitative" model, in describing "material culture" (84). They look at things in broad strokes to make "assessments of cultural effort" (84). However, the existence of so many replicas and copies in our world, clue us into "an altogether different rule of order", in which the public feeds and functions off of the things that already exist (85).  We have been working off of prime objects since the beginning of time. We must look at the "sequence of forms" which have stemmed from the original primes, in order to "explore the nature of change" (85).

'''Inventors and Artists Role in the Progress of Ideas'''

Kubler discusses how the general public is not interested in furthering the progress of culture.  The masses are content with copies or replications of an idea; these copies are still recognizably linked to the thought, object, or idea being copied.  This general public merely requires modest updating, little change of the actual object.  "Public demand recognizes only what exists, unlike the inventors and artists whose minds turn more upon future possibilities, whose speculations and combinations obey an altogether different rule of order, described here as a linked progression of experiments composing a formal sequence" (85).  Artists challenge the limitations of their historical time and view change as an opportunity to create a unique occurrence.  These occurrences are only possible within the structure of a formal sequence of development. These new inventions need to make sense, or to answer a need, or curiosity on the part of the artist/inventor. Within these new events change can occur gradually or quickly.  Kubler examines the temperaments of artists and how temperament influences their work.  Some artists work within the current tradition, finding new ways to progress its development into uncharted territories.  This artist is able to perceive what others have not and expands upon the current environment. "Sometimes the map seems finished: nothing more can be added; the class of forms looks closed until another patient man takes a challenge from the seemingly complete situation, and succeeds once more in enlarging it" (88). Kubler juxtaposes these artists with a different type of artist that he refers to as the "versatile men" (88).  He describes how the entrance of the versatile artist occurred during an historical time of "social and technical renovation" (88).  These "fast happening" artists push the artistic tradition far into the future; these prolific artists are "adumbrating another new series before the one in which they are engaged has been played out" (89). Artists are the visionaries throughout the continuum of time.

'''The Shapes of Time'''

It is difficult to categorize time due to the lack of a measuring constant or "fixed scale."  Kubler notes, "History has no periodic table of elements, and no classification of types or species . . . no theory of temporal structure" (96).  A series of events that occur quickly is described as dense; whereas, "a slow succession with many interruptions is sparse" (97).  In regard to art history, works of art occur in sequences and are grouped together to be understood in a certain way.  He uses paintings of the [[Twelve Apostles]] as an example ('''Apostolado'' by [[Zurbarán]]); individually they can stand alone, but grouped together there is more of a sense of the artist's intention of how they are to be viewed and interpreted: "usually our comprehension of a thing is incomplete until its positional value can be reconstructed" (97).  In addition to art, architecture (as well as public fixtures or monuments) is to be read the same way, "buildings in their settings are a sequence of spaces best seen in an order intended by the architect" (97).

'''Periods and Their Lengths'''

Kubler already establishes that there are two standards of duration, "absolute age" and "systematic age."  He sees these as different "envelopes" of time established by the content of each segment of time.  He focuses on the overall shapes of time at this point, rather than a personal diminutive shape of time, that may span one human life or a collective duration of more life spans.  Using a broad scope of time segments, Kubler divides the segments into "families" that scale from smallest to largest.  The smallest being the "annual crop of fashions" which he backs up with contemporary and historical patterns, and the largest, which he says are few, are our defined periods in history: "Western Civilization, Asiatic culture, prehistoric to barbarian and primitive societies" (91).  The areas of time in-between the smallest and the largest are measured by our calendars and our mathematical methods of measurement.

Kubler returns to the manageable interval of a year, thinking that this span is a known and workable measurement of duration as a tractable system of time duration.  He explains how different cultures measure in different modes or segments: the Roman [[lustrum]], a census occurring every five years or the [[Aztec]] practice of measuring in durations of 52 years (4 sections of 13 years instead of a 100-year century) called [[Calendar Round]]. The Aztecs understood this duration to be an estimate of an adult life, a perception of time duration as it relates to human life duration.

Kubler seems to like the idea of linking time duration to human life or generational spans, that perhaps a century could be thought of as three life spans.  He uses fashion, the smallest family of time duration, as a resurfacing measurement suggesting that the interest and tastes of the older grandparent generation would appeal to the youngest generation, the grandchildren. This would make for a reusable system of measurement duration neatly tucked into a century; however, Kubler notes that most of these smaller events of happenings cycle through just about every fifty years, halfway through a century and are subject to other segments of happenings outside the specific event.

'''The Indiction as Module'''

These thoughts of life or generational duration can be thought of as outdated due to the increase in our current life expectancy.  Technological advances have increased our quality of life; therefore, there is no calendrical duration correlating with individual life expectancies.  When analyzing the age classes (infant, child, adolescent, young adult, mature adult, and old adult), Kubler applies the working lifetime for an artist: 60 years, with 50 of the years at full working capacity.  The artist's life can be categorized into four periods:"preparation, early, middle, and late maturity, each lasting about 15 years, resemble the indictions of the Roman calendar" (102).  Very similar to the duration of an artist is the time required to develop significant movements in art history.  It takes about 60 years for the development of an object and another 60 years for its "first systematic applications" (102).  Kubler uses changes in Greek vase painting; the appearance changed in two stages, about every sixty years.  Examples that support his 60-year theory are the doubled 60-year durations, such as the Mayan sculpture in the fourth and fifth centuries as well as Japanese woodblock prints around 1650.

==Critical reviews==

[[Neil McGregor]], director of the [[British Museum]], stated, "Kubler's telling of the history of things remains a key text, his vision a compelling mixture of the habitual and the poetic in human behavior. For him, human creativity is a constantly repeated attempt to refine answers to a set of questions that change only slowly. But this universal habit is punctuated by the great works of art, ways of doing and seeing that he compares to stars, influencing, shaping and illuminating even after they have been destroyed."&lt;ref&gt;McGregor, Neil http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300100617&lt;/ref&gt;

Priscilla Colt of the [[Dayton Art Museum]] reviewed ''The Shape of Time'' in ''Art Journal'' in 1963.  She identified five major themes in the work including a critical views of, "1) the separation of the history of art and the history of science... 2) all cyclical theories of cultural change, especially those using the biological metaphor of life stages... 3) the biological and narrative approaches to art history... 4) the severing of meaning and form... 5) the concept of style as a means of classification... ." Another crucial aspect she identifies is the "coexistence of several formal sequences within one object and, it follows, in a given present".  She uses the example of a cathedral, which embodies traits from different sequences and systems.  The ability of this theory to return the object to the flow of time, rather than pin it to a certain time period, is appealing to her.  She regards Kubler's theory of the Prime Object as a difficulty in the theory, due to the difficulty in describing the qualities that a Prime Object embodies.  If we are reduced to describing objects in terms of the traits that they possess, "are we not arriving again at an historical concept very close to that of style in some of its more refined interpretations?"  Colt believes that ''The Shape of Time'' "makes proposals rather than putting forth adamant claims" and believes that it will "evoke fruitful thinking along productively new lines".&lt;ref&gt;Colt, Priscilla (1963). '''Review: [untitled]'''. ''Art Journal'', Vol. 23, No. 1 (Autumn, 1963), pp. 78-79.Published by: College Art Association&lt;/ref&gt;

Kubler himself responded to this review nearly 20 years later in the journal ''Perspecta'' in an article titled ''The Shape of Time. Reconsidered''.  He claimed that Priscilla Colt provided "a summary of the book so concise that I have nothing to change in it, nor would I do it better".&lt;ref&gt;Kubler, George (1982). '''The Shape of Time. Reconsidered'''. ''Perspecta'', Vol. 19, pp. 112-121. Published by: The MIT Press on behalf of Perspecta.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on artists of the 1960s==

Several prominent artists in were influenced by and wrote about the ideas presented in ''The Shape of Time''.  The abstract painter [[Ad Reinhardt]] reviewed Kubler's book in an article for ''ArtNews'' in 1966.  This article, along with many other of Reinhardt's writings were included in ''Art as Art'' edited by [[Barbara Rose]], [[University of California Press]], 1991.  Another artist who referred to ''The Shape of Time'' in his writing and thinking was the seminal land artist [[Robert Smithson]].  In an article titled ''Quasi-Infinities and the Waning of Space'' Smithson discusses Kubler's thoughts about time and communication across time, as well as his theory of Prime Objects.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Pamela (2001). '''"Ultramoderne": Or, How George Kubler Stole the Time in Sixties Art'''. Grey Room, No. 2, pp. 46-77&lt;/ref&gt;

In her book titled ''Robert Smithson: Learning from New Jersey and Elsewhere'', Anne Reynolds highlights George Kubler's influence on Smithson and how differently from Kubler he believed in an "equality between... prime [objects] and the replication"(147).  Pages 145, 146, and 147 have additional examples about the ways in which Smithson disagreed with Kubler's theories about ''prime object'' and ''replica mass''.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Anne {{cite web |url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=10326 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604125350/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=10326 |archivedate=2011-06-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conceptual Artist [[John Baldessari]] made a painting based on Kubler's ideas titled ''Painting for Kubler'' 1966-68, which sold May 13, 2009 at Christie's "Post-war and Contemporary Art Evening Sale" for $1,874,500. [http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=5204553]

==Concerns raised==
A frequent concern about Kubler's text is that it is a dense and difficult read. Kubler himself acknowledges this issue but asserts that without the controversy the book would lack a relevant and defining feature. In his 1982 lecture, "The Shape of Time, Reconsidered" which appears in ''Perspecta'' (Volume 19, MIT Press) Kubler writes, "I was surprised, while preparing this lecture, to notice how, among my friends who had read the book, a division into two groups appeared. Both groups are equally discerning and educated, and as far as I can tell, equal in numbers. One group is eager to say that they don't understand a word of it, and there are artists and historians among them. Those of the other group claim that they understood it all on first reading, without difficulty. Of course I believe them both, without understanding the combination that separates them so sharply. Perhaps distinctive and contrasting features in the comprehension of works of art are responsible. What I say speaks to some, but not to others. Some are ready, and others are not. But when both someday find that they agree in understanding it, that day may be its last as a book alive in the dissension over its intelligibility." Kubler's text has been compared by some to reading a work by Shakespeare; spending time with it rewards the diligent reader. Once recurrent themes are grasped, the language becomes more comprehensible.

There have been comments that Kubler offers many variables and possibilities but no concrete and identifiable system of categorizing frames of codification. Kubler's opinion that there is no one system, but many systems to judge a particular event, is intrinsic to his view that trying to identify a closed system would be hypocritical to his primary premise. All events and ways to measure these events evolve and shift with calendrical time.

In considering Kubler's model for the 60 year change duration (Chapter 4) it has been suggested that a new type of cycle might be considered and researched considering that the advent of the new media millennia was just in the infant stages at the 1st edition of ''The Shape Of Time.'' With the advent of new distribution systems and accessibility to a new paradigm of existence, the 60-year cycle may be an outdated model. For example, hyper-acceleration and globalization of knowledge may induce change as rapidly as the internet changed the way we shop, acquire information, or share ideas.

'''Sir Théodore Turquet de Mayerne''' (28 September 1573 &amp;ndash; 22 March 1655) was a  [[Republic and Canton of Geneva#History|Genevan]]-born physician who treated kings of France and England and advanced the theories of [[Paracelsus]].
==The Young Doctor==
Mayerne was born in a [[Huguenot]] family in [[Geneve]], Republic of Geneva. His father was a [[Huguenot|Protestant French]] historian who had fled [[Lyon]] following the [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]] and his godfather was [[Theodore Beza]]. Mayerne's first wife was Marguerite de Boetslaer and they had three children.

Mayerne studied first in [[Geneve]] and later moved to the [[University of Heidelberg]]. Later he moved to [[Montpellier]] to study [[medicine]], graduated 1596 and received his doctorate in 1597. His dissertation defended the use of chemical remedies in medicine, under the guidance of [[Joseph du Chesne]]; this was the first intimation of his interest in Paracelsian theories. In May 1599, Mayerne joined [[Henri de Rohan]], a Huguenot nobleman very powerful in Brittany, on his grand tour of Europe, visiting Germany, Italy, Bohemia, the Netherlands, England, and Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor-Roper, ''Europe's Physician'', p. 44-46&lt;/ref&gt; During their visit to London in October 1600, Rohan and Mayerne were received by Queen [[Elizabeth I]] at her court, and in November 1600, when they reached [[Edinburgh]], they were received by King [[James VI]], before returning to France in early 1601.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor-Roper, ''Europe's Physician'', p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his austere Calvinism, Mayerne greatly admired the many works of art and architecture he saw in his travels in Germany and Italy, especially liking the paintings of [[Albrecht Dürer]] and the ''[[Kunstkammer]]'' in Munich of curios kept by the [[Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria|Duke of Bavaria]].&lt;ref&gt;Trevor-Roper, ''Europe's Physician'', p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Paris Years==
Mayerne moved to Paris, lecturer on [[anatomy]] and [[pharmacy]] and founded a [[medical practice]]. By that time he had begun to support the views of Paracelsus and used many chemical remedies. He kept detailed notes about his patients, among them Armand du Plessis, later [[Cardinal Richelieu]], whom he treated for [[gonorrhea]] in 1605.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor-Roper, ''Europe's Physician'', p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1600 French [[royal physician]] [[Jean Ribit de la Rivière]] (1571–1605) sponsored him to become one of the personal physicians, physician in ordinary, of the king [[Henry IV of France|Henri IV]].&lt;ref&gt;Kahn, p. 360&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trevor-Roper, « Paris, 1598 - 1601 »&lt;/ref&gt; His other pursuits were thwarted because he was not a Catholic and because most French physicians still followed the principles of [[Galen]]. In 1603 he tried to support his views to Medical Faculty of Paris, stating that his views were not opposed to Galenic and [[Hippocrates|Hippocratic]] principles.

Despite their opposition, he retained the favour of the King, who appointed him to travel with the [[Henri, Duc de Rohan|Duc de Rohan]] in his diplomatic missions to Germany and Italy. When the King intended to make Mayerne his first physician, the queen opposed the decision because Mayerne refused to convert to Catholicism. Mayerne continued in his lower post until 1606 when he sold it to another physician.

At this time he continued his association with du Chesne and the circle of [[Hermeticists]] that had grown up around him. These devotees of Paracelsus believed they were reviving the wisdom of the mythical pre-[[Platonism|Platonic]] natural philosophers - men known as the ''prisci theologi'' that included [[Zoroaster]] and [[Hermes Trismegistus]]. The [[alchemical]] nature of their experiments was greatly resented by Galenists at the [[University of Paris]].

In the same year he briefly visited England by invitation and met [[James I of England|James I]]. He became a physician of [[Anne of Denmark]] and was incorporated at [[Oxford]] on April 8, 1606. He probably spent the following years back in France.

==Life in England==
When Henri IV was murdered in 1610, Mayerne moved to England, again by invitation. In 1611 he became first physician of James I and his queen and also treated most members of the royal court, including Sir [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Robert Cecil]] and [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales]]. His inability to successfully treat those two individuals, together with his closeness to the scandal surrounding the murder of [[Thomas Overbury|Sir Thomas Overbury]] coloured his first years in England. Nevertheless, he was sometimes sent on diplomatic missions to France.

In 1616 Mayerne was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal College of Physicians]]. He helped the [[Society of Apothecaries]] to obtain a [[royal charter]] separate from the Grocers and helped to found the [[Company of Distillers]]. King [[knighthood|knighted]] him in 1624. Next year he briefly visited Switzerland, where he had become Baron [[Aubonne, Switzerland|Aubonne]]. Mayerne retained his post as a first physician after the accession of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in 1625.

He successfully championed the effort to produce the first official [[pharmacopoeia]], which would specify treatments that [[apothecaries]] should provide for specific ailments. In this he included chemical remedies, which were easier to introduce in Protestant England than in Catholic France.

In 1628 his wife died and in 1630 he married Elizabeth Joachimi. They had five children but only one daughter survived. At about this time he treated [[Oliver Cromwell]] for a variety of physical and emotional symptoms, including a severe depression. In response to [[the Plague of 1630]], he suggested the institution of a centralized 'Office of Health', with free royal hospitals, trained officials, and regulatory power.

During the [[English Civil War]] Mayerne kept a low profile in his practice in London and retained the favour of the parliament. After the [[execution of Charles I]] in 1649, he became nominal physician to [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] but soon retired to [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]].

Mayerne died at Chelsea on 22 March 1654 or 1655. He was buried in [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]] with most of his family and his godson Sir Theodore des Vaux sponsored a monument for him. Des Vaux later published Mayerne's medical notes in the book ''Praxis Medica'' in 1690.

==Legacy==

Mayerne compiled the so-called 'de Mayerne manuscript' between 1620 and 1646 based on conversations with painters (and others). The manuscript includes contributions from [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], [[Anthony van Dyck|van Dyck]], [[Daniël Mijtens|Mytens]], [[Paul van Somer I|Paul van Somer]], and [[Cornelis Janssens van Ceulen|Cornelius Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/paintings/cornelis-jonson-van-ceulen-i-portrait-of-5666153-details.aspx?pos=3&amp;intObjectID=5666153&amp;sid=&amp;page=4 Christies Auction Catalogue; lot notes, lot 45]&lt;/ref&gt; His estate included copious amount of medical manuscripts, including detailed notes about his patients, most of it in Latin and French; his patients ranged from [[John Donne]] to [[Oliver Cromwell]]. His papers are kept in the [[Royal College of Physicians]].

His influence on the administration of medicine - including the first suggestion of [[socialized medicine]] in England, and the standardisation of chemical cures, has been widely recognised.

His 'Paracelsian' outlook, which viewed the world as 'abounding in chemical secrets waiting to be exploited', led him to devise projects to enhance Scottish coal mines, to reopen lead mines in Europe and to monopolize oyster beds. He made [[chemistry|chemical]] and physical experiments, created [[pigment]]s and [[cosmetics]], introduced [[calomel]] to medical use and created ''black-wash'' (lotio nigra). It also led him to an interest in cooking, and he grew obese in later years.

In 1634, he wrote the introduction for and edited one of the first treatises ever published on Insects (usually attributed to [[Thomas Muffet]]), under the title ''Insectorum, sive minimorum animalium Theatrum: Olim ab Edoardo Wottono, Conrado Gesnero, Thomaque Pennio inchoatum: Tandem Tho. Moufeti Londinâtis operâ sumptibusque maximis concinnatum, auctum, perfectum: Et ad vivum expressis Iconibus suprà quingentis illustratum. Londini ex Officinâ typographicâ Thom. Cotes. Et venales extant apud Benjam. Allen, in diverticulo, quod Anglicè dicitur Popes-head Alley.''

'''Toothing''' was originally a [[hoax]] claim that [[Bluetooth]]-enabled [[mobile phone]]s or [[Personal Digital Assistant|PDAs]] were being used to arrange random [[Human sexual behavior|sexual encounters]], perpetrated as a prank on the media who reported it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|language = Spanish |title=Sexting, toothing y upskirting |url= http://www.lanacion.cl/prontus_noticias_v2/site/artic/20090530/pags/20090530183343.html |work=[[La Nación]] |date=May 31, 2009 |accessdate=2009-06-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The hoax was created by [[Ste Curran]], then Editor at Large at the gaming magazine ''[[Edge (games magazine)|Edge]]'', and ex-journalist Simon Byron. They based it on the two concepts [[Dogging (sexual slang)|dogging]] and [[bluejacking]] that were popular at the time. The creators started a forum in March 2004 where they wrote fake news articles about toothing with other members and then sent them off to well-known Internet-based news services. The point of the hoax was to "highlight how journalists are happy to believe something is true without necessarily checking the facts". Dozens of news organizations, including [[BBC News]], [[Wired News]], and ''[[The Independent]]'' thought the toothing story was real and printed it. On April 4, 2005, Curran and Byron admitted that the whole thing was a hoax. There have, however, been real Bluetooth dating devices to hit the market since.

==Conception==
Devised by Swedish telecommunication company [[Ericsson]], [[Bluetooth]] is an [[Open standard|open]] [[wireless]] protocol for exchanging data over short distances from mobile devices such as mobile phones, laptops, and personal computers. Originally, Bluetooth was only intended for wireless exchanging of files between these devices, but it was later discovered that it could also be used for sexual intentions.&lt;ref name="Haaretz"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=631721&amp;contrassID=1&amp;subContrassID=1&amp;sbSubContrassID=0&amp;listSrc=Y|title=The fast food of sex |last=Dam |first=Alon|date=November 2, 2005|work=[[Haaretz]]|accessdate=2009-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hoax concept of toothing started around March 2004 in the form of a forum designed by [[Ste Curran]], then Editor at Large at games magazine ''[[Edge (games magazine)|Edge]]'', and ex-journalist [[Simon Byron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Silverman |first=Craig |authorlink=Craig Silverman |title=Regret the Error |year=2007 |publisher= [[Sterling Publishing]]| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nPWuVkgl-S0C&amp;pg=PA138&amp;dq=toothing |isbn=1-4027-5153-2 |page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tooth/&gt; Toothing was conceived as a merger of the two concepts [[Dogging (sexual slang)|dogging]] with [[bluejacking]], both of which were frequently mentioned in the UK media around that time. Byron said he and Curran were "idly messaging about the [[Stan Collymore]] dogging scandal, and how this stupid sexual buzzword had (apparently) come from nowhere," when they came up with the concept. "We wondered if we could create our own. We wonder a lot of things, and rarely push them past concept, because we’re as collectively creative as we are frustratingly idle. This particularly concept was simple enough to outstrip the temptations of grinning, saying 'Yeah!', and wandering off to see what was on [television]."&lt;ref name="triforce"/&gt; Several newspapers have also compared toothing to dogging.&lt;ref name="Haaretz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="parvaz"/&gt;

In toothing, a Bluetooth device is used to find other Bluetooth enabled devices within a close distance (on trains or buses, for example), and then send the expression "toothing?" as an initial greeting, letting the person with the enabled Bluetooth device know you are looking for sex.&lt;ref name="parvaz"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/gadgets_and_gaming/article852869.ece|title=Technobabble|last=Rowan|first=David|date=April 27, 2004 |work=[[The Times]]|accessdate=2009-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ling|first=Rich|author2=Campbell, Scott |title=The Reconstruction of Space and Time: Mobile Communication Practices|publisher=[[Transaction Publishers]]|date=October 31, 2008|page=35|isbn=978-1-4128-0809-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eCHcmsiUA4oC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;dq=%22Toothing%22+bluetooth}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mathieson|first=Rick|author2=[[American Management Association]] |title=Branding Unbound: The Future of Advertising, Sales, and the Brand Experience in the Wireless Age |publisher=AMACOM|date=August 19, 2005|page=189|isbn=978-0-8144-7287-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Z4_THbJEF0C&amp;pg=PA188&amp;dq=%22Toothing%22+bluetooth}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Peter|author2=Lewis, Barry |title=Wireless Networks For Dummies|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|date=October 2004|series=[[For Dummies]]|page=78|isbn=978-0-7645-7525-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a3_S-c8nfqsC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=Toothing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mennen|first=Andrew|title=It's Your Call: The Complete Guide to Mobile Phones |publisher=Relianz Communications |date=September 1, 2005|page=118|chapter=Security Issues|isbn=978-0-9757883-0-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fTYJey8pLbUC&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=%22Toothing%22+bluetooth}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="seattlepi"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/lifestyle/219419_poppingoff.html|title=Search for Mr./Ms. Right takes wild turns|last=Parvaz|first=D.|date=April 11, 2005|work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|accessdate=2009-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bevan|first=Rob|author2=Wright, Tim |title=Unleash Your Creativity: Secrets of Creative Genius|publisher=Infinite Ideas Limited|year=2005|page=116|isbn=978-1-904902-17-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kayBh_z-3SEC&amp;pg=PA116&amp;dq=%22Toothing%22+bluetooth}}&lt;/ref&gt; If sending of text messages via Bluetooth is not possible, the Bluetooth name of the mobile phone can be set to "toothing?" or something else to indicate interest.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/apr/02/wormseyeview|title=A worm's eye view|date=April 2, 2004 |work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=2009-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair of hoaxers wrote fake news articles on the forum about toothing and sent them off well-known Internet-based news services.

==Spread in media==

The concept of toothing quickly reached a large audience, even in countries outside of the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nyteknik.se/nyheter/it_telekom/allmant/article34479.ece?stjarna=1|title=Telefonsex - på riktigt|last=Karlberg|first=Lars|date=February 23, 2005|work=NyTeknik|language=Swedish|accessdate=2009-06-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608065308/http://www.nyteknik.se/nyheter/it_telekom/allmant/article34479.ece?stjarna=1|archivedate=June 8, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.elmundo.es/navegante/2007/05/10/tecnologia/1178789937.html|title='Toothing': ¿De bulo a posibilidad real?|date=May 12, 2007|work=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]|language=Spanish|accessdate=2009-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.infocity.go.it/vedi_articolo.php?id=4088|title=Bluetooth, un turbo anche per il marketing?|last=Pivari|first=Fabrizio|date=August 29, 2004|language=Italian|accessdate=2009-06-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722034656/http://www.infocity.go.it/vedi_articolo.php?id=4088|archivedate=July 22, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heise.de/tp/r4/artikel/19/19832/1.html|title=Toothing - die schnelle Nummer mittels Handy ist ein Hoax|last=Corinth |first=Ernst|date=April 6, 2005|work=[[Telepolis]]|language=German|accessdate=2009-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Curran and Byron said they kept a record from the start of all their mentions in the media, "but there were soon too many to record in full."&lt;ref name="Haaretz"/&gt; They agreed to do an interview with ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' and "many papers read that and followed up, broadsheet and tabloid, regional, national, all over the planet."&lt;ref name="triforce"/&gt; One of the hoaxers made an appearance on [[BBC Radio 5 Live]], and a member of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] reportedly declared his interest in toothing as a way of meeting women.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
One practitioner is Jon, a "Toother" living near London.

"One morning I received an anonymous text message via bluetooth," he told BBC News.

"I didn't understand what had happened, but that evening I did some research and worked out how to send my own."

The pair started to exchange messages on a train station platform; messages which got gradually more flirty.

"Eventually she asked me if I fancied a quickie in the toilets at the station we were travelling to.

"It happened, but I never saw her again."

Since that day Jon - who claims to have had Toothing success five times - has set up a website dedicated to the practice but he admits it takes a degree of perseverance.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[File:Uva33.JPG|thumb|200px|left|The toothing hoax has been studied by a sociologist at 
[[University of Amsterdam]] (pictured).]]
On April 4, 2005, the creators of the forum admitted that the whole thing was a hoax.&lt;ref name="triforce"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thetriforce.com/newblog/?p=53 |title=Toothing |accessdate=2009-06-24 |publisher=The Triforce }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the concept of toothing is possible, the hoaxers never intended for it to turn into something real. The couple said: "It's like going into a crowded nightclub, throwing a brick at the dance floor with a love letter attached, and hoping that the person it hits will agree to sleep with you."&lt;ref name="Haaretz"/&gt; When announcing the hoax, Curran and Byron reassured that toothing was nothing more than a practical joke gone too far and despite all the articles in newspapers and tabloids, "no one has ever ever, ever toothed."&lt;ref name="triforce"/&gt; Shanna Petersen, a sexologist, disagreed with the hoaxers' statement that no-one has ever toothed: "It's simple, doesn't take a lot of guts and rejection is nowhere as personal. Of course it's popular. Show people a new way through which they have a chance to have more sex and they'll do it. No matter how much effort goes into it or how meager the results."&lt;ref name="Haaretz"/&gt; Multiple forums were in fact created throughout Europe, Asia and America within months of the original post of toothing. People signed up to the forums looking for good locations in their area to tooth, and to share their toothing stories with other members.&lt;ref name="Haaretz"/&gt; There have later been real Bluetooth dating devices to hit the market.

[[University of Bath]] psychologist Linda Blair said the practice of toothing is down to the human need to take risks: "I think we protect ourselves too much in modern society, and risk is a human need. We need motivation. In some ways this is a tame way of picking people up, it's almost a natural follow up from randomly picking people's names out of the phone book. It's voluntary at all stages, and has choice. As long as that's there and it's legal, then people should be able to do what they want."&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; Sue Peters of the [[Terrence Higgins Trust]] worried that anonymous sex made possible by toothing would cause an increase of sexually transmitted diseases such as [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]] in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; [[University of Amsterdam]] sociologist [[Albert Benschop]] researched the hoax. He said toothing is "the next logical step" in dating and that the "old game is just adapting to new times". Benschop added that toothing is "just like picking up people in bars but without the silly time-consuming conventions of decorum that people are obliged to keep to these days. This is much more direct. You both know what you want." He also sees it as a way for people "to satisfy their need for intimacy. As long as it helps people out of loneliness and gives them more to enjoy in life, I think it's a very good development."&lt;ref name="Haaretz"/&gt;

The term "toothing" was included in the 2006 version of ''The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English''. It was described as an "anonymous casual sexual activity with any partner arranged over Bluetooth radio technology enabled mobile phones."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English|author1=Partridge, Eric |author2=Victor Dalzell |year=2006|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis Group]] |isbn=978-0-415-25938-5|page=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, toothing is listed in the ''Sex Slang'' dictionary, authored by Tom Dalzell and Terry Victor, with an explanation similar to the one in the ''New Partridge Dictionary''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dalzell|first=Tom|author2=Victor, Terry |title=Sex Slang|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2007|page=185|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ORmeNXr1J2sC&amp;pg=PA185&amp;dq=%22Toothing%22+bluetooth}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Toothing was referenced in an episode of the American television series ''[[CSI: Miami]]'', called "[[Killer Date (CSI: Miami)|Killer Date]]", that aired in the United States on April 18, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=[[Killer Date (CSI: Miami)|Killer Date]]|episodelink=|series=CSI: Miami |serieslink=CSI: Miami |credits=[[Elizabeth Devine (writer)|Devine, Elisabeth]]; [[John Haynes (screenwriter)|Haynes, John]]; [[Karen Gaviola|Gaviola, Karen]] |network=[[CBS]] |station= |airdate=April 18, 2005 |season=03 |seriesno= |number= |minutes= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vivian Morgan Carkeek''' (November 23, 1879 - December 29, 1934) was an [[United States|American]] attorney and businessman from [[Seattle, Washington]].

Born to Morgan and Emily Carkeek,&lt;ref&gt;Dorpat, Paul (August 19, 2005). "Celebrating in Style," Pacific NW Magazine, [http://www.seattletimes.com/pacific-nw-magazine/celebrating-in-style/ ''Seattle Times''] ("The Carkeeks were English immigrants, and their children, Guendolen and Vivian, kept the family's Anglo-Saxon flame lit. More than a student of the King Arthur legend, the lawyer Vivian Carkeek was a true believer, and for years the national president of the Knights of the Round Table. Guendolen was packed off to England as a teenager to go to school, although she wound up living in Paris and marrying a Russian count. Later, she returned to Seattle to help revive the historical society that her mother founded in 1911.")&lt;/ref&gt; one of the area's early pioneer families for whom [[Carkeek Park]] is named, Carkeek graduated from the [[University of Washington School of Law]]'s inaugural class in 1901 (a classmate of [[Walter B. Beals]] and [[Walter M. French]], who later married Vivian's cousin, Bessie Westlake Carkeek), and was a partner at the firm Carkeek, McDonald, Harris and Coryell.&lt;ref&gt;''American Legal News'' (1915), vol. 26, p. 38 (Washington news: "Announcement has been made of the dissolution of the law firm of Carkeek, McDonald &amp; Kapp, 1207 American Bank Building, Seattle, by the retirement of F.C. Kapp. Vivian M. Carkeek and Donald F. McDonald, with W. H. Harris, and George Coryell, Jr., have formed a new partnership known as Carkeek, McDonald, Harris &amp; Coryell, 1162-1167 Empire building.")

Carkeek was generally recognized as one of Seattle's powerful and influential civic personalities.&lt;ref name="orbis"&gt;{{cite web|title=Vivian M.

Carkeek, like his mother and [[Guendolen Plestcheeff|sister]], was passionately interested in the history of the Seattle area, and he served briefly as president of the Seattle Historic Society, which his mother had founded in 1911, and was a founding officer of the Associates of Eighty-Nine, which was established in 1919 to perpetuate remembrance of the [[Great Seattle Fire]]. In the early 1930s he financed the acquisition of theater historian J. Willis Sayre's private collection of 12,500 theatrical programs for the [[Seattle Public Library]]. Carkeek also established the "Vivian Carkeek Prize" which is annually awarded "for the best student contribution to the ''Washington Law Review'' on a point of Washington law or any point of peculiar interest to Washington attorneys".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honors &amp; Awards|url=https://www.law.washington.edu/students/academics/honors.aspx|website=School of Law|publisher=[[University of Washington]]|accessdate=December 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="orbis"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Flom|first1=Eric|title=Silent Film Stars on the Stages of Seattle|date=2009|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0786439084|pages=11–12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FRUhxhNTZngC&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Associates of Eighty-Nine Will Celebrate June 6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HYpNAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=December 23, 2016|work=Business Chronicle of the Pacific Northwest|date=May 31, 1919}}&lt;/ref&gt;
