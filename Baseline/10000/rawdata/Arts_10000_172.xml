'''''Allegory of Fortune''''', sometimes also named '''''La Fortuna''''', is an oil painting on canvas, that was created around 1658 or 1659, by the Italian baroque painter [[Salvator Rosa]], which caused uproar when first exhibited publicly and almost got the painter jailed and excommunicated. Bearing initials but undated, it measures {{convert|200.7|by|133|cm|in}}. Rosa was known for his landscape paintings, but also worked in the sphere of mythology, witchcraft, portraits, and satire.{{r|Dulwich}} Since 1978 it has been in the [[J. Paul Getty Museum]] in [[Malibu, California]].

==Background==
The painting was made at much the same time as Rosa penned ''Babilonia'', a satirical condemnation of the papal court.{{r|Sewell}}{{efn|''Babilonia'' was the term Rosa used when referring to Rome.{{sfnp|Fredericksen1991|p=543|ps=}}}} According to art critic [[Brian Sewell]], the target of the satirical painting could not be misinterpreted.{{r|Sewell}} Rosa's friends warned him after viewing it privately,{{sfnp|Fredericksen|1980|p=18|ps=}} that the painting should not be displayed openly as it was a satirical attack on [[Pope Alexander VII]]'s patronage.{{r|Grove}} In 1659, the painting was exhibited at the [[Pantheon, Rome]], which almost resulted in Rosa being jailed and [[excommunicated]]. Only the intervention of the pope's brother, Don Marco Chigi, saved him from this humiliation.{{sfnp|Fredericksen|1980|p=18|ps=}}

Eventually, Rosa was convinced of the need to offer an explanation of the picture; he did this under the rubric of ''Manifesto'' and, according to art writer [[James Elmes]], "proved that his hogs were not churchmen, his mules pretending pedants, his asses Roman nobles, and his birds and beasts of prey, the reigning despots of Italy."{{sfnp|Elmes|1825|p=92|ps=}}

An earlier painting of Fortune was undertaken by Rosa during the 1640s.{{sfnp|Roworth|1975|p=663|ps=}}

==Description==
The overall dimensions of the undated oil on canvas are {{convert|200.7|x|133|cm|in}} wide;{{r|Art Project}} the initials "SR" inscribed on the book at the lower left represent the signature of the artist.{{r|Getty}} The painting, sometimes referred to as ''La Fortuna'',{{sfnp|Viers|2008|p=86|ps=}} depicts [[Fortuna]], the goddess of fortune and personification of [[luck]], pouring her gifts on an array of undeserving animals. Traditionally Fortuna has her eyes covered and the vessel containing her favours, the horn of plenty or [[Cornucopia]], is shown in an upright position; Rosa has reversed this tradition in his rendition and portrays Fortuna completely acquainted with where and on whom she is bestowing her gifts from the upended cornucopia.{{r|Art Project}}

Gemstones, coronets, a sceptre, gold coins, pearls, roses, together with grapes, cereal, and berries flow from the cornucopia onto the animals below.{{sfnp|Roworth|1975|p=664|ps=}} In turn the animals are stamping on the symbols of education, the [[art]]s, and knowledge. The donkey, the symbol of the pope, wearing a  cardinal's red and gold coat as a drapery, is suppressing and casting a shadow on an [[owl]], used here as the symbol for [[wisdom]]. The painting is expressing the artist's feelings of bitterness about the fact he lost the papal patronage, and thus Rosa included personal references: a rose signifies Rosa's name; a [[Palette (painting)|palette]] is placed on the book, and the book carries his initials. A pig stepping on a rose also symbolizes the same thing.{{r|Art Project}}

After being displayed in 1659, the painting was acquired by Carlo de Rossi and on his death in around 1683 became the property of Antonio Vallori.{{r|Getty}}

It moved from Italy to England after Vallori sold it to [[Henry Scudamore, 3rd Duke of Beaufort]] in 1727{{sfnp|Roworth|1975|p=663|ps=}} for six hundred [[Italian scudo|scudi]].{{sfnp|Morgan|1824|p=16|ps=}} The duke was completing a [[Grand Tour]] and purchased two Rosa paintings, the other one entitled, ''Nursing of Jupiter''.{{sfnp|Nicolson|1957|p=416|ps=}} Passed down by inheritance, the Fortune painting remained in the possession of the various [[Dukes of Beaufort]] until sold by the [[Henry Somerset, 10th Duke of Beaufort|tenth duke]] in 1957, when it was purchased by [[Marlborough Fine Art|the Marlborough Gallery]]. It was acquired by [[J. Paul Getty]] from the gallery in 1971.{{r|Getty}} Until it passed to the Getty Museum in 1978 it was only exhibited three times: from 21 May 1827 at the Bristol Institution; at the [[British Institution]] in 1859; and as part of the J. Paul Getty Collection exhibition in the summer of 1972 at the [[Minneapolis Institute of Arts]]. In the twenty-first century it has been displayed as part of the ''Bandits, Wilderness and Magic'' exhibition firstly at [[Dulwich Picture Gallery]] in London during 2010 and at the [[Kimbell Art Museum]] in Texas from the end of December 2010 to March 2011.{{r|Getty}}

"'''At the Hop'''"  is a [[rock and roll]]/[[doo-wop]] song written by [[Artie Singer]], [[John Medora]], and [[David White (musician)|David White]] and originally released by [[Danny &amp; the Juniors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''At the Hop'' - Danny and the Juniors |work=Billboard |url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=danny &amp; the juniors|chart=all}} |accessdate=5 August 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090803131232/http://www.billboard.com/ |archivedate=3 August 2009 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was released in the fall of [[1957 in music|1957]], and reached number one on the [[United States|US]] charts on January 6, 1958, thus becoming one of the top-selling singles of 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= [[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|Macmillan Encyclopedia of Popular Music]] | authorlink=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|year=1998 |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]]|isbn=0-333-74134-X |page=1384 |pages= |url= }}&lt;!--|accessdate=5 August 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  "At the Hop" also hit number one on the R&amp;B Best Sellers list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942-2004|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Somewhat more surprisingly, the record reached #3 on the Music Vendor country charts. It was also a big hit elsewhere, which included the group enjoying a number 3 placing with the song on the UK charts.

The song returned to prominence after it was performed by [[rock and roll revival]] act [[Sha Na Na]] at the 1969 [[Woodstock Festival]] and featured in the 1973 [[Coming-of-age story#In film|coming-of-age]] teen comedy ''[[American Graffiti]]''. Musically, it is notable for combining several of the most popular formulas in 1950s rock'n'roll, the [[twelve-bar blues]], [[boogie-woogie]] piano, and the [[50s progression]].

==Background==
The song was written by White, Medora, and Singer in 1957, when Danny &amp; the Juniors were still called The Juvenairs. Initially called "Do the Bop", the song was heard by [[Dick Clark]], who suggested they change the band name to the Juniors and the chorus from "Let's all do the Bop" to "Let's go to the Hop". After performing the song on Clark's show ''[[American Bandstand]]'', it gained popularity and went to the top of the US charts, remaining at number one for five weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= [[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|Macmillan Encyclopedia of Popular Music]] | authorlink=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|year=1998 |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]]|isbn=0-333-74134-X |page=1384 |pages= |url= }}&lt;!--|accessdate=5 August 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The song describes the scene at a [[record hop]], particularly the dances being performed and the interaction with the [[disc jockey]] host.

A sample of the song's lyrics (contemporary popular dances in italics):

:You can rock it you can roll it
:Do the ''stomp'' and even ''[[The Stroll|stroll]]'' it
:At the hop.
:When the record starts spinnin'
:You ''[[chalypso]]'' and you ''[[The Chicken (dance)|chicken]]'' at the hop
:Do the dance sensation that is sweepin' the nation
:at the hop

== Payola involvement ==
On the 2008 nationally-televised [[PBS]] documentary ''Wages of Spin: Dick Clark, American Bandstand and the Payola Scandals'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Wages of Spin|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1189398/fullcredits#cast|work=Full cast and crew|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=September 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singer claimed that [[Dick Clark]] would not play "At the Hop" without receiving half of the publishing proceeds. Singer agreed to make the payments and called the situation "bittersweet" because although he didn't like having to give the money, he credited his success in the music industry to Clark and therefore was grateful to him. [[Payola]] was not illegal at the time and Clark sold the song prior to the 1960 payola hearings.

'''''Boy with Goose''''', is a public artwork by [[Italians|Italian]] artist [[Girolamo Piccoli]], currently in storage in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], United States.

==Description==
Cast bronze 3' 7" high x 1'8" wide x 1'1" deep
A small naked boy sits holding a pet goose in his lap. The boy holds the goose's head in his proper left hand. Water for the fountain comes from the bird's open beak. The sculpture is mounted on an irregularly shaped, tiered base and set in a planter.&lt;ref name= SIRIS&gt;[http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=1291QX7619V11.1959&amp;profile=ariall&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;view=subscriptionsummary&amp;uri=full=3100001~!335136~!68&amp;ri=2&amp;aspect=Browse&amp;menu=search&amp;ipp=20&amp;spp=20&amp;staffonly=&amp;term=Outdoor+Sculpture+--+Wisconsin+--+Milwaukee&amp;index=OBJEC&amp;uindex=&amp;aspect=Browse&amp;menu=search&amp;ri=2 SIRIS]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical information==
In 1925 Andrew A. McCabe, a local resident, commissioned the original Boy with Goose as a fountain for his home on North Lake Drive.  According to a newspaper account, the real-life model for the figure was Dominic Joseph Balistrieri, who later became a city of Milwaukee fireman who died in 1961.&lt;ref name= "Milwaukee County Parks"&gt;[Albano, Laurie Muench. Milwaukee County parks. Charleston, SC: Arcadia Pub., 2007. Print.],&lt;/ref&gt; Other citizens liked the work so much they raised $800 to have a replica cast in Bremen, Germany, and placed in Lake Park in 1927, north of the streetcar depot.  The fountain charmed visitors to the park until 1964 when vandalism to the base caused park officials to remove it and place the bronze in storage.&lt;ref name="Outdoor Sculpture in Milwaukee:  A Cultural and Historical Guidebook"&gt;[Buck, Diane M., and Virginia A. Palmer. Outdoor Sculpture in Milwaukee:  a cultural and historical guidebook. madison: State Historical Society Of Wisconsin, 1995. Print.], Outdoor Sculpture in Milwaukee:  A Cultural and Historical Guidebook&lt;/ref&gt;

===Location history===
When the Mandel Group, developers of East Point Commons, announced plans for multi-family housing to be located on nine blocks of the abandoned Park East freeway corridor, the City of Milwaukee dedicated part of the land to become a small public park to be maintained by the owners.  An art advocacy citizens' group, Art Action, saw this development as an opportunity to retrieve the Boy with Goose bronze, which had languished in county storage for many years.  Art Action coordinated the cooperation between the private sector, the city, and the county to find the work and subsequently have the bronze restored, re-patinated, and sited in its present location.&lt;ref name="Outdoor Sculpture in Milwaukee:  A Cultural and Historical Guidebook" /&gt;

==Artist==
The artist, Girolamo Piccoli, was born in Palermo, Italy in 1902. Brought to Milwaukee by his parents at the age of four, he later studied at the Wisconsin School of Art in Madison, and with [[Frank Vittor]] (1888–1968) in Pittsburgh (1921–1922), and [[Lorado Taft]] in Chicago (1923). Piccoli began teaching at the [[Layton School of Art]] in 1924 and became chair of the modeling (sculpture) department a year later.

From 1924 to 1928 the sculptor won several awards for his work from the Milwaukee Art Institute and completed many private commissions. Piccoli left Layton in 1928 for New York City, where he opened a studio with his wife, also an artist. In the 1930s he was named Director of Sculpture for New York City under the Federal Art Program of the Great Depression.&lt;ref name="Outdoor Sculpture in Milwaukee:  A Cultural and Historical Guidebook" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5510">'''Cheryl''' is a four-member, semi-anonymous, cat-masked artist collective based in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], known for its video art, museum installations, participatory events and dance parties.  Cheryl originated in July 2008 in the [[Park Slope, Brooklyn|Park Slope]] neighborhood of Brooklyn.  Since then, Cheryl has regularly produced thematic art/performance/dance events and installations in New York and in Europe.

Cheryl is best known for its thematic video work, often paired with an upcoming event of the same theme. Cheryl's work has been showcased through various installations and events with the [[Museum of Modern Art]], [[MoMA PS1]], the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]], the [[Brooklyn Museum]], [[Palazzo Strozzi]], the [[Jewish Museum (New York)]], and the [[Bruce High Quality Foundation]] among others.

Cheryl has been featured in/on ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine, ''[[The New York Observer]]'', ''[[Out (magazine)|Out]]'' magazine, ''[[V (American magazine)|V]]'', ''[[W (magazine)|W]]'', ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'', ''[[Black Book (magazine)|Black Book]]'' magazine, ''[[The Village Voice]]'', ''Flavor'' magazine (Paris), ''[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]'' (France), [[NBC]] and [[RAI]] among other outlets.

== The Cheryl blurb ==
{{quote|Cheryl is an artist collective that explores the themes of mortality, mania, the feline-human connection, the limits of shoulders, the flammability of dollar-store hair extensions, and the staining power of fake blood.  Through themes ranging from topical to bizarre, the CHERYLs revel in the joyous power of dance-induced psychosis/euphoria.  Cheryl has been bringing its particular brand of FRESHMAGICK to New York City since colonial times, and has since acquired a dedicated cult following and media attention for over-the-top happenings involving outrageous costumes, exuberant dance moves, and participatory dance floor suicide.}} 

The four elements of CHERYL are fake blood, glitter, shoulder pads, and hair extensions.

'''African cinema''' is film production in [[Africa]]. It dates back to the early 20th century, when film reels were the primary cinematic technology in use. During the colonial era, African life was shown only by the work of white, colonial, Western filmmakers, who depicted blacks in a negative fashion, as exotic "others".&lt;ref name="Hayward, Susan 2006. p. 426-442"&gt;Hayward, Susan.

The [[cinema of Egypt]] is one of the oldest in the world.

==History==
===Colonial era===
{{See also |Annees folles |Negritude}}
During the colonial era, Africa was represented exclusively by Western filmmakers. In the first decades of the twentieth century, Western filmmakers made films that depicted black Africans as "exoticized", "submissive workers" or as "savage or cannibalistic". For example, see ''Kings of the Cannibal Islands'' in 1909, ''Voodoo Vengeance'' (1913) and ''[[Congorilla]]'' (1932).&lt;ref name="Hayward, Susan 2006. p. 426-442"/&gt; Colonial era films portrayed Africa as exotic, without history or culture. Examples abound and include jungle epics based on the [[Tarzan]] character created by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] and the [[adventure film]] ''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'' (1951), and various adaptations of [[H. Rider Haggard]]'s novel ''[[King Solomon's Mines]]'' (1885).&lt;ref name="authentic"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Murphskirty, David| title=Africans Filming Africa: Questioning Theories of an Authentic African Cinema| journal=Journal of African Cultural Studies| year=2000| volume=13| issue=2| pages=239–249| doi=10.1080/713674315| jstor=1771833}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much early ethnography "focused on highlighting the differences between indigenous people and the white civilised man, thus reinforcing colonial propaganda".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cinefiliaritrovata.it/the-anti-colonial-gaze-in-ethnographic-cinema-voyage-au-congo-e-marquis-de-wavrin/ |title=The anti-colonial gaze in ethnographic cinema: “Voyage au Congo” e “Marquis de Wavrin” |date=July 1, 2018| access-date=October 18, 2018| publisher=Cinefilia ritrovata }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marc Allégret]]'s first film,''Voyage au Congo'' (1927) respectfully portrayed the [[Masa people]], in particular a young African entertaining his little brother with a baby crocodile on a string. Yet the Africans were portrayed as human but not equals; a dialogue card for example referred to the movements of a traditional dance as naive. His lover, writer [[André Gide]], accompanied Allégret and wrote a book also titled ''Voyage au Congo''. Allégret later made ''[[Zouzou (film)|Zouzou]]'', starring [[Josephine Baker]], the first major film starring a black woman. Baker had caused a sensation in the Paris arts scene by dancing in the {{ILL|Revue Nègre|fr}} clad only in a string of bananas.

Portuguese colonies came to independence with no film production facilities at all, since the colonial government there restricted film-making to colonialist propaganda, emphasizing the inferiority of indigenous populations. Therefore little thought was given until independence to developing authentic African voices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|page=234| volume=1|title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of African Thought

In the mid-1930s, the [[Bantu Educational Kinema Experiment]] was conducted in an attempt to "educate the [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]], mosstly about hygiene. Only three films from the this project survive; they are kept at the British Film Institute.&lt;ref&gt;Notcutt, L. A., and G. C. Latham, ''The African and the Cinema: An Account of the Work of the Bantu Educational Cinema Experiment during the Period March 1935 to May 1937'', London: Edinburgh House Press, 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the colonies' independence, few anti-colonial films were produced. Examples included [[Statues Also Die]] (''Les statues meurent aussi'') by [[Chris Marker]] and [[Alain Resnais]], about European theft of African art. The second part of this film was for 10 years banned in France.&lt;ref&gt;[[N. Frank Ukadike|Ukadike, Nwachukwu Frank]] (1994), ''Black African Cinema''. Berkeley: [[University of California Press]], p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;) ''[[Afrique 50]]'' by [[René Vautier]], showed anti-colonial riots in [[Côte d'Ivoire]] and in Upper Volta (now [[Burkina Faso]]).&lt;ref&gt;Melissa Thackway (2003). ''Africa Shoots Back: Alternative Perspectives in Sub-Saharan Francophone African Film''. Bloomington, Indiana: Indiana University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-253-34349-9}}, pp. 7 and 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also doing film work in Africa at this time was French ethnographic filmmaker [[Jean Rouch]], controversial with both French and African audiences. Film documentaries such as ''Jaguar'' (1955), ''[[Les Maîtres Fous|Les maitres fous]]'' (1955), ''[[Moi, un noir]]'' (1958) and ''La pyramide humaine'' (1959). Rouch's documentaries were not explicitly anti-colonial, but did challenge perceptions of colonial Africa and give a new voice to Africans.&lt;ref&gt;For more on Rouch's work, see Steven Feld (ed.), ''Cine-Ethnography'' (1994), and Paul Henley, ''The Adventure of the Real: Jean Rouch and the Craft of Ethnographic Cinema'' (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Although Rouch was accused by [[Ousmane Sembene]] and others&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Nwachukwu Frank Ukadike, ''Black African Cinema'' (1994), pp. 48–58.&lt;/ref&gt; of seeing Africans "[http://maitres-fous.net/Sembene.html as if they are insects]," Rouch was an important figure in the developing field of African film and was the first person to work with Africans, of whom many had important careers in African cinema ([[Oumarou Ganda]], [[Safi Faye]] and [[Moustapha Alassane]], and others).&lt;ref&gt;Diawara (1992). ''African Cinema'', pp. 23–24. See also Henley, Paul (2010), ''The Adventure of the Real: Jean Rouch and the Craft of Ethnographic Cinema'', Chicago: [[University of Chicago Press]], pp. 310–337.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because most films made prior to independence were egregiously racist in nature, African filmmakers of the independence era{{spaced ndash}} such as Ousmane Sembene and Oumarou Ganda, among others{{spaced ndash}} saw filmmaking as an important political tool for rectifying the erroneous image of Africans put forward by Western filmmakers and for reclaiming the image of Africa for Africans.&lt;ref&gt;Thackway (2003). ''Africa Shoots Back'', pp. 1–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-independence and 1970s===
[[File:Beattie_and_GBC_puppets_%2768_%283%29.jpg|thumb|right|''The Ghana Broadcasting Puppet Show'' developed by [[Beattie Casely-Hayford]] (1968).]]
The first African film to win international recognition was [[Sembène Ousmane]]'s ''La Noire de...'' also known as ''[[Black Girl (1966 film)|Black Girl]]''. It showed the despair of an African woman who has to work as a maid in France. It won the [[Prix Jean Vigo]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2015/02/how-ousmane-sembene-invented-african-cinema.html |work= Vulture |date=November 5, 2015|title=The Story of Sembene!: How Ousmane Sembene Invented African Cinema
|author=Bilge Ebiri |access-date=October 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially a writer, Sembène had turned to cinema to reach a wider audience. He is still considered the "father of African cinema".&lt;ref&gt;Dennis McLellan, [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jun/14/local/me-sembene14 "Ousmane Sembene, 84; Sengalese hailed as 'the father of African film'" (obituary)], ''Los Angeles Times'', June 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Sembène's native [[Senegal]] continued to be the most important place of African film production for more than a decade.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

With the creation of the African film festival [[FESPACO]] in [[Burkina Faso]] in 1969, African film created its own forum. FESPACO now takes place every two years in alternation with the [[Carthago]] film festival in [[Tunisia]].

The [[Pan African Federation of Filmmakers]] (Fédération Panafricaine des Cinéastes, or FEPACI)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fepaci.org/congress1 FEPACI.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226111448/http://www.fepaci.org/congress1/ |date=2014-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was formed in 1969 to promote African film industries in terms of production, distribution and exhibition. From its inception, FEPACI was seen as a critical partner organization to the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU), now the [[African Union]]. FEPACI looks at the role of film in the politico-economic and cultural development of African states and the continent as a whole.

[[Med Hondo]]'s ''[[Soleil O]]'', shot in 1969, was immediately recognized. No less politically engaged than Sembène, he chose a more controversial filmic language to show what it means to be a stranger in France with the "wrong" skin colour.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

===1980s and 1990s===
[[Souleymane Cissé]]'s ''[[Yeelen]]'' (Mali, 1987) was the first film made by a Black African to compete at Cannes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/africa/1282690/african-filmmakers-in-cannes-2018-want-to-take-back-control-from-european-producers/ |title=In Cannes, African filmmakers are plotting to take back control from European producers | author=Nadia Neophytou |work=QuartzAfrica |date=May 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cheick Oumar Sissoko]]'s ''[[Guimba the Tyrant|Guimba]]'' (Mali, 1995) was also well received in the west. Some critics criticized the filmmakers for adapting to the [[exoticism|exotic]] tastes of western audiences.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Many films of the 1990s, including ''Quartier Mozart'' by [[Jean-Pierre Bekolo]] (Cameroon, 1992), are situated in the globalized African metropolis.

[[Nigerian cinema]] experienced a large growth in the [[Video film era|1990s]] with the increasing availability of home video cameras in Nigeria, and soon put [[Nollywood]] in the nexus for [[West Africa]]n English-language films. Nollywood produced 1844 movies in 2013 alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2015/06/24/nollywood-movie-industry/ |title=Meet 'Nollywood': The second largest movie industry in the world |author=Jake Bright |date=June 24, 2015 |access-date=October 28, 2018|publisher=Fortune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last movie theatre in [[Kinshasa]] shut down in 2004. Many of the former cinemas were converted to churches.&lt;ref name=drG&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/06/congo-cinema-religion-la-belle-at-the-movies |publisher=The Guardian |title=The death of cinema in Congo: how churches killed off cowboy films: As the country is left without a single film theatre, a new documentary explores the end of a once thriving movie culture |author=Colm McAuliffe |date=November 6, 2015|access-date=October 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 the UN refugee agency screened ''Breaking the Silence''  in [[South Kivu]] and [[Katanga Province]].

A first [[African Film Summit]] took place in [[South Africa]] in 2006. It was followed by FEPACI 9th Congress.

The [[African Movie Academy Awards]] were launched in 2004, marking the growth of local film industries like that of Nigeria as well as the development and spread of the film industry culture in sub-Saharan Africa.

==Themes==
[[File:AIRSCREEN Africa.jpg|thumb|right|An Open-Air-Cinema in [[Johannesburg]] with an [[inflatable movie screen]] (2010).]]
African cinema focuses on social and political themes rather than any commercial interests, and explores the conflicts between the traditional past and modern times. The political approach of African filmmakers is clearly evident in the [[Charte du cinéaste africain]] (Charter of the African cinéaste), which the [[Pan African Federation of Filmmakers]] (FEPACI) adopted in Algiers in 1975. The filmmakers start by recalling the [[neocolonialism|neocolonial]] condition of African societies. "The situation contemporary African societies live in is one in which they are dominated on several levels: politically, economically and culturally."{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} African filmmakers stressed their solidarity with progressive filmmakers in other parts of the world. African cinema is often seen a part of [[Third Cinema]].

Some African filmmakers, for example [[Ousmane Sembène]], try to give African history back to African people by remembering the resistance to European and Islamic domination.

The African filmmaker is often compared to the traditional [[griot]]. Like griots, filmmakers' task is to express and reflect communal experiences. Patterns of African [[oral literature]] often recur in African films. African film has also been influenced by traditions from other continents, such as [[Italian neorealism]], [[Brazil]]ian [[Cinema Novo]] and the theatre of [[Bertolt Brecht]].

==Women directors==
Senegalese ethnologist and filmmaker [[Safi Faye]] was the first African woman film director to gain international recognition.

In 1972, [[Sarah Maldoror]] shot her film ''[[Sambizanga (film)|Sambizanga]]'' about the [[Portuguese Colonial War|1961–74 war]] in [[Angola]]. Surviving African women of this war are the subject of the [[Documentary film|documentary]] ''[[Les Oubliées]]'' (The forgotten women), made by [[Anne-Laure Folly]] 20 years later.  

In 1995, [[Wanjiru Kinyanjui]] made the feature film ''The Battle of the Sacred Tree'' in Kenya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.clevelandfilm.org/films/1996/the-battle-of-the-sacred-tree |title=THE BATTLE OF THE SACRED TREE|publisher=Cleaveland International Film Festival|author=G. Cahill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, [[Manouchka Kelly Labouba]] became the first woman in the history of [[Gabon]]ese cinema to direct a fictional film. Her short film ''Le Divorce'' addresses the impact of modern and [[traditional values]] on the divorce of a young Gabonese couple.

[[Kemi Adetiba]], hitherto a [[music video]] director, made her directorial debut in 2016 with ''[[The Wedding Party (2016 film)|The Wedding Party]]''. The film, about the events involved in the celebration of an aristocratic wedding, would go on to become the most successful [[Nollywood]] film in the history of her native [[Nigeria]].

'''''Combination Platter'''''  is a 1993 drama&lt;ref name="Combination Platter Background Information"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rotten Tomatoes Summary"/&gt; film directed by Tony Chan and starring [[Jeffrey Lau]], Colleen O'Brien, and Lester Chit-Man Chan. It is the directorial debut of Tony Chan.

The film follows the story of Robert (Jeffrey Lau), a young [[illegal immigrant]], who lives in [[Flushing, Queens]], seeking to marry a U.S. citizen so he can stay in the country legally.&lt;ref name="tv guide review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LA review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Letterboxd Overview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wp review"/&gt;

==Plot==
The film details the difficulties faced by young [[undocumented immigrant]] Robert (Jeffrey Lau), working at a low-paying job at a Szechuan restaurant in Flushing, [[Flushing, Queens]], New York.&lt;ref name="Rotten Tomatoes Summary"/&gt; Robert wants to obtain U.S. citizenship and is told that this is possible if he marries an American woman (which is played by O'Brien).&lt;ref name="LA review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Letterboxd Overview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wp review"/&gt; He initially frets the idea, but decides to Americanize himself in the shortest time possible.&lt;ref name="Rotten Tomatoes Summary"/&gt; The character, in addition, sends money to his parents, along with letters which show a false positivity of his life in America.&lt;ref name="tv guide review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LA review"/&gt; One waiter, Sam (Lester "Chit Man" Chan) receives major debts which causes him to pocketing communal tips.&lt;ref name="tv guide review"/&gt; Robert is impressed by a pair of regulars, a young white man, and his Asian- American girlfriend.&lt;ref name="tv guide review"/&gt;

His boss (Thomas K. Suing) thinks business is too slow to create tax penalties for sponsoring Robert,&lt;ref name="LA review"/&gt; and if he were to do so, it would take Robert about five years to get his card. He also wants to bring his parents to America.&lt;ref name="LA review"/&gt; A classy woman offers from $25, 000 to $50, 000 to marry Robert for convenience.&lt;ref name="LA review"/&gt; Later, he lets his street-smart friend Andy sets him up with a shy, lonely white woman (Colleen O' Brien).&lt;ref name="tv guide review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LA review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wp review"/&gt; They're relationship is inconclusive; they have hardly anything in common and not much to say to each other.&lt;ref name="tv guide review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wp review"/&gt; They end up breaking up with her because he admits he is using her.&lt;ref name="tv guide review"/&gt; Things get bad at work. Robert affronts Sam about his theft and gets him fired.&lt;ref name="tv guide review"/&gt; Later on, the [[Department of Immigration and Citizenship|Department of Immigration]] raids the restaurant, with Robert closely hiding in the walk-in freezer.&lt;ref name="tv guide review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wp review"/&gt; He returns to work with the plight still undecided and watches as the young white man proposes to his girlfriend.&lt;ref name="tv guide review"/&gt;

==Critical reception==
{{Album ratings
| rev1 = ''[[TV Guide]]''
| rev1Score = {{Rating|3|5}}&lt;ref name="tv guide review"/&gt;
}}

Reviews for ''Combination Platter'' have been mild. Praise has been given to film's plot. Kevin Thomas of ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote "Chan, whose parents own the actual restaurant in the film, is able to break through the monolithic view whites so often have of Chinese people.&lt;ref name="LA review"/&gt;" Meanwhile, ''[[TV Guide]]'' wrote a similar comment, {{quote|"Chan's film confronts racial stereotyping by telling the stories of those too often excluded from the table of mass culture.&lt;ref name="tv guide review"/&gt;"}} ''TV Guide'' also wrote, "''Combination Platter'' presents some New York neighborhoods rarely shown in films or on TV and Chan utilizes his limited locations with aplomb."

Praise was especially given to the characters of the film. David Mills of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' said, "Colleen O'Brien is touching as a shy white woman who goes out with Robert, unaware of his need for a marriage of convenience.&lt;ref name="wp review"/&gt;" He also commented, "Chan surrounds Robert with an interesting mix of characters... street-smart buddy Andy, who is helping him find a wife, seems especially hip when he's speaking in New Yawk-inflected English. Lester "Chit-Man" Chan brings scowling authenticity to the part of Sam, the grumpy waiter who likes to insult his American customers in Chinese, right in front of their faces." ''TV Guide'' also wrote positively of Sam, "Lester "Chit Man" Chan's foul-tempered Sam is much more fun.&lt;ref name="tv guide review"/&gt;

In addition, the film was exalted for its reflection of conflicts of the community. ''TV Guide'' wrote, {{quote|"The restaurant reflects the conflicts of the community: white vs. Asian; "ABC"s vs. immigrants; Hong Kong vs. Taiwan; and Mandarin-speaking vs. Cantonese-speaking.&lt;ref name="tv guide review"/&gt;"}} David Mills of ''The Washington Post'' wrote, "The multilingual dialogue in ''Combination Platter'' (with occasional English subtitles)... examines ... cultural conflicts among the Chinese—between immigrants and "ABCs" (American-born Chinese), between those who speak Cantonese and those who speak Mandarin.&lt;ref name="wp review"/&gt;" Kevin Thomas of ''Los Angeles Times'' wrote, "within the restaurant's staff there is a language barrier&lt;ref name="LA review"/&gt; between those Chinese who speak only Cantonese and those who speak only Mandarin. Then there's the owner's... American-born niece Jennie (Ellen Synn), the restaurant's cashier, who knows neither dialect--and eats Chinese food with a fork instead of chopsticks." In addition, he wrote of the conflict, "Jennie's unfamiliarity with her ancestral language puts her in a situation&lt;ref name="LA review"/&gt; similar to that of the restaurant's only white employee (Colin Mitchell), who's razzed by his friends for working in a Chinese restaurant in the first place."

==Trivia==
The film is shot in the restaurant Szechuan Inn, which is owned by Chan's parents.&lt;ref name="tv guide review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LA review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wp review"/&gt;

'''''Elder Michaux''''' was a religious TV show on the [[DuMont Television Network]], hosted by evangelist [[Lightfoot Solomon Michaux]] (1885–1969).

==Broadcast history==
The show was 30 minutes long, originated as a local program on DuMont station [[WTTG]] in [[Washington, D. C.]] in 1947, and aired on the DuMont network from October 17, 1948 to January 9, 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |title=Appendix One: Programs (A-L) |publisher=Dumont Television Network Historical Web Site |date= |url=http://www.dumonthistory.tv/a1.html |accessdate=2009-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216055809/http://dumonthistory.tv/a1.html |archivedate=2009-02-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the book ''The Forgotten Network'' by David Weinstein (Temple University Press, 2004), the series also continued locally on WTTG after the network run ended, running to 1951 (see page 162).

The program was among the earliest U.S. television shows with an [[African American]] host, and included religious music and preaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author =Jay Handelman | title =Despite occasional successes, television has failed to embrace diversity | publisher =Sarasota Herald Tribune | date =February 1, 2000 | url =http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-27747839_ITM | accessdate=2009-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Dürer-Hieronymus-im-Gehäus.jpg|thumb|''[[Saint Jerome in His Study (Dürer)|St. Jerome in His Study]]'' (1514), an engraving by [[Northern Renaissance]] master [[Albrecht Dürer]]]]
[[File:Engraving.jpg|thumb|Artist and engraver [[Chaim Goldberg]] at work]]

'''Engraving''' is the practice of incising a design onto a hard, usually flat surface by cutting grooves into it with a [[Burin (engraving)|burin]]. The result may be a decorated object in itself, as when silver, gold, steel, or [[Glass engraving|glass]] are engraved, or may provide an [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] printing plate, of copper or another metal, for printing images on paper as prints or illustrations; these images are also called "engravings". Engraving is one of the oldest and most important techniques in [[printmaking]]. [[Wood engraving]] is a form of [[relief printing]] and is not covered in this article.

Engraving was a historically important method of producing images on paper in artistic [[printmaking]], in [[mapmaking]], and also for commercial reproductions and illustrations for books and magazines. It has long been replaced by various [[photographic]] processes in its commercial applications and, partly because of the difficulty of learning the technique, is much less common in printmaking, where it has been largely replaced by [[etching]] and other techniques.

"Engraving" is also loosely but incorrectly used for any old black and white print; it requires a degree of expertise to distinguish engravings from prints using other techniques such as [[etching]] in particular, but also [[mezzotint]] and other techniques. Many [[old master print]]s also combine techniques on the same plate, further confusing matters.  [[Line engraving]] and [[steel engraving]] cover use for reproductive prints, illustrations in books and magazines, and similar uses, mostly in the 19th century, and often not actually using engraving.

Traditional engraving, by [[Burin (engraving)|burin]] or with the use of machines, continues to be practised by [[goldsmith]]s, glass engravers, [[Gunsmith#Gun Engraver|gunsmiths]] and others, while modern industrial techniques such as [[photoengraving]] and [[laser engraving]] have many important applications. [[Engraved gem]]s were an important art in the ancient world, revived at the Renaissance, although the term traditionally covers [[relief]] as well as intaglio carvings, and is essentially a branch of sculpture rather than engraving, as drills were the usual tools.

==Terms==
[[Image:gravers.jpg|thumb|left|An assortment of hand engraving tools]]

Other terms often used for printed engravings are '''copper engraving''', '''copper-plate engraving''' or ''[[line engraving]]''. [[Steel engraving]] is the same technique, on steel or steel-faced plates, and was mostly used for banknotes, illustrations for books, magazines and reproductive prints, [[letterhead]]s and similar uses from about 1790 to the early 20th century, when the technique became less popular, except for banknotes and other forms of [[security printing]]. Especially in the past, "engraving" was often used very loosely to cover several printmaking techniques, so that many so-called engravings were in fact produced by totally different techniques, such as etching or [[mezzotint]]. "Hand engraving" is a term sometimes used for engraving objects other than printing plates, to inscribe or decorate jewellery, firearms, trophies, knives and other fine metal goods. Traditional engravings in printmaking are also "hand engraved", using just the same techniques to make the lines in the plate.

Each graver is different and has its own use. '''Engravers''' use a hardened steel tool called a burin, or graver, to cut the design into the surface, most traditionally a copper plate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://expositions.bnf.fr/bosse/grand/214.htm|title=Abraham Bosse|year=1645|publisher=Bibliothèque nationale de France|accessdate=15 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, modern hand engraving artists use burins or gravers to cut a variety of metals such as silver, nickel, steel, brass, gold, titanium, and more, in applications from weaponry to jewellery to motorcycles to found objects. Modern professional engravers can engrave with a resolution of up to 40 lines per mm in high grade work creating game scenes and scrollwork. [[Die (manufacturing)|Dies]] used in mass production of molded parts are sometimes hand engraved to add special touches or certain information such as part numbers.

In addition to hand engraving, there are engraving machines that require less human finesse and are not directly controlled by hand. They are usually used for lettering, using a [[pantograph]]ic system. There are versions for the insides of rings and also the outsides of larger pieces. Such machines are commonly used for inscriptions on rings, lockets and presentation pieces.

===Tools and gravers or burins===
Gravers come in a variety of shapes and sizes that yield different line types. The burin produces a unique and recognizable quality of line that is characterized by its steady, deliberate appearance and clean edges. The angle tint tool has a slightly curved tip that is commonly used in printmaking. Florentine liners are flat-bottomed tools with multiple lines incised into them, used to do fill work on larger areas or to create uniform shade lines that are fast to execute. Ring gravers are made with particular shapes that are used by jewelry engravers in order to cut inscriptions inside rings. Flat gravers are used for fill work on letters, as well as "wriggle" cuts on most musical instrument engraving work, remove background, or create bright cuts. Knife gravers are for line engraving and very deep cuts. Round gravers, and flat gravers with a radius, are commonly used on silver to create bright cuts (also called '''bright-cut engraving'''), as well as other hard-to-cut metals such as nickel and steel. Square or V-point gravers are typically square or elongated diamond-shaped and used for cutting straight lines. V-point can be anywhere from 60 to 130 [[Degree (angle)|degrees]], depending on purpose and effect. These gravers have very small cutting points. Other tools such as [[mezzotint]] rockers, roulets and burnishers are used for texturing effects. Burnishing tools can also be used for certain stone setting techniques.

Musical instrument engraving on American-made brass instruments flourished in the 1920s and utilizes a specialized engraving technique where a flat graver is "walked" across the surface of the instrument to make zig-zag lines and patterns. The method for "walking" the graver may also be referred to as "wriggle" or "wiggle" cuts. This technique is necessary due to the thinness of metal used to make musical instruments versus firearms or jewelry. Wriggle cuts are commonly found on silver Western jewelry and other Western metal work.

===Tool geometry===
[[File:2008-engraving.jpg|right|thumb|Stone engraving]]
Tool geometry is extremely important for accuracy in hand engraving. When sharpened for most applications, a graver has a "face", which is the top of the graver, and a "heel", which is the bottom of the graver; not all tools or application require a heel. These two surfaces meet to form a point that cuts the metal. The geometry and length of the heel helps to guide the graver smoothly as it cuts the surface of the metal. When the tool's point breaks or chips, even on a microscopic level, the graver can become hard to control and produces unexpected results. Modern innovations have brought about new types of carbide that resist chipping and breakage, which hold a very sharp point longer between resharpening than traditional metal tools.

===Tool sharpening===
Sharpening a graver or burin requires either a [[sharpening stone]] or wheel. Harder carbide and steel gravers require diamond-grade sharpening wheels; these gravers can be polished to a mirror finish using a ceramic or cast iron lap, which is essential in creating bright cuts. Several low-speed, reversible sharpening system made specifically for hand engravers are available that reduce sharpening time. Fixtures that secure the tool in place at certain angles and geometries are also available to take the guesswork from sharpening to produce accurate points. Very few master engravers exist today who rely solely on "feel" and muscle memory to sharpen tools. These master engravers typically worked for many years as an apprentice, most often learning techniques decades before modern machinery was available for hand engravers. These engravers typically trained in such countries as Italy and Belgium, where hand engraving has a rich and long heritage of masters.

===Artwork design===
Design or artwork is generally prepared in advance, although some professional and highly experienced hand engravers are able to draw out minimal outlines either on paper or directly on the metal surface just prior to engraving. The work to be engraved may be lightly scribed on the surface with a sharp point, laser marked, drawn with a fine permanent marker (removable with acetone) or pencil, transferred using various chemicals in conjunction with inkjet or laser printouts, or [[Stipple engraving|stippled]]. Engraving artists may rely on hand drawing skills, copyright-free designs and images, computer-generated artwork, or common design elements when creating artwork.

===Handpieces===
Originally, handpieces varied little in design as the common use was to push with the handle placed firmly in the center of the palm. With modern pneumatic engraving systems, handpieces are designed and created in a variety of shapes and power ranges. Handpieces are made using various methods and materials. Knobs may be handmade from wood, molded and engineered from plastic, or machine-made from brass, steel, or other metals. The most widely known hand engraving tool maker, GRS Tools in Kansas is an American-owned and operated company that manufacture handpieces as well as many other tools for various applications in metal engraving.

===Cutting the surface===
[[Image:Louis George Meistergraveurin 2.jpg|thumb|left|Master engraver ennobling a watch movement. Top level engravers work under a [[stereo microscope]]. ]]

The actual engraving is traditionally done by a combination of pressure and manipulating the work-piece. The traditional "hand push" process is still practiced today, but modern technology has brought various mechanically assisted engraving systems. Most pneumatic engraving systems require an air source that drives air through a hose into a handpiece, which resembles a traditional engraving handle in many cases, that powers a mechanism (usually a piston). The air is actuated by either a foot control (like a gas pedal or sewing machine) or newer palm / hand control. This mechanism replaces either the "hand push" effort or the effects of a hammer. The internal mechanisms move at speeds up to 15,000 strokes per minute, thereby greatly reducing the effort needed in traditional hand engraving. These types of pneumatic systems are used for power assistance only and do not guide or control the engraving artist. One of the major benefits of using a pneumatic system for hand engraving is the reduction of fatigue and decrease in time spent working.

Hand engraving artists today employ a combination of hand push, pneumatic, rotary, or hammer and chisel methods. Hand push is still commonly used by modern hand engraving artists who create "bulino" style work, which is highly detailed and delicate, fine work; a great majority, if not all, traditional printmakers today rely solely upon hand push methods. Pneumatic systems greatly reduce the effort required for removing large amounts of metal, such as in deep relief engraving or Western bright cut techniques.

===Finishing===
Finishing the work is often necessary when working in metal that may rust or where a colored finish is desirable, such as a firearm. A variety of spray lacquers and finishing techniques exist to seal and protect the work from exposure to the elements and time. Finishing also may include lightly sanding the surface to remove small chips of metal called "burrs" that are very sharp and unsightly. Some engravers prefer high contrast to the work or design, using black paints or inks to darken removed (and lower) areas of exposed metal. The excess paint or ink is wiped away and allowed to dry before lacquering or sealing, which may or may not be desired by the artist.

===Modern hand engraving===
[[File:Hand engraving tool.jpg|thumb|Hand Engraving Tool Example]]

Because of the high level of microscopic detail that can be achieved by a master engraver, [[counterfeit]]ing of engraved designs is well-nigh impossible, and modern [[banknote]]s are almost always engraved, as are plates for printing money, checks, bonds and other security-sensitive papers. The engraving is so fine that a normal printer cannot recreate the detail of hand engraved images, nor can it be scanned. In the [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]], more than one hand engraver will work on the same plate, making it nearly impossible for one person to duplicate all the engraving on a particular banknote or document.

The modern discipline of hand engraving, as it is called in a [[metalworking]] context, survives largely in a few specialized fields. The highest levels of the art are found on firearms and other metal weaponry, jewellery, and musical instruments.

In most commercial markets today, hand engraving has been replaced with milling using CNC engraving or [[milling machine]]s. Still, there are certain applications where use of hand engraving tools cannot be replaced.

===Machine engraving===
[[File:1847Colt Walker.jpg|thumb|1847 Colt Walker pistol with roll engraved cylinder]]
In some instances, images or designs can be transferred to metal surfaces via mechanical process. One such process is roll stamping or roller-die engraving. In this process, a hardened image die is pressed against the destination surface using extreme pressure to impart the image. In the 1800s [[pistol cylinder]]s were often decorated via this process to impart a continuous scene around its surface.

===Computer-aided machine engraving===
[[Image:Engraving on Corian.jpg|thumb|left|Computerized engraving on [[Corian]].]]
Engraving machines such as the K500 (packaging) or K6 (publication) by Hell Gravure Systems use a diamond stylus to cut cells. Each cell creates one printing dot later in the process. A K6 can have up to 18 engraving heads each cutting 8.000 cells per second to an accuracy of .1&amp;nbsp;µm and below. They are fully computer-controlled and the whole process of cylinder-making is fully automated.

It is now common place for retail stores (mostly jewellery, silverware or award stores) to have a small computer controlled engrave on site. This enables them to personalise the products they sell. Retail engraving machines tend to be focused around ease of use for the operator and the ability to do a wide variety of items including flat metal plates, jewelry of different shapes and sizes, as well as cylindrical items such as mugs and tankards. They will typically be equipped with a computer dedicated to graphic design that will enable the operator to easily design a text or picture graphic which the software will translate into digital signals telling the engraver machine what to do. Unlike industrial engravers, retail machines are smaller and only use one diamond head. This is interchangeable so the operator can use differently shaped diamonds for different finishing effects. They will typically be able to do a variety of metals and plastics. Glass and crystal engraving is possible, but the brittle nature of the material makes the process more time consuming.

Retail engravers mainly use two different processes. The first and most common 'Diamond Drag' pushes the diamond cutter through the surface of the material and then pulls to create scratches. These direction and depth are controlled by the computer input. The second is 'Spindle Cutter'. This is similar to Diamond Drag, but the engraving head is shaped in a flat V shape, with a small diamond and the base. The machine uses an electronic spindle to quickly rotate the head as it pushes it into the material, then pulls it along whilst it continues to spin. This creates a much bolder impression than diamond drag. It is used mainly for brass plaques and pet tags.

With state-of-the-art machinery it is easy to have a simple, single item complete in under ten minutes.
The engraving process with diamonds is state-of-the-art since the 1960s.

Today laser engraving machines are in development but still mechanical cutting has proven its strength in economical terms and quality. More than 4,000 engravers make approx. 8 Mio printing cylinders worldwide per year.

==History==
''For the printing process, see [[intaglio (printmaking)]]. For the Western art history of engraved prints, see [[old master print]] and [[line engraving]]''

The first evidence for humans engraving patterns is a chiselled shell, dating back between 540,000 and 430,000 years, from Trinil, in Java, Indonesia, where the first Homo erectus was discovered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/news/2014/12/worlds-oldest-engraving-discovered/ World's oldest engraving discovered], Australian Geographic, 4 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Hatched banding upon ostrich eggshells used as water containers found in South Africa in the [[Diepkloof Rock Shelter]] and dated to the [[Middle Stone Age]] around 60,000 BC are the next documented case of human engraving.&lt;ref name="Texier"&gt;Texier PJ, Porraz G, Parkington J, Rigaud JP, Poggenpoel C, Miller C, Tribolo C, Cartwright C, Coudenneau A, Klein R, Steele T, Verna C. (2010). "A Howiesons Poort tradition of engraving ostrich eggshell containers dated to 60,000 years ago at Diepkloof Rock Shelter, South Africa". ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA''. {{doi|10.1073/pnas.0913047107}} {{PMID|20194764}}&lt;/ref&gt; Engraving on bone and ivory is an important technique for the [[Art of the Upper Paleolithic]], and larger engraved [[petroglyph]]s on rocks are found from many prehistoric periods and cultures around the world.

In [[Ancient history|antiquity]], the only engraving on metal that could be carried out is the shallow grooves found in some jewellery after the beginning of the 1st Millennium B.C. The majority of so-called engraved designs on ancient gold rings or other items were produced by [[chasing (metalworking)|chasing]] or sometimes a combination of [[lost-wax casting]] and chasing. [[Engraved gem]] is a term for any carved or engraved semi-precious stone; this was an important small-scale art form in the ancient world, and remained popular until the 19th century.
[[File:Battle of Engravers by George Cruikshank 1828.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''Battle of Engravers'', [[satire|satirical]] [[etching]] by [[George Cruikshank]], showing hypothetical battle between the engravers, including [[William Hogarth]], [[Antoine Masson]], [[William Woollett]], [[Jean-Joseph Balechou]], [[Albrecht Dürer]] and [[Marcantonio Raimondi]].]]
However the use of [[glass engraving]], usually using a wheel, to cut decorative scenes or figures into glass vessels, in imitation of [[hardstone carving]]s, appears as early as the first century AD,&lt;ref name="Caron"&gt;Caron, B., A Roman Figure-Engraved Glass Bowl. Metropolitan Museum Journal, 1993. 28: p. 47–55.&lt;/ref&gt; continuing into the fourth century CE at urban centers such as Cologne and Rome,&lt;ref name="Fleming"&gt;Fleming, S.J., Roman Glass; reflections on cultural change. 1999, Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology.&lt;/ref&gt; and appears to have ceased sometime in the fifth century. Decoration was first based on Greek mythology, before hunting and circus scenes became popular, as well as imagery drawn from the Old and New Testament.&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt; It appears to have been used to mimic the appearance of precious metal wares during the same period, including the application of gold leaf, and could be cut free-hand or with lathes. As many as twenty separate stylistic workshops have been identified, and it seems likely that the engraver and vessel producer were separate craftsmen.&lt;ref name="Caron" /&gt;

In the European Middle Ages goldsmiths used engraving to decorate and inscribe metalwork. It is thought that they began to print impressions of their designs to record them. From this grew the engraving of copper printing plates to produce artistic images on paper, known as [[old master print]]s, in Germany in the 1430s. Italy soon followed. Many early engravers came from a goldsmithing background. The first and greatest period of the engraving was from about 1470 to 1530, with such masters as [[Martin Schongauer]], [[Albrecht Dürer]], and [[Lucas van Leiden]].

[[File:Rembrandt - self portrait etching.jpg|thumb|right|Modern impression of Rembrandt's 1639 self-portrait, with the engraving plate.]]
Thereafter engraving tended to lose ground to [[etching]], which was a much easier technique for the artist to learn. But many prints combined the two techniques: although [[Rembrandt]]'s prints are generally all called etchings for convenience, many of them have some burin or drypoint work, and some have nothing else. By the nineteenth century, most engraving was for commercial illustration.

Before the advent of photography, engraving was used to reproduce other forms of art, for example paintings. Engravings continued to be common in newspapers and many books into the early 20th century, as they were cheaper to use in printing than photographic images.

Many classic postage stamps were engraved, although the practice is now mostly confined to particular countries, or used when a more "elegant" design is desired and a limited color range is acceptable.

[[File:Buffalo nickles.jpg|thumb|right|[[Buffalo nickel]]s, coins customised with engraving tools]] 
Modifying the [[relief]] designs on coins is a craft dating back to the 18th century and today modified coins are known colloquially as [[hobo nickel]]s. In the United States, especially during the [[Great Depression]], coin engraving on the large-faced [[Buffalo nickel|Indian Head nickel]] became a way to help make ends meet. The craft continues today, and with modern equipment often produces stunning miniuture sculptural artworks and floral scrollwork.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisiscolossal.com/2016/10/shaun-hughes-engraving/ Elaborate Floral Scrollwork Engraved on Coins] by Shaun Hughes embellishing existing coin faces with different styles of floral scrollwork (2016).  Retrieved May 27 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

During the mid-20th century, a renaissance in hand-engraving began to take place. With the inventions of pneumatic hand-engraving systems that aided hand-engravers, the art and techniques of hand-engraving became more accessible. 

===Music engraving===
{{main|Music engraving}}
The first music printed from engraved plates dates from 1446 and most printed music was produced through engraving from roughly 1700–1860. From 1860–1990 most printed music was produced through a combination of engraved master plates reproduced through offset lithography.

The first comprehensive account is given by Mme Delusse in her article "Gravure en lettres, en géographie et en musique" in [[Diderot]]'s Encyclopedia. The technique involved a five-pointed raster to score staff lines, various punches in the shapes of notes and standard musical symbols, and various burins and scorers for lines and slurs. For correction, the plate was held on a bench by callipers, hit with a dot punch on the opposite side, and burnished to remove any signs of the defective work. The process involved intensive pre-planning of the layout, and many manuscript scores with engraver's planning marks survive from the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Poole|first=H. Edmund|title=Music Printing and Publishing|year=1980|publisher=Norton|location=New York|pages=40–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1837 [[pewter]] had replaced copper as a medium, and Berthiaud gives an account with an entire chapter devoted to music (''Novel manuel complet de l'imprimeur en taille douce'', 1837). Printing from such plates required a separate inking to be carried out cold, and the printing press used less pressure. Generally, four pages of music were engraved on a single plate. Because music engraving houses trained engravers through years of apprenticeship, very little is known about the practice. Fewer than one dozen sets of tools survive in libraries and museums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gamble|first=William|title=Music Engraving and Printing: Historical and Technical Treatise|year=1923|publisher=Pitman|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1900 music engravers were established in several hundred cities in the world, but the art of storing plates was usually concentrated with publishers. Extensive bombing of Leipzig in 1944, the home of most German engraving and printing firms, destroyed roughly half the world's engraved music plates.

==Applications today==
[[File:Ars moriendi (Meister E.S.), L.181.png|thumb|[[Ars moriendi]] engraving by Master ES, circa 1450]]

Examples of contemporary uses for engraving include creating text on jewellery, such as pendants or on the inside of [[engagement ring|engagement]]- and [[wedding ring]]s to include text such as the name of the partner, or adding a winner's name to a sports trophy.  Another application of modern engraving is found in the [[printing]] industry. There, every day thousands of pages are mechanically engraved onto [[rotogravure]] cylinders, typically a steel base with a copper layer of about 0.1&amp;nbsp;mm in which the image is transferred. After engraving the image is protected with an approximately 6&amp;nbsp;µm chrome layer. Using this process the image will survive for over a million copies in high speed [[printing press]]es.  Engraving machines such as GUN BOW (one of the leading engraving brands) are the best examples of hand engraving tools, although this type of machine is typically not used for fine hand engraving.
Some schools throughout the world are renowned for their teaching of engraving, like the [[École Estienne]] in Paris.

==Creating tone==
[[Image:Claude Mellan - Face of Christ - WGA14764.jpg|thumb|''Sudarium of Saint Veronica'' by [[Claude Mellan]] (1649), a famous showpiece where the image is formed by a single continuous line, starting on the tip of Christ's nose.]]

In traditional engraving, which is a purely linear medium, the impression of [[half-tone]]s was created by making many very thin parallel lines, a technique called [[hatching]]. When two sets of parallel-line ''hatchings'' intersected each other for higher density, the resulting pattern was known as ''cross-hatching''. Patterns of dots were also used in a technique called [[stippling]], first used around 1505 by [[Giulio Campagnola]]. [[Claude Mellan]] was one of many 17th-century engravers with a very well-developed technique of using parallel lines of varying thickness (known as the "swelling line") to give subtle effects of tone (as was [[Hendrick Goltzius|Goltzius]]) – see picture below. One famous example is his ''[[Veil of Veronica|Sudarium of Saint Veronica]]'' (1649), an engraving of the face of Jesus made from a single spiraling line that starts at the tip of Jesus's nose.

==Biblical references==
The earliest allusion to engraving in the Bible may be the reference to [[Judah (Biblical figure)|Judah]]'s seal ring (Ge 38:18), followed by (Ex 39.30). Engraving was commonly done with pointed tools of iron or even with diamond points. (Jer 17:1).

Each of the two onyx stones on the shoulder-pieces of the high priest’s [[ephod]] was engraved with the names of six different tribes of [[Israel]], and each of the 12 precious stones that adorned his breastpiece was engraved with the name of one of the tribes. The holy sign of dedication, the shining gold plate on the high priest's turban, was engraved with the words: "Holiness belongs to [[Adonai]]." [[Bezalel]], along with Oholiab, was qualified to do this specialized engraving work as well as to train others.—Ex 35:30–35; 28:9–12; 39:6–14, 30.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14352">The '''Erlangen program''' is a method of characterizing [[geometry|geometries]] based on [[group theory]] and [[projective geometry]]. It was published by [[Felix Klein]] in 1872 as ''Vergleichende Betrachtungen über neuere geometrische Forschungen.'' It is named after the [[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg|University Erlangen-Nürnberg]], where Klein worked.

By 1872, [[non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean geometries]] had emerged, but without a way to determine their hierarchy and relationships. Klein's method was fundamentally innovative in three ways:

:* Projective geometry was emphasized as the unifying frame for all other geometries considered by him. In particular, [[Euclidean geometry]] was more restrictive than [[affine geometry]], which in turn is more restrictive than projective geometry.

:* Klein proposed that [[group theory]], a branch of mathematics that uses algebraic methods to abstract the idea of [[symmetry]], was the most useful way of organizing geometrical knowledge; at the time it had already been introduced into the [[theory of equations]] in the form of [[Galois theory]].

:* Klein made much more explicit the idea that each geometrical language had its own, appropriate concepts, thus for example projective geometry rightly talked about [[conic section]]s, but not about [[circle]]s or [[angle]]s because those notions were not invariant under [[projective transformation]]s (something familiar in [[geometrical perspective]]). The way the multiple languages of geometry then came back together could be explained by the way [[subgroup]]s of a [[symmetry group]] related to each other.

Later, [[Élie Cartan]] generalized Klein's homogeneous model spaces to [[Cartan connection]]s on certain principal bundles, which generalized [[Riemannian geometry]].

==The problems of nineteenth century geometry==

Since [[Euclid]], geometry had meant the geometry of [[Euclidean space]] of two dimensions ([[Euclidean plane geometry|plane geometry]]) or of three dimensions ([[solid geometry]]). In the first half of the nineteenth century there had been several developments complicating the picture. Mathematical applications required geometry of [[higher dimensions|four or more dimensions]]; the close scrutiny of the foundations of the traditional Euclidean geometry had revealed the independence of the [[parallel postulate]] from the others, and [[non-Euclidean geometry]] had been born. Klein proposed an idea that all these new geometries are just special cases of the [[projective geometry]], as already developed by [[Jean-Victor Poncelet|Poncelet]], [[August Ferdinand Möbius|Möbius]], [[Arthur Cayley|Cayley]] and others. Klein also strongly suggested to mathematical ''physicists'' that even a moderate cultivation of the projective purview might bring substantial benefits to them.

With every geometry, Klein associated an underlying [[symmetry group|group of symmetries]]. The hierarchy of geometries is thus mathematically represented as a hierarchy of these [[group (mathematics)|groups]], and hierarchy of their [[invariant (mathematics)|invariants]]. For example, lengths, angles and areas are preserved with respect to the [[Euclidean geometry|Euclidean group]] of symmetries, while only the [[incidence structure]] and the [[cross-ratio]] are preserved under the most general [[projective geometry|projective transformations]]. A concept of [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]]ism, which is preserved in [[affine geometry]], is not meaningful in [[projective geometry]]. Then, by abstracting the underlying [[group (mathematics)|groups]] of symmetries from the geometries, the relationships between them can be re-established at the group level. Since the group of affine geometry is a [[subgroup]] of the group of projective geometry, any notion invariant in projective geometry is ''a priori'' meaningful in affine geometry; but not the other way round. If you add required symmetries, you have a more powerful theory but fewer concepts and theorems (which will be deeper and more general).

==Homogeneous spaces==

In other words, the "traditional spaces" are [[homogeneous space]]s; but not for a uniquely determined group. Changing the group changes the appropriate geometric language.

In today's language, the groups concerned in classical geometry are all very well known as [[Lie group]]s: the [[classical groups]]. The specific relationships are quite simply described, using technical language.

===Examples===

For example, the group of [[projective geometry]] in ''n'' real-valued dimensions is the symmetry group of ''n''-dimensional real [[projective space]] (the [[general linear group]] of degree {{nowrap|''n'' + 1}}, quotiented by [[Scalar matrix|scalar matrices]]). The [[affine group]] will be the subgroup respecting (mapping to itself, not fixing pointwise) the chosen [[hyperplane at infinity]]. This subgroup has a known structure ([[semidirect product]] of the [[general linear group]] of degree ''n'' with the subgroup of [[translation (geometry)|translation]]s). This description then tells us which properties are 'affine'. In Euclidean plane geometry terms, being a parallelogram is affine since affine transformations always take one parallelogram to another one. Being a circle is not affine since an affine shear will take a circle into an ellipse.

To explain accurately the relationship between affine and Euclidean geometry, we now need to pin down the group of Euclidean geometry within the affine group. The [[Euclidean group]] is in fact (using the previous description of the affine group) the semi-direct product of the orthogonal (rotation and reflection) group with the translations.  (See [[Klein geometry]] for more details.)

==Influence on later work==

The long-term effects of the Erlangen program can be seen all over pure mathematics (see tacit use at [[congruence (geometry)]], for example); and the idea of transformations and of synthesis using groups of [[symmetry (physics)|symmetry]] has become standard in [[physics]].

When [[topology]] is routinely described in terms of properties [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] under [[homeomorphism]], one can see the underlying idea in operation. The groups involved will be infinite-dimensional in almost all cases – and not [[Lie group]]s – but the philosophy is the same. Of course this mostly speaks to the pedagogical influence of Klein. Books such as those by [[H.S.M. Coxeter]] routinely used the Erlangen program approach to help 'place' geometries. In pedagogic terms, the program became [[transformation geometry]], a mixed blessing in the sense that it builds on stronger intuitions than the style of [[Euclid]], but is less easily converted into a [[logical system]].

In his book ''Structuralism'' (1970) [[Jean Piaget]] says, "In the eyes of contemporary structuralist mathematicians, like [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]], the Erlangen Program amounts to only a partial victory for structuralism, since they want to subordinate all mathematics, not just geometry, to the idea of [[mathematical structure|structure]]."

For a geometry and its group, an element of the group is sometimes called a [[motion (geometry)|motion]] of the geometry. For example, one can learn about the [[Poincaré half-plane model]] of [[hyperbolic geometry]] through a development based on [[hyperbolic motion]]s. Such a development enables one to methodically prove the [[ultraparallel theorem]] by successive motions.

==Abstract returns from the Erlangen program==
Quite often, it appears there are two or more distinct [[Geometry|geometries]] with [[isomorphic]] [[automorphism group]]s. There arises the question of reading the Erlangen program from the ''abstract'' group, to the geometry.

One example: [[oriented]] (i.e., [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflections]] not included) [[elliptic geometry]] (i.e., the surface of an [[n-sphere|''n''-sphere]] with opposite points identified) and [[oriented]] [[spherical geometry]] (the same [[nonEuclidean geometry|non-Euclidean geometry]], but with opposite points not identified) have [[isomorphic]] [[automorphism group]], [[Special orthogonal group|SO(''n''+1)]] for even ''n''. These may appear to be distinct. It turns out, however, that the geometries are very closely related, in a way that can be made precise.

To take another example, [[Elliptic geometry|elliptic geometries]] with different [[Radius of curvature (mathematics)|radii of curvature]] have isomorphic automorphism groups. That does not really count as a critique as all such geometries are isomorphic. General [[Riemannian geometry]] falls outside the boundaries of the program.

[[Complex numbers|Complex]], [[dual numbers|dual]] and [[split-complex number|double (aka split-complex) numbers]] appear as homogeneous spaces SL(2,'''R''')/H for the group [[SL2(R)|SL(2,'''R''')]] and its subgroups H=A, N, K &lt;ref name="raw"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kisil |first=Vladimir V. |year=2012 |title=Geometry of Möbius transformations. Elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic actions of SL(2,R) | location=London |publisher=Imperial College Press|page=xiv+192 |isbn=978-1-84816-858-9 | doi=10.1142/p835}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The group SL(2,'''R''') acts on these homogeneous spaces by [[linear fractional transformation]]s and a large portion of the respective geometries can be obtained in a uniform way from the Erlangen programme.

Some further notable examples have come up in physics.

Firstly, ''n''-dimensional [[hyperbolic geometry]], ''n''-dimensional [[de Sitter space]] and (''n''−1)-dimensional [[inversive geometry]] all have isomorphic automorphism groups,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{O}(n,1)/\mathrm{C}_2,\ &lt;/math&gt;

the [[orthochronous Lorentz group]], for {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 3}}. But these are apparently distinct geometries. Here some interesting results enter, from the physics. It has been shown that physics models in each of the three geometries are "dual" for some models.

Again, ''n''-dimensional [[anti-de Sitter space]] and (''n''−1)-dimensional [[conformal space]] with "Lorentzian" signature (in contrast with [[conformal space]] with "Euclidean" signature, which is identical to [[inversive geometry]], for three dimensions or greater) have isomorphic automorphism groups, but are distinct geometries. Once again, there are models in physics with "dualities" between both [[Geometry|spaces]]. See [[AdS/CFT]] for more details.

The covering group of SU(2,2) is isomorphic to the covering group of SO(4,2), which is the symmetry group of a 4D conformal Minkowski space and a 5D anti-de Sitter space and a complex four-dimensional [[twistor space]].

The Erlangen program can therefore still be considered fertile, in relation with dualities in physics.

In the seminal paper which introduced [[Category theory|categories]], [[Saunders Mac Lane]] and S. Eilenberg stated: "This may be regarded as a continuation of the Klein Erlanger Program, in the sense that a geometrical space with its group of transformations is generalized to a category with its algebra of mappings"&lt;ref&gt;S. Eilenberg and S. Mac Lane, ''A general theory of natural equivalences'', Trans. Amer. Math. Soc., 58:231–294, 1945. (p. 237); the point is elaborated in Jean-Pierre Marquis (2009), ''From a Geometrical Point of View: A Study of the History of Category Theory'', Springer, {{ISBN|978-1-4020-9383-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relations of the Erlangen program with work of C. [[Ehresmann]] on [[groupoids]] in geometry is considered in the article below by  Pradines.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Pradines, ''In [[Ehresmann]]'s footsteps: from group geometries to [[groupoid]] geometries'' (English summary) Geometry and topology of manifolds, 87–157, Banach Center Publ., 76, Polish Acad. Sci., Warsaw, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In mathematical logic, the Erlangen Program also served as an inspiration for [[Alfred Tarski]] in his analysis of [[Alfred Tarski#Work on logical notions|logical notions]].&lt;ref&gt;Luca Belotti, ''Tarski on Logical Notions'', Synthese, 404-413, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fontana delle Api''' (''Fountain of the Bees'') is a fountain located in the [[Piazza Barberini]] in [[Rome]] where the Via Veneto enters the piazza. It was sculpted by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] and completed in April 1644. 

''Fontana delle Api'' consists of a marble bi-valve shell with three bees of the same material resting on it. The fountain was intended to be a watering [[Watering trough|trough]] for horses. An inscription on the shell reads, "Urban VIII Pont. Max., having built a fountain for the public ornamentation of the City, also built this little fountain to be of service to private citizens. In the year 1644, XXI of his pontificate."  The "public ornamentation" referred to in the inscription is the [[Fontana del Tritone]] (''Triton Fountain''), which Bernini had completed the year before.

[[File:George Frederick Watts Found Drowned.jpg|300px|thumb|''Found Drowned'', GF Watts, c. 1850]]

'''''Found Drowned''''' is an oil painting by [[George Frederic Watts]], c. 1850, inspired by [[Thomas Hood]]'s 1844 poem ''[[The Bridge of Sighs (poem)|The Bridge of Sighs]]''.

The painting depicts the dead body of a woman washed up beneath the arch of [[Waterloo Bridge]], with her lower body still immersed in the water of the [[River Thames]]. She is presumed to have drowned after having thrown herself in the river in despair to escape the shame of being a "[[fallen woman]]". The grey industrial cityscape of the south bank of the Thames is barely visible in the background through thick [[smog]]. Dressed simply, perhaps a servant, her arms and body form the shape of a cross. She holds a locket and chain in one hand, indicating her attachment to her lover, with a single star visible as a sign of hope in the sky above.

It is one of four large [[social realist]] paintings made by Watts in 1848&amp;ndash;50, created soon after he had returned to England from an extended period in Italy.  All on melancholy themes, the others are ''[[Under the Dry Arch]]'', ''[[The Irish Famine (Watts)|The Irish Famine]]'', and ''[[Song of the Shirt]]'' (after Hood's poem ''[[The Song of the Shirt]]''; this painting is also known as '''''The Seamstress''''').

Several other artists were inspired by Hood's poem ''The Bridge of Sighs''.  Examples of similar works include [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti|Rossetti]]'s ''[[Found (Rossetti)|Found]]'' and [[Abraham Solomon]]'s ''[[Drowned! Drowned!]]''. The scene is echoed in the third painting of [[Augustus Egg]]'s 1858 series, ''[[Past and Present (paintings)|Past and Present]]''.

Watts quickly abandoned his dalliance with social realism, and returned to allegorical themes. He never sold his four social realist paintings, which were first exhibited at the [[Grosvenor Gallery]] in 1881&amp;ndash;82 and are now all held by the [[Watts Gallery]] in [[Compton, Guildford|Compton]], near [[Guildford]] in Surrey.

'''Frogner Park''' ({{lang-no|Frognerparken}}) is a [[public park]] located in the borough of [[Frogner]] in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geographic.org/streetview/view.php?place=frogner+park%2C+oslo%2C+norway |title=Frogner Park.

The manor house is located in the south of the park, and houses the [[Oslo City Museum]]. Both the park, the entire borough of Frogner as well as [[Frognerseteren]] derive their names from Frogner Manor.

Frogner Park contains, in its present centre, the well-known ''Vigeland installation'' ({{lang-no|Vigelandsanlegget}}; originally called the ''Tørtberg installation''), a permanent [[sculpture]] installation created by [[Gustav Vigeland]] between 1924 and 1943.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visitnorway.com/en/Product/?pid=45493 ''Frogner Park'' (Visitnorway.com)]&lt;/ref&gt; Although sometimes incorrectly referred to in English as the "Vigeland (Sculpture) Park," the Vigeland installation is not a separate park, but the name of the sculptures within Frogner Park.&lt;ref name="aftenposten2008"&gt;{{cite news |title= Aften spør for deg |author= Einar Solvoll |url= |newspaper=[[Aftenposten]] |date= 2008-11-14 | quote= Vigelandsparken finnes egentlig ikke!

The park of [[Frogner Manor]] was historically smaller and centered on the manor house, and was landscaped as a [[baroque]] park in the 18th century by its owner, the noted military officer [[Hans Jacob Scheel]]. It was landscaped as a [[Romanticism|romantic]] park in the 19th century by then-owner, German-born industrialist [[Benjamin Wegner]]. Large parts of the estate were sold to give room for city expansion in the 19th century, and the remaining estate was bought by Christiania municipality in 1896 and made into a public park. It was the site of the [[1914 Jubilee Exhibition]], and Vigeland's sculpture arrangement was constructed from the 1920s. In addition to the sculpture park, the manor house and a nearby [[pavilion]], the park also contains [[Frognerbadet]] (the Frogner Baths) and [[Frogner Stadium]]. The Frogner Pond is found in the centre of the park.

Frogner Park is the largest park in the city and covers 45 hectares;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fpvenner.no/frognerparken.html ''Frognerparken'' (Frogner Park's friends)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527085545/http://www.fpvenner.no/frognerparken.html |date=2010-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the sculpture installation is the world's largest sculpture park made by a single artist.

In the middle of the 18th century [[Hans Jacob Scheel]], then owner of the [[Frogner Manor]], laid out a [[baroque]] garden adjacent to his new manor house. It was expanded by the people who followed him, starting with [[Bernt Anker]] (1746–1805) who bought Frogner in 1790 and expanded the main building. [[Benjamin Wegner]] took over the property in 1836 and he transformed the garden into a romantic park around 1840. Later, most of the arable land was sold to private developers.

Around one square kilometer remained when the City of Oslo bought the property in 1896 to secure space for further urban development. The municipal government decided around 1900 to make a park for recreation and sports. Frogner Stadium was opened near the road and the area near the buildings was opened to the public in 1904. Norwegian architect [[Henrik Bull]] designed the grounds and some of the buildings erected in Frogner Park for the [[1914 Jubilee Exhibition]]. 
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.friluftsetaten.oslo.kommune.no/getfile.php/Friluftsetaten/Internett/Dokumenter/dokument/Frognerparken_brosjyre_eng_web.pdf ''Welcome to Frogner Park''  (Agency for Outdoor Recreation and Nature Management)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artemisia.no/arc/historisk/oslo/bygninger/jubileumsutst.1914.html ''Jubileumsutstillingen i Kristiania, 1914'' (Geir Tandberg Steigan)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The municipal government subsequently decided that Gustav Vigeland's fountain and all his monuments and statues should be placed in the park. The area was ready for Gustav Vigeland fountain in 1924 and the final plan was released in 1932 by the city-council. Most of the statues depict people engaging in various typically human pursuits, such as running, wrestling, dancing, hugging, holding hands and so on. However, Vigeland occasionally included some statues that are more abstract, including one statue, which shows an adult male, fighting off a horde of babies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aktivioslo.no/frognerparkens_historie.php ''History of Frogner Park'' (Aktiv I Oslo.no) ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110602132748/http://www.aktivioslo.no/frognerparkens_historie.php |date=2011-06-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The manor buildings are located in the southern part of the park. The buildings in [[Architecture of Denmark|Danish]] [[country house]] style were built in the 1750s when [[Hans Jacob Scheel]] took over the property. After [[Bernt Anker]], who was Norway's richest man, took over the estate in 1790, the buildings were further extended, and the manor house became one of the most important meeting places of Norwegian [[High society (group)|high society]]. They were rebuilt again by the industrialist [[Benjamin Wegner]], who became owner in 1836 and who moved the tower to the main building.

[[File:Frogner Hovedgård X1.JPG|thumb|[[Frogner Manor]], located in the south of Frogner Park]]

Under Wegner, some surrounding buildings were also built, the [[pavilion]] on the nearby height "Utsikten" (The View) and the [[coachman]] house at the main gate in front of the manor house. The pavilion was a wedding gift from Wegner to his wife [[Henriette Wegner|Henriette Seyler]], and was moved from [[Blaafarveværket]] in the 1830s. It is a [[Classical architecture|classical]] [[octagon]]al round [[temple]] with [[colonnade]]. The ceiling is a painted replica in miniature of the dome of the [[Pantheon, Rome]]. In front of the main buildings is also a [[sundial]] built for Wegner.

Today, the manor buildings are occupied by [[Oslo City Museum]].

Outside the manor buildings, there is also a [[café]] opened in 1918 (Frogner Park Café) and a restaurant opened in 1960 (''Herregårdskroen'', "the Manor House Restaurant").

&lt;!--[[Vigeland Sculpture Park]] links here. Be careful editing section name.--&gt;

The Vigeland installation ({{lang-no|Vigelandsanlegget}}), originally called the ''Tørtberg installation'', is located in the present centre of Frogner Park. It is the name of the arrangement of sculptures and not of an area as such, as the entire park is called Frogner Park.&lt;ref name="aftenposten2008" /&gt; The Vigeland installation in Frogner Park is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the "Vigeland Park," but this name has no official status, is not commonly used in Oslo and is considered inaccurate.&lt;ref name="aftenposten2008" /&gt; The legal name of the entire park in accordance with the Place Name Act (''stadnamnlova'')  is ''Frognerparken'' (Frogner Park).&lt;ref&gt;"Frognerparken," in Sentralt stedsnavnregister (The National Place Name Register), [[Norwegian Mapping and Cadastre Authority]]&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpture installation was, as part of Frogner Park, protected under the Heritage Act on 13 February 2009 under the name ''Frogner Park and the Vigeland installation'' ({{lang-no|Frognerparken og Vigelandsanlegget}}).&lt;ref name="kulturminnesok" /&gt;

The sculpture area in Frogner Park covers 80 acres (320,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and features 212 bronze and granite sculptures, all designed by [[Gustav Vigeland]]. The Bridge was the first part to be opened to the public, in 1940. The Bridge forms a 100 metre (328&amp;nbsp;ft)-long, 15 metre (49&amp;nbsp;ft)-wide connection between the Main Gate and the Fountain, lined with 58 sculptures, including one of the park's more popular statues,  ''Angry Boy''  (''Sinnataggen''). Visitors could enjoy the sculptures while most of the park was still under construction. At the end of the bridge lies the Children’s Playground, a collection of eight bronze statues showing children at play.

Most of the statues in the park are made of [[bohus granite|Iddefjord granite]].&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite web |url=https://snl.no/iddefjordsgranitt |work=[[Store Norske Leksikon]] |accessdate=9 October 2017 |first=Bryhni |last=Inge|last2=Askheim|first2=Svein |title=Iddefjordsgranitt |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally designed to stand in [[Eidsvolls plass]] in front of the [[Parliament of Norway]], the bronze Fountain (''Fontenen'') is adorned with 60 individual bronze reliefs, and is surrounded by an 1800 square metre black and white granite mosaic.

The Vigeland installation's granite and wrought iron Main Gate also serves as the eastern entrance to Frogner Park from Kirkeveien. From there an {{convert|850|m|abbr=on}} long axis leads west through the Bridge to the Fountain and the Monolith, and ends with the Wheel of Life. The Main Gate consists of five large gates, two small pedestrian gates and two copper-roofed gate houses, both adorned with weather vanes. It was designed in 1926, redesigned in the 1930s and erected in 1942. It was financed by a Norwegian bank.

The Monolith Plateau is a platform in the north of Frogner Park made of steps that houses the Monolith totem itself. 36 figure groups reside on the elevation, representing a “circle of life” theme. Access to the Plateau is via eight wrought iron gates depicting human figures. The gates were designed between 1933 and 1937 and erected shortly after Vigeland died in 1943.

At the highest point in Frogner Park lies the park's most popular attraction, the Monolith (''Monolitten''). The name derives from the Latin word monolithus, from the Greek μονόλιθος (''monolithos''), μόνος meaning "one" or "single" and λίθος "stone", and in this case is a genuine monolith, being fabricated from one piece of solid stone. Construction of the massive monument began in 1924 when Gustav Vigeland modelled it in clay in his studio in Frogner. The design process took ten months, and it is supposed that Vigeland used sketches drafted in 1919. A model was then cast in plaster.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vigeland.museum.no/no/frognerparken/monolitten ''Monolitten'' (Vigeland-museet)]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the autumn of 1927 a block of granite weighing several hundred tons was delivered to the park from a quarry in [[Halden]]. It was erected a year later and a wooden shed was built around it to keep out the elements. Vigeland’s plaster model was erected next to it for reference. Transferring the design began in 1929 and took three masons 14 years to accomplish. The Monolith was first shown to the public at Christmas 1944, and 180,000 people crowded into the wooden shed to get a close look at the creation. The shed was demolished shortly afterwards. The Monolith towers 14.12 metres (46.32&amp;nbsp;ft) high and is composed of 121 human figures rising towards the sky.

At the end of the installation's axis there is a sundial, forged in 1930 (there is also an 1830s sundial outside the manor house in the south of the park), and finally the Wheel of Life stone sculpture, carved 1933–1934. The wheel depicts four adults, a child and a baby (the baby and child are on opposite sides).

The latest addition to the park is a statue titled ''Surprised'' (''Overrasket''). Originally completed in plaster in 1942 only months before the model, Austrian refugee [[Ruth Maier]], was sent to Auschwitz and killed, a bronze cast made in 2002 is now on permanent display.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrk.no/kultur-og-underholdning/1.529847 NRK] P2 7 August 2002 (read online 3 September 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aftenposten.no/amagasinet/article2042118.ece  Aftenposten om Ruth Maier, Norges «Anne Frank»&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vigeland.museum.no/no/frognerparken/andre-skulpturer{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}  Accessed 3 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Frognerbadet.jpg|thumb|Entrance of [[Frognerbadet]]]]

On the outskirts of Frogner Park is [[Frognerbadet]] (Frogner Baths), which opened in 1956. Old Frogner Stadium opened in 1901 and was the city's main arena for [[Ice skating|skating]]. In 1914 the current [[Frogner Stadium]] was built right next to the old stadium. At the site of the old Frogner Stadium, there are now [[tennis court]]s.

The figures are based on [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry|IFPI]] annual reports.

'''Guerrilla Zoo'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Guerrilla Zoo | work=Official Website | url=http://www.guerrillazoo.com | accessdate=17 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a contemporary arts organisation formed in 2004 by founder and creative director ''James Elphick''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=James | last=Elphick | title=Interview with Curater of Modern Panic | url=http://www.lecoollondonblog.com/guerrillas-in-the-east-james-elphick/#more-7534 | accessdate=17 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The group produce a variety of creative events from experiential environments, live concerts, [[festivals]], immersive theatre, art exhibitions, arts awards, parties and [[masquerade ball]]s.

==Early Events==
The group fronted by James Elphick curated a series of irregular [[happenings]] starting in April 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Kulture Jamming | work=Documentary Youtube | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhuZ3NyAo3c | accessdate=17 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; at ''The Corsica Studios''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Corsica Studios | work=Arts Venue | url=http://www.corsicastudios.com | accessdate=17 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; encompassing [[live art]], [[live music]] &amp; [[performance art]]. These events gain equal measures of popularity and notoriety&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=It's Guerrilla Warefare | work=The London Paper, clipping | url=http://www.guerrillazoo.com/interzone-by-the-london-paper.html | accessdate=17 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and culminated with their last event at the venue in early 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Guerrilla Zoo Oro de Ojo | work=Soundsphere Magazine | url=http://www.soundspheremag.com/blog/event-preview-guerrilla-zoo-oro-de-ojo/ | accessdate=17 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==William S. Burroughs==
On Friday 28 March 2008 at [[The Synergy Centre]] in Oval, London, Guerrilla Zoo held an event in homage to the works of cult writer [[William S. Burroughs]] which marked a changing point in the direction of its events. The popularity of the experiential event which combined all the elements of previous events but within an immersive environment set the precedent for future shows. Interzone was influenced by the strange and seedy city of ''Interzone'' described by Burroughs in his books, inspired by his time living in the north Moroccan city of Tangier during the late 1950s.

On Friday 7 February 2014 at [[Bunker 51]] in North Greenwich, London, Guerrilla Zoo returned to Interzone to celebrate Burroughs centennial with a new experimental event, with blessing from his estate. [[Dazed and Confused Magazine]] cited it as "The ultimate centenary party for the late creative rebel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=How to celebrate William Burroughs 100th birthday | url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/18793/1/how-to-celebrate-100-years-of-william-s-burroughs | accessdate=20 Feb 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For ten days over August and September 2014, Guerrilla Zoo's artistic director [[James Elphick]] and Yuri Zupancic curated an exhibition entitled 'Animals in the Wall' featuring over 50 original artworks by William S Burroughs, alongside artists such as [[Brion Gysin]], [[Shepard Fairey]], [[Cleon Peterson]] and Matt Black of [[Coldcut]], amongst others.
The exhibition was premiered in Shoreditch at Londonewcastle Project Space.

==Alejandro Jodorowsky==
In November 2009 Guerrilla Zoo celebrated the work of iconic figure&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Lennon, Manson and me: the psychedelic cinema of Alejandro Jodorowsky | work=The Guardian Newspaper | url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/nov/14/alejandro-jodorowosky-el-topo | accessdate=17 May 2013 | location=London | first=Steve | last=Rose | date=14 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the arts [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]] in a season&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Season of Jodorowsky | work=Season of Jodorowsky Overview | url=http://www.guerrillazoo.com/season-of-jodorowsky | accessdate=17 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; presenting his work through theatre, film and music at venues in London. Events such as: The première of Alejandro Jodorowsky and his wife [[Pascale Montandon]] collaborative visual art at The Horse Hospital,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Jodorowsky &amp; Montandon Exhibition |work=Interview vimeo| url=http://www.vimeo.com/32154468 | accessdate=17 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; also [[Brontis Jodorowsky]] starred in the solo production ''The Gorilla''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Gorilla Review | work=Remotegoat | url=http://www.remotegoat.co.uk/review_view.php?uid=4459 | accessdate=17 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; based on [[Franz Kafka]]'s ''Report to an Academy'' at Leicester Square Theatre, and the first Modern Panic exhibition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Panic Exhibition at The Old Abattoir | work=Spoonfed Review | url=http://www.spoonfed.co.uk/spooners/danielregan-5534/the-panic-exhibition-at-the-old-abattoir-1756/ | accessdate=17 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was held at The Old Abbatoir, plus many other Jodorowsky-related events.

==Modern Panic==
The Modern Panic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Modern Panic : Dreams and Freedoms | work=Documentary Film | url=http://vimeo.com/65934475 | accessdate=17 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; series is inspired by Alejandro Jodorowsky's [[Panic Movement]] and launched in 2009 originally as part of Season of Jodorowsky.  The now annual exhibition features provocative and controversial international artists and [[live art]]'s practitioners. It has established "a reputation for introducing new and edgy art"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=GUERRILLA ZOO – MODERN PANIC III INTERVIEW | work=Spindle Magazine | url=http://spindlemagazine.com/2012/11/guerrilla-zoo-modern-panic/ | accessdate=17 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and been cited as "livening up modern art."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Modern Panic III | work=Metro Newspaper Clipping | url=http://www.guerrillazoo.com/modern-panic-iii-by-metro.html | accessdate=17 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Habima Theatre''' ({{lang-he-n|תיאטרון הבימה}} ''Te'atron HaBima'', lit. "The Stage Theatre") is the [[List of national theatres|national theatre]] of [[Israel]] and one of the first [[Hebrew language]] theatres. It is located in [[Habima Square]] in the center of [[Tel Aviv]].

==History==
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 4058 Habima Theater.jpg|thumb|150px|Historic building, c.1950]] 
[[File:HANA ROVINA THE DYBBUK 1920.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Hanna Rovina]] as Leah in [[S. Ansky]]'s ''The Dybbuk'' (performed by Habima in the Hebrew-language translation by [[Hayyim Nahman Bialik]]).]]

Habima was founded by Nahum Zemach in [[Białystok]] (then in [[Grodno Governorate]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]])  in 1912. [[Menahem Gnessin]] was one of its cofounders and early actors.&lt;ref name="Encycl-Judaica"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0008_0_08098.html |title=Habimah |date=2007 |edition=2nd |via=Gale Virtual Reference Library database; and freely available via [[Jewish Virtual Library]] |work=[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]] |publisher=Macmillan Reference USA|place=Detroit |accessdate=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because its performances were in [[Hebrew]], invoked the Jewish folk tradition, and dealt with issues of the Jewish people, it met with persecution by the [[Czarist]] government.  Beginning in 1918, it operated under the auspices of the [[Moscow Art Theatre]], which some consider its true beginning.  It encountered difficulties under the Soviet government as well as after the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/habima-01.htm "Habima in New York: The Origin and Early History of the Habima"], Museum of Family History, accessed 6 Sep 2010&lt;/ref&gt; [[Konstantin Stanislavsky|Stanislavski]] arranged for the mainly Jewish Polish actors to be trained by [[Yevgeny Vakhtangov]]. The [[People's Commissar]] for Nationalities Affairs, [[Joseph Stalin]], also authorized the theatre's creation. However, the [[Yevsektsiya]] attempted to use its influence to cut off state funds to Habima, branding it counter-revolutionary.&lt;ref name=Shindler&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shindler|first1=Colin|title=Israel and the European Left|date=2012|publisher=Continuum|location=New York|page=33|accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926, the theatre left the [[Soviet Union]] to tour abroad, in countries including Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United States.&lt;ref name=“Ivanov”&gt;Ivanov, Vladislav (August&amp;nbsp;10, 2010). “[http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Habimah Habimah]”.

===Lodz Impact===
The theatre staff visited the city of Lodz, and the pre-war photographer and artist [[Mendel Grossman]], photographed the actors and actresses from the wings of the stage. His life was changed as a result of the visit of the theatre.&lt;ref name="SAT"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grossman|first1=Mendel |last2=Meron|first2=Peter |title=With a Camera in the Ghetto|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yb9tAAAAMAAJ&amp;source=gbs_slider_cls_metadata_9_mylibrary|year=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Establishment in Palestine===

Other members of the theatre took the company to [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate Palestine]] in 1928.&lt;ref name="commentarymagazine.com"&gt;Politzer, Heinz (August 1948).

Retrieved 2017-03-06.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1928-29 season there, the Habima Players presented two plays, both under the direction of [[Aleksei Dikiy]], from the Moscow Art Theatre.&lt;ref name="Encycl-Judaica"/&gt; The first production, ''Ha-otsar'' (The Treasure), a translation of [[Sholem Aleichem]]'s [[Yiddish]] play ''Der Oytser'', premiered on December 29, 1928.&lt;ref name="Encycl-Judaica"/&gt;  The second production, which premiered on May 23, 1929 in Tel Aviv, was ''Keter David'' (David's Crown), an adaptation by Hebrew writer [[Yitzhak Lamdan|Isaac Lamdan]]&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Henry W.

"The production of ''David's Crown'', produced in Tel Aviv in 1929, during Habima's first visit there, was a very radical adaptation of Calderón de la Barca's ''Hair of Absalom''."&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1930 the company traveled to Berlin, Germany, where it produced Shakespeare's ''Twelfth Night'', directed by [[Michael Chekhov]], and [[Karl Gutzkow]]'s ''Uriel Acosta'', under the direction of [[Alexis Granowsky|Alexander Granovski]].&lt;ref name="Encycl-Judaica"/&gt; 

The company finally settled in Palestine in 1931.&lt;ref name="Encycl-Judaica"/&gt; In 1945, it built a theatre in Tel Aviv, which it occupied before completion.&lt;ref name="commentarymagazine.com"/&gt;

===National Theatre of Israel===
Habima has been officially considered the national theatre of Israel since 1958, the year in which it received the [[Israel Prize]] for theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cms.education.gov.il/EducationCMS/Units/PrasIsrael/Tashyag/Tashkab_Tashyag_Rikuz.htm?DictionaryKey=Tashyah |title=Israel Prize recipients in 1958 (in Hebrew) |publisher=Israel Prize Official Site |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5mqejxurH?url=http://cms.education.gov.il/EducationCMS/Units/PrasIsrael/Tashyag/Tashkab_Tashyag_Rikuz.htm?DictionaryKey=Tashyah |archivedate=January 17, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the first year in which the Prize was awarded to an organization. In the 21st century, Habima employs 80 actors, and another 120 staff members work at the complex.

'''''Heaven Can Wait''''' is a 1978 American [[Fantasy film|fantasy]]-[[comedy film]] co-directed by [[Warren Beatty]] and [[Buck Henry]] which opens with the central story line of Joe Pendleton (played by [[Warren Beatty]]) being mistakenly taken to heaven by his guardian angel, and the resulting complications of how this mistake can be un-done (given that Joe Pendleton's body is no longer available) providing the basis of the film's plot.  It was the second [[film adaptation]] of [[Harry Segall]]'s play of the same name, being preceded by ''[[Here Comes Mr. Jordan]]'' (1941).

The film was nominated for nine [[Academy Awards]]. The cast reunites Beatty with [[Julie Christie]] and [[Jack Warden]], who also starred together in ''[[McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller]]'' (1971) and ''[[Shampoo (film)|Shampoo]]'' (1975), respectively.

In 2001, a third film adaptation of the play was done, titled ''[[Down to Earth (2001 film)|Down to Earth]]'', sharing its name with the sequel to 1941's &lt;i&gt;Here Comes Mr. Jordan&lt;/i&gt;.

==Plot==
Joe Pendleton, a backup quarterback for the [[American football]] team [[Los Angeles Rams]], is looking forward to leading his team to the [[Super Bowl]]. While riding his bicycle through the older west side of tunnel one on Kanan-Dume road in Malibu,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Kanan-Dume road, Malibu, Santa Monica Mountains|url = http://socalregion.com/highways/scenic_drives/scenic-drives-kanan-dume-road/|website = Southern California Regional Rocks and Roads - Celebrating 20 years online!|accessdate = 2016-01-06|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; an over-anxious guardian angel (known only as The Escort) on his first assignment sees Joe heading into the tunnel, and a large truck heading into the other end of the tunnel towards Joe and his bicycle. The Escort plucks Joe out of his body early, in the mistaken belief that Joe was about to be killed. Pendleton immediately arrives in the afterlife.

Once there, he refuses to believe that his time was up and, upon investigation, the mysterious Mr. Jordan discovers that he is right: he was not destined to die until much later (10:17 am on March 20, 2025, to be exact). Unfortunately, his body has already been cremated, so a new body must be found. After rejecting several possibilities of men who are about to die, Joe is finally persuaded to accept the body of a millionaire industrialist. Leo Farnsworth has just been drugged and drowned in his bathtub by his cheating gold digger wife Julia Farnsworth and her lover, Farnsworth's personal secretary, Tony Abbott.

Julia and Tony are naturally confused when Leo reappears, alive and well. Leo buys the Los Angeles Rams to lead them to the [[Super Bowl]] as their quarterback. To succeed, he must first convince, and then secure the aid of, long-time friend and trainer Max Corkle to get his new body in shape. At the same time, he falls in love with an environmental activist, Betty Logan, who disapproves of the original Farnsworth's policies and actions.

With the Rams about to play in the Super Bowl, the characters all face a crisis. Mr. Jordan informs Farnsworth that he must give up this body as well. Farnsworth resists, but hints to Betty that she might someday meet someone else and should think of him. Julia and Abbott continue their murderous plans, and Abbott shoots Farnsworth dead. The Rams are forced to start another quarterback, Tom Jarrett, in the climactic game. A detective, Lieutenant Krim, interrogates the suspects while they watch the game on television. With the help of Corkle, he gets Julia and Abbott to incriminate each other.

After a brutal hit on the field, Jarrett is himself killed. With Mr. Jordan's help, Joe then occupies his final body. He is shown snapping to life in Jarrett's body, then leading the Rams to victory. During the team's post-game celebration, Mr. Jordan seemingly removes Joe's memory of his past life and departs. Joe becomes Tom Jarrett and the cosmic balance is restored. The one left crestfallen is Corkle, who realizes that Jarrett living without any memory of being "Joe", is really the death of Joe in a way. Jarrett bumps into Betty while leaving the stadium. They strike up a conversation, and Betty appears to recognize something of Joe in this stranger Jarrett.  This is just as earlier in the film Joe had asked Betty to watch for and recognize in a stranger she might meet one day, implying something of Joe still exists even without his memory.

{{Div col end}}
A number of former Los Angeles Rams players have cameo roles in the film, including [[Deacon Jones]], [[Les Josephson]], [[Jack Snow (American football)|Jack Snow]], [[Jim Boeke]] and [[Charley Cowan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/C/CowaCh00.htm |title=Charley Cowan NFL &amp; AFL Football Statistics |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |date=1938-06-19 |accessdate=2010-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the former players, some well-known sportscasters also appear, playing familiar roles. [[Bryant Gumbel]] is seen in the background of one scene on TV, delivering a sportscast. [[Curt Gowdy]] and [[Al DeRogatis]] can be heard doing the Super Bowl play-by-play commentary. [[Dick Enberg]] conducts an abortive post-game interview of Joe Pendleton/Tom Jarrett.

Beatty lobbied hard for [[Cary Grant]] to accept the role of Mr. Jordan, going so far as to have Grant's ex-wife, Dyan Cannon, who stars as Julia Farnsworth, urge him to take the part. Although Grant was tempted, he ultimately decided not to end his retirement from filmmaking.

Future game-show host [[Peter Tomarken]] appears as a reporter in the film.

==Production==
Beatty initially wanted [[Muhammad Ali]] to play the central character, but because of Ali's continued commitment to boxing, Beatty changed the character from a boxer to an American football player and played it himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=//www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGD9ZvZkdYs |title=YouTube |website=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2010-12-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150712044054/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGD9ZvZkdYs |archivedate=July 12, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The type of instrument he played was also changed; in ''Here Comes Mr. Jordan'', Pendelton essays "[[The Last Rose of Summer]]" on the alto saxophone, while in the 1978 film he plays "[[Ciribiribin]]" on a soprano sax. The music during the comic training scene with Joe and the servants at the Farnsworth mansion as well as the later training session with the Rams is Handel's Sonata No. 3 in F Major, performed by Paul Brodie (sopranino saxophone) and Antonin Kubalek (piano). The main theme is the song "Heaven Can Wait" performed by [[Dave Grusin]] and the [[London Symphony Orchestra]]. [[Neil Diamond]] composed a song entitled "Heaven Can Wait" specifically for the film that he thought would be a good theme song, but Beatty declined to use it. The [[Paul McCartney and Wings]] song "Did We Meet Somewhere Before?" was also considered for as a theme song for the film, but was eventually ruled out. It later appeared in the [[Ramones]] film ''Rock and Roll High School'' (1979).

The Super Bowl game (Pittsburgh Steelers vs. the Rams) was filmed during halftime of the San Diego Chargers vs Los Angeles Rams  preseason game at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]] on September 1, 1977. (About a year and a half after the film's release, in January 1980, the Rams and Steelers would meet in real life in [[Super Bowl XIV]].)

==Reception==
===Critical response===
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 89% based on 36 reviews, with an average rating of 7.7/10. The site’s critical consensus reads, "A throwback to the high-gloss screwball comedies of the 1940s, ''Heaven Can Wait'' beguiles with seamless production values and great comic relief from Charles Grodin and Dyan Cannon."&lt;ref name="RT"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1009427-heaven_can_wait/#contentReviews|title=Heaven Can Wait (1978)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=January 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]] gave the film a weighted average score of 72 out of 100 based on 10 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/heaven-can-wait|title=Heaven Can Wait reviews|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=January 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Leaf Theater was built in 1949 and named for the economic impact of [[Cultivation of tobacco#Sowing and growth|shade tobacco]] on the community.&lt;ref name="Hunt2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hunt|first=Bruce|title=Visiting Small-Town Florida|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bfunmsOv5yYC|accessdate=4 May 2014|year=2011|publisher=Pineapple Press Inc|isbn=9781561644889}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally a movie theater, the grand opening was hosted by [[Roy Rogers]]. &lt;ref name="Forsher2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Forsher|first=James|title=The Community of Cinema: How Cinema and Spectacle Transformed the American Downtown|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1ONsSIij2G0C|accessdate=4 May 2014|year=2003|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780275973551}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building had air conditioning, a cry room, and a separate entrance for blacks before [[desegregation]] took effect. &lt;ref name="Forsher2003"/&gt;  In 1980, the Leaf closed due to competition from [[Multiplex (movie theater)|multiplex]]es.&lt;ref name="Forsher2003"/&gt;

'''Lilith Fair''' was a [[concert tour]] and travelling [[music festival]], founded by Canadian musician [[Sarah McLachlan]], [[Nettwerk Music Group]]'s [[Dan Fraser]] and [[Terry McBride (CEO)|Terry McBride]], and New York talent agent Marty Diamond. It took place during the summers of 1997 to 1999, and was revived in the summer of 2010. It consisted solely of female solo artists and female-led bands. In its initial three years, Lilith Fair raised over $10M for charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128588089 |title=With Sales Lagging, Lilith Fair Faces Question Of Relevance |last=Pellegrinelli |first=Lara |date=19 July 2010 |website=NPR |access-date=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1996, Canadian [[Sarah McLachlan]] became frustrated with concert promoters and radio stations that refused to feature two female musicians in a row.&lt;ref name="cnn072898"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Music/9807/28/lilith.fair/ | title=Lilith Fair: Lovely, lively and long overdue | author=Donna Freydkin | publisher=CNN | date=1998-07-28 | accessdate=2008-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bucking conventional industry wisdom, she booked a successful tour for herself and [[Paula Cole]]. At least one of their appearances together — in McLachlan's home town, on September 14, 1996 — went by the name "Lilith Fair" and included performances by McLachlan, Cole, [[Lisa Loeb]] and [[Michelle McAdorey]], formerly of [[Crash Vegas]].

The next year, McLachlan founded the Lilith Fair tour, taking ''Lilith'' from the biblical Jewish lore that [[Lilith]] was [[Adam and Eve|Adam]]'s first wife.

In 1997, Lilith Fair garnered a $16 million gross, making it the top-grossing of any touring festival.&lt;ref name="cnn072898"/&gt;  Among all concert tours for that year, it was the 16th highest grossing.&lt;ref name="cnn072898"/&gt;

In 2010, Lilith Fair staged a revival with mixed results, as several dates were canceled and many performers backed out of scheduled performances.

In March 2011, co-founder Sarah McLachlan declared that the Lilith concept was no longer being considered for future shows, due to changing audience views and expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/music/sarah-mclachlan-says-lilith-fair-is-over/article1932922/ | title=Sarah McLachlan says Lilith Fair is over | author=MARSHA LEDERMAN | publisher=Toronto Globe and Mail | date=2011-03-08 | accessdate=2011-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performers==

===1997===
The artists appearing at Lilith Fair varied by date (with McLachlan and Suzanne Vega the only artists to play all dates). Appearances were organized into three stages. Almost all Village Stage artists performed only one or two dates. Many of them won slots on the bill in a series of local talent searches in their home cities.

==2010 revival==
In an April 25, 2009, Twitter post, Nettwerk founder Terry McBride announced that a Lilith Fair tour through North America would be relaunched for the summer of  2010, with a two-week tour of Europe to follow.

The tour was plagued with financial problems from the beginning. The first seven shows were sparsely attended and the eighth show was the first to be cancelled. Initially Sarah McLachlan claimed (in an interview posted on the ''[[Arizona Republic]]'' website on July 9) that the July 8 Phoenix show was canceled in protest of [[Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act|Arizona Senate Bill 1070]], which she strongly opposes.&lt;ref name="azc070910"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.azcentral.com/thingstodo/music/articles/2010/07/09/20100709sarah-mclachlan-lilith-fair-arizona-immigration-protest-cancel.html | title=Sarah McLachlan: Lilith Fair was a protest cancellation | author=Ed Masley | publisher=[[azcentral.com|The Arizona Republic]] | date=2010-07-09 | accessdate=2010-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tour fell apart on the road as headliners [[Carly Simon]], [[Norah Jones]], [[Kelly Clarkson]], [[The Go-Go's]], and [[Queen Latifah]] dropped out of the tour, fearing that they would not be paid for their performances.&lt;ref name="Artists"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lilithfair.com/artists/index.html |title=Artists |publisher=Lilith Fair |year=1999 |accessdate=2010-07-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090330035003/http://lilithfair.com/artists/index.html |archivedate=March 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to poor ticket sales, 13 shows (about one-third of the tour) were scratched (two announced on June 25,&lt;ref name="2010-06-25_news"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hudson |first=Alex |url=http://www.exclaim.ca/articles/generalarticlesynopsfullart.aspx?csid1=115&amp;csid2=844&amp;fid1=47614 |title=Lilith Fair Dates Cancelled Due to Poor Ticket Sales |publisher=Exclaim.ca |date=2010-06-25 |accessdate=2014-05-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130115173624/http://www.exclaim.ca/articles/generalarticlesynopsfullart.aspx?csid1=115&amp;csid2=844&amp;fid1=47614 |archivedate=2013-01-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ten more on July 1,&lt;ref name="2010-07-01_news"&gt;[http://www.lilithfair.com/news/2010-lilith-tour-announcement] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704062130/http://www.lilithfair.com/news/2010-lilith-tour-announcement |date=July 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; one additional on July 2)&lt;ref name="2010-07-02_news"&gt;[http://www.lilithfair.com/news/lilith-atlanta-alert] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705151225/http://www.lilithfair.com/news/lilith-atlanta-alert |date=July 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and one reassigned to a smaller venue.

The artists appearing at Lilith Fair vary by date (with McLachlan the only artist to play all dates).&lt;ref name="Artists"/&gt;  Appearances are organized into three stages. Below is a list of artists who have performed at Lilith Fair in the 2010 revival.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="56066">There are 230 [[Space group#Table of space groups in 3 dimensions|space groups]] in three dimensions, given by a number index, and a full name in [[Hermann–Mauguin notation]], and a short name (international short symbol). The long names are given with spaces for readability. The groups each have a [[point groups]] of the unit cell.

== Symbols==
In [[Hermann–Mauguin notation]], space groups are named by a symbol combining the [[point group]] identifier with the uppercase letters describing the [[Bravais lattice#Bravais lattices in 3 dimensions|lattice type]]. Translations within the lattice in the form of [[screw axes]] and [[glide planes]] are also noted, giving a complete crystallographic space group.

These are the [[Bravais lattices]] in three dimensions:
*'''P''' primitive
*'''I''' body centered (from the German "Innenzentriert")
*'''F''' face centered (from the German "Flächenzentriert")
*'''A''' centered on A faces only
*'''B''' centered on B faces only
*'''C''' centered on C faces only
*'''R''' rhombohedral

A reflection plane '''m''' within the point groups can be replaced by a [[glide plane]], labeled as '''a''', '''b''', or '''c''' depending on which axis the glide is along. There is also the '''n''' glide, which is a glide along the half of a diagonal of '''a''' face, and the '''d''' glide, which is along a quarter of either a face or space diagonal of the unit cell. The '''d''' glide is often called the diamond glide plane as it features in the [[diamond]] structure.
*&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; glide translation along half the lattice vector of this face
*&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; glide translation along with half a face diagonal
*&lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; glide planes with translation along a quarter of a face diagonal.
*&lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; two glides with the same glide plane and translation along two (different) half-lattice vectors.

A gyration point can be replaced by a [[screw axis]] denoted by a number, ''n'', where the angle of rotation is  &lt;math&gt;\color{Black}\tfrac{360^\circ}{n}&lt;/math&gt;. The degree of translation is then added as a subscript showing how far along the axis the translation is, as a portion of the parallel lattice vector.  For example, 2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is a 180° (twofold) rotation followed by a translation of ½ of the lattice vector. 3&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is a 120° (threefold) rotation followed by a translation of ⅓ of the lattice vector.

The possible screw axes are: 2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, 3&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, 3&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 4&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, 4&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 4&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, 6&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, 6&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 6&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, 6&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and 6&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;.

In '''Schoenflies notation''', the symbol of a space group is represented by the symbol of corresponding point group with additional superscript. The superscript doesn't give any additional information about symmetry elements of the space group, but is instead related to the order in which Schoenflies derived the space groups.

In '''Fedorov symbol''', the type of space group is denoted as ''s'' (''symmorphic'' ), ''h'' (''hemisymmorphic''), or ''a'' (''asymmorphic''). The number is related to the order in which Fedorov derived space groups. There are 73 symmorphic, 54 hemisymmorphic, and 103 asymmorphic space groups. Symmorphic space groups can be obtained as combination of Bravais lattices with corresponding point group. These groups contain the same symmetry elements as the corresponding point groups. Hemisymmorphic space groups contain only axial combination of symmetry elements from the corresponding point groups. All the other space groups are asymmorphic. Example for point group 4/mmm (&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{4}{m}\tfrac{2}{m}\tfrac{2}{m}&lt;/math&gt;): the symmorphic space groups are P4/mmm (&lt;math&gt;P\tfrac{4}{m}\tfrac{2}{m}\tfrac{2}{m}&lt;/math&gt;, ''36s'') and I4/mmm (&lt;math&gt;I\tfrac{4}{m}\tfrac{2}{m}\tfrac{2}{m}&lt;/math&gt;, ''37s''); hemisymmorphic space groups should contain axial combination 422, these are P4/mcc (&lt;math&gt;P\tfrac{4}{m}\tfrac{2}{c}\tfrac{2}{c}&lt;/math&gt;, ''35h''), P4/nbm (&lt;math&gt;P\tfrac{4}{n}\tfrac{2}{b}\tfrac{2}{m}&lt;/math&gt;, ''36h''), P4/nnc (&lt;math&gt;P\tfrac{4}{n}\tfrac{2}{n}\tfrac{2}{c}&lt;/math&gt;, ''37h''), and I4/mcm (&lt;math&gt;I\tfrac{4}{m}\tfrac{2}{c}\tfrac{2}{m}&lt;/math&gt;, ''38h'').

Literary fiction has been defined as any fiction that attempts to engage with one or more truths or questions, hence relevant to a broad scope of humanity as a form of expression. There are many sources that help readers find and define literary fiction and genre fiction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.ala.org/booklist/v96/rbb/mr2/44now.html Nancy Pearl, ''Now Read This: A Guide to Mainstream Fiction''] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20120914200921/http%3A//archive.ala.org/booklist/v96/rbb/mr2/44now.html |date=2012-09-14 }}, Libraries Unlimited, 1999, 432 pp. (1-56308-659-X)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Saricks, J. (2001). ''The Readers' Advisory Guide to Genre Fiction''. Chicago and London: American Library Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

The''''' Madonna and Child with Three Angels''''' (also known as ''Madonna del Padiglione'') is a painting by the Italian Renaissance master [[Sandro Botticelli]], executed in 1493. It is housed in the [[Pinacoteca Ambrosiana]] of [[Milan]].

The Virgin Mary is portrayed holding a book to her breast and gesturing to the Child, the latter being supported by an angel. The Italian name (''[[:wiktionary|padiglione]]'' meaning "pavilion") derives from the rich baldachin over the scene. There is an open book on a small prie-dieu between the Virgin and Child. Angels are pulling back the drapery of the pavilion. Together, the books and the open drapery signify the revelation that Old Testament prophecy has been fulfilled in the birth of the Christ Child to the Virgin.

The '''Maymūnah Stone''' ({{lang-mt|il-Ġebla ta' Majmuna}} or ''il-Ħaġra ta' Majmuna'', {{lang-ar|شاهد قبر ميمونة}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bonello|first=Giovanni|author-link=Giovanni Bonello|date=2000|url=https://books.google.com.mt/books?id=-4doAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=majmuna+malta&amp;dq=majmuna+malta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjh06yvvsjKAhVGXCwKHYpqDAwQ6AEIGzAA|title=Histories of Malta|volume=1|publisher=[[Fondazzjoni Patrimonju Malti]]|isbn=9789993210016|pages=9-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a 12th-century [[marble]] [[tombstone]] (of Roman origins) which is believed to have been discovered in [[Xewkija]], [[Gozo]], [[Malta]]. According to judge and historian [[Giovanni Bonello]], the Majmuna Stone is a "spectacular visual relic of the Islamic presence in Malta." It is now exhibited in the [[Gozo Museum of Archaeology]] at the [[Cittadella (Gozo)|Cittadella]] of [[Victoria, Gozo|Victoria]], Gozo.&lt;ref name=bonello&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bonello |first1=Giovanni |authorlink1=Giovanni Bonello |title=New Light on Majmuna's Tombstone |journal=Histories of Malta : Deceptions and Perceptions |date=2000 |volume=1 |pages=9–12 |url=http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/The%20Arabs%20in%20Malta/2000proc%20New%20Light%20on%20Majmuna's%20Tombstone%20by%20G.%20Bonello.pdf |publisher=Fondazzjoni Patrimonju Malti |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717091106/http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/The%20Arabs%20in%20Malta/2000proc%20New%20Light%20on%20Majmuna%27s%20Tombstone%20by%20G.%20Bonello.pdf |archivedate=17 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The marble stone was originally used in the Roman period as its backside indicates. A relief in the form of a rose was sculpted in the Roman architectural style. It was later reused as a tombstone. It is the only [[islamic funeral|islamic funerary]] stone in Malta of its period to be still intact in its original size and the only one which gives a date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/The%20Arabs%20in%20Malta/1925saracenicremainsinmaltatzammit.pdf |title=Data |website=melitensiawth.com |format=PDF}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The Majmuna Stone is the tombstone of a girl called [[Mahmuna|Majmuna]], who died on 21 March 1174.&lt;ref&gt;[http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/The%20Arabs%20in%20Malta/2002%20Malta%20Musulmana%20by%20C.%20Dalli.pdf page 37]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a marble slab which has Roman decorations on the back (such reuse was a common occurrence in Islamic [[North Africa]]). The [[Kufic]] [[Arabic]] inscription approximately translates to:&lt;ref name=bonello/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glossary of Placenames Related to Islam, Christianity and Ethnicity|url=http://www.thinksite.eu/userfiles/Glossary%20of%20placenames%20related%20to%20Islam%20Christianity%20and%20Ethnicity.pdf|website=thinksite.eu|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117201321/http://www.thinksite.eu/userfiles/Glossary%20of%20placenames%20related%20to%20Islam%20Christianity%20and%20Ethnicity.pdf|archivedate=17 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the name of [[Allah]], the merciful and compassionate. May He be propitious to the Prophet [[Muhammad]] and to his followers and grant them eternal salvation.&lt;br&gt;
God is great and eternal and He has decreed that his creatures should perish. Of this the prophet of Allah bears witness.&lt;br&gt;
This is the tomb of Maymūnah, daughter of Hassān, son of ‘Ali al-Hudali, known as Ibn as-Susi. She died – Allah's mercy be upon her – on Thursday 16th day of the month of [[Sha'ban]] in the year 569, professing that there is only one God who has no equal.&lt;br&gt;
Look around you! Is there anything everlasting on earth; anything that repels or casts a spell on death? Death robbed me from a palace and, alas, neither doors nor bolts could save me. All I did in my lifetime remains, and shall be reckoned.&lt;br&gt;
Oh he who looks upon this tomb! I am already consumed inside it, and dust has settled on my eyes. On my couch in my abode there is nothing but tears, and what is to happen at my resurrection when I shall appear before my Creator? Oh my brother, be wise and repent.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The inscription is dated 1174, almost a century after the [[Norman invasion of Malta]] in 1091. It is believed that Islam remained the dominant religion in Malta until the Arabs were expelled in 1224.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Debattista|first1=Martin|title=Timeline of Malta History|url=http://www.aboutmalta.com/history/time-Line.htm|website=aboutmalta.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101133533/http://www.aboutmalta.com/history/time-Line.htm|archivedate=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent history==
[[File:Islamic funerary limestone Malta.jpeg|thumb|right|Other visual Islamic funerary found at the [[Domvs Romana]] in [[Rabat, Malta|Rabat]], Malta]]
The date and location of discovery of the Majmuna Stone are unknown. It is traditionally held that the stone was found in an area known as ''Ta' Majmuna'', between the Gozitan villages of [[Xewkija]] and [[Sannat]]. However, it is also possible that the stone was not found in Malta at all, and it might originate from [[Tunisia]], North Africa.&lt;ref name=bonello/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buhagiar|first=Mario|date=2007|url=https://books.google.com.mt/books?id=9CRmAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=majmuna+stone&amp;dq=majmuna+stone&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjskre1ssjKAhVBfg8KHXz0D6oQ6AEIKDAD|title=The Christianisation of Malta: catacombs, cult centres and churches in Malta to 1530|publisher=Archaeopress|isbn=9781407301099|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1772 book ''Malta illustrata ovvero descrizione di Malta isola del Mare Siciliano e Adriatico'', Count Giovannantonio Ciantar wrote about the stone and illustrated it, but he was not able to decipher its writing. Ciantar wrote that the tombstone was located in the courtyard of a private residence.&lt;ref name=bonello/&gt;

In 1799, during the [[Siege of Malta (1798–1800)|Maltese uprising against French occupation]], [[Paul I of Russia]] sent the diplomat Andrey Italinski to ensure the [[National Congress Battalions|insurgents]] that they had Russian protection. Italinski examined the stone during his stay in Malta, and was the first person who managed to decipher part of its inscription.&lt;ref name=bonello/&gt;

In an undated early 19th century scrapbook, Father Giuseppe Carmelo Gristi recorded that the stone was discovered "in Malta," and was preserved at Baron Muscat's residence in [[Valletta]]. By 1839, the stone belonged to the Xara family, and it was eventually passed down to Baron Sir Giuseppe Maria de Piro. In 1845, de Piro donated it to the [[National Library of Malta|Public Library]].&lt;ref name=bonello/&gt;&lt;ref name="susanna"&gt;{{cite book|first=Susanna|last=Hoe|title=Malta: Women, History, Books and Places|date=2015|url=http://www.holobooks.co.uk/MaltaItineraryChapter17.pdf|chapter=Valletta|page=370–371|archivedate=10 October 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161010130128/http://www.holobooks.co.uk/MaltaItineraryChapter17.pdf|location=[[Oxford]]|publisher=Women's History Press (a division of Holo Books)|oclc=931704918|isbn=9780957215351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stone has been part of the collections of the [[Gozo Museum of Archaeology]] since 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Places of Interest|url=http://www.xewkija.gov.mt/xewkija/229-places-of-interest|website=Xewkija Local Council|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117201017/http://www.xewkija.gov.mt/xewkija/229-places-of-interest|archivedate=17 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been called "the pride and joy" of the museum.&lt;ref name=bonello/&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''''Memento Mori''''' (1993) is a composition for orchestra by [[Peter Sculthorpe]]. The title refers to the medieval Christian idea of ''[[memento mori]]'', and the piece itself makes frequent references to the plainchant setting of the [[Latin]] [[hymn]] "[[Dies irae]]".&lt;ref name=faber2322&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fabermusic.com/repertoire/memento-mori-2322|title=''Memento Mori''|website=www.fabermusic.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conception ==
Laurie Strachan wrote in [[The Australian]], when reviewing the piece on October 22, 1993, that "[t]he work was inspired by a visit to [[Easter Island]], famous for its great stone [[Moai|heads]], monuments that can be seen as both an example of the indomitable nature of the human spirit and as part of its great folly - for their making and transportation deforested and impoverished the island."&lt;ref name=faber1085&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fabermusic.com/news/memento-mori-reviews-1085|title=''Memento Mori''' reviews|website=www.fabermusic.com|access-date=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; When composing, ''Memento Mori'', Sculthorpe focused on the link between 'the personal notion of morality' and the 'extended environmental sense of fragility', using 'Easter Island as a parable for planet Earth and [[Human overpopulation|population growth]]'.&lt;ref name="musicalcriticism.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.musicalcriticism.com/concerts/eif10-sso-mackerras-0910.shtml|title=The Sydney symphony Orchestra and Vladimir Ashkenazy pay tribute to Charles Mackerras at the Edinburgh Festival - MusicalCriticism.com (Concert review)|website=www.musicalcriticism.com|access-date=2018-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.limelightmagazine.com.au/features/peter-sculthorpe-the-sound-of-home/|title=Peter Sculthorpe: The Sound Of Home|work=[[Limelight (magazine)|Limelight]]|access-date=2018-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Moais, Isla de Pascua. - panoramio.jpg|thumb|242x242px|[[Moai]] at [[Rano Raraku]], Easter Island; a visit to Easter Island was where the composer gained inspiration for the composition.]]

In the original programme notes, the composer described the way he conceived of the work:
{{Quotation|It seems that on Easter Island, at the beginning of the seventeenth century, there was a population explosion. The inhabitants stripped the island of trees, causing soil erosion and depriving themselves of building materials for boats and housing. Retreating to caves, clans fought each other, and finally there was enslavement and cannibalization. By the time the first Europeans arrived, in 1722, the survivors had even forgotten the significance of the great stone heads that still stand there.&lt;p&gt; 
Easter Island is a memento mori (literally, "remember to die") for this planet. The concern of this work, therefore, is not with what happened to the inhabitants of Easter Island, but with what could happen to all of us, with what could happen to the human race.|Peter Sculthorpe|&lt;ref name=faber2322 /&gt;}}

== Reception ==
The work has received mixed reviews. Joseph McLellan, writing in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', stated that:
{{Quotation|It is a piece imbued with a religious aura, rooted in a particular landscape - barren, mysterious Easter Island, with its enormous, brooding, enigmatic statues.  And it is full of tunes, most notably the ancient plainchant Dies irae, which has been used by many classical composers but seldom with the blend of reverence and coloristic effectiveness Sculthorpe has achieved … It was marvelously effective music, innovative in sound but listener-friendly.|Joseph McLellan|&lt;ref name=faber1085 /&gt;}}Laurie Strachan, writing in The Australian, was similarly positive, writing that ''Memento Mori'' was 'one of [Sculthorpe's] most immediately appealing scores.'&lt;ref name=faber1085 /&gt; Strachan went on further to say that '[t]here are some hauntingly beautiful melodies and striking tonal contrasts. Some play is made of the plainchant ''Dies irae'' but this is not overdone and the whole thing ends on a note of quiet resolution that's absolutely right.’&lt;ref name=faber1085 /&gt;

Conversely, Andrew Clements, while reviewing a CD of Sculthorpe's work for ''[[The Guardian]]'', said that the ''Memento Mori'' was "the most conventional and least effective piece on [the] disc".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/jan/07/classicalmusicandopera.shopping|title=CD: Sculthorpe: Earth Cry; Memento Mori; Kakadu; Piano Concerto; From Oceania|last=Clements|first=Andrew|date=2005-01-07|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Instrumentation ==
The music is scored for two [[flute]]s (flute 2 doubling [[piccolo]]), two [[clarinet]]s, two [[oboe]]s, two [[bassoon]]s, four [[French horn|horns]], four [[trumpet]]s, two [[trombone]]s, [[bass trombone]], [[tuba]], [[timpani]], [[Percussion instrument|percussion]] (two players), and [[String instrument|strings]].&lt;ref name=AMC7572&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.australianmusiccentre.com.au/workversion/sculthorpe-peter-memento-mori/7572|title=''Memento Mori'' : for orchestra by Peter Sculthorpe|website=www.australianmusiccentre.com.au|access-date=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Form ==
''Memento Mori'' is in one movement and last for approximately 14 minutes.&lt;ref name=faber2322 /&gt; It is in common time and the tempo is lento.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://awscdn.australianmusiccentre.com.au/documents/ds_7795_4241.pdf|title=Sample of the score of ''Memento Mori''|last=|first=|date=|website=Australian Music Centre|access-date=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The piece opens with an introduction, which them leads into two statements of the ''Dies irae'' plainchant, part of the Latin mass for the dead:

[[File:Dies_Irae_Treble.JPG|frameless|687x687px]]

Following this, the music oscillates between the pitches of G and A-flat. The composer notes that this is because the astronomer [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] believed those pitches to be the sound of the planet Earth.&lt;ref name="faber2322" /&gt; Then there a further two statements of the ''Dies irae'' plainchant, by which the music reaches a solemn climax, followed by more somber music.&lt;ref name="musicalcriticism.com" /&gt;

== Commission and performance ==
The work was commissioned by the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] for performance by [[West Australian Symphony Orchestra]].&lt;ref name=AMC7572 /&gt; It was first performed by the West Australian Symphony Orchestra, with [[Jorge Mester]] conducting, on July 2, 1993, in the [[Perth Concert Hall (Western Australia)|Perth Concert Hall]].&lt;ref name=AMC7572 /&gt;&lt;ref name=faber2322 /&gt; It has subsequently been performed several times, most recently by the Queensland Conservatorium Symphony Orchestra, with Peter Morris conducting, on March 27, 2015.&lt;ref name=AMC7572 /&gt;

'''Nuno felting''' is a fabric [[felt]]ing technique developed by Polly Stirling, a fiber artist from New South Wales, Australia, around 1992. The name is derived from the Japanese word "nuno" meaning cloth.&lt;ref&gt;Ziek, B. (2004). The felt frontier: I: Polly Stirling: Contemporary feltmaker. Surface Design Journal, 28(4), 35-38&lt;/ref&gt; The technique bonds loose fibre, usually [[wool]], into a sheer fabric such as [[silk]] gauze, creating a lightweight felt. The fibres can completely cover the background fabric, or they may be used as a decorative design that allows the backing fabric to show. Nuno felting often incorporates several layers of loose fibres combined to build up colour, texture, and/or design elements in the finished fabric.

The nuno felting process is particularly suitable for creating lightweight fabrics used to make clothing. The use of silk or other stable fabric in the felt creates fabric that will not stretch out of shape. Fabrics such as [[nylon]], [[muslin]], or other open weaves can be used as the felting background, resulting in a wide range of textural effects and colours.

[[File:Nuno felt jacket.jpg|thumb|Nuno Felted Jacket by Elynn Bernstein / A Mano Studios]]Nuno felt is an extremely versatile created fabric. It can be made in many weights to accommodate many different uses. It can be made much lighter in weight than traditional all-wool felt accounting for its wonderful movement and drape. Because of the range of weights possible with the cloth very fashionable and exciting garments can be made.

You would make a very light weight nuno fabric by laying one layer of loose fiber onto an open weave fabric base, thus being suitable for a summer dress. A much heavier nuno fabric results from laying 3-4 layers of loose fibers onto an open weave base making fabric suitable for a winter coat. A pair of boots could be made using even more layers of fibers.

Wool is only one kind of fiber that can be used in making this nonwoven cloth. There are hundreds of different wools and fibers to choose from, each with its own unique properties and handling abilities. Different fibers create different surface textures. Other types of fiber that will felt other than sheep's wool are: camel, llama, alpaca, Mohair goat, Cashmere goat, yak, Angora rabbit, beaver, dog, cat, human hair (think dredlocks).

'''Portrayal of female bodies in Chinese contemporary art''' has become a lot more diverse as women artists start to rise in China. Many contemporary Chinese women artists have employed the use of female bodies as the subject of their artworks. From the ancient and imperial period of China until early the 19th century, women's body images in Chinese art were predominantly portrayed through male artists' lenses. As a result, female bodies were often misrepresented. With the arrival of [[modernism]] in Chinese contemporary art, women now have more influences in the field of [[visual arts]]. Chinese women artists employ unconventional artistic expressions in order to speak about their experiences of being a female and an artist in a patriarchal society. Although the Chinese visual art field has been more inclusive in the recent decades, women artists’ representation in major art [[exhibition]]s is still significantly less than male artists. Therefore, artists and curators have made a joint effort to devote certain art exhibitions to just Chinese women artists.

== Historical Context ==
=== Ancient and Imperial Period ===
[[File:Chinese - Landscape with Figures - Walters 35101O.jpg|thumb]]
Traditionally, female bodies were only valued as carriers for the family bloodline. In traditional paintings, nude women were a taboo for the artists. As a result, the portrayal of women's bodies was formulaic, always with slim figures, usually leaning on another object or have a slightly bent posture to further emphasize their delicate bodies.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mary|first=Fong|date=Summer 1996|title=Images of Women in Traditional Chinese Painting|jstor=1358525|journal=Woman's Art Journal|volume=17|pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Female images would also demonstrate ideal qualities of women at that time. Aside from feminine beauty and charm, she should also possess the virtues of subordinating herself in a [[Confucianism|Confucian]] patriarchal society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=De Nigris|first=Ornella|date=March 2016|title=Traditional imagery of women as seen through female visual art: Hung Liu|url=|journal=International Communication of Chinese Culture|volume=3|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, women in these ancient paintings all wore long silk skirts that came down to the ankles. They could only show the part of their body above their chest. Their appearance, combined with their slender body figures, showed the submissive and demure qualities, which was desirable for male audiences.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== 1970s-1980s ===
A drastic change in ideal femininity occurred in 1966 and 1967 when the [[Cultural Revolution]] in China took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Art of Modern China|last=Andres|first=Julia|publisher=University of California Press|year=2012|isbn=9780520238145|location=|pages=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cultural Revolution, led by [[Mao Zedong]], denounced the traditional image of women's inferiority and calls for a women's liberation in the new China. Propaganda tools, such as performance art, films, and posters, strongly supported this movement and effectively constructed and broadcast a new female identity. Feminine beauty was no longer characterized by delicate figures, but instead by masculinized images of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Zhuying|date=2015|title=Female Masculinity and the Image of Women in the Chinese Cultural Revolution|url=|journal=The International Academic Forum|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, "Iron girls" represented the permissible appearances of women in the 1970s. They should not wear anything that showed their female curves. Moreover, women were encouraged to dress like men and go to work like men did, given that Mao called for a "gender erasure" in order to make "Chinese women in new China."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pei|first=Yuxin|date=2006|title=Iron Girls, Strong Women, Beautiful Women Writers and Super Girls: A Discourse Analysis of the Gender Performance of Women in Contemporary China|url=|journal=Lilith: A Feminist History Journal|volume=15|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to "Iron Girls," "Strong Women" images were popularized through mass media, such as [[cartoon]]s and local newspapers. Their appearance was defined by masculinized traits: tanned skin tone, sturdy figures, and blue and black work uniforms. Feminine features, like smooth skin and hands, were seen as something to be ashamed of because they were expected to be contributing to the nation's economy like men did.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Contemporary Portrayal of Women Bodies ==

=== Installation ===

==== "Trauma" ====
In her installation series, "Trauma", [[Hung Liu]] portrays a bound-foot woman. [[Foot binding]] was practiced among Chinese women from the Song dynasty up until the early 20th century. Women would wrap their feet tightly in order to keep them small, which was characterized as a feminine beauty at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cultural Encyclopedia of the Body|last=Pitts-Taylor|first=Victoria|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2008|isbn=9780313341458|location=|pages=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Liu's installation pieces, she repeatedly shows an emotionless woman with her naked feet. As a result of the foot binding cultural, these women had deformed feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Elaine H.|date=|title="Bad Women": Asian American Visual Artists Hanh Thi Pham, Hung Liu, and Yong Soon Min|jstor=3178131|journal=Feminist Studies|volume=22|pages=589}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Paintings ===

==== Feng Jiali's Oil Paintings ====
Feng Jiali is famous for her [[oil painting]] of explicit images of [[female]] bodies. A series of her paintings depict young, school-aged [[Chinese people|Chinese]] girls, usually skimpily dressed in the bath or laying in bed. The girls in her paintings almost always look directly at the viewers, some innocent-looking, some with a confrontational gaze.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hwee Leng Teo|first=Phyllis|date=January 2010|title=Alternative Agency in Representation by Contemporary Chinese Women Artists|url=|journal=Asian Culture and History|volume=2|pages=5|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another series of her works involves photographs of her [[Pregnancy|pregnant]] body. By revealing her own pregnant body fearlessly in front of the camera, she challenges the traditional views of pregnant body as something private and a mean to continue the family line, favoring boys over girls, and following the [[one-child policy]]. Because pregnant [[Nude (art)|nude]] is normally not defined as the ideal beauty found in female bodies, Feng’s photo collage expresses another aspect of being a woman. She desired to express the hardships and anxieties of being pregnant, which contradicts with the conventional, sacred portrayal of childbirth by many male artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/853244969|title=New modern Chinese women and gender politics : the centennial of the end of the Qing Dynasty|last=Chen|first=Ya-chen|publisher=Routledge|others=|year=2014|isbn=9780415841382|location=New York|pages=115|oclc=853244969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== "Banana Leaves Series" ====
Cai Jin, another contemporary oil painter, also challenges the traditional taboos of nudity in ancient Chinese art history. Unlike Feng Jiali, however, Cai articulates female bodies in a semi-abstract way by using organic elements in her paintings. A series of her paintings depict women's bodies shaped like banana tree leaves. Unlike many conventional portrayals of the female body that serves in the interest of male audiences, Cai painted the bodies like decomposed flesh, which is then metamorphosed into dripping, red, [[Banana leaf|banana leaves]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Traditionally, plants, especially flowers, are associated with femininity. However, Cai made a modern twist on this subject and made it into a somewhat unpleasant-looking and distorted image, rejecting the stereotypical delicate women and flowers association.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Like how Feng declared that pregnant bodies can be art too, Cai had made an assertion that although women's bodies aren't always going to be maintained in a perfect way, they can still become a form of art.

=== Performance Arts ===

==== "Opening of the Great Wall" ====

In ''Opening of the Great Wall'', He Chengyao presented her own naked body in a public space in 2001 and took a series of photographs of herself. The photographs documented her walking confidently with her upper body being nude. She held her bright red bra on her right hand and tied her sweater around the waist. She had a deadpan expression on her face and a confident posture as she walks toward the camera. The photo was taken on the [[Great Wall of China]], which is one of the most popular scenic spots in [[Beijing]], China.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Negotiating Difference : Chinese Contemporary Art in the Global Context|last=Birgit|first=Hopfener|publisher=Verlag und Datenbank fur Geisteswissenschaften|year=2012|isbn=9783897397170|location=Weimar, Germany|pages=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:"Your Body" by Xiang Jing at The Saatchi Gallery, London.jpg|thumb|''Your Body'' (2005, fiberglass &amp; paint, 270×160×150cm) at The Saatchi Gallery, The Revolution Continues: New Art from China, 2008]]
Despite the fact that she was surrounded by many curious tourists, He still maintained a confident look. She had also spontaneously joined in an [[Installation art|installation]] by a male artist, [[HA Schult|H.A. Schult]], which was exhibited on the Great Wall at the same time. Whether intended or not, she had made her appearance as a Chinese women artist in the mainstream of male art production. Furthermore, although her piece took place in 2001, women's nudity in public spaces was still considered taboo at the time.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Czechónska|first=Magdalena|date=2012|title=Body Linguistic Visibility and Retrieved Bodies of the 20th and 21st Century in Chinese Women's Literature and Art|url=|journal=The Central European Journal of Social Sciences and Humanities|volume=25|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== "Broadcast Exercise" ====

He Chengyao completed this [[performance art]] piece in 2004 at the Shanghai Doland Museum of Modern Art, which combined the themes of body and identity. As the title of the piece suggested, He Chengyao performed a series of exercises in front of a large group of audiences, while her naked body was tightly wrapped with tape.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Her movement caused the tape to be ripped apart one by one. She also wrapped her self with the sticky side of the tape out, which made her body parts stuck together and making it increasingly harder to perform the exercise.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Sculpture ===

==== "Your Body" ====
[[Xiang Jing (artist)|Xiang Jing]] is a Beijing-based sculptor. She is best known for her depiction of realistic nude women sculptures. One of her sculptures, "Your Body", portrays a nude and bald woman slumping in a chair with her legs spread open. There's a prominent scar on the right side of her abdomen. She has sagging breasts, belly fat rolls, and blank expression on her face. None of these qualities fall under the expectation of the ideal female body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Xhingyu|date=October 2009|title=Xiang Jing: Shanghai Art Museum|url=|journal=Sculpture|volume=28|pages=78|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Representation of Contemporary Women Artists in Exhibitions ==
Though efforts have been made in order to make the visual art field more inclusive, women's artworks have still been underrepresented in major [[exhibition]]s. In the late 1980s, when the first major Chinese Art exhibition took place, only five women, out of sixty-seven artists and participants, were included in the show. While artists from mainland China, [[Taiwan]], and [[Hong Kong]], were being recognized for their diverse identities, women artists' participation in this first Chinese exhibition were not acknowledged.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Similarly, in the traveling exhibition, ''Transience: Chinese Experimental Art at the End of Twentieth Century'' in 1998, only three women artists presented their artworks. The curator of this exhibition, Wu Hung, intended to provide a platform for experimental Chinese art to take place. However, it appears that women's innovative artistic expressions were still being excluded and didn't gain as many recognition as male Chinese artists have had.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The issue of unequal representation among male and female Chinese artists did receive some attention from the public. As a result, curators and artists have made a joint effort to devote certain exhibition and publications solely for female artists.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== ''Century Women'', National Gallery of China, Beijing (1998) ===

''Century Women'' was one of the first exhibitions dedicated to Chinese women artists. It intended to raise awareness on female experiences, roles, subject matters, and most importantly, art practices through the perspective of women living in contemporary Chinese society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition to providing a platform to showcase artworks made by Chinese women, it also exhibited photos and documents showing women's art production in China. More than seventy artists participated in this exhibition and presented over five hundred pieces of artworks&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== ''Her Presence in Colors VIII: International Women Artists Exhibition,'' National Gallery of China, Beijing (2008) ===

This exhibition was held concurrently around the world, such as China, [[Singapore]], [[Germany]], and the [[United States]], to spread pan-Asian feminist artworks. Specifically, the show in [[New York City|New York]], ''Against the Tide (1998),'' featured five female artists who were born in China and grew up during the Cultural Revolution. Cai Jin, who also participated in this show, presented her Banana Plant series in the show, which is a suggestive form of presenting female nude bodies in a public space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/08/arts/art-in-review-534161.html|title=Art in Review|last=Cotter|first=Holland|access-date=2018-05-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Adam''' {{Post-nominals|post-noms=[[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society of London|FRS]] [[Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland|FSA (Scot)]] [[Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London|FSA]] [[Royal Society of Arts|FRSA]]}} (3 July 1728 – 3 March 1792) was a Scottish [[neoclassical architect]], interior designer and [[furniture designer]]. He was the son of [[William Adam (architect)|William Adam]] (1689–1748), Scotland's foremost architect of the time, and trained under him. With his older brother [[John Adam (architect)|John]], Robert took on the family business, which included lucrative work for the [[Board of Ordnance]], after William's death.

In 1754, he left for Rome, spending nearly five years on the continent studying architecture under [[Charles-Louis Clérisseau]] and [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi]]. On his return to Britain he established a practice in London, where he was joined by his younger brother [[James Adam (architect)|James]]. Here he developed the "[[Adam Style]]", and his theory of "movement" in architecture, based on his studies of antiquity and became one of the most successful and fashionable architects in the country. Adam held the post of [[Office of Works|Architect of the King's Works]] from 1761 to 1769.

Robert Adam was a leader of the first phase of the classical revival in England and Scotland from around 1760 until his death.&lt;ref&gt;Pevsner, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; He influenced the development of Western architecture, both in Europe and in [[Architecture of the United States|North America]]. Adam designed interiors and fittings as well as houses.&lt;ref&gt;Adam silver (1953). Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, London. Her Majesty's Stationery Office ([[HMSO]]), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life===
[[Image:High School, Blackfriars 1578.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Royal High School (1578–1777) on site of Blackfriars Monastery, Edinburgh.]]
Adam was born on 3 July 1728 at Gladney House in [[Kirkcaldy]], Fife, the second son Mary Robertson (1699–1761), the daughter of William Robertson of Gladney, and architect William Adam.&lt;ref name="celebration" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/105|title=Adam, Robert (1728–1792), architect|last=|first=|work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/105}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a child he was noted as having a "feeble constitution".&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; From 1734 at the age of six Adam attended the [[Royal High School, Edinburgh]]&lt;ref&gt;Graham, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; where he learned [[Latin]] (from the second year lessons were conducted in Latin)&lt;ref name="Graham, p. 4"&gt;Graham, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; until he was 15, he was taught to read works by [[Virgil]], [[Horace]], [[Sallust]] and parts of [[Cicero]] and in his final year [[Livy]].&lt;ref name="Graham, p. 4"/&gt; In autumn 1743 he matriculated at the [[University of Edinburgh]],&lt;ref name="Graham, p. 26"&gt;Graham, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; and compulsory classes for all students were: the [[Greek language]], [[logic]], [[metaphysics]] and [[natural philosophy]].&lt;ref name="Graham, p. 26"/&gt; Students could choose three elective subjects, Adam attended classes in mathematics, taught by [[Colin Maclaurin]], and anatomy, taught by [[Alexander Monro (primus)|Alexander Monro ''primus'']].&lt;ref&gt;Graham, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; His studies were interrupted by the arrival of [[Bonnie Prince Charlie]] and his Highlanders, who occupied Edinburgh during the [[Jacobite rising of 1745|1745 Jacobite rising]]. At the end of the year, Robert fell seriously ill for some months, and it seems unlikely that he returned to university, having completed only two years of study.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, pp. 79–80&lt;/ref&gt;

On his recovery from illness in 1746, he joined his elder brother John as apprentice to his father. He assisted William Adam on projects such as the building of [[Inveraray Castle]] and the continuing extensions of [[Hopetoun House]]. William's position as Master Mason to the [[Board of Ordnance]] also began to generate much work, as the Highlands were fortified following the failed [[Jacobite risings|Jacobite revolt]]. Robert's early ambition was to be an artist rather than architect, and the style of his early sketches in the manner of [[Salvator Rosa]] are reflected in his earliest surviving architectural drawings, which show picturesque [[gothic architecture|gothic]] [[Folly|follies]].&lt;ref name="Fleming81"&gt;Fleming, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; William Adam died in June 1748, and left Dowhill, a part of the Blair Adam estate which included a [[tower house]], to Robert.

===Architectural practice in Edinburgh===
[[Image:Hopetoun03.JPG|thumb|250px|Entrance front of [[Hopetoun House]], designed by William Adam and modified by the Adam Brothers]]

On William Adam's death, John Adam inherited both the family business and the position of Master Mason to the Board of Ordnance. He immediately took Robert into partnership, later to be joined by James Adam. The Adam Brothers' first major commission was the decoration of the grand [[state apartments]] on the first floor at Hopetoun House, followed by their first "new build" at [[Dumfries House]]. For the Board of Ordnance, the brothers were the main contractor at [[Fort George, Highland|Fort George]], a large modern fort near [[Inverness]] designed by [[military engineer]] Colonel Skinner. Visits to this project, begun in 1750, would occupy the brothers every summer for the next 10 years, and, along with works at many other barracks and forts, provided Robert with a solid foundation in practical building.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, pp. 85–86&lt;/ref&gt;

In the winter of 1749–1750, Adam travelled to London with his friend, the poet [[John Home]]. He took the opportunity for architectural study, visiting [[Wilton House|Wilton]], designed by [[Inigo Jones]], and the Queens Hermitage in [[Richmond, London|Richmond]] by Roger Morris. His sketchbook of the trip also shows a continuing interest in gothic architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

Among his friends at Edinburgh were the philosophers [[Adam Ferguson]] and [[David Hume]] and the artist [[Paul Sandby]] whom he met in the Highlands. Other Edinburgh acquaintances included Gilbert Elliot, [[William Wilkie]], John Home and [[Alexander Wedderburn, 1st Earl of Rosslyn|Alexander Wedderburn]].&lt;ref name="Fleming81"/&gt;

===Grand Tour===
[[File:SPLIT-Adam plan restitution.jpg|thumb|left|Plan of the Diocletian palace in Split, Croatia. R. Adam 1764]]
[[File:Peristyle of Diocletian's Palace in Split, Robert Adam, 1764 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Peristyle of the Diocletian palace in Split, Croatia. R. Adam 1764]]
On 3 October 1754, Robert Adam in the company of his brother James (who went as far as Brussels) set off from Edinburgh for his [[Grand Tour]], stopping for a few days in London, where they visited the [[Mansion House, London]], [[St Stephen Walbrook]],&lt;ref&gt;Graham, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; [[St Paul's Cathedral]], Windsor, Berkshire, in the company of [[Thomas Sandby]] who showed them his landscaping at [[Windsor Great Park]] and [[Virginia Water Lake]].&lt;ref&gt;Graham, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; They sailed from [[Dover]] arriving in [[Calais]]&lt;ref&gt;Graham, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; on 28 October 1754.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; He joined [[Charles Hope-Weir]], brother of the [[John Hope, 2nd Earl of Hopetoun|Earl of Hopetoun]] in Brussels&lt;ref&gt;Graham, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; and together they travelled to Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Hope agreed to take Adam on the tour at the suggestion of his uncle, the Marquess of Annandale, who had undertaken the Grand Tour himself. While in Brussels the pair attended a Play and [[wikt:masquerade|Masquerade]], as well as visiting churches and palaces in the city.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; Travelling on to [[Tournai]], then [[Lille]], where they visited the Citadal designed by [[Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban]].&lt;ref&gt;Graham, p. 53-54&lt;/ref&gt; By 12 November 1754 Adam and Hope were in Paris where they took lodgings in Hotel de Notre Dame.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

Adam and Hope travelled on to Italy together, before falling out in Rome over travelling expenses and accommodation. Robert Adam stayed on in Rome until 1757, studying classical architecture and honing his drawing skills. His tutors included the French architect and artist [[Charles-Louis Clérisseau]], and the Italian artist [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi]]. Here, he became acquainted with the work of the pioneering classical archaeologist and art historian, theorist [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]]. On his return journey, Adam and Clerisseau spent time intensively studying the ruins of [[Diocletian's Palace]] at Spalato in [[Dalmatia]] (now known as [[Split (city)|Split]], in modern [[Croatia]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=17691 C.M. Hogan, "Diocletian's Palace", The Megalithic Portal, A. Burnham ed, 6 Oct 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; These studies were later published as ''Ruins of the Palace of the Emperor Diocletian at Spalatro in Dalmatia'' in 1764.

===Architectural practice in London===
[[Image:Admiralty Screen.jpg|thumb|left|Admiralty Screen 1759-61, Whitehall, London, one of Adam's first executed buildings after his grand tour]]
[[Image:Kedleston Hall 20080730-06.jpg|thumb|[[Kedleston Hall]]. The south front by Robert Adam, based on the [[Arch of Constantine]] in Rome]]
He returned to Britain in 1758 and set up in business in London with his brother James Adam. They focused on designing complete schemes for the decoration and furnishing of houses. [[Palladian architecture|Palladian]] design was popular, and Robert designed a number of country houses in this style,&lt;ref&gt;Roth, p. 397&lt;/ref&gt; but he evolved a new, more flexible style incorporating elements of classical [[Roman architecture|Roman]] design alongside influences from [[Architecture of Ancient Greece|Greek]], [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] and [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] styles.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, p. 402&lt;/ref&gt; The Adam brothers' success can also be attributed to a desire to design everything down to the smallest detail, ensuring a sense of unity in their design. In Adam interiors, all the furnishings were custom designed to accord with the decoration of the room in a unified harmony. Often the carpets were woven to match the intricate patterns of the ceiling above, while every fitting including sconces, mirrors, and doorknobs also received a custom design emulating the motifs of the room.&lt;ref name="Parissien"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Neoclassicism| author=David Irwin| publisher=Phaidon| year=1997| p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Adams' practice was not without mishap, however. In 1768 the Adam brothers purchased a 99-year lease for a marshy plot of land beside the Thames in [[Westminster, London|Westminster]], where they built a 24-house terrace development known as the [[Adelphi Buildings|Adelphi]].&lt;ref name="Parissien"&gt;{{cite book| title=Adam Style| author=Steven Parissien| publisher=Phaidon| year=1992| p=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was very ambitious and is the first instance where terraced houses were designed individually to give unified harmony to the whole development (previously terraced houses were built to one replicated design side-by-side, around a square).&lt;ref name="Parissien"/&gt; However, the project became a [[white elephant]] for Robert and his brothers, with uncertain financing and costs spiraling out of control. The houses were built on a huge artificial terrace resting on vaulted substructures on the level of the Thames, which Robert Adam was certain could be leased to the British government as warehouses. However, this interest failed to materialize, and the Adam brothers were left with huge debts and in 1772 had to lay off 3,000 workmen and cease building. Adam himself moved into one of the houses in the Adelphi, along with supportive friends like [[David Garrick]] and [[Josiah Wedgewood]], who opened a showroom for his ceramics in one of the houses. In 1774, a public lottery was held to raise funds for the brothers, which allowed them to avert bankruptcy.&lt;ref name="Parissien"/&gt;

==Public life==
[[Image:Pulteney Bridge, Bath 2.jpg|thumb|left|200px|One of Adam's masterpieces: [[Pulteney Bridge]], [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]]]

Adam was elected a fellow of the [[Royal Society of Arts]] in 1758 and of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]] in 1761, the same year he was appointed Architect of the [[Office of Works|King's Works]] (jointly with [[William Chambers (architect)|Sir William Chambers]]). His younger brother James succeeded him in this post when he relinquished the role in 1768 to devote more time to his elected office as member of Parliament for [[Kinross-shire (UK Parliament constituency)|Kinross-shire]].

==Architectural style==
Robert Adam rejected the [[Palladian]] style, as introduced to England by [[Inigo Jones]], and advocated by [[Lord Burlington]], as "ponderous" and "disgustful".&lt;ref name="G&amp;M106"&gt;Glendinning and McKechnie, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; However, he continued their tradition of drawing inspiration directly from [[classical antiquity]], during his four-year stay in Europe.&lt;ref name="G&amp;M106"/&gt; Adam developed a new style of architectural decoration, one which was more archaeologically accurate than past Neoclassical styles, but nonetheless innovative and not bound only by ancient precedents. In ''Works in Architecture'', co-authored with his brother James, the brothers stated that Graeco-Roman examples should "serve as models which we should imitate, and as standards by which we ought to judge."&lt;ref name="Parissien"&gt;{{cite book| title=Adam Style| author=Steven Parissien| publisher=Phaidon| year=1992| p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discoveries in [[Herculaneum]] and [[Pompeii]] ongoing at the time provided ample material for Robert Adam to draw on for inspiration.&lt;ref name="Parissien"/&gt;

The Adam brothers' principle of "movement" was largely Robert's conception, although the theory was first written down by James. "Movement" relied on dramatic contrasts and diversity of form, and drew on the [[picturesque]] aesthetic. The first volume of the Adam brother's ''Works'' (1773) cited [[Kedleston Hall]], designed by Robert in 1761, as an outstanding example of movement in architecture.

By contrasting room sizes and decorative schemes, Adam applied the concept of movement to his interiors also. His style of decoration, described by Pevsner as "Classical [[Rococo]]", drew on Roman "[[grotesque]]" [[stucco]] decoration.&lt;ref name="G&amp;M106"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pevsner, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
[[File:Bookcase, Robert Adam (1728-1792), 1776 -IMG 1604.JPG|thumb|right|Adam designed bookcase 1776, probably built by Thomas Chippendale]] 
Robert Adam's work had influenced the direction of architecture and design across the western world. In England his collaboration with Thomas Chippendale resulted in some of the finest neoclassicist designs of the time, most notably in the [[Harewood House]] collection of Chippendale's work. In North America, the [[Federal style]] owes much to neoclassicism as practised by Adam. In Europe, Adam notably influenced [[Charles Cameron (architect)|Charles Cameron]], the Scotsman who designed [[Tsarskoye Selo]] and other Russian palaces for [[Catherine the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;Glendinning &amp; McKechnie, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the time of his death, Adam's neoclassicism was being superseded in Britain by a more severe, Greek phase of the classical revival, as practised by [[James Stuart (1713-1788)|James "Athenian" Stuart]]. The Adam brothers employed several draughtsmen who would go on to establish themselves as architects, including [[George Richardson (architect)|George Richardson]], and the Italian [[Joseph Bonomi the Elder|Joseph Bonomi]], who Robert originally hired in Rome.

===Written works===
During their lifetime Robert and James Adam published two volumes of their designs, ''Works in Architecture of Robert and James Adam'' (in 1773–1778 and 1779; a third volume was published posthumously, in 1822).

==Death and burial==
Adam had long suffered from stomach and bowel problems,&lt;ref name="Graham"&gt;Graham, Roderick (2009) ''Arbiter of Elegance: A Biography of Robert Adam'', Birlinn, {{ISBN|978-1-84158-802-5}}, pp. 328–329&lt;/ref&gt; probably caused by a [[peptic ulcer]] and [[irritable bowel syndrome]]. While at home – 11 [[Albermarle Street]], London – on 1 March 1792, one of the ulcers burst, and on 3 March Adam died.&lt;ref name="Graham" /&gt;

The funeral was held on 10 March; he was buried in the south aisle of [[Westminster Abbey]].&lt;ref name="Graham" /&gt; The [[pall-bearer]]s were several of his clients: [[Henry Scott, 3rd Duke of Buccleuch]]; [[George Coventry, 6th Earl of Coventry]]; [[James Maitland, 8th Earl of Lauderdale]]; [[David Murray, 2nd Earl of Mansfield]]; [[Lord Frederick Campbell]] and [[Sir William Pulteney, 5th Baronet]].&lt;ref name="Graham" /&gt;

Knowing he was dying, he drafted his will on 2 March 1792. Having never married, Adam left his estate to his sisters Elizabeth Adam and Margaret Adam.&lt;ref name="Graham" /&gt;

His [[obituary]] appeared in the March 1792 edition of ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]'':&lt;ref&gt;Graham, p. 330&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is somewhat remarkable that the Arts should be deprived at the same time of two of their greatest ornaments, Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]] and Mr Adam: and it is difficult to say which of them excelled most in his particular profession... 
Mr Adam produced a total change in the architecture of this country: and his fertile genius in elegant ornament was not confined to the decoration of buildings, but has been diffused to every branch of manufacture. His talents extend beyond the lie of his own profession: he displayed in his numerous drawings in landscape a luxuriance of composition, and an effect of light and shadow, which have scarcely been equalled...to the last period of his life, Mr Adam displayed an increasing vigour of genius and refinement of taste: for in the space of one year preceding his death, he designed eight great public works, besides twenty five private buildings, so various in their style, and so beautiful in their composition, that they have been allowed by the best judges, sufficient of themselves, to establish his fame unrivalled as an artist.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He left nearly 9,000 drawings, 8,856 of which (by both Robert and James Adam) were subsequently purchased in 1833 for £200 by the architect [[John Soane]] and are now at the [[Sir John Soane's Museum|Soane Museum]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;page 11, The Adam Brothers in Rome: Drawings from the Grand Tour, A.A.

'''''Saint Jerome in His Study''''' ({{lang-de|Der heilige Hieronymus im Gehäus}}) is an [[engraving]] of 1514 by the German artist [[Albrecht Dürer]]. Saint [[Jerome]] is shown sitting behind his desk, engrossed in work. The table, on the corner of which is a cross, is typical of the [[Renaissance]]. An imaginary line from Jerome's head passing through the cross would arrive at the skull on the window ledge, as if contrasting death and the [[Resurrection]]. The lion in the foreground is part of the traditional [[iconography]] of St. Jerome, and near it is a sleeping dog, an animal found frequently in Dürer's works, symbolizing loyalty. Both creatures are part of Jerome's story in the ''[[Golden Legend]]'' (c. 1260), which contained fanciful [[Hagiography|hagiographies]] of saints.

''St. Jerome in His Study'' is often considered as part of a group of three Dürer engravings, the other two being the well-known ''[[Melencolia I]]'' (1514) and  ''[[Knight, Death and the Devil]]'' (1513). Together they have been viewed as representing the three spheres of activity recognized in medieval times: ''Knight, Death, and the Devil'' belongs to the moral sphere and the "active life"; ''Melencolia I'' represents the intellectual; and ''St. Jerome'' the theological and contemplative life.

The composition is intimate, but the viewer has difficulty locating himself in relation to the picture's space. Thomas Puttfarken suggests that while the scene is very close to the observer, Dürer did not intend the viewer to feel present: "the intimacy is not ours, but the saint's as he is engrossed in study and meditation" (94).  Art historian [[Erwin Panofsky]] comments on the perspective:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The position of the sight point, quite far off centre, strengthens the impression of a representation determined not by the objective law of the architecture but by the subjective standpoint of the spectator who is just entering – a representation which owes to precisely this perspective arrangement a large part of its peculiarly 'intimate' effect. (Qtd. in Puttfarken, 94)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Jonah and the gourd vine==
Using a dried [[gourd]] hanging from the rafters, Dürer memorializes Jerome's [[courage]], in the face of a long brewing [[Philology|philological]] controversy&lt;ref&gt;Peter W. Parshall, "Albrecht Dürer's Saint Jerome in his Study: A Philological Reference," The Art Bulletin 53 (September 1971), pp. 303-5, [http://www.oberlin.edu/amam/DurerSt.Jerome.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; with [[St. Augustine]] in his preference&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/bible/jon004.htm Chapter 4 of the Book of Jonah in concurrent Greek:English:Latin versions&lt;/ref&gt; for Greek over Latin nomenclature for the fast-growing plant known in Hebrew as קיקיון (qiyqayown) encountered only this once, in the [[Book of Jonah]]. The [[Old Testament]] text closes abruptly ({{bibleverse|Jonah||4}}) with an epistolary warning&lt;ref&gt;Catholic Encyclopedia article titled '''Jonah''' http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08497b.htm&lt;/ref&gt; based on the [[emblem]]atic trope of a fast-growing vine present in Persian narratives, and popularized widely in certain collections of [[Aesop's fables]] such as [[The Gourd and the Palm-tree]]. Jerome elected to use '''[[Hedera]]''' (from the Greek, meaning ivy) over the more common Latin '''[[cucurbita]]''' from which the related English plant name ''cucumber'' is derived, perhaps to avoid confusion while making a more perfect analogy to the typology of Christ [[:it:File:Christ the True Vine icon (Athens, 16th century).jpg|''"I am the Vine you are the branches"'']]. In fact Augustine's view had already prevailed by Dürer's time.

The '''church of St Mary at Mount Naranco''' ({{lang-es|Iglesia de Santa María del Naranco}}; {{lang-ast|Ilesia de Santa María'l Narancu}}) is a [[Roman Catholic]] [[Asturias|Asturian]] [[Pre-Romanesque art|pre-Romanesque]] [[Asturian architecture]] church on the slope of [[Monte Naranco|Mount Naranco]] situated {{convert|3|km}} from [[Oviedo]], northern [[Spain]]. [[Ramiro I of Asturias]] ordered it to be built as a royal palace as part of a larger complex that also incorporated the nearby [[San Miguel de Lillo|church of San Miguel de Lillo]], 100&amp;nbsp;meters away. It was completed in 842 and consecrated in 848. Its structural features, such as the barrel vault&amp;nbsp;— with transverse ribs corresponding one-to-one with contraforts at the exterior, make it a clear precursor of the Romanesque construction. The exterior decorations, as well as the use of stilted arches mark the intended verticality of the composition.

It was declared a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]] in December 1985. It was declared ''[[Bien de Interés Cultural]]'' in 1885.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

== History ==
Built as a recreational palace, it is situated on the southern side of [[Monte Naranco|Mount Naranco]] facing the city, and was originally part of a series of royal buildings located in the outskirts. Its character as a civil building changed in the 12th century when it was converted into a church dedicated to [[St. Mary]]. The Palace of Santa María del Naranco, involved a significant stylistic, morphological, constructive and decorative renovation of Pre-Romanesque, supplementing it with new, innovative resources, representing a leap forward with respect to immediately previous periods.

On its altar, a Latin inscription provides the date of consecration:''{{lang|la|(...) Per Famulum Tuum Ranimirum.  Principe Gloriosum Cum Paterna Regina Coniuge Renovasti Hoc Habitaculum Nimia. Vetustate Consumptvm Et Pro Eis Aedificasti Hanc Haram Benedictionis Gloriosae.  Sanctae Mariae In Locum Hunc Summum Exaudi  Eos De Caelorum Habitaculo Tuo Et.  (...) Die VIIII&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; Kalendas Iulias Era Dccclxxxvia}}''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=De Selgas|first=Fortunato|title=Las Iglesias del Naranco|year=1909|publisher=Boletín de la Sociedad de Excursiones|pages=19–40| url=https://archive.org/stream/boletn1718sociuoft#page/n33/mode/2up|accessdate=5 April 2012| language=Spanish|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090624020601/http://www.archive.org/stream/boletn1718sociuoft|archivedate=2009-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|(...) by means of your servant [[Ramiro I of Asturias|Ramiro]], glorious prince, together with his wife Queen Paterna renewed this building consumed by much antiquity,and by means of them built the east altar for the benediction of glorious Saint Maria in this place (...)

This palace's innovations amazed chroniclers, who mention it repeatedly. The [[Crónica Silense]], written around the year 1015, about 300 years after the construction of the palace, said that [[Ramiro I of Asturias]] "built many constructions, two miles away from Oviedo, with sandstone and marble in a vaulted work: (...) He also made (...), a palace without wood, of admirable construction and vaulted below and above,..."

The chroniclers marvelled at its proportions and slender shapes, its rich, varied decoration and the introduction of elongated barrel vaults thanks to the transverse arches, allowing support and eliminating wooden ceilings. This solution, timidly advanced in the Camara Santa ({{lang-en|Holy Chamber}}) of the [[Cathedral of San Salvador, Oviedo|Cathedral of San Salvador of Oviedo]], fully matured in Santa María del Naranco.

The palace, on a rectangular ground plan, has two floors. The lower level, or [[crypt]], quite low, has a central chamber and another two located on either side. The upper floor is accessed via a double exterior stairway adjoining the facade, leading into an identical layout as the lower floor; a central or noble hall with six blind semicircular arches along the walls, supported by columns built into the wall, and a mirador at each end. These are accessed via three arches, similar to those onto the wall, resting on columns with helicoidal rope moulding, typical of Pre-Romanesque. The barrel vault is made from [[tufa]] stone, and is held up by six transverse arches resting on consoles.

Santa María del Naranco represented a step forward from a decorative point of view by enriching the habitual standards and models with elements from painting, gold work and the textile arts. The rich decoration is concentrated in the hall and miradors of the upper floor, where it is especially worth noting the cubic-prismatic capitals (of [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] influence), decorated with reliefs framed by [[Rope|cord]] decoration (from local tradition) in trapezoid and triangular shapes, inside which there are sculpted forms of animals and humans. This kind of motif is repeated on the disks with central medallions located above the blind arches' intersections. The 32 medallions distributed around the building are similar in size and shape, varying the decorative designs and the interior figures (quadrupeds, birds, bunches of grapes, fantastic animals), a style inherited from the Visigoth period, in turn descended from Byzantine tradition.

The medallions have decorative bands above them, again framed by rope moulding, inside which four figures are scuipted and arranged symmetrically; the upper two carrying loads on their heads and the lower two representing soldiers on horseback carrying swords. These figures seem to have some kind of symbolic social meaning; the warriors who defend and support the men of prayer, or alternatively, the royal and ecclesiastic orders complementing each other.

Santa María del Naranco shows other, equally beautiful and important sculptural elements; for the first time, a [[cross|Greek cross]] appears sculpted as emblem of the Asturian monarchy, at the same time protecting the building from all evil, something which was to become habitual in the popular architecture of towns and villages. Other sculptural elements, such as the capitals of [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] inspiration on the miradors' triple-arched Windows or the altar stone in the eastern mirador (originally from the neighbouring [[San Miguel de Lillo|Church of San Miguel de Lillo]]), make this palace the most distinctive building in Pre-Romanesque, a singularity highlighted by being the only palace complex that has lasted until the present day with both [[Visigothic]] and [[Carolingian]] court structures.

== Building ==
The church of St Mary at Mount Naranco is unlike any contemporary example we are acquainted with. Practically it is a [[Roman architecture|Roman]] [[tetrastyle]] [[amphiprostyle]] temple,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fergusson|first=James |title=A history of architecture in all countries|publisher=John Murray|year=1867|volume=2|pages=123–124|chapter=Book VII: Spanish and Portugal|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uSsDAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=toc|isbn=0-548-16204-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; if such terms can be applied to a Christian edifice. So far as we can understand, the altar was placed originally in one of the porticos, and the worship was consequently probably external. The great difference seems to have been that there was a lateral entrance, and some of the communicants at least must have been accommodated in the interior. The ornamentation of the interior differs from classical models more than the plan. The columns are spirally fluted — a classical form — but the capitals are angular, and made to support arches. On the walls also there are curious medallions fiom which tho vaulting-ribs spring, which seem peculiar to the style, since they are found repeated in the church of [[Santa Cristina de Lena]].

==  History ==
The Superfest International Disability Film Festival began in [[Los Angeles]] in 1970 as a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting films representing the diverse disability community. At that time, Superfest was a small film showcase and not yet considered a film festival.&lt;ref name="Marvelous"/&gt; In 1982, Culture! Disability! Talent! (CDT) took over operations of Superfest. In 1995, CDT decided to move Superfest from Los Angeles to [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]. Berkeley is significant to the [[disability rights movement]] and [[independent living movement|independent living]].&lt;ref name="Marvelous"/&gt;

In 1998, Superfest expanded to encompass the San Francisco Bay Area.&lt;ref name="Festreview"/&gt; Annual film festivals were held in Berkeley from 1998 to 2011. In 2009, Superfest held a commemorative two-day program featuring 13 disability films the committee considered classics of disability in film called Superfest Classics.&lt;ref name="Classics"&gt;{{cite web|title=Descriptions of Superfest Classics|url=http://culturedisabilitytalent.org/superfest/sf2009.html|website=Internet Archive: Culture!

In 2015, Superfest expanded to a two-day festival and recognized the 25th anniversary of the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] being signed into legislation.&lt;ref name="Kazakstan"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Farrell|first1=Jonathan|title=Op-Ed: Films as far away as Kazakstan will premiere at Superfest|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/a-and-e/arts/op-ed-films-as-far-away-as-kazakstan-will-premiere-at-superfest/article/447913|website=Digital Journal|accessdate=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the beginnings as a grass-roots organization, Superfest has not been able to have a film festival each year since its founding. The 2016 festival was their 30th film festival.&lt;ref name="Celebrates"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Gar|title=Movies in the Margin: The Disability Film Festival, the UN Film Festival, and Films on Fracking|url=http://berkeleydailyplanet.com/issue/2016-10-21/article/45035|website=The Berkeley Daily Planet|accessdate=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Dissies==
In 2013, Superfest presented a special event. This event was to highlight films where disability had been mocked or portrayed in an insensitive manner.&lt;ref name="Dissies"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Patterson|first1=James|title=Film event highlights 'disses' of disabled|url=http://www.ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&amp;article=69162|website=The Bay Area Reporter|accessdate=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of films where disability is mocked are referred to as disability snub films.&lt;ref name="Dark"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cipriani|first1=Belo|title=Seeing in the Dark: Film festival celebrates disability|url=http://www.ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&amp;article=72012|website=The Bay Area Reporter|accessdate=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Dissies" mirror the [[Golden Raspberry Awards|Razzies]], where the award given is not an honor at all. Each year, a new "Dissie" is awarded from films nominated by the community. Mock "Dissie" awards are given each year to disability snub films.&lt;ref name="Comedic"/&gt;

== Directors ==
[[Pamela Walker]] led the film festival efforts from 1998 to 2001, after which, [[Liane Yasumoto]] took over operations.&lt;ref name="Describer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marvelous"/&gt; [[Catherine Kudlick]], the director of the [[Paul K.

Since 2012, when the Longmore Institute on Disability and [[LightHouse for the Blind and Visually Impaired]] have directed Superfest, there has been a film festival each year, and the festivals have sold out each time.&lt;ref name="Festreview"/&gt;

== Growth of the festival ==
Superfest now attracts over 300 attendees during the festival's two-day event.&lt;ref name="Marvelous"/&gt; Film makers from both beginning and established backgrounds showcase their projects at Superfest.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6282">[[Harold Shapero]] completed the '''Symphony for Classical Orchestra''' in [[B-flat major]] on March 10, 1947, in [[Newton Centre, Massachusetts]]. It is written for an orchestra consisting of [[piccolo]], 2 [[flute]]s, 2 [[oboe]]s, 2 [[clarinet]]s in B-flat, 2 [[bassoon]]s, [[contrabassoon]], 2 [[French horn|horn]]s in F, 2 [[trumpet]]s in C, 2 tenor [[trombone]]s and one bass (silent until the Finale&lt;ref&gt;Along with the piccolo and contrabassoon, pp. 170 — 171 (1992) Pollack. "As its title indicated, the work calls for forces smaller than the modern orchestra," but its exact instrumentation is found only in Beethoven's 5th, right down to the detail that piccolo, contrabassoon and trombones are reserved for the final movement.&lt;/ref&gt;), [[timpani]] and strings. Although labelled "Classical," many of the work's features point to Beethoven rather than Haydn or Mozart, such as "the way in which Shapero paces himself, alternating long passages in the tonic and the dominant, with fast, dramatic modulations often reserved for transitions and developments."&lt;ref&gt;p. 173 (1992) Pollack&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicolas Slonimsky]] remarked on how the piece is "premeditatedly cast in the proclamatory key of B-flat major, the natural tonality of the bugle, and ending in a display of tonic major triads."&lt;ref&gt;p. 846 (1971) Slonimsky&lt;/ref&gt; But there are modern features as well, with "the work's orchestration, in general, ... distinctively bright and brassy, and undoubtedly derived a fair amount from [[Walter Piston|Piston]] and [[Aaron Copland|Copland]], as well as from the composer's experience as a dance band arranger."&lt;ref&gt;p. 171 (1992) Pollack&lt;/ref&gt;

The work is in four movements:

# Adagio {{music|eighth}} = 48, 3/8 — Allegro {{music|half}} = 120 2/2
# Adagietto {{music|eighth}} = 54, [[E-flat major]], 8/8
# Vivace {{music|dottedhalf}} = 132 a due battute or {{music|dottedhalf}} = 138 a quattro battute, [[G major]] — [[E major]] — G major
# Allegro con spirito {{music|half}} = 138-144

Some commentators have found hints of the blues in the slow introduction to the first movement.&lt;ref&gt;p. 172 (1992) Pollack. "The form of the introduction itself, with its slow harmonic rhythm and three cadences in the tonic, faintly suggests a "blues" strophe, a suggestion that further contributes to the music's distinctively earthy character."&lt;/ref&gt; The ensuing Allegro is.

The Adagietto's theme "is classically balletic, with supple rhythms, graceful turns, sighing fourths, and sweet appoggiaturas and suspensions."&lt;ref&gt;p. 174 (1992) Pollack&lt;/ref&gt; The movement consists of "quasi-variations that ... are organized according to the sonata principle."&lt;ref&gt;p. 175 (1992) Pollack&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Scherzo, Shapero indicates it could be taken at two measures (battute) or four measures. These instructions naturally suggest the influence of Beethoven's ''Ninth Symphony'', but the scherzo theme itself ... points more directly to the ''Third''; Shapero updates Beethoven's two-note idea ... to include a jazzy flatted third. The movement contains other Beethovenian features: ghostly chromatics, ... a sort of peasant stomping, ... and a generous sense of humor, sometimes quite broad."&lt;ref&gt;pp. 176 — 177 (1992) Pollack&lt;/ref&gt;

The Finale is rich in interconnections to the preceding movements, but especially the first movement.&lt;ref&gt;p. 179 (1992) Pollack&lt;/ref&gt;

The symphony was given its premiere performance by [[Leonard Bernstein]] conducting the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]] on January 30, 1948&lt;ref&gt;p. 846 (1971) Slonimsky&lt;/ref&gt; and later in Hague.&lt;ref&gt;p. 149, Peyser (1987) Joan. New York ''The Coast-to-Coast Bestseller Bernstein: A Biography'' Ballantine Biography&lt;/ref&gt; "Bernstein went on ... to record the whole work with the Columbia Symphony Orchestra, a recording rough in spots, but whose passion and finesse clearly suited the music."&lt;ref&gt;p. 181 (1992) Pollack&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the twentieth century, there was only one other recording of the piece, by [[André Previn]] and the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra]],&lt;ref&gt;p. 767 (2005) Stevenson, "Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra" in Woodstra, Brennan, Schrott (editors) Chris, Gerald, Allen. New York ''All Music Guide to Classical Music: The Definitive Guide to Classical Music'' Hal Leonard Corporation&lt;/ref&gt; a fact that has not helped the work's reception.&lt;ref&gt;p. 181 (1992) Pollack&lt;/ref&gt; Aaron Copland thought highly of Shapero but did not like his inclination to "hide the brilliance of his own gifts behind the cloak of the great masters."&lt;ref&gt;p. 198 (1999) Pollack&lt;/ref&gt; Of Copland's works, Shapero always admired the Short Symphony,&lt;ref&gt;p. 200 (1999) Pollack&lt;/ref&gt; even after Copland's popular Symphony No. 3, of which "Shapero criticized, among other things, the first movement's trombone melody."&lt;ref&gt;p. 417 (1999) Pollack&lt;/ref&gt;

Much later on in his life, Copland dedicated one of his [[Emily Dickinson]] settings to Shapero.&lt;ref&gt;p. 442 (1999) Pollack&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the Symphony for Classical Orchestra, the composer, still in his twenties, "was producing a series of chamber and orchestral works, each one longer and grander than the last,"&lt;ref&gt;p. 166 (1992) Pollack&lt;/ref&gt; but afterwards wrote rather little music for the rest of his life. Fellow composer [[Arthur Victor Berger|Arthur Berger]], who like Shapero was a member of the "Harvard Stravinsky school, and considered the latter to be "arguably the most talented of us all,"&lt;ref&gt;p. 75 (2002) Berger&lt;/ref&gt; was puzzled by the way the latter's "composing activity tapered off" after "this illustrious beginning."&lt;ref&gt;p. 76 (2002) Berger&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Ballet Class''''' ([[French language|French]]: '''''La Classe de danse''''') is a painting by [[Edgar Degas]], which was painted between 1871 and 1874.&lt;ref name="Musée d'Orsay - La Classe de danse (The Ballet Class)"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/works-in-focus/search/commentaire/commentaire_id/the-ballet-class-3098.html|title=Musée d'Orsay - La Classe de danse (The Ballet Class)|publisher=[[Musée d'Orsay]]|accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is in the collection of the [[Musée d'Orsay]], [[Paris]], [[France]].&lt;ref name="Larousse - la Classe de danse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.larousse.fr/encyclopedie/oeuvre/la_Classe_de_danse/181368|title=Encyclopédie Larousse en ligne - la Classe de danse|work=Encyclopédie Larousse en ligne|publisher=[[Éditions Larousse]]|language=French|accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was [[Commission (art)|commissioned]] by [[Jean-Baptiste Faure]].&lt;ref name="Metropolitan Museum of Art - The Dance Class"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/438817?=&amp;imgNo=0&amp;tabName=object-information|title=Metropolitan Museum of Art - The Dance Class|publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Degas temporarily abandoned work on this painting, and delivered a [[The Dance Class (Degas, Metropolitan Museum of Art)|work of a similar name]] to Faure.&lt;ref name="Metropolitan Museum of Art - The Dance Class"/&gt;

==Plot==
&lt;!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. --&gt;
In 2009, an elderly Cecil Gaines [[Frame story|recounts]] his life story while waiting at the [[White House]] to meet the newly inaugurated president.

In 1926, at the age of seven, Gaines is raised on a [[Plantation complexes in the Southeastern United States|cotton plantation]] in [[Macon, Georgia|Macon]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. When the farm's owner [[rape]]s Cecil's mother, Cecil's father confronts him and is killed. Cecil is taken in by the estate's caretaker, who trains Cecil as a house servant.

In 1937, at age eighteen, Cecil leaves the plantation. Desperately hungry, he breaks into a hotel pastry shop. The elderly master servant, Maynard, takes pity on Cecil and gives him a job. Cecil learns advanced serving and interpersonal skills from Maynard, who later recommends Cecil for a position in a [[Washington, D.C.]] hotel. While working there, Cecil meets and marries Gloria, and the couple has two sons: Louis and Charlie. In 1957, Cecil is hired by the [[White House]] during [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s administration. White House [[maître d'hôtel]] Freddie Fallows introduces Cecil to head butler Carter Wilson and co-worker James Holloway. Cecil witnesses Eisenhower's reluctance to use troops to enforce school desegregation, then his resolve to uphold the law by [[Little Rock Nine|racially integrating]] [[Little Rock Central High School]] in [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Arkansas]].

Louis, the elder son, becomes a university student at [[Fisk University]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], although Cecil feels that the [[Deep South|South]] is too volatile. Louis joins a student program led by [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC) activist [[James Lawson (American activist)|James Lawson]], which leads to a [[Nonviolence|nonviolent]] [[sit-in]] at a [[Nashville sit-ins|segregated diner]], where he is arrested. Gloria, who feels that Cecil puts his job ahead of her, descends into [[alcoholism]].

In 1961, after [[John F. Kennedy]]'s inauguration, Louis and [[Freedom Riders|others]] are attacked by members of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] while on a [[Freedom Riders|freedom ride]] to [[Birmingham, Alabama]]. Louis participates in the 1963 [[Birmingham Campaign|Birmingham Children's Crusade]], where dogs and water cannons are used to stop the marchers, one of the movement's actions which inspires Kennedy to deliver [[Civil Rights Address|a national address]] proposing the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. After Kennedy is [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassinated]] his successor, [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], enacts the legislation. As a goodwill gesture, [[Jackie Kennedy]] gives Cecil one of the former president's [[necktie]]s.

Louis participates in the 1965 [[Selma to Montgomery marches|Selma Voting Rights Movement]], which inspires Johnson to demand that Congress enact the landmark [[1965 Voting Rights Act|Voting Rights Act of 1965]]. Johnson also gives Cecil a [[tie bar]].

In the late 1960s, after civil rights activist [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]'s [[Assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.|assassination]], Louis tells his family that he has joined the [[Black Panthers]]. Cecil orders Louis and his girlfriend to leave his house. Louis is arrested again. Cecil becomes aware of President [[Richard Nixon]]'s plans to suppress the Black Panthers.

Charlie confides to Louis that he plans to join the [[Vietnam War|war in Vietnam]]. After enlisting, Charlie is killed and buried at [[Arlington National Cemetery]]. When the Black Panthers resort to violence, Louis leaves the organization and returns to college, earning his [[master's degree]] in [[political science]] and eventually running for a seat in [[United States Congress|Congress]], although Cecil continues to hold resentment against him.

Cecil repeatedly confronts his supervisor at the White House over the unequal pay and career advancement provided to the black White House staff. With President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s support, Cecil prevails, his reputation growing to the point that he and his wife are invited by the Reagans to be guests at a state dinner. Cecil becomes uncomfortable with the class divisions in the White House. After witnessing Reagan's refusal to support [[Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act|economic sanctions]] against Apartheid [[South Africa]], Cecil resigns.

Gloria encourages Cecil to mend his relationship with Louis. Realizing his son's actions are heroic, Cecil joins Louis at a protest against [[Apartheid in South Africa|South African apartheid]]; they are arrested and jailed together.

In 2008, Gloria dies shortly before [[Barack Obama]] [[United States presidential election, 2008|is elected]] as the nation's first African-American president. Two months, two weeks and one day later, Cecil prepares to meet the newly [[First inauguration of Barack Obama|inaugurated]] President, wearing the articles he received from Kennedy and Johnson. [[Stephen W. Rochon]] approaches Cecil and tells him the president is ready, preparing to show him the way to the Oval Office. Cecil tells him that he knows the way.

==Production==

===Development===
[[Danny Strong]]'s screenplay is inspired by Wil Haygood's ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' article "A Butler Well Served by This Election".&lt;ref name="wapost"&gt;{{cite news |last=Haygood |first=Wil |title=A Butler Well Served by This Election|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/06/AR2008110603948_pf.html |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=November 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=The Reliable Source | date= August 6, 2013 | title= No, President Obama isn't doing a cameo in 'The Butler' | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/reliable-source/wp/2013/08/06/no-president-obama-isnt-doing-a-cameo-in-the-butler/ |department=Reliable Source (blog) | work=[[The Washington Post]] | accessdate=August 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project received initial backing in early 2011, when producers Laura Ziskin and Pam Williams approached [[Sheila Johnson]] for help in financing the film. After reading Danny Strong's screenplay, Johnson pitched in her own $2.7 million before bringing in several African-American investors. However, Ziskin died from cancer in June 2011. This left director Daniels and producing partner Hilary Shor to look for further producers on their own. They started with [[Cassian Elwes]], with whom they were working on [[The Paperboy (2012 film)|''The Paperboy'']]. Elwes joined the list of producers, and started raising funding for the film. In spring 2012, Icon U.K., a British financing and production company, added a $6 million guarantee against foreign pre-sales. Finally the film raised its needed $30 million budget through 41 producers and executive producers, including Earl W. Stafford, Harry I. Martin Jr., Brett Johnson, [[Michael Finley]], and Buddy Patrick. Thereafter, as film production started [[Weinstein Co.]] picked up U.S. distribution rights for the film. David Glasser, Weinstein Co. COO, called fund raising as an independent film, "a story that's a movie within itself."&lt;ref name=holly13&gt;{{cite web| title = Why 'Lee Daniels' The Butler' Has 41 Producers| url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/why-lee-daniels-butler-has-605011|date=August 14, 2013| accessdate = August 15, 2013|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Lee Daniels' The Butler: The film with FORTY ONE producers: How a host of stars and entrepreneurs raised $30m to fund The Butler |work=[[Daily Mail]] | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2394397/Lee-Daniels-The-Butler--The-film-FORTY-ONE-producers-How-host-stars-entrepreneurs-raised-30m-fund-The-Butler.html |date=August 15, 2013| accessdate = August 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Weinstein Company]] acquired the distribution rights for the film after [[Columbia Pictures]] put the film in [[Turnaround (filmmaking)|turnaround]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Brevet |first=Brad |title=New Look at 'The Butler' as the Weinstein Co.

===Critical response===
''The Butler'' received mostly positive reviews from critics, with a 71% rating on the [[film critic]] aggregate site [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 175 reviews. The site's consensus says, "Gut-wrenching and emotionally affecting, ''Lee Daniels' The Butler'' overcomes an uneven narrative thanks to strong performances from an all-star cast."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/lee_daniels_the_butler/ |title=''Lee Daniels' The Butler'' (2013) |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |date=August 16, 2013 |accessdate=August 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another review aggregator, [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[Normalization (statistics)|normalized]] rating out of 100 top reviews from mainstream critics, calculated a score of 66 based on 47 reviews, indicating "generally positive reviews".&lt;ref name="MC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lee Daniels' The Butler|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/lee-daniels-the-butler|publisher=Metacritic|accessdate=August 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical accuracy===
Regarding historical accuracy, Eliana Dockterman wrote in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'': "Allen was born on a [[Virginia]] plantation in 1919, not in Georgia.... In the movie, Cecil Gaines grows up on a cotton field in Macon, where his family comes into conflict with the white farmers for whom they work. What befalls his parents on the cotton field was [[Stereotypes of African Americans|added for dramatic effect]].... Though tension between father and son over civil rights issues fuels most of the drama in the film, [Eugene Allen's son] Charles Allen was not the radical political activist that Gaines's son is in the movie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dockterman |first=Eliana |title=The True Story of The Butler: Fact vs. Fiction in Lee Daniels' The Butler |url=http://entertainment.time.com/2013/08/16/what-the-butler-really-saw/ |newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=August 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Particular criticism has been directed at the film's accuracy in portraying President [[Ronald Reagan]]. While Alan Rickman's performance generated positive reviews, the director and screenwriters of the film have been criticized for depicting Reagan as indifferent to civil rights and his reluctance to associate with the White House's black employees during his presidency. According to [[Michael Reagan]], the former president's son, "The real story of the White House butler doesn't imply racism at all. It's simply Hollywood liberals wanting to believe something about my father that was never there."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bond|first=Paul|title=President Reagan's Son Attacks 'Lee Daniels' The Butler'|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/president-reagans-son-attacks-lee-614568 |accessdate=August 28, 2013|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=August 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/aug/29/the-butler-ronald-reagan-not-racist|publisher=The Guardian|title=The Butler falsely portrays Ronald Reagan as racist, says son|date=August 29, 2013|accessdate=September 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Newsmax|title=The Butler from Another Planet|url=http://www.newsmax.com/Reagan/Butler-Reagan-Oprah-Allen/2013/08/22/id/521814|date=August 27, 2013|first=Michael|last=Reagan|accessdate=December 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Kengor]], one of President Reagan's biographers, also attacked the film, saying, "I've talked to many White House staff, cooks, housekeepers, doctors, and Secret Service over the years. They are universal in their love of Ronald Reagan." In regard to the president's initial opposition to sanctions against [[apartheid]] in South Africa, Kengor said, "Ronald Reagan was appalled by apartheid, but also wanted to ensure that if the apartheid regime collapsed in South Africa that it wasn't replaced by a Marxist-totalitarian regime allied with Moscow and Cuba that would take the South African people down the same road as Ethiopia, Mozambique, and, yes, Cuba. In the immediate years before Reagan became president, 11 countries from the Third World, from Asia to Africa to Latin America, went Communist. It was devastating. If the film refuses to deal with this issue with the necessary balance, it shouldn't deal with it at all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/lee-daniels-butler-reagan-biographers-608233|title=Lee Daniels' 'The Butler': Reagan Biographers Slam President's Portrayal|work=The Hollywood Reporter.com|date=August 16, 2013|accessdate=September 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Execution of Lady Jane Grey''''' is an oil painting by [[Paul Delaroche]], completed in 1833, which is now in the [[National Gallery (London)|National Gallery]] in London (in 2018 on loan to an exhibition in Houston).  It was enormously popular in the decades after it was painted, but in the 20th century realist historical paintings fell from critical favour and it was kept in storage for many decades, for much of which it was thought lost.  Restored and displayed again since 1975, it immediately once again became a highly popular work, especially with younger visitors.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Tim, [http://www.newstatesman.com/art/2010/03/delaroche-painting-tudor-jane "How Tudorphilia rescued Delaroche"], in ''[[New Statesman]]''&lt;/ref&gt; 

The painting portrays, erroneously in some regards, the moments preceding the death of [[Lady Jane Grey]], who on 10 July 1553 was proclaimed [[Monarch of England|Queen of England]], only to be deposed nine days later and executed in 1554. Jane is sometimes referred to as the "Nine Days' Queen" due to the brevity of her reign.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.hrp.org.uk/Resources/Lady%20Jane%20Grey.pdf|format=PDF|title=Factsheet: Lady Jane Grey, Nine Days Queen|publisher=''Tower of London''.

==Subject==
{{main|Lady Jane Grey}}
Lady Jane Grey was the great-granddaughter of [[Henry VII of England]] and first cousin once removed to his grandson, the short-lived [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]]. After Edward's death she was proclaimed queen, being given precedence over [[Henry VIII]]'s daughters, [[Mary I of England|Mary Tudor]] and [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]]. Two weeks after the death of her brother, Mary, who had the support of the English people, claimed the throne, which Jane relinquished, having reigned for only nine days. Jane, her husband [[Lord Guilford Dudley]], and her father, were imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]] on charges of [[high treason]]. Jane's trial was conducted in November, but the death penalty handed to her was temporarily suspended. In February 1554, Jane's father, who had been released, was one of the rebel leaders in [[Wyatt's rebellion]]. On Friday 12 February, Mary had Jane, then aged 16, and her husband [[behead]]ed. Her father followed two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/grey_lady_jane.shtml|title=Historic Figures – Lady Jane Grey (1537–1554)|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=7 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==

Delaroche painted the subject of Lady Jane's execution in 1833, nearly 300 years after the event, drawing upon contemporary historical sources to help him portray it accurately. Delaroche had built his reputation in the Paris salon with large, realistic portrayals of famous events from the previous few centuries.&lt;ref name=4learning&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.channel4.com/learning/main/netnotes/sectionid100663638.htm|title=National Gallery, Programme 5|publisher=[[Channel 4]]|author=Ghislaine Kenyon|accessdate=4 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the artist's familiarity with the painting of historical narratives, there are aspects of the painting which are inaccurate.

[[File:Delaroche Jane Grey Detail.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.0|Detail]]
The painting depicts the moment that Jane, blindfolded, is being assisted to lay her head upon the block for the executioner. Her outstretched hand reaches uncertainly down to find the block. She is being assisted by a man who is identified as [[John Brydges, 1st Baron Chandos]]. Chandos was a Lieutenant of the Tower at the time of Jane's execution.&lt;ref name=NatGal&gt;{{citeweb| title =The Execution of Lady Jane Grey| publisher =[[National Gallery, London]]| url =http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=ng1909| accessdate =7 September 2008| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20090507120243/http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=ng1909| archivedate =7 May 2009| df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; While imprisoned in the Tower, Jane was attended by [[Lady-in-waiting|ladies in waiting]], one of whom was the [[nursemaid]] of her infancy. Two ladies in waiting are depicted in the painting, showing their grief at the event which is about to take place.

The execution actually was conducted in the open air, in a part of the grounds of the [[Tower of London]] that is known as [[Tower Green]], and where Henry VIII's wives [[Anne Boleyn]] and [[Catherine Howard]] had been executed. The painting indicates either that Delaroche was not familiar with this aspect of the event and has constructed the location according to his historical knowledge of other such events, or that he chose to take a great deal of [[artistic license]].

In the picture, the execution is taking place upon a raised wooden platform similar to those on which executions of royalty and nobility had taken place in the [[French Revolution]]. The edge of this platform can be seen, draped with a black cloth, across the foreground of the picture. At the rear of the pictorial space the handrail of stairs descends, and the tops of two weapons indicate the presence of guards. Delaroche was presumably aware that the Tower of London was founded by [[William of Normandy]]. In the painting, two stout [[Norman architecture|Norman]] columns with cushion capitals, a blind arcade, and a large chevroned arch create a backdrop indicative of the antiquity of the site. However, the buildings within the Tower of London span the reigns of many monarchs. In fact, the execution took place outside the [[Church of St Peter ad Vincula|Chapel of St Peter ad Vincula]], which was constructed not at the time of William the Conqueror but by order of Henry VIII, and therefore in a style postdating that of the architecture in the painting by nearly 500 years.

It is difficult to ascertain by the setting and the lighting whether it was the artist's intention to create the impression that the scene was taking place outside a building or in an interior. The architectural features shown can occur on both interiors and exteriors of Norman buildings. The darkness of the upper part of the painting is suggestive of an interior, while the light that bathes the central figure is daylight. Ghislaine Kenyon, Head of Education at the National Gallery, commented on the sense of foreboding that the darkness was intended to create.&lt;ref name=4learning/&gt;

The intensely dark areas that occupy a large proportion of the painting's surface play a big part in the drama. Not only is the shadow of the upper section of the painting black, so also are the cloth that covers the platform, the dress of one of the ladies, the cloak of Baron Chandos and the sleeves of the executioner. Three garments form accents of warm colour, the brown dress of one of the ladies, the orange fur of the Lieutenant's collar and the blood-red hose of the executioner. The colour of Lady Jane's red-gold hair is picked up in the straw beneath the block. Against the darkness, Lady Jane, with her pallid flesh, her white bodice and satin petticoat, makes a splash of light. The artist seizes the eye of the viewer by placing the most intense patches of white on Jane's blindfold and the area of her skirt just between her outstretched hand and the sharply defined edge of the block.

Delaroche has used many small details in telling the story and increasing the dramatic and emotive quality of the painting. The figures play their parts like actors through the expressions and gestures of grief and despair of the two women, the almost fatherly tenderness with which the Lieutenant of the Tower assists the blindfolded girl to take up the required position and the displeasure in the face of the executioner at the task that confronts him. Other narrative details include the rings on the block with the ropes which lash it steady to the floor, and the well-honed but well-worn edge to the axe. Kenyon points out that the clean straw, commonly placed near the site of an execution to soak up blood,&lt;ref name=NatGal/&gt; and the white dress were devices used by the artist to make the observer suppose what would happen to them next.&lt;ref name=4learning/&gt;

==Provenance==
The painting was made after the [[July Revolution]] of 1830 which deposed [[Charles X of France]], the last of the French Bourbon monarchs. Charles X's brother was [[Louis XVI of France]] whose throne was usurped and who was executed during the [[French Revolution]]. It is also redolent of the execution of [[Marie-Antoinette]]. Unsurprisingly, the emotive painting caused something of a sensation.&lt;ref name=NatGal/&gt; The painting was highly popular in the Paris salon when it was first exhibited there in 1834.&lt;ref name=4learning/&gt;

It was originally bought by [[Anatole Demidov]], 1st Prince of San Donato as part of the [[Demidov collection]]. From there it passed in 1870 to [[Henry Eaton, 1st Baron Cheylesmore]] after whose death in 1891 it realised £1,575 (lot 78) at his sale at [[Christie's]] the next year, less than a quarter of the price of the star of the sale, [[Monarch of the Glen (painting)|''The Monarch of the Glen'']] (lot 42, £7,245) by Sir [[Edwin Landseer]], one of the most popular paintings of the age.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christie's]], ''Catalogue of the important collection of modern pictures and sculpture formed by the late Rt. Hon. Lord Cheylesmore'', auction catalogue, London, 7 May 1892, [https://archive.org/details/imsculpt00chri online copy with prices realized added by hand]&lt;/ref&gt; It was bought by his son, [[William Eaton, 2nd Baron Cheylesmore]], who bequeathed it to the [[National Gallery, London]] in 1902, with four other paintings, including two other Landseers from his father's collection.&lt;ref&gt;Antony Griffiths (ed), ''Landmarks in Print Collecting – Connoisseurs and Donors at the British Museum since 1753'', 1996, British Museum Press, {{ISBN|0714126098}}, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was thought to have been destroyed in the disastrous Tate Gallery flood of 1928 during the [[1928 Thames flood]], and was only rediscovered in 1973 by Tate Gallery curator Christopher Johnstone. He was writing a book on the British painter [[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]] and going through the damaged canvases remaining from the flood in search of a missing painting by the artist. He found Martin's ''[[The Destruction of Pompeii and Herculaneum]]'', albeit in very poor condition, rolled inside the Delaroche painting which was in perfect condition and transferred to the National Gallery where it should have gone when the national art collections were rationalised following the establishment of the Tate.

In April 1885, Vincent wrote his brother about his first masterpiece, ''[[The Potato Eaters]]''. He was currently working on the painting, which was to become one of his first complex compositions with multiple figures, and illustrated the letter with a sketch of the work, writing "See, this is what the composition has now become. I’ve painted it on a fairly large canvas, and as the sketch is now, I believe there’s life in it."]] {{Italic title}}'''''The Letters of Vincent van Gogh''''' refers to a collection of 903 surviving letters written (820) or received (83) by [[Vincent van Gogh]].&lt;ref name = "VGoverview"&gt;[http://vangoghletters.org/vg/overview.html "Overview of all the letters"].

Vincent's sister-in-law and wife to his brother Theo, [[Johanna van Gogh-Bonger]],  spent many years after her husband's death in 1891 compiling the letters, which were first published in 1914. [[Arnold Pomerans]], &lt;!-- Arnold Pomerans was a noted and very influential British translator who specialized especially in the Dutch language https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/arnold-j-pomerans-6144212.html.

Editing: "van Gogh scholar and editor of the 1996 ''The Letters of Vincent van Gogh''--&gt; editor of a 1966 selection of the letters, wrote that Theo "was the kind of man who saved even the smallest scrap of paper", and it is to this trait that the public owes the 663 letters from Vincent.

Indeed, the only period where the public is relatively uninformed is the Parisian period when they shared an apartment and had no need to correspond. &lt;!-- Pomerans introduces the Goncourt comparison (not his) but effectively dismisses it as weighty. Editing :"Moreover, Pomerans believes that the brothers modeled themselves after the [[Goncourt brothers|de Goncourt]] brothers and that they likely knew the letters were of literary significance. As a whole, the letters represent a unified work of art the two brothers created together." --&gt;The letters effectively play much the same role in shedding light on the art of the period as those between the [[Goncourt brothers|de Goncourt]] brothers did for literature.&lt;ref name = "Pxviff"&gt;Pomerans (1997), xv–xvii&lt;/ref&gt;

Theo van Gogh's wife, [[Johanna van Gogh-Bonger]], devoted many years to compiling the letters about which she wrote: "When as Theo's young wife I entered in 1889, our flat in the Cité Pigalle in Paris, I found at the bottom of a small desk a drawer full of letters from Vincent".&lt;ref name = "Pxiii"/&gt; Within two years both brothers were dead: Vincent as the result of a gunshot wound, and Theo from illness.  Joanna began the task of completing the collection, which was published in full in January 1914.&lt;ref name = "Pxiii"/&gt; That first edition consisted of three volumes, and was followed in 1952–1954 by a four-volume edition that included additional letters. [[Jan Hulsker]] suggested, in 1987, that the letters be organized in date order, and undertaking that began in when 1994 the Van Gogh Letter Project was initiated by the Van Gogh Museum. The project consists of a complete annotated collection of letters written by and to Vincent.&lt;ref name = "VGletterwriter"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Publication history: The first collected edition of 1952-1954 and thereafter |url=http://vangoghletters.org/vg/publications_5.html |accessdate=March 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exhibition and early publication===
In the last days of December 1901, running through January 1902, [[Bruno Cassirer]] and his cousin [[Paul Cassirer]] organized the first van Gogh exhibition in [[Berlin, Germany]]. Paul Cassirer first established a market for van Gogh, and then, with the assistance of [[Johanna van Gogh-Bonger]], controlled market prices. In 1906 Bruno Cassirer published a small volume of selected letters of Vincent's to Theo van Gogh, translated into German.&lt;ref&gt;The date 1908 proposed in ''The posthumous fate of Vincent van Gogh 1890–1970'', by [[John Rewald]], (first published in ''Museumjournaal,'' August–September 1970), ''John Rewald Studies in [[Post-Impressionism]]'', p. 248, published by Abrams 1986, {{ISBN|0-8109-1632-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The letters==
Of the 844 surviving letters that van Gogh wrote, 663 were written to Theo, 9 to Theo and Jo. Of the letters Vincent received from Theo, only 39 survive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letter_writer_1.html "Van Gogh as Writer"] Retrieved December 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The first letter was written when Vincent was 19 and begins, "My dear Theo". At that time Vincent was not yet developed as a letter writer – he was factual, but not introspective. When he moved to London, and later to Paris, he began to add more personal information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letter_writer_2.html "The Earliest Letters"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1888 and ending a year later, van Gogh wrote 22 letters to Émile Bernard in which the tone is different from those to Theo. In these letters, van Gogh wrote more about his techniques, his use of color, and his theories.&lt;!-- eplace 'theories', awful word --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lubow, Arthur. "Letters from Vincent". ''Smithsonian''. Volume 38, Issue 10. (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

===The letters as literature===
Van Gogh was an avid reader, and his letters reflect his literary pursuits as well as a uniquely authentic literary style.&lt;ref name = "Pxviff"/&gt; His writing style in the letters reflects the literature he read and valued: [[Honoré de Balzac|Balzac]], historians such as [[Jules Michelet|Michelet]], and naturalists such as [[Émile Zola|Zola]], [[Voltaire]] and [[Gustave Flaubert|Flaubert]].&lt;ref&gt;Pomerans (1997), xx&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally he read novels written by [[George Eliot]], [[Charlotte Brontë]], [[Charles Dickens]], [[John Keats|Keats]]' poetry, reading mostly at night when the light was too poor for painting. [[Paul Gauguin|Gauguin]] told him "that he read too much".&lt;ref name="Drabble"&gt;{{cite web|last=Drabble|first=Margaret|title=Dutch Courage|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/art/2010/01/van-gogh-vincent-letters-work|publisher=[[New Statesman]]|date= 18 January 2010|accessdate=4 March 2012|archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6Lqf9KIi8|archivedate= 14 December 2013|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Gogh scholar Jan Hulsker wrote of van Gogh's letters, "Vincent was able to express himself splendidly, and it is this remarkable writing talent that has secured the letters their lasting place in world literature". Poet [[W. H. Auden]] wrote about the letters, "there is scarcely one letter by van Gogh which I&amp;nbsp;... do not find fascinating".&lt;ref name = "VGletterwriter"/&gt; Pomerans believes the letters to be on the level of "world literature" based on style and the ability to express himself.  In the letters Vincent reflects different facets of his personality and he adopts a tone specific to his circumstances. At the time he went through a stage of religious fanaticism, his letters fully reflect his thoughts; at the time he was involved with [[Sien (Van Gogh series)|Sien Hoornik]] his letters reflect his feelings.&lt;ref name = "Pxviff"/&gt;

===The letters as chronicle of an artist's life===
Van Gogh's letters paint a chronicle of an artist's life, with the notable omission of the period when he lived in Paris and therefore had no need to correspond with his brother.&lt;ref name = "Pxviff"/&gt;  The letters can be read as an autobiography of an artist; time spent in [[Province of Brabant|Brabant]], Paris and London, [[The Hague]], [[Drenthe]], [[Nuenen]], [[Antwerp]], [[Arles]], [[Saint-Rémy-de-Provence|Saint-Remy]] and [[Auvers-sur-Oise|Auvers]]  chronicle his corporal travels as well as his artistic growth.&lt;ref&gt;Pomerans (1997), xxiii&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes Vincent wrote Theo every day—beyond the need to acknowledge financial support, describing England and  the Netherlands. He included in the letters sketches of common people such as miners and farmers for he believed the poor would inherit the earth.&lt;ref name = "Drabble"/&gt; Van Gogh's spiritual and theological thought and convictions are revealed in his letters throughout his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=Cliff|title=Van Gogh and God : a creative spiritual quest|date=1989|publisher=Loyola University Press|location=Chicago, Ill.|isbn=0-8294-0621-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

For much of his adult life he was lonely and pushed to learn as much as he could about the world around and about his craft. [[Margaret Drabble]] describes the letters from Drenthe as "heart-breaking", as he struggled to come to terms with the "darkness of his hereditary subject matter", the bleak poverty and meanness of Dutch peasant life. This struggle culminated with his painting ''[[The Potato Eaters]]''. His friend and mentor Van Rappard disliked the painting. Undeterred, van Gogh moved south, via Antwerp and Paris. His letters from Arles describe his [[utopia]]n dream of establishing a community of artists who lived together, worked together, and helped each other. In this project he was joined by Paul Gauguin in late 1888.&lt;ref name = "Drabble"/&gt;

=== Autograph of letter 716 ===
[[File:Vincent van Gogh and Paul Gauguin - Letter VGM 716.jpg|thumb|center|x150px|Letter 716: Vincent van Gogh and Paul Gauguin to Emile Bernard. Arles, Thursday, 1 or Friday, 2 November 1888]]

Letter 716 is  a letter sent jointly by Vincent van Gogh and Paul Gauguin to Émile Bernard around 1 November 1888 shortly after Gauguin had joined van Gogh in [[Arles]].  Late that summer, van Gogh had completed his second group of ''[[Sunflowers (Van Gogh series)|Sunflower]]'' paintings, amongst his most iconic paintings, two of which decorated Gauguin's room, as well as his famous painting ''[[The Yellow House]]'' depicting the house they shared.

The letter is unique in being a joint letter from the two, and can be read in both the original French and an English translation at the website of the [[Van Gogh Museum]]'s edition of the letters.&lt;ref name= "Letter 716" group= "Letters"&gt;{{cite web|title= 716 Vincent van Gogh and Paul Gauguin to Emile Bernard. Arles, Thursday, 1 or Friday, 2 November 1888|url= http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let716/letter.html|work= Vincent van Gogh: The Letters|publisher=[[Van Gogh Museum]]|at= 1|quote= Next, I don’t think it will astonish you greatly if I tell you that our discussions are tending to deal with the terrific subject of an association of certain painters. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In it they discuss, amongst other matters, their plans to form an artists' commune, possibly abroad. In reality their relationship was always fraught, and by the end of the year they had parted for good, van Gogh himself hospitalised following a breakdown in which he had mutilated one of his ears.

'''''The Stories of Vladimir Nabokov''''' (in some British editions, '''''The Collected Stories''''') is a posthumous collection of every known short story that [[Vladimir Nabokov]] ever wrote, with the exception of "[[The Enchanter]]". The thirteen stories not previously published in English are translated by the author's son, [[Dmitri Nabokov]]. The collection was first published in America by [[Alfred A. Knopf]] in 1995.

The collection includes 65 stories (including one that was long considered lost, but discovered shortly before the latest edition of the volume).

'''''The Terrace''''' is a 1909 landscape painting by [[Milly Childers]] showing the members' terrace of the [[Palace of Westminster]] with its view of the [[Thames]] looking towards [[Lambeth Bridge]]. 

The people on the terrace are, not surprisingly, all men. In their relaxed poses the painting seems to give more of a general impression of a men's club, which the [[House of Commons]] still was in 1909. On closer inspection contemporary viewers may have seen more than just an old boys' network in action. The central figures are [[Sir John Benjamin Stone]], who took a photograph of Childers with her painting. He appears to be giving a photograph to Sir Henry David Erskine, the Serjeant-at-Arms who had been responsible for removing the suffragettes Helen Fox and [[Muriel Matters]] who had chained themselves to the grilles of the ladies gallery of the [[House of Commons]] on 28 October 1908.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/item/rbcmiller001253/ Suffragettes Rush the House of Commons], Library of Congress archives&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/evolutionofparliament/parliamentwork/offices-and-ceremonies/collections/serjeant-at-arms/portrait-of-sir-henry-david-erskine/ Comments on the portrait of Sir Henry David Erskine] in the Parliamentary Art Collection&lt;/ref&gt; The man leaning against the balustrade and looking at the painter was the Labor Party leader [[Keir Hardie]], a friend of the suffragette [[Emmeline Pankhurst]].

'''''Things the Grandchildren Should Know''''' is an [[autobiography]] by [[Mark Oliver Everett]], the front man of the [[independent music|independent rock band]] [[Eels (band)|Eels]]. Everett spent a year writing the book&lt;ref name="dfb"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tinymixtapes.com/Eels,8964 |title=Eels "If you’re going to boo somebody, you better know who you’re booing, bitch."  |publisher=Tiny Mix Tapes |date=May 2009 |accessdate=2009-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; between the release of the retrospectives ''[[Meet The Eels: Essential Eels, Vol. 1 (1996–2006)]]'' and ''[[Useless Trinkets: B-Sides, Soundtracks, Rarities and Unreleased 1996–2006]]'' and the composition of 2009's ''[[Hombre Lobo]].''

==Title==
The book shares its title with the closing track from the Eels' 2005 album ''[[Blinking Lights and Other Revelations]].'' In that song Everett takes on the [[persona]] of an elderly grandfather sharing the wisdom he has learned about life shortly before his death. The parallels between the song and the book are loose, as Everett is much younger than his song persona. He remarks in the final chapter the irony of the title given that he has no children, let alone grandchildren. The German edition's title “Glückstage in der Hölle”&lt;ref&gt;JohnDoe: [http://www.tcboyle.de/wordpress/?p=256 Mark Oliver Everett: Glückstage in der Hölle], review (German)&lt;/ref&gt; translates to "Lucky days in hell", resembling the name of the Eels' song ''[[Your Lucky Day in Hell]].''

==Marketing==
Unusually for a modern autobiography, neither inside the book nor the cover (first edition) includes photos of the author. Likewise, the cover refers to Everett's full name, rather the better-known moniker '''E'''. The front and back cover avoid referring to his status as the front man of the Eels. Readings of portions of the text occurred during live sets during the 2008 Eels tour. Eels guitarist [[Jeff Lyster|The Chet]] would later read the [[audiobook]] edition.

==Reception==
''Things the Grandchildren Should Know'' received generally positive reviews from critics from the United States—such as [[Joel Stein]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''&lt;ref name="official"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.eelstheband.com/grandchildren.php |title=Eels: Official band website |publisher=[[Mark Oliver Everett]] |accessdate=2009-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;—as well as British press—including ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/feb/09/featuresreviews.guardianreview9|title=Lives less ordinary|first=Claire|last=Armitstead|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=2008-02-09|accessdate=2009-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Independent]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/things-the-grandchildren-should-know-by-mark-oliver-everett-773529.html|title=Things the Grandchildren Should Know, By Mark Oliver Everett
|first=Charles Shaar|last=Murray|publisher=''[[The Independent]]''|date=2008-01-25|accessdate=2009-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antonia Quirke]], writing for ''[[The Times]]'' claims that Everett "[P]icks the right stories to tell. A rare skill in the writers of memoirs," and sums up the book as "a subtle, touching thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/non-fiction/article3159966.ece|title=Things the Grandchildren Should Know by Mark Oliver Everett|first=Antonia|last=Quirke|publisher=''[[The Times]]''|date=2008-01-13 |accessdate=2009-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pete Townshend]]'s cover blurb calls it "[O]ne of the best books ever written by a contemporary artist." Everett's hometown press considered it "intellectual, wry and unflinching as it conveys complex emotions with simple, graceful language."&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/oct/19/entertainment/ca-eels19 |title=Mark Everett – E of Eels – unravels why his dad was so pained |author=Geoff Boucher |publisher=''[[L. A. Times]]'' |date=2008-10-19 |accessdate=2009-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius|a heartbreaking story of staggering genius]]."&lt;ref name="laweekly"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.laweekly.com/2008-10-23/calendar/you-thought-your-childhood-was-rotten/ |title= You Thought Your Childhood Was Rotten |author=Libby Molyneaux |publisher=''[[LA Weekly]]'' |date=2009-10-21 |accessdate=2009-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book also received reviews from music publications, such as ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]],'' who considered the author "a clear-eyed and emotionally affecting writer"&lt;ref name="spin"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://new.music.yahoo.com/blogs/spin/3581/es-the-man/ |title=E's the Man |publisher=''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' via [[Yahoo! Music]] |date=2008-11-03 |accessdate=2009-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]],'' who gave it four out of five stars.&lt;ref name="official" /&gt;

==Publication history==
After the initial British pressing, the book was released in the United States by [[Thomas Dunne Books]] and [[St. Martin's Press]] on October 14, 2008 ({{ISBN|978-0-312-38513-2}}). An audio edition of this book was released on [[cassette tape]], [[CD-ROM]], and [[Compact Disc]] by [[Blackstone Audio]] on November 30, 2008.

==="The Face In the Window" by [[Heather Graham Pozzessere|Heather Graham]]===
A dangerous storm rips through Florida, where an evacuation notice has been spread throughout part of the state. Beth Henson, a woman whose husband, Keith has been sent to rescue an elderly woman, stays in her house during the evacuation progress. A man stumbles in seeking shelter, but Beth suspects that he is a serial killer. Keith enters the elderly woman's home, only to find that she is unconscious inside the trunk of her car. A youth found around the woman's house claims to be her nephew; Keith also suspects that he is a serial killer. Back in the house, Beth attacks her guest with a frying pan. She flees to the shed where the youth catches her, holding a knife to her neck. Keith arrives at the house and whilst searching for the youth, bumps into the man who was hit by a frying pan. Keith locks him in a room and exits to the shed. The three enter the house where the man ambushes them and takes Beth hostage.

==="Empathy" by [[James Siegel]]===
The author, whose name is unmentioned, has an affair with a hotel masseuse, Kelly. Kelly tells him she is an empath, someone who can sense one's emotions by touch. She also tells him of a man in whom she sensed a very strong evil, and that the man is a pedophile. The author is very moved, because he feels responsible for his younger brother's suicide, because the narrator had not said anything about the pedophile priest who, it is implied, abused both of them. He seeks out the man Kelly mentioned, and after killing him, meets with a friend of Kelly's, who informs the narrator that Kelly was divorced, was a drug addict, and had poisoned her son against his father. The narrator, realizing he had killed Kelly's innocent ex-husband, set out to kill Kelly and avenge the man he had wrongfully killed. In the end it is implied that the author commits suicide.

==="Kowalski's In Love" by [[James Rollins]]===
Seaman Joe Kowalski swims onto a small island after his boat is accidentally blown up by a gas leak. He is met by Dr. Shay Rosauro, who informs him that the island is infected with a [[transgenic rhabdovirus]] and is scheduled to be bombed by the Brazilian Navy at 0900 hours—in less than half an hour. Shay had entered the island to retrieve the only antidotes to the virus; an evac helicopter  will pick her up at 0855 hours. However, the island is scattered with booby traps, and it isn't long until Shay falls into one, breaking her leg. Kowalski offers to retrieve the antidotes himself, whilst Shay makes for the evac dropsite. Shay reluctantly agrees but becomes treed by apes on her way. Kowalski encounters Gabriella Salazar, who has already collected the antidotes. Kowalski shoots and killed Gabriella in self-defense and retrieves the antidotes. Kowalski could escape on the evac chopper, but opts not to, as it will lift off the island on schedule, with or without Shay. Kowalski rescues Shay, and they escape on the water vehicle that was meant for Gabriella.

==="The Hunt For Dmitri" by [[Gayle Lynds]]===
Dmitri Garnitsky is on the hitlist of a professional assassin, the Carnivore, who has a reputation for never failing. After being tipped off, Dmitri leaves his home, but he is met by the Carnivore, and later Oleg Olenkov, the man who hired the Carnivore. The Carnivore is angered by Olenkov's demands and shoots him in the chest, leaving Dmitri unharmed. Many years later, Olenkov catches up with the Carnivore's daughter, Liz Sansborough, a psychologist. Masquerading as "Arkady Albam", Olenkov befriends Sansborough, lures her to his apartment, and tells her a false story of how he got shot. He ultimately reveals himself to be Olenkov, and moments later Dmitri enters the apartment, shocked that his attempted killer is there. The three of them engage in a violent struggle, resulting in one of their being rendered unconscious and harmless.

==="Disfigured" by [[Michael Palmer (novelist)|Michael Palmer]] &amp; [[Daniel Palmer (writer)|Daniel Palmer]]===
Dr. George Hill and his ex-wife Maura Hill receive a letter that their son has been kidnapped; if they want to see him alive again, George must inject [[isopropyl alcohol]] in the face of his celebrity client, Audra Meadows, during surgery, disfiguring her permanently. Maura sneaks into the Meadows' household, hoping to rescue her son. After witnessing Audra being verbally abused and then raped by her husband, Alec, Maura searches the house without success. Maura visits another property, this one owned by A.R. Meadows, only to find the property is owned by ''Ambrose'' Meadows. Maura then goes in search of Dr. Simon Rubenstein, the psychiatrist who had prescribed Audra's pills. Maura then discovers that Audra had threatened Maura's son's life herself, unbeknownst to Alec, believing that if she were disfigured, Alec would reject her, and then she'd be free from his mental and sexual abuse. Just before the surgery, Maura and Dr. Rubenstein confront Audra.

A year later, Fisher befriends a man known as Farting Dan. Whilst robbing an equipage, Weaver kills Dan, but is shot by Fisher. Fisher returns home with the equipage's horseman, Phillip, trying to get him to pick a valuable lock. Phillip revealed himself to be Weaver, and that in their encounter a year ago Fisher had mistaken Lane for Weaver and vice versa.

'''''Travesti''''' (literally "disguised" in French) is a theatrical term referring to the portrayal of a character in an [[opera]], [[Play (theatre)|play]], or [[ballet]] by a performer of the opposite sex.  Depending on sources, the term may be given as '''travesty''',&lt;ref&gt;*Budden, Julian (1992), 'Travesty' in ''The [[New Grove Dictionary of Opera]]'', p 799&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Anne Hermann|title=Travesty and Transgression: Transvestism in Shakespeare, Brecht, and Churchill|journal=Theatre Journal|year=1989|volume=41|issue=2|pages=133–154|doi=10.2307/3207855|url=http://jstor.org/stable/3207855|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''''travesti''''',&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Kennedy (music critic)|Kennedy, Michael]] (2006), ''The Oxford Dictionary of Music'', p 899&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;*Warrack, John and West, Ewan (1992), ''The Oxford Dictionary of Opera'', p 716&lt;/ref&gt; or '''''en travesti'''''. The ''Oxford Essential Dictionary of Foreign Terms in English'' explains the origin of the latter term as "pseudo-[[French language|French]]",&lt;ref&gt;According to Speake and LaFlaur (1999), the phrase itself is not recorded in French, and derives from the misinterpretation of ''travesti'' (the [[past participle]] of the French verb ''travestir'') as a noun.&lt;/ref&gt; although French sources from the mid-19th century have used the term, e.g. ''Bibliothèque musicale du Théâtre de l'opéra'' (1876),  ''La revue des deux mondes '' (1868), and have continued the practice into the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example Duron (2008) p. 231 and Coste (2004) pp. 26 and 141&lt;/ref&gt;

For social reasons, female roles were played by boys or men in many early forms of theatre, and ''travesti'' roles continued to be used in several types of context even after actresses became accepted on the stage. The popular British theatrical form of the [[pantomime]] traditionally contains a role for a "[[principal boy]]", a [[breeches role]] played by a young woman, and also one or more [[pantomime dame]]s, female comic roles played by men.  Similarly, in the formerly popular genre of [[Victorian burlesque]], there were usually one or more breeches roles.

==Men in female roles==
[[File:Farinelli female caricature edited.jpg|thumb|170 px|left|The famous castrato [[Farinelli]] caricatured in one of his female roles]]
Until the late 17th century in England and the early 19th century in the [[Papal States]]—although not elsewhere in Europe—women were conventionally portrayed by male actors (usually adolescents) in [[drag (clothing)|drag]] because the presence of actual women on stage was considered immoral.

===In theatre===
As a [[boy player]], [[Alexander Cooke]] is thought to have created many of Shakespeare's principal female roles, as well as [[Agrippina the Elder|Agrippina]] in [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''[[Sejanus His Fall]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[F. E. Halliday]], ''A Shakespeare Companion 1564-1964'', Baltimore, Penguin, 1964; pp. 114-15.&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration of the monarchy]] in 1660, women began to appear on the English stage, although some female roles continued to be played by boys and young men, including romantic leads. [[Edward Kynaston]], whose roles included the title role in Ben Jonson's ''[[Epicoene, or the Silent Woman|Epicoene]]'' and Evadne in [[Francis Beaumont|Beaumont]] and [[John Fletcher (playwright)|Fletcher's]] ''[[The Maid's Tragedy]]'', was one of the last of the era's boy players.&lt;ref&gt;Howe (1992) p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

London's [[Shakespeare's Globe]] theatre, a modern reconstruction of the original [[Globe Theatre]], continues the practice of casting men in female Shakespearean roles. Toby Cockerell played Katherine of France in the theatre's opening production of ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'' in 1997,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/audience-plays-its-part-in-shakespeares-wooden-o-1254497.html "Audience plays its part in Shakespeare's wooden O"]. ''[[The Independent]]'',  7 June 1997&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Mark Rylance]] played Cleopatra in the 1999 production of ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/264171.stm "Meet Mr Cleopatra"]. [[BBC News]], 27 January 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

''Travesti'' roles for men are still to be found in British [[pantomime]], where there is at least one humorous (and usually older) female character traditionally played by a male actor, the [[pantomime dame]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2005/12/14/btpanto14.xml&amp;sSheet=/arts/2005/12/14/ixartleft.html "Panto's merriest widow"]. ''The Telegraph'', 14 December 2005, accessed 7 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===In opera===
[[Castrato|Castrati]], adult males with a female singing voice (usually produced by castration before puberty), appeared in the earliest operas &amp;ndash; initially in female roles. In the first performance of [[Monteverdi]]'s ''[[L'Orfeo|Orfeo]]'' in 1607 the roles of [[Eurydice]] and [[Proserpina]] were both sung by castrati. However, by 1680 the castrati had become the predominant singers for leading male roles as well. The use of castrati for both male and female roles was particularly strong in the [[Papal States]], where women were forbidden from public stage performances until the 19th century.

An exception to this practice was in 17th and 18th century French opera where it was traditional to use uncastrated male voices both for the hero and for malevolent female divinities and spirits.&lt;ref&gt;Senelick (2000) p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Jean-Baptiste Lully|Lully]]'s 1686 opera ''[[Armide (Lully)|Armide]]'' the hero (Renaud) was sung by a [[haute-contre]] (a type of high [[tenor]] voice) while the female spirit of hatred (La Haine) was sung by a tenor. In [[Rameau]]'s 1733 ''[[Hippolyte et Aricie]]'', the hero ([[Hippolytus (mythology)|Hippolyte]]) was sung by an haute-contre, while the roles of the three [[Parcae|Fates]] and [[Tisiphone]] were scored for [[bass (voice type)|basses]] and tenors. The remaining female roles in both operas were sung by women. The title role of the vain but ugly marsh nymph in Rameau's ''[[Platée]]'' is also for an haute-contre.

Female roles in opera sung by men can still be found, although they are not common. The role of the witch in [[Engelbert Humperdinck (composer)|Humperdinck]]'s 1890 opera ''[[Hänsel und Gretel (opera)|Hänsel und Gretel]]'' was originally written for a [[mezzo-soprano]], but was sung by the tenor [[Philip Langridge]] in the [[Metropolitan Opera]]'s 2009 production directed by [[Richard Jones (director)|Richard Jones]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Metropolitan Opera]] (2009). [http://www.metoperafamily.org/metopera/news/interviews/detail.aspx?id=10678 "Sweet and Low-Down"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Azio Corghi]]'s 2005 opera ''Il dissoluto assolto'', which incorporates story elements from Mozart's ''[[Don Giovanni]]'', casts a [[counter-tenor]] in the role of the [[mannequin]] of Donna Elvira.&lt;ref&gt;Moiraghi, p. 324&lt;/ref&gt;

===In dance===
The portrayal of women by male dancers was very common in [[Renaissance]] court ballet&lt;ref&gt;Lee (2202) p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; and has continued into more modern times, although primarily restricted to comic or malevolent female characters. The use of male dancers for all the female roles in a ballet persisted well into the 18th century in the Papal States, when women dancers had long been taking these roles elsewhere in Italy. Abbé Jérôme Richard who travelled to Rome in 1762 wrote: "Female Dancers are not permitted on the stages in Rome. They substitute for them boys dressed as women and there is also a police ordinance that decreed they wear black bloomers."&lt;ref name = "HW38"&gt;quoted in Harris-Warrick (2005) p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Another French traveller that year, Joseph-Thomas, comte d'Espinchal, asked himself: "What impression can one have of ballet in which the prima ballerina is a young man in disguise with artificial feminine curves?"&lt;ref name = "HW38" /&gt;

In the original production of ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]]'' in 1890, a male dancer, [[Enrico Cecchetti]], created the role of the evil fairy Carabosse, although the role has subsequently been danced by both men and women.&lt;ref&gt;Brillarelli (1995) p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Frederick Ashton]]'s 1948 choreography of  ''[[Cinderella (Ashton)|Cinderella]]'', [[Robert Helpmann]] and Ashton himself danced the roles of the two stepsisters. [[Ben Stevenson (dancer)|Ben Stevenson]] later continued the practice of casting male dancers as the stepsisters in his own choreography of the ballet.&lt;ref&gt;Upper (2004) p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; Other female ballet characters traditionally performed by male dancers are Old Madge, the village sorceress in ''[[La Sylphide]]'' and the Widow Simone in ''[[La fille mal gardée]]''.

==Women in male roles==
[[File:Eugénie Fiocre as a matador.jpg|thumb|180 px|The ballerina [[Eugénie Fiocre]] as a [[matador]] circa 1860]]
With the [[English Restoration|Restoration of Charles II]] in 1660 women started appearing on the English stage, both in the female roles that in Shakespeare's day had been portrayed by men and boys, and in male roles. It has been estimated that of the 375 plays produced in London between 1660 and 1700, nearly a quarter contained one or more roles for actresses dressed as men.&lt;ref&gt;See Howe (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst the 19th century actresses who made a mark in ''travesti'' roles were [[Mary Anne Keeley]] who portrayed Smike in the stage adaptation of ''[[Nicholas Nickleby]]'' and the robber [[Jack Sheppard]] in [[John Baldwin Buckstone|Buckstone]]'s play based on his life; [[Maude Adams]] who played [[Peter and Wendy|Peter Pan]] in the American premiere of [[J. M. Barrie|Barrie]]'s play and went on to play the role over 1,500 times;&lt;ref&gt;Harbin, Marra, and Schanke (2005) p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sarah Bernhardt]] who created the role of [[Napoleon II of France]] in [[Edmond Rostand]]'s ''[[L'Aiglon]]'', played [[Lorenzino de' Medici]] in [[Alfred de Musset|Musset]]'s ''Lorenzaccio'', Pelléas in [[Maurice Maeterlinck|Maeterlinck]]'s ''[[Pelléas and Mélisande]]'' and perhaps most famously played the title role in ''[[Hamlet]]''. In the [[Victorian era]], [[Victorian burlesque|musical burlesques]] generally included several breeches roles.  According to the ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', although "an almost indispensable element of burlesque was the display of attractive women dressed in tights, often in travesty roles ... the plays themselves did not normally tend to indecency."&lt;ref&gt;[[Erich Schwandt|Schwandt, Erich]] et al. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/04381 "Burlesque",] ''Grove Music Online''. Oxford Music Online, accessed 3 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the specialists in these roles was [[Nellie Farren]] who created the title roles in numerous burlesques and pantomimes, including ''[[Robert the Devil (Gilbert)|Robert the Devil]]'', ''[[Little Jack Sheppard]]'' and ''[[Ruy Blas and the Blasé Roué]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Culme, John. [http://www.gabrielleray.150m.com/ArchiveTextF/NellieFarren.html Information "Nellie Farren (1848-1904) English burlesque actress"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091012233616/http://www.gabrielleray.150m.com/ArchiveTextF/NellieFarren.html |date=12 October 2009 }} at Footlight Notes, 2003, accessed 8 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  In British [[pantomime]], which is still regularly performed, the young male protagonist or [[Principal boy]] is traditionally played by an actress in boy's clothes.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2007) pp. 117 and ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of women performing ''en travesti'' in operas became increasingly common in the early 19th century as [[castrato]] singers went out of fashion and were replaced by [[mezzo-soprano]]s or [[contralto]]s in the young masculine roles. For example, the title role of [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]]'s 1813 ''[[Tancredi]]'' was specifically written for a female singer. However, ''travesti'' mezzo-sopranos had been used earlier by both [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]] and [[Mozart]], sometimes because a castrato was not available, or to portray a boy or very young man, such as Cherubino in ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]''. In 20th-century opera, composers continued to use women to sing the roles of young men, when they felt the mature tenor voice sounded wrong for the part. One notable example was [[Richard Strauss]], who used a mezzo-soprano for Octavian in ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]'' and the Composer in ''[[Ariadne auf Naxos]]''.

From 1830 to 1850, female ballet dancers were increasingly seen in the ''[[corps de ballet]]'' portraying [[matador]]s, [[hussar]]s, and cavaliers, and even as the [[prima ballerina]]'s 'leading man', a practice which was to last well into the 20th century in France.&lt;ref&gt;Garafola (1985) p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Although both [[Fanny Elssler]] and her sister Thérèse danced ''travesti'' roles at the Paris Opera, Thérèse, who was very tall by the standards of the day, danced them more frequently, often partnering Fanny as her leading man.&lt;ref&gt;Foster (1998) p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; The French ballerina [[Eugénie Fiocre]], who created the role of Franz in ''[[Coppélia]]'',  was particularly known for her ''travesti'' performances.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (1992) p. 257&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''unsigned artist''', '''unsigned band''' or '''independent artist''' is a [[musician]] or [[musical group]] not under a [[contract]] with a [[record label]]. The terms are used in the [[music industry]] as a [[marketing]] technique. Bands that release their own material on self-published CDs can also be considered unsigned bands. Often unsigned bands primarily exist to perform at concerts.

In more recent years, the Internet has helped promote the music of unsigned bands. Artists often post their music as [[MP3]]s on websites such as [[Bandcamp]], [[SoundCloud]], [[Myspace]], [[PureVolume]], [[GarageBand.com]] and [[SoundClick]].

In 2016, the [[Unsigned Music Awards]] was established in the UK as the first ever televised international awards ceremony to champion artists without the backing of a record label.

UK unsigned bands and musicians are able to use such services as [[The Unsigned Guide]] and to gather music industry contact names, phone numbers, websites and social media links, as well as information on how to get signed or market music independently.

Song pitching websites, such as [[TAXI (A&amp;R)|TAXI]] allow unsigned musicians to see which record labels (and other music companies) are currently seeking new music.

Further, companies like [[Sentric Music]] and the royalty payment service offered by [[Last.fm]] can help in generating income streams for unsigned bands.

==History and current scene==
Many unsigned artists used to sell their music and music-related merchandise without the financial support of a record label, while often seeking a recording contract through the recording of [[Demo (music)|demo]]s. Recently, the Internet has helped promote independent artistic material. Artists tend to post their music on websites such as [[MySpace]], and [[ILike]], and sometimes have their music played on podcast shows like [[Kooba Radio]].  In recent times, artists such as [[Nine Inch Nails]] and [[Radiohead]], who once had major label record deals, have started to release their music independently.

Various musicians remain independent in their beginning of their music career but later on get a [[record deal]] and continue as a signed musician.  But this concept changed when major artists such as [[The Eagles]] and [[Nine Inch Nails]] became independent and parted their ways with record labels such as [[Interscope]].

Many services are offered to independent musicians like [[Cdbaby]], [[Feiyr]], [[Nimbit]] and [[Tunecore]] by which the artists can retain the copyrights of their songs and also deliver their music to various stores including [[iTunes Store]], [[Amazon MP3]], [[Napster]], [[Spotify]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;

== Internet promotion ==

Internet promotion has been the key for some bands for getting popular. Bands like the [[Arctic Monkeys]], [[Owl City]], and solo artists like [[Lily Allen]] have gained popularity through Myspace, although the [[Arctic Monkeys]] did not even know what MySpace was, and claimed that fans made it for them.

Unsigned bands have become more popular with Internet users and have been able to break into the mainstream charts. They are now finding many resources across the Internet to promote, market, and sell their music almost free of charge.

Unsigned charts are now being promoted on almost all the underground music sites and has seen many of the domain owners spending large amounts of money on developing these charts to bring bands to them. A number of these are now additionally registered with the [[top 40|official charts]].

Blog sites have become popular, as they regularly feature reviews or interviews with unsigned artists. Other blog sites have offered helpful guidance and resources for new unsigned artists. Similar to bloggers, music curators including podcasts, DJs, and Youtube channels are all dedicated to finding quality new songs from unsigned artists for online audiences to discover.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pushpowerpromo.com/submit-music-to-these-places|title=Submit Music To These Places {{!}} Push Power Promo|website=www.pushpowerpromo.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The music promotion site, Feature.fm, has emerged to allow artists to promote their music natively directly inside music streaming services.

==Record labels==
Major record company [[Universal Music]] entered into a joint venture with Tunecore to distribute albums online on major stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/media/news/2009/07/universaltunecore-deal-opens-major-doors-for-indie-artists.ars|title=Universal/TuneCore deal opens major doors for indie artists|work=Ars Technica|access-date=2018-05-07|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The record labels which entered into venture are [[Interscope]](Interscope Digital Distribution), [[Universal Motown]] (Unimo Digital Distribution), [[Island Def Jam]] (IDJ FirstLook) and [[Universal Republic]] (Republic Digital Distribution).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://musiciancoaching.com/music-business/digital-distribution-music-2/|title=Digital music distribution {{!}} Music Consultant|website=musiciancoaching.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Island Def Jam Music Group partnered with Tunecore to launch IDJ Firstlook, a new web portal that provides unsigned artists with potential access to such coveted major label services as worldwide distribution and marketing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/66788/idj-firstlook-debuts|title=IDJ FirstLook Debuts|work=All Access|access-date=2018-05-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independent vanity record labels===
Artists can also create their own record labels and sell their music under the label's imprint as well. Services such as [[Nimbit]] gives facilities for independent musicians to release their music independently as well as under a record label create by artist itself. Other efforts made in this field include [[Magnatune]], an independent record label based in [[Berkeley, California]], [[United States]].

== Notable unsigned artists ==
Notable artists who have never been signed to a record label include [[Chance the Rapper]], [[Noname (rapper)]] and [[David Choi]].

'''Video design''' or '''projection design''' is a creative field of stagecraft. It is concerned with the creation and integration of film, motion graphics and live camera feed into the fields of [[theatre]], [[opera]], [[dance]], [[fashion shows]], [[concerts]] and other live events. Video design has only recently gained recognition as a separate creative field. Prior to this, the responsibilities of video design would often be taken on by a [[scenic designer]] or [[lighting designer]]. A person who practices the art of video design is often known as a '''Video Designer'''. However, naming conventions vary around the world, and so practitioners may also be credited as '''Projection Designer''', "Media Designer", '''[[Cinematographer]]''' or '''Video Director''' (amongst others). As a relatively new field of stagecraft, practitioners create their own definitions, rules and techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projctn.com/about-projection-design|title=About Projection Design  - Projctn|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

[[Filmmaking]] and [[video production]] content has been used in performance for many years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/18/theater/18mcelroy.html|title=Projection Design Comes of Age|first=Steven|last=Mcelroy|date=18 May 2008|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; as has large format [[slide projection]] delivered by systems such as the PANI projector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pani.com/unternehmen/daten/e_daten.html?english |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 14, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926111206/http://www.pani.com/unternehmen/daten/e_daten.html?english |archivedate=September 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The German [[Erwin Piscator]], as stage director at the Berlin [[Volksbühne]] in the 1920s, made extensive use of film projected onto his sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://myclone.wordpress.com/2010/01/28/field-guide-to-new-media-for-the-performing-arts/|title=Field Guide to New Media for the Performing Arts|first=David|last=Haden|date=28 January 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the development of digital projection technology in the mid 90s, and the resulting drop in price, made it more attractive and practical to live performance producers, directors and scenic designers. The role of the video designer has developed as a response to this, and in recognition of the demand in the industry for experienced professionals to handle the video content of a production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://livedesignonline.com/theatre/projection_designer_scenic_tony_award_0430/|title=Sunday In The Park Projection Designer Being Considered For Scenic Tony Award|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United Scenic Artists]]' Local 829, the Union representing [[Scenic Artists]] in the USA has included "Projection Designers" as of mid- 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usa829.org/News.aspx?ItemID=109|title=News|first=|last=USA829|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means anybody working in this field will be doing so officially as "Projection Designer" if he or she is working under a union contract, even if the design utilises technology other than [[video projectors]]. The term "Projection Designer" stems from the days when slide and film projectors were the primary source of projection and is now in wide use across North America.

[http://www.arts.ac.uk/wimbledon/courses/postgraduate/ma-digital-theatre/ MA Digital Theatre], [[University of the Arts London]]  is the first Master's level course in the UK designed to teach video design exclusively as a specific discipline, rather than embedding it into scenic design. 
Also, Opera Academy Verona has a Workshop Laboratory from 2009 of Projection Design for Opera and Theatre, Directed from Carlo Saleti, Gianfranco Veneruci and Florian CANGA.

In the USA,  a number of programs started at about the same time reflecting the growing acceptance of the profession and the need for skilled projection designers. [[Yale University]] began a graduate level program in Projection Design in 2010.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.yale.edu/2009/10/30/school-drama-adds-new-concentration-projection-design|title=School of Drama Adds New Concentration in Projection Design|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It's being headed by [[Wendall K. Harrington]]. [[CalArts]] had their concentration Video For Performance [https://theater.calarts.edu/programs/design-and-production/video-performance] since the mid-2000s and is currently led by Peter Flaherty while [[UT Austin]] started the MFA concentration [http://www.utexas.edu/finearts/tad/images/integrated-media/  Integrated Media for Live Performance]  also in 2010. It is being led by the Sven Ortel. Both the UT Austin and Yale program are part of an MFA in Design and graduated their first students in 2013.

== Roles of the video designer ==

Depending on the production, and due to the crossover of this field with the fields of [[lighting design]] and [[scenic design]], a video designer's roles and responsibilities may vary from show to show. A video designer may take responsibility for any or all of the following.

[[File:Production-timeline.jpg|thumb|Video Design for Theatre: Production Timeline &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://somethinggraphic.net/2013/11/10/who-will-make-up-the-video-team/|title=Video Know-How for Shows: Who will make up the video team?|first=|last=ninapixelpixie|date=10 November 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

* The overall conceptual design of the video content to be included in the piece, including working with the other members of the [[production team]] to ensure that the video content is integrated with the other design areas.
* The creation of this video content using [[animation|2D]] and [[3D animation]], [[motion graphics]], [[stop motion animation]], [[illustration]], [[filming]] or any other method.
* The management of live cameras, their signal and how it is used on stage as part of the design. 
* The [[Film Director|direction]], lighting and/or [[cinematography]] of any film clips included in the piece.
* The design of the technical system to deliver the video content, including the specification of [[video projectors]], [[LED display]]s, monitors and control systems, cabling routes and rigging positions for optimal video effects. 
* The management of the budget allocated to video, including the sourcing of display technologies and control technologies, their delivery, maintenance and insurance.

This is a very wide skills base, and it is not uncommon for a video designer to work with associates or assistants who can take responsibility for certain areas. For example, a video designer may conceptually design the video content, but hire a skilled [[animator]] to create it, a programmer to program the control system, a production engineer to designer and engineer the control system and a [[projectionist]] to choose the optimum projection positions and maintain the equipment.

== Concert video design ==
&lt;!-- "Concert video design" redirects here. Please update redirect if retitling section. --&gt;

'''Concert video design''' is a niche of the [[filmmaking]] and [[video production]] industry that involves the creation of original video content intended explicitly for display during a live [[concert]] performance.

The creation of visuals for live music performances bears close resemblance to [[music videos]], but are typically meant to be displayed as 'backplate' imagery that adds a visual component to the music performed onstage. However, as the use of video content during musical performances has grown in popularity since the turn of the 21st century, it has become more common to have self-standing 'introductory' and 'interstitial' videos that play on screen on stage without the performers. These pieces may include footage of the artist or artists, shot specifically for the video, and presented onstage with pre-recorded music so that the final appearance is essentially a music video. Such stand-alone videos, however, are typically only viewed in this live setting and may include additional theatrical [[sound effects]].

The earliest concert video visuals likely date to the period of the late 1960s when concerts for artists such as [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[The Doors]] featured [[psychedelic art|psychedelic]] imagery on projection screens suspended behind the performers. Live concert performances took on more and more theatrical elements particularly notable in the concert events put on by [[Pink Floyd]] throughout their career.

[[Laurie Anderson]] was among the earliest to experiment with video content as part of a live performance, and her ideas and images continue to be a direct inspiration to performers as diverse as [[David Bowie]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[Kanye West]]. Meanwhile, in 1982, [[Devo]] integrated rear-projected visuals into their concert set, choreographing themselves to match and interact with the action on screen for several songs. But the rock show that made video content 'standard practice' was [[U2]]'s [[Zoo TV Tour]] conceived and designed by [[Willie Williams (set designer)|Willie Williams]] - who has collaborated with [[Laurie Anderson]].

== Technology used in video design ==

Video designers make use of many technologies from the fields of [[stagecraft]], broadcast equipment and home cinema equipment to build a workable video system, including technologies developed specifically for live video and technologies appropriated from other fields. A video system may include any of the following:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3186">:''See also [[Wigner–Weyl transform]], for another definition of the Weyl transform.''

In [[theoretical physics]], the '''Weyl transformation''', named after [[Hermann Weyl]], is a local rescaling of the [[metric tensor]]:

:&lt;math&gt;g_{ab}\rightarrow e^{-2\omega(x)}g_{ab}&lt;/math&gt;

which produces another metric in the same [[conformal class]].  A theory or an expression invariant under this transformation is called [[conformally invariant]], or is said to possess '''Weyl invariance''' or '''Weyl symmetry'''.  The Weyl symmetry is an important [[symmetry]] in [[conformal field theory]].  It is, for example, a symmetry of the [[Polyakov action]].

The ordinary [[Levi-Civita connection]] and associated [[spin connection]]s are not invariant under Weyl transformations. An appropriately invariant notion is the '''Weyl connection''', which is one way of specifying the structure of a [[conformal connection]].

==Conformal weight==
A quantity &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; has [[conformal weight]] &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; if, under the Weyl transformation, it transforms via 

:&lt;math&gt;
   \varphi \to \varphi e^{k \omega}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus conformally weighted quantities belong to certain [[density bundle]]s; see also [[conformal dimension]].  Let &lt;math&gt;A_\mu&lt;/math&gt; be the [[connection one-form]] associated to the Levi-Civita connection of &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;.  Introduce a connection that depends also on an initial one-form &lt;math&gt;\partial_\mu\omega&lt;/math&gt; via

:&lt;math&gt;
   B_\mu = A_\mu + \partial_\mu \omega.
&lt;/math&gt;

Then &lt;math&gt;D_\mu \varphi \equiv \partial_\mu \varphi + k B_\mu \varphi&lt;/math&gt; is covariant and has conformal weight &lt;math&gt;k - 1&lt;/math&gt;.

==Formulas==
For the transformation
:&lt;math&gt; 
    g_{ab} = f(\phi(x)) \bar{g}_{ab} 
&lt;/math&gt;    
We can derive the following formulas
:&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
    g^{ab} &amp;= \frac{1}{f(\phi(x))} \bar{g}^{ab}  \\
    \sqrt{-g} &amp;= \sqrt{-\bar{g}} f^{D/2} \\
    \Gamma^c_{ab} &amp;= \bar{\Gamma}^c_{ab} + \frac{f'}{2f} \left(\delta^c_b \partial_a \phi + \delta^c_a \partial_b \phi - \bar{g}_{ab} \partial^c \phi \right) \equiv \bar{\Gamma}^c_{ab} + \gamma^c_{ab} \\
     R_{ab} &amp;= \bar{R}_{ab} + \frac{f'' f- f^{\prime 2}}{2f^2} \left((2-D) \partial_a \phi \partial_b \phi - \bar{g}_{ab} \partial^c \phi \partial_c \phi \right) + \frac{f'}{2f} \left((2-D) \nabla_a \partial_b \phi - \bar{g}_{ab} \bar{\Box} \phi\right) + \frac{1}{4} \frac{f^{\prime 2}}{f^2} (D-2) \left(\partial_a \phi \partial_b \phi - \bar{g}_{ab} \partial_c \phi \partial^c \phi \right) \\
    R &amp;= \frac{1}{f} \bar{R} + \frac{1-D}{f} \left( \frac{f''f - f^{\prime 2}}{f^2} \partial^c \phi \partial_c \phi + \frac{f'}{f} \bar{\Box} \phi \right) + \frac{1}{4f} \frac{f^{\prime 2}}{f^2} (D-2) (1-D) \partial_c \phi \partial^c \phi 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Note that the Weyl tensor is invariant under a Weyl rescaling.
