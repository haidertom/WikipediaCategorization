'''Anglo-Saxon glass''' has been found across England during archaeological excavations of both settlement and cemetery sites. Glass in the [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon period]] was used in the manufacture of a range of objects including vessels, beads, windows and was even used in jewellery.&lt;ref name="Bayley2000"&gt;Bayley. Glass-working in Early Medieval England. In Price 2000: 137–142.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 5th century AD with the [[End of Roman rule in Britain|Roman departure from Britain]], there were also considerable changes in the usage of glass.&lt;ref name="Evison2000"&gt;Evison. Glass vessels in England, AD 400-1100. In Price 2000: 47–104.&lt;/ref&gt; Excavation of [[Roman Britain|Romano-British]] sites have revealed plentiful amounts of glass but, in contrast, the amount recovered from 5th century and later Anglo-Saxon sites is minuscule.&lt;ref name=" Evison2000"/&gt;

The majority of complete vessels and assemblages of beads come from the excavations of early Anglo-Saxon cemeteries, but a change in burial rites in the late 7th century affected the recovery of glass, as Christian Anglo-Saxons were buried with fewer grave goods, and glass is rarely found. From the late 7th century onwards, window glass is found more frequently. This is directly related to the introduction of [[Christianity]] and the construction of churches and monasteries.&lt;ref name=" Evison2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heyworth1992"&gt;Heyworth 1992&lt;/ref&gt; There are a few Anglo-Saxon ecclesiastical&lt;ref&gt;Ecclesiastical: Of or relating to a church or to an established religion.&lt;/ref&gt; literary sources that mention the production and use of glass, although these relate to window glass used in ecclesiastical buildings.&lt;ref name=" Evison2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heyworth1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harden1978"&gt;Harden 1978&lt;/ref&gt; Glass was also used by the Anglo-Saxons in their jewellery, both as enamel or as cut glass insets.&lt;ref name="Bimson2000"&gt;Bimson and Freestone. Analysis of some glass from Anglo-Saxon Jewellery. In Price 2000: 137–142.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bimson1978"&gt;Bimson 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Glass manufacture==
{{See also|Glass}}
[[File:Winchestercathedralshaftesburybowl.jpg|thumb|The Shaftesbury Bowl from [[Winchester Cathedral]], a late 10th century glass jar found in front of the High Altar at [[Shaftesbury Abbey]], which may have contained the heart of [[King Canute]], who died at Shaftesbury c. 1035 but was buried in Winchester. It is the only complete piece of late Saxon glass in England.]]

A clear distinction between glass making and glass working must be made. Glass making is the production of raw glass from the raw materials.&lt;ref name="Biek1979"&gt;Biek and Bayley 1979&lt;/ref&gt; Glass working on the other hand refers to the processing of raw glass or recycled glass to create new glass objects, although this may take place in the same location as glass making, it can also take place elsewhere.

===Glass making===
Glass consists of four principal components; a former, alkali flux, stabiliser and colourants/opacifiers.
* '''Former''': '''''Silica''''', which in the Roman and Anglo-Saxon period was added in the form of sand.
* '''Alkali flux''': '''''Soda '''''or''''' potash'''''. The Roman sources, in addition to chemical analysis of glass dating to the Roman and Anglo-Saxon periods, suggest that mineral [[natron]] was used as the flux. [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] also states that the preferred source of natron for glass making was from Egypt.&lt;ref name="Freestone2005"&gt;Freestone 2005&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the 1st millennium AD a new source of flux was being used, wood ash, which is a source of potash.&lt;ref name="Henderson1992"&gt;Henderson 1992&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Stabiliser''': '''''Lime''''' or '''''magnesia'''''. In Anglo-Saxon glass the main stabiliser was lime. This may have been deliberately added to the glass batch, but may simply have been a component of the sand that was used. Roman writer Pliny stated that sand from the [[Belus (river)|River Belus]] was particularly suitable for glass-making,&lt;ref&gt;Eichholz 1989&lt;/ref&gt; this is a calcareous sand, rich in marine shells, and therefore lime.&lt;ref name="Freestone2005"&gt;Freestone 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Price1991"&gt;Price and Cool 1991&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Colourants/Opacifiers''': These can be naturally present in the glass due to impurities in the raw materials, e.g. in the case of green/blue-green glass which results from the presence of iron in the sand. Other colourants are likely to be deliberate additions to the glass melt of small quantities of mineral-rich material&lt;ref name="Guido1999"&gt;Guido and Welch 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brugmann2004"&gt;Brugmann 2004&lt;/ref&gt; or in some cases [[slag]]s from metalworking processes.&lt;ref&gt;Heck and Hoffmann 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The elements in ancient glass that affect its appearance are mainly '''''iron, manganese, cobalt, copper, tin''''' and '''''antimony'''''. The presence or absence of '''''lead''''' is also important, while it doesn’t produce a colour itself (except in the form lead-tin oxide or lead-antimony oxide) it can change the hue of other colourants. In addition when added to opaque glasses it ensures that the colourants form in a controlled way and are uniformly distributed. [[Opacity (optics)|Opacity]] in glass can be due to a number of factors; intensity of colour, bubbles in the glass or the inclusion of opacifying agents, such as tin (SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp; PbSnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and antimony (Ca&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; &amp; CaSb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; &amp; Pb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name="Guido1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brugmann2004"/&gt;

The main type of glass found in the Anglo-Saxon period is a soda-lime-silica glass, continuing the Roman tradition of producing glass.&lt;ref name=" Evison2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heyworth1992"/&gt; There is very little evidence for glass making from the raw materials in Roman Britain&lt;ref name="Price1991"/&gt; and even less evidence in Anglo-Saxon Britain.&lt;ref name="Heyworth1992"/&gt; It would have been nearly impossible to transport the natron from the Middle East to Britain. It is therefore far more likely, that as in the Roman period, glass was being produced near the raw materials and then lumps of raw glass transported. Another source of glass was [[cullet]], recycled broken or crushed glass. Recycling was carried out throughout the Roman period,&lt;ref name="Price1991"/&gt; and large deposits of broken glass at [[Winchester]] and [[Hamwic]] suggest glass was also being recycled in the Anglo-Saxon period.&lt;ref name="Heyworth1992"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hunter and Heyworth 1998&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that by recycling glass in this way it was possible to keep up to the demand for glass products without new raw glass having to be introduced into the system. Additional cullet may also have been collected from the ruins of abandoned Romano-British sites.&lt;ref name="Heyworth1992"/&gt; In the late 7-8th century with the construction of many ecclesiastical establishments and large windows, the demand for glass grew.&lt;ref name="Henderson1992"/&gt; At this time political problems in the Delta-Wadi Natrun region caused a shortage of natron in the Middle East where the raw glass was produced.&lt;ref&gt;Shortland ''et al.'' 2006&lt;/ref&gt; This possibly led to  glass makers experimenting with new fluxes, which finally led to the introduction of wood ash glasses using potash as the main alkali flux, which was more readily available.&lt;ref name="Henderson1992"/&gt;

===Glass working===
[[File:Claw beaker from Ringmere Farm BM 2005.12-5.1.jpg|thumb|left|Claw beaker from an Anglo-Saxon site.]]

Excavation of Anglo-Saxon sites has produced some evidence for limited glass working in the form of crucibles for melting glass, glass debris and furnaces, although, to date, no furnaces have been found associated with [[crucible]]s or glass working debris, or vice versa. All the glass working furnaces that have been found are associated with ecclesiastical sites such as monasteries. This gives the impression that these centres sponsored the majority of glass working in Anglo-Saxon Britain, presumably to primarily work on making glass windows for the church buildings. Documentary sources suggest glass workers were [[wikt:itinerant|itinerant]] travelling around the country, producing glass on demand, possibly re-using broken glass, rather than there being a single centre producing worked glass objects which would then need to be transported.&lt;ref name="Bayley2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heyworth1992"/&gt; Although we can identify the production processes it is still not known how much glass working took place in the Anglo-Saxon period and how widespread it was. The absence of evidence has often been used to argue that the majority of glass was imported from the continent. But this seems unlikely as there are limited numbers of glass vessel manufacturing sites found elsewhere in Europe and some of the Anglo-Saxon glass vessels are unique to England, suggesting the presence of some manufacture centres, possibly in Kent.&lt;ref name=" Evison2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harden1956"&gt;Harden 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead the number of glass working sites reflects not only the nature of the fragmented Anglo-Saxon archaeological record but also the nature of glass, which could be melted down and re-used.&lt;ref name="Bayley2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Price1991"/&gt;

==Glass vessels==
The vast majority of complete vessels come from early Anglo-Saxon cemeteries, allowing similar glass vessel to be grouped together creating [[Typology (archaeology)|typologies]]. More recent excavations of contemporary settlements have revealed fragments of similar vessels types, indicating there are few, if any, differences between domestic glass and those ritually deposited in graves.&lt;ref name="Harden1978"/&gt; There is a significant difference between Roman and Anglo-Saxon vessel forms, and glass working techniques became more limited. Few of the Anglo-Saxon forms can be classified as tableware, as this term implies to some extent that vessels can be set on a flat surface. The forms used had primarily rounded or pointed bases, or when bases were present would have been too top heavy and unstable. This implies that vessels were held in the hand until the drink was completed.&lt;ref name=" Evison2000"/&gt; The evidence for glass vessels is patchier in the 8th century, as the number of complete vessels found decreases. This is directly related to the introduction of Christianity and the change in burial rite.&lt;ref name="Harden1978"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harden1956"/&gt;

The first typology for Anglo-Saxon glass vessels was devised by Dr. Donald B. Harden in 1956,&lt;ref name="Harden1956"/&gt; which was later revised in 1978.&lt;ref name="Harden1978"/&gt; The names established by Harden have now become familiar with usage, and Professor Vera Evison’s typology retained many categories while adding some new types, some from newly excavated vessels that could not be placed into Harden’s typology.&lt;ref name=" Evison2000"/&gt;

The chemical composition of Anglo-Saxon glass vessels is very similar to late Roman glass, which has high amounts of iron, manganese and titanium. The slightly higher amounts of iron in the Early Anglo-Saxon glass results in a colourless glass, with a green-yellow tinge. By the end of the 7th century some innovations can be observed. With generally better quality glass, a greater range of colours found and the beginning of the tendency to use a second colour for decoration.  Most Anglo-Saxon vessels were free blown, although occasionally some mould blown examples are found, mostly with vertical ribbing. The rims were fire rounded, sometimes slightly thickened and cupped, rolled or folded either inwards or outwards. Decoration was accomplished almost entirely by the application of trails which could be in the same colour as the vessel or contrasting, or in the form of a reticella&lt;ref&gt;The term reticella is often used incorrectly to describe fine twists and cables, often in a herringbone design and generally in two colours. The term is only correctly applicable to a particular technique used to decorate glass vessels by Venetian glassworkers.&lt;/ref&gt; like trail.&lt;ref name=" Evison2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harden1978"/&gt;

==Glass beads==
:''See also: [[Glass bead|Glass Beads]] and [[Bead]].''

[[Image:Beads.JPG|thumb|right|250px|A collection of Anglo-Saxon beads from a cemetery at Sarr]]
The vast majority of early Anglo-Saxon female graves contain beads, which are often found in large numbers in the area of the neck and chest. Beads are also sometimes found in male burials, with large beads often associated with prestigious weapons. A variety of materials other than glass were available for Anglo-Saxon beads including; amber, rock crystal, amethyst, bone, shells, coral and even metal.&lt;ref name="Guido2000"&gt;Guido and Welch. Indirect evidence for glass bead manufacture in early Anglo-Saxon England. In Price 2000 115–120.&lt;/ref&gt; These beads are usually considered to have been decorative but may also have a social or ritual function.&lt;ref name="Brugmann2004"/&gt; Anglo-Saxon glass beads show a wide variety of bead manufacturing techniques, sizes, shapes, colours and decorations. Various studies have been carried out investigating the distribution and chronological change of bead types.&lt;ref name="Guido1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brugmann2004"/&gt;

Several bead manufacturing sites have been identified on the continent, by the presence of waste glass, beads and glass rods. Two late Roman to 5th century sites have been discovered at Trier and [[Tibiscum]] in Romania, while closer to England and dating to the 6th-7th century two more sites have been found at Jordenstraat and Rothulfuashem (Netherlands). There is also extensive evidence for bead making workshops in Scandinavia which have been dated to the 8th century or later. The best known examples are Eketorp on Öland (Sweden) and Ribe in Jutland (Denmark).&lt;ref name="Guido1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brugmann2004"/&gt; There is a tendency for British archaeologists to assume that the majority of glass beads recovered were imported. Although to date there is a lack of direct evidence for bead manufacture in early Anglo-Saxon England, there is evidence for it in early Christian Ireland, northern Britain and the post-Roman west. It is also present on Saxon monastic and settlement sites between the 7th and 9th century. Even so, indirect evidence from the distribution of early Saxon beads has been used to suggest that there is at least three bead groups which were being manufactured in England.&lt;ref name="Guido2000"/&gt;

To date only two extensive chemical analysis studies of Anglo-Saxon bead assemblages have been carried out, from the cemeteries of Sewerby in Yorkshire and Apple Down in Sussex. These studies showed that, like glass vessels, the beads had a modified soda-lime-silica composition with high manganese and iron oxide contents. Variations in the composition directly related to the glass colour.&lt;ref name="Guido1999"/&gt; Lead rich opaque glass was also prominent in Anglo-Saxon Britain, most likely due to its lower softening temperature and longer working period, which would not melt or distort the bead body.&lt;ref name="Hirst2000"&gt;Hirst. An approach to the study of Anglo-Saxon glass beads. In J. Price 2000 121–130.&lt;/ref&gt; The bead body could be constructed in a number of different ways; winding, drawing, piercing, folding or even a combination of these. Decoration was applied by adding twisting rods of colour, coloured mosaic patterns, enclosing metal between layers of clear glass or simply adding a different colour in either drops or trails.&lt;ref name="Brugmann2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hirst2000"/&gt;

==Window glass==
With the introduction of Christianity in the early 7th century and the building of ecclesiastical structures the amount of window glass also increased. Window glass, some of which was also coloured, has been identified at more than 17 sites, of which 12 are ecclesiastical. Hundreds of window glass fragments have been found at [[Jarrow]], [[Monkwearmouth|Wearmouth]], [[Brandon, Suffolk|Brandon]], [[Whithorn]] and Winchester.&lt;ref&gt;Cramp 1975&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cramp2000"&gt;Cramp. Anglo-Saxon Window Glass. In Price 2000: 105–114.&lt;/ref&gt; This evidence supports the historical records, such as [[Bede]]’s account of [[Benedict Biscop]]’s importation of glaziers from Gaul to glaze the windows in the monastery at Wearmouth in AD 675.&lt;ref name="Heyworth1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cramp2000"/&gt;

Most Anglo-Saxon window glass is thin, durable, bubbly and when colourless has a pale bluish-green tint. Many of the ecclesiastical sites have also produced strongly coloured glass from the 7th century onwards. Analysis of window glass from [[Beverley]], [[Uley]], Winchester, Whithorn, Wearmouth and Jarrow, has revealed that the majority was again a soda-lime-silica glass but it has also revealed that the composition is different from that of vessel glass, with lower quantities of iron, manganese and titanium suggesting a different source of raw material, possibly from [[The Levant]].&lt;ref name="Freestone2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cramp2000"/&gt; The analysis also revealed more about the transition from using soda as a flux, to potash.&lt;ref name="Henderson1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cramp2000"/&gt;

Window glass in antiquity could be produced in three ways; [[Cylinder blown sheet|cylinder blown]], [[Crown glass (window)|crown manufacture]] or cast. In Anglo-Saxon England there is evidence for all three types of methods being used. The vast majority of glass windows were produced by the cylinder blown method, although possibly on a smaller scale than the classic methods mentioned by [[Theophilus Presbyter|Theophilus]]. Some Anglo-Saxon window glass was produced by the crown method and at [[Repton]] thick pieces of window glass with swirling layered surfaces were possibly made using the cast method.&lt;ref name="Cramp2000"/&gt;

==Jewellery glass==
[[Image:Sutton.Hoo.ShoulderClasp2.RobRoy.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Sutton Hoo]] shoulder-clasps with inlays of garnets and glass chequer [[millefiori]].]]

The majority of jewellery in the 6th-7th century made intensive use of flat, cut [[almandine garnet]]s in gold and garnet [[cloisonné]] (or "cellwork") but occasionally glass was also cut and inset as gems. The colours used were almost entirely limited to blue and green.&lt;ref name="Bimson2000"/&gt; Occasionally red glass has been used as a substitute for garnet,&lt;!-- Strange! The BM pages do not mention red glass being used for either of these objects --&gt; for example in some of the [[Sutton Hoo]] objects, such as the [[Sutton Hoo purse-lid|purse-lid]] and blue glass in the shoulder clasps.&lt;ref name="Bimson2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bimson1978"/&gt; The 7th-century [[Forsbrook Pendant]] also mixes garnet and [[blue glass]] inlays. Anglo-Saxon enamel was also used in the production of jewellery, with coloured glass melted in separate cells.&lt;ref name="Bimson2000"/&gt;

Chemical analysis of this glass has revealed that they are a soda-lime-silica glass but with a lower iron and manganese oxide content than the high iron, manganese and titanium glass used to make vessels. The similarity between the composition of the glass inlays and Roman coloured glass is remarkable, so much so that it is likely that the Anglo-Saxon craftworkers were re-using Roman opaque glass, possibly Roman glass [[tessera]]e.&lt;ref name="Bimson2000"/&gt;

[[File:Computer_Workstation_Variables_cleanup.png|thumb|right|240px|The field of ergonomics employs anthropometry to optimize human interaction with equipment and workplaces.]]

'''Anthropometry''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|el|ἄνθρωπος}} ''anthropos'', "human", and {{lang|el|μέτρον}} ''metron'', "measure") refers to the measurement of the human individual. An early tool of [[biological anthropology|physical anthropology]], it has been used for identification, for the purposes of understanding human physical variation, in [[paleoanthropology]] and in various attempts to correlate physical with racial and psychological traits. Anthropometry involves the systematic measurement of the physical properties of the human body, primarily dimensional descriptors of body size and shape.&lt;ref&gt;Md. {{clarify|date=August 2015}} Ariful, Islam; Md. {{clarify|date=August 2015}}, Asadujjaman; Md. {{clarify|date=August 2015}}, Nuruzzaman; Md. {{clarify|date=August 2015}} Mosharraf, Hossain. "Ergonomics Consideration for Hospital Bed Design: A Case Study in Bangladesh". Journal of Modern Science and Technology 01 (01): 30-44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, anthropometry plays an important role in [[industrial design]], [[clothing]] design, [[ergonomics]] and architecture where statistical data about the distribution of body dimensions in the population are used to optimize products. Changes in lifestyles, nutrition, and ethnic composition of populations lead to changes in the distribution of body dimensions (e.g. the [[Epidemiology of obesity|rise in obesity]]) and require regular updating of anthropometric data collections.

== History ==
{{main|History of anthropometry}}
[[File:Galton at Bertillon's (1893).jpg|right|thumb|180px|A [[History of anthropometry#Forensic anthropometry|Bertillon record]] for [[Francis Galton]], from a visit to [[Alphonse Bertillon|Bertillon]]'s laboratory in 1893]]

The history of anthropometry includes and spans various concepts, both [[scientific method|scientific]] and [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]], such as [[craniometry]], [[paleoanthropology]], [[biological anthropology]], [[phrenology]], [[physiognomy]], [[forensic science|forensics]], [[criminology]], [[phylogeography]], [[Anthropogeny|human origins]], and cranio-facial description, as well as correlations between various anthropometrics and [[personal identity]], [[typology (psychology)|mental typology]], [[personality]], [[cranial vault]] and [[brain size]], and other factors.

At various times in history, applications of anthropometry have ranged vastly—from accurate [[description|scientific description]] and [[epidemiology|epidemiological analysis]] to rationales for [[eugenics]] and overtly [[racism|racist]] [[social movement]]s—and its points of concern have been numerous, diverse, and sometimes highly unexpected.

==Individual variation==

===Auxologic===
{{main|Auxology}}
Auxologic is a broad term covering the study of all aspects of [[human]] physical [[human development (biology)|growth]]

====Height====
{{main|Human height}}
[[Human height]] varies greatly between individuals and across populations for a variety of complex biological, genetic, and environmental factors, among others. Due to methodological and practical problems, its measurement is also subject to considerable error in [[statistical sampling]].

The average height in genetically and environmentally [[Homogeneity (statistics)|homogeneous]] [[population genetics|population]]s is often proportional across a large number of individuals. Exceptional height variation (around 20% deviation from a population's average) within such a population is sometimes due to [[gigantism]] or [[dwarfism]], which are caused by specific [[gene]]s or [[endocrine]] abnormalities.&lt;ref&gt;Ganong, William F. (Lange Medical, 2001) ''Review of Medical Physiology'' (pp. 392-397)&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that a great degree of variation occurs between even the most 'common' bodies (66% of the population)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gill|first1=Simeon|last2=Parker|first2=Christopher J.|title=The True Height of the Waist: Explorations of Automated Body Scanner Waist Definitions of the TC2 scanner|journal=Proc. of 5th Int.

In the most extreme population comparisons, for example, the average [[female]] height in [[Bolivia]] is {{convert|142.2|cm|ftin|abbr=on}} while the average [[male]] height in the [[Dinaric Alps]] is {{convert|185.6|cm|ftin|abbr=on}}, an average difference of {{convert|43.4|cm|ftin|abbr=on}}. Similarly, the [[List of shortest people|shortest]] and [[List of tallest people|tallest]] of individuals, [[Chandra Bahadur Dangi]] and [[Robert Wadlow]], have ranged from {{convert|1|ft|9|in|cm|abbr=on}} to {{convert|8|ft|11.1|in|cm|abbr=on|0}}, respectively.&lt;ref name="GWR-Dangi"&gt;[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2012/2/shortest-man-world-record-its-official!-chandra-bahadur-dangi-from-nepal-is-smallest-adult-of-all-time/ Shortest man world record: It’s official!

====Weight====
{{main|Human weight}}
[[Human weight]] varies extensively both individually and across populations, with the most extreme documented examples of adults being [[Lucia Zarate]] who weighed {{convert|4.7|lb|kg}}, and [[Jon Brower Minnoch]] who weighed {{convert|1,400|lb|kg}}, and with population extremes ranging from {{convert|109.3|lb|kg}} in [[Bangladesh]] to {{convert|192.7|lb|kg}} in [[Micronesia]].&lt;ref name='2009-09-24 TT'&gt;{{cite news | first = Tom | last = Chivers | title = Human extremes: the tallest, shortest, heaviest and lightest people ever | date = 2009-09-24 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/6226095/Human-extremes-the-tallest-shortest-heaviest-and-lightest-people-ever.html | work = The Telegraph | accessdate = 2013-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='2012-06-21 TT'&gt;{{cite news | first = Conrad | last = Quilty-Harper |author2=Andrew Blenkinsop |author3=David Kinross |author4=Dan Palmer  | title = The world's fattest countries: how do you compare? | date = 2012-06-21 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/earthnews/9345086/The-worlds-fattest-countries-how-do-you-compare.html | work = The Telegraph | accessdate = 2013-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Organs====
Adult [[brain size]] varies from {{convert|974.9|cm3|abbr=on}} to {{convert|1498.1|cm3|abbr=on}} in females and {{convert|1052.9|cm3|abbr=on}} to {{convert|1498.5|cm3|abbr=on}} in males, with the average being {{convert|1130|cm3|abbr=on}} and {{convert|1260|cm3|abbr=on}}, respectively.&lt;ref name="refCosgrove"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Cosgrove| first = KP|author2=Mazure CM|author3=Staley JK| url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006322307001989| title = Evolving Knowledge of Sex Differences in Brain Structure, Function and Chemistry| year = 2007| journal = Biol Psychiatry| volume = 62| pages = 847–55| pmid = 17544382| doi = 10.1016/j.biopsych.2007.03.001| issue = 8| pmc = 2711771}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="refAllen"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Allen| first = JS|author2=Damasio H |author3=Grabowski TJ | title = Normal neuroanatomical variation in the human brain: An MRI-volumetric study| journal = Am J Phys Anthropol| year = 2002| volume = 118| pages = 341–58 | doi = 10.1002/ajpa.10092| url = http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/96515947/abstract | pmid = 12124914 | issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The right [[cerebral hemisphere]] is typically larger than the left, whereas the [[cerebellar hemispheres]] are typically of more similar size.

Size of the human [[stomach]] varies significantly in adults, with one study showing volumes ranging from {{convert|520|cm3|abbr=on}} to {{convert|1536|cm3|abbr=on}} and weights ranging from {{convert|77|g}} to {{convert|453|g}}.&lt;ref name='Cox 1945'&gt;{{cite journal | title = Variations in size of the human stomach | journal = California and Western Medicine | year = 1945 | first = Alvin J. | last = Cox | volume = 63 | issue = 6 | pages = 267–268 | id =  | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1473711/pdf/calwestmed00012-0041.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2013-05-26 | pmid=18747178 | pmc=1473711}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aesthetic===
{{main|Human physical appearance|physical attractiveness}}
[[Beauty#Human beauty|Human beauty]] and [[physical attractiveness]] have been preoccupations throughout history which often intersect with anthropometric standards. [[Cosmetology]], [[facial symmetry]], and [[waist–hip ratio]] are three such examples where measurements are commonly thought to be fundamental.

==Evolutionary science==
Anthropometric studies today are conducted to investigate the evolutionary significance of differences in body proportion between populations whose ancestors lived in different environments. Human populations exhibit climatic variation patterns similar to those of other large-bodied mammals, following [[Bergmann's rule]], which states that individuals in cold climates will tend to be larger than ones in warm climates, and [[Allen's rule]], which states that individuals in cold climates will tend to have shorter, stubbier limbs than those in warm climates.

On a microevolutionary level, anthropologists use anthropometric variation to reconstruct small-scale population history. For instance, John Relethford's studies of early 20th-century anthropometric data from Ireland show that the geographical patterning of body proportions still exhibits traces of the invasions by the English and Norse centuries ago.

Similarly, anthropometric indices, namely comparison of the [[human stature]] was used to illustrate anthropometric trends. This study was conducted by [[Jörg Baten]] and Sandew Hira and was based on the anthropological founds that [[human height]] is predetermined by the [[Nutrition|quality of the nutrition]], which used to be higher in the more developed countries. The research was based on the datasets for [[Southern Chinese]] contract migrants who were sent to [[Suriname]] and [[Indonesia]] and included 13,000 individuals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baten |first1=Jörg |title=ANTHROPOMETRIC TRENDS IN SOUTHERN CHINA,1830–1864 |journal=Australian Economic History Review |date=November 2008 |volume=Vol. 48 |issue=No. 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Measuring instruments==

===3D body scanners===
Today anthropometry can be performed with [[3D body scanning|three-dimensional scanners]]. A global collaborative study to examine the uses of three-dimensional scanners for health care was launched in March 2007. The Body Benchmark Study will investigate the use of three-dimensional scanners to calculate volumes and segmental volumes of an individual body scan. The aim is to establish whether the [[Body volume index|Body Volume Index]] has the potential to be used as a long-term computer-based anthropometric measurement for health care. In 2001 the UK conducted the largest sizing survey to date using scanners. Since then several national surveys have followed in the UK's pioneering steps, notably SizeUSA, SizeMexico, and SizeThailand, the latter still ongoing. SizeUK showed that the nation had become taller and heavier but not as much as expected. Since 1951, when the last women's survey had taken place, the average weight for women had gone up from 62 to 65&amp;nbsp;kg. However, recent research has shown that posture of the participant significantly influences the measurements taken&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gill|first1=Simeon|last2=Parker|first2=Christopher J.|title=Scan posture definition and hip girth measurement: the impact on clothing design and body scanning|journal=Ergonomics|volume=60|issue=8|pages=1123-1136|doi=10.1080/00140139.2016.1251621|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00140139.2016.1251621|accessdate=30 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the precision of 3D body scanner may or may not be high enough for industry tolerances&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parker|first1=Christopher J.|last2=GIll|first2=Simeon|last3=Hayes|first3=Steven G.|title=3D Body Scanning has Suitable Reliability: An Anthropometric Investigation for Garment Construction|journal=Proc. of 3DBODY.TECH 2017 - 8th Int.

Despite these current limitations, 3D Body Scanning has been suggested as a replacement for body measurement prediction technologies which (despite the great appeal) have yet to be as reliable as real human data. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Januszkiewicz|first1=Monika|last2=Parker|first2=Christopher J.|last3=Hayes|first3=Steven G.|last4=Gill|first4=Simeon|title=Online Virtual Fit Is Not Yet Fit For Purpose: An Analysis Of Fashion e-Commerce Interfaces|journal=Proc. of 3DBODY.TECH 2017 - 8th Int.

===Baropodographic===
{{main|Baropodography}}
[[File:example insole pressure device.jpg|thumb|Example insole (in-shoe) foot pressure measurement device]]
Baropodographic devices fall into two main categories: (i) [[:File:example foot pressure measurement device.jpg|floor-based]], and (ii) [[:File:example insole pressure device.jpg|in-shoe]]. The underlying technology is diverse, ranging from [[piezoelectric sensor]] arrays to [[light refraction]],&lt;ref name="Lord1981"&gt;Lord M 1981. Foot pressure measurement: a review of methodology. J Biomed Eng 3 91-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gefen2007"&gt;Gefen A 2007.

Phys Ther 80 399-409.&lt;/ref&gt; but the ultimate form of the data generated by all modern technologies is either a 2D image or a 2D image [[time series]] of the pressures acting under the plantar surface of the foot. From these data other variables may be calculated (see ''[[Pedobarography#Data analysis|data analysis]].'')

The spatial and temporal resolutions of the images generated by commercial pedobarographic systems range from approximately 3 to 10&amp;nbsp;mm and 25 to 500&amp;nbsp;Hz, respectively. Sensor technology limits finer resolution. Such resolutions yield a [[contact area]] of approximately 500 sensors (for a typical adult human foot with surface area of approximately 100&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name="Britane2004"&gt;Birtane M, Tuna H 2004.

Temporal parameters and patterns of the foot roll during walking: normative data for healthy adults. Gait &amp; Posture 10 97-108.&lt;/ref&gt; approximately 150,000 pressure values, depending on the hardware specifications, are recorded for each step.

===Neuroimaging===
{{see also|Neuroimaging}}
Direct measurements involve examinations of brains from corpses, or more recently, imaging techniques such as [[MRI]], which can be used on living persons. Such measurements are used in research on [[neuroscience and intelligence]]. Brain volume data and other craniometric data are used in mainstream science to compare modern-day animal species and to analyze the evolution of the human species in archeology.

==Epidemiology and medical anthropology==
Anthropometric measurements also have uses in [[epidemiology]] and [[medical anthropology]], for example in helping to determine the relationship between various body measurements (height, weight, percentage body fat, etc.) and medical outcomes.  Anthropometric measurements are frequently used to diagnose [[malnutrition]] in resource-poor clinical settings.

==Forensics and criminology==
[[File:Fingerprints taken by William James Herschel 1859-1860.jpg|thumb|right|300px|An early set of [[fingerprint|finger- and handprint]]s by [[Sir William Herschel, 2nd Baronet]] (1833–1917)]]
{{Further|Forensic anthropology|anthropological criminology}}

Forensic anthropologists study the human skeleton in a legal setting. A forensic anthropologist can assist in the identification of a decedent through various skeletal analyses that produce a biological profile. Forensic anthropologists utilize the [[Fordisc]] program to help in the interpretation of craniofacial measurements in regards to ancestry or race determination.

One part of a biological profile is a person's racial or ancestral affinity. People with significant European or Middle Eastern ancestry generally have relatively no{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=December 2016}} [[prognathism]]; a relatively long and narrow face; a prominent brow ridge that protrudes forward from the forehead; a narrow, tear-shaped nasal cavity; a "silled" nasal aperture; tower-shaped nasal bones; a triangular-shaped palate; and an angular and sloping eye orbit shape. People with considerable African ancestry typically have a broad and round nasal cavity; no dam or nasal sill; Quonset hut-shaped nasal bones; notable facial projection in the jaw and mouth area (prognathism); a rectangular-shaped palate; and a square or rectangular eye orbit shape. A relatively small prognathism often characterizes people with considerable East Asian ancestry; no nasal sill or dam; an oval-shaped nasal cavity; tent-shaped nasal bones; a horseshoe-shaped palate; and a rounded and non-sloping eye orbit shape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redwoods.edu/Instruct/AGarwin/anth_6_ancestry.htm Forensic Anthropology - Ancestry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206061745/http://www.redwoods.edu/instruct/agarwin/anth_6_ancestry.htm |date=2012-02-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these characteristics are only a matter of frequency among particular races: their presence or absence of one or more does not automatically classify an individual into a racial group.

==Ergonomics==
{{main|Human factors and ergonomics}}
Today, ergonomics professionals apply an understanding of human factors to the design of equipment, systems and working methods to improve comfort, health, safety, and productivity. This includes [[physical ergonomics]] in relation to human anatomy, physiological and bio mechanical characteristics; [[cognitive ergonomics]] in relation to perception, memory, reasoning, motor response including [[human–computer interaction]], mental workloads, decision making, skilled performance, human reliability, work stress, training, and user experiences; organizational ergonomics in relation to metrics of communication, crew resource management, work design, schedules, teamwork, [[Participatory Ergonomics|participation]], community, cooperative work, new work programs, virtual organizations, and telework; environmental ergonomics in relation to human metrics affected by climate, temperature, pressure, vibration, and light; visual ergonomics; and others.&lt;ref name="IEA def"&gt;International Ergonomics Association.

{{main|Biometrics}}

Biometrics refers to the identification of humans by their characteristics or traits. Biometrics is used in computer science as a form of identification and [[access control]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biometrics.cse.msu.edu/info.html |title=Biometrics: Overview |publisher=Biometrics.cse.msu.edu |date=6 September 2007 |accessdate=2012-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107071003/http://biometrics.cse.msu.edu/info.html |archivedate=2012-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used to identify individuals in groups that are under [[surveillance]]. Biometric identifiers are the distinctive, measurable characteristics used to label and describe individuals.&lt;ref name="JainA"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jain A. |author2=Hong L. |author3=Pankanti S. | year = 2000 | title = Biometric Identification | url = http://helios.et.put.poznan.pl/~dgajew/download/PUT/SEMESTR_10/IO/FACE_RECOGNITION/BiometricsACM.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Communications of the ACM | volume = 43 | issue = 2| pages = 91–98 | doi = 10.1145/328236.328110 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Biometric identifiers are often categorized as physiological versus behavioral characteristics.&lt;ref name=Jain1&gt;{{Cite book| last = Jain| first = Anil K.| last2 = Ross| first2 = Arun| title = Handbook of Biometrics| publisher = Springer| editor-last = Jain| editor-first = AK| editor2-last = Flynn| editor2-first =| editor3-last = Ross| editor3-first = A| year = 2008| chapter = Introduction to Biometrics| pages = 1–22| url = https://www.springer.com/computer/image+processing/book/978-1-4419-4375-0| isbn = 978-0-387-71040-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Example applications include [[dermatoglyphics]] and [[soft biometrics]].

==United States military research==
The US Military has conducted over 40 anthropometric surveys of U.S. Military personnel between 1945 and 1988, including the 1988 Army Anthropometric Survey (ANSUR) of men and women with its 240 measures.  Statistical data from these surveys encompasses over 75,000 individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://assist.daps.dla.mil/docimages/0000/40/29/54083.PD0  U.S. Military personnel] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041016064120/http://assist.daps.dla.mil/docimages/0000/40/29/54083.PD0 |date=October 16, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civilian American and European Surface Anthropometry Resource Project—CAESAR==
CAESAR began in 1997 as a partnership between government and industry to collect and organize the most extensive sampling of consumer body measurements for comparison. The project collected and organized data on 2,400 U.S. &amp; Canadian and 2,000 European civilians and a database was developed. This database records the anthropometric variability of men and women, aged 18–65, of various weights, ethnic groups, gender, geographic regions, and socio-economic status. The study was conducted from April 1998 to early 2000 and included three scans per person in a standing pose, full-coverage pose and relaxed seating pose. Data collection methods were standardized and documented so that the database can be consistently expanded and updated. High-resolution measurements of body surfaces were made using 3D Surface Anthropometry. This technology can capture hundreds of thousands of points in three dimensions on the human body surface in a few seconds. It has many advantages over the old measurement system using tape measures, anthropometers, and other similar instruments. It provides detail about the surface shape as well as 3D locations of measurements relative to each other and enables easy transfer to Computer-Aided Design (CAD) or Manufacturing (CAM) tools. The resulting scan is independent of the measurer, making it easier to standardize. Automatic landmark recognition (ALR) technology was used to extract anatomical landmarks from the 3D body scans automatically. Eighty landmarks were placed on each subject. More than 100 univariate measures were provided, over 60 from the scan and approximately 40 using traditional measurements. Demographic data such as age, ethnic group, gender, geographic region, education level, and present occupation, family income and more were also captured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sae.org/standardsdev/tsb/cooperative/caefact.htm|title=CAESAR Fact Sheet|website=www.sae.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinette, Kathleen M, Daanen, Hein A M, Precision of the CAESAR scan-extracted measurements, Applied Ergonomics, vol 37, issue 3, May 2007, pp. 259–265.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fashion design==
Scientists working for private companies and government agencies conduct anthropometric studies to determine a range of sizes for clothing and other items. Measurements of the foot are used in the manufacture and sale of [[footwear]]: measurement devices may be used either to determine a retail shoe size directly (e.g. the [[Brannock Device]]) or to determine the detailed dimensions of the foot for custom manufacture (e.g. [[ALINEr]]).&lt;ref&gt;Goonetilleke, R. S., Ho, Edmond Cheuk Fan, and So, R. H. Y. (1997). "Foot Anthropometry in Hong Kong". ''Proceedings of the ASEAN 97 Conference'', Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, 1997. pp. 81–88.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture ==
In art [[Yves Klein]] termed his performance paintings '''anthropometries''', where he covered nude women with paint and used their bodies as paintbrushes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4716">'''Antilocution''' is a form of [[prejudice]] in which [[Affirmative and negative|negative]] [[Speech|verbal]] remarks against a [[person]], group, or community, are made in a [[public]] or private setting and not addressed directly to the target. American psychologist [[Gordon Allport]] first used this term in his 1954 book, ''The Nature of Prejudice''''',''' to label the first of the five degrees of [[antipathy]] that measure manifestation of prejudice in a society as antilocution (see also: "[[Allport's Scale]]"). Antilocution is similar to the rather common form of [[betrayal]] in which a person "talks behind someone's back.", but antilocution involves an in-group [[ostracism|ostracizing]] an out-group on a [[bias]]ed basis.

The use of the term antilocution is overshadowed by the term [[hate speech]], which holds a similar meaning but places no regard on the fact that the out-group is unaware of the [[discrimination]].

==Etymology==

The term antilocution first appeared in 1954 in "The Nature of Prejudice", a book written by an American psychologist "Gordon Allport". Antilocution is the first stage of Allport's scale, a scale to measure the degree of bias or prejudice in one's [[society]]. Following antilocution, the greater stages of prejudice are [[Avoidance coping|avoidance]], [[discrimination]], [[physical abuse|physical attack]], and [[Genocide|extermination]] respectively. Antilocution is a [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] noun which consists of the word locution and the word anti, to express a counterproductive way to employ locution.

==Description==
Antilocution is considered the least aggressive form of prejudice and represented by [[conversations]] of individuals in a society sharing similar opinions, which often are biased and result in negative reputation of the target of antilocution. Although this form of prejudice maybe the least aggressive, it nevertheless can be very destructive and life-changing for the subject. Those who employ antilocution may not be aware or consider themselves as involved in any discriminatory act.  Antilocution is perhaps the most common form of discriminative act, and is more commonly referred as minor [[gossips]] or [[scandals]]. The subject may feel the need to join in with the flow or comedize it if the antilocution is employed by the [[majority]]. This can either create a place for the subject in the pack or lead to a spread of biased [[information]] through the society and can lead to negative modification in [[behaviors]] toward the subject, thus will significantly put the subject in a [[disadvantaged]] way both socially and mentally.

==Causes, employment, and danger==
Individuals often engage in prejudicial conversation when they feel threatened and frequently is based on misperceptions and stereotyping of the subject. Antilocution often related to the fact that the subject is viewed as an anomaly to the group, for example the subject maybe a newcoming member thus no one actually know the subject so they judge the subject based on their perceptions and stereotyping, often involve [[racism]], [[ethnic]], or [[gender]]. Most individuals engaged in this type of behavior will most likely deny that their behavior is prejudicial in any way, and often indicate this as a matter of expressing their own [[opinions]]. This kind of treatment to antilocution is very dangerous in its own as it leads to a widespread in discriminative acts toward the subject as individuals feel little to no [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] in doing so. Facts are often needed to [[contradict]] [[misinformation]] and create a positive [[Social influence|influence]] in the society toward the subject, or else opinions will continue to multiply and lead to further misconceptions, which can eventually lead to more serious forms of prejudice and discrimination and will harm the subject socially, mentally, and even physically if the problem worsen to a certain degree.

[[File:Arborloo-en.svg|thumb|Steps of usage of the arborloo.]]
[[File:Arborloo (5567538554).jpg|thumb|Arborloo in [[Ekwendeni]], [[Malawi]]]]
An '''arborloo''' is a simple type of [[composting toilet]] in which [[feces]] are collected in a shallow pit and a [[Fruit tree|fruiting tree]] is later planted in the fertile soil of the full pit. Arborloos have a pit like a [[pit latrine]] but less deep, a concrete slab, superstructure (toilet house or [[outhouse]]) to provide privacy and possibly a ring beam to protect the pit from collapsing.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecosanres.org/toilets_that_make_compost.htm|title=Toilets That Make Compost|website=www.ecosanres.org|access-date=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arborloo works by temporarily putting the slab and superstructure above a shallow pit while this pit fills. When the pit is nearly full, the superstructure and slab is moved to a newly dug pit and the old pit is covered with the earth got by digging the new pit and left to compost. The old pit serves as a bed for a fruit tree or some other useful vegetation, which is preferably planted during the rainy season.&lt;ref name="Morgan 2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Morgan|first=Peter|title=Toilets that make compost: Low-cost, sanitary toilets that produce valuable compost for crops in an African context|year=2007|publisher=EcoSanRes Programme|location=Stockholm|isbn=978-9-197-60222-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arborloo is a type of [[dry toilet]]. In using the nutrient-rich soil of a retired pit, the arborloo, in effect, treats feces as a resource rather than a waste product.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ecological Sanitation|last=Winblad|first=Uno (et al.)|publisher=Ecosanres Program of the Stockholm Environment Institute|year=2004|isbn=|location=http://www.ecosanres.org/pdf_files/Ecological_Sanitation_2004.pdf|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guidelines on the Use of Urine and Faeces in Crop Production. 35p|last=Jönsson et al.|first=|publisher=Ecosanres Program of the Stockholm Environment Institute|year=2004|isbn=|location=http://www.ecosanres.org/pdf_files/ESR_Publications_2004/ESR2web.pdf|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arborloos are used in rural areas of many [[developing countries]], for example in Zimbabwe, Malawi and Ethiopia.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Design==
The defecation pit may be circular or square and this may depend on the slab and superstructure. A circular pit is less likely to collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=WEDC|title=An engineer's guide to latrine slabs|year=2012|publisher=WEDC|location=Loughborough University|isbn=978 1 84380 143 6|page=4|url=http://wedc.lboro.ac.uk/resources/booklets/BK005_LTS_A5_Pages.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The pit of the arborloo is shallow (between 1-1.5 meter).&lt;ref name="Morgan 2007"/&gt;
[[File:Slab mounted over pit with ring beam (5372370329).jpg|thumb|A [[Squat toilet|squat slab]] covering the drop hole of an Arborloo in Malawi. The slab can be rolled from one location to the next.]]

'''The Bogoliubov Prize for young scientists''' is an award offered to young researchers in [[theoretical physics]] by the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] (JINR), an international intergovernmental organization located in Dubna, Russia. The award is issued in memory of the physicist and mathematician [[Nikolay Bogoliubov]]. 

The prize is awarded to young (up to 33-year-old) researchers for "outstanding contributions in fields of [[theoretical physics]] related to Bogoliubov's scientific interests".&lt;ref&gt;[http://cerncourier.com/main/article/39/3/19 Bogoliubov prize for young scientists] at CERN COURIER&lt;/ref&gt; The awardee is one who has demonstrated "early scientific maturity" and whose results are recognized worldwide and peer-reviewed. The laureates generally emulate Bogoliubov's own skill in using sophisticated mathematics to attempt to solve concrete physical problems (mostly in the fields of [[nonlinear dynamics]], [[statistical physics]], [[quantum field theory]] and elementary [[particle physics]]).

==Jury==
The jury is presided by the theoretical physicist [[Dmitry Shirkov]], who co-authored many works with Nikolay Bogoliubov.

==Laureates==
* 1999 Oleg Shvedov ([[Moscow State University]], Russia): for a series of works on asymptotical methods in statistical physics and quantum field theory.
* 2001 Evgenii Ivashkevich  ([[JINR]], Russia): for a series of works on analytical methods in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics.
* 2005 [[Aurélien Barrau]] (the Laboratory of sub-atomic physics and cosmology and [[Joseph Fourier University]], Grenoble, France): for a series of works on astrophysics and cosmology.

[[Danielle Hawkins]] soon launched a blog on Tumblr by the same name. Writing at ''[[The Root]]'', Diamond Sharp describes "carefree black girls" as an idea black women "have used...to anchor expressions of individuality and whimsy in the face of the heavy [[Stereotypes of African Americans|stereotypes]] and painful realities that too often color discussions of their demographic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sharp|first1=Diamond|title=Why Carefree Black Girls Are Here to Stay|url=http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2014/08/carefree_black_girls_how_the_hashtag_turned_into_a_movement/|accessdate=29 August 2016|work=The Root|date=August 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At ''[[Refinery29]]'', Jamala Johns said it was "a way to celebrate all things joyous and eclectic among brown ladies. Cultivated online and driven by social media, it's one telling piece of a much wider development of inspiration assembled by and for black women."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Johns|first1=Jamala|title=Carefree Black Girls - Solange, Janelle Monae|url=http://www.refinery29.com/2014/01/61614/carefree-black-girls|accessdate=29 August 2016|work=Refinery29|date=January 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At ''[[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]]'', Hillary Crosley Coker says "ladies like [[Chiara De Blasio|Chiara de Blasio]] (with her hippie flower headband), [[Solange Knowles|Solange [Knowles]]] and her eclectic style and [[Janelle Monáe|Janelle Monae]]'s [[Afrofuturism|futurism]] are their patron saints".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Coker|first1=Hillary Crosley|title=So, What's This 'Carefree Black Girl' Thing All About?|url=http://jezebel.com/so-whats-this-carefree-black-girl-thing-all-about-1513371610|accessdate=3 September 2016|work=Jezebel|date=January 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[The Root (magazine)|''The Root'']], Shamira Ibrahim connects the emergence of the "carefree black girl" concept to [[Black Girl Magic|"black girl magic"]], another concept first developed and diffused by black women on social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2016/03/why_i_m_over_the_carefree_black_girl_label/|title=Why I’m Over the ‘Carefree Black Girl’ Label|last=Shamira|first=Ibrahim|date=March 11, 2016|work=The Root|access-date=September 3, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Creative computing''' covers the interdisciplinary area at the cross-over of the [[creative arts]] and [[computing]]. Issues of [[creativity]] include [[knowledge discovery]], for example.&lt;ref name="yang15"&gt;{{cite book| doi=10.1007/978-3-319-23766-4_7 | chapter=Knowledge Discovery in Creative Computing for Creative Tasks | first1=Lu | last1=Zhang | first2=Hongji | last2=Yang | authorlink2=Hongji Yang | title=Creativity in Intelligent, Technologies and Data Science | volume=535 | publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | series=Communications in Computer and Information Science | pages=93–104 | year=2015 | isbn=978-3-319-23765-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Overview==
The ''International Journal of Creative Computing'' describes creative computing as follows:&lt;ref name="IJCrC"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.inderscience.com/ijcrc | title=International Journal of Creative Computing | publisher=[[Inderscience Publishers]] | accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Creative computing refers to a meta-technology to coalesce knowledge in computing and other disciplines.  People use computers as aids to  creativity and creative-computing topics may reshape the world as we know it. Applications are seen in [[arts]], [[entertainment]]/[[games]], [[mobile applications]], [[multimedia]], product/[[web design]] and other [[interactive system]]s.&lt;!-- ICRC aims to shape a significant body of creative computing research. --&gt;}}

Creative computing is [[interdisciplinary]] in nature and topics relating to it include [[Application software|applications]], [[Software development|development method]], [[evaluation]], [[Conceptual model|modeling]], [[philosophy]], [[principle]]s, [[Operating environment|support environment]], and [[theory]].&lt;ref name="IJCrC" /&gt;

The term "creative computing" is used both in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]] (e.g., at [[Harvard University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://scratched.gse.harvard.edu/guide/ | title=Creative Computing – An Introductory Computing Curriculum using Scratch | publisher=[[Harvard University]] | accessdate=24 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[MIT]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://cs4hs.media.mit.edu/ | title=Creative Computing | publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] | work=[[MIT Media Lab]] | accessdate=24 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Degree programmes==
A number of [[university degree]] programmes in Creative Computing exist, for example at:

The '''Dove Marine Laboratory''' is a research and teaching laboratory which forms part of the School of Marine Science and Technology within [[Newcastle University]] in the [[United Kingdom]].

== History ==
The original Laboratory was established in October 1897.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.twsitelines.info/smr/5058 |title=Tyne and Wear HER(5058): Cullercoats, Dove Marine Laboratory &amp; Salt Water Baths - Details |publisher=Sitelines |accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It comprised a small wooden hut sited next to the Saltwater Baths on [[Cullercoats]] Bay, and was used by [[Colleges of Durham University#Colleges in Newcastle|Armstrong College]] to study the waters of the north east [[Coastline of the United Kingdom|UK coastline]].

On the 28 March 1904 the Laboratory and Baths were destroyed by fire, but it was agreed that the work of the Laboratory should continue.  In 1906 the local landowner, geologist [[Wilfred Hudleston Hudleston|Wilfred Hudleston, FRS]], offered not only to make the site of the old Baths available for newer, larger, facilities, but also offered to finance their construction.  He was reluctant to publicise his generosity, and asked that the building be named after one of his ancestors, Eleanor Dove, when it was opened by the [[Henry Percy, 7th Duke of Northumberland|Duke of Northumberland]] on 29 September 1908. In 2008 the laboratory celebrated its centenary, where the current [[Ralph Percy, 12th Duke of Northumberland|Duke of Northumberland]] led festivities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncl.ac.uk/marine/about/facilities/dove/centenary/ |title=Centenary Celebration 2008 |publisher=Newcastle University Marine Biology |accessdate=2010-10-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519211325/http://www.ncl.ac.uk/marine/about/facilities/dove/centenary/ |archivedate=2011-05-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Laboratory became a department of Armstrong College when the building and land were purchased by the college following Hudleston's death in 1909, and soon grew in reputation, acquiring its first boat in 1911.  The Laboratory also operated a public aquarium and once housed the coble in which [[Grace Darling]] and her father rescued passengers from the [[Forfarshire (ship)|''SS Forfashire'']] in 1838.&lt;ref&gt;Whiting, C E (1932), ''[[The University of Durham]] 1832-1932'' London, The Sheldon Press&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967 responsibility for the Laboratory was transferred to [[Newcastle University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/tyne/content/articles/2008/09/25/dove_marine_laboratory_feature.shtml |title=Landmark for marine laboratory |date=1 October 2008 |publisher=[[BBC Tyne]] |accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Present Day ==

As a research facility the Laboratory is normally closed to the public, but holds open days during the summer months and as part of other events such as Cullercoats Harbour Day and Heritage Open Days.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.heritageopendays.org.uk/about&lt;/ref&gt;

A Marine Science distance learning course, Delve Deeper, run by the University includes a field course component based at the laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncl.ac.uk/nes/outreach/marine/courses/delvedeeper/#about&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1315">'''Ecorys''' is one of the oldest economic research and consulting companies in Europe. Its history dates back to 1929, when a group of businessmen from Rotterdam established the Foundation [[NEI: The Netherlands Economic Institute]]. The goal of the Foundation NEI was to stimulate the collection and the analysis of economic data. One of its first directors (1935-1968) was Professor [[Jan Tinbergen]], who was awarded the first [[Nobel Prize for Economics]] for his work in 1969. In 1999, NEI was split into a company, focusing on economic research &amp; consultancy, and a foundation with the aim to foster economic research. The company merged with Kolpron Consultants (established in 1979).

In 2000 Ecorys&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ecorys.com/&lt;/ref&gt; was created through the merger of the Dutch company NEI Kolpron with ECOTEC Research and Consulting, a UK-based company specializing in social policy. Ecorys internationalized further and today has offices in many European countries as well as in Russia, Turkey and India. It has close to 500 employees.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.linkedin.com/company/ecorys?trk=top_nav_home&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edgar Morin''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɔː|ˈ|r|æ|n}}; {{IPA-fr|mɔʁɛ̃|lang}}; born '''Edgar Nahoum''' on 8 July 1921) is a [[France|French]] [[philosopher]] and [[sociologist]] who has been internationally recognized for his work on complexity and "complex thought" ([[:fr:Pensée complexe|pensée complexe]]), and for his scholarly contributions to such diverse fields as media studies, politics, sociology, visual anthropology, ecology, education, and systems biology. He holds degrees in history, economics, and law. Though less well known in the United States due to the limited availability of English translations of his over 60 books, Morin is renowned in the French-speaking world, Europe, and Latin America.

== Biography ==
At the beginning of the 20th century, Morin's family migrated from the Greek city of [[Salonica]] (Thessaloniki) to [[Marseille]]&lt;ref&gt;Edgar Morin, Véronique Nahoum-Grappe, Haïm Vidal Sephiha (1989), ''Vidal et les siens'', Paris: Seuil.&lt;/ref&gt; and later to [[Paris]], where Edgar was born. He is of Judeo-Spanish ([[Sephardi Jews|Sefardi]]) origin.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

When the Germans invaded France in 1940, Morin assisted refugees and joined the French Resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morin|first1=Edgar|last2=Boukhardi|first2=Sophie|title=Talking to Edgar Morin: Defining dialogue|journal=UNESCO: The New Courier|date=January 2004|pages=8–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a member of the [[French Resistance]] he adopted the pseudonym ''Morin'', which he would use for the rest of his life. He joined the [[French Communist Party]] in 1941.

In 1945, Morin married Violette Chapellaubeau and they lived in [[Landau]], where he served as a lieutenant in the French Occupation army in Germany.

In 1946, he returned to Paris and gave up his military career to pursue his activities with the Communist Party. Due to his critical posture, his relationship with the party gradually deteriorated until he was expelled in 1951 after he published an article in ''[[Le Nouvel Observateur]]''. In the same year, he was admitted to the National Center of Scientific Research ([[CNRS]]).

Morin founded and directed the magazine ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Arguments (journal)|fr|3=Arguments|lt=Arguments}}'' (1954–1962). In 1959 his book ''Autocritique'' was published. The book was a sustained reflection on his adherence to, and subsequent exit from, the Communist Party, focusing on the dangers of ideology and self-deception.

In 1960, Morin travelled extensively in Latin America, visiting [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Bolivia]], [[Peru]] and [[Mexico]]. He returned to France, where he published ''L'Esprit du Temps'', a work on popular culture''.''

That same year, French sociologist [[Georges Friedmann]] brought him and [[Roland Barthes]] together to create a Centre for the Study of Mass Communication that, after several name changes, became the [[Edgar Morin Centre]] of the [[EHESS]], Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=iiac |title=Centre Edgar-Morin |url=http://www.iiac.cnrs.fr/cetsah/spip.php?article207 |accessdate=2010-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091023005003/http://www.iiac.cnrs.fr/cetsah/spip.php?article207 |archivedate=October 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1960 Morin and [[Jean Rouch]] coauthored the film [[Chronique d'un été]], an early example of ''[[cinéma vérité]]'' and [[Direct Cinema|direct cinema]].

Beginning in 1965, Morin became involved in a large multidisciplinary project, financed by the Délégation Générale à la Recherche Scientifique et Technologique in [[Plozévet]].

In 1968, Morin replaced [[Henri Lefebvre]] at the [[University of Paris X: Nanterre|University of Nanterre]]. He became involved in the student revolts that began to emerge in France. In May 1968 he wrote a series of articles for [[Le Monde]] that tried to understand what he called "The Student Commune." He followed [[May 1968 in France|the student revolt]] closely and wrote a second series of articles in Le Monde called "The Revolution without a Face," as well as coauthoring ''Mai 68: La brèche'' with [[Cornelius Castoriadis]] and [[Claude Lefort]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Van Herpen |first=Marcel |title =PARIS MAY '68 AND PROVO AMSTERDAM '65 |url =http://www.cicerofoundation.org/lectures/Marcel_Van_Herpen_May_68_and_Provo_Amsterdam_65.pdf | pages=19 |accessdate =2010-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, Morin spent a year at the [[Salk Institute|Salk Institute for Biological Studies]] in [[La Jolla]], California. [[Jonas Salk]] invited him under the recommendation of [[Jacques Monod]] and John Hunt, with the sole imposed condition of learning. It was there, in this "breeding ground for Nobel Prizes" that he familiarized himself with systems theory. He read [[Henri Laborit]], [[James Watson]], [[Stéphane Lupasco]], [[Bronowski]], and was introduced to the thought of [[Gregory Bateson]] and the "new problematic in ecology".&lt;ref&gt;"Penser avec Edgar Morin, Lire La Méthode", Robin Fortin, Presses de l'Université Laval.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983 he published ''De la nature de l’URSS,'' which deepened his analysis of Soviet communism and anticipated the [[perestroika]] of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]].

In 2002 Morin participated in the creation of the [[Collegium International|International Ethical, Scientific and Political Collegium]]. Also that year, he made a trip to Iran with Dariush Shayegan.

==Work==
In addition to being the [[UNESCO]] Chair of Complex Thought, Morin is known as a founder of [[transdisciplinarity]] and holds honorary doctorates in a variety of social science fields from 21 universities (Messina, Geneva, Milan, Bergamo, Thessaloniki, La Paz, Odense, Perugia, Cosenza, Palermo, Nuevo León, Université de Laval à Québec, Brussels, Barcelona, Guadalajara, Valencia, Vera Cruz, Santiago, the Catholic University of Porto Alegre, the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte, and Candido Mendes University (Rio de Janeiro)).&lt;ref name=Montuori&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Montuori|first1=Alfonso|title=COMPLEX THOUGHT An Overview of Edgar Morin's Intellectual Journey|journal=MetaIntegral Foundation|date=June 2013|volume=Resource Paper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Messina]] in Sicily, Ricardo Palma University in Lima, and the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)]], the French National Research Center in Paris, have established research centers based on his transdisciplinary methods and philosophy.&lt;ref name=Montuori/&gt; In addition, the [[Multiversidad Mundo Real Edgar Morin]], a university based on his work, was established in Mexico. Morin did not embrace the French [[Postmodern philosophy|postmodern]] or [[poststructuralist]] movements, instead pursuing his own research agenda. As a result, US academics did not transport his theories into disciplinary discourses in same fashion as they did Foucault's and Derrida's. Morin's work spans scholarly and popular literature, and he has appeared on the cover of multiple publications including [http://www.scienceshumaines.com/edgar-morin-l-aventure-d-une-pensee_fr_497.htm Sciences Humaines] and a special issue of [http://boutique.lemonde.fr/le-monde-hors-serie-edgar-morin.html Le Monde].

According to Alfonso Montuori in "Edgar Morin: A partial introduction" &lt;blockquote&gt; "The 6 volume Method is perhaps Morin’s culminating work, a remarkable and seemingly inexhaustible treasure trove of insights, reflection, and a real manual for those who are interested in broadening the nature of human inquiry. Drawing on [[cybernetics]], [[information theory]], [[systems theory]], but also integrating all the work he has done before, from the work on imagination in his research on movies to his profound reflections on death, Method integrates Morin’s journey and provides the reader with an alternative to the traditional assumptions and method of inquiry of our time."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1481">'''Empirical legal studies''' ('''ELS''') is an approach to the study of [[law]], [[legal procedure]], and [[legal theory]] through the use of [[empirical]] research. Empirical legal researchers use research techniques that are typical of [[economics]], [[psychology]], and [[sociology]]; however, ELS research tends to be more focused on purely legal questions than the related fields of [[law and economics]], [[legal psychology]], and [[sociology of law]].  ELS also tends to be more narrowly quantitative than fields such as [[Law and Society Association|law-and-society]] or [[new legal realism]] (NLR), which embrace [[Qualitative research|qualitative]] and [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] [[Social science|social science methods]], as well as [[Multimethodology|mixed method]] approaches.

In 2004, the ''[[Journal of Empirical Legal Studies]]'' was launched by the [[Society for Empirical Legal Studies]] and [[Cornell Law School]], and within three years rose to be ranked 28th of the over 800 US law journals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawlib.wlu.edu/LJ/index.aspx Law Journals: Submission and Ranking] Ranking of US Law journals by impact factor, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''experience model''' is a description of a typical user’s [[perception]] or [[understanding]] of how a system works. 

==Models==
Experience models are visually represented by abstract [[diagram]]s or [[metaphor]]s drawn from familiar objects, behaviors or systems. [[User interface]]s implement a variety of experience models to enable users to quickly grasp what is happening in the system, where the user is, and what the user can do next.

A [[software]] experience model may represent the relationship of one [[Software application|application]] to another, an application in relationship to various [[navigation]] mechanisms and other system or application components.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5898">In [[sociology]], '''feminization''' is the shift in [[gender role]]s and [[sex role]]s in a society, group, or organization towards a focus upon the [[feminine]]. It can also mean the incorporation of women into a group or a profession that was once dominated by men. &lt;ref name="douglas"&gt;Ann Douglas (1977). ''The Feminization of American Culture''. Farrar, Straus and Giroux {{ISBN|0-374-52558-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential examples of feminization in society==
* Feminization of education – Majority female teachers, a female majority of students in higher education and a curriculum which is better suited to the learning process of women.&lt;ref&gt;Carole Leathwood, Barbara Read, 'Gender and the Changing Face of Higher Education: A Feminized Future?', Open University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-335-22714-3}}, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Feminization of the workplace — Lower paying female-dominated occupations such as; (1) food preparation, food-serving and other food-related occupations, and (2) personal care and service. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Snarr, C. Melissa. “Women's Working Poverty: Feminist and Religious Alliances in the Living Wage Movement.” Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion, vol. 27, no. 1, 2011, pp. 75–93. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/10.2979/jfemistudreli.27.1.75.&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Introduction of feminization ==
Defining the term "feminization" can be complicated due to its meaning being unstable, as it can be portrayed as either a social process or as a critique of a process. Feminization has two basic meanings. The first concerns a person who was not initially feminine but becomes feminine later in their life through the perceptions of both the individual and those around them. According to gender theorist [[Judith Butler]], a person's gender is not solely an act of will or self-description, as it is also shaped by the people who describe, categorize, and treat the person according to their own perceptions of their gender. The second meaning of the term feminization describes when a person who originally had feminine qualities begins to incorporate more feminine attributes into their personality in some way, shape, or form. The term has often been used to describe females, however over time it shifted to where the term can be used to describe the process of someone or something becoming more feminine by adopting feminine qualities.&lt;ref name="Myth"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Imhoff | first = Sarah | title = The myth of American Jewish feminization | journal = Jewish Social Studies | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 126&amp;ndash;152 | publisher = [[Indiana University Press]] | doi = 10.2979/jewisocistud.21.3.05 | jstor = 10.2979/jewisocistud.21.3.05 | date = Spring–Summer 2016 | url = https://scholarworks.iu.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/2022/21871/The%20Myth%20of%20American%20Jewish%20Feminization.pdf?sequence=1 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Feminization of poverty ==
Women are more likely than men to live below the poverty line, a phenomenon known as the feminization of poverty. The 2015 poverty rates for men and women in the U.S. were 10% and 15% respectively. Women are less likely to pursue advanced degrees  and tend to have low paying jobs. It has been argued that even with the same level of education and occupational role, women earn much less than men,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/followup/session/presskit/fs1.htm|title=Beijing +5 – Women 2000: Gender Equality, Development and Peace for the 21st Century Twenty-third special session of the General Assembly, 5-9 June 2000|website=www.un.org|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; although other sources have disputed the idea of a wage gap in American society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/harvard-prof.-takes-down-gender-wage-gap-myth/article/2580405|title=Harvard prof. takes down gender wage gap myth|last=Schow|first=Ashe|website=The Washington Examiner|date=January 13, 2016|accessdate=May 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Feminization of the labor force ==
Feminization of the labor force in present day associations is inescapable in that females make up half of the labor force and the revelation of them as a potential profitable asset.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.in/anisha-motwani/the-feminization-of-workp_b_8258716.html|title=Why The Feminisation Of The Workplace Is Good News For Everyone|work=Huffington Post India|access-date=2017-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Post war there has been almost a movement of women flowing into the workforce in the North America and Europe economies with women making considerable advances in balancing the workforce when comparing women and men's job status and pay rates. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/1320929|title=Feminization of the labor force : paradoxes and promises in SearchWorks catalog|website=searchworks.stanford.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Feminization and the living wage movement ==
Feminists of the modern day living wage movement began in Baltimore, Maryland in the early 1990's right in the very heart and depths of the struggling urban poor. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Around this same time, Baltimore churches became involved in providing the poor with needed social services. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Even though national prosperity and rising stock markets seemed to be showing growth, more and more full-time workers were relying on soup kitchens, low-income housing assistance, and thrift store purchases for clothing. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Their jobs did not pay enough to keep families above the poverty line. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Whole communities became known as the "working poverty."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Ḥassan al-Kettani''' ({{lang-ar|حسن الكتاني}}; born 16 August 1972 in [[Salé]]) is a Muslim preacher and former political prisoner from Morocco. He was imprisoned for alleged connections to the [[2003 Casablanca bombings]], Kettani was pardoned by [[Mohammed VI]] eight years later after efforts by his lawyer, human rights groups and Islamists success in Morocco's parliament.

==Personal life==
The Kettani family has historically been a part of Morocco's religious establishment, serving as both academics and preachers for centuries. He is the great grandson of [[Muḥammad ibn Jaʿfar al-Kattānī]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKHIbdaqeTo&lt;/ref&gt; Kettani was as student of fellow Moroccan cleric [[Muhammad Abu Khubza]] in addition to [[Abdullah al-Ghumari]] and [[Abd al-Aziz al-Ghumari]], as well as Albanian cleric [[Abdul Qader Arnaoot]].&lt;ref name=cord&gt;[http://www.cordobaacademy.com/about/faculty Cordoba Academy Faculty] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126062931/http://cordobaacademy.com/about/faculty |date=2013-01-26 }}, © 2012 Cordoba Academy. Accessed February 17, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; His family descends from the Islamic [[Prophets in Islam|prophet]] [[Muhammad]]'s grandson, [[Hasan ibn Ali]].{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

==Sentencing==
On February 18, 2003, Kettani was arrested by Moroccan authorities.&lt;ref name=pushing&gt;Ilhem Rachidi, [http://www.atimes/atimes/Front_Page/GG01Aa01.html Pushing Islam to the extremes] at [[Asia Times Online]]. July 1, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; On September 23, he was sentenced to 20 years in prison in connection with the [[2003 Casablanca bombings]], for which authorities accused him of being an ideological leader. Kettani denied this and asserted that his conviction was politically motivated and illegal. Human rights groups criticized his sentencing as unfair.&lt;ref name=reflect&gt;Mohamed Saadouni, [http://www.magharebia.com/cocoon/awi/xhtml1/en_GB/features/awi/features/2012/06/12/feature-02 Moroccan cheikhs reflect on Tunisia deportation] for Magharebia. June 12, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=euro&gt;Naoufel Cherkaoui, [http://www.eurasiareview.com/28022012-morocco-royal-pardon-marks-new-approach-to-salafi-issue/ Royal Pardon Marks New Approach To Salafi Issue] at the Eurasia Review. February 28, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2005, he and 664 other Islamists began a hunger strike in prison to protest their convictions.&lt;ref name=pushing/&gt; Moroccan politician [[Mohamed Bouzoubaa]] criticized the move as being more concerned with politics than human rights, though Kettani's lawyer [[Mustafa Ramid]] upheld that he and other Islamists were victims of unjust trials. A second hunger strike took place at the prison in [[Kenitra]] in 2010 though most detainees ceased after negotiations with authorities; Kettani continued the strike longer than all other detainees, continuing to uphold his innocence and demand a reopening of his case.&lt;ref&gt;Mawassi Lahcen, [http://www.magharebia.com/cocoon/awi/xhtml1/en_GB/features/awi/features/2010/01/06/feature-01 Casablanca prisoners end hunger strike] for Magharebia. June 1, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 5, 2012, [[Mohammed VI of Morocco]] pardoned Kettani along with other Islamists whom human rights groups believed had been unfairly jailed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2012/02/26006/morocco-king-pardons-jailed-islamist-leaders/ Morocco king pardons jailed Islamist leaders] at Morocco World News. [[Reuters]] reporting in [[Rabat]], February 5th, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Kettani's lawyer Ramid, who later became Morocco's Minister of Justice, referred to the pardon as an attempt by the government to hold out the olive branch for Islamists willing to make positive contributions to public life and shun extremism, comments with which Kettani concurred.&lt;ref name=euro/&gt;&lt;ref name=recon&gt;Mohamed Saadouni, [http://www.magharebia.com/cocoon/awi/xhtml1/en_GB/features/awi/reportage/2012/05/18/reportage-01 Morocco pursues salafist reconciliation] for Magharebia. May 18, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-release==
Since his pardon, Kettani has denounced extremism and encouraged its rejection among Moroccan conservatives; regardless, he and another Islamist were deported upon arrival at [[Tunis–Carthage International Airport]] on May 14, 2012.&lt;ref name=reflect/&gt;&lt;ref name=recon/&gt; Kettani, who had been invited to the country by Tunisian Islamists, claimed he was under the impression that he would be able to enter [[Tunisia]] freely after the [[Tunisian revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Houda Trabelsi, [http://www.magharebia.com/cocoon/awi/xhtml1/en_GB/features/awi/features/2012/05/18/feature-01 Tunisia denies entry to Moroccan salafists] by Magharebia. May 18, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his deportation, Kettani still praised the Tunisian airport security, claiming that he had been treated well by the authorities and even received an apology from [[Ennahda Movement]] officials before his deportation.&lt;ref name=reflect/&gt;

==Views==
Kettani has been described as an ideological leader of the [[Salafia Jihadia]] movement, though he and other detainees rejected this and saw themselves as normal Sunni Muslims with a Salafist orientation.&lt;ref name=james&gt;Alison Pargeter, [http://www.jamestown.org/programs/gta/single/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=483&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=180&amp;no_cache=1 The Islamist Movement in Morocco]. [[The Jamestown Foundation]], May 23, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Since his pardon he has openly criticized what he defines as [[Wahhabism]], comments which have caused rifts among Moroccan Salafists.

An '''Information School''' (sometimes abbreviated '''I-school''' or '''iSchool''') is a [[university]]-level institution committed to understanding the role of [[information]] in nature and human endeavors. Synonyms include "School of Information", "Department of Information Studies", or "Information Department". Information Schools [[Faculty (academic staff)|faculty]] conduct research into the fundamental aspects of information and [[Information technology|related technologies]].  In addition to granting [[academic degree]]s, information schools educate information professionals, researchers, and scholars for an [[Information revolution|increasingly information-driven world]]. 

Information school can also refer, in a more restricted sense, to the [[List of Information Schools|members of the iSchools organization]] (formerly the "iSchools Project"), as governed by the iCaucus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ischools.org/site/about_icaucus/ About the iCaucus, governing body of the iSchools] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928172227/http://www.ischools.org/site/about_icaucus/ |date=2011-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ischools.org/site/ischoolsnews_article/the_ischools_welcome_nanjing_and_tampere_as_new_additions_now_boast_33_memb/ The iSchools Welcome Nanjing and Tampere as New Additions; Now Boast 33 Members Worldwide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111204074445/http://www.ischools.org/site/ischoolsnews_article/the_ischools_welcome_nanjing_and_tampere_as_new_additions_now_boast_33_memb/ |date=2011-12-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of this group share a fundamental interest in the relationships between people, information, technology, and science.  These schools, colleges, and departments have been either newly established or have evolved from programs focused on [[information systems]], [[library science]], [[Informatics (academic field)|informatics]], [[computer science]], [[library and information science]] and [[information science]].
 
Information schools promote an interdisciplinary approach to understanding the opportunities and challenges of [[information management]], with a core commitment to concepts like [[Universal design|universal access]] and [[User-centered design|user-centered]] organization of information. The field is concerned broadly with questions of design and preservation across information spaces, from digital and virtual spaces like online communities, the World Wide Web, and databases to physical spaces such as libraries, museums, archives, and other repositories. Information school degree programs include course offerings in areas such as  [[information architecture]], [[Information design|design]],  [[Information economics|economics]], [[Information policy|policy]], [[Information retrieval|retrieval]], [[Information security|security]], and [[telecommunication]]s; [[knowledge management]], [[user experience design]], and [[usability]]; [[Conservation-restoration|conservation]] and [[Preservation (library and archival science)|preservation]], including [[digital preservation]]; librarianship and [[Library management|library administration]]; the [[Information society|sociology of information]]; and [[human–computer interaction]].

The '''Istanbul Center for Mathematical Sciences''' ('''IMBM''') is an independent center for mathematics situated in the South Campus of [[Boğaziçi University]], [[Istanbul]], in close proximity to the Mathematics  Department. The center was initiated by several major universities in Istanbul and was formally inaugurated in 2006. The center aims to host and encourage the mathematical research and the interaction of researchers.

==Background==
IMBM is currently the only center for mathematics in Turkey. The first idea was brought by Betül Tanbay in 2003, then the chairwoman of the Mathematics Department of Boğaziçi University to its rector Sabih Tansal who immediately allocated a site. The center was opened in 2006 by the rectors of three leading universities in Istanbul, Boğaziçi University (state), [[Koç University]] (private) and [[Sabancı University]] (private). At that time, the three rectors were all mathematicians ([[Ayşe Soysal]], [[Atilla Aşkar]] and [[Tosun Terzioğlu]] respectively) which made the contract easier. The universities ensured to give academic and from time to time small amounts of financial support (an account of the history can be found in [[Newsletter of the European Mathematical Society|EMS Newsletter]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ems-ph.org/journals/newsletter/pdf/2010-09-77.pdf  | title = EMS Newsletter September 2010, page 49}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

IMBM is administrated by a management committee, a scientific steering committee, and an international scientific advisory board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.imbm.org.tr/governance.htm  | title = IMBM Governance Page}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific advisory board consists of the following mathematicians: [[David Mumford]] (Brown and Harvard Universities), 
[[Victor Kac]] (MIT),
[[Selman Akbulut]]  (Michigan State University),
[[Gilles Pisier]] (Paris 6 and Texas A&amp;M ),
[[Edriss Titi]]  (Weizmann Institute and University of California Irvine).

David Mumford accepted to participate in the Scientific Advisory Board during his visit to Turkey back in 2003. He has reported his personal observations in Notices of the AMS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ams.org/notices/200505/comm-mumford.pdf  | title = David Mumford's observations in Notices of the AMS, Volume 52 Number 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opening seminar of IMBM was delivered by [[Dan Goldston]], [[János Pintz]] and [[Cem Yalçın Yıldırım]] in 2006. Since then, the center hosted many activities with distinguished participants.

Resources of IMBM come from endowment income, personal and institutional grants and collaboration agreements and gifts.

== Buildings==
There are two buildings of the center. Both have an excellent view of the [[Bosphorus]] strait. The buildings had been in very bad condition and were brought to life by the initiative of Betül Tanbay (Boğaziçi University Mathematics Department), the first codirector of IMBM. The first floor of the main building consists of three offices with a modest library and computers. A 40-person seminar room is on the second floor.

There are four bedrooms of the center, accommodating up to six people. Two bedrooms are located in the last floor of the main building. The other two are located in a self-contained one-storey house next to the main building, which has, besides, a kitchen and a living room.

'''Landscape ecology''' is the science of studying and improving relationships between ecological processes in the environment and particular ecosystems. This is done within a variety of landscape scales, development spatial patterns, and organizational levels of research and policy.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, J. 2006. Cross-disciplinarity, landscape ecology, and [[sustainability science]]. Landscape Ecology 21:1-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wu-2007"&gt;Wu, J. and R. Hobbs (Eds). 2007. Key Topics in Landscape Ecology. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wu, J. 2008. Landscape ecology. In: S. E. Jorgensen (ed), Encyclopedia of Ecology. Elsevier, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a highly interdisciplinary field in [[systems science]], landscape ecology integrates [[biophysical]] and [[Analytic induction|analytical]] approaches with [[humanistic]] and [[holistic]] perspectives across the [[natural sciences]] and [[social sciences]].  Landscapes are spatially heterogeneous geographic areas characterized by diverse interacting patches or ecosystems, ranging from relatively natural terrestrial and aquatic systems such as forests, grasslands, and lakes to human-dominated environments including agricultural and urban settings.&lt;ref name="wu-2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner-2001"&gt;Turner, M.G., R. H. Gardner and R. V. O'Neill 2001.  Landscape Ecology in Theory and Practice.  Springer-Verlag, New York, NY, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Forman-1995"&gt;Forman, R.T.T. 1995.  Land Mosaics: The Ecology of Landscapes and Regions.  Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;  The most salient characteristics of landscape ecology are its emphasis on the relationship among pattern, process and scale, and its focus on broad-scale ecological and environmental issues. These necessitate the coupling between biophysical and socioeconomic sciences.  Key research topics in landscape ecology include ecological flows in landscape mosaics, land use and land cover change, scaling, relating landscape pattern analysis with ecological processes, and landscape conservation and [[sustainability]].&lt;ref&gt;Wu &amp; Hobbs 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==

The German term ''Landschaftsökologie''–thus ''landscape ecology''–was coined by German [[Geography|geographer]] [[Carl Troll]] in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Troll, C. 1939. Luftbildplan und ökologische Bodenforschung (Aerial photography and ecological studies of the earth).  Zeitschrift der Gesellschaft für Erdkunde, Berlin: 241-298.&lt;/ref&gt;  He developed this terminology and many early concepts of landscape ecology as part of his early work, which consisted of applying aerial photograph interpretation to studies of interactions between environment and vegetation.

== Explanation ==
Heterogeneity is the measure of how parts of a landscape differ from one another.  Landscape ecology looks at how this spatial structure affects organism abundance at the landscape level, as well as the behavior and functioning of the landscape as a whole.  This includes studying the influence of pattern, or the internal order of a landscape, on process, or the continuous operation of functions of organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, M.G.  1989.  Landscape ecology: the effect of pattern on process. Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics 20:171-197.&lt;/ref&gt;  Landscape ecology also includes geomorphology as applied to the design and architecture of landscapes.&lt;ref name="Allaby-1998"&gt;Allaby, M. 1998.  Oxford Dictionary of Ecology.  Oxford University Press, New York, NY.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Geomorphology]] is the study of how geological formations are responsible for the structure of a landscape.

==History==

=== Evolution of theory ===
One central landscape ecology theory originated from [[Robert MacArthur|MacArthur]] &amp; [[Edward Osborne Wilson|Wilson's]] ''[[The Theory of Island Biogeography]]''.  This work considered the biodiversity on islands as the result of competing forces of colonization from a mainland stock and [[stochastic]] [[extinction]].  The concepts of [[island biogeography]] were generalized from physical islands to abstract patches of [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] by Levins' [[metapopulation]] model (which can be applied e.g. to forest islands in the agricultural landscape&lt;ref&gt;Banaszak J. (ed.) 2000. Ecology of Forest Islands. Bydgoszcz University Press, Bydgoszcz, Poland, 313 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;).  This generalization spurred the growth of landscape ecology by providing [[conservation biology|conservation biologists]] a new tool to assess how [[habitat fragmentation]] affects population viability.  Recent growth of landscape ecology owes much to the development of [[geographic information system]]s (GIS)&lt;ref name="sstein-2009"&gt;Steiniger, S., and Hay, G.J. 2009. Free and Open Source Geographic Information Tools for Landscape Ecology. Ecological Informatics 4(4): 183-195. [http://sourceforge.net/projects/jump-pilot/files/w_other_freegis_documents/articles/sstein_freegitools_ecoinf2009.pdf/download preprint]&lt;/ref&gt; and the availability of large-extent habitat data (e.g. [[remote sensing|remotely sensed]] datasets).

=== Development as a discipline ===
Landscape ecology developed in [[Europe]] from historical planning on human-dominated landscapes.  Concepts from general ecology theory were integrated in [[North America]].{{when|date=May 2014}}  While general ecology theory and its sub-disciplines focused on the study of more homogenous, discrete community units organized in a hierarchical structure (typically as [[ecosystem]]s, [[population]]s, [[species]], and communities), landscape ecology built upon heterogeneity in space and time. It frequently included human-caused landscape changes in theory and application of concepts.&lt;ref name="Sanderson-2000"&gt;Sanderson, J. and L. D. Harris (eds.).  2000.  Landscape Ecology: A Top-Down Approach.  Lewis Publishers, Boca Raton, Florida, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1980, landscape ecology was a discrete, established discipline. It was marked by the organization of the [http://www.landscape-ecology.org/ International Association for Landscape Ecology] (IALE) in 1982.  Landmark book publications defined the scope and goals of the discipline, including Naveh and Lieberman&lt;ref name="Naveh-1984"&gt;Naveh, Z. and A. Lieberman.  1984.  Landscape ecology: theory and application.  Springer-Verlag, New York, NY, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; and Forman and Godron.&lt;ref name="Forman-1986"&gt;Forman, R.T.T. and M. Godron.  1986. Landscape Ecology.  John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York, NY, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ryszkowski-2002"&gt;Ryszkowski, L. (ed.).  2002.  Landscape Ecology in Agroecosystems Management.  CRC Press, Boca Raton, Florida, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;  Forman&lt;ref name="Forman-1995"/&gt; wrote that although study of "the ecology of spatial configuration at the human scale" was barely a decade old, there was strong potential for theory development and application of the conceptual framework.  Today, theory and application of landscape ecology continues to develop through a need for innovative applications in a changing landscape and environment.  Landscape ecology relies on advanced technologies such as remote sensing, GIS, and [[computer simulation|models]].  There has been associated development of powerful quantitative methods to examine the interactions of patterns and processes.&lt;ref name="Turner-2001"/&gt;  An example would be determining the amount of [[carbon cycle|carbon]] present in the [[soil]] based on landform over a landscape, derived from GIS maps, [[vegetation]] types, and [[rainfall]] data for a region.

=== Definitions/conceptions of landscape ecology ===
Nowadays, at least six different conceptions of landscape ecology can be identified: one group tending toward the more disciplinary concept of [[ecology]] (subdiscipline of [[biology]]; in conceptions 2, 3, and 4) and another group—characterized by the [[interdisciplinary]] study of relations between human societies and their environment—inclined toward the [[Integrated geography|integrated]] view of [[geography]] (in conceptions 1, 5, and 6):&lt;ref&gt;Kirchhoff, T.; Trepl, L. &amp; Vicenzotti, V. 2012: ''What is landscape ecology? An analysis and evaluation of six different conceptions''. Landscape Research 2012, online first, DOI:10.1080/01426397.2011.640751. All the following quotations and descriptions come from this source.&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Interdisciplinary scientific analysis of subjectively defined landscape units'' (e.g. [[Ernst Neef|Neef]] School&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Neef, E. 1967: Die theoretischen Grundlagen der Landschaftslehre. Gotha: Haack; Haase, G. 1990: Approaches to, and methods of landscape diagnosis as a basis of landscape planning and landscape management. Ekológia 9(1): 31-44.&lt;/ref&gt;):  Landscapes are defined in terms of uniformity in land use. Landscape ecology explores the landscape's natural potential in terms of functional utility for human societies. To analyse this potential, it is necessary to draw on several natural sciences.
# ''Topological ecology at the landscape scale'' (e.g. Forman &amp; Godron&lt;ref&gt;Forman, R.T.T. &amp; Godron, M. 1981: Patches and structural components for a landscape ecology. BioScience 31(10): 733-740; Forman, R.T.T. &amp; Godron, M. 1986: Landscape ecology. Wiley, NY.&lt;/ref&gt;):  'Landscape' is defined as a heterogeneous land area composed of a cluster of interacting ecosystems (woods, meadows, marshes, villages, etc.) that is repeated in similar form throughout.  It is explicitly stated that landscapes are areas at a kilometres wide ''human scale'' of perception, modification, etc.  Landscape ecology describes and explains the landscapes' characteristic patterns of ecosystems and investigates the flux of energy, mineral nutrients, and species among their component ecosystems, providing important knowledge for addressing land-use issues.
# ''Organism-centred, multi-scale topological ecology'' (e.g. [[John A. Wiens]]&lt;ref&gt;Wiens, J.A. &amp; Milne, B.T. 1989: Scaling of 'landscapes' in landscape ecology, or, landscape ecology from the beetle's perspective. Landscape Ecology 3(2): 87-96; Wiens, J. A. 1999: The science and practice of landscape ecology. In: Klopatek, J.M. &amp; Gardner, R.H. (eds): Landscape ecological analyses: Issues and applications. Springer, NY: 371-383.&lt;/ref&gt;):  Explicitly rejecting views expounded by Troll, Zonneveld, Naveh, Forman &amp; Godron, etc., landscape and landscape ecology are defined independently of human perceptions, interests, and modifications of nature. 'Landscape' is defined – regardless of scale – as the 'template' on which spatial patterns influence ecological processes.  Not humans, but rather the respective species being studied is the point of reference for what constitutes a landscape.
# ''Topological ecology at the landscape level of biological organisation'' (e.g. Urban et al.&lt;ref&gt;Urban, D.L.; O'Neill, R.V. &amp; Shugart, H.H., Jr. 1987: Landscape ecology. A hierarchical perspective can help scientists understand spatial patterns. BioScience 37(2): 119-127.&lt;/ref&gt;):  On the basis of ecological hierarchy theory, it is presupposed that nature is working at multiple scales and has different levels of organisation which are part of a rate-structured, nested hierarchy. Specifically, it is claimed that, above the ecosystem level, a landscape level exists which is generated and identifiable by high interaction intensity between ecosystems, a specific interaction frequency and, typically, a corresponding spatial scale. Landscape ecology is defined as ecology that focuses on the influence exerted by spatial and temporal patterns on the organisation of, and interaction among, functionally integrated multispecies ecosystems.
# ''Analysis of social-ecological systems using the natural and social sciences and humanities'' (e.g. Leser;&lt;ref&gt;Leser, H. 1991: Landschaftsökologie. Ansatz, Modelle, Methodik, Anwendung. Ulmer, Stuttgart.&lt;/ref&gt; Naveh;&lt;ref&gt;Naveh, Z. &amp; Lieberman, A.S. 1984: Landscape ecology. Theory and application. Springer, NY; Naveh, N. 2000: What is holistic landscape ecology? A conceptual introduction. Landscape and Urban Planning 50(1-3): 7-26.&lt;/ref&gt; Zonneveld&lt;ref&gt;Zonneveld, I.S. 1995: Land ecology: an introduction to landscape ecology as a base for land evaluation, land management and conservation. SPB, Amsterdam.&lt;/ref&gt;):  Landscape ecology is defined as an interdisciplinary super-science that explores the relationship between human societies and their specific environment, making use of not only various natural sciences, but also social sciences and humanities. This conception is grounded in the assumption that social systems are linked to their specific ambient ecological system in such a way that both systems together form a co-evolutionary, self-organising unity called 'landscape'. Societies' cultural, social and economic dimensions are regarded as an integral part of the global ecological hierarchy, and landscapes are claimed to be the manifest systems of the 'Total Human Ecosystem' (Naveh) which encompasses both the physical ('geospheric') and mental ('noospheric') spheres.
# ''Ecology guided by cultural meanings of lifeworldly landscapes'' (frequently pursued in practice&lt;ref&gt;However, not always under the designation 'landscape ecology', but as part of landscape stewardship, landscape architecture and, first and foremost, environmental or urban and landscape planning.&lt;/ref&gt; but not defined, but see, e.g., Hard;&lt;ref&gt;Hard, G. 1973: Die Geographie. Eine wissenschaftstheoretische Einführung. deGruyter, Berlin: 92-95.&lt;/ref&gt; Trepl&lt;ref&gt;Kirchhoff, T.; Trepl, L. &amp; Vicenzotti, V. 2012: What is landscape ecology? An analysis and evaluation of six different conceptions. Landscape Research 2012, online first, DOI:10.1080/01426397.2011.640751.&lt;/ref&gt;):  Landscape ecology is defined as ecology that is guided by an external aim, namely, to maintain and develop [[lifeworld]]ly [[landscapes]]. It provides the ecological knowledge necessary to achieve these goals. It investigates how to sustain and develop those populations and ecosystems which (i) are the material 'vehicles' of lifeworldly, aesthetic and symbolic landscapes and, at the same time, (ii) meet societies' functional requirements, including provisioning, regulating, and supporting [[ecosystem services]]. Thus landscape ecology is concerned mainly with the populations and ecosystems which have resulted from traditional, regionally specific forms of land use.

== Relationship to ecological theory ==
Some research programmes of landscape ecology theory, namely those standing in the European tradition, may be slightly outside of the "classical and preferred domain of scientific disciplines" because of the large, heterogeneous areas of study. However, general [[ecology theory]] is central to landscape ecology theory in many aspects.  Landscape ecology consists of four main principles: the development and dynamics of spatial heterogeneity, interactions and exchanges across heterogeneous landscapes, influences of spatial heterogeneity on biotic and [[abiotic]] processes, and the management of spatial heterogeneity.  The main difference from traditional ecological studies, which frequently assume that systems are spatially homogenous, is the consideration of [[spatial pattern]]s.&lt;ref name="Turner-1991"&gt;Turner, M.G. and R. H. Gardner (eds.).  1991.  Quantitative Methods in Landscape Ecology.  Springer-Verlag, New York, NY, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Important terms ==
Landscape ecology not only created new terms, but also incorporated existing ecological terms in new ways.  Many of the terms used in landscape ecology are as interconnected and interrelated as the discipline itself.

=== Landscape ===
{{Main|Landscape}}

Certainly, 'landscape' is a central concept in landscape ecology. It is, however, defined in quite different ways. For example:&lt;ref&gt;Kirchhoff, T., Trepl, L. and V. Vicenzotti, V. 2012: What is landscape ecology? An analysis and evaluation of six different conceptions. Landscape Research online first.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Carl Troll]] conceives of landscape not as a mental construct but as an objectively given 'organic entity', a ''harmonic individuum of space''.&lt;ref&gt;Troll, C. 2007: The geographic landscape and its investigation. In: Wiens, J.A., Moss, M.R., Turner, M.G. &amp; Mladenoff, D.J. (eds): Foundation papers in landscape ecology. New York, Columbia University Press:71–101 [First published as: Troll, C. 1950: Die geographische Landschaft und ihre Erforschung. Studium Generale 3(4/5):163–181].&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Ernst Neef]]&lt;ref&gt;Neef, E. 1967: Die theoretischen Grundlagen der Landschaftslehre. Haack, Gotha; cf. Haase, G. and H. Richter 1983: Current trends in landscape research. GeoJournal 7(2):107–119.&lt;/ref&gt; defines landscapes as sections within the uninterrupted earth-wide interconnection of geofactors which are defined as such on the basis of their uniformity in terms of a specific land use, and are thus defined in an anthropocentric and relativistic way.
According to [[Richard Forman]] and [[Michael Godron]],&lt;ref&gt;Forman, R.T.T. and M. Godron, M. 1981: Patches and structural components for a landscape ecology. BioScience 31(10):733–740; Forman, R.T.T. and M. Godron 1986: Landscape ecology. Wiley, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; a landscape is a heterogeneous land area composed of a cluster of interacting ecosystems that is repeated in similar form throughout, whereby they list woods, meadows, marshes and villages as examples of a landscape's ecosystems, and state that a landscape is an area at least a few kilometres wide. 
[[John A. Wiens]]&lt;ref&gt;Wiens, J.A. and B.T. Milne, B.T. 1989: Scaling of 'landscapes' in landscape ecology, or, landscape ecology from the beetle's perspective. Landscape Ecology 3(2):87–96; Wiens, J.A.: The science and practice of landscape ecology. In: Klopatek, J.M. and R.H. Gardner (eds) 1999: Landscape ecological analyses: issues and applications. Springer, New York:371–383.&lt;/ref&gt; opposes the traditional view expounded by [[Carl Troll]], Isaak S. Zonneveld, Zev Naveh, Richard T. T. Forman/Michel Godron and others that landscapes are arenas in which humans interact with their environments on a kilometre-wide scale; instead, he defines 'landscape'—regardless of scale—as "the template on which spatial patterns influence ecological processes".&lt;ref&gt;Wiens, J.A. 1999: The science and practice of landscape ecology. In: Klopatek, J.M. and R.H. Gardner (eds): Landscape ecological analyses: issues and applications. Springer, New York:371–383; cf. Wiens, J.A. 2005: ''Toward a unified landscape ecology''. In: Wiens, J.A. and M.R. Moss (eds): Issues and perspectives in landscape ecology. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge:365–373.&lt;/ref&gt;
Some define 'landscape' as an area containing two or more [[ecosystem]]s in close proximity.&lt;ref name="Sanderson-2000"/&gt;

=== Scale and heterogeneity (incorporating composition, structure, and function) ===
{{Main|Scale (spatial)|Heterogeneity}}

A main concept in landscape ecology is ''scale''. Scale represents the real world as translated onto a map, relating distance on a map image and the corresponding distance on earth.&lt;ref&gt;Malczewski, J. 1999. GIS and Multicriteria Decision Analysis. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York, NY, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; Scale is also the spatial or temporal measure of an object or a process,&lt;ref name="Turner-1991" /&gt; or amount of spatial resolution.&lt;ref name="Forman-1995" /&gt; Components of scale include composition, structure, and function, which are all important ecological concepts. Applied to landscape ecology, ''composition'' refers to the number of patch types (see below) represented on a landscape and their relative abundance. For example, the amount of [[forest]] or [[wetland]], the length of forest edge, or the density of [[road]]s can be aspects of landscape composition. ''Structure'' is determined by the composition, the configuration, and the proportion of different patches across the landscape, while ''function'' refers to how each element in the landscape interacts based on its life cycle events.&lt;ref name="Turner-1991" /&gt; ''Pattern'' is the term for the contents and internal order of a heterogeneous area of land.&lt;ref name="Forman-1986" /&gt;

A landscape with structure and pattern implies that it has spatial ''heterogeneity'', or the uneven distribution of objects across the landscape.&lt;ref name="Forman-1995" /&gt; Heterogeneity is a key element of landscape ecology that separates this discipline from other branches of ecology. Landscape heterogeneity is able to quantify with agent-based methods as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wirth|first=E.|last2=Szabó|first2=Gy.|last3=Czinkóczky|first3=A.|date=2016-06-07|title=MEASURE OF LANDSCAPE HETEROGENEITY BY AGENT-BASED METHODOLOGY|url=http://www.isprs-ann-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/III-8/145/2016/|journal=ISPRS Annals of Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences|language=English|volume=III-8|pages=145–151|doi=10.5194/isprs-annals-iii-8-145-2016|issn=2194-9042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patch and mosaic===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Patch]] --&gt;

{{See also|Patch dynamics}}
''Patch'', a term fundamental to landscape ecology, is defined as a relatively homogeneous area that differs from its surroundings.&lt;ref name="Forman-1995"/&gt;  Patches are the basic unit of the landscape that change and fluctuate, a process called ''patch dynamics''.  Patches have a definite shape and spatial configuration, and can be described compositionally by internal variables such as number of trees, number of tree species, height of trees, or other similar measurements.&lt;ref name="Forman-1995"/&gt;

''Matrix'' is the "background ecological system" of a landscape with a high degree of [[Landscape connectivity|connectivity]].  ''Connectivity'' is the measure of how connected or spatially continuous a corridor, network, or matrix is.&lt;ref name="Forman-1995"/&gt;  For example, a forested landscape (matrix) with fewer gaps in forest cover (open patches) will have higher connectivity.  ''Corridors'' have important functions as strips of a particular type of landscape differing from adjacent land on both sides.&lt;ref name="Forman-1995"/&gt;  A ''network'' is an interconnected system of corridors while ''mosaic'' describes the pattern of patches, corridors, and matrix that form a landscape in its entirety.&lt;ref name="Forman-1995"/&gt;

=== Boundary and edge ===
{{Main|Edge effect}}

Landscape patches have a boundary between them which can be defined or fuzzy.&lt;ref name="Sanderson-2000" /&gt; The zone composed of the edges of adjacent ecosystems is the ''boundary''.&lt;ref name="Forman-1995" /&gt; ''Edge'' means the portion of an ecosystem near its perimeter, where influences of the adjacent patches can cause an environmental difference between the interior of the patch and its edge. This edge effect includes a distinctive species composition or abundance.&lt;ref name="Forman-1995" /&gt; For example, when a landscape is a mosaic of perceptibly different types, such as a forest adjacent to a [[grassland]], the edge is the location where the two types adjoin. In a continuous landscape, such as a forest giving way to open woodland, the exact edge location is fuzzy and is sometimes determined by a local gradient exceeding a threshold, such as the point where the tree cover falls below thirty-five percent.&lt;ref name="Turner-1991" /&gt;

=== Ecotones, ecoclines, and ecotopes ===
{{Main|Ecotone|Ecocline|Ecotype}}

A type of boundary is the ''ecotone'', or the transitional zone between two communities.&lt;ref name="Allaby-1998" /&gt; Ecotones can arise naturally, such as a [[Shore|lakeshore]], or can be human-created, such as a cleared [[agricultural field]] from a forest.&lt;ref name="Allaby-1998" /&gt; The ecotonal community retains characteristics of each bordering community and often contains species not found in the adjacent communities. Classic examples of ecotones include fencerows, forest to marshlands transitions, forest to grassland transitions, or land-water interfaces such as [[riparian zone]]s in forests. Characteristics of ecotones include [[vegetational sharpness]], [[physiognomic]] change, occurrence of a spatial community mosaic, many [[exotic species]], [[ecotonal species]], [[spatial mass effect]], and [[Biodiversity|species richness]] higher or lower than either side of the ecotone.&lt;ref name="Walker-2003"&gt;Walker, S., W. J. Barstow, J. B. Steel, G. L. Rapson, B. Smith, W. M. King, and Y. H. Cottam. 2003. Properties of ecotones: evidence from five ecotones objectively determined from a coastal vegetation gradient. Journal of Vegetation Science 14:579-590.&lt;/ref&gt;

An ''[[wikt:ecocline|ecocline]]'' is another type of landscape boundary, but it is a gradual and continuous change in environmental conditions of an ecosystem or community. Ecoclines help explain the distribution and diversity of organisms within a landscape because certain organisms survive better under certain conditions, which change along the ecocline. They contain heterogeneous communities which are considered more environmentally stable than those of ecotones.&lt;ref name="Attrill-2002"&gt;Attrill, M.J. and S.D. Rundle. 2002. Ecotone or ecocline: ecological boundaries in estuaries. Estuarine, Coastal, and Shelf Science 55:929-936.&lt;/ref&gt;

An ''ecotope'' is a spatial term representing the smallest ecologically distinct unit in mapping and classification of landscapes.&lt;ref name="Forman-1995" /&gt; Relatively homogeneous, they are spatially explicit landscape units used to stratify landscapes into ecologically distinct features. They are useful for the measurement and mapping of landscape structure, function, and change over time, and to examine the effects of disturbance and fragmentation.

=== Disturbance and fragmentation ===
{{Main|Disturbance (ecology)|Habitat fragmentation}}

''Disturbance'' is an event that significantly alters the pattern of variation in the structure or function of a system. ''Fragmentation'' is the breaking up of a habitat, ecosystem, or land-use type into smaller parcels.&lt;ref name="Forman-1995" /&gt; Disturbance is generally considered a natural process. Fragmentation causes land transformation, an important process in landscapes as development occurs.

An important consequence of repeated, random clearing (whether by natural disturbance or human activity) is that contiguous cover can break down into isolated patches. This happens when the area cleared exceed a critical level, which means that landscapes exhibit two phases: connected and disconnected.&lt;ref name="Green-2006"&gt;Green, D.G., Klomp, N.I., Rimmington, G.R. and Sadedin, S. 2006. Complexity in Landscape Ecology, Springer, Amsterdam. {{cite web |url=http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~dgreen/books/springer/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619025437/http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~dgreen/books/springer/ |archivedate=2008-06-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory ==
Landscape ecology theory stresses the role of human impacts on landscape structures and functions. It also proposes ways for restoring degraded landscapes.&lt;ref name="Naveh-1984"/&gt; Landscape ecology explicitly includes humans as entities that cause functional changes on the landscape.&lt;ref name="Sanderson-2000"/&gt; Landscape ecology theory includes the landscape stability principle, which emphasizes the importance of landscape structural heterogeneity in developing resistance to disturbances, [[regeneration (ecology)|recovery from disturbances]], and promoting total system stability.&lt;ref name="Forman-1986"/&gt; This principle is a major contribution to general ecological theories which highlight the importance of relationships among the various components of the landscape. Integrity of landscape components helps maintain resistance to external threats, including development and land transformation by human activity.&lt;ref name="Turner-2001"/&gt; Analysis of land use change has included a strongly geographical approach which has led to the acceptance of the idea of multifunctional properties of landscapes.&lt;ref name="Ryszkowski-2002"/&gt; There are still calls for a more unified theory of landscape ecology due to differences in professional opinion among ecologists and its interdisciplinary approach (Bastian 2001).

An important related theory is hierarchy theory, which refers to how systems of discrete functional elements operate when linked at two or more scales.  For example, a forested landscape might be hierarchically composed of [[drainage basin]]s, which in turn are composed of local ecosystems, which are in turn composed of individual trees and gaps.&lt;ref name="Forman-1995"/&gt;  Recent theoretical developments in landscape ecology have emphasized the relationship between pattern and process, as well as the effect that changes in spatial scale has on the potential to extrapolate information across scales.&lt;ref name="Turner-1991"/&gt;  Several studies suggest that the landscape has critical thresholds at which ecological processes will show dramatic changes, such as the complete transformation of a landscape by an [[invasive species]] due to small changes in temperature characteristics which favor the invasive's [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]] requirements.&lt;ref name="Turner-1991"/&gt;

== Application ==

===Research directions===
Developments in landscape ecology illustrate the important relationships between spatial patterns and ecological processes. These developments incorporate quantitative methods that link spatial patterns and ecological processes at broad spatial and temporal scales.  This linkage of time, space, and environmental change can assist managers in applying plans to solve [[Natural environment|environmental]] problems.&lt;ref name="Turner-2001"/&gt;  The increased attention in recent years on spatial dynamics has highlighted the need for new quantitative methods that can analyze patterns, determine the importance of spatially explicit processes, and develop reliable models.&lt;ref name="Turner-1991"/&gt;  [[Multivariate analysis|Multivariate]] analysis techniques are frequently used to examine landscape level vegetation patterns.  Studies use statistical techniques, such as [[cluster analysis]], [[canonical correspondence analysis]] (CCA), or [[detrended correspondence analysis]] (DCA), for classifying vegetation.  [[Gradient analysis]] is another way to determine the vegetation structure across a landscape or to help delineate critical wetland habitat for conservation or mitigation purposes (Choesin and Boerner 2002).&lt;ref&gt;Lyon, J. and C. L. Sagers, C.L. 1998.  Structure of herbaceous plant assemblages in a forested riparian landscape.  Plant Ecology 138:1-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Climate change]] is another major component in structuring current research in landscape ecology.  Ecotones, as a basic unit in landscape studies, may have significance for management under climate change scenarios, since change effects are likely to be seen at ecotones first because of the unstable nature of a fringe habitat.&lt;ref name="Walker-2003"/&gt;  Research in northern regions has examined landscape ecological processes, such as the accumulation of snow, melting, freeze-thaw action, percolation, soil moisture variation, and temperature regimes through long-term measurements in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;Loffler, J. and O.-D. Finch.  2005.  Spatio-temporal gradients between high mountain ecosystems of central Norway.  Arctic, Antarctic, and Alpine Research 37:499-513.&lt;/ref&gt;  The study analyzes gradients across space and time between ecosystems of the central high mountains to determine relationships between distribution patterns of animals in their environment.  Looking at where animals live, and how vegetation shifts over time, may provide insight into changes in snow and ice over long periods of time across the landscape as a whole.

Other landscape-scale studies maintain that human impact is likely the main determinant of landscape pattern over much of the globe.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, J.B. and W. M. King.  1995.  Human-mediated vegetation switches as processes in landscape ecology.  ''[[Landscape Ecology (journal)|Landscape Ecology]]'' 10:191-196.&lt;/ref&gt;  Landscapes may become substitutes for [[biodiversity]] measures because plant and animal composition differs between samples taken from sites within different landscape categories.  Taxa, or different species, can “leak” from one habitat into another, which has implications for landscape ecology.  As human land use practices expand and continue to increase the proportion of edges in landscapes, the effects of this leakage across edges on assemblage integrity may become more significant in conservation. This is because taxa may be conserved across landscape levels, if not at local levels.&lt;ref&gt;Dangerfield, J.M., A.J. Pik, D.Britton, A. Holmes, M. Gillings, I. Oliver, D. Briscoe, and A. J. Beattie.  2003.  Patterns of invertebrate biodiversity across a natural edge.  Austral Ecology 28:227-236.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship to other disciplines===
Landscape ecology has been incorporated into a variety of ecological subdisciplines. For example, a recent development has been the more explicit consideration of spatial concepts and principles applied to the study of lakes, streams, and wetlands in the field of [[landscape limnology]]. [[Seascape ecology]] is a marine and coastal application of landscape ecology&lt;ref&gt;Pittman SJ (ed.). 2017. Seascape Ecology. Wiley &amp; Sons&lt;/ref&gt;. In addition, landscape ecology has important links to application-oriented disciplines such as [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]].  In agriculture, landscape ecology has introduced new options for the management of environmental threats brought about by the intensification of agricultural practices.  Agriculture has always been a strong human impact on ecosystems.&lt;ref name="Ryszkowski-2002"/&gt;  In forestry, from structuring stands for fuelwood and timber to ordering stands across landscapes to enhance aesthetics, consumer needs have affected conservation and use of forested landscapes.  Landscape forestry provides methods, concepts, and analytic procedures for landscape forestry.&lt;ref&gt;Boyce, S.G. 1995.  Landscape Forestry.  John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; Landscape ecology has been cited as a contributor to the development of [[fishery|fisheries]] biology as a distinct biological science discipline,&lt;ref&gt;Magnuson, J.J. 1991.  Fish and fisheries ecology.  Ecological Applications 1:13-26.&lt;/ref&gt; and is frequently incorporated in study design for wetland delineation in [[hydrology]].&lt;ref name="Attrill-2002"/&gt; It has helped shape [[integrated landscape management]].&lt;ref name="Sayer"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sayer|first1=J|title=Reconciling conservation and development: are landscapes the answer?|journal=Biotropica|date=2009|volume=41|issue=6|doi=10.1111/j.1744-7429.2009.00575.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1744-7429.2009.00575.x/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lastly, landscape ecology has been very influential for progressing sustainability science and sustainable development planning.  In example, a recent study assessed sustainable urbanization across Europe using evaluation indices, country-landscapes, and landscape ecology tools and methods.&lt;ref&gt;Shaker, R.R. (2015) The well-being of nations: an empirical assessment of sustainable urbanization for Europe. International Journal of Sustainable Development &amp; World Ecology, 22(5), 375-387. https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13504509.2015.1055524&lt;/ref&gt;

Landscape ecology has also been combined with [[population genetics]] to form the field of landscape genetics, which addresses how landscape features influence the population structure and gene flow of plant and animal populations across space and time&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Manel|first=Stéphanie|last2=Schwartz|first2=Michael K.|last3=Luikart|first3=Gordon|last4=Taberlet|first4=Pierre|date=April 2003|title=Landscape genetics: combining landscape ecology and population genetics|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534703000089|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=18|issue=4|pages=189–197|doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(03)00008-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on how the quality of intervening landscape, known as "matrix," influences spatial variation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Storfer|first=A.|last2=Murphy|first2=M.

According to the '''Life-span model of motivation''' the personal goals that individuals set are a function of the opportunities and challenges that are present in their social environment. Personal goals are an important determinant to the way individuals direct their development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2007-01-01|title=Personal project pursuit: Goals, action, and human flourishing.|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2006-11798-000|journal=APA PsycNET|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model introduces four key processes; channeling, choice, co-agency and compensation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Salmela-Aro|first=Katariina|date=2009-03-01|title=Personal goals and well-being during critical life transitions: The four C's—Channelling, choice, co-agency and compensation|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040260809000045|journal=Advances in Life Course Research|series=Linked Lives and Self-Regulation.

== The 4 C's ==
Developmental trajectories are ''channeled'' by the [[social environment]], which represents the "opportunity space" for development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, individuals are active agents in constructing their development, and hence make ''choices'' regarding their goals and commitments. Given that development occurs in a social context, others in the environment such as peers, family members or teachers have a role in ''co-regulation'' of development. And last, success and failures in personal goals and tasks serve as feedback and basis for ''compensation'' in order to optimize development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ch/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=C0zbcXRqyMIC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=Developmental+Regulation+in+Adulthood:+Age-Normative+and+Sociostructural+Constraints+as+Adaptive+Challenges&amp;ots=XfOdup072Z&amp;sig=g96rMe7VkZQwL1MvcrT5PktzLLo#v=onepage&amp;q=Developmental%20Regulation%20in%20Adulthood:%20Age-Normative%20and%20Sociostructural%20Constraints%20as%20Adaptive%20Challenges&amp;f=false|title=Developmental Regulation in Adulthood: Age-Normative and Sociostructural Constraints as Adaptive Challenges|last=Heckhausen|first=Jutta|date=2006-06-22|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521027137|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;In [[anthropology]], '''liminality''' (from the Latin word ''līmen'', meaning "a threshold"&lt;ref&gt;"liminal", ''Oxford English Dictionary''. Ed. J. A. Simpson and E. S. C. Weiner. 2nd ed. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1989. OED Online Oxford 23, 2007; [[cf.]] ''[[Wiktionary:subliminal|subliminal]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;) is the quality of ambiguity or disorientation that occurs in the middle stage of [[rites]], when participants no longer hold their preritual status but have not yet begun the transition to the status they will hold when the rite is complete. During a rite's liminal stage, participants "stand at the threshold"&lt;ref&gt;("Nordic Work with Traumatised Refugees: Do We Really Care", edited by Gwynyth Overland, Eugene Guribye, Birgit)&lt;/ref&gt;  between their previous way of structuring their identity, time, or community, and a new way, which completing the rite establishes.

The concept of liminality was first developed in the early twentieth century by folklorist [[Arnold van Gennep]] and later taken up by [[Victor Turner]].&lt;ref&gt;"Liminality and Communitas", in "The Ritual Process: Structure and Anti-Structure" (New Brunswick: Aldine Transaction Press, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, usage of the term has broadened to describe political and cultural change as well as rites.&lt;ref&gt;Bjørn Thomassen, ''The Uses and Meanings of Liminality'' (International Political Anthropology 2009) p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; During liminal periods of all kinds, social hierarchies may be reversed or temporarily dissolved, continuity of tradition may become uncertain, and future outcomes once taken for granted may be thrown into doubt.&lt;ref&gt;Agnes Horvath, Bjørn Thomassen, and Harald Wydra, ''Introduction: Liminality and Cultures of Change'' (International Political Anthropology 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; The dissolution of order during liminality creates a fluid, malleable situation that enables new institutions and customs to become established.&lt;ref&gt;Arpad Szakolczai, ''Liminality and Experience: Structuring transitory situations and transformative events'' (International Political Anthropology 2009) p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; The term has also passed into popular usage, where it is applied much more broadly, undermining its significance to some extent.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Barfield, ''The Dictionary of Anthropology'' (1997) p. 477&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rites of passage==

===Arnold van Gennep===

Van Gennep, who coined the term liminality, published in 1909 his 'Rites de Passage', a work that explores and develops the concept of liminality in the context of rites in small-scale societies. Van Gennep began his book by identifying the various categories of rites. He distinguished between those that result in a change of status for an individual or social group, and those that signify transitions in the passage of time. In doing so, he placed a particular emphasis on [[Rite of passage|rites of passage]], and claimed that "such rituals marking, helping, or celebrating individual or collective passages through the cycle of life or of nature exist in every culture, and share a specific three-fold sequential structure".&lt;ref&gt;Szakolczai 2009, 141&lt;/ref&gt;

This three-fold structure, as established by van Gennep, is made up of the following components:&lt;ref&gt;Arnold van Gennep, ''The Rites of Passage'' (London 1977) p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''preliminal rites'' (or ''rites of separation''): This stage involves a metaphorical "death", as the initiate is forced to leave something behind by breaking with previous practices and routines.
* ''liminal rites'' (or ''transition rites''): Two characteristics are essential to these rites. First, the rite "must follow a strictly prescribed sequence, where everybody knows what to do and how".&lt;ref&gt;Szakolczai 2009, 148&lt;/ref&gt; Second, everything must be done "under the authority of a master of ceremonies".&lt;ref&gt;Szakolczai 2009, 148&lt;/ref&gt; The destructive nature of this rite allows for considerable changes to be made to the identity of the initiand. This middle stage (when the transition takes place) "implies an actual passing through the threshold that marks the boundary between two phases, and the term 'liminality' was introduced in order to characterize this passage."&lt;ref&gt;Szakolczai 2009, 141&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''postliminal rites'' (or ''rites of incorporation''): During this stage, the initiand is re-incorporated into society with a new identity, as a "new" being.

Turner confirmed his nomenclature for 'the three phases of passage from one culturally defined state or status to another...''preliminal'', ''liminal'', and ''postliminal'''.&lt;ref&gt;Victor W. Turner, ''The Ritual Process'' (Penguin 1969) p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond this structural template, Van Gennep also suggested four categories of rites that emerge as universal across cultures and societies. He suggested that there are four types of social rites of passage that are replicable and recognizable among many ethnographic populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|date=2015-01-01|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780080970868121026|language=en|pages=131–137|doi=10.1016/B978-0-08-097086-8.12102-6|title=International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences|last1=Andrews|first1=Hazel|last2=Roberts|first2=Les|isbn=9780080970875}}&lt;/ref&gt; They include:

* Passage of people from one status to another, initiation ceremonies in which an outsider is brought into the group. This includes marriage and initiation ceremonies that move one from the status of an outsider to an insider.
* Passage from one place to another, such as moving houses, moving to a new city, etc.
* Passage from one situation to another: beginning university, starting a new job, and graduating high school or university.
* Passage of time such as New Year celebrations and birthdays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|date=2015-01-01|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780080970868121026|language=en|pages=131–137|doi=10.1016/B978-0-08-097086-8.12102-6|title=International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences|last1=Andrews|first1=Hazel|last2=Roberts|first2=Les|isbn=9780080970875}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Gennep considered rites of [[initiation]] to be the most typical rite. To gain a better understanding of "tripartite structure" of liminal situations, one can look at a specific rite of initiation: the initiation of youngsters into adulthood, which Turner considered the most typical rite. In such rites of passage, the experience is highly structured. The first phase (the rite of separation) requires the child to go through a separation from his family; this involves his/her "death" as a child, as [[childhood]] is effectively left behind. In the second stage, initiands (between childhood and adulthood) must pass a "test" to prove they are ready for adulthood. If they succeed, the third stage (incorporation) involves a celebration of the "new birth" of the adult and a welcoming of that being back into society.

By constructing this three-part sequence, van Gennep identified a pattern he believed was inherent in all ritual passages. By suggesting that such a sequence is universal (meaning that all societies use rites to demarcate transitions), van Gennep made an important claim (one that not many anthropologists make, as they generally tend to demonstrate [[cultural diversity]] while shying away from universality).

An anthropological rite, especially a [[rite of passage]], involves some change to the participants, especially their [[social status]].;&lt;ref&gt;Victor Turner, "Betwixt and Between: The Liminal Period in Rites de Passage", in ''The Forest of Symbols'' (Ithaca, NY: [[Cornell University Press]], 1967).&lt;/ref&gt; and in 'the first phase (of separation) comprises symbolic behaviour signifying the detachment of the individual...from an earlier fixed point in the social structure.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, ''Ritual'' p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; Their status thus becomes liminal. In such a liminal situation, "the initiands live outside their normal environment and are brought to question their self and the existing social order through a series of rituals that often involve acts of pain: the initiands come to feel nameless, spatio-temporally dislocated and socially unstructured".&lt;ref&gt;Bjørn Thomassen, "Liminality" in ''The Encyclopedia of Social Theory''(London 2006) p. 322&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, liminal periods are "destructive" as well as "constructive", meaning that "the formative experiences during liminality will prepare the initiand (and his/her cohort) to occupy a new social role or status, made public during the reintegration rituals".&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2006, 322&lt;/ref&gt;

===Victor Turner===

Turner, who is considered to have "re-discovered the importance of liminality", first came across van Gennep's work in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, 14&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967 he published his book ''The Forest of Symbols'', which included an essay entitled ''Betwixt and Between: The Liminal Period in Rites of Passage''. Within the works of Turner, liminality began to wander away from its narrow application to ritual passages in small-scale societies.&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, 14&lt;/ref&gt; In the various works he completed while conducting his fieldwork amongst the Ndembu in [[Zambia]], he made numerous connections between [[Tribe|tribal]] and non-tribal societies, "sensing that what he argued for the Ndembu had relevance far beyond the specific [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] context".&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, 14&lt;/ref&gt; He became aware that liminality "...served not only to identify the importance of in-between periods, but also to understand the human reactions to liminal experiences: the way liminality shaped personality, the sudden foregrounding of agency, and the sometimes dramatic tying together of thought and experience".&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, 14&lt;/ref&gt;

'The attributes of liminality or of liminal ''personae'' ("threshold people") are necessarily ambiguous'.&lt;ref&gt;Turner ''Ritual'' p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; One's sense of [[identity (social science)|identity]] dissolves to some extent, bringing about disorientation, but also the possibility of new perspectives. Turner posits that, if liminality is regarded as a time and place of withdrawal from normal modes of social action, it potentially can be seen as a period of scrutiny for central values and axioms of the culture where it occurs.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, ''Ritual'' p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;—one where normal limits to thought, self-understanding, and behavior are undone. In such situations, "the very structure of society [is] temporarily suspended"&lt;ref&gt;Szakolczai 2009, 142&lt;/ref&gt;

'According to Turner, all liminality must eventually dissolve, for it is a state of great intensity that cannot exist very long without some sort of structure to stabilize it...either the individual returns to the surrounding social structure...or else liminal communities develop their own internal social structure, a condition Turner calls "normative communitas"'.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Homas, ''Jung in Context'' (London 1979) p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of Victor Turner has vital significance in turning attention to this concept, introduced by Arnold van Gennep, a main intellectual opponent of [[Durkheim]], who subsequently was diverted out of anthropological and sociological thinking. However, Turner's approach to liminality has two major shortcomings. First, partly due to criticism, Turner was  keen to limit the meaning of the concept to the concrete settings of small-scale tribal societies, preferring the neologism coined by him, 'liminoid', to analyse certain features of the modern world, like theatre (Turner 1982). However, Agnes Horvath (2013) argues that the term can be applied to concrete historical events, and should be applied, as offering a vital means for historical and sociological understanding.  Second, again staying too close to his own experiences, Turner attributed a rather univocally positive connotation to liminal situations, as ways of renewal. However, liminal situations can be, and in actual fact in modern era, rather quite different: periods of uncertainty, anguish, even existential fear: a facing of the abyss in void.&lt;ref&gt;Horvath, Agnes. ''Modernism and Charisma''. Basingstoke: Palgrave, Macmillan. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Liminality has both spatial and temporal dimensions, and can be applied to a variety of subjects: individuals, larger groups (cohorts or villages), whole societies, and possibly even entire civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, 16&lt;/ref&gt; The following chart summarizes the different dimensions and subjects of liminal experiences, and also provides the main characteristics and key examples of each category.&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, 16&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

Another significant variable is "scale," or the "degree" to which an individual or group experiences liminality.&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, 17&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, "there are degrees of liminality, and…the degree depends on the extent to which the liminal experience can be weighed against persisting structures."&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, 18&lt;/ref&gt; When the spatial and temporal are both affected, the intensity of the liminal experience increases and so-called "pure liminality" is approached.&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, 18&lt;/ref&gt;

==In large-scale societies==

The concept of a liminal situation can also be applied to entire societies that are going through a crisis or a "collapse of order".&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Karl Jaspers]] made a significant contribution to this idea through his concept of the "[[axial age]]", which was "an in-between period between two structured world-views and between two rounds of empire building; it was an age of creativity where 'man asked radical questions', and where the 'unquestioned grasp on life is loosened'".&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, pp. 19–20&lt;/ref&gt; It was essentially a time of uncertainty which, most importantly, involved entire civilizations. Seeing as liminal periods are both destructive and constructive, the ideas and practices that emerge from these liminal historical periods are of extreme importance, as they will "tend to take on the quality of structure".&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Events such as political or social revolutions (along with other periods of crisis) can thus be considered liminal, as they result in the complete collapse of order and can lead to significant social change.&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2006, p. 323&lt;/ref&gt;

Liminality in large-scale societies differs significantly from liminality found in ritual passages in small-scale societies. One primary characteristic of liminality (as defined van Gennep and Turner) is that there is a way in as well as a way out.&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; In ritual passages, "members of the society are themselves aware of the liminal state: they know that they will leave it sooner or later, and have 'ceremony masters' to guide them through the rituals".&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; However, in those liminal periods that affect society as a whole, the future (what comes after the liminal period) is completely unknown, and there is no "ceremony master" who has gone through the process before and that can lead people out of it.&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; In such cases, liminal situations can become dangerous. They allow for the emergence of "self-proclaimed ceremony masters", that assume leadership positions and attempt to "[perpetuate] liminality and by emptying the liminal moment of real creativity, [turn] it into a scene of mimetic rivalry".&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Depth psychology==
Jungians have often seen the [[individuation]] process of self-realization as taking place within a liminal space.  'Individuation begins with a withdrawal from normal modes of socialisation, epitomized by the breakdown of the persona...liminality'.&lt;ref&gt;Homans 1979, 207.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus "what Turner's concept of social liminality does for status in society, Jung...does for the movement of the person through the life process of individuation".&lt;ref&gt;Hall, quoted in Miller and Jung 2004, 104.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuation can be seen as a "movement through liminal space and time, from disorientation to integration....What takes place in the dark phase of liminality is a process of breaking down...in the interest of "making whole" one's meaning, purpose and sense of relatedness once more'"&lt;ref&gt;Shorter 1988, 73, 79.&lt;/ref&gt; As an [[Jungian archetypes|archetypal]] figure, "the trickster is a symbol of the liminal state itself, and of its permanent accessibility as a source of recreative power".&lt;ref&gt;Robert Pelton in Young-Eisendrath and Dawson eds. 1997, 244&lt;/ref&gt;

But other depth psychologies speak of a similar process.  [[Carl Rogers]] describes "the 'out-of-this-world' quality that many therapists have remarked upon, a sort of trance-like feeling in the relationship that client and therapist emerge from at the end of the hour, as if from a deep well or tunnel.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers 1961, 202.&lt;/ref&gt; The French talk of how the analytic setting 'opens/forges the "intermediate space," "excluded middle," or "between" that figures so importantly in [[Irigaray]]'s writing".&lt;ref&gt;E. Hirsh, in Burke et al. eds. 1994, 309n&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marion Milner]] claimed that "a temporal spatial frame also marks off the special kind of reality of a psycho-analytic session...the different kind of reality that is within it".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Casement 1997, 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jungians however have perhaps been most explicit about the 'need to accord space, time and place for liminal feeling'&lt;ref&gt;Shorter 1988, 79.&lt;/ref&gt;—as well about the associated dangers, 'two mistakes: we provide no ritual space at all in our lives...or we stay in it too long'.&lt;ref&gt;Bly, 1991, 194.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Jung's psychology has itself been described as 'a form of "permanent liminality" in which there is no need to return to social structure'.&lt;ref&gt;Homans  1979, 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of general usage==
 {{Refimprove section|date=September 2010}}

===In rites===
In the context of rites, liminality is being artificially produced, as opposed to those situations (such as natural disasters) in which it can occur spontaneously.&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; In the simple example of a college [[graduation]] ceremony, the liminal phase can actually be extended to include the period of time between when the last assignment was finished (and graduation was assured) all the way through reception of the diploma. That [[no man's land]] represents the limbo associated with liminality. The stress of accomplishing tasks for college has been lifted, yet the individual has not moved on to a new stage in life (psychologically or physically). The result is a unique perspective on what has come before, and what may come next.

It can include the period between when a couple get engaged and their marriage or between death and burial, for which cultures may have set ritual observances. Even sexually liberal cultures may strongly disapprove of an engaged spouse having sex with another person during this time. When a marriage proposal is initiated there is a liminal stage between the question and the answer during which the social arrangements of both parties involved are subject to transformation and inversion; a sort of "life stage limbo" so to speak in that the affirmation or denial can result in multiple and diverse outcomes.

Getz&lt;ref&gt;Getz 2007, 179.&lt;/ref&gt; provides commentary on the liminal/liminoid zone when discussing the planned event experience. He refers to a liminal zone at an event as the creation of "time out of time: a special place". He notes that this liminal zone is both spatial and temporal and integral when planning a successful event (e.g. ceremony, concert, conference etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Getz 2007, 442.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In time===
The temporal dimension of liminality can relate to moments (sudden events), periods (weeks, months, or possibly years), and epochs (decades, generations, maybe even centuries).&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;
====Examples====
[[Twilight]] serves as a liminal time, between day and night—where one is 'in the twilight zone, in a liminal nether region of the night'.&lt;ref&gt;Costello 2002, 158.&lt;/ref&gt;  The title of the television fiction series ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' makes reference to this, describing it as "the middle ground between light and shadow, between science and superstition" in one variant of the original series' opening. The name is from an actual zone observable from space in the place where daylight or shadow advances or retreats about the Earth.  [[Noon]] and, more often, [[midnight]] can be considered liminal, the first transitioning between morning and afternoon, the latter between days.

Within the years, liminal times include [[equinox]]es when day and night have equal length, and [[solstice]]s, when the increase of day or night shifts over to its decrease.  Where the [[quarter days]] are held to mark the change in seasons, they also are liminal times. [[New Year's Day]], whatever its connection or lack of one to the astrological sky, is a liminal time.  Customs such as fortune-telling take advantage of this liminal state.  In a number of cultures, actions and events on the first day of the year can determine the year, leading to such beliefs as [[first-foot]].  Many cultures regard it as a time especially prone to hauntings by [[ghost]]s—[[liminal being]]s, neither alive nor dead.

===In religion===

====Christian worship====

Liminal existence can be located in a separated ''sacred space'', which occupies a ''sacred time''.  Examples in the Bible include the dream of Jacob ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 28:12–19) where he encounters God between heaven and earth and the instance when [[Isaiah]] meets the Lord in the [[temple of holiness]] ([[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 6:1–6).&lt;ref&gt;Carson, 2003, 61.&lt;/ref&gt; In such a liminal space, the individual experiences the revelation of ''sacred knowledge'' where God imparts his knowledge on the person.

Worship can be understood in this context as the church community (or ''communitas'' or ''[[koinonia]]'') enter into liminal space corporately.&lt;ref&gt;Carson 2003, 61.&lt;/ref&gt;  Religious symbols and music may aid in this process described as a [[pilgrimage]] by way of [[prayer]], [[song]], or [[liturgical]] acts.  The congregation is transformed in the liminal space and as they exit, are sent out back into the world to serve.

===Of beings===
Various minority groups can be considered liminal. In reality illegal immigrants (present but not "official"), and stateless people, for example, are regarded as liminal because they are "betwixt and between home and host, part of society, but sometimes never fully integrated".&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; [[Intersex]] or [[transgender]] people, [[bisexual]] people in most contemporary societies, people of mixed [[ethnicity]], and those accused but not yet judged guilty or not guilty, are liminal. Teenagers, being neither children nor adults, are liminal people: indeed, "for young people, liminality of this kind has become a permanent phenomenon...Postmodern liminality".&lt;ref&gt;Kahane 1997, 31.&lt;/ref&gt; The "[[trickster]] as the mythic projection of the magician—standing in the ''limen'' between the sacred realm and the profane"&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas 2009, 25.&lt;/ref&gt; and related [[archetype]]s embody many such contradictions as do many [[popular culture]] [[celebrities]]. The category could also hypothetically and in [[fiction]] include [[cyborg]]s, [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] between two species, [[shapeshifter]]s. One could also consider seals, crabs, shorebirds, frogs, bats, dolphins/whales and other "border animals" to be liminal: "the wild duck and swan are cases in point...intermediate creatures that combine underwater activity and the bird flight with an intermediate, terrestrial life".&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Henderson in Jung 1978, 153.&lt;/ref&gt; It should come as no surprise that these liminal creatures figure prominently in mythology as shapeshifters and spirit guides.

===In places===
The spatial dimension of liminality can include specific places, larger zones or areas, or entire countries and larger regions.&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Liminal places can range from [[border]]s and frontiers to no man's lands and [[disputed territories]], to [[crossroads (culture)|crossroads]] to perhaps [[airport]]s or [[hotel]]s, which people pass through but do not live in: arguably indeed all 'romantic travel enacts the three stages that characterize liminality: separation, marginalization, and reaggregation'.&lt;ref&gt; Illouz 1997, 143.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[mythology]] and [[religion]] or [[occult|esoteric lore]] liminality can include such realms as [[Purgatory]] or [[Da'at (Kabbalah)|Da'at]], which, as well as signifying liminality, some theologians deny actually existing, making them, in some cases, doubly liminal. "Between-ness" defines these spaces. For a hotel worker (an insider) or a person passing by with disinterest (a total outsider), the hotel would have a very different connotation. To a traveller staying there, the hotel would function as a liminal zone, just as 'doors and windows and hallways and gates frame...the definitively liminal condition'.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Brown in Corcoran 2002, 211.&lt;/ref&gt;

More conventionally, springs, caves, shores, rivers, volcanic calderas—'a huge crater of an extinct volcano...[as] another symbol of transcendence'&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Henderson, in Jung 1978, 152.&lt;/ref&gt;—fords, passes, crossroads, bridges, and marshes are all liminal: '"edges", borders or faultlines between the legitimate and the illegitimate'.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Brown in Corcoran 2002, 196&lt;/ref&gt; Oedipus (an adoptee and therefore liminal) met his father at the crossroads and killed him; the bluesman [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]] met the devil at the crossroads, where he is said to have sold his soul. Major transformations occur at crossroads and other liminal places, at least partly because liminality—being so unstable—can pave the way for access to esoteric knowledge or understanding of both sides.&lt;ref&gt;El Khoury, 2015, 217&lt;/ref&gt; Liminality is sacred, alluring, and dangerous.

In contemporary culture viewing the nightclub experience (dancing in a [[nightclub]]) through the liminoid framework highlights the 'presence or absence of opportunities for social subversion, escape from social structures, and exercising choice'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taheri|first=Babak|last2=Gori|first2=Keith|last3=O'Gorman|first3=Kevin|last4=Hogg|first4=Gillian|last5=Farrington|first5=Thomas|date=2016-01-02|title=Experiential liminoid consumption: the case of nightclubbing|journal=Journal of Marketing Management|volume=32|issue=1–2|pages=19–43|doi=10.1080/0267257X.2015.1089309|issn=0267-257X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows 'insights into what may be effectively improved in hedonic spaces. Enhancing the consumer experience of these liminoid aspects may heighten experiential feelings of escapism and play, thus encouraging the consumer to more freely consume'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taheri|first=Babak|last2=Gori|first2=Keith|last3=O'Gorman|first3=Kevin|last4=Hogg|first4=Gillian|last5=Farrington|first5=Thomas|date=2016-01-02|title=Experiential liminoid consumption: the case of nightclubbing|journal=Journal of Marketing Management|volume=32|issue=1–2|pages=19–43|doi=10.1080/0267257X.2015.1089309|issn=0267-257X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In folklore===
There are a number of stories in [[folklore]] of those who could only be killed in a liminal space: [[Lleu Llaw Gyffes|Lleu]] could not be killed during the day or night, nor indoors or outdoors, nor riding or walking, nor clothed or naked (and is attacked at dusk, while wrapped in a net with one foot on a cauldron and one on a goat). Likewise, in [[Hindu]] text [[Bhagavat Purana]], [[Vishnu]] appears in a half-man half-[[lion]] form named [[Narasimha]] to destroy the demon Hiranyakashipu who has obtained the power never to be killed in day nor night, in the ground nor in the air, with [[weapon]] nor by bare hands, in a building nor outside it, by man nor beast.  Narasimha kills Hiranyakashipu at dusk, across his lap, with his sharp claws, on the threshold of the palace, and as Narasimha is a god himself, the demon is killed by neither man nor beast. In the [[Mahabharata]], [[Indra]] promises not to slay [[Namuci]] and [[Vritra]] with anything wet or dry, nor in the day or in the night, but instead kills them at dusk with foam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Vritra |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Religion |publisher=Macmillan Reference USA/Gale Group |year=2006 |url=http://www.bookrags.com/Vritra |accessdate = 2007-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet another example comes from Hayao Miyazaki's "Princess Mononoke" in which the Forest Spirit can only be killed while switching between its two forms.

===In ethnographic research===
In ethnographic research, 'the researcher is...in a liminal state, separated from his own culture yet not incorporated into the host culture'&lt;ref&gt;Norris Johnson, in Robben and Sluka 2007, 76&lt;/ref&gt;—when he or she is both participating in the culture ''and'' observing the culture. The researcher must consider the self in relation to others and his or her positioning in the culture being studied.

In many cases, greater participation in the group being studied can lead to increased access of cultural information and greater in-group understanding of experiences within the culture. However increased participation also blurs the role of the researcher in data collection and analysis. Often a researcher that engages in fieldwork as a "participant" or "participant-observer" occupies a liminal state where he/she is a part of the culture, but also separated from the culture as a researcher. This liminal state of being betwixt and between is emotional and uncomfortable as the researcher uses self-reflexivity to interpret field observations and interviews.

Some scholars argue that ethnographers are present in their research, occupying a liminal state, regardless of their participant status. Justification for this position is that the researcher as a "human instrument" engages with his/her observations in the process of recording and analyzing the data. A researcher, often unconsciously, selects what to observe, how to record observations and how to interpret observations based on personal reference points and experiences. For example, even in selecting what observations are interesting to record, the researcher must interpret and value the data available. To explore the liminal state of the researcher in relation to the culture, self-reflexivity and awareness are important tools to reveal researcher bias and interpretation.

===In popular culture===
====Novels and short stories====

''[[Rant (novel)|Rant: An Oral Biography of Buster Casey]]'' is a US novel by [[Chuck Palahniuk]] from 2007 that makes use of liminality in explaining time travel. ''[[Possession (Byatt novel)|Possession]]'' is  a romance by A. S. Byatt, which describes how [[postmodern]] 'Literary theory. Feminism...write about liminality. Thresholds. Bastions. Fortresses'.&lt;ref&gt;Byatt 1990, 505–06.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Twilight (novel series)|The Twilight Saga]]'' is a book series by Stephanie Meyer that was turned into film series. Each book title speaks of a liminal period (''[[Twilight (Meyer novel)|Twilight]], [[New Moon (novel)|New Moon]], [[Eclipse (Meyer novel)|Eclipse]]'', and ''[[Breaking Dawn]]''). In the children's story ''[[The Phantom Tollbooth]]'' (1961), Milo enters "The Lands Beyond", a liminal place (which explains its topsy-turvy nature), through a magical tollbooth. When he finishes his quest, he returns, but changed, seeing the world differently. The giver of the tollbooth is never seen and name never known, and hence, also remains liminal. In ''[[Offshore (novel)|Offshore]]'', a British novel by [[Penelope Fitzgerald]], the characters live between sea and land on docked boats, becoming liminal people; as such, liminality is a major theme in the novel. [[Saul Bellow|Bellow]]'s varied uses of liminality...include his ''[[Dangling Man]]'', suspended between civilian life and the armed forces'&lt;ref&gt;Elsbree 1991, 66.&lt;/ref&gt; at 'the onset of the dangling days'.&lt;ref&gt;Bellow 1977, 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

Charlotte Brönte's widely-read ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' follows the protagonist through different stages of life as she crosses the threshold from student to teacher to woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Brontë, Charlotte (1816–1855)|volume = 1|date=2017-11-28|publisher=Oxford University Press|series=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|doi=10.1093/odnb/9780192683120.013.3523}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her existence throughout the novel is liminal and can first be seen when she hides herself behind a large red curtain to read, closing herself off physically and existing in a paracosmic realm. At Gateshead, Jane is noted to be set apart and on the outside of the family, putting her in a liminal space in which she neither belongs nor is completely cast away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clark|first=Megan|date=2017|title=The Space In-Between: Exploring Liminality in Jane Eyre|url=|journal=Criterion: A Journal of Literary Criticism|volume=10|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jane's existence emerges as paradoxical as she transcends commonly accepted beliefs about what it means to be a woman, orphan, child, victim, criminal, and pilgrim&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gilead|first=Sarah|date=1987|title=Liminality and Antiliminality in Charlotte Brontë's Novels: Shirley Reads Jane Eyre|journal=Texas Studies in Literature and Language|volume=29|issue=3|pages=302–322|jstor=40754831}}&lt;/ref&gt; and creates her own narrative as she is torn from her past and denied a sure future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gilead|first=Sarah|date=1987|title=Liminality and Antiliminality in Charlotte Brontë's Novels: Shirley Reads Jane Eyre|journal=Texas Studies in Literature and Language|volume=29|issue=3|pages=302–322|jstor=40754831}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faced with a series of crises, Jane's circumstances question social constructs and allow Jane to act to progress or retract; as a result, a narrative dynamic of structure and liminality (as coined by Turner).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gilead|first=Sarah|date=1987|title=Liminality and Antiliminality in Charlotte Brontë's Novels: Shirley Reads Jane Eyre|journal=Texas Studies in Literature and Language|volume=29|issue=3|pages=302–322|jstor=40754831}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Karen Brooks states that Australian [[grunge lit]] books, such as Clare Mendes'  ''[[Drift Street]]'', Edward Berridge's ''[[The Lives of the Saints (fiction)|The Lives of the Saints]]'', and [[Andrew McGahan]]'s ''[[Praise]]'' "...explor[e] the psychosocial and psychosexual limitations of young sub/urban characters in relation to the imaginary and socially constructed boundaries defining...self and other" and "opening up" new "liminal [boundary] spaces" where the concept of an [[abjection|abject]] human body can be explored.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brooks|first=Karen|year=1998|title=Shit Creek: Suburbia, Abjection and Subjectivity in Australian 'Grunge' Fiction.|url=|journal=Australian Literary Studies|volume=18.4|pages=87–99|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks states that Berridge's short stories provide "...a variety of violent, disaffected and often abject young people", characters who "...blur and often overturn" the boundaries between suburban and urban space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brooks|first=Karen|year=1998|title=Shit Creek: Suburbia, Abjection and Subjectivity in Australian 'Grunge' Fiction.|url=|journal=Australian Literary Studies|volume=18.4|pages=87–99|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks states that the marginalized characters in ''The Lives of the Saints'', ''Drift Street'' and ''Praise'') are able to stay in "shit creek" (an undesirable setting or situation) and "diver[t]... flows" of these "creeks", thus claiming their rough settings' "liminality" (being in a border situation or transitional setting) and their own "abjection" (having "abject bodies" with health problems, disease, etc.) as "sites of symbolic empowerment and agency".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brooks|first=Karen|year=1998|title=Shit Creek: Suburbia, Abjection and Subjectivity in Australian 'Grunge' Fiction.|url=|journal=Australian Literary Studies|volume=18.4|pages=87–99|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Brooks states that the story "Caravan Park" in Berridge's short story collection is an example of a story with a "liminal" setting, as it is set in a [[mobile home]] park; since mobile homes can be relocated, she states that setting a story in a mobile home "...has the potential to disrupt a range of geo-physical and psycho-social boundaries".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brookes|first=Karen|year=1998|title=Shit Creek: Suburbia, Abjection and Subjectivity in Australian 'Grunge' Fiction.|url=|journal=Australian Literary Studies|volume=18.4|pages=87–99|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks states that in Berridge's story "Bored Teenagers", the adolescents using a community drop-in centre decide to destroy its equipment and defile the space by urinating in it, thus "altering the dynamics of the place and the way" their bodies are perceived, with their destructive activities being deemed by Brooks to indicate the community centre's "loss of authority" over the teens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brooks|first=Karen|year=1998|title=Shit Creek: Suburbia, Abjection and Subjectivity in Australian 'Grunge' Fiction.|url=|journal=Australian Literary Studies|volume=18.4|pages=87–99|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Plays====
''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead]]'', a play by [[Tom Stoppard]], takes place both in a kind of no-man's-land and the actual setting of ''[[Hamlet]]''. "Shakespeare's play ''Hamlet'' is in several ways an essay in sustained liminality ... only via a condition of complete liminality can Hamlet finally see the way forward".&lt;ref&gt;Liebler, pp. 182–84&lt;/ref&gt; In the play ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' for the entire length of the play, two men walk around restlessly on an empty stage. They alternate between hope and hopelessness.  At times one forgets what they are even waiting for, and the other reminds him: "We are waiting for Godot". The identity of 'Godot' is never revealed, and perhaps the men do not know Godot's identity. The men are trying to keep up their spirits as they wander the empty stage, waiting.

====Films and TV shows====
''[[The Twilight Zone]]'' (1959–2003) is a US television anthology series that explores unusual situations between reality and the paranormal.  ''[[The Terminal (film)|The Terminal]]'' (2004), is a US film in which the main character (Viktor Navorski) is trapped in a liminal space; since he can neither legally return to his home country Krakozhia nor enter the United States, he must remain in the airport terminal indefinitely until he finds a way out at the end of the film. In the film ''[[Waking Life]]'', about dreams, Aklilu Gebrewold talks about liminality.

====Music and other media====
"Liminal Space" is an album by American [[breakcore]] artist Xanopticon. [[Coil (band)|Coil]] mention liminality throughout their works, most explicitly with the title of their song "Batwings (A Limnal Hymn)" ''(sic)'' from their album [[Musick to Play in the Dark Vol. 2]]. In ''[[.hack//Liminality]]'' where Harald Hoerwick, the creator of the MMORPG "The World", attempted to bring the real world into the online world, creating a hazy barrier between the two worlds; a concept called "Liminality".

==Liminoid experiences==
In 1974, Victor Turner coined the term ''liminoid'' (from the greek word eidos, meaning "form or shape"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2015-01-01|title=Liminality|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780080970868121026|language=en|pages=131–137|doi=10.1016/B978-0-08-097086-8.12102-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;) to refer to experiences that have characteristics of liminal experiences but are optional and do not involve a resolution of a personal crisis.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Turner, Victor. 'Liminal to liminoid in play, flow, and ritual: An essay in comparative symbology'. ''Rice University Studies'' 1974. 60(3):53–92&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike liminal events, liminoid experiences are conditional and do not result in a change of status, but merely serve as transitional moments in time&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scholarship.rice.edu/bitstream/handle/1911/63159/article_RIP603_part4.pdf|title=LIMINAL TO LIMINOID, IN PLAY, FLOW, AND
RITUAL: AN ESSAY IN COMPARATIVE SYMBOLOGY|last=Turner|first=Victor|date=|website=Rice Scholar|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11/25/18}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The liminal is part of society, an aspect of social or religious rites, while the liminoid is a break from society, part of "play" or "playing". With the rise in industrialization and the emergence of leisure as an acceptable form of play separate from work, liminoid experiences have become much more common than liminal rites.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In these modern societies, rites are diminished and 'forged the concept of "liminoid" rituals for analogous but secular phenomena' such as attending rock concerts and other&lt;ref&gt; Illouz, ''Consuming'' p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; liminoid experiences.

The fading of liminal stages in exchange for liminoid experiences is marked by the shift in culture from tribal and agrarian to modern and industrial. In these societies, work and play are entirely separate whereas in more archaic societies, they are nearly indistinguishable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the past play was interwoven with the nature of work as symbolic gestures and rites in order to promote fertility, abundance, and the passage of certain liminal phases; thus, work and play are inseparable and often dependent on social rites&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Examples of this include Cherokee and Mayan riddles, trickster tales, sacred ball games, and joking relationships which serve holy purposes of work in liminal situations while retaining the element of playfulness.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Ritual and myth were, in the past, exclusively connected to collective work that served holy and often symbolic purposes; liminal rites were held in the form of coming-of-age ceremonies, celebrations of seasons, and more. Industrialization cut the cord between work and the sacred, putting "work" and "play" in separate boxes that rarely, if ever, intersected. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In a famous essay regarding the shift to liminal to liminoid in industrial society, Turner offers a twofold explanation of this sect. First, society began to move away from activities concerning collective ritual obligations, placing more emphasis on the individual than the community; this led to more choice in activities, with many such as work and leisure becoming optional. Second, the work done to earn a living became entirely separate from his or her other activities so that it is "no longer natural, but arbitrary."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In simpler terms, the industrial revolution brought about free time that had not existed in past societies and created space for liminoid experiences to exist.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Types of Liminoid Experiences ===

==== Sports ====
Sporting events such as the Olympics, NFL football games, and hockey matches are forms of liminoid experiences. They are optional activities of leisure that place both the spectator and the competitor in in-between places outside of society's norms. Sporting events also create a sense of community among fans and reinforces the collective spirit of those who take part.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=RIOZwUzy0vsC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA127&amp;dq=liminoid&amp;ots=AQGD79gCAS&amp;sig=kfUSHa6p5gBzA_n3vZAnIhIPc9A#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Victor Turner and Contemporary Cultural Performance|last=John|first=Graham St|date=2008-04-01|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=9780857450371|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Homecoming football games, gymnastics meets, modern baseball games, and swim meets all qualify as liminoid and follow a seasonal schedule; therefore, the flow of sports becomes cyclical and predictable, reinforcing the liminal qualities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Flying ====
Airplane travel is inherently liminoid-suspended in the sky, neither here nor there and crossing thresholds of time and space, it is difficult to make sense of the experience of flying.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murphy|first=Alexandra G.|date=2002-10|title=Organizational Politics of Place and Space: The Perpetual Liminoid Performance of Commercial Flight|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/10462930208616175|journal=Text and Performance Quarterly|language=en|volume=22|issue=4|pages=297–316|doi=10.1080/10462930208616175|issn=1046-2937}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flights shift our existence into a limbo space in which movement becomes an accepted set of cultural performances aimed at convincing us that air travel is a reflection of reality rather than a separation from it.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

A '''media event,''' also known as a pseudo-event,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scherer|first1=Helmut|title=Media Events and Pseudo-Events|url=http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405131995_chunk_g978140513199518_ss36-1|website=Blackwell Reference Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an event or activity conducted for the purpose of media [[publicity]]. It may also include any event that is covered in the [[mass media]] or was hosted largely with the media in mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Media events may center on a news announcement, an [[anniversary]], a [[news conference]], or planned events like speeches or demonstrations.  Instead of paying for advertising time, a media or pseudo-event seeks to use [[public relations]] to gain media and public attention.

The term pseudo-event was coined by the [[theorist]] and [[historian]] [[Daniel J. Boorstin]] in his 1961 book ''[[The Image: A Guide to Pseudo-events in America]]'': “The celebration is held, [[Photo Op|photographs are taken]], the occasion is widely reported.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boorstin|first=Daniel Joseph
 |title=The image: A guide to pseudo-events in America
 |publisher=Vintage|location=New York|year=1961|isbn=0-679-74180-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is closely related to idea of [[hyperreality]] and thus [[postmodernism]], although Boorstin’s coinage  predates the two ideas and related work of postmodern thinkers such as [[Jean Baudrillard]]. A media event being a kind of [[Event management|planned event]], it may be called [[Authenticity (philosophy)|inauthentic]] in contrast to a spontaneous one.

In distinguishing between a pseudo-event and a spontaneous one, Boorstin states characteristics of a pseudo-event in his book titled "Hidden History."  He says that a pseudo-event is: dramatic, repeatable, costly, intellectually planned, and social.  It causes other pseudo-events, and one must know about it to be considered "informed".&lt;ref&gt;Boorstin, D. Hidden History. Harper &amp; Row, 1987. 279-280. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, Elihu Katz outlines the defining characteristics of a media event as: immediate (i.e., it is broadcast live), organized by a non-media entity, containing ceremonial and dramatic value, preplanning, and centering on a personality, whether that be a single person or a group&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Katz|first1=Elihu|title=Media Events: The Sense of Occasion|url=http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1271&amp;context=asc_papers|website=University of Pennsylvania ScholarlyCommons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of [[video art]]ists have explored the concept of a pseudo-event. The group [[Ant Farm (group)|Ant Farm]] especially plays with pseudo events, though not so identified, in their works "Media Burn" (1975) and "[[The Eternal Frame]]" (1975).

==Types ==
[[File:Madrid 2020 bid - 130907 203400.jpg|thumb|upright|Madrid sends its bid for the [[2020 Summer Olympics]]]]
A [[news conference]] is often held when an organization wants members of the press to get an announcement simultaneously. The in-person events may include interviews, questioning, and show-and-tell.

Media events like news conferences can come to be expected, especially before, during, and after sporting events, and the [[National Football League]] demands that its players provide a weekly media event by taking postgame questions from reporters.  When Seattle Seahawks running back [[Marshawn Lynch]] dressed and left the stadium after a loss on Nov. 16, 2014, the NFL fined him $100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Werder|first1=Ed|title=Silence Costs Marshawn Lynch $100K|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/11904067/nfl-takes-100k-seattle-seahawks-marshawn-lynch-media-silence|website=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Award ceremony|Award ceremonies]], red carpet events and celebrity [[photo op]]portunities are all considered a type of media event, where the event is orchestrated for the purpose of introducing a chosen narrative into the media.

[[Sex tape|Sex tapes]] when created with the intention of being 'leaked' are a form of pseudo event because their purpose is to generate media attention.

A [[protest]] may be planned almost exclusively for the purpose of getting media attention to an issue or cause.

[[Political convention|Political conventions]], or planned presentations or speeches about company earnings or political issues, are a form of media event.

== Historic examples ==
Media events became prominent when the media did. The driving of the [[Golden Spike]] in [[Promontory Summit, Utah]], in 1869 has been described as one of the first media events in the United States.  [[Edward Bernays]] and his [[Torches of Freedom]] campaign in 1929 is an example of an early media event that successfully influenced public opinion.  Similarly, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] visit to the United States in 1959 was highly influential, and has been cited as the first example of media events being utilised in politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Media events became practical in the middle 19th century as the Morse [[telegraph]] and the expansion of [[daily newspaper]]s introduced same-day [[news cycle]]s.  The emergence of the internet led to many media stories being published live from the media event, real-time Twitter coverage, and immediate analysis of televised media events. When musical artist [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] pretended to take questions during his [[Super Bowl]] press conference but instead broke immediately into song, his performance itself became a meta media-event-within-a-media-event&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prince--The Super Bowl Press Conference 2007|url=http://www.wat.tv/video/prince-the-superbowl-press-6pq1b_2hztv_.html|website=Wat|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109225101/http://www.wat.tv/video/prince-the-superbowl-press-6pq1b_2hztv_.html|archivedate=2015-01-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6028">'''Metaphoric criticism''' is one school of [[rhetoric]]al analysis used in English and speech communication studies. Scholars employing metaphoric criticism analyze texts by locating metaphors within texts and evaluating those metaphors in an effort to better understand ways in which authors appeal to their audiences.

==Origins==
The term "metaphor" can be traced to the trope described by Aristotle in both his ''Rhetoric'' and ''Poetics'' as a comparison of two dissimilar objects or concepts in an effort to relate one to the other. James DeMille, in ''The Elements of Rhetoric'', defines metaphor as "an implied comparison between two things of unlike nature, for example, 'The colorful display was a magnet for anybody in the room.'"&lt;ref&gt;DeMille, James. (1878). "The Elements of Rhetoric." New York: Harper and Brothers.&lt;/ref&gt; Using DeMille’s example, a critic studying metaphor would explore how normally "display" and "magnet" are not considered synonyms. However, in using "magnet" as a metaphor, the above sentence implies that the "display" possess properties of a magnet and draws objects—or, in this case, people—in the room toward it.

In a broader sense, metaphoric criticism can illuminate the world in which we live by analyzing the language—and, in particular, the metaphors—that surround us. The notion that metaphors demonstrate worldviews originates in the work of [[Kenneth Burke]] and has been taken up further in the cognitive sciences, particularly by [[George Lakoff]].

==Application==
Metaphoric criticism focuses on analysis of texts that use metaphors effectively or ineffectively as part of their argument structure. For example, in an article entitled "Five Years After 9/11: Drop the War Metaphor," George Lakoff and Evan Frisch analyze how President Bush’s adoption of a "war" metaphor in order to discuss his approach to dealing with terrorism as opposed to a "crime" metaphor provides a barrier from critics for him to move forward with the War in Iraq. Lakoff illustrates the power of the "war" metaphor: "The war metaphor defined war as the only way to defend the nation. From within the war metaphor, being against war as a response was to be unpatriotic, to be against defending the nation. The war metaphor put progressives on the defensive."&lt;ref&gt;Lakoff, George, and Evan Frisch. (2006) "[http://www.rockridgeinstitute.org/research/rockridge/fiveyearsafter911 Five Years After 9/11: Drop the War Metaphor.] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20060927081227/http://www.rockridgeinstitute.org/research/rockridge/fiveyearsafter911 |date=2006-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;" Rhetorical critics would not only make these observations in their own criticism, but would also relate to the effect on the audience, and how the metaphor either enhances or challenges the audience’s worldview.

Critics examining metaphor have in recent years also started to examine metaphor in visual and electronic media. For example, metaphors can be found in rhetorical presidential television ads. In 1984, President Ronald Reagan’s campaign sponsored a commercial showing a grizzly bear as posing a potentially large threat to the United States. The USSR is never named in that ad, however the assumption of the campaign was that Americans would clearly recognize the "enemy" that the bear represents.

==Conduction==
In ''Rhetorical Criticism'',&lt;ref&gt;Foss, Sonja K. (1995). ''Rhetorical Criticism: Exploration and Practice.'' 2nd edition. Long Grove, IL: Waveland Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Sonja K. Foss outlines a four-step procedure for applying metaphoric criticism to texts:

# First, the critic reads or views the entire artifact with specific attention to its context.
# Second, to the critic isolates the metaphor(s) within the text, both obvious and more subtle substitutions of meaning. Here Foss invokes Max Black's interaction theory of "tenor" (the principal subject or focus) and "vehicle" (secondary subject or frame for the metaphor), a method to analyze ways in which the related dissimilar objects actually share similar characteristics.
# Third, the critic sorts the metaphors and look for patterns of use within the text. The more comprehensive the text, the longer this step will take.
# The critic analyzes the metaphor(s) or groups of metaphors in the artifact to reveal how their structure may affect the intended audience. Foss writes, "Here, the critic suggests what effects the use of the various metaphors may have on the audience and how the metaphors function to argue for a particular attitude toward the ideas presented."

==Description==
[[File:Etruscan chariot wheel.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Close up on the wheel of the chariot.]]
The Monteleone chariot was part of a [[chariot burial]], containing the remains of two human corpses, along with two drinking cups. Measuring 131&amp;nbsp;cm in height and designed to be drawn by two horses, the chariot itself is constructed of wood covered with hammered bronze plates and carved ivory decoration. The bronze plates are decorated with Homeric iconography; the main panel depicts [[Achilles]] being handed his armor by his mother, [[Thetis]]. The chariot's frame and plating is additionally adorned with animals and mythological creatures, rendered in detail. The chariot's decorations would also have included inlaid amber and other exotic materials, but only the bronze and ivory decorations have survived. The chariot's wheels have nine [[spoke]]s (rather than the classical Greek four, the Egyptian six, or the Assyrian and Persian eight; excavated chariots from Celtic burials have up to twelve spokes).

Contemporary curators at the Museum had long suspected that the chariot's original 1903 reconstruction was not historically accurate. In 1989, under the direction of Italian archaeologist [[Adriana Emiliozzi]], the Metropolitan Museum began a five-year reexamination and restoration of the chariot. During the restoration, it was discovered that the chariot had in fact been originally assembled incorrectly; additionally, evidence was uncovered indicating that the chariot, previously thought to have seen little actual use, had in fact been involved in a serious accident at some point during its life.&lt;ref name=nytimes1&gt;{{cite news|last=Vogel|first=Carol|title=A More Precise Version of Your Chariot Awaits|publisher=The New York Times|date=2007-03-29|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/29/arts/design/29char.html?ex=1332820800&amp;en=accf307e2331452e&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss|accessdate=2007-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newly restored chariot's reinstallation was scheduled as part of the major renovations of the Metropolitan Museum's Greek and Roman galleries, opening to the public on April 20, 2007.

==History==
[[File:Bronze chariot inlaid with ivory MET DP137936.jpg|thumb|250px|Monteleone chariot]]
[[File:Bronze chariot inlaid with ivory MET DP137946.jpg|thumb|250px|]]
It was found in 1902 in [[Monteleone di Spoleto]], near [[Spoleto]] in the [[Provinces_of_Italy#Kingdom_of_Italy|province]] of [[Umbria]], by a farmer named Isidoro Vannozzi who inadvertently unearthed it while digging a wine cellar or basement barn. Its history from that time is the subject of controversy. According to some accounts, Vannozzi hid the chariot in his barn, concerned that the authorities might confiscate it, and later sold it to two Frenchmen in exchange for two cows. Another account, related by Vannozzi's son Giuseppe, holds that the chariot was immediately sold as scrap metal, and the proceeds from the sale used to buy roof tiles.&lt;ref name=nytimes2&gt;{{cite news|last=Povoledo|first=Elisabetta|title=Umbrian Umbrage: Send Back That Etruscan Chariot|publisher=The New York Times|date=2007-04-05|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/05/arts/design/05char.html?ex=1333425600&amp;en=2b186de026816a09&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss|accessdate=2007-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changing hands several times after its initial sale, the chariot was eventually purchased in Paris by [[J. P. Morgan]], who sent it to the Metropolitan Museum in 1903, where its first restoration took place.

Because the museum's acquisition of the chariot in 1903 predates by six years Italy's first laws restricting export of items that carry "cultural and artistic values," the chariot's sale was legal at the time of purchase, though debated by the contemporary press.&lt;ref name="nytimes2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="patrimoniosos1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Galli|first=Paola|title=Cultural assets for sale.

The Metropolitan Museum has responded that the chariot was "purchased in good faith".&lt;ref name="nytimes2" /&gt;  A full-size copy was made in the mid-20th century, which is on display in Monteleone.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="57537">[[File:Palacky Court Room 1.JPG|thumb|A law school's moot courtroom]]
'''Moot court''' is an [[extracurricular activity]] at many [[law school]]s in which participants take part in simulated court or [[arbitration]] proceedings, usually involving drafting memorials or memoranda and participating in [[oral argument]]. In most countries, the phrase "moot court" may be shortened to simply "moot" or "mooting". Participants are either referred to as "mooters" or, less conventionally, "mooties".

Moot court involves a simulated [[appellate court]] (appellate advocacy) or arbitral case, which is different from a [[mock trial]] that involves a simulated [[jury trial]] or [[bench trial]] (trial advocacy). Moot court does not involve actual [[testimony]] by witnesses, [[cross-examination]], or the presentation of [[evidence law|evidence]], but is focused solely on the application of the law to a common set of evidentiary assumptions, facts, and clarifications/corrections to which the competitors are introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pattinson|first=Shaun D.|last2=Kind|first2=Vanessa|date=2017-09-12|title=Using a moot to develop students’ understanding of human cloning and statutory interpretation|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0968533217726350|journal=Medical Law International|language=en|doi=10.1177/0968533217726350}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though not a moot in the traditional sense, [[alternative dispute resolution]] competitions focusing on [[mediation]] and [[negotiation]] have also branded themselves as moot competitions in recent times, as had role-playing competitions in the past.

Moot court is one of the key extracurricular activities in many law schools (the others being [[law review]] and [[legal clinic|clinical work]] around the world). Depending on the competition, students may spend a semester researching and writing the written submissions or memorials, and another semester practicing their oral arguments, or may prepare both within the span of a few weeks. Whereas domestic moot court competitions tend to focus on municipal law such as [[criminal law]] or [[contract law]], regional and international moot competitions tend to focus on subjects such as [[public international law]], [[international human rights law]], [[international humanitarian law]], [[international criminal law]], [[international trade law]], international [[maritime law]], international commercial [[arbitration]], and [[foreign direct investment]] arbitration. [[Procedural law|Procedural issues]] pertaining to [[jurisdiction]], [[standing (law)|standing]], and [[choice of law]] are also occasionally engaged, especially in arbitration moots.

In most moot court competitions, each side is represented by two speakers or oralists (though the entire team composition may be larger) and a third member, sometimes known as of counsel, may be seated with the speakers. Each speaker usually speaks between 10 and 25 minutes, covering one to three main issues. After the main submissions are completed, there will usually be a short round of rebuttal and even surrebuttal. Depending on the format of the moot, there may be one or two rounds of rebuttal and surrebuttal, and communications between speakers may or may not be prohibited. Throughout the course of the submissions, judges may ask questions, though in some competitions questions are reserved to the end of submissions. In larger competitions, teams have to participate in up to ten rounds; the knockout/elimination stages are usually preceded by a number of preliminary rounds to determine seeding (power seeding is often used). Teams almost always must switch sides (applicant/appellant/claimant on one side, and respondent on the other) throughout a competition, and, depending on the format of the moot, the moot problem usually remains the same throughout. The scores of the written submissions are taken into consideration for most competitions to determine qualification and seeding, and sometimes even up to a particular knockout stage.

==International moot court competitions==
International moot competitions are generally targeted at students and only allow participants who have not [[bar examination|qualified to practice law]] in any jurisdiction. However, there are a handful of international moot competitions that are targeted at young lawyers, such as the [[Essex Court Chambers-Singapore Academy of Law Moot|ECC-SAL Moot]], which is a regional moot started in 2012 and is jointly organised by [[Essex Court Chambers]] and the [[Singapore Academy of Law]]. 

The first table below lists some of the more notable international moot competitions for students, the second table lists the champions and finalists for the major or grand slam competitions, while the third and final table lists the champions and finalists for the minors and regionals. Major or grand slam international moots typically refer to class-leading moots or those that attract a substantial number of teams, while smaller or less established and region-only competitions are known as minors and regionals respectively; "international" class moots are sandwiched between grand slams and minors and regionals in terms of scale and prestige.&lt;ref name="lawgazette.com.sg1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lawgazette.com.sg/news/events/another-season-record-breaking-international-moot-court-achievements-smu/|title=Another Season of Record-Breaking International Moot Court Achievements (SMU) - The Singapore Law Gazette|date=1 November 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/smu-team-wins-moot-contest-in-the-hague|title=SMU team wins moot contest in The Hague|first=|last=hermes|date=15 June 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lawgazette18"/&gt; Some countries also divide competitions into various tiers of prestige for the purpose of awarding points in league tables, with moots such as the [[Jessup Moot|Jessup]] and [[Vis Moot|Vis]] competitions being considered as belonging to the highest tier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.legallyindia.com/the-bench-and-the-bar/mooting-premier-league-is-back-mpl-7-sees-nliu-nalsar-uils-nls-lead-after-strong-start-in-2016-00011130-8208|title=Mooting Premier League is back: MPL 7 sees Nalsar, UILS, NLS, NLIU lead after strong 2016 start|first=Kian|last=Ganz|website=www.legallyindia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Operation====
Law schools structure their moot court programs differently. Some moot court organizations accept a small group of people for membership, and those members each participate in a number of national or regional moot court competitions. Other schools accept a larger number of members, and each member is matched with one competition. A few schools conduct moot court entirely intramurally. Moot court competitions are typically sponsored by organizations with interest in one particular area of law, and the moot court problems address an issue in that field. Competitions are often judged by legal practitioners with expertise in the particular area of law, or sometimes by sitting judges.

The basic structure of a moot court competition roughly parallels what would happen in actual appellate practice. Participants will typically receive a problem ahead of time, which includes the facts of the underlying case, and often an [[Legal opinion|opinion]] from a lower court that is being challenged in the problem. Students must then research and prepare for that case as if they were lawyers or advocates for one or sometimes both of the parties. Depending on the competition, participants will be required to submit written [[legal brief|briefs]], participate in oral argument, or both. The case or problem is often one of current interest, sometimes mimicking an actual case, and sometimes fabricated to address difficult legal issues.

A number of moot court competitions focus on specific areas of law. For example, the [[First Amendment Center]] annually holds a National First Amendment Moot Court Competition, in which the judges have included numerous [[United States court of appeals|United States Circuit Court]] judges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/about.aspx?item=moot_court National First Amendment Moot Court Competition].&lt;/ref&gt;

====The American Collegiate Moot Court Association====
{{refimprove section|date=February 2013}}
In the United States, undergraduates experience moot court in a variety of disciplines and a variety of settings. The most common are in-class exercises that are assigned by professors. Other schools actually form competitive teams. These teams often compete in intramural events, some in statewide competitions, or they can enter tournaments sponsored by the [[American Collegiate Moot Court Association]]. While undergraduate moot court is still a relatively new [[forensics]] activity, when compared with speech and debate and intercollegiate [[mock trial]], by 2010, there were 248 teams who competed at the regional tournaments. The regional tournaments vary by size, but there is a standardized process for awarding bids to nationals. Currently, teams that finish in the top 25 percent of each regional earn an automatic bid to the national tournament. The remainder of the 64 team field is awarded to at-large teams with the best records at the qualifying events. No school can earn more than eight bids to the national field. ACMA tournaments currently have three preliminary rounds and a series of elimination rounds are very much like the “sudden death”/”one-and-done” nature of the NCAA basketball tournament. The qualifying tournaments are held during the fall semester, most are in November, and the championship tournament is in mid-January.

Undergraduate moot court cases pose two certified questions. The case (known as the “record”) includes an appellate majority opinion and a dissent. The “library” is a closed one. Typically, the record includes twenty opinions that students can rely upon for their arguments. Rules allow them to refer to cases cited in the cases directly included in the record. However, they can only rely on these cases within cases to the degree that they were used by the authorities directly in the record. All teams competing in ACMA-sponsored events will argue the same case. ACMA students have engaged in oral argument on issues such as [[same-sex marriage]], national health care, privacy under the 4th Amendment, life terms for minors who are not guilty of [[murder]] or [[attempted murder]], [[freedom of religion]], a federal ban on firearms on school grounds, and warrantless domestic [[wiretapping]] of suspected terrorists. Cases are written by the ACMA. The case problem is released on the ACMA website by May 1 of each year.

Undergraduate moot court teams consist of two oral advocates. The advocates are responsible for knowing both issues&amp;nbsp;– but typically are only asked about one certified question. Each team will receive 20 minutes to argue its case, and each advocate must speak for a minimum of seven minutes. Teams are judged on their forensics, knowledge of the law, demeanor, and ability to answer questions from the bench.

Good judges are the key to a good moot court hearing. Judges are typically lawyers or members of the state or federal bench. At times, law students (especially those with past undergraduate moot court experience) are asked to judge. Past judges at ACMA events have included former US Attorney General [[John Ashcroft]] and federal judges [[Otis Wright]] and [[George Schiavelli]].

The ACMA also sponsors a brief writing contest. Students are not required to prepare briefs in order to compete for the oral advocacy national title. Teams who enter follow a specific set of rules and compete for prizes. The competition is judged by lawyers and law professors. This competition is named for the late Sandra Knerr, who along with her husband, was a dedicated supporter of intercollegiate moot court.

===United Kingdom===
The courts systems differ in various parts of the [[United Kingdom]]. Thus, the style of a moot will often vary depending in which jurisdiction it is to be heard, although some national competitions do exist. The principal differences are between the laws in [[Scotland]] and those in [[England and Wales]].

====England and Wales====
In England and Wales the moot will typically simulate proceedings in either the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] or the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]]. Moot questions generally involve two [[questions of law]] that are under dispute and come with a set of facts about the case that have been decided at the first instance trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstlight.demon.co.uk/law/mooting/first.html#facts|title=Mooting Net - How to Moot I|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally the question will surround a subject that is unclear under the present state of the law and for which no direct precedent exists. Mooting is a team effort, consisting of senior or lead [[counsel]] and junior counsel. It is normal practice for the senior counsel to take on the first point and the junior the second; although this may vary depending upon the exact nature, and necessary length, of the arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstlight.demon.co.uk/law/mooting/first.html#split|title=Mooting Net - How to Moot I&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically the question will focus on one area of law, e.g. [[tort]], [[contract]], [[criminal law]] or [[property law]].

The question will be provided to the teams a few weeks in advance of the moot along with details as to which of the [[appellant]] or [[wikt:respondent|respondent]] they are to represent. It is then up to each team to prepare their case as though they were [[barrister]]s. Authority for each argument is necessary and will usually take the form of precedent from [[case law]] but may also involve [[legislation]]. Reliance may also be placed on governmental papers, research from [[NGO]]s and academic journals and texts.

A few days before the moot takes place each team will prepare and exchange their skeleton arguments or [[legal brief|brief]]. Copies will also be provided to the judge along with the moot problem. The judge is normally an academic or practising solicitor or barrister. The moot itself takes the form of an [[oral argument]]. The competition may also allow the appellants an additional few minutes in order to reply to the respondents arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstlight.demon.co.uk/law/mooting/day.html#reply|title=Mooting Net - How to Moot II&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the presentation of arguments has concluded, the judge will retire to deliberate on both the law and the overall winning of the moot. A moot is not won and lost on the legal argument, but on the advocacy skills of the participants. It is often the case that the team that has the weaker legal argument is in a better position as they have to argue that much more persuasively.

====Scotland====
In [[Scots Law|Scotland]] a moot can be set in a variety of fora; in civil law problems it is set most commonly in either the Inner House of the [[Court of Session]] or in the [[House of Lords]], although it is not uncommon for a moot to be heard in the [[Sheriff Court]] before the Sheriff or Sheriff Principal. Occasionally, an [[Employment Appeal Tribunal]] may also be used as a forum for a Scottish civil law moot. If the moot problem concerns Criminal Law, the moot will most likely be heard as though in the Appellate division of the [[High Court of Justiciary]] (commonly known as the Court of Criminal Appeal).

The moot points and style of the problem are similar to that of England and Wales stated above; however, the format of the moot is significantly different. Junior counsel is more likely to take the first moot point and senior counsel the second (this can however be reversed depending on the problem). The format of the moot is far more adversarial than that of English and Welsh moots. This is primarily due to a more adversarial legal system. This manifests itself in different ways, most notably with the appellants and respondents facing each other during a moot, rather than, as in England and Wales, facing the judge.

There is only one national Scottish competition, the Alexander Stone National Legal Debate, administered by the Law School at the [[University of Glasgow]]. All Scottish universities that offer the LL.B. are eligible to take part, although in recent years the competition has been fought out mainly between Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Strathclyde universities. The final is held in the Alexander Stone Court Room at the University of Glasgow in February or March each year. There are also several annual inter-varsity competitions between law schools, including the Glasgow Sheriff's Cup (the University of Glasgow v the University of Strathclyde) and the Granite City Moot ([[the University of Aberdeen]] v [[Robert Gordon University]]). These competitions are ordinarily judged by a [[Senator of the College of Justice]]. 

Law schools also take part in UK-wide competitions, such as the [[Oxford University Press]] and the [[English Speaking Union Moot]]. These moots are UK-wide in participation, but typically follow the style and law of moots in England and Wales. The University of Glasgow reached the semi-final of the English Speaking Union moot in 2008 and the final in 2005. The University of Dundee reached the semi finals of The Oxford University Press moots in 2009.

Judges in Scottish moots are typically legal academics, solicitors, sheriffs, advocates or Senators of the College of Justice.

===India===
Surana and Surana International Attorneys have been conducting various moot competitions from mid 1990s including Surana &amp; Surana International Technology Law Moot Court Competition, Surana &amp; Surana National Corporate Law Moot Court Competition, and [[Surana and Surana Moots|Surana &amp; Surana National Trial Advocacy Moot Court Competition]].

[[File:31012016-img114.jpg|thumb|Statue of mother with children at the [[Monumental Cemetery of Staglieno]]]]

A '''mother''' is the [[female]] parent of a [[child]]. Mothers are [[women]] who inhabit or perform the role of bearing some relation to their [[children]], who may or may not be their biological [[offspring]]. Thus, dependent on the context, women can be considered mothers by virtue of having given [[birth]], by raising their child(ren), supplying their ovum for [[fertilisation]], or some combination thereof. Such conditions provide a way of delineating the concept of motherhood, or the state of being a mother. Women who meet the third and first categories usually fall under the terms 'birth mother' or 'biological mother', regardless of whether the individual in question goes on to parent their child. Accordingly, a woman who meets only the second condition may be considered an [[adoption|adoptive]] mother, and those who meet only the third a [[surrogate pregnancy|surrogacy]] mother.

The above concepts defining the role of mother are neither exhaustive nor universal, as any definition of 'mother' may vary based on how social, cultural, and religious roles are defined. The parallel conditions and terms for males: those who are (typically biologically) [[father]]s do not, by definition, take up the role of fatherhood.

==Biological mother==
[[File:Countries by Birth Rate in 2014.svg|thumb|Countries by crude birth rate (CBR) in 2014. Birth rates are lowest in Western countries.]]
Biological motherhood for [[human]]s, as in other [[mammal]]s, occurs when a [[pregnant]] female gestates a fertilized ovum (the "egg"). A female can become pregnant through [[sexual intercourse]] after she has begun to [[ovulate]]. In well-nourished girls, [[menarche]] (the first [[menstrual cycle|menstrual period]])  usually takes place around the age of 12 or 13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/589004_3|title=Medscape: Medscape Access|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, a [[fetus]] develops from the viable [[zygote]], resulting in an [[embryo]]. [[Gestation]] occurs in the woman's [[uterus]] until the fetus (assuming it is carried to [[Pregnancy duration|term]]) is sufficiently developed to be born. In humans, gestation is often around 9 months in duration, after which the woman experiences labor and gives birth. This is not always the case, however, as some babies are born [[preterm birth|prematurely]], late, or in the case of [[stillbirth]], do not survive gestation. Usually, once the baby is born, the mother produces [[milk]] via the [[lactation]] process. The mother's [[breast milk]] is the source of [[antibodies]] for the infant's [[immune system]], and commonly the sole source of nutrition for newborns before they are able to eat and digest other foods; older infants and toddlers may continue to be breastfed, in combination with other foods, which should be introduced from approximately six months of age.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/solid-foods-weaning/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Childlessness]] is the state of not having children. Childlessness may have personal, social or political significance. Childlessness may be [[voluntary childlessness]], which occurs by choice, or may be involuntary due to health problems or social circumstances. Motherhood is usually voluntary, but may also be the result of [[forced pregnancy]], such as [[pregnancy from rape]]. Unwanted motherhood occurs especially in cultures which practice [[forced marriage]] and [[child marriage]].

==Non-biological mother==
''Mother'' can often apply to a woman other than the biological parent, especially if she fulfills the main social role in raising the child. This is commonly either an [[adoptive]] mother or a [[stepmother]] (the biologically unrelated [[Significant other|partner]] of a child's [[father]]). The term "[[othermother]]" or "other mother" is also used in some contexts for women who provide care for a child not biologically their own in addition to the child's primary mother.

Adoption, in various forms, has been practiced throughout history, even predating human civilization.&lt;ref name="Conn2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Conn|title=Adoption: A Brief Social and Cultural History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DoUh9LvIzRcC&amp;pg=PA25|date=28 January 2013|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-137-33390-2|pages=25–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern systems of adoption, arising in the 20th century, tend to be governed by comprehensive [[statutes]] and [[regulations]]. In recent decades, [[international adoption]]s have become more and more common.

[[Adoption in the United States]] is common and relatively easy from a legal point of view (compared to other Western countries).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jardine|first=Cassandra|title=Why adoption is so easy in America|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/3354960/Why-adoption-is-so-easy-in-America.html|newspaper=Telegraph|date=31 Oct 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, with over 127,000 adoptions, the US accounted for nearly half of the total number of adoptions worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/pdf/policy/child-adoption.pdf |format=PDF |title=Child Adoption : Trends and Policies |publisher=Un.org |accessdate=2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surrogate mother===
{{Main|Surrogacy}}
A surrogate mother is a woman who bears a child that came from another woman's fertilized ovum on behalf of a couple unable to give birth to children. Thus the surrogate mother carries and gives birth to a child that she is not the biological mother of. Surrogate motherhood became possible with advances in [[reproductive technologies]], such as [[in vitro]] fertilization.

Not all women who become pregnant via in vitro fertilization are surrogate mothers. Surrogacy involves both a genetic mother, who provides the ovum, and a gestational (or surrogate) mother, who carries the child to term.

===Motherhood in same-sex relationships===
The possibility for lesbian and bisexual women in [[same-sex relationship]]s (or women without a partner) to become mothers has increased over the past few decades{{when|date=October 2014}} due to technological developments. Modern [[gay parenting|lesbian parenting]] (a term that somewhat [[bisexual erasure|erases]] the bisexual case) originated with women who were in heterosexual relationships who later identified as lesbian or bisexual, as changing attitudes provided more acceptance for non-heterosexual relationships. Another way for such women to become mothers is through [[LGBT adoption|adopting]] or [[foster parent]]ing. There is also the option of self-[[insemination]] and clinically assisted donor insemination, forms of [[artificial insemination]]. As fertility technology has advanced, more females not in a heterosexual relationship have become mothers through [[in vitro fertilization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://find.galegroup.com/gtx/infomark.do?&amp;contentSet=IAC-Documents&amp;type=retrieve&amp;tabID=T002&amp;prodId=AONE&amp;docId=A96237890&amp;source=gale&amp;userGroupName=wash_main&amp;version=1.0 |title=Lesbian parenting: issues, strengths and challenges |accessdate=2011-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hooks2000"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Mezey, Nancy J |title=New Choices, New Families: How Lesbians Decide about Motherhood |year=2008 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |isbn=978-0-8018-9000-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The social roles associated with motherhood are variable across time, culture, and social class.

Regarding [[women in the workforce]], mothers often entail a [[mommy track]] rather than being entirely "[[career women]]". Mothers may be [[Housewife|stay at home mothers]] or [[Working parent|working mothers]]. In recent decades there has been an increase in [[Stay-at-home dad|stay at home fathers]] too. Social views on these arrangements vary significantly by culture: in Europe for instance, in German-speaking countries there is a strong tradition of mothers exiting the workforce and being homemakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ined.fr/fichier/s_rubrique/26128/540.population.societies.2017.january.en.pdf|format=PDF|title=Has childlessness peaked in Europe? |website=Ined.fr|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mothers have historically fulfilled the primary role in raising children, but since the late 20th century, the role of the father in child care has been given greater prominence and social acceptance in some Western countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pascal.iseg.utl.pt/~cisep/conferencias/conferencia_20021016/Papers/kjeldstad55.PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130815170110/http://pascal.iseg.utl.pt/~cisep/conferencias/conferencia_20021016/Papers/kjeldstad55.PDF|date=August 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucgstp.org/lit/gn/gn064/fathersimportant.htm |title=ucgstp.org |publisher=Ucgstp.org |date= |accessdate=2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 20th century also saw more and more women entering paid work. [[Mothers' rights]] within the workforce include [[maternity leave]] and [[parental leave]].

The social role and experience of motherhood varies greatly depending upon location. Mothers are more likely than fathers to encourage assimilative and communion-enhancing patterns in their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ann M. Berghout Austin1 and T.J.

Since the 1970s, [[in vitro fertilization]] has made pregnancy possible at ages well beyond "natural" limits, generating ethical controversy and forcing significant changes in the social meaning of motherhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacob-m-appel/motherhood-is-it-ever-too_b_233916.html |title=Motherhood: Is It Ever Too Late? &amp;#124; Jacob M.

Traditionally, and still in most parts of the world today, a mother was expected to be a [[married]] woman, with birth outside of marriage carrying a strong [[social stigma]]. Historically, this stigma not only applied to the mother, but also to her child. This continues to be the case in many parts of the developing world today, but in many Western countries the situation has changed radically, with single motherhood being much more socially acceptable now. For more details on these subjects, see [[Legitimacy (family law)]] and [[single parent]].

The total fertility rate (TFR), that is, the number of children born per woman, differs greatly from country to country. The TFR in 2013 was estimated to be highest in [[Niger]] (7.03 children born per woman) and lowest in [[Singapore]] (0.79 children/woman).&lt;ref name="cia.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2127rank.html|title=The World Factbook|work=cia.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], the TFR was estimated for 2013 at 2.06 births per woman.&lt;ref name="cia.gov"/&gt; In 2011, the average age at first birth was 25.6 and 40.7% of births were to unmarried women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/births.htm|title=FastStats|work=cdc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''maternal death'' is defined by [[World Health Organization|WHO]] as "the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management but not from accidental or incidental causes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/statistics/indmaternalmortality/en/|title=WHO - Maternal mortality ratio (per 100 000 live births)|work=who.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the organization [[Save the Children]] has [[Save the Children State of the World's Mothers report|ranked]] the countries of the world, and found that [[Scandinavia]]n countries are the safest places to give birth, whereas countries in sub-Saharan Africa are the least safe to give birth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savethechildren.net/alliance/what_we_do/newsdesk/2006-05-08b.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012211639/http://www.savethechildren.net/alliance/what_we_do/newsdesk/2006-05-08b.html|date=October 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study argues a mother in the bottom ten ranked countries is over 750 times more likely to [[maternal mortality|die in pregnancy or childbirth]], compared to a mother in the top ten ranked countries, and a mother in the bottom ten ranked countries is 28 times more likely to [[infant mortality|see her child die]] before reaching their first birthday.

The most recent data suggests that [[Italy]], [[Sweden]] and [[Luxembourg]] are the safest countries in terms of maternal death and [[Afghanistan]], [[Central African Republic]] and [[Malawi]] are the most dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newser.com/story/86023/safest-place-to-give-birth-italy.html|title=Safest Place to Give Birth?

[[Childbirth]] is an inherently dangerous and risky procedure, subject to many complications. The "natural" mortality rate of childbirth—where nothing is done to avert maternal death—has been estimated as being 1500 deaths per 100,000 births.&lt;ref name="vanlerberghe"&gt;Van Lerberghe W, De Brouwere V.

Antwerp, ITG Press, 2001 (Studies in Health Services Organisation and Policy, 17:7–33).  "Where nothing effective is done to avert maternal death, "natural" mortality is probably of the order of magnitude of 1,500/100,000."&lt;/ref&gt; Modern medicine has greatly alleviated the risk of childbirth. In modern Western countries the current maternal mortality rate is around 10 deaths per 100,000 births.&lt;ref&gt;''ibid'', p10&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Mama and papa}}
The proverbial "first word" of an infant often sounds like "ma" or "mama". This strong association of that sound with "mother" has persisted in nearly every language on earth, countering the natural localization of language.

Familiar or colloquial terms for ''mother'' in English are:
* ''Ma''(মা), ''Amma'' (আম্মা), ''Ammu'' (আম্মু) used in [[Bangladesh]]
* ''Aama'', ''Mata'' used in [[Nepal]]
* ''Mom'' and ''mommy'' are used in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[South Africa]], [[India]] and parts of the [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]] including [[Birmingham]] in the [[United Kingdom]].

===Etymology===
[[File:Մայր Հայաստան հուշարձան.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of [[Mother Armenia]], aerial view in [[Yerevan]]]]
The modern English word is from Middle English moder, from Old English mōdor, from Proto-Germanic *mōdēr (cf. East Frisian muur, Dutch moeder, German Mutter), from Proto-Indo-European *méh₂tēr (cf. Irish máthair, Tocharian A mācar, B mācer, Lithuanian mótė). Other cognates include Latin māter, Greek μήτηρ, Common Slavic *mati (thence Russian мать (mat’)), Persian مادر (madar), and Sanskrit मातृ (mātṛ).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4591">'''Mucosal immunology''' is the study of [[immune system]] responses that occur at [[Mucous membrane|mucosal membranes]] of the [[Gastrointestinal tract|intestines]], the [[Genitourinary system|urogenital tract]] and the [[respiratory system]], i.e., surfaces that are in contact with the external environment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/subjects/mucosal-immunology|title=Mucosal immunology - Latest research and news {{!}} Nature|website=www.nature.com|access-date=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Health|healthy states]], the mucosal immune system provides protection against [[pathogen]]s but maintains a tolerance towards non-harmful [[Commensalism|commensal]] microbes and benign environmental substances.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, in the oral and gut mucosa, the secretion of IgA provides an immune response to potential antigens in food without a large and unnecessary systemic immune response.&lt;ref&gt;Helbert, M. (2017). Immunology for medical students (Third ed.). Philadelphia, PA: Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the mucosal membranes are the primary contact point between a host and its environment, a large amount of [[Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue|secondary lymphoid tissue]] is found here. The [[mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue]], or MALT, provides the organism with an important first line of defense. Along with the [[spleen]] and [[lymph nodes]], the [[tonsils]] and MALT are also considered to be secondary lymphoid tissue.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid., 84.&lt;/ref&gt; The mucosal immune system provides three main functions: serving as the body's first line defense from antigens and infection, preventing systemic immune responses to commensal bacteria and food antigens (primarily food proteins in the [[Gut-associated lymphoid tissue]], so-called [[oral tolerance]]), and regulating appropriate immune responses to pathogens encountered on a daily basis.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid., 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

At birth, the [[infant|neonate]]'s mucosal immune system is relatively undeveloped, but the colonization of [[intestinal flora]] promotes its development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Torow|first=N.|last2=Marsland|first2=B.

{{For|the work by H. G. Wells|The Outline of History}}

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to history:

'''[[History]]''' – discovery, collection, organization, and presentation of information about past events. History can also mean the period of time after writing was invented (the beginning of  [[recorded history]]).


== Nature of history ==
History can be described as all of the following:
* [[Academic discipline]] – body of knowledge given to – or received by – a disciple (student); a branch or sphere of knowledge, or field of study, that an individual has chosen to specialise in.
** one of the [[humanities]] – academic discipline that study the human condition, using methods that are primarily analytical, critical, or speculative, as distinguished from the mainly empirical approaches of the natural sciences.
* [[Fields of science|Field of science]]  – widely recognized category of specialized expertise within science, and typically embodies its own terminology and nomenclature.  Such a field will usually be represented by one or more scientific journals, where peer reviewed research is published.  There are many sociology-related scientific journals.
** [[Social science]]  – field of academic scholarship that explores aspects of human society.

===Essence of history===
* [[Chronology]] &amp;ndash; science of arranging events in their order of occurrence in time, such as in [[historical timeline]]s.
* [[Past]] &amp;ndash; totality of events which occurred before a given point in time. The past is contrasted with and defined by the present and the future. The concept of the past is derived from the linear fashion in which human observers experience time, and is accessed through memory and recollection. The past is the domain of history.
* [[Time]] &amp;ndash; measure in which events can be ordered from the past through the present into the future, and also the measure of durations of events and the intervals between them. Time is often referred to as the fourth dimension, along with the three spatial dimensions. History describes what happened where, but also when (in time) those events took place.

== Historical disciplines ==
* [[Archaeology]] – study of past human cultures through the recovery, documentation and analysis of material remains and environmental data
* [[Archontology]] – study of historical offices and important positions in state, international, political, religious and other organizations and societies
* [[Art history]] – study of changes in and social context of art
* [[Chronology]] – locating events in time
* [[Cultural history]] – study of culture in the past
* [[Diplomatic history]] – study of the historical foreign policy and diplomacy of states 
* [[History of science]] – study of the emergence and development of scientific inquiry
* [[Economic history]] – the study of economics in the past
* [[Environmental history]] – study of natural history and the human relationship with the natural world
* [[Futurology]] – study of the future: researches the medium to long-term future of societies and of the physical world
* [[Historiography]] &amp;ndash; both the study of the methodology of historians and development of history as a discipline, and also to a body of historical work on a particular subject. The historiography of a specific topic covers how historians have studied that topic using particular sources, techniques, and theoretical approaches.
* [[Intellectual history]]
* [[History painter|History painting]] – painting of works of art having historical motifs or depicting great events
* [[Military history]] – study of warfare and wars in history
* [[Naval history]] – branch of military history devoted to warfare at sea or in bodies of water
* [[Paleography]] – study of ancient texts
* [[Philosophy of history]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Political history]] – study of past political events, ideas, movements, and leaders
* [[Public history]] – presentation of history to public audiences and other areas typically outside academia
* [[Psychohistory]] – study of the psychological motivations of historical events
* [[Social history]] – study of societies and social trends in the past
* [[Universal history]] – study of trends and dynamics in world history
* [[Urban history]] – historical nature of cities and towns, and the process of urbanization
* [[Women's history]] – study of the roles of women throughout history 
* [[World history]] – study of global or transnational historical patterns

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6474">'''Policy by press release''' refers to the act of attempting to influence [[public policy]] by [[press release]]s intended to alarm the public into demanding action from their [[elected official]]s. In modern times, the term is used to dismiss an opponent's claims by suggesting the arguments to be lacking in substance and created solely to generate media attention.

== Cold War ==

Perhaps the most common use of the term refers to an infamous period during the [[Eisenhower administration]] when "leaked" documents were a common way for the various branches of the [[US military]] to attempt to garner funding for their pet projects when traditional chains of command failed, or they actively ended them. Practically any idea, no matter how outlandish, could gain some traction by simply claiming that the [[Soviet Union]] was working on a similar device.

The first and most costly example of this behavior was the mythical "[[bomber gap]]." After seeing the latest Soviet designs in 1955, a clamor broke out in Washington about the Soviets developing a lead in deploying strategic bombers, with estimates that hundreds would be available shortly. The result was a massive expansion of the US building program, which led to the eventual introduction of about 2,500 jet bombers. Although it was not revealed at the time, US intelligence services had actually made real estimates of the size of the Soviet fleet as early as 1956 by placing it at around 20 aircraft.&lt;ref name="heppenheimer1998"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Space Shuttle Decision | publisher=NASA | author=Heppenheimer, T. A. | year=1998 | page=193 | url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4221/contents.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the tactic of claiming the gap existed and then brushing aside any criticism as being "weak on defense," was so successful it led to a wave of similar claims.

Another famous case was a claim that suggested the Soviets were working on a global-range [[nuclear aircraft]]. An article, complete with images claimed to be leaked by a spy agency, appeared in the December 1958 issue of ''[[Aviation Week]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aviationweek.com/site-files/aviationweek.com/files/uploads/2014/10/1958-%20Soviet%20Nuclear%20Bomber.pdf "Soviets Flight Testing Nuclear Bomber"], ''Aviation Week'', 1 December 1958, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; The article described a system that was suspiciously similar to some of the designs that were currently under consideration by large US aviation companies. Concerns were soon expressed that "the Russians were from three to five years ahead of the US in the field of atomic aircraft engines and that they would move even further ahead unless the US pressed forward with its own program."&lt;ref&gt;''Soviet Nuclear Plane Possibility Conceded'', Ford Eastman, Aviation Week, 19 January 1959, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the entire article was a hoax; third parties later revealed that the aircraft appearing in the pictures was the entirely-conventional [[Myasishchev M-50]] ''Bounder'', which never entered production. The rumored aircraft was a nuclear-powered version of the [[Tupolev Tu-95]] bomber, called [[Tupolev Tu-119]]. The controversy managed to secure, for a time, continued funding of US efforts, which culminated in the [[Convair B-36#Experiments|NB-36]] testbed aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Guy Norris, [http://aviationweek.com/blog/false-starts-aviation-s-atomic-age "False Starts For Aviation’s ‘Atomic Age’"], ''Aviation Week'', 14 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Another apparent case of policy by press release was the famous ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'' article on [[flying saucer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''Is this the real Flying Saucer?'', Look, Volume 19, 14 June 1955&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the [[US Air Force]] and then the [[US Army]] were funding the development of the [[Avrocar (aircraft)|Avrocar]] at [[Avro Canada]] in [[Toronto]]. The article, in the 14 June 1955 edition, suggested that the recent wave of saucer reports were possibly caused by Soviet flying saucers, and the article went on to describe them and their capabilities. It included several images that appeared to be provided to them by Avro Canada, or someone in contact with them, including a description of the control system, which was identical to the one used on the Avrocar. In the end, the concept proved unfeasible, and the Avrocar project was eventually cancelled in 1961. The article nevertheless remains famous, as it is often presented as a US government misinformation campaign to deflect attention away from "real" UFO's: to exactly what end varies by the source.

==Contemporary use==
The term is now more commonly used, especially in the US, to refer to [[environmental policy]], but it is still used in discussions of [[defense policy]]. Myriad claims asserting [[global warming]] or [[ozone depletion]] have been described by editorialists, such as Mark Martin, the Chronicle Sacramento Bureau,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2006/02/17/MNG56HAEPT1.DTL Governor to push global warming fight - Bold policy gambits expected in bid to lower greenhouse gases], San Francisco Chronicle, 17 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and Hugh Ellsaesser, as "policy by press release."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalcenter.org/npa159.html Why the U.S. Should Withdraw from the Montreal Protocol], The National Center for Public Policy Research, February 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--BROKEN LINK:
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sepp.org/key%20issues/ozone/ozonscare.html The Latest Ozone Scare: Policy by Press Release], Washington Times, 17 March 1992&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

Likewise, the implication that Iraq was involved in the 9-11 attacks
or had [[weapons of mass destruction]], based on evidence that the CIA's own reports had dismissed, was described as "policy by press release" by [[John Kerry]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3916793/ January 11, 2004 - Meet the Press]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lou Dobbs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0701/26/ldt.01.html CNN.com Transcripts: Lou Dobbs Tonight]&lt;/ref&gt;

A related term, ''public health by press release'', is occasionally used ironically to imply official pronouncements or media campaigns belie inadequate effort or funding, but the term appeared in an article warning against a pitfall from the opposite direction (potential misassessment of limited clinical studies by press and policymakers).&lt;ref&gt;"The perils of public health by press release," Lancet, 2004 Sep 18;364:1037-1038&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10235">'''Post-conceptual''', '''Postconceptual''', '''Post-conceptualism''' or '''Postconceptualism''' is an [[art theory]] that builds upon the legacy of [[conceptual art]] in [[contemporary art]], where the [[concept]](s) or [[idea]](s) involved in the work takes some precedence over traditional [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] and material concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Osborne, ''Conceptual Art: Themes and movements'', Phaidon, London, 2002. p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; The term first came into art school parlance through the influence of [[John Baldessari]] at the [[California Institute of the Arts]] in the early 1970s. The writer eldritch Priest, specifically ties John Baldessari's piece ''Throwing four balls in the air to get a square (best of 36 tries)'' from 1973 (in which the artist attempted to do just that, photographing the results, and eventually selecting the best out of 36 tries, with 36 being the determining number as that is the standard number of shots on a roll of [[35mm film]]) as an early example of post-conceptual art.&lt;ref&gt;eldritch Priest, ''Boring Formless Nonsense: Experimental Music and The Aesthetics of Failure'', Bloomsbury Academic, 2013, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; It is now often connected to [[generative art]] and [[digital art]] production.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Osborne, ''Anywhere Or Not At All : Philosophy of Contemporary Art'', Verso Books, London, 2013. pp. 125-131&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-conceptualism as an art practice has also been connected to the work of [[Robert C. Morgan]], specifically his ''Turkish Bath'' installation at [[Artists Space]] in 1976, and in Morgan's writing in ''Between Modernism and Conceptual Art: A Critical Response '' from 1997. It has been connected to the work of [[Robert Smithson]],&lt;ref&gt;Peter Osborne, ''Anywhere Or Not At All : Philosophy of Contemporary Art'', Verso Books, London, 2013. pp. 99-116&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mel Bochner]], [[Robert Barry (artist)|Robert Barry]], [[Yves Klein]],&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Alberro &amp; Sabeth Buchmann, eds., ''Art After Conceptual Art'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 2006, pp. 89–93&lt;/ref&gt; [[Piero Manzoni]],&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Alexander Alberro &amp; Sabeth Buchmann, eds., ''Art After Conceptual Art'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 2006, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; [[Manfred Mohr]], [[Joseph Nechvatal]],&lt;ref&gt;https://vimeo.com/3908524 "Interview with Joseph Nechvatal, post-conceptual digital artist, composer and art theoretician"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lygia Clark]],&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Alberro &amp; Sabeth Buchmann, eds., ''Art After Conceptual Art'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 2006, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roy Ascott]], [[Allan McCollum]], [[Harold Cohen (artist)|Harold Cohen]], [[Mary Kelly (artist)|Mary Kelly]], [[Annette Lemieux]],&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; [[Matt Mullican]], and  the [[intermedia]] concept employed in the mid-sixties by [[Fluxus]] artist [[Dick Higgins]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Osborne, ''Anywhere Or Not At All : Philosophy of Contemporary Art'', Verso Books, London, 2013. p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

==As specific condition==
Conceptual Art focused attention on the idea behind the art object and questioned the traditional role of that object as the conveyor of [[meaning (semiotics)|meaning]]. Subsequently, those theories cast doubt upon the necessity of materiality itself as conceptual artists "de-materialized" the art object and began to produce time-based and [[ephemeral]] artworks. Although total [[dematerialization (art)|dematerialization of the art object]] never occurred, the [[art object]] became flexible – [[malleable]] – and that malleability, coupled with [[semiotics]] and [[computer process]]ing, has resulted in the '''post-conceptual art object'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plasticpropaganda.co.uk/catalogues/Plastic_Propaganda_Post_Conceptual_Art_Practice_Part_Two.pdf] Post-Conceptual Art Practice: New Directions&lt;/ref&gt;

==As general condition==
Conceptual Art at the end of the 20th Century spread to become a general tendency, a resonance within art practice that became nearly ubiquitous. Thus the widespread use of the term “post-conceptual” as a prefix to painting such as that of [[Gerhard Richter]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://oro.open.ac.uk/21890/] Gaiger, Jason (2004). Post conceptual painting: Gerhard Richter's Extended Leave-taking in themes in contemporary art. In: Perry, Gillian and Wood, Paul eds. Themes in Contemporary Art. London: Yale University Press, pp. 89–135&lt;/ref&gt; and photography such as that of [[Andreas Gursky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-flux.com/journal/one-and-three-ideas-conceptualism-before-during-and-after-conceptual-art/|title=One and Three Ideas: Conceptualism Before, During, and After Conceptual Art|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Benjamin H. D. Buchloh|Benjamin Buchloh]] in ''Art After Conceptual Art'' points out that post-conceptual art is already emerging in the late 1970s and early 1980s in the photo-based [[Appropriation (art)|appropriation art]] of [[Martha Rosler]], [[Louise Lawler]],  [[Cindy Sherman]], [[Peter Nagy (artist)|Peter Nagy]], [[Barbara Kruger]], [[Sherrie Levine]] and [[Dara Birnbaum]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Alberro &amp; Sabeth Buchmann, eds., ''Art After Conceptual Art'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 2006, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

British philosopher and theorist of conceptual art [[Peter Osborne (writer and academic)|Peter Osborne]] makes the point that "post-conceptual art is not the name for a particular type of art so much as the historical-[[ontological]] condition for the production of contemporary art in general...."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Osborne, ''Anywhere Or Not At All : Philosophy of Contemporary Art'', Verso Books, London, 2013. pp. 3 &amp; 51&lt;/ref&gt;

Osborne first noted that [http://www.fondazioneratti.org/mat/mostre/Contemporary%20art%20is%20post-conceptual%20art%20/Leggi%20il%20testo%20della%20conferenza%20di%20Peter%20Osborne%20in%20PDF.pdf contemporary art is 'post-conceptual] in a public lecture delivered at the Fondazione Antonio Ratti, Villa Sucota in [[Como]] on July 9, 2010. It is a claim made at the level of the [[ontology]] of the work of art (rather than say at the descriptive level of style or movement).

'''''Rethinking "Gnosticism": An Argument for Dismantling a Dubious Category''''', is a 1996 book by Michael Allen Williams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Michael allen|title=Rethinking "Gnosticism:" An Argument for Dismantling a Dubious Category|date=1996|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=0-691-01127-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is one of the first critical works that goes about comparing the established academic definitions of [[gnosticism]] to the texts discovered at [[Nag Hammadi library|Nag Hammadi]]. The main points of the book are that there is no established definition of "gnosticism" by people who use the term, let alone the academic world; and that the groups referred to as "gnostic" by the [[Christian]] Church [[apologist]]s referred to themselves often by their leader or leaders' names but no group referred to themselves as "gnostic" or "gnostics".

Also, Williams mentions the [[argument]] that none of the groups labeled "gnostic" shared a common set of beliefs that put them in a group together. The only things close to this would be the Christian [[heresiographical]] use of referring to these varied groups as "gnostics". As well as the varied set of interruptions of the creator of the material world ([[Yahweh]] or [[demiurge]]) by these early groups. Finally Williams clarifies that the ancient "gnosticism" of the Nag Hammadi groups and the misused "gnosticism" of moderns groups and academia have little if anything in common. Williams suggests a better and more adequate term for these [[heresy|heretical]] groups would be "biblical [[demiurge|demiurgical]] traditions".

==History==
The RCA was founded in [[Somerset House]] in 1837 as the '''Government School of Design'''{{r|aim25}} or '''Metropolitan School of Design'''.{{r|riba}}  [[Richard Burchett]] became head of the school in 1852.{{r|dnb}} In 1853 it was expanded and moved to [[Marlborough House]], and then, in 1853{{r|aim25}} or 1857,{{r|riba|dnb}} to [[South Kensington]], on the same site as the [[South Kensington Museum]]. It was renamed the '''Normal Training School of Art''' in 1857{{r|riba}} and the '''National Art Training School''' in 1863.{{r|dnb}} During the later 19th century it was primarily a [[teacher training college]]; pupils during this period included [[George Clausen]], [[Christopher Dresser]], [[Luke Fildes]], [[Kate Greenaway]] and [[Gertrude Jekyll]].{{r|dnb}}

In 1896{{r|aim25}} or 1897{{r|riba}} the school received the name '''Royal College of Art''', and the emphasis of teaching there shifted to the practice of art and design.&lt;ref name=aim25/&gt; Teaching of [[graphic design]], [[industrial design]] and [[product design]] began in the mid-twentieth century. The school expanded further in the 1960s, and in 1967 it received a  [[Royal Charter]] which gave it the status of an independent university with the power to grant its own degrees.&lt;ref name=aim25/&gt;

==Campuses==
[[File:Darwin Building, Royal College of Art in London, spring 2013.JPG|thumb|right|The Darwin Building in [[Kensington Gore]]]]

The RCA has two campuses, in [[South Kensington]] and in [[Battersea]].{{r|rca}} The Darwin Building in [[Kensington Gore]] dates from the 1960s and is a Grade II [[listed building]]. It was designed by a team of RCA staff members, [[H. T. Cadbury-Brown]], [[Hugh Casson]] and Robert Goodden.&lt;ref name=dunnett/&gt;

In 1991 the [[sculpture]] department moved to a converted factory across the river [[Thames]] in Battersea. In the early 2000s the college conceived a substantial second campus being created on the site, with a minibus service linking it to Kensington. Thus, after a successful redevelopment of the premises by [[Wright &amp; Wright]] (budget £4.3m, floor area 2,500 sq m), the present Sculpture Building opened in January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Royal College of Art Sculpture Building officially reopens|url=http://www.rca.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/rca-sculpture-building-officially-reopens/|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bizley|first1=Graham|title=Wright &amp; Wright's RCA sculpture department refurb|url=http://www.bdonline.co.uk/wright-and-wright%E2%80%99s-rca-sculpture-department-refurb/3131922.article|publisher=BD online 23 January 2009|accessdate=6 October 2015}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A masterplan was commissioned by [[Haworth Tompkins]]  and phase 1 of their three phase design was completed with the opening of the Sackler Building on 19 November 2009, to house the painting department. Its name commemorates a major gift by [[Mortimer Sackler|The Dr Mortimer and Theresa Sackler Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The new RCA Painting Building is now open|url=http://www.rca.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/the-new-rca-painting-building-is-now-open/|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sackler Building by Haworth Tompkins|url=http://www.dezeen.com/2009/12/02/the-sackler-building-by-haworth-tompkins/|publisher=Dezeen 2 December 2009|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RCA Sackler Building|url=https://vimeo.com/7822996|publisher=AJ Building Study video|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dyson Building, named in honour of [[James Dyson]], whose educational charity donated £5m to the development, was opened on 24 September 2012. It is the home for [[printmaking]] and [[photography]], and contains an innovation wing where start-up designers can launch their businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dyson Building by Haworth Tompkins|url=http://www.dezeen.com/2012/09/28/the-dyson-building-by-haworth-tompkins/|publisher=Dezeen 28 September 2012|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hunter|first1=Will|title=Royal College of Art by Haworth Tompkins|url=http://www.architectural-review.com/buildings/london-schools-part-one-royal-college-of-art-by-haworth-tompkins/8643316.article|publisher=AR online 27 February 2013|accessdate=6 October 2015}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Woo Building was opened on 30 September 2015, completing the Battersea project. It is named in honour of [[Woo Po-shing|Sir Po-Shing and Lady Helen Woo]], who have funded scholarships at the RCA since the 1990s. It accommodates the Ceramics &amp; Glass and Jewellery &amp; Metal programmes. The building's [[Anodizing|anodised aluminium]] gates were designed by alumnus Max Lamb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jordan|first1=Sarah|title=RCA opens state of the art Woo Building for jewellery and silversmithing students|url=http://www.retail-jeweller.com/business/rca-opens-state-of-the-art-woo-building-for-jewellery-students/5079631.article|publisher=Retail Jeweller 2 October 2015|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Gates installed for the opening of the Woo Building Battersea|url=http://www.rca.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/new-gates-installed-opening-woo-building-battersea/|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Courses==
The RCA offers Graduate Diploma, [[Master of Arts|MA]], [[Master of Philosophy|MRes, MPhil]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] degrees in twenty-eight subject areas, divided into four schools: [[architecture]], arts &amp; humanities, [[communication]], and [[design]]. The [[history of design]] programme is in collaboration with the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]; there are two double MA/[[Master of Science|MSc]] programmes in [[design engineering]] with [[Imperial College London]], one of which also includes periods of study at [[Keio University]] in Tokyo and at the [[Pratt Institute]] in New York.{{r|rca2}}

==Rankings==
In the [[Research Assessment Exercise]] of December 2008, 40% of the research output of the school received the highest (4* or "world-leading") assessment, the third-highest rating in the art and design subject area; over all subject areas only about fifty institutions received a higher rating.{{r|rae}}

In April 2011 the RCA was ranked first on a list of UK graduate art schools compiled by ''[[Modern Painters (magazine)|Modern Painters]]'' magazine from a survey of professionals in the art world.{{r|city}}

In August 2015 it was ranked first on a list of master's courses in fashion by Business of Fashion, a fashion website.{{r|guard2|bof}}

In 2015 the RCA placed first in the art and design subject area in the [[QS World University Rankings]] published by [[Quacquarelli Symonds]]. In 2016 and 2017 it held onto the position, increasing its overall score from 96.0/100 to 98.4/100.{{r|guard|qs}}

A '''slide library''' is a library that houses a collection of photographic [[reversal film|slides]], either as a part of a larger [[library]] or standing alone within a larger organization, such as an academic department of a college or university, a museum, or a corporation.  Typically, a "slide library" contains slides depicting [[Visual arts|artwork]], [[architecture]], or cultural objects, and is typically used for the study, teaching, and documentation of [[art history]], architectural history, and visual culture. Other academic disciplines, such as [[biology]] and other sciences, also maintain image collections akin to slide libraries. Corporations may also have image libraries to maintain and document their publications and history. Increasingly, these types of libraries are known as "Visual Resources Collections," as they may be responsible for all "visual" materials for the study of a subject and include still and moving images in a variety of physical and virtual formats. They may contain:

* 35mm slides
* lantern slides
* mounted study photographs
* born digital images
* 35mm, 8mm film
Many educational institutions have changed the names of their slide libraries over the years, to a variety of titles like Visual Resources Center, Imaging &amp; AV Center, Digital Collections Center, etc. The titles and duties of slide librarians have therefore expanded greatly. As keepers of these important historical images, visual resources librarians have continuously [[Library catalog|cataloged]] and [[Archive|inventoried]] slide collections, circulated them to faculty for teaching, and more recently, [[Digitizing|digitized]] slides and placed them online via [[content management systems]]. 

== History of visual resources collections ==

The first American [[lantern slide]] collections, developed by [[museum]]s to reflect and augment their collections, got their start between 1860 and 1879: the American Natural History Museum, the New York State Military Museum, the Smithsonian Institution, and the Winterthur Museum. American colleges and universities began their collections during the same period of time: [[DePauw University]], [[Columbia University]], [[Oberlin College]], [[Princeton University]], [[University of Rochester]]. Colleges and university collections were used primarily for classroom instruction.

The first illustrated architectural history course west of the [[Mississippi]] was John Galen Howard's Architecture 5A-F at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1905.  The six-semester course was required for all architecture students, and like other architectural history courses of its time, at [[MIT]] and [[Cornell]] at least, were multi-year in duration. Of course, the lecture was illustrated by lantern slides.  In the U.S., lantern slides generally measured 3"x 4.25".

The 1950s was a period of transition from black and white lantern slides, which heretofore had often been hand colored, to color positive film.  Lantern slides were shot directly onto color film, and the 35mm slide (2"x2" with an image of 24mm x 36mm) gained in popularity.

The heyday of the lantern slide lasted one hundred years, more or less, from 1860 to 1960.  The reign of the 35mm slide, more or less, was about half as long, fifty years, 1955–2005.

== Timeline: Development of visual resources (collections and profession) in the U.S.==

1865. First lantern slide collections begin developing in the U.S. These 3.25" x 4.0" glass slides projected clearly with great detail. However, projectors required [[lime light]] which was dirty and dangerous
 
1887. First transparent, flexible nitrocellulose film base developed
 
1888. First perforated film stock developed
 
1889. Eastman combined nitrocellulose film stock, perforated edges, and dry-gelatino-bromide emulsion to create the first paperless film stock
 
1902. Court denies Eastman's exclusive patent, allowing any company to develop 35mm film

1905. UC Berkeley’s Architecture Library acquires its first lantern slide, the tree of architecture, made from Banister Fletcher’s book, ''A History of Architecture on the Comparative Method''

1909. 35mm adopted as the international standard gauge by Motion Picture Patents Company, an Edison trust
 
1913. 35mm film format introduced into still photography
 
1925. Leica Camera introduced, using 35mm still film
 
1930.  Safety film introduced (cellulose diacetate)
 
1934-1936. Kodachrome 35mm slide film introduced, but not widely adopted by colleges and universities. Film stock was either flammable or brittle
 
1949. Kodak replaces all nitrate-based films with its safety film, a cellulose-triacetate base
 
1952. All camera film is now triacetate based, paving the way for widespread adoption of 35mm film in both amateur and academic markets

1952+ American faculty widely divided in their allegiances to lantern slides for their clarity or to 35mm slides for their ease of production and transport to class. Huge debates begin about whether 35mm color film is stable enough for adoption and whether the loss of clarity will ruin the teaching of art history. Younger faculty adopt 35mm film, while older faculty prefer lantern slides

1968. Visual resources curators begin meeting during annual College Art Association (CAA) conferences
 
1969. Art Libraries Society, established in the United Kingdom and Ireland, founded
 
1969. The first "universal" classification system published by [[Luraine Tansey]] and Wendell Simons under the title, ''A slide classification system for the organization and automatic indexing of interdisciplinary collections of slides and pictures''
 
1972. [[Art Libraries Society of North America]] (ARLIS/NA) founded by a group of art librarians attending the American Library Association annual conference in Chicago
 
1972. Nancy DeLaurier organizes the visual resources curators of Mid-America College Art Association 
 
1974. ''Slide libraries; a guide for academic institutions and museums'', by Betty Jo Irvine. Published by Libraries Unlimited for Art Libraries Society

[[Image:PlazaVázquez.jpg|thumb|right|200px|View of Vázquez de Molina Square, in [[Úbeda]], [[Andalusia]], one of the best examples of [[Renaissance architecture]] in Spain]]

'''Renaissance architecture''' was that style of [[architecture]] which evolved firstly in [[Florence]] and then [[Rome]] and other parts of [[Italy]] as the result of [[Humanism]] and a revived interest in [[Ancient Roman architecture|Classical architecture]]. It was part of the general movement known as the [[Renaissance]] which spread outwards from Italy and affected many aspects of scholarship and the arts.

In [[Spain]], the [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] began to be grafted to [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] forms in the last decades of the 15th century.

The style started to spread mainly by local architects: that is the cause of the creation of a specifically Spanish Renaissance, that brought the influence of South Italian architecture, sometimes from illuminated books and paintings, mixed with Gothic tradition and local idiosyncrasy. The new style is called [[Plateresque]], because of the extremely decorated facades, that brought to the mind the decorative motifs of the intricately detailed work of [[silversmith]]s, the “Plateros”. Classical orders and candelabra motifs (''a candelieri'') combined freely into symmetrical wholes. Examples include the facades of the [[University of Salamanca]] and of the [[Convent of San Marcos, León|Convent of San Marcos]] in [[León, Spain|León]].

As decades passed, the Gothic influence disappeared and the research of an orthodox classicism reached high levels. Although Plateresco is a commonly used term to define most of the architectural production of the late XV and first half of XVI, some architects acquired a more sober personal style, like [[Diego Siloe]], and [[Andrés de Vandelvira]] in Andalusia, and [[Alonso de Covarrubias]] and [[Rodrigo Gil de Hontañón]] in Castile.This phase of Spanish Renaissance is called [[Purism (architecture)|Purism]]. 
 
From the mid 16th century, under such architects as [[Pedro Machuca]], [[Juan Bautista de Toledo]] and [[Juan de Herrera]] there was a much closer adherence to the art of ancient Rome, sometimes anticipating [[Mannerism]]. An example of this is the [[palace of Charles V]] in [[Granada]] built by Pedro Machuca. A new style emerged with the work of Juan Bautista de Toledo, and Juan de Herrera in the [[Escorial]]: the [[Herrerian]] style, extremely sober and naked, reached high levels of perfection in the use of granite ashlar work, and influenced the Spanish architecture of both the peninsula and the colonies for over a century.

'''Special sciences''' are those sciences other than [[fundamental interactions|fundamental physics]], that are presumed to be [[reductionism|reducible]] to fundamental physics, at least in principle. In this view, [[chemistry]], [[biology]], and [[neuroscience]]—indeed, all sciences except fundamental physics—are special sciences.  The status of the special sciences, and their relation to physics, is unresolved in the [[philosophy of science]]. [[Jerry Fodor]], for instance, has argued for ''strong autonomy'', concluding that the special sciences are not even in principle reducible to physics.&lt;ref&gt;Fodor, J. (1974): "Special sciences and the disunity of science as a working hypothesis", ''Synthese'', 28, pp. 97-115.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Glossolalia''. [http://glossolalia-ailalossolg.blogspot.com/2010/05/episode-5.html], Resonance 104.4 FM, London. 17 May 2010. Radio.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stream of unconsciousness is characterized by disjointed leaps in ideation and story line, bizarre new word creation, loss of self-censorship, one sided conversations and punctuation that can make the prose both disturbing and difficult to follow.  Despite the name, the stream of unconsciousness occurs more in the form of waves than an actual continuous running stream of dialogue. The stream of unconsciousness is one of several forms of [[dramatic monologue]], where the speaker is addressing an audience or a third person. Such monologues are commonly used in [[poetry]] and [[drama]], but with the stream of unconsciousness, the audience or third persons are 'unknowingly' imaginary.  It is primarily a fictional device and often takes the form of a [[tragedy]].&lt;ref&gt;"Razen: The Science of Sleep". [http://www.foxydigitalis.com/foxyd/?p=15396], USA. 04 Aug. 2011 Web.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term was introduced to the field of literary studies from that of the independent music industry, where it was redefined by author and artist [[Bryan Lewis Saunders]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;"Stream of Unconconscious on Stand-Up Tragedy" [http://antonmobin.blogspot.com/2011/06/stream-of-unconscious-on-stand-up.html], France. 13 June 2011 Web.&lt;/ref&gt; For nearly a century the term has been both a misnomer and a [[malapropism]] for the [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]].

==History==
The audio recordings of [[Dion McGregor]] (1922–1994) can be perceived as one of the precursors of the 'stream of unconsciousness' (narrative mode), although his monlogues and somniloquy were never transcribed and presented as such.  "Dreams" (1995) by contemporary American artist [[Jim Shaw (artist)|Jim Shaw]] is a collection of  illustrations and extremely detailed dream descriptions.&lt;ref&gt;"Dreams".[https://www.blumandpoe.com/content/jim-shaw-dreams], Los Angeles. 2008 Web.&lt;/ref&gt; "Experiment with Dreams" by [[Leif Elggren]] and Thomas Liljenberg (Stockholm Feb. 1996) may also be attributed to the formation of this method.&lt;ref&gt;"Experiment with Dreams". [http://web.comhem.se/elggren/experiment.html], Stockholm. Feb. 1996 Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable works==

Examples of notable works employing the stream of unconsciousness narrative mode are:
*"Le Bobcat" Bryan Lewis Saunders and Raymond Dijkstra. Short Story on Cassette ([[Fragment Factory]] 2010)
*"The Reasons Why I Dream With Knives" Bryan Lewis Saunders. Nonfiction Book (Stand-Up Tragedy 2010)
*"The Confessor" is a book on tape composed of 24 album chapters on 12 audio cassettes.  With each album serving as a chapter, over 24 musicians and experimental sound artists created music for the unconscious epic poem by Bryan Lewis Saunders. "The Confessor" was created from app. 30 nights of somniloquy and dream descriptions. Poem and Book on Tape (Stand-Up Tragedy 2011)
*"Protective Geometry" [[Ed Pinsent]] and Bryan Lewis Saunders. Comic Book. (2012)

'''The Compass Institute Inc.''' is a charity organisation for young Queenslanders with a disability. It is Australia's first accredited Disability Service based on the principles of [[Budō|Japanese Budo]].&lt;ref name=Engel&gt;{{cite news|last=Engel|first=Nicky|title=The Compass Institute- Charting a Course for Change|newspaper=Business Matters Magazine|date=November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Compass is a registered member of the National Disability Services, providing post-school services for young people with an intellectual disability.&lt;ref name="nds website"&gt;{{cite web|title=National Disability Services|url=https://www.nds.org.au/links/page/3|publisher=NDS website}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Compass has been operating as a not for profit organisation since the early 90's.&lt;ref name=Engel/&gt;   It began in 1991 as 'The Aikido Institute' providing alternative education and intervention programmes to school-aged children.&lt;ref name=Blitz&gt;{{cite news|title=Aikido School Makes a Difference for Disabled|newspaper=Blitz Australasian Martial Arts Magazine|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1992 and 2006 over 7000 children participated in the intervention programmes.&lt;ref name=Engel /&gt;&lt;ref name="Win a diamond"&gt;{{cite news|title=Support a Local Charity...Win a Diamond!|newspaper=Sunshine Valley Gazette|date=27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=brian&gt;{{cite news|last=Hall|first=Peter|title=Students Make a Stand for Brian|newspaper=Sunshine Coast Daily|date=21 June 2002|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In 2003 The Aikido Institute became The Compass Institute Inc., and began providing post-school education, training and vocational opportunities to young people with intellectual and/or physical disabilities.&lt;ref name=Engel /&gt;&lt;ref name=Fudge&gt;{{cite news|last=Fudge|first=Nicole|title=Sporting Chance for Compass to Hit Goals|newspaper=Caloundra Weekly|date=March 23, 2011|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Compass is a registered charity employing 30 specialist staff and supporting over 70 young people with intellectual and/or physical disabilities through 6 centres from Gladstone to Gympie.&lt;ref name=Bode&gt;{{cite news|last=Bode|first=Mark|title=Compass on Course|newspaper=Sunshine Coast Daily|date=16 June 2011 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of these centres is a working farm, which provides opportunities for around 20 young people to gain access to further training in animal husbandry, horticulture, nursery work, and property maintenance.&lt;ref name=Bode /&gt;

==Education==
The Compass Institute Inc. provides further education in a broad range of subjects. The goal of the Institute is to provide real life skills with a focus on personal development and independent living.  This includes literacy, numeracy, communication, fitness, social skills, food preparation, personal grooming, transport and community participation.&lt;ref name="School trans compas web"&gt;{{cite web|title=School Transitions|url=https://www.compassinc.org.au/education/school-transitions/|accessdate=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compass employs staff in roles such as teachers, trainers, coaches and mentors, similarly those that attend Compass are students or 'Trainees' and not referred to as 'clients'.

==Training and vocation==
The organisation works on making pathways for disabled young people to become increasingly independent.&lt;ref name=Campion&gt;{{cite news|last=Campion|first=Alice|title=Funding a Must for Disabled Teens|url=https://sunshinecoastdaily.com.au/news/funding-must-disabled-teens/7773701|accessdate=4 June 2013|newspaper=Sunshine Coast Daily|date=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Central to Compass training and vocation units is the provision of "real further education, skills-based training and vocational opportunities as part of a structured pathway to social and economic participation".&lt;ref name=Campion /&gt; Through the vocational pathways Compass provides, people with a disability have successfully been placed into appropriate and rewarding work.&lt;ref name=Campion /&gt;&lt;ref name=Fears&gt;{{cite news|title=Ignoring fears pays off in staff addition|newspaper=Sunshine coast Daily|date=September 23, 2011|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Compass Institute Inc. is involved in setting up [[social enterprise]]s as vocational pathways for its trainees. These are ‘real life’ businesses that are integrated into the local community, including lawn and garden maintenance, Vehicle detailing, business support services, art and craft markets and the Compass Farm.&lt;ref name="community enterprises"&gt;{{cite web|title=Community Enterprises|url=https://www.compassinc.org.au/vocations/community-enterprises/|accessdate=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purchase of an 8 hectare property enabled the organisation to set up an innovative educational and vocational setting, known as the Compass Farm.&lt;ref name=Bode /&gt; At this facility trainees can undertake vocational training, work experience and therapy.&lt;ref name=Fencing&gt;{{cite news|title=Fencing for Compass|newspaper=Sunshine Valley News|date=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011, 20 people with disabilities, ranging in ages from 20 to 30 undertook training and work programs at the property.&lt;ref name=Bode /&gt; Activities range from animal husbandry, mixed horticulture, nursery work and property maintenance work.&lt;ref name=Bode /&gt;&lt;ref name=farm&gt;{{cite web|title=Compass Farm|url=https://www.compassinc.org.au/vocations/compass-farm/|accessdate=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Martial values==
Underpinning the structure and organisation of both the service provision and management of Compass are the philosophies of Japanese Budo.&lt;ref name=Engel /&gt; The early work of the Aikido Institute (now The Compass Institute Inc.) involved running intervention programs and life skills classes that used [[Aikido]] and [[Budō]] to help students with goal setting, anger management, time management, and self-defence.&lt;ref name=High&gt;{{cite news|title=Students Learn to Hold Heads High|newspaper=Sunshine Coast Daily|date=June 21, 2001|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;   These “unique experiential programs” employed the principles of traditional martial arts philosophy and practice to engage students.&lt;ref name="Win a diamond" /&gt;   From here Compass branched out into the disability service, but the role of Aikido and budo philosophy has never ceased to have an important role in the running of Compass.

Compass CEO [[David Dangerfield]] has been using martial arts to help build physical skills and self-confidence in people for over 30 years. He saw the potential to do the same with people with both physical or intellectual disabilities.&lt;ref name=Engel /&gt;   "These individuals are always reminded of what they can't do, Martial arts is something they can do. It's a great physical outlet..."&lt;ref name=Engel /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5999">In [[literature]], the '''tone''' of a literary work is the effect that the writer creates on the readers through choice of writing style. The overall objective is to express an attitude or certain feelings about the subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Scheir|title=Roadmap To The California High School Exit Exam: English Language Arts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N1vh2n29bVMC&amp;pg=PA56|year=2004|publisher=The Princeton Review|isbn=978-0-375-76471-4|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Brownstein|1992|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Depending upon the personality of the writer and the effect the writer wants to create, the work can be formal or informal, sober or whimsical, assertive or pleading, straightforward or sly.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In determining the attitude, mood, or tone of an author, examine the specific [[diction]] used.  Is the author using adjectives to describe the subject?  If so, are they words like ''fragrant, tranquil, magnanimous''—words with positive [[connotation]]s?  Or are they words like ''fetid, ruffled, stingy''—words with negative connotations?

When we speak, our tone of voice conveys our mood—frustrated, cheerful, critical, gloomy, or angry.  When we write, our images and descriptive phrases get our feelings across—guarded optimism, unqualified enthusiasm, objective indifference, resignation, or dissatisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Brownstein|1992|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other examples of literary tone are:  airy, comic, condescending, facetious, funny, heavy, intimate, ironic, light, playful, sad, serious, sinister, solemn, somber, threatening.

==Difference from mood==
Tone and [[mood (literature)|mood]] are not the same, although they are frequently confused. The mood of a piece of literature is the feeling or atmosphere created by the work, or, said slightly differently, how the work makes the reader feel. Mood is produced most effectively through the use of setting, theme, voice and tone, while tone is how the author feels about something.

==Usage==
All pieces of literature, even official documents and technical documents, have some sort of tone.  Authors create  tone   through the use of various other literary elements, such as ''diction'' or word choice; ''syntax'', the grammatical arrangement of words in a text for effect; ''imagery'', or vivid appeals to the senses; ''details'', facts that are included or omitted; and ''figurative language'', the comparison of  seemingly unrelated things for sub-textual  purposes.{{how|date=October 2013}}

While now used to discuss literature, the term tone was originally applied solely to music. This appropriated word has come to represent attitudes and feelings a speaker (in poetry), a narrator (in fiction), or an author (in non-literary prose) has towards the subject, situation, and/or the intended audience. It is important to recognize that the  speaker, or narrator is not to be confused with the author and that attitudes and feelings of the  speaker or narrator should not be confused with those of the author.{{why |date=October 2013}}  In general, the tone of a piece only refers to attitude of the author if writing is non-literary in nature.{{Elucidate |date=October 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;Booth, Alison, and Kelly J. Mays, eds.  "Theme and Tone." ''The Norton Introduction to Literature'', Portable 10th ed. New York: Norton, 2010. 475-6. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases, the tone of a work may change and shift as the speaker or narrator’s perspective on a particular subject alters throughout the piece.

Official and technical documentation tends to employ a formal tone throughout the piece.

==Setting tone==
Authors set a tone in literature by conveying emotions/feelings through words. The way a person feels about an idea/concept, event, or another person can be quickly determined through facial expressions, gestures and in the tone of voice used.  In literature an author sets the tone through words.  The possible tones are bounded only by the number of possible [[emotion]]s a human being can have.

Diction and [[syntax]] often dictate what the author's (or character's) attitude toward his subject is at the time. An example: "Charlie surveyed the classroom but it was really his mother congratulating himself for snatching the higher test grade, the smug smirk on his face growing brighter and brighter as he confirmed the inferiority of his peers."

The tone here is one of arrogance; the quip "inferiority of his peers" shows Charlie's belief in his own prowess. The words "surveyed" and "congratulating himself" show Charlie as seeing himself better than the rest of his class.  The diction, including the word "snatching", gives the reader a mental picture of someone quickly and effortlessly grabbing something, which proves once again Charlie's pride in himself. The "smug [[smirk]]" provides a facial imagery of Charlie's pride.

In addition, using imagery in a poem is helpful to develop a poem's tone.

Ten of the movies take place (at least in part) in courtrooms.

The American Bar Association also published a list of the 12 best trial plays, noting that the transition from film to the stage is sometimes difficult. It also has an extensive honorable mention list.&lt;ref name="Schachner"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/the_theaters_12_greatest_courtroom_dramas/ |title=The Theater's 12 Greatest Courtroom Dramas |date=August 1, 2012 |first1=Jill Schachner |last1=Chanen |work=ABA Journal |accessdate=July 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oddities===
The trial in ''M'' is ''not'' in a legal courtroom. Instead, the city's crime syndicate leaders and underground elements hold proceedings in a warehouse. Despite the lack of legal trappings, "it is one of the most effective trials ever filmed, questioning our notions of justice and revenge, mob rule and order, power and responsibility. Our social orientation is flip-flopped." Wearing long leather coats instead of robes, criminals become judges. The murderer is cast as the victim, while the forces of law and order must rely on luck. [[Peter Lorre]] strikingly raises the issue of his culpability due to alleged insanity, and the imposition of ultimate retributive justice is depicted as being unsatisfying for society and the survivors of the murdered victims.&lt;ref name="aba-list"/&gt;

Outside of the first few minutes of the film, ''[[12 Angry Men (1957 film)|Twelve Angry Men]]'' never enters a court room at all. It views the particular case and the system of justice through the prism of a jury's deliberations. The film explains practical explications of legal concepts basic to the American system of justice, and their effect on a particular trial and defendant. Those include the [[presumption of innocence]], [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] and the requirement of proof beyond a [[reasonable doubt]].&lt;ref name="aba-list"/&gt;

==American Film Institute==
In 2008, the [[American Film Institute]] compiled its own "courtroom drama" ten best list. It includes five of the films on the ABA list — ''[[12 Angry Men (1957 film)|12 Angry Men]]'', ''[[Anatomy of a Murder]]'', ''[[Judgment at Nuremberg]]'', ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird (film)|To Kill a Mockingbird]]'' and ''[[The Verdict]]'' — and adds ''[[A Cry in the Dark]]'', ''[[A Few Good Men (film)|A Few Good Men]]'', ''[[In Cold Blood (film)|In Cold Blood]]'', ''[[Kramer vs. Kramer]]'', and ''[[Witness for the Prosecution (1957 film)|Witness for the Prosecution]]''.&lt;ref name="afi.com"/&gt;

===Etymology and usage===
The term ''tribadism'' derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word τριβάς (''tribas''), meaning "a woman who practices unnatural vice with herself or with other women",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dtriba%2Fs τριβάς], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'' on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; which derives from the verb τρίβω (''tribō''), "rub".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dtri%2Fbw τρίβω], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'' on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient Greek and [[Sexuality in ancient Rome|Roman sexuality]], a tribas, or tribade (IPA:{{IPA|/ˈtrɪbəd/ /tribad/}}),&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'' 2nd. Ed.&lt;/ref&gt; was a woman or [[intersex]] individual who actively penetrated another person (male or female) through use of the [[clitoris]] or a [[dildo]]. The term ''tribade'' did not begin to refer exclusively to eroticism between women until [[Late Antiquity]].&lt;ref name="Zimmerman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Halberstam"/&gt; Because penetration was viewed as "male-defined" sexuality, a tribas was considered the most vulgar lesbian.&lt;ref name="Penner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Halberstam"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Norton"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Rictor Norton]] |title=A Critique of Social Constructionism and Postmodern Queer Theory, "The 'Sodomite' and the 'Lesbian' |publisher=infopt.demon.co.uk |date=July 12, 2002 |accessdate=July 30, 2011 |url=http://www.infopt.demon.co.uk/social22.htm |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215084530/http://www.infopt.demon.co.uk/social22.htm |archivedate=February 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Craven"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Sihvola, Juha |author2=Nussbaum, Martha Craven |title=The sleep of reason: erotic experience and sexual ethics in ancient Greece and Rome |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |year=2002 |isbn=0-226-60915-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greeks and Romans recognized same-sex attraction, but as any sexual act was believed to require that one of the partners be "[[Phallus|phallic]]" and that therefore sexual activity between women was impossible without this feature, mythology popularly associated lesbians with either having enlarged clitorises or as incapable of enjoying sexual activity without the substitution of a phallus.&lt;ref name="Blumenfeld"&gt;{{cite book|title =Looking at gay and lesbian life|publisher=Beacon Press|year=1993|page=93|isbn=0-8070-7923-5|accessdate=February 19, 2012|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WuJYskiyjEoC&amp;pg=PA93|author=Warren J.

In English texts, ''tribade'' is recorded as early as 1601, in [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''Praeludium'' (Poem X in ''The Forest''),&lt;ref name="Zimmerman"/&gt; to as late as the mid-nineteenth century; it was the most common lesbian term in European texts,&lt;ref name="Norton"/&gt; through the proliferation of classical literature, anatomies, midwiferies, sexual advice manuals, and [[pornography]].&lt;ref name="Zimmerman"/&gt; It also came to refer to lesbian sexual practices in general, though anatomical investigation in the mid-eighteenth century led to skepticism about stories of enlarged clitorises and anatomists and doctors argued for a more precise distinction between clitoral [[hypertrophy]] and [[Hermaphrodite|hermaphroditism]].&lt;ref name="Zimmerman"/&gt;

Author Bonnie Zimmerman stated, "More often, however, [European] writers avoided the term, instead euphemistically invoking 'unnatural vice,' 'lewd behavior,' 'crimes against nature,' 'using an instrument,' and 'taking the part of a man.'{{-"}}&lt;ref name="Zimmerman"/&gt; In the eighteenth century, where the term saw one of its most popular uses, it was employed in several pornographic [[Defamation|libels]] against [[Marie Antoinette]], who was "tried and roundly convicted in the press" as being a tribade.&lt;ref name="Zimmerman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goodman"/&gt; "[Her] rumored tribadism had historically specific political implications," stated author Dena Goodman. "Consider her final (fictive) testimony in ''The Confession of Marie-Antoinette'': 'People!' she protests, 'because I ceded to the sweet impressions of nature, and in imitating the charming weakness of all the women of the court of France, I surrendered to the sweet impulsion of love...you hold me, as it were, captive within your walls?'" Goodman elaborated that in one libel, Marie-Antoinette is described as generously providing details of her husband's "incapacity in the venereal act" and that her lust resulted in her taking an aristocratic beauty [[Yolande de Polastron]], the Duchess of Polignac (1749-1793), "into [her] service" and later specifying that what makes sex with a woman so appealing is "Adroit in the art of stimulating the clitoris"; Marie-Antoinette is described as having stated that La Polignac's attentions produced "one of those rare pleasures that cannot be used up because it can be repeated as many times as one likes".&lt;ref name="Goodman"/&gt;

By the time the [[Victorian era]] arrived, cited Zimmerman, "tribadism tended to be constructed as a lower class and non-Western phenomenon and often was associated with the supposed degeneration of prostitutes and criminals".&lt;ref name="Zimmerman"/&gt; By the twentieth century, "''tribade'' had been supplanted" by the terms ''[[sappho|sapphist]]'', ''lesbian'', ''invert'', and ''homosexual'', as ''tribade'' had become too archaic to use.&lt;ref name="Zimmerman"/&gt; ''Fricatrice'', a synonym for ''tribade'' that also refers to rubbing but has a Latin rather than a Greek root, appeared in English texts as early as 1605 (in Ben Jonson's ''[[Volpone]]'').&lt;ref name="Andreadis"&gt;{{cite book |last=Andreadis |first=Harriette |title=Sappho in Early Modern England: Female Same-Sex Literary Erotics, 1550–1714|publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2001 |pages=41, 49–51|isbn=0-226-02009-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its usage suggests that it was more colloquial and more [[pejorative]] than ''tribade''.&lt;ref name="Andreadis"/&gt; Variants include the Latinized ''confricatrice'' and English ''rubster''.&lt;ref name="Zimmerman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andreadis"/&gt;

She added that [[Sigmund Freud]] "had nothing to say" with regard to the topic, "and few contemporary lesbian sex books even discuss it".&lt;ref name="Halberstam"/&gt;

According to older studies, "approximately one-third of lesbian women used tribadism, or body contact, as a means of achieving orgasm (Saghir &amp; Robins, 1973; Jay &amp; Young, 1977)".&lt;ref name="Kimmel"/&gt; [[Masters and Johnson]]'s 1979 study on lesbian sexual practices found that vaginal penetration with dildos is rare, and that lesbians tend to do more overall genital stimulation than direct clitoral stimulation, which is also often the case for heterosexual relationships.&lt;ref name="Greenberg"/&gt; In 1987, a non-scientific study (Munson) "was conducted of more than 100 members of a lesbian social organization in Colorado" and "[w]hen asked what techniques they used in their last 10 lovemaking sessions, 100% were for kissing, sucking on nipples, and manual stimulation of the clitoris; more than 90% reported French kissing, oral sex, and fingers inserted into the vagina; and 80% reported tribadism".&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt;

In 2003, Julia V Bailey and her research team published data based on a sample from the [[United Kingdom]] of 803 lesbian and bisexual women attending two London lesbian sexual health clinics and 415 women who have sex with women from a community sample; the study reported that 85% of the women engaged in tribadism (whether genital-to-genital contact or rubbing genitals against another part of a partner's body), and, like older studies, that vaginal penetration with dildos, or with other sex toys, among women who have sex with women is rare.&lt;ref name="Zenilman &amp; Shahmanesh"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bailey"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sexual behaviour of lesbians and bisexual women|author1=J V Bailey |author2=C Farquhar |author3=C Owen |author4=D Whittaker |journal=[[Sexually Transmitted Infections (journal)|Sexually Transmitted Infections]]|volume=79|issue=2|date=April 2003|pmid=12690139|doi=10.1136/sti.79.2.147|pages=147–150|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1744617/pdf/v079p00147.pdf|pmc=1744617}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Safe sex====
As with any exchange of [[body fluid]]s during sexual activities, genital-to-genital tribadism has the potential to transfer [[sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infections]] (STIs/STDs) if those are present in one or more of the partners. [[AIDS.gov]] and the [[Los Angeles County Department of Public Health]] state that genital-genital and genital-body contact (including tribadism) can spread STIs such as [[Human papillomavirus|HPV]], [[Crab louse|pubic lice]] (crabs) and [[Herpes simplex|herpes]] and that "wearing clothes and for herpes, avoiding contact if sores are present, reduces the risks".&lt;ref name="aids.gov"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual Risk Factors|publisher=[[AIDS.gov]]|accessdate=June 8, 2012|url=http://aids.gov/hiv-aids-basics/prevention/reduce-your-risk/sexual-risk-factors/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Publichealth"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexually Transmitted Disease Program – Resources for Lesbian &amp; Bisexual Women

===Popular culture and other media===
Tribadism has been referenced in various aspects of popular culture. The [[glam rock|glam]] [[Pop music|pop]] band [[Scissor Sisters]] derived their name from the scissoring position.&lt;ref name="WashPost"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Scissor Sisters: On the Cutting Edge |first=Richard |last=Harrington |periodical=[[Washington Post]] |date=January 7, 2005 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A53256-2005Jan6.html |accessdate=2008-09-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hannaford, Alex (2005).

Genital-genital tribadism was depicted three times during the "[[D-Yikes!]]" episode of the cartoon ''[[South Park]]'', referred to in the episode as ''scissoring''. The episode is credited with having brought more recognition to the act of scissoring,&lt;ref name=thefrisky.com/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carpentier"/&gt; with ''[[The Raw Story]]'' stating, "Though the band 'Scissor Sisters' takes its name from descriptions of the act, it wasn't until scissoring was dramatized in the 2007 'South Park' episode 'D-Yikes' that it achieved wide recognition in mainstream culture."&lt;ref name="Carpentier"/&gt; The term additionally received mainstream recognition after the episode "[[Duets (Glee)|Duets]]" of the television series ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'' had characters [[Santana Lopez]] and [[Brittany Pierce|Brittany S.

In 2010, in response to [[California State University, Long Beach]] refusing to advertise the play "The Night of the Tribades" on the Seventh Street marquee because of the word ''tribades'' in its title, approximately 24 theater arts majors protested in front of Brotman Hall by simulating tribadism (including scissoring). "When you put tribade into a Google search image, apparently it comes up with the word tribadism, which is a sex act and they decided it was inappropriate," stated one student.&lt;ref name="Rivera"/&gt;

Tribadism and other lesbian sex scenes are featured in the 2013 film ''[[Blue Is the Warmest Colour]].'' The scenes were the subject of debate among lesbians and critics, with the depiction of scissoring being one of the acts that were criticized; in an interview surveying a small panel of lesbian women, one of the women, who was skeptical that lesbian sexual activity included scissoring at all, seemed more open to the idea of a [[Woman on top#Reverse cowgirl position|reverse cowgirl position]] of scissoring; another woman had engaged in the reverse cowgirl position of scissoring.&lt;ref name="Saraiya"&gt;{{cite web|first=Sonia|last=Saraiya|title=Lesbians have some thoughts about the sex scenes in Blue Is The Warmest Color |date=November 11, 2013|accessdate=December 1, 2013|publisher=''[[The A.V.

==Among female bonobos==
Female-female genital sex is not exclusive to humans. Females of the [[bonobo]] species, found in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], also engage in this act, usually referred to by [[Primatology|primatologists]] as ''GG rubbing'' (genital-to-genital).&lt;ref name="songweaver"&gt;{{cite journal|last=de Waal|first=Frans|authorlink=Frans de Waal|title=Bonobo sex and society|publisher=''[[Scientific American]]''|volume=272 |issue=3 |pages=82–8 |date=Mar 1995 |pmid=7871411 |url=http://songweaver.com/info/bonobos.html|format=reprint|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0395-82}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Paoli T, Palagi E, Tacconi G, Tarli SB |title=Perineal swelling, intermenstrual cycle, and female sexual behavior in bonobos (Pan paniscus) |journal=Am J Primatol |volume=68 |issue=4 |pages=333–47 |date=Apr 2006 |pmid=16534808 |doi=10.1002/ajp.20228 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Perhaps the bonobo's most typical sexual pattern, undocumented in any other primate, is genito-genital rubbing (or GG rubbing) between adult females," stated primatologist [[Frans de Waal]].

In the [[philosophy of science]], '''underdetermination''' refers to situations where the evidence available is insufficient to identify which belief one should hold about that evidence.  For example, if all that was known was that exactly $10 was spent on apples and oranges, and that apples cost $1 and oranges $2, then one would know enough to eliminate some possibilities (e.g., 6 oranges could not have been purchased), but one would not have enough evidence to know which specific combination of apples and oranges was purchased.  In this example, one would say that belief in what combination was purchased is underdetermined by the available evidence.

==History ==
Ancient Greek [[Skepticism|skeptics]] argued for ''equipollence'', the view that reasons for and against claims are equally balanced. This captures at least one sense of saying that the claims themselves are underdetermined.

Underdetermination, again under different labels, arises in the modern period in the work of [[René Descartes]]. Among other skeptical arguments, Descartes presents two arguments involving underdetermination. His [[dream argument]] points out that experiences perceived while dreaming (for example, falling) do not necessarily contain sufficient information to deduce the true situation (being in bed). He concluded that since one cannot always distinguish dreams from reality, one cannot rule out the possibility that one is dreaming rather than having [[veridical dream|veridical]] experiences; thus the conclusion that one is having a veridical experience is underdetermined. His [[Evil demon|demon argument]] posits that all of one's experiences and thoughts might be manipulated by a very powerful and deceptive "evil demon". Once again, so long as the perceived reality appears internally consistent to the limits of one's limited ability to tell, the situation is indistinguishable from reality and one cannot logically determine that such a demon does not exist.

==Underdetermination and evidence==
To show that a conclusion is underdetermined, one must show that there is a rival conclusion that is equally well supported by the standards of evidence.  A trivial example of underdetermination is the addition of the statement "whenever we look for evidence" (or more generally, any statement which cannot be [[Falsifiability|falsified]]). For example, the conclusion "objects near earth fall toward it when dropped" might be opposed by "objects near earth fall toward it when dropped but only when one checks to see that they do." Since one may append this to any conclusion, all conclusions are at least trivially underdetermined.  If one considers such statements to be illegitimate, e.g. by applying [[Occam's Razor]], then such "tricks" are not considered demonstrations of underdetermination.

This concept also applies to [[Scientific theory|scientific theories]]: for example, it is similarly trivial to find situations that a theory does not address. For example, [[classical mechanics]] did not distinguish between non-accelerating [[Frame of reference|reference frames]]. As a result, any conclusion about such a reference frame was underdetermined; it was equally consistent with the theory to say that the solar system is at rest, as it is to say that it moves at any constant velocity in any particular direction. Newton himself stated that these possibilities were indistinguishable. More generally, evidence may not always be sufficient to distinguish between competing theories (or to determine a different theory that will unify both), as is the case with [[general relativity]] and [[quantum mechanics]].

Another example is provided by Goethe's [[Theory of Colours]] — "Newton believed that with the help of his prism experiments, he could prove that sunlight was composed of variously coloured rays of light. Goethe showed that this step from observation to theory is more problematic than Newton wanted to admit. By insisting that the step to theory is not forced upon us by the phenomena, Goethe revealed our own free, creative contribution to theory construction. And Goethe's insight is surprisingly significant, because he correctly claimed that all of the results of Newton's prism experiments fit a theoretical alternative equally well. If this is correct, then by suggesting an alternative to a well-established physical theory, Goethe developed the problem of underdetermination a century before Duhem and Quine's famous arguments." (Mueller, 2016)&lt;ref name="Mueller 2016"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mueller | first = Olaf L. | title = Prismatic Equivalence – A New Case of Underdetermination: Goethe vs. Newton on the Prism Experiments, 2016/2 (n° 24) | publisher = British Journal for the History of Philosophy |date=2016 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09608788.2015.1132671}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] says of this — 'And I for one do not know how anyone, regardless of what his views about colours are, can deny that the theory in itself is fully consequent, that its assumptions, once granted, explain the facts treated completely and indeed simply'. (Helmholtz 1853)&lt;ref&gt;Helmholtz, Hermann von. 1853. ''Goethes Vorahnungen kommender naturwissenschaftlicher Ideen''. Berlin: Pastel. 1971. Philosophische Vortrdge und Aufsdtze. Ed. H. Horz and S. Wollgast. Berlin: Akademie-Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments involving underdetermination==
Arguments involving underdetermination attempt to show that there is no reason to believe some conclusion because it is underdetermined by the evidence.  Then, if the evidence available at a particular time can be equally well explained by at least one other hypothesis, there is no reason to believe it rather than the equally supported rival (although many other hypotheses may still be eliminated).

Because arguments involving underdetermination involve both a claim about what the evidence is and that such evidence underdetermines a conclusion, it is often useful to separate these two claims within the underdetermination argument as follows:
#All the available evidence of a certain type underdetermines which of several rival conclusions is correct.
#Only evidence of that type is relevant to believing one of these conclusions.
#Therefore, there is no evidence for believing one among the rival conclusions.
The first premise makes the claim that a theory is underdetermined. The second says that rational decision (i.e. using available evidence) depends upon insufficient evidence.

===Epistemological problem of the indeterminacy of data to theory===
Any phenomenon can be explained by a multiplicity of hypotheses.  How, then, can data ever be sufficient to prove a theory?  This is the "[[epistemology|epistemological]] problem of the indeterminacy of data to theory".

The [[poverty of the stimulus]] argument and [[W.V.O. Quine]]'s 1960 [[Indeterminacy of translation|'Gavagai' example]] are perhaps the most commented variants of the epistemological problem of the indeterminacy of data to theory.

===General skeptical arguments===

Some skeptical arguments appeal to the fact that no possible evidence could be incompatible with 'skeptical hypotheses' like the maintenance of a complex illusion by [[Descartes]]' evil demon or (in a modern version) the machines who run the [[The Matrix|Matrix]]. A skeptic may argue that this undermines any claims to [[knowledge]], or even (by internalist definitions), [[Theory of justification|justification]].

Philosophers have found this argument very powerful. [[David Hume|Hume]] felt it was unanswerable, but observed that it was in practice impossible to accept its conclusions. Influenced by this, [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] held that while the nature of the '[[noumenal]]' world was indeed unknowable, we could aspire to knowledge of the '[[Phenomenon|phenomenal]]' world. A similar response has been advocated by modern [[anti-realist]]s.

Underdetermined ideas are not implied to be incorrect (taking into account present evidence); rather, we cannot know if they are correct.

===Philosophy of science===
In the [[philosophy of science]], underdetermination is often presented as a problem for [[scientific realism]], which holds that we have reason to believe in entities that are not directly observable (such as electrons) talked about by scientific theories.  One such argument proceeds as follows:  &lt;!-- Perhaps we should add somewhere that in some sense, underdeterminism must be true, since even if one theory is determined by the evidence, one can always and in an infinity of ways trivially modify it (even if only to specify something in the future), yielding an infinity of theories. --&gt;
#All the available observational evidence for such entities underdetermines the claims of a scientific theory about such entities.
#Only the observational evidence is relevant to believing a scientific theory.
#Therefore, there is no evidence for believing what scientific theories say about such entities.

Particular responses to this argument attack both the first and the second premise (1 and 2).  It is argued against the first premise that the underdetermination must be strong and/or inductive. It is argued against the second premise that there is evidence for a theory's truth besides observations; for example, it is argued that simplicity, [[Explanatory power|explanatory power]] or some other feature of a theory is evidence for it over its rivals.

A more general response from the scientific realist is to argue that underdetermination is no special problem for science, because, as indicated earlier in this article, all knowledge that is directly or indirectly supported by evidence suffers from it—for example, conjectures concerning unobserved observables.  It is therefore too powerful an argument to have any significance in the philosophy of science, since it does not cast doubt uniquely on conjectured unobservables.

The '''University of Mary Washington''' (UMW) is a public liberal arts and sciences university located in [[Fredericksburg, Virginia]]. Founded in 1908 as the Fredericksburg Teachers College, the institution was named Mary Washington College in 1938 after [[Mary Ball Washington]], mother of the first president of the United States, [[George Washington]]. The General Assembly of Virginia changed the college's name to the University of Mary Washington in 2004 to reflect the addition of graduate and professional programs to the central undergraduate curriculum, as well as the establishment of more than one campus.

Each year, students pursue more than 60 majors and programs of graduate and undergraduate study through the university's three colleges: Arts and Sciences, Business, and Education. One third of UMW's undergraduate students study abroad before graduation, taking advantage of 121 study abroad programs in 56 countries. UMW Athletics' 23 teams compete in the NCAA Division III Capital Athletic Conference. Known as the UMW Eagles, 308 of these student-athletes have been named to All-American teams.

UMW has been consistently ranked a top college in the U.S.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} and in the southern region of the U.S. by ''[[The Princeton Review]]'', ''[[Forbes]]'', and ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]''. In 2018, UMW was named a top producer of [[Peace Corps]] volunteers for the tenth year in a row, placing fourth among small schools.

==History==
The earliest incarnation of the college operated from about 1899 in the former [[Norfolk College for Young Ladies]], a [[finishing school]] in [[Downtown Norfolk, Virginia]]. On March 14, 1908, Virginia Governor [[Claude A. Swanson]] signed into law legislation for the establishment of the new State [[Normal school|Normal]] and Industrial School for Women. It was called Fredericksburg Teachers College. The institution was renamed Mary Washington College in 1938 after [[Mary Ball Washington]], mother of the first president of the United States of America, [[George Washington]], and longtime resident of Fredericksburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944 the college became associated with the [[University of Virginia]] as its [[Women's colleges in the United States|women's college]]. Until that time, the University of Virginia had not admitted women as undergraduates, except in its education and nursing programs, although its postgraduate programs were coeducational. Following UVA's transition to coeducational status in 1970, the [[Virginia General Assembly]] reorganized Mary Washington College in 1972 as a separate, coeducational institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The General Assembly of Virginia enacted legislation changing the college's name to University of Mary Washington on March 19, 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp524.exe?041+ful+CHAP0176|title=Bill Tracking - 2004 session &gt; Legislation|website=leg1.state.va.us}}&lt;/ref&gt; to reflect the addition of master's degree programs and the establishment of more than one campus.

The university's first [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]]-certified building, CGPS North Building, was built in 2007. The university houses stops along the route of the Fredericksburg Regional Transit System (FRED). The school signed an Energy Performance Contact with the [[energy service company]] NORESCO from 2005–2007, enabling the campus to install water saving devices which reduced campus water consumption by 50%. NORESCO also installed low energy light fixtures, occupant sensors, HVAC controls, and completed replacement of leaking condensate piping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate = January 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not a [[research university]], but instead focuses on undergraduate education.

Much of UMW's Fredericksburg campus is located on Marye's Heights, a steep hill which, like Sunken Road (the campus' northeastern boundary), played an important role in the 1862 [[Battle of Fredericksburg]]. The campus is within walking distance to the historic downtown with shops, restaurants and the Rappahannock River.&lt;ref name="umw.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://publications.umw.edu/undergraduatecatalog/files/2017/08/Undergrad-Catalog-2017-18_WEB-copy.pdf |title=Undergrad Catalog|website=publications.umw.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other campuses are Stafford Campus, seven miles north of Fredericksburg, and Dahlgren Campus, near the [[Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division]].

UMW has five pre-professional programs: pre-dental, pre-law, pre-med, pre-pharmacy, and pre-veterinary. Bachelor's degrees include a Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Arts, and Bachelor of Science in Business Administration in addition to two degree completion programs – a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) and a Bachelor of Liberal Studies (BLS).&lt;ref name="umw.edu"/&gt; Master's degrees include a Master of Business Administration (MBA, Master of Education (M.Ed.), Master of Education for Professional Development or Added Endorsement (M.Ed.), Master of Science in Elementary Education (M.S.) and a Master of Geospatial Analysis (MSGA). UMW also offers a Geographic Information Science certificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://publications.umw.edu/graduatecatalog/files/2017/08/Grad-Catalog-2017-18_WEB-copy.pdf |title= Graduate Catalog|website=publications.umw.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First-year seminar courses allow students to explore nontraditional topics in nontraditional ways. While topics vary, classes are all capped at 15 students, focus on the development of writing and speaking skills and use active, discussion-based formats. Previous first-year seminars have included "Beyond the Selfie: Exploring Digital Identities," "Cold Case: Theatre Mysteries," "The Art of Mathematics," "Race &amp; Revolution," and "Science and Technology – Because We Can, Should We?"

Many UMW students study abroad before graduation. The university offers 121 approved programs in 56 countries, five exchange programs, and more than 15 programs led by UMW faculty during spring breaks and summer sessions.

==Administration==
By statute of the [[Code of Virginia]], the University of Mary Washington is governed by a [[Board of Visitors]], one member of which is elected every two years to serve as [[Rector (academia)|Rector]]. The UMW Board of Visitors is composed of twelve members appointed by the [[Governor of Virginia]] and confirmed by the General Assembly. At least six members of the Board must be alumni of the university, and no more than three may be nonresidents of Virginia. Each member serves a term of four years and may be eligible for reappointment to one successive term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Student life==
'''Honor Convocation''' is held at the start of each academic year. '''Eagle Gathering''' is a candlelit celebration on Ball Circle that marks the start of the year and officially welcomes the newest class to UMW. During '''Family Weekend''', typically held in the fall semester, families visit the campus to get a taste of student life through events, performances and tours. Spirit Week is a series of student events that lead up to Homecoming and the return of UMW alumni to the university for athletic contests and tailgating. '''Senior Countdown''' is an event that celebrates 100 days until graduation for the undergraduate class. '''Spring Formal''' gives students an element of surprise – students learn the location of the formal (unique each year) only once they're on the buses heading over. '''Mr. UMW''' is a one-of-a-kind talent show in which contestants perform to be named "Mr. UMW" by the end of the night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orientation.umw.edu/traditions/|title=Traditions  -  Undergraduate Orientation|website=orientation.umw.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Barclay Squire''' (16 October 1855 – 13 January 1927) was a British musicologist, librarian and librettist.&lt;ref&gt;http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100526612&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
William Barclay Squire was a devoted music enthusiast. He spent 35 years of his life (1885-1920) working for the [[British Museum]], where he took charge of the collections of the music department and added many antiquarian publications to it. Squire prepared the publishing of the ''Catalogue of Printed Music before 1801'' (edited in 1912) and negotiated the deposit of the Royal Music Collection, for which he prepared the catalogue. He contributed numerous articles to the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|Encyclopædia Britannica of 1911]], to the [[Dictionary of National Biography]] and to the [[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|Dictionary of Music and Musicians]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Author:William Barclay Squire]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally, Squire acted as a librettist. His main work was the [[libretto]] for ''The Veiled Prophet'', a Romantic Opera in 3 acts composed by [[Charles Villiers Stanford]], adapted from the homonymous ballad in [[Thomas Moore|Thomas Moore's]] oriental romance ''[[Lalla-Rookh|Lalla Rookh]]'', published 1890.&lt;ref&gt;https://urresearch.rochester.edu/institutionalPublicationPublicView.action;jsessionid=386750CF2E77AD967B345A05639F1EC2?institutionalItemVersionId=23447&lt;/ref&gt;
