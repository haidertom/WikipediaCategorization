      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15828">The '''Affect infusion model''' ('''AIM''') is a theoretical model in the field of human psychology. Developed by social psychologist [[Joseph Paul Forgas]] in the early 1990s, it attempts to explain how [[mood (psychology)|mood]] affects one's ability to process information. A key assertion of the AIM is that the effects of mood tend to be exacerbated in complex situations that demand substantial cognitive processing. In other words, as situations become more complicated and unanticipated, mood becomes more influential in driving evaluations and responses.

==Affect infusion==
Forgas defined the term ''affect infusion'' as "the process whereby affectively loaded information exerts an influence on and becomes incorporated into the judgmental process, entering into the judge's deliberations and eventually coloring the judgmental outcome".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.117.1.39 | last1 = Forgas | first1 = J.P. | year = 1995 | title = Mood and judgment: The Affect Infusion Model (AIM) | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 117 | issue = 1| pages = 39–66 | pmid = 7870863 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, a process that determines the degree to which mood can affect our judgement. According to the AIM, affect (mood and emotion) exerts a notable influence not only on information processing but on the resulting response behaviors as well. For example, if a person receives an inordinately large electric bill, they will respond differently if they have had a relaxing and stress-free day than they will if they have just been stuck in traffic for two hours. Under this latter circumstance, the person will experience high levels of affect infusion, as their agitated state will undoubtedly be made worse upon seeing the electric bill.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

An assumption of the AIM is that this effect will generally occur more strongly as the complexity of a situation increases. Highly complex situations can exhibit a number of qualities, such as the amount of effort needed to process the information, whether the situation is familiar or entirely new and how severely the situation affects the person. Some common activities that tend to produce high affect infusion include: choosing whether or not to drink or take drugs, selecting or getting to know a new partner, explaining a conflict or allocating rewards to a group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.74.3.565 | last1 = Forgas | first1 = J.P. | year = 1998 | title = On feeling good and getting your way: Mood effects on negotiator cognition and bargaining strategies | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 74 | issue = 3| pages = 565–577 | pmid = 11407408 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Processing strategies==
According to Forgas, the varying levels of affect infusion can be seen as a [[continuum (theory)|continuum]], with four alternative processing strategies as markers along that continuum. These strategies represent the different degrees of severity in which mood exerts its influence. In identifying these strategies, two important differentiating factors are considered: 
* the information search strategies used to perform a task (open or restricted)
* the extent of the information considered in constructing a response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.76.6.928 | last1 = Forgas | first1 = J. P. | year = 1999 | title = On feeling good and being rude: Affective influences on language use and request formulations | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 76 | issue = 6| pages = 928–939 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several factors related to the judgment target, context, and judger influence which processing strategy is selected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.117.1.39 | last1 = Forgas | first1 = J.P. | year = 1995 | title = Mood and judgment: The Affect Infusion Model (AIM) | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 117 | issue = 1| pages = 39–66 | pmid = 7870863 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Familiarity - Familiar targets are more likely to elicit either direct access or motivated processing.
* Importance - Unimportant judgments are more likely to encourage direct access processing or motivated processing when a specific motive exists.
* Atypical - If a target is complex or unusual it is more likely to trigger substantive processing, otherwise heuristic processing may be used.
* Cognitive capacity - If the individual has cognitive capacity substantive processing may be more likely.
* Affective state - Positive affect is more closely linked to heuristic processing, while negative affect is more closely associated with substantive processing.
* Motivation for accuracy - An individual who is motivated to be accurate will be more likely to use substantive processing.

===Direct access processing===
The least intensive of the four, direct access processing, involves reproducing a stored reaction, that is, repeating a response that has been given before to a similar situation. According to the AIM, the influence of mood on cognition will be least severe during this type of processing.

===Motivated processing===
Motivated processing usually involves specific and targeted search strategies with a direct informational goal in mind. This strategy also involves little influence from mood, as the individual in question will have a fairly clear idea of what information he or she needs (although it is higher on the continuum than direct access processing).

===Heuristic processing===
[[Heuristic]] processing assumes that affective processing, or emotional processing, occurs outside our awareness, with people simply making sense of their emotional reactions as they happen. Thus, affective experience provides people with information about themselves, including their tendencies and implicit judgments. This process is also known as the "affect-as-information" mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.45.3.513 | last1 = Schwarz | first1 = N. | last2 = Clore | first2 = G. L. | year = 1983 | title = Mood, misattribution, and judgments of well-being: Informative and directive functions of affective states | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 45 | issue = 3| pages = 513–523 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Substantive processing===
Also called systematic processing, this strategy involves the most elaborate cognitive processing and appears highest on the continuum, as it is the most powerfully affected by mood. The reason substantive processing is most apt to be infused by affect is because mood can affect each stage in the cognition process: attention, encoding, retrieval, and association.

* Attention – To grapple with the amount of information that elicits substantive processing, people are likely to only focus on a subset of the entire information available. Mood-congruent information is more likely to be attended to than mood-incongruent information.
* Encoding – People spend more time encoding mood-congruent into a richer network of representations than mood incongruent information.
* Retrieval - Mood-congruent information is more likely to be retrieved from memory than other details.
* Association – Constructive social judgments require the interpretation of complex information. Affect can prime certain associations that influence subsequent interpretation.

Taken as a whole, Forgas has identified two overarching conditions under which mood is most likely to affect information processing: 
* situations that require cognition about difficult, peripheral subjects
* situations that require judgment of obscure, atypical subjects.

==Relationship to risk behavior==
Because mood itself is relatively complex, being the sum of many smaller emotional experiences with no single cause, pinpointing its real-world influence is no easy task. But scholars have used the AIM to examine a number of social phenomena with a variety of results. One area of research involving the AIM concerns the model's role in understanding an individual's propensity for risk taking. Since risky behavior can trigger a complex and varied set of emotional responses (elation, [[fear]], acceptance, etc.), a person's mood might be expected to play a substantial and unpredictable role in any choice to take heavy risks. If a person is in a good mood, he or she might be more likely to appraise the risk positively and be willing to accept any consequences in advance. But even if they are in a bad mood, they could be more likely to rebel against their cultural norms and take the risk anyway.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

This relationship has been examined in a particular experiment by attempting to manipulate a person's mood in order to produce infusion responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0882-7974.22.2.310 | last1 = Chou | first1 = K. L. | last2 = Lee | first2 = T. M. C. | last3 = Ho | first3 = A. H. Y. | year = 2007 | title = Does mood state change risk taking tendency in older adults | url = | journal = Psychology and Aging | volume = 22 | issue = 2| pages = 310–318 | pmid = 17563186 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[hypothesis]] is that the "risk taking tendency is greater for those individuals who are in a happy mood than for those who are in a sad mood".&lt;ref&gt;Chou, K. L., Lee, T. M. C., &amp; Ho, A. H. Y. (2007). p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt; Participants in this experiment were exposed to one of three priming movies (happy, sad, or neutral) and then measured on a risk-taking scale. The researchers divided the sample into two units of separation, one being age (old and young) and the other being mood valence (happy, neutral and sad). Not only did their data confirm their hypothesis for both younger and older participants, but it also confirmed the AIM as a legitimate instrument for studying the complexities of mood.

Another study examined how the AIM relates to a specific type of risk behavior: [[gambling]]. It investigated how mood affects an individual's sustained inclination to gamble, especially among non-regular gamblers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1046/j.1360-0443.2001.961116299.x | last1 = Hills | first1 = A. M. | last2 = Hill | first2 = S. | last3 = Mamone | first3 = N. | last4 = Dickerson | first4 = M. | year = 2001 | title = Induced mood and persistence at gaming | url = | journal = Addiction | volume = 96 | issue = 11| pages = 1629–1638 | pmid = 11784459 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers separated regular and non-regular gamblers and measured how their moods affected their experiences on the gaming floor. Specifically, they expected non-regular gamblers in a good mood to be more persistent than non-regular gamblers in a bad mood. This is because gambling, when it is a new and unfamiliar experience, complete with the bright lights and colors that are a feature of the average casino, requires a great deal of information processing, making it especially unattractive to someone in a bad mood. Their research confirmed this notion, but in addition, it was used to positively identify depression as a causal factor of addictive gambling, when the casino has become a familiar environment.

==Influence on interpersonal behavior==
In striving for a deeper understanding of the AIM, scholars have examined different types of behavior that can be expected when affect (mood and emotion) strongly influences information processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1207/s15327965pli0903_2 | last1 = Forgas | first1 = J. P. | last2 = Vargas | first2 = P. | year = 1998 | title = Affect and behavior inhibition: The mediating role of cognitive processing strategies | url = | journal = Psychological Inquiry | volume = 9 | issue = 3| pages = 205–210 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is by no means an exact science, as the behavioral consequences of affect are usually indirect and varied, but they have been able to show that "affective states have a subtle and cognitively mediated influence on the ways people perform or inhibit complex strategic behaviors" (p.&amp;nbsp;206). In other words, emotion influences thinking and behavior in subtle ways. A person in a strongly positive mood may be more confident and use more direct interpersonal behaviors than they would if they were in a bad mood. They may feel 'untouchable' due to the many good things that have happened to them and approach complex situations with an increased level of assurance. As the research has shown, this effect becomes greater as a situation becomes more complex.

In this sense, the AIM is a potential instrument for propaganda campaigns that promote a link between positive affect and desired behavior. For example, many failed attempts to dissuade adolescents from smoking have involved morbid and gloomy advertisements that only serve to depress their viewers. According to the AIM, messages that establish a comfortable atmosphere and focus not on the consequences of smoking but on the benefits of not smoking would probably be more successful.

==The AIM as a research tool==
Along with a clearer understanding of the effect of mood on a person's information processing, the AIM also provides a guide by which researchers can design experiments to investigate the effect of sending persuasive messages to subjects. One important area of research involves the concept of 'mood congruence', or how the results of mood compare to the mood itself. It has been found that 'mood congruence' occurs when a person exhibits a positive relationship between his or her mood and a dependent variable; essentially, as the strength of the mood increases or decreases, so the performance measured by this variable increases or decreases correspondingly. Conversely, 'mood incongruence' occurs when a person exhibits a negative relationship between mood and the dependent variable; thus, as mood increases, performance decreases and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.0021-9029.2007.00144.x | last1 = Davis | first1 = M. A. | last2 = Kirby | first2 = S. L. | last3 = Curtis | first3 = M. B. | year = 2007 | title = The influence of affect on goal choice and task performance | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Social Psychology | volume = 37 | issue = | pages = 14–42 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This distinction has been used to study the relationship between moods and personal goals. For those who are mood congruent, mood generally has a positive relationship with goal motivation, which presents a major opportunity to designers of public health information.&lt;ref&gt;George, J. M., &amp; Brief, A. P. (1996). Motivational agendas in the workplace: The effects of feelings on focus of attention and work motivation. In B. M. Staw &amp; L. L. Cummings (Eds.), ''Research in organizational behavior'' (Vol. 18, pp. 75-109). Greenwich, CT: JAI.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this line of thought, establishing a positive mood state within the emotional feel of a message and then psychologically connecting that state to the desired behavior would be critical to the message's efficacy.

The AIM has also provided useful insights to other fields. In consumer research, the AIM has helped to explain how males and females differ in their processing of advertising under happy and sad mood states.

The Center has evolved over time, with reforms in 1972 that broadened its research scope beyond [[Zionism]] and [[Demographics of Israel|Israeli society]] to incorporate the international and strategic issues, with a special focus on developmental issues and interactive trends between [[Arab world|Arab countries]] and the international system, the [[Middle East|regional]] framework surrounding them, and [[Arab League|amongst one another]].

The Center devotes a large part of its activities to studying the [[Demographics of Egypt|Egyptian society]] from its various [[Politics of Egypt|political]], economic, [[Egyptian Armed Forces|military]] and [[Culture of Egypt|social]] viewpoints. The center maintains complete independence in directing its research activities, and is keen on adhering to a philosophy of [[Critical thinking|criticism]]; and it aims to advance an intellectual, investigative vision for the issues at hand. It also provides for the [[freedom of speech]] of its scholars and researchers in accordance with the guidelines of [[Objectivity (science)|objectivity]] and scientific research.
The programs of the center are the result of collective efforts built on a framework of democratic scientific research planning.

[[File:Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung I 1798-1799.jpg|thumb|Title page of the first volume, showing a portrait of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J. S. Bach]].]]
The '''''Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung''''' (''General music newspaper'') was a German-language periodical published in the 19th century. Comini (2008) has called it "the foremost German-language musical periodical of its time".&lt;ref&gt;Comini, Alessandra (2008) ''The Changing Image of Beethoven: A Study in Mythmaking''. Sunstone Press. {{ISBN|0-86534-661-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-86534-661-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It reviewed musical events taking place in many countries, focusing on the German-speaking nations, but also covering France, Italy, Russia, Britain, and even occasionally America.&lt;ref name=Barbour /&gt;

Its impartiality and adherence to basic principles of credibility and discretion regarding the personal position of those reviewed, assured and established itself in a high position as a periodical in the musical German society of the time, exercising great influence on the period.

==History==
The periodical appeared in two series: a weekly [[magazine]] published between 1798 and 1848, and a revived version which lasted from 1866 to 1882.&lt;ref name="ripm.org"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ripm.org/journals/AMZ.php |title=''Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung'': prepared by Karl Kügle |access-date=2009-05-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521100516/http://www.ripm.org/journals/AMZ.php |archive-date=2008-05-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The publisher was [[Breitkopf &amp; Härtel]] in [[Leipzig]] for the first period of publication and for the first three years of the second period; for the remainder of the periodical's history it was published by J. Reiter-Biedermann.&lt;ref name="ripm.org" /&gt; For a time during the second era it went by the title ''Leipziger Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung'' ("AmZ of Leipzig").

Much important material appeared in the magazine, including the serialized first version of [[Georg August Griesinger]]'s biography of [[Joseph Haydn]], and articles by scholar [[Gustav Nottebohm]] and critic [[Eduard Hanslick]].&lt;ref name="ripm.org" /&gt; The journal employed the famous critic [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]] and published his influential review of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth Symphony]]. Both [[Robert Schumann]] and [[Franz Liszt]] published in the journal.

Somewhat less to its credit, the magazine also published the so-called "Rochlitz anecdotes," a series of vignettes about [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] written by the first editor. Today these anecdotes are widely considered to be heavily contaminated by material coming entirely from Rochlitz's own imagination (see [[Biographies of Mozart]] and [[Mozart's compositional method]]).

=== Editors ===
The editors of the ''Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung'' during its first 50-year period were:&lt;ref name=Barbour&gt;Barbour, J. Murray (1948) [https://www.jstor.org/pss/890433 "''Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung'': Prototype of Contemporary Musical Journalism."] ''Notes'', Second Series, 5:325–337. {{Subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Johann Friedrich Rochlitz]], for the first twenty years; he continued to contribute material for another seventeen.
* [[Gottfried Christoph Härtel]], the owner of the journal's publishing house, anonymously taking on editorship of the journal for ten years
* [[Gottfried Wilhelm Fink]], who edited for fourteen years
* [[Carl Ferdinand Becker (organist)|Carl Ferdinand Becker]], a Leipzig organist, in 1842
* [[Moritz Hauptmann]], cantor at [[St. Thomas Church, Leipzig]] in 1843
* a three-year hiatus without an editor
* [[Johann Christian Lobe]], for the last two and a half years.

=== ''Répertoire international de la presse musicale'' ===
The ''[[Répertoire international de la presse musicale]]'' has published volumes on both series:
*Ole Hass, ''Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung 1798–1848''. 14 vols. ''Répertoire International de la Presse Musicale'' (Baltimore, Maryland: RIPM, 2009).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ripm.org/pdf/Introductions/ALZintroEnglish.pdf Introduction]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Karl Kügle, ''Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung 1863–1882''. 7 vols. ''Répertoire International de la Presse Musicale'' (Ann Arbor, Michigan: UMI, 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ripm.org/pdf/Introductions/AMZintroEnglish.pdf Introduction]&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung'' is not to be confused with the ''Berliner allgemeine musikalische Zeitung'', a different musical journal which was published in Berlin, or with the ''Wiener allgemeine musikalische Zeitung'' which was published in Vienna.

The '''American Educational Research Association''', or '''AERA''' ("A-E-R-A"), is a professional organization representing education researchers in the [[United States]] and around the [[world]].&lt;ref name="About-AERA"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aera.net/About-AERA/Who-We-Are|title=Who are we|website=www.aera.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a nonprofit serving the education research field, AERA strives to advance knowledge about education and promote the use of research in practice.&lt;ref name="About-AERA"/&gt;

== Organization and membership ==
AERA is led by Executive Director Felice J. Levine and 2018 - 2019 President Amy Stuart Wells (Teachers College, Columbia University).&lt;ref name="About-AERA_Leadership"/&gt; AERA's governance structure includes the Council, Executive Board, standing committees, and award committees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aera.net/About-AERA/Organizational-Structure-and-Governance|title=Organizational Structure and Governance|website=www.aera.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temporary committees, task forces, and working groups are initiated for other specific needs.

AERA claims 25,000 members, including scientists, [[teacher]]s, students, [[Administration (business)|administrators]], [[State education agency|state]] and local agencies, [[School counselor|counselors]], and [[evaluator]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aera.net/About-AERA/Who-We-Are/AERA-By-The-Numbers |title=AERA By The Numbers |website=www.aera.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The broad range of disciplines represented by the membership includes education, psychology, statistics, sociology, history, economics, philosophy, anthropology, and political science . There are 12 divisions covering different research areas in education.

== Early history ==
AERA (known originally as National Association of Directors of Educational Research) was founded in 1916 as an interest group within the [[National Education Association]] Department of Superintendence. The association’s eight founders - Burdette R. Buckingham, Albert Shiels, Leonard P. Ayres, Frank W. Ballou, Stuart A. Courtis, Edwin Hebden, George Melcher, and Joseph P. O’Hern – were all directors of education research in various parts of the United States. They met at the 1915 NEA Department of Superintendence annual meeting and came to the idea of starting an organization to advance education research. Their constitution was approved the following year, committing the association to improving public education.

Early topics of interest for early AERA included research bureau operations, measurement techniques, and particular school situations. Active membership in the early association was reserved for research bureau directors and their assistants. The association’s early years revolved around the annual convention. Between meetings, the association published an internal quarterly newsletter, the Educational Research Bulletin.

By the end of the [[World War I]] in 1918, the association had 36 active members and four honorary members and was affecting public policy, visible in the school districts that started to change student coursework and education practices as a result of standardized tests. Mental testing developments, primarily [[psychometrics]] as a result of the First World War, new subfields of education, and the growth of education research at the post-secondary level challenged the association to widen its mission. The association opened its membership to include anyone who could demonstrate their competence as a researcher indicated by their published or unpublished work. In 1922, members voted to adopt a name that represented their goal of representing the interests of all American education researchers – Educational Research Association of America. Over the years that followed, membership saw a dramatic increase, particularly among university personal, which grew from 48% to 69% between 1923 and 1927.

The association’s original publication, the Journal of Educational Research, began in 1919.

The ability of education research to provide guidance for education practitioners was a struggle throughout the association’s beginnings, with only ambiguous known relationships between testing and learning outcomes. The association recognized the need to establish theoretical foundations for the field of education research. In 1928, the association changed its name to the American Educational Research Association, as it is currently known.

During the Great Depression, the association’s public school affiliates struggled with tight finances and uncertain employment, but during the same time, university education researchers dominated the field and emerged as a unique social entity. Also during this time, AERA officials grew their relationships with like-minded associations, and a new journal, the [[Review of Educational Research]], began as a reference work, summarizing recent studies. While early topics in [[Review of Educational Research]] focused primarily on education psychology and administration, the publication broadened its coverage in the mid-1930s in response to diversification in the field.

The role of education research in the Progressive Education Movement was a source of contention between education researchers, some of whom felt that it should play an active role in policy issues, and others who felt that it should be used primarily for professional discourse. As the field continued to advance, much of the knowledge did not translate into practice, an issue that is still widely debated today. These divisions in the field made it difficult for education researchers to speak with one voice. Just prior to World War II, [[Review of Educational Research]] made the case that because science could not speak to goals and choices, education research should contribute as one source of many to shaping American education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aera.net/Portals/38/docs/About_AERA/AERA%20Early%20History.pdf|title=Education, Science, and the Politics of Knowledge: The American Educational Research Association, 1915–1940|last=Mershon|first=Sherie|last2=Schlossman|first2=Steven|date=|website=www.aera.net|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publications ==
The Areas publishes books, reports and journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aera.net/Publications/Books|title=Books|website=www.aera.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; AERA publishes seven peer-reviewed journals:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aera.net/Publications/Journals|title=Journals|website=www.aera.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Events ==
AERA’s Annual Meeting held every spring is the largest gathering of scholars in the education research field with approximately 14,000 participants. The five-day conference is a showcase of research studies across education disciplines at all levels.

AERA also hosts the annual ''Brown'' Lecture in Education Research, which highlights the role of research in advancing equality in education. The first ''Brown'' Lecture was held in 2004 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the ''Brown v. Board of Education'' decision. 

== Education research and policy ==
AERA is expanding the availability of their resources by participating in the [[open access]] movement. AERA currently offers [[Educational Researcher (journal)]] [[open access]], as well as an Online Paper Repository containing presentations from the 2010 Annual Meeting forward. An [[open access]], peer-reviewed journal – AERA Open – is scheduled to launch in 2014.

On the policy front, AERA is actively involved in revisions to the [[common rule]]. Executive Director Felice J. Levine served on the [[National Research Council (United States)|National Research Council]] committee charged with reviewing proposed regulations. The committee published its report in early 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Proposed Revisions to the Common Rule for the Protection of Human Subjects in the Behavioral and Social Sciences {{!}} The National Academies Press|url = http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=18614|website = www.nap.edu|accessdate = 2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AERA helps lead an ongoing initiative as part of the social science research community to increase federal funding for education research, particularly research in the social and behavioral sciences.

In addition, AERA is active in the reauthorization of the [[Institute of Education Sciences]] bill – Strengthening Education through Research Act – which was advanced by the [[United States House Committee on Education and the Workforce]] in April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = House Committee Advances IES Reauthorization Bill|url = http://www.aera.net/Newsroom/AERAHighlightsE-newsletter/AERAHighlightsApril2014/HouseCommitteeAdvancesIESReauthorizationBill/tabid/15478/Default.aspx|website = www.aera.net|accessdate = 2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education research initiatives ==
AERA is involved in several education research initiatives, ranging from specific advocacy topics to supporting projects that serve the larger community. AERA supports the Education Research Conferences Program, which awards grants for conferences on ground-breaking topics. AERA’s Education Research Service Projects is designed to encourage researchers to offer their expertise to organizations and groups who may have a need but not the funds to engage their assistance.

One topic area that AERA has been immensely involved is affirmative action. In 2013, AERA presented an amicus brief on the importance of science in a major affirmative action case – ''Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin|url = http://www.aera.net/EducationResearch/LinkingResearchtoPublicInterest/AmicusBriefs/FishervUniversityofTexasatAustin/tabid/13333/Default.aspx|website = www.aera.net|accessdate = 2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Antimycins''' are a group of [[secondary metabolite]]s produced by ''[[Streptomyces]]'' bacteria.&lt;ref name="pmid4558141"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Neft N, Farley TM |title=Conditions influencing antimycin production by a Streptomyces species grown in chemically defined medium |journal=Antimicrob.

== Use==
Antimycin A is the active ingredient in Fintrol, a chemical [[piscicide]] (fish poison) used in [[fisheries]] management.&lt;ref name="pest"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pesticideinfo.org/Detail_Product.jsp?REG_NR=03909600002&amp;DIST_NR=039096|title=Fintrol concentrate|publisher=PAN Pesticides Database - Pesticide Products|accessdate=9 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antimycin A was first discovered in 1945 and registered for use as a fish toxicant in 1960.&lt;ref name="Caulkins"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Caulkins|first1=Peter|title=Reregistration Eligibility Decision for Antimycin A|url=https://archive.epa.gov/pesticides/reregistration/web/pdf/antimycin-a.pdf|website=United States EPA|accessdate=April 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fintrol ® is the only currently  registered product containing Antimycin A and is classified as a restricted use pesticide because of its aquatic toxicity and requirement for highly specialized training in order to use it.  In 1993, several toxicology studies were submitted to the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|United State Environmental Protection Agency]] yielding its toxicity.&lt;ref name="Caulkins"/&gt;

Fintrol is used primarily by federal and state governments in order to eliminate [[invasive species]] in an area where resident species are threatened.  Antimycin A is added drop-wise in order to reach a concentration of 25 parts per billion.&lt;ref name="Caulkins"/&gt; These drip stations are typically used upstream in an area that is accessible to boats and traffic.  In deeper bodies of water, a pump mechanism is used to disperse Antimycin A through a perforated hose stretching the length of the water column.

In [[aquaculture]], Antimycin A is used as an agent to enhance catfish production via selective killing small and more sensitive species.  When Antimycin A is added at 25 ppb it provides a complete kill.  However at 10 ppb, Antimycin A is used as a selective killing agent to kill smaller or more sensitive species that may reduce the yield of commercial farming.

Products Containing Antimycin A can be registered providing they follow risk mitigation procedures.&lt;ref name="Caulkins"/&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Risk of Concern !! Mitigation Measures
|-
| Exposure from consuming treated water  || 
* Flowing water must be treated with [[potassium permanganate]]
* Drinking water within the treatment areas must be closed during treatment and until all monitoring of samples is below the limit of Antimycin A detection, 0.015 parts per billion
|-
| Exposure from consuming treated fish || 
* The certified applicator  or designee under his/her direct supervision must prohibit consumption of dead fish taken from treatment areas. 
* The registrant must amend labels to specify maximum treatment concentrations of 10 ppb for use as a ‘selective kill’ in aquaculture. 
* When Antimycin A is applied as a selective kill in aquaculture, the Certified Applicator must inform the owner/operator of the aquaculture site being treated that surviving fish must not be harvested for food or feed for a minimum of 12 months after treatment.
* When Antimycin A is applied as a complete kill in aquaculture, the Certified Applicator must inform the owner/operator of the aquaculture site being treated that the water body must not be restocked for a minimum of 7 days after treatment
|-
| Exposure from recreational activities in the treated water  || 
* The certified applicator or his/her designee must prohibit access to treated area for 7 days following treatment.
|-
| Occupational Exposure || 
* The registrant must specify maximum treatment levels of 25 ppb
* Anitmycin A must be applied by a certified applicator who attends a certification program for piscicide applications. 
* The applicator is required to wear long sleeved shirt and long pants, chemical resistant gloves, closed toed shoes and socks, and protective eyeware.  Applicators using handheld equipment like a nozzle must wear a dust/mist [[respirator]] and coveralls.  The applicator should not be wearing contact lenses. 
|-
| Ecological Risk Quotients for non-target species || 
* Antimycin A is forbidden to be used in marine or estuarine environments
* The certified applicator or designee must ensure treatment does not pass beyond the designated treatment area

To date there has been no usage in human medicine, although its possibility as a [[Chemotherapy|chemotherapeutic]] was explored.&lt;ref name="Caulkins"/&gt;

== Mechanism of action ==
Antimycin A is an inhibitor of cellular respiration, specifically [[oxidative phosphorylation]]. Antimycin A binds to the Qi site of [[Coenzyme Q – cytochrome c reductase|cytochrome c reductase]], inhibiting the oxidation of [[Coenzyme Q10|ubiquinone]] in the Qi site of [[ubiquinol]] thereby disrupting the [[Q cycle|Q-cycle]] of enzyme turn over. [[Cytochrome c reductase]] is a central enzyme in the [[electron transport chain]] of [[oxidative phosphorylation]].&lt;ref name="KimEsser1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=Hoeon|last2=Esser|first2=Lothar|last3=Hossain|first3=M. Bilayet|last4=Xia|first4=Di|last5=Yu|first5=Chang-An|last6=Rizo|first6=Josep|last7=van der Helm|first7=Dick|last8=Deisenhofer|first8=Johann|title=Structure of Antimycin A1, a Specific Electron Transfer Inhibitor of Ubiquinol−CytochromecOxidoreductase|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=121|issue=20|year=1999|pages=4902–4903|issn=0002-7863|doi=10.1021/ja990190h}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The inhibition of this reaction disrupts the formation of the [[Electrochemical gradient|proton gradient]] across the [[Inner mitochondrial membrane|inner membrane]] of the mitochondria. The production of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] is subsequently inhibited, as protons are unable to flow through the [[ATP synthase]] complex in the absence of a proton gradient. This inhibition also results in the formation of the toxic free radical [[superoxide]].&lt;ref name="pmid15007303"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dairaku N, Kato K, Honda K | title = Oligomycin and antimycin A prevent nitric oxide–induced apoptosis by blocking cytochrome C leakage  |journal=J.

It has also been found to inhibit the cyclic electron flow within [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] systems along the proposed [[ferredoxin]] quinone reductase pathway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taira|first1=Yoshichika|title=Antimycin A-like molecules inhibit cyclic electron transport around photosystem I in ruptured chloroplasts|journal=FEBS Open Bio|date=1 January 2013|volume=3|issue=1|pages=406–410|doi=10.1016/j.fob.2013.09.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[cyanide]] acts to block the electron transport chain, Antimycin A and cyanide act in different mechanisms.   Cyanide binds a site in neighboring protein where iron normally binds, preventing oxygen from binding at all. This prevents cellular respiration completely leading to cell death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ott|first1=Kevin|title=Antimycin. A Brief Review of It’s Chemistry, Environmental Fate, and Toxicology.|url=http://www.newmexicotu.org/Antimycin%20Summary.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Antimycin A binds to a specific protein in the electron transport chain, its toxicity can be highly species dependent because of subtle species specific differences in ubiquinol.  This is why Fintrol can be used a selective killing agent in commercial farming.

Fungus-growing attine ants have been shown to use antimycins - produced by [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] ''Streptomyces'' bacteria - in their fungiculture, to inhibit non-cultivar (i.e. pathogenic) fungi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schoenian|journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA|year=2011|volume=108|issue=5|doi=10.1073/pnas.1008441108|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/108/5/1955.long|title=Chemical basis of the synergism and antagonism in microbial communities in the nests of leaf-cutting ants|first1=I.|pages=1955–1960|pmid=21245311|pmc=3033269|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; One research group studying these symbiotic Streptomyces bacteria recently identified the biosynthetic gene cluster for antimycins, which was unknown despite the compounds themselves being identified 60 years ago.

===Human Exposure and First Aid===
Exposure to Treated Water:
The effects of chronic, sub-lethal human exposure have estimated and extrapolated from murine(=pertaining to [[rodent]]s ) toxicology studies.  Estimates in the literature have been determined using EPA risk assessment protocols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Draft EIS, Flathead Westslope Cutthroat Trout Project|date=June 2004|page=Chapter 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies aimed at determining these levels found a concentration in mice where there is "No Observed Adverse Effect Level."  From there, the EPA describes methods to determine a [[reference dose]] (RfD), the upper limit of the substance that can be consumed daily for the rest of one's life without any observable consequences.  The RfD was determined to be 1.7micrograms/kg/day.&lt;ref&gt;J. O. Kuhn, “Final Report. Acute Oral Toxicity Study in Rats”, Stillmeadow, Inc., Submitted to Aquabiotics Corp. (March 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;  For a grown adult, weighing around 70&amp;nbsp;kg, they can safely consume 2 liters of treated water at 60ppb.

Toxic effects may result from accidental ingestion of the material.  Animal toxicology studies suggest that exposure to less than 40 grams of Antimycin A can result in serious adverse health effects to the individual.&lt;ref name="datasheet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://datasheets.scbt.com/sc-202467.pdf|title=Material Safety Data Sheet - Antimycin A|website=Santa Cruz Biotechnology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Treatment is focused on relieving symptoms and monitoring for respiratory distress, [[pulmonary edema]], seizures, and [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]].&lt;ref name="datasheet"/&gt;  [[Vomiting|Emesis]] after ingestion is not recommended for the potential of central nervous system depression.&lt;ref name="TOXNET"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/a?dbs+hsdb:@term+@DOCNO+6417|title=Antimycin A|website=TOXNET|publisher= National Institutes of Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Activated charcoal (medication)|Activated charcoal]] can be given as 240mL of water with 30g of charcoal.&lt;ref name="TOXNET"/&gt;  The patient should be monitored for development of systemic symptoms and signs.  After inhalation the patient should be moved to fresh air and monitored for [[bronchospasm]], difficulty breathing, and respiratory distress.  If needed, provide the patient with oxygen and secure an airway via [[tracheal intubation]].  Treat bronchospasm with inhaled [[beta2-adrenergic agonist]] and severe bronchospasm can be treated with systemic [[corticosteroid]]s.&lt;ref name="TOXNET"/&gt;

==Biosynthesis==

[[File:Antimycin A Synthesis.png|thumb|Part 1]]
[[File:Antimycin A Synthesis2.png|thumb|Part 2]]

Antimycins are produced as secondary metabolites by Streptomyces bacteria, a soil bacteria.  These specialized metabolites likely function to kill neighboring organisms in order to provide the streptomyces bacteria with a competitive edge.&lt;ref name="SeipkeHutchings2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seipke|first1=Ryan F|last2=Hutchings|first2=Matthew I|title=The regulation and biosynthesis of antimycins|journal=Beilstein Journal of Organic Chemistry|volume=9|year=2013|pages=2556–2563|issn=1860-5397|doi=10.3762/bjoc.9.290}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antimycins are produced by a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS)/polyketide synthase (PKS) assembly complex which acts as an assembly line for antimycin production.  The assembly is genetically coded for by the ant gene family. The assembly requires 14 proteins, AntBCDEFGHIJKLMNO, which shuttle the intermediates along the assembly line through a series of [[transesterification]]s, [[Carbonyl reduction|keto reductions]], [[thiol]]ations (addition of a sulfur containing group), [[Condensation reaction|condensations]], and [https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Structural_Biochemistry/Proteins/Adenylation adenylations].&lt;ref name="YanZhang2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yan|first1=Yan|last2=Zhang|first2=Lihan|last3=Ito|first3=Takuya|last4=Qu|first4=Xudong|last5=Asakawa|first5=Yoshinori|last6=Awakawa|first6=Takayoshi|last7=Abe|first7=Ikuro|last8=Liu|first8=Wen|title=Biosynthetic Pathway for High Structural Diversity of a Common Dilactone Core in Antimycin Production|journal=Organic Letters|volume=14|issue=16|year=2012|pages=4142–4145|issn=1523-7060|doi=10.1021/ol301785x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The last two steps involving AntB and AntO are tailoring steps.  The following steps describe chemically what the Ant Enzymes do in order to synthesize Antimycin.  Synthesis begins with tryptophan, an amino acid.

1. The [[Indole|indole ring]] of tryptophan, an amino acid,  is opened by a pathway-specific tryptophan-2.3-dioxygnease, AntN, to make N-formyl-L-kynurenine.&lt;ref name="SandyRui2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sandy|first1=Moriah|last2=Rui|first2=Zhe|last3=Gallagher|first3=Joe|last4=Zhang|first4=Wenjun|title=Enzymatic Synthesis of Dilactone Scaffold of Antimycins|journal=ACS Chemical Biology|volume=7|issue=12|year=2012|pages=1956–1961|issn=1554-8929|doi=10.1021/cb300416w}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2.  N-formyl-L-kynurenine is converted to [[Anthranilic acid|anthranilate]] by the pathway-specific [[kynureninase]], AntP.&lt;ref name="SandyRui2012"/&gt;

3. Anthranilate is activated by the [[acyl-CoA]] [[Lipase|ligase]] protein, AntF and loaded onto its cognate [[Membrane transport protein|carrier protein]], AntG, for further processing.&lt;ref name="SandyRui2012"/&gt;

4. Anthranilate is converted to 3-aminosalicylate by a multicomponent [[oxygenase]], AntHIJKL.&lt;ref name="SandyRui2012"/&gt;

5. 3-Aminosalicylate  is presented to the NRPS, AntC.  AntC has two modules which are organized Condensation1 (C1) -Adenylation1 (A1) -Thiolation1 (T1) -Condensation2 (C2) -Adenylation2 (A2) -Ketoreduction (KR) -Thiolation2 (T2). The A1 domain activates and loads threonine, an amino acid, onto T1, followed by a C1 promoted condensation of 3-aminosalicylate and threonine.  The A2 domain activates and loads [[Pyruvic acid|pyruvate]] onto T2. Pyruvate is reduced by the KR domain and condensed with threonine by C2 &lt;ref name="SeipkeHutchings2013"/&gt;

6. The [[Ketoacyl synthase|Ketosynthase]] domain of PKS catalyses the [[Decarboxylating reduction|decarboxylative condensation]] between the aminoacyl [[thioester]] attached to AntC T2 domain and the 2-carboxy-acyl moiety attached to AntD Acetyl Carrier Protein domain.&lt;ref name="SeipkeHutchings2013"/&gt;

7. AntM catalyses the reduction of the β-keto group, which precedes the AntD TE domain – promoted release of the nine-membered [[Lactone|dilactone]] &lt;ref name="SeipkeHutchings2013"/&gt;

8. A lipase homologue, AntO, and [[acyltransferase]] homologue, AntB, catalyze the installation of the N-formyl group and the transesterification of the C-8 hydroxyl group, respectively, resulting in the backbone for the Antimycin family.&lt;ref name="SeipkeHutchings2013"/&gt;

The '''Antoniadi scale''' is a system used by amateur [[astronomers]] to categorise the weather conditions when viewing the stars at night.

== Invention ==
[[File:Eugene Antoniadi.jpg|thumb|E. M. Antoniadi.]]  
The Antoniadi scale was invented by [[E. M. Antoniadi|Eugène Antoniadi]], a Greek astronomer, who lived from 1870 to 1944. Living most of his life in [[France]], he spent his time viewing [[Mars]] from [[Camille Flammarion Observatory|Camille Flammarion's observatory]]. He was very prestigious and was eventually given access to the [[Meudon Observatory]], the largest of the time.

== Current usage ==
Now the scale is seen as the metric system of astronomy, being used as a default measurement all over the world. Until recently in 2018, astronomers have been debating whether a new system with more categories is necessary.       

== Description ==
The scale is a five-point system, with 1 being the best [[Astronomical seeing|seeing]] conditions and 5 being the worst. The actual definitions are as follows:
# (I.) Perfect seeing, without a quiver.
# (II.) Slight quivering of the image with moments of calm lasting several seconds.
# (III.) Moderate seeing with larger air tremors that blur the image.
# (IV.) Poor seeing, constant troublesome undulations of the image.
# (V.) Very bad seeing, hardly stable enough to allow a rough sketch to be made.

Note that the scale is usually indicated by use of a [[Roman numeral]] or an ordinary number.

== Other ways of indicating seeing ==

Astronomers have devised several methods for defining the quality of seeing apart from the Antoniadi scale, including:

* Transparency
* [[Limiting magnitude]]
* a [[light meter]]

An '''attract-kill pattern''' is an interaction between plant [[root]]s and [[pathogen]], which plays an important role in suppression of ''[[Phytophthora]]'' disease in intercropping systems. The recent research from Key Laboratory of Agro-Biodiversity and Pest Management of Education Ministry of China indicated that [[maize]] roots attracted the [[zoospore]]s of ''[[Phytophthora capsici]]'' and inhibited their motility. Then a large amount of [[cystospore]]s closed to maize roots were lysed. The phenomenon has been widely found in various interactions between roots of non-host plant and ''Phytophthora''.

The '''Bachelor of Technology''' ([[Latin]] ''Baccalaureus Technologiae'', commonly abbreviated as '''B.Tech.'''; with Honours as '''B.Tech. (Hons.)'''; or '''BTech''') is an [[Undergraduate degree|undergraduate]] [[academic degree]] conferred after completion of a three-year, a four-year or even a five-year (such as in Nigeria) program of studies at an accredited university or accredited university-level institution. B.Tech. is considered as skill-oriented course. The degree is conferred in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], the United States and elsewhere.

==Australia==
In [[Australia]], stand-alone Bachelor of Technology (BTech) programs are uncommon. Most of the Australian BTech degrees have [[Engineering education|engineering]] and/or [[information technology]] as their focus.

==Canada==
In [[Canada]], the Bachelor of Technology designation is used inconsistently. Both universities and community colleges award the degree after completion of four-year programs but have different entrance requirements.

Care should be taken not to confuse the B.Tech. degree offered by university-level institutions with the [[Bachelor of Applied Technology]] (B.A.Tech.) or BAT offered by some community colleges in Canada. Community colleges are represented by the [[Association of Canadian Community Colleges]] (ACCC) and university-level institutions by the [[Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada|Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada (AUCC)]], the national accrediting body of universities in Canada. However, some community college engineering programs have recently been accredited by Engineers Canada following a thorough review by the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB), i.e., Conestoga College.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs1.conestogac.on.ca/news/2010/09/conestoga_first_college_in_ont.php "Non-Universities receive engineering accreditation from the CEAB:"]&lt;/ref&gt; CEAB accreditation allows licensing as a "Professional Engineer (P.Eng.)" and ensures that graduates of these programs can continue with graduate engineering studies at traditional universities.

Care should be taken not to confuse the B.Tech. degree with the [[P.Tech]] (Engineering) in Alberta designation used in Canada by the engineering technologists and technicians associations. P.Tech (Engineering) allow engineering practice independently same as professional engineer, which is attained by after completion of a 2-3 year Engineering Technology diploma program.

==India==
In [[India]], BTech (Bachelor of Technology) and BE ([[Bachelor of Engineering]]) both are same degrees and offered in engineering disciplines.

Bachelor of Technology or [[Bachelor of Engineering]] qualifications include the following:

* 3 years BE/BTech after [[Diploma in Engineering]]
* 4 years BE/BTech after class 12

Degree is regulated under the aegis of [[University Grants Commission of India]] (UGC), [[All India Council for Technical Education]] (AICTE) and National Board of Accreditation (NBA). Admission is usually through an engineering entrance examination.

==Kenya==
The B.Tech. degree was recently introduced in [[Kenya]] and is consequently not a very common course, with only one or two schools offering it. [[Technical University of Kenya]] (TU-K), located in the country's capital, offers a B.Tech. in Engineering and Information Technology. The duration of study is usually 4 years with 11 semesters in total, with two academic semesters per year and an industrial Based Learning (IDBL) semester for years two through four.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tukenya.ac.ke&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nigeria==
In [[Nigeria]], The B.Tech. degree is awarded by Universities of Technology or Science and Technology which can be Federal, State or Privately owned. The duration of study is usually five years of ten semesters. Nine of these semesters is spent in the university while one (usually the second semester of the fourth year) is spent on compulsory Industrial Training (IT) ranging from three to six months although it can extend for a whole session (usually the whole fourth year) for students of Agriculture related courses. At inception most of the universities offered core Science courses, but have now expanded their course offerings to include Social Sciences and even Medicine. There are five Federal universities of Technology in Nigeria located in [[Minna]], [[Akure]], [[Owerri]], [[Yola, Nigeria|Yola]] and [[Bauchi]] with some state and privately owned ones around the country.

==Pakistan==
In [[Pakistan]], Bachelor of Technology - B.Tech. (old name) or Bachelor of Science in Technology/Engineering Technology - BSc/BS Technology/Engineering Technology (new name) is a four years undergraduate engineering technology degree in which first 3 years (six semesters) are study years and in the final or 4th year (7th and 8th semesters), students undergo a supervised industrial training. Degree holders are called engineering technologists. The accrediting body of engineering technology degree is [[National Technology Council (Pakistan)]] (NTC) which is also responsible for registration of engineering technologists.

==South Africa==
In [[South Africa]], the B.Tech. is awarded by [[List of universities in South Africa#Universities of technology|Universities of Technology]] and [[List of universities in South Africa#Comprehensive universities|Comprehensive Universities]] - as distinct from [[List of universities in South Africa#Traditional universities|Traditional Universities]] -  and is generally practice or career oriented, as opposed to academically oriented. &lt;!-- The BTech (Eng) is the qualification which converts a diploma in an engineering faculty into the equivalent qualification carried by an engineer with a [[B.Eng]] or [[BSc(Eng)]]. --&gt; It is often offered in areas in which there is no corresponding  [[B.Sc.]] or [[BComm]] (e.g. B.Tech.: [[Forest management|Forestry Management]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.forestry.co.za/uploads/File/links/forestry_education/Saasveld%20info%20for%20FSA%20website.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; or B.Tech.: Explosives Management &lt;ref&gt;http://www.unisa.ac.za/contents/faculties/service_dept/docs/CEMS.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;).

The degree is obtained after 4 years of study and is usually offered as a 1-year program, following completion of a relevant three-year [[National Diploma (South Africa)|National Diploma]].

The B.Tech. carries the same points as other bachelor's degrees in terms of [[South African Qualifications Authority|South Africa's National Qualifications Framework]] (both having an NQF level of 7) At the same time, however, due to its orientation, it does not usually grant admission to the corresponding [[M.Sc.]] or [[MComm]] program,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uj.ac.za/EN/Faculties/management/coursesandprogrammes/PostgraduateCourses/Documents/UJ%20MCom%20Courses%20Brochure.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and students instead pursue the Master of Technology (M.Tech.) and Doctor of Technology (D.Tech.) degrees; it does grant admission to [[MBA]] programs (see [[List of business schools in South Africa]]). In some cases, however, admission may be granted, once demonstrated that the student meets the necessary academic level to complete the requirements of the M.Sc or MComm.

==Sri Lanka==
In [[Sri Lanka]], The [[Open University of Sri Lanka]] (since 1980 under [[University Grants Commission (Sri Lanka)|University Grants Commission]]) is the pioneer in offering the BTech Eng (Hons) which has a duration of minimum four years. Undergraduates can be specialised in Civil Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Electronics and communication Engineering, Computer Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Automobile Engineering, Manufacturing Engineering, Mechatronics Engineering and Textile and Apparel Technology.

The BTech is offered in Sri Lanka by the [[University of Vocational Technology]] in following fields of  Multimedia &amp; Web, Network, Software, Construction Technology and Resource management, Building Services Technology, [[Manufacturing]], [[Mechatronics]], Food Process, Film &amp; Television, Industrial Management and Quantity Surveying.

University of Sri Jayawardenapura of Sri Lanka is offering Bachelor of Technology degrees in Engineering Technology ,Bio systems Technology and Information Communication Technology, as BET , BBST ,BICT .those all are four year honours degrees which are based on Sydney accord.

BTech is offered by the recently established [[Uva Wellassa University]] (under University Grants Commission) which has a duration of four years. This is known to be a specialized degree where they are subjected to specialize in three fields, Food Engineering &amp; Bioprocess Technology, Material science &amp; technology and Mechatronics.

The Faculty of Technology of the University of Colombo offers degrees in Bachelor of Technology (B. Tech), of a standard equivalent to Sri Lanka Qualification Framework (SLQF) Level 6.

==United States==

{{Bayesian statistics}}{{Probability fundamentals}}
'''Bayesian programming''' is a formalism and a methodology for having a technique to specify [[Probability distribution|probabilistic models]] and solve problems when less than the necessary information is available. [[Bayes' theorem|Bayes’ Theorem]] is the central concept behind this programming approach, which states that the probability of something occurring in the future can be inferred by past conditions related to the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://deepai.org/machine-learning-glossary-and-terms/bayesian-programming|title=Bayesian versus Frequentist Probability|last=|first=|date=|website=deepai.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edwin Thompson Jaynes|Edwin T. Jaynes]] proposed that probability could be considered as an alternative and an extension of logic for rational reasoning with incomplete and uncertain information. In his founding book ''Probability Theory: The Logic of Science''&lt;ref name="Jaynes2003"&gt;{{cite book|first=E. T. |last=Jaynes|title=Probability Theory: The Logic of Science|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=UjsgAwAAQBAJ}}|date=10 April 2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-43516-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; he developed this theory and proposed what he called “the robot,” which was not
a physical device, but an inference engine to automate probabilistic reasoning—a kind of [[Prolog]] for probability instead of logic. Bayesian programming&lt;ref name="BessiereMazer2013"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Pierre |last1=Bessiere|first2=Emmanuel |last2=Mazer|first3=Juan |last3=Manuel Ahuactzin|first4=Kamel |last4=Mekhnacha|title=Bayesian Programming|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=4XtcAgAAQBAJ}}|date=20 December 2013|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4398-8032-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a formal and concrete implementation of this "robot".

Bayesian programming may also be seen as an algebraic formalism to specify [[graphical model]]s such as, for instance, [[Bayesian network]]s, [[dynamic Bayesian network]]s, [[Kalman filter]]s or [[hidden Markov model]]s. Indeed, Bayesian Programming is more general than [[Bayesian network]]s and has a power of expression equivalent to probabilistic [[factor graph]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bcf.usc.edu/~rosenblo/Pubs/agi15_demski.pdf|title=Expression Graphs: Unifying Factor Graphs and Sum-Product Networks|last=|first=|date=|website=bcf.usc.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formalism ==

A Bayesian program is a means of specifying a family of probability distributions.

The constituent elements of a Bayesian program are presented below:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-097-prediction-machine-learning-and-statistics-spring-2012/lecture-notes/MIT15_097S12_lec15.pdf|title=Probabilistic Modeling and Bayesian Analysis|last=|first=|date=|website=ocw.mit.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# A program is constructed from a description and a question.
# A description is constructed using some specification (&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;) as given by the programmer and an identification or learning process for the parameters not completely specified by the specification, using a data set (&lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;).
# A specification is constructed from a set of pertinent variables, a decomposition and a set of forms.
# Forms are either parametric forms or questions to other Bayesian programs.
# A question specifies which probability distribution has to be computed.

=== Description ===

The purpose of a description is to specify an effective method of computing a [[joint probability distribution]]
on a set of [[Random variable|variables]] &lt;math&gt;\left\{ X_{1},X_{2},\cdots,X_{N}\right\}&lt;/math&gt; given a set of experimental data &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; and some
specification &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;. This [[Joint probability distribution|joint distribution]] is denoted as: &lt;math&gt;P\left(X_{1}\wedge X_{2}\wedge\cdots\wedge X_{N}\mid\delta\wedge\pi\right)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~cs134/K_F_Ch3.pdf|title=Bayesian Networks|last=|first=|date=|website=cs.brandeis.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To specify preliminary knowledge &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;, the programmer must undertake the following:

# Define the set of relevant [[Random variable|variables]] &lt;math&gt;\left\{ X_{1},X_{2},\cdots,X_{N}\right\}&lt;/math&gt; on which the joint distribution is defined.
# Decompose the joint distribution (break it into relevant [[Independence (probability theory)|independent]] or [[Conditional probability|conditional probabilities]]).
# Define the forms of each of the distributions (e.g., for each variable, one of the [[list of probability distributions]]).

==== Decomposition ====

Given a partition of &lt;math&gt;\left\{ X_{1},X_{2},\ldots,X_{N}\right\}&lt;/math&gt; containing &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; subsets, &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; variables are defined
&lt;math&gt;L_{1},\cdots,L_{K}&lt;/math&gt;, each corresponding to one of these subsets.
Each variable &lt;math&gt;L_{k}&lt;/math&gt; is obtained as the conjunction of the variables &lt;math&gt;\left\{ X_{k_{1}},X_{k_{2}},\cdots\right\}&lt;/math&gt;
belonging to the &lt;math&gt;k^{th}&lt;/math&gt; subset. Recursive application of [[Bayes' theorem]] leads to:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 &amp; P\left(X_{1}\wedge X_{2}\wedge\cdots\wedge X_{N}\mid\delta\wedge\pi\right)\\
={} &amp; P\left(L_{1}\wedge\cdots\wedge L_{K}\mid\delta\wedge\pi\right)\\
={} &amp; P\left(L_{1}\mid\delta\wedge\pi\right)\times P\left(L_{2}\mid L_{1}\wedge\delta\wedge\pi\right) \times\cdots\times P\left(L_{K}\mid L_{K-1}\wedge\cdots\wedge L_{1}\wedge\delta\wedge\pi\right)\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

[[Conditional independance|Conditional independence]] hypotheses then allow further simplifications. A conditional
independence hypothesis for variable &lt;math&gt;L_{k}&lt;/math&gt; is defined by choosing some variable &lt;math&gt;X_{n}&lt;/math&gt;
among the variables appearing in the conjunction &lt;math&gt;L_{k-1}\wedge\cdots\wedge L_{2}\wedge L_{1}&lt;/math&gt;, labelling &lt;math&gt;R_{k}&lt;/math&gt; as the
conjunction of these chosen variables and setting:

: &lt;math&gt;
P \left(L_{k}\mid L_{k-1}\wedge\cdots\wedge L_{1}\wedge\delta\wedge\pi\right ) = P\left( L_{k} \mid R_{k}\wedge\delta\wedge\pi \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

We then obtain:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 &amp; P\left(X_{1}\wedge X_{2}\wedge\cdots\wedge X_{N}\mid\delta\wedge\pi\right)\\
={} &amp; P\left(L_{1}\mid\delta\wedge\pi\right)\times P\left(L_{2}\mid R_{2}\wedge\delta\wedge\pi\right)\times\cdots\times P\left(L_{K}\mid R_{K}\wedge\delta\wedge\pi\right)\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Such a simplification of the joint distribution as a product of simpler distributions is
called a decomposition, derived using the [[Chain rule (probability)|chain rule]].

This ensures that each variable appears at the most once on the left of a conditioning
bar, which is the necessary and sufficient condition to write mathematically valid
decompositions.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

==== Forms ====

Each distribution &lt;math&gt;P\left(L_{k}\mid R_{k}\wedge\delta\wedge\pi\right)&lt;/math&gt; appearing in the product is then associated
with either a parametric form (i.e., a function &lt;math&gt;f_{\mu}\left(L_{k}\right)&lt;/math&gt;) or a question to another Bayesian program &lt;math&gt;P\left(L_{k}\mid R_{k} \wedge \delta \wedge \pi \right) = P\left(L\mid R\wedge\widehat{\delta}\wedge\widehat{\pi}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

When it is a form &lt;math&gt;f_{\mu}\left(L_{k}\right)&lt;/math&gt;, in general, &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is a vector of parameters that may depend on &lt;math&gt;R_{k}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; or both. Learning
takes place when some of these parameters are computed using the data set &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;.

An important feature of Bayesian Programming is this capacity to use questions to other Bayesian programs as components of the definition of a new Bayesian program. &lt;math&gt;P\left(L_{k}\mid R_{k}\wedge\delta\wedge\pi\right)&lt;/math&gt; is obtained by some inferences done by another Bayesian program defined by the specifications &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\pi}&lt;/math&gt; and the data &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\delta}&lt;/math&gt;. This is similar to calling a subroutine in classical programming and provides an easy way to build [[Bayesian network#Hierarchical models|hierarchical models]].

=== Question ===

Given a description (i.e., &lt;math&gt;P\left(X_{1}\wedge X_{2}\wedge\cdots\wedge X_{N}\mid\delta\wedge\pi\right)&lt;/math&gt;), a question is obtained by partitioning &lt;math&gt;\left\{ X_{1},X_{2},\cdots,X_{N}\right\}&lt;/math&gt;
into three sets: the searched variables, the known variables and
the free variables.

The 3 variables &lt;math&gt;Searched&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Known&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Free&lt;/math&gt; are defined as the
conjunction of the variables belonging to
these sets.

A question is defined as the set
of distributions:

: &lt;math&gt;
P\left(Searched\mid \text{Known}\wedge\delta\wedge\pi\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

made of many "instantiated questions" as the cardinal of &lt;math&gt;Known&lt;/math&gt;,
each instantiated question being the distribution:

: &lt;math&gt;
P\left(\text{Searched}\mid\text{Known}\wedge\delta\wedge\pi\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Inference ===

Given the joint distribution &lt;math&gt;P\left(X_{1}\wedge X_{2}\wedge\cdots\wedge
X_{N}\mid\delta\wedge\pi\right)&lt;/math&gt;, it is always possible to compute any possible question using the following general inference:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 &amp; P\left(\text{Searched}\mid\text{Known}\wedge\delta\wedge\pi\right)\\
={} &amp; \sum_\text{Free}\left[P\left( \text{Searched} \wedge \text{Free} \mid \text{Known}\wedge\delta\wedge\pi\right)\right]\\
={} &amp; \frac{\displaystyle \sum_\text{Free}\left[P\left(\text{Searched}\wedge \text{Free}\wedge \text{Known}\mid\delta\wedge\pi\right)\right]}{\displaystyle P\left(\text{Known}\mid\delta\wedge\pi\right)}\\
={} &amp; \frac{\displaystyle \sum_\text{Free}\left[P\left(\text{Searched}\wedge \text{Free}\wedge \text{Known}\mid\delta\wedge\pi\right)\right]}{\displaystyle \sum_{\text{Free}\wedge \text{Searched}} \left[P\left(\text{Searched} \wedge \text{Free} \wedge \text{Known}\mid\delta\wedge\pi\right)\right]}\\
={} &amp; \frac{1}{Z}\times\sum_\text{Free}\left[P\left(\text{Searched}\wedge \text{Free} \wedge \text{Known} \mid \delta\wedge\pi\right)\right]\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the first equality results from the marginalization rule, the second
results from [[Bayes' theorem]] and the third corresponds to a second application of marginalization. The denominator appears to be a normalization term and can be replaced by a constant &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;.

Theoretically, this allows to solve any Bayesian inference problem. In practice,
however, the cost of computing exhaustively and exactly &lt;math&gt;P\left(\text{Searched} \mid \text{Known} \wedge\delta\wedge\pi\right)&lt;/math&gt; is too great in almost all cases.

Replacing the joint distribution by its decomposition we get:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 &amp; P\left(\text{Searched}\mid \text{Known}\wedge\delta\wedge\pi\right)\\
= {}&amp; \frac{1}{Z} \sum_\text{Free} \left[\prod_{k=1}^K \left[ P\left( L_{i}\mid K_{i} \wedge \pi \right)\right]\right]
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

which is usually a much simpler expression to compute, as the dimensionality of the problem is considerably reduced by the decomposition into a product of lower dimension distributions.

== Example ==

===Bayesian spam detection===

The purpose of [[Bayesian spam filtering]] is to eliminate junk e-mails.

The problem is very easy to formulate. E-mails should be classified
into one of two categories: non-spam or spam. The only available information to classify the e-mails is their content: a set of words. Using these words without taking the order into account is commonly called a [[Bag of words|bag of words model]].

The classifier should furthermore be able to adapt to its user and to learn
from experience. Starting from an initial standard setting, the classifier should
modify its internal parameters when the user disagrees with its own decision.
It will hence adapt to the user’s criteria to differentiate between non-spam and
spam. It will improve its results as it encounters increasingly classified e-mails.

==== Variables ====

The variables necessary to write this program are as follows:
# &lt;math&gt;Spam&lt;/math&gt;: a binary variable, false if the e-mail is not spam and true otherwise.
# &lt;math&gt;W_0,W_1, \ldots, W_{N-1}&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; binary variables. &lt;math&gt;W_n&lt;/math&gt; is true if the &lt;math&gt;n^{th}&lt;/math&gt; word of the dictionary is present in the text.

These &lt;math&gt;N + 1&lt;/math&gt; binary variables sum up all the information
about an e-mail.

==== Decomposition ====

Starting from the joint distribution and applying recursively [[Bayes' theorem]] we obtain:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 &amp; P(\text{Spam}\wedge W_{0}\wedge\cdots\wedge W_{N-1})\\
={} &amp; P(\text{Spam})\times P(W_0 \mid \text{Spam})\times P(W_1 \mid \text{Spam} \wedge W_0)\\
 &amp; \times\cdots\\
 &amp; \times P\left(W_{N-1}\mid\text{Spam}\wedge W_{0}\wedge\cdots\wedge W_{N-2}\right)\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

This is an exact mathematical expression.

It can be drastically simplified by assuming that the probability of appearance of a word knowing the nature of the text (spam or not) is independent of the appearance of the other words. This is the [[naive Bayes]] assumption and this makes this spam filter a [[naive Bayes]] model.

For instance, the programmer can assume that:

: &lt;math&gt;
P(W_1\mid\text{Spam} \land W_0) = P(W_1\mid\text{Spam})
&lt;/math&gt;

to finally obtain:

: &lt;math&gt;
P(\text{Spam} \land W_0 \land \ldots
      \land W_{N-1}) = P(\text{Spam})\prod_{n=0}^{N-1}[P(W_n\mid\text{Spam})]
&lt;/math&gt;

This kind of assumption is known as the [[Naive Bayes classifier|naive Bayes' assumption]]. It  is "naive" in the sense that the independence between words is clearly not completely true. For instance, it completely neglects that the appearance of pairs of words may be more significant than isolated appearances. However, the programmer may assume this hypothesis and may develop the model and the associated inferences to test how reliable and efficient it is.

==== Parametric forms ====

To be able to compute the joint distribution, the programmer must now specify the
&lt;math&gt;N + 1&lt;/math&gt; distributions appearing in the decomposition:

# &lt;math&gt;P(\text{Spam})&lt;/math&gt; is a prior defined, for instance, by &lt;math&gt;P([\text{Spam}=1]) = 0.75 &lt;/math&gt;
# Each of the &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;  forms &lt;math&gt;P(W_n\mid\text{Spam})&lt;/math&gt; may be specified using [[Laplace rule of succession]] (this is a pseudocounts-based [[N-gram#Smoothing techniques|smoothing technique]] to counter the [[PPM compression algorithm|zero-frequency problem]] of words never-seen-before):
## &lt;math&gt;P(W_n\mid[\text{Spam}=\text{false}])=\frac{1+a^n_f}{2+a_f}&lt;/math&gt;
## &lt;math&gt;P(W_n\mid[\text{Spam}=\text{true}])=\frac{1+a^n_t}{2+a_t}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;a^n_f&lt;/math&gt; stands for the number of appearances of the &lt;math&gt;n^{th}&lt;/math&gt; word in non-spam e-mails and &lt;math&gt;a_f&lt;/math&gt; stands for the total number of non-spam e-mails. Similarly, &lt;math&gt;a_t^n&lt;/math&gt; stands for the number of appearances of the &lt;math&gt;n^{th}&lt;/math&gt; word in spam e-mails and &lt;math&gt;a_t&lt;/math&gt; stands for the total number of spam e-mails.

==== Identification ====

The &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;  forms &lt;math&gt;P(W_n\mid\text{Spam})&lt;/math&gt; are not yet completely specified because the &lt;math&gt;2N + 2&lt;/math&gt; parameters &lt;math&gt;a_f^{n=0, \ldots, N-1}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a_t^{n=0, \ldots, N-1}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a_f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_t&lt;/math&gt; have no values yet.

The identification of these parameters could be done either by batch processing a series of classified e-mails or by an incremental updating of the parameters using the user's classifications of the e-mails as they arrive.

Both methods could be combined: the system could start with initial standard values of these parameters issued from a generic database, then some incremental learning customizes the classifier to each individual user.

==== Question ====

The question asked to the program is: "what is the probability for a given text to be spam knowing which words appear and don't appear in this text?"
It can be formalized by:

: &lt;math&gt;P (\text{Spam}\mid w_0 \wedge\cdots\wedge w_{N-1} )&lt;/math&gt;

which can be computed as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 &amp; P(\text{Spam}\mid w_{0}\wedge\cdots\wedge w_{N-1} )\\
={} &amp; \frac{\displaystyle P(\text{Spam}) \prod_{n=0}^{N-1} [ P(w_{n}\mid\text{Spam})]}{\displaystyle \sum_\text{Spam} [P(\text{Spam}) \prod_{n=0}^{N-1}  [P (w_{n}\mid\text{Spam})]]}\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The denominator appears to be a [[Normalizing constant|normalization constant]]. It is not necessary to compute it to decide if we are dealing with spam. For instance, an easy trick is to compute the ratio:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 &amp; \frac{P([\text{Spam}=\text{true}]\mid w_0\wedge\cdots\wedge w_{N-1})}{P([ \text{Spam} = \text{false} ]\mid w_0 \wedge\cdots\wedge w_{N-1})}\\
={} &amp; \frac{P([ \text{Spam}=\text{true} ] )}{P([ \text{Spam} =\text{false} ])}\times\prod_{n=0}^{N-1} \left[\frac{P(w_n\mid [\text{Spam}=\text{true}])}{P(w_n\mid [\text{Spam} = \text{false}])}\right] \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

This computation is faster and easier because it requires only &lt;math&gt;2N&lt;/math&gt; products.

==== Bayesian program ====

The Bayesian spam filter program is completely defined by:

: &lt;math&gt;
\Pr
\begin{cases}
  Ds
  \begin{cases}
    Sp (\pi)
    \begin{cases}
       Va: \text{Spam},W_0,W_1 \ldots W_{N-1} \\
       Dc:
        \begin{cases}
          P(\text{Spam} \land W_0 \land \ldots \land W_n \land \ldots \land W_{N-1})\\
         = P(\text{Spam})\prod_{n=0}^{N-1}P(W_n\mid\text{Spam})
       \end{cases}\\
       Fo:
       \begin{cases}
          P(\text{Spam}):
          \begin{cases}
             P([\text{Spam}=\text{false}])=0.25 \\
             P([\text{Spam}=\text{true}])=0.75
          \end{cases}\\
           P(W_n\mid\text{Spam}):
           \begin{cases}
               P(W_n\mid[\text{Spam}=\text{false}])\\
               =\frac{1+a^n_f}{2+a_f} \\
               P(W_n\mid[\text{Spam}=\text{true}])\\
               =\frac{1+a^n_t}{2+a_t}
           \end{cases} \\
         \end{cases}\\
       \end{cases}\\
   \text{Identification (based on }\delta)
   \end{cases}\\
   Qu: P(\text{Spam}\mid w_0 \land \ldots \land w_n \land \ldots \land w_{N-1})
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Bayesian filter, Kalman filter and hidden Markov model===

Bayesian filters (often called [[Recursive Bayesian estimation]]) are generic probabilistic models for time evolving processes. Numerous models are particular instances of this generic approach, for instance: the [[Kalman filter]] or the [[Hidden Markov model]] (HMM).

==== Variables ====

* Variables &lt;math&gt;S^{0},\ldots,S^{T}&lt;/math&gt; are a time series of state variables considered to be on a time horizon ranging from &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;.
* Variables &lt;math&gt;O^{0},\ldots,O^{T}&lt;/math&gt; are a time series of observation variables on the same horizon.

==== Decomposition ====

The decomposition is based:
* on &lt;math&gt;P(S^t \mid S^{t-1})&lt;/math&gt;, called the system model, transition model or dynamic model, which formalizes the transition from the state at time &lt;math&gt;t-1&lt;/math&gt; to the state at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;;
* on &lt;math&gt;P(O^t\mid S^t)&lt;/math&gt;, called the observation model, which expresses what can be observed at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; when the system is in state &lt;math&gt;S^t&lt;/math&gt;;
* on an initial state at time &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;P(S^0 \wedge O^0)&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Parametrical forms ====

The parametrical forms are not constrained and different choices lead to different well-known models: see Kalman filters and Hidden Markov models just below.

==== Question ====

The typical question for such models is &lt;math&gt;P\left(S^{t+k}\mid O^{0}\wedge\cdots\wedge O^{t}\right)&lt;/math&gt;: what is the probability distribution for the state at time &lt;math&gt;t + k&lt;/math&gt; knowing the observations from instant &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;?

The most common case is Bayesian filtering where &lt;math&gt;k=0&lt;/math&gt;, which searches for the present state, knowing past observations.

However it is also possible &lt;math&gt;(k&gt;0)&lt;/math&gt;, to extrapolate a future state from past observations, or to do smoothing &lt;math&gt;(k&lt;0)&lt;/math&gt;, to recover a past state from observations made either before or after that instant.

More complicated questions may also be asked as shown below in the HMM section.

Bayesian filters &lt;math&gt;(k=0)&lt;/math&gt; have a very interesting recursive property, which contributes greatly to their attractiveness. &lt;math&gt;P\left(S^{t}|O^{0}\wedge\cdots\wedge O^{t}\right)&lt;/math&gt; may be computed simply from &lt;math&gt;P\left(S^{t 1}\mid O^0 \wedge \cdots \wedge O^{t-1}\right)&lt;/math&gt; with the following formula:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{ll}
 &amp; P\left(S^{t}|O^{0}\wedge\cdots\wedge O^{t}\right)\\
= &amp; P\left(O^{t}|S^{t}\right)\times\sum_{S^{t-1}}\left[P\left(S^{t}|S^{t-1}\right)\times P\left(S^{t-1}|O^{0}\wedge\cdots\wedge O^{t-1}\right)\right]\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

Another interesting point of view for this equation is to consider that there are two phases: a
prediction phase and an estimation phase:
* During the prediction phase, the state is predicted using the dynamic model and the estimation of the state at the previous moment:

:: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{ll}
 &amp; P\left(S^{t}|O^{0}\wedge\cdots\wedge O^{t-1}\right)\\
= &amp; \sum_{S^{t-1}}\left[P\left(S^{t}|S^{t-1}\right)\times P\left(S^{t-1}|O^{0}\wedge\cdots\wedge O^{t-1}\right)\right]\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;
* During the estimation phase, the prediction is either confirmed or invalidated using the last observation:
:: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 &amp; P\left(S^{t}\mid O^{0}\wedge\cdots\wedge O^{t}\right)\\
={} &amp; P\left(O^{t}\mid S^{t}\right)\times P\left(S^{t}|O^{0}\wedge\cdots\wedge O^{t-1}\right)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

\left(k&lt;0\right)\equiv \text{Smoothing} \end{array}\end{cases}\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

====Kalman filter====

The very well-known [[Kalman filter]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kalman|first=R. E.|title=A New Approach to Linear Filtering and Prediction Problems|journal=Transactions of the ASME--Journal of Basic Engineering|year=1960|volume=82|pages=33–45|doi=10.1115/1.3662552}}&lt;/ref&gt; are a special case of Bayesian
filters.

They are defined by the following Bayesian program:

: &lt;math&gt;
Pr\begin{cases}
Ds\begin{cases}
Sp(\pi)\begin{cases}
Va:\\
S^{0},\cdots,S^{T},O^{0},\cdots,O^{T}\\
Dc:\\
\begin{cases}
 &amp; P\left(S^{0}\wedge\cdots\wedge O^{T}|\pi\right)\\
= &amp; \left[\begin{array}{c}
P\left(S^{0}\wedge O^{0}|\pi\right)\\
\prod_{t=1}^{T}\left[P\left(S^{t}|S^{t-1}\wedge\pi\right)\times P\left(O^{t}|S^{t}\wedge\pi\right)\right]\end{array}\right]\end{cases}\\
Fo:\\
\begin{cases}
P\left(S^t \mid S^{t-1}\wedge\pi\right)\equiv G\left(S^{t},A\bullet S^{t-1},Q\right)\\
P\left(O^t \mid S^t \wedge\pi\right)\equiv G\left(O^{t},H\bullet S^{t},R\right)\end{cases}\end{cases}\\
Id\end{cases}\\
Qu:\\
P\left(S^T \mid O^0 \wedge\cdots\wedge O^{T}\wedge\pi\right)\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
* Variables are continuous.
* The transition model &lt;math&gt;P(S^t \mid S^{t-1}\wedge\pi)&lt;/math&gt; and the observation model &lt;math&gt;P(O^t \mid S^t \wedge\pi)&lt;/math&gt; are both specified using Gaussian laws with means that are linear functions of the conditioning variables.

With these hypotheses and by using the recursive formula, it is possible to solve
the inference problem analytically to answer the usual &lt;math&gt;P(S^T \mid O^0 \wedge\cdots\wedge O^T \wedge\pi)&lt;/math&gt; question.
This leads to an extremely efficient algorithm, which explains the popularity of Kalman filters and the number of their everyday applications.

When there are no obvious linear transition and observation models, it is still often
possible, using a first-order Taylor's expansion, to treat these models as locally linear.
This generalization is commonly called the [[extended Kalman filter]].

====Hidden Markov model====

[[Hidden Markov model]]s (HMMs) are another very popular specialization of Bayesian filters.

They are defined by the following Bayesian program:

: &lt;math&gt;
\Pr\begin{cases}
Ds\begin{cases}
Sp(\pi)\begin{cases}
Va:\\
S^{0},\ldots,S^{T},O^{0},\ldots,O^{T}\\
Dc:\\
\begin{cases}
 &amp; P\left(S^{0}\wedge\cdots\wedge O^{T}\mid\pi\right)\\
= &amp; \left[\begin{array}{c}
P\left(S^{0}\wedge O^{0}\mid\pi\right)\\
\prod_{t=1}^{T}\left[P\left(S^{t}\mid S^{t-1}\wedge\pi\right)\times P\left(O^{t}\mid S^{t}\wedge\pi\right)\right]\end{array}\right]\end{cases}\\
Fo:\\
\begin{cases}
P\left(S^{0}\wedge O^{0}\mid\pi\right)\equiv \text{Matrix}\\
P\left(S^{t}\mid S^{t-1}\wedge\pi\right)\equiv \text{Matrix}\\
P\left(O^{t}\mid S^{t}\wedge\pi\right)\equiv \text{Matrix}\end{cases}\end{cases}\\
Id\end{cases}\\
Qu:\\
\max_{S^{1}\wedge\cdots\wedge S^{T-1}}\left[P\left(S^{1}\wedge\cdots\wedge S^{T-1}\mid S^{T}\wedge O^{0}\wedge\cdots\wedge O^{T}\wedge\pi\right)\right]\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
* Variables are treated as being discrete.
* The transition model &lt;math&gt;P\left(S^{t}\mid S^{t-1}\wedge\pi\right)&lt;/math&gt; and the observation model &lt;math&gt;P\left(O^{t}\mid S^{t}\wedge\pi\right)&lt;/math&gt; are
both specified using probability matrices.
* The question most frequently asked of HMMs is:
:: &lt;math&gt;
\max_{S^{1}\wedge\cdots\wedge S^{T-1}}\left[P\left(S^{1}\wedge\cdots\wedge S^{T-1}\mid S^{T}\wedge O^{0}\wedge\cdots\wedge O^{T}\wedge\pi\right)\right]
&lt;/math&gt;

What is the most probable series of states that leads to the present state, knowing the past observations?

This particular question may be answered with a specific and very efficient algorithm
called the [[Viterbi algorithm]].

The [[Baum–Welch algorithm]] has been developed
for HMMs.

=== Pattern recognition ===
Bayesian program learning has potential applications voice recognition and synthesis, image recognition and natural language processing. It employs the principles of ''compositionality'' (building abstract representations from parts), ''causality'' (building complexity from parts) and ''learning to learn'' (using previously recognized concepts to ease the creation of new concepts).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = New algorithm helps machines learn as quickly as humans|url = http://www.gizmag.com/artificial-intelligence-algorithm-learning/41448|website = www.gizmag.com|access-date = 2016-01-23|date = 2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Possibility theories ==

The comparison between probabilistic approaches (not only bayesian programming) and possibility theories continues to be debated.

Possibility theories like, for instance, [[fuzzy set]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zadeh|first=Lofti, A.|journal=Information and Control|year=1965|volume=8|issue=3|pages=338–353|doi=10.1016/S0019-9958(65)90241-X|title=Fuzzy sets}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[fuzzy logic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zadeh|first=Lofti, A.|journal=Synthese|year=1975|volume=30|issue=3–4|pages=407–428|doi=10.1007/BF00485052|title=Fuzzy logic and approximate reasoning}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[possibility theory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dubois|first=D.|author2=Prade, H.|title=Possibility Theory, Probability Theory and Multiple-Valued Logics: A Clarification|journal=Ann. Math. Artif. Intell.|year=2001|volume=32|issue=1–4|pages=35–66|doi=10.1023/A:1016740830286|url=ftp://ftp.irit.fr/IRIT/ADRIA/AMAI-Dub.Pra.revised.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; are alternatives to probability to model uncertainty. They argue that probability is insufficient or inconvenient to model certain aspects of incomplete/uncertain knowledge.

The defense of probability is mainly based on [[Cox's theorem]], which starts from four postulates concerning rational reasoning in the presence of uncertainty. It demonstrates that the only mathematical framework that satisfies these postulates is probability theory. The argument is that any approach other than probability necessarily infringes one of these postulates and the value of that infringement.

== Probabilistic programming ==

The purpose of [[Probabilistic relational programming language|probabilistic programming]] is to unify the scope of classical programming languages with probabilistic modeling (especially [[bayesian network]]s) to deal with uncertainty while profiting from the programming languages' expressiveness to encode complexity.

Extended classical programming languages include logical languages as proposed in [[Abductive logic programming|Probabilistic Horn Abduction]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Poole|first=D.|title=Probabilistic Horn abduction and Bayesian networks|journal=Artificial Intelligence|year=1993|volume=64|pages=81–129|doi=10.1016/0004-3702(93)90061-F}}&lt;/ref&gt; Independent Choice Logic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Poole|first=D.|title=The Independent Choice Logic for modelling multiple agents under uncertainty|journal=Artificial Intelligence|year=1997|volume=94|pages=7–56|doi=10.1016/S0004-3702(97)00027-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; PRISM,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sato|first=T.|author2=Kameya, Y.|title=Parameter learning of logic programs for symbolic-statistical modeling|journal=Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research|year=2001|volume=15|issue=2001|pages=391–454|url=http://www.jair.org/media/912/live-912-2013-jair.pdf|bibcode=2011arXiv1106.1797S|arxiv=1106.1797|doi=10.1613/jair.912}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ProbLog which proposes an extension of Prolog.

It can also be extensions of [[Functional programming|functional programming languages]] (essentially [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] and [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]]) such as IBAL or CHURCH. The underlying programming languages can be object-oriented as in BLOG and FACTORIE or more standard ones as in CES and FIGARO.&lt;ref&gt;{{github|p2t2/figaro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of Bayesian programming is different. Jaynes' precept of "probability as logic" argues that probability is an extension of and an alternative to logic above which a complete theory of rationality, computation and programming can be rebuilt.&lt;ref name="Jaynes2003"/&gt; Bayesian programming attempts to replace classical languages with a programming approach based on probability that considers [[Completeness (logic)|incompleteness]] and [[Uncertainty quantification|uncertainty]].

The precise comparison between the [[semantics]] and power of expression of Bayesian and probabilistic programming is an open question.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9128">'''Complementary holism''' is a [[social theory]] or conceptual framework proposed by [[Michael Albert]] and [[Robin Hahnel]], that sees all societies as consisting of a Human Center and Institutional Boundaries, and that all social relations in the political, economic, community/cultural and kinship "spheres" as mutually interacting to defining our social experiences. Complementary holism does not rest on an ''a priori'' assumption that a particular sphere is the base and all else is superstructure, as [[historical materialism]] does, but rather that we must take an empirical look at society's development and assess how it has been shaped by all social forces. Complementary holists agree with [[Marxists]] that economics is important to human and social development, just as they do with [[anarchists]] in regard to the [[State (polity)|State]] or with [[feminists]] in regard to [[gender inequality]], but they assert that Marxists see economics, or [[class conflict]], as the sole factor, and they don't believe that economics is always the most important factor.

In ''Liberating Theory'', Michael Albert, Robin Hahnel et al. write that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Just as Marx and Engels paid strict attention to "state of the art" science in their time, we should keep up with contemporary developments. Ironically, however, though most contemporary Marxists pride themselves on being "scientific," few bother to notice that "state of the art" science has changed dramatically in the last hundred years. While avoiding simplistic mimicry and misapplication of scientific principles, we should update our methods by seriously examining contemporary science for new ideas relevant to our theoretical efforts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Modern quantum physics, for example, teaches that reality is not a collection of separate entities but a vast and intricate "unbroken whole." Ilya Prigogine comments, "The new paradigms of science may be expected to develop into the new science of connectedness which means the recognition of unity in diversity." When thinking about phenomena, we inevitably conceptually abstract parts from the whole in which they reside, but they then exist as separate entities only in our perceptions. There are no isolated electrons, for example, only fields of force continually ebbing and flowing in a seamless web of activity which manifests events that we choose to call electrons because it suits our analytic purposes. For the physicist, each electron, quark, or whatever is a "process" and a "network." As a process it has a developmental trajectory--extending through all time. As a network, it is part of an interactive pattern--stretching throughout all space. Every part embodies and is subsumed in a larger whole.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Human Center and Institutional Boundary==
Each society has a human center where we find people, their consciousness, personalities, talents and needs. Each society also has an institutional boundary consisting of social institutions and their role structures. Just as our consciousnesses, needs and desires are shaped by the institutions we create to facilitate our social activities so are our institutions shaped by our cultural traditions. How we define our institutions and the roles we play in society has an important effect on what kind of people we become.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Society's center and boundary are ''complementary'' aspects of a single unbroken whole. Both center and boundary are complex dissipative systems. Whatever society's defining features may be, they will necessarily pervade both society's center and boundary. They will persist through evolutionary changes since such changes necessarily involve limited adaptations of both center and boundary. Revolution, however, will alter these defining features. Since we know that historically people universally engage in certain social activities, which in turn involve social relations contouring daily life and governing group interactions, as our next conceptual step it makes sense to subdivide society along lines highlighting these activities, social relations, and social groups. (''Liberating Theory'')&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Spheres==
Complementary holism carves out the Human Center and Institutional Boundary into four separate but interconnecting social spheres: the Economic Sphere, the Kinship Sphere, the Community Sphere and the Political Sphere.

# The [[Economic]] Sphere is where the production, consumption, and allocation of material means of life occur. The key institutions for the economy are workplaces, allocation mechanisms, property relations, and remuneration schemes.
# The [[Kinship]] Sphere is where child rearing, nurturing future generations, socializing and care giving occur. Key institutions are the family, with parental and child rearing roles, where gender and sexuality, and other relations form for boys and girls, men and women, fathers and mothers, adults, children and the elderly.
# The [[Political]] Sphere is where adjudication, policy regulation and law making occur with courts, a legislature and police.
# The [[Community]] Sphere is where identity, religion, and spirituality occur with race, ethnicity, places of worship, beliefs about life and death, celebration of cultural traditions, etc.

Like the human center and institutional boundary, these four spheres interconnect with one another:

&lt;blockquote&gt;People aren't economically-affected in one part of their lives and gender-affected in another; state-influenced one day of the week and community-influenced some other day. Instead, they simultaneously experience economic, kinship, governance, and community involvements, and this guarantees that spheres interact. At a particular time class may have more influence on molding a person's consciousness and behavior than gender, or vice-versa. But these influences must co-exist. ''(Liberating Theory)''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Accommodation==
Accommodation describes a particular way in which the four spheres interact with each other. The assigned roles that are a feature of one sphere may be accommodated in another. How our roles are divided in the workplace may accommodate with sexist and racist divisions found as central features in our Kinship and Community Spheres so that economic activity subjugates women and non-whites to lower pay and positions of power than men and whites.

==Co-Definition==
Another way the four spheres can interact is by co-defining each other. For example, workplace roles are often determined by more than "class divisions."

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is nothing inherent in capitalist economic relations that requires the activity of coffee-making to be assigned to the role of secretary. There is no purely economic reason why in the U.S., women are ghettoized into so-called "pink collar" jobs: clerical work, nursing, domestic work, restaurant and food service, retail sales, elementary school teaching, etc. There is nothing about economics that requires that in addition to different levels of compensation, women's and men's activities must or even should involve different degrees of oversight and mobility. Purely economic dynamics cannot explain such profound gender differentiations. In this sense, then, not only do economic relations accommodate kinship hierarchies, by placing women in the lowest "economicallydefined" positions, but patriarchy "co-defines" basic economic relations. (''Liberating Theory'')&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Social Change==
Proponents of complementary holism feel the social theory is not only helpful in understanding society as it is but in understanding how society can be changed. By recognizing the interconnecting social forces - the human center, institutional boundary and four social spheres - and how they shape and are shaped by the intertwining relationship with each other, complementary holists feel we are better equipped to transform society and overcome social oppressions.

Complementary holism sees two ways in which societies can change:

# ''Reproduction'': This is where a change recreates a past social feature. An example could be where a revolution overthrows one hierarchical political system and replaces it with another.
# ''Transformation'': This is where social activities create an entirely new characteristics that differ from the past. For example, a social revolution may overthrow a [[market economy]] and replace it with a self-managed [[participatory economy]].

The '''Damascus Pentateuch''' ({{lang-he| כֶּתֶר דַּמֶּשֶׂק}} '''''Keter Dameseq''''' or '''Crown of Damascus''') is a 10th century Hebrew Bible [[codex]] (Pentateuch),&lt;ref&gt;In the glosses of the very last page of Deuteronomy (458 in vol. 2), in the hand-writing of a second person (probably the owner of the codex), is appended a memorial of his wife’s passing in 4943 [[anno mundi]] (or what corresponds to 1183 CE).&lt;/ref&gt; containing the first Five Books of Moses. The codex was copied by an unknown scribe, replete with Masoretic annotations. The manuscript is defective in its beginning, as it starts with Genesis 9:26 (Exodus 18:1–23 is also missing). It was acquired by the [[Jewish National and University Library]] in 1975,&lt;ref&gt;Jerusalem National Library (Ms. Heb. 24°5702 ; Sassoon 507 (formerly). Microfilm no. F-8886&lt;/ref&gt; and published in a large, two-volume facsimile edition in 1978&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wdl.org/en/item/11364/view/1/1/ The Damascus Pentateuch] (ed. D.S. Loewinger), for the [[Jewish National and University Library]], Jerusalem, pub. The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore 1978 (2 volumes)&lt;/ref&gt; (not to be confused with another Damascus Keter, of medieval Spanish origin).

==History==
The Damascus Pentateuch came to renown owing largely to the works of the bibliophile, [[David Sassoon#Progeny|David Solomon Sassoon]], who bought the codex in Damascus in the early 20th century. It is one of the oldest extant Bible codices, ranking with that of the [[Aleppo Codex]] and [[Leningrad Codex]]. In many places, the Damascus Pentateuch follows the traditions of the masorete, [[Aaron ben Asher]], in ''plene'' and ''defective scriptum'', as well as in most large and small letters, being harmonious with the Masoretic variants prescribed by Ben-Asher up to 52% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Israel Yeivin, ''The Aleppo Codex of the Bible (A Study of its Vocalization and Accentuation)'', Jerusalem 1968, p. 361.&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Masoretic tradition of Ben Asher, the copyist of the Damascus Pentateuch also writes '''פצוע דכא''' in Deut. 23:2 with an ''aleph'', and writes '''תעשה''' in Exo. 25:31 in ''defective scriptum'', without a ''yod'', as also the word '''האפד''' in Exo. 28:26 is written by him in ''defective scriptum'', without a ''waw''. Such practices are also common with Aaron Ben Asher.&lt;ref&gt;As shown by early witnesses who saw the Aleppo Codex and described its content, such as Menashe Sathon, whose notes on the Aleppo Codex were sent to Jerusalem and later reviewed by M.D. Cassuto, who relayed the same unto Rabbi Yaakov Sapir (19th century). Yishai ben Amram ha-Cohen Amadi (late 16th century) had also seen the Aleppo Codex. See: Joseph Offer, ''M.D. Cassuto's Notes on the Aleppo Codex'', Sefunot: Studies and Sources on the History of the Jewish Communities in the East (pub. by the [[Ben-Zvi Institute]]), Jerusalem 1989, p. 309 [33].&lt;/ref&gt;  It is written on parchment, in three columns to the page, in large oriental square script typical of writing scripts used in the 9th century. Like other codices of its era, it bears [[micrography]] known as the ''Masora Magna'' (large ''Masora''), that is, the preservation of the [[Minutiae|minutiæ]] of the text-tradition written as a gloss on the top and bottom of each page, as well as the ''Masora Parva'' (small ''Masora'') written in between the columns. According to Sassoon, the writer of the ''[[Masoretic Text|Masora]]'' (critical notes of the Masoretic annotations) was a follower of Ben Asher, yet the Bible text (orthography and vocalization) follows that of [[Ben Naphtali]] and his school.&lt;ref name=london1932&gt;''Ohel Dawid – Descriptive Catalogue of the Hebrew and Samaritan Manuscripts in the Sassoon Library, London'', David Solomon Sassoon, vol. 1, London: Oxford University Press 1932, pp. [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37055&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=81&amp;hilite= 22–23]&lt;/ref&gt; As to the age of the Codex, Sassoon has posited that “the manuscript is probably older than the British Museum MS., No. Oriental 4445, which is supposed to have been written about 820–850 CE., of Babylonian origin.&lt;ref name=london1932 /&gt; The text is furnished with [[Tiberian vocalization|Tiberian]] vowel points, accents, and the ''[[Rafe]]h'' strokes, e.g. the horizontal line written above the non-accentuated letters of '''בג"ד כפ"ת''', including the '''א''' in some cases, as on p.&amp;nbsp;54 in vol. 1 (on Genesis 32:28&lt;ref&gt;In the Hebrew Bible, it is Genesis 32:29&lt;/ref&gt;), ישר'''א'''ל. The smaller divisions for the weekly biblical lections, otherwise known as ''Sedarim'', are marked throughout the codex by the writer of the ''Masora'' by a large ''samekh'' ('''ס''') in the margin with the number of the ''Seder'' below.&lt;ref name=london1932 /&gt;

The style of lettering follows an archaic style; the leg of the Hebrew character ''qof'' ('''ק''') is joined to its roof, while the ''he'' ('''ה''') is made like the ''ḥet'' ('''ח'''), with hardly any distinction between the two letters. The ''lamed'' ('''ל''') is written exceptionally long, and hooked towards the outside. The final ''nun'' ('''ן''') is written almost the same as the letter ''zayn''.

All the ''qərē''&lt;ref&gt;That is, what is not written in the text, but must be read aloud in the text.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''kətiv''&lt;ref&gt;That this, what is actually written in the text, but is not read in the text. Instead, the word is replaced by a different reading.&lt;/ref&gt; are marked by the writer of the text with a final ''nun'' in the margin without any further direction as to what the reading should be.&lt;ref name=london1932 /&gt;

A summary of the Damascus Pentateuch was made by [[Israel Yeivin]], in connection with the problems of the Aleppo Codex.&lt;ref&gt;Israel Yeivin, ''The Aleppo Codex of the Bible (A study of its vocalization and accentuation)'', Jerusalem 1968, pp. 361-362 (Hebrew: כתר ארם צובה : ניקודו וטעמיו).&lt;/ref&gt; According to Yeivin, the ''textus receptus'' of the Damascus Pentateuch is mostly harmonious with the Leningrad Codex. As for the variants in vocalization it follows that of Ben Asher up to 52% of the time, and that of Ben Naphtali up to 46% of the time, for which diversity it has been called by him "a mixed manuscript where one can find in it a few 'improvements,' but which differs in several aspects regarding its vocalization and trope symbols from the Aleppo Codex."&lt;ref&gt;Israel Yeivin, ''The Aleppo Codex of the Bible (A study of its vocalization and accentuation)'', Jerusalem 1968, pp. 361-362.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Darwin's Angel''''' is a book published in response to [[Richard Dawkins]]' ''[[The God Delusion]]''. It was written by [[John Cornwell (writer)|John Cornwell]] and subtitled ''An Angelic Riposte to The God Delusion''.

Cornwell runs a "Public Understanding of Science" programme at [[Jesus College, Cambridge]], one of the constituent colleges of the [[University of Cambridge]]. He has previously written reviews of religious and scientific books, including other works of Dawkins. He stated that he finds ''The God Delusion'' harmful in its failure to tackle the problem of extremism, and wrong on many important issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A great debate for heaven's sake |work=Cambridge Evening News |url=http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/news/features/2007/09/17/01a992cd-b6a6-44a4-96aa-30ea96d47914.lpf |accessdate=5 October 2007 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
In this book, Cornwell adopts the persona of the [[guardian angel]] of [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Gregor Mendel]], who is now looking after [[Richard Dawkins]]. He pens a letter to Dawkins in 21 chapters.&lt;ref&gt;The summaries here are quotes or direct paraphrases from the relevant chapters of Darwin's Angel.&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''A Summary of your Argument'' suggests that Dawkins regards all claims about God's existence as "the exclusive province of science and reason".
# ''Your Sources'' suggests that the book ignores distinguished scholarship and uses inappropriate sources.
# ''Imagination'' suggests that Dawkins takes things too literally.
# ''Beauty'' suggests that Dawkins misunderstands the links between beauty, creativity and faith, and suggests he studies [[George Steiner]], [[William Blake]], [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[C. S. Lewis]].
# ''What is Religion'' suggests that religion is not science and that Dawkins should study sociologists of religion such as [[Émile Durkheim]].
# ''Is God Supernatural?'' claims that Dawkins' image of God is not what most theists believe in.
# ''Celestial Teapots'' suggests that the comparison with [[Russell's teapot]] is misplaced because Cornwell claims there are ''prima facie'', albeit inconclusive, grounds for believing in God.

[[Anthony Kenny]] reviewed the book in ''[[The Tablet]]'' noting that both Cornwell and Dawkins fail to observe the prime rule of intellectual debate, that one should attack the opponent's arguments, not his personality. Kenny goes on to say that neither ''The God Delusion'' nor ''Darwin's Angel'' "provides the reader with sufficient grounds for a reasoned conclusion" about God's existence.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Kenny]] in [[The Tablet]] 13 September 2007 [http://www.thetablet.co.uk/reviews/359 Argument not always angelic]&lt;/ref&gt; A profile of ''Darwin's Angel'' in ''[[New Scientist]]'' by Amanda Gefter criticised Cornwell for confusing two meanings of "religion" demarcated in ''[[The God Delusion]]'' and for holding one religion in higher esteem than any other. She also suggested that both books are part of a modern debate that is suffering from the fact that the two sides do not concentrate on one definition of religion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19526221.800-review-ian-angelic-riposte-to-the-god-delusioni-by-john-cornwell.html Review: ''An angelic riposte to the God Delusion'' by John Cornwell – 22 September 2007 – New Scientist Space&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Darwin's Angel'' is listed on the RichardDawkins.net website as one of several "fleas" following ''The God Delusion''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The fleas are multiplying |url=http://old.richarddawkins.net/articles/1617-the-fleas-are-multiplying |accessdate=12 September 2007 |work=www.RichardDawkins.net |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140121235026/http://old.richarddawkins.net/articles/1617-the-fleas-are-multiplying |archivedate=21 January 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dawkins, the book contains a number of inaccurate portrayals of what he actually said. Dawkins questions whether these are "honest mistakes or willful mendacity".&lt;ref name=dawkins&gt;{{cite web |title=Honest Mistakes or Willful Mendacity |first=Richard |last=Dawkins |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |url=http://richarddawkins.net/article,1610,Honest-Mistakes-or-Willful-Mendacity,Richard-Dawkins |accessdate=10 September 2007 |work=www.RichardDawkins.net |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011120904/http://richarddawkins.net/article%2C1610%2CHonest-Mistakes-or-Willful-Mendacity%2CRichard-Dawkins |archivedate=11 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He suggests six examples where his writing has been quoted out of context or otherwise misrepresented. For example, Cornwell suggests that Dawkins would have been in favour of [[Social Darwinism]] when in ''[[A Devil's Chaplain]]'' Dawkins has explicitly condemned such views and says no one supports such ideas any more.&lt;ref name=dawkins /&gt;

An '''eco-municipality''' or '''eco-town''' is a [[local government]] area that has adopted [[ecological]] and [[social justice]] values in its [[charter]]. The development of eco-municipalities stems from changing systems in [[Sweden]], where more than seventy municipal governments have accepted varying principles of [[sustainability]] in their operations as well as community-wide decision making processes.&lt;ref&gt;Miranda Spencer (September 22, 2005) [http://sustainablebusiness.com/features/feature_template.cfm?ID=1269 Building Sustainable Cities: Scandinavia's "Eco-Municipalities" Show the Way].sustainablebusiness.com. Retrieved on: November 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of these policies is to increase the overall sustainability of the community.

The distinction between an eco-municipality and other [[sustainable development]] projects (such as [[green building]] and [[alternative energy]]) is the focus on community involvement and social transformation in a public agency as well as the use of a [[holistic]] [[systems thinking|systems]] approach. An eco-municipality is one that recognizes that issues of sustainability are key to all decisions made by government. &lt;ref&gt;Torbjorn Lahti and Sarah James (May 17, 2005) [http://www.wisconsinplanners.org/Ecomunicipalities/EcoMunicipalitySynopsis.pdf The Eco-municipality Model for Sustainable Community Change: A systems approach to creating sustainable communities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807163009/http://www.wisconsinplanners.org/Ecomunicipalities/EcoMunicipalitySynopsis.pdf |date=2008-08-07 }}.

==History==
In 1983 the [[Övertorneå]] community of Sweden first adopted an Eco-municipality framework followed by a formal organization in 1995 (SEKOM).

==Framework==
In becoming an eco-municipality, cities or towns typically adopt a resolution, based on the [[Natural Step|Natural Step framework]] (or Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development ([[FSSD]])), which sets the following objectives:
* Reduce dependence upon fossil fuels.
* Reduce dependence upon synthetic chemicals.
* Reduce encroachment upon nature.
* Better meet human needs fairly and efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;Alliance for Sustainability [http://www.afs.nonprofitoffice.com/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&amp;SEC=%7B2E02B44E-ED9D-4C45-B7C7-A670267AE29A%7D&amp;DE=%7B037A8207-109E-46C0-B083-E96FD3882316%7D Ashland, WI and Duluth, MN become Sustainable Cities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903103742/http://www.afs.nonprofitoffice.com/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&amp;SEC=%7B2E02B44E-ED9D-4C45-B7C7-A670267AE29A%7D&amp;DE=%7B037A8207-109E-46C0-B083-E96FD3882316%7D |date=2011-09-03 }}. Retrieved on: February 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Municipalities adopting framework==
Communities in [[North America]], [[Europe]] and Africa ranging in size from villages of 300 to cities of 700,000 have become eco-municipalities. In Sweden, over one hundred municipalities have officially become eco-municipalities. They have formed a [http://www.sekom.se national association of eco-municipalities] to assist one another and work to influence national policy. [[Whistler, BC]], was awarded first place in a [[United Nations]]-endorsed international competition for sustainable communities. Its long-term sustainability plan, Whistler 2020, is based on the Natural Step framework.&lt;ref&gt;Sustain Dane [http://www.sustaindane.org/Pages/ecomunicipality_where.htm Eco-municipalities: Where Are They?]. Retrieved on: February 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Wisconsin]], there is a growing eco-municipality movement which began in the Chequamegon Bay region. As of November 2007, twelve local communities had formally adopted eco-municipality resolutions. The resolutions state the community's intention to become an eco-municipality, endorsing the Natural Step sustainability principles and framework as a guide.&lt;ref&gt;1,000 Friends of Wisconsin.

'''Energy modeling''' or '''energy system modeling''' is the process of building computer models of [[energy system]]s in order to analyze them.  Such models often employ [[scenario analysis]] to investigate different assumptions about the technical and economic conditions at play.  Outputs may include the system feasibility, [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, cumulative [[Cost|financial costs]], [[natural resource]] use, and [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] of the system under investigation.  A wide range of techniques are employed, ranging from broadly economic to broadly engineering.  [[Mathematical optimization]] is often used to determine the least-cost in some sense.  Models can be international, regional, national, municipal, or stand-alone in scope.  Governments maintain national energy models for [[energy policy]] development.

Energy models are usually intended to contribute variously to system operations, [[Engineering design process|engineering design]], or [[energy policy]] development.  This page concentrates on policy models.  Individual [[building energy simulation]]s are explicitly excluded, although they too are sometimes called energy models.  [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]]-style [[integrated model]]s, which also contain a representation of the world energy system and are used to examine global transformation pathways through to 2050 or 2100 are not considered here in detail.

Energy modeling has increased in importance as the need for [[climate change mitigation]] has grown in importance.  The energy supply sector is the largest contributor to global [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.&lt;ref name="bruckner-etal-2014"&gt;

== Model types ==

A wide variety of model types are in use.  This section attempts to categorize the key types and their usage.  The divisions provided are not hard and fast and mixed-paradigm models exist.  In addition, the results from more general models can be used to inform the specification of more detailed models, and vice versa, thereby creating a [[hierarchy]] of models.  Models may, in general, need to capture "complex dynamics such as:
* energy system operation
* technology stock turnover
* technology innovation
* firm and household behaviour
* energy and non-energy capital investment and labour market adjustment dynamics leading to economic restructuring
* infrastructure deployment and urban planning"&lt;ref name="pye-and-bataille-2016"&gt;

Models may be limited in scope to the electricity sector or they may attempt to cover an energy system in its entirety (see below).

Most energy models are used for [[scenario analysis]].  A scenario is a coherent set of assumptions about a possible system.  New scenarios are tested against a baseline scenario – normally [[Business as usual (business)|business-as-usual]] (BAU) – and the differences in outcome noted.

The [[time horizon]] of the model is an important consideration.  Single-year models – set in either the present or the future (say 2050) – assume a non-evolving [[Capital (economics)|capital]] structure and focus instead on the operational dynamics of the system.  Single-year models normally embed considerable temporal (typically hourly resolution) and technical detail (such as individual generation plant and transmissions lines).  Long-range models – cast over one or more decades (from the present until say 2050) – attempt to encapsulate the structural evolution of the system and are used to investigate capacity expansion and energy system transition issues.

Models often use [[mathematical optimization]] to solve for redundancy in the specification of the system.  Some of the techniques used derive from [[operations research]].   Most rely on [[linear programming]] (including [[Linear programming#Integer unknowns|mixed-integer programming]]), although some use [[nonlinear programming]].  Solvers may use classical or [[Genetic programming|genetic optimisation]], such as [[CMA-ES]].  Models may be recursive-dynamic, solving sequentially for each time interval, and thus evolving through time.  Or they may be framed as a single forward-looking intertemporal problem, and thereby assume perfect foresight.  Single-year engineering-based models usually attempt to minimize the [[Long run and short run|short-run]] financial cost, while single-year market-based models use optimization to determine [[market clearing]].  Long-range models, usually spanning decades, attempt to minimize both the short and long-run costs as a single intertemporal problem.

The demand-side (or end-user domain) has historically received relatively scant attention, often modeled by just a simple [[demand curve]].  End-user energy demand curves, in the short-run at least, are normally found to be highly [[Elasticity (economics)|inelastic]].

As [[intermittent energy source]]s and [[energy demand management]] grow in importance, models have needed to adopt an hourly temporal resolution in order to better capture their real-time dynamics.&lt;ref name="acatech-etal-2016b"&gt;

=== Electricity sector models ===

Electricity sector models are used to model electricity systems.  The scope may be national or regional, depending on circumstances.  For instance, given the presence of national interconnectors, the western European electricity system may be modeled in its entirety.

Engineering-based models usually contain a good characterization of the technologies involved, including the high-voltage [[Alternating current|AC]] [[transmission grid]] where appropriate.  Some models (for instance, models for Germany) may assume a single common bus or "copper plate" where the grid is strong.  The demand-side in electricity sector models is typically represented by a fixed [[load profile]].

Market-based models, in addition, represent the prevailing [[electricity market]], which may include [[Electricity market#Bid-based, security-constrained, economic dispatch with nodal prices|nodal pricing]].

[[Game theory]] and [[agent-based model]]s are used to capture and study [[Perfect competition|strategic behavior]] within [[electricity market]]s.&lt;ref name="david-and-wen-2000"&gt;

=== Energy system models ===

In addition to the electricity sector, energy system models include the heat, gas, mobility, and other sectors as appropriate.&lt;ref name="abrell-and-weigt-2012"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Energy system models are often national in scope, but may be municipal or international.

So-called ''top-down models'' are broadly economic in nature and based on either [[partial equilibrium]] or [[Computable general equilibrium|general equilibrium]].  General equilibrium models represent a specialized activity and require dedicated [[algorithms]].  Partial equilibrium models are more common.

So-called ''bottom-up models'' capture the engineering well and often rely on techniques from [[operations research]].  Individual plants are characterized by their efficiency curves (also known as input/output relations), nameplate capacities, investment costs ([[Capital expenditure|capex]]), and operating costs ([[Operating expense|opex]]).  Some models allow for these parameters to depend on external conditions, such as ambient temperature.&lt;ref name="bruckner-etal-2003"&gt;

== Established models ==

This section lists some of the major models in use.  These are typically run by national governments.

=== LEAP ===

LEAP (Long range Energy Alternatives Planning System) is a software tool for [[energy policy]] analysis and [[climate change mitigation]] assessment.&lt;ref name="sei-2012"&gt;
{{cite book

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  LEAP was developed at the [[Stockholm Environment Institute]]'s (SEI) US Center.  LEAP can be used to examine city, statewide, national, and regional energy systems.  LEAP is normally used for forecast studies of between 20–50 years.  Most of its calculations occur at yearly intervals.  LEAP allows policy analysts to create and evaluate alternative [[Scenario analysis|scenarios]] and to compare their energy requirements, [[Social cost|social costs and benefits]], and environmental impacts.

=== Power System Simulation ===
[[General Electric]]'s MAPS (Multi-Area Production Simulation) is a production simulation model used by various [[Regional transmission organization (North America)|Regional Transmission Organizations]] and [[Regional transmission organization (North America)#Independent System Operators (ISOs)|Independent System Operators]] in the United States to plan for the economic impact of proposed electric transmission and generation facilities in FERC-regulated electric wholesale markets. Portions of the model may also be used for the commitment and dispatch phase (updated on 5 minute intervals) in operation of wholesale electric markets for RTO and ISO regions. [[ABB]]'s PROMOD is a similar software package. These ISO and RTO regions also utilize a GE software package called MARS (Multi-Area Reliability Simulation) to ensure the power system meets reliability criteria (a loss-of-load-expectation (LOLE) of no greater than 0.1 days per year). Further, a GE software package called PSLF (Positive Sequence Load Flow) and a [[Siemens]] software package called PSSE (Power System Simulation for Engineering) analyzes load flow on the power system for short-circuits and stability during preliminary planning studies by RTOs and ISOs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ABB PROMOD Market Simulation|url=https://new.abb.com/enterprise-software/energy-portfolio-management/market-analysis/promod|work=new.abb.com|accessdate=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GE Multi-Area Production Simulation|url=https://www.geenergyconsulting.com/practice-area/software-products/maps|work=www.geenergyconsulting.com|accessdate=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GE Multi-Area Reliability Simulation|url=https://www.geenergyconsulting.com/practice-area/software-products/mars|work=www.geenergyconsulting.com|accessdate=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GE Power System Load Flow Simulation|url=https://www.geenergyconsulting.com/practice-area/software-products/pslf|work=www.geenergyconsulting.com|accessdate=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NYSRC 2018 IRM Study Report|url=http://www.nysrc.org/pdf/Reports/2018%20IRM%20Study%20Report%20Final%2012-8-17[2098].pdf|p=2|work=www.nysrc.org|date=December 8, 2017|accessdate=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NYISO Notice to Stakeholders of Request for MAPS data|url=https://www.nyiso.com/public/webdocs/markets_operations/documents/Legal_and_Regulatory/Notices/MP_Notices/Notice%20to%20Generators%20re%20GE%20MAPS%20database%20input%20files%20for%20CARIS%202%20-%209-9-14.pdf|work=www.nyiso.com|date=August 2000|accessdate=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Siemens PSSE|url=https://www.siemens.com/global/en/home/products/energy/services/transmission-distribution-smart-grid/consulting-and-planning/pss-software/pss-e.html|work=www.siemens.com|accessdate=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New York State Resource Planning Analysis (NYSPSC)|url=https://www.nyiso.com/public/webdocs/markets_operations/committees/mc/meeting_materials/2015-12-17/Agenda%2004_NYSDPS%20SRP%20Presentation_revised.pdf|work=www.nyiso.com|date=December 17, 2015|accessdate=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== MARKAL/TIMES ===

{{main|MARKAL}}

MARKAL (MARKet ALlocation) is an integrated energy systems modeling platform, used to analyze energy, economic, and environmental issues at the global, national, and municipal level over time-frames of up to several decades.  MARKAL can be used to quantify the impacts of policy options on technology development and natural resource depletion.  The software was developed by the Energy Technology Systems Analysis Programme (ETSAP) of the [[International Energy Agency]] (IEA) over a period of almost two decades.

TIMES (The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System) is an evolution of MARKAL – both energy models have many similarities.&lt;ref name="comparison-times-markal-2009"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Both models are technology explicit, dynamic [[partial equilibrium]] models of [[energy market]]s. In both cases, the equilibrium is determined by maximizing the total [[Economic surplus|consumer and producer surplus]] via [[linear programming]].  Both MARKAL and TIMES are written in [[General Algebraic Modeling System|GAMS]].

The TIMES model generator was also developed under the Energy Technology Systems Analysis Program (ETSAP).  TIMES combines two different, but complementary, systematic approaches to modeling energy – a technical engineering approach and an economic approach.  TIMES is a technology rich, bottom-up model generator, which uses [[linear programming]] to produce a least-cost energy system, optimized according to a number of user-specified constraints, over the medium to long-term.  It is used for "the exploration of possible energy futures based on contrasted scenarios".&lt;ref name="loulou-etal-2005"&gt;

=== NEMS ===

{{main|National Energy Modeling System}}

[[National Energy Modeling System|NEMS]] (National Energy Modeling System) is a long-standing United States government policy model, run by the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] (DOE).

To do so, the software iteratively solves a sequence of linear programs and nonlinear equations.&lt;ref name="gabriel-etal-1999"&gt;

'''Energy technology''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] [[engineering]] [[science]] having to do with the efficient, safe, [[environmentally friendly]] and economical extraction, conversion, transportation, storage and use of [[energy]], targeted towards yielding high efficiency whilst skirting [[adverse effect|side effects]] on humans, nature and the environment.

For people, energy is an overwhelming need and as a scarce [[resource]] it has been an underlying cause of political conflicts and wars. The gathering and use of energy resources can be harmful to local ecosystems and may have global outcomes.

==Interdisciplinary fields==
As an interdisciplinary science Energy technology is linked with many interdisciplinary fields in sundry, overlapping ways.

* [[Physics]], for [[thermodynamics]] and [[nuclear physics]]
* [[Chemistry]] for [[fuel]], [[combustion]], [[air pollution]], [[flue gas]], [[battery (electricity)|battery]] technology and [[fuel cells]].
* [[Electrical engineering]]
* [[Engineering]], often for fluid energy machines such as [[combustion engines]], turbines, pumps and [[compressors]].
* [[Geography]], for [[geothermal]] energy and exploration for resources.
* [[Mining]], for [[petrochemical]] and [[fossil fuels]].
* [[Agriculture]] and [[forestry]], for sources of renewable energy.
* [[Meteorology]] for [[wind]] and [[solar energy]].
* [[Water]] and [[Waterways]], for [[hydropower]].
* [[Waste management]], for environmental impact.
* [[Transportation]], for energy-saving transportation systems.
* [[Environmental studies]], for studying the effect of energy use and production on the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]], [[nature]] and [[climate change]].
* (Lighting Technology), for Interior and Exterior Natural as well as Artificial Lighting Design, Installations, and Energy Savings
* (Energy Cost/Benefit Analysis), for Simple Payback and Life Cycle Costing of Energy Efficiency/Conservation Measures Recommended

==Electrical engineering==
[[Image:Qatar, power lines (6).jpg|thumb|High-voltage lines for the long distance transportation of electrical energy]]

[[Electric power engineering]] deals with the production and use of [[electrical energy]], which can entail the study of machines such as [[Electrical generator|generators]], [[electric motor]]s and [[transformer]]s. [[Infrastructure]] involves [[Electrical substation|substations]] and [[transformer station]]s, [[power line]]s and [[Power cable|electrical cable]]. [[Load management]] and [[power management]] over networks have meaningful sway on overall energy efficiency. [[Electric heating]] is also widely used and researched.

==Thermodynamics==
{{Main article|Thermodynamics}}

[[Thermodynamics]] deals with the fundamental laws of energy conversion and is drawn from theoretical [[Physics]].

==Thermal and chemical energy==
[[Image:Wood-fired grate stoker.jpg|thumb|left|A [[wikt:grate|grate]] for a wood fire]]
Thermal and chemical energy are intertwined with [[chemistry]] and [[environmental studies]]. [[Combustion]] has to do with [[Gas burner|burner]]s and chemical [[engine]]s of all kinds, grates and [[incinerator]]s along with their energy efficiency, [[pollution]] and operational safety.

[[Exhaust gas]] purification technology aims to lessen [[air pollution]] through sundry mechanical, thermal and chemical cleaning methods. [[Emission control (disambiguation)|Emission control]] technology is a field of [[process engineering|process]] and [[chemical engineering]]. [[Boiler]] technology deals with the design, construction and operation of [[steam]] boilers and [[steam turbine|turbine]]s (also used in nuclear power generation, see below), drawn from [[applied mechanics]] and [[materials engineering]].

[[Energy conversion]] has to do with internal combustion engines, turbines, pumps, fans and so on, which are used for transportation, mechanical energy and power generation. High thermal and mechanical loads bring about operational safety worries which are dealt with through many branches of applied engineering science.
{{Clear}}

==Nuclear energy==
[[Image:Turbogenerator01.jpg|thumb|A [[steam turbine]].]]
[[Nuclear technology]] deals with [[nuclear power]] production from [[nuclear reactor]]s, along with the processing of nuclear fuel and disposal of radioactive waste, drawing from applied [[nuclear physics]], [[nuclear chemistry]] and [[radiation]] science.

Nuclear power generation has been politically controversial in many countries for several decades but the electrical energy produced through [[nuclear fission]] is of worldwide importance. There are high hopes that [[Fusion power|fusion]] technologies will one day replace most fission reactors but this is still a research area of [[nuclear physics]].

==Renewable energy==
{{Main article|Renewable energy}}
[[Image:Nellis AFB Solar panels.jpg|thumb|Solar ([[photovoltaic]]) panels at a military base in the US.]]
[[Renewable energy]] has many branches.

===Solar power===
{{Main article|Solar power}}

* [[Photovoltaic]] power draws electricity from solar radiation through [[solar cells]], either locally or in large photovoltaic power plants and uses [[semiconductor]] technology.
* [[Solar heating]] uses [[solar panel]]s which gather heat from sunlight to heat buildings and water.
* [[Solar thermal power]] produces electricity by converting solar heat.

===Wind power===
[[Image:WindMills.jpg|right|thumb|[[Wind turbine]]s on [[Inner Mongolia]]n grassland]]
{{Main article|Wind power}}

[[Wind turbine]]s draw energy from atmospheric currents and are designed using [[aerodynamics]] along with knowledge taken from mechanical and electrical engineering.

===Geothermal===
{{Main article|Geothermal}}

Where it can be had, [[geothermal]] energy is used for heating and electricity.

===Hydropower===
[[Image:Walchenseewerk Pelton 120.jpg|thumb|Building of [[Pelton turbine|Pelton water turbine]]s in [[Germany]].]]
{{Main article|Hydropower}}

Hydropower draws mechanical energy from rivers, [[wave power plant|ocean waves]] and [[tidal power|tides]]. [[Civil engineering]] is used to study and build [[dam]]s, [[tunnel]]s, [[waterways]] and manage coastal resources through [[hydrology]] and [[geology]]. A low speed [[water turbine]] spun by flowing water can power an [[electrical generator]] to produce electricity.

===Bioenergy===
{{Main article|Bioenergy}}
Bioenergy deals with the gathering, processing and use of biomasses grown in biological manufacturing, [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]] from which [[power plant]]s can draw burning fuel. [[Ethanol]], [[methanol]] (both controversial) or hydrogen for [[fuel cells]] can be had from these technologies and used to generate electricity.

===Enabling technologies===

[[Heat pumps]] and [[Thermal energy storage]] are classes of technologies that can enable the utilization of renewable energy sources that would otherwise be inaccessible due to a temperature that is too low for utilization or a time lag between when the energy is available and when it is needed. While enhancing the temperature of available renewable thermal energy, heat pumps have the additional property of leveraging electrical power (or in some cases mechanical or thermal power) by using it to extract additional energy from a low quality source (such as seawater, lake water, the ground, the air, or [[waste heat]] from a process).

Thermal storage technologies allow heat or cold to be stored for periods of time ranging from hours or overnight to [[Seasonal thermal energy storage|interseasonal]], and can involve storage of [[Sensible heat|sensible energy]] (i.e. by changing the temperature of a medium) or [[latent energy]] (i.e. through phase changes of a medium, such between water and slush or ice). Short-term thermal storages can be used for peak-shaving in district heating or electrical distribution systems. Kinds of renewable or alternative energy sources that can be enabled include natural energy (e.g. collected via solar-thermal collectors, or dry cooling towers used to collect winter's cold), waste energy (e.g. from HVAC equipment, industrial processes or power plants), or surplus energy (e.g. as seasonally from hyropower projects or intermittently from wind farms). The [[Drake Landing Solar Community]] (Alberta, Canada) is illustrative. [[Seasonal thermal energy storage|borehole thermal energy storage]] allows the community to get 97% of its year-round heat from solar collectors on the garage roofs, which most of the heat collected in summer.&lt;ref&gt;Wong, Bill (June 28, 2011), [http://www.districtenergy.org/assets/pdfs/2011Annual_Conf/Proceedings/A24WONG-v03.pdf "Drake Landing Solar Community"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030520/http://www.districtenergy.org/assets/pdfs/2011Annual_Conf/Proceedings/A24WONG-v03.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}, IDEA/CDEA District Energy/CHP 2011 Conference, Toronto, pp. 1–30, retrieved 21 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wong B., Thornton J.

Some types of storage are capable of storing heat or cold [[Seasonal thermal energy storage|between opposing seasons]] (particularly if very large), and some storage applications require inclusion of a [[Heat pumps|heat pump]]. Latent heat is typically stored in ice tanks or what are called [[phase-change material]]s (PCMs).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21002">'''Ethnoscience''' has been defined as an attempt "to reconstitute what serves as science for others, their practices of looking after themselves and their bodies, their botanical knowledge, but also their forms of classification, of making connections, etc." (Augé, 1999: 118).

==Origins==
Ethnoscience has not always focused on ideas distinct from those of "[[cognitive anthropology]]", "component analysis", or "the New Ethnography"; it is a specialization of [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] knowledge-systems, such as ethno-botany, ethno-zoology, ethno-medicine, etc. (Atran, 1991: 595). According to [[Scott Atran]], ethnoscience looks at culture with a scientific perspective (1991: 650), although most{{quantify|date=November 2017}} anthropologists abhor this definition. Ethnoscience helps to understand how people develop with different forms of knowledge and beliefs, and focuses on the ecological and historical contributions people have been given (Atran, 1991: 650){{by whom|date=November 2017}}. [[Tim Ingold]] describes ethnoscience as a cross-discipline (2000: 160). He writes that ethnoscience is based on increased collaboration between [[social sciences]] and the [[humanities]] (e.g., [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], and [[philosophy]]) with [[natural sciences]] such as [[biology]], [[ecology]], or [[medicine]] (Ingold, 2000: 406-7). At the same time, ethnoscience is increasingly transdisciplinary in its nature (Ingold, 2000: 407).

Of course, naturally over time, the ways in which data has been collected and studied has changed and the field has evolved, becoming more detailed and specific (Urry, 1972: 45).{{qn|date=November 2017}} The ideas, mechanics, and methods of ethnoscience evolved from something else - a combination of several things. This pretext amalgamation{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} of theories, processes, and –isms led to the evolution of today's ethnoscience.

==Early approaches==
Early on, [[Franz Boas]] established [[cultural relativism]] as an approach to understanding indigenous scientific practices (Uddin, 2005: 980). Cultural relativism identifies people's differences and shows how they are a result of the social, historical, and geographical conditions (Uddin, 2005: 980). Boas is known for his work in Northern [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, Canada, working with the [[Kwakwaka'wakw]] Indians, which is where he established the importance of culture (Uddin, 2005: 980). [[Lévi-Strauss]]' [[structuralism]] was a strong contributor to the ideas of ethnoscience (Uddin, 2005: 980). It, itself, was the leading idea of providing structure to the research and a guide to organizing and relating different cultures. "Ethnoscience refers to a 'reduction of chaos' achieved by a particular culture, rather than to the 'highest possible and conscious degree' to which such chaos may be reduced;" basically, the ethnoscience of a society creates its culture (Sturtevant, 1964: 100). Much of the influence of anthropology, e.g., [[geographical determinism]], was through the contributions of [[Jean Bodin]] (Harris, 1968: 42). In his text, he tried to explain why "northern people were faithful, loyal to the government, cruel, and sexually uninterested, compared to why southern people were malicious, craft, wise, expert in science but ill-adapted to political activity (Harris, 1968: 52)." The Greek historian, [[Polybius]], asserted "we mortals have an irresistible tendency to yield to climatic influences; and to this cause, and no other, may be traced the great distinctions that prevail among us in character, physical formation, complexion, as well as in most of our habits…" (quoted in Harris, 1968: 41).

Another aspect of anthropology prior to ethnoscience is [[enculturation]]. Newton and Newton described enculturation as a process whereby the novice, or "outsider", learns what is important to the "insider" (1998). [[Marvin Harris]] writes, "One of [enculturation's] most important technical expressions is the doctrine of 'psychic unity,' the belief that in the study of sociocultural differences, hereditary (genetic) differences cancel each other out, leaving 'experience' as the most significant variable" (Harris, 1968: 15). This is one of the many starts of people opening up to the idea that just because people are different, doesn't mean they are wrong in their thinking. Harris describes how religious beliefs hinder and affect the progress of anthropology and [[ethnography]]. The moral beliefs and restrictions of religion fought against anthropological ideas, possibly due to (especially at the time) to the newly hyped idea of [[evolutionism]] and [[Darwinism]] (Harris, 1968).

[[Bronislaw Malinowski]] was one of many who contributed heavily to the precursor of ethnoscience. His earlier work brought attention to [[sociological]] studies; his earliest publication focused on a family in [[Australia]], using a sociological study perspective (Harris, 1968: 547). After the [[First World War]], anthropological work was at a stand still; nothing had evolved, if not regressed (Urry, 1972: 54). This allowed him to start from scratch, and rebuild his ideas and methods (Harris, 1968: 547).

Later, however, Malinowski branched out to political evolution during [[World War II]]. The period after World War II is what led to ethnoscience; anthropologists learned their skills could be applied to problems that were affecting modern societies (Mead, 1973: 1). Malinowski said "… with his tables of [[kinship terms]], [[genealogies]], maps, plans and diagrams, proves an extensive and big organization, shows the contribution of the tribe, of the clan, of the family, and he gives a picture of the natives subjected to a strict code of behavior and good manners, to which in comparison the life at the [[Court of Versailles]] or [[Escurial]] was free and easy" (1922: 10). After World War II, there was an extreme amount of growth in the anthropological field, not only with research opportunities but academically, as well (Mead, 1973: 2).

The anthropologist [[Robin W.G. Horton|Robin Horton]], who taught at several Nigerian universities, considered the traditional knowledge of indigenous peoples as incorporated within conceptual world views that bear certain similarities to, and differences from, the modern scientific worldview.  Like modern science, traditional thought provides a theoretical structure that "places things in a causal order wider than that provided by common sense" (Horton, 1967, p.&amp;nbsp;53).  In contrast to modern science, he saw traditional thought as having a limited awareness of theoretical alternatives and, consequently, displaying "an absolute acceptance of the established theoretical tenets" (Horton, 1967, pp.&amp;nbsp;155–6).

There are dozens, if not hundreds, of related methods and processes that preceded ethnoscience. Ethnoscience is just another way to study the human culture and the way people interact in society. Taking a look at the ideas and analyses prior to ethnoscience can help understand why it was developed in the first place. Although, it is not widely used and there is criticism on both ends, ethnoscience allows for a more comprehensive way to collect data and patterns of a people. This is not to say the process is its best or that there will be nothing better. That is the best part: everything evolves, even thought. Just as the ideas did in the past, they can improve over time and regress over time but change is inevitable.

==Development==

Ethnoscience is a new term and study that came into anthropological theory in the 1960s. Often referred to as "indigenous knowledge", ethnoscience introduces a perspective based on native perceptions. It is based on a complete emic perspective, which excludes all observations, interpretations and or any personal notions belonging to the ethnographer. The taxonomy and classification of indigenous systems, to name a few, used to categorize plants, animals, religion and life is adapted from a linguistic analysis. The concept of "Native Science" is also related to the understanding the role of the environment intertwined with the meaning humans place upon their lives. Understanding the language and the native people's linguistic system is one method to understand a native people's system of knowledge of organization. Not only is there categorization for things pertaining to nature and culture thought language, but more importantly and complex is the relationship between environment and culture. Ethnoscience looks at the intricacies of the connection between culture and its surrounding environment. There are also potential limitations and shortcomings in interpreting these systems of knowledge as a dictation of culture and behavior.

Since an ethnographer is not able to physically enter inside an indigenous person's mind, it is essential to not only create a setting or question-answer format to understand perspective but to analyze semantics and word order of given answer to derive an emic understanding. The main focus on a particular component of the languages is placed on its [[lexicon]]. The terms "[[etic]]" and "[[emic]]" are derived from the [[linguistics|linguistic]] terms of "[[phonetic]]" and "[[phonemic]]".

As introduced by [[Gregory Cajete]], some limitations the concept of indigenous knowledge, is the potential to bypass non-indigenous knowledge as pertinent and valuable. The labels of "indigenous" are overly accepted by those who seek more support by outsiders to further their cause. There might also be an unequal distribution of knowledge amongst a tribe or peoples. There is also the idea that culture is bound by environment. Some theorists conclude that indigenous people's culture is not operated by mental concentrations but solely by the earth that surrounds them. Some theorists go the extent to state that biological processes are based upon the availability, of lack thereof, environmental resources. The methods for sustainability are founded through the workings of the land. These techniques are exercised from the basis of tradition. The importance of the combination of ecological process, social structures, environmental ethics and spiritual ecology are crucial to the expression of the true connection between the natural world and "ecological consciousness".

The origin of Ethnoscience began between the years 1960 to 1965; deriving from the concept of "ethno- + science". Ethno- a combining form meaning "race", "culture", "people", used in the formation of compound words: ethnography. The two concepts later emerged into "ethno-science". The origin of the word 'science' involves the empiric observation of measurable quantities and the testing of hypotheses to falsify or support them. 
"Ethnoscience refers to the system of knowledge and cognition typical of a given culture...to put it another way a culture itself amounts to the sum of a given society's folk classifications, all of that society's ethnoscience, its particular ways of classifying its material and social universe" (Sturtevant 1964: 99–100). The aim of ethnoscience is to gain a more complete description of cultural knowledge. Ethnoscience has been successfully used on several studies of given cultures relating to their linguistics, folk taxonomy, and how they classify their foods, animals and plants.

===Ethnolinguistics===

Ethnoscience is the examination of the perceptions, knowledge, and classifications of the world as reflected in their use of language, which can help anthropologists understand a given culture. By using an ethnographic approach to studying a culture and learning their lexicon and syntax they are able to gain more knowledge in understanding how a particular culture classifies its material and social universe. In addition, this approach "adopted provides simultaneously a point at which the discipline of linguistics, or at least some of its general attitudes, may sensibly be used in anthropology and as a means of gaining insight not only into the nature of man but also into the nature of culture" (Videbeck and Pia, 1966).

Researchers can use linguistics to study what a given culture considers important in a given situation or unforeseen event, and can rank those potential situations in terms of their likelihood to recur. In addition, "understanding the contingencies is helpful in the task of comprehending folk taxonomies on the one hand, and, on the other, an understanding of the taxonomy is required for a full scale appreciation of criteria considered relevant in a given culture (Videbeck and Pia, 1966).

===Taxonomy and classification===

Ethnoscience can be used to analyze the kinship terminology of a given culture, using their language and according to how they view members of their society. Taxonomies "are models of analysis whose purpose is the description of particular types of hierarchical relationships between members of a given set of elements" (Perchonock and [[Oswald Werner|Werner]], 1969). For example, in our society we classify family groups by giving members the title of father, mother, sister, daughter, brother, son, grandfather, grandmother, etc.

===System of classification – among cultures===

Ethnoscience deals with how a given culture classifies certain principles in addition to how it is express through their language. By understanding a given culture through how they view the world, anthropologists attempt to eliminate any bias through translation as well as categorized their principles in their own ways. "The new methods, which focus on the discovery and description of folk systems, have come to be known as Ethnoscience. Ethnoscience analysis has thus far concentrated on systems of classification within such cultural and linguistic domains as colors, plants, and medicines" (Perchonock and [[Oswald Werner|Werner]], 1969). An ethnoscientific approach can be used to better understand a given culture and their knowledge of their culture. Using an ethnographic approach can help anthropologists understand how that given culture views and categorizes their own foods, animal kingdom, medicines, as well as plants.

===Contemporary research===
Ethnoscience can be effectively summed up as a classification system for a particular culture in the same way that a botanist would use a taxonomic system for the classification of plant species. Everything from class levels, food consumption, clothing, and material culture objects would be subjected to a taxonomic classification system. In essence, ethnoscience is a way of classifying cultural systems in a structured order to better understand the culture.
The roots of ethnoscience can be traced back to influential anthropologists such as [[Franz Boas]], [[Bronislaw Malinowski]], and [[Benjamin Whorf]] who attempted to understand other cultures from an insider's perspective. [[Ward Goodenough]] is accredited for bringing ethnoscience to the stage when he define cultural systems of knowledge by stating:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''"A societies culture consists of whatever it is one has to know or believe in order to operate in a manner acceptable to its members. Culture is not a material phenomenon; it does not consist of things, behavior, or emotions. It is rather an organization of these things. It is the form of things that people have in mind, their models for perceiving, relating, and otherwise interpreting them."
'' (Goodenough 1957:167)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In order to properly put ethnoscience in context we must first understand the definition of ethnoscience. it is defined as "an attempt at cultural description from a totally emic perspective (a perspective in ethnography that uses the concepts and categories that are relevant and meaningful to the culture that is insider analysis) standpoint, this eliminating all of the ethnographer's own categories" (Morey and Luthans 27). Ethnoscience is also a way of learning and understanding how an individual or group perceive their environment and how they fit in with their environment as reflected in their own words and actions.

Ethnoscience has many techniques when applied to an emic perspective. Ethnosemantics, ethnographic semantics, ethnographic ethnoscience, formal analysis, and componential analysis are the terms that apply to the practice of ethnoscience. Ethnosemantics looks at the meaning of words in order to place them in context of the culture being studied. It allows for taxonomy of a certain part of the culture being looked at so that there is a clear breakdown which in turn leads to a deeper understanding of the subject at hand. Ethnographic semantics are very similar to cognitive anthropology in that its primary focus is the intellectual and rational perspectives of the culture being studied. Ethnographic semantics specifically looks at how language is used throughout the culture. Lastly, ethnographic ethnoscience is related to ethnosemantics such that, it uses a taxonomic system to understand how cultural knowledge is accessible through language. Ethnographic ethnoscience uses similar classification systems for cultural domains like ethnobotany and ethnoanatomy. Again, ethnoscience is a way of understanding a how a culture sees itself through its own language. Understanding the cultural language allows the ethnographer to have a deeper and more intimate understanding of the culture.

[[File:Genes hox.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.8|[[Homology (biology)|Homologous]] [[hox gene|''hox'' genes]] in such different animals as [[insect]]s and [[vertebrate]]s control [[embryogenesis|embryonic development]] and hence the [[Morphology (biology)|form]] of adult bodies. These genes have been [[conserved sequence|highly conserved]] through hundreds of millions of years of [[evolution]].]]

'''Evolutionary developmental biology''' (informally, '''evo-devo''') is a field of [[biological research]] that compares the [[developmental biology|developmental processes]] of different [[organism]]s to [[inference|infer]] the [[phylogeny|ancestral relationships]] between them and how developmental processes [[evolution|evolved]].

The field grew from 19th-century beginnings, where [[embryology]] faced a mystery: [[zoology|zoologists]] did not know how [[embryogenesis|embryonic development]] was controlled at the [[molecular genetics|molecular level]]. [[Charles Darwin]] noted that having similar embryos implied common ancestry, but little progress was made until the 1970s. Then, [[recombinant DNA]] technology at last brought embryology together with [[molecular genetics]]. A key early discovery was of [[homeotic gene]]s that regulate development in a wide range of [[eukaryote]]s.

The field is characterised by some key concepts, which took [[evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologists]] by surprise. One is [[deep homology]], the finding that dissimilar organs such as the eyes of [[insect]]s, [[vertebrate]]s and [[cephalopod]] molluscs, long thought to have evolved separately, are controlled by similar genes such as ''[[pax-6]]'', from the [[evo-devo gene toolkit]]. These genes are ancient, being [[conserved sequence|highly conserved]] among [[Phylum|phyla]]; they generate the patterns in time and space which shape the embryo, and ultimately form the [[body plan]] of the organism. Another is that species do not differ much in their structural genes, such as those coding for [[enzyme]]s; what does differ is the way that [[regulation of gene expression|gene expression is regulated]] by the toolkit genes. These genes are reused, unchanged, many times in different parts of the embryo and at different stages of development, forming a complex cascade of control, switching other regulatory genes as well as structural genes on and off in a precise pattern. This multiple [[pleiotropy|pleiotropic]] reuse explains why these genes are highly conserved, as any change would have many adverse consequences which [[natural selection]] would oppose.

New [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] features and ultimately new species are produced by variations in the toolkit, either when genes are expressed in a new pattern, or when toolkit genes acquire additional functions. Another possibility is the [[Neo-Lamarckism|Neo-Lamarckian]] theory that [[epigenetics|epigenetic changes]] are later [[genetic assimilation|consolidated at gene level]], something that may have been important early in the history of multicellular life.

{{further|History of evolutionary thought}}

===Recapitulation===
{{main|Recapitulation theory}}

A [[recapitulation theory]] of evolutionary development was proposed by [[Étienne Serres]] in 1824–26, echoing the 1808 ideas of [[Johann Friedrich Meckel]]. They argued that the embryos of 'higher' animals went through or recapitulated a series of stages, each of which resembled an animal lower down the [[great chain of being]]. For example, the brain of a human embryo looked first like that of a [[fish]], then in turn like that of a [[reptile]], [[bird]], and [[mammal]] before becoming clearly [[human]]. The embryologist [[Karl Ernst von Baer]] opposed this, arguing in 1828 that there was no linear sequence as in the great chain of being, based on a single [[body plan]], but a process of [[epigenesis (biology)|epigenesis]] in which structures differentiate. Von Baer instead recognised four distinct animal [[body plan]]s: radiate, like [[starfish]]; molluscan, like [[clam]]s; articulate, like [[lobster]]s; and vertebrate, like fish. Zoologists then largely abandoned recapitulation, though [[Ernst Haeckel]] revived it in 1866.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=O'Connell |first1=Lindsey |title=The Meckel-Serres Conception of Recapitulation |url=https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/meckel-serres-conception-recapitulation |website=The Embryo Project Encyclopedia |accessdate=10 October 2016 |date=10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Desmond |first=Adrian J. |authorlink=Adrian Desmond |title=The politics of evolution: morphology, medicine, and reform in radical London |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |year=1989 |isbn=0-226-14374-0 |pages=53–53, 86–88, 337–340, 490–491}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Secord|2003|loc=p. 252–253}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowler |first=Peter J. |title=Evolution: the history of an idea |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |year=2003  |isbn=0-520-23693-9 |pages=120–128, 190–191, 208}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Secord|2003|loc=p. 424, 512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary morphology===
[[File:Comparison of Three Invertebrate Chordates.svg|thumb|A. [[Lancelet]] (a chordate), B. Larval [[tunicate]], C. Adult tunicate. [[Alexander Kovalevsky|Kowalevsky]] saw that the [[notochord]] (1) and gill slit (5) are shared by tunicates and vertebrates.]]
{{further|Morphology (biology)|Body plan}}

From the early 19th century through most of the 20th century, [[embryology]] faced a mystery. Animals were seen to develop into adults of widely differing [[body plan]], often through similar stages, from the egg, but zoologists knew almost nothing about how  [[embryogenesis|embryonic development]] was controlled at the [[molecular biology|molecular level]], and therefore equally little about how [[developmental biology|developmental processes]] had evolved.&lt;ref name=CarrollNatHist&gt;{{cite web |last1=Carroll |first1=Sean B. |title=The Origins of Form |url=http://www.naturalhistorymag.com/features/061488/the-origins-of-form |website=Natural History |accessdate=9 October 2016 |quote=Biologists could say, with confidence, that forms change, and that natural selection is an important force for change. Yet they could say nothing about how that change is accomplished. How bodies or body parts change, or how new structures arise, remained complete mysteries.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Darwin]] argued that a shared embryonic structure implied a common ancestor. As an example of this, Darwin cited in his 1859 book ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' the [[shrimp]]-like [[larva]] of the [[barnacle]], whose [[Sessility (motility)|sessile]] adults looked nothing like other [[arthropods]]; [[Linnaeus]] and [[Cuvier]] had classified them as [[mollusc]]s.&lt;ref name=Gilbert2003&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gilbert |first1=Scott F. |title=The morphogenesis of evolutionary developmental biology |journal=International Journal of Developmental Biology |date=2003 |volume=47 |pages=467–477 |url=http://www.chd.ucsd.edu/_files/fall2008/Gilbert.2003.IJDB.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Darwin |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles Darwin | title=On the Origin of Species| isbn=0-8014-1319-2 |publisher=John Murray |location=London |year=1859| url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F373&amp;pageseq=457 |pages=439–440 |quote=Cirripedes afford a good instance of this: even the illustrious Cuvier did not perceive that a barnacle was, as it certainly is, a crustacean; but a glance at the larva shows this to be the case in an unmistakeable manner.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin also noted [[Alexander Kovalevsky|Alexander Kowalevsky]]'s finding that the [[tunicate]], too, was not a mollusc, but in its larval stage had a [[notochord]] and pharyngeal slits which developed from the same germ layers as the equivalent structures in [[vertebrate]]s, and should therefore be grouped with them as [[chordates]].&lt;ref name=Gilbert2003/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Richmond | first=Marsha | title=Darwin's Study of the Cirripedia | url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Richmond_cirripedia.html | publisher=Darwin Online | date=January 2007 | accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 19th century zoology thus converted [[embryology]] into an evolutionary science, connecting [[phylogeny]] with [[homology (biology)|homologies]] between the germ layers of embryos. Zoologists including [[Fritz Müller]] proposed the use of embryology to discover [[phylogeny|phylogenetic relationships]] between taxa. Müller demonstrated that [[crustaceans]] shared the [[Crustacean larvae#Nauplius|Nauplius]] larva, identifying several parasitic species that had not been recognised as crustaceans. Müller also recognised that [[natural selection]] must act on larvae, just as it does on adults, giving the lie to recapitulation, which would require larval forms to be shielded from natural selection.&lt;ref name=Gilbert2003/&gt; Two of Haeckel's other ideas about the evolution of development have fared better than recapitulation: he argued in the 1870s that changes in the timing ([[heterochrony]]) and changes in the positioning within the body ([[heterotopy]]) of aspects of embryonic development would drive evolution by changing the shape of a descendant's body compared to an ancestor's. It took a century before these ideas were shown to be correct.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hall |first1=B.

But for the next century, without molecular evidence, progress stalled.&lt;ref name=Gilbert2003/&gt;

===The modern synthesis of the early 20th century===
{{main|Modern synthesis (20th century)}}

In the so-called [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] of the early 20th century, [[Ronald Fisher]] brought together Darwin's theory of [[evolution]], with its insistence on natural selection, [[heredity]], and [[genotype|variation]], and [[Gregor Mendel]]'s [[Mendelian inheritance|laws of genetics]] into a coherent structure for [[evolutionary biology]]. Biologists assumed that an organism was a straightforward reflection of its component genes: the genes coded for proteins, which built the organism's body. Biochemical pathways (and, they supposed, new species) evolved through [[mutation]]s in these genes. It was a simple, clear and nearly comprehensive picture: but it did not explain embryology.&lt;ref name=Gilbert2003/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bock |first=Walter J. |date=July 1981 |title=Reviewed Work: ''The Evolutionary Synthesis. Perspectives on the Unification of Biology'' |journal=[[The Auk]] |location=McLean, VA |publisher=[[American Ornithologists' Union]] |volume=98 |issue=3 |pages=644–646 |issn=0004-8038 |jstor=4086148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evolutionary embryologist [[Gavin de Beer]] anticipated evolutionary developmental biology in his 1930 book ''[[Embryos and Ancestors]]'',&lt;ref name="Held"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Held |first1=Lewis I. |author1link=Lewis I. Held |title=[[How the Snake Lost its Legs]]. Curious Tales from the Frontier of Evo-Devo |date=2014 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-1-107-62139-8 |page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; by showing that evolution could occur by [[heterochrony]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gould|1977|pp=221–222}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as in [[paedomorphosis|the retention of juvenile features in the adult]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; This, de Beer argued, could cause apparently sudden changes in the [[fossil record]], since embryos fossilise poorly. As the gaps in the fossil record had been used as an argument against Darwin's gradualist evolution, de Beer's explanation supported the Darwinian position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Ingo Brigandt |year=2006 |title=Homology and heterochrony: the evolutionary embryologist Gavin Rylands de Beer (1899-1972) |journal=[[Journal of Experimental Zoology]] |volume=306B |issue=4 |pages=317–328 |doi=10.1002/jez.b.21100 |url=https://www.ualberta.ca/~brigandt/de_Beer.pdf |pmid=16506229}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite de Beer, the modern synthesis largely ignored embryonic development to explain the form of organisms, since population genetics appeared to be an adequate explanation of how forms evolved.&lt;ref name=Gilbert1991&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gilbert, S.

{{main|Lac operon}}

In 1961, [[Jacques Monod]], [[Jean-Pierre Changeux]] and [[François Jacob]] discovered the [[lac operon]] in the [[bacterium]] ''[[Escherichia coli]]''. It was a cluster of [[gene]]s, arranged in a feedback [[control loop]] so that its products would only be made when "switched on" by an environmental stimulus. One of these products was [[β-galactosidase|an enzyme that splits a sugar]], lactose; and [[lactose]] itself was the stimulus that switched the genes on. This was a revelation, as it showed for the first time that genes, even in an organism as small as a bacterium, were subject to fine-grained control. The implication was that many other genes were also elaborately regulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Monod | first1=Jacques | author1link=Jacques Monod | last2=Changeux | first2=J.P. | last3=Jacob | first3=François | author3link=François Jacob | year=1963 | title=Allosteric proteins and cellular control systems |journal=Journal of Molecular Biology | volume=6 | issue=4 | pages=306–329 | doi=10.1016/S0022-2836(63)80091-1 | pmid=13936070 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The birth of evo-devo and a second synthesis===
In 1977, a revolution in thinking about evolution and developmental biology began, with the arrival of [[recombinant DNA]] technology in [[genetics]], and the papers ''Ontogeny and Phylogeny'' by [[Stephen J. Gould]] and ''Evolution by Tinkering'' by [[François Jacob]]. Gould laid to rest Haeckel's interpretation of evolutionary embryology, while Jacob set out an alternative theory.&lt;ref name=Gilbert2003/&gt;

==The control of body structure==
===Deep homology===
{{further|Deep homology}}

Roughly spherical eggs of different animals give rise to extremely different bodies, from jellyfish to lobsters, butterflies to elephants. Many of these organisms share the same structural genes for body{{hyp}}building&lt;!--nothing to do with steroids and gyms--&gt; proteins like collagen and enzymes, but biologists had expected that each group of animals would have its own rules of development. The surprise of evo-devo is that the shaping of bodies is controlled by a rather small percentage of genes, and that these regulatory genes are ancient, shared by all animals. The [[giraffe]] does not have a gene for a long neck, any more than the [[elephant]] has a gene for a big body. Their bodies are patterned by a system of switching which causes development of different features to begin earlier or later, to occur in this or that part of the embryo, and to continue for more or less time.&lt;ref name=CarrollNatHist/&gt;

The puzzle of how embryonic development was controlled began to be solved using the fruit fly ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' as a [[model organism]]. The step-by-step control of [[Drosophila embryogenesis|its embryogenesis]] was visualized by attaching [[fluorescence|fluorescent]] dyes of different colours to specific types of protein made by genes expressed in the embryo.&lt;ref name=CarrollNatHist/&gt; A dye such as [[green fluorescent protein]], originally from [[Aequorea victoria|a jellyfish]], was typically attached to an [[antibody]] specific to a fruit fly protein, forming a precise indicator of where and when that protein appeared in the living embryo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fluorescent Probes |url=https://www.thermofisher.com/uk/en/home/life-science/protein-biology/protein-biology-learning-center/protein-biology-resource-library/pierce-protein-methods/fluorescent-probes.html# |publisher=ThermoFisher Scientific |accessdate=12 October 2016 |date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using such a technique, in 1994 [[Walter Gehring]] found that the ''[[pax-6]]'' gene, vital for forming the eyes of fruit flies, exactly matches an eye-forming gene in mice and humans. The same gene was quickly found in many other groups of animals, such as [[squid]], a [[cephalopod]] [[mollusc]]. Biologists including [[Ernst Mayr]] had believed that eyes had arisen in the animal kingdom at least 40 times, as the anatomy of different types of eye varies widely.&lt;ref name=CarrollNatHist/&gt; For example, the fruit fly's [[compound eye]] is made of hundreds of small lensed structures ([[ommatidia]]); the [[human eye]] has a [[blind spot (vision)|blind spot]] where the [[optic nerve]] enters the eye, and the nerve fibres run over the surface of the [[retina]], so light has to pass through a layer of nerve fibres before reaching the detector cells in the retina, so the structure is effectively "upside-down"; in contrast, the cephalopod eye has the retina, then a layer of nerve fibres, then the wall of the eye "the right way around".&lt;ref name=Land1992&gt;{{cite journal |first=M.

===Gene toolkit ===
[[File:Hoxgenesoffruitfly.svg|Expression of [[Hox gene|homeobox (Hox) genes]] in the fruit fly|thumb|300px]]
{{main|Evo-devo gene toolkit}}

A small fraction of the genes in an organism's genome control the organism's development. These genes are called the developmental-genetic toolkit. They are highly conserved among [[Phylum|phyla]], meaning that they are ancient and very similar in widely separated groups of animals. Differences in deployment of toolkit genes affect the body plan and the number, identity, and pattern of body parts. Most toolkit genes are parts of [[signalling pathway]]s: they encode [[transcription factor]]s, [[cell adhesion]] proteins, cell surface [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] proteins and signalling [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligands]] that bind to them, and secreted [[morphogens]] that diffuse through the embryo. All of these help to define the fate of undifferentiated cells in the embryo. Together, they generate the patterns in time and space which shape the embryo, and ultimately form the [[body plan]] of the organism. Among the most important toolkit genes are the [[Hox gene|''Hox'' genes]]. These transcription factors contain the [[homeobox]] protein-binding DNA motif, also found in other toolkit genes, and create the basic pattern of the body along its front-to-back axis.&lt;ref name=Carroll_2008/&gt;
Hox genes determine where repeating parts, such as the many [[vertebra]]e of [[snake]]s, will grow in a developing embryo or larva.&lt;ref name=CarrollNatHist/&gt; ''Pax-6'', already mentioned, is a classic toolkit gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Xu, P.X. |author2=Woo, I. |author3=Her, H. |author4=Beier, D.R. |author5=Maas, R.L. |year=1997 |title=Mouse Eya homologues of the Drosophila eyes absent gene require Pax6 for expression in lens and nasal placode |journal=Development |volume=124 |issue=1 |pmid=9006082 |pages=219–231}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homeobox]] genes are also found in plants, implying they are common to all [[eukaryote]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid19734295"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Mukherjee, K. |author2=Brocchieri, L. |author3=Bürglin, T.R. | title=A comprehensive classification and evolutionary analysis of plant homeobox genes | journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution | volume=26 | issue=12 | pages=2775–94 | date=December 2009 | pmid=19734295 | pmc=2775110 | doi=10.1093/molbev/msp201 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid9336443"&gt;{{cite journal | authors=Bürglin, T.R. | title=Analysis of TALE superclass homeobox genes (MEIS, PBC, KNOX, Iroquois, TGIF) reveals a novel domain conserved between plants and animals | journal=Nucleic Acids Research | volume=25 | issue=21 | pages=4173–80 | date=November 1997 | pmid=9336443 | pmc=147054 | doi= 10.1093/nar/25.21.4173}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17501745"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Derelle, R. |author2=Lopez, P. |author3=Le Guyader, H. |author4=Manuel, M. | title=Homeodomain proteins belong to the ancestral molecular toolkit of eukaryotes | journal=Evolution &amp; Development | volume=9 | issue=3 | pages=212–9 | year=2007 | pmid=17501745 | doi=10.1111/j.1525-142X.2007.00153.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The embryo's regulatory networks===
[[File:Gene Regulatory Network.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|A [[gene regulatory network]]]]
{{further|Regulation of gene expression|Transcriptional regulation}}

The protein products of the regulatory toolkit are reused not by duplication and modification, but by a complex mosaic of [[pleiotropy]], being applied unchanged in many independent developmental processes, giving pattern to many dissimilar body structures.&lt;ref name=Carroll_2008/&gt; The loci of these pleiotropic toolkit genes have large, complicated and modular [[cis-regulatory element]]s. For example, while a non-pleiotropic [[rhodopsin]] gene in the fruit fly has a cis-regulatory element just a few hundred [[base pair]]s long, the pleiotropic [[eyeless]] cis-regulatory region contains 6 cis-regulatory elements in over 7000 base pairs.&lt;ref name=Carroll_2008/&gt; The [[gene regulatory network|regulatory networks]] involved are often very large. Each regulatory protein controls "scores to hundreds" of cis-regulatory elements. For instance, 67 fruit fly transcription factors controlled on average 124 target genes each.&lt;ref name=Carroll_2008/&gt; All this complexity enables genes involved in the development of the embryo to be switched on and off at exactly the right times and in exactly the right places. Some of these genes are structural, directly forming enzymes, tissues and organs of the embryo. But many others are themselves regulatory genes, so what is switched on is often a precisely-timed cascade of switching, involving turning on one developmental process after another in the developing embryo.&lt;ref name=Carroll_2008/&gt;

[[File:Drosophila early embryo protein gradients.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Gene product distributions along the long axis of the early embryo of a [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit fly]]]]

Such a cascading regulatory network has been studied in detail in the [[Drosophila embryogenesis|development of the fruit fly embryo]]. The young embryo is oval in shape, like a [[rugby ball]]. A small number of genes produce [[messenger RNA]]s that set up concentration gradients along the long axis of the embryo. In the early embryo, the ''[[bicoid]]'' and ''hunchback'' genes are at high concentration near the anterior end, and give pattern to the future head and thorax; the ''caudal'' and ''[[nanos (gene)|nanos]]'' genes are at high concentration near the posterior end, and give pattern to the hindmost abdominal segments. The effects of these genes interact; for instance, the Bicoid protein blocks the translation of ''caudal'''s messenger RNA, so the Caudal protein concentration becomes low at the anterior end. Caudal later switches on genes which create the fly's hindmost segments, but only at the posterior end where it is most concentrated.&lt;ref name=Russel&gt;{{cite book | last=Russel | first=Peter | title=iGenetics: a molecular approach | year=2010 | publisher=Pearson Education | isbn=978-0-321-56976-9 | pages=564–571 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rivera&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Rivera-Pomar, Rolando |author2=Jackle, Herbert |year=1996 |title=From gradients to stripes in Drosophila embryogenesis: Filling in the gaps | journal=Trends in Genetics |volume=12 | issue=11 | pages=478–483 | doi=10.1016/0168-9525(96)10044-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gap gene expression.svg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Gap gene]]s in the fruit fly are switched on by genes such as ''[[bicoid]]'', setting up stripes across the embryo which start to pattern the body's segments.]]

The Bicoid, Hunchback and Caudal proteins in turn regulate the transcription of [[gap gene]]s such as ''giant'', ''knirps'', ''Krüppel'', and ''tailless'' in a striped pattern, creating the first level of structures that will become segments.&lt;ref name="Nusslein"/&gt; The proteins from these in turn control the [[pair-rule gene]]s, which in the next stage set up 7 bands across the embryo's long axis. Finally, the segment polarity genes such as ''[[engrailed (gene)|engrailed]]'' split each of the 7 bands into two, creating 14 future segments.&lt;ref name=Russel/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rivera/&gt;

This process explains the accurate conservation of toolkit gene sequences, which has resulted in deep homology and functional equivalence of toolkit proteins in dissimilar animals (seen, for example, when a mouse protein controls fruit fly development). The interactions of transcription factors and cis-regulatory elements, or of signalling proteins and receptors, become locked in through multiple usages, making almost any mutation deleterious and hence eliminated by natural selection.&lt;ref name=Carroll_2008/&gt;

==The origins of novelty ==
{{see also|History of evolutionary thought#21st century}}

Among the more surprising and, perhaps, counterintuitive (from a [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|neo-Darwinian]] viewpoint) results of recent research in evolutionary developmental biology is that the diversity of [[body plan]]s and [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] in organisms across many [[phylum|phyla]] are not necessarily reflected in diversity at the level of the sequences of genes, including those of the developmental genetic toolkit and other genes involved in development. Indeed, as John Gerhart and Marc Kirschner have noted, there is an apparent paradox: "where we most expect to find variation, we find conservation, a lack of change".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gerhart |first=John |last2=Kirschner |first2=Marc | year=1997 | title=Cells, Embryos and Evolution| publisher=Blackwell Science |isbn=978-0-86542-574-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; So, if the observed morphological novelty between different [[clade]]s does not come from changes in gene sequences (such as by [[mutation (biology)|mutation]]), where does it come from?

Variations in the toolkit may have produced a large part of the morphological evolution of animals. The toolkit can drive evolution in two ways.

===Consolidation of epigenetic changes===
{{main|Genetic assimilation|Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance}}
{{further|Extended evolutionary synthesis}}

Evolutionary innovation may sometimes begin [[Lamarckism|in Lamarckian style]] with [[Epigenetics|epigenetic]] alterations of gene regulation or [[morphogenesis|phenotype generation]], subsequently [[genetic assimilation|consolidated by changes at the gene level]]. Epigenetic changes include modification of DNA by reversible methylation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Epigenetic Inheritance and Evolution: The Lamarckian Dimension |last=Jablonka |first=Eva |last2=Lamb |first2=Marion |year=1995 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford, New York |isbn=978-0-19-854063-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as nonprogrammed remoulding of the organism by physical and other environmental effects due to the inherent [[phenotypic plasticity|plasticity]] of developmental mechanisms.&lt;ref name="West-Eberhard 2003"&gt;{{cite book |last=West-Eberhard |first=M-J. |year=2003 |title=Developmental plasticity and evolution |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-512235-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The biologists [[Stuart Newman|Stuart A. Newman]] and [[Gerd Müller (theoretical biologist)|Gerd B. Müller]] have suggested that organisms early in the history of multicellular life were more susceptible to this second category of epigenetic determination than are modern organisms, providing a basis for early [[macroevolution]]ary changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Müller, Gerd B. |editor2=Newman, Stuart A. | year=2003 | title=[[Origination of Organismal Form |Origination of Organismal Form: Beyond the Gene in Developmental and Evolutionary Biology]] | publisher=MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developmental bias===
[[File:Chilipoda- Geophilomorpha (3309242471).jpg|thumb|Among the [[centipede]]s, all members of the [[Geophilomorpha]] are constrained by a developmental bias to have an odd number of segments, whether as few as 27 or as many as 191.]]

Development in specific lineages can be biased either positively, towards a given trajectory or phenotype,{{efn|Positive bias is sometimes called developmental drive.&lt;ref name=Arthur2001/&gt;}} or negatively, away from producing certain types of change; either may be absolute (the change is always or never produced) or relative. Evidence for any such direction in evolution is however hard to acquire. For example, in the [[gastropod]]s, the snail-type shell is always built as a tube that grows both in length and in diameter; selection has created a wide variety of shell shapes such as flat spirals, [[cowrie]]s and tall turret spirals within these constraints. Among the [[centipede]]s, the [[Lithobiomorpha]] always have 15 trunk segments as adults, probably the result of a developmental bias towards an odd number of trunk segments. Another centipede order, the [[Geophilomorpha]], the number of segments varies in different species between 27 and 191, but the number is always odd, making this an absolute constraint; almost all the odd numbers in that range are occupied by one or another species.&lt;ref name=Arthur2001&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Arthur |first=W. |date=July 2001 |title=Developmental drive: an important determinant of the direction of phenotypic evolution |journal=Evolution &amp; Development |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=271–278 |pmid=11478524 |doi=10.1046/j.1525-142x.2001.003004271.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Arthur2002Centipedes&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Arthur |first=W. |date=October 2002 |title=The interaction between developmental bias and natural selection: from centipede segments to a general hypothesis |journal=Heredity |volume=89 |issue=4 |pages=239–246 |doi=10.1038/sj.hdy.6800139 |pmid=12242638}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ChipmanArthurAkam2004&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Chipman |first=Ariel D. |last2=Arthur |first2=Wallace |last3=Akam |first3=Michael |date=July 2004 |title=A Double Segment Periodicity Underlies Segment Generation in Centipede Development |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982204005184 |journal=Current Biology |volume=14 |issue=14 |pages=1250–1255 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2004.07.026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:PerformanceEnvelope.gif|300px|thumb|Flight envelope diagram.]]

In [[aerodynamics]], the '''flight envelope''', '''service envelope''', or '''performance envelope''' of an [[aircraft]] or interplanetary [[spacecraft]] refers to the capabilities of a design in terms of [[airspeed]] and [[Load factor (aeronautics)|load factor]] or atmospheric density, often simplified to altitude for Earth-borne aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?type=simple;c=ecfr;cc=ecfr;sid=a8f38006e777ba46ba8000f7c2fe6641;region=DIV1;q1=23.335;rgn=div8;view=text;idno=14;node=14%3A1.0.1.3.10.3.70.8 §23.333 Flight envelope] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402202400/http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?type=simple%3Bc%3Decfr%3Bcc%3Decfr%3Bsid%3Da8f38006e777ba46ba8000f7c2fe6641%3Bregion%3DDIV1%3Bq1%3D23.335%3Brgn%3Ddiv8%3Bview%3Dtext%3Bidno%3D14%3Bnode%3D14%3A1.0.1.3.10.3.70.8 |date=2012-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.access.gpo.gov/ecfr/graphics/pdfs/ec28se91.001.pdf Flight envelope - diagram] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601204507/http://www.access.gpo.gov/ecfr/graphics/pdfs/ec28se91.001.pdf |date=June 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is somewhat loosely applied, and can also refer to other measurements such as manoeuvrability. When a plane is pushed, for instance by diving it at high speeds, it is said to be flown "outside the envelope", something considered rather dangerous.

Flight envelope is one of a number of related terms that are all used in a similar fashion. It is perhaps the most common term because it is the oldest, first being used in the early days of test flying. It is closely related to more modern terms known as '''extra power''' and a '''doghouse plot''' which are different ways of describing a flight envelope. In addition, the term has been widened in scope outside the field of engineering, to refer to the strict limits in which an event will take place or more generally to the '''predictable behaviour''' of a given phenomenon or situation, and hence, its "flight envelope" .

==Extra power==

Extra power, or ''specific excess power'',&lt;ref name="MFHap"/&gt; is a very basic method of determining an aircraft's flight envelope. It is easily calculated, but as a downside does not tell very much about the actual performance of the aircraft at different altitudes. 

Choosing any particular set of parameters will generate the needed power for a particular aircraft for those conditions. For instance a [[Cessna 150]] at 2,500&amp;nbsp;ft (800 m) altitude and 90&amp;nbsp;mph (140&amp;nbsp;km/h) speed needs about 60&amp;nbsp;hp (45&amp;nbsp;kW) to fly straight and level. The C150 is normally equipped with a 100&amp;nbsp;hp (75&amp;nbsp;kW) engine, so in this particular case the plane has 40&amp;nbsp;hp (30&amp;nbsp;kW) of extra power. In overall terms this is very little extra power, 60% of the engine's output is already used up just keeping the plane in the air. The leftover 40&amp;nbsp;hp (30&amp;nbsp;kW) is all that the aircraft has to manoeuvre with, meaning it can climb, turn, or speed up only a small amount. To put this in perspective, the C150 could not maintain a 2[[g-force|''g'']] (20&amp;nbsp;m/s²) turn, which would require a minimum of 120&amp;nbsp;hp under the same conditions.

For the same conditions a [[fighter aircraft]] might require considerably more power due to their wings being designed for high speed, high agility, or both. It could require 10,000&amp;nbsp;hp (7.5 MW) to achieve similar performance. However modern jet engines can provide considerable power with the equivalent of 50,000&amp;nbsp;hp (37 MW) not being atypical. With this amount of extra power the aircraft can achieve very high maximum [[rate of climb]], even climb straight up, make powerful continual manoeuvres, or fly at very high speeds.

==Doghouse plot==

[[Image:AltitudeEnvelopeText.GIF|thumb|Altitude envelope]]
[[Image:TurnRateEnvelope.GIF|thumb|Turn rate envelope]]

A doghouse plot generally shows the relation between speed at level flight and altitude, although other variables are also possible. It takes more effort to make than an extra power calculation, but in turn provides much more information such as ideal flight altitude. The plot typically looks something like an upside-down U and is commonly referred to as a doghouse plot due to its resemblance to a kennel (sometimes known as a 'doghouse' in American English). The diagram on the right shows a very simplified plot which shall be used to explain the general shape of the plot.

The outer edges of the diagram, the envelope, show the possible conditions that the aircraft can reach in straight and level flight. For instance, the aircraft described by the black altitude envelope on the right can fly at altitudes up to about 52,000 feet, at which point the thinner air means it can no longer climb. The aircraft can also fly at up to Mach 1.1 at sea level, but no faster. This outer surface of the curve represents the ''zero-extra-power condition''. All of the area under the curve represents conditions that the plane can fly at with power to spare, for instance, this aircraft can fly at Mach 0.5 at 30,000 feet while using less than full power.

In the case of high-performance aircraft, including fighters, this "1-g" line showing straight-and-level flight is augmented with additional lines showing the maximum performance at various g loadings. In the diagram at right, the green line represents, 2-g, the blue line 3-g, and so on. The [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]] has a very small area just below Mach 1 and close to sea level where it can maintain a 9-g turn.

Flying outside the envelope is possible, since it represents the straight-and-level condition only. For instance diving the aircraft allows higher speeds, using gravity as a source of additional power. Likewise higher altitude can be reached by first speeding up and then going ballistic, a manoeuvre known as a [[zoom climb]].

===Stalling speed===

All [[fixed-wing aircraft]] have a minimum speed at which they can maintain level flight, the [[stall speed]] (left limit line in the diagram). As the aircraft gains altitude the stall speed increases; since the wing is not growing any larger the only way to support the aircraft's weight with less air is to increase speed. While the exact numbers will vary widely from aircraft to aircraft, the nature of this relationship is typically the same; plotted on a graph of speed (x-axis) vs. altitude (y-axis) it forms a diagonal line.

===Service ceiling===

Inefficiencies in the wings also make this line "tilt over" with increased altitude, until it becomes horizontal and no additional speed will result in increased altitude. This maximum altitude is known as the [[service ceiling]] (top limit line in the diagram), and is often quoted for aircraft performance. The area where the altitude for a given speed can no longer be increased at level flight is known as ''zero rate of climb'' and is caused by the [[Lift (force)|lift]] of the aircraft getting smaller at higher altitudes, until it no longer exceeds [[gravity]].

===Top speed===

The right side of the graph represents the maximum speed of the aircraft. This is typically sloped in the same manner as the stall line due to air resistance getting lower at higher altitudes, up to the point where an increase in altitude no longer increases the maximum speed due to lack of oxygen to feed the engines.

The power needed varies almost linearly with altitude, but the nature of [[drag (physics)|drag]] means that it varies with the square of speed—in other words it is typically easier to go higher than faster, up to the altitude where lack of oxygen for the engines starts to play a significant role.

==Velocity vs. load factor chart==

[[File:F-104A flight envelope.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|A V-n diagram showing V&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; (stall speed at 1G), V&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; (corner/manoeuvre speed) and V&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; (dive speed)]]
A chart of velocity versus load factor (or V-n diagram) is another way of showing limits of aircraft performance. It shows how much load factor can be safely achieved at different airspeeds.&lt;ref name="MFHap"&gt;Sinclair, Edward J. [http://www.usarmyaviation.com/studyguides/index.php?folder=Documents/General%20Studyguides&amp;download=Maneuvering%20Flight%20Handbook%2024%20MAR%2005.pdf "The Army Aviator's Handbook for Manoeuvring Flight and Power Management"]. p. 25. ''[[United States Army Aviation Branch]]'', 24 March 2005. Accessed: 6 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

At higher temperatures, air is less dense and planes must fly faster to generate the same amount of lift. High heat may reduce the amount of cargo a plane can carry, increase the length of runway a plane needs to take off,
and make it more difficult to avoid obstacles such as mountains. In unusual weather conditions this may make it unsafe or uneconomical to fly, occasionally resulting in the cancellation of commercial flights.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/planes-cant-fly-hot-ways-civilization-cant-take-heat/ Why planes can’t fly when it’s too hot, and other ways our civilization can’t take the heat]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessinsider.com/why-planes-cant-fly-in-extreme-heat-2013-7 Why Planes Can't Fly In Extreme Heat]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sidenotes==

Although it is easy to compare aircraft on simple numbers such as maximum speed or service ceiling, an examination of the flight envelope will reveal far more information. Generally a design with a larger area under the curve will have better all-around performance. This is because when the plane is not flying at the edges of the envelope, its extra power will be greater, and that means more power for things like climbing or manoeuvring. [[General aviation]] aircraft have very small flight envelopes, with speeds ranging from perhaps 50 to 200&amp;nbsp;mph, whereas the extra power available to modern fighter aircraft result in huge flight envelopes with many times the area. As a tradeoff however, military aircraft often have a higher stalling speed. As a result of this the landing speed is also higher.

*'''[[Absolute humidity]]''' — describes the water content of air and is expressed in either grams per cubic meter&lt;ref&gt;Wyer, S.S., "A treatise on producer-gas and gas-producers", (1906) The Engineering and Mining Journal, London, p.23&lt;/ref&gt; or grams per kilogram&lt;ref&gt;Perry, R.H. and Green, D.W, (2007) ''[[Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook]]'' (8th Edition),  Section 12, Psychrometry, Evaporative Cooling and Solids Drying [[McGraw-Hill]], {{ISBN|978-0-07-151135-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 
*'''[[Absolute value]]''' — In [[mathematics]], the '''absolute value''' or '''modulus''' {{math|{{!}}''x''{{!}}}} of a [[real number]]&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|x}} is the [[non-negative]] value of&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|x}} without regard to its [[sign (mathematics)|sign]]. Namely, {{math|1={{!}}''x''{{!}} = ''x''}} for a [[positive number|positive]]&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|x}}, {{math|1={{!}}''x''{{!}} = −''x''}} for a [[negative number|negative]]&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|x}} (in which case {{math|−''x''}} is positive), and {{math|1={{!}}0{{!}} = 0}}. For example, the absolute value of 3 is 3, and the absolute value of −3 is also 3. The absolute value of a number may be thought of as its [[distance]] from zero.
*'''[[Acceleration]]''' —  In [[physics]], '''acceleration''' is the [[Rate (mathematics)|rate]] of change of [[velocity]] of an object with respect to time. An object's acceleration is the net result of any and all [[force]]s acting on the object, as described by [[Newton's Second Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Principles of Mechanics |first=Henry |last=Crew |publisher=BiblioBazaar, LLC |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-559-36871-4 |pages=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International System of Units|SI]] unit for acceleration is [[metre per second squared]] {{nowrap|(m s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;).}} Accelerations are [[Euclidean vector|vector]] quantities (they have [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] and [[Direction (geometry)|direction]]) and add according to the [[parallelogram law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Relativity and Common Sense |first=Hermann |last=Bondi |pages=3 |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |year=1980 |isbn=978-0-486-24021-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Physics the Easy Way |pages=27 |first=Robert L. |last=Lehrman |publisher=Barron's Educational Series |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-7641-0236-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a [[Vector space|vector]], the calculated net [[force]] is equal to the product of the object's mass (a [[Scalar (physics)|scalar]] quantity) and its acceleration.
*'''[[Acquisition of signal]]''' —  A '''pass''', in [[spaceflight]] and [[satellite communications]], is the period in which a [[satellite]] or other [[spacecraft]] is above the [[Horizontal coordinate system|local horizon]] and available for [[radio]] communication with a particular [[ground station]], [[satellite receiver]], or relay satellite (or, in some cases, for visual sighting). The beginning of a pass is termed ''acquisition of signal''; the end of a pass is termed ''loss of signal''.&lt;ref name=NLSA&gt;{{cite web|title=AOS, TCA, and LOS|url=http://www.nlsa.com/definitions/aos_defined.html|publisher=Northern Lights Software Associates|accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The point at which a spacecraft comes closest to a ground observer is the ''time of closest approach''.&lt;ref name=NLSA/&gt;
*'''[[Action (physics)|Action]]''' — In [[physics]], '''action''' is an attribute of the [[dynamics (physics)|dynamics]] of a [[physical system]] from which the [[equations of motion]] of the system can be derived. It is a [[functional (mathematics)|mathematical functional]] which takes the [[trajectory]], also called ''path'' or ''history'', of the system as its argument and has a [[real number]] as its result. Generally, the action takes different values for different paths.&lt;ref name="mcgraw1"&gt;McGraw Hill Encyclopaedia of Physics (2nd Edition), C.B. Parker, 1994, {{ISBN|0-07-051400-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Action has the [[dimensional analysis|dimensions]] of [[energy|[energy]]]⋅[[time|[time]]] or [[momentum|[momentum]]]⋅[[length|[length]]], and its [[SI unit]] is [[joule]]-second.
*'''[[Automatic direction finder|ADF]]''' —Automatic direction finder
*'''[[Advanced Space Vision System]]''' — The '''Advanced Space Vision System''' (also known as the Space Vision System or by its acronym SVS) is a  [[computer vision]] system designed primarily for [[International Space Station]] (ISS) assembly.&lt;ref name="nrcc"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/education/innovations/discoveries/svs.html|title=Space Vision System Helps Astronauts See in Space|accessdate=February 13, 2008|publisher=National Research Council of Canada|year=2008|author=NRCC|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603143525/http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/education/innovations/discoveries/svs.html|archivedate=June 3, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system uses regular 2D cameras in the [[Space Shuttle]] bay, on the [[Canadarm]], or on the ISS along with cooperative targets to calculate the 3D position of an object.&lt;ref name="nrcc"/&gt;
*'''[[Aeroacoustics]]''' — Is a branch of [[acoustics]] that studies noise generation via either [[turbulent]] fluid motion or [[aerodynamic]] forces interacting with surfaces. Noise generation can also be associated with periodically varying flows.  A notable example of this phenomenon is the [[Aeolian sound|Aeolian tones]] produced by wind blowing over fixed objects.
*'''[[Aerobraking]]''' — is a [[spaceflight]] maneuver that reduces the high point of an [[elliptical orbit]] ([[apoapsis]]) by flying the vehicle through the [[atmosphere]] at the low point of the [[orbit]] ([[periapsis]]). The resulting [[Drag (physics)|drag]] slows the [[spacecraft]]. Aerobraking is used when a spacecraft requires a low orbit after arriving at a body with an atmosphere, and it requires less fuel than does the direct use of a [[rocket engine]].
*'''[[Aerocapture]]''' —  is an [[Orbital maneuver|orbital transfer maneuver]] used to reduce the velocity of a spacecraft from a [[hyperbolic trajectory]] to an elliptical orbit around the targeted celestial body.
*'''[[Aerodynamics]]''' — is the study of the motion of [[air]], particularly its interaction with a solid object, such as an [[airplane]] wing. It is a sub-field of [[fluid dynamics]] and [[gas dynamics]], and many aspects of aerodynamics theory are common to these fields. 
*'''[[Aeroelasticity]]''' — is the branch of [[physics]] and [[engineering]] that studies the interactions between the [[inertial force|inertial]], [[elasticity (physics)|elastic]], and [[aerodynamic force|aerodynamic]] forces that occur when an elastic body is exposed to a [[fluid]] flow. Although historical studies have been focused on aeronautical applications, recent research has found applications in fields such as [[energy harvesting]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sousa|first=V. C.|title=Enhanced aeroelastic energy harvesting by exploiting combined nonlinearities: theory and experiment|journal=Smart Materials and Structures|year=2011|volume=20|number=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and understanding [[snoring]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ellis|first= P. D. M. |title= Laser palatoplasty for snoring due to palatal flutter: a further report|journal= Clinical Otolaryngology|year=1994|volume=19|number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of aeroelasticity may be broadly classified into two fields: static aeroelasticity, which deals with the static or [[steady state|steady]] response of an elastic body to a fluid flow; and dynamic aeroelasticity, which deals with the body's [[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamic]] (typically [[vibration]]al) response. Aeroelasticity draws on the study of [[fluid mechanics]], [[solid mechanics]], [[structural dynamics]] and [[dynamical systems]]. The synthesis of aeroelasticity with [[thermodynamics]] is known as aerothermoelasticity, and its synthesis with [[control theory]] is known as aeroservoelasticity.
*'''[[Aeronautics]]''' — Is the science or art involved with the study, [[design process|design]], and manufacturing of air [[flight]] capable machines, and the techniques of operating [[aircraft]] and rockets within the [[atmosphere]].
*'''[[Aerospace architecture]]''' — is broadly defined to encompass [[architecture|architectural]] design of non-habitable and habitable structures and living and working environments in aerospace-related facilities, habitats, and vehicles. These environments include, but are not limited to: science platform aircraft and aircraft-deployable systems; [[space vehicle]]s, [[space station]]s, habitats and lunar and [[planetary surface construction]] bases; and Earth-based control, experiment, launch, logistics, payload, simulation and test facilities. Earth analogs to space applications may include Antarctic, desert, high altitude, underground, undersea environments and closed ecological systems.
*'''[[Aerospace bearing]]''' — '''Aerospace bearings''' are the bearings installed in [[aircraft]] and [[aerospace]] systems including commercial, private, military, or space applications.
*'''[[Aerospace engineering]]''' — is the primary field of [[engineering]] concerned with the development of [[aircraft]] and [[spacecraft]].&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Aerospace Engineering''. [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]], 2010. {{ISBN|978-0-470-75440-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has two major and overlapping branches: Aeronautical engineering and Astronautical Engineering.  [[Avionics]] engineering is similar, but deals with the [[electronic engineering|electronics]] side of aerospace engineering.
*'''[[Aerospace materials]]''' — are materials, frequently [[alloy|metal alloy]]s, that have either been developed for, or have come to prominence through, their use for [[aerospace]] purposes. These uses often require exceptional performance, strength or heat resistance, even at the cost of considerable expense in their production or machining. Others are chosen for their long-term reliability in this safety-conscious field, particularly for their resistance to [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]].
*'''[[Aerospike engine]]''' — is a type of [[rocket engine]] that maintains its [[aerodynamic]] efficiency across a wide range of [[altitude]]s. It belongs to the class of [[altitude compensating nozzle]] engines. A vehicle with an aerospike engine uses 25–30% less fuel at low altitudes, where most missions have the greatest need for [[thrust]].
*'''[[Aerostat]]''' — is a [[lighter than air]] aircraft that gains its lift through the use of a buoyant gas. Aerostats include unpowered [[balloon (aircraft)|balloons]] and powered [[airship]]s.
*'''[[Aerostructure]]''' — is a component of an [[aircraft]]'s airframe. This may include all or part of the [[fuselage]], [[wing]]s, or flight control surfaces.
*'''[[Aft-crossing trajectory]]''' — is an alternate flight path for a rocket. The rocket's rotation (induced by the deployment from the aircraft) is slowed by a small [[parachute]] attached to its tail, then ignited once the carrier aircraft has passed it.  It is ignited before it is pointing fully vertically, however it will turn to do so, and accelerates to pass behind the carrier aircraft. 
*'''[[Above ground level|AGL]]''' — Above ground level
*'''[[Aileron]]''' — is a hinged [[flight control surface]] usually forming part of the [[trailing edge]] of each [[wing]] of a [[fixed-wing aircraft]]. Ailerons are used in pairs to control the aircraft in [[Flight dynamics|roll]] (or movement around the aircraft's [[Flight control surfaces#Longitudinal axis|longitudinal axis]]), which normally results in a change in flight path due to the tilting of the [[Lift (force)|lift vector]].  Movement around this axis is called 'rolling' or 'banking'.
*'''[[Air-augmented rocket]]''' —
*'''[[Aircraft]]''' — is a [[machine]] that is able to [[flight|fly]] by gaining support from the [[air]].&lt;!--English word "aircraft" is singular and plural with no "s".

*'''[[Aircraft flight control systems]]''' — A conventional [[Fixed-wing aircraft|fixed-wing]] '''aircraft flight control system''' consists of [[flight control surfaces]], the respective cockpit controls, connecting linkages, and the necessary operating mechanisms to control an aircraft's direction in flight. [[Aircraft engine controls]] are also considered as flight controls as they change speed.
*'''[[Aircraft flight mechanics]]''' —
*'''[[Airfoil]]''' — An '''airfoil''' ([[American English]]) or '''aerofoil''' ([[British English]]) is the cross-sectional shape of a [[wing]], blade (of a [[Propeller (aeronautics)|propeller]], [[Helicopter rotor|rotor]], or [[turbine]]), or [[sail]] (as seen in [[Multiview orthographic projection#Section|cross-section]]).
*'''[[Airlock]]''' — is a device which permits the passage of people and objects between a [[pressure vessel]] and its surroundings while minimizing the change of [[pressure]] in the vessel and loss of [[air]] from it.  The lock consists of a small chamber with two [[Hermetic seal|airtight]] [[door]]s in series which do not open simultaneously.
*'''[[Airship]]''' — An '''airship''' or '''dirigible balloon''' is a type of [[aerostat]] or lighter-than-air aircraft that can navigate through the air under its own power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/airship|title=Definition of AIRSHIP|work=merriam-webster.com|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aerostats gain their lift from large gas bags filled with a [[lifting gas]] that is less dense than the surrounding air.
*'''[[Albedo]]''' — is the measure of the [[diffuse reflection]] of [[sunlight|solar radiation]] out of the total [[solar radiation]] received by an [[astronomical body]] (e.g. a [[planet]] like [[Earth]]). It is [[dimensionless number|dimensionless]] and measured on a scale from 0 (corresponding to a [[black body]] that absorbs all incident radiation) to 1 (corresponding to a body that reflects all incident radiation).
*'''[[Anemometer]]''' — is a device used for measuring [[wind speed]], and is also a common [[weather station]] instrument. The term is derived from the Greek word ''anemos'', which means [[wind]], and is used to describe any wind speed instrument used in [[meteorology]].
*'''[[Angle of attack]]''' —  In [[fluid dynamics]], '''angle of attack''' ('''AOA''', or '''&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;''') is the [[angle]] between a [[Airfoil#Airfoil terminology|reference line]] on a body (often the [[chord (aircraft)|chord line]] of an [[airfoil]]) and the [[vector (geometry)|vector]] representing the relative motion between the body and the fluid through which it is moving.&lt;ref name="nasa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/airplane/incline.html|title=NASA aeronautics guided tour}}&lt;/ref&gt; Angle of attack is the angle between the body's reference line and the oncoming flow. 
*'''[[Angular momentum]]''' — In [[physics]], '''angular momentum''' (rarely, '''moment of momentum''' or '''rotational momentum''') is the rotational equivalent of [[linear momentum]]. It is an important quantity in physics because it is a [[Conservation law|conserved quantity]]—the total angular momentum of a system remains constant unless acted on by an external [[torque]].
*'''[[Angular velocity]]''' — In [[physics]], the '''angular velocity''' of a particle is the rate at which it rotates around a chosen center point: that is, the time rate of change of its [[angular displacement]] relative to the origin (i.e. in layman's terms: how quickly an object goes around something over a period of time - e.g. how fast the earth orbits the sun). It is measured in angle per unit time, [[radians per second]] in [[SI]] units, and is usually represented by the symbol [[omega]] ('''ω''', sometimes '''Ω'''). By convention, positive angular velocity indicates counter-clockwise rotation, while negative is clockwise.
*'''[[Anticyclone]]''' — An '''anticyclone''' (that is, opposite to a [[cyclone]]) is a [[weather]] [[meteorological phenomenon|phenomenon]] defined by the United States [[National Weather Service]]'s glossary as "a large-scale circulation of winds around a central region of high atmospheric pressure, clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere, counterclockwise in the Southern Hemisphere".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=Glossary: Anticyclone|date=|publisher=National Weather Service|accessdate=January 19, 2010|url=http://www.nws.noaa.gov/glossary/index.php?word=anticyclone|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629140523/http://www.nws.noaa.gov/glossary/index.php?word=anticyclone|archivedate=June 29, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''[[Antimatter rocket]]''' — is a proposed class of [[rocket]]s that use [[antimatter]] as their power source. There are several designs that attempt to accomplish this goal. The advantage to this class of rocket is that a large fraction of the [[rest mass]] of a matter/antimatter mixture may be converted to energy, allowing antimatter rockets to have a far higher [[energy density]] and [[specific impulse]] than any other proposed class of rocket.
*'''[[Apsis]]''' — is an extreme point in the [[orbit]] of an [[physical body|object]]. The word comes via Latin from Greek and is [[cognate]] with ''[[apse]]''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/apsis|title=the definition of apsis|website=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[elliptic orbit]]s about a larger body, there are two apsides, named with the prefixes ''peri-'' ({{ety||''περί'' (peri)|near}}) and ''ap-''/''apo-'' ({{ety||''ἀπ(ό)'' (ap(ó))|away from}}) added to a reference to the [[primary (astronomy)|body being orbited]].
*'''[[Arcjet rocket]]''' — or '''arcjet thruster''' is a form of [[electrically powered spacecraft propulsion]], in which an electrical discharge (arc) is created in a flow of propellant&lt;ref&gt;John, R. R., Bennett, S., and Connors, J. P., "Arcjet Engine Performance: Experiment and Theory," ''AIAA Journal, Vol. 1,'' No. 11, Nov. 1963.

This imparts additional energy to the propellant, so that one can extract more work out of each kilogram of propellant, at the expense of increased power consumption and (usually) higher cost.  Also, the [[thrust]] levels available from typically used arcjet engines are very low compared with chemical engines.
*'''[[Areal velocity]]''' — In [[classical mechanics]], '''areal velocity''' (also called '''sector velocity''' or '''sectorial velocity''') is the rate at which [[area]] is swept out by a particle as it moves along a [[curve]].

*'''[[Radio direction finder#Automatic direction finder (ADF)|Automatic direction finder]]''' —
*'''[[Aspect ratio (aeronautics)]]''' — In [[aeronautics]], the '''aspect ratio''' of a [[wing]] is the ratio of its [[Wingspan|span]] to its mean [[chord (aircraft)|chord]]. It is equal to the square of the wingspan divided by the wing area. Thus, a long, narrow wing has a high aspect ratio, whereas a short, wide wing has a low aspect ratio.&lt;ref name="Kermode"&gt;Kermode, A.C. (1972), ''Mechanics of Flight'', Chapter 3, (p.103, eighth edition), Pitman Publishing Limited, London {{ISBN|0-273-31623-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aspect ratio and other features of the [[Planform (aeronautics)|planform]] are often used to predict the aerodynamic efficiency of a wing because the [[lift-to-drag ratio]] increases with aspect ratio, improving [[fuel economy in aircraft]].

*'''[[Buoyancy]]''' — In [[physics]], '''buoyancy''' or '''upthrust''', is an upward [[force]] exerted by a [[fluid]] that opposes the [[weight]] of an immersed object. In a column of fluid, pressure increases with depth as a result of the weight of the overlying fluid. Thus the pressure at the bottom of a column of fluid is greater than at the top of the column. Similarly, the pressure at the bottom of an object submerged in a fluid is greater than at the top of the object. This pressure difference results in a net upwards force on the object. The magnitude of that force exerted is proportional to that pressure difference, and (as explained by [[Archimedes' principle]]) is equivalent to the weight of the fluid that would otherwise occupy the volume of the object, i.e. the [[Displacement (fluid)|displaced]] fluid.

*'''[[Cabin pressurization]]''' — is a process in which conditioned air is pumped into the [[aircraft cabin|cabin]] of an aircraft or [[spacecraft]], in order to create a safe and comfortable environment for passengers and crew flying at high altitudes. For aircraft, this air is usually [[Bleed air|bled off]] from the [[gas turbine|gas turbine engines]] at the compressor stage, and for spacecraft, it is carried in high-pressure, often [[liquid oxygen|cryogenic]] tanks. The air is cooled, humidified, and mixed with recirculated air if necessary, before it is distributed to the cabin by one or more [[Environmental control system (aircraft)|environmental control systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blogs.howstuffworks.com/2011/04/12/how-airplane-cabin-pressurization-works-keeping-you-comfortable-in-the-death-zone-at-33000-feet/ | title=How Airplane Cabin Pressurization Works | publisher=How Stuff Works | date=April 12, 2011 | accessdate=December 31, 2012 | author=Brain, Marshall | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115141028/http://blogs.howstuffworks.com/2011/04/12/how-airplane-cabin-pressurization-works-keeping-you-comfortable-in-the-death-zone-at-33000-feet/ | archivedate=January 15, 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cabin pressure is regulated by the outflow valve.

{{infobox company 
| name=GoldieBlox
| founder= [[Debbie Sterling]]
}}
'''GoldieBlox'''  is an interactive toy company for girls. GoldieBlox launched in 2012 and went from a prototype on [[Kickstarter]] to more than $1m of pre-orders placed in under a month. In just under two years, GoldieBlox has made its way to [[Toys "R" Us]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], and more than 6,000 retailers worldwide, including Canada, Australia, and the UK. The company was founded by [[Debbie Sterling]], a Stanford engineering graduate and [[entrepreneur]], and is based in [[Oakland, CA]]. GoldieBlox pairs a construction kit with a storybook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chen|first1=Yuyu|title=GoldieBlox uses influencers to sell toys to young girls|url=http://digiday.com/brands/goldieblox-influencers/|website=''[[Digiday]]''|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
While Sterling was a student at Stanford, she noticed her classes were predominantly male. This ratio was indicative of a larger gender gap; while she was at Stanford, the percentage of women in engineering in the United States was only 11% &lt;ref name="postcrescent"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.postcrescent.com/article/20130622/APC0406/306220005/Girls-need-overcome-hurdles-build-their-presence-STEM-fields?nclick_check=1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924080715/http://www.postcrescent.com/article/20130622/APC0406/306220005/Girls-need-overcome-hurdles-build-their-presence-STEM-fields?nclick_check=1 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=24 September 2015 |title=Girls need to overcome hurdles to build their presence in STEM fields |publisher=[[Post-Crescent]] |date=11 June 2013 |accessdate=3 July 2013 |last=Harp |first=Jill }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/09/24/goldieblox-the-toy-designed-to-inspire-future-female-engineers/ | title=GoldieBlox, The Toy Designed To Inspire Future Female Engineers | publisher=Time | date=24 September 2012 | accessdate=3 July 2013 | last=Paramaguru, | first=Kharunya}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After research, Sterling found that girls begin to lose interest in math and science as young as age 8. She set out to create a solution, but knew that creating a pink construction toy wasn’t enough.  She spent two years studying early child development, specifically in girls and the gender marketing of toys, and learned that girls excel in verbal skills, reading and writing. The breakthrough of GoldieBlox marries the story of Goldie, a girl inventor who loves to build, with a construction kit.&lt;ref name="sfgate"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/GoldieBlox-helps-get-girls-into-engineering-4264633.php | title=GoldieBlox helps get girls into engineering | publisher=SF Gate | date=8 February 2013 | accessdate=3 July 2013 | last=Said | first=Carolyn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To fund her first round of production, Sterling created a Kickstarter campaign in 2012.&lt;ref name="vb"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://venturebeat.com/2012/09/25/goldie-blox/ | title=Stanford engineer launches GoldieBlox, a toy to inspire young girls to be engineers | publisher=Venture Beat | date=25 September 2012 | accessdate=3 July 2013 | last=Farr | first=Christina}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kickstarter"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/16029337/goldieblox-the-engineering-toy-for-girls | title=GoldieBlox: The Engineering Toy for Girls | publisher=Kickstarter | date=October 2012 | accessdate=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project reached its funding goal of $150,000 in 4 days, and went on to raise a total of $285,881 with 5,519 backers by the end of the campaign. In just under two years, GoldieBlox has made its way to Toys “R” Us, Amazon, and more than 1,000 retailers nationwide and in Canada, the U.K. and Australia.

==Products==
Geared toward ages (4-12), toys in the GoldieBlox series introduce engineering concepts to girls through storytelling and building. Each toy introduces new characters and concepts, and there are currently six sets in the series.

In 2014, GoldieBlox also began introducing digital content. The company’s first mobile app, GoldieBlox and the Movie Machine, was introduced in October 2014. The app features the company’s first-ever animated cartoon, and was named by Apple as one of the Best Apps of 2014. Bloxtown.com, GoldieBlox’s digital playground, houses original content and videos of new design ideas for kids to watch and build at home.

==Videos==

===GoldieBlox &amp; Rube Goldberg “Princess Machine”===
GoldieBlox’s “Princess Machine” video launched on YouTube in November 2013, garnering over 8 million views in 4 days. The video features three young girls building a Rube Goldberg machine built by [[Brett Doar]], and was set to a parody tune of the  [[Beastie Boys]] song "[[Girls (Beastie Boys song)|Girls]]". Shortly after the release, the Beastie Boys reached out to GoldieBlox, inquiring about the use of their song without their permission. Goldieblox responded by suing for [[declaratory judgment]] in U.S. District Court of San Francisco seeking declaration of [[Parody#United States|fair use due to parody]]. GoldieBlox  claimed fair use on the grounds that they had "created its parody video specifically to comment on the Beastie Boys song, and to further the company's goal to break down gender stereotypes and to encourage young girls to engage in their intellect."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/186402972/Beastie|title=Beastie|website=Scribd|date=21 November 2013 |access-date=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Beastie Boys responded with an [http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/25/the-beastie-boys-fight-online-video-parody-of-girls/?_r=1 open letter], in which they lauded "the creativity and message behind the ad," voiced their support for GoldieBlox's mission, but ultimately declared that the band did not permit their "music and/or name to be used in product ads,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/25/the-beastie-boys-fight-online-video-parody-of-girls/?_r=1|title=Beastie Boys Fight Online Video Parody of 'Girls'|last=Itzkoff|first=Dave|website=ArtsBeat |date=25 November 2013 |access-date=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a claim which was further bolstered by a stipulation in deceased band member [[Adam Yauch]]'s will.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/adam-yauchs-will-prohibits-use-of-his-music-in-ads-20120809|title=Adam Yauch's Will Prohibits Use of His Music in Ads|website=Rolling Stone|date=9 August 2012|access-date=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Beastie Boys concluded their letter by stating, "when we tried to simply ask how and why our song 'Girls' had been used in your ad without our permission, YOU sued US."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spin.com/2013/11/beastie-boys-girls-goldieblox-toy-open-letter-lawsuit/|title=Beastie Boys Write Classy Open Letter to ‘Girls’-Spoofing Toy Company {{!}} SPIN|website=Spin|date=25 November 2013|access-date=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; GoldieBlox responded positively by taking down the video and writing their own open letter (which has since been [http://blog.goldieblox.com/2013/11/our-letter-to-the-beastie-boys/ taken down]) stating that, "although we believe our parody video falls under fair use, we would like to respect [Yauch's] wishes and yours." Regardless, the Beastie Boys went ahead with the counter lawsuit and a settlement was ultimately reached. The settlement granted GoldieBlox a retroactive license for the song, in exchange GoldieBlox "agreed to make annual payments of 1% of its gross revenue, until the total payments reached $1 million, to a charitable organization chosen by the Beastie Boys and approved by GoldieBlox which supports ‘science, technology, engineering and/or mathematics education for "girls’."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/may/13/goldieblox-beastie-boys-girls-settlement|title=GoldieBlox agreed to pay $1m to charity in Beastie Boys settlement|last=Dredge|first=Stuart|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|date=13 May 2014|access-date=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===This is Your Brain on Engineering (GoldieBlox Easter PSA)===
“This is Your Brain on Engineering (GoldieBlox Easter PSA)” video launched on YouTube in April 2014.  The video spotlights the difference between a young girl’s brain “on princess” vs. her brain “on engineering.” It’s an eye opener to the gender norms placed on young girls at an early age, and uses wheels, axles and engineering to highlight some statistics related to the dearth of women in engineering.

===GoldieBlox vs. the Big Sister Machine===
“GoldieBlox vs. the Big Sister Machine” launched on YouTube in November 2014, demonstrating the need for female role models inspired by ingenuity and creativity. In the video, Big Sister prescribes her ideals of beauty and perfection to young girls. Little Sister - a girl inspired by Goldie - rebels against the mantra, breaking the girls free and leading them to a world of possibilities. The video is set to [[Metric (band)|Metric]]'s "Help I'm Alive" hit.

===Lightning Strikes===
GoldieBlox released their first single and animated music video, "Lightning Strikes," in December 2014. The track is an original song written and performed by [[Emily Haines]], the lead singer of Canadian rock band Metric. The video and song feature Goldie, a strong female character who comes up with a great idea and strives to accomplish it, despite whatever set-backs occur along the way. GoldieBlox and Emily created the song as a message to girls, showing them that with confidence and ingenuity they can accomplish anything.

==Advertisements==

===Intuit’s Small Business Big Game Super Bowl commercial===
In February 2014, GoldieBlox won [[Intuit]]’s Small Business, Big Game contest, earning a 30-second commercial spot during the broadcast of [[Super Bowl XLVIII]]. The commercial airtime was valued at $4 million, and with the advertisement, GoldieBlox became the first small business to air an ad in the Super Bowl. The ad was set to a parody of the Slade/Quiet Riot song, "Come on Feel the Noize," changing the words to "Come On Bring the Toys." The ad depicted hundreds of little girls ditching their pink toys, while singing "More than pink, pink, pink, we want to think," and that "girls build like all the boys."  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/GoldieBlox-Super-Bowl-ad-strives-to-entice-girls-5194465.php|title=GoldieBlox Super Bowl ad strives to entice girls to science|first=Carolyn|last=Said|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|date=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anthropology}}
'''Historical anthropology''' is a [[historiographical]] movement which applies methodologies and objectives from [[Social Anthropology|Social]] and [[Cultural Anthropology]] to the study of historical societies.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth A. Ten Dyke, 'Anthropology, Historical' in Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing, ed. by Kelly Boyd (Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn, 1999), pp. 37--40 (p. 37).&lt;/ref&gt; Like most such movements, it is understood in different ways by different scholars, and to some may be synonymous with the [[history of mentalities]], [[cultural history]], [[ethnohistory]], [[microhistory]], [[People's history|history from below]] or ''[[Alltagsgeschichte]]''. Anthropologists whose work has been particularly inspirational to historical anthropology include [[Emile Durkheim]], [[Clifford Geertz]], [[Arnold van Gennep]], [[Jack Goody]], [[Lucien Lévy-Bruhl]], [[Marcel Mauss]] and [[Victor Turner]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated37"&gt;Elizabeth A. Ten Dyke, 'Anthropology, Historical' in Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing, ed. by Kelly Boyd (Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn, 1999), pp. 37--40 (p. 38).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Burke (historian)|Peter Burke]] has contrasted historical anthropology with [[Social History]], finding that historical anthropology tends to focus on qualitative rather than quantitative data, smaller communities, and symbolic aspects of culture.&lt;ref name="autogenerated37"/&gt; Thus it reflects a turn away, in the 1960s, in [[Marxist historiography]] from 'the orthodox Marxist approach to human behaviour in which actors are seen as motivated in the first instance by economics, and only secondarily by culture or ideology', in the work of historians such as [[E. P. Thompson]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated37"/&gt;

Historical anthropology was rooted in the [[Annales School]], associated with a succession of major historians such as [[Fernand Braudel]], [[Jacques Le Goff]], [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]] and [[Pierre Nora]], along with researchers from elsewhere on the Continent such as [[Carlo Ginzburg]]. The label ''historical anthropology'' has been actively promoted by some recent Annales School historians, such as [[Jean-Claude Schmitt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jean-Claude Schmitt |url=https://cem.revues.org/8862 |title=Anthropologie historique |publisher=Cem.revues.org |date= |accessdate=2015-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://acrh.revues.org/1926 |title=L’anthropologie historique de l’Occident médiéval. Un parcours |publisher=Acrh.revues.org |date= |accessdate=2015-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Established in 1929 by [[Marc Bloch]] and [[Lucien Febvre]], the review [[Annales. Histoire, Sciences sociales]] is still among the most influential French publications for research in historical anthropology.

Historical anthropology has been open to similar criticisms to anthropology: 'as [[Bernard Cohn (anthropologist)|Bernard Cohn]] and [[John Comaroff|John]] and [[Jean Comaroff]] have observed, studies in which societies were represented in this way were often partial, biased, and unwitting handmaidens to the domination of non-Western peoples by Europeans and Americans'.&lt;ref name="autogenerated37"/&gt; But since the Second World War, increasingly reflexive approaches have led to sophisticated developments of the field, and the banner of 'historical anthropology' has often attracted Anglo-American historians in ways that the Annales School did not: key figures have been [[Sidney Mintz]], [[Jay O'Brien (anthropologist)|Jay O'Brien]], [[William Roseberry]], [[Marshall Sahlins]], [[Jane Schneider]], [[Peter Schneider (historian)|Peter Schneider]], [[Eric Wolf]], [[Peter Burke (historian)|Peter Burke]], and people from elsewhere in the world such as [[Aaron Gurevich]].

The '''history of gaseous fuel''', important for lighting, heating, and cooking purposes throughout most of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, began with the development of [[analytical chemistry|analytical]] and [[pneumatic chemistry]] in the 18th century. The manufacturing process for "synthetic [[fuel gas]]es" (also known as "manufactured fuel gas", "manufactured gas" or simply "gas") typically consisted of the [[gasification]] of combustible materials, usually coal, but also wood and oil. The coal was gasified by heating the coal in enclosed ovens with an oxygen-poor atmosphere. The fuel gases generated were [[mixtures]] of many [[chemical substances]], including [[hydrogen]], [[methane]], [[carbon monoxide]] and [[ethylene]], and could be burnt for heating and lighting purposes. [[Coal gas]], for example, also contains significant quantities of unwanted [[sulfur]] and [[ammonia]] compounds, as well as heavy [[hydrocarbons]], and so the manufactured fuel gases needed to be purified before they could be used.

The first attempts to manufacture fuel gas in a commercial way were made in the period 1795–1805 in France by [[Philippe LeBon]], and in England by [[William Murdoch]]. Although precursors can be found, it was these two engineers who elaborated the technology with commercial applications in mind. Frederick Winsor was the key player behind the creation of the first gas utility, the London-based [[Gas Light and Coke Company]], incorporated by royal charter in April 1812.

Manufactured gas utilities were founded first in England, and then in the rest of Europe and North America in the 1820s. The technology increased in scale. After a period of competition, the business model of the gas industry matured in monopolies, where a single company provided gas in a given zone. The ownership of the companies varied from outright municipal ownership, such as in Manchester, to completely private corporations, such as in London and most North American cities. Gas companies thrived during most of the nineteenth century, usually returning good profits to their shareholders, but were also the subject of many complaints over price.

The most important use of manufactured gas in the early 19th century was for [[gas lighting]], as a convenient substitute for candles and oil lamps in the home.  Gas lighting became the first widespread form of [[Street light#gas lamp lighting|street lighting]].  For this use, gases that burned with a highly luminous flame, "illuminating gases", were needed, in contrast to other uses (e.g. as fuel) where the heat output was the main consideration.  Accordingly some gas mixtures of low intrinsic luminosity, such as [[Coal gas#Gas for industrial use|blue water gas]], were enriched with oil to make them more suitable for street lighting. 

In the second half of the 19th century, the manufactured fuel gas industry diversified out of lighting and into heat and cooking. The threat from electrical light in the later 1870s and 1880s drove this trend strongly. The gas industry did not cede the [[gas lighting]] market to electricity immediately, as the invention of the [[Welsbach mantle]], a refractory mesh bag heated to incandescence by a mostly non-luminous flame within, dramatically increased the efficiency of gas lighting. [[Acetylene]] was also used from about 1898 for [[gas stove|gas cooking]] and [[gas lighting]] (see [[Carbide lamp]]) on a smaller scale, although its use too declined with the advent of electric lighting, and [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]] for cooking.&lt;ref name=CGA100&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cganet.com/docs/100th.pdf|publisher=www.cganet.com|date=11 September 2013|title=Celebrating 100 Years as The Standard for Safety: The Compressed Gas Association, Inc. 1913 – 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other technological developments in the late nineteenth century include the use of [[water gas]] and machine stoking, although these were not universally adopted.

In the 1890s, [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]] from [[natural gas field]]s in Texas and Oklahoma were built to Chicago and other cities, and [[natural gas]] was used to supplement manufactured fuel gas supplies, eventually completely displacing it. Gas ceased to be manufactured in North America by 1966 (with the exception of Indianapolis and Honolulu), while it continued in Europe until the 1980s. "Manufactured gas" is again being evaluated as a fuel source, as energy utilities look towards [[coal gasification]] once again as a potentially cleaner way of generating power from coal, although nowadays such gases are likely to be called "[[synthetic natural gas]]".

== Early history of fuel gas ==

=== Precursors ===
[[File:Alessandro Volta.jpeg|left|thumb|Alessandro Volta]]
Pneumatic chemistry developed in the eighteenth century with the work of scientists such as [[Stephen Hales]], [[Joseph Black]], [[Joseph Priestley]], and [[Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier]], and others. Until the eighteenth century, gas was not recognized as a separate state of matter. Rather, while some of the mechanical properties of gases were understood, as typified by [[Robert Boyle]]'s experiments and the development of the [[air pump]], their chemical properties were not. Gases were regarded in keeping the Aristotelean tradition of four elements as being air, one of the four fundamental elements. The different sorts of airs, such as putrid airs or inflammable air, were looked upon as [[Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric air]] with some impurities, much like muddied water.

After Joseph Black realized that [[carbon dioxide]] was in fact a different sort of gas altogether from atmospheric air, other gases were identified, including [[hydrogen]] by [[Henry Cavendish]] in 1766. [[Alessandro Volta]] expanded the list with his discovery of methane in 1776. It had also been known for a long time that inflammable gases could be produced from most combustible materials, such as coal and wood, through the process of [[distillation]]. Stephen Hales, for example, had written about the phenomenon in the ''Vegetable Staticks'' in 1722. In the last two decades of the eighteenth century, as more gases were being discovered and the techniques and instruments of pneumatic chemistry became more sophisticated, a number of natural philosophers and engineers thought about using gases in medical and industrial applications. One of the first such uses was [[Balloon (aircraft)|ballooning]] beginning in 1783, but other uses soon followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gyung Kim|first=Mi Gyung|title=‘Public’ Science: Hydrogen Balloons and Lavoisier's Decomposition of Water|journal=Annals of Science|date=March 2006|volume=63|issue=3|pages=291–318|doi=10.1080/00033790600610494}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the results of the ballooning craze of 1783–1784 was the first implementation of lighting by manufactured gas. A professor of natural philosophy at the [[Old University of Leuven|University of Louvain]] [[Jan Pieter Minckeleers]] and two of his colleagues were asked by their patron, the Duke of [[Arenberg]], to investigate ballooning. They did so, building apparatus to generate lighter than air inflammable gases from coal and other inflammable substances. In 1785 Minckeleers used some of this apparatus to gasify coal to light his lecture hall at the university. He did not extend gas lighting much beyond this, and when he was forced to flee Leuven during the [[Brabant Revolution]], he abandoned the project altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jaspers|first=P. A. Th. M.|author2=J. Roegiers|authorlink2=Jan Roegiers|title=Le "Mémoire sur l'air inflammable" de Jean-Pierre Minckelers (1748 - 1824): édition critique d'après les manuscrits et l'édition originale de 1784|journal=Lias|year=1983|volume=10|pages=217–252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Philippe LeBon and the Thermolamp ===
[[File:Philippe Lebon.png|thumb|right|Philippe LeBon]]
[[File:Ecyclopedie Roret Lebon oven.png|left|LeBon's thermolamp, from his patent (1799 and 1801)|thumb]]
[[Philippe LeBon]] was a French civil engineer working in the public engineering corps who became interested while at university in distillation as an industrial process for the manufacturing of materials such as tar and oil. He graduated from the engineering school in 1789, and was assigned to Angoulême. There, he investigated distillation, and became aware that the gas produced in the distillation of wood and coal could be useful for lighting, heating, and as an energy source in engines. He took out a patent for distillation processes in 1794, and continued his research, eventually designing a distillation oven known as the ''thermolamp''. He applied for and received a patent for this invention in 1799, with an addition in 1801. He launched a marketing campaign in Paris in 1801 by printing a pamphlet and renting a house where he put on public demonstrations with his apparatus.  His goal was to raise sufficient funds from investors to launch a company, but he failed to attract this sort of interest, either from the French state or from private sources. He was forced to abandon the project and return to the civil engineering corps. Although he was given a forest concession by the French government to experiment with the manufacture of tar from wood for naval use, he never succeed with the thermolamp, and died in uncertain circumstances in 1805.&lt;ref&gt;Veillerette, François. ''Philippe Lebon ou l'homme aux mains de lumière'', Ed N Mourot, 1987. ''(in french)''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the thermolamp received some interest in France, in Germany interest was the greatest. A number of books and articles were written on the subject in the period 1802–1812. There were also thermolamps designed and built in Germany, the most important of which were by Zachaus Winzler, an Austrian chemist who ran a saltpetre factory in Blansko. Under the patronage of the aristocratic zu Salm family, he built a large one in Brno. He moved to Vienna to further his work. The thermolamp, however, was used primarily for making charcoal and not for the production of gases.&lt;ref&gt;Elton, Arthur (1958), "Gas for light and heat" in ''A History of Technology'' Volume IV The Industrial Revolution c 1750 to c 1850, edited Charles Singer, et al, Clarendon, Oxford {{ISBN|978-019858108-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=HalvaDenk|first=Helma|title=Bedeutende Südmährer|url=http://www.suedmaehren.eu/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=21|accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== William Murdock and Boulton &amp; Watt ===
[[File:William Murdoch (1754-1839).jpg|left|thumb|William Murdock]]
[[William Murdoch]] (sometimes Murdock) (1754–1839) was an engineer working for the firm of [[Boulton &amp; Watt]], when, while investigating distillation processes sometime in 1792–1794, he began using coal gas for illumination. He was living in [[Redruth]] in Cornwall at the time, and made some small scale experiments with lighting his own house with coal gas. He soon dropped the subject until 1798, when he moved to [[Birmingham]] to work at Boulton &amp; Watt's home base of [[Soho, Birmingham|Soho]]. Boulton &amp; Watt then instigated another small-scale series of experiments. With ongoing patent litigation and their main business of steam engines to attend to, the subject was dropped once again. Gregory Watt, James Watt's second son, while traveling in Europe saw Lebon's demonstrations and wrote a letter to his brother, [[James Watt Jr.]], informing him of this potential competitor. This prompted James Watt Jr. to begin a gaslight development program at Boulton &amp; Watt that would scale up the technology and lead to the first commercial applications of gaslight.&lt;ref name = "fred"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chandler|first=Dean|title=The rise of the gas industry in Britain|year=1949|publisher=British Gas Council|location=London|author2=A Douglas Lacey}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Griffiths"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Griffiths |first1=John |title= The Third Man, The Life and Times of William Murdoch 1754-1839|year=1992 |publisher=Andre Deutsch |location=London |isbn= 0-233-98778-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After an initial installation at the [[Soho Foundry]] in 1803–1804, Boulton &amp; Watt prepared an apparatus for the textile firm of Philips &amp; Lee in Salford near Manchester in 1805–1806. This was to be their only major sale until late 1808. [[George Augustus Lee]] was a major motivating force behind the development of the apparatus. He had an avid interest in technology, and had introduced a series of technological innovations at the Salford Mill, such as iron frame construction and steam heating. He continued to encourage the development of gaslight technology at Boulton &amp; Watt.&lt;ref name = "fred" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Griffiths"/&gt;

=== Winsor and the Gas Light and Coke Company ===
[[File:A Peep at the Gas Lights in Pall Mall Rowlandson 1809.jpg|thumb|''A Peep at the Gas-lights in Pall Mall'': A contemporary caricature of Winsor's lighting of Pall Mall, by George Rowlandson (1809)]]

The first company to provide manufactured gas to consumer as a utility was the London-based [[Gas Light and Coke Company]]. It was founded through the efforts of a German émigré, [[Frederick Albert Winsor|Frederick Winsor]], who had witnessed Lebon's demonstrations in Paris. He had tried unsuccessfully to purchase a thermolamp from Lebon, but remained taken with the technology, and decided to try his luck, first in his hometown of [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]], and then in London in 1804. Once in London, Winsor began an intense campaign to find investors for a new company that would manufacture gas apparatus and sell gas to consumers. He was successful in finding investors, but the legal form of the company was a more difficult problem. By the [[Bubble Act]] of 1720, all [[joint-stock companies]] above a certain number of shareholders in England needed to receive a [[royal charter]] to incorporate, which meant that an act of Parliament was required.

Winsor waged his campaign intermittently to 1807, when the investors constituted a committee charged with obtaining an act of Parliament. They pursued this task over the next three years, encountering adversities en route, the most important of which was the resistance by Boulton &amp; Watt in 1809. In that year, the committee made a serious attempt to get the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] to pass a bill empowering the king to grant the charter, but Boulton &amp; Watt felt their gaslight apparatus manufacturing business was threatened and mounted an opposition through their allies in Parliament. Although a parliamentary committee recommended approval, it was defeated on the third reading.

The following year, the committee tried again, succeeding with the acquiescence of Boulton &amp; Watt because they renounced all powers to manufacture apparatus for sale. The act required that the company raise £100,000 before they could request a charter, a condition it took the next two years to fill. [[George III]] granted the charter in 1812.

== Manufactured gas 1812–1825 ==

=== Manufactured gas in England ===
[[File:Gas plant Accum (1815).JPEG|thumb|right|A coloured plate of a gas plant from [[Frederick Accum]]'s ''A Practical Treatise on Gas-light'' (1815)]]
From 1812 to approximately 1825, manufactured gas was predominantly an English technology. A number of new gas utilities were founded to serve London and other cities in the UK after 1812. Liverpool, Exeter, and Preston were the first in 1816. Others soon followed; by 1821, no town with population over 50,000 was without gaslight. Five years later, there were only two towns over 10,000 that were without gaslight.&lt;ref name=Falkus&gt;{{cite journal|last=Falkus|first=M. E.|title=The British Gas Industry before 1850|journal=The Economic History Review|date=December 1967|volume=20|issue=3|pages=494–508|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0289.1967.tb00150.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In London, the growth of gaslight was rapid. New companies were founded within a few years of the Gas Light and Coke Company, and a period of intense competition followed as companies competed for consumers on the boundaries of their respective zones of operations. [[Frederick Accum]], in the various editions of his book on gaslight, gives a good sense of how rapidly the technology spread in the capital. In 1815, he wrote that there were 4000 lamps in the city, served by 26&amp;nbsp;miles (42&amp;nbsp;km) of mains. In 1819, he raised his estimate to 51,000 lamps and 288&amp;nbsp;miles (463&amp;nbsp;km) of mains. Likewise, there were only two gasworks in London in 1814, and by 1822, there were seven and by 1829, there were 200 companies.&lt;ref name = "fred" /&gt;{{rp|72}} The government did not regulate the industry as a whole until 1816, when an act of Parliament created and a post of inspector for gasworks, the first holder of which was [[Sir William Congreve, 2nd Baronet|Sir William Congreve]]. Even then, no laws were passed regulating the entire industry until 1847, although a bill was proposed in 1822, which failed due to opposition from gas companies.&lt;ref name = "fred" /&gt;{{rp|83}} The charters approved by Parliament did, however, contain various regulations such as how the companies could break up the pavement, etc.

=== Manufactured gas in Europe and North America ===
France's first gas company was also promoted by Frederick Winsor after he had to flee England in 1814 due to unpaid debts and tried to found another gas company in Paris, but it failed in 1819. The government was also interested in promoting the industry, and in 1817 commissioned Chabrol de Volvic to study the technology and build a prototype plant, also in Paris. The plant provided gas for lighting the hôpital Saint Louis, and the experiment was judged successful.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Williot, Naissance d'un service public: le gaz a Paris, Rive droite-Institu d'histoire de l'industrie, 1999, p. 29-30&lt;/ref&gt; [[King Louis XVIII]] then decided to give further impulse to the development of the French industry by sending people to England to study the situation there, and to install gaslight at a number of prestigious buildings, such as the Opera building, the national library, etc. A public company was created for this purpose in 1818.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Williot, Naissance d'un service public: le gaz a Paris, Rive droite-Institu d'histoire de l'industrie, 1999, p. 33-4&lt;/ref&gt; Private companies soon followed, and by 1822, when the government moved to regulate the industry, there were four in operation in the capital. The regulations passed then prevented the companies from competing, and Paris was effectively divided between the various companies operating as monopolies in their own zones.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Williot, Naissance d'un service public: le gaz a Paris, Rive droite-Institu d'histoire de l'industrie, 1999, p. 47-8&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaslight spread to other European countries. In 1817, a company was founded in Brussels by P. J. Meeus-Van der Maelen, and began operating the following year. By 1822, there were companies in Amsterdam and Rotterdam using English technology.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Körting, Geschichte der Deutschen Gasindustrie mit Vorgeschichte und bestimmenden Einflǜssen des Auslandes, Vulkan, 1963, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany, gaslight was used on a small scale from 1816 onwards, but the first gaslight utility was founded by English engineers and capital. In 1824, the [[Imperial Continental Gas Association]] was founded in London to establish gas utilities in other countries. Sir William Congreve, one if its leaders, signed an agreement with the government in Hanover, and the gas lamps were used on streets for the first time in 1826.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Körting, Geschichte der Deutschen Gasindustrie mit Vorgeschichte und bestimmenden Einflǜssen des Auslandes, Vulkan, 1963, p. 104-5, 107&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaslight was first introduced to the US in 1816 in Baltimore by [[Rembrandt Peale|Rembrandt]] and Rubens Peale, who lit their museum with gaslight, which they had seen on a trip to Europe. The brothers convinced a group of wealthy people to back them in a larger enterprise. The local government passed a law allowing the Peales and their associates to lay mains and light the streets. A company was incorporated for this purpose in 1817. After some difficulties with the apparatus and financial problems, the company hired an English engineer with experience in gaslight. It began to flourish, and by the 1830s, the company was supplying gas to 3000 domestic customers and 100 street lamps.&lt;ref&gt;David P. Erlick, "The Peales and Gas Lights in Baltimore", Maryland Historical Magazine, 80, 9-18(1985)&lt;/ref&gt; Companies in other cities followed, the second being Boston Gas Light in 1822 and New York Gas Light Company in 1825.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Makholm|first=Jeff D.|title="Decoupling" For Energy Distributors: Changing 19th Century Tariff Structures To Address 21st Century Energy Markets|journal=Energy Law Journal|year=2008|volume=29|pages=157–172|url=http://www.nera.com/extImage/PUB_Decoupling_May2008.pdf|accessdate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A gas works was built in Philadelphia in 1835.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Public Works In The United States Of America|year=1841|publisher=John Weale|location=London|pages=1–85|editor=William Strickland, Edward H Gill and Henry R.

==Legal, regulatory, environmental, health, and safety aspects of gas manufacture==
Gas lighting was one of the most debated technologies of the first industrial revolution. In Paris, as early as 1823, controversy forced the government to devise safety standards (Fressoz, 2007). The residues produced from distilled coal were either drained into rivers or stored in basins which polluted (and still pollute) the soil.

[[Case law]] in the UK and the US clearly held though, the construction and operation of a gas-works was not the creation of a public nuisance ''in se'', due to the reputation of gas-works as highly undesirable neighbors, and the noxious pollution known to issue from such, especially in the early days of manufactured gas, gas-works were on extremely short notice from the courts that (detectable) contamination outside of their grounds – especially in residential districts – would be severely frowned upon. Indeed, many actions for the abatement of [[nuisance]]s brought before the courts did result in unfavorable verdicts for gas manufacturers – in one study on early environmental law, actions for nuisance involving gas-works resulted in findings for the plaintiffs 80% of the time, compared with an overall plaintiff victory rate of 28.5% in industrial nuisance cases.&lt;ref name="Nuisance - Rosen."&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosen|first=Christine Meisner|date=October 2003|title='Knowing' Industrial Pollution: Nuisance Law and the Power of Tradition in a Time of Rapid Economic Change, 1840–1864.|journal=Environmental History|publisher=History Cooperative|volume=8|issue=4|issn=1084-5453|url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/eh/8.4/rosen.html|accessdate=January 19, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305015413/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/eh/8.4/rosen.html|archivedate=March 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Injunction]]s both preliminary and permanent could and were often issued in cases involving gas works. For example, the ill reputation of gas-works became so well known that in ''City of Cleveland vs. Citizens' Gas Light Co.'', [[case citation|20 N. J. Eq. 201]], a court went so far as to enjoin a ''future'' gas-works not yet even built – preventing it from causing ''annoying and offensive vapours and odors'' in the first place. The injunction not only regulated the gas manufacturing process – forbidding the use of lime purification – but also provided that if nuisances of any sort were to issue from the works – a permanent injunction forbidding the production of gas would issue from the court.&lt;ref name="ClevelandWorks - Injunction"&gt;{{cite book|last=McKinney|first=Wm. Mark|author2=Mitchie, Thos.

Taylor'', [[Case citation|10 Beavan 80]], that ''I have been rather astonished to hear the effects of gas works treated as nothing...every man, in these days, must have sufficient experience, to enable him to come to the conclusion, that, whether a nuisance or not, a gas manufactory is a very disagreeable thing. Nobody can doubt that the volatile products which arise from the distillation of coal are extremely offensive. It is quite contrary to common experience to say they are not so...every man knows it.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1905|title=The English Reports (Rolls III: Bevan 8 – 12)|publisher=Wm. Green and Sons; Stevens &amp; Sons, Ltd.|location=Edinburgh, Scotland; London, England|volume=L|page=513|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QUYwAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=January 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, as time went by, gas-works began to be seen as more as a double-edged sword – and eventually as a positive good, as former nuisances were abated by technological improvements, and the full benefits of gas became clear. There were several major impetuses that drove this phenomenon:

*regulation of pollution from gas-works (in the case of the UK, with the passage of the Gas-works Clauses Act 1847), which increased the cost of pollution, previously being near zero, leading to the development of technologies that abated the ongoing pollution nuisances (in many cases, turning discarded former pollutants into profitable by-products);
*the rise of the "smoke nuisance" in the 1850s, brought about by the domestic and commercial use of coal, in many cities and metropolises; direct combustion of coal being a particularly notorious source of pollution; which the widespread use of gas could abate, especially with the commencement of using gas for purposes other than illuminating during the 1870s; for cooking, for the heating of dwelling-houses, for making domestic hot water, for raising steam, for industrial and chemical purposes, and for stationary internal combustion engine-driving purposes – which were previously met by employing coal;
*the development of high-pressure gas mains, and compressors (1900s); these were capable of efficiently transporting gas over long distances, allowing one manufactured gas plant to supply a relatively large area – leading to the concentration of gas-manufacturing operations, instead of their geographic distribution; this resulted in gas-works being able to be located away from residential and commercial districts, where their presence could result in discomfort and concern for the inhabitants thereof;

Both the era of consolidation of gas-works through high-pressure distribution systems (1900s–1930s) and the end of the era of manufactured gas (1955–1975) saw gas-works being shut down due to redundancies. What brought about the end of manufactured gas was that pipelines began to be built to bring natural gas directly from the well to gas distribution systems. Natural gas was superior to the manufactured gas of that time, being cheaper – extracted from wells rather than manufactured in a gas-works – more user friendly – coming from the well requiring little, if any, purification – and safer – due to the lack of carbon monoxide in the distributed product. Upon being shut down, few former manufactured gas plant sites were brought to an acceptable level of environmental cleanliness to allow for their re-use, at least by contemporary standards. In fact, many were literally abandoned in place, with process wastes left ''in situ'', and never adequately disposed of.

As the wastes produced by former manufactured gas plants were persistent in nature, they often (as of 2009) still contaminate the site of former manufactured gas plants: the waste causing the most concern today is primarily coal tar (mixed long-chain aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons, a byproduct of coal carbonization), while "blue billy" (a noxious byproduct of lime purification contaminated with cyanides) as well as other lime and coal tar residues are regarded as lesser, though significant environmental hazards. Some former manufactured gas plants are owned by gas utilities today, often in an effort to prevent contaminated land from falling into public use, and inadvertently causing the release of the wastes therein contained. Others have fallen into public use, and without proper reclamation, have caused – often severe – health hazards for their users. When and where necessary, former manufactured gas plants are subject to [[environmental remediation]] laws, and can be subject to legally mandated cleanups.

{{further|Gasworks}} 
[[File:Retorts horizontal view Peckston 1819.png|thumb|right|Horizontal view of a retort and furnace (1819)]]

The basic design of gaslight apparatus was established by Boulton &amp; Watt and [[Samuel Clegg]] in the period 1805–1812. Further improvements were made at the Gas Light and Coke Company, as well as by the growing number of gas engineers such as John Malam and Thomas Peckston after 1812. Boulton &amp; Watt contributed the basic design of the retort, condenser, and gasometer, while Clegg improved the gasometer and introduced lime purification and the hydraulic main, another purifier.

===Retort bench===
The '''retort bench''' was the construction in which the retorts were located for the carbonization (synonymous with pyrolysis) of the coal feedstock and the evolution of coal gas. Over the years of manufactured gas production, advances were made that turned the retort-bench from little more than coal-containing iron vessels over an open fire to a massive, highly efficient, partially automated, industrial-scale, capital-intensive plant for the carbonization of large amounts of coal. Several retort benches were usually located in a single "retort house", which there was at least one of in every gas works.

Initially, retort benches were of many different configurations due to the lack of long use and scientific and practical understanding of the carbonization of coal. Some early retorts were little more than iron vessels filled with coal and thrust upon a coal fire with pipes attached to their top ends. Though practical for the earliest gas works, this quickly changed once the early gas-works served more than a few customers. As the size of such vessels grew – the need became apparent for efficiency in refilling retorts – and it was apparent that filling one-ended vertical retorts was easy; removing the coke and residues from them after the carbonization of coal was far more difficult. Hence, gas retorts transitioned from vertical vessels to horizontal tubular vessels.

Retorts were usually made of cast iron during the early days. Early gas engineers experimented extensively with the best shape, size, and setting. No one form of retort dominated, and many different cross-sections remained in use. After the 1850s, retorts generally became made of fire clay due to greater heat retention, greater durability, and other positive qualities. Cast-iron retorts were used in small gas works, due to their compatibility with the demands there, with the cast-iron retort's lower cost, ability to heat quickly to meet transient demand, and "plug and play" replacement capabilities. This outweighed the disadvantages of shorter life, lower temperature margins, and lack of ability to be manufactured in non-cylindrical shapes. Also, general gas-works practice following the switch to fire-clay retorts favored retorts that were shaped like a "D" turned 90 degrees to the left, sometimes with a slightly pitched bottom section.

With the introduction of the fire-clay retort, higher heats could be held in the retort benches, leading to faster and more complete carbonization of the coal. As higher heats became possible, advanced methods of retort bench firing were introduced, catalyzed by the development of the [[open hearth furnace]] by [[Carl Wilhelm Siemens|Siemens]], circa 1855–1870, leading to a revolution in gas-works efficiency.

[[File:MeadeMdnGswksPracIsometricRegenerativeBench.png|thumb|right|Isometric view of a regenerative retort bench (1921)]]

Specifically, the two major advances were:

*The introduction of the "indirectly fired" retort bench. The early "directly fired" retort bench consisted of retorts suspended over a coke fire, which heated the retorts and drove the carbonization of coal within to coke, and the evolution of gas. The introduction of indirect firing changed this. Instead of the retorts being heated directly by fire – the fire was placed a ways below and to one side of the retorts, brought to a very high heat, while the air supply was reduced and a small amount of steam introduced. Instead of evolving large quantities of heat to directly heat the retorts, the fire now evolved heated gasses – specifically carbon monoxide and due to the steam, a small amount of hydrogen as well, which are both highly combustible. These gasses rise from the fire into a channel which brings them to the "[[tuyere]]s" – small holes similar to "nostrils", located adjacent to the retorts, which shoot the "furnace-gasses" out of them. Adjacent "tuyeres" emit a large amount of "secondary air", which is preheated air, that, upon mixing with the furnace gasses, causes them to ignite and burst into flame and bathe the exterior of the retorts in heat.
*The introduction of heat recuperation for the preheating of the air of primary and secondary combustion. By causing the exhaust of the retort-bench to pass through a maze of refractory brickwork, substantial quantities of heat can be extracted from it. On the other side of the exhaust channels are channels for the passage of the air of combustion. The bricks thus transfer the heat of the exhaust to the air of combustion, preheating it. This provides for a much greater degree of thermal efficiency in the retort-bench, causing it to be able to use far less coke, since air that is preheated by waste heat is already hot when it enters the fire to be burnt, or the "tuyere" to fuel secondary combustion.
These two advances turned the old, "directly fired" retort bench into the advanced, "indirectly fired", "regenerative" or "generative" retort bench, and lead coke usage within the retort benches (in the larger works) to drop from upwards of 40% of the coke made by the retorts to factors as low as 15% of the coke made by the retorts, leading to an improvement in efficiency of an order of magnitude. These improvements imparted an additional capital cost to the retort bench, which caused them to be slowly incorporated in the smaller gas-works, if they were incorporated at all.

Further increases in efficiency and safety were seen with the introduction of the "through" retort, which had a door at front and rear. This provided for greater efficiency and safety in loading and unloading the retorts, which was a labor-intensive and often dangerous process. Coal could now be pushed out of the retort – rather than pulled out of the retort. One interesting modification of the "through" retort was the "inclined" retort – coming into its heyday in the 1880s – a retort set on a moderate incline, where coal was poured in at one end, and the retort sealed; following pyrolysis, the bottom was opened and the coke poured out by gravity. This was adopted in some gas-works, but the savings in labor were often offset by the uneven distribution and pyrolysis of the coal as well as clumping problems leading to failure of the coal to pour out of the bottom following pyrolysis that were exacerbated in certain coal types. As such, inclined retorts were rendered obsolescent by later advances, including the retort-handling machine and the vertical retort system.

Several advanced retort-house appliances were introduced for improved efficiency and convenience. The compressed-air or steam-driven clinkering pick was found to be especially useful in removing clinker from the primary combustion area of the indirectly fired benches – previously clinkering was an arduous and time-consuming process that used large amounts of retort house labor. Another class of appliances introduced were apparatuses – and ultimately, machines – for retort loading and unloading. Retorts were generally loaded by using an elongated scoop, into which the coal was loaded – a gang of men would then lift the scoop and ram it into the retort. The coal would then be raked by the men into a layer of even thickness and the retort sealed. Gas production would then ensue – and from 8 – 12 hours later, the retort would be opened, and the coal would be either pulled (in the case of "stop-ended" retorts) or pushed (in the case of "through" retorts) out of the retort. Thus, the retort house had heavy manpower requirements – as many men were often required to bear the coal-containing scoop and load the retort.

''(TBD: Brief description of advanced retort loading apparatus; more detailed description of retort-handling machine.)''

''Coming soon: The introduction of the coke-oven system, and, finally, the vertical retort system.''

===Other Gas-Works facilities===

From the retort, the gas would first pass through a tar/water "trap" (similar to a trap in plumbing) called a hydraulic main, where a considerable fraction of coal tar was given up and the gas was significantly cooled. Then, it would pass through the main out of the retort house into an atmospheric or water-cooled condenser, where it would be cooled to the temperature of the atmosphere or the water used. At this point, it enters the exhauster house and passes through an "exhauster", an air pump which maintains the hydraulic mains and, consequently, the retorts at a negative pressure (with a zero pressure being atmospheric). It would then be washed in a "washer" by bubbling it through water, to extract any remaining tars. After this, it would enter a purifier. The gas would then be ready for distribution, and pass into a gasholder for storage.

====Hydraulic main====
[[File:HydraulicMain.png|thumb|right|Cross section of a hydraulic main (1909)]]

Within each retort-house, the retort benches would be lined up next to one another in a long row. Each retort had a loading and unloading door. Affixed to each door was an ascension pipe, to carry off the gas as it was evolved from the coal within. These pipes would rise to the top of the bench where they would terminate in an inverted "U" with the leg of the "U" disappearing into a long, trough-shaped structure (with a covered top) made of cast iron called a hydraulic main that was placed atop the row of benches near their front edge. It ran continuously along the row of benches within the retort house, and each ascension pipe from each retort descended into it.

The hydraulic main had a level of a liquid mixture of (initially) water, but, following use, also coal tar, and ammoniacal liquor. Each retort ascension pipe dropped under the water level by at least a small amount, perhaps by an inch, but often considerably more in the earlier days of gas manufacture. The gas evolved from each retort would thus bubble through the liquid and emerge from it into the void above the liquid, where it would mix with the gas evolved from the other retorts and be drawn off through the foul main to the condenser.

There were two purposes to the liquid seal: first, to draw off some of the tar and liquor, as the gas from the retort was laden with tar, and the hydraulic main could rid the gas of it, to a certain degree; further tar removal would take place in the condenser, washer/scrubber, and the tar extractor. Still, there would be less tar to deal with later. Second, the liquid seal also provided defense against air being drawn into the hydraulic main: if the main had no liquid within, and a retort was left open with the pipe not shut off, and air were to combine with the gas, the main could explode, along with nearby benches.

However, after the early years of gas, research proved that a very deep, excessive seal on the hydraulic main threw a backpressure upon all the retorts as the coal within was gasifying, and this had deleterious consequences; carbon would likely deposit onto the insides of retorts and ascension pipes; and the bottom layer of tar with which the gas would have to travel through in a deeply sealed main robbed the gas of some of its illuminating value. As such, after the 1860s, hydraulic mains were run at around 1&amp;nbsp;inch of seal, and no more.

Later retort systems (many types of vertical retorts, especially ones in continuous operation) which had other anti-oxygen safeguards, such as check valves, etc., as well as larger retorts, often omitted the hydraulic main entirely and went straight to the condensers – as other apparatus and buildings could be used for tar extraction, the main was unnecessary for these systems.

Condensers were either air cooled or water cooled. Air cooled condensers were often made up from odd lengths of pipe and connections. The main varieties in common use were classified as follows:

[[File:Horizontal Condensers.JPG|thumb|Horizontal Air Cooled Condenser]]
(a) Horizontal types 
[[File:Vertical Condensers.JPG|thumb|Vertical Air Cooled Condenser]]
(b) Vertical types
[[File:Annular Condensers.JPG|thumb|Annular Air Cooled Condenser]]
(c) Annular types 
[[File:Battery Condenser.JPG|thumb|Battery Air Cooled Condenser]]
(d) The battery condenser.

The horizontal condenser was an extended foul main with the pipe in a zigzag pattern from end to end of one of the retort-house walls. Flange connections were essential as blockages from naphthalene or pitchy deposits were likely to occur. The condensed liquids flowed down the sloping pipes in the same direction as the gas. As long as gas flow was slow, this was an effective method for the removal of naphthalene. Vertical air condensers had gas and tar outlets.

The annular atmospheric condenser was easier to control with respect to cooling rates. The gas in the tall vertical cylinders was annular in form and allowed an inside and outside surface to be exposed to cooling air. The diagonal side pipes conveyed the warm gas to the upper ends of each annular cylinder. Butterfly valves or dampers were fitted to the top of each vertical air pipe, so that the amount of cooling could be regulated.

The battery condenser was a long and narrow box divided internally by baffle-plates which cause the gas to take a circuitous course. The width of the box was usually about 2 feet, and small tubes passed from side to side form the chief cooling surface. The ends of these tubes were left open to allow air to pass through. The obstruction caused by the tubes played a role in breaking up and throwing down the tars suspended in the gas.

Typically, plants using cast-iron mains and apparatus allowed 5 square feet of superficial area per 1,000 cubic feet of gas made per day. This could be slightly reduced when wrought iron or mild steel was used.&lt;ref&gt;Alwyne Meade, Modern Gasworks Practice, D. Van Nostrand Company, New York, 1916, pages 286-291&lt;/ref&gt;

Water Cooled Condensers

Water cooled condensers were almost constructed from riveted mild steel plates (which form the outer shell) and steel or wrought-iron tubes. There were two distinct types used: 
[[File:Tubular Condenser.JPG|thumb|Water Cooled Tubular Condensers]]
(a) Multitubular condensers. 
[[File:Typical Water Tube Condenser.JPG|thumb|Water Tube Condenser]]  
(b) Water-tube condensers.

Unless the cooling water was exceptionally clean, the water-tube condenser was preferred. The major difference between the multitubular and water-tube condenser was that in the former the water passed outside and around the tubes which carry the hot gas, and in the latter type, the opposite was the case. Thus when only muddy water pumped from rivers or canals was available; the water-tube condenser was used. When the incoming gas was particularly dirty and contained an undesirable quantity of heavy tar, the outer chamber was liable to obstruction from this cause.

The hot gas was saturated with water vapor and accounted for the largest portion of the total work of condensation. Water vapor has to lose large quantities of heat, as did any liquefiable hydrocarbon. Of the total work of condensation, 87% was accounted for in removing water vapor and the remainder was used to cool permanent gases and to condensing liquefiable hydrocarbon.&lt;ref&gt;Alwyne Meade, Modern Gasworks Practice, D. Van Nostrand Company, New York, 1916, pages 291-292&lt;/ref&gt;

As extremely finely divided particles were also suspended in the gas, it was impossible to separate the particulate matter solely by a reduction of vapor pressure. The gas underwent processes to remove all traces of solid or liquid matter before it reached the wet purification plant. Centrifugal separators, such as the Colman Cyclone apparatus were utilized for this process in some plants.[[File:Colman Centrifugal Separator.JPG|thumb|Colman "Cyclone" Separator]]

The hydrocarbon condensates removed in the order heavy tars, medium tars and finally light tars and oil fog.  About 60-65% of the tars would be deposited in the hydraulic main. Most of this tar was heavy tars.  The medium tars condensed out during the passage of the products between the hydraulic and the condenser. The lighter tars oil fog would travel considerably further.

In general, the temperature of the gas in the hydraulic main varies between 140-160&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; F. The constituents most liable to be lost were benzene, toluene, and, to some extent, xylene, which had an important effect on the ultimate illuminating power of the gas. Tars were detrimental for the illuminating power and were isolated from the gas as rapidly as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Alwyne Meade, Modern Gasworks Practice, D. Van Nostrand Company, New York, 1916, pages 296-299&lt;/ref&gt;

====Exhauster====

Maintained hydraulic main and condenser at negative pressure.

There were several types of exhausters.

*The steam ''ejector''/aspirator type exhauster used a substantial steam jet/venturi to maintain the negative pressure in the hydraulic main and condenser. This type of exhauster was mechanically simple, had no moving parts, and thus, had virtually no potential to fail. However, it consumed a comparatively large amount of steam. Often used as a backup exhauster; in this role it continued as a reliable backup until the end of the age of manufactured gas.
*Reciprocating exhausters of various types. Steam engine-driven exhauster used cylinder pump to pump gas. Relatively reliable, but inefficient, using large quantities of steam, but less than the ejector type exhauster. Used in the early days of exhausters, but quickly obsoleted.
*Blower-type exhauster.
*Turboexhauster.

[[File:Interior Diagram Bubbling Washer.JPG|thumb|Bubbling Washer for Ammonia Removal]]
Scrubbers which utilized water were designed in the 25 years after the foundation of the industry.  It was discovered that the removal of ammonia from the gas depended upon the way in which the gas to be purified was contacted by water. This was found to be best performed by the Tower Scrubber. This scrubber consisted of a tall cylindrical vessel, which contained trays or bricks which were supported on grids. The water, or weak gas liquor, trickled over these trays, thereby keeping the exposed surfaces thoroughly wetted.  The gas to be purified was run through the tower to be contacted with the liquid. In 1846 George Lowe patented a device with revolving perforated pipes for supplying water or purifying liquor. At a later date, the Rotary Washer Scrubber was introduced by Paddon, who used it at Brighton about 1870. This prototype machine was followed by others of improved construction ; notably by Kirkham, Hulett, and Chandler, who introduced the well-known Standard Washer Scrubber, Holmes, of Huddersfield, and others. The Tower Scrubber and the Rotary Washer Scrubber made it possible to completely remove ammonia from the gas.&lt;ref name = "fred" /&gt;

====Purifier====
Coal gas coming directly from the bench was a noxious soup of chemicals, and removal of the most deleterious fractions was important, for improving the quality of the gas, for preventing damage to equipment or premises, and for recovering revenues from the sale of the extracted chemicals. Several offensive fractions being present in a distributed gas might lead to problems – [[Coal tar|Tar]] in the distributed gas might gum up the pipes (and could be sold for a good price), [[ammonia|ammoniacal vapours]] in the gas might lead to corrosion problems (and the extracted ammonium sulfate was a decent fertilizer), [[naphthalene|naphthalene vapours]] in the gas might stop up the gas-mains, and even [[carbon dioxide]] in the gas was known to decrease illumination; thus various facilities within the gas-works were tasked with the removal of these deleterious effluents. But these do not compare to the most hazardous contaminant in the raw coal gas: the sulfuret of hydrogen ([[hydrogen sulfide]], H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S). This was regarded as utterly unacceptable for several reasons:
# The gas would smell rankly of rotten eggs when burnt;
# The gas-works and adjacent district would smell of rotten eggs when the gas-works was producing gas;
# The gas, upon burning, would form [[sulfur dioxide]], which would be quickly oxidized to [[sulfur trioxide]], and subsequently would react with the water vapor produced by combustion to form [[sulfuric acid]] vapour. In a dwelling-house, this could lead to the formation of irritating, poisonous and corrosive atmospheres where and when burnt.
# Manufactured gas was originally distributed in the well-to-do districts, as such were low-hanging fruit for the gas utility. Such persons were of a class known to possess silver goods of varying sorts. If exposed to a sulfurous atmosphere, silver tarnishes – and a sulfurous atmosphere would undoubtedly be present in any house lit with sulfuretted gas.

As such, the removal of the sulfuret of hydrogen was given the highest level of priority in the gas-works. A special facility existed to extract the sulfuret of hydrogen – known as the purifier.  The purifier was arguably the most important facility in the gas-works, if the retort-bench itself is not included.

Originally, purifiers were simple tanks of lime-water, also known as cream or milk of lime,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Newbigging, "Handbook for Gas Engineers and Managers", 8th Edition, Walter King, London, 1913, page 150&lt;/ref&gt; where the raw gas from the retort bench was bubbled through to remove the sulfuret of hydrogen. This original process of purification was known as the "wet lime" process. The lime residue left over from the "wet lime" process was one of the first true "toxic wastes", a material called "[[blue billy]]". Originally, the waste of the purifier house was flushed into a nearby body of water, such as a river or a canal. However, after fish kills, the nauseating way it made the rivers stink, and the truly horrendous stench caused by exposure of residuals if the river was running low, the public clamoured for better means of disposal. Thus it was piled into heaps for disposal. Some enterprising gas entrepreneurs tried to sell it as a weed-killer, but most people wanted nothing to do with it, and generally, it was regarded as waste which was both smelly and poisonous, and gas-works could do little with, except bury. But this was not the end of the "blue billy", for after burying it, rain would often fall upon its burial site, and leach the poison and stench from the buried waste, which could drain into fields or streams. Following countless fiascoes with "blue billy" contaminating the environment, a furious public, aided by courts, juries, judges, and masters in chancery, were often very willing to demand that the gas-works seek other methods of purification – and even pay for the damages caused by their old methods of purification.

This led to the development of the "dry lime" purification process, which was less effective than the "wet lime" process, but had less toxic consequences. Still, it was quite noxious. Slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) was placed in thick layers on trays which were then inserted into a square or cylinder-shaped purifier tower which gas was then passed through, from the bottom to the top. After the charge of slaked lime had lost most of its absorption effectiveness, the purifier was then shut off from the flow of gas, and either was opened, or air was piped in. Immediately, the sulfur-impregnated slaked lime would react with the air to liberate large concentrations of sulfuretted hydrogen, which would then billow out of the purifier house, and make the gas-works, and the district, stink of sulfuretted hydrogen. Though toxic in sufficient concentrations or long exposures, the sulfuret was generally just nauseating for short exposures at moderate concentrations, and was merely a health hazard (as compared to the outright danger of "blue billy") for the gas-works employees and the neighbors of the gas-works. The sulfuretted lime was not toxic, but not greatly wanted, slightly stinking of the odor of the sulfuret, and was spread as a low grade fertilizer, being impregnated with ammonia to some degree. The outrageous stinks from many gas-works led many citizens to regard them as public nuisances, and attracted the eye of regulators, neighbors, and courts.

The "gas nuisance" was finally solved by the "iron ore" process. Enterprising gas-works engineers discovered that bog iron ore could be used to remove the sulfuretted hydrogen from the gas, and not only could it be used for such, but it could be used in the purifier, exposed to the air, whence it would be rejuvenated, without emitting noxious sulfuretted hydrogen gas, the sulfur being retained in the iron ore. Then it could be reinserted into the purifier, and reused and rejuvenated multiple times, until it was thoroughly embedded with sulfur. It could then be sold to the sulfuric acid works for a small profit. Lime was sometimes still used after the iron ore had thoroughly removed the sulfuret of hydrogen, to remove carbonic acid (carbon dioxide, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), the bisulfuret of carbon ([[carbon disulfide]], CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and any ammonia still aeroform after its travels through the works. But it was not made noxious as before, and usually could fetch a decent rate as fertilizer when impregnated with ammonia. This finally solved the greatest pollution nuisances of the gas-works, but still lesser problems remained – not any that the purifier house could solve, though.

Purifier designs also went through different stages throughout the years.

====The Gasholder====
[[File:Page 313 Single Lift Gas Holder.JPG|thumb|Single Lift Gasholder]] [[File:Telescoping Gasholder.JPG|thumb|Telescoping Gasholder]] [[Gasholders]] were constructed of a variety of materials, brick, stone, concrete, steel, or wrought iron. The holder or floating vessel is the storage reservoir for the gas, and it serves the purpose of equalizing the distribution of the gas under pressure, and ensures a continuity of supply, while gas remains in the holder. They are cylindrical like an inverted beaker and work up and down in the tank. In order to maintain a true vertical position, the vessel has rollers which work on guide-rails attached to the tank sides and to the columns surrounding the holder. 
Gasholders may be either single or telescopic in two or more lifts. When it is made in the telescopic form, its capacity could be increased to as much as four times the capacity of the single-lift holder for equal dimensions of tank. The telescopic versions were found to be useful as they conserved ground space and capital.&lt;ref name = "Newbigging"&gt;Thomas Newbigging, Handbook for Gas Engineers and Managers, 8th Edition, Walter King, London(1913), page 208&lt;/ref&gt;

====Minor and incidental coal gas-works facilities====
The gasworks had numerous small appertunances and facilities to aid with divers gas management tasks or auxiliary services.

=====Boilers=====
As the years went by, boilers (for the raising of steam) became extremely common in most gas-works above those small in size; the smaller works often used gas-powered internal combustion engines to do some of the tasks that steam performed in larger workings.

Steam was in use in many areas of the gasworks, including:
For the operation of the exhauster;
For scurfing of pyrolysis char and slag from the retorts and for clinkering the producer of the bench;
For the operation of engines used for conveying, compressing air, charging hydraulics, or the driving of dynamos or generators producing electric current;
To be injected under the grate of the producer in the indirectly fired bench, so as to prevent the formation of clinker, and to aid in the water-gas shift reaction, ensuring high-quality secondary combustion;
As a reactant in the (carburetted) water gas plant, as well as driving the equipment thereof, such as the numerous blowers used in that process, as well as the oil spray for the carburettor;
For the operation of fire, water, liquid, liquor, and tar pumps;
For the operation of engines driving coal and coke conveyor-belts;
For clearing of chemical obstructions in pipes, including naphthalene &amp; tar as well as general cleaning of equipment;
For heating cold buildings in the works, for maintaining the temperature of process piping, and preventing freezing of the water of the gasholder, or congealment of various chemical tanks and wells.

Heat recovery appliances could also be classed with boilers. As the gas industry applied scientific and rational design principles to its equipment, the importance of thermal management and capture from processes became common. Even the small gasworks began to use heat-recovery generators, as a fair amount of steam could be generated for "free" simply by capturing process thermal waste using water-filled metal tubing inserted into a strategic flue.

=====Dynamos/generators=====
As the electric age came into being, the gas-works began to use electricity – generated on site – for many of the smaller plant functions previously performed by steam or gas-powered engines, which were impractical and inefficient for small, sub-horsepower uses without complex and failure-prone mechanical linkages. As the benefits of electric illumination became known, sometimes the progressive gasworks diversified into electric generation as well, as coke for steam-raising could be had on-site at low prices, and boilers were already in the works.

=====Coal storage=====
According to Meade, the gasworks of the early 20th century generally kept on hand several weeks of coal. This amount of coal could cause major problems, because coal was liable to spontaneous combustion when in large piles, especially if they were rained upon, due to the protective dust coating of the coal being washed off, exposing the full porous surface area of the coal of slightly to highly activated carbon below; in a heavy pile with poor heat transfer characteristics, the heat generated could lead to ignition. But storage in air-entrained confined spaces was not highly looked upon either, as residual heat removal would be difficult, and fighting a fire if it was started could result in the formation of highly toxic carbon monoxide through the water-gas reaction, caused by allowing water to pass over extremely hot carbon (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + C = H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + CO), which would be dangerous outside, but deadly in a confined space.

Coal storage was designed to alleviate this problem. Two methods of storage were generally used; underwater, or outdoor covered facilities. To the outdoor covered pile, sometimes cooling appurtenances were applied as well; for example, means to allow the circulation of air through the depths of the pile and the carrying off of heat. Amounts of storage varied, often due to local conditions. Works in areas with industrial strife often stored more coal, while nations whose proletariat was under "control" stored less. Other variables included national security; for instance, the gasworks of [[Tegel]] in [[Berlin, Germany|Berlin]] had some 1 million tons of coal (6 months of supply) in gigantic underwater bunker facilities half a mile long (Meade 2e, p.&amp;nbsp;379); as Berlin is on the [[North German Plain]], perhaps this was due to what happened to Paris in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870–1871.

=====Coal stoking and machine stoking=====
[[File:Horizontal Retorts with Stoking Machine.PNG|thumb|Horizontal retorts with a stoking machine]]
Machine stoking or power stoking was used to replace labor and minimize disruptions due to labor disputes.  Each retort typically required two sets of three stokers.  Two of the stokers were required to lift the point of the scoop into the retort, while the third would push it in and turn it over. Coal would be introduced from each side of the retort.  The coke produced would be removed from both sides also. Gangs of stokers worked 12-hour shifts, although the labor was not continuous.  The work was also seasonal, with extra help being required in the winter time.  Machine stoking required more uniform placement of the retorts.  Increasing cost of labor increased the profit margin in experimenting with and instituting machine stoking.&lt;ref name = "Webber"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Webber |first1=W. H. Y. |title=Gas &amp; Gas Making: Growth, Methods and Prospects of the Gas Industry |series=Common Commodities and Industries |year=1918  |publisher=Sir Isaac Pitman &amp; Sons, Ltd. |location= London|pages =11–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Tar/liquor storage=====
The chemical industries demanded [[coal tar]], and the gas-works could provide it for them; and so the coal tar was stored on site in large underground tanks. As a rule, these were single wall metal tanks – that is, if they were not porous masonry. In those days, underground tar leaks were seen as merely a waste of tar; out of sight was truly out of mind; and such leaks were generally addressed only when the loss of revenue from leaking tar "wells", as these were sometimes called, exceeded the cost of repairing the leak. This practice of bygone days has caused representatives of present-day gas utilities to dive under tables and utter [[minced oath]]s when terms like "purportedly responsible party", "[[BTEX]]", "[[aquifer plume]]", or "[[Superfund]]" are mentioned.

Ammoniacal liquor was stored on site as well, in similar tanks. Sometimes the more progressive gasworks would have an [[ammonium sulfate]] plant, to convert the liquor into fertilizer, which was sold to farmers.

=====Station meter=====
This large-scale gas meter precisely measured gas as it issued from the works into the mains. It was of the utmost importance, as the gasworks balanced the account of issued gas versus the amount of paid for gas, and strived to detect why and how they varied from one another. Often it was coupled with a dynamic regulator to keep pressure constant, or even to modulate the pressure at specified times (a series of rapid pressure spikes was sometimes used with appropriately equipped street-lamps to automatically ignite or extinguish such remotely).

=====Anti-naphthalene minor carburettor=====

This device injected a fine mist of naphtha into the outgoing gas so as to avoid the crystallization of naphthalene in the mains, and their consequent blockage. Naphtha was found to be a rather effective solvent for these purposes, even in small concentrations. Where troubles with naphthalene developed, as it occasionally did even after the introduction of this minor carburettor, a team of workers was sent out to blow steam into the main and dissolve the blockage; still, prior to its introduction, naphthalene was a very major annoyance for the gasworks.

=====High-pressure distribution booster pump=====

This steam or gas engine powered device compressed the gas for injection into the high-pressure mains, which in the early 1900s began to be used to convey gas over greater distances to the individual low pressure mains, which served the end-users. This allowed the works to serve a larger area and achieve economies of scale.

| Coal gas || Primarily bituminous or cannel coal. Lignite occasionally used. || Carbonization ([[pyrolysis]]) of the coal feedstock (the heating of the coal feedstock in the absence of oxygen.) The gas produced by the hot coal is the gas distributed. || As distributed, contains a moderate proportion of marsh gas ([[methane]], CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), carbonic oxide ([[carbon monoxide]], CO), and simple hydrocarbon "illuminants", including oliefant gas ([[ethylene]], C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and acetylene gas (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). In addition, prior to treatment, contains coal tars (complex aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons), ammoniacal liquor (gaseous ammonia, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and aqueous ammonia, NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;OH), the sulfuret of hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S), and the sulfuret of carbon (CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). || 500–650 || 10–18 || The oldest type, introduced in 1798 by Murdoch, et al.; when the term "manufactured gas" or "town gas" is used without qualifiers, it generally refers to coal gas. Substantially greater illuminant yield with use of special "[[cannel coal]]", which may be modern [[oil shale]], richer in hydrocarbons than most regular gas coal (bituminous coal).

| Wood gas &lt;!--don't wikilink me because today's wood gas is not this type of wood gas. This type was ONLY manufactured through pyrolysis--&gt; || Timber resources. || Carbonization (pyrolysis) of the timber feedstock (the heating of the timber feedstock in the absence of oxygen.) The volatiles evolved from the heated wood is the gas distributed. || Resulting products unknown. Probably marsh gas, hydrogen, and carbonic oxide, along with some hydrocarbons and organics, like turpentine. || ? || &lt; 10 || Wood was used as a feedstock during the early days (1820s - 1850s) of manufactured gas in certain areas of the United States, due to lack of development of coal resources. Wood was carbonized in a manner similar to coal; however, the gas evolved was markedly inferior to that of coal in lighting and heating qualities. Still very useful for lighting. This wood gas produced solely through pyrolysis should not be confused with [[wood gas]] as used today; the modern [[wood gas generator]] produces its synthesis gas through the complete gasification process, as described below.
|-
| Oil pyrolytic gas. || Petroleum oil. || Carbonization (pyrolysis) of petroleum (the heating of the petroleum feedstock in the absence of oxygen.) The gas produced by the heated &amp; decomposed oil is the gas distributed. || As distributed, contains an extremely high proportion of simple hydrocarbon "illuminants", including oliefant gas (ethylene, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and acetylene gas (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), as well as propane gas (C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;), marsh gas (methane, CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and a small amount of carbonic oxide (carbon monoxide, CO). || 1000–1500 || 40–60 || Initial experiments in 1817–1825, which were failures; began to be used widely in 1860s. Simpler, much less labor-intensive manufacturing process. Oil very expensive feedstock compared to coal; prices (and illuminous efficacy per ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) double to triple that of regular coal gas.
|-
| Oil catalytic semi-water gas. (Improved Jones Process) || Petroleum oil. || Staged partial reaction of petroleum oil using steam at high temperature in catalytic environment. The gas produced by the partially reacted and partially cracked oil is the gas distributed. || As distributed, contains 35 – 40% hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), 45% – 50% marsh gas (methane, CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), and the balance of higher hydrocarbons and carbonic oxide (carbon monoxide, CO). || 500–700 || 10–18 || E.C. Jones, chief gas engineer of the San Francisco Gas Light Company (later the [[Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Company|PG&amp;E]]) developed this ingenious process to turn oil into a gas very similar to that produced by the pyrolysis of coal using a catalytic backflush of already produced gas and steam to provide a hydrogen atmosphere to stimulate disassociation of the oil with the minimal production of lampblack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The Improved Jones Process and evolutions of that process continued to be used on the Pacific Coast until the end of the manufactured gas age.

| Producer gas || Anthracite coal, coke, bituminous coal dust and waste, lignite, or biomass. || Manufactured by the incomplete combustion of varying carboniferous feedstocks in an extremely hot (&gt;= 1100&amp;nbsp;°C), limited-oxygen atmosphere aided by the injection of a small, stoichiometric flow of steam. || Contains a high proportion of nitrogen (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and carbonic oxide (carbon monoxide, CO), limited amounts of hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and a very small quantity of swamp gas (methane, CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). || 100–170 || nil || Produced in early days of coal gasification; however, only became common after invention of Otto cycle internal combustion engine for which it was an ideal fuel, as well as small-sized, reliable gas producers, which allowed the easy generation of producer gas nearly anywhere a supply of anthracite or coke was available. Gas generally not distributed past the walls of the production site, but used on location, due to low energy content and that it was mostly composed of deadly carbonic oxide. Used for standard domestic gas needs within institutions large enough to justify a hired man&lt;!--there were no women in manufactured gas in those days, lol--&gt; for the upkeep of the producer; these institutions often included work-houses, alms-houses, reformatories, orphanages, houses of correction, lunatic asylums, lyceums, industrial schools, and penitentiaries. Bulk heating, electric generation, and engine-running uses; also for welding purposes, as it possesses a "reducing flame" and a high temperature. N.B. One variant of producer gas was [[Mond gas]], known for both its consistent yield and that ammonia could be obtained as a byproduct. Slight modifications of producer necessary.
|-
| Water gas || Coke or anthracite coal and steam. || Manufactured by the reaction of extremely hot feedstock and steam in a superheated non-oxygen atmosphere. || Contains high proportions of carbonic oxide (carbon monoxide, CO) and hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and very low proportions of other gasses. || ~ 300 || nil || Manufacture known since late 1830s. However, not optimized for profitable generation until approximately 1865–70. Produced using an intermittent process; first, the exothermic "blow", where the feedstock was heated by blowing air through it, followed by an endothermic "run", where the air was cut off, and steam passed through the now superhot feedstock, leading to the decomposition of the steam and scavenging of carbon from the feedstock. Generally mixed with coal gas, valued for being able to be produced "just in time" with 1 hour's notice, unlike coal gas, which would require 4+ days to bring online from idle. Low labor and capital costs, however, high, inefficient use of anthracite/coke feedstock.

| Carburetted water gas || Water gas and petroleum or coal tar. || Manufactured by passing just-produced, super-hot water gas through a superheated "carburettor" into which petroleum or coal tar oil is sprayed, accomplishing the "cracking" of the oil into the gas. || Contains high proportions of carbonic oxide (carbon monoxide, CO) and hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and moderate proportions of marsh gas (methane, CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and mixed hydrocarbon illuminant gasses. || 400–700 || 10–25 || Introduced in 1876. Became a common process during the heady days of gas-lighting from the 1870s to the first decade of the 20th century, especially useful for mixing with coal gas. Process had similar positives and negatives as straight water gas, but also had illuminant value, as well as higher cost, due to oil/tar use. Variable illuminant yield, depending on amount/quality of oil spray. As gas steadily lost ground as an illuminant, extensive carburetting reduced to low values or carburetting omitted entirely, representing a return to water gas.

| Complete gasification gas || Gas-evolving coal or other organics. || Manufactured by a complex, staged process where as coal travelled down the vertical axis of an upright, semi-cylindrical reaction chamber, it would be subject to different chemical reactions based on what was being fed into that area of the reaction chamber. || Mix of carbonic oxide (carbon monoxide, CO), marsh gas (methane, CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), a small quantity of simple hydrocarbon illuminants, along with small quantities of nitrogen and carbon dioxide. || 330–400 || &gt; 8 || Earliest processes from 1895, came into industrial-scale use by 1918 (Meade, p.&amp;nbsp;766–769). Numerous processes developed, many in Germany, Austria, and other Continental nations. Potential of retaining over 75% energy of feedstock in gas with heat recovery from raw gas (Meade, p.&amp;nbsp;762), as compared to ~55% feedstock energy retention of other gasification processes.&lt;ref&gt;Further information on this development late in the public domain period (pre-1923) is likely in non-public domain, out of print publications ("orphaned works"), and that researchers with time might investigate this interesting development.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Khitan''' ({{lang-ar|ختان}}) or '''Khatna''' ({{lang-ar|ختنة}}) is the term for male [[circumcision]]&lt;ref name="Ibn Manẓūr 1311 1102"&gt;{{cite book |last= Ibn Manẓūr |first= Muḥammad ibn Mukarram |date= 1311 |title= Lisan Al-Arab |url= |location= Qumm, Iran |publisher= |page= 1102 |isbn= 9953131953}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lane 1863 703"&gt;{{cite book |last= Lane |first= Edward William |date= 1863 |title= Arabic-English Lexicon |url= |location= London |publisher= Willams &amp; Norgate |page= 703 |isbn= 8120601076}}&lt;/ref&gt; carried out as an [[Islamic culture]] by Muslims.

Islamic male circumcision is analogous but not identical to [[Brit milah|Jewish circumcision]]. Islam is currently the largest single religious group in which the practice is widespread,&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt; although circumcision is not mentioned in the [[Qur'an]] itself but is mentioned in a [[hadith]] and the [[sunnah]].

==Religious sources==
[[File:Circumcision central Asia2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Circumcision]] being performed in central Asia (probably [[Turkestan]]), c. 1865–1872.  Restored [[albumen print]].]]
The Qur'an itself does not mention circumcision explicitly in any verse. In the time of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]], circumcision of men was carried out by most pagan [[Tribes of Arabia|Arabian tribes]] and [[female circumcision]] by some, and male circumcision by Jews for religious reasons.&lt;ref&gt;W. La Barre, The Ghost Dance, London, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; This has also been attested by [[Al-Jahiz]],&lt;ref&gt;Volume II of al-Hayawan by Jahiz, ed. A. M. Harun, 7 vols., Cairo, 1938&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by [[Josephus]].&lt;ref&gt;The Works of Flavius Josephus, translated by W. Whiston, 2 vols., London, 1858&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some traditions, Muhammad was born without a [[foreskin]] ([[Aposthia|aposthetic]]), while others maintain that his grandfather Abd-al-Muttalib circumcised him when he was seven days old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/malecircumcision.shtml |title=Religions – Islam: Circumcision of boys |publisher=BBC |date=2009-08-13 |accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Al-Halabi, Ali Ibn-Burhan-al-Din. Alsirah al-halabiyyah. Vol.1 Beirut: Al-maktabah al-islamiyyah. (n.d.): 54–55&lt;/ref&gt;
Many of his early disciples were circumcised to symbolize their inclusion within the emerging Islamic community.&lt;ref name="source"&gt;source?&lt;/ref&gt; Some accounts report that [[Heraclius]], Emperor of Byzantium, had referred to Muhammad as the "leader of the circumcised people".&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Bukhari, vol. 1, book 1, no. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Some hadith mentions circumcision in a list of practices known as ''[[fitra]]'' (acts considered to be of a refined person). Abu Hurayra, a companion of Muhammad, was quoted saying, "Five things are fitra: circumcision, shaving pubic hair with a razor, trimming the mustache, paring one's nails and plucking the hair from one's armpits" (reported in  the  ''hadiths'' of [[Sahih al-Bukhari]] and  [[Sahih Muslim]]). So, despite its absence from the Qur'an, it has been a [[Religious male circumcision|religious]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; custom from the beginning of Islam. However, there are other ''hadiths'' which do not name circumcision as part of the characteristics of ''fitra''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunnah.com/bukhari/77/107|title=Hadith – Book of Dress – Sahih al-Bukhari – Sayings and Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)|publisher=sunnah.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; and yet another ''hadith'' which names ten characteristics, again without naming circumcision; in Sahih Muslim, Aisha is quoted "The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Ten are the acts according to fitra: clipping the mustache, letting the beard grow, using toothpicks, snuffing water in the nose, cutting the nails, washing the finger joints, plucking the hair under the armpits, shaving pubic hair and cleaning one's private parts with water. The narrator said: I have forgotten the tenth, but it may have been rinsing the mouth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunnah.com/muslim/2/71|title=Hadith – The Book of Purification – Sahih Muslim – Sayings and Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)|publisher=sunnah.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the different hadiths do not agree on whether circumcision is part of fitra or not.

Muhammad's wife [[Aisha]] supposedly quotes Muhammad as saying that "[[ghusl|ablution]] becomes necessary if the two circumcised members touch".&lt;ref&gt;Malik ibn Anas, Ketab al-mowatta, Volume I, pages 45-47, traditions 70-75. ed. M.F. Abd-al-Baqi, Cairo&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Majah, Kitab Sunan, ed. M. F. Abd-al-Baqi, Cairo, 1972, Page 199 Volume I&lt;/ref&gt;
Furthermore, Muhammad is reported to have once advised a female circumciser not to cut off the entire clitoris during female circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;Page 28 of Volume VII of al-Hayawan by Jahiz, ed. A. M. Harun, 7 vols., Cairo, 1938&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some ''hadith'', Muhammad supposedly circumcised his grandsons, [[Hasan ibn Ali|Hasan]] and [[Husayn ibn Ali|Husayn]], on the seventh day after their birth.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Amili, Muhammad Ibn Hasan Al-Hur. Wasa'il al-shi'ah ila tahsil masa'il al-shariah. Vol 15. Tehran, Al-Maktabah al-Islamiyyah, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;
Sahih al-Bukhari and Muslim also quote from Muhammad that Prophet Abraham performed his own circumcision at the age of eighty.&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Bukhari Hadith No. 575, and Muslim's anthology of authentic hadith, IV, item 2370.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also reported by [[Abu Dawud]] and [[Ahmad Ibn Hanbal]] that Muhammad stated that circumcision was a "law for men and a preservation of honor for women".&lt;ref&gt;Ahmad Ibn Hanbal 5:75; Abu Dawud, Adab 167&lt;/ref&gt;

Circumcision was introduced to many lands for the first time through Islam itself following the Muslim conquests under the [[Rashidun]], who were the companions and contemporaries of Muhammad. An example are the [[Persian people|Persians]] who did not practice circumcision before the advent of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Iranica, Circumcision&lt;/ref&gt; Post-Islamic converts such as [[Afshin (Caliphate General)|Afshin]] were found guilty in trials of remaining uncircumcised;&lt;ref&gt;Page 766 of the Volume II of Al-Basaer wa al-Dhakha'ir, Abu Hayyan Tawhidi, Kaylānī, Damascus, 1964&lt;/ref&gt; this further indicates that the practice was deemed compulsory by the early Muslims.

===Sunni Islam===
Amongst ''[[Ulema]]'' (Muslim legal scholars), there are differing opinions about the compulsion of circumcision in ''[[Sharia]]'' (Islamic law). [[Imam]]s [[Abū Ḥanīfa]], founder of the [[Hanafi]] school of ''[[Fiqh]]'' (Islamic jurisprudence), and [[Malik ibn Anas]], maintain that circumcision is a ''[[Sunnah]] Mu'akkadah''—not obligatory but highly recommended. The [[Shafi‘i]] and [[Hanbali]] schools see it as binding on all Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&amp;cid=1119503545032 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530090925/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaE&amp;cid=1119503545032 |archivedate=2010-05-30 |title=Medical Ethics of Male Circumcision |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2010-05-30 |accessdate=2012-05-20 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shia Islam ===
Most Shia traditions regard the practice as obligatory. They rely on sayings that come from classical Shia authors.&lt;ref&gt;Book 90 of Hilyat ul-muttaqeen&lt;/ref&gt; In one narration Muhammad was asked if an uncircumcised man could go to pilgrimage. He answered "not as long as he is not circumcised". They quote [[Ali]] as saying: "If a man becomes Muslim, he must submit to circumcision even if he is 80 years old."&lt;ref&gt;Al-Kalini, Abu-Ja'afar Muhammad Ibn-Yaqub. Al-furu'min al-kafi. Vol. 6 Tehran: Dar al-kutub al-islamiyyah. 1981:35&lt;/ref&gt; Another narration from [[Ja'far al-Sadiq|Al-Sadiq]] says: "Circumcise your sons when they are seven days old as it is cleaner (athar) and the flesh grows faster and because the earth hates the urine of the uncircumcised."&lt;ref&gt;Al-Kalini, Abu-Ja'afar Muhammad Ibn-Yaqub. Al-furu'min al-kafi. Vol. 6 Tehran: Dar al-kutub al-islamiyyah. 1981:34&lt;/ref&gt; It is also believed that the urine of the uncircumcised is impure, while if one prays with unclean genitals their prayer may not be considered as acceptable, even of those who have been circumcised, meaning that it may have to be repeated again at a time when the believer has purified themselves and removed the impurity. Another hadith of Muhammad states: "the earth cries out to God in anguish because of the urine of the uncircumcised", and that "the earth becomes defiled from the urine of the uncircumcised for forty days".&lt;ref&gt;DS Hellsten. Male and Female Circumcision: Medical, Legal and Ethical Considerations in Pediatric Practice. Page 147&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quranists===
Most [[Qur'an alone|Quranists]] claim circumcision is [[haram]], arguing that Quran {{Cite quran|4|119|s=ns|b=n}} forbids altering one's body, and {{Cite quran|95|4|s=ns|b=n}} says man was created perfectly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quranicpath.com/misconceptions/circumcision.html |title=Circumcision - Does the Quran Approve it? - Genital Mutilation &amp;#124; ختان &amp;#124; Khitan &amp;#124; Islam &amp;#124; Sunnah &amp;#124; Hadith &amp;#124; Khatna &amp;#124; Musolmani &amp;#124; Sunat &amp;#124; Sirkumsisi &amp;#124; Khatan &amp;#124; Tuli &amp;#124; Tule &amp;#124; Pagtutuli &amp;#124; Sunatan &amp;#124; Sünnet &amp;#124; Urkwtha &amp;#124; Tahara &amp;#124; Touhur &amp;#124; طهارة &amp;#124; طهور |publisher=QuranicPath |date= |accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allmonotheists.com/tag/revisionist-muslim/ |title=Revisionist Muslim « For All Monotheists |publisher=Allmonotheists.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ljZZ9ZvD_kQC&amp;pg=PA142&amp;lpg=PA142&amp;dq=circumcision+islam+alter+perfect&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GyWEmzPIGi&amp;sig=6eNHUNrQsiDL0LM3_uECSIGNuFI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=nrIeTpKLHIaHhQe5_OysAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Male and female circumcision, medical, legal, and ethical considerations] George C.

==Time for circumcision==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Java optocht bij een besnijdenisfeest links vooraan stokpaarden TMnr 60002834.jpg|thumb|Traditional procession after circumcision of a child in [[Dutch East Indies]], 1915–1918.]]
Islamic sources do not fix a particular time for circumcision. It depends on family, region and country. A majority of Ulema however take the view that parents should get their child circumcised before the age of ten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamicvoice.com/may.2000/dialogue.htm |title=Circumcision |publisher=Islamicvoice.com |date=2000-03-28 |accessdate=2012-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The preferred age is usually seven although some Muslims are circumcised as early as on the seventh day after birth and as late as at the commencement of [[puberty]].&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;

==Procedure==
Whereas Jewish circumcision is closely bound by ritual timing and tradition, in Islam there is no fixed age for circumcision. The age when boys get circumcised, and the procedures used, tend to change across cultures, families, and time. In some Muslim-majority countries, circumcision is performed on Muslim boys after they have learned to recite the whole Qur'an from start to finish.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt; In [[Malaysia]] and other regions, the boy usually undergoes the operation between the ages of ten and twelve, and is thus a [[Rite of passage|puberty rite]], serving to introduce him into the new status of an adult.&lt;ref name="circlist1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.circlist.com/rites/moslem.html |title=Traditional Muslim Male Circumcision&amp;mdash;Performed by Arabs, Turkish, Malaysian and Others of This Faith |accessdate=2008-07-29 |work= |publisher= |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The procedure is sometimes semi-public, accompanied with music, special foods, and much festivity.&lt;ref name="circlist" /&gt;

There is no equivalent of a Jewish [[mohel]] in Islam. Circumcisions are usually carried out in a clinic or hospital. The circumciser is not required to be a Muslim.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt; The position of the scar is usually neither fully "low" nor fully "high", and the skin left is rather loose. However, due to a relatively secular approach to circumcision in the Muslim world, the "styles" of the Islamic circumcision vary on every individual, and change in the light of new medical knowledge.&lt;ref name="circlist"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.circlist.com/styles/page3.html |title=Style choices in relation to Religious Beliefs |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140515075416/http://www.circlist.com/styles/page3.html |archivedate=2014-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier, instead of being carried out in hospitals, they would be carried out in local clinics and terraces. The circumciser would generally scream "dekh kabootar", translating into "look at the pigeons" in Urdu, to distract the patient and then circumcise the individual.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==Celebrations==
In Indonesia, after a child is circumcised, there is a feast called [[Perayaan Sunatan]], but some ulemas in Indonesia say this is [[bid‘ah]] whereas most of them say it is not. In Turkey also widely celebrated and called "Sunnet Toreni" "Sunnet mevludu".

==Female genital mutilation==
''[[Khafḍ]]'', or ''k̲h̲ifāḍ'', refers to [[female genital mutilation]] (FGM).&lt;ref name="khitān" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aldeeb Abu-Sahlieh, Sami A., To Mutilate in the Name of Jehova or Allah, Legitimization of Male and Female Circumcision, Middle East Research Associates, Paper No. 21, 1994; see page 6-18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paulyonline.brill.nl/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/khafd-SIM_4132 K̲h̲afḍ], Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition. Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs.

Hawting (2006), The Development of Islamic Ritual, {{ISBN|978-0860787129}}, page 358-361&lt;/ref&gt; Over 200 million women in Africa, the Middle East and Southeast Asia are thought to be living with FGM.&lt;ref name=UNICEF2016&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGMC_2016_brochure_final_UNICEF_SPREAD.pdf "Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting: A Global Concern"], New York: United Nations Children's Fund, February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; While it is a common belief that FGM is a requirement in Islam, the Quran makes no mention of it and the practice is largely condemned by the majority of Muslims. In Africa, FGM is also practiced not just by Muslims from certain cultures but by Christians and animists alike.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3245">The '''L. D. Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics''' of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] is a research institution, located in the small town of [[Chernogolovka]] near [[Moscow]] (there is also a subdivision in Moscow). Its main fields of research are

* [[Mathematical physics]]
* [[Computational physics]] 
* [[Nonlinear dynamics]] 
* [[Condensed matter theory]]
* [[Nuclear physics|Nuclear]] and [[Particle physics|elementary particle physics]] 
* [[Quantum field theory]] 


==History==

The Landau Institute was formed in 1965 to keep the ''Landau school'' alive after the tragic car accident of [[Lev Landau|Lev D. Landau]]. Since its foundation, the institute grew rapidly to about one hundred scientists, becoming one of the worldwide best-known and leading institutes for [[theoretical physics]].

Unlike many other scientific centers in Russia, the Landau Institute had the strength to cope with the crisis of the nineties in the last century. Although about one half of the scientists accepted positions at leading scientific centers and universities abroad, most of them kept ties with their ''home institute'', forming a scientific network in the tradition of the Landau school and supporting young theoretical physicists in the Landau Institute.

==Prominent members==

Up to 1992, the institute was headed by [[Isaak Markovich Khalatnikov]], who was then replaced by [[Vladimir E. Zakharov]]. Its numerous prominent scientists, [[mathematician]]s as well as [[physicists]], include the [[Nobel laureate]] [[Alexei Alexeyevich Abrikosov]] as well as Igor Dzyaloshinsky, [[Lev Gor'kov]], [[Vladimir Gribov]], [[Arkady Migdal]], [[Anatoly Larkin]], [[Sergei Novikov (mathematician)|Sergei Novikov]], [[Alexander Markovich Polyakov|Alexander Polyakov]], Mark Azbel, [[Valery Pokrovsky]], [[Emmanuel Rashba]], Sergey Iordanskii, Ioshua Levinson, [[Alexei Starobinsky]], [[Alexei Kitaev]], [[Vadim Berezinskii]], Sergey Brazovsky, Konstantin Efetov, David Khmel'nitsky, Vladimir Mineev, Gregory Volovik, [[Paul Wiegmann]], Leonid Levitov, Alexander Zamolodchikov, [[Vadim Knizhnik]], [[Konstantin Khanin]], and [[Yakov G. Sinai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Raussen|first1=Martin|last2=Skau|first2=Christian|title=Interview with Yakov Sinai – Abel Laureate 2014|journal=EMS Newsletter|date=September 2014|issue=93|page=17|url=https://www.ems-ph.org/journals/newsletter/pdf/2014-09-93.pdf|accessdate=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25810">[[File:Canal de Suez.jpg|thumb|292x292px|The [[Suez Canal]], across which marine species migrate in the so-called '''Lessepsian migration''']]
The '''Lessepsian migration''' (also called '''Erythrean invasion''') is the [[migration (ecology)|migration]] of marine species across the [[Suez Canal]], usually from the [[Red Sea]] to the [[Mediterranean Sea]], and more rarely in the opposite direction. When the canal was completed in 1869, [[fish]], [[crustacean]]s, [[mollusk]]s, and other marine animals and plants were exposed to an artificial passage between the two naturally separate bodies of water, and cross-contamination was made possible between formerly isolated [[ecosystem]]s. The phenomenon is still occurring today. It is named after [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]], the [[France|French]] diplomat in charge of the canal's construction.

The migration of [[invasive species]] through the Suez Canal from the Indo-Pacific region has been facilitated by many factors, both [[Abiotic component|abiotic]] and [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]], and presents significant implications for the [[ecology|ecological]] health and economic stability of the contaminated areas; of particular concern is the fisheries industry in the [[Eastern Mediterranean]]. Despite these threats, the phenomenon has allowed scientists to study an invasive event on a large scale in a short period of time, which usually takes hundreds of years in natural conditions.

In a wider context, the term Lessepsian migration is also used to describe any animal migration facilitated by man-made structures, i.e. one which would not have occurred had it not been for the presence of an artificial structure.

==Background==
The opening of the Suez Canal created the first saltwater passage between the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea. Constructed in 1869 to provide a more direct trade route from Europe to India and the Far East, the canal is {{convert|162.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, with a depth of {{convert|10|–|15|m|ft|abbr=on}} and a width varying between {{convert|200|and|300|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Impact of Red Sea Fish Migrants through the Suez Canal on the Aquatic Environment of the Eastern Mediterranean|author=Daniel Golani|citeseerx = 10.1.1.604.8344}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:SuezCanalElGuisr.jpg|thumb|361x361px|Construction of the Suez canal]]

Because the surface of the Red Sea is slightly higher in elevation than the Eastern Mediterranean, the canal serves as a tidal strait by which Red Sea water pours into the Mediterranean. The [[Bitter Lakes]], which are natural [[hypersaline lake]]s that form part of the canal, blocked the migration of Red Sea species into the Mediterranean for many decades, but as the [[salinity]] of the lakes gradually equalized with that of the Red Sea, the barrier to migration was removed, and plants and animals from the Red Sea have begun to colonize the eastern Mediterranean.&lt;ref name="Madl" /&gt; The Red Sea, an extension of the [[Indian Ocean]], is generally saltier and less nutrient-rich than the Mediterranean, an extension of the [[Atlantic Ocean]], so Red Sea species, able to tolerate harsh environments, have advantages over Atlantic species in the conditions of the Eastern Mediterranean. Accordingly, most migrations between the two bodies of water are invasions of Red Sea species into the Mediterranean, and relatively few migrations occur in the opposite direction. The construction of the [[Aswan High Dam]] across the [[Nile River]] in the 1960s reduced the inflow of fresh water and nutrient-rich silt from the Nile into the eastern Mediterranean, making conditions in the eastern Mediterranean even more like those of the Red Sea, thereby increasing the impact of the invasions and facilitating the occurrence of new ones.&lt;ref name="Madl" /&gt;

The Red Sea is a profusely abundant tropical marine environment sharing species in common with the eastern Indo-Pacific region, while the Mediterranean is a temperate sea with much lower productivity; the two ecosystems are extremely different in terms of structure and ecology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Suez Canal quickly became the main pathway for the introduction of invasive species into the Eastern Mediterranean, having zoogeographic and ecological consequences far beyond what the designers could foresee. The Lessepsian migration includes hundreds of Red Sea and Indo-Pacific species that have colonized and established themselves in the Eastern Mediterranean system, causing [[biogeography|biogeographic]] changes comparable to that of [[continental drift]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galil|first=Bella S.|last2=Boero|first2=Ferdinando|last3=Campbell|first3=Marnie L.|last4=Carlton|first4=James T.|last5=Cook|first5=Elizabeth|last6=Fraschetti|first6=Simonetta|last7=Gollasch|first7=Stephan|last8=Hewitt|first8=Chad L.|last9=Jelmert|first9=Anders|date=2015-04-01|title='Double trouble': the expansion of the Suez Canal and marine bioinvasions in the Mediterranean Sea|journal=Biological Invasions|language=en|volume=17|issue=4|pages=973–976|doi=10.1007/s10530-014-0778-y|issn=1387-3547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To this day, about 300 species native to the Red Sea have been identified in the Mediterranean Sea, and probably others are as yet unidentified. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the [[Egypt|Egyptian]] government announced its intentions to deepen and widen the canal, which raised concerns from [[marine biologist]]s, fearing this would expand the invasion of Red Sea species into the Mediterranean and facilitate the crossing of the canal for additional species.&lt;ref&gt;Galil, B.

==Ecological impacts==
===Out-competition of natives===
[[File:Fistularia commersonii1.jpg|thumb|250 px|''[[Fistularia commersonii]]'', a Lessepsian migrant&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.mba.ac.uk/jmba/pdf/6123.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721043458/http://www.mba.ac.uk/jmba/pdf/6123.pdf|archive-date=2011-07-21|title=New records of the lessepsian fish ''Fistularia commersonii'' (Osteichthyes: Fistulariidae) from the central Tyrrhenian Sea: signs of an incoming colonization?|first=P.N.|last=Psomadakis|first2=U.|last2=Scacco|first3=I.|last3=Consalvo|first4=M.|last4=Bottaro|first5=F.|last5=Leone|first6=M.|last6=Vacchi|journal=JMBA2 Biodiversity Records|date=2 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

====Native ''Argyrosomus regius'' vs. invasive ''Scomberomorus commerson''====
A wide-ranging species in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean, the meagre ''[[Argyrosomus regius]]'' is a species [[indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] to the Eastern Mediterranean which was one of the most common commercial fish in [[Israel]]. However, this species has since disappeared from local catches, while the [[narrow-barred Spanish mackerel]] ''Scomberomorus commerson'', a known Lessepsian migrant, has dramatically increased in population. Studies have been done on this occurrence, and due to similar life histories and diets, this may be an example of an invasive migrant outcompeting a native species and occupying its [[niche (ecology)|niche]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galil|first=Bella S.|last2=Boero|first2=Ferdinando|last3=Campbell|first3=Marnie L.|last4=Carlton|first4=James T.|last5=Cook|first5=Elizabeth|last6=Fraschetti|first6=Simonetta|last7=Gollasch|first7=Stephan|last8=Hewitt|first8=Chad L.|last9=Jelmert|first9=Anders|date=2015-04-01|title='Double trouble': the expansion of the Suez Canal and marine bioinvasions in the Mediterranean Sea|journal=Biological Invasions|language=en|volume=17|issue=4|pages=973–976|doi=10.1007/s10530-014-0778-y|issn=1387-3547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Native ''Melicertus kerathurus'' vs. invasive prawns====
Eight species of invasive [[prawn]]s from the [[Erythraean Sea]] have been recorded in the Eastern Mediterranean. These prawns are considered highly prized in [[The Levant|Levantine]] fisheries, and compose most of the prawn catch off the Mediterranean coast of Egypt, being 6% of total Egyptian landings. However, this high abundance of invasive prawns has led to the decline of a native penaeid prawn, ''[[Melicertus kerathurus]]'', which supported a commercial Israeli fishery throughout the 1950s. Due to out-competition and its habitat being overrun by these migrants, this native species has since disappeared and had detrimental impacts on the commercial fishery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galil|first=B. S.|date=2007-01-01|title=Loss or gain? Invasive aliens and biodiversity in the Mediterranean Sea|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X06004954|journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin|series=Marine Bioinvasions: A collection of reviews|volume=55|issue=7|pages=314–322|doi=10.1016/j.marpolbul.2006.11.008|pmid=17222869}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parasitic invaders===
The invasion of new Red Sea species into the Mediterranean has also facilitated the invasion of their associated parasites, for example the [[copepod]] ''[[Eudactylera aspera]]'', which was found on a spinner shark, ''[[Carcharhinus brevipinna]]'', taken off the coast of [[Tunisia]]. The copepod had originally been described from specimens taken from ''C. brevipinna'' off [[Madagascar]] and its finding in the Mediterranean has arguably confirmed the previously disputed status of ''C. brevipinna'' as a Lessepsian migrant. In addition, parasites originating in the Red Sea have shown an ability to use related native Mediterranean fish species as alternative [[host (biology)|hosts]]; e.g. the copepod ''[[Nipergasilus bora]]'' was known to parasitize the grey mullets ''[[Mugil cephalus]]'' and ''[[Planiliza carinata]]'' in the Red Sea, both taxa having been recorded as Lessepsian migrants, and was subsequently found parasitizing the native Mediterranean mullets ''[[Golden grey mullet|Chelon aurata]]'' and ''[[Chelon labrosus]]''.&lt;ref name = "di Castri"&gt;{{cite book | editor1 = F. di Castri | editor2 = A.J. Hansen | editor3 = M Debussche | year = 2012 | title = Biological Invasions in Europe and the Mediterranean Basin Volume 65 of Monographiae Biologicae| publisher = Springer Science &amp; Business Media | page = 300 | chapter = 18.

On the contrary, the invasion of these parasites may have the effect of reducing the competitive advantages that Red Sea invaders have in the Mediterranean. For example, the Indo-Pacific swimming crab ''[[Charybdis longicollis]]'' was first recorded in the Mediterranean in the mid-1950s and became dominant in silty and sandy substrates off the coast of Israel, making up to 70% of the total [[biomass]] in these habitats. Until 1992, none of the specimens collected was infected with the parasite ''[[Heterosaccus dollfusi]]'', but in that year, a few infected crabs were collected. The parasite is a [[barnacle]] which [[neutering|desexes]] its host. Within three years, the parasite had spread to southern [[Turkey]] and 77% of the crabs collected in [[Haifa Bay]] were infected. This rapid increase and high infection rate is attributed to the extremely high population density of the host and the year-round reproduction of the parasite. One effect of this was that the population of the Mediterranean native swimming crab ''[[Liocarcinus vernalis]]'' recovered somewhat.&lt;ref name = Galil&gt;{{cite book | author = Bella S.

===Species displacements===
The goldband goatfish, ''[[Upeneus moluccensis]]'', was first recorded in the Eastern Mediterranean in the 1930s and has since established an abundant population. Following the warm winter of 1954–1955, it increased to 83% of the Israeli catch, replacing the native [[red mullet]], which also affected the Egyptian fishery, being 3% of their total landings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/009/a0477e/a0477e0i.htm#bm18|title=Review of the state of world marine capture fisheries management: Indian Ocean.|website=www.fao.org|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high water temperatures of this unusually warm winter may have resulted in the poor survival of red mullet juveniles, which may have allowed the [[goatfish]] population to expand into the opened niche.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galil|first=B. S.|date=2007-01-01|title=Loss or gain? Invasive aliens and biodiversity in the Mediterranean Sea|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X06004954|journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin|series=Marine Bioinvasions: A collection of reviews|volume=55|issue=7|pages=314–322|doi=10.1016/j.marpolbul.2006.11.008|pmid=17222869}}&lt;/ref&gt; Native mullet have since been displaced into deeper, cooler waters, where Lessepsian migrants consist of only 20% of the catch, whereas in shallower, warmer waters, this invasive species takes up a staggering 87% of the catch.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; From these data, the Lessepsian migrants apparently have not adapted to the more temperate environment of the deeper areas of the basin, but have established dominant populations in the habitats most similar to the tropical sea habitats from which they came.

===Food web phase shift===
The marbled spinefoot (''[[Siganus rivulatus]]'') and dusky spinefoot (''[[Siganus luridus]]''), both [[indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] Red Sea [[rabbitfish]], were first recorded off the coast of Israel in 1924. In only a few decades, these schooling, herbivorous fish were able to settle in a range of habitats forming abundant populations, to the extent that George and Athanassiou, in a paper published in 1967, reported: "The millions of young abound over rocky outcropping grazing on the relatively abundant early summer [[algae|algal]] cover".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=C.J.|first=George|last2=V.|first2=Athanassiou|date=1967|title=A two year study of the fishes appearing in the seine fishery of St. George Bay, Lebanon|url=http://www.vliz.be/en/imis?module=ref&amp;refid=259230|journal=Annali del Museo Civico di Storia Naturale Giacomo Doria}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2004, a study on these species found that they comprise 80% of the abundance of herbivorous fish in the shallow coastal sites of [[Lebanon]].&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galil|first=B. S.|date=2007-01-01|title=Loss or gain? Invasive aliens and biodiversity in the Mediterranean Sea|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X06004954|journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin|series=Marine Bioinvasions: A collection of reviews|volume=55|issue=7|pages=314–322|doi=10.1016/j.marpolbul.2006.11.008|pmid=17222869}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have been able to create marked phase shifts within the food web on multiple levels. Prior to the arrival of these Lessepsian migrants, the herbivores filled a small ecological role within the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] system. Therefore, with such a high influx of herbivorous species in a small period of time, this phenomenon has normalised the [[food web]], increasing the rate at which algae are consumed and serving as a major prey item for large predators.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; This increased rate of grazing has, in turn, proliferated the settlement and colonisation of a [[Introduced species|nonindigenous species]] of [[mussel]] from the Indo-Pacific that is now able to attach to rocky substrate that was once covered with algae. This mussel, which has a thicker shell than that of the native mussel, has created a change in predation patterns, as well, since they are more difficult to consume.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Not only are these Red Sea migrants having a huge impact on this ecosystem, they also are affecting fisheries, as well, by out-competing native fish of high commercial value, such as the seabream ''[[Boops boops]]''.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;


==Anti-Lessepsian migration==
[[File:Dicentrarchus labrax011.JPG|thumb|right|European seabass: one of the few anti-Lessepsian migrants|186x186px]]
Only a comparatively few species have colonised the Red Sea from the Mediterranean, and these are referred to as anti-Lessepsian migrants. As the predominant flow of the canal is from south to north, this acts against the southward movement of Mediterranean species, and as stated above, the Red Sea has higher salinity, fewer nutrients, and a much more diverse biota than the Eastern Mediterranean. Some of the anti-Lessepsian migrants such as the [[sea star]] ''[[Sphaerodiscus placenta]]'' are found only in specialised habitats such as the lagoon of El{{nbsp}}Bilaiyim, which lies {{convert|180|km|abbr=on}} south of the southern entrance to the Suez Canal, but is much more saline than the surrounding waters of the [[Gulf of Suez]].&lt;ref name = Madl&gt;{{cite web | url = http://biophysics.sbg.ac.at/lm/lesseps.htm | title = Essay about the phenomenon of Lessepsian Migration | accessdate = 29 December 2016 | publisher = Pierre Madl|work = Colloquial Meeting of Marine Biology I}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[sea slug]] ''[[Chelidonura fulvipunctata]]'' was originally described from waters around Japan and is widespread in the eastern Indian Ocean and western Pacific. It was first identified in the Mediterranean in 1961, and was seen in the Red Sea in 2005, most likely as a result of anti-Lessepsian migration.&lt;ref name = Malaquias&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Malaquias |first1=Manuel |last2=Zamora-Silva |first2=Andrea |last3=Vitale |first3=Dyana |last4=Spinelli |first4=Andrea |last5=De Matteo |first5=Sergio |last6=Giacobbe |first6=Salvatore |last7=Ortigosa |first7=Deneb |last8=Cervera |first8=Juan |title=The Suez Canal as a revolving door for marine species: a reply to Galil et al.

==Factors facilitating Lessepsian migrant colonization and expansion==
===Anthropogenic stressors: Aswan Dam===
Impact of Lessepsian migrants on system may be heavier due to a major [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic factor]]: the construction of the Aswan Dam. Before construction, the [[Nile River]] was able to deeply influence the marine environment of the Eastern Mediterranean, discharging high tonnage of nutrient-rich water. This resulted in a high abundance of phytoplankton in the delta which had a beneficial influence on the productivity in the surrounding sea, and attracted large schools of sardines, resulting in a highly lucrative commercial fishery. After the dam’s completion in 1964, this productivity diminished, resulting in the cessation of nutrients in the Mediterranean, leading to a sharp decrease in fish populations, namely sardines, which ultimately lead to the collapse of the sardine fishery. As a result, the Egyptian purse-seine fishing industry today takes only 10% of the pre-dam catch, which may have been due to the influence of dispersion of the Red Sea invasives. The freshwater discharge of the Nile could have been a natural barrier for some of the migrants in their movement through the Eastern Mediterranean.

===Natural stressors: climate change===
With climate change and the warming of seawater temperature, the [[Thermophile|thermophilic]] Lessepsian migrants may find it easier to reproduce, grow, and survive and give them a distinct advantage over native temperate Mediterranean taxa. Both processes, [[Global warming|global warming]] and the influx of Lessepsian migrants, may impact the already teetering fisheries by displacing commercially important native species, causing a phase shift in coastal ecosystems and changing seascape patterns. Furthermore, deepening of the warm surface layer is causing massive mortalities of organisms that do not tolerate high temperatures. Through various studies, species have been shown to be now restricted to deeper levels and thrive for shorter periods than in the past. Climate change is also one of the reasons for another stressor on this system, the decline of natural barriers that were once in place to prevent many Red Sea natives to migrate to the Mediterranean. Due to global warming, the Eastern Mediterranean is experiencing an increase in temperature and salinity, which is decreasing the hydrological barrier between the two seas, favoring the migrants from the tropic Indo-Pacific which have a warm-water affinity and causing mortality in the temperate Eastern Mediterranean natives. The Bitter Lakes created a natural salinity barrier within the Suez Canal due to their high deposits of salt, preventing many species from migrating. However, due to the freshening of these lakes, this natural barrier is weakening, allowing a higher mitigation of invasive species.

==Other examples==
===North America===
The [[sea lamprey]] reached [[Lake Ontario]] from the Atlantic Ocean through shipping canals and was recorded for the first time in Lake Ontario in the 1830s, but [[Niagara Falls]] was a barrier to their further spread. The deepening of the [[Welland Canal]] in 1919 allowed the sea lamprey to bypass the barrier created by the falls, and by 1938, sea lampreys had been recorded in all of the [[Great Lakes]].&lt;ref name = MSG&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.seagrant.umn.edu/ais/sealamprey_battle | title = Sea Lamprey: The Battle Continues | accessdate = 29 December 2016 | publisher = Regents of the University of Minnesota}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[alewife]] (''Alosa pseudoharengus''), a species of [[shad]] from the Western Atlantic, also invaded the Great Lakes by using the Welland Canal to bypass Niagara Falls.

'''''Mainstreams of Modern Art: David to Picasso''''' (1959) is a reference book by [[John Canaday]].  It comprehensively covers [[modern art]] from the start of [[Romanticism]] in the 18th century to [[Cubism]] and [[Abstract art]] in the early 20th century.  ''Mainstreams'' enjoyed wide commercial and critical success, and was awarded the 1959 [[Athenaeum Literary Award]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philaathenaeum.org/literary.html Literary Award Winners], The Athenæum of Philadelphia&lt;/ref&gt;

It also contains a ten-page appendix "Notes on Modern Architecture", the final five pages of which are devoted to criticism of [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], whose design Canaday states "have failed disastrously."  But in the same sentence, he also praised Wright's buildings as "some of the most beautiful structures of the century bearing his name." This, combined with Canaday's other outspoken views, led a group of artists, collectors, and academics to write a letter to the ''[[New York Times]]'' in protest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.duke.edu/lilly/artlibry/dah/canadayj.htm John Canaday], Duke University Libraries&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Maronite mummies''' are eight well preserved natural [[Mummy|mummies]] of [[Maronite]] villagers dating back to around 1283 AD.  They were uncovered by a team of [[speleologist]]/[[archaeologists]]s during a rescue excavation in the [[Qadisha Valley]] of [[Lebanon]] in 1991. They are currently on display in the [[National Museum of Beirut]].

==Discovery==
The mummies were found in the 'Asi-al Hadath cave located in the [[Kadisha Valley]] in [[Lebanon]], on July 13, 1990 by a group of speleologists/archaeologists of the Groupe d'Etudes et de Recherches Souterraines du Liban- GERSL, namely Abi Aoun Pierre, Baroudy Fadi, Ghaouch Antoine and Khawaja Paul&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Abi Aoun B., Baroudy F., Ghaouch A. Khawaja P and alias Momies du Liban: Rapport préliminaire sur la découverte archaéologique de 'Asi-al-Hadat (XIIIe siècle), France, Édifra, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;
The find was the result of two years of excavation.  Initially, the discovery consisted of a single four-month-old infant mummy&lt;ref name="cavinglebanon.com"&gt;http://www.cavinglebanon.com/publications/&lt;/ref&gt;

The infant was named Yasmine by her discoverers after a child whose name was mentioned in a manuscript discovered on-site. The infant was clothed and fully interred only 40&amp;nbsp;cm below ground, she was laid on her back alone in the grave, her head resting on a smooth stone. Yasmine was carefully wrapped in medical gauze and immobilized with splinting devices by the team and transported from the grotto to a customized laboratory, created by the Discoverers. 
Multiple other remains were found following the discovering, include seven bodies (four infants and three adults) as well as skeletal remains of several others.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;http://www.cavinglebanon.com/asi-l-hadath-fortified-cave/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==

===The grotto===
[[File: grottoentrance Mari.jpg|thumb|180px|'Asi-al-Hadath Grotto: Refuge of the persecuted.
Courtesy of Photographer Michel Schbot (1996)]]

'Asi-al-Hadath Grotto is in the vicinity of [[Hadath El Jebbeh|Hadath-El-Gibbet]].&lt;ref&gt;[[René Dussaud|Dussaud, R.]] Topographie Historique de la Syrie Antique, (Paris, 1927), p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; The high altitude of the grotto makes access or regular use of it as living quarters difficult.&lt;ref&gt;L'Architecture Libanaise du XV au XIXe Siècle, Beirut, 1985; Renan, E. Mission de Phenicie, (Paris, 1864); and M. Chronologie des plus anciennes installations de Byblos, "Revue Biblique", LVII, 1950, pp. 590-593, 584-603.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, there is evidence of organized communal arrangements, a man-made water reservoir (3.5m x 1.4 m surface, 1.5 m depth, and 8 cubic meters volume); a stone basin for grinding grain by hand; and two well-like openings, probably used for retrieval and storage of water.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The grotto contains two main rooms: a large living quarter and the grave-yard room.&lt;ref&gt;"Liban Souterrain", pp. 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preservation===
The preliminary examination of the bodies revealed that they were naturally mummified. The grotto in which they had been interred acted as a perfect cast for the buried bodies, eliminating the formation of air pockets that normally facilitate the process of decomposition. Moreover, the low humidity of the grotto's air and the lack of organisms in its soil slowed the total decay of the bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Abi Aoun B., Baroudy F., Ghaouch A. Khawaja P and alias Momies du Liban: Rapport préliminaire sur la découverte archaéologique de 'Asi-al-Hadat (XIIIe siècle), France, Édifra, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dates===
researches carried out by the GERSL &lt;ref name="cavinglebanon.com"/&gt; corroborated the date of 1283 AD, when the area around the cave was part of the [[County of Tripoli]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

====Historical overview====
Between 1102 and 1289, Mount-Lebanon including [[Hadath El Jebbeh]] fell within the confines of the [[County of Tripoli]].&lt;ref&gt;Salibi, K. "The Maronites of Lebanon under Frankish and Mamluk Rule (1099-1516)", ''Arabica''; IV (1957), p. 291, 294; and Hiro, D. ''A History of the Lebanese Civil War'', (New York, 1992), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Tripoli was one of the four fundamental city units of the Crusaders Kingdom of Jerusalem &lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', XVth edition, (1982), pp. 297-310.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[County of Edessa]], the [[Principality of Antioch]], and the Royal Territories.&lt;ref&gt;Strayer, J., ed., ''Dictionary of the Middle Ages'', (New York, 1982), vol. 4, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the Mamelukes overtook Egypt, Syria, and Palestine, and set out to conquer Lebanon and expel the Crusaders. As modern scholars have pointed out, the Maronites, who constituted the majority population of that County,&lt;ref&gt;Salibi, p. 288, 291; Richard, J. ''Le conte de Tripoli sous la dynastie Toulousaine, 1102-1187'', (Paris, 1945), p. 86; and de Vitry, J. ''History of Jerusalem''; translated by Stewart, A., (London, 1897), p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; presented a constant obstacle to the Mamluk:&lt;ref&gt;Hayton, ''Recueil des Historiens des Croisades, R. H. C. Arménien'', (Paris, 1896), pp. 155-156; and Salibi, p. 294. See also de Tyre, G. ''A History of Deeds Done Beyond the Sea''; translated by Babcock, F., (New York, 1943)&lt;/ref&gt;
"in fact, the effective military assistance rendered by the Maronites to the Franks of Tripoli must have been one of the factors that helped the County face repeated Muslim attacks successfully and outlast the other Crusader states." &lt;ref&gt;Salibi, p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt;
It was not long before the Mamluks realized that in order for them to capture Tripoli, they must first subdue the Maronites.&lt;ref&gt;Khoury-Harb, The Maronites, (Beirut, 1985), p. 82; and Salibi, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mamluks launched several assaults against the highland of Tripoli devastating Gibbet Bsharri, Baqufa, Kfarsaroun, Hasrun, al-Hadath and others between 1250 and 1289.&lt;ref&gt;Salibi, p. 294; Al-Maqrizy, Kitab as-suluk li-ma'rifat dual al-Muluk, ed., Mustapha Ziada, (Cairo, 1936), p. 566; and Grousset, R. Histoire des Croisades et du Royaume Franc de Jerusalem, (Paris, 1936), p. 640&lt;/ref&gt; One particular raid was recorded in Ibn 'Abd az-Zahir's chronicle during his service as Secretary of the Court of three Mamluk Sultans (1223-1292 AD). Under the title of "the Account of Capturing the Patriarch of al-Hadath from the Region of Tripoli", he wrote:
"It happened that a Patriarch of the region of Tripoli annoyed, behaved insolently, became haughty, and frightened the governor of Tripoli and all the Francs. He led astray these people of those mountains and the people of those valleys who are of the strayed people. And this continued until he was feared by every neighbor. He entrenched himself in al-Hadath and held his nose high with arrogance and no one succeeded in tricking him... It happened that the governors of the Sultan ambushed him several times but did not find him. Then the Turkmans sought him in his place and tricked him so that they captured and blind-folded him and took him prisoner. The [[List of Maronite Patriarchs|Patriarch]] was one of the infidels and their impious ones, hence the Muslims were relieved of him and were spared his wickedness. His capture was a great conquest, greater even more than the conquest of a stronghold or a fortress..."&lt;ref&gt;Ibn `Abd Al-Zahir, Tasrif al-'usur bi sirat al-Malik al-Mansur, ed., Murad Kamil, (Cairo, 1961), p. 4. Translation mine. Elsewhere, Salibi, K. The Maronite Church in the Middle Ages and its Union with Rome, Oriens Christianus, vol. 40, (1956) p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports similar to that of Ibn 'Abd az-Zahir are to be found in the margins of two Bibles from the al-Hadath region near the Monastery of 'Mar Aboun' (Monastery of Saint Anthony of Qozhayya). The two Bibles were discovered by Patriarch Istephan Duwayhi during his research and writing of Tarikh al-Azmina between 1670 and 1704. The first Bible contains a note written in 1283 by an anonymous Christian who witnessed these events. The account contained in the second Bible is a copy of the first one, and it is dated 1504 AD. These accounts testify to the dramatic events unfolding in 'Asi al-Hadath during the 13th century.
The witness and writer of the original account of 1283 tells us that:
‘’’  "On August 22, 1283 the Muslim soldiers headed toward al-Hadath where the inhabitants took refuge in a magnificent and inaccessible grotto called al-'Asi. The grotto was besieged for seven years. The soldiers received it through the Aman _ a pledge of security and a promise of protection given by Muslim(s) to non-Muslim(s) (Jews and Christians) belonging to dar al-harb (Abode of War) for a specific period of time. Those non-Muslims who belong to dar al-salam (Adobe of Islam) fall under the [[dhimmi]] status.,&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia of Islam_ (Leiden, 1960), p. 426.&lt;/ref&gt; then burned its prefecture (the al-Hadath village) by fire and took the women captives."  ‘’’  &lt;ref&gt;Duwayhi, I., Patriarch T'arikh al-Azmina, ed., Fahd, B., (Beirut, 1983), p. 261. Translation mine. Elsewhere, Salibi, "Arabica", p. 294-295; and Momies Du Liban, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;

These two references are testimonies about a tragic event that occurred in al-Hadath. The accounts coincide in time, place, and action, and confirm an offensive against al-Hadath, thereby providing some historical context for our understanding of this archaeological discovery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cavinglebanon.com/asi-l-hadath-fortified-cave/]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The artifacts===
[[File:Embroided Mari.jpg|thumb| [[Embroider|Embroidered cloth]] depicting peacocks facing the tree of life.]]
Apart from the mummies themselves, a wealth of artifacts found at the site suggest that the people buried there were Maronites from the al-Hadath village, and that their death occurred circa 1283, which corresponds to the reign of the Mamluks and the presence of the Crusaders. Among the many examples of medieval pottery excavated, one pot attracts attention by its Arabic inscription: "This belongs to Boutros from al-Hadath.".&lt;ref&gt;Momies du Liban, pp. 202-204&lt;/ref&gt; Artistic and archaeological significance is manifested in the designs and motifs embroidered on textiles which are identical to designs found in the Syriac Rabbula Gospels, a 6th-century artistic masterpiece which belonged to the Maronite Patriarchate until the mid-15th century, but is now housed in Florence, Italy. A striking copy of two peacocks facing one another with a tree of life in-between remains vivid in color seven hundred years later.&lt;ref&gt;Momies du Liban, pp. 78-80.&lt;/ref&gt; From the Grotto over twenty manuscripts were unearthed. One of which is in Syriac and is a Maronite hymnody, another is in Arabic and bears the name and signature of George son of David, the Archdeacon of al-Hadath.&lt;ref name="Momies du Liban, pp. 146-210"&gt;Momies du Liban, pp. 146-210&lt;/ref&gt; Among the discovered items, several engraved wooden double-toothed combs, thin teeth on one side and coarse on the other, are identical to the combs used by Mamluk women in Egypt and are on display at the Museum of Islamic Art in Cairo, Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Momies du Liban, p. 215, 240, 245, 251; and `Abd Ar-Raziq, A. La Femme au temps des Mamlouks en Egypte, (Cairo, 1973), pp. 321-322&lt;/ref&gt; Many poles, arrows, and notches have been found to be identical with the Mamluk era arrows now on display at the Traditional Art Museum of Aleppo in Syria.&lt;ref&gt;Momies du Liban, pp. 206-208&lt;/ref&gt; An assortment of Crusader and Mamluk coins also invite the speculation that these mummies are of the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;Momies du Liban, pp. 198-201. See Slumberger, G. Numismatique de l'Orient Latin, (Paris, 1878); and Cox, D. The Tripolis Hoard of French Seignorial and Crusader's Coins, (New York, 1933)&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the most important and uncontestable evidence comes from the mummies themselves.

===Yasmine's clothes===
Yasmine wore beneath her shroud three dresses &lt;ref name="Liban 1993 p. 58"&gt;Momies du Liban: Rapport préliminaire sur la découverte archéologique de 'Asi-l-Hadat (XIIIe siècle), GERSL, (France, 1993), p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; one blue, a beige dress over it, and a more elaborate dark beige dress embroidered with silk threads over both. Her head was covered with a headdress under which she wore a headband made of silk. She was adorned with one earring, and a necklace garnished with mouth-blown glass pearls and two coin pieces dated to the era of the Sultan Mamluk Baybars.&lt;ref name="Liban 1993 p. 58"/&gt;

===Customs and rituals===
[[File:Pot Mari.jpg|thumb| Pot excavated from the grotto bearing the following Arabic inscription:"This belongs to Boutros from al-Hadath".]]
Compared to the mummies of Egypt, these mummies were simply buried without any long term or elaborate preparation. A preliminary observation of the mummies already reveals striking parallels with customs and rituals still practiced in present-day Lebanon. An adult woman was found buried with her eighteen-month-old child. The infant was placed at the mother's left shoulder. We are almost certain that the infant is hers since this method of burial is still practiced today in Lebanon when the deaths of both mother and child are caused by complications in the birthing process.&lt;ref name="Momies du Liban, pp. 146-210"/&gt; Most interesting of all is the adult woman who is buried with her infant. She is found with pieces of cotton and cloth inserted in both her vaginal and anal orifices. This preparation of the deceased for viewing is still practiced to our day. In some areas of Lebanon such as the Bekaa Valley, the cotton and cloth pieces are wrapped around a small onion and inserted in the human orifices. Another cultural manifestation is the presence of long black human hair found between Yasmine's toes. It probably belonged to the child's mother. Local tradition has it, that the grieving mother will pull out her hair while kissing the feet of her lost child.&lt;ref&gt;Momies du Liban, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; A talismanic prayer recovered from the grotto requests the intercession of saints in curing a sick child. This prayer resembles the ones still in practice and use among the Maronites in present-day Lebanon, e.g.,. 'Kitab Mar Antonios' -- the Talisman of Saint Anthony of Qozhayya.&lt;ref&gt;Salame-Sarkis, H. Talisman-higab Syriaque Trouve dans la Grotte-Refuge de Hadath al-Gubbeh dans le Liban Nord, "Liban Souterrain", (1989), July No.2, pp. 36-39&lt;/ref&gt; A wooden house key was found on the body of one of the adult female mummies. In accordance with traditional customs, at the funeral of the last surviving member of a family, the key to the dead person's house will be tossed over the roof of that house indicating that the house of that family will forever be closed. In this case the person died in a besieged Grotto, so the key was tossed in the grave &lt;ref&gt;Momies du Liban, pp. 46-48&lt;/ref&gt; similar circumstances mourners will comment by saying, "pity this family, their house is forever closed."

==Importance==
[[File:Script Mari 1.jpg|thumb| Manuscript in [[Syriac alphabet|Estrangelo]] praising the Lord.]]
# These are the first (and perhaps the unique) mummies ever to be discovered in Lebanon.
# An outstanding and unique wooden arrow, discovered complete from tip to nock, with paper fletchings (not feathered, most likely to reduce drag and increase flight trajectory); worth-noting that other fragments of traditional wooden arrows were discovered, mostly with Turkish Nocks style.
# Many similarities exist between the burial of the mummies and some present-day Lebanese burials. For example, one of the infants had long strands of hair between its toes. According to local tradition in some areas of Lebanon today, a mother whose child dies will pull out her hair in lamentation while kissing the feet of her deceased child.{{Citation needed |date=December 2014}} Similarly, today in Lebanon, when the last member of a family dies, the key to the family house is thrown over the roof, indicating that no one will live in the house again.{{Citation needed |date=December 2014}} The presence of a key in the 'Asi-al Hadath cave may also indicate that the last member of a family had died there as well.
# Textiles were not only worn by the mummies, they were also scattered about the cave. Their robes, made from heavy cotton, are embroidered with squares and diamonds of crosses and flowers, which strongly resemble kilim patterns of Turkish nomads.

Employing [[Metabolic network modelling|stoichiometric models]] of metabolism and [[mass spectrometry]] methods with isotopic mass resolution, the transfer of [[Moiety (chemistry)|moieties]] containing isotopic tracers from one [[metabolite]] into another can be elucidated, and information about the metabolic network thus derived.

In his introduction to Islamic Law, Wael B. Hallaq does not use the term ''Muamalat'', but also writes of Islamic law being divided into "four major fields" or "quarters", one of which is "sales". It includes not only laws on buying and selling but also on "partnerships, guaranty, gifts and bequests". &lt;blockquote&gt;"Generally, Muslim jurists gave the main topics of law the title ''kitab'' (“book”), e.g., the Book of Agency, which, in our modern organizational scheme, we recognize as a chapter. A sub-chapter was termed “bab,” which would in turn be broken into a number of fasls (sections). Many jurists conceived of the whole of Islamic law as falling into four major fields, which were called “the four quarters,” i.e., “rituals, sales, marriage and injuries.” Each of these terms, used in this context metaphorically, stands for a staggering variety of subjects that belong to a single quarter. Thus, the “quarter of sales” would encompass, among many other subjects, partnerships, guaranty, gifts and bequests, while that of “marriage” would cover as varied a field as dissolution of matrimony, foster relationships, custody, and wifely and family support. In the same vein, the “quarter of injuries” includes homicide, the Quranic punishments and the laws of war and peace, among other topics. Works generally ended with what we term procedural law, supplemented by coverage of slave manumission. Other works ended instead with inheritance and bequests."&lt;ref name="Hallaq-2009-28"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hallaq|first1=Wael B. |title=An Introduction to Islamic Law |date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-86146-5|page=28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;|group=Note}}

''Mu'amalat'' provides much of the basis for  [[Islamic economics]],  and the instruments of [[Islamic banking and finance|Islamic financing]], and deals not only with Islamic legality but also social and economic repercussions and the rationale of its prohibitions (according to Monzer Kahf).&lt;ref name=MKRDMIE2003:46/&gt;

(''Takaful Basic Examination'' of Islamic Banking and Finance Institute of Malaysia).&lt;ref name="TBECAIIM2012:6"/&gt;

According to at least one author (Monzer Kahf), ''Mu'amalat'' "sets terms and conditions of conduct for economic and financial relationships in the [[Islamic economics|Islamic economy]]" and provides the "grounds on which new instruments" of Islamic financing are developed. It also extends beyond discussions of Islamic legality "to the social and economic repercussions of alternative legal forms of economic or financial relationship and analyze the rationale behinds [sic] it."&lt;ref name=MKRDMIE2003:46&gt;[[#MKRDMIE2003|Kahf, "Relevance definition and methodology of Islamic Economics"]]: p.46&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principles ==
[[File:Islamic-organizational-chart-muamalat.jpg|right|600px|Aspects of Islam including fiqh]]
According to Hosein Askar, Zamir Iqbal, and Abbas Mirakhor, a "significant subset" of muamalat "defines the conduct of economic activities" within the economic system, which "ultimately lays down  the rules for commercial, financial and banking system."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2V2FBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA46&amp;dq=%22Introduction+to+Islamic+Economics%22++a+%22significant+subset%22+of+muamalat+%22defines+the+conduct+of+economic+activities%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Introduction%20to%20Islamic%20Economics%22%20%20a%20%22significant%20subset%22%20of%20muamalat%20%22defines%20the%20conduct%20of%20economic%20activities%22&amp;f=false|title=Introduction to Islamic Economics: Theory and Application|last=Askari|first=Hossein|last2=Iqbal|first2=Zamir|last3=Mirakhor|first3=Abbas|date=2015-02-16|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=|isbn=9781118732960|location=|pages=46|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Basic principles  ===
According to Aznan Hasan, basic principles of muamalat, are that dealings and contracts in Islam ...&lt;ref name="hasanFSIF" /&gt;
*are permissible until evidence is given proving otherwise;&lt;ref name=hasanFSIF/&gt; 
*must be based on mutual consent;&lt;ref name=hasanFSIF/&gt; 
*must be in accordance with the [[maqasid]] (goals of) al shariah;&lt;ref name=hasanFSIF/&gt; 
*should facilitate the circulation of wealth and property;&lt;ref name=hasanFSIF/&gt; 
*should be transparent;&lt;ref name=hasanFSIF/&gt; 
*must observe justice and fair dealing.&lt;ref name=hasanFSIF&gt;Aznan Hasan, ''Fundamentals of Shariah in Islamic Finance'', pp. 193-199, as cited in {{cite web |url=http://takafuleexam.com/e-content/TBE-A/content/18141053PartAEnglish.pdf |title=CHAPTER A1, INTRODUCTION TO ISLAMIC MUAMALAT |website=Takaful Basic Examination, IBFIM |page=7 |accessdate=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theories of Muamalat===
According to Abdullaah Jalil, Asharaf Mohd Ramli, Syahidawati Shahwan  there are four "theories" that underlie the framework of Mu'amalat dealings:&lt;ref name=4IToFM2014:16-7&gt;[[#4IToFM2014|JALIL, et. al., ''FOUR INTRODUCTORY THEORIES OF FIQH MUAMALAT'']]: p.16-7&lt;/ref&gt;
#''Ahliyyah'' (Legal Capacity). Legal capacity refers to whether the person is of sound mind and old enough (puberty) to enter into a legal financial contract.&lt;ref name=4IToFM2014:16-7/&gt;   
#''Mal'' (Property) concerns the nature and types of property that the contract deal with.&lt;ref name=4IToFM2014:16-7/&gt;
##Property must exist at the time of transaction
##seller must be owner of the merchandise
##merchandise must be Islamically lawful
##must be of some use or value
##must be able to be delivered by the seller to the buyer
##the details of the merchandise must be known to both the seller and buyer&lt;ref name="IBaFiM2013-120"&gt;{{cite book|last1=ABʻAZIZ|first1=MUHAMMAD RIDWAN |title=Islamic Banking and Finance in Malaysia; System, Issues and Challenges |date=2013 |publisher=Al Manhal |page=120 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=HWBkCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=muamalat+contracts#v=onepage&amp;q=muamalat%20contracts&amp;f=false |accessdate=5 April 2017|chapter=6. Muamalat Contracts in Islamic Banking and Finance |isbn=9789670393728 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   
#''Milkiyyah'' (Ownership), concerns the types, methods and scopes of ownership, that affect the relationship between the property and its owner in Islamic jurisprudence.&lt;ref name=4IToFM2014:16-7/&gt; 
#'''Aqd'' (Contract), describes the framework or structure of a contract in fiqh.&lt;ref name=4IToFM2014:16-7/&gt;

Jalil, Ramli and Shahwan also note that the development of ''Mu'amalat'' rules is less strict than '''Ibadat''.

|}

=== General Prohibitions ===
According to muamalat, contracts ...
*should not involve the selling or buying of [[Islamic dietary laws#Intoxicants|alcohol]] or any other ''[[haram]]'' substances.&lt;ref name=TBECAIIM2012:8&gt;[[#TBECAIIM2012|TBE, "CHAPTER A1, INTRODUCTION TO ISLAMIC MUAMALAT", 2012]]: p.8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IBFIM-intro-1.2.2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://takafuleexam.com/e-content/TBE-A/content/18141053PartAEnglish.pdf |title=CHAPTER A1, INTRODUCTION TO ISLAMIC MUAMALAT |website=Takaful Basic Examination, IBFIM |pages=8| accessdate=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*should not include any financial deal on the basis of usury (''[[riba]]'')&lt;ref name=IBFIM-intro-1.2.2/&gt;&lt;ref name=TBECAIIM2012:8/&gt;
*should not involve gambling (''[[maisir]]'')&lt;ref name=IBFIM-intro-1.2.2/&gt;&lt;ref name=TBECAIIM2012:8/&gt; 
*should not involves major uncertainty (''[[gharar]] fahish'')&lt;ref name=IBFIM-intro-1.2.2/&gt;&lt;ref name=TBECAIIM2012:8/&gt; (minor uncertainty is permissible).

=== Contracts ===
At least one source (a scholar identified as "Barbarti") defines ''aqad'' (contract) as a “legal relationship created by the conjunction of two declarations, from which flow legal consequences with regard to the subject matter”.
&lt;ref name=MNCSIF:33&gt;[[#MNCSIF|Chik, ''Shariah in Islamic Finance'']]: p.33&lt;/ref&gt;

The essential elements of a contract are contracting parties (''aqidan'),'' a subject matter ''('Ma'aqud Alaih''), and a legally binding offer and acceptance (''Sighah''). They may be written, verbal or even indicated by signs (in the case of speechless person).&lt;ref name=MNCSIF:34&gt;[[#MNCSIF|Chik, ''Shariah in Islamic Finance'']]: p.34&lt;/ref&gt;

Muamalat contracts are prominent in Islamic banking where they are "fundamental factors" that determine whether a "transaction is valid or not".&lt;ref name="IBaFiM2013-117"&gt;{{cite book|last1=ABʻAZIZ|first1=MUHAMMAD RIDWAN |title=Islamic Banking and Finance in Malaysia; System, Issues and Challenges |date=2013 |publisher=Al Manhal |page=117 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=HWBkCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=muamalat+contracts#v=onepage&amp;q=muamalat%20contracts&amp;f=false |accessdate=5 April 2017|chapter=6. Muamalat Contracts in Islamic Banking and Finance |isbn=9789670393728 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{further|Islamic banking and finance#Islamic financial transaction terminology}}
Some contracts in ''Mu'amalat'' include: 
* Sale Contract; 
* Cost plus profit (''[[murabahah]]''); 
* Debt (''al-Qard''); 
* Hiring/leasing (''al-Ijarah''); 
* Lending (''al-I'arah''); 
* Agency (''wakalah''); 
* Mortgage (''al-Rahn''); 
* Partnership (''[[Profit and loss sharing#Musharakah|Musharakah]]''); 
* Profit Sharing (''[[Profit and loss sharing#Mudarabah|Mudarabah]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediu.edu.my/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/BFIQ2023.pdf Introduction to Fiqh Muamalat] Al-Madinah International University, page 2&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23608">The '''Neo-Concrete Movement''' (1959–61) was a Brazilian art movement, which developed from [[Rio de Janeiro]]’s [[Grupo Frente]], a coalition of artists working in [[Concrete Art]]. Neoconcrete artists rejected the pure rationalist approach of concrete art and embraced a more phenomenological and less scientific art. [[Ferreira Gullar]] inspired Neo-Concrete philosophy through his essay “Theory of the Non-Object” (1959) and wrote the “Neo-Concrete Manifesto” (1959) which outlines what Neo-Concrete art should be. [[Lygia Clark]], [[Hélio Oiticica]], and [[Lygia Pape]] were among the primary leaders of this movement.

== Background ==
After [[World War One]], Europe witnessed a boom of art movements based upon rationalism such as [[De Stijl]] and [[Bauhaus]]. Artists believed humanity would be able to achieve progress through its ability to reason. In Latin America, ideas of rationalist and non-objective art took root in the early 1950s in reaction to the muralism controversy.&lt;ref name=LatinAmericanArt20thCentury-2004&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lucie-Smith|first1=Edward|title=Latin American Art of the 20th Century|date=2004|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|location=London|isbn=978-0-500-20356-9|pages=121, 137|oclc=57007345}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governments such as the Mexican government utilized muralists to create propaganda. Under repressive Latin American governments, artists rebelled against the idea of aiding the political regime through figurative art; therefore geometric abstraction and concretism ushered in an art that did not connote anything political or have really any meaning at all.

[[Concrete Art]] was able to flourish beneath these repressive regimes because it held no political messages or incendiary material.&lt;ref name=LatinAmericanArt20thCentury-2004 /&gt; In Brazil, ideas of rationalist art and geometric abstraction arose in the early 1950s following the establishment of a democratic republic in 1946.  The period from 1946 to 1964 is known as the [[Second Brazilian Republic]].&lt;ref name ="Flynn"&gt;Flynn, Peter. Flynn, Peter. ''Nations of the Modern World, Brazil: A Political Analysis''. Boulder: Westview Press, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; Groups such as Grupo Ruptura in [[Sao Paulo]] and Grupo Frente in Rio de Janeiro rose. Specifically Ruptura followed the ideal of pure [[mathematical art]] which does not connote meaning outside of what it is.&lt;ref name ="Balderston"&gt;''Encyclopaedia of Contemporary Latin American and Caribbean Cultures''. Ed. Daniel Balderston, Mike Gonzalez, and Ana M. Lopez. London: Routledge, 2002. 1032.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Neo-Concrete art movement arose when Grupo Frente realized that Concretism was “naïve and somewhat colonialist” and an “overly rational conception of abstract structure.”&lt;ref name ="Brett"&gt;Brett, Guy. "Lygia Clark and Helio Oiticica." ''Latin American Artists of the Nineteenth Century.'' New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1993. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961 as the political tides began to turn, the Neo-Concrete artists disbanded no longer content to limit themselves to this one philosophy. [[Lygia Clark]] and [[Hélio Oiticica]], leaders of the Neo-Concrete movement, put their energy into Conceptual Art. Art historians often refer to Neo-Concretism as the precursor to Conceptual Art because of the foundation of “abstruse metaphysics.”&lt;ref name=LatinAmericanArt20thCentury-2004 /&gt; On April 1, 1964, a military coup removed [[Joao Goulart]] and established a military government in Brazil until 1985.&lt;ref name="Flynn"/&gt; The increase of violence called for a new kind of art that had the potential to carry meaning and deconstruct traditional thought even further. This came in the form of [[Conceptual Art]].

== The Neo-Concrete Manifesto and the push against Concretism ==
Brazilian poet and writer [[Ferreira Gullar]] wrote the Neo-Concrete Manifesto in 1959 and described a work of art as “something which amounts to more than the sum of its constituent elements; something which analysis may break down into various elements but which can only be understood phenomenologically.”&lt;ref name ="Gullar"&gt;Gullar, Ferreira. “Neo-Concrete Manifesto.” ''History of Modern Latin American Art Course Reader.'' Spokane: Whitworth University, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the Concrete Art movement, Gullar was calling for an art that was not based upon rationalism or in pursuit of pure form. He sought works of art that became active once the viewer was involved. Neo-concrete art must disassemble the limitations of the object and “express complex human realities.”&lt;ref name ="Gullar"/&gt;

While Concretism built its art upon the basis of logic and objective knowledge with color, space, and form conveying universalism and objectivity, the Neo-Concrete artists saw colors, space, and form as “not [belonging] to this or that artistic language, but to the living and indeterminate experience of man.”&lt;ref name ="Amor"&gt;Amor, Monica. “From Work to Frame, In Between, and Beyond: Lygia Clark and Hélio Oiticica, 1959–1964.” ''Grey Room'' 38 (Winter 2010): 20-37.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Neo-Concrete Art still maintained Concretism as the foundation for their ideas, Neo-Concretists believed objectivity and mathematical principles alone could not accomplish the Concretist goal of creating a transcendental visual language.

Neo-Concretists believed that artworks were not simply static representations or forms; rather “art should be like living organisms” &lt;ref name ="Brett"/&gt; In Lygia Clark’s theoretical statement written to address the intentions of the Neo-Concrete artists, she explains that as artists they wish to “found a new, expressive ‘space’.”&lt;ref name ="Bois"&gt;Bois, Yve-Alain and Lygia Clark. “Nostalgia of the Body.” ''The MIT Press 69'' (Summer 1994): 85-109.&lt;/ref&gt; This movement believed that through a direct relationship between the artwork and the viewer this “new, expressive ‘space’” could be constructed.&lt;ref name ="Bois"/&gt; Neo-Concrete artists sought to create a multi-sensorial space which caused the spectator to feel more acutely their own body and existence.

Clark also wrote of how Neo-Concretism sought to decipher the nature of humanity by creating a “medium of expression” which allowed people to “become aware of unity as an organic, living whole.”&lt;ref name ="Clark"&gt;Clark, Lygia. “1960: Death of the Plane.” ‘’October’’ 69 (Summer 1994): 96.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not just restoring an awareness of the spectator’s body but also of humanity’s communal existence.

The first Neo-Concrete Exhibition was held in Rio de Janeiro in March 1959, and the exhibiting artists were [[Amilcar de Castro]], [[Ferreira Gullar]], [[Franz Weissmann]], [[Lygia Clark]], [[Lygia Pape]], [[Reynaldo_Jardim]], and [[Theon Spanudis]].&lt;ref name ="Bois"/&gt;

== ''Neo-Concrete Manifesto'' ==
This manifesto was written by [[Ferreira Gullar]], and was signed by [[Amilcar de Castro]], [[Ferreira Gullar]], [[Franz Weissmann]], [[Lygia Clark]], [[Lygia Pape]], [[Reynaldo Jardim]] and [[Theon Spanudis]]. It was published on 22 of March 1959 in ''Journal do Brazil.''

We use the term “neo-concrete” to differentiate ourselves from those committed to non-figurative “[[geometric art|geometric]]” art ([[neo-plasticism]], [[constructivism (art)|constructivism]], [[suprematism]], [[Ulm School of Design|Ulm School]]) and in particular the kind of concrete art that is influenced by a dangerously extreme rationalism. Compelled by their experiences, the painters, sculptors, engravers, and writers participating in this First Neo-concrete Exhibition came to the conclusion that it was necessary to revise the theoretical principles on which concrete art has been founded, none of which offers a rationale for the expressive potential they feel their art contains.

Born with [[cubism]], as a reaction against the impressionist disintegration of poetic language, it was natural that so-called geometric art should situate itself in a position diametrically opposed to the technical and allusive resources of ordinary painting. The new achievements of physics and mechanics, in opening up a wide perspective for objective thought, encouraged, among those who continued this revolution, the tendency towards an everincreasing rationalization of the processes and purposes of painting. A mechanicalist notion of construction invaded the language of painters and sculptors, generating, in turn, equally extreme responses of a reactionary nature, such as [[magic realism|magical]] or irrationalist [[realism (arts)|realism]], [[Dada art|Dada]], or [[surrealism]]. Therefore, there is no doubt that the true artists—as is the case with, for example, [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]] or [[Nikolaus Pevsner|Pevsner]]—constructed their works following those theories that consecrated [[scientific objectivity]] and mechanical precision, but in that hand-to-hand combat with expression they overcame the limits imposed by theory. Yet the work of those artists has been interpreted to this day from theoretical positions that that same work denied. We propose a reinterpretation of neo-plasticism, constructivism, and other similar movements, basing ourselves on their expressive successes and making the work of art take precedence over theory. If we were to attempt to understand Mondrian’s painting starting from his theories, we would be forced to choose one over the other. We either find the prophecy of the complete integration of art in daily life to be possible (and we see in Mondrian’s work the first steps in that direction), or we view that integration as ever more remote, in which case his work seems to have failed. Either the vertical and the horizontal are truly the fundamental rhythms of the universe, and Mondrian’s oeuvre is the application of that universal principle, or the principle fails, and his work turns out to be based on an illusion. But the truth is that Mondrian’s work is there, alive and fertile, above these theoretical contradictions. It is useless to view Mondrian as the destroyer of the surface, of the plane and the line, if we do not perceive the new space that that destruction constructed.

The same can be said of [[Georges Vantongerloo|Vantongerloo]] or Pevsner. It does not matter what mathematical equations are at the root of a sculpture or a painting by Vantongerloo, because only in the experience of its direct perception does the work provide the “meaning” of its rhythms and colors. Whether Pevsner started from figures of descriptive geometry or not is irrelevant, when one confronts the new space that his sculptures generate and the cosmic-organic expression that, through it, its forms reveal. Determining the ways in which artistic objects and scientific instruments, or the artist’s intuition and the physicist’s and engineer’s objective thought, converged may be interesting from a cultural standpoint, but from an aesthetic standpoint, the work of art provokes interest precisely because of what it possesses that transcends these external circumstances—because of the universe of existential meanings that merge and are revealed in the work of art.

[[Kazimir Malevich|Malevich]], having recognized the superiority of “pure perception in art,” placed his theoretical definitions in a position that was safe from the limitations of rationalism and mechanicalism, projecting a transcendent dimension in his paintings that guarantees him a notable relevance today. But Malevich’s daring cost him dearly, in simultaneously opposing both figurative art and mechanicalist abstraction, for to this day certain rationalist theoreticians consider him a naïf who did not understand the true sense of the new plastic arts … In fact, Malevich already expressed, within “geometric” painting, his dissatisfaction, his desire to transcend the rational and the sensorial, which today is undeniably manifest.

Neo-concretism, emerging out of the need to express the complex reality of modern man with the structural language of the new plastic arts, denies the validity of the attitudes espoused by scientificism and positivism in art and reconsiders the problem of expression, incorporating the new “verbal” dimensions created by constructive, non-figurative art. Rationalism divests art of all autonomy and substitutes the untransferable qualities of the work of art with notions of scientific objectivity. Thus, the concepts of form, space, time, and structure—which in the arts are linked to an existential meaning, emotive and affective—are confused with their theoretical application by science. In fact, in the name of preconceived ideas that today’s philosophy denounces ([[Maurice Merleau-Ponty|M. Merleau-Ponty]], [[Ernst Cassirer|E. Cassirer]], [[Susanne Katherina Langer|S. Langer]])—and that are collapsing in every field, starting with modern biology, which has overcome Pavlovian mechanicalism—the concretist-rationalists still view man as a machine among machines and attempt to limit art to the expression of that theoretical reality.

We do not conceive of art either as a “machine” or as an “object” but as a quasi-corpus, that is, an entity whose reality is not exhausted in the external relationships
of its elements; an entity that, though analytically divisible into its parts, only gives itself up fully to a direct, phenomenological approach. We believe that the work of art overcomes the material mechanism upon which it rests, not due to some virtue lying outside this Earth: it overcomes it by transcending those mechanical relationships (which is the object of Gestalt theory) and by creating for itself a tacit signification (Merleau-Ponty) that emerges in it for the first time. If we had to search for a simile for the work of art, we could not find it, therefore, either in a machine or in objects taken objectively, but rather, as S. Langer and [[Vladimir Weidlé|V. Wleidlé]] [sic] argue, in living organisms. Furthermore, this comparison would not be sufficient to express the specific reality of the aesthetic organism.

Since the work of art is not limited to occupying a place in objective space—but rather transcends it in basing a new signification in it—the objective notions of time, space, form, structure, color, etc. are not sufficient to understand the work of art, to fully explain its “reality.” The lack of an adequate terminology for expressing a world that does not succumb to notions led art critics indiscriminately to employ words that are unfaithful to the complexity of the created work. The influence of technology and science was manifest here as well, to the degree that today, with their roles reversed, certain artists, confused by that terminology, attempt to make art starting from these objective notions in order to apply them as a creative method. Inevitably, the artists who work in this fashion only reveal a priori notions, since they are constrained by a method that already prescribes the results of their work before they begin. By avoiding intuitive creation, by reducing himself to an objective body in an objective space, with his paintings the rationalist concrete artist hardly demands, from himself and from the viewer, a stimulating and reflexive reaction. He speaks to the eye as an instrument and not to the eye as a human means of possessing the world and of giving oneself to it; he speaks to the machine-eye and not the body-eye.

Given that the work of art transcends mechanical space, the notions of cause and effect lose all validity in it, and the notions of time, space, form, and color are integrated
in such a way—since they lacked any existence, as those notions, prior to the work—that it would be impossible to speak of them as elements that can be broken down. Neo-concrete art, affirming the absolute integration of these elements, vouches for the ability of its “geometric” vocabulary to assume the expression of complex human realities, manifest in many works by Mondrian, Malevich, Pevsner, Gabo, Sofia Taeuber-Arp, etc. If even these artists at times confused the concept of mechanical form with expressive form, it is important to clarify that, in the language of art, these so-called geometric forms lose the objective character of geometry in order to become vehicles for the imagination. Gestalt theory, in that it is still a psychology based on the concept of causation, also proves insufficient in helping us understand that phenomenon that dissolves the causally definable realities of space and form and presents them as time, as the spatialization of the work. By “spatialization of the work” is meant the fact that it is continually making itself present,
it is always regaining the impulse that generated it and of which it was, in turn, the origin. And if this description remits us likewise to the first—full—experience of the real, that is because neo-concrete art seeks nothing more than to revive that experience. Neo-concrete art creates a new expressive space.

This position is equally valid for neo-concrete poetry, which condemns in concrete poetry the same mechanicalist objectivism of painting. The rationalist concrete poets also established the imitation of the machine as an ideal for their art. For them, too, space and time are but external relationships between object-words. Now, if that is the case, the page is reduced to a graphic space and the word to an element of that space. As in painting, the visual here is reduced to the optical, and the poem does not transcend the graphic dimension. Neo-concrete poetry rejects such spurious notions and, faithful to the very nature of language, reaffirms the poem as a temporal entity. In time and space, the word unfolds its complex signifying nature. The page in neo-concrete poetry is the spatialization of verbal time: it is pause, silence, time. It is evidently not a matter of returning to the concept of time that characterizes discursive poetry; for while language flows in succession in discursive poetry, in concrete poetry language opens up in duration. Therefore, unlike rationalist concretism, which views the word as object and transforms it into a mere optical signal, neo-concrete poetry restores it to its condition as “verbum,” that is, to the human mode of presentation of the real. In neo-concrete poetry, language does not slip away, but rather remains.

In its turn, neo-concrete prose, opening up a new field for expressive experiments, recovers language as flux, overcoming its syntactical contingencies and giving new, fuller meaning to certain solutions that until now were erroneously accepted as poetry. This is how, in painting as in poetry, in prose as in sculpture and printmaking, neo-concrete art reaffirms the independence of artistic creation in the face of objective knowledge (science) and practical knowledge (ethics, politics, industry, etc.).

The participants in this First Neo-concrete Exhibition do not constitute a “group.” They are not united by dogmatic principles. The evident affinity of their explorations in various fields has brought them together and led them to meet here. The commitment that obliges them commits each one of them, first and foremost, to their individual experience; they will remain together as long as the deep affinity that brought them together endures.

&lt;!--... Attention:  THIS IS AN OUTLINE

        part of the set of 740+ outlines listed at
             [[Portal:Contents/Outlines]].

                 Wikipedia outlines are
              a special type of list article.
              They make up one of Wikipedia's

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to semiotics:

'''[[Semiotics]]''' &amp;ndash; study of [[meaning-making]], signs and sign processes (semiosis), indication, designation, likeness, analogy, metaphor, symbolism, signification, and communication. Semiotics is closely related to the field of linguistics, which, for its part, studies the structure and meaning of language more specifically. Also called semiotic studies, or semiology (in the Saussurean tradition).

{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

== What ''type'' of thing is semiotics? ==

Semiotics can be described as all of the following:

* [[Academic discipline]] &amp;ndash; branch of knowledge that is taught and researched at the college or university level. Disciplines are defined (in part), and recognized by the academic journals in which research is published, and the learned societies and academic departments or faculties to which their practitioners belong.
* [[Social science]] &amp;ndash; field of study concerned with society and human behaviours.

== Branches of semiotics ==

=== Three main branches ===
* [[Semantics]] &amp;ndash; relation between signs and the things to which they refer; their ''denotata'', or [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]
* [[Syntax|Syntactics]] &amp;ndash; relations among signs in formal structures
* [[Pragmatics]] &amp;ndash; relation between signs and the effects they have on the people who use them

=== Subfields ===
* [[Biosemiotics]] &amp;ndash; growing field that studies the production, action and [[Interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of [[Sign (semiotics)|signs]] and [[code]]s in the [[Biology|biological]] realm. Biosemiotics attempts to integrate the findings of scientific biology and [[semiotics]], representing a [[Paradigm shift|paradigmatic shift]] in the [[Western world|occidental]] scientific view of [[life]], demonstrating that [[semiosis]] (sign process, including [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]] and interpretation) is its immanent and intrinsic feature.
* [[Cognitive semiotics]] &amp;ndash; study of meaning-making by employing and integrating methods and theories developed in the cognitive sciences as well as in the human sciences. It involves conceptual and textual analysis as well as experimental and ethnographic investigations.
* [[Computational semiotics]] &amp;ndash; attempts to engineer the process of [[semiosis]], in the study of and design for [[Human-Computer Interaction]], and mimic aspects of human [[cognition]] through [[artificial intelligence]] and [[knowledge representation]].
* [[Cultural semiotics]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Design semiotics]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Product semiotics]] &amp;ndash; study of the use of signs in the design of physical products. Introduced by [[Rune Monö]] while teaching Industrial Design at the Institute of Design, Umeå University, Sweden.
* [[Law and semiotics]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Semiotic literary criticism|Literary semiotics]] &amp;ndash; approach to literary criticism informed by the theory of signs or semiotics. Semiotics, tied closely to the structuralism pioneered by Ferdinand de Saussure, was extremely influential in the development of literary theory out of the formalist approaches of the early twentieth century.
* [[Music semiology]] &amp;ndash; "There are strong arguments that music inhabits a semiological realm which, on both ontogenetic and phylogenetic levels, has developmental priority over verbal language." (Middleton 1990, p.&amp;nbsp;172)  See Nattiez (1976, 1987, 1989), Stefani (1973, 1986), Baroni (1983), and ''Semiotica'' (66: 1–3 (1987)).
* [[Semiology (Gregorian Chant)|Gregorian chant semiology]] &amp;ndash; current avenue of [[palaeography|palaeographical]] research in [[Gregorian chant]] which is revising the [[Solesmes Abbey|Solesmes]] school of interpretation.
* [[Organisational semiotics]] &amp;ndash; examines the nature, characteristics and features of information, and studies how information can be best used in the context of organised activities and business domains. Organisational semiotics treats organisations as information systems in which information is created, processed, distributed, stored and used.
* [[Semiotic anthropology]] &amp;ndash; semiotics of Charles Sanders Peirce and Roman Jakobson applied to anthropology.
* [[Semiotic engineering]] &amp;ndash; views HCI as computer-mediated communication between designers and users at interaction time. The system speaks for its designers in various types of conversations specified at design time. These conversations communicate the designers' understanding of who the users are, what they know the users want or need to do, in which preferred ways, and why.
* [[Semiotic information theory]] &amp;ndash; considers the information content of signs and expressions as it is conceived within the semiotic or sign-relational framework developed by Charles Sanders Peirce.
* [[Social semiotics]] &amp;ndash; expands the interpretable semiotic landscape to include all cultural codes, such as in slang, fashion, and advertising. It considers social connotations, including meanings related to ideology and power structures, in addition to denotative meanings of signs.
** [[Urban semiotics]] &amp;ndash; study of meaning in urban form as generated by signs, symbols, and their social connotations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Keller, Suzanne |title=Review |journal=Contemporary Sociology, Vol. 17, No. 3. (May, 1988), pp. 346-348 |jstor=2069642}}&lt;/ref&gt; It focuses on material objects of the built environment, such as streets, squares, parks, and buildings, but also abstract cultural constructs such as building codes, planning documents, unbuilt designs, real estate advertising, and popular discourse about the city,&lt;ref&gt;Gottdienier, M., and Lagopoulos, Alexandros, eds.  ''The City and the Sign: An Introduction to Urban Semiotics'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1986.  p.5&lt;/ref&gt; such as architectural criticism and real estate blogs.
* [[Theatre semiotics]] &amp;ndash; extends or adapts semiotics onstage. Key theoricians include [[Keir Elam]].
* [[Visual semiotics]] &amp;ndash; analyses visual signs. See also [[visual rhetoric]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Visual_Rhetoric/Semiotics_and_Visual_Rhetoric Wikibooks.org]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Zoosemiotics]] &amp;ndash; study of animal meaning-making and communication.

== History of semiotics ==

* [[Semiotics#History|History of semiotics]]
* [[Tartu-Moscow Semiotic School]] &amp;ndash; scientific school of thought that was formed in 1964 and led by [[Juri Lotman]]. Among the other members of this school were [[Boris Uspensky]], [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (philologist)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]], [[Vladimir Toporov]], [[Mikhail Gasparov]], [[Alexander Piatigorsky]], [[Isaak I. Revzin]], and others. As a result of their collective work, they established a theoretical framework around the semiotics of culture.

'''Plant genetics''' is the study of [[Gene|genes]], [[genetic variation]], and [[heredity]] specifically in [[Plant|Plants]].&lt;ref name="griffiths2000sect60"&gt;{{cite book|title=An Introduction to Genetic Analysis|publisher=W.

Plant genetics is similar in many ways to animal genetics but differs in a few key areas.

The discoverer of genetics is [[Gregor Mendel]], a late 19th-century scientist and [[Augustinian]] [[friar]]. Mendel studied "trait inheritance", patterns in the way traits are handed down from parents to offspring. He observed that organisms (most famously pea plants) inherit traits by way of discrete "units of inheritance". This term, still used today, is a somewhat ambiguous definition of what is referred to as a [[gene]]. Much of Mendel's work with plants still forms the basis for modern plant genetics.

Plants, like all known organisms, use DNA to pass on their traits. Animal genetics often focuses on parentage and lineage, but this can sometimes be difficult in plant genetics due to the fact that plants can, unlike most animals, can [[Self-Fertilization|self-fertilize]]. [[Speciation]] can be easier in many plants due to unique genetic abilities, such as being well adapted to [[Polyploid|polyploidy]]. Plants are unique in that they are able to produce energy-dense carbohydrates via [[photosynthesis]], a process which is achieved by use of a structure mostly exclusive to plants: [[Chloroplast|chloroplasts]]. Chloroplasts, like the superficially similar [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]], possess their own DNA. Chloroplasts thus provide an additional reservoir for genes and genetic diversity, and an extra layer of genetic complexity not found in animals. 

The study of plant genetics has major economic impacts: many staple crops are [[Genetically modified crops|genetically modified]] to increase yields, confer pest and disease resistance, provide resistance to herbicides, or to increase their nutritional value. 

==History==
{{See also|History of genetics}}{{Expand section|date=June 2018}}
The earliest evidence of plant [[Domestication of wheat|domestication]] found has been dated to 11,000 years before present in ancestral wheat. While initially selection may have happened unintentionally, it is very likely that by 5,000 years ago farmers had a basic understanding of heredity and inheritance, the foundation of genetics.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Allard|first=Robert W.|date=1999-12|title=History of Plant Population Genetics|url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.genet.33.1.1|journal=Annual Review of Genetics|language=en|volume=33|issue=1|pages=1–27|doi=10.1146/annurev.genet.33.1.1|issn=0066-4197}}&lt;/ref&gt; This selection over time gave rise to new crop species and varieties that are the basis of the crops we grow, eat and research today.[[File:Gregor Mendel oval.jpg|thumb|203x203px|Gregor Mendel, the "Father of genetics"]]The field of plant genetics began with the work of [[Gregor Mendel|Gregor Johann Mendel]], who is often called the "father of genetics". He was an [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] [[priest]] and scientist born on 20 July 1822 in Austria-Hungary. He worked at the Abbey of St. Thomas in Bruno , where his organism of choice for studying [[Heredity|inheritance]] and  [[Trait (biological)|trait]]s was the [[Pea|pea plant]]. Mendel's work tracked many [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] traits of pea plants, such as their height, flower color, and seed characteristics. Mendel showed that the inheritance of these traits follows two particular [[Mendelian inheritance|laws]], which were later named after him. His seminal work on genetics, “Versuche über Pflanzen-Hybriden” (Experiments on Plant Hybrids), was published in 1866, but went almost entirely unnoticed until 1900 when prominent botanists in the UK, like [[Sir Gavin de Beer]], recognized its importance and re-published an English translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bshs.org.uk/bshs-translations/mendel|title=1. Gregor Mendel: Versuche über Pflanzen-Hybriden|website=www.bshs.org.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mendel died in 1884. The significance of Mendel's work was not recognized until the turn of the 20th century. Its rediscovery prompted the foundation of modern genetics. His discoveries, deduction of [[Punnett square|segregation ratios]], and subsequent [[Mendel's law|laws]] have not only been used in research to gain a better understanding of plant genetics, but also play a large role in [[plant breeding]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Mendel's works along with the works of [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Alfred Russel Wallace|Alfred Wallace]] on selection provided the basis for much of genetics as a discipline. 

In the early 1900s, botanists and statisticians began to examine the segregation ratios put forth by Mendel. W.E. Castle discovered that while individual traits may segregate and change over time with selection, that when selection is stopped and environmental effects are taken into account, the genetic ratio stops changing and reach a sort of stasis, the foundation of [[Population genetics|Population Genetics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Castle|first=W.

Around this same time, genetic and plant breeding experiments in [[maize]] began. Maize that has been self-pollinated experiences a phenomena called [[inbreeding depression]]. Researchers, like [[Nils Heribert-Nilsson]], recognized that by crossing plants and forming hybrids, they were not only able to combine traits from two desirable parents, but the crop also experienced [[heterosis]] or [[hybrid vigor]]. This was the beginning of identifying gene interactions or [[epistasis]]. By the early 1920's, [[Donald Forsha Jones]] had invented a method that led to the first hybrid maize seed that were available commercially.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ars.usda.gov/oc/timeline/corn/|title=corn : USDA ARS|website=www.ars.usda.gov|access-date=2018-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The large demand for hybrid seed in the U.S. Corn Belt by the mid 1930's led to a rapid growth in the seed production industry and ultimately seed research. The strict requirements for producing hybrid seed led to the development of careful population and inbred line maintenance, keeping plants isolated and unable to out-cross, which produced plants that better allowed researchers to tease out different genetic concepts. The structure of these populations allowed scientist such a [[Theodosius Dobzhansky|T. Dobzhansky]], [[Sewall Wright|S. Wright]], and [[Ronald Fisher|R.A. Fisher]] to develop [[evolutionary biology]] concepts as well as explore [[speciation]] over time and the statistics underlying plant genetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/19391601696|title=CAB Direct|website=www.cabdirect.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wright|first=Sewall|date=1940-05|title=Breeding Structure of Populations in Relation to Speciation|url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/280891?journalCode=an|journal=The American Naturalist|language=en|volume=74|issue=752|pages=232–248|doi=10.1086/280891|issn=0003-0147}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=f7su1R-NYwsC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=dobzhansky&amp;ots=HI9NizMWrr&amp;sig=cg7p4ZWKjxIOZ5LcbACCUgcL3s0#v=onepage&amp;q=dobzhansky&amp;f=false|title=Genetics of the Evolutionary Process|last=Dobzhansky|first=Theodosius|last2=Dobzhansky|first2=Theodosius Grigorievich|date=1970|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=9780231083065|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their work layed the foundations for future genetic discoveries such as [[linkage disequilibrium]] in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lewontin|first=R.

While breeding experiments were taking place, other scientists such as [[Nikolai Vavilov]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ivanovich)|first=Vavilov, N. I. (Nikolaĭ|last2=1887-1943|date=1926|title=Studies on the origin of cultivated plants|url=http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201300329962|journal=AGRIS: International Information System for the Agricultural Science and Technology|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [https://tgrc.ucdavis.edu/charlie.aspx Charles M. Rick] were interested in wild [[progenitor]] species of modern crop plants. Botanists between the 1920's and 1960's often would travel to regions of high plant [[Genetic diversity|diversity]] and seek out wild species that had given rise to domesticated species after selection. Determining how crops changed over time with selection was initially based on morphological features. It developed over time to chromosomal analysis, then [[genetic marker]] analysis, and eventual [[Genome-wide complex trait analysis|genomic analysis]]. Identifying traits and their underlying genetics allowed for transferring useful genes and the traits they controlled from either wild or mutant plants to crop plants. Understanding and manipulating of plant genetics was in its heyday during the [[Green Revolution]] brought about by [[Norman Borlaug]]. During this time, the molecule of heredity, DNA, was also discovered, which allowed scientists to actually examine and manipulate genetic information directly.

==DNA==
[[Image:DNA Overview.png|thumb|100px|The structure of part of a DNA double helix]]
[[Deoxyribonucleic acid]] (DNA) is a [[nucleic acid]] that contains the genetic instructions used in the development and functioning of all known living organisms and some viruses. The main role of DNA molecules is the long-term storage of information. DNA is often compared to a set of blueprints or a recipe, or a code, since it contains the instructions needed to construct other components of cells, such as proteins and [[RNA]] molecules. The DNA segments that carry this genetic information are called genes, and their location within the genome are referred to as [[genetic loci]], but other DNA sequences have structural purposes, or are involved in regulating the use of this genetic information. 

[[Geneticist]]s, including [[plant geneticist]]s, use this sequence of DNA to their advantage to better find and understand the role of different genes within a given genome. Through research and plant breeding, manipulation of different plant genes and loci encoded by the DNA sequence of the plant chromosomes by various methods can be done to produce different or desired [[genotype|genotypes]] that result in different or desired [[phenotype|phenotypes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dudley|first=J. W.|date=1993-07-08|title=Molecular Markers in Plant Improvement: Manipulation of Genes Affecting Quantitative Traits|url=https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/cs/abstracts/33/4/CS0330040660|journal=Crop Science|language=en|volume=33|issue=4|pages=660–668|doi=10.2135/cropsci1993.0011183X003300040003x|issn=0011-183X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plant Specific Genetics ==
Plants, like all other known living organisms, pass on their traits using [[DNA]]. Plants however are unique from other living organisms in the fact that they have [[Chloroplast|Chloroplasts]]. Like [[mitochondria]], chloroplasts have their own [[chloroplast#chloroplast DNA|DNA]]. Like animals, plants experience [[somatic mutation]]s regularly, but these mutations can contribute to the [[germ line]] with ease, since flowers develop at the ends of branches composed of somatic cells. People have known of this for centuries, and mutant branches are called "[[Sport (botany)|sports]]". If the fruit on the sport is economically desirable, a new [[cultivar]] may be obtained.

Some plant species are capable of [[self-fertilization]], and some are nearly exclusively self-fertilizers. This means that a plant can be both mother and father to its offspring, a rare occurrence in animals. Scientists and hobbyists attempting to make crosses between different plants must take special measures to prevent the plants from self-fertilizing. In [[plant breeding]], people create [[Hybrid_(biology)#Hybrid_plants|hybrids]] between plant species for economic and aesthetic reasons. For example, the yield of [[Corn]] has increased nearly five-fold in the past century due in part to the discovery and proliferation of hybrid corn varieties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://passel.unl.edu/pages/informationmodule.php?idinformationmodule=1075412493&amp;topicorder=10&amp;maxto=12|title=Plant and Soil Sciences eLibrary|website=passel.unl.edu|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plant genetics can be used to predict which combination of plants may produce a plant with [[Hybrid vigor]], or conversely many discoveries in Plant genetics have come from studying the effects of hybridization.

Plants are generally more capable of surviving, and indeed flourishing, as [[polyploid]]s. Polyploid organisms have more than two sets of homologous chromosomes. For example, humans have two sets of homologous chromosomes, meaning that a typical human will have 2 copies each of 23 different chromosomes, for a total of 46. [[Wheat]] on the other hand, while having only 7 distinct chromosomes, is considered a hexaploid and has 6 copies of each chromosome, for a total of 42.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://coloradowheat.org/2013/11/why-is-the-wheat-genome-so-complicated/|title=Why is the Wheat Genome So Complicated? {{!}} Colorado Wheat|website=coloradowheat.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In animals, inheritable germline polyploidy is less common, and spontaneous chromosome increases may not even survive past fertilization. In plants however this is no such problem, polyploid individuals are created frequently by a variety of processes, however once created usually cannot cross back to the parental type. Polyploid individuals, if capable of self-fertilizing, can give rise to a new genetically distinct lineage, which can be the start of a new species. This is often called "instant [[speciation]]". Polyploids generally have larger fruit, an economically desirable trait, and many human food crops, including wheat, [[maize]], [[potatoes]], [[peanut]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2012-01-01|title=Expression of an Arabidopsis sodium/proton antiporter gene (AtNHX1) in peanut to improve salt tolerance - Springer|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11816-011-0200-5|journal=Plant Biotechnology Reports|publisher=Link.springer.com|volume=6|pages=59–67|doi=10.1007/s11816-011-0200-5|accessdate=2014-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[strawberries]] and [[tobacco]], are either accidentally or deliberately created polyploids.

====''Arabidopsis thaliana''====

[[Arabidopsis thaliana|''Arabidopsis thaliana'']], also known as thale cress, has been the model organism for the study of plant genetics. As [[Drosophila melanogaster|Drosphila]], a species of fruit fly, was to the understanding of early genetics, so has been arabidopsis to the understanding of plant genetics. It was the first plant to ever have its genome sequenced in the year 2000. It has a small genome, making the initial sequencing more attainable. It has a genome size of 125 [[Base pair|Mbp]] that encodes about 25,000 genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2000-12|title=Analysis of the genome sequence of the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/35048692|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=408|issue=6814|pages=796–815|doi=10.1038/35048692|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because an incredible amount of research has been done on the plant, a database called [[The Arabidopsis Information Resource]] (TAIR) has been established as a repository for multiple data sets and information on the species. Information housed in TAIR include the complete genome sequence along with [[gene structure]], gene product information, [[gene expression]], DNA and seed stocks, genome maps, genetic and physical [[Genetic marker|markers]], publications, and information about the Arabidopsis research community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.arabidopsis.org/|title=TAIR - Home Page|website=www.arabidopsis.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several [[Ecotype|ecotypes]] of arabidopsis that have been useful in genetic research, and the natural variation has been used to identify [[Quantitative trait locus|loci]] important in both [[Biotic stress|biotic]] and [[abiotic stress]] resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2000-01-01|title=Naturally occurring variation in Arabidopsis: an underexploited resource for plant genetics|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1360138599015101|journal=Trends in Plant Science|language=en|volume=5|issue=1|pages=22–29|doi=10.1016/S1360-1385(99)01510-1|issn=1360-1385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Brachypodium distachyon'' ====
''[[Brachypodium distachyon]]'' is an experimental model grass that has many attributes that make it an excellent model for temperate cereals. Unlike wheat, a tetra or [[hexaploid]] species, brachypodium is diploid with a relatively small genome (~355 Mbp) with a short life-cycle, making genomic studies on it simpler. ''([[Agronomy]], [[Molecular biology]], [[Genetics]]''

==== ''Nicotiana benthamiana'' ====
''[[Nicotiana benthamiana]]'' is often considered a model organism for both plant-pathogen and transgenic studies. Because it is easily transformed with ''[[Agrobacterium tumefaciens]]'', it is used to study both the [[Gene expression|expression]] of pathogen genes introduced into a plant or test new genetic [[Gene cassette|cassette]] effects. 

==Genetically modified crops==
{{main article|Genetically modified food}}

Genetically modified (GM) foods are produced from [[organism]]s that have had changes introduced into their [[DNA]] using the methods of [[genetic engineering]]. Genetic engineering techniques allow for the introduction of new traits as well as greater control over traits than previous methods such as [[selective breeding]] and [[mutation breeding]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bis.gov.uk/files/file15655.pdf GM Science Review First Report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016100707/http://www.bis.gov.uk/files/file15655.pdf |date=October 16, 2013 }}, Prepared by the UK GM Science Review panel (July 2003).

==Modern ways to genetically modify plants==

Genetic modification has been the cause for much research into modern plant genetics, and has also lead to the [[DNA sequencing|sequencing]] of many plant genomes. Today there are two predominant procedures of [[transformation (genetics)|transforming]] genes in organisms: the "[[Gene gun]]" method and the ''[[Agrobacterium]]'' method.

==="Gene gun" method===

The [[gene gun]] method is also referred to as "biolistics" ([[ballistics]] using biological components). This technique is used for [[in vivo]] (within a living organism) transformation and has been especially useful in [[monocotyledon|monocot]] species like [[maize|corn]] and rice.This approach literally shoots genes into plant cells and plant cell chloroplasts. DNA is coated onto small particles of gold or [[tungsten]] approximately two micrometres in diameter. The particles are placed in a vacuum chamber and the plant tissue to be engineered is placed below the chamber. The particles are propelled at high velocity using a short pulse of high pressure helium gas, and hit a fine mesh baffle placed above the tissue while the DNA coating continues into any target cell or [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]].

===''Agrobacterium'' method===
Transformation via [[Agrobacterium]] has been successfully practiced in [[dicotyledon|dicots]], i.e. broadleaf plants, such as [[soybean]]s and [[tomato]]es, for many years. Recently it has been adapted and is now effective in monocots like grasses, including corn and rice. In general, the ''Agrobacterium'' method is considered preferable to the gene gun, because of a greater [[frequency]] of single-site insertions of the foreign DNA, which allows for easier monitoring. In this method, the [[tumor]] inducing (Ti) region is removed from the T-DNA (transfer DNA) and replaced with the desired gene and a marker, which is then inserted into the organism. This may involve direct inoculation of the tissue with a culture of transformed Agrobacterium, or inoculation following treatment with micro-projectile bombardment, which wounds the tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bidney|first1=D|last2=Scelonge|first2=C|last3=Martich|first3=J|last4=Burrus|first4=M|last5=Sims|first5=L|last6=Huffman|first6=G|date=January 1992|title=Microprojectile bombardment of plant tissues increases transformation frequency by Agrobacterium tumefaciens|journal=Plant Mol. Biol.|volume=18|issue=2|pages=301–13|doi=10.1007/bf00034957|pmid=1310058}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wounding of the target tissue causes the release of phenolic compounds by the plant, which induces invasion of the tissue by Agrobacterium. Because of this, microprojectile bombardment often increases the efficiency of infection with Agrobacterium.  The marker is used to find the organism which has successfully taken up the desired gene. Tissues of the organism are then transferred to a medium containing an [[antibiotic]] or [[herbicide]], depending on which marker was used. The ''[[Agrobacterium]]'' present is also killed by the antibiotic. Only tissues expressing the marker will survive and possess the gene of interest. Thus, subsequent steps in the process will only use these surviving plants. In order to obtain whole plants from these tissues, they are grown under controlled environmental conditions in [[plant tissue culture|tissue culture]]. This is a process of a series of media, each containing nutrients and [[hormones]]. Once the plants are grown and produce seed, the process of evaluating the [[Offspring|progeny]] begins. This process entails selection of the seeds with the desired traits and then retesting and growing to make sure that the entire process has been completed successfully with the desired results.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2218">'''Polymorphous perversity''' is a [[psychoanalytic]] concept proposing the ability to gain [[sexual gratification]] outside [[social norm|socially normative]] sexual behaviors. [[Sigmund Freud]] used this term to describe the sexual disposition from infancy to about age five.

==Freud's theory==

Freud theorized that some are born with unfocused pleasure / [[libido|libidinal]] drives, deriving pleasure from any part of the body. The objects and modes of pleasurable satisfaction are multifarious, directed at every object that might provide pleasure. Polymorphous perverse sexuality continues from infancy through about age five, progressing through three distinct developmental stages: the [[oral stage]], [[anal stage]], and [[Genital stage|genital / phallic stage]]. Only in subsequent developmental stages do children learn to constrain drives towards pleasure-satisfaction to socially accepted norms, culminating in adult [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] behavior focused on the genitals and reproduction or sublimations of the procreative drive.

Freud taught that during this stage of undifferentiated impulse for pleasure, [[incest]]uous and [[bisexuality|bisexual]] urges are normal. Lacking knowledge that certain modes of gratification are forbidden, the polymorphously perverse child seeks gratification wherever it occurs. In the earliest phase, the oral phase, the child forms a libidinal bond with the mother via the inherent pleasure gained from [[breastfeeding|suckling at the breast]].

For Freud, "perversion" is a non-judgmental term. He used it to designate behavior outside the socially acceptable norms of his era.

In [[energy conservation|conservation]] and [[energy economics]], the '''rebound effect''' (or '''take-back effect''') is the reduction in expected gains from new technologies that increase the efficiency of [[natural resource|resource]] use, because of behavioral or other systemic responses. These responses usually tend to offset the beneficial effects of the new technology or other measures taken.

While the literature on the rebound effect generally focuses on the effect of technological improvements on energy consumption, the theory can also be applied to the use of any [[natural resource]] or other input, such as [[Labor (economics)|labor]]. The rebound effect is generally expressed as a ratio of the lost benefit compared to the expected environmental benefit when holding consumption constant.&lt;ref name=Grubb&gt;{{cite journal | surname=Grubb| given=M.J.| title=Energy efficiency and economic fallacies| journal=Energy Policy |volume=18 | year=1990 | pages=783–785 | doi=10.1016/0301-4215(90)90031-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, if a 5% improvement in vehicle [[fuel efficiency]] results in only a 2% drop in fuel use, there is a 60% rebound effect (since {{frac|(5-2)|5}} = 60%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Wang|first = Zhaohua|last2 = Han|first2 = Bai|last3 = Lu|first3 = Milin|date = 2016|title = Measurement of energy rebound effect in households: Evidence from residential electricity consumption in Beijing, China|url = |journal = Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|volume = 58|pages = 852–861|doi = 10.1016/j.rser.2015.12.179}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 'missing' 3% might have been consumed by driving faster or further than before.

The existence of the rebound effect is uncontroversial. However, debate continues as to the magnitude and impact of the effect in real world situations.&lt;ref name=Sorrell&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/asset/3B43125E-EEBD-4AB3-B06EA914C30F7B3E/| title = The rebound effect: An assessment of the evidence for economy-wide energy savings from improved energy efficiency| author = Steven Sorrell | year = 2007 | publisher= UK Energy Research Centre| accessdate=2008-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Depending on the magnitude of the rebound effect, there are five different rebound effect (RE) types:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Saunders|first = Harry D.|date = 2008|title = Fuel conserving (and using) production functions|url = |journal = Energy Economics|volume = 30|issue = 5|pages = 2184–2235|doi = 10.1016/j.eneco.2007.11.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Super conservation (RE &lt; 0): the actual resource savings are higher than expected savings – the rebound effect is negative. This occurs if the increase in efficiency reduces costs.
#Zero rebound (RE = 0): The actual resource savings are equal to expected savings – the rebound effect is zero.
#Partial rebound (0 &lt; RE &lt; 1): The actual resource savings are less than expected savings – the rebound effect is between 0% and 100%. This is sometimes known as 'take-back', and is the most common result of empirical studies on individual markets.
#Full rebound (RE = 1): The actual resource savings are equal to the increase in usage – the rebound effect is at 100%.
#Backfire (RE &gt; 1): The actual resource savings are negative because usage increased beyond potential savings – the rebound effect is higher than 100%. This situation is commonly known as the [[Jevons paradox]].

In order to avoid the rebound effect, [[environmental economics|environmental economists]] have suggested that any cost savings from efficiency gains be taxed in order to keep the cost of use the same.&lt;ref name=Wackernagel/&gt;

==History==
{{See also|Jevons paradox|Khazzoom-Brookes postulate}}

The rebound effect was first described by [[William Stanley Jevons]] in his 1865 book ''[[The Coal Question]]'', where he observed that the invention in Britain of a more efficient steam engine meant that the use of coal became economically viable for many new uses. This ultimately led to increased coal demand and much increased coal consumption, even as the amount of coal required for any particular use fell. According to Jevons, "It is a confusion of ideas to suppose that the economical use of fuel is equivalent to diminished consumption. The very contrary is the truth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jevons |first=William Stanley |title=The Coal Question |publisher=Macmillan and Co. |location=London |year=1866 |edition=2nd |at=Chapter VII |url=http://www.econlib.org/library/YPDBooks/Jevons/jvnCQ0.html |accessdate=2008-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, most contemporary authors credit Daniel Khazzoom for the re-emergence of the rebound effect in the research literature. Although Khazzoom did not use the term, he raised the idea that there is a less than one-to-one correlation between gains in [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] and reductions in energy use, because of a change in the 'price content' of energy in the provision of the final consumer product.&lt;ref name=Khazzoom&gt;{{cite journal | surname=Khazzoom| given=Daniel J.| title=Economic implications for mandated efficiency in standards for household appliances.| journal= The Energy Journal |volume=1 |issue=4 |year=1980 | pages=21–40 | doi=10.5547/issn0195-6574-ej-vol1-no4-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; His study was based on energy efficiency gains in home appliances, but the principle applies throughout the economy. A commonly studied example is that of a more fuel-efficient car. As each kilometre of travel becomes cheaper, there will be an increase in driving speed and/or kilometres driven, as long as the [[price elasticity of demand]] for car travel is not zero. Other examples might include the growth in [[garden lighting]] after the introduction of energy-saving [[Light Emitting Diode]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kyba|first1=Christopher C. M.|last2=Kuester|first2=Theres|last3=Sánchez de Miguel|first3=Alejandro|last4=Baugh|first4=Kimberly|last5=Jechow|first5=Andreas|last6=Hölker|first6=Franz|last7=Bennie|first7=Jonathan|last8=Elvidge|first8=Christopher D.|last9=Gaston|first9=Kevin J.|last10=Guanter|first10=Luis|title=Artificially lit surface of Earth at night increasing in radiance and extent|journal=Science Advances|date=22 November 2017|volume=3|issue=11|pages=e1701528|doi=10.1126/sciadv.1701528|url=http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/11/e1701528 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180101195115/http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/11/e1701528 |archivedate=2018-01-01 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the increasing size of houses driven partly by higher fuel efficiency in home heating technologies. If the rebound effect is larger than 100%, all gains from the increased fuel efficiency would be wiped out by increases in demand (the [[Jevons paradox]]).

Khazzoom's thesis was criticized heavily by Michael Grubb&lt;ref name=Grubb/&gt; and [[Amory Lovins]]&lt;ref name=Lovins&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lovins|first1=Amory B.|title=Energy Saving Resulting from the Adoption of More Efficient Appliances: Another View|journal=The Energy Journal|date=1988|volume=9|issue=2|doi=10.5547/issn0195-6574-ej-vol9-no2-10|JSTOR=41970456}} And: {{cite journal|last1=Henly|first1=John|last2=Ruderman|first2=Henry|last3=Levine|first3=Mark D.|title=Energy Saving Resulting from the Adoption of More Efficient Appliances: A Follow-up|journal=The Energy Journal|date=1988|volume=9|issue=2|pages=163–170|JSTOR=41970457}}&lt;/ref&gt; who dismissed any disconnection between energy efficiency improvements in an individual market, and an economy-wide reduction in energy consumption. Developing Khazzoom's idea further, and prompting heated debate in the Energy Policy journal at that time, Len Brookes wrote of the fallacies in the energy-efficiency solution to greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref name=Brookes&gt;{{cite journal | surname=Brookes| given=L.| title=The greenhouse effect: the fallacies in the energy efficient solution| journal=Energy Policy |volume=18 | year=1990 | pages=199–201 | doi=10.1016/0301-4215(90)90145-t}}&lt;/ref&gt; His analysis showed that any economically justified improvements in energy efficiency would in fact stimulate economic growth and increase total energy use. For improvements in energy efficiency to contribute to a reduction in economy-wide energy consumption, the improvement must come at a greater economic cost. Commenting in regard to energy efficiency advocates, he concludes that, "the present high profile of the topic seems to owe more to the current tide of green fervor than to sober consideration of the facts, and the validity and cost of solutions."&lt;ref name=Brookes/&gt;

===Khazzoom-Brookes postulate===
In 1992, economist Harry Saunders coined the term "[[Khazzoom-Brookes postulate]]" to describe the idea that energy efficiency gains paradoxically result in increases in energy use (the modern day equivalent of the [[Jevons paradox]]). He modeled energy efficiency gains using a variety of neo-classical growth models, and showed that the postulate is true over a wide range of assumptions. In the conclusion of his paper, Saunders stated that:&lt;ref name=Saunders&gt;{{cite journal | surname=Saunders| given=Harry| title=The Khazzom-Brookes Postulate and Neoclassical Growth| journal=Energy Journal |volume=13 | year=1992 | pages=131–148 | doi=10.5547/issn0195-6574-ej-vol13-no4-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|In the absence of efficiency gains, energy use will grow in lock step with economic growth (energy intensity will stay fixed) when energy prices are fixed. … Energy efficiency gains can increase energy consumption by two means: by making energy appear effectively cheaper than other inputs; and by increasing economic growth, which pulls up energy use. … These results, while by no means proving the Khazzoom-Brookes postulate, call for prudent energy analysts and policy makers to pause a long moment before dismissing it.}}

This work provided a theoretical grounding for empirical studies and played an important role in framing the problem of the rebound effect. It also reinforced an emerging ideological divide between energy economists on the extent of the yet to be named effect.  The two tightly held positions are:
*Technological improvements in energy efficiency enable economic growth that was otherwise impossible without the improvement; as such, energy efficiency improvements will usually back-fire in the long term.
*Technological improvements in energy efficiency may result in a small take-back. However, even in the long term, energy efficiency improvements usually result in large overall energy savings.

Even though many studies have been undertaken in this area, neither position has yet claimed a consensus view in the academic literature. Recent studies have demonstrated that direct rebound effects are significant (about 30% for energy), but that there is not enough information about indirect effects to know whether or how often back-fire occurs. Economists tend to the first position, but most governments, businesses, and environmental groups adhere to the second. Governments and environmental groups often advocate further research into fuel efficiency and radical increases in the efficient use of energy as the primary means for reducing energy use and reducing [[greenhouse gas]] emissions (to alleviate the impacts of [[climate change]]). However, if the first position more accurately reflects economic reality, current efforts to invent fuel-efficient technologies may not much reduce energy use, and may in fact paradoxically increase [[oil]] and [[coal]] consumption, and [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, over the long run.&lt;ref name=Sorrell/&gt;&lt;ref name=Herring&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Herring|first=Horace|last2=Roy|first2=Robin|date=2007|title=Technological innovation, energy efficient design and the rebound effect|url=|journal=Technovation|volume=27|issue=4|pages=194–203|doi=10.1016/j.technovation.2006.11.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of effects==
The full rebound effect can be distinguished into three different economic reactions to technological changes:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Sorrell|first = Steve|last2 = Dimitropoulos|first2 = John|date = 2008|title = The rebound effect: Microeconomic definitions, limitations and extensions|url = |journal = Ecological Economics|volume = 65|issue = 3|pages = 636–649|doi = 10.1016/j.ecolecon.2007.08.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Direct rebound effect: An increase in consumption of a good is caused by the lower cost of use. This is caused by the [[substitution effect]].
# Indirect rebound effect: The lower cost of a service enables increased household consumption of other goods and services. For example, the savings from a more efficient cooling system may be put into another luxury good. This is caused by the [[income effect]].
# Economy wide effect: The fall in service cost reduces the price of other goods, creates new production possibilities and increases economic growth.
In the example of improved vehicle fuel efficiency, the direct effect would be the increased fuel use from more driving as driving becomes cheaper. The indirect effect would incorporate the increased consumption of other goods enabled by household cost savings from increased fuel efficiency. Since consumption of other goods increases, the embodied fuel used in the production of those goods would increase as well. Finally, the economy-wide effect would include the long-term effect of the increase in vehicle fuel efficiency on production and consumption possibilities throughout the economy, including any effects on economic growth rates.

===Direct and indirect effects===
[[Image:Efficiencyreboundgraph.png|thumb|right|400px|Direct and Indirect Effects]]

For cost reducing resource efficiency, distinguishing between direct and indirect effects is shown in Figure 1 below.  The horizontal axis shows units of consumption of the targets good (which could be for example clothes washing, and measured in terms of kilograms of clean clothes) with consumption of all other goods and services on the vertical axis.  An economical technology change that enables each unit of washing to be produced with less electricity results in a reduction of the price per unit of washing.  This shifts the household budget line rightwards.  The result is a substitution effect because of the decreased relative price, but also an income effect due to the increased real income.  The substitution effect increases consumption of washing from Q1 to QS, and the income effect from QS to Q2.  The total increase in consumption of washing from Q1 to Q2 and the resulting increase in electricity consumption is the direct effect.  The indirect effect comprises the increase in other consumption, from O1 to O2.  The scale of each of these effects depends on the elasticity of demand for each of the goods, and the embodied resource or externality associated with each good. Indirect effects are difficult to measure empirically.&lt;ref name=Herring/&gt; In the manufacturing sector, it has been estimated that there is about a 24% rebound effect due to increases in fuel efficiency.&lt;ref name=Herring/&gt; A parallel effect will happen for cost saving efficient technologies for producers, where output and substitution effects will occur.

The rebound effect can increase the difficulty of projecting the reduction in greenhouse emissions from an improvement in energy efficiency.&lt;ref name=RS20981/&gt; Estimation of the scale of direct effects on residential electricity, heating and motor fuel consumption has been common motivation for research of rebound effects.&lt;ref name=Sorrell/&gt; Evaluation and econometric methods are the two approaches generally employed in estimating the size of this effect.  Evaluation methods rely on quasi-experimental studies and measure the before and after changes to energy consumption from the implementation of energy efficient technology, while econometric methods utilize [[Elasticity (economics)|elasticity estimates]] to forecast the likely effects from changes in the effective price of energy services.

Research has found that in [[developed countries]], the direct rebound effect is usually small to moderate, ranging from roughly 5% to 40% in residential space heating and cooling.&lt;ref name=RS20981&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/energy/eng-80.cfm | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071228115335/http://www.ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/energy/eng-80.cfm | archivedate = 2007-12-28 |last1=Gottron|first1=Frank | title = Energy Efficiency and the Rebound Effect: Does Increasing Efficiency Decrease Demand? | date=2001|publisher=[[Congressional Research Service reports]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Greening&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greening|first1=Lorna A. |last2=Greene|first2=David L.|last3=Difiglio|first3=Carmen|title=Energy efficiency and consumption — the rebound effect — a survey|journal=Energy Policy|date=2000|volume=28|issue=6-7|pages=389–401|doi=10.1016/S0301-4215(00)00021-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://repositories.cdlib.org/ucei/policy/EPE-014 | title = The Effect of Improved Fuel Economy on Vehicle Miles Traveled: Estimating the Rebound Effect Using U.S. State Data, 1966-2001 | first1 = Kenneth A. |last1=Small | first2=Kurt |last2= Van Dender | date = 21 September 2005 | publisher= University of California Energy Institute: Policy &amp; Economics | accessdate=2007-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Freire-González | first1 = J | year = 2010 | title = Empirical evidence of direct rebound effect in Catalonia | url = | journal = Energy Policy | volume = 38 | issue = 5| pages = 2309–2314 | doi = 10.1016/j.enpol.2009.12.018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the direct rebound effect can be attributed to consumers who were previously unable to use a service.&lt;ref name=Dimitropoulos&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sorrell|first=Steve|last2=Dimitropoulos|first2=John|last3=Sommerville|first3=Matt|date=2009|title=Empirical estimates of the direct rebound effect: A review|url=|journal=Energy Policy|volume=37|issue=4|pages=1356–1371|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2008.11.026}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the rebound effect may be more significant in the context of the undeveloped markets in [[developing economies]].&lt;ref name=Roy2000&gt;{{cite journal | surname=Roy| given=Joyashree| title=The rebound effect: some empirical evidence from India| journal=Energy Policy |volume=28 | year=2000 | pages=433–438 |doi=10.1016/S0301-4215(00)00027-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Antal&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Antal|first1=Miklós|last2=van den Bergh|first2=Jeroen C.J.M.|title=Re-spending rebound: A macro-level assessment for OECD countries and emerging economies|journal=Energy Policy|date=2014|volume=68|pages=585–590|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2013.11.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indirect effects from conservation ===
[[Image:Conservationreboundgraph.png|thumb|400px| Figure2: change in preferences of a household revealing indirect effects from conservation]]

For conservation measures, indirect effects closely approximate the total economy-wide effect.  Conservation measures constitute a change in consumption patterns away from particular targeted goods towards other goods. Figure 2 shows that a change in preference of a household results in a new consumption pattern that has less of the target good (QT to QT`), and more of all other goods (QO to QO`).  The [[resource consumption]] or externalities embodied in this other consumption is the indirect effect.

Although a persuasive view has prevailed that indirect effects with respect to energy and greenhouse emissions should be very small due to energy directly comprising only a small component of household expenditure, this view is gradually being eroded.&lt;ref name=Lovins/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schipper&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schipper|first1=Lee|last2=Grubb|first2=Michael|title=On the rebound? Feedback between energy intensities and energy uses in IEA countries|journal=Energy Policy|date=2000|volume=28|issue=6-7|pages=367–388|doi=10.1016/s0301-4215(00)00018-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many recent studies based on life-cycle analysis show the energy consumed indirectly by households is often higher than consumed directly through electricity, gas, and motor fuel, and is a growing proportion.&lt;ref name=Vringer&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vringer|first1=Kees|last2=Blok|first2=Kornelis|title=Long-term trends in direct and indirect household energy intensities: a factor in dematerialisation?|journal=Energy Policy|date=2000|volume=28|issue=10|pages=713–727|doi=10.1016/s0301-4215(00)00050-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vringer|first1=Kees|last2=Aalbers|first2=Theo|last3=Blok|first3=Kornelis|title=Household energy requirement and value patterns|journal=Energy Policy|date=2007|volume=35|issue=1|pages=553–566|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2005.12.025}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lenzen&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lenzen|first1=Manfred|last2=Dey|first2=Christopher J.|title=Economic, energy and greenhouse emissions impacts of some consumer choice, technology and government outlay options|journal=Energy Economics|date=2002|volume=24|issue=4|pages=377–403|doi=10.1016/s0140-9883(02)00007-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is evident in the results of recent studies that indicate indirect effects from household conservation can range from 10% to 200% depending on the scenario, with higher indirect rebounds from diet changes aiming to reduce [[food miles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | surname=Alfredsson| given=E.| title="Green" consumption--no solution for climate change| journal=Energy |volume=29 | year=2004 | pages=513–524 | doi=10.1016/j.energy.2003.10.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economy wide effects===
{{See also | Steady-state economy #Resource decoupling and the rebound effect }}
Even if the direct and indirect rebound effects add up to less than 100%, technological improvements that increase efficiency may still result in economy-wide effects that results in increased resource use for the economy as a whole. In particular, this would happen if increased resource efficiency enables an expansion of production in the economy, and an increase in the rate of [[economic growth]]. For example, for the case of energy use, more efficient technology is equivalent to a lower price for energy resources. It is well known that changes in energy costs have a large impact on economic growth rates. In the 1970s, sharp increases in petroleum prices led to [[stagflation]] ([[recession]] and [[inflation]]) in the developed countries, whereas in the 1990s lower petroleum prices contributed to higher economic growth. An improvement in energy efficiency has the same effect as lower fuel prices, and leads to faster economic growth. Economists generally believe that especially for the case of energy use, more efficient technologies will lead to increased use, because of this growth effect.

To model the scale of this effect, economists use computational general equilibrium (CGE) models.  While CGE methodology is by no means perfect, results indicate that economy-wide rebound effects are likely to be very high, with estimates above 100% being rather common.&lt;ref name=Sorrell/&gt; One simple CGE model has been made available online for use by economists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Saunders|first1=Harry D|title=A Calculator for Energy Consumption Changes Arising from New Technologies|journal=The B.E. Journal of Economic Analysis &amp; Policy|date=2005|volume=5|issue=1|doi=10.1515/1538-0653.1467}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Income level variation===

Research has shown that the direct rebound effects for energy services is lower at high income levels, due to less price sensitivity. Studies have found that own-price elasticity of gas consumption by UK households was two times greater for households in the lowest income decile when compared to the highest decile. Studies have also observed higher rebounds in low-income houses for improvements in heating technology.&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baker|first1=Paul|last2=Blundell|first2=Richard|last3=Micklewright|first3=John|title=Modelling Household Energy Expenditures Using Micro-Data|journal=The Economic Journal|date=1989|volume=99|issue=397|page=720|doi=10.2307/2233767}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Milne&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Milne|first1=Geoffrey|last2=Boardman|first2=Brenda|title=Making cold homes warmer: the effect of energy efficiency improvements in low-income homes. A report to the Energy Action Grants Agency Charitable Trust|journal=Energy Policy|date=2000|volume=28|issue=6-7|pages=411–424|doi=10.1016/s0301-4215(00)00019-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evaluation methods have also been used to assess the scale of rebound effects from efficient heating installations in lower income homes in the United Kingdom. This research found that direct effects are close to 100% in many cases.&lt;ref name=Hong&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hong|first1=Sung H.|last2=Oreszczyn|first2=Tadj|last3=Ridley|first3=Ian|title=The impact of energy efficient refurbishment on the space heating fuel consumption in English dwellings|journal=Energy and Buildings|date=2006|volume=38|issue=10|pages=1171–1181|doi=10.1016/j.enbuild.2006.01.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; High income households in developed countries are likely to set the temperature at the optimum comfort level, regardless of the cost – therefore any cost reduction does not result in increased heating, for it was already optimal. But low-income households are more price sensitive, and have made thermal sacrifices due to the cost of heating.&lt;ref name=Dimitropoulos/&gt; In this case, a high direct rebound is likely. This analogy can be extended to most household energy consumption.

The size of the rebound effect is likely to be higher in developing countries according to macro-level assessments &lt;ref name=Antal/&gt; and case studies. One case study was undertaken in rural India to evaluate the impact of an alternative energy scheme.&lt;ref name=Roy2000/&gt; Households were given solar powered lighting in an attempt to reduce the use of kerosene for lighting to zero except for seasons with insufficient sunshine.  The scheme was also designed to encourage a future willingness to pay for efficient lighting.  The results were surprising, with high direct rebounds between 50 and 80%, and total direct and indirect rebound above 100%.  Because the new lighting source was essentially zero cost, operating hours for lighting went up from an average of 2 to 6 per day, with new lighting consisting of a combination of both the no-cost solar lamps and also kerosene lamps.  Also, more cooking was undertaken which enabled an increased trade of food with neighboring villages.

===Rebounds with respect to time===

The individual opportunity of cost is an often overlooked cause of the rebound effect. Just as improved workplace tools result in an increased expectation of productivity, so does the increased availability of time result in an increase in demand for a service.&lt;ref name=Herring/&gt;&lt;ref name=Binswanger&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Binswanger|first1=Mathias|title=Technological progress and sustainable development: what about the rebound effect?|journal=Ecological Economics|date=2001|volume=36|issue=1|pages=119–132|doi=10.1016/S0921-8009(00)00214-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jalas&gt;{{cite journal | surname=Jalas| given=Mikko| title=A time use perspective on the materials intensity of consumption | journal=Ecological Economics|volume=41 | year=2002 | pages=101–123 | doi =10.1016/s0921-8009(02)00018-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research articles often examine increasingly convenient and more rapid modes of transportation to determine the rebound effect in energy demand. Because time cost forms a major part of the total cost of commuter transport, rapid modes will reduce real costs, but will also encourage longer commuting distances which will in turn increase energy consumption.&lt;ref name=Sorrell/&gt;&lt;ref name=Binswanger/&gt; While important, it is almost impossible to estimate empirically the scale of such effects due to the subjective nature of the value of time. Time saved can either be used towards additional work or leisure which may have differing degrees of rebound effect.  Labor time saved at work due to the increased labour productivity is likely to be spent on further labor time at higher productive rates.  For leisure time saving, this may simply encourage people to diversify their leisure interests to fill their generally fixed period of leisure time.

==Suggested solutions==
In order to ensure that efficiency enhancing technological improvements actually reduce fuel use, the [[ecological economics|ecological economists]] [[Mathis Wackernagel]] and [[William E. Rees (academic)|William Rees]] have suggested that any cost savings from efficiency gains be "taxed away or otherwise removed from further economic circulation. Preferably they should be captured for reinvestment in [[natural capital]] rehabilitation."&lt;ref name=Wackernagel&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wackernagel | first1 = Mathis | last2 = Rees | first2 = William  | year = 1997 | title = Perceptual and structural barriers to investing in natural capital: economics from an ecological footprint perspective | url = | journal = Ecological Economics | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 3–24 | doi=10.1016/S0921-8009(96)00077-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be achieved through, for example, the imposition of a [[ecotax|green tax]], a [[Emissions trading|cap and trade]] program, higher [[fuel tax]]es or the proposed "restore" approach where part of the savings is directed back to the resource.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bindewald|first1=Eckart|title=An R of sustainability that can tame the "conundrum"|journal=PeerJ PrePrints|date=2013|page=1:e46v1|doi=10.7287/peerj.preprints.46v1|url=https://peerj.com/preprints/46/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Policies can also directly address projected yearly consumption of energy rather than device efficiency, especially for systems where the use can be accurately projected, such as street lighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kyba|first1=C. C. M.|last2=Hänel|first2=A.|last3=Hölker|first3=F.|title=Redefining efficiency for outdoor lighting|journal=Energy &amp; Environmental Science|date=2014|volume=7|issue=6|page=1806|doi=10.1039/C4EE00566J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Regional Studies Association works with its international and interdisciplinary membership to facilitate the highest standards of theoretical development, empirical analysis and policy debate of issues at this sub-national scale, incorporating both the urban and rural and different conceptions of space such as city regions and interstitial spaces. We are, for example, interested in issues of economic development and growth, conceptions of territory and its governance and in thorny problems of equity and injustice.

[[File:RSA logo.jpg|thumb|Regional Studies Association logo]]

It runs a programme of international conferences and events based on excellence that has been growing steadily over the years and plays a major role in the Association’s aim in supporting its members disseminate their research. These events also create debates and offer opportunities for those who wish to be part of a community where high quality events are also the place to network within a friendly atmosphere, present their work to international audiences and strengthen their careers. In 2017, the RSA organised events in Ireland, Brazil, China, Romania, Belgium, Australia, UK &amp; Russia. The RSA was a key partner in the European Week of Regions and Cities and we were coordinating the #EURegionsWeek 2017 University sessions and EU Cohesion Policy Master Class. 

The association publishes 5 journals with the publisher [[Taylor and Francis]]: [[Regional Studies (journal) |''Regional Studies'']],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rsa.tandfonline.com/action/journalInformation?show=aimsScope&amp;journalCode=cres20|title=Regional Studies :|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Spatial Economic Analysis]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rsa.tandfonline.com/action/journalInformation?show=aimsScope&amp;journalCode=rsea20|title=Spatial Economic Analysis :|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Territory, Politics, Governance'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rsa.tandfonline.com/action/journalInformation?show=aimsScope&amp;journalCode=rtep20|title=Territory, Politics, Governance :|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[open access journal]] ''Regional Studies, Regional Science'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rsa.tandfonline.com/action/journalInformation?show=aimsScope&amp;journalCode=rsrs20|title=Regional Studies, Regional Science :|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Area Development and Policy'', that engages with the transformation of the modern world as a result of development of the global South/Greater [[BRICS]]. The ''Regions and Cities'' Book Series&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tandfbuiltenvironment.com/books/series/Regions_and_Cities|title=Built Environment - Routledge|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is published by [[Routledge]] in association with the RSA. The Book Series Editor-in-Chief is Joan Fitzgerald (Northeastern University, USA). ''Regions'' magazine is the membership magazine and the voice of the RSA membership.

It has allocated financial resources to support its members and offer a range of funding opportunities to suit different career stages. These opportunities provide members with the chance to apply for financial help to support their research, run networking events, receive awards for excellence and help towards the costs of travel to attend non-RSA events and present their work to international audiences. The RSA offers the following funding opportunities: '''Travel Grant''' up to £500&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regionalstudies.org/funding/page/rsa-travel-grant|title=RSA Travel Grant}}&lt;/ref&gt;, '''Policy Expo'''  up to £15,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regionalstudies.org/funding/page/policy-expo-grant-scheme|title=RSA Policy Expo Grant Scheme}}&lt;/ref&gt;, '''Membership Research Grant (MeRSA)''' up to £5,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regionalstudies.org/funding/page/rsa-MeRSA-Grant|title=RSA Membership Research Grant Scheme}}&lt;/ref&gt;, '''Fellowship Research Grant (FeRSA)''' up to £7,500&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regionalstudies.org/funding/page/rsa-fellowship-research-grant-scheme|title=RSA Fellowship Research Grant Scheme}}&lt;/ref&gt;, '''Early Career Research Grant''' up to £10,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regionalstudies.org/funding/page/early-career-grant-scheme|title=RSA Early Career Research Grant Scheme}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''Research Network Grant Scheme''' up to £10,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regionalstudies.org/funding/page/research-network-grants|title=RSA Research network grant}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The RSA's Research Networks are formed by RSA members to organise a series of events to examine an issue of collective interest. 

There is an extensive '''international network''' of around 70 Ambassadors, five Divisions (China, Latin America, Northern Europe, India and Russia), five country Sections (Hungary, Poland, Scotland, Ireland and Wales) and six UK regional Branches which support members in their own locales. We also have a non-profit Foundation in Belgium (RSA Europe). These international networks work together with the Association to expend the opportunities and benefits offered to its members but also to those who do not yet know the Association. These networks are set up to organise a range of activities that are open to all to attend and they have the role of informing and disseminating information on regional studies at a regional and/or national level. They also act as an invaluable link to the Association for those who work in a language other than English but also for those who cannot attend all the major events directly organised by the Association&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regionalstudies.org/networks|title=RSA International Networks}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The RSA's Chair is Professor Mark Tewdwr-Jones, Director of Newcastle City Futures and Chair of Town Planning, Newcastle University, UK. The RSA’s previous Chair (2012-2017) was Professor Andrew Beer, Dean, Research &amp; Innovation at UniSA Business School, Australia. He succeeded Professor [[David Bailey (academic economist and commentator)|David Bailey]] who served as Chair over 2006–12. Sally Hardy is Chief Executive for the past 30 years. The RSA President is Ron Martin, University of Cambridge, UK. The previous RSA President was [[Peter Hall (urbanist)|Sir Peter Hall]] until 2014.

[[Peter Hall (urbanist)|Sir Peter Hall]] was awarded the RSA's Prize for Outstanding Contribution to the field of Regional Studies at the RSA's Presidential Lunch held at the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in September 2008. In subsequent years the association has awarded an annual Sir Peter Hall Prize for outstanding contribution to the field of Regional Studies, with recipients including Ann Markusen, John Bachtler, John Goddard, [[Michael Storper]], [[Allen J. Scott]], Ray Hudson, Brian Robson, Susan Christopherson and [[Saskia Sassen]]  in 2017. The RSA also awards excellence in the field with its Best Book Award, Nathaniel Lichfield Award, RSA and Routledge Early Career Award, as well as its Best Paper and Best Referee Awards for all its academic journals (''Regional Studies; Spatial Economic Analysis; Territory, Politics, Governance; Regional Studies, Regional Science; Area Development and Policy'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regionalstudies.org/funding|title=RSA Awards}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The RSA is a member society of the Academy of Social Sciences, previously known as the [[Academy of Learned Societies in the Social Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acss.org.uk/about6.htm |title=Academy of Social Sciences |publisher=Acss.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The association is also a recognised United Nations NGO with Consultative Status (ECOSOC).

'''''Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches''''' is a book on human [[kinship]] and social behavior by Maximilian Holland, published in 2012. The work synthesizes the perspectives of [[evolutionary biology]], [[psychology]] and [[sociocultural anthropology]] towards understanding human social bonding and cooperative behavior. It presents a theoretical treatment that many consider to have resolved longstanding questions about the proper place of genetic (or 'blood') connections in human kinship and social relations, and a synthesis that ''"should inspire more nuanced ventures in applying Darwinian approaches to sociocultural anthropology"''.&lt;ref name="amazon.com"&gt;Philip Kitcher comment (book cover), |url=https://www.amazon.com/Social-Bonding-Nurture-Kinship-Compatibility/dp/1480182001&lt;/ref&gt; The book has been called ''"A landmark in the field of evolutionary biology"''&lt;ref name=AV2014&gt;{{cite web | first = Augusto | last = Vitale | title = Review of ''Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship'' | journal = Folia Primatologica | volume = 85 | year = 2014 | pages = 215 | url = http://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/365178}}&lt;/ref&gt; which ''"gets to the heart of the matter concerning the contentious relationship between kinship categories, genetic relatedness and the prediction of behavior"'',&lt;ref name=RF2012&gt;Robin Fox comment (book cover), |url=https://www.amazon.com/Social-Bonding-Nurture-Kinship-Compatibility/dp/1480182001&lt;/ref&gt; ''"places genetic determinism in the correct perspective"''&lt;ref name=AV2014 /&gt; and serves as ''"a shining example of what can be achieved when excellent scholars engage fully across disciplinary boundaries."''&lt;ref name=SS2015&gt;{{cite web | first = Stuart | last = Semple| title = Review of: Holland, M (2012) Social bonding and nurture kinship: compatibility between cultural and biological approaches. | journal = Acta Ethologica | volume = | year = | pages = | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10211-015-0225-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aim of the book is to show that ''"properly interpreted,  cultural anthropology approaches (and ethnographic data)  and biological approaches are perfectly compatible regarding processes of social bonding in humans."''&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Maximilian Holland 2012, Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, North Charleston. Pages 283-284&lt;/ref&gt; Holland's position is based on demonstrating that the dominant biological theory of social behavior ([[inclusive fitness]] theory) is typically misunderstood to predict that genetic ties are necessary for the ''expression'' of social behaviors, whereas in fact the theory only implicates genetic associations as necessary for the ''evolution'' of social behaviors. Whilst rigorous evolutionary biologists have long understood the distinction between these levels of analysis (see [[Tinbergen's four questions]]), past attempts to apply inclusive fitness theory to humans have often overlooked the distinction between ''evolution'' and ''expression''.&lt;ref&gt;Maximilian Holland 2012, Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, North Charleston. Chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond its central argument, the broader philosophical implications of Holland's work are considered by commentators to be that it both ''"helps to untangle a long-standing disciplinary muddle"''&lt;ref name="RF2012"/&gt; and ''"clarifies the relationship between biological and sociocultural approaches to human kinship."''&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Hrdy comment (book description), |url=https://www.amazon.com/Social-Bonding-Nurture-Kinship-Compatibility/dp/1480182001&lt;/ref&gt;  It is claimed that the book ''"demonstrates that an alternative non-deterministic interpretation of evolutionary biology is more compatible with actual human social behavior and with the frameworks that sociocultural anthropology employs"''&lt;ref&gt;Kirk Endicott comment (book description), |url=https://www.amazon.com/Social-Bonding-Nurture-Kinship-Compatibility/dp/1480182001&lt;/ref&gt; and as a consequence, delivers ''"a convincing, solid and informed blow to the residual genetic determinism that still influences the interpretation of social behaviour."''&lt;ref name=AV2014 /&gt;

==Synopsis==

The book's form consists of a cumulative argument (using a wide range of supporting evidence) made over nine chapters, with each chapter ending in a brief retrospective summary, and the final chapter containing a recapitulation and summary of the whole,&lt;ref&gt;This synopsis is based mainly on the book's chapter summaries and concluding chapter&lt;/ref&gt; and drawing some wider conclusions.

===Continuing debate over 'blood kinship'===
{{See also|Kinship}}

Holland begins by tracing transitions in the history of anthropological theories of social behavior and [[kinship]], noting the varying importance with which 'blood ties' have been understood to be a necessary element of human kinship and social relations. He suggests that whilst the mounting [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] evidence has led to a move away from the 'blood kinship' concept in recent decades, many sociocultural anthropologists still query the connection between kinship and blood, reproduction or some other apparently biological functions. Meanwhile, many biologists, [[Biological anthropology|biological anthropologists]] and [[Evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]] have persisted in viewing human kinship and cooperative behavior as necessarily associated with genetic relationships and 'blood ties'. The current situation has been characterized as "''a clash between incommensurate paradigms, holding as they may, completely incompatible ideas about human nature.''"&lt;ref&gt;Philip Thomas comment (book cover), |url=https://www.amazon.com/Social-Bonding-Nurture-Kinship-Compatibility/dp/1480182001&lt;/ref&gt; Holland argues that a clear resolution to these questions is still outstanding, and would therefore be of value. In closing the introduction, Holland writes; "The approach  is not reductive. The claim is rather that a thorough investigation of the ‘biological facts’ can be useful mainly though allowing a change in focus... away from confusion about the place of genealogy in social ties, and onto a reformulated baseline, built around varied ''processual aspects of social bonding.''"&lt;ref&gt;Maximilian Holland 2012, Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, North Charleston. Page 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary biology theory of social behavior===
{{See also|Inclusive fitness}}

The book reviews the background and key elements of [[W.D.Hamilton|Hamilton's]] [[inclusive fitness]] theory from the 1960s onwards, setting out its significant conceptual and heuristic value. Holland notes that Hamilton acknowledged that his earliest and most widely known account (1964)&lt;ref name="Hamilton, William D 1964"&gt;Hamilton, William D. 1964. The Genetical Evolution of Social Behaviour. Journal of Theoretical Biology 7:1-52. 1964&lt;/ref&gt; contained technical inaccuracies. He also notes Hamilton's early speculations about possible proximate mechanisms of the expression of social behavior (''supergenes''&lt;ref name="Hamilton, William D 1964"/&gt; as a possible alternative to ''behaviour-evoking-situations''&lt;ref name="Hamilton, William D 1964"/&gt;) contained errors that have nevertheless remained very influential in popular accounts. Specifically, the supergenes notion (sometimes called the ''[[Green-beard effect]]'') - that organisms may evolve genes that are able to identify identical copies in others and preferentially direct social behaviours towards them - was theoretically clarified and withdrawn by Hamilton in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, William D. 1987. Discriminating nepotism: expectable, common and overlooked. In Kin recognition in animals, edited by D. J. C. Fletcher and C. D. Michener. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the intervening years, the notion that supergenes (or more often, simply individual organisms) have evolved ''to identify genetic relatives and preferentially cooperate with them'' took hold, and became the way many biologists came to understand the theory. This persisted, despite Hamilton's 1987 correction. In Holland's view it is the pervasiveness of this longstanding but erroneous perspective, and the suppression of the alternative 'behaviour-evoking-situations' perspective regarding social expression mechanisms, that is largely responsible for the ongoing clash between biological and sociocultural approaches to human kinship.

===Sociobiology and kinship===

Holland shows that, in the 1970s and 80s, the first wave of attempts (known as ''human [[sociobiology]]'' or ''[[Darwinian anthropology]]'') to apply inclusive fitness theory to human social behavior relied on, and further reinforced, this same misinterpretation (above section) about the theory's predictions and the proximate mechanisms of social behavior. Holland also shows that this period of research was burdened with many misplaced assumptions about ''universal'' attributes of the human sexes, [[sexuality]] and [[gender]] roles, apparently projected from the ''specific cultural values'' of the researchers themselves. Holland also shows that, following the perceived failures of this early wave, and particularly its methodological agnosticism regarding proximate mechanisms of social behavior, the [[evolutionary psychology]] school grew up in its place. Although this latter school typically avoided engaging with the ethnographic data on human kinship, Holland argues that in the few cases where it did so, it repeated the misinterpretation of inclusive fitness theory that characterized the first wave. Holland also notes that [[Philip Kitcher|Kitcher]], in his&lt;ref&gt;Kitcher, Philip. 1985. Vaulting Ambition: Sociobiology and the Quest for Human Nature. MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; critique of the sociobiological position, suggested that perhaps the expression of social behaviors in humans might quite simply be based on cues of context and familiarity, rather than genetic relatedness ''per se''.

===Proximate mechanisms and 'kin recognition'===
{{See also| Kin recognition}}

Chapters four and five investigate further the theory and evidence surrounding the ''proximate mechanisms'' of social behavior; specifically the question of whether social behaviors are expressed by organisms via ''behaviour-evoking-situations'' or via direct detection of actual genetic relatedness. Related questions have been the domain of [[kin recognition]] theory. Holland notes that the name 'kin recognition' itself suggests some expectation that a positive identification of genetic relatedness is a prediction of inclusive fitness theory, and is thus expected. Similar points have been made by others; "many behavioural ecologists seem to implicitly assume that specialised mechanisms allowing individuals to distinguish their kin from non-kin must have evolved.&lt;ref&gt;Tang-Martinez, Z. 2001. The mechanisms of kin discrimination and the evolution of kin recognition in vertebrates: a critical re-evaluation. Behavioural Processes 53:21-40. Page 21)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grafen, A. 1990. Do animals really recognize kin? Animal Behaviour 39:42-54.&lt;/ref&gt;" Again, the possibility that ''behaviour-evoking-situations'' might be the more parsimonious&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, William D. 1987. Discriminating nepotism: expectable, common and overlooked. In Kin recognition in animals, edited by D. J. C. Fletcher and C. D. Michener. New York: Wiley. On page 420, Hamilton clearly states that ''"Altruistic or selfish acts are only possible when a suitable social object is available. In this sense behaviours are conditional from the start.''"&lt;/ref&gt; mechanism of the expression of social behavior, and fully compatible with inclusive fitness theory, has often been underemphasized. However, Holland's review of the evidence notes that field studies in this area quickly established that ''behaviour-evoking-situations'' do in fact overwhelmingly mediate social behaviours in those species studied, and that, particularly in mammal species, social bonding and familiarity formed in early developmental contexts (e.g. in burrows or nesting sites) are a common mediating mechanism for social behaviors, independently of genetic relatedness ''per se''. On the basis of the preceding theoretical analysis and review of evidence, at the end of chapter five, Holland argues that;
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is entirely erroneous, both in reference to theory and in reference to the evidence, to claim or suggest that 'the facts of biology' support the claim that organisms have evolved to cooperate with genetic relatives ''per se''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Maximilian Holland 2012, Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, North Charleston. Page 161.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Primate social bonding and attachment theory===
{{See also| Attachment theory}}

Having argued for the above position on the lack of necessity for genetic relatedness ''per se'' to mediate social bonding and behavior, Holland suggests that "The further question then is; can we uncover in any greater detail how familiarity and other context-dependent cues operate?"&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;. To discover the extent to which the variety of human kinship behaviors may nevertheless be compatible with this (less deterministic) interpretation of biological theory of social behavior, Holland suggests that a survey of [[primate|primates']] most fundamental social patterns may give clues, especially those of species most closely connected with humans. The variety of primate [[mating system]]s, group-membership ('[[philopatry]]') patterns, and life-cycle patterns are reviewed. Holland finds that;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Like other mammals, Catarrhini primate demographics are strongly influenced by ecological conditions, particularly density and distribution of food sources... Cohesive social groups and delayed natal dispersal mean that maternally related individuals, including maternal siblings, face a statistically reliable context of interaction in all Catarrhini primates. This reliable context of interaction with maternally related individuals is extended amongst those species with female philopatry (especially Cercopithecinae).&lt;ref&gt;Maximilian Holland 2012, Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, North Charleston. Page 279&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As with other social mammals, evidence suggest that the reliability of 'behaviour-evoking-situations' this social context provides has shaped the mechanisms of proximate expression of social bonding and behavior;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Adoption of infants by females (and sometimes males) demonstrates that care-giving and bonding to infants is not mediated by positive powers of discrimination. From the infant's perspective, it will bond with any responsive carer. If not necessarily the actual mother, in natural conditions this will often be a maternal relative (particularly an older sibling), but the context is primary, not the actual relatedness. Similarly, social bonding and social behaviours between maternal siblings (and occasionally between other maternal relatives) is context-driven in primates, and mediated via the care-giver.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Maximilian Holland 2012, Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, North Charleston. Page 280&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Holland also notes how [[John Bowlby|Bowlby]] and colleagues' [[attachment theory]] was strongly informed by primate bonding patterns and mechanisms, and that in Bowlby's later writing the then emerging [[inclusive fitness]] theory was explicitly linked to. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;[Bowlby's] work demonstrated that social attachments form on the basis of provision of care, and responsiveness to elicitations for care. The social context of living together and the familiarity this brings, provides the circumstance within which social bonds can form...&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the basis of combining more recent primate research with the findings of attachment theory, Holland proposes that "In attempting to define more specific forms of ''the giving of care and nurture'' which may mediate social bonding we [find] that provision of food is likely to play a part, as well as the more intangible provision of warmth and comfort, and a safe base for sleeping.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;"

===Processual and nurture kinship in humans===
{{See also|Nurture kinship}}

Holland claims that, while biological theory of social behavior is not [[determinism|deterministic]] in respect of genetic relatedness vis-a-vis the formation of social bonds and expression of social behaviors, evidence does point to compatibility between a [[reductionism|non-reductive]] interpretation of the theory and how such bonds and behaviors operate in social mammals, primates and in humans. In the final part of the book, Holland explores the extent to which this perspective is also compatible with sociocultural anthropology's ethnographic accounts of human kinship and social behavior, both occasional accounts from the past, as well as more contemporary accounts that have explicitly eschewed the earlier 'blood ties' assumption. Holland finds that;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Many contemporary accounts focus on social bonds formed in childhood and the importance of the performance of acts of care, including food provision, in mediating these bonds. In all cases it is this performance of care which is considered the overriding factor in
mediating social bonds, notwithstanding 'blood ties'. In short, there is strong compatibility between the perspectives on social bonding that emerge from a proper account of biological theory and those documented by ethnographers.&lt;ref&gt;Maximilian Holland 2012, Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, North Charleston. Page 282&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Conclusion===

Holland's concluding chapter gives a summary of his fundamental position;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A crucial implication of this argument taken as a whole is that ''the expression of the kinds of social behaviours treated by inclusive fitness theory does not require genetic relatedness.'' Sociobiology and evolutionary psychology's claims that biological science predicts that organisms ''will'' direct social behaviour towards relatives are thus both ''theoretically'' and ''empirically'' erroneous. Such claims and their supporting arguments also give a highly misleading and reductive account of basic biological theory. Properly interpreted, ''cultural anthropology approaches (and ethnographic data) and biological approaches are perfectly compatible'' regarding processes of social bonding in humans. Most of all, this requires a focus on the circumstances and processes which lead to social bonding.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The book notes that, as an outcome of the analysis, [[David M. Schneider|Schneider's]] sociocultural perspective on human kinship is vindicated;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Do the biological facts have some priority or are they but one of the conditions, like ecology, economy, demography, etc., to which kinship systems must adapt? Take note: if the latter is the case, then kinship must be as much rooted in these other conditions as in the biological facts.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, David M. 1984. A critique of the study of kinship. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press. Page 139&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The author supplies several examples of the insight that Schneider's broad approach can provide. The book closes with an example of a clash of cultural perspectives on kinship and family norms, and makes the suggestion that;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Constructing from narrow cultural particulars (Euro-American or otherwise) an essentialised model of 'human nature' does not constitute science; it is closer to cultural colonialism. In any analysis intended to shed light on proposed universals of the human condition, reflexivity is essential, and cultural and biological approaches both surely necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Maximilian Holland 2012, Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, North Charleston. Page 292&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reception and reviews==

===General===
Kinship theorist and member of the [[national academy of science]], [[Robin Fox]] wrote of the work:

&lt;blockquote&gt;An excellent and constructive discussion of matters in kinship and its cultural and biological components, handsomely reconciling what have been held to be incompatible positions.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Fox commentary, Fox's Website, http://robin-fox.com/books.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Max Holland gets to the heart of the matter concerning the contentious relationship between kinship categories, genetic relatedness and the prediction of behavior. If he had been in the debate in the 1980s then a lot of subsequent confusion could have been avoided"&lt;ref name="RF2012"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Irwin Bernstein, distinguished research professor in the university of Georgia's ''Behavioral and Brain Sciences Program'' made the following comment on Holland's book:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Max Holland has demonstrated extraordinarily thorough scholarship in his exhaustive review of the often contentious discussions of kinship.  He has produced a balanced synthesis melding the two approaches exemplified in the biological and sociocultural behavioral positions. His work in reconciling opposing views clearly demonstrates the value of interdisciplinary approaches.  This should be the definitive word on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin Bernstein comment (book cover), |url=https://www.amazon.com/Social-Bonding-Nurture-Kinship-Compatibility/dp/1480182001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Philip Kitcher]], John Dewey Professor of Philosophy, and James R. Barker Professorship of Contemporary Civilization at [[Columbia University]], past president of the [[American Philosophical Association]] and inaugural winner of the Prometheus Prize, stated of the book:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Max Holland has provided a wide-ranging and deeply-probing analysis of the influence of genetic relatedness and social context on human kinship. He argues that while genetic relatedness may play a role in the evolution of social behavior, it does not determine the forms of such behavior. His discussion is exemplary for its thoroughness, and should inspire more nuanced ventures in applying Darwinian approaches to sociocultural anthropology.&lt;ref name="amazon.com"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Sociocultural anthropology===
Kirk Endicott, professor emeritus of [[anthropology]] at the university of Dartmouth, wrote that Holland's book was:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A brilliant discussion of the relationship between kinship and social bonding as understood in evolutionary biology and in sociocultural anthropology. Among other contributions, it debunks the common misconception that biological evolution involves individual organisms actively pursuing the goal of increasing the numbers of their genes in successive generations, the measure of their so-called ‘individual inclusive fitness’. Holland demonstrates that an alternative non-deterministic interpretation of evolutionary biology is more compatible with actual human social behavior and with the frameworks that sociocultural anthropology employs.&lt;ref&gt;Kirk Endicott comment (book cover), |url=https://www.amazon.com/Social-Bonding-Nurture-Kinship-Compatibility/dp/1480182001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Janet Carsten, kinship theorist and professor of anthropology at the university of Edinburgh stated that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This book is a scholarly attempt to get beyond the often sterile oppositions between evolutionary and culturalist approaches to kinship. In bringing together two sides of the debate, it constitutes a valuable contribution to kinship studies.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Carsten comment, Author's website, |url=https://maximilianholland.com/2013/04/25/social-bonding-and-nurture-kinship-synopsis&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a review for the journal [[Critique of Anthropology]], Nicholas Malone concluded that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Lucid and effective... Holland has produced a significant work of scholarship that will be of interest to a wide swath of the anthropological community.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Malone Review, Critique of Anthropology, DOI: 10.1177/0308275X15594535&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Commenting on the book for the journal [[Social Analysis]], Anni Kajanus found that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Holland has done an excellent and thorough job in reviewing the disciplinary and interdisciplinary histories of approaches to kinship and social bonds in anthropology, biology, and psychology. Most importantly, he clarifies the different levels of analysis when looking at human behavior in real time and in the evolutionary time frame. This makes the book essential reading for anyone who acknowledges that human relatedness and social bonds are shaped by the
evolved dispositions of our species, their development through the life-course of an individual, and our specific cultural-historical environments... Holland’s book goes a long way toward clarifying and therefore advancing these theoretical debates&lt;ref&gt;Anni Kajanus Review, Social Analysis, web: http://www.berghahnjournals.com/abstract/journals/social-analysis/60/3/sa600308.xml, DOI: 10.3167/sa.2016.600308&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Biology===
An in-depth review of the book by [[primatology|primatologist]] Augusto Vitale, in the journal ''[[Folia Primatologica]]'', found that:
                                                                                                                                                                      &lt;blockquote&gt;This is, without a doubt, a very significant and important contribution to the on-going discussion about the determinants of sociality in humans as well as in other animals... A painstaking analysis of inclusive fitness, attachment theory and non-human primate social relationships, through a fascinating journey which ends with an anthropological account of social bonds in different cultures... It is a landmark in the field of evolutionary biology, which places genetic determinism in the correct perspective.&lt;ref name=AV2014 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Stuart Semple, evolutionary anthropologist, reviewing the book in the journal ''[[Acta Ethologica]]'' stated that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As someone who teaches behavioural ecology to biologists, and primate biology to social and biological anthropologists, I will be strongly recommending this book to all of my advanced undergraduates, masters and PhD students, as well as to my colleagues. Not only does it help to resolve debates that have run for many years, but it is also an outstanding example of what can be achieved by immersing oneself in literature from different fields, while retaining an intellectual openness and exercising incisive analysis. Many of us talk enthusiastically about inter- and multi-disciplinarity, but often this is not much more than lip service. This book is a shining example of what can be achieved when excellent scholars engage fully across disciplinary boundaries. There should be more texts like this.&lt;ref name=SS2015 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Published debate and criticism of the book==
{{Expand section|1=examples and additional citations|date=September 2014}}

In addition to praise for the book's significance, the [[Folia Primatologica]] review noted that the book is at times too dense and requires close reading;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The argument here and there becomes too detailed and tortuous, but it is absolutely captivating... [Colleagues] who are less used to extremely detailed theoretical reasoning, will find it difficult at the beginning...&lt;ref name=AV2014 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[sociolinguistics]], a '''style''' is a set of linguistic variants with specific [[social]] meanings. In this context, social meanings can include group membership, personal attributes, or beliefs. [[Variation (linguistics)|Linguistic variation]] is at the heart of the concept of linguistic style—without variation there is no basis for distinguishing social meanings. Variation can occur [[Syntax|syntactically]], [[Lexicon|lexically]], and [[Phonology|phonologically]].

Many approaches to interpreting and defining style incorporate the concepts of [[indexicality]], indexical order, stance-taking, and [[language ideology|linguistic ideology]]. Note that a style is not a fixed attribute of a speaker. Rather, a speaker may use different styles depending on context. Additionally, speakers often incorporate elements of multiple styles into their speech, either consciously or subconsciously, thereby creating a new style.

==Origins==
[[William Labov]] first introduced the concept of style in the context of sociolinguistics in the 1960s, though he did not explicitly define the term.&lt;ref name="Labov"&gt;Labov, W. (1966). The social stratification of English in New York City.[Washington]: Center for Applied Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt; Labov primarily studied individual linguistic variables, and how they were associated with various social groups (e.g. social classes). He summed up his ideas about style in five principles:&lt;ref&gt;Labov, William. 1984. "Field Methods of the Project in Linguistic Change and Variation." In John Baugh and Joel Sherzer, eds., Language in Use, Prentice-Hall: 28-53.&lt;/ref&gt;
;"There are no single style speakers." : [[#Style-shifting|Style-shifting]] occurs in all speakers to a different degree; interlocutors regularly and consistently change their linguistic forms according to context.
;"Styles can be ranged along a single dimension, measured by the amount of attention paid to speech." : Style-shifting correlates strongly with the amount of attention paid to speech. According to studies conducted by Labov, this was one of the single most important factors that determined whether or not an interlocutor would make a style-shift.
;"The vernacular, in which the minimum attention is paid to speech, provides the most systematic data for linguistic analysis." : Labov characterized the vernacular as the original base mode of speech, learned at a very young age, on which more complex styles build later in life. This "basic" style has the least variation, and provides the most general account of the style of a given group.
;"Any systematic observation of a speaker defines a formal context where more than the minimum attention is paid to speech." : In other words, even formal face-to-face interviews severely limit a speaker’s use of their vernacular style. An interlocutor’s vernacular style is most likely displayed if they do not perceive outside observers, and are not paying immediate attention to their own speech.
;"Face-to-face interviews are the only means of obtaining the volume and quality of recorded speech that is needed for quantitative analysis." : Quantitative analysis requires the kind of data that must be obtained in a very obvious, formal way.

Labov’s work primarily attempted to linked linguistic variants as a function of formality (a proxy for attention to speech) to specific social groups. In his study of /r/-variation in New York Department stores, he observed that those with a lower social class are less likely to pronounce postvocalic [r] in words like ''fourth'' and ''floor'', while those with a higher social class are more likely to pronounce postvocalic [r] in their less careful speech. However, once forced to pay attention to language, they style-shift in a way indicative of their social aspirations. That is, those with a middle social class often alter their pronunciation of /r/ in a way that is generally indicative of a higher social standing, while those with a lower or higher social class more or less maintain their original pronunciation (presumably because they were either happy with their current position in the social hierarchy or resigned to it).&lt;ref&gt;Labov, William.. Sociolinguistic patterns. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern approaches==

===Indexical order===
[[Penelope Eckert|Penny Eckert's]]&lt;ref name="Eckert"&gt;Eckert, Penelope. Variation and the indexical field. Journal of Sociolinguistics, 2008, 12: 453–476.&lt;/ref&gt; characterization of style as related to indexicality marked the beginning of a new approach to linguistic style. She builds on [[Michael Silverstein|Michael Silverstein's]] notion of [[Indexicality|indexical]] order: the notion that linguistic variables index a social group, which by association leads to the indexing of certain traits stereotypically associated with members of that group.  For example, in New York in the 1960s, a study by Labov&lt;ref name=Labov/&gt; showed that the clear articulation of postvocalic [r] in words like "fourth" and "floor" indexed a higher class (in New York), whereas the absence of postvocalic [r] indexed a lower class.&lt;ref name=Labov/&gt; However, the presence of lack of postvocalic [r] can also function as a higher order indexical that points indirectly to traits stereotypically associated with members of the upper or lower class.  In this way, not articulating the [r] in the word "fourth" could index, for example, a lack of education (the trait) in addition to a lower social class (the group). According to this theory, any linguistic variable has its own indexical field spanning any number of potential meanings; the meanings actually associated with the variable are determined by social context and the style in which the variable is being used.&lt;ref name=Eckert/&gt; These indexical fields are fluid and often change depending on their usage in different contexts or in combination with other variables. This view of style revolves around variation, and interpretation of variation as a purely indexical system built from [[Ideology|ideological]] connections.

===Ideology===
In [[Judith Irvine]]'s conception of style she emphasizes the fact that a style is defined only within a social framework.&lt;ref name="Irvine"&gt;[[Judith Irvine|Irvine, Judith]]. Style as distinctiveness: The culture and ideology of linguistic differentiation. In Penelope Eckert and John Rickford (eds.) Style and Sociolinguistic Variation. Cambridge, U.K.: Cambridge University Press, 2001, 21–43.&lt;/ref&gt; A variant and the social meanings it indexes are not inherently linked, rather, the social meanings exist as ideologically mediated interpretations made by members of the social framework. She highlights the fact that social meanings such as group membership mean nothing without an [[ideology]] to interpret them.

[[Mary Bucholtz|Mary Bucholtz's]] approach to style also relies heavily on ideology. She defines style as "a unidimensional continuum between vernacular and standard that varies based on the degree of speaker self-monitoring in a given speech context".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stanford.edu/~tylers/notes/emotion/Bucholtz_2009_reading_notes_Schnoebelen.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This continuum depends on the ideology of the speaker, for they self-monitor depending on their ideologies concerning particular words. Bucholtz explains the ideology of gendered slang, in particular, the [[Mexican people|Mexican]] slang for "dude", guey. Guey indexes a stance of cool solidarity, and indirectly, [masculinity]. Ochs's framework for stance dictates that stances are ideologically connected with social groups. Bucholtz argues that ideology connects the stylistic feature of using guey with particular groups of people based on age, gender (male), and race. She also defines the concept of stylization as a set of deviations from the style one would expect from a situation according to the ideology of the style and how it matches up to the situation at hand. This leads to the [[indexicality|indexing]] of groups with which the style is associated, and thus simplifies the indexical field at hand.

===Stance-taking===
Other theories on style often incorporate the role of stance-taking. These theories maintain that style is best viewed as consisting of smaller, more variable units known as stances. In this view, a stance is essentially a form of contextualization; it indicates the position of an interlocutor with respect to a particular utterance, conversation or other interlocutors.&lt;ref name="Johnstone"&gt;Johnstone, Barbara. "Stance, Style, and the Linguistic Individual" Sociolinguistic Perspectives on Stance,. Ed. Alexandra Jaffe. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; An interlocutor's use of language could imply, for instance,  that they feel a certain way about an issue at hand, or that they do not care for the subject, or the people around them; these positions with respect to the context are different stances.

According to stance theory, a given interlocutor uses certain variations among linguistic variables to take a stance or stances in an interaction. The set of stances interlocutors tend to repeat or use the most often in certain contexts (or in general) comprise their style. [[File:Stances.png|thumb|400px|Robert Podesva's depiction of the indexical relationships between linguistic resources, acts or activities, stance and style.]] This approach focuses more on interaction and reaction in a linguistic context, rather than a static identity or social group. Linguistic variables do not index specific social groups by themselves, but instead combine with other linguistic variables to index various stances and styles, which are in turn associated with social groups.&lt;ref name="Kiesling"&gt;Kiesling, Scott Fabius. A variable, a style, a stance: Word-final -er and ethnicity in Australian English.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kirkham, Sam. 2011. Personal style and epistemic stance in classroom discussion. Language and Literature 20(3). 207-217.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Podesva/&gt;  Kiesling writes:

{{cquote|In this view, personal styles are composed of a set, or repertoire, of stances, and a way of speaking represents not simply a personal style but a stance that a person tends to adopt repeatedly over time ... Because some stances are more favored by one group than another, this gives the appearance that a linguistic item directly indexes ...  that group, where in actuality it also, or primarily, indexes a stance … &lt;ref name=Kiesling/&gt;}}

In this model of linguistic variation, stances are an important middle step between linguistic variables and a style or characteristic social group.

==Emergence of new styles==

===Performative creation of new styles===
The [[Performativity|performative]] creation of style is the result of a desire to project a certain social image or [[#Style and stance|stance]]. [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|Interlocutors]] who wish to present in a certain manner may consciously alter their linguistic style to affect how they appear to others. An example of this performative style is exemplified by non-linguistic situations. In one study, Eckert interviewed several female students at [[Palo Alto High School]] in California. "New-wave" teens who wished to be distinctive adapted a more rebellious fashion style, wearing mostly dark clothes and pegged jeans, whereas popular, "[[preppy]]" girls tended towards light pastel colors and straight designer jeans.  However, a couple girls wished to portray themselves as unique without losing their popular [[Conformity|conformist]] [[Social identity theory|social identity]]. The table below compares resulting styles:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center; margin: 1em auto 1em auto;"
|-
! scope="col" style="width:100px;"| !! scope="col" style="width:100px;"| eye makeup!! scope="col" style="width:100px;"| general color scheme !! scope="col" style="width:100px;"| pants
|-
| style="text-align:left;"| "New-wave" girls|| dark/black || black || black, pegged
|-
| style="text-align:left;"|  "Preppy" girls|| light/none || pastels || blue designer straight-cut
|-
| style="text-align:left;"| "Preppy but unique" girls || light/none || pastels || blue, pegged
|}

As Eckert demonstrates, the "preppy" girls who wished to maintain a slightly distinctive style combined certain aspects of the "preppy" style with the "new-wave" style. They maintained their color choices and shied away from dark eye-makeup—but wore blue pegged jeans instead of the standard designer jeans of their group. This is because they perceive that the eye makeup indexes an "adult" or "slutty" characteristic, while the all-black color scheme is "scary".

In the same way, interlocutors often choose to performatively create their own linguistic style to suit the self-image they desire. In a [[#Gay styles|case study conducted by Podesva]], he studies the style of a gay lawyer, who combines certain aspects of common professional and gay linguistic features to create his own style, indexing both a "professional lawyer" characteristic and a unique "gay" characteristic with his speech.

===Nonperformative emergence of new styles===
Styles are not necessarily consciously created; there are a number of processes that contribute to the construction of meaning for both individual speech variants and styles. Obviously, individual variants can be adopted by multiple styles. When a variant is newly adopted by a style, it changes both the perception of the variant and the perception of the style. In the Eckertian view, a person's linguistic style identifies their position in an indexical field of social meanings. These social meanings are created by a continual analysis and interpretation of the linguistic variants that are observed based on who uses them.&lt;ref name=Eckert/&gt;&lt;ref name=Irvine/&gt;

==Style-shifting==
Style shifting refers to a single speaker changing style in response to context. As noted by Eckert and Rickford,&lt;ref name="isbn0-521-59789-7"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Eckert, Penelope |author2=Rickford, John |title=Style and sociolinguistic variation |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=2001 |pages= |isbn=0-521-59789-7 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in sociolinguistic literature terms style and '''register''' sometimes have been used interchangeably. Also, various connotations of style are a subject of study in [[Stylistics (linguistics)|stylistics]].

Style-shifting is a manifestation of intraspeaker (within-speaker) variation, in contrast with interspeaker (between-speakers) variation. It is a voluntary act which an individual effects in order to respond to or initiate changes in sociolinguistic situation (e.g., interlocutor-related, setting-related, topic-related).

[[William Labov]], while conducting [[Sociolinguistics#Traditional sociolinguistic interview|sociolinguistic interviews]], designated two types of spoken style, casual and formal, and three types of reading style (a reading passage, a word list, and a [[minimal pair]] list). Analysing style-shifting Labov postulated that "styles can be arranged along a single dimension, measured by the amount of attention paid to speech" (1972, as quoted in&lt;ref name="isbn0-631-22225-1"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Milroy, Lesley |author2=Gordon, John |title=Sociolinguistics: Method and Interpretation |publisher=Blackwell Pub |location=Cambridge, MA |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=0-631-22225-1 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), casual style requiring the least amount of conscious self-monitoring. Such style-shifting is often referred to as responsive (produced in response to normative pressures).&lt;ref name="isbn0-631-22225-1"/&gt;

In recent developments of stylistic variation analysis scholars such as [[Allan Bell (Sociolinguist)|Allan Bell]], [[Barbara Johnstone]], Natalie Schilling-Estes have been focusing on initiative dimension of style-shifting, which occurs when speakers proactively choose among various linguistic resources (e.g. dialectal, archaic or [[vernacular]] forms) in order to present themselves in a specific way. In initiative style-shifting speakers actively engage in  social practices to construct social meaning.

There have been a large number of suggested motivations for this phenomenon:
;Attention to speech model : In the attention to speech model it is proposed that the style a speaker uses is dependent on how much attention the speaker is paying to their own speech, which in turn is dependent on the formality of the situation.&lt;ref name="Labov1972a"&gt;Labov, William. Sociolinguistic patterns. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Labov1972b"&gt;Labov, William.. Some principles of linguistic methodology. Language in Society,1972, 1.97-120.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, each speaker has one most natural style, which is defined as the style the speaker uses when paying the least attention (i.e. in the most casual situations). Criticisms of this model include that it is difficult to quantify attention paid to speech&lt;ref name="Kies"&gt;Kiesling, Scott Fabius. 1998. Men’s identities and sociolinguistic variation: The case of fraternity men. Journal of Sociolinguistics 2/1.69-99&lt;/ref&gt; and the model suggests that a speaker has only one style for a given level of formality.&lt;ref name="Hindle"&gt;Hindle, D. The social and situational conditioning of phonetic variation. Dissertation. University of Pennsylvania, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;
;Communication accommodation theory : Communication accommodation theory (CAT) seeks to explain style-shifting in terms of two processes: convergence, in which the speaker attempts to shift their speech to match that of the interlocuter to gain social approval, and divergence, in which the speaker attempts to distance themselves from the interlocuter by shifting their speech away from that of the interlocuter.&lt;ref name="Schilling-Este"&gt;Kiesling, S. F., and Schilling-Estes, N. Language Style as Identity Construction: A Footing and Framing Approach. Poster presented at NWAVE 27, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Two specific shortcomings of this basic form of CAT include its inability to explain situations in which convergence occurs when the motivation is clearly not social approval (e.g. in arguments)&lt;ref&gt;Mosher, D., Mortimer, L., Grebel, M. Verbal aggressive behavior in delinquent boys. Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 1968 73.454-60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Argyle, M., and Kendon, A. The experimental analysis of social performance. Advances in experimental social psychology, Berkowitz, L. (ed.), 1967 vol. 3, 55-98. New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and the fact that non-convergent speech is often used to maintain social distance in asymmetric relationships (e.g. employer-employee).&lt;ref&gt;Montepare, J. M., and Vega, C. Women’s vocal reactions to intimate and casual male friends. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 1988 14.103-12.&lt;/ref&gt;
;Audience design model : The audience design model is very similar to communication accommodation theory with an added component: the audience design model proposes the existence of nonpresent reference groups, with which a speaker may converge or diverge.&lt;ref name="Bell"&gt;Bell, Allan. Language style as audience design. Language in Society, 1984 13.145-204.&lt;/ref&gt; In this theory, speakers constantly negotiating their relationship, not only with the audience, but also with other nonpresent people or groups that come up in the discourse.&lt;ref name=Schilling-Este/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bell/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BellJohnson"&gt;Bell, Allan, and Johnson, Gary. Towards a sociolinguistics of style. University of Pennsylvania Working Papers in Linguistics 4.1: A Selection of Papers from NWAVE, 1997, 25. 1-21.&lt;/ref&gt;
;Style-shifting as an act of identity: Style shifting can be a creative process, in which speakers shape their speech to associate or disassociate themselves with specific social groups. Furthermore, a speaker does not have an underlying style. Rather, the casual speech style that some sociolinguists consider fundamental is no more fundamental than any other style.&lt;ref name="LePage"&gt;LePage, R.B., and Andrée Tabouret-Keller. Acts of identity: Creole-based approaches to language and ethnicity. Cambridge/New York: Cambridge University Press,1985&lt;/ref&gt;
;Footing and framing model : A footing is a role that a speaker occupies and may be described as follows:{{Quote| &lt;br&gt;"[footings] may change many times during the course of a single interaction, and speakers often balance a number of roles simultaneously, since footing exist on a number of different levels, from the personal interactional (e.g. the role of `friend') to the institutional (e.g. `CEO of a corporation') to the sociocultural (e.g. `Native American male')."&lt;ref name=Kies/&gt;}}By style shifting speakers are able to cast themselves in different footings. Also central to this model is the frame of the discourse, which is the feeling of the interactants about what kind of interaction is occurring (e.g. formal interview, casual conversation, political discussion, etc.). Different frames are being continuously foregrounded and backgrounded relative to one another throughout the discourse. The footings that speakers adopt through style-shifting are dependent on which frames are most prominent at any given time.&lt;ref name=Kies/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goffman, Erving, Forms of talk. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style matching==
Style matching is defined as the matching of behaviors between a speaker and an [[interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutor]].&lt;ref name="N"&gt;Niederhoffer, Kate G. Pennebaker, James W. Linguistic Style Matching in Social Interaction. Journal of Language and Social Psychology, Vol.21No.4,December 2002. 337-360 {{doi|10.1177/026192702237953}} 2002 Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;  The premise of the theory is that individuals have the ability to strategically negotiate the social distance between themselves and their interaction partners.  This can be done linguistically, [[paralinguistic]]ally, and non-verbally, for example, by varying speech style, rate, pitch, and [[gaze]].

One theory behind linguistic style matching suggests that the words one speaker uses prime the listener to respond in a specific way. In this fashion, an interlocutor is influenced by her partner’s language at the word level in natural conversation in the same way that one’s non-verbal behavior can be influenced by another’s movement.

Additionally, Kate G. Niederhoffer&lt;ref name=N/&gt; proposes a coordination-engagement hypothesis, which suggests that the degree of engagement should be predictive of both linguistic and nonverbal coordination. There exists an interactional complexity whereby people can converge on some communicative features to meet social needs, but diverge on others for identity management. For example, one can diverge in accent but converge in [[lexical diversity]].&lt;ref&gt;Janet M. Fuller (1996). When cultural maintenance means linguistic convergence: Pennsylvania German evidence for the Matrix Language Turnover hypothesis. Language in Society, 25 , pp 493-514 {{doi|10.1017/S0047404500020790}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals in two-person interactions exhibit linguistic style matching on both the conversational level and on a turn-by-turn level.&lt;ref name=N/&gt; This coordinated use of language occurs at a remarkably basic level (e.g., classes of words) and appears to occur independently of the perceived quality of an interaction, the length of the interaction, whether the interaction is face-to-face or on an Internet-like chat, etc.  Socially, two people appear to fall into this coordinated way of interacting almost immediately even if they have never spoken to one another before. The listener is influenced by many linguistic primes set up by the speaker. All of this occurs on an unconscious level and is sensitive to the power differential between the participants, with less dominant participants generally being more attentive to more dominant participants’ words.

==Case studies==

===Urban styles===
An opposition between urban and suburban linguistic variables is common to all metropolitan regions of the United States. Although the particular variables distinguishing urban and suburban styles may differ from place to place, the trend is for urban styles to lead in the use of nonstandard forms and [[negative concord]].
In Penny Eckert’s study of Belten High in the Detroit suburbs, she noted a stylistic difference between two groups that she identified: school-oriented jocks and urban-oriented, school-alienated burnouts.&lt;ref name=Eckert/&gt; The variables she analyzed were the usage of negative concord and the mid and low vowels involved in the [[Northern Cities Shift]], which consists of the following changes: æ &gt; ea, a &gt; æ, ə &gt; a, ʌ &gt; ə, ay &gt; oy, and ɛ &gt; ʌ  ([y] here is equivalent to the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] symbol [j]). All of these changes are urban-led, as is the use of negative concord.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Burnouts.PNG|thumb|400px|alt=burnouts diagram|Use of Detroit variables involved in the Northern Cities Shift (NCS) by gender and social category. Black = greatest use, gray = second greatest use.]] --&gt;The older, mostly stabilized changes, æ &gt; ea, a &gt; æ, and ə &gt; a, were used the most by women, while the newer changes, ʌ &gt; ə, ay &gt; oy, and ɛ &gt; ʌ were used the most by burnouts. Eckert theorizes that by using an urban variant such as [foyt], they were not associating themselves with urban youth. Rather, they were trying to [[indexicality|index]] traits that were associated with urban youth, such as "tough" and "street-smart".

This theory is further supported by evidence from a subgroup within the burnout girls, which Eckert refers to as ‘burned-out’ burnout girls. She characterizes this group as being even more anti-establishment than the ‘regular’ burnout girls. This subgroup led overall in the use of negative concord as well as in female-led changes. This is unusual because negative concord is generally used the most by males. ‘Burned-out’ burnout girls were not indexing masculinity &amp;mdash; this is shown by their use of female-led variants and the fact that they were found to express femininity in non-linguistic ways. This shows that linguistic variables may have different meanings in the context of different styles.

===Gay styles===

There is some debate about what makes a style "gay." In stereotypically flamboyant gay speech, the phonemes /s/ and /l/ have a greater duration.&lt;ref name="Christ"&gt;Crist, Sean. 1997. Duration of Onset Consonants in Gay Male Stereotyped Speech. University of Pennsylvania Working Papers in Linguistics 4.3.53-70.&lt;/ref&gt; People are also more likely to identify those with higher frequency ranges as gay.&lt;ref name="Rogers"&gt;Rogers, Henry, Ron Smyth, and Greg Jacobs. 2000. Vowel and Sibilant Duration in Gay- and Straight-sounding Male Speech. Paper presented at the International Gender and Language Association Conference 1, Stanford.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, there are many different styles represented within the gay community. There is much linguistic [[variation (linguistics)|variation]] in the gay community, and each subculture appears to have its own distinct [[feature (linguistics)|features]]. According to Podesva et al., "gay culture encompasses reified categories such as leather daddies, clones, drag queens, circuit boys, guppies (gay yuppies), gay prostitutes, and activists both mainstream and radical, as well as more local communities of practice which may not even have names."&lt;ref name="Podesva"&gt;Podesva, Robert J., Sarah J. Roberts and Kathryn Campbell-Kibler. 2002. Sharing resources and indexing meanings in the production of gay styles. In Kathryn Campbell-Kibler, Robert J. Podesva, Sarah J. Roberts and Andrew Wong (eds.) Language and Sexuality: Contesting Meaning in Theory and Practice. Stanford , California : CSLI Press. 175–190.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, each of these sub-cultures speaks with a different style than all the other sub-cultures.

There are also many features that are fairly prevalent in all of society but can index homosexuality in particular contexts. "Cooperative discourse" is often considered a feature of gay linguistic style, but is also used by some straight men, as well as by women.&lt;ref&gt;Leap, William L. 1996. Word’s Out: Gay Men’s English. Minneapolis: University of
Minnesota Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This is in line with an approach to style that emphasizes stance.

Podesva et al.&lt;ref name=Podesva/&gt; performed a study describing a sub-style within gay culture that some gay activists, lawyers, or other professionals use. The gay lawyer in their study does not want to appear "too gay," lest he also convey frivolity or other characteristics that he deemed unprofessional. It was important to him that he appear rational, educated, and competent as a lawyer. This is in line with the audience approach to style in which styles receive their meaning as a result of their opposition to other styles in their social sphere (in this case other gay styles). The lawyer's high release of word final stops, a variable also often found in the language of geek-girls and Orthodox Jews, indexes a desire to appear educated and not "too gay."  This actually indexes his gay [[identity (social science)|identity]] because he is tailoring his gay style (or lack thereof).&lt;ref name=Podesva/&gt;

In [[biophysics]], '''transduction''' is the [[wiktionary:conveyance|conveyance]] of energy from one [[electron]] (a donor) to another (a receptor), at the same time that the class of energy changes.

Photonic energy, the [[kinetic energy]] of a [[photon]], may follow the following paths:
* be released again as a photon of less energy;
* be transferred to a recipient with no change in class;
* be dissipated as heat; or
* be transduced

In [[photosynthesis]], when the electrons of the "[[chlorophyll]] pair" receive the photon energy from the "collecting" associated [[pigments]], the photonic energy is "destined" to link one molecule of [[phosphate]] to one of [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD]]. The resulting [[NADP]] in turn will use the stored energy in the generation of [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], which is the end point of the light-induced photosynthetic process. [This is quite wrong: NADP is reduced (electrons are added) to NADPH in the light reactions of linear electron transport. No ATP involved directly. Phosphate is "linked" to ADP, forming ATP, but this does not involve NADP(H), it involves the proton gradient (and ATP synthase) generated by photosynthetic electron transport processes.] This means that the photon's energy ends up its circuit by being ''transduced'' to an electron that takes part in the formation of a molecular link of energy-rich phosphate.

In the pathway of this end-point transduction, the energy is ''transferred'' along a number of molecules ([[cytochrome]]s), in a downward way so that energy is partially ''dissipated'' at each step. The liberated heat energy serves the [[homeostasis]] of the plant, and at the end of the chain the remaining energy is perhaps exactly the one that is needed to build NADP.

This process is committed; i.e. there is no return path. Homeostasis, theoretically, might save the day only at the beginning: before the luminic energy transferred to the "chlorophyl pair" is conveyed to the first element of the cytochrome chain, there is a gap in the process when the energy is carried as a series of ''excitons''. These are now called ''resonant-energy-transferring'' molecules of the chlorophyll class, which transfer what is considered electromagnetic energy, from one to its neighbor with no participation of electrons nor enzymes. At this stage, if the first pigment has received an excess of light, the "exciton" perhaps might ''dissipate'' the energy as heat.

[[Image:TurbidityStandards.jpg|right|frame|Turbidity standards of 5, 50, and 500 NTU]]
'''Turbidity''' is the cloudiness or [[haze|haziness]] of a [[fluid]] caused by large numbers of individual [[Particle (ecology)|particles]] that are generally invisible to the [[naked eye]], similar to [[smoke]] in [[air]]. The measurement of turbidity is a key test of [[water quality]].

[[Fluids]] can contain suspended solid matter consisting of particles of many different sizes. While some suspended material will be large enough and heavy enough to settle rapidly to the bottom of the container if a liquid sample is left to stand (the [[Settling|settable solids]]), very small particles will settle only very slowly or not at all if the sample is regularly agitated or the particles are [[colloid]]al. These small solid particles cause the liquid to appear turbid.

'''Turbidity''' (or haze) is also applied to transparent solids such as glass or plastic. In plastic production, haze is defined as the percentage of light that is deflected more than 2.5° from the incoming light direction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thermallaminatingfilms.com/haze.php Haze technical definition] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150822002852/http://www.thermallaminatingfilms.com/haze.php |date=August 22, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Turbidity in open water may be caused by growth of [[phytoplankton]]. Human activities that disturb land, such as [[construction]], [[mining]] and [[agriculture]], can lead to high [[sediment]] levels entering water bodies during rain storms due to [[storm water]] [[surface runoff|runoff]]. Areas prone to high bank erosion rates as well as [[urbanized]] areas also contribute large amounts of turbidity to nearby waters, through stormwater [[water pollution|pollution]] from [[Pavement (material)|paved]] surfaces such as roads, bridges and parking lots.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Washington, D.C. [http://www.epa.gov/owow/nps/urbanmm/index.html "National Management Measures to Control Nonpoint Source Pollution from Urban Areas."] Chapters 7 and 8. Document No. EPA 841-B-05-004. November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Some industries such as [[quarry]]ing, [[coal mine|mining]] and coal recovery can generate very high levels of turbidity from colloidal rock particles.

In drinking water, the higher the turbidity level, the higher the risk that people may develop [[gastrointestinal diseases]].&lt;ref&gt;A.G. Mann, C.C. Tam, C.D. Higgins, &amp; L.C. Lodrigues. (2007). The association between drinking water turbidity and gastrointestinal illness: a systematic review. ''BMC Public Health''. 7(256): 1 - 7&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially problematic for immunocompromised people, because contaminants like [[virus]]es or [[bacteria]] can become attached to the suspended solids. The suspended solids interfere with water disinfection with [[chlorine]] because the particles act as shields for the virus and bacteria. Similarly, suspended solids can protect bacteria from [[Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation|ultraviolet (UV) sterilization]] of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.civilengineerbuddy.com/turbidity-water-its-measurment-environmental-engineering/|title=Turbidity of water and its measurment &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93; – disinfection not possible without removing suspended particles|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In water bodies such as [[lake]]s, rivers and [[reservoirs]], high turbidity levels can reduce the amount of light reaching lower depths, which can inhibit growth of submerged [[aquatic plants]] and consequently affect species which are dependent on them, such as [[fish]] and [[shellfish]]. High turbidity levels can also affect the ability of fish gills to absorb dissolved oxygen. This phenomenon has been regularly observed throughout the [[Chesapeake Bay]] in the eastern United States.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Annapolis, MD. [http://www.fws.gov/chesapeakebay/savpage.htm "Decline of Submerged Plants in Chesapeake Bay."]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EPA. Chesapeake Bay Program. Annapolis, MD. [http://www.chesapeakebay.net/sediments.aspx "Sediments."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927073649/http://www.chesapeakebay.net/sediments.aspx |date=2011-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many [[mangrove]] areas, high turbidity is needed in order to support certain species, such as to protect juvenile fish from predators. For most mangroves along the eastern coast of [[Australia]], in particular [[Moreton Bay]], turbidity levels as high as 600 [[Nephelometer|Nephelometric]] Turbidity Units (NTU) are needed for proper [[ecosystem]] health.

==Measurement==
[[Image:Runoff torbidity.jpg|thumb|right|Turbid creek water caused by heavy rains.]]

The most widely used measurement unit for turbidity is the [[Formazine|Formazin]] Turbidity Unit (FTU). [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] refers to its units as FNU (Formazin Nephelometric Units). [[ISO 7027]] provides the method in water quality for the determination of turbidity. It is used to determine the [[concentration]] of suspended particles in a sample of water by measuring the incident light scattered at right angles from the sample. The scattered light is captured by a [[photodiode]], which produces an electronic signal that is converted to a turbidity. [[Open source hardware]] has been developed following the ISO 7027 method to measure turbidity reliably using an [[Arduino]] microcontroller and inexpensive [[LED]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Bas Wijnen, G. C. Anzalone and Joshua M. Pearce, Open-source mobile water quality testing platform. Journal of Water, Sanitation and Hygiene for Development, 4(3) pp. 532–537 (2014). doi:10.2166/washdev.2014.137 [https://www.academia.edu/8319858/Open-source_mobile_water_quality_testing_platform open access]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several practical ways of checking water quality, the most direct being some measure of [[attenuation]] (that is, reduction in strength) of light as it passes through a sample column of water. The alternatively used Jackson Candle method (units: Jackson Turbidity Unit or '''JTU''') is essentially the inverse measure of the length of a column of water needed to completely obscure a candle flame viewed through it. The more water needed (the longer the water column), the clearer the water. Of course water alone produces some attenuation, and any substances dissolved in the water that produce color can attenuate some wavelengths. Modern instruments do not use candles, but this approach of attenuation of a light beam through a column of water should be calibrated and reported in JTUs.

The propensity of particles to scatter a light beam focused on them is now considered a more meaningful measure of turbidity in water. Turbidity measured this way uses an instrument called a [[nephelometer]] with the detector set up to the side of the light beam. More light reaches the detector if there are lots of small particles scattering the source beam than if there are few. The units of turbidity from a calibrated nephelometer are called Nephelometric Turbidity Units ('''NTU'''). To some extent, how much light reflects for a given amount of particulates is dependent upon properties of the particles like their shape, color, and reflectivity. For this reason (and the reason that heavier particles settle quickly and do not contribute to a turbidity reading), a correlation between turbidity and [[total suspended solids]] (TSS) is somewhat unusual for each location or situation.

Turbidity in lakes, reservoirs, channels, and the ocean can be measured using a [[Secchi disk]]. This black and white disk is lowered into the water until it can no longer be seen; the depth (Secchi depth) is then recorded as a measure of the transparency of the water (inversely related to turbidity). The Secchi disk has the advantages of integrating turbidity over depth (where variable turbidity layers are present), being quick and easy to use, and inexpensive. It can provide a rough indication of the depth of the [[euphotic zone]] with a 3-fold division of the ''Secchi depth'', however this cannot be used in shallow waters where the disk can still be seen on the bottom.

An additional device, which may help measuring turbidity in shallow waters is the turbidity tube.&lt;ref&gt;{{dead link|date=November 2013}}Waterwatch Australia, Module 4 - physical and chemical parameters [https://web.archive.org/web/20060513024523/http://www.waterwatch.org.au/publications/module4/turbidity.html "Methods Turbidity"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Myre, E, Shaw, R. The Turbidity Tube: Simple and Accurate Measurement of Turbidity in the Field. [http://watsanmissionassistant.wikispaces.com/file/view/Turbidity-Myre_Shaw.pdf/360203097/Turbidity-Myre_Shaw.pdf "The Turbidity Tube"]&lt;/ref&gt; The turbidity tube condenses water in a graded tube which allows determination of turbidity based on a contrast disk in its bottom, being analogous to the Secchi disk.

Turbidity in air, which causes solar attenuation, is used as a measure of pollution. To model the attenuation of beam irradiance, several turbidity parameters have been introduced, including the Linke turbidity factor (T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;HelioClim (Center for Energy and Processes). Paris, France.

==Standards and test methods==
[[File:Turbidimeters.JPG|thumb|[[Turbidimeter]]s used at a water purification plant to measure turbidity (in NTU) of raw water and clear water after filtration.]]

===Drinking water standards===
Governments have set standards on the allowable turbidity in drinking water. In the United States, systems that use conventional or direct filtration methods turbidity cannot be higher than 1.0 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU) at the plant outlet and all samples for turbidity must be less than or equal to 0.3 NTU for at least 95 percent of the samples in any month. Systems that use filtration other than the conventional or direct filtration must follow state limits, which must include turbidity at no time exceeding 5 NTU. Many drinking water utilities strive to achieve levels as low as 0.1 NTU.&lt;ref&gt;EPA. Washington, DC. [http://www.epa.gov/safewater/contaminants/index.html#3 "Drinking Water Contaminants."] 2009-09-11.&lt;/ref&gt; The European standards for turbidity state that it must be no more than 4 NTU.&lt;ref&gt;http://dwi.defra.gov.uk/consumers/advice-leaflets/standards.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]], establishes that the turbidity of drinking water should not be more than 5 NTU, and should ideally be below 1 NTU.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lenntech.com/turbidity.htm#ixzz3R3yPreK7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ambient water standards===
The U.S. [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has published water quality criteria for turbidity.&lt;ref&gt;EPA. Washington, DC. [http://www.epa.gov/waterscience/criteria/goldbook.pdf "Quality Criteria for Water."] (Commonly known as the "Gold Book.") 1986. Document No. EPA-440/5-86-001.&lt;/ref&gt; These criteria are scientific assessments of the effects of turbidity, which are used by states to develop [[Clean Water Act#Water Quality Standards Program|water quality standards]] for water bodies. (States may also publish their own criteria.) Some states have [[Promulgation|promulgated]] water quality standards for turbidity, including:
* [[Louisiana]]. 25, 50 or 150 NTU, or background plus 10 percent, depending on the water body.&lt;ref&gt;Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality. Baton Rouge, LA.[http://epa.gov/waterscience/standards/wqslibrary/la/la_6_wqs.pdf "Surface Water Quality Standards."] ''Louisiana Administrative Code (LAC).'' Title 33, Part IX, Chapter 11. August 6, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;.
* [[Vermont]]. 10 NTU or 25 NTU, depending on water body classification.&lt;ref&gt;Vermont Water Resources Board. Montpelier, VT. [http://www.nrb.state.vt.us/wrp/publications/wqs.pdf "Vermont Water Quality Standards."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231093748/http://www.nrb.state.vt.us/wrp/publications/wqs.pdf |date=2013-12-31 }} January 25, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. 5 NTU over background (when background is 50 NTU or less), or 10 percent increase when background is over 50 NTU.&lt;ref&gt;Washington Department of Ecology. Olympia, WA.[http://www.epa.gov/waterscience/standards/wqslibrary/wa/wa_10_chapter173-201a.pdf "Water Quality Standards for Surface Waters of the State of Washington."] ''Washington Administrative Code (WAC).'' Chapter 173-201A. November 18, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
'''Turbidity''' is commonly treated using either a settling or filtration process. Depending on the application, chemical reagents will be dosed into the wastewater stream to increase the effectiveness of the settling or filtration process. [[Potable water]] treatment and municipal wastewater plants often remove turbidity with a combination of sand filtration, settling tanks, and clarifiers.

[[In-situ water treatment]] or direct dosing for the treatment of turbidity is common when the affected water bodies are dispersed (i.e. there are numerous water bodies spread out over a geographical area, such as small drinking water reservoirs), when the problem is not consistent (i.e. when there is turbidity in a water body only during and after the wet season) or when a low cost solution is required. In-situ treatment of turbidity involves the addition of a reagent, generally a [[flocculant]], evenly dispensed over the surface of the body of water. The flocs then settle at the bottom of the water body where they remain or are removed when the water body is drained. This method is commonly used at [[coal mine]]s and coal loading facilities where stormwater collection ponds have seasonal issues with turbidity. A number of companies offer portable treatment systems for in-situ water treatment or direct dosing of reagents.

===Reagents===
There are a number of [[chemical reagent]]s that are available for treating turbidity. Reagents available for treating turbidity include [[aluminium sulfate]] or [[alum]] (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;·nH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), [[ferric chloride]] (FeCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[gypsum]] (CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), poly-[[aluminium chloride]], long chain [[acrylamide]]-based [[polymer]]s and numerous proprietary reagents.&lt;ref&gt;Earth Systems, Clear Solutions newsletter - Focus on Turbidity [http://www.earthsystems.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/ClearSolutions_No1_2003.pdf] 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The water chemistry must be carefully considered when chemical dosing as some reagents, such as alum, will alter the [[pH]] of the water.

The dosing process must also be considered when using reagents as the [[Flocculation|flocs]] may be broken apart by excessive mixing.

'''Voluntarism''', sometimes referred to as '''voluntary action''', is the principle that individuals are free to choose goals and how to achieve them within the bounds of certain societal and cultural constraints, as opposed to actions that are coerced or [[predetermined]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|chapter=Chapter Four: Talcott Parsons and Robert Merton, Functionalism and Modernization|title=Introduction to Sociological Theory: Theorists, Concepts, and their Applicability to the Twenty-First Century|last=Dillon|first=Michele|publisher=Wiley|orig-year=2009|year=2013|isbn=9781118471906|page=161, 181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Volunteerism==
Volunteer management specialist Susan Ellis differentiates between "voluntarism" and "[[volunteerism]]":

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Voluntarism" (the older term) refers to everything voluntary. In the United States this includes religion. It certainly encompasses the entire "[[voluntary sector]]," but "voluntary" in the "voluntarism" context means not mandated by law (as government is). Many voluntary sector (nonprofit) agencies have a volunteer board because that is a legal requirement, but may not utilize volunteers in direct service in any way. There are subjects within "voluntarism" that have nothing to do with volunteers, such as [[Unrelated Business Income Tax]] legislation, proposal writing, and compensation law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Susan J. Ellis |title=Volunt/ar/eer/ism: What's the Difference? |url=https://www.energizeinc.com/tips/voluntareerism-whats-difference |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030822/https://www.energizeinc.com/tips/voluntareerism-whats-difference |archivedate=March 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Voluntary provision of services to religious, civil, medical, educational, environmental and other private or governmental organizations doubtless has a long history. Such volunteer efforts keep expenses down for non-profit and philanthropic organizations, empower individuals and groups to help others, and make volunteers feel needed.&lt;ref name="Perkins"&gt;{{cite web |author=Susan Perkins |url=http://www.learningtogive.org/papers/paper67.html |title=Voluntarism |publisher=Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University |accessdate=March 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Voluntarism flourished in the 19th and early 20th centuries and was empowering especially to the women who had been excluded from political participation outside the home. Women’s organizations dealt with social problems created by rapid industrialization and urbanization, and by massive immigration which were not addressed by institutions of the time and had a great influence on American political culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kathryn Kish Sklar |url=http://www.puaf.umd.edu/IPPP/summer98/quckened_conscience.htm |date=1998 |title=The "Quickened Conscience"], |publisher=Institute for Philosophy and Public Policy, [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070806053219/http://www.puaf.umd.edu/IPPP/summer98/quckened_conscience.htm |archivedate=August 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Voluntarism is also used to describe non-coercive methods of recruiting soldiers, from participants in European and American military service to youthful combatants in civil war in Sierra Leone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lermuseum.org/ler/mh/wwii/voluntarism.html |title=Military History: Second World War: Homefront, 1940–45 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213221221/http://www.lermuseum.org/ler/mh/wwii/voluntarism.html |archivedate=December 13, 2007 |access-date=December 23, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}; {{cite book |author=John O'Sullivan |title=From Voluntarism to Conscription: Congress and Selective Service, 1940–1945 |year=1982}}; {{cite web |url=https://www.rand.org/pubs/monographs/MG265/images/webS0228.pdf |format=PDF |title=The End of Conscription in Europe? |author=Christopher Jehn |author2=Zachary Selden |publisher=National Security Division, Congressional Budget Office, United States Congress |date=2002 |accessdate=March 1, 2014 }}; {{cite web |author=Krijn Peters |url=http://www.iss.co.za/pubs/Monographs/No100/Contents.html |title=Re-Examining Voluntarism, Youth Combatants in Sierra Leone: Monograph No 100 |publisher=[http://iss.co.za Institute for Security Studies] |date=April 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615210147/http://www.iss.co.za/pubs/Monographs/No100/Contents.html |archivedate=June 15, 2008 |access-date=December 23, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Voluntarism has been a phrase used in labor relations.  In Britain, it means the state refrains from directly intervening in industrial relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/emire/UNITED%20KINGDOM/VOLUNTARISM-EN.htm |title=United Kingdom, Voluntarism |publisher=Eurofound |accessdate=March 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early American labor movement it meant trade unions should focus on "pure and simple" gains in wages and working conditions and not independent labor politics and [[industrial unionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=David Brian Robertson |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=38781 |title=Voluntarism Against the Open Shop: Labor and Business Strategies in the Battle for American Labor Markets] |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |journal=Studies in American Political Development |date=April 1999 |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=146–85 |accessdate=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Willful Liberalism: Voluntarism and Individuality in Political Theory and Practice'', [[Johns Hopkins University]] political science professor [[Richard E. Flathman]] argues that liberals must understand more about individuality and self-reliance and self-responsibility and therefore be more open of acceptance of voluntary action and less concerned with ordering political society. He notes, "Americans of all ages, all conditions, and all dispositions constantly form associations," which he describes as "of a thousand other kinds, religious, moral, serious, futile, general or restricted, enormous or diminutive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Richard E. Flathman |url=https://books.google.com/?id=xvqIeEeVSyIC&amp;dq=voluntarism&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPP3,M1 |title=Willful Liberalism: Voluntarism and Individuality in Political Theory and Practice |publisher=[[Cornell University Press#press|Cornell University Press]] |year=1992 |page=76 |isbn=9780801499555}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[sociology]], voluntarism is an important aspect of the [[action theory (sociology)|action theory]] of [[Talcott Parsons]], as well as other theories of [[social action]] and [[agency (sociology)|agency]].

[[Voluntaryism|Voluntaryists]], [[free market]] advocates, [[libertarians]] and [[anarchists]] call for voluntary efforts to replace most or all government efforts, using both moral and utilitarian arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=David T.

==Examples from American history==

{{Globalise|USA|date=August 2018}}

Voluntary provision of services to the religious, civil, medical, educational, environmental and other private or governmental organizations doubtless has a long history.
* [[William Penn]], who established the Quakers in the late 17th century, preached taking responsibility for others and improving the world.
* [[Cotton Mather]], who lived during the colonial period, encouraged the formation of associations and causes.
* [[Benjamin Franklin]] organized a voluntary militia in Quaker-controlled Pennsylvania, whose pacifist legislature refused to support the American revolutionary war.
* [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] noted the unusually large number of voluntary associations in America.
* The [[Underground Railroad]] was a network of volunteers who helped slaves escape from their captors in the South.
* [[Dorothea Dix]], a nurse, recruited and trained other women as nurses during the Civil War.
* [[Clara Barton]] also served as a Civil War nurse and went on to establish the American Red Cross in 1881 for relief of natural disasters, such as earthquakes.
* [[Jane Addams]] opened a settlement house in 1889 to teach volunteers how to help the poor improve their lives.
* In 1995, 93 million Americans volunteered an average of 4.3 hours per week.&lt;ref name="Perkins"/&gt;
