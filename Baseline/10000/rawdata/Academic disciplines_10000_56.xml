      <comment>instead of referring to an easily misleading 800 year period of a "zhou dynasty" it's better to speak of "western zhou" (1046-771), "eastern zhou"/"spring and autumn period" (771-475), and "warring states period" (475-221)</comment>

'''Ancient Chinese glass''' refers to all types of [[glass]] manufactured in [[China]] prior to the [[Qing Dynasty]] (1644–1911). In Chinese history, glass played a peripheral role in the arts and crafts, when compared to ceramics and metal work.&lt;ref&gt;Braghin 2002a&lt;/ref&gt; The limited archaeological distribution and use of glass objects are evidence of the rarity of the material. Literary sources date the first manufacture of glass to the 5th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Jenyns 1981&lt;/ref&gt; However, the earliest archaeological evidence for glass manufacture in China comes from the [[Warring States period]] (475 BC to 221 BC).

Chinese learned to manufacture glass comparatively later than the Mesopotamians, Egyptians and Indians.&lt;ref&gt;Pinder-Wilson 1991, p 140&lt;/ref&gt; Imported glass objects first reached China during the late [[Spring and Autumn period]] – early [[Warring States period]] (early 5th century BC), in the form of polychrome ‘[[eye bead]]s’.&lt;ref&gt;Braghin 2002b, p 6&lt;/ref&gt; These imports created the impetus for the production of indigenous glass beads.

During the Han period (206 BC to 220 AD) the use of glass diversified. The introduction of glass casting in this period encouraged the production of moulded objects, such as bi disks and other ritual objects.&lt;ref&gt;Pinder-Wilson 1991 p140&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese glass objects from the Warring States period and [[Han Dynasty]] vary greatly in chemical composition from the imported glass objects. The glasses from this period contain high levels of [[barium oxide]] (BaO) and [[lead]], distinguishing them from the soda-lime-silica glasses of Western Asia and Mesopotamia.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr and Wood 2004, pp 474-477&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the Han Dynasty (AD 220), the lead-barium glass tradition declined, with glass production only resuming during the 4th and 5th centuries AD.&lt;ref&gt;An Jiayao 2002, pp 45-46&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemical composition of Warring States and Han period glasses==

&lt;blockquote&gt;At present, it is accepted that in China, glassmaking began around the 5th century BCE during the late Spring and Autumn to early Warring States periods. Chemical analyses of glass samples dating to this time have identified no less than three glass systems: potash-lime, lead-barium, and potash; of these, lead-barium was the most significant in early China.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher F. Kim (2012), [http://brown.edu/Departments/Joukowsky_Institute/undergrad/prizes/Kim2012.pdf Early Chinese Lead-Barium Glass; Its Production and Use from the Warring States to Han Periods (475 BCE-220 CE)], PDF file&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the Warring States period and the Han Dynasty (5th century BC to early 3rd century AD) glass was imported from regions outside of East Asia, such as Mesopotamia. Imported Western faience and glass probably inspired the production of the first Chinese glasses. The main group of objects with Western influences are eye beads or dragonfly-eyed beads.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr and Wood 2004, p474&lt;/ref&gt; The key difference between Near Eastern eye beads and Chinese eye beads is their chemical composition. The coloured glasses used to produce the Chinese eye beads have a high lead and barium content. This type of composition was exclusive to China; and it was used to produce a range of glass objects until the end of the Han Dynasty.

Table 1 shows examples of chemical compositions of some Chinese glass objects.

''Table 1: Elemental compositions of Chinese glass from the Warring States Period to Han Dynasty. Data from the first 4 objects was taken from Brill et al. 1991; data from glass garment plaque was taken from Cheng Zhuhai and Zhou Changyuan 1991; and data from the ritual disk was taken from Shi Meiguang 1991.''

The Chinese lead-barium glasses typically present 5 to 15% BaO. The source of barium in the glass in not clear; however it is possible that ancient Chinese glassmakers used witherite (a mineral form of [[barium carbonate]]) as an ingredient.&lt;ref name="Brill et al. 1991, p 34"&gt;Brill et al. 1991, p 34&lt;/ref&gt; The use of a separate ingredient implies that barium had a specific function. This function could have been to flux the glass, by lowering the melting point of the melt; or stabilize the glass, by making it less soluble to water.&lt;ref name="Brill et al. 1991, p 34" /&gt; It could also have been added to opacify the glass. [[Electron microprobe]] analysis of glass fragments have shown that the [[turbidity]] of certain lead-barium glasses is produced by barium disilicate crystals.&lt;ref name="Brill et al. 1991, p 34" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shi Meiguang et al. 1992, p 24&lt;/ref&gt; This turbidity gives the glasses a jade-like appearance.

==Glass objects in the Warring States and Han Periods==
The period between the Warring States period and the Han Dynasty shaped the early Chinese glass industry. Most of the glass objects from this period come from archaeological excavations of tombs.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang Fukang 1991, p 157&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, most glass objects have fairly secure dating and context. During this period Chinese mainly used glass to produce two distinct types of objects, [[polychrome]] eye beads and [[monochrome]] funerary objects&lt;ref name="Braghin 2002b"&gt;Braghin 2002b&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eye Beads===
The earliest types of glass objects found in China are polychrome eye beads or dragonfly-eyed beads. The beads are found in burials from the late Spring and Autumn and early Warring States periods (early 5th century BC) up to late Warring State – early Western Han period.&lt;ref name="Braghin 2002b" /&gt; Most beads have a monochrome glass body covered by several layers of coloured glass. The layers of different colour glass are applied in alternating fashion to produce concentric circles.&lt;ref&gt;Braghin 2002b, p 4&lt;/ref&gt; The patterns of circles resemble eyes, giving the beads their name. This style of bead originated in the Near East during the mid 2nd millennium BC. The stylistic influence later spread to the [[Mediterranean]], [[Central Asia]] and China.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr and Wood 2004, p 474&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 5th century BC, the imported eye beads were considered exotic objects. They were mainly deposited in high status burials, such as the tomb of a male aristocrat of the Qi state at Langjiazhuang, Shadong.&lt;ref&gt;Braghin 2002b, pp 6-7&lt;/ref&gt; This situation changes during the middle and late Warring States Period. Eye beads from this period are manufactured from Chinese lead-barium glass and are mainly found in the regions of the middle [[Yangzi River]] Valley, indicating a connection to the Chu kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Braghin 2002b, pp 8-14&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, the beads became more common and available to a larger part of the Chinese society. Evidence of this is the presence of eye beads in medium and small burials, with modest funerary furnishings, as well as large, high-status burials.

The use of eye beads in burials rapidly declined at the beginning of the Western Han period. This is believed to be a result of the invasion of Chu kingdom territories by Qin and Han armies at the end of the 3rd century.&lt;ref&gt;Braghin 2002b, p 14&lt;/ref&gt; The collapse of the Chu kingdom would have brought production of eye-beads to an end.

===Monochrome opaque objects===
During the Warring States and Han periods, Chinese glassworkers took advantage of the similarities between glass and [[jade]]. In this period many glass objects, found in burial contexts, were made of opaque green, light green or milky white glass.&lt;ref&gt;Gao Zhixi 1991, 119&lt;/ref&gt; These objects have similar shapes to their jade counterpart, and were no doubt imitating that precious stone. Among these objects there were bi disks, ‘glass garments’ (or glass suits), sword accessories and vessels, among others.&lt;ref&gt;Jenyns, R. 1981, p 96&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fenn 1991, pp 59-60&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Cheng Zhuhai and Zhou Changyuan 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="An Jiayao 1991, p 7"&gt;An Jiayao 1991, p 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shi Meiguang et al. 1992"&gt;Shi Meiguang et al. 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Bi'' disks====
A [[Bi (jade)|''bi'' disk]] is a ritual object that resembles a flattened [[torus]]. The earliest archeological specimens were carved from stone (usually [[nephrite]]) and date back to the late Neolithic period; they became important burial elements during the 3rd millennium BC.&lt;ref name="Braghin 2002b" /&gt; They were placed on or near the head of the deceased person.

Glass ''bi'' disks are the most numerous kind of monochrome glass objects. They first became abundant in the Chu kingdom during the Warring States period. ''Bi'' disks from this period tend to be between 7.9 and 9.4&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter.&lt;ref&gt;Gao Zhixi 1991, p 119&lt;/ref&gt; The glass ''bi'' disks look very similar to their stone contemporaries, usually decorated on one side with a simple grain or cloud pattern typical of jade objects. They are mainly found in medium to small-sized tombs, indicating the middle strata of society rather than the elite.&lt;ref&gt;Braghin 2002b, p 23&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that glass ''bi'' disks were regarded as cheaper alternatives to jade ''bi'' disks.

====Glass burial suit plaques====
Plaques from glass burial suits or glass garments are directly linked to jade objects.&lt;ref&gt;Fenn el al. 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Braghin 2002b, pp 28 -31&lt;/ref&gt; Several pieces of burial suit plaques have been found in a few wooden-chambered burials from the late West Han Dynasty. The plaques come in different shapes, with rectangular being the most common. Some of these rectangular pieces have perforations in 4 corners, indicating that they were strung together, or sewn into a fabric, to form a protective burial suit.&lt;ref name="Braghin 2002b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Other shapes, such as circular, triangular and rhomboidal, are often decorated with moulded patterns. All the glass plaque shapes have jade counterparts, suggesting that glass burial suits were a cheaper alternative to jade burial suits.

====Vessels====
The earliest known Chinese glass vessels come from Western Han Dynasty tombs. To this date only two tombs are known to have had glass vessels among their funerary objects: the tomb of the Liu Dao, Prince of Chu in [[Xuzhou]] (128 BC), [[Jiangsu Province]]; and the tomb of Liu Sheng, Prince Jing of Zhongshan (113BC) at [[Mancheng]].&lt;ref&gt;Braghin 2002b, pp 31-34&lt;/ref&gt; The tomb at Xuzhou contained 16 light green cylindrical cups;&lt;ref name="Shi Meiguang et al. 1992"/&gt; while Prince Liu Sheng’s tomb contained 2 shallow double-handled cups and a plate.&lt;ref name="An Jiayao 1991, p 7" /&gt; All of the vessels were traditional Chinese shapes and made of lead-barium glass. Vessels in these forms were normally made out of [[lacquer]] or ceramic, although some jade vessels in those shapes are also known.&lt;ref name="Braghin 2002b" /&gt; All vessels were produced by mould casting.

A recurring theme in the literary, theatrical and film tradition of [[comedy]] is the use of [[stock character]]s representing [[authority]] figures, designed to poke fun at officialdom by showing that its members are not immune to entanglement in the ridiculous. This is an old tradition, well illustrated in works such as [[Chaucer]]'s [[Canterbury Tales]] and [[Voltaire]]'s ''[[Candide]]''.

This theme was commonly used by British comedy troupe, [[Monty Python]]. In their sketches, a "common comedic device was for authority figures (such as military officers, police, judges, Conservative politicians, BBC news announcers and even God) to take their characters to extremes by suddenly spouting complete nonsense".&lt;ref&gt;Craig Hight, Jane Roscoe. ''Faking It: Mock-Documentary and the Subversion of Factuality''. Manchester University Press (2002) {{ISBN|0-7190-5641-1}} (p. 80).&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples include: 
*Police officers, as seen in ''[[Keystone Kops]]'', ''[[Inspector Clouseau]]'', ''[[Reno 911!]]'', ''[[Police Academy (film series)|Police Academy]]'', ''[[The Thin Blue Line (TV series)|The Thin Blue Line]]'' and ''[[Carry On films|Carry On Constable]]''.
*Soldiers, as seen in ''[[The Phil Silvers Show|Sgt. Bilko]]'', ''[[Carry On films|Carry on Sergeant]]'', ''[[Stripes (film)|Stripes]]'', ''[[Blackadder Goes Forth]]'' and [[Il Capitano]] in the [[Commedia dell'arte]].
*Civil servants, as seen in ''[[Yes Minister]]'', ''[[Carlton-Browne of the F.O.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053044 Carlton-Browne of the F.O. (1959)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Ministry of Silly Walks]]'' and ''[[Spin City]]''.
*Priests, as seen in ''[[All Gas and Gaiters]]'' and ''[[Father Ted]]''.
*Teachers, [[Principal (school)|principals]], and [[dean (education)|deans]], as seen in ''[[Animal House]]'' and ''[[High School High]]''.

Some television shows, such as ''[[South Park]]'' and ''[[The Simpsons]]'', have a collection of characters that represent all of the main groups of authority figures, and each portray such figures as humorously flawed. Indeed, each show has a resident police officer — [[Recurring South Park characters#Officer Barbrady|Officer Barbrady]] and [[Chief Wiggum]], respectively — portrayed as an incompetent and bumbling idiot. The shows also mockingly portray their resident religious leader — [[Priest Maxi]] in ''South Park'' and [[Reverend Timothy Lovejoy]] in ''The Simpsons''. The shows also include, with slightly different characteristics, the flawed exercise of authority by parents, teachers, school principals, mayors, and occasionally of soldiers and politicians.

Examples can also be found in the art of the [[Russian joke]].

Such posts are manned by [[border guard]]s and are at all times connected by [[radio communication]] with ongoing border patrols in their [[region]] and the force headquarters in the interior of the country for their day-to-day functioning, passing on [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] and for requesting supplies and any needed reinforcements in emergencies.

Depending on the length and breath of a country's borders and geography, are located in a wide variety of terrain, including the inhospitable areas that often mark political boundaries.

==Layout==
Border outposts, where available, are built on strategic locations which are usually elevated at the highest points in the local terrain and where possible on hilltops along the border.

Depending upon [[international relations]] with the neighboring country and local [[Military strategy|strategic]] needs, BOPs are sometimes built with an assortment of a few administration and residential buildings or [[tent]]s, an [[Armory (military)|armory]], [[trenches]], [[bunkers]], [[wire obstacle]]s and fortified [[machine gun]] positions with a [[watchtower]].

A [[flagpole]] flying the country's [[national flag]] may be located on the premise along with a [[Antenna (radio)|Wireless Communication Antenna]] and a designated clearing as a make-do [[helipad]].

==Peacetime function==
Border outposts are manned in peacetime by the border guard to check [[smuggling]], [[Espionage|infiltration]] by [[spy|spies]] of untrusted neighboring countries, [[insurgents]] bent on smuggling weapons and explosives for [[terrorist]] attacks and [[subversive]] activities, [[illegal immigration]] and [[human trafficking]] etc.. They usually have [[watchtower]]s where soldiers are posted day and night on [[General Orders for Sentries|Sentry duty]] looking for intruders and illegal cross-border activity of any kind. Patrols go out regularly to patrol the international border to check illegal crossings and track any footprints of those who may have crossed over illegally or attempted to. In case intrusion by foreign elements is confirmed, it is the responsibility of the Border guard based on the BOP to trace the intruders by checking the nearby settlements, villages and towns and inform the law enforcement agencies, Customs and Police authorities.&lt;ref name="Bollywood film Border (1997)"&gt;Indian [[Bollywood]] film ''[[Border (1997 film)|Border]]'' (1997) made with the official assistance of the [[Border Security Force]] (BSF), [[Indian Army]] and [[Indian Airforce]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bollywood film Refugee (2000)"&gt;Indian Bollywood film ''[[Refugee (2000 film)|Refugee]]'' (2000) made with the official assistance of the Border Security Force (BSF)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wartime function==
During [[war]]time however the Border guard, the special forces tasked with patrolling the border in peacetime, withdraw from the Border outposts and provide assistance in a limited capacity to the country's regular [[Army]] which then comes and mans all the border outposts at the international border facing the enemy neighboring country. Wartime assistance of the Border guard to the Army is essential as they are familiar with the local terrain having patrolled it on a daily basis during peacetime. During [[war]]s these BOPs are reworked into well [[fortification|fortified]] dug-in positions from where regular [[Army (unit)|Army unit]]s can operate to defend the territorial integrity of the country.&lt;ref name="Bollywood film Border (1997)"/&gt;

This skyscraper stands on the site of [[Victor Horta]]'s [[Art Nouveau]] ''{{lang|fr|[[Maison du Peuple]]}}''. (Photo taken from {{lang|fr|Rue Samaritaine}}).]]
In [[urban planning]], '''Brusselization''' ([[American and British English spelling differences#-ise.2C -ize .28-isation.2C -ization.29|UK and US]]) or '''Brusselisation '''([[American and British English spelling differences#-ise.2C -ize .28-isation.2C -ization.29|UK variant]]) ({{lang-fr|bruxellisation}}, {{lang-nl|verbrusseling}}) is "the indiscriminate and careless introduction of modern high-rise buildings into [[gentrification|gentrified]] neighbourhoods" and has become a byword for "haphazard urban development and redevelopment".{{sfn|State|2004|p=51–52}}{{sfn|Stubbs|Makaš|2011|pp=121}}

The notion applies to anywhere whose development follows the pattern of the uncontrolled development of [[Brussels]] in the 1960s and 1970s, that resulted from a lack of [[zoning]] regulations and the city authorities' laissez-faire approach to city planning.{{sfn|State|2004|p=51–52}}{{sfn|Béghain|Gabilliet|2004|p=109}}{{sfn|Papadopoulos|1996|p=66}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Romańczyk, K. M. |doi=10.1016/j.cities.2011.08.007 |title=Transforming Brussels into an international city — Reflections on 'Brusselization' |year=2012 |journal=Cities |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=126–132 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Brussels ==

=== From the 1960s to the 1980s ===
The original Brusselization was the type of urban regeneration performed by the city of [[Brussels]] in connection with [[Expo 58]]. In order to prepare the city for Expo 58, buildings were torn down without regard either to their architectural or historical importance,{{sfn|Elliott|Cole|2010|p=64}} high-capacity square office/apartment buildings were built, boulevards were created and tunnels dug. Among the most controversial was the large-scale demolition of [[townhouse]]s for development of the high-rise business district in the [[Northern Quarter (Brussels)|Northern Quarter]]. All of these changes were designed to quickly increase the number of people working and living in the city and improve transportation.

Further radical changes resulted from Brussels's role as the center of the [[European Union|EU]] and [[NATO]],{{sfn|State|2004|p=51–52}}{{sfn|Elliott|Cole|2010|p=64}} beginning with the construction of the [[European Commission]] headquarters in 1959.{{sfn|Stubbs|Makaš|2011|pp=120}} The introduction of a high-speed rail network in the 1990s was the latest excuse to speculate on multiple rows of properties for modern office/hotel redevelopment, which led to the razing of neighborhood blocks near [[Brussels-South railway station]].

These changes caused outcry amongst the citizens of Brussels and by [[environmentalism|environmentalist]] and [[preservationism|preservationist]] organizations. The demolition of [[Victor Horta]]'s [[Art Nouveau]] ''{{lang|fr|[[Maison du Peuple]]}}'' in 1965 was one focus of such protests, (see photograph on right for what now stands on its site), as was the construction of the IBM Tower in 1978.{{sfn|State|2004|p=51–52}}

Many architects protested, and it was the architectural world that coined the name Brusselization for what was happening to Brussels. Architects such as {{lang|fr|[[Léon Krier]]}} and {{lang|fr|[[Maurice Culot]]}} formulated an [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] urban planning theory, as a rejection of the rampant modernism that they saw overtaking Brussels.{{sfn|Lagrou|2003|p=303}}{{sfn|Béghain|Gabilliet|2004|p=109}}

=== Historical precedent and underpinnings for modernization in Brussels ===
The 1950s was not the first time that the city had been radically altered by major redevelopment. Two prior sweeping changes to the urban fabric of Brussels were the straight-lined central avenues modeled after [[Paris]], which were created by [[covering of the Senne|covering and diverting the Senne]] river, and the [[North–South connection|North–South railway connection]], which took around 40 years to finish (1911–52) and which had left swaths of the city center filled with debris and craters for decades. Another precedent is the erecting of the [[Palais de Justice, Brussels|Palace of Justice]], the largest building in the world constructed in the 1800s. [[André de Vries]] asserts that the penchant for heavy-handedness can be traced back to the reign of [[Leopold II of Belgium|Leopold II]] in the late 19th century, and possibly even all the way back to the [[bombardment of Brussels|bombardment of the city]] by [[Louis XIV]]'s troops in 1695. "There is barely one building still standing", he says, "from before 1695, with the exception of some churches and the Town Hall".{{sfn|De Vries|2003|p=14}}

Leopold II sought to give Brussels the image of a grand capital city of an imperial/colonial power. By the middle 20th century there was a tacit alliance between urban development entrepreneurs and local government, with a modernist agenda and with their sights set firmly on large-scale development projects. The citizens of Brussels were largely left out of the process.{{sfn|Swyngedouw|Moyersoen|2006|p=158}}

=== The 1990s: From Brusselization to façadism ===
[[File:Brusselisation in bucharest.jpg|thumb|250px|Brusselization in contemporary [[Bucharest]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}]]
In the early 1990s laws were introduced restricting the demolition of buildings that were deemed to have architectural or historical significance; and in 1999 the city authorities' urban development plan explicitly declared high-rise buildings to be architecturally incompatible with the existing aesthetics of the city centre.{{sfn|State|2004|p=51–52}}{{sfn|Stubbs|Makaš|2011|pp=120}} This led to the rise of what was termed ''{{lang|fr|[[facadism|façadisme]]}}'' — the destruction of the whole interior of a historic building while preserving its historic [[façade]].{{sfn|Hein|2004|p=264}}{{sfn|Stubbs|Makaš|2011|pp=121}}{{sfn|De Vries|2003|p=14}}

These laws were the Town Planning Act 1991, which gave local authorities the powers to refuse demolition requests on the grounds of historical, aesthetic, or cultural significance, and to designate architectural heritage zones; and the Heritage Conservation Act of 1993, which gave the government of the [[Brussels Capital Region]] the power to designate buildings to be protected for historic reasons. However, this system had its deficiencies. Whilst the Capital Region government could designate historic buildings, it was the nineteen municipal authorities within it that were responsible for demolition permits. Not until the introduction of a ''{{lang|fr|permis unique}}'' system was this internecine conflict resolved.{{sfn|Stubbs|Makaš|2011|pp=120}}

'''CALIPSO''' is a joint [[NASA]] (USA) and [[CNES]] (France) environmental satellite, built in the [[Cannes Mandelieu Space Center]], which was launched atop a [[Delta II]] rocket on April 28, 2006.  Its name stands for '''Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations'''.

Passive and active remote sensing Instruments on board the CALIPSO satellite monitor aerosols and clouds 24 hours a day. CALIPSO is part of the "[[A-train (satellite)|A Train]]", flying in formation with several other satellites ([[Aqua (satellite)|Aqua]], [[Aura (satellite)|Aura]] and [[CloudSat]]).

==Mission==
Three instruments:
* '''Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP)''' - a [[lidar]] that provides high-resolution vertical profiles of [[aerosol]]s and [[cloud]]s.
* '''Wide Field Camera (WFC)''' - a modified version of the commercial off-the-shelf [[Ball Aerospace]] [http://www.ballaerospace.com/page.jsp?page=104 CT-633] [[star tracker camera]]. It was selected to match band 1 of the [[MODIS]] instrument on the Aqua satellite.
* '''Imaging Infrared Radiometer (IIR)''' - used to detect [[cirrus cloud]] emissivity and particle size. The CALIOP laser beam is aligned with the center of the IIR image to optimize joint CALIOP/IIR observations.

In February 2009, CALIPSO switched over to the redundant laser as scheduled. The primary laser achieved its mission goal of three years of successful operation, and the redundant laser has been performing beyond expectations.

The CALIPSO mission was granted extended mission status in June 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-calipso.larc.nasa.gov/ |title=CALIPSO - INSTRUMENT UPDATE |publisher=NASA LARC |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316180550/http://www-calipso.larc.nasa.gov/ |archivedate=2010-03-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''CarbonFix Standard''' (CFS) is an initiative supported by over 60 organisations promotes the development of [[Afforestation|climate forestation]] projects to sequester [[carbon]] from the [[atmosphere]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The CarbonFix Standard is administered by CarbonFix, a non-profit association based in Germany.

The CarbonFix Standard has been favourably assessed in 2008, by the University of Canterbury, New Zealand and in 2009 by the Imperial College of London.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} CarbonPositive (2009) placed the CarbonFix Standard between the [[Voluntary Carbon Standard]] and the [[Climate, Community &amp; Biodiversity Alliance|CCB Standard]], "aiming for a best of both worlds approach".{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

==History==
The association CarbonFix was founded in 1999. In 2007, the association developed the first version of the CarbonFix Standard, which was presented at the [[World Climate Conference]] in [[Bali]], in December 2007. Since then, the standard has been revised several times.

==Structure==
The ''Terms'' section defines the technical wording used in the CarbonFix Standard.

The ''Criteria and Methodology'' section lists the criteria a project has to meet to become certified. Tree planting activities must take place on land which contained no forest before. Only projects which require the additional financial means from the sale of {{CO2}} credits will be certified. There must be [[Sustainable forest management|Sustainable Forest Management]]. [[CO2 fixation|{{CO2}}-Fixation]] is verified using  methodology based on the rules of the United Nations Climate Secretariat.

The ''Procedures'' of the CarbonFix Standard describes how to prepare project information and request [[certification]], how to sell  {{CO2}}-certificates, what fees CarbonFix charges and how {{CO2}}-certificates are placed into a carbon registry.

'''''Comparing Media Systems: Three Models of Media and Politics''''' (2004), by Daniel C. Hallin and Paolo Mancini, is a seminal study in the field of international comparative media system research. The study compares media systems of 18 Western [[democracies]] including nine Northern European countries ([[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, [[Sweden]], and [[Switzerland]]), five Southern European countries (France, [[Greece]], Italy, Portugal, and Spain) and four Atlantic countries (Canada, Great Britain, Ireland, and the United States).

The conceptual framework developed in this study turned out to be an important contribution&lt;ref&gt;Quotes for illustration:

„[T]his work, which is being acknowledged as a central text in an emerging subfield.” (Jones, 2008, p. 128)

“Comparing Media Systems is, indeed, a path-breaking volume that will serve as a model for today’s comparative communication analyses.” (Graber, 2006, p. 935)

“What is not open to speculation is the significance of this work. Hallin and Mancini’s pio-neering effort will define comparative media research for years to come.” (Patterson, 2007, p. 331)

“A major recent contribution to the comparative research tradition “ (Hardy, 2008, p. 17)

&lt;/ref&gt; to the field of the comparative media systems research because it provides a systematic and applicable approach to analyze differences and similarities of the relationships between [[media and politics]].

Since the publication of Hallin and Mancini’s book in 2004, there has been a vivid academic discussion ([[#Recent developments (Beyond the Western world)|Recent developments]]), particularly with regards to the adequacy of their suggested framework for understanding variations between different systems around the world, located within different cultural, social, and/or political contexts. As a consequence, a flourishing progression within the field of comparative media system research can be stated.

== Contextualization ==

=== Comparative media system research ===
The field of comparative media system research has a long tradition reaching back to the study ''Four Theories of the Press'' by Siebert, Peterson and Schramm from 1956. This book was the origin of the academic debate on comparing and classifying media systems,&lt;ref&gt;cf. Hardy (2008), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas it was normatively biased&lt;ref&gt;cf. Hardy (2008), p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt; and strongly influenced by the ideologies of the Cold War era.&lt;ref&gt;Siebert and his colleagues developed a normative classification of four ideal media systems: the libertarian, the social responsible, the Soviet Communist, and the authoritarian model. Consequently, the author’s typology referred to the then ideological segmentation of the world: a liberal democratic free world in the “West” (labeled the [[First World]]), a soviet-communist sphere (labeled the [[Second World]]), and authoritarian states (labeled the [[Third World]]) (cf. Hardy, 2008, p. 11).&lt;/ref&gt; Though this approach has often been criticized&lt;ref&gt;cf. Patterson (2007), p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g. because of its ethnocentricity, inconsistent structure, questionable typologies, or its scant empirical basis of the analysis&lt;ref&gt;cf. Hardy (2008), p. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;), it was a starting point for following normative media theories&lt;ref&gt;cf. Jackubowicz (2010), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;As Hardy (2008) and Jakubowicz (2010) point out, there were additional and modifying developments of the original typologies (e.g. by Denis McQuail (1987), Raymond Williams (1968), or Robert G. Picard (1985)) and alternative schemas as well, which moved further away from the original typologies (e.g. J. Herbert Altschull (1984)).&lt;/ref&gt; and the development of the field.

Comparative media system research has been subject to several changes since its establishment.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Jakubowicz (2010), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  The number of categories to describe media systems grew and approaches got more complex. Another trend is that researchers factor in political systems more intensively to explain and compare media systems. A more fundamental development is the shift from normative to empirically based approaches.

There are still problems of comparative media studies in various countries which must be faced. The validity of the country sampling procedure is one problem, beside the adequate definition of the scope of the comparison to meet the specific national features of the cases, and the definition of adequate indicators as the basis for the comparison.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Sparks (2006), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, the developed models are still relatively static not being able to describe changes adequately, and online media have been largely neglected though their importance has been increasing since the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Jakubowicz (2010), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, comparative media system studies are an important instrument for contemporary communication phenomena under study. The comparative design is a bridge between traditional and nation-centered studies of media systems and new media as well as globalization perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Hardy (2008), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;  Jakubowicz points out that contemporarily comparative media system analyses are seen as the key approach to understand globalization processes of the media.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Jakubowicz (2010), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Systematic classification of the approach ===
Comparative media system research is one possible approach to study transnational and border-crossing communication processes worldwide. A very useful and heuristic systematization of the vast field of transnational and border-crossing communication comes from Wessler and Brüggemann (2012)&lt;ref&gt;cf. Wessler &amp; Brüggemann (2012, in press).&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[Mediated cross-border communication#Dimensions of analysis|Dimensions of analysis]]). According to this heuristic, the approach from Hallin and Mancini can be identified and localized as one specific combination of the components along these three [[Mediated cross-border communication#Dimensions of analysis|dimensions of analysis]]. Their perspective of analysis is focused on a systematic comparison of media systems within Western democracies. Consequently, their level of analysis concentrates on media systems within the context of nation states. Their main objectives are media-politics relations primarily on the level of structures, but in addition to it, they consider all objects of analysis to gain an encompassing understanding of these relations.

== Objectives ==
Developing a unifying conceptual framework for comparing media systems was essential for Hallin and Mancini. They focused on theory building rather than testing theories, as the then prevailing ''Four Theories of the Press'' and its subsequent normative modifications showed deficiencies in adequately analyzing present media systems. Consequently, Hallin and Mancini focused on an empirical “by treating these systems not as abstract ideals but as concrete social formations that developed under particular historical conditions.”&lt;ref&gt;Hallin &amp; Mancini (2012a), p. 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;
Hallin and Mancini initially chose a “most similar systems”-design – that is, comparing systems which are quite similar according to their structures and functioning to understand in which aspects they differ from each other to discover specific characteristics of each single system. Following this design, they conceptualized dimensions containing particular variables to analyze similarities and differences between the 18 countries under study. Their objective was to find more or less coherent patterns within their sample which could possibly be condensed into [[ideal type]]s in terms of [[Max Weber]]’s conception of ideal types. Since the dimensions and the resulting models cover specifically the media-politics relations of the Western world, Hallin and Mancini do not claim universal [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of their framework. Hence, it must be reconceptualized to meet the specific conditions of media-politics relations beyond the Western world.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Hallin &amp; Mancini (2012b).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hallin and Mancini’s framework ==
Hallin and Mancini’s conceptual framework&lt;ref&gt;The dimensions that Hallin and Mancini use for their framework are originally not devised by them. They trace to then existing concepts (e.g. the dimension of [[political parallelism]] is initially developed by Seymour-Ure (1974)) but they “go beyond earlier scholars in amplifying these dimensions and exploring their linkages” (Patterson, 2007, p. 329).&lt;/ref&gt; consists of the [[#Dimensions: media systems|four dimensions]] ''structure of media markets'', ''[[political parallelism]]'', ''[[professionalization]] of [[journalism]]'', and the ''role of the state'' with regards to media systems; and of the [[#Dimensions: political context|five dimensions]] the ''role of the state'', ''type of democracy'' (consensus vs. majoritarian), ''type of pluralism'' (individual vs. organized), ''degree of rational-legal authority'', and ''degree of pluralism'' (moderate vs. polarized) with reference to the political contexts of media systems. According to specific constellations of the variables within these dimensions, Hallin and Mancini conceptualized [[#The three models of media and politics|the three models of media and politics]].

=== Dimensions: media systems ===

==== Structure of media markets&lt;ref&gt;cf. Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004), p. 22-26.&lt;/ref&gt; ====
The structure of media markets is concerned with the development of a [[mass media|mass press]]. The authors highlight several variables which can be used to describe the characteristics of [[newspaper|press systems]]: 
* [[newspaper circulation]] rates
* newspaper-readership relationship (elite- vs. mass-orientation)
* gender differences in newspaper reach
* relative importance of [[newspapers]] and [[television]] as sources of [[news]]
* ratio of local, regional, and national newspapers
* degree of a clear separation between [[sensationalism|sensationalist]] mass press and [[quality press]]
* regional or linguistic segmentation of media markets
* influence of bordering countries on the national media system

==== Political parallelism&lt;ref&gt;cf. Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004), p. 26-33.&lt;/ref&gt; ====
[[Political parallelism]] refers to the “fact that media in some countries have distinct political orientations, while media in other countries do not.”&lt;ref&gt;Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; The authors established 5 factors or indicators to assess the extent of [[political parallelism]]:
* the extent of political orientation within media content
* organizational connections between the media and political organizations
* the tendency of media personnel to take part in political life
* [[partisanship]] of media audiences
* [[Journalism|journalists’]] role orientation and practices (e.g. journalists as advocates vs. neutral arbiters, opinion-oriented vs. information-oriented reporting style, separating vs. blending commentary and information)
* internal pluralism (i.e. covering different opinions and perspectives within one medium) or external pluralism (i.e. covering different opinions and perspectives within one media branch (e.g. the [[newspaper|press system]]))
* the regulation of [[public service broadcasting]] (e.g. controlled by the government, insulated from direct political control, proportional representation of political parties or socially relevant groups)

==== Professionalization of journalism&lt;ref&gt;cf. Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004), p. 33-41.&lt;/ref&gt; ====
The [[professionalization]] refers to the continuum of independent to instrumentalized journalism:
* degree of [[autonomy]]
* development of distinct professional norms and rules (e.g. practical routines or ethical principles)
* public service orientation of the journalists (i.e. orientation towards an ethic of public service rather than towards interests of individual persons)

==== Role of the state&lt;ref&gt;cf. Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004), p. 41-44.&lt;/ref&gt; ====
This dimension stresses the power the political system has in shaping the structure and functioning of a media system. “But there are considerable differences in the extent of state [[interventionism (politics)|intervention]] as well as in the forms it takes.”&lt;ref&gt;Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Hallin and Mancini use the following variables to cover this fourth dimension:
* [[censorship]] or other types of political pressure
* endowment of the media with economic [[subsidies]]
* ownership of media- or telecommunication-organizations
* provision of regulations for the media ([[laws]], [[licensing]], etc.)
* the state as an information source and “primary definer” of news

Ultimately, the interrelations of these four dimensions are complex. They have to be assessed empirically for every new case under study. Consequently, they may “influence one another in important ways, but also vary independently.”&lt;ref&gt;Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dimensions: political context ===
In a next step, Hallin and Mancini identified five core dimensions to assess the political contexts of media systems. They took relevant concepts from the literatures on [[comparative politics]] and [[political sociology]] to gain a better understanding of the political influences on the development of media systems. The resulting dimensions are presented as [[dichotomies]], but they are just poles on a continuum.

The first dimension is the '''''role of the state'''''.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004), p. 49-50.&lt;/ref&gt; It is conceptualized by the distinction between ''[[liberal democracies]]'' and ''[[welfare state]] democracies''. The main difference between these two categories is the [[Economic interventionism|interventional]] activity of the state (e.g. [[funding]] vs. [[free market]]). This difference takes shape in the relative importance of [[private business]] or [[social institutions]] within the [[political system]] in question.

A further important dichotomic dimension is labeled '''''consensus vs. majoritarian democracy'''''.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004), p. 50-53.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Majoritarianism|Majoritarian]] democratic systems contain two dominating [[parties]] and, due to the [[plurality voting system]], the winning party actually concentrates the political power so that there is a clear distinction between the [[government]] and the [[Opposition (parliamentary)|opposition]]. Furthermore, the [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]] predominantly influences political decision processes. By contrast, the [[Consensus decision-making|consensus politics]] model encompasses a [[multi-party system]] which is based on the power sharing principle according to the proportional representation so that [[compromise]] and [[cooperation]] between the opposing forces are central. Additionally, there is a separation of power between [[legislative]] and [[Executive (government)|executive]].

The third dimension is the distinction between '''''individual and organized pluralism'''''&lt;ref&gt;cf. Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004), p. 53-55.&lt;/ref&gt; resp. '''''[[liberalism]]''''' and '''''[[corporatism]]'''''. Individual pluralism is defined as the organization of the political representation “in terms of the relation between governing institutions and individual citizens, along with a multiplicity of competing ‘special interests’”.&lt;ref&gt;Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the focus on organized social groups is more important within organized pluralism systems. Thus, corporatism includes the “formal integration of social groups into the political process”.&lt;ref&gt;Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hallin and Mancini identify the distinction between '''''[[rational-legal authority]] and [[clientelism]]'''''&lt;ref&gt;cf. Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004), p. 55-59.&lt;/ref&gt; as another crucial dimension. Following [[Max Weber]], Hallin and Mancini use the term [[rational-legal authority]] in its meaning as a form of governance whose main influence is maintained through formal and universalistic rules of procedure, i.e. an independent and autonomous administrative apparatus not affected by political and economic interests or [[lobbyism]]. This apparatus is the main institution of an efficient rational-legal system. In contrast, the orientation on common interests is much weaker within [[clientelism]] systems because individual interests and private relationships are the main forces maintaining the social organization. Consequently, “access to social resources is controlled by patrons and delivered to clients in exchange for deference and various forms of support”.&lt;ref&gt;Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004), p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

The final dimension is conceptualized by the distinction between '''''moderate and polarized pluralism'''''.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004), p. 59-61.&lt;/ref&gt; Low [[consensus]], challenged [[legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] of the [[political organizations]] or [[political system|system]], and deep cleavages within the political landscape are the main characteristics of polarized pluralism. An important indicator is the existence of anti-system parties and factions. Compared to this, moderate pluralism is mainly characterized by stronger tendencies toward the center, lower ideological differences between the [[political parties]], greater acceptance of the [[political system]], and better chances to gain [[consensus]] during political controversies.

=== The three models of media and politics ===
By using the aforementioned dimensions, Hallin and Mancini deduced and conceptualized three [[ideal type|ideal models]] of media-politics relations (‘ideal’ according to [[Max Weber]]). Hallin and Mancini could identify specific patterns by geographical regions which were crucial for labeling the individual models:

==== The Three Models: Media System Characteristics&lt;ref&gt;cf. Table 4.1 ''The Three Models: Media System Characteristics'' (Hallin &amp; Mancini, 2004, p. 67).&lt;/ref&gt; ====

Controlled deregulation refers to the establishment of media policies by the political system, e.g. the implementation of formal licensing procedures for commercial broadcasting. Savage deregulation relates to the failure of the political system to impose such media policies. Consequently, the media corporations defined the regulation of the broadcasting market. Additionally, Traquina (1995) points out that the competition among broadcasters ends in a mainstream orientation and less diversity concerning media contents.&lt;/ref&gt; (except France) || strong state intervention but with protection for press freedom; press subsidies, particularly strong in Scandinavia; strong public-service broadcasting || market dominated (except strong public broadcasting in Britain and Ireland)

=== Restrictions ===
Hallin and Mancini point to restrictions&lt;ref&gt;cf. Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004), p. 66-73.&lt;/ref&gt; of their three models which have to be considered in order not to overvalue the [[Validity (logic)|validity]] and [[Importance|significance]] of them. First of all, they focus on [[nation states]] and this [[level of analysis]] allows a specific perspective on media-politics relations but misses other phenomena of importance (e.g. transnational developments of media markets in Europe). Another concern is that the cases summarized within the single models vary enormously (especially within the Liberal model). Consequently, the models show a wide range of cases which might blur their distinction. Furthermore, the media systems within the analyzed countries might not be [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|homogeneous]] (e.g. the structural differences between the print system and the broadcasting system in Germany). Because of the differences within the countries and the interferences between them, it is difficult to treat the 18 countries analyzed, as single cases because they depend on each other and influence each other. A final point is the dynamic of media systems because they cannot be assumed as static entities. Hence, media systems will always progress and there will always be changes resulting from those developing processes, so that reconsidering the characteristics of the mentioned models becomes necessary over time.
Consequently, Hallin and Mancini point out in subsequent discussions that their models are not intended to be universal typologies which can be applied to other cases mechanically.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Hallin &amp; Mancini (2010), p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;cf. Hallin &amp; Mancini (2012a), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;cf. Hallin &amp; Mancini (2012b), p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, they suggest rather focusing on the dimensions and their applicability and adaption to analyze other media systems adequately – e.g. regarding [[Eastern European]] media systems, they propose to attach more weight to the [[#Role of the state|role of the state]] and especially to the role of [[civil society]] to understand these systems appropriately.

=== The convergence-thesis ===
At the end of their book,&lt;ref&gt;Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004), p. 251-295.&lt;/ref&gt; Hallin and Mancini discuss the convergence- or homogenization-thesis. The basis for their argument is their observation of several [[Transformation processes (media systems)|transformation processes]] that take place especially in Europe. The most important processes are the [[European integration]], politically as well as with regards to the media (e.g. [[Institute for Information, Telecommunication and Media Law|European media laws]]), the decline of traditional political mass [[parties]], the American influence on the [[professionalization]] of [[journalism]], and finally the [[commercialization]] of the media markets in Europe. These are the main reasons why Hallin and Mancini conclude, that the European countries might be pushed toward the ''Liberal model''. They even go one step further and hypothesize that the core forces of that homogenization- or convergence-process might be valid for other parts of the world. However, they point out that there might be limitations to this process as well because the elements of the process are anchored in the structural differences between the [[political systems]] around the world.

== Recent developments (Beyond the Western world) ==
In this section, some recent issues and topics are mentioned because they arose from an ongoing scholar discussion about the applicability of Hallin and Mancini’s framework to other, especially non-Western countries:
* Some researchers reflect upon the nature of the Polarized Pluralist model and its alleged applicability for many media systems beyond the Western world, for it seems to be a catch-all residual model.&lt;ref&gt;Summary of argumentation in: Hallin &amp; Mancini (2012b), p. 279-280.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A related issue is the question whether the Polarized Pluralist model involves negative normative implications (compared to the other two models) what would turn it into an inferior or less-well developed model.&lt;ref&gt;Summary of argumentation in: Hallin &amp; Mancini (2012b), p. 279-284.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Many researchers challenge the convergence-thesis because they identify serious differences between the cases they study and those Hallin and Mancini focused on, so that they conclude that globalization will rather result in hybridization- than in convergence-processes.&lt;ref&gt;Summary of argumentation in: Hallin &amp; Mancini (2012b), p. 284-287.&lt;/ref&gt; Concerning Western media systems, Hardy for example notes to include matters of ownership concentration and cultural processes to clarify and meet the complexity of convergence-processes.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Hardy (2008), p. 231-232.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A related point is the total exclusion of influential new online technologies and media which are of central importance for understanding transformations of media systems as well as the communication patterns within, between and beyond them.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Jackubowicz (2010), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Hardy criticizes the neglect of all forms of entertainment media.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Hardy (2008), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;
* One of the main debates is about the extent to which the variables Hallin and Mancini use to measure the dimensions must be adapted to non-Western cases to meet their particular conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Summary of argumentation in: Hallin &amp; Mancini (2012b), p. 287-299.&lt;/ref&gt; Others criticize Hallin and Mancini’s concentration on media-politics relations because this perspective neglects interrelated variables, e.g. economic or cultural contexts.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Jackubowicz (2010), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Concerning transnational and global developments, relations and influences around the world, some researches ask the question whether the nation state as a level of analysis is still appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;Summary of argumentation in: Hallin &amp; Mancini (2012b), p. 299-300.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Jakubowicz argues that this ''methodological nationalism'' (cf. Mihelj et al., 2008) is inappropriate, for “media systems are no longer exclusively related to single political systems”,&lt;ref&gt;Jackubowicz (2010), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas Hardy notes that “[t]he political, legislative, cultural and social dimensions of the state are not simply diminished by globalisation”&lt;ref&gt;Hardy (2008), p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; and that “communication systems remain, to a significant degree, national in organization and orientation.”&lt;ref&gt;Hardy (2008), p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A related debate is about the adequacy of focusing on structures and systems, as Hallin and Mancini did it, rather than considering more dynamic agencies and processes which cannot be covered entirely by a system-approach.&lt;ref&gt;Summary of argumentation in: Hallin &amp; Mancini (2012b), p. 301-304.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;cf. Jackubowicz (2010), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Hallin and Mancini decided to use a model- or ideal types-approach to explain certain patterns of their cases. Other researchers remark on the risk of generalizing and abstracting too early within the research process.&lt;ref&gt;Summary of argumentation in: Hallin &amp; Mancini (2012b), p. 300-301.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This vivid discussion reflects the status of Hallin and Mancini’s approach, as it is currently “the most well-developed analytical framework so far for understanding the relationship between media and political systems.”&lt;ref&gt;Hardy (2008), p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, there are many studies that apply and adapt the framework for their cases under study.

For example, Dobek-Ostrowska and colleagues published the edited volume ''Comparative Media Systems. European and Global Perspectiv''e (2010)&lt;ref&gt;Dobek-Ostrowska, B., Glowacki, M., Jakubowicz, K., &amp; Sükösd, M. (2010). ''Comparative Media Systems. European and Global Perspective''. Budapest: CEU Press.&lt;/ref&gt; which contains comparative studies referring to or applying Hallin and Mancini’s framework for Central and [[Eastern Europe]] media systems. Hallin and Mancini published the edited volume ''Comparing Media Systems Beyond the Western World'' (2012)&lt;ref&gt;Hallin, D. C., &amp; Mancini, P. (2012). ''Comparing Media Systems Beyond the Western World''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; which gives a comprehensive overview with a more global perspective. Case studies from the media systems of [[Israel]], Poland, [[Baltic states]], [[Brazil]], South Africa, Russia, China, and the [[Arab world]] are discussed by the contributors and a methodological reflection of Hallin and Mancini’s framework with regards to non-Western media systems is added.

Further research was conducted by Jonathan Hardy, who analyzed the implications of [[Transformation processes (media systems)|transformation processes]] shaping contemporary media systems. As Hallin and Mancini did, Hardy focuses on media systems within Western democracies (actually 18 countries) and he adjoins their convergence thesis while he concentrates on [[printing|print]] and [[broadcasting]] (especially [[TV]]).&lt;ref&gt;cf. Hardy (2008), p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt; He chooses four [[paradigms]] (namely the [[liberal democratic]] theory, [[neoliberalism]], [[libertarianism]], and the critical [[political economy]]) as an analytical framework to examine relationships between [[media (communication)|media]] and [[politics]], media and [[policy]], [[media ownership]] and [[transnationalism|transnationalisation]] processes.

Furthermore, Roger Blum’s approach (2005) is an attempt to broaden and complete Hallin and Mancini’s models by adding and modifying dimensions (he developed nine instead of four dimensions), classifying them as liberal, regulated, or as in between these two poles. Blum identifies six models of media systems,&lt;ref&gt;For a summary, cf. Jakubowicz (2010), p. 4-6.&lt;/ref&gt; but he does “not explain how he created the models and why no other combination of specification is necessary”,&lt;ref&gt;Jakubowicz (2010), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; so Blum’s framework is still in need for empirical support.

Other studies focus on a single aspect of Hallin and Mancini’s framework and analyze it in detail. For example, Curran and his colleagues (2009) study the implications of the movement towards rather market-driven media and compare [[news|news contents]] and public knowledge of public affairs within different media systems by testing the [[hypothesis]], “that market-based systems (…) impede the exercise of informed [[citizenship]].”&lt;ref&gt;Curran et al. (2009), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
There were also several conferences “triggered” by Hallin and Mancini’s framework; for example the ''International Media and Communication Conference “Comparing Media Systems: West Meets East”'' organized by the Department of Communication and Journalism at the [[University of Wroclaw]] (April 23–25, 2007), where more than 100 researchers attained&lt;ref&gt;cf. Dobek-Ostrowska et al. (2010), p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt; or conferences initiated by Hallin and Mancini themselves in [[Perugia]] in 2007, and in [[San Diego]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Hallin &amp; Mancini (2012a), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparative media system research is an encouraging and important subfield of [[mediated cross-border communication]]. And Hallin and Mancini’s framework has been contributing to its consolidation and progression.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Patterson (2007), p. 331.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18129">The '''conservation and restoration of papyrus''' material is an activity dedicated to the preservation and protection of objects of historical and personal value made from [[papyrus]] from Ancient Egypt.

== Overview ==

{{Main article|Papyrus}}
Papyrus was used in the making of writing material in ancient Egypt, where it was used from ancient times until the 10th century CE. The species of papyrus used in the creation of the writing materials is [[Cyperus papyrus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leach|first1=Bridget|last2=Tait|first2=John|editor1-last=Redford|editor1-first=Donald B.|title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt Vol. 3|date=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=2 April 2017|chapter=Papyrus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Storage for papyrus materials==

There are various methods to safely store papyrus collections. However, the storage conditions do not change.

=== Conditions ===

It is important to store papyri within a climate-controlled room in which the temperature and humidity are maintained at a constant level of 17-23 degrees Celsius and 50-60 percent, respectively. It is also important to place a special kind of film or glass which protects the cases holding the papyri from UV lights, which could make papyri fade away if they are exposed to these lights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frösén|first1=Jaakko|editor1-last=Bagnell|editor1-first=Roger S.|title=The Oxford Handbook of Papyrology|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=86|chapter=Conservation of Ancient Papyrus Materials}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Methods ===

There are various methods for storing papyri. The first and most common of these is to use two frames of glass and seal the edges with cloth tape. However, this method presents many risks to the object. One of these risks is this method opens the door for the object to be in contact with heat and moisture, which would also make the object's surface to stick to the glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stanley|first1=Ted|title=Papyrus Storage at Princeton University|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/v13/bp13-10.html|accessdate=5 April 2017|date=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another method is using the Stabiltex Sling System, which is a much safer method to store papyrus fragments. This storage method consists the use of a double-windowed mat with two sheets of Stabiltex covering the object. A third method for storing papyri, especially for oversized papyri, is placing the papyrus between two layers of plexiglass and then securing them with an aluminum frame cut to the size to support the piece.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lau-Lamb|first1=Leyla|title=ADVANCED PAPYROLOGICAL INFORMATION SYSTEM Guidelines for Conservation of Papyrus|url=https://www.lib.umich.edu/papyrus-collection/advanced-papyrological-information-system|accessdate=6 April 2017|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Threats ===
Papyrus collections face threats to their well-being. These threats range from biological in nature to man-made.

==== Insects and other biological threats ====
Insects have been known to damage papyri. The damage takes place when the papyrus is rolled. In ancient times, a material called cedrium was used. Cedrium is a resinous extract from juniper, which stopped bookworms from attacking papyrus scrolls.&lt;ref name=Leach2000-240&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leach|first1=Bridget|last2=Tait|first2=John|editor1-last=Nichlson|editor1-first=Paul T.|editor2-last=Shaw|editor2-first=Ian|title=Ancient Egyptian Materials and Technology|date=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=240|chapter=Papyrus}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cedar oil was also used to stop bookworms in ancient times.&lt;ref name=Frösén2009-83&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frösén|first1=Jaakko|editor1-last=Bagnell|editor1-first=Roger S.|title=The Oxford Handbook of Papyrology|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=83|chapter=Conservation of Ancient Papyrus Materials}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also certain species of fungi which specifically attack papyri.&lt;ref name=Leach2000-240/&gt; As organic materials, papyri are also susceptible to mold.&lt;ref name=Leach2000-238&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leach|first1=Bridget|last2=Tait|first2=John|editor1-last=Nichlson|editor1-first=Paul T.|editor2-last=Shaw|editor2-first=Ian|title=Ancient Egyptian Materials and Technology|date=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=238|chapter=Papyrus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Deterioration ====
A common threat to papyrus materials is deterioration. This threat has been occurring both in ancient and modern times. In ancient times, deterioration occurred when the papyrus was used extensively, which is especially the case for medical papyri and other papyri of a similar nature. In modern times, deterioration in papyri occurs from a long process of ageing, the breaking down of the components of the papyrus as well as the conditions where the papyrus is stored/found. Another cause for deterioration among papyri is oxidation, which occurs from the use of iron-gall ink, which contains iron sulphate, which has been known to damage papyri.&lt;ref name=Leach2000-238/&gt;

====Salts ====
Salts, if accumulated on a papyrus scroll, could potentially damage it. A papyrus scroll can be contaminated with salts from the site where it was found, which is especially the case for areas with a high degree of moisture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leach|first1=Bridget|last2=Tait|first2=John|editor1-last=Nichlson|editor1-first=Paul T.|editor2-last=Shaw|editor2-first=Ian|title=Ancient Egyptian Materials and Technology|date=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=242|chapter=Papyrus}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, salt on papyri can also occur in stable environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lau-Lamb|first1=Leyla|title=ADVANCED PAPYROLOGICAL INFORMATION SYSTEM Guidelines for Conservation of Papyrus|url=https://www.lib.umich.edu/papyrus-collection/advanced-papyrological-information-system|accessdate=16 April 2017|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Methods of storage ====
Methods of storage, if done incorrectly, can also damage papyri. The traditional method in papyrus storage was to place the papyri between two sheets of glass and then seal the edges with cloth tape. This threatens the papyrus inside since it allows the object to come into direct contact with the glass, which could cause heat and moisture to come into contact with the papyrus. This could make the papyrus stick to the glass. This could also damage the ink and the surface of the papyrus when the glass is removed. A grayish material, which has been identified as a composite of sodium chloride and traces of vegetable carbohydrates, was seen around the edges of some papyri. Other storage methods which use cellulose nitrate, paper backing, drumming techniques, hinges, adhesive mounts, dry mount systems and plexiglass which presses directly on the papyrus are not considered safe methods of storage. The threats from these include introducing materials which could stain the artifact, degrading the object or placing pressure on the object. These effects are also not easily reversed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stanley|first1=Ted|title=Papyrus Storage at Princeton University|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/v13/bp13-10.html|accessdate=14 April 2017|date=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Restoration methods ===
Restoring papyri has been around since ancient times. Across the centuries, more modern methods have been used. In this section, both ancient and modern techniques for restoring papyri will be examined.

==== Ancient methods ====
Restoring damaged papyri has been going on since ancient times. Indeed, one method that seems to have been used then was to add fresh strips of papyrus to the papyrus scroll. An example of this is seen with the [[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus]].&lt;ref name=Leach2000-240/&gt; [[File:Rhind_Mathematical_Papyrus.jpg|thumb|This images shows part of the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus. The bright sections of the papyrus seem to show parts which would have been restored in ancient times using fresh strips of papyrus]]

==== Modern methods for conserving and restoring papyri====
Papyri can be restored using various methods in modern times. These methods differ based on the condition of the papyrus.

===== Preparation of a papyrus for conservation =====
There are several steps that need to be taken before restoring a papyrus. The first step is to first remove any remaining soil and dirt particles on the papyrus piece. After this, the next step is to document the papyrus scroll as accurately as possible. This step is especially important if the papyrus is in fragments.&lt;ref name=Frösén2009-81-82&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frösén|first1=Jaakko|editor1-last=Bagnell|editor1-first=Roger S.|title=The Oxford Handbook of Papyrology|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=81–82|chapter=Conservation of Ancient Papyrus Materials}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, the ink on the papyrus should be examined by pouring an eye drop of water onto the papyrus itself. This step is repeated using either ethanol or an ethanol/water mixture.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Old repairs and tape can also damage a papyrus piece, so it is crucial that these are removed. One method of removing these is to first dampen the papyrus itself so the old tapes can be removed safely.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; [[File:Papyrus PSI 1292 - Papyrus 13, P. Oxy.

===== Restoring a papyrus =====
There are various methods which are used to restore damaged papyri, which may depend on the type of the damage on the papyrus. For example, if the ink on the papyrus has been damaged, then a very thin methyl cellulose or wheat starch paste is to be applied beneath the papyrus via a fine sable brush.&lt;ref name=Frösén2009-81-82/&gt; If there is a mold attack, then a method which seems to work is to remove the mold via a spatula and then brush the contaminated area with a solution that is 50% water and 50% ethanol.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Sometimes, a cellulose solution, which can be either Klucel or Hydroxypropyl Celluloid, is used to strengthen cell tissue and the vascular bundles. Other materials such as papyrus juice and gum arabic can be used for the same reason as the cellulose solutions.&lt;ref name=Frösén2009-83/&gt; A method that is used to treat papyri is to clean repeatedly. This is achieved by first placing the papyrus on dry blotting paper, and then cleaning the papyrus by removing the dirt via a scalpel, spatula or dry tweezers. Mechanical cleaning of the papyrus can also be done, after placing the papyrus on the dry blotting paper, via the use of a bristle brush to lightly brush the papyrus. A damp papyrus must be placed under a light weight to dry. These cleaning methods can be used repeatedly until the papyrus is fully treated.&lt;ref name=Frösén2009-83/&gt; After restoring the papyrus, tweezers can be used to align papyrus fragments in place. Then, the papyrus is remounted using either the Stabiltex Sling system or the Polyester Sling system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stanley|first1=Ted|title=Papyrus Storage at Princeton University|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/v13/bp13-10.html|accessdate=6 April 2017|date=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Restoring recycled papyri ====
In ancient times, used papyri were often used in the creation of cartonnage coffins. The papyri used in the creation of these coffins were cut or torn and then dampened with water so they can fit into the [[cartonnage]] piece in which they were placed. Then, they were stuck together with either plaster or glue. A layer of lime gesso plaster was used on both sides of the papyrus.&lt;ref name=Frösén2009-87&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frösén|first1=Jaakko|editor1-last=Bagnell|editor1-first=Roger S.|title=The Oxford Handbook of Papyrology|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=87|chapter=Conservation of Ancient Papyrus Materials}}&lt;/ref&gt; An image of the deceased was often painted on the front of the cartonnage.&lt;ref name= Frösén2009-87/&gt; To conserve the paintings and the papyri within, any loose dirt is to be removed and the painted surface cleaned with acetone. If there are any holes in the painted gesso, then calcium carbonate is used to block these holes. The paint layer is fixed with Paraloid B-48, which contains 30 percent acetone. The layer of paint is faced with a temporary piece of cartonnage using: (a) one layer of Japanese tissue paper (about 50 grams) &amp; Paraloid B-48/acetone emulsion (20 percent), (b) two layers of Japanese paper (about 70 grams) and a Planatol BB/water dilution (40 percent), (c) one layer of linen cloth and a Planatol BB/water dilution (40 percent) and one layer of Japanese paper (about 70 grams) and a Planatol BB/water emulsion (40 percent). The negative form of the object is then placed in either fluid polyurethane (if the object is three-dimensional) or water (60 degrees Celsius). To remove the inner layer of gesso, it is dampened in water and then removed with a brush. Then the papyrus cartonnage is removed from behind with a scalpel. To loosen the pieces of papyrus within, the cartonnage is placed in a hot water bath (90 degrees Celsius) for a few minutes. Acid is then placed in the water to help in loosening the pieces of papyrus in the gesso. After this, the papyrus pieces are de-acidified. The papyri are then separated mechanically with tweezers and scalpel. Using blotting paper, the papyri fragments are dried via sheets of blotting paper. Using Paraloid B-48 (20 percent in acetone), the painting and its gesso layer are consolidated from the back. The object is then backed by a new cartonnage support consisting of Japanese paper (70-90 grams), linen cloth and a Planatol BB/water dilution (40 percent). The negative form of the third-dimensional object is removed mechanically. The temporary-facing support is removed with tweezers and brush by using acetone. Using a brush and acetone, the painted surface is cleaned. The dry papyri are cleaned with a brush. Using a brush, tweezers and palette knives, the papyrus fragments are cleaned by sandwiching them between pieces of wet cloth or blotting paper. This will mark the final removal of any remaining gesso pieces. The papyrus fragments are dried between sheets of blotting paper while under pressure. Then the papyrus fragments are stored between glass plates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frösén|first1=Jaakko|editor1-last=Bagnell|editor1-first=Roger S.|title=The Oxford Handbook of Papyrology|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=88–90|chapter=Conservation of Ancient Papyrus Materials}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Restoring carbonized papyri ====
Carbonized papyri are papyri that have been charred. There seems to be one method for restoring charred papyri. The first step of this method is to carefully separate the layers of the papyrus since they cannot be unrolled due to their condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frösén|first1=Jaakko|editor1-last=Bagnell|editor1-first=Roger S.|title=The Oxford Handbook of Papyrology|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=91|chapter=Conservation of Ancient Papyrus Materials}}&lt;/ref&gt; This separation is done with either a thin palette knife or a scraper and lifting them with tweezers. Sometimes, dampening the layers is done to speed up the process of separation.&lt;ref name= Frösén2009-96&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frösén|first1=Jaakko|editor1-last=Bagnell|editor1-first=Roger S.|title=The Oxford Handbook of Papyrology|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=96|chapter=Conservation of Ancient Papyrus Materials}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the event that the pieces are very fragile, Japanese paper is used to loosen and lift the layers, but only if the back of the papyrus does not contain any writing. Another method is to use a dilution of water and glue to fix the layers from the back.&lt;ref name= Frösén2009-96/&gt; After separating the layers one by one, the pieces in the individual layer are placed together according to the writing on the front of the papyrus. Then the layer is turned over in order to stabilize it from the back, which can be only achieved if the back of the papyrus is  does not have any writings. If this is the case, then the pieces cannot be consolidated, unless they are between the inscribed lines. However, this latter process is done only sometimes and with extreme care.&lt;ref name= Frösén2009-96/&gt; A great method of reconstructing a layer of carbonized papyri is to use [[Japanese tissue|Japanese Tissue paper]] and a sheet of glass, on which to place the layer. Then a layer of wax paper or plastic paper is placed over the whole reconstruction and then cover that with a glass plate.&lt;ref name= Frösén2009-96/&gt; This step is done to ease the process of turning the papyrus layers over. Through the use of a thin paintbrush and letting the glass plate slide step-by-step, the carbonized layer is strengthened by carefully applying the diluted adhesive through the Japaneses paper from the back. To avoid air bubbles, the whole back must be glued. It is also important not to let the adhesive seep into the papyrus since this will form a reflective surface on the front of the papyrus, which will render the ink on the front of the papyrus invisible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frösén|first1=Jaakko|editor1-last=Bagnell|editor1-first=Roger S.|title=The Oxford Handbook of Papyrology|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=96–97|chapter=Conservation of Ancient Papyrus Materials}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reinforced papyrus can be turned over by grasping the Japanese paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frösén|first1=Jaakko|editor1-last=Bagnell|editor1-first=Roger S.|title=The Oxford Handbook of Papyrology|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=97|chapter=Conservation of Ancient Papyrus Materials}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Credo ut intelligam''''' (alternatively spelled '''''Credo ut intellegam''''') is [[Latin]] for "I believe so that I may understand" and is a maxim of [[Anselm of Canterbury]] (''Proslogion'', 1), which is based on a saying of [[Augustine of Hippo]] (''crede, ut intelligas'', "believe so that you may understand"; ''Tract. Ev. Jo.'', 29.6) to relate [[faith]] and [[reason]]. In Anselm's writing, it is placed in juxtaposition to its converse, ''intellego ut credam'' ("I think so that I may believe"), when he says ''Neque enim quaero intelligere ut credam, sed credo ut intelligam'' ("I do not seek to understand in order that I may believe, but rather, I believe in order that I may understand"). It is often associated with Anselm's other famous phrase ''[[fides quaerens intellectum]]'' ("faith seeking understanding").
Augustine understood the saying to mean that we must believe in something in order to know anything about God.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald H. Nash|Nash, Ronald H.]],"Faith and Reason," p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;  

The term has been used pejoratively to describe uncritical acceptance of questionable concepts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Raymond Tallis|Tallis, Raymond]], "The Shrink from Hell", ''The Times Higher Education Supplement'' October 1997 p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5563">'''Deep social mind''' is a concept in evolutionary psychology; it refers to the distinctively human capacity to 'read' (that is, to infer) the mental states of others while reciprocally enabling those others to read one's own mental states at the same time. The term 'deep social mind' was first coined in 1999 by Andrew Whiten, professor of Evolutionary and Developmental Psychology at [[St. Andrews University]], Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Whiten, A. 1999. The evolution of deep social mind in humans. In [[Michael Corballis|M. Corballis]] and S. E. G. Lea (eds), ''The Descent of Mind. Psychological perspectives on hominid evolution.'' Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]], pp. 173-193.&lt;/ref&gt; Together with closely related terms such as '[[reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]]' and '[[intersubjectivity]]', it is now well-established among scholars investigating the evolutionary emergence of human sociality, cognition and communication.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, C. and C. Power (2012). [http://www.chrisknight.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/Knight-Power-Social-Conditions1.pdf Social conditions for the evolutionary emergence of language.] In M. Tallerman and K. Gibson (eds), ''Handbook of Language Evolution.'' Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]], pp. 346-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mindreading in apes and humans==

It is widely agreed that the brain is social in both human and nonhuman primates.&lt;ref&gt;Dunbar, R. I. M. 1998. The social brain hypothesis. ''[[Evolutionary Anthropology (journal)|Evolutionary Anthropology]]'' 6: 178-91.&lt;/ref&gt; But, according to Andrew Whiten, human sociality goes much further than [[ape sociality]]. Ape social intelligence is overwhelmingly '[[Machiavellian]]' in the sense of scheming, self-interested and egotistically calculating.&lt;ref&gt;Whiten, A. and R. W. Byrne 1988. The manipulation of attention in primate tactical deception. In R. Byrne and A. Whiten (eds), ''Machiavellian Intelligence: Social expertise and the evolution of intellect in monkeys, apes, and humans.'' Oxford: [[Clarendon Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

One consequence is that while an ape may be motivated to 'read' (that is, to infer) the mental states of others around it, it has little motive to reciprocate. Instead of making its own mental states transparent to potential rivals, it seeks to block others from 'reading' its own mind. For example, one way to infer what another primate might be thinking is to detect which way its head is pointed, so as to reconstruct what it might be looking at. In the case of [[gorillas]] and [[chimpanzees]], adult apes have evolved eyes which give away very little information concerning direction of gaze. Their [[eyes]] are dark-on-dark: the iris is dark brown or even black and the same applies to the [[sclera]] and surrounding skin. Looking at the eyes, therefore, it is not easy to detect direction of [[gaze (physiology)|gaze]]. In the human case, the eyes are very different, the dark iris standing out against a white surrounding sclera. This feature, combined with the relatively large size of the [[human eye]] and its horizontally elongated shape, assists neighbouring conspecifics to detect direction of gaze and, on that basis, engage in mind-reading.&lt;ref&gt;Kobayashi, H., and S. Kohshima (2001). ‘Unique Morphology of the Human Eye and Its Adaptive Meaning: Comparative Studies on External Morphology of the Primate Eye.’ ''[[Journal of Human Evolution]]'', 40 (5): 419-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 'Deep Social Mind' theory, this means that humans have become cognitively adapted to [[reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]] and [[intersubjectivity]]: as a species, we are well-adapted to read the minds of trusted others while at the same time assisting those others in reading our own minds. One consequence of this is [[self-awareness]] or 'egocentric perspective reversal': I read your mind as you are reading mine. Therefore, between us, we can gain an awareness of our own minds as if from the outside: my mental states as these are reflected in yours and yours as they are reflected in mine. In that sense, if this argument is accepted, our minds mutually interpenetrate. 'Mind' in the human sense is not locked inside this or that skull but instead is relational, stretching between us.&lt;ref&gt;Whiten, A. 1999. The evolution of deep social mind in humans. In M. Corballis and S. E. G. Lea (eds), ''The Descent of Mind. Psychological perspectives on hominid evolution.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 173-193.&lt;/ref&gt; According to evolutionary psychologist [[Michael Tomasello]], a [[human child]] normally achieves egocentric perspective reversal — viewing its own mental states as if from the standpoint of others — at around one year of age.&lt;ref&gt;M. Tomasello (2000).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8836">[[File:Deyrolle, 46 Rue du Bac, 75007 Paris 2013.jpg|thumb]]
During the 20th century, '''Deyrolle''' was a Parisian institution for [[natural science]]s and [[pedagogy]]. It is one of the best known companies of [[entomology]] and [[taxidermy]] of [[Paris]]. Today, Deyrolle is a shop and a [[cabinet of curiosities]] open to the public, a reference in the field of taxidermy, entomology and natural sciences, whose vocation is to show the beauty of Nature. Deyrolle is also involved in pedagogy and art.

== History ==

=== Since 1831 ===
Deyrolle was created in 1831 by '''Jean-Baptiste Deyrolle''', who was soon succeeded by his son [[Achille Deyrolle|Achille]], at 46 rue du Bac in a building constructed in 1697-1699 by Jean-Baptiste Voille for a member of the Bruand family (Libéral Bruand). It was deeply transformed in 1739 by Samuel-Jacques Bernard, son of the banker of Louis XIV, Samuel Bernard (7&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; arrondissement). Beyond its scientific material, minerals collections, seashells, fossils, mounted animals and prehistoric tools, Deyrolle provides pedagogical charts to schools and universities in France, made to illustrate teacher’s lessons. (''Musée scolaire Deyrolle'').

In 2001 Louis Albert de Broglie bought Deyrolle and he restored the shop.

=== The fire of 2008 ===
On February the 1st 2008, the [[Cabinet of curiosities|Cabinet of Curiosities]] was destroyed by a big fire. The cause was probably a short-circuit. A big part of the rooms and of the collections has been destroyed: butterflies, insects, and animals (zebras, alligators, gazelles, bears, lions, shellfish and turtles). On May the 15th 2008, the building was already cleaned and the two rooms of the first floor reopened.

Some artists that contributed to save Deyrolle:

[[Jan Fabre]] - [[Nan Goldin]] - [[Jacques Grange]] - [[Karen Knorr]] - [[Marie-Jo Lafontaine]] - Claude Lalanne - [[Les Lalanne|François-Xavier Lalanne]] - [[Pierre Alechinsky]] - [[Yann Arthus-Bertrand]] - [[Miquel Barceló|Miquel Barcelo]] - Pascal Bernier - Laurent Bochet - [[Sophie Calle]] - [[Johan Creten]] - Marc Dantan - Nicolas Darrot - [[Mark Dion]] - [[Bettina Rheims]] - [[Bernar Venet]] - [[Huang Yong Ping]].

== Pedagogy ==

=== The ancient charts ===
Deyrolle is well known for its '''pedagogical charts'''. It all starts around 1871, when [[Émile Deyrolle|Emile Deyrolle]] developed everything that concerns the educational material, anatomical models in staff, biology pieces, and most of all, the creation of coloured wall charts, published under the name "Musée scolaire Deyrolle". They are meant to teach the "Leçons de choses" ("Lessons of things") but also [[Botany]], [[Zoology]], [[Entomology]], [[Geography]], [[Anatomy]], [[Civics]], [[Physics]], [[Chemistry]], [[Geology]], [[Mineralogy]], [[Biology]], etc.

« ''Visual instruction is the least tiring for the mind, but this education can have good results only if the ideas engraved in the children’s mind are rigorously exact.'' » [[Émile Deyrolle]]

=== Deyrolle pour l'Avenir ===
In 2007, Louis Albert de Broglie restarts the publishing activity with the creation of new educational charts, to tackle contemporary environmental and societal issues. It is the start of a new collection of educational charts published under the name of Deyrolle pour l’Avenir (DPA). There are charts on [[sustainable development]], [[climate change]]s, [[endangered species]], [[renewable energy]], etc.

== The savoir-faire ==

=== Taxidermy ===
Deyrolle is a reference in the field of taxidermy. We can find birds, beasts and mammals from all over the world. At Deyrolle, with only a few exceptions, no animal was killed to be mounted: the non-domestic species come from zoos, parks, where they died of old age or illness. They are traceable, and protected species are held and delivered in accordance with the [[CITES|Washington Convention (CITES)]].

=== Entomology ===
Deyrolle is also known for its entomological collections. The drawers of the entomological room are filled with colourful butterflies, beetles, and other insects. It is possible to see the experts of the entomology team working on the mounting of insects.

== Art ==
The first aim of Deyrolle was to teach [[natural science]]s to children and students, but Deyrolle was a point of interest also for artists: the surrealists [[André Breton]] and [[Salvador Dalí]], the painters [[Jean Dubuffet]] and Mathieu, the writers [[Louise Lévêque de Vilmorin|Louise de Vilmorin]] and [[Théodore Monod]], [[Raymond Queneau]] and many others stopped regularly at the shop.

=== Deyrolle and artists today ===
Today, Deyrolle continues its proximity with artists and the shop welcomes a lot of exhibitions and events during the year: [[Bettina Rheims]], [[Eric Sanders (playwright)|Éric Sander]] or also Charwei Tsai was exhibited at Deyrolle. [[Woody Allen]] used the rooms of Deyrolle in July 2010 for his movie ''[[Midnight in Paris]]'', and [[Wes Anderson]] is a huge fan of the shop.

Deyrolle also develops collaborations with artists. We can mention Aurèle or [[Damien Hirst]], for example.

=== Music ===
In 2005, French singer [[Nolwenn Leroy]] shot the artwork for her album ''[[Histoires Naturelles (album)|Histoires Naturelles]]'' at Deyrolle, as well as the music video for the single "Histoire Naturelle".

=== Exhibitions ===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1237">'''Drum charts''' are musical charts written for [[drummers]].  They are used to help guide the drummer through the music.  Sometimes they are meant to be read literally and other times they are used as suggestions for what the drummer should play.  Drum charts include their own musical vocabulary.  The music written for drummers is not the same as, say, a [[pianist]].  Drummers use their own symbols and language in their charts.  For example, a "middle C" note written on a staff for pianists is equivalent to the "[[snare drum]]" for drummers.  Or, the note "F" on the piano staff is equal to the "[[bass drum]]."  There is no set standard for writing drum music.  But there is a guide that is usually adhered to.  For example, in Steve Houghton's book ''Studio &amp; Big Band Drumming'', p. 9, under "Rock Patterns", Steve writes each drum or [[cymbal]] used in a percussion staff and states the assigned "note."  The placement of the drum notes is very typical of a drum chart but may not always be the same within the drum community.

'''Erhard Blankenburg''' (October 30, 1938 – March 28, 2018) was a German sociologist, specializing in the [[sociology of law]].
[[File:Erhard Blankenburg.jpg|thumb|Erhard Blankenburg (2013)]]

== Education and Career ==
Blankenburg studied philosophy, sociology and German literature at the [[University of Freiburg]] and the Free University Berlin. He received an MA from the University of Oregon (1965) and a PhD (D.Phil.) from the University of Basel (1966). After working as an assistant to the sociologist [[Heinrich Popitz]] at the University of Freiburg (1966-1968), he received there his [[habilitation]] (1974). From 1975 to 1980, Blankenburg worked at the renowned [[Wissenschaftszentrum Berlin für Sozialforschung|Wissenschaftszentrums Berlin]]. In 1980 he became professor of sociology of law at the [[Free University Amsterdam]]

In the 1970s, he was, along with [[Wolfgang Kaupen]], [[Rüdiger Lautmann]] and [[Volkmar Gessner]], instrumental in reviving sociology of law in Germany. There, he was among the founders of the "Zeitschrift für Rechtssoziologie", still the leading journal in the German socio-legal community. He also played a role in establishing the [[International Institute for the Sociology of Law]]. In 1991, together with [[Bill Felstiner]], he organized the first joint meeting of the [[Law and Society Association]] and the [[Research Committee on Sociology of Law]], the two leading organizations of socio-legal scholars in Amsterdam. His research covered a broad range of socio-legal topics, with an interest in describing and comparing legal cultures at the centre.

In 2005, Blankenburg received, at the annual conference of the Research Committee on Sociology of Law in Paris, the [[Adam Podgórecki]] Prize "for outstanding achievements in socio-legal research".
"Blankenburg has given us an important body of work. It is work that is (and should be) extremely influential in the field; and no respectable sociologist of law  can afford to ignore it. For this he deserves out thanks and our congratulation" (Friedman 1998, 386).

The '''European Institute for Gender Equality''' is a [[Vilnius]]-based [[Agencies of the European Union|agency of the European Union]] inaugurated in 2007. It was established by [[European Union regulation|Council Regulation]] (EC) No 1922/2006 of 20 December 2006. Recruitment of its Director was advertised in April 2007.

Funded by the Commission, with a proposed budget of €52.5 million for the period 2007 to 2013, this new European Institute will support the EU institutions and the Member States in promoting equality between women and men and combating sex discrimination. The Institute will gather, analyse and disseminate reliable and comparable research data and information needed by policy-makers. It will have a documentation centre and a library which will be open to the public.

The Management Board of the institute consists of eighteen representatives of the EU Member States appointed by the Council and of one member representing the European Commission. An Experts' forum as further body of the institute consists of delegates designated by the Member States (28), the European Parliament (2) and the Commission (3), the latter including representatives from non-governmental, employers' and workers' organisations at EU level.

'''Eye movement in reading''' involves the [[visual processing]] of written text. This was described by the French [[ophthalmology|ophthalmologist]] [[Louis Émile Javal]] in the late 19th century. He reported that eyes do not move continuously along a line of text, but make short, rapid movements ([[saccade]]s) intermingled with short stops ([[Fixation (visual)|fixations]]). Javal's observations were characterised by a reliance on naked-eye observation of [[eye movement]] in the absence of technology. From the late 19th to the mid-20th century, investigators used early tracking technologies to assist their observation, in a research climate that emphasised the measurement of [[human behaviour]] and skill for educational ends. Most basic knowledge about eye movement was obtained during this period. Since the mid-20th century, there have been three major changes: the development of non-invasive eye-movement tracking equipment; the introduction of computer technology to enhance the power of this equipment to pick up, record, and process the huge volume of data that eye movement generates; and the emergence of [[cognitive psychology]] as a theoretical and methodological framework within which [[reading (process)|reading]] processes are examined. Sereno &amp; Rayner (2003) believed that the best current approach to discover immediate signs of word recognition is through recordings of eye movement and [[event-related potential]].

== History ==

Until the second half of the 19th century, researchers had at their disposal three methods of investigating eye movement. The first, unaided observation, yielded only small amounts of data that would be considered unreliable by today's scientific standards. This lack of reliability arises from the fact that eye movement occurs frequently, rapidly, and over small angles, to the extent that it is impossible for an experimenter to [[perceive]] and record the data fully and accurately without technological assistance. The other method was [[self-observation]], now considered to be of doubtful status in a scientific context. Despite this, some knowledge appears to have been produced from [[introspection]] and naked-eye observation. For example, [[Ibn al-Haytham|Ibn al Haytham]], a medical man in 11th-century Egypt, is reported to have written of reading in terms of a series of quick movements and to have realised that readers use [[peripheral vision|peripheral]] as well as [[Fovea centralis|central vision]].&lt;ref&gt;Heller (1988:39).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Eye Line of sight.jpg|thumb|left|Leonardo da Vinci: The eye has a central line and everything that reaches the eye through this central line can be seen distinctly.]]

[[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452–1519) may have been the first in Europe to recognize certain special optical qualities of the eye. He derived his insights partly through introspection but mainly through a process that could be described as optical modelling. Based on dissection of the human eye he made experiments with water-filled crystal balls. He wrote "The function of the human eye, ... was described by a large number of authors in a certain way. But I found it to be completely different."&lt;ref&gt;Leonardo da Vinci (1955), das Lebensbild eines Genies, Emil Vollmer Verlag, Wiesbaden Berlin. Dokumentation der Davinci Ausstellung in Mailand 1938, p. 430; cited in 'Hans-Werner Hunziker, (2006) Im Auge des Lesers: foveale und periphere Wahrnehmung – vom Buchstabieren zur Lesefreude'  [In the eye of the reader: foveal and peripheral perception – from letter recognition to the joy of reading] Transmedia Stäubli Verlag Zürich 2006 {{ISBN|978-3-7266-0068-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

His main experimental finding was that there is only a distinct and clear vision at the "line-of-sight", the optical line that ends at the [[Fovea centralis|fovea]]. Although he did not use these words literally he actually is the father of the modern distinction between foveal vision (a more precise term for central vision) and [[peripheral vision]]. However, Leonardo did not know that the retina is the sensible layer, he still believed that the lens is the organ of vision.

There appear to be no records of eye movement research until the early 19th century. At first, the chief concern was to describe the eye as a [[physiological]] and mechanical moving object, the most serious attempt being [[Hermann von Helmholtz]]'s major work ''Handbook of physiological optics'' (1866). The physiological approach was gradually superseded by interest in the [[psychological]] aspects of visual input, in eye movement as a functional component of visual tasks.

The subsequent decades saw more elaborate attempts to interpret eye movement, including a claim that meaningful text requires fewer fixations to read than random strings of letters.&lt;ref&gt;Rayner, Pollatsek, &amp; Alexander (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1879, the French [[ophthalmology|ophthalmologist]] [[Louis Émile Javal]] used a mirror on one side of a page to observe eye movement in silent reading, and found that it involves a succession of discontinuous individual movements for which he coined the term [[saccade]]s. In 1898, Erdmann &amp; Dodge used a hand-mirror to estimate average fixation duration and saccade length with surprising accuracy.

=== Early tracking technology ===

[[Eye tracking device]] is a tool created to help measure eye and head movements. The first devices for tracking eye movement took two main forms: those that relied on a mechanical connection between participant and recording instrument, and those in which light or some other form of [[electromagnetic energy]] was directed at the participant's eyes and its reflection measured and recorded. In 1883, Lamare was the first to use a mechanical connection, by placing a blunt needle on the participant's upper eyelid. The needle picked up the sound produced by each saccade and transmitted it as a faint clicking to the experimenter's ear through an amplifying [[Membrane (selective barrier)|membrane]] and a rubber tube. The rationale behind this device was that saccades are easier to perceive and register aurally than visually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lamare |first1=M. |title=Des mouvements des yeux pendants la lecture |journal=Comptes rendus de la société française d'ophthalmologie |date=1893 |pages=35–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1889, [[Edmund B. Delabarre]] invented a system of recording eye movement directly onto a rotating drum by means of a [[stylus]] with a direct mechanical connection to the [[cornea]].&lt;ref&gt;Delabarre (1898).&lt;/ref&gt; Other devices involving physical contact with the surface of the eyes were developed and used from the end of the 19th century until the late 1920s; these included such items as rubber balloons and eye caps.

Mechanical systems suffered three serious disadvantages: questionable accuracy due to slippage of the physical connection, the considerable discomfort caused to participants by the direct mechanical connection (and consequently great difficulty in persuading people to participate), and issues of [[ecological validity]], since participants' experience of reading in trials was significantly different from the normal reading experience. Despite these drawbacks, mechanical devices were used in eye movement research well into the 20th century.

Attempts were soon made to overcome these problems. One solution was to use electromagnetic energy rather than a mechanical connection. In the "Dodge technique", a beam of light was directed at the cornea, focused by a system of lenses and then recorded on a moveable photographic plate. Erdmann &amp; Dodge&lt;ref&gt;Erdmann B &amp; Dodge R (1898).&lt;/ref&gt; used this technique to claim that there is little or no perception during saccades, a finding that was later confirmed by Utall &amp; Smith using more sophisticated equipment. The photographic plate in the Dodge technique was soon replaced with a film camera, but was still plagued by problems of accuracy, due to the difficulty of keeping all parts of the equipment perfectly aligned throughout a trial and accurately compensating for the distortion caused by the diffractive qualities of photographic lenses. In addition, it was usually necessary to restrain a participant's head by using an uncomfortable bite-bar or head-clamp.

In 1922, Schott pioneered a further advance called [[electro-oculography]] (EOG), a method of recording the electrical potential between the cornea and the [[retina]].&lt;ref&gt;Schott E (1922).&lt;/ref&gt; Electrodes may be covered with special contact paste before being placed on the skin. So, it is now unnecessary to make incisions in patient's skin. Common misconception about EOG is that measured potential is the electromyogram of [[extraocular muscles]]. In fact, it is only the projection of eye dipole to the skin, because higher frequencies, corresponding to EMG, are filtered out. EOG delivered considerable improvements in accuracy and reliability, which explain its continued use by experimentalists for many decades.&lt;ref&gt;Finocchio, Preston, &amp; Fuchs (1990).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Liu, Zhou, Hu (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tecce, Pok, Consiglio, O'Neil (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern eye tracking ==

Four major cognitive systems are involved in eye movement during reading: language processing, attention, vision, and oculomotor control.&lt;ref name=" "&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~perfetti/Eye%20Movements%20During%20Reading.htm |title=Eye Movements During Reading |publisher=Pitt.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eye trackers bounce near [[infrared]] light off the interior of the eyeball, and monitor the reflection on the eye to determine gaze location. With this technique, the position of a fixation on a screen can be precisely determined.&lt;ref&gt;wang (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Wang (2011) mentioned that a video-based eye-tracker which uses video cameras to record the eye position of human subjects—recording pupil dilation and eye movement—can be used to examine how fixations, saccades, and pupil dilation responses are related to the information on the screen and behavioral choices. According to Wang (2011:185), "understanding the relationship between these observables can help us to understand how human behavior in the economy can be affected by what information people acquire, where their attention is focused, what emotional state they are in, and even what brain activity they are engaged in. This is because fixations and saccades (matched with information shown on screen) indicate how people acquire information (and what they see), time lengths of fixations indicate attention, and pupil dilation responses indicate emotion, arousal, stress, pain, or cognitive load." {{citation needed|date=May 2018}}&lt;!--not thrilled with the strict categories Wang implies--&gt;

== Saccades ==

[[Image:Reading VOG hor.gif|thumb|right|Horizontal eye movement in reading. Left-to-right movement may be seen as "upstairs", and right-to-left saccades are clear.]]
Skilled readers move their eyes during reading on the average of every quarter of a second. During the time that the eye is fixated, new information is brought into the processing system. Although the average fixation duration is 200–250 ms (thousandths of a second), the range is from 100 ms to over 500 ms.&lt;ref&gt;Sereno &amp; Rayner (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; The distance the eye moves in each saccade (or short rapid movement) is between 1 and 20 characters with the average being 7–9 characters. The saccade lasts for 20–40 ms and during this time vision is suppressed so that no new information is acquired.&lt;ref&gt;Rayner, Foorman, Perfetti, Pesetsky, &amp; Seidenberg (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; There is considerable variability in fixations (the point at which a saccade jumps to) and saccades between readers and even for the same person reading a single passage of text. Skilled readers make regressions back to material already read about 15 percent of the time. The main difference between faster and slower readers is that the latter group consistently shows longer average fixation durations, shorter saccades, and more regressions.&lt;ref&gt;Rayner, Slattery, Belanger (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; These basic facts about eye movement have been known for almost a hundred years, but only recently have researchers begun to look at eye movement behavior as a reflection of [[cognitive processing]] during reading.&lt;ref&gt;Rayner K (1975).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:EyeFixationsReading.gif|frame|center|A diagram demonstrating the [[Visual acuity|acuity]] of foveal vision in reading]]
The lower line of text simulates the acuity of vision with the relative acuity percentages. The difficulty of recognizing text increases with the distance from the fixation point.&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Werner Hunziker, (2006) Im Auge des Lesers: foveale und periphere Wahrnehmung – vom Buchstabieren zur Lesefreude  [In the eye of the reader: foveal and peripheral perception – from letter recognition to the joy of reading] Transmedia Stäubli Verlag Zürich 2006, {{ISBN|978-3-7266-0068-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dyslexia ==
People with [[dyslexia]] generally suffer from a decreased reading speed, which can be caused by many different variables. There are many remedies to try and combat these deficits, depending on what [[Biological theories of dyslexia|biological theory of dyslexia]] they are based on.

'''[[Eye movement]] in scene viewing''' refers to the [[visual processing]] of information presented in scenes. This phenomenon has been studied in a range of areas such as [[cognitive psychology]] and [[psychophysics]], where eye movement can be monitored under experimental conditions. A core aspect in these studies is the division of eye movements into [[saccades]], the rapid movement of the eyes, and fixations, the focus of the eyes on a point. There are several factors which influence eye movement in scene viewing, both the task and knowledge of the viewer (top-down factors), and the properties of the image being viewed (bottom-up factors). The study of eye movement in scene viewing helps to understand visual processing in more natural environments.

Typically, when presented with a scene, viewers demonstrate short fixation durations and long saccade amplitudes in the earlier phases of viewing an image, representing ambient processing. This is followed by longer fixations and shorter saccades in the latter phases of scene viewing, representing focal processing (Pannasch et al., 2008).

Eye movement behaviour in scene viewing differs between different levels of cognitive development. Fixation durations shorten and saccade amplitudes lengthen with the increase in age. In children, the development of saccades to the amplitude normally found in adults have occur earlier (4–6 years old) than the development of fixation durations (6–8 years old). Yet, the typical pattern of behaviour during scene viewing, when progressing from ambient processing to focal processing, has been observed to occur from the age of 2 years old (Helo, Pannasch, Sirri &amp; Rämä, 2014).

== Spatial variation ==

There are particular factors which affect where eye movements fixate upon, these include bottom-up factors inherent to the stimulus, and top-down factors inherent to the viewer. Even an initial glimpse of a scene has been found to generate an abstract representation of the image that can be stored in memory for use in subsequent eye movements (Castelhano &amp; Henderson, 2007).

In bottom-up factors, eye guidance can be affected by the local contrast or salience of features in an image (Itti &amp; Koch, 2000). An example of this would be an area with a large difference in luminance (Parkhurst et al., 2002), a greater density of edges (Mannan, Ruddock &amp; Wooding, 1996) or binocular disparity determining the distance of different objects on the scene (Jansen et al., 2009).

The top-down factors of scenes have more of an impact than bottom-up features in affecting fixation positions. Behaviourally relevant information that are more interesting in a scene is more salient than low-level features, drawing fixations more frequently and more quickly from scene onset (Onat, Açik, Schumann &amp; König, 2014). Local scene colour in a fixation position has an influence on where fixations occur. The presence of colour can increase the likelihood of the item being processed as a semantic object as it can aid the discrimination of the object, making it more interesting to view (Amano &amp; Foster, 2014). When viewers are semantically primed by being presented with consistently similar scenes, the density of fixations increase, and fixation durations decrease (Henderson, Weeks Jr., &amp; Hollingworth, 1999).

Information separate to what is presented in a scene also has an effect on the area being fixated upon. Eye movements can be guided anticipatorily by linguistic input, where if an item in the scene is presented verbally, the listener will be more likely to move their visual focus to that object (Staub, Abott &amp; Bogartz, 2012).
With regard to factors relating to viewers rather than the scene, differences have been found in cross-cultural research. Westerners have an inclination to concentrate on focal objects in a scene, where they look at focal objects more often and quicker in comparison to East Asians who attend more to contextual information, where they make more saccades to the background of the scene (Chua, Boland &amp; Nisbett, 2002).

== Temporal variation ==

Regarding the temporality of fixations,  average fixation durations last for 300ms on average, although there is a large variability around this approximation. Some of this variability can be explained through global properties of an image, impacting upon both bottom-up processing and top-down processing.

During natural scene viewing, the masking of an image by replacing it with a grey field during fixations has an increase in fixation durations (Henderson &amp; Pierce, 2008). More subtle degradations of an image on fixation durations, such as the decrease in luminance of an image during fixations, also increases the length of fixation durations (Henderson, Nuthmann &amp; Luke, 2013). An asymmetric effect is shown where the increase of luminance also increases fixation durations (Walshe &amp; Nuthmann, 2014). However, the change in factors affecting top-down processing, such as [[Gaussian blur|blur]]ring or [[phase noise]], increases fixation durations when used to degrade a scene and decreases fixation durations when used to enhance a scene (Henderson, Olejarczyk, Luke &amp; Schmidt, 2014; Einhäuser et al., 2006).

Furthermore, temporal and spatial aspects interact in a complex manner. When a picture is first presented on the screen, fixations made within the first second are more likely to be directed toward the left side of the scene, whereas the opposite holds true for the remaining part of the presentation (Ossandón et al., 2014).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13610">'''False necessity''', or '''anti-necessitarian social theory''', is a contemporary [[social theory]] that argues for the plasticity of social organizations and their potential to be shaped in new ways.  The theory rejects the assumption that laws of change govern the history of human societies and limit human freedom.&lt;ref name= "fn xvii"&gt;Unger, Robero Mangabeira, ''False necessity: anti-necessitarian social theory in the service of radical democracy: from Politics, a work in constructive social theory'' (London: Verso, 2004), xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a critique of "necessitarian" thought in conventional social theories (like [[liberalism]] or [[Marxism]]) which hold that parts of the social order are necessary or the result of the natural flow of history. The theory rejects the idea that human societies must be organized in a certain way (for example, [[liberal democracy]]) and that human activity will adhere to certain forms (for example if people were only motivated by [[homo economicus|rational self-interest]]).

''False necessity'' uses [[Structuralism|structural analysis]] to understand socio-political arrangements, but discards the tendency to assemble indivisible categories and to create law-like explanations. It aims to liberate human activity from necessary arrangements and limitations, and to open up a world without constraints where the possible becomes actual.&lt;ref&gt;See Unger, Roberto Mangabeira. 1987.

==Background==
Modern social theory contains a tension between the realization of human freedom and the necessity of social rules.&lt;ref&gt;This background is drawn from Ian Shapiro, "Review: Constructing Politics," Political Theory 17, no. 3 (1989): 475-482, Roberto Mangabeira Unger, ''Social Theory: Its Situation and its Task, Politics 2'' (New York: Verso, 1987), Bernard Yack, ''The longing for total revolution: philosophic sources of social discontent from Rousseau to Marx and Nietzsche'' (Princeton, N.J: Princeton University Press, 1986), Bernard Yack, "Review: Toward a Free Marketplace of Social Institutions: Roberto Unger's 'Super-Liberal' Theory of Emancipation," Harvard Law Review 101, no. 8 (June 1, 1988): 1961-1977.
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Classical liberalism#Intellectual sources|Liberal political theorists]] of the seventeenth century, such as [[Hobbes]] and [[John Locke|Locke]], saw the issue as one of sacrificing some individual freedoms in order to gain others. They understood social rules as enabling constraints—necessary impositions that limited activity in some spheres in order to expand it in others. (For example, traffic laws compel us to drive on one side of the road but allow us to travel more freely than if we were constantly assailed by oncoming traffic.) In the socio-political realm, these early liberal thinkers argued that we agree to surrender our freedom for political authority in order to gain greater freedom from a [[state of nature]]. The sovereign authority is a constraint, but it allows freedom from the constraints that other individuals might impose upon us. In this way, rules are always seen as a means of increasing freedom rather than rescinding it.

These early [[Age of Enlightenment#Important intellectuals|Enlightenment thinkers]] opposed existing religious, aristocratic, and absolutist institutions and organizations as the natural state of the world. However, they did not argue for the absolute freedom of the individual outside of any constraining rules. For them, human activity was still subject to certain types of social arrangements that followed a historical necessity.  

Inspired by [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s thesis of [[Immanuel Kant#Idea of freedom|human freedom]], which argued that there is no evidence to disprove our absolute freedom or capacity to resist external domination, thinkers at the end of the eighteenth century addressed how human freedoms were constrained by social institutions. Thinkers like [[Fichte]], [[Schiller]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], and [[Hegel]] argued that those institutions that constrain human freedom and subject the individual to fear and prejudice insult human dignity and deny the individual his autonomy. But they attempted to formulate universal laws, which in turn led to deterministic social and political arrangements. Marx, for example, put humanity at the mercy of historical and institutional necessity. 

The contemporary theory of false necessity attempts to realize this idea in its entirety, and to escape the limitations of liberal and Marxist theories. It aims to realize social plasticity by decoupling human freedom from any necessary social rules or historical trajectory. The theory recognizes the need for social rules, but also affirms the human potential to transcend them. Humanity need not be constrained by any structure.

==Development and content==
The development of the theory is credited to philosopher and politician [[Roberto Mangabeira Unger]]. His main book on the thesis, ''False Necessity: Anti-necessitarian social theory in the service of radical democracy'', was first published in 1987 by Cambridge University Press, and reissued in 2004 by Verso with a new 124 page introduction, and a new appendix, "Five theses on the relation of religion to politics, illustrated by allusions to Brazilian experience."&lt;ref&gt;Unger, Roberto Mangabeira, ''False necessity: anti-necessitarian social theory in the service of radical democracy: from Politics, a work in constructive social theory,'' second edition (London: Verso, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of ''false necessity'' attempts to understand humans and human history without making ourselves the object of a law-giving fate. It rejects the assumption that certain and necessary laws of organization and change govern the social, political, and economic institutions of human activity and thereby limit human freedom. It holds that the problem with traditional deep structure theory, such as Marxism, is that it couples the distinction of deep structure and routine practice with both indivisible types of social organization, and deep seated constraints and developmental laws. The theory rejects the constraints and focuses on how human behavior is shaped by the deep structures of these institutions, and how they can be remade at will, either in whole or in part. The aim is to rescue social theory and recreate the project of self-affirmation and society.&lt;ref name= "fn xvii"/&gt;

Rather than "enabling constraint" or "universal structure", the theory advocates "structure-denying structures"—that is, structures that enable their own dissolution and remaking. Since these structures normally constrain our activities, this would increase our freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Hugh. 1987. "Roberto Unger and the Critical Legal Studies Movement." Journal of Law and Society 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources of entrapment and emancipation==
The problem of false necessity arises due to the failure of transformative practice to realize its stated aim. This can take form in three different scenarios:&lt;ref name="Social Theory 5"&gt;Unger, Roberto Mangabeira, ''Social Theory: Its Situation and its Task, Politics 2'' (New York: Verso, 1987), chapter 5.&lt;/ref&gt;
*the ideals fought for (democracy, decentralization, technical coordination, etc.) result in the development of rigid institutions
*an oligarchy effect in which groups and rulers clash at the summit of power and drum up popular support
*the survival effect in which there is a fear of disturbance of contemporary arrangements.

Unger points to mass politics as a means to counter oligarchy and group identity. However, if these forms are only disturbed and not destroyed, democracy is limited and becomes a quarrel about forms of power and seizing advantage. Likewise, enlarged economic rationality provides another source of emancipation by shifting economic and social relations in the ability to constantly innovate and renew.&lt;ref name="Social Theory 5"/&gt;

==The radical project==
The theory of ''false necessity'' develops the idea that the organization of society is made and can be remade—we can rebel against the worlds we have built; we can interrupt our rebellions and establish ourselves in any of those worlds. By emphasizing the disembodiment of institutional and social structures, the theory provides a basis to explain ourselves and our world without using necessitarian thought or predetermined institutional arrangements.&lt;ref name= "fn xvii"/&gt;

At the extreme, the theory of ''false necessity'' criticizes and thus unifies strands of the radical tradition. It frees leftist and liberal ideals from institutional fetishism, and emancipates modernist ideals from structural fetishism. The theory further detaches the radical commitment from utopian claims and provides a theoretical basis for transformative action.&lt;ref&gt;Unger, Roberto Mangabeira, ''Social Theory: Its Situation and its Task, Politics 2'' (New York: Verso, 1987), chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt; That transformative action, Unger believes, does not have to be a complete overhaul or total revolution, but rather is "a piecemeal but cumulative change in the organization of society".&lt;ref&gt;Unger, Robero Mangabeira, ''False necessity: anti-necessitarian social theory in the service of radical democracy: from Politics, a work in constructive social theory'' (London: Verso, 2004), xix.&lt;/ref&gt; The key to the project, in the words of one critic, "is to complete the rebellion against the naturalistic fallacy (that is, the confusion of accident with essence and contingency with necessity) and to effect an irrevocable emancipation from false necessity".&lt;ref&gt;Hutchinson, Allan C. "Review: A Poetic Champion Composes: Unger (Not) on Ecology and Women." The University of Toronto Law Journal 40, no. 2 (April 1, 1990): 275.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thinkers and opinions==

Contemporary{{when|date=September 2014}} political thinkers and philosophers have developed and advocated the theory of false necessity. [[Roberto Mangabeira Unger]] has employed the theory in developing social, political, and economic alternatives,&lt;ref&gt;Unger, Roberto Mangabeira. ''Democracy realized: the progressive alternative.'' London: Verso, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Unger, Roberto Mangabeira.

'''''Gobar Times''''' is a monthly environmental education magazine for the young adult, published by the [[Centre for Science and Environment]]. It is published along with ''[[Down to Earth (magazine)|Down to Earth]]'' as a supplement. The magazine was first published in May, 1998 and has widespread circulation across India and abroad. The icon of the magazine, Pandit Gobar Ganesh, the pondering panditji is an Indian elderly who takes the reader through current issues, subjects and ideas relating to the environment. He is the icon whose brains can be picked for anything on earth. The current editor of the magazine is Sumita Dasgupta.

"[[Gobar]]" is the [[Hindi language|Hindi]] and  [[Nepali language|Nepali]] word for "cow dung". It was chosen to capture the eco-philosophy and tradition of generating wealth from waste. Waste gobar serves as an [[insecticide]] and is used to plaster mud houses and is a waterproof coating for walls. It is also used to plaster floors to keep them cool. Gobar is the energy source for rural India. It is used as cooking fuel where people have no access to fuels like [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]]. The greatest use of cow dung in India is in farming where it is used as natural manure for farmers' crops. In short, it's a mainstay of rural India, and an appropriate symbol for eco-friendly technology.

[[Anil Agarwal (environmentalist)|Anil Agarwal]] the founder-director of Centre for Science and Environment, India’s leading environmental NGO, aptly called ‘Gobar’ the symbol that embodies the spirit of the Indian environmental movement. As he correctly reflected, the widespread and diverse use of gobar in Indian society stands up to every principle of good environmentalism.

== History ==
In May 1992, the Society for Environmental Communications started India’s only science and environment fortnightly, ''Down To Earth'' (DTE). Over the years the magazine has informed and inspired people about environmental threats facing India and the world - a dimension underplayed in mainstream media. In May, 1998, ''Gobar Times'' was first published as a supplement to ''DTE''. ''Gobar Times'' reaches out to the young, encouraging them to take the lead and make a difference. It informs them and encourages them to save the environment by becoming an action-oriented, knowledgeable and aware community. The tone of the magazine is light-hearted, simple and thought-provoking. Every month the magazine comes up with an activity related center spread which can be pulled out and put up as a poster to encourage readers to become active participants. The magazine has recently entered into a partnership with the leading newspaper ''[[Hindustan Times]]''. Readers can now get a glimpse of what Pandit Gobar Ganesh has to say as they read HTNext.

== Green Schools Program ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:GSP-logo.gif|thumb|left|GSP logo]] --&gt;Conceptualized by the [[New Delhi]]–based Centre for Science and Environment(CSE), The ''Gobar Times'' Green Schools Program allows self-assessment of the environmental practices of a school by its students, using the "Green Schools Manual". This inspection or survey of environmental practices at schools&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gdsalwan.com/Environment.html G D Salwan Public School, Green Schools Program]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kfirural.org/Green_sch.html The Rural centre]&lt;/ref&gt; is a way for them to audit their immediate environment across the key areas of water, air, land, energy and waste.

*'''Water''': To make the school water literate and teach ways of [[rainwater harvesting]] and recycling of waste water.
*'''Air''': Students check out the transport system of the school and understand how people commute to school. This further enables them to understand how transport policies affect air quality and how they can innovate and find ways of reducing [[Air pollution|emissions]].
*'''Land''': The different plant and animal species on the school campus are identified by the students and a survey done on the use of [[pesticides]] in the school. Understanding the concept of carrying capacity.
*'''Energy''': The students study electricity and other forms of energy consumption on the school campus and explore ways in which it can be minimized.
*'''Waste''': Students find out how much and what type of waste the school is producing? Learn [[composting]] and waste segregation methods in the process.

By the end of it all the program gives the students an opportunity to give a report card to the school on its environmental performance and practices. They conduct the audit with the help of an interesting handbook called the 'Green Schools Program Manual' (2007 Edition). This manual gives them step by step guidelines on how to conduct an environmental audit in the school.

The purpose of the Green Schools Program is to encourage and support schools to build up an environmentally aware, active and skilled community&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2007/01/09/stories/2007010902810800.htm Opinion, Director - NCERT]&lt;/ref&gt; of teachers, students and parents. The schools may use the manual as part of their environmental studies program or to conduct activities in eco-clubs. The data collected by students is compiled and rated such that it becomes a self-assessment tool of environmental practices followed by the school. The aim of the rating is, to understand what can be done to improve the schools performance on its environmental sustainability index and to implement changes over the coming years.

=== Awards ===
The ''Gobar Times'' Green Schools Awards is a platform to acknowledge and reward  schools which have adopted the most innovative and effective practices to manage [[natural resources]] within their own premises. Schools send in their green reports to CSE. These reports undergo rigorous verification and selection and the best schools are awarded annually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.outlookindia.com/item.aspx?650467 Outlook Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/delhi-schools-awarded-for-green-initiatives/582368/ Indian Express - Green Initiative]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2010/02/21/stories/2010022158190300.htm The Hindu - Elite 'Delhi' schools fail 'green test']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Award GSP.jpg|thumb|left|Award ceremony for Green Schools Program]]

The top 10 schools of the country which have been working and have implemented tremendous improvement in their environmental practices are awarded the 'Change Makers' award. Schools participating for the first time are considered in the 'New Schools' category.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stpauls-delhi.com/parents%20corner.html St Pauls, Delhi]&lt;/ref&gt; They are judged basis involvement of students and teachers, and the quality of the reports submitted. Also schools which do not necessarily audit all areas but do exceptionally well in a single specific area of water, energy, land, air or waste apply for the coveted 'Best Managers' award.

=== Partners ===
The [[National Green Corps]]&lt;ref&gt;[[National Green Corps#External links|National Green Corps]]&lt;/ref&gt; is a program of the [[Ministry of Environment and Forests (India)|Ministry of Environment and Forest]], Government of India). State nodal offices and CSE partner in many states across India. As the Green Schools network is expanding, the awards are now also organized at the state level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pscst.com/en/about/CSE%20green%20school%20award.htm Punjab State, Green Schools Program]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sikenvis.nic.in/archives.htm Sikkim, Green Schools Training]&lt;/ref&gt; The highest rank holders at the state level in different categories are nominated by state nodal agencies to compete for national awards with CSE in Delhi.

==Overview==
The phrase was coined by [http://www.myriadeditions.com/creator/ian-williams/ Ian Williams]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Graphic Medicine|url=http://graphicmedicine.org/#/graphic-medicine/4531707343|work=Why ''Graphic Medicine?"|accessdate=31 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to denote "the intersection between the medium of comics and the discourse of healthcare". Comics offer an engaging, powerful, and accessible method of delivering [[illness]] [[narrative]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hektoen International.|url=http://www.hektoeninternational.org/graphicMedicine.html|work=Graphic medicine: how comics are revolutionizing the representation of illness|accessdate=31 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The academic appraisal of graphic fiction is in its infancy, but its examination by academics involved in [[healthcare]]-related studies is increasing, with work emerging in journals such as ''Configurations: A Journal of Literature, Science, and Technology'' (2.2) as well as ''Journal of the Medical Humanities'' and ''Literature and Medicine''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=IC|title=Graphic medicine: comics as medical narrative.|journal=Medical humanities|date=2012-01-25|pmid=22282425|doi=10.1136/medhum-2011-010093|volume=38|issue=1|pages=21–7}}&lt;!--|accessdate=31 January 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It is notable that the [[Medical Humanities]] movement in many medical schools (e.g., Penn State University, http://www2.med.psu.edu/humanities/) advocates the framework and use of literature in exploring illness, from practitioner and patient perspectives. A recent entry to the scholarly study of graphic mediciine is the Einstein Foundation funded project at the Freie Universität Berlin (2016-2019) under the direction of Irmela Marei Krüger-Fürhoff and with the collaboration of Susan Merrill Squier, Einstein Visiting Fellow and Brill Professor at the Pennsylvania State University: ''PathoGraphics'', the study of illness narratives or pathographies and works of graphic medicine. 
[http://www.myriadeditions.com/creator/ian-williams/ Williams] set up the [http://www.graphicmedicine.org Graphic Medicine website] in 2007 whilst writing a masters dissertation on medical narrative in comics and graphic novels, during which time he found Susan M. Squier's essays,  “Beyond Nescience: the intersectional insights of health humanities.” ''Perspectives in Biology and Medicine''. 50:3 (summer 2007): 334-47, and “So Long as They Grow Out of It: Comics, The Discourse of Developmental Normalcy, and Disability.” Journal of Medical Humanities. 29:2 (June 2008): 71-88. Scholars from around the world who were interested in comics and healthcare began to get in touch, notably [http://www.pennstatehershey.org/findaprovider/provider/178 Prof Michael Green], who had recently set up a [http://www2.med.psu.edu/humanities/graphic-narratives/ graphic narratives course] at Hershey Medical School at Penn State University, and MK Czerwiec, aka [http://www.comicnurse.com "Comic Nurse"], who had, for many years, been recording her experiences as an [[HIV/AIDS|HIV]] [[Hospice care in the United States|hospice]] nurse in [[comics]] form. Green invited his colleagues Kimberley Myers, of the Medical Humanities Program at Penn State Milton Hershey Medical School and Susan M. Squier, Brill Professor of English and Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies, who teaches graphic medicine to Ph.D. students at the Penn State University and whose work Williams had encountered earlier, to the discussion group, and Williams introduced [http://research-information.bristol.ac.uk/en/persons/maria-vaccarella(74c125a2-f1d2-45e7-9132-75a9e2e07e52).html Maria Vaccarella], [http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/giskin.day Giskin Day] and Columba Quigley. The group decided to hold a conference, in 2010 at The University of London, which led to a series of annual international conferences with presentations that are frequently posted as podcasts after the conference, on http://www.graphicmedicine.org

Penn State University Press published '''''The Graphic Medicine Manifesto''''' in 2015. Authors are MK Czerwiec, Ian Williams, Susan Merrill Squier, Michael J. Green, Kimberly R. Myers, and Scott T. Smith.  Content summary: "Combining scholarly essays with visual narratives and a conclusion in comics form, establishes graphic medicine as a new area of scholarship.  Demonstrates that graphic medicine narratives offer patients, family members, and medical caregivers new ways to negotiate the challenges of the medical experience.  Discusses comics as visual rhetoric"—Provided by publisher.  {{ISBN|9780271066493}}; 195 pages, includes bibliographic references.  This was the inaugural volume in the ongoing Graphic Medicine series at Penn State University Press, which is co-edited by Susan M. Squier and Ian Williams.  For recent publications in the Graphic Medicine series, see its website:

In 2014, the first American Library Association Will Eisner Graphic Novel Growth Grant was awarded to Ypsilanti District Library, (Ypsilanti, Michigan) for its proposal to build a collection of graphic medicine narratives.  To date, that collection contains over 100 titles, which can be viewed in a subject search '''Graphic Medicine''' on the library's website: www.ypsilibrary.org. Author MK Czerwiec lectured in the fall of 2014 at St. Joseph Mercy Hospital (Ypsilanti, Michigan) in support of this grant.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11881">In [[agriculture]], '''green manure''' is created by leaving uprooted or sown crop parts to wither on a field so that they serve as a [[mulch]] and [[soil amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/green+manure|title=Green manure - Define Green manure at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plants used for green manure are often [[cover crop]]s grown primarily for this purpose. Typically, they are ploughed under and incorporated into the [[soil]] while green or shortly after flowering. Green manure is commonly associated with [[organic farming]] and can play an important role in sustainable annual cropping systems.

==Functions==
Green manures usually perform multiple functions that include soil improvement and soil protection:

* [[Leguminous]] green manures such as [[clover]] and [[vetch]] contain [[Nitrogen fixation|nitrogen-fixing]] [[symbiotic]] [[bacteria]] in [[root nodules]] that fix atmospheric nitrogen in a form that plants can use. This performs the vital function of fertilization.  If desired, [[animal]] manures may also be added.

:Depending on the species of cover crop grown, the amount of nitrogen released into the soil lies between 40 and 200 pounds per acre. With green manure use, the amount of nitrogen that is available to the succeeding crop is usually in the range of 40-60% of the total amount of nitrogen that is contained within the green manure crop.&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt;

* Green manure acts mainly as [[Soil acidification|soil-acidifying]] matter to decrease the alkalinity/pH of [[alkali soils]] by generating [[humic acid]] and [[acetic acid]].
* Incorporation of [[cover crops]] into the soil allows the nutrients held within the green manure to be released and made available to the succeeding crops. This results immediately from an increase in abundance of soil microorganisms from the degradation of plant material that aid in the decomposition of this fresh material.  This additional decomposition also allows for the re-incorporation of nutrients that are found in the soil in a particular form such as [[nitrogen]] (N), [[potassium]] (K), [[phosphorus]] (P), [[calcium]] (Ca), [[magnesium]] (Mg), and [[sulfur]] (S).
* Microbial activity from incorporation of cover crops into the soil leads to the formation of [[mycelium]] and viscous materials which benefit the health of the soil by increasing its [[soil structure]] (i.e. by aggregation).&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt;
:The increased percentage of organic matter ([[biomass]]) improves [[water]] infiltration and retention, aeration, and other soil characteristics. The soil is more easily turned or tilled than non-aggregated soil. Further aeration of the soil results from the ability of the root systems of many green manure crops to efficiently penetrate compact soils. The amount of [[humus]] found in the soil also increases with higher rates of decomposition, which is beneficial for the growth of the crop succeeding the green manure crop. Non-leguminous crops are primarily used to increase biomass.
*The [[root]] systems of some varieties of green manure grow deep in the soil and bring up nutrient resources unavailable to shallower-rooted crops.
* Common [[Cover crop#Weed management|cover crop functions of weed suppression]]. Non-leguminous crops are primarily used (e.g. [[buckwheat]])&lt;ref name="Lawrence 1980 145"/&gt; The deep rooting properties of many green manure crops make them efficient at suppressing [[weed]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Vasilakoglou, Ioannis, Dhima, Kico, Anastassopoulos, Elias, Lithourgidis, Anastasios, Gougoulias, Nikolaos, and Chouliaras, Nikolaos. 2011. Oregano green manure for weed suppression in sustainable cotton and corn fields. Weed Biology and Management 11:38-48.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some green manure crops, when allowed to [[flower]], provide [[Forage (honeybee)|forage]] for pollinating [[insect]]s. Green manure crops also often provide habitat for predatory beneficial insects, which allow for a reduction in the application of insecticides where cover crops are planted.
* Some green manure crops (e.g. [[winter wheat]] and [[winter rye]]) can also be used for grazing.&lt;ref name="Lawrence 1980 145"/&gt;
* [[Erosion control]] is often also taken into account when selecting which green manure cover crop to plant.
* Some [[Cover crop#Pest management|green crops reduce plant insect pests]] and [[Cover crop#Disease management|diseases]]. [[Verticillium wilt]] is especially reduced in potato plants.&lt;ref&gt;Larkin, Robert P., Honeycutt, Wayne, and Olanya Modesto, O. 2011.  Management of Verticillium Wilt of Potato with Disease-Suppressive Green Manures and as Affected by Previous Cropping History. Plant Dis. 95:568-576.&lt;/ref&gt;

Incorporation of green manures into a farming system can drastically reduce the need for additional products such as supplemental fertilizers and pesticides.

Limitations to consider in the use of green manure are time, energy, and resources (monetary and natural) required to successfully grow and utilize these cover crops. Consequently, it is important to choose green manure crops based on the growing region and annual precipitation amounts to ensure efficient growth and use of the cover crop(s).

==Nutrient creation==
Green manure is broken down into plant nutrient components by [[heterotrophic]] bacteria that consumes organic matter. Warmth and moisture contribute to this process, similar to creating [[compost]] fertilizer. The plant matter releases large amounts of carbon dioxide and weak acids that react with insoluble soil minerals to release beneficial nutrients. Soils that are high in [[calcium]] minerals, for example, can be given green manure to generate a higher [[phosphate]] content in the soil, which in turn acts as a fertilizer.&lt;ref name="Lawrence 1980 145"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lawrence|first=James|title=The Harrowsmith Reader, Volume II|year=1980|publisher=Camden House Publishing Ltd.|isbn=0920656102|pages=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ratio of carbon to [[nitrogen]] in a plant is a crucial factor to consider, since it will impact the nutrient content of the soil and may starve a crop of nitrogen, if the incorrect plants are used to make green manure. The ratio of carbon to nitrogen will differ from species to species, and depending upon the age of the plant. The ratio is referred to as C:N. The value of N is always one, whereas the value of carbon or carbohydrates is expressed in a value of about 10 up to 90; the ratio must be less than 30:1 to prevent the manure bacteria from depleting existing nitrogen in the soil. [[Rhizobium]] are soil organisms that interact with green manure to retain atmospheric nitrogen in the soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lawrence|first=James|title=The Harrowsmith Reader, Volume II|year=1980|publisher=Camden House Publishing Ltd.|isbn=0920656102|pages=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Legume]]s, such as beans, alfalfa, clover and lupines, have root systems rich in rhizobium, often making them the preferred source of green manure material.

==Crops==
Late-summer and fall green manure crops are [[oat]]s and [[rye]].&lt;ref name="mofga"&gt;{{cite web|title=Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association| url=http://www.mofga.org/portals/2/Fact%20Sheets/FS%2010%20Green%20Manures%20web.pdf| format=PDF| website=mofga.org|date=November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The value of green manure was recognized by farmers in India for thousands of years, as mentioned in treatises like Vrikshayurveda. In Ancient Greece too, farmers ploughed broad bean plants into the soil. Chinese agricultural texts dating back hundreds of years refer to the importance of grasses and weeds in providing nutrients for farm soil. It was also known to early North American colonists arriving from Europe. Common colonial green manure crops were rye, buckwheat and oats.&lt;ref name="Lawrence 1980 145"/&gt; Traditionally, the incorporation of green manure into the soil is known as the [[fallow]] cycle of [[crop rotation]], which was used to allow the soil to regain its fertility after the harvest.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14308">Since prehistoric times,  significant changes in communication technologies (media and appropriate inscription tools) have evolved in tandem with shifts in political and economic systems, and by extension, systems of power. Communication can range from very subtle processes of exchange, to full conversations and mass communication. Human communication was revolutionized with the [[origin of speech]] approximately 500,000 BCE. Symbols were developed about 30,000 years ago.
The imperfection of speech, which nonetheless allowed easier dissemination of ideas and stimulated [[invention]]s, eventually resulted in the creation of new forms of communications, improving both the range at which people could communicate and the longevity of the information. All of those inventions were based on the key concept of the symbol.

The oldest known  symbols created for the purpose of communication were [[cave paintings]], a form of [[rock art]], dating to the [[Upper Paleolithic]] age. The oldest known cave painting is located within [[Chauvet Cave]], dated to around 30,000 [[Anno Domini|BC]].&lt;ref name="Paul Martin Lester"/&gt; These paintings contained increasing amounts of information: people may have created the first [[calendar]] as far back as 15,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="rappenglueck"/&gt; The connection between drawing and writing is further shown by [[linguistics]]: in  [[Ancient Egypt]] and [[Ancient Greece]] the concepts and words of drawing and writing were one and the same (Egyptian: 's-sh', Greek: 'graphein').&lt;ref name="David Diringer BBP"/&gt;

==Petroglyphs==
{{Details|Petroglyphs}}
[[File:Haljesta.jpg|thumb|right|92x92px|Petroglyphs from [[Häljesta]], Sweden. Nordic [[Bronze Age]] ]]

The next advancement in the history of communications came with the production of [[petroglyph]]s, carvings into a rock surface. It took about 20,000 years for homo sapiens to move from the first cave paintings to the first petroglyphs, which are dated to approximately the Neolithic and late Upper Paleolithic boundary, about 10,000 to 12,000 years ago.

It is possible that humans of that time used some other forms of communication, often for [[mnemonic]] purposes - specially arranged stones, symbols carved in wood or earth, [[quipu]]-like ropes, [[tattoo]]s, but little other than the most durable carved stones has survived to modern times and we can only speculate about their existence based on our observation of still existing 'hunter-gatherer' cultures such as those of [[Africa]] or [[Oceania]].&lt;ref name="David Diringer HotA"/&gt;

==Pictograms==
{{Details|Pictograms}}
[[File:Piktograf1.png|thumb|right|150px|Pictograph from 1510 telling a story of coming of [[missionaries]] to [[Hispaniola]] ]]

A [[pictogram]] (pictograph) is a [[symbol]] representing a [[concept]], [[Object (philosophy)|object]], activity, place or event by [[illustration]]. Pictography is a form of [[proto-writing]] whereby [[idea]]s are transmitted through [[drawing]]. Pictographs were the next step in the evolution of communication: the most important difference between petroglyphs and pictograms is that petroglyphs are simply showing an event, but
pictograms are telling a story about the event, thus they can for example be ordered [[chronological]]ly.

Pictograms were used by various ancient [[culture]]s all over the world since around 9000&amp;nbsp;BC, when tokens marked with simple pictures began to be used to label basic farm produce, and become increasingly popular around 6000–5000&amp;nbsp;BC.

They were the basis of [[Cuneiform (script)|cuneiform]] &lt;ref name="Linguistics 201: The Invention of Writing"/&gt; and [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]], and began to develop into [[logogram|logographic]] [[writing system]]s around 5000&amp;nbsp;BC.

==Ideograms==
{{Details|Ideograms}}
[[File:Our Father in heaven - Mikmaq hierogl.gif|frame|right|The beginning of the Lord's Prayer in [[Míkmaq hieroglyphic writing]]. The text reads ''Nujjinen wásóq'' – "Our father / in heaven".]]

Pictograms, in turn, evolved into ideograms, graphical symbols that represent an [[idea]]. Their ancestors, the pictograms, could represent only something resembling their form: therefore a pictogram of a circle could represent a sun, but not concepts like 'heat', 'light', 'day' or 'Great God of the Sun'. Ideograms, on the other hand, could convey more abstract concepts, so that for example an ideogram of two sticks can mean not only 'legs' but also a verb 'to walk'.

Because some ideas are universal, many different cultures developed similar ideograms. For example, an eye with a tear means 'sadness' in [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] ideograms in [[California]], as it does for the [[Aztec]]s, the early [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] and the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]]. {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Ideograms were precursors of [[logogram|logographic writing systems]] such as [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] and [[Chinese character]]s. {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Examples of ideographical proto-writing systems, thought not to contain language-specific information, include the [[Vinca script]] (see also [[Tărtăria tablets]]) and the early [[Indus script]]. {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} In both cases there are claims of decipherment of linguistic content, without wide acceptance. {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

==Writing==
{{Details|History of writing}}
[[File:Sumerian 26th c Adab.jpg|thumb|250px|26th century&amp;nbsp;BC Sumerian [[cuneiform script]] in [[Sumerian language]], listing gifts to the high priestess of [[Adab (city)|Adab]] on the occasion of her election. One of the earliest examples of human [[writing]].]]

The oldest-known forms of writing were primarily [[logogram|logographic]] in nature, based on [[pictogram|pictographic]] and [[ideogram|ideographic]] elements. Most writing systems can be broadly divided into three categories: ''logographic'', ''syllabic'' and ''alphabetic'' (or ''segmental''); however, all three may be found in any given writing system in varying  proportions, often making it difficult to categorise a system uniquely.

The invention of the first [[writing system]]s is roughly contemporary with the beginning of the [[Bronze Age]] in the late [[Neolithic]] of the late 4000&amp;nbsp;BC. The first writing system is generally believed to have been invented in pre-historic [[Sumer]] and developed by the late [[3rd millennium BC|3000's&amp;nbsp;BC]] into [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]]. [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], and the undeciphered [[Proto-Elamite]] writing system and [[Indus script|Indus Valley script]] also date to this era, though a few scholars have questioned the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley]] script's status as a writing system.

The original Sumerian writing system was derived from a system of [[clay]] [[Token coin|tokens]] used to represent [[commodities]]. By the end of the 4th millennium&amp;nbsp;BC, this had evolved into a method of keeping [[Account (accountancy)|accounts]], using a round-shaped [[stylus]] impressed into soft clay at different angles for recording [[number]]s. This was gradually augmented with pictographic writing using a sharp stylus to indicate what was being counted. Round-stylus and sharp-stylus writing was gradually replaced about 2700–2000&amp;nbsp;BC by writing using a wedge-shaped stylus (hence the term [[cuneiform script|cuneiform]]), at first only for [[logogram]]s, but developed to include [[phonetic]] elements by the 2800&amp;nbsp;BC. About 2600&amp;nbsp;BC cuneiform began to represent syllables of spoken [[Sumerian language]].

Finally, cuneiform writing became a general purpose writing system for [[logogram]]s, [[syllable]]s, and numbers. By the 26th century&amp;nbsp;BC, this script had been adapted to another Mesopotamian language, [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], and from there to others such as [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]], and [[Hittite language|Hittite]]. Scripts similar in appearance to this writing system include those for [[Ugaritic language|Ugaritic]] and [[Old Persian language|Old Persian]].

The [[Chinese script]] may have originated independently of the Middle Eastern scripts, around the 16th century&amp;nbsp;BC (early [[Shang Dynasty]]), out of a late neolithic Chinese system of proto-writing dating back to c. 6000&amp;nbsp;BC. The pre-Columbian writing systems of the [[Americas]], including [[Olmec]] and [[Maya script|Mayan]], are also generally believed to have had independent origins.

===Alphabet===
{{Details|History of the alphabet}}
[[File:A Specimen by William Caslon.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''A Specimen'' of typeset fonts and languages, by [[William Caslon]], letter founder; from the 1728 ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]''.]]

The first pure [[alphabet]]s (properly, "[[abjad]]s", mapping single symbols to single phonemes, but not necessarily each phoneme to a symbol) emerged around 2000&amp;nbsp;BC in [[Ancient Egypt]], but by then alphabetic principles had already been incorporated into [[Egyptian hieroglyph]]s for a millennium (see [[Middle Bronze Age alphabets]]).

By 2700&amp;nbsp;BC, Egyptian writing had a set of some [[Egyptian hieroglyph#Uniliteral signs|22 hieroglyphs]] to represent syllables that begin with a single [[consonant]] of their language, plus a vowel (or no vowel) to be supplied by the native speaker. These glyphs were used as pronunciation guides for [[logogram]]s, to write grammatical inflections, and, later, to transcribe loan words and foreign names.

However, although seemingly alphabetic in nature, the original Egyptian uniliterals were not a system and were never used by themselves to encode Egyptian speech. In the [[Middle Bronze Age]] an apparently "alphabetic" system is thought by some to have been developed in central [[Egypt]] around 1700&amp;nbsp;BC for or by [[Semitic people|Semitic]] workers, but we cannot read these early writings and their exact nature remains open to interpretation.

Over the next five centuries this Semitic "alphabet" (really a [[syllabary]] like [[Phoenician writing]]) seems to have spread north. All subsequent alphabets around the world{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} with the sole exception of Korean [[Hangul]] have either descended from it, or been inspired by one of its descendants.

==History of telecommunication==
{{Details|History of telecommunication}}
The [[history of telecommunication]] - the [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] of [[Signal (electrical engineering)|signals]] over a distance for the purpose of [[communication]] - began thousands of years ago with the use of [[smoke signal]]s and [[drum (communication)|drums]] in [[Africa]], [[United States|America]] and parts of [[Asia]]. In the 1790s the first fixed [[Semaphore line|semaphore systems]] emerged in [[Europe]] however it was not until the 1830s that [[electrical]] [telecommunication] systems started to appear.

{{Legal education in the United States}}
A '''legal clinic''' (also '''law clinic''' or '''law school clinic''') is a [[law school]] program providing hands-on-legal experience to law school students and [[Legal aid|services]] to various clients.  Clinics are usually directed by clinical professors.&lt;ref&gt;''Black's Law Dictionary, 6th Edition,'' "clinical legal studies," (St. Paul, Minn: West Publishing Co., 1990), 254&lt;/ref&gt;  Legal clinics typically do ''[[pro bono]]'' work in a particular area, providing free legal services to clients.

A legal clinic or law clinic is a nonprofit law practice serving the public interest. Legal clinics originated as a method of practical teaching of law school students, but today they encompass also free [[legal aid]] with no academic links.&lt;ref&gt;M. Yakasai, "Meaning of a Legal Clinic',2016&lt;/ref&gt; There are practice-based law clinics with no academic link which provide hands-on skills to lawyers, judges and non-lawyers on practical ethical dimensions of the law at the same time offer free public defence legal services.&lt;ref&gt;International organizations,lextern web,2017(https://www.lexternweb.org/international-organizations)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Need and importance==
According to Avani Bansal, In cases where parties cannot afford a [[lawyer]] and are provided legal services by the state, the quality of that legal representation is often questionable. Therefore the need for clinical legal education, or establishing [[legal aid]] clinics at law schools, where law students can provide [[legal advice]] to indigent people.&lt;ref name="Avani Bansal"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bansal|first1=Avani|title=Clinical legal education as a means to means to advance to advance access to justice in India|url=http://www.livelaw.in/clinical-legal-education-means-advance-access-justice-india/ Part 1 &amp; Part 2|website=livelaw.in|publisher=livelaw.in|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals, objectives &amp; Methods ==
Students typically provide assistance with research, drafting legal arguments, and meeting with clients. In many cases, one of the clinic's professors will show up for [[oral argument]] before the Court. However, many jurisdictions have "student practice" rules that allow law-clinic students to appear and argue in court.&lt;ref&gt;Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XX,http://www.lasc.org/rules/supreme/RuleXX.asp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Uniform Local Rules Of The United States District Courts For The Eastern, Middle, And Western Districts Of Louisiana, LR83.2.13, {{cite web |url=http://www.laed.uscourts.gov/LocalRules/Civil_83.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703173017/http://www.laed.uscourts.gov/LocalRules/Civil_83.htm |archivedate=2008-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Areas of service==
[[File:Legal clinic - case files.JPG|thumb|Legal clinic - case files at [[Palacký University]] Faculty of Law Legal Clinic]]
Clinical legal studies exist in diverse areas such as immigration law, [[environmental law]], intellectual property, housing, criminal defense, criminal prosecution, American Indian law, human rights and international criminal law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uu.nl/legalclinic "404 - Universiteit Utrecht", University Utrecht School of Law Clinical Programme on Conflict, Human Rights and International Justice], retrieved March 16, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Clinics sometimes sue big companies and government entities, which has led to pushback in courts and legislatures, including attempts to put limits on whom clinics can sue without losing state subsidies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/04/us/04lawschool.html?hp|title=School Law Clinics Face a Backlash|last=Urbina|first=Ian|date=April 3, 2010|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|access-date=4 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Pro Bono Net===
[[Pro Bono Net]] are online [[Legal aid]] services, in some cases supported by legal clinics.&lt;ref name="Avani Bansal" /&gt;

==Obstacles==
While in many jurisdictions have "student practice" rules that allow law-clinic students to appear and argue in court.&lt;ref&gt;Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XX,http://www.lasc.org/rules/supreme/RuleXX.asp&lt;/ref&gt;, in some countries like India law students are still studying at law schools, they cannot represent the clients in courts by themselves.&lt;ref name="Avani Bansal" /&gt; 

According to Avani Bansal in many law schools, clinical legal education is imparted without the support of practical component and lacks policy. Participation in many of these legal clinics lacks academic credits. Lack of resources, lack of trained faculty for the purpose, lack of involvement of [[Bar council|Bar Council]] Members leads to ineffective and weak clinical legal education in countries like India. Communities around are not informed so are not involved. All these aspects frustrate the effective purpose of the Legal clinic in the sense that it neither trains students in practice nor it reaches to the public.&lt;ref name="Avani Bansal" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18608">This is a list of [[books]] released for the [[UK World Book Day]]. In 1998 and 1999 a specially created WBD anthology priced at [[Pound sterling|£]]1 ([[Euro|€]]1.50 in [[Ireland]]) was published. In 2000, instead of a single £1 special anthology, four separate £1 books were published, covering a wider age-range. Since then, each year has seen a new set of special £1 books published.

From 2009 to 2011 flip books were published containing stories by two different [[author]]s one starting at each end of the book. 2012 saw the return of single story books and the first [[E-book]]s published simultaneously.&lt;ref name="revert-single-books"&gt;"[http://www.thebookseller.com/news/world-book-day-titles-revert-single-books.html World Book Day titles to revert to single books | The Bookseller]"&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a list of notable albums with controversial [[album art]], especially where that controversy resulted in the album being banned, [[censorship|censored]] or sold in packaging other than the original one.  They are listed by the type of controversy they were involved in.

==Nudity and sexuality==
&lt;!--IMPORTANT! If you add an album without providing a reference or providing an explanation for why or how its album cover is "controversial", THE ALBUM WILL BE REMOVED! See discussion page.--&gt;
* [[Alice Cooper (band)|Alice Cooper]] – ''[[Love It to Death]]'' (1971)
** The album features a portrait of the original Alice Cooper band, with frontman [[Alice Cooper]] posed with his thumb protruding from underneath his cape as if it were his penis. The album was later reissued with Cooper's entire right arm airbrushed out of the photograph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Gavin |last=Edwards |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/banned-in-the-u-s-a-20-wildest-censored-album-covers-20150115 |title=Banned in the U.S.A.: 20 Wildest Censored Album Covers |publisher=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=2018-05-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180520193123/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/banned-in-the-u-s-a-20-wildest-censored-album-covers-20150115 |archivedate=2018-05-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Arca (producer)|Arca]] – ''[[Xen (album)|Xen]]'' (2014)
** The album cover is a [[computer-generated image|computer-generated]] androgynous alter-ego named Xen. With her head tilted back, Xen displays her broad shoulders, breasts, and large hips on the album cover with her skin rippling "as if about to peel and fall off."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/558-new-flesh-jesse-kandas-music-videos-subvert-the-myth-of-the-feminine-pristine/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623100145/http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/558-new-flesh-jesse-kandas-music-videos-subvert-the-myth-of-the-feminine-pristine/ |archivedate=2015-06-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though no genitals appear, [[Spotify]] and [[iTunes]] [[Pixelization|pixelate]] the area, as well as the breasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://play.spotify.com/album/5FLsmazQWaDK9JGqdzHlN4|title=Xen|date=3 November 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/xen/id915861599|title=Xen by Arca|date=4 November 2014|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150417200346/https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/xen/id915861599|archivedate=17 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Biffy Clyro]] – ''[[The Vertigo of Bliss]]'' (2003)
** The cover shows a woman sitting down with her hand up her dress, presumably [[Masturbation|masturbating]], with a look of pleasure on her face. The controversy of the album cover is accompanied by the erotic artwork of the singles "[[The Ideal Height]]", "[[Questions and Answers (Biffy Clyro song)|Questions and Answers]]" and "[[Eradicate the Doubt]]" (all designed by [[Milo Manara]]). Despite being considered offensive and sexist by some, ''[[ShortList]]'' magazine praised the band for their bravery and originality when they mentioned it in their list of "50 Coolest Album Covers Ever".
* [[The Black Crowes]] – ''[[Amorica]]'' (1994)
** The album cover's depiction of [[pubic hair]], taken from an issue of ''[[Hustler]]'' magazine, caused controversy.&lt;ref name="Boston Globe"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Morse |first=Steve |title=The Black Crowes: Rock rebels take home-grown spirit on tour  |publisher=''[[The Boston Globe]]'' |page=18 |date=March 23, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; The image was replaced with a black background cover which blacked out the hair.
* [[Blind Faith]] – ''[[Blind Faith (Blind Faith album)|Blind Faith]]'' (1969)
** The cover featured a topless [[puberty|pubescent]] girl, holding in her hands a silver space ship, which some perceived as [[phallic]]. Photographer [[Bob Seidemann]] used a girl, Mariora Goschen, who was 11 years old.&lt;ref name=bestcovers&gt;{{cite book |title=100 Best Album Covers: The Stories Behind the Sleeves |last=Thorgerson |first= Storm |author2=Powell, Aubrey  |year=1999 |publisher=Dorling Kindersley |isbn=0-7513-0706-8  |page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article2870010.ece Interview with Mariora Goschen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517065455/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article2870010.ece |date=2011-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baacorsham.co.uk/cached/MarioraGoshen.htm|title=Mariora Goschen|website=www.baacorsham.co.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608094747/http://www.baacorsham.co.uk/cached/MarioraGoshen.htm|archivedate=2010-06-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US record company issued it with an alternative cover which showed a photograph of the band on the front.
* [[Bon Jovi]] – ''[[Slippery When Wet]]'' (1986)
** The album originally was to feature a busty, 34DD woman in a wet yellow T-shirt with the album name on the front of the shirt. However, the artwork was rejected because record executives feared that the dominant record store chains at the time would not sell the album with a sexist cover, or [[Jon Bon Jovi]]'s complaint that the record company had put a bright pink border around the photograph that the band had submitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegauntlet.com/article/1225/12753/top-10-banned-metal-album-covers.html|title=The Gauntlet - Top 10 Banned Metal Album Covers|website=www.thegauntlet.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727082844/http://www.thegauntlet.com/article/1225/12753/top-10-banned-metal-album-covers.html|archivedate=2014-07-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/bon-jovi-most-shocking-album-covers/|title=Bon Jovi – Most Shocking Album Covers|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811215521/http://ultimateclassicrock.com/bon-jovi-most-shocking-album-covers/|archivedate=2014-08-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the cover was changed before the album's release to an image of a wet garbage bag with the words "Slippery When Wet" written on it.
* [[Bow Wow Wow]] – ''[[See Jungle! See Jungle! Go Join Your Gang Yeah, City All Over! Go Ape Crazy!]]'' (1981)
** The cover of the album features a rendition of [[Édouard Manet]]’s painting ''[[Le Déjeuner sur l’herbe]]'' featuring the band members. The band's then-14-year old lead singer [[Annabella Lwin]] is nude on the cover. The cover caused outrage in the United Kingdom that led to an investigation by [[Scotland Yard]], instigated by Lwin's mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Craig |last=McLean |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/apr/19/bow-wow-wow-leigh-gorman-annabella-lwin |title=Bow Wow Wow haven't lost their bite &amp;#124; Music |publisher=theguardian.com |accessdate=2014-02-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228130803/http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/apr/19/bow-wow-wow-leigh-gorman-annabella-lwin |archivedate=2014-02-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cover was replaced, and never appeared on the American issue.
* [[Chumbawamba]] – ''[[Anarchy (Chumbawamba album)|Anarchy]]'' (1994)
** The cover originally depicted a baby's head emerging from a woman's vagina during birth. As some stores would not sell the album due to the cover, the baby image was replaced with an image of several flowers.
* [[Cradle of Filth]] – ''[[Thornography]]'' (2006)
** In news posted on the official Cradle of Filth website in mid-May 2006, it was revealed that the planned artwork for ''Thornography'' had been vetoed by [[Roadrunner Records]]. A replacement was soon forthcoming, although numerous CD booklets had already been printed with the original image. The controversy was over the nakedness of the female figure's legs on the original cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/cradle-of-filth-thornography-cover-banned-in-the-u-s/ |title=Blabbermouth - Cradle cover banned |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427202131/http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/cradle-of-filth-thornography-cover-banned-in-the-u-s/ |archivedate=2014-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[David Bowie]] – ''[[Diamond Dogs]]'' (1973)
** The album features Bowie as a half-dog half-man hybrid, and the back cover features the creature's genitals. Following controversy, later copies of the album have the genitals airbrushed out of the painting.&lt;ref name="stonelist"/&gt;
* [[Dead Kennedys]] – ''[[Frankenchrist]]'' (1985)
** A poster inserted in the original record sleeve, [[H. R. Giger]]'s ''Landscape #XX'', or ''[[Penis Landscape]]'', was a painting depicting rows of penises in sexual intercourse. The band and its record label [[Alternative Tentacles]] were brought to criminal trial for distributing harmful matter to minors.&lt;ref name=WishniaNation&gt;Wishnia, Steven.

Additionally, the album's actual cover – a 1970s ''[[Newsweek]]'' photograph of [[Shriners]] in a parade – prompted a 1986 lawsuit from the four elderly Shriners included in the photograph.&lt;ref name=united-press-shriners-suit-1986&gt;{{cite news|title=Album Cover Prompts Suit From Shriners|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1986-10-03/news/8602280346_1_four-shriners-record-store-album|accessdate=4 September 2015|agency=United Press International|publisher=Sun Sentinel|date=October 3, 1986|ref=united-press-shriners-suit-1986|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151128065359/http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1986-10-03/news/8602280346_1_four-shriners-record-store-album|archivedate=28 November 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Death Grips]] – ''[[No Love Deep Web]]'' (2012)
** The cover shows the erect penis of drummer [[Zach Hill]] with the album's title written in black marker. The cover caused such controversy, along with its spontaneous release without their label's permission, that the band were forced to put a disclaimer on their website. An alternative cover was subsequently released depicting a man wearing socks with the words "Suck my dick" on them.
* [[Emerson, Lake and Palmer]] — ''[[Brain Salad Surgery]]'' (1973)
** The cover was taken from a triptych by [[H. R. Giger]], which was produced based on ELP’s music. The artwork features a phallus below a woman’s chin, which was later airbrushed into a shaft of glowing light by another artist.
* [[Frenzal Rhomb]] – ''[[Dick Sandwich]]'' (1994)
** The cover shows several severed penises, some of which are being used as filling in a sandwich. They were subsequently banned from some venues and record stores.&lt;ref name="Nim"&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl = http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/14231/20020415-0000/www.howlspace.com.au/en3/frenzalrhomb/frenzalrhomb.htm | url = http://www.howlspace.com.au/en3/frenzalrhomb/frenzalrhomb.htm | title = Frenzal Rhomb | last = Nimmervoll | first = Ed | authorlink = Ed Nimmervoll | publisher = Howlspace – The Living History of Our Music.

* [[Gob (band)|Gob]] – ''Dildozer'' (1995)
** The cover for the EP depicted a crowd of people being chased through a city by a massive bulldozer with a [[penis]] attached to it. The cover also has the title with a penis in place of the "I". Many stores refused to carry the EP because of the cover. As of 2000, ''Dildozer'' is [[out of print]].
* [[Guns N' Roses]] – ''[[Appetite for Destruction]]'' (1987)
** The album's original [[cover art]], based on [[Robert Williams (artist)|Robert Williams]]' painting "Appetite for Destruction", depicted an open-shirted woman leaning against a wooden fence after clearly being raped by a robotic rapist which is about to be crushed by a dagger-toothed monster. After several music retailers refused to stock the album, the label compromised and moved the offending image to the inside sleeve, replacing it with a new image depicting a cross and skulls of the five band members.&lt;ref name="musicstak.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.musicstack.com/articles/historic-controversial-album-covers-part-two |title=Album cover info at |publisher=Musicstack.com |date=February 9, 2009 |accessdate=November 11, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100817010302/http://www.musicstack.com/articles/historic-controversial-album-covers-part-two |archivedate=August 17, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The band stated the artwork is "a symbolic social statement, with the robot representing the industrial system that's raping and polluting our environment."&lt;ref name="AfDcover"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-08-16/entertainment/ca-1533_1_artwork |title=Geffen's Guns N' Roses Fires A Volley At PMRC |last1=Goldstein |first1=Patrick |date=August 16, 1987 |website=LATimes.com |access-date=June 9, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623121611/http://articles.latimes.com/1987-08-16/entertainment/ca-1533_1_artwork |archivedate=June 23, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[The Hotelier]] – ''[[Goodness (The Hotelier album)|Goodness]]'' (2016)
** The album cover shows a group of middle-aged [[naturism|nudists]] posing in the middle of a forest. The group consists of five women and three men. The album cover was completely pixelated for its iTunes release,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/goodness/id1093222186|title=Goodness by The Hotelier|date=27 May 2016|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160607084954/https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/goodness/id1093222186|archivedate=7 June 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many online news outlets overlaid a black box over the explicit areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soundinthesignals.com/2016/02/the-hotelier-goodness-album.html|title=The Hotelier - Goodness (Album Artwork/Track List/Vinyl Details)|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617002600/http://www.soundinthesignals.com/2016/02/the-hotelier-goodness-album.html|archivedate=2016-06-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[The Jimi Hendrix Experience]] – ''[[Electric Ladyland]]'' (1968)
** The intended artwork for the UK version of the album did not arrive in time to press the album, so a cover of naked women lounging in front of a black background was issued in its place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cracked.com/article_20196_6-alternate-album-covers-you-wont-believe-almost-happened_p2.html|title=6 Alternate Album Covers You Won't Believe Almost Happened|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140829000053/http://www.cracked.com/article_20196_6-alternate-album-covers-you-wont-believe-almost-happened_p2.html|archivedate=2014-08-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Hendrix did NOT like the Ferris cover either. Due diligence. See the article linked above. --&gt;
* [[John Lennon]] &amp; [[Yoko Ono]] – ''[[Unfinished Music No. 1: Two Virgins|Unfinished Music No.1: Two Virgins]]'' (1968)
** The front cover displayed Lennon and Ono frontally nude, while the rear cover featured them from behind. Distributors were prompted to sell the album in a plain brown wrapper,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/asia/2003/heroes/yoko_ono.html Yoko Ono] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502000218/http://www.time.com/time/asia/2003/heroes/yoko_ono.html |date=2009-05-02 }}, Time magazine&lt;/ref&gt; and copies of the album were impounded as obscenity in several jurisdictions.&lt;ref name=StickeredStock&gt;{{cite journal|last=Christman|first=Ed|title=Stickered Stock: Retail's Reaction To Increased Responsibility|journal=Billboard|date=26 March 1994|page=42|volume=106|issue=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Kanye West]] - "[[Cold (Kanye West song)|Cold]]" (2012) (Single)
** The cover designed by [[George Condo]] features a woman body with bare [[breasts]]. It was intended to be the cover art of the song when the name was "Theraflu". When Kanye West changed the name of the song to "Cold", a new cover was revealed, which also caused controversies for bare breasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/earshot/kanye-west-theraflu-name-change-way-too-cold-312198|title=Kanye West's Theraflu changes title and artwork|publisher=HollywoodReporter|accessdate=June 3, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180522041436/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/earshot/kanye-west-theraflu-name-change-way-too-cold-312198|archivedate=May 22, 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Kanye West]]  – ''[[My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy]]'' (2010)
** The cover originally showed a painting by [[George Condo]] depicting West being straddled by a [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]]. As certain retail stores refused to sell the album due to the cover, Condo created a less-offensive artwork, showing a ballerina with a glass of cherry juice. However, many versions of the album still feature the original artwork, but pixelated.
* [[Led Zeppelin]] – ''[[Houses of the Holy]]'' (1973)
** The [[Hipgnosis]] cover, based on the novel ''[[Childhood's End]]'' by [[Arthur C. Clarke]], features a group of naked children ascending the [[Giant's Causeway]]. The interior art also depicts a distant figure of a naked Overlord standing on mossy ruins (nearby [[Dunluce Castle]]) while holding one of the children aloft in a ceremonial gesture. Although the album was originally released with the nudity intact, [[Atlantic Records]] were allowed to add a wrap-around paper title band to US and UK copies of the sleeve that had to be broken or slid off to access the record.&lt;ref&gt;Dave Lewis (1994), ''The Complete Guide to the Music of Led Zeppelin'', Omnibus Press, {{ISBN|0-7119-3528-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hid the children's buttocks from general display, but still the album was either banned or unavailable in some parts of the Southern United States for several years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dangerousage.com/householy.html Classic Rock Covers: Led Zeppelin; ''Houses of the Holy''.

* [[Lady Gaga]] – ''[[Artpop]]'' (2013)
** The album artwork is a sculpture of Lady Gaga by [[Jeff Koons]] with her legs open and a [[Yard globe|gazing ball]] placed between them. Although no nudity is visible on the artwork, the album cover was still censored in the [[Middle East]] and [[China]]. Rather than traditional [[censorship]], the gazing ball between her legs was enlarged to fully cover her breasts, and her legs were colored black so they don't appear naked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gigwise.com/news/87840/lady-gagas-artpop-cover-gets-photoshopped-for-censored-china-release|title=Lady Gaga's ARTPOP cover gets photoshopped for censored China release|website=www.gigwise.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623094057/http://www.gigwise.com/news/87840/lady-gagas-artpop-cover-gets-photoshopped-for-censored-china-release|archivedate=2015-06-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Lady Gaga]] – "[[Do What U Want]]" featuring [[R. Kelly]] (2013) (Single)
** The single cover is a close-up of Lady Gaga's buttocks wearing a blue, floral [[Thong (clothing)|thong]]. Lady Gaga's blonde wig hangs just above her thong-clad buttocks. The image was taken by photographer [[Terry Richardson]]. A censored version of the cover featuring a pale mauve coloured skirt edited over the top of her buttocks was used in selected countries in the [[Middle East]].
* [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]] – ''[[Mechanical Animals]]'' (1998)
** The cover shows a picture of a naked [[Marilyn Manson]] with airbrushed genitalia. Some retail stores, including [[Wal-Mart]] and [[Kmart]], refused to stock the album.
* [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]] – ''[[Dark Side of the Spoon]]'' (1999)
** The album's cover depicts a naked obese woman seated in front of a blackboard where the words "I will be god" are written numerous times. The album was banned from [[Kmart]] due to the offending cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/photos/warning-these-album-covers-may-contain-explicit-content/1572579/2643346/photo.jhtml |title=Ministry's Dark Side Of The Spoon (1999) was banned by Kmart due to its cover. |date=2007-10-26 |publisher=MTV |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125054719/http://www.mtv.com/photos/warning-these-album-covers-may-contain-explicit-content/1572579/2643346/photo.jhtml |archivedate=2012-01-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the album's insert, the same woman covers her breasts with her hands, and her [[Buttocks|behind]] is also exposed on both the insert and back cover. The woman and the words on the blackboard were later airbrushed out.
* [[Mom's Apple Pie]] – ''[[Mom's Apple Pie]]'' (1972)
** The album was originally released with the album cover featuring a woman licking her lips and holding a pie with a slice removed showing a subtle depiction of a woman's [[vulva]] and some [[semen]] leaking from the pie. The cover was later reprinted with the vulva replaced by a miniature brick wall, topped with razor wire and removing the semen.
* [[Nicki Minaj]] – "[[Anaconda (Nicki Minaj song)|Anaconda]]" (2014) (Single)
** The artwork for this digital single depicts the subject with her back towards the camera, emphasizing her [[Thong (clothing)|thong]]-clad buttocks. Some stores censored this art by obscuring the buttocks with the [[Parental Advisory]] seal, or a black box on the edited version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/jul/25/nicki-minaj-anaconda-cover-too-sexy-instagram|title=Nicki Minaj's Anaconda cover artwork: too racy for its own good?|first=Tshepo|last=Mokoena|date=25 July 2014|website=the Guardian|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120170558/http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/jul/25/nicki-minaj-anaconda-cover-too-sexy-instagram|archivedate=20 January 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] – ''[[Nevermind]]'' (1991)
** The album cover featured a naked baby with his penis exposed, swimming after a dollar bill. Chain stores such as [[Wal-Mart]] and [[Kmart]] initially refused to carry ''Nevermind''. However, eventually due to such high demand, Nirvana compromised and put a sticker that read "If you're offended by this, you must be a closet pedophile" over the genitals.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad 1993, p. 180–81&lt;/ref&gt; Nirvana saw continued controversy for their next album, ''[[In Utero (album)|In Utero]]''.
* [[NOFX]] – ''[[Heavy Petting Zoo]]'' (1996)
** The album features two covers, one for the CD version and one for the LP version; both of them caused controversy. The CD version features a man sitting down on the ground in a petting zoo cuddling a sheep with his hand on the sheep's genitalia area. The LP version sparked even more controversy than the CD version, as it features the same man in a [[69 (sex position)|69 position]] with the same sheep. The album is known as ''Eating Lamb'' on the LP. The LP version was banned from [[Germany]] due to the cover's subject matter.
* [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] – ''[[Mother's Milk]]'' (1989)
** The album cover features a black and white photograph of the band sprawled across the arms of a proportionately larger naked woman. A rose conceals one of her nipples while singer [[Anthony Kiedis]]' standing body conceals the other. Several national chains refused to sell the record because they believed the female subject displayed too much nudity. A stricter censored version was manufactured for some retailers that featured the band members in far larger proportion than the original.&lt;ref name=apterartwork&gt;Apter, 2004. pp. 196–197&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Rob Zombie]] – ''[[Mondo Sex Head]]'' (2012)
** The cover features a nude female's buttocks, but after controversy arose, it was replaced by an image of a cat, which was referred to as a "[[pussy]] shot".&lt;ref name="rollingstone"&gt;{{cite web| title = Rob Zombie Unveils 'Mondo Sex Head' Album Art| work = [[Rolling Stone]]| date = July 2, 2012| url = https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/q-a-rob-zombie-on-his-new-album-art-20120702| accessdate = November 10, 2012| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130105232311/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/q-a-rob-zombie-on-his-new-album-art-20120702| archivedate = January 5, 2013| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Roger Waters]] – ''[[The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking]]'' (1984)
** The cover features a rear-view and nude image of model and pornography actress [[Linzi Drew]]. It was condemned by many feminist groups and was also accused of promoting rape. [[Columbia Records]] was forced to place a black box covering the nudity for future releases to avoid more controversy.
* [[Roxy Music]] – ''[[Country Life (Roxy Music album)|Country Life]]'' (1974)
** The album features scantily clad models Constanze Karoli and Eveline Grunwald – the sister and girlfriend, respectively, of [[Can (band)|Can]] guitarist [[Michael Karoli]] – posed in front of a bush. Although no nudity is directly shown in the photograph, Grunwald is topless. For a later American release of the album, the front cover was replaced by mirroring the photograph on the album's back cover, which features the foliage and forest, but neither woman.&lt;ref name="billboardlist"&gt;{{cite web|title=20 Banned Album Covers {{!}} Billboard|url=http://www.billboard.com/photos/426842/20-banned-album-covers/1|website=Billboard|accessdate=7 October 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920201101/http://www.billboard.com/photos/426842/20-banned-album-covers/1|archivedate=20 September 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]] – ''[[Virgin Killer]]'' (1976)

Retrieved on 3 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; prompting Anderson to comment, "I chose it because of the ambiguity of it, but mostly because of the beauty of it." The cover image of the androgynous kissing couple was taken from the 1991 book ''Stolen Glances: Lesbians Take Photographs'' edited by Tessa Boffin and Jean Fraser. The photograph was taken by [[Tee Corinne]] and in its entirety shows a woman kissing an acquaintance in a wheelchair.&lt;ref name="B114"&gt;Barnett, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[The Strokes]] – ''[[Is This It]]'' (2001)
** The original cover art featured a photograph of a woman's nude bottom and hip, with a leather-gloved hand suggestively resting on it.

This decision was made by frontman [[Julian Casablancas]] because he liked this image more than the original cover, and was independent of any controversy or label demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,254810,00.html|title=Hear &amp; Now|author=Willman, Chris|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=September 14, 2001|accessdate=November 20, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425175122/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,254810,00.html|archivedate=April 25, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

** The cover features a stained-glass image of an African-American [[Jesus]] wearing a red bandanna across his lower face, a [[Jesus Piece (jewelry)|Jesus piece]] necklace, and a [[teardrop tattoo]]. After the [[Roman Catholic Church]] complained to [[Interscope Records]] about the cover, Game decided to make this cover for the deluxe edition and use a different cover for the standard edition. The standard cover features a black-and-white photo of the rapper's deceased brother Jevon Danell Taylor, who died on May 21, 1995 at the age of 20 after being shot.
* [[Jimi Hendrix]] – ''[[Axis: Bold as Love]]'' (1967)

** The cover depicts a mutilated, stoned [[Jesus Christ|Christ]] in a sea of blood with mutilated heads. For stores who refused to sell the album with the original cover, an alternative cover was provided instead.

* [[Steve Taylor]] – ''[[I Predict 1990]]'' (1987)
** The album's cover, influenced by early 20th century French [[Neo-impressionism|neo-impressionist]] poster art and painted by Taylor's wife, was controversial with some Christian retailers who instead believed it to be a reference to [[tarot]] and [[New Age]] philosophy. The album was pulled from several stores as a result.&lt;ref name="WD_145"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Peterson |first=Doug |title=Door Magazine, This Is Your Life!

Some Christian bookstores which did not pull the album for its cover pulled it due to the song or its title, either because its critique of the pro-life movement offended store owners and customers, or because these same individuals missed the song's satirical point, and believed Taylor advocated such violence.&lt;ref name="CCM"&gt;''Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music''; Powell; p931; Hendrickson Publishers; paperback edition (August 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Tenacious D]] – ''[[Tenacious D (album)|Tenacious D]]'' (2001)
** The album cover received controversy due to its parody of [[The Devil (Tarot card)|the Devil tarot card]]. On the back of the CD were two babies locked to Satan. This caused the album to be pulled from many stores and in later US copies of the CD the babies were airbrushed out. Though for the July 2002 CD release of the album in the UK and also the 2013 re-release on vinyl, the babies were kept in.

* [[Matchbox Twenty]] – ''[[Yourself or Someone Like You]]'' (1996)
** The album's cover depicts a man with glasses wearing a shirt on his left shoulder and a pilot hat. Frank Torres, the man featured on the cover image sued the band in May 2005, claiming Matchbox Twenty had no permission from him to use his photo on the album's cover and that the photo had been the cause of mental anguish.

** The cover features the album title, "U2", as a very large logo, with the band's name in small text beneath the album. [[Island Records]] sued the band for the use of the misleading album cover because "U2" is trademark of the label. The songs on the album were controversial too, as they were versions of [[U2]]'s song "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For" which were copied without permission.
* [[Richard Pryor]] – ''[[Richard Pryor (album)|Richard Pryor]]'' (1968)
** The debut album of comedian Richard Pryor was recorded live at [[The Troubadour (Los Angeles)|The Troubadour]] in West Hollywood, California. The cover was art-directed and designed by [[Gary Burden]]. According to Burden, "As a result of the Richard Pryor album cover, which I loved doing, I got two letters: One was a letter from the [[National Geographic Society]]’s attorneys offering to sue me for defaming their publication. The second letter was a [[1970 Grammy Awards|Grammy nomination]] for the best album cover."&lt;ref&gt;[http://garyburdenforrtwerk.com/2009/09/richard-pryor/ Richard Pryor | Gary Burden For R.

* [[Sonic Youth]] – ''[[Sister (Sonic Youth album)|Sister]]'' (1987)
** The album's artwork has been edited two separate times to obscure images; the first of which was a [[Richard Avedon]] image depicting a 12-year-old girl, due to a lawsuit threat. The other instance was when an image of the [[Disney]] [[Magic Kingdom]] was deliberately covered with a barcode, likely due to copyright complaints.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sister (Sonic Youth album)#Packaging]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=October 2015}}

** The cover image, ''Boden Sea'' by [[Hiroshi Sugimoto]], had previously been used by [[Richard Chartier]] and [[Taylor Deupree]] for their 2006 album ''Specification.Fifteen''.

** Shortly after its release, the band and their label [[Verve Records]] were threatened with a lawsuit by [[Warhol superstar]] [[Eric Emerson]], whose image is projected upside-down on the back cover of the album.&lt;ref name="33 1/3"&gt;{{cite book |last=Harvard |first=Joe |title=The Velvet Underground and Nico |origyear=2004 |series=[[33⅓]] |year=2007 |publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group]] |location=New York, NY |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Af46S4wukzoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;q |isbn=0-8264-1550-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Copies of the album were withdrawn from sale so the image could be censored by a large sticker.&lt;ref name="33 1/3"/&gt; The image was restored on the 1996 compact disc release of the album.

* [[The Beatles]] – ''[[Yesterday and Today]]'' (1966)
** In early 1966, photographer [[Robert Whitaker (photographer)|Robert Whitaker]] had the Beatles in the studio for a [[conceptual art]] piece titled ''A Somnambulant Adventure''. For the shoot, Whitaker took a series of pictures of the group dressed in butcher smocks and draped with pieces of meat and body parts from plastic baby dolls. The group played along as they were tired of the usual photo shoots—Lennon recalled the band having "boredom and resentment at having to do ''another'' photo session and ''another'' Beatles thing"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sheff|first=David|title=All We Are Saying: The Last Major Interview with John Lennon and Yoko Ono|year=2000|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9780312254643|page=219}}&lt;/ref&gt;—and the concept was compatible with their own black humour.&lt;ref name="Anthology"&gt;The Beatles. (2000). ''[[The Beatles Anthology]]'', San Francisco, CA: Chronicle Books LLC. {{ISBN|0-8118-2684-8}}, 204–205&lt;/ref&gt; Although not originally intended as an album cover, the Beatles submitted photographs from the session for their promotional materials. According to a 2002 interview published in ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'', former Capitol president [[Alan W. Livingston]] stated that it was [[Paul McCartney]] who pushed strongly for the photo's inclusion as the album cover, and that McCartney reportedly described it as "our comment on the [[Vietnam War|[Vietnam] war]]".&lt;ref name="roadshow"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/roadshow/fts/jackpot_200302A14.html |title=Antiques Roadshow &amp;#124; Follow the Stories &amp;#124; The Beatles' "Butcher" Cover &amp;#124; PBS |first=Dennis |last=Gaffney |date=27 October 2008 |work=PBS.org |accessdate=9 February 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925034827/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/roadshow/fts/jackpot_200302A14.html |archivedate=25 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A photograph of the band smiling amid the mock carnage was used as promotional advertisements for the British release of the "[[Paperback Writer]]" single. In the United States, [[Capitol Records]] printed approximately 750,000 copies of ''Yesterday and Today'' with the same photograph as "Paperback Writer".&lt;ref name="Schaffner2"&gt;[[Nicholas Schaffner|Schaffner, Nicholas]].

* [[Cannibal Corpse]] – Various albums (1990–2006)
** [[Death metal]] band Cannibal Corpse's albums were all banned from Germany until 2006 due to their graphic album covers and disturbing lyrics. The band was also forbidden to play any songs from those albums while touring in Germany. This prohibition was not lifted until June 2006. In an interview from 2004, George Fisher attempted to recall what originally provoked the ban: "A woman saw someone wearing one of our shirts, I think she is a schoolteacher, and she just caused this big stink about it. So [now] we can't play anything from the first three records. And it really sucks because kids come up and they want us to play all the old songs — and we would — but they know the deal. We can't play 'Born in a Casket' but can play 'Dismembered and Molested."&lt;ref name=innerview&gt;{{cite web|last=Falina|first=Melanie|title=Cannibal Corpse Just Wants to Sing About Ripping Apart Human Flesh in Peace|work=Chicago Innerview|publisher=Innerview Media, Inc|date=February 2004|url=http://www.chicagoinnerview.com/archives/feb04_cannibal_corpse.htm|accessdate=February 5, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090311003400/http://www.chicagoinnerview.com/archives/feb04_cannibal_corpse.htm|archivedate=March 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tombreview&gt;{{cite web|last=Watson|first=Tyler|title=Reviews of Cannibal Corpse's 'Tomb of the Mutilated' (1992)|url=http://www.tombofthemutilated.net/Cannibal-Corpse-Tomb-Of-The-Mutilated-Review.html|publisher=tombofthemutilated.net|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013080058/http://www.tombofthemutilated.net/Cannibal-Corpse-Tomb-Of-The-Mutilated-Review.html|accessdate=February 6, 2009|archivedate=October 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[CKY (band)|CKY]] – ''[[Volume 1 (CKY album)|Volume 1]]'' (1999)
** The cover originally depicted a stylized cartoon depiction of [[R. Budd Dwyer]]'s live television suicide. After many complaints of offensiveness, the label forced the band to replace the offensive cover with a black and white cut-out of one of the band's live performances. The album was released with the band's original name Camp Kill Yourself, which was switched to CKY.&lt;ref name="dwyer"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/music/future-shock-she-wants-revenge-the-donnas-cky-and-more-6595143 |title=Future Shock: She Wants Revenge, The Donnas, CKY, And More |last=Leatherman |first=Benjamin |publisher=''[[Phoenix New Times]]'' |date=August 17, 2007 |accessdate=May 19, 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180519204543/http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/music/future-shock-she-wants-revenge-the-donnas-cky-and-more-6595143 |archivedate=May 19, 2018 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[The Coup]] – ''[[Party Music]]'' (2001)
** The original cover art, designed in June 2001, depicted Boots Riley and Pam the Funkstress destroying the [[Twin Towers (NYC)|Twin Towers]] of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]]. After the [[September 11 attacks]], the group postponed the album's release until November of that year, with the record now sporting an alternate cover depicting a hand holding a flaming martini glass.&lt;ref name="TS"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Content?oid=8708 |title=The Coup's Bomb |last=Goedde |first=Brian |publisher=''The Stranger'' |date=August 17, 2007 |accessdate=May 19, 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911223817/http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Content?oid=8708 |archivedate=September 11, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Green Day]] – ''[[Kerplunk (album)|Kerplunk]]'' (1992)
** The cover features a white picture (with some green added in) of a teenage girl wearing a flower shirt holding a smoking gun. The back cover features a boy lying on the ground with a gunshot wound on his back. Retail stores such as [[Walmart]] and [[Kmart]] initially refused to carry ''Kerplunk''. The band saw continued controversy on their next album ''[[Dookie]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2016/10/ranking-every-green-day-album-from-worst-to-best/full-post/ |title=Ranking: Every Green Day Album from Worst to Best |date=2016-10-07 |website=[[Consequence of Sound]] |language=English |access-date=2017-07-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171216201122/https://consequenceofsound.net/2016/10/ranking-every-green-day-album-from-worst-to-best/full-post/ |archivedate=2017-12-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Green Day]] – ''[[Dookie]]'' (1994)
** The cover art shows an animated picture of dogs throwing bombs and dirt on people and buildings and a huge explosion with the band's name on top of the cloud. A blimp on the left in the sky says "Bad Year" (possibly a parody of the [[Goodyear Blimp]]) and on the right is a man with a harp in a cloud. Retailers [[Walmart]] and [[Kmart]] refused to sell the album because of this. Despite the controversy, no alternative cover has existed.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} However, later printings of the album edited the back cover for copyright reasons, airbrushing out a puppet of [[Ernie (Sesame Street)|Ernie]] from ''[[Sesame Street]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feelnumb.com/2011/03/31/ernie-from-sesame-street-had-to-be-airbrushed-off-the-back-cover-of-the-green-day-album-dookie/|title=Ernie From Sesame Street Had To Be Airbrushed Off The Back Cover Of The Green Day Album “Dookie”|date=31 March 2011|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150717214105/http://www.feelnumb.com/2011/03/31/ernie-from-sesame-street-had-to-be-airbrushed-off-the-back-cover-of-the-green-day-album-dookie/|archivedate=17 July 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ice-T]] – ''[[Home Invasion (album)|Home Invasion]]'' (1993)
** The album's cover depicted a white boy listening to rap music in the midst of a home invasion in which Blacks are attacking Whites (presumably the boy's parents). [[Sire Records]], owned by [[Time Warner]], refused to release the album with the cover, and Ice-T left the label as a result.&lt;ref&gt;''The Ice Opinion'', Ice-T as dictated to Heidi Siegmund, St. Martin's Press, New York, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]] – ''[[Street Survivors]]'' (1977)
** The original cover sleeve for ''Street Survivors'' had featured a photograph of the band, particularly Steve Gaines, standing in the street of a town engulfed in flames. Three days after the album was released, three of the band members were killed in a plane crash due to fuel exhaustion. Out of respect for the deceased (and at the request of Teresa Gaines, Steve Gaines' widow), MCA Records withdrew the original cover and replaced it with a similar image of the band against a simple black background.  Thirty years later, for the deluxe CD version of Street Survivors, the original "flames" cover was restored.&lt;ref name=Check-Six&gt;{{cite web |title=The 'Lynyrd Skynyrd' Crash |url=http://www.check-six.com/Crash_Sites/LynyrdSkynyrd-N55VM.htm |work=Check-Six.com |date=May 2007 |accessdate=July 5, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AxpnRuHV?url=http://www.check-six.com/Crash_Sites/LynyrdSkynyrd-N55VM.htm |archivedate=September 26, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Manic Street Preachers]] – ''[[Journal for Plague Lovers]]'' (2009)
** The album art depicts a painting by [[Jenny Saville]].  A number of UK supermarkets deemed the red/[[ochre]] colours on the portrait to be blood, and therefore used alternative packaging to stock the item.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/may/15/manic-street-preachers-album-supermarkets Manic Street Preachers album cover censored by supermarkets] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170420234758/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/may/15/manic-street-preachers-album-supermarkets |date=2017-04-20 }} The Guardian, 15 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The alternative packaging in question is a [[longbox]], a type of outer packaging used for some CDs in the 1980s and early to mid-1990s.
* [[Metallica]] – ''[[Kill 'Em All]]'' (1983)
** The album was originally set to be titled ''Metal Up Your Ass'', with the cover featuring a toilet bowl with a hand clutching a dagger emerging from it. However, at the request of [[Megaforce Records]] (who thought the original album title would be inappropriate),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encycmet.com/biography/ |title=ENCYCLOPEDIA METALLICA – Complete history |publisher=Encycmet.com |date=September 3, 1983 |accessdate=June 21, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130710070554/http://www.encycmet.com/biography/ |archivedate=July 10, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the band changed the album title to ''Kill 'Em All''. They also changed the artwork, this time depicting a shadow of a hand releasing a bloodied hammer.
* [[The Offspring]] – ''[[The Offspring (album)|The Offspring]]'' (1989)
** The album's original artwork depicted an image of a man's body exploding as the [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|xenomorph]] from the ''[[Alien (franchise)|Alien]]'' franchise holding a [[Fender Stratocaster|Stratocaster]] guitar emerges from his chest. The album was reportedly banned for being "too grotesque",&lt;ref name="Barker"/&gt; and on the 1995 reissue, the artwork was replaced by a blurry black-and-white picture of a man. It was later admitted that the band and their studio never really liked the original artwork.
* [[Pink Floyd]] – ''[[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album)|Wish You Were Here]]'' (1975)
** The artwork depicts two men shaking hands in an alley at [[Warner Bros. Studios]], with one on fire. As some retailers deemed it "too violent" and refused the sell the album, the cover was replaced on some re-releases with a black background featuring the album's four-elements sticker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/goodlife/11574460/10-banned-album-covers.html?frame=3287295|title=10 Banned Album Covers|first=Rachel|last=Thompson|work=The Telegraph|date=1 May 2015|accessdate=24 June 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626155420/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/goodlife/11574460/10-banned-album-covers.html?frame=3287295|archivedate=26 June 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[The Mamas and the Papas]] – ''[[If You Can Believe Your Eyes and Ears]]'' (1966)
** The album cover, which features the four members in a bathtub, also featured a toilet in the far right corner. The inclusion of this toilet was controversial for the time and copies with the cover were pulled due to complaints of indecency. The copies were re-issued with a text-box pasted on top of the toilet. Later issues of the album feature both the toilet and the bathtub cropped out entirely.&lt;ref name="stonelist"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Edwards|first1=Gavin|title=Banned in the U.S.A.: 20 Wildest Censored Album Covers|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/banned-in-the-u-s-a-20-wildest-censored-album-covers-20150115|website=Rolling Stone|accessdate=4 October 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160930142116/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/banned-in-the-u-s-a-20-wildest-censored-album-covers-20150115|archivedate=30 September 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[The Rolling Stones]] – ''[[Beggars Banquet]]'' (1968)
** The original album cover featured a toilet wall which had been defaced. Mick Jagger and Keith Richards defaced the toilet wall themselves. The album cover was rejected by Decca, and kept out of shops until a new album cover was designed &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nme.com/photos/the-rolling-stones-album-artwork-secrets-revealed-the-story-behind-every-sleeve-1416155]&lt;/ref&gt;.
* [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] – ''[[In Utero (album)|In Utero]]'' (1993)
** When ''In Utero'' was released, there were many objections to the song "[[Rape Me]]", despite the band's claims that the lyrics were "anti-rape." Retailers [[Wal-Mart]] and [[Kmart]] refused to sell the album because of the back cover artwork (featuring model fetuses), so a "clean" version was released for them which featured an altered version of the back cover and listed the title "Rape Me" as "Waif Me", though the song remained unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nirvanaclub.com/get.php?section=info/general&amp;file=nfc_faq2.htm#96 Nirvana fan club FAQ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107055629/http://www.nirvanaclub.com/get.php?section=info%2Fgeneral&amp;file=nfc_faq2.htm |date=2017-11-07 }} Retrieved on 10 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ericnuzum.com/banned/incidents/90s.html Banned albums of the 90s] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621101224/http://ericnuzum.com/banned/incidents/90s.html |date=2007-06-21 }} Retrieved on 10 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The band acquiesced to the demands to change the artwork because members [[Kurt Cobain]] and [[Krist Novoselic]] were only able to buy music from the two chain stores as children; as a result they wanted to "make their music available to kids who don't have the opportunity to go to mom-and-pop stores".&lt;ref&gt;Gordinier, Jeff.

* [[Van Halen]] – ''[[Balance (Van Halen album)|Balance]]'' (1995)
** The cover in most markets features two nude conjoined twins sitting on a teeter-totter. The cover was altered in some markets, including Japan, to remove one of the twins entirely from the photograph.&lt;ref name="stonelist"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glenwexlerstudio.com/files/Resource_Balance.pdf|work=RESOURCEMAGONLINE.com|title=Van Halen: Balance|format=PDF|accessdate=October 30, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150815113325/http://www.glenwexlerstudio.com/files/Resource_Balance.pdf|archivedate=August 15, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Arctic Monkeys]] – ''[[Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not]]'' (2006)
** The cover sleeve showing Chris McClure, a friend of the band, smoking a cigarette, was criticised by the head of the [[National Health Service|NHS]] in [[Scotland]] for "reinforcing the idea that smoking is OK".&lt;ref name="smoking"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4677356.stm BBC News:Arctic Monkeys defend album cover] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225201050/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4677356.stm |date=2008-12-25 }} Retrieved on 5 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  The image on the CD itself is a shot of an ashtray full of cigarettes. The band's product manager denied the accusation, and in fact suggested the opposite — "You can see from the image smoking is not doing him the world of good".&lt;ref name="smoking"/&gt;
* [[Pusha T]] – ''[[Daytona (album)|Daytona]]'' (2018)
** The cover depicts a picture of deceased singer [[Whitney Houston]]'s bathroom showing drugs that were used by her. It was bought by [[Kanye West]] for $85,000. Houston's family stated they found the artwork "disgusting and disrespectful".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/pusha-t-daytona-album-artwork-whitney-houston/|title=Whitney Houston’s Family Calls For Pusha T’s Album Art To Be Changed|publisher=Highsnobiety|accessdate=May 31, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180527143513/https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/pusha-t-daytona-album-artwork-whitney-houston/|archivedate=May 27, 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/kanye-west-paid-85k-controversial-whitney-houston-photo/story?id=55433834|title=Kanye West uses controversial photo reportedly linked to Whitney Houston for Pusha T's album cover|publisher=[[ABC News]]|accessdate=May 31, 2018}]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Magical thinking]] in various forms is a [[cultural universal]] and an important aspect of [[religion]].
Magic is prevalent in all societies, regardless of whether they have organized religion or more general systems of [[animism]] or [[shamanism]].
Religion and magic became conceptually separated with the development of western [[monotheism]], where the distinction arose between supernatural events sanctioned by mainstream religious doctrine ([[miracle]]s) and magic rooted in folk belief or occult speculation.
In pre-monotheistic religious traditions, there is no fundamental distinction between religious practice and magic; tutelary deities concerned with magic are sometimes called hermetic deities or spirit guides.

== Magical practices in prehistory ==

=== Anthropological and psychological perspectives ===
{{Main|Magical thinking|Evolutionary origin of religion}}

It is a postulate of modern [[anthropology]], at least since early 1930s, that there is complete continuity between magic and religion.&lt;ref name="Cassirer1944"&gt;[[Ernst Cassirer|Cassirer, Ernst]] (1944) [https://books.google.com/books?id=pe9fWSv-iLsC&amp;pg=PA102 ''An Essay On Man''], pt.II, ch.7 ''Myth and Religion'', pp.122-3. Quotation: {{quotation|It seems to be one of the postulates of modern anthropology that there is complete continuity between magic and religion. [note 35: See, for instance, RR Marett, Faith, Hope, and Charity in Primitive Religion, the Gifford Lectures (Macmillan, 1932), Lecture II, pp. 21 ff.] ... We have no empirical evidence at all that there ever was an age of magic that has been followed and superseded by an age of religion.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Ranulph Marett]] (1932) [http://www.giffordlectures.org/Browse.asp?PubID=TPFHCR&amp;Volume=0&amp;Issue=0&amp;TOC=True ''Faith, Hope and Charity in Primitive Religion''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119025854/http://www.giffordlectures.org/Browse.asp?PubID=TPFHCR&amp;Volume=0&amp;Issue=0&amp;TOC=True |date=2011-11-19 }}, in [[Gifford Lectures]]. Lecture II [https://archive.is/20120731050138/http://www.giffordlectures.org/Browse.asp?PubID=TPFHCR&amp;Volume=0&amp;Issue=0&amp;ArticleID=3  ''Hope'']. Quotation: {{quotation|In conclusion, a word must be said on a rather trite subject. Many leading anthropologists, including the author of The Golden Bough, would wholly or in the main refuse the title of religion to these almost inarticulate ceremonies of very humble folk. I am afraid, however, that I cannot follow them. Nay, I would not leave out a whole continent from a survey of the religions of mankind in order to humour the most distinguished of my friends. Now clearly if these observances are not to be regarded as religious, like a wedding in church, so neither can they be classed as civil, like its drab equivalent at a registry office. They are mysteries, and are therefore at least generically akin to religion. Moreover, they are held in the highest public esteem as of infinite worth whether in themselves or for their effects. To label them, then, with the opprobrious name of magic as if they were on a par with the mummeries that enable certain knaves to batten on the nerves of fools is quite unscientific; for it mixes up two things which the student of human culture must keep rigidly apart, namely, a normal development of the social life and one of its morbid by-products. Hence for me they belong to religion, but of course to rudimentary religion—to an early phase of the same world-wide institution that we know by that name among ourselves. I am bound to postulate the strictest continuity between these stages of what I have here undertaken to interpret as a natural growth.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functional differences between religion and magic==
Early sociological interpretations of magic by [[Marcel Mauss]] and [[Henri Hubert]] emphasized the social conditions in which the phenomenon of magic develops.&lt;ref name='Pasi'&gt;Pasi, M. 2006. "Magic". in von Stuckrad, K. (ed.) ''The Brill Dictionary of Ancient Religion. Volume III. M-R.'' Leiden and Boston, Brill. 1134-1140.&lt;/ref&gt; According to them, religion is the expression of a social structure and serves to maintain the cohesion of a community (religion is therefore public) and magic is an individualistic action (and therefore private).&lt;ref name='Pasi' /&gt;

[[Ralph Merrifield]], the [[British people|British]] archaeologist credited as producing the first full-length volume dedicated to a [[Material culture|material]] approach to magic,&lt;ref name='Materiality'&gt;Houlbrook, C. and Armitage, N. 'Introduction: The materiality of the materiality of magic', in Houlbrook, C. and Armitage, N. (eds.) ''The Materiality of Magic: An artefactual investigation into ritual practices and popular beliefs''.Oxford and Philadelphia, Oxbow Books. 1-13.&lt;/ref&gt; defined the differences between religion and magic: 
"'Religion' is used to indicate the belief in supernatural or spiritual beings; 'magic', the use of practices intended to bring occult forces under control and so to influence events; 'ritual', prescribed or customary behaviour that may be religious, if it is intended to placate or win favour of supernatural beings, magical if it is intended to operate through impersonal forces of sympathy or by controlling supernatural beings, or social if its purpose is to reinforce a social organisation or facilitate social intercourse".&lt;ref name='Merrifield'&gt;Merrifield, R. 1987. ''The Archaeology of Ritual and Magic''. London, Guild Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991 Henk Versnel argued that magic and religion function in different ways and that these can be broadly defined in four areas: Intention - magic is employed to achieve clear and immediate goals for an individual, whereas religion is less purpose-motivated and has its sights set on longer-term goals; Attitude – magic is manipulative as the process is in the hands of the user, “instrumental coercive manipulation”, opposed to the religious attitude of “personal and supplicative negotiation”; Action – magic is a technical exercise that often requires professional skills to fulfil an action, whereas religion is not dependent upon these factors but the will and sentiment of the gods; Social – the goals of magic run counter to the interests of a society (in that personal gain for an individual gives them an unfair advantage over peers), whereas religion has more benevolent and positive social functions.&lt;ref name='Versnel'&gt;Versnel, H. S. 1991. “Some Reflections on the Relationship Magic-Religion.” Numen 38 (2). 177-195.&lt;/ref&gt;

This separation of the terms 'religion' and 'magic' in a functional sense is disputed. It has been argued that abandoning the term magic in favour of discussing "belief in spiritual beings" will help to create a more meaningful understanding of all associated ritual practices.&lt;ref&gt;Otto, B-C. 2013. "Towards Historicizing 'Magic' in Antiquity", ''Numen'' 60. 308-347.&lt;/ref&gt; However using the word 'magic' alongside 'religion' is one method of trying to understand the supernatural world, even if some other term can eventually take its place.&lt;ref name='Versnel' /&gt;

==Religious practices and magic==
Both magic and religion contain [[ritual]]s.&lt;ref name='Merrifield' /&gt; 
Most cultures have or have had in their past some form of magical tradition that recognizes a [[shamanistic]] interconnectedness of spirit. This may have been long ago, as a folk tradition that died out with the establishment of a major world religion, such as Judaism, Christianity, Islam or Buddhism, or it may still co-exist with that world religion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whitemagicwitch.com/magic-and-religion/ Magic and Religion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714235043/http://whitemagicwitch.com/magic-and-religion/ |date=2014-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Names of the gods ===
There is a long-standing belief in the power of [[true name]]s, this often descends from the magical belief that knowing a being's true name grants  power over it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

If names have power, then knowing the name of a god regarded as supreme in a religion should grant the greatest power of all.  This belief is reflected in traditional [[Wicca]], where the names of the Goddess and the Horned God - the two supreme deities in Wicca - are usually held as a secret to be revealed only to initiates. This belief is also reflected in ancient Judaism, which used the [[Tetragrammaton]] (YHWH, usually translated as "&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;" in small caps) to refer to God in the [[Tanakh]]. The same belief is seen in [[Hinduism]], but with different conclusions; rather, attaining transcendence and the power of God is seen as a ''good'' thing.  Thus, some Hindus chant the name of their favorite deities as often as possible, the most common being [[Krishna]].&lt;ref name="CHU"&gt;{{cite book

{{main|Witchcraft and divination in the Hebrew Bible|Christian views on magic}}
Magic and [[Abrahamic religions]] have had a somewhat checkered past.  The [[King James Version]] of the Bible included the famous translation "''Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live''" (Exodus 22:18),&lt;ref name="KJV"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Saul]] is rebuked by God for seeking advice from a diviner who could contact spirits. On the other hand, seemingly magical signs are documented in the Bible: For example, both the staff of Pharaoh's  sorcerers as well as [[The Staff of Moses|the staff of Moses]] and Aaron could be turned into snakes (Exodus 7:8-13). However, as Scott Noegel points out, the critical difference between the magic of Pharaoh's magicians and the non-magic of Moses is in the means by which the staff becomes a snake. For the Pharaoh's magicians, they employed "their secret arts" whereas Moses merely throws down his staff to turn it into a snake. To an ancient Egyptian, the startling difference would have been that Moses neither employed secret arts nor magical words. In the Torah, Noegel points out that YHWH does not need magical rituals to act.&lt;ref&gt;http://faculty.washington.edu/snoegel/PDFs/articles/Noegel%2019%20-%20JANES%201996.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The words 'witch' and 'witchcraft' appear in some English versions of the Bible. One verse that is probably responsible for more deaths of suspected witches than any other passage from the Hebrew Scriptures (Old Testament) is Exodus 22:18.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} In the King James Version, this reads: "Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live." The precise meaning of the Hebrew word ''kashaph'', here translated as 'witch' and in some other modern versions, 'sorceress', is uncertain. In the [[Septuagint]] it was translated as ''pharmakeia'', meaning 'pharmacy', and on this basis, [[Reginald Scot]] claimed in the 16th century that 'witch' was an incorrect translation and poisoners were intended.&lt;ref&gt;[[Reginald Scot|Scot, Reginald]] (c. 1580) ''The Discoverie of Witchcraft'' Booke VI Ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:World Map 1689.JPG|250px|right|thumb|World map by Gerard van Shagen, [[Amsterdam]], 1689]]
[[File:Map of the world by the US Gov as of 2016.svg|250px|thumb|right|World map from 2016 ''[[CIA World Factbook]]'']]

A '''map''' is a [[symbol]]ic depiction emphasizing relationships between elements of some space, such as [[Physical body|objects]], [[region]]s, or themes.

Many maps are static, fixed to [[paper]] or some other durable medium, while others are dynamic or interactive. Although most commonly used to depict geography, maps may represent any [[space]], real or fictional, without regard to [[context (language use)|context]] or [[scale (map)|scale]], such as in [[brain mapping]], [[DNA]] mapping, or computer network topology mapping. The space being mapped may be two dimensional, such as the surface of the earth, three dimensional, such as the interior of the earth, or even more abstract spaces of any dimension, such as arise in modeling phenomena having many independent variables.

Although the earliest maps known are of the heavens, geographic maps of territory have a very long tradition and exist from ancient times. The word "map" comes from the medieval Latin ''Mappa mundi'', wherein ''mappa'' meant napkin or cloth and ''mundi'' the world. Thus, "map" became the shortened term referring to a two-dimensional representation of the surface of the world.

==Geographic maps==
[[File:Planisphæri cœleste.jpg|thumb|A celestial map from the 17th century, by the  cartographer [[Frederik de Wit]]]]

[[Cartography]] or ''map-making'' is the study and practice of crafting representations of the Earth upon a flat surface (see [[History of cartography]]), and one who makes maps is called a [[cartography|cartographer]].

[[Road atlas|Road maps]] are perhaps the most widely used maps today, and form a subset of navigational maps, which also include aeronautical and [[nautical chart]]s, railroad network maps, and hiking and bicycling maps. In terms of quantity, the largest number of drawn map sheets is probably made up by local surveys, carried out by [[municipality|municipalities]], utilities, tax assessors, emergency services providers, and other local agencies.  Many national surveying projects have been carried out by the military, such as the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Ordnance Survey]]: a civilian government agency, internationally renowned for its comprehensively detailed work.

In addition to location information, maps may also be used to portray [[contour line]]s indicating constant values of [[elevation]], [[temperature]], [[rain]]fall, etc.

==Orientation of maps==
[[File:Hereford Mappa Mundi 1300.jpg|thumb|''The [[Hereford Mappa Mundi]]'' from about 1300, [[Hereford Cathedral]], England, is a classic "T-O" map with Jerusalem at centre, east toward the top, Europe the bottom left and Africa on the right.]]
The orientation of a map is the relationship between the directions on the map and the corresponding [[compass direction]]s in reality. The word "[[orient]]" is derived from [[Latin]] ''oriens'', meaning east. In the [[Middle Ages]] many maps, including the [[T and O map]]s, were drawn with east at the top (meaning that the direction "up" on the map corresponds to East on the compass). The most common cartographic convention is that north is at the top of a map.

Maps not oriented with north at the top:
* Maps from non-Western traditions are oriented a variety of ways. Old maps of [[Edo]] show the [[Tokyo Imperial Palace|Japanese imperial palace]] as the "top", but also at the centre, of the map. Labels on the map are oriented in such a way that you cannot read them properly unless you put the imperial palace above your head.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}
* [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] European [[T and O map]]s such as the [[Hereford Mappa Mundi]] were centred on [[Jerusalem]] with East at the top. Indeed, prior to the reintroduction of [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Geographia|Geography]]'' to Europe around 1400, there was no single convention in the West. [[Portolan chart]]s, for example, are oriented to the shores they describe.
* Maps of cities bordering a sea are often conventionally oriented with the sea at the top.
* Route and channel maps have traditionally been oriented to the road or waterway they describe.
* [[Azimuthal equidistant projection|Polar maps]] of the [[Arctic]] or [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] regions are conventionally centred on the pole; the direction North would be towards or away from the centre of the map, respectively. Typical maps of the Arctic have 0° meridian towards the bottom of the page; maps of the Antarctic have the 0° meridian towards the top of the page.
* [[Reversed map]]s, also known as ''Upside-Down maps'' or ''South-Up maps'', reverse the ''North is up'' convention and have south at the top.
* [[Buckminster Fuller]]'s [[Dymaxion map]]s are based on a projection of the Earth's [[sphere]] onto an [[icosahedron]]. The resulting triangular pieces may be arranged in any order or orientation.
* Modern digital [[GIS]] maps such as [[ArcMap]] typically project north at the top of the map, but use math degrees (0 is east, degrees increase counter-clockwise), rather than compass degrees (0 is north, degrees increase clockwise) for orientation of transects. Compass decimal degrees can be converted to math degrees by subtracting them from 450; if the answer is greater than 360, subtract 360.

==Scale and accuracy==

[[File:Blank globe.svg|thumb|A 'global view map' of Europe, Western Asia and Africa.]]

Many maps are drawn to a [[Scale (map)|scale]] expressed as a [[ratio]], such as 1:10,000, which means that 1 unit of [[measurement]] on the map corresponds to 10,000 of that same unit on the ground. The scale statement can be accurate when the region mapped is small enough for the [[curvature]] of the Earth to be neglected, such as a [[city map]]. Mapping larger regions, where curvature cannot be ignored, requires [[map projection|projections]] to map from the curved surface of the Earth to the plane. The impossibility of flattening the [[sphere]] to the [[Plane (geometry)|plane]] without distortion means that the map cannot have constant scale. Rather, on most projections the best that can be attained is accurate scale along one or two paths on the projection. Because scale differs everywhere, it can only be measured meaningfully as [[scale (map)|point scale]] per location. Most maps strive to keep point scale variation within narrow bounds. Although the scale statement is nominal it is usually accurate enough for most purposes unless the map covers a large fraction of the earth. At the scope of a world map, scale as a single number is practically meaningless throughout most of the map. Instead, it usually refers to the scale along the equator.

Large scale maps, (e.g. 1:10,000), cover relatively small regions in great detail and small scale maps, (e.g. 1:10,000,000), cover large regions such as nations, continents and the whole [[globe]]. The large/small terminology arose from the practice of writing scales as numerical fractions: 1/10,000 is larger than 1/10,000,000. There is no exact dividing line between large and small but 1/100,000 might well be considered as a medium scale. Examples of large scale maps are the 1:25,000 maps produced for hikers; on the other hand maps intended for motorists at 1:250,000 or 1:1,000,000 are small scale.

It is important to recognize that even the most accurate maps sacrifice a certain amount of accuracy in scale to deliver a greater visual usefulness to its user. For example, the width of roads and small streams are exaggerated when they are too narrow to be shown on the map at true scale; that is, on a printed map they would be narrower than could be perceived by the naked eye. The same applies to computer maps where the smallest unit is the [[pixel]]. A narrow stream say must be shown to have the width of a pixel even if at the map scale it would be a small fraction of the pixel width.
[[File:EU Pop2008 1024.PNG|thumb|Cartogram: The [[European Union|EU]] distorted to show population distributions.]]

Some maps, called [[cartogram]]s, have the scale deliberately distorted to reflect information other than land area or distance. For example, this map (at the right) of [[Europe]] has been distorted to show population distribution, while the rough shape of the continent is still discernible.

Another example of distorted scale is the famous [[Tube map|London Underground map]]. The basic geographical structure is respected but the tube lines (and the [[River Thames]]) are smoothed to clarify the relationships between stations. Near the center of the map stations are spaced out more than near the edges of map.

Further inaccuracies may be deliberate. For example, cartographers may simply omit military installations or remove features solely in order to enhance the clarity of the map. For example, a road map may not show railroads, smaller waterways or other prominent non-road objects, and even if it does, it may show them less clearly (e.g. dashed or dotted lines/outlines) than the main roads. Known as decluttering, the practice makes the subject matter that the user is interested in easier to read, usually without sacrificing overall accuracy. Software-based maps often allow the user to toggle decluttering between ON, OFF and AUTO as needed. In AUTO the degree of decluttering is adjusted as the user changes the scale being displayed.

==Map types and projections==

{{Category see also|Map types}}
[[File:Ocean gravity map.gif|thumb|Map of large underwater features. (1995, [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]])]]
Maps of the world or large areas are often either 'political' or 'physical'. The most important purpose of the political map is to show territorial [[border]]s; the purpose of the physical is to show features of [[geography]] such as mountains, soil type or land use including infrastructure such as roads, railroads and buildings. [[Topographic map]]s show [[elevation]]s and [[Terrain|relief]] with [[contour line]]s or shading. [[Geological map]]s show not only the physical surface, but characteristics of the underlying rock, [[fault (geology)|fault]] lines, and subsurface structures.
Maps that depict the surface of the Earth also use a [[map projection|projection]], a way of translating the three-dimensional real surface of the [[geoid]] to a two-dimensional picture. Perhaps the best-known world-map projection is the [[Mercator projection]], originally designed as a form of [[nautical chart]].
Aeroplane pilots use [[aeronautical chart]]s based on a [[Lambert conformal conic projection]], in which a cone is laid over the section of the earth to be mapped. The cone intersects the sphere (the earth) at one or two parallels which are chosen as standard lines. This allows the pilots to plot a great-circle route approximation on a flat, two-dimensional chart.
* [[Map projection#Azimuthal (projections onto a plane)|Azimuthal]] or [[Gnomonic projection|Gnomonic]] [[map projection]]s are often used in planning air routes due to their ability to represent [[great circle]]s as straight lines.
*  Richard Edes Harrison produced a striking series of maps during and after [[World War II]] for [[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune magazine]]. These used "bird's eye" projections to emphasise globally strategic "fronts" in the air age, pointing out proximities and barriers not apparent on a conventional  rectangular projection of the world.

===Electronic maps===&lt;!-- Electronic map redirects here --&gt;
[[File:Topographic map example.png|thumb|A [[United States Geological Survey|USGS]] [[digital raster graphic]].]]

From the last quarter of the 20th century, the indispensable tool of the [[cartographer]] has been the computer. Much of cartography, especially at the data-gathering [[surveying|survey]] level, has been subsumed by [[geographic information system|Geographic Information Systems]] (GIS). The functionality of maps has been greatly advanced by technology simplifying the superimposition of spatially located variables onto existing geographical maps. Having local information such as rainfall level, distribution of wildlife, or demographic data integrated within the map allows more efficient analysis and better decision making. In the pre-electronic age such [[superimposition]] of data led [[John Snow (physician)|Dr. John Snow]] to identify the location of an outbreak of [[cholera]]. Today, it is used by agencies of the human kind, as diverse as wildlife conservationists and militaries around the world.

[[File:Maps-for-free Sierra Nevada.png|thumb|Relief map Sierra Nevada]]

Even when GIS is not involved, most cartographers now use a variety of computer graphics programs to generate new maps.

Interactive, computerised maps are commercially available, allowing users to ''zoom in'' or ''zoom out'' (respectively meaning to increase or decrease the scale), sometimes by replacing one map with another of different scale, centered where possible on the same point.  In-car [[global navigation satellite system]]s are computerised maps with route-planning and advice facilities which monitor the user's position with the help of satellites. From the computer scientist's point of view, zooming in entails one or a combination of:

# replacing the map by a more detailed one
# enlarging the same map without enlarging the [[pixel]]s, hence showing more detail by removing less information compared to the less detailed version
# enlarging the same map with the pixels enlarged (replaced by rectangles of pixels); no additional detail is shown, but, depending on the quality of one's vision, possibly more detail can be seen; if a computer display does not show adjacent pixels really separate, but overlapping instead (this does not apply for an [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]], but may apply for a [[cathode ray tube]]), then replacing a pixel by a rectangle of pixels does show more detail.  A variation of this method is [[interpolation]].

[[File:World.pdf|thumb|A world map in PDF format.]]

For example:
* Typically (2) applies to a [[Portable Document Format]] (PDF) file or other format based on [[vector graphics]]. The increase in detail is limited to the information contained in the file: enlargement of a curve may eventually result in a series of standard geometric figures such as straight lines, arcs of circles or [[spline (mathematics)|splines]].
* (2) may apply to text and (3) to the outline of a map feature such as a forest or building.
* (1) may apply to the text as needed (displaying labels for more features), while (2) applies to the rest of the image.  Text is not necessarily enlarged when zooming in. Similarly, a road represented by a double line may or may not become wider when one zooms in.
* The map may also have layers which are partly [[raster graphics]] and partly [[vector graphics]].  For a single raster graphics image (2) applies until the pixels in the image file correspond to the pixels of the display, thereafter (3) applies.

== Climatic maps ==

The maps that reflect the territorial distribution of climatic conditions based on the results of long-term observations are called climatic maps. These maps can be compiled both for individual climatic features (temperature, precipitation, humidity) and for combinations of them at the earth's surface and in the upper layers of the atmosphere. Climatic maps afford a very convenient overview of the climatic features in a large region and permit values of climatic features to be compared in different parts of the region. Through interpolation the maps can be used to determine the values of climatic features in any particular spot.

Climatic maps generally apply to individual months and to the year as a whole, sometimes to the four seasons, to the growing period, and so forth. On maps compiled from the observations of ground meteorological stations, atmospheric pressure is converted to sea level. Air temperature maps are compiled both from the actual values observed on the surface of the earth and from values converted to sea level. The pressure field in free atmosphere is represented either by maps of the distribution of pressure at different standard altitudes—for example, at every kilometer above sea level—or by maps of baric topography on which altitudes (more precisely geopotentials) of the main isobaric surfaces (for example, 900, 800, and 700 millibars) counted off from sea level are plotted. The temperature, humidity, and wind on aeroclimatic maps may apply either to standard altitudes or to the main isobaric surfaces.

Isolines are drawn on maps of such climatic features as the long-term mean values (of atmospheric pressure, temperature, humidity, total precipitation, and so forth) to connect points with equal values of the feature in question—for example, isobars for pressure, isotherms for temperature, and isohyets for precipitation. Isoamplitudes are drawn on maps of amplitudes (for example, annual amplitudes of air temperature—that is, the differences between the mean temperatures of the warmest and coldest month). Isanomals are drawn on maps of anomalies (for example, deviations of the mean temperature of each place from the mean temperature of the entire latitudinal zone). Isolines of frequency are drawn on maps showing the frequency of a particular phenomenon (for example, annual number of days with a thunderstorm or snow cover). Isochrones are drawn on maps showing the dates of onset of a given phenomenon (for example, the first frost and appearance or disappearance of the snow cover) or the date of a particular value of a meteorological element in the course of a year (for example, passing of the mean daily air temperature through zero). Isolines of the mean numerical value of wind velocity or isotachs are drawn on wind maps (charts); the wind resultants and directions of prevailing winds are indicated by arrows of different length or arrows with different plumes; lines of flow are often drawn. Maps of the zonal and meridional components of wind are frequently compiled for the free atmosphere. Atmospheric pressure and wind are usually combined on climatic maps. Wind roses, curves showing the distribution of other meteorological elements, diagrams of the annual course of elements at individual stations, and the like are also plotted on climatic maps.

Maps of climatic regionalization, that is, division of the earth's surface into climatic zones and regions according to some classification of climates, are a special kind of climatic map.

Climatic maps are often incorporated into climatic atlases of varying geographic range (globe, hemispheres, continents, countries, oceans) or included in comprehensive atlases. Besides general climatic maps, applied climatic maps and atlases have great practical value. Aeroclimatic maps, aeroclimatic atlases, and agroclimatic maps are the most numerous.

==Conventional signs==
The various features shown on a map are represented by conventional [[sign]]s or symbols.  For example, colors can be used to indicate a classification of roads.  Those signs are usually explained in the margin of the map, or on a separately published characteristic sheet.&lt;ref&gt;Ordnance Survey, [https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/docs/legends/25k-raster-legend.pdf Explorer Map Symbols] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403185303/https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/docs/legends/25k-raster-legend.pdf |date=3 April 2016 }}; Swisstopo, [http://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/internet/swisstopo/en/home/products/maps/leisure/hiking.parsysrelated1.96279.downloadList.81398.DownloadFile.tmp/symbolsen.pdf Conventional Signs]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528053109/http://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/internet/swisstopo/en/home/products/maps/leisure/hiking.parsysrelated1.96279.downloadList.81398.DownloadFile.tmp/symbolsen.pdf |date=28 May 2008 }}; United States Geological Survey, [http://erg.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/booklets/symbols/ Topographic Map Symbols] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080601185821/http://erg.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/booklets/symbols/ |date=1 June 2008 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cartographers prefer to make the map cover practically the entire screen or sheet of paper, leaving no room "outside" the map for information about the map as a whole.
These cartographers typically place such information in an otherwise "blank" region "inside" the map{{mdash}}[[cartouche (cartography)|cartouche]], [[legend (map)|map legend]], title, [[compass rose]], [[bar scale]], etc.
In particular, some maps contain smaller "sub-maps"&lt;!-- is there a better term? --&gt; in otherwise blank regions—often one at a much smaller scale showing the whole globe and where the whole map fits on that globe, and a few showing "regions of interest" at a larger scale in order to show details that wouldn't otherwise fit.
Occasionally sub-maps use the same scale as the large map—a few maps of the [[contiguous United States]] include a sub-map&lt;!-- is there a better term? --&gt; to the same scale for each of the two non-contiguous states.

{{See also|Japanese map symbols}}

===Labeling===
To communicate spatial information effectively, features such as rivers, lakes, and cities need to be [[Labeling (map design)|labeled]]. Over centuries cartographers have developed the art of placing names on even the densest of maps. Text placement or name placement can get mathematically very complex as the number of labels and map density increases. Therefore, text placement is time-consuming and labor-intensive, so cartographers and GIS users have developed [[automatic label placement]] to ease this process.&lt;ref&gt;Imhof, E., “Die Anordnung der Namen in der Karte,” Annuaire International de Cartographie II, Orell-Füssli Verlag, Zürich, 93–129, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, H., Map data processing and the annotation problem, Proc. 3rd Scandinavian Conf. on Image Analysis, Chartwell-Bratt Ltd. Copenhagen, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-geographical spatial maps==
Maps exist of the [[Solar System]], and other cosmological features such as [[star map]]s. In addition maps of other bodies such as the Moon and other planets are technically not ''[[geospatial|geo]]''graphical maps.

==Topological maps==
[[File:Inventory Locations Represented as a Map.png|thumb|upright=1.3|In a [[topological map]], like this one showing inventory locations, the distances between locations is not important. Only the layout and connectivity between them matters.]]
Diagrams such as [[schematic diagram]]s and [[Gantt chart]]s and [[treemap]]s display logical relationships between items, rather than geographical relationships. [[Topological]] in nature, only the connectivity is significant. The [[London Underground map]] and similar subway maps around the world are a common example of these maps.

==General-purpose maps==
General-purpose maps provide many types of information on one map. Most atlas maps, wall maps, and road maps fall into this category. The following are some features that might be shown on general-purpose maps: bodies of water, roads, railway lines, parks, elevations, towns and cities, political boundaries, latitude and longitude, national and provincial parks. These maps give a broad understanding of location and features of an area.  The reader may gain an understanding of the type of landscape, the location of urban places, and the location of major transportation routes all at once.

==Legal regulation==

Some countries required that all published maps represent their national claims regarding [[border dispute]]s.  For example:
* Within Russia, Google Maps shows [[Crimea]] as part of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/04/12/302337754/google-maps-displays-crimean-border-differently-in-russia-u-s |title=Google Maps Displays Crimean Border Differently In Russia, U.S. |date=12 April 2014 |work=[[NPR.org]] |first=Bill |last=Chappell |author-link=Bill Chappell |access-date=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Both the Republic of India and the People's Republic of China require that all maps show areas subject to the [[Sino-Indian border dispute]] in their own favor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/23/us-google-asia-idUSBRE82M0I020120323 |title=Google charts a careful course through Asia's maps |newspaper=[[Reuters]] |first=Jeremy |last=Wagstaff |author-link=Jeremy Wagstaff |access-date=6 September 2018 |date=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the People's Republic of China began requiring that all online maps served from within China be hosted there, making them subject to Chinese laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Guanqun |first=Wang |title=China issues new rules on Internet map publishing |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2010-05/19/c_13302696.htm |work=[[Xinhua News Agency]] |access-date=27 July 2016 |date=19 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160527193512/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2010-05/19/c_13302696.htm |archive-date=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many inns had prostitutes in order to attract a larger number of travellers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17443">'''Metropolitan Area Projects Plan''' ('''MAPS''') is a multi-year, municipal capital improvement program, consisting of a number of projects, originally conceived in the 1990s in [[Oklahoma City]] by its then mayor [[Ron Norick]]. A MAPS program features several interrelated and defined capital projects, funded by a temporary sales tax (allowing projects to be paid for in cash, without incurring debt), administered by a separate dedicated city staff funded by the sales tax, and supervised by a volunteer citizens oversight committee.

In some ways, a MAPS program is similar to a [[Local option sales tax]].  However, taxes collected by a MAPS program do not go to a city's general fund, but are instead deposited into a trust dedicated to the specific projects identified in the taxes' enabling ordinance.  Additionally, MAPS programs are only indirectly controlled by a city's elected governance body; a citizens oversight committee provides direct oversight, which is also established by the enabling ordinance.

==Features of a MAPS program==
The key features of the original program were designed to provide accountability to the citizens of the community as well as provide a funding mechanism for capital projects without using a city's general revenue funds, and included:
* Several capital projects, each designed to appeal to a variety of demographic groups within the city, while at the same time having "those projects geographically close to each other to create a synergy of activity for people."&lt;ref name=Norick&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.okgazette.com/oklahoma/article-4194-former-mayor-ron-norick-discusses-how-current-maps-proposal-differs-from-first.html|title=Former Mayor Ron Norick discusses how current MAPS proposal differs from first|author=Scott Cooper|date=2009-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* The overall program would be funded by a dedicated, multi-year sales tax with a start date and end date
* Projects would be paid for in cash, without incurring debt; with this "pay as you go" approach, construction does not start until the cost of the project has been collected; money is in an interest bearing bank account and not deposited in the city's general fund.
* The Program would be overseen by a volunteer citizens advisory committee, whose recommendations for architects, plans and construction documents, contractors, and change-orders would be forwarded to city council for approval   
* Projects would be administered by a separate and dedicated city staff, hired specifically for the term of the program, with salaries and expenses a component of program costs, paid from sales tax revenue   
* Each project would be allocated an endowment sufficient to operate and maintain the building without additional cost to the city's general fund

A common challenge of "pay as you go" programs such as MAPS is that, because the lead-up time while accumulating the needed funds can be lengthy, specific projects of the program "are often are scuttled when administrations change and new leaders want their own signature projects... Oklahoma City was able to avoid this pitfall ‹because the city› changes mayors, but not strategies."&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.placemakingchicago.com/places/oklahoma-city.asp | title=Placemaking Chicago: Oklahoma City | author=Evan Severs | date=April 2012}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Because the voters approved a multi-year temporary sales tax that was dedicated to multiple specific projects that together had significant public support, and because the infrastructure to support the program and its projects was also temporary with dedicated funding from the sales tax, a change in elected officials has not been sufficient to change the scope of the program.

A key to success is the feature of multiple projects; while each project taken individually might not have sufficient support for individual funding, when taken as a group, the package has sufficient support for funding.  Said another way, it is important to "bundle projects to enhance community buy-in."&lt;ref name=lessons&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.docstoc.com/docs/123404971/MAPS-Oklahoma-City-Metropolitan-Area-Projects | title=Lessons Learned: Community &amp; Economic Development Case Studies | publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago | author=Les Le | date=2003-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another benefit of multiple projects is that by staging the projects, citizens may have their confidence level increased by being shown staggered "early results ‹with less expensive projects› ... by experiencing a string of groundbreakings."&lt;ref name=lessons /&gt;

==History==
In many ways the [[early 1980s recession]] in the United States began in Oklahoma City with the collapse of the [[Penn Square Bank]].  This subsequent collapse of the state's energy business and failure of additional financial institutions, lead to a significant out-migration and excess capacity in real estate.  The resulting lack of infrastructure investment in the inner city proved to be a factor in the city's inability to attract new business.&lt;ref name=renewal&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.brownfieldrenewal.com/renewal-award-project-economic_impact-city_of_oklahoma_city___metropolitan_area_projects-1.html | title=The Renewal Rewards: Economic Impact - City of Oklahoma City - Metropolitan Area Projects | publisher=Redevelopment and Renewal Magazine |date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early 1990s some Oklahoma City interests were concerned about what they perceived as civic decline. In 1992, after the city lost a contract to house a new maintenance facility for [[United Airlines]] to [[Indianapolis, Indiana]] because the airline considered Indianapolis to have a better [[standard of living]] and [[quality of life]], then-mayor [[Ron Norick]] and the [[Greater Oklahoma City Chamber of Commerce]] proposed MAPS as a measure to improve the city's economy and attractiveness as a tourist destination.&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lnbBNr5ZzwUC&amp;pg=PT234&amp;dq=%22metropolitan+area+projects+plan%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22metropolitan%20area%20projects%20plan%22&amp;f=false|title=Civic revolutionaries: igniting the passion for change in America's communities|author1=Douglas C. Henton |author2=John Melville |author3=Kimberly Walesh  |last-author-amp=yes |date=2004|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|ISBN=978-0-7879-6393-4|page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

City residents were initially skeptical over funding the public projects through a sales tax increase, and as late as a month before the tax [[referendum]] opposed the plan by a 20% margin.  However, the plan did pass by a slim margin in a vote in December, 1993.&lt;ref name=book/&gt;  During the five year tax period the city raised nearly $310 million in direct taxes, plus $52 million of income on the tax money it had deposited.  The tax was extended with voter approval for an additional six months to raise enough money to complete all of the projects, and construction continued until 2004.

Encouraged by the success of MAPS, city leaders proposed and adopted "MAPS for Kids", a public school improvement program.  In December 2009 the city approved a third program, "[[Metropolitan Area Projects Plan 3|MAPS 3]]", which would build $777 million in further improvements paid for by a similar sales tax increase.

==Oklahoma City MAPS initiative==
The MAPS initiatives in Oklahoma City, to date, consist of three major programs: The original MAPS program, MAPS for Kids, and MAPS 3.

===MAPS===
The original '''Metropolitan Area Projects Plan''', or '''[http://www.okc.gov/maps MAPS]''', was a $350 million [[public works]] and [[redevelopment]] project in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]] during the middle to late 1990s, funded by a temporary, five year, voter-approved [[sales tax]] increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Greater Oklahoma City Chamber of Commerce|url=http://www.okcchamber.com/index.php?submenu=ChamberHistory&amp;src=gendocs&amp;ref=ChamberHistory&amp;category=About|title=Chamber History}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The various MAPS projects were believed to be capable of improving the economy and attractiveness of this ‹downtown› core and having a profound impact on proximal areas;"&lt;ref name=renewal /&gt; the common theme of the projects was downtown redevelopment.  The original MAPS program comprised nine projects that took 10 years to complete, and were chosen to appeal to a wide variety of city residents and also revitalize the city's downtown: 
*renovations to the [[Civic Center Music Hall]] including the 2,500 seat Thelma Gaylord Performing Arts Theater, the 290 seat Freedie Little Theater, the 100 seat City Space Theater, the 5,000 sf Minders Hall of Mirrors, and the 3,100 sf Joel Levine Rehearsal Hall.  
*renovations to [[Cox Convention Center|The Myriad (now the Cox Convention Center)]] including a 100,000 sf expansion of the convention space. The Cox center also includes a 15,000 seat multi-purpose arena that was home to the [[Oklahoma City Barons]] hockey team (the top farm team of the [[Edmonton Oilers]]). 
*renovations to the [[Oklahoma State Fairgrounds]] 
*construction of the [[Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark]] home of the [[Oklahoma City Dodgers]], the Triple-A affiliate of the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] Major League Baseball team. The park has seating for up to 13,066 fans and currently utilizes a seating capacity of 9,000 for Dodgers games. 
*construction of the 18,203 seat Ford Center (now called the [[Chesapeake Energy Arena]]), an indoor multipurpose sports arena.  The arena was completed for several years before it became an important aspect of plans in 2006 through 2008 by local businessman [[Clay Bennett (businessman)|Clay Bennett]], who lead the purchase of the [[Seattle SuperSonics]], and later moved the basketball team to Oklahoma City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/basketball/278203_okcity20.html|publisher=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|title=Oklahoma City is positively giddy:'Looks like we might be getting y'all's team'|author=Mike Lewis|date=2006-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The NBA team is now called the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]].
*construction of the "[[Bricktown (Oklahoma City)|Bricktown]] Canal" which provided a core investment to transform a former [[warehouse district]] into an entertainment district; with "recreation activities available in Bricktown are currently ‹2009› estimated to draw 2.9 million visits annually"&lt;ref name=impact&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.greateroklahomacity.com/clientuploads/pdf/MAPS_Impact_Study_Executive_Summary.pdf | title=Executive Summary: Impact Analysis of Oklahoma City's MAPS and other Significant Central City Investments, Revised |author1=Larkin Warner  |author2=Eric Long  |lastauthoramp=yes | publisher=Greater Oklahoma City Chamber of Commerce | date=February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13}}
*construction of a [[riverfront]] and recreational dams on the [[North Canadian River]] (this section of the river has been renamed the Oklahoma River, its lower section is known as the [http://boathousedistrict.org Boathouse District], the headquarters for [[USACK|USA Canoe/Kayak]] and a training center for [[USRowing]])
*a new Library/learning Center, later called the [http://www.Mls.lib.ok.us/Mls/mls_library/dn.htm Ronald J. Norick Downtown Library], a four-story main library to replace a facility that had been built in 1951
*development of the [[Oklahoma Spirit Trolleys]], a [[tourist trolley|trolley-replica bus]] network

===MAPS for Kids===
The second MAPS program, called [http://www.okc.gov/ocmaps MAPS for Kids], was a $700 million initiative to improve schools in the various school districts whose boundaries coincided with the City of Oklahoma City.  Oklahoma has school districts whose boundaries have nothing to do with the boundaries of any other political subdivision.  At the time the original MAPS tax was expiring, the [[Oklahoma City Public Schools]] system was struggling with little political capital.  "They could not pass bond issues, and the school buildings were falling apart as a result."&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | url=http://americaninfrastructuremag.com/summer-2012-24.php | title=Oklahoma City Invests in New Urban Infrastructure | author=Mick Cornett | publisher=American Infrastructure,  Peninsula Publishing, Inc. | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714142117/http://americaninfrastructuremag.com/summer-2012-24.php | archivedate=2014-07-14 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Then mayor [[Kirk Humphreys]] proposed a second MAPS program to repair more than 100 area schools.  With the addition of a $180-million bond issue and an eye on addressing childhood obesity issues, new gymnasiums were added to all of the Oklahoma City District's elementary schools. The program was approved by voters in 2001. This temporary sales tax was collected for seven years, with 70 percent disbursed to the Oklahoma City School District and 30 percent to 23 Suburban School Districts.

===MAPS 3===
{{main|Metropolitan Area Projects Plan 3}}
[http://www.okc.gov/maps3 MAPS 3] is a $777 million program, approved by voters in 2009 with 54% of the vote (the same percentage as the Original MAPS.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://newsok.com/maps3 | title=MAPS 3 Oklahoma City | publisher=NewsOK.com | accessdate=27 Jun 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The one-cent sales tax initiative began in April 2010 and ends in December 2017.  After a year of public meetings organized by Mayor [[Mick Cornett]], there developed a consensus that a future MAPS program should focus on projects that improved the [[Quality of Life]] in Oklahoma City.  Hundreds of citizens suggested projects to be considered; through a series of public meetings eight projects were eventually selected to be included in the MAPS 3 proposal.
*New Downtown Convention Center
*New Downtown Public Park - 70 acres, including festival areas
*New Modern Streetcar/Transit system and an inter-modal transit hub
*New Senior Health and Wellness Centers; multiple structures in various parts of the city designed to encourage healthy lifestyles and serve as a gathering place for active seniors
*Improvements to the Oklahoma River including a whitewater training facility and various upgrades to the world-class rowing racecourse
*Improvements to the Oklahoma State Fair Grounds including replacing public event buildings
*Expansion of Trails system that interconnects the city's major parks for walking and biking 
*Expansion of neighborhood sidewalks to create a more walkable community
Recognizing that the city's economy may fluctuate during the time of the sales tax collection, and that there may be unforeseen project contingencies, the program also has a significant Infrastructure/Contingency component.

The public forum process used to identify projects to be included in the MAPS 3 program established enough public political support to overcome an effort by a newly elected city council person who attempted to derail the original MAPS 3 proposal. An initiative petition was filed that would have eliminated the Convention Center and ended the Sales tax earlier.  This council person also ran for Mayor, with MAPS being a major factor in the election. Mayor Cornett was re-elected for an unprecedented 4th term with 65.7% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://newsok.com/oklahoma-citys-mick-cornett-wins-fourth-term-as-mayor/article/3940020 | title=Oklahoma City's Mick Cornett wins fourth term as mayor | publisher=Daily Oklahoman | date=4 Mar 2014 | author=William Crum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact of MAPS in Oklahoma City===
The MAPS programs have had significant impact in Oklahoma City, both economically and from a quality of life standpoint. In the 20 years since its inception "nearly $5 billion in economic impact can be attributed to the original MAPS program. This represents a nearly 10-fold return on the city's original investment." &lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | url=http://www.greateroklahomacity.com/clientuploads/pdf/economic%20forecast%202014.pdf | title=2014 Greater Oklahoma City Economic Forecast |author1=Russell Evans |author2=Eric Long | date=2014 | page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As was recently reported in a Wichita newspaper, 
"From quirky festivals and dozens of restaurants to outdoor recreation and romantic riverboat rides, a revitalized downtown Oklahoma City boasts so many attractions it is quickly becoming a favorite weekend destination for Oklahomans and Kansans alike." &lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news | url=http://www.kansas.com/2014/05/17/3461812/okc-offers-more-activities-than.html#storylink=cpy | author =Andi Atwatwer | title=OKC offers More Activities than you'd Think | date=2014-05-17 | publisher=The Wichita Eagle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is arguable that in terms of associated investment, hotels segment represent the largest impact of the original MAPS.   "In 1992-93 when the city's leaders developed the plans for the MAPS investments, there was only one significant hotel operating in downtown Oklahoma City. What is now the Sheraton had nearly 400 rooms but was in need of upgrading. By 2008, there were seven significant hotels in the Downtown CBD and Bricktown with a total of about 1,600 rooms."&lt;ref name=impact /&gt;{{rp|15}}

The '''Microtraining''' method is an approach aimed at supporting [[informal learning]] processes in organizations and companies. Learning in this sense means that an active process of knowledge creation is taking place within [[social interaction]]s, but outside of [[formal learning]] environments or training facilities. This process can be facilitated by well-designed and structured systems and by supporting ways of communication and collaboration, like the Microtraining method does. A Microtraining arrangement comprises a time span of 15–20 minutes for each learning session, which can activate and maintain learning processes for a longer period if bundled into series. A Microtraining session can be held face-to-face, online or embedded in an [[e-learning]] scenario.

==Applicability==
The Microtraining method can be applied to learning situations within [[organization]]s and [[Company|companies]], especially when basic knowledge needs to be refreshed or improved and when information is needed for immediate use in daily practice. In comparison to formal learning, Microtraining is an approach aimed at structuring informal learning activities. While formal learning may be a successful approach for people with less knowledge and skills [Tynjälä, 2008], it can be counter-productive for more experienced employees [Jonassen et al., 1993] for whom informal blended learning approaches like Microtraining appear to be working very well [Jonassen/Mayes/McAleese, 1993; Jonassen, 1997].

==Organizational requirements==
With regard to organizational requirements, facilitating the new learning concept by [[management]] and accompanying the initial phase of implementing the Microtraining method are crucial for its success. Consequently, the Microtraining method is not meant to be an approach to designing learning materials alone, but involves analyzing learning processes in organizations and supporting change management of learning strategies as a whole. If, for example, employees have insufficient access to a computer or web services supporting [[E-learning|online learning]] activities that are part of the Microtraining approach or if they are not allowed to spend working time learning, any effort to design the best material and collaborative surroundings will fail.

==Didactical principles==
The Microtraining method is based on several current learning theories and concepts, one of the most important of which is the theory of [[Social constructivism|Social Constructivism]], which sees learning as an active process, taking into account the learner's individual background [Vygotsky, 1978]. The second crucial idea comes from the concept of [[connectivism]], which states that learning is not an internal, solitary process, but that new knowledge is acquired best while working and learning in a lively community [Siemens, 2005].

==The method==
Microtraining sessions are structured as follows:

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Microtraining session structure.png]] --&gt;

1 Active start (3 minutes)
* Start with a mental activity e.g. thinking, reflecting, organizing and comparing
* Communicate the goal of the session

2 Exercise / Demonstration (6 minutes)
* Connect with different learning styles by using a combination of pictures, sounds and text.
* Stimulate the learning process by giving concrete examples

3 Feedback/ Discussion (4 minutes)
* Ensure effective, direct and positive feedback
* Stimulate both discussion and knowledge sharing between participants
* Check if all participants really understand the content by asking questions

4 Conclusion: What's next? How do we learn more? (2 minutes)
* What are the topics we will discuss during the next meeting(s)
* Discuss how to retain the knowledge
* Stimulate involvement and ensure participants leave with a clear goal

'''''NASA 360''''' is a half-hour [[vodcast]] developed by [[NASA]] in partnership with the [[National Institute of Aerospace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nianet.org/|title=National Institute of Aerospace}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show premiered in August 2008. It has aired on more than 450 TV stations across the country, is available on air and cruise lines, and is consistently one of the top-downloaded programs on the NASA.gov website. It is currently in its tenth season.

==Description==
''NASA 360'' is one of four programs in NASA's award-winning eClips&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/nasaeclips/index.html|title=NASA eClips website}}&lt;/ref&gt; suite of web-based shows designed to encourage careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. ''NASA 360'' is written, produced, and edited by Timothy J. Allen, Tom Shortridge, and Scott Bednar; Rebecca Jaramillo is the Senior Educator and Project Coordinator for ''NASA 360'', and Harla Sherwood the Principal Investigator - all of the National Institute of Aerospace.

''NASA 360'' shows how NASA has changed and continues to change life on Earth by examining how technologies developed by or for NASA are being used in everything from space exploration to everyday consumer products. These include lithium ion batteries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/podcasting/nasa360/nasa360-0102.html|title= NASA 360 Season 1 Episode 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; medical innovations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/podcasting/nasa360/nasa360-0107.html|title=NASA 360 Season 1 Episode 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; sporting equipment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/podcasting/nasa360/nasa360-0211.html|title=NASA 360 Season 2 Episode 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and automotive and aircraft safety and efficiency,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/podcasting/nasa360/nasa360-0103.html|title=NASA 360 Season 1 Episode 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; among many more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/researchernews/rn_nasa360.html|title=Barnstorff, Kathy.

''NASA 360'' is shot on-location at NASA centers across the country, as well as at other relevant sites across the globe. The fifth season marked the revitalization of ''NASA 360'' and features new hosts Caleb Kinchlow and Molly McKinney, [[B-roll]], animations, and interviews conducted with NASA researchers, engineers, and astronauts, as well as with outside sources with expertise relevant to the topics being discussed.

The show is produced for a young adult audience, and stylistically this is accomplished through the use of hand-held cameras, quick edits, and numerous transitions, effects, and filters used in post-production.

''NASA 360'' was originally created in 2006 by producers Kevin Krigsvold and Michael Bibbo. It was hosted by Johnny Alonso and Jennifer Pulley through 2012. 23 episodes were produced during this period.

'''Nematology''' is the scientific discipline concerned with the study of [[nematode]]s, or roundworms. Although nematological investigation dates back to the days of [[Aristotle]] or even earlier, nematology as an independent discipline has its recognizable beginnings in the mid to late 19th century.&lt;ref name="Chen2004"&gt;Chen, Z. X., Chen, S. Y., and Dickson, D. W. (2004). "A Century of Plant Nematology", pp. 1–42 in ''Nematology Advances and Perspectives'', Vol 1. Tsinghua University Press, Beijing, China.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chitwood1950"&gt;Chitwood, B. G., and Chitwood, M. B. (1950). "An Introduction to Nematology", pp. 1–5 in ''Introduction to Nematology''.  University Park Press, Baltimore.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History: pre-1850 ==

Nematology research, like most fields of science, has its foundations in observations and the recording of these observations. The earliest written account of a nematode "sighting," as it were, may be found in the Pentateuch of the [[Old Testament]] in the Bible, in the Fourth Book of Moses called Numbers: "And the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died".&lt;ref&gt;Holy Bible, King James Version. (1979) p. 227. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Salt Lake City, Utah.&lt;/ref&gt; Although no empirical data exists to test the hypothesis, many nematologists assume and circumstantial evidence suggests the "fiery serpents" to be the Guinea worm, ''[[Dracunculus medinensis]]'', as this nematode is known to inhabit the region near the [[Red Sea]].&lt;ref name="Chitwood1950"/&gt;

Before 1750, a large number of nematode observations were recorded, many by the notable great minds of ancient civilization. [[Hippocrates]]&lt;ref&gt;Hippocrates (460-375 B.C.) 1849.  Works of Hippocrates, translated by F. Adams. London,  "Aphorisms."&lt;/ref&gt; (ca. 420 B.C.), [[Aristotle]]&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle (384-322 B.C.) 1910.  Historia animalium.  Translated by [[D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson]]. In: ''Works''. J. A. Smith and W. D. Ross, eds. Vol. IV. Garrison Morton.&lt;/ref&gt; (ca. 350 B.C.), [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus|Celsus]]&lt;ref&gt;Celsus, A. C.  (53 B.C.-7 A.D.) 1657. De medicina libri octo, ex recognitione Joh. Antonidae von Linden D. &amp; Prof. Med. Pract. Ord.&lt;/ref&gt; (ca 10 B.C.), [[Galen]]&lt;ref&gt;Galen, C.  (130–200) 1552. De simplicum medicamentorum faculatibus libre xi.  Lugdoni.&lt;/ref&gt; (ca. 180 A.D.) and [[Francesco Redi|Redi]]&lt;ref&gt;Redi, F. (1684) p. 253 in ''Osservazioni...intorno agli animali viventi che si trovano negli animali viventi''.  26 pls.  Firenze.&lt;/ref&gt; (1684) all described nematodes parasitizing humans or other large animals and birds. Borellus&lt;ref&gt;Borellus, P. (1653) p. 240 in ''Historiarum, et observationum medicophysicarum, centuria prima, etc.'' Castris.&lt;/ref&gt; (1653) was the first to observe and describe a free-living nematode, which he dubbed the "vinegar eel;" and Tyson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tyson, E. |title=Lumbricus Teres, or Some Anatomical Observations on the Round Worm Bred in Human Bodies. By Edward Tyson M. D. Col. Med. Lond. Nec Non. Reg. Societ. Soc|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London|volume=13|issue=143–154|pages=154|doi=10.1098/rstl.1683.0023|year=1683}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1683) used a crude microscope to describe the rough anatomy of the human intestinal roundworm, ''[[Ascaris lumbricoides]]''.

Other well-known microscopists spent time observing and describing free-living and animal-parasitic nematodes: [[Robert Hooke|Hooke]]&lt;ref&gt;Hooke, R. (1667). ''Micrographia: etc.''  London.&lt;/ref&gt; (1683), [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek|Leeuwenhoek]]&lt;ref&gt;Leeuwenhoek, A. (1722). ''Opera omnia seu arcana naturae (etc.)''.  Lugduni Batavorum.&lt;/ref&gt; (1722), [[John Needham|Needham]]&lt;ref name="Needham1743"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Needham, T. |title=A Letter from Mr. Turbevil Needham, to the President; Concerning Certain Chalky Tubulous Concretions, Called Malm: With Some Microscopical Observations on the Farina of the Red Lily, and of Worms Discovered in Smutty Corn|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London|volume=42|issue=462–471|pages=634|doi=10.1098/rstl.1742.0101|url=https://archive.org/stream/philtrans07586720/07586720_djvu.txt|year=1742}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1743), and [[Lazzaro Spallanzani|Spallanzani]]&lt;ref&gt;Spallanzani, L. (1769). ''Nouvelles recherches sur les decouvertes microscopiques, etc.''  Londres &amp; Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; (1769) are among these.&lt;ref name="Chitwood1950"/&gt; Observations and descriptions of plant parasitic nematodes, which were less conspicuous to ancient scientists, didn't receive as much or as early attention as did animal parasites. The earliest allusion to a plant parasitic nematode is, however, preserved in famous writ. "Sowed cockle, reap'd no corn," a line by [[William Shakespeare]] penned in 1594 in ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]'', Act IV, Scene 3, most certainly has reference to blighted wheat caused by the plant parasite, ''[[Anguina tritici]]''.&lt;ref name="Thorne1961"&gt;Thorne, G. (1961).  "Introduction", pp. 1–21 in ''Principles of Nematology''.  McGraw-Hill Book Company, Inc., New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

Needham&lt;ref name="Needham1743"/&gt; (1743) solved the "riddle of cockle" when he crushed one of the diseased wheat grains and observed "Aquatic Animals...denominated Worms, Eels, or Serpents, which they very much resemble." It is likely that few or no other recorded observations of plant parasitic nematodes or their effects are to be found in ancient literature.&lt;ref name="Steiner1960"&gt;Steiner, G. (1960). "Nematology-An Outlook", pp. 3–7 in ''Nematology: Fundamentals and Recent Advances''.  J. N. Sasser and W. R. Jenkins, eds. The University of North Carolina Press, Chapel Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1750 to the early 1900s, nematology research continued to be descriptive and taxonomic, focusing primarily on free-living nematodes and plant and animal parasites.&lt;ref name="VanGundy1987"&gt;Van Gundy, S. D. (1987). "Perspectives on Nematology Research", pp. 28–31 in ''Vistas on Nematology''. J. A. Veech and D. W. Dickson, eds.  Society of Nematologists, Inc. Hyattsville, Maryland.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period a number of productive researchers contributed to the field of nematology in the United States and abroad. Beginning with Needham and continuing to Cobb, nematologists compiled and continuously revised a broad descriptive morphological taxonomy of nematodes.

== History: 1850 to the present ==
[[Julius Kühn|Kuhn]]&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, J. (1874). "Ubers das Vorkommen von Ruben-Nematoden an den Wurzeln der Halmfruchte". ''Landwirts. Jahrb.''  3:47–50.&lt;/ref&gt; (1874) is thought to be the first to use soil [[fumigation]] to control nematodes, applying [[carbon disulfide]] treatments in sugar beet fields in Germany. In Europe from 1870 to 1910, nematological research focused heavily on controlling the sugar beet nematode as sugar beet production became an important economy during this time in the Old World.&lt;ref name="Thorne1961"/&gt;

Although 18th and 19th century scientists yielded a considerable amount of important fundamental and applied knowledge about nematode biology, nematology research really began to advance in quality and quantity near the turn of the 20th century. In 1918, the first permanent nematology field station was constructed in the U.S. Post Office in Salt Lake City, Utah under the direction of Harry B. Shaw, after scientists observed the sugar beet nematode in a field south of the city.&lt;ref name="Thorne1961"/&gt; In this same year, [[Nathan Cobb]] (1918) published his Contributions to a Science of Nematology and his lab manual "Estimating the Nema Population of Soil."&lt;ref&gt;Cobb, N. A. (1918). "Estimating the nema population of soil".  U.S. Department of Agriculture,  Bur. Plant. Indrusty,  Agr. Tech. Cir. 1:1–48.&lt;/ref&gt; These two publications provide definitive resources for many methods and apparatus used in nematology even to this day.&lt;ref name="Thorne1961"/&gt;

Of Cobb's far-reaching influence on nematology research, Jenkins and Taylor&lt;ref name="Jenkins1967"&gt;Jenkins, W. R., and Taylor, D. P. (1967). "Introduction", p. 7 in ''Plant Nematology''.  Reinhold Publishing Corporation, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; write:

:''Although many workers have played important roles in development of plant nematology, none have had a greater impact, particularly in the United States, than N.A. Cobb. In 1913 Cobb published his first paper on nematology in the United States. From [1913] to 1932 he was the undisputed leader in [nematology] in this country. Through his efforts the widely renowned [USDA] nematology research program was initiated and developed. Many of his students and colleagues developed into the leaders in plant nematology in the 1930s, 1940's, and 1950's. In addition, during his productive career he contributed major discoveries in the areas of nematode taxonomy, morphology, and in methodology. Many of his techniques are still unsurpassed!''

Perhaps no one person has had as favorable an impact on the field of nematology as has Nathan Augustus Cobb.

From 1900–1925 various state-run agricultural experimental stations investigated important problems relating to agro-economy, though few stations devoted much attention to plant-parasitic nematodes. Accounts of the history of nematology (the few that exist) mention three major events occurring between 1926 and 1950 that affected the relative importance of nematodes in the eyes of farmers, legislators and the U.S. public in general. These same events had profound worldwide effects on the course of nematology research over the next fifty to seventy-five years

First, the discovery of the [[Globodera rostochiensis|golden nematode]] in the potato fields of [[Long Island]] led to a trip by U.S. quarantine officials to the potato fields of Europe, where the devastating effects of this parasite had been known for many years. This excursion allayed all skepticism about the seriousness of this agricultural pest. Second, the introduction of the soil fumigants, D-D and [[1,2-Dibromoethane|EDB]] made available for the first time nematicides that could be used effectively and practically on a field scale. Third, the development of nematode-resistant crop cultivars brought substantial government funding to applied nematology research.&lt;ref name="Thorne1961"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VanGundy1987"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christie, J. R. (1960). "The Role of the Nematologist", pp. 8–11 in ''Nematology: Fundamentals and Recent Advances''.  J. N. Sasser and W. R. Jenkins, eds.

These events contributed to a shift from broad taxonomy-based nematology research to deep, yet focused investigations of plant parasitic nematodes, especially the control of agricultural pests. From the early 1930s until recently, the bulk of researchers studying nematodes have been plant pathologists by training.&lt;ref name="VanGundy1987"/&gt;  Consequently, nematological research leaned heavily toward answering plant pathological and agro-economical questions for the last three-quarters of the 20th century.

Nematologists in the 1800s also contributed to other scientific fields in important ways.
[[Otto_Bütschli|Butschli]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Butschli, O.]]  (1875). "Vorlaufige Mittheilung uber Untersuchungen betreffend die ersten Entwickelungsvorgange im befruchehen Ei von Nematoden und Schnecken". ''Ztschr. Wiss. Zool.'' v. 25:201–213.&lt;/ref&gt; (1875) first observed the formation of polar bodies by [[nuclear subdivision]] in a nematode, [[Edouard Van Beneden|Beneden]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Beneden, E. van.]] (1883). ''Recherches sur la maturation de l'oeuf, la fecondation et la division cellulaire''.  Gand &amp; Leipzig.&lt;/ref&gt; (1883) was studying ''Ascaris megalocephala'' when he discovered the separation of halves of each of the [[chromosome]]s from the two parents and the mechanism of Mendelian heredity, and [[Theodor Boveri|Boveri]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Boveri, T.]] (1893). "Ueber die Entstehung des Gegensatzes zwischen den Geschlectszellen und den somatischen Zellen bei Ascaris megalocephala, nebst Bemerkungen zur Entwicklungsgeschichte der Nematoden". ''Sitzungsb. Gesellsch. Morph. u. Physiol.'' in Munchen.&lt;/ref&gt; (1893) showed evidence for continuity of the germ plasm and that the soma may be regarded as a by-product without influence upon heredity.&lt;ref name="Chitwood1950"/&gt;

[[Caenorhabditis elegans]] is a widely used [[model species]], initially for neural development, and then for genetics. [[WormBase]] collates research on the species.

The '''Philip Morris v. Uruguay case'''  ({{lang-es|'''Caso Philip Morris contra Uruguay'''}}) started on 19 February 2010, when the multinational [[tobacco company]] [[Philip Morris International]] filed a complaint against [[Uruguay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.espectador.com/1v4_contenido.php?id=176011&amp;sts=1 |title = Philip Morris versus Uruguay |author = El Espectador |date = 9 March 2010 |accessdate = 15 November 2010 |language = Spanish |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100314160056/http://www.espectador.com/1v4_contenido.php?id=176011&amp;sts=1 |archivedate = 14 March 2010 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The company complains that Uruguay's [[smoking ban|anti-smoking legislation]] devalues its cigarette trademarks and investments in the country and is suing Uruguay for compensation under the [[bilateral investment treaty]] between Switzerland and Uruguay.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; (Philip Morris is headquartered in [[Lausanne]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pmi.com/marketpages/pages/market_en_ch.aspx | title =Philip Morris International Management SA - Switzerland Operations Centre | author = [[Philip Morris International|PMI]] | accessdate = 15 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The treaty provides that disputes are settled by binding [[arbitration]] before the [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes]] (ICSID).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/uruguay-wins-dispute-tobacco-giant-philip-morris-40448855 | title=Uruguay Wins Dispute With Tobacco Giant Philip Morris | work=ABC News | date=8 July 2016 | author=AP | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160709143704/http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/uruguay-wins-dispute-tobacco-giant-philip-morris-40448855 | archive-date=2016-07-09 | access-date=23 October 2016 | dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uruguay had received accolades from the [[World Health Organization]] and from anti-smoking activists for its [[Tobacco control|anti-smoking campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.elobservador.com.uy/noticia/208683/cigarrillos-mentolados-aumentan-la-adiccion/|title = Cigarrillos mentolados aumentan la adicción|author = El Observador |date = 6 September 2011|accessdate =13 September 2011 |language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 July 2016, after 6 years, the [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes|ICSID]] ruled in favor of Uruguay, forcing the demandant to pay the expenses of the defendants and the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.elpais.com.uy/informacion/fallo-favorable-uruguay-juicio-philip-morris.html |title =Philip Morris deberá pagar a Uruguay US$ 7 millones por gastos judiciales|author = [[El País (Uruguay)|El País]]|language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias-america-latina-36752509|title =Histórico fallo a favor de Uruguay en el juicio contra la tabacalera Philip Morris|author =BCC |language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/economia/esta-es-la-historia-de-uruguay-david-contra-philip-morris-goliath.html |title =Esta es la historia de Uruguay (David) contra Philip Morris (Goliath) |author =elfinanciero|language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 June 2003, when the Uruguayan President was [[Jorge Batlle]], the [[General Assembly of Uruguay]] approved the [[Framework Convention on Tobacco Control]], an agreement whereby Policies recommended by the [[World Health Organization]] were implemented.

In 2006, Uruguay under President [[Tabaré Vázquez]], an [[oncologist]] by profession, began to enact comprehensive [[smoking ban|anti-smoking legislation]].
On 1 March 2006, Uruguay became the first country in [[Latin America]] to prohibit smoking in enclosed public spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.lr21.com.uy/comunidad/461696-uruguay-cree-que-philip-morris-incumplio-pasos-previos-a-la-demanda| title = Uruguay cree que Philip Morris incumplió pasos previos a la demanda |author =LR21| date =9 July 2011|accessdate =4 August 2011|language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2008 the legislature approved Law 18.256 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.parlamento.gub.uy/leyes/AccesoTextoLey.asp?Ley=18256&amp;Anchor|title = Ley Nº 18.256 Control del Tabaquismo|author = Uruguay Legislature|date = 6 March 2008|accessdate = 10 March 2009|language = Spanish|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140416104642/http://www.parlamento.gub.uy/leyes/AccesoTextoLey.asp?Ley=18256&amp;Anchor|archivedate = 16 April 2014|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which includes six strategies of anti-smoking policy.

Some of the measures by the government were the ban on selling different types of presentations of the same brand of cigarettes, the dissemination of images warning about the risks of smoking and covering at least 80% of the cigarette pack, raising of taxes, banning cigarette advertising in the media, and banning sponsorship of sports events. In addition, smoking was banned in public places such as offices, student centers, bars, restaurants, dances and public places, among others.

The smokefree campaign "Libre de Humo de Tabaco" was gradually implemented by the "Ministerio de Salud Pública del Uruguay" ([[List of Ministers for Public Health (Uruguay)|Ministry of Public Health of Uruguay]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.msp.gub.uy/uc_546_1.html|title = Campaña "Libre de Humo de Tabaco"|author = MSP|accessdate = 15 November 2010|language = Spanish|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100615005816/http://www.msp.gub.uy/uc_546_1.html|archivedate = 15 June 2010|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Complaint ==

[[Philip Morris International]] is a multinational company, a leading producer of cigarettes, of which it owns seven out of twenty global brands.

The tobacco company initiated a claim in the [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes]] (ICSID), a part of the [[World Bank]] seeking $25 million in compensation from Uruguay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[Alfred-Maurice de Zayas]]|title=How can Philip Morris sue Uruguay over its tobacco laws?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/16/philip-morris-uruguay-tobacco-isds-human-rights|website=The Guardian|accessdate=22 October 2016|date=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that forum, an arbitration tribunal was formed with one arbitrator appointed by each party and a third arbitrator elected by the arbitrators appointed by the parties. The plaintiffs are FTR Holding SA (Switzerland), Philip Morris Products SA (Switzerland) and Abal Hermanos SA (PMI representative in Uruguay) against Uruguay (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/7).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/FrontServlet|title = ICSID - Case Details|author = [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes|ICSID]]|date = 26 March 2010|accessdate =17 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote |"''We have no choice but to litigate''" said Rees. The company said it has sought to dialogue with the government without success.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web|url =  http://www.bbc.co.uk/mundo/economia/2010/03/100312_uruguay_tabacaleras_philip_morris_demanda_estado_jp.shtml| title = Tabacalera Philip Morris demanda a Uruguay |author = [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]]|date = 12 March 2010 |accessdate = 15 November 2010|language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Morgan Rees, Director Communications Regulatory  Philip Morris International, in 2010.}}

{{Quote |"''Philip Morris'' (which sued Uruguay for its anti smoking measures) ''wants to make an example to Uruguay and intimidate other countries''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hCgOmyRviMOvZIDa7TXoTwyoZtIg?docId=CNG.371586affc56793778e3f8ab1c8ee273.1b1|title = Philip Morris quiere dar un "escarmiento" a Uruguay, acusa ex presidente| date = 15 November 2010|author = [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]]|accessdate = 10 March 2009|language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;| [[Tabaré Vázquez]], November 2010.}}

Philip Morris has filed similar cases against [[Norway]] and [[Australia]].

== Decision == 
On 2 July 2013, the tribunal decided it had jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.italaw.com/sites/default/files/case-documents/italaw1531.pdf |title =Decision on Jurisdiction |date=4 July 2013|accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resolution of the case, which affected international&amp;nbsp;[[jurisprudence]], took 6 years; the case ended on 8 July 2016. The [[World Bank]] [ICSID] ruled in favor of Uruguay, forcing the demandant to pay the costs of the defendants and the court.
The final report established that [[Philip Morris International|Philip Morris]] had to pay 7 million [[dollars]] to the country for judicial expenses, in addition to paying different amounts for the fees and administrative expenses of the three arbitrators and the CADI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.elpais.com.uy/informacion/fallo-favorable-uruguay-juicio-philip-morris.html|title = Philip Morris deberá pagar a Uruguay US$ 7 millones por gastos judiciales|author = [[El País (Uruguay)|El País]]|language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gary Born]] emitted a discordant decision in two of the points of the judicial failure.

After its victory in the case, the government declared that from 2017 cigarettes in Uruguay will be sold in [[Plain tobacco packaging|generic packaging]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.elobservador.com.uy/a-partir-2017-los-cigarrillos-se-venderan-empaquetado-generico-n940912 |title =A partir de 2017 los cigarrillos se venderán en empaquetado genérico  |author= El Observador|language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.teledoce.com/telemundo/nacionales/vazquez-anuncio-en-cadena-nacional-que-uruguay-gano-juicio-a-philips-morris/|title= Vázquez anunció en cadena nacional que Uruguay ganó juicio a Philips Morris|author = Canal 12|language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www.lr21.com.uy/politica/1302400-tabare-vazquez-aclaro-prohibicion-fumar-areas-publica-cerradas-incluye-marihuana |title = Drogas|author  = LR21|language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PAHO made a statement praising the decision:
{{Quote |"''This decision is an acknowledgment of Uruguay's continued efforts to protect its population from tobacco use and tobacco smoke from others.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=12273%3Apaho-congratulates-uruguay-for-defending-tobacco-control-policies-against-tobacco-industry&amp;Itemid=1926&amp;lang=es | title = OMS y OPS felicitan a Uruguay por su victoria ante Philip Morris |author= [[Organización Mundial de la Salud|OPS]]|language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; |Carissa Etienne, Director of the [[Pan American Health Organization]], August 2016.}}

== Effects ==

According to Enrico Bonadio, Senior Lecturer in Law at [[City University London]], the ruling in the case "may make it more difficult for tobacco companies to use lawsuits to produce a “[[chilling effect]]” and so discourage countries from introducing tobacco control policies."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/uruguays-victory-against-big-tobacco-is-more-than-just-a-local-triumph-62319|title=Uruguay's victory against Big Tobacco is more than just a local triumph|author= theconversation|access-date=2016-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protocol analysis is used to study thinking in [[cognitive psychology]] (Crutcher, 1994), [[cognitive science]] (Simon &amp; Kaplan, 1989), and behavior analysis (Austin &amp; Delaney, 1998). It has found further application in the design of surveys and interviews (Sudman, Bradburn &amp; Schwarz, 1996), [[usability testing]] (Henderson, Smith, Podd, &amp; Varela-Alvarez, 1995), [[educational psychology]] (Pressley &amp; Afflerbach 1995; Renkl, 1997) and [[design research]] (Gero &amp; McNeill 1998) .

'''Public administration''' is the implementation of [[public policy|government policy]] and also an academic discipline that studies this implementation and prepares [[civil servant]]s for working in the public service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.infoplease.com/public-administration |title=Random House Unabridged Dictionary |publisher=Dictionary.infoplease.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a "field of inquiry with a diverse scope" whose fundamental goal is to "advance management and policies so that government can function".&lt;ref&gt;''Handbook of Public Administration''. Eds Jack Rabin, W. Bartley Hildreth, and Gerard J. Miller. 1989: Marcel Dekker, NY. p. iii&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the various definitions which have been offered for the term are: "the management of public programs";&lt;ref&gt;Robert and Janet Denhardt. ''Public Administration: An Action Orientation''. 6th Ed. 2009: Thomson Wadsworth, Belmont CA.&lt;/ref&gt; the "translation of [[politics]] into the reality that [[citizen]]s see every day";&lt;ref name="KettlDonald"&gt;Kettl, Donald and James Fessler. 2009. ''The Politics of the Administrative Process''. Washington D.C.: CQ Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and "the study of government decision making, the [[policy analysis|analysis of the policies]] themselves, the various inputs that have produced them, and the inputs necessary to produce alternative policies."&lt;ref&gt;Jerome B. McKinney and Lawrence C. Howard. Public Administration: Balancing Power and Accountability. 2nd Ed. 1998: Praeger Publishing, Westport, CT. p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

Public administration is "centrally concerned with the organization of government policies and programs as well as the behavior of officials (usually non-elected) formally responsible for their conduct".&lt;ref&gt;UN Economic and Social Council. Committee of Experts on Public Administration. Definition of basic concepts and terminologies in governance and public administration. 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Many unelected [[public servant]]s can be considered to be public administrators, including heads of city, county, regional, state and federal departments such as municipal budget directors, [[human resources]] (HR) administrators, [[city manager]]s, [[census]] managers, state [[mental health]] directors, and [[cabinet secretaries]].&lt;ref name="KettlDonald" /&gt; Public administrators are [[public servant]]s working in public departments and agencies, at all levels of government.

In the United States, civil servants and academics such as [[Woodrow Wilson]] promoted [[U.S. Civil Service Reform#The Pendleton Act|civil service reform]] in the 1880s, moving public administration into [[academia]].&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;Wilson, Woodrow. June, 1887. "[[The Study of Administration]]", ''Political Science Quarterly'' 2.&lt;/ref&gt; However, "until the mid-20th century and the dissemination of the German sociologist [[Max Weber]]'s theory of bureaucracy" there was not "much interest in a theory of public administration".&lt;ref&gt;Public administration.

In 1947 [[Paul H. Appleby]] defined public administration as "public leadership of public affairs directly responsible for executive action". In a democracy, it has to do with such leadership and executive action in terms that respect and contribute to the dignity, the worth, and the potentials of the citizen.&lt;ref&gt;Appleby, Paul 1947. "Toward Better Public Administration", ''[[Public Administration Review]]'' Vol. 7, No. 2 pp. 93–99.&lt;/ref&gt; One year later, Gordon Clapp, then Chairman of the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] defined public administration "as a public instrument whereby democratic society may be more completely realized." This implies that it must "relate itself to concepts of justice, liberty, and fuller economic opportunity for human beings" and is thus "concerned with "people, with ideas, and with things".&lt;ref&gt;Clapp, Gordon. 1948. "Public Administration in an Advancing South", ''[[Public Administration Review]]'' Vol. 8. no. 2 pp. 169–75. Clapp attributed part of this definition to Charles Beard.&lt;/ref&gt; According to James D. Carroll &amp; Alfred M. Zuck, the publication by "Woodrow Wilson of his essay, "[[The Study of Administration]]" in 1887 is generally regarded as the beginning of public administration as a specific field of study".&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, J.D. &amp; Zuck, A.M. (1983). "The Study of Public Administration Revisited". ''A Report of the Centennial Agendas project of the American Society for Public Administration''. Washington, DC; American Society for Public Administration.&lt;/ref&gt;

Drawing on the democracy theme and discarding the link to the executive branch, [[Patricia M. Shields]] asserts that public administration "deals with the stewardship and implementation of the products of a living democracy".&lt;ref&gt;Shields, Patricia. 1998. [https://digital.library.txstate.edu/handle/10877/3954 "Pragmatism as a Philosophy of Science: A Tool for Public Administration]" Research in Public Administration Vol. 4. pp. 195–225.&lt;/ref&gt;  The key term "product" refers to "those items that are constructed or produced" such as prisons, roads, laws, schools, and security. "As implementors, public managers engage these products." They participate in the doing and making of the "living" democracy. A living democracy is "an environment that is changing, organic", imperfect, inconsistent and teaming with values. "Stewardship is emphasized because public administration is concerned "with accountability and effective use of scarce resources and ultimately making the connection between the doing, the making and democratic values".&lt;ref&gt;Shields, Patricia. 1998. [https://digital.library.txstate.edu/handle/10877/3954 "Pragmatism as a Philosophy of Science: A Tool for Public Administration"], ''Research in Public Administration'' Vol. 4. p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently scholars claim that "public administration has no generally accepted definition", because the "scope of the subject is so great and so debatable that it is easier to explain than define".&lt;ref name="thecanadianencyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/public-administration/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170328003943/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/public-administration/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=March 28, 2017|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|accessdate=March 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public administration is a field of study (i.e., a discipline) and an occupation. There is much disagreement about whether the study of public administration can properly be called a discipline, largely because of the debate over whether public administration is a subfield of [[political science]] or a subfield of [[administration (government)|administrative science]]", the latter an outgrowth of its roots in policy analysis and evaluation research.&lt;ref name="thecanadianencyclopedia" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haveman, R. H. (1987). Policy analysis and evaluation research after twenty years. "Policy Studies Journal", 16(1): 191–218.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar Donald Kettl is among those who view public administration "as a subfield within political science".&lt;ref name="h-net"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Future of Public Administration |first=Donald F. |last=Kettl |url=http://www.h-net.org/~pubadmin/tfreport/kettl.pdf  |format=PDF |publisher=H-net.org |accessdate=October 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lalor a society with a public authority that provides at least one [[public good]] can be said to have a public administration whereas the absence of either (or ''a fortiori'' both) a public authority or the provision of at least one public good implies the absence of a public administration. He argues that public administration is the public provision of public goods in which the demand function is satisfied more or less effectively by politics, whose primary tool is rhetoric, providing for public goods, and the supply function is satisfied more or less efficiently by public management, whose primary tools are speech acts, producing public goods.  The moral purpose of public administration, implicit in its acceptance of its role, is the maximization of the opportunities of the public to satisfy its wants.&lt;ref&gt;Lalor, Stephen ''A General Theory of Public Administration'' (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[North American Industry Classification System]] definition of the Public Administration (NAICS 91) sector states that public administration "... comprises establishments primarily engaged in activities of a governmental nature, that is, the enactment and judicial interpretation of laws and their pursuant regulations, and the administration of programs based on them". This includes "Legislative activities, taxation, national defense, public order and safety, immigration services, foreign affairs and international assistance, and the administration of government programs are activities that are purely governmental in nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ic.gc.ca/cis-sic/cis-sic.nsf/IDE/cis-sic91defe.html |title=Definition Public Administration (NAICS 91) |publisher=Ic.gc.ca |accessdate= October 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the academic perspective, the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) in the United States defines the study of public administration as "A program that prepares individuals to serve as managers in the executive arm of local, state, and federal government and that focuses on the systematic study of executive organization and management. Includes instruction in the roles, development, and principles of public administration; the management of public policy; executive-legislative relations; public budgetary processes and financial management; administrative law; public personnel management; professional ethics; and research methods."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/cipcode/cipdetail.aspx?y=55&amp;cipid=88560 |title=CIP user site |publisher=Nces.ed.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Globalize/US|date=February 2016}}

===Antiquity to the 19th century===
Dating back to Antiquity, Pharaohs, kings and emperors have required pages, treasurers, and tax collectors to administer the practical business of government. Prior to the 19th century, staffing of most public administrations was rife with nepotism, favouritism, and political patronage, which was often referred to as a "[[spoils system]]". Public administrators have long been the "eyes and ears" of rulers. In medieval times, the abilities to read and write, add and subtract were as dominated by the educated elite as public employment. Consequently, the need for expert civil servants whose ability to read and write formed the basis for developing expertise in such necessary activities as legal record-keeping, paying and feeding armies and levying [[tax]]es.  As the European Imperialist age progressed and the militarily powers extended their hold over other continents and people, the need for a sophisticated public administration grew.

The field of [[management]] may well be said to have originated in ancient China,&lt;ref name="Ewan Ferlie p.30"&gt;Ewan Ferlie, Laurence E. Lynn, Christopher Pollitt (2005) ''The Oxford Handbook of Public Management'', p.30.&lt;/ref&gt; including possibly the first highly centralized [[Bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] state, and the earliest (by the second century BC) example of an [[meritocracy|administration based on merit]] through [[Imperial examination|testing]].&lt;ref name="APHq"&gt;Kazin, Edwards, and Rothman (2010), 142. ''One of the oldest examples of a merit-based civil service system existed' in the imperial bureaucracy of China.''

Creel]] and other scholars find the influence of Chinese administration in Europe by the 12th century, for example, in [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Fredrick II]]'s promulgations, characterized as the "birth certificate of modern bureaucracy".&lt;ref&gt;Ewan Ferlie, Laurence E. Lynn, Christopher Pollitt 2005 p.30, ''The Oxford Handbook of Public Management''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herrlee G. Creel, 1974 p.119. "Shen Pu-Hai: A Secular Philosopher of Administration", ''Journal of Chinese Philosophy'' Volume 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Creel, "The Origins of Statecraft in China, I", ''The Western Chou Empire'', Chicago, pp.9-27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Otto B. Van der Sprenkel, "Max Weber on China", ''History and Theory'' '''3''' (1964), 357.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Chinese administration cannot be traced to any one individual, emphasizing a [[merit system]] figures of the [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Fa-Jia]] like 4th century BC reformer [[Shen Buhai]] (400–337 BC) may have had more influence than any other, and might be considered its founder, if not valuable as a rare pre-modern example of abstract theory of administration. Creel writes that, in Shen Buhai, there are the "seeds of the [[civil service examination]]", and that, if one wishes to exaggerate, it would "no doubt be possible to translate Shen Buhai's term Shu, or technique, as 'science'", and argue that he was the first political scientist, though Creel does "not care to go this far".&lt;ref&gt;Creel, What Is Taoism?, 94

The eighteenth-century noble, [[Frederick William I of Prussia|King Frederick William I of Prussia]], created professorates in [[Kameralism|Cameralism]] in an effort to train a new class of public administrators. The universities of [[Frankfurt an der Oder]] and [[University of Halle]] were [[Prussia]]n institutions emphasizing economic and social disciplines, with the goal of societal reform. [[Johann Heinrich Gottlob Justi]] was the most well-known professor of Cameralism. Thus, from a Western European perspective, Classic, Medieval, and Enlightenment-era scholars formed the foundation of the discipline that has come to be called public administration.

[[Lorenz von Stein]], an 1855 German professor from [[Vienna]], is considered the founder of the science of public administration in many parts of the world. In the time of Von Stein, public administration was considered a form of administrative law, but Von Stein believed this concept too restrictive. Von Stein taught that public administration relies on many prestablished disciplines such as [[sociology]], [[political science]], [[administrative law]] and [[public finance]]. He called public administration an integrating science, and stated that public administrators should be concerned with both theory and practice. He argued that public administration is a science because knowledge is generated and evaluated according to the scientific method.

Modern American public administration is an extension of democratic governance, justified by classic and liberal philosophers of the western world ranging from [[Aristotle]] to [[John Locke]]&lt;ref&gt;''Second Treatise on Government''&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Thomas Jefferson]].&lt;ref&gt;Declaration of Independence&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, M., Mejia, B., and Georgiev, M.

[[File:Woodrow Wilson (Nobel 1919).jpg|thumb|[[Woodrow Wilson]]]]
In the [[United States|United States of America]], [[Woodrow Wilson]] is considered the father of public administration. He first formally recognized public administration in an 1887 article entitled "[[The Study of Administration]]". The future president wrote that "it is the object of administrative study to discover, first, what government can properly and successfully do, and, secondly, how it can do these proper things with the utmost possible efficiency and at the least possible cost either of money or of energy".&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt; Wilson was more influential to the science of public administration than Von Stein, primarily due to an article Wilson wrote in 1887 in which he advocated four concepts:

* Separation of politics and administration
* Comparative analysis of political and private organizations
* Improving efficiency with business-like practices and attitudes toward daily operations
* Improving the effectiveness of public service through management and by training civil servants, [[merit pay|merit]]-based assessment

The separation of politics and administration has been the subject of lasting debate.  The different perspectives regarding this dichotomy contribute to differentiating characteristics of the suggested generations of public administration.

By the 1920s, scholars of public administration had responded to Wilson's solicitation and thus textbooks in this field were introduced. A few distinguished scholars of that period were, [[Luther Gulick (social scientist)|Luther Gulick]], [[Lyndall Urwick]], [[Henri Fayol]], [[Frederick Winslow Taylor|Frederick Taylor]], and others. Frederick Taylor (1856–1915), another prominent scholar in the field of administration and management also published a book entitled ''The Principles of Scientific Management'' (1911). He believed that scientific analysis would lead to the discovery of the "one best way" to do things or carrying out an operation. This, according to him could help save cost and time. Taylor's technique was later introduced to private industrialists, and later into the various government organizations (Jeong, 2007).&lt;ref name="JeongChun"&gt;Jeong Chun Hai Ibrahim, &amp; Nor Fadzlina Nawi. (2007). ''Principles of Public Administration: An Introduction.'' Kuala Lumpur: Karisma Publications. {{ISBN|978-983-195-253-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylor's approach is often referred to as Taylor's Principles or Taylorism. Taylor's scientific management consisted of main four principles (Frederick W. Taylor, 1911):
* Replace rule-of-thumb work methods with methods based on a scientific study of the tasks.
* Scientifically select, train, and develop each employee rather than passively leaving them to train themselves.
* Provide "detailed instruction and supervision of each worker in the performance of that worker's discrete task" (Montgomery 1997: 250).
* Divide work nearly equally between managers and workers, so that the managers apply scientific management principles to planning the work and the workers actually perform the tasks.

Taylor had very precise ideas about how to introduce his system (approach):
'It is only through enforced standardization of methods, enforced adoption of the best implements and working conditions, and enforced cooperation that this faster work can be assured. And the duty of enforcing the adoption of standards and enforcing this cooperation rests with management alone.'&lt;ref&gt;Frederick W. Taylor. (1856–1915). ''Principles of Scientific Management''. New York &amp; London: Harper Brothers; Also see, Jeong Chun Hai Ibrahim, &amp; Nor Fadzlina Nawi. (2007). ''Principles of Public Administration: An Introduction.'' Kuala Lumpur: Karisma Publications. {{ISBN|978-983-195-253-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Society for Public Administration]] (ASPA) the leading professional group for public administration was founded in 1939. ASPA sponsors the journal [[Public Administration Review]], which was founded in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aspanet.org/scriptcontent/ASPAgeneral.cfm |title=Our Web Site Has Moved! |publisher=Aspanet.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111203193218/http://www.aspanet.org/scriptcontent/ASPAgeneral.cfm |archive-date=2011-12-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===US in the 1940s===
[[File:Luther Gulick (social scientist).jpg|thumb|left|[[Luther Gulick (social scientist)|Luther Gulick]] (1892–1993) was an expert on public administration.]]

The separation of politics and administration advocated by Wilson continues to play a significant role in public administration today. However, the dominance of this dichotomy was challenged by second generation scholars, beginning in the 1940s. [[Luther Gulick (social scientist)|Luther Gulick]]'s fact-value dichotomy was a key contender for Wilson's proposed politics-administration dichotomy. In place of Wilson's first generation split, Gulick advocated a "seamless web of discretion and interaction".&lt;ref&gt;Fry, Brian R. 1989. Mastering Public Administration; from Max Weber to Dwight Waldo. Chatham, New Jersey: Chatham House Publishers, Inc. p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

Luther Gulick and [[Lyndall Urwick]] are two second-generation scholars. Gulick, Urwick, and the new generation of administrators built on the work of contemporary behavioural, administrative, and organizational scholars including [[Henri Fayol]], [[Fredrick Winslow Taylor]], Paul Appleby, Frank Goodnow, and Willam Willoughby. The new generation of organizational theories no longer relied upon logical assumptions and generalizations about human nature like classical and enlightened theorists.

Gulick developed a comprehensive, generic theory of organization that emphasized the scientific method, efficiency, professionalism, structural reform, and executive control. Gulick summarized the duties of administrators with an acronym; [[POSDCORB]], which stands for planning, organizing, staffing, directing, coordinating, reporting, and budgeting. Fayol developed a systematic, 14-point treatment of private management. Second-generation theorists drew upon private management practices for administrative sciences. A single, generic management theory bleeding the borders between the private and the public sector was thought to be possible. With the general theory, the administrative theory could be focused on governmental organizations. The mid-1940s theorists challenged Wilson and Gulick. The politics-administration dichotomy remained the centre of criticism.

====1950s to the 1970s====
During the 1950s, the United States experienced prolonged prosperity and solidified its place as a world leader. Public Administration experienced a kind of heyday due to the successful war effort and successful post war reconstruction in Western Europe and Japan. Government was popular as was President Eisenhower. In the 1960s and 1970s, government itself came under fire as ineffective, inefficient, and largely a wasted effort.  The costly [[Vietnam War|American intervention in Vietnam]] along with domestic scandals including the bugging of Democratic party headquarters (the 1974 [[Watergate]] scandal) are two examples of self-destructive government behaviour that alienated citizens.
[[File:B-52D(061127-F-1234S-017).jpg|thumb|right|The costly [[Vietnam War]] alienated U.S. citizens from their government (pictured is [[Operation Arc Light]], a U.S. bombing operation)]]
There was a call by citizens for efficient administration to replace ineffective, wasteful bureaucracy. Public administration would have to distance itself from politics to answer this call and remain effective. Elected officials supported these reforms.  The [[Hoover Commission]], chaired by University of Chicago professor [[Louis Brownlow]], to examine reorganization of government. Brownlow subsequently founded the Public Administration Service (PAS) at the university, an organization which has provided consulting services to all levels of government until the 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Concurrently, after [[World War II]], the whole concept of public administration expanded to include policymaking and analysis, thus the study of "administrative policy making and analysis" was introduced and enhanced into the government decision-making bodies. Later on, the human factor became a predominant concern and emphasis in the study of public administration. This period witnessed the development and inclusion of other social sciences knowledge, predominantly, psychology, anthropology, and sociology, into the study of public administration (Jeong, 2007).&lt;ref name="JeongChun" /&gt; Henceforth, the emergence of scholars such as, [[Fritz Morstein Marx]] with his book ''The Elements of Public Administration'' (1946), Paul H. Appleby ''Policy and Administration'' (1952), Frank Marini 'Towards a New Public Administration' (1971), and others that have contributed positively in these endeavors.

===1980s–1990s===
In the late 1980s, yet another generation of public administration theorists began to displace the last.  The new theory, which came to be called [[New Public Management]], was proposed by David Osborne and Ted Gaebler in their book ''Reinventing Government''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Kamensky  | first = John M. | title = Role of the "Reinventing Government" movement in Federal management reform | journal = [[Public Administration Review]] | volume = 56 | issue = 3 | pages = 247–55 | doi = 10.2307/976448 | jstor = 976448  | date = May–June 1996 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new model advocated the use of private sector-style models, organizational ideas and values to improve the efficiency and service-orientation of the public sector. During the [[Clinton Administration]] (1993–2001), Vice President [[Al Gore]] adopted and reformed federal agencies using NPM approaches. In the 1990s, new public management became prevalent throughout the bureaucracies of the US, the UK and, to a lesser extent, in Canada. The original public management theories have roots attributed to policy analysis, according to [[Richard Elmore]] in his 1986 article published in the "[[Journal of Policy Analysis and Management]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Elmore | first = Richard F. | author-link = Richard Elmore | title = Graduate education in public management: working the seams of government | journal = [[Journal of Policy Analysis and Management]] | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 69–83 | doi = 10.1002/pam.4050060107 | date = 1986 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some modern authors define NPM as a combination of splitting large bureaucracies into smaller, more fragmented agencies, encouraging competition between different public agencies, and encouraging competition between public agencies and private firms and using economic incentives lines (e.g., performance pay for senior executives or user-pay models).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Margetts | first1 = Helen | last2 = Dunleavy | first2 = Patrick | last3 = Bastow | first3 = Simon | last4 = Tinkler | first4 = Jane | author-link1 = Helen Margetts | author-link2 = Patrick Dunleavy | title = New public management is dead – long live digital-era governance | journal = [[Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory]] | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 467–94 | doi = 10.1093/jopart/mui057 | date = July 2006 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; NPM treats individuals as "customers" or "clients" (in the private sector sense), rather than as citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Diane Stone, (2008) "Global Public Policy, Transnational Policy Communities and their Networks", ''Journal of Policy Sciences''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics argue that the New Public Management concept of treating people as "customers" rather than "citizens" is an inappropriate borrowing from the private sector model, because businesses see customers as a means to an end (profit), rather than as the proprietors of government (the owners), opposed to merely the customers of a business (the patrons). In New Public Management, people are viewed as economic units not democratic participants which is the hazard of linking an MBA (business administration, economic and employer-based model) too closely with the public administration (governmental, [[public good]]) sector. Nevertheless, the NPM model (one of four described by Elmore in 1986, including the "generic model") is still widely accepted at multiple levels of government (e.g., municipal, state/province, and federal) and in many OECD nations.

In the late 1990s, Janet and Robert Denhardt proposed a new public services model in response to the dominance of NPM.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Denhardt | first1 = Robert B. | last2 = Vinzant Denhardt | first2 = Janet | title = The new public service: serving rather than steering | journal = [[Public Administration Review]] | volume = 60 | issue = 6 | pages = 549–59 | doi = 10.1111/0033-3352.00117 | jstor = 977437 | date = November–December 2000 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; A successor to NPM is [[digital era governance]], focusing on themes of reintegrating government responsibilities, needs-based holism (executing duties in cursive ways), and digitalization (exploiting the transformational capabilities of modern IT and digital storage). One example of this is [[Open Forum (Australia)|openforum.com.au]], an Australian non-for-profit eDemocracy project which invites politicians, senior public servants, academics, business people and other key stakeholders to engage in high-level policy debate.

Another new public service model is what has been called New Public Governance, an approach which includes a centralization of power; an increased number, role and influence of partisan-political staff; personal-politicization of appointments to the senior public service; and, the assumption that the public service is promiscuously partisan for the government of the day.&lt;ref&gt;Aucoin, Peter (2008). "New Public Management and the Quality of Government: Coping with the New Political Governance in Canada", Conference on ''New Public Management and the Quality of Government'', SOG and the Quality of Government Institute, University of Gothenburg, Sweden, 13–15 November 2008, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1980s, the goal of community programs in the United States was often represented by terms such as independent living, [[community integration]], inclusion, community participation, [[deinstitutionalization]], and civil rights. Thus, the same public policy (and public administration) was to apply to all citizens, inclusive of disability. However, by the 1990s, categorical state systems were strengthened in the United States (Racino, in press, 2014), and efforts were made to introduce more disability content into the public policy curricula&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Elmore | first1 = Richard F. | last2 = Watson | first2 = Sara | last3 = Pfeiffer | first3 = David | author-link1 = Richard Elmore | title = A case for including disability policy issues in public policy curricula | journal = Journal of Policy Analysis and Management (Curriculum and Case Notes) | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 167–73 | doi = 10.2307/3325146 | date = 1992 | ref = harv | jstor = 3325146 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with disability public policy (and administration) distinct fields in their own right.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Zola | first = Irving K. | author-link = Irving Zola | contribution = Introduction | editor-last1 = Brown | editor-first1 = Susan T. | title = An Independent Living Approach to Disability Policy Studies | pages =  | publisher = Research and Training Center on Public Policy And Independent Living, World Institute on Disability | location = Berkeley, CA | year = 1993 | oclc = 36404707 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Racino | first = Julie A. | title = Public administration and disability community services administration in the US | publisher = CRC Press | location = Boca Raton | year = 2015 | isbn = 9781466579828 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Behaviorists have also dominated "intervention practice" (generally not the province of public administration) in recent years, believing that they are in opposition to generic public policy (termed [[ecological systems theory]], of the late [[Urie Bronfenbrenner]]).

Increasingly, [[public policy]] academics and practitioners have utilized the theoretical concepts of [[political economy]] to explain policy outcomes such as the success or failure of reform efforts or the persistence of suboptimal outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Corduneanu-Huci |first1= Cristina |first2= Alexander |last2=Hamilton |first3= Issel |last3=Masses Ferrer |year=2012 |title=Understanding Policy Change: How to Apply Political Economy Concepts in Practice |publisher= The World Bank |location= Washington DC. |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Understanding_Policy_Change.html?id=oKShuAAACAAJ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core branches==
In academia, the field of public administration consists of a number of sub-fields. Scholars have proposed a number of different sets of sub-fields. One of the proposed models uses five "pillars":&lt;ref name="Shafritz"/&gt;

*[[Organization theory|Organizational theory in public administration]] is the study of the structure of governmental entities and the many particulars inculcated in them.
*[[Public sector ethics|Ethics in public administration]] serves as a normative approach to decision making.
*[[Policy analysis]] serves as an empirical approach to decision making.
*[[Public budgeting]] is the activity within a government that seeks to allocate scarce resources among unlimited demands.
*[[Human Resource Management in Public Administration|Human resource management]] is an in-house structure that ensures that public service staffing is done in an unbiased, ethical and values-based manner. The basic functions of the HR system are employee benefits, employee health care, compensation, and many more (e.g., [[human rights]], [[Americans with Disabilities Act]]). The executives managing the HR director and other key departmental personnel are also part of the public administration system.

==Decision-making models==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2010}}
Given the array of duties public administrators find themselves performing, the professional administrator might refer to a theoretical framework from which he or she might work.  Indeed, many public and private administrative scholars have devised and modified decision-making models.

===Niskanen's budget-maximizing===
In 1971, Professor [[William Niskanen]] proposed a [[rational choice]] variation which he called the "[[budget-maximizing model]]". He claimed that rational bureaucrats will universally seek to increase the budgets of their units (to enhance their stature), thereby contributing to state growth and increased public expenditure. Niskanen served on President Reagan's Council of Economic Advisors; his model underpinned what has been touted as curtailed public spending and increased privatization. However, budgeted expenditures and the growing deficit during the Reagan administration is evidence of a different reality.  A range of pluralist authors have critiqued Niskanen's universalist approach.  These scholars have argued that officials tend also to be motivated by considerations of the public interest.

===Dunleavy's bureau-shaping===
The [[bureau-shaping]] model, a modification of Niskanen, holds that rational bureaucrats only maximize the part of their budget that they spend on their own agency's operations or give to contractors and interest groups.  Groups that are able to organize a "flowback" of benefits to senior officials would, according to this theory, receive increased budgetary attention. For instance, rational officials will get no benefit from paying out larger welfare checks to millions of low-income citizens because this does not serve a bureaucrats' goals. Accordingly, one might instead expect a jurisdiction to seek budget increases for defense and security purposes in place programming. If we refer back to Reagan once again, Dunleavy's bureau shaping model accounts for the alleged decrease in the "size" of government while spending did not, in fact, decrease. Domestic entitlement programming was financially deemphasized for military research and personnel.

==Academic field==
{{See also|Master of Public Administration|Doctor of Public Administration}}
University programs preparing students for careers in public administration typically offer the Master of Public Administration (MPA) degree, although in some universities, an [[Master of Arts|MA]] in Public Administration is awarded. In the [[United States]], the academic field of public administration draws heavily on [[political science]] and [[administrative law]]. Some MPA programs include economics courses to give students a background in microeconomic issues (markets, rationing mechanisms, etc.) and macroeconomic issues (e.g., national debt). Scholars such as [[John A. Rohr]] write of a long history behind the constitutional [[Legitimacy (political science)|legitimacy]] of government [[bureaucracy]]. In Europe (notably in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Germany]]), the divergence of the field from other disciplines can be traced to the 1720s [[Continental Europe|continental]] university curriculum. Formally, official academic distinctions were made in the 1910s and 1890s, respectively.

The goals of the field of public administration are related to the [[Democracy|democratic]] values of improving [[Egalitarianism|equality]], [[justice]], security, efficiency and effectiveness of public services in a non-profit venue; [[business administration]], on the other hand, is primarily concerned with expanding market share, generating revenue and earning [[Profit (accounting)|profit]]. For a field built on concepts ([[accountability]], [[governance]], [[decentralization]] and [[clientele]]), these concepts are often ill-defined and typologies often ignore certain aspects of these concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dubois |first1=Hans F. W. |last2=Fattore |first2=Giovanni |title= International Journal of Public Administration |url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a913084156 |pages=704–27 |year=2009 |volume=32 |publisher=Routledge Taylor &amp; Francis Group |doi=10.1080/01900690902908760 |quote=The field of public administration knows many concepts. By focusing on one such concept, this research shows how definitions can be deceptive... | issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The more specific term "[[public management]]" refers to ordinary, routine or typical management that aims to achieve [[public good]]. In some definitions, "public management" refers to private sector, market-driven perspective on the operation of government. This typically involves putting senior executives on performance contracts, rather than [[tenure]]d positions, instituting pay-for-performance systems for executives, creating revenue-generating agencies and so on.  This latter view is often called "[[New Public Management|new public management]]" (NPM) by its advocates.  New Public Management represents a reform attempt that emphasizes the professional nature of public administration{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}. NPM advocates aim to replace the academic, moral or disciplinary emphasis of traditional public administration with a professional focus. Some theorists advocate a "bright line" differentiation of the professional field from related academic disciplines like political science and sociology; it remains interdisciplinary in nature.

One public administration scholar, Donald Kettl, argues that "public administration sits in a disciplinary backwater", because "for the last generation, scholars have sought to save or replace it with fields of study like implementation, public management, and formal bureaucratic theory".&lt;ref name="h-net" /&gt; Kettl states that "public administration, as a subfield within [[political science]]...is struggling to define its role within the discipline".&lt;ref name="h-net" /&gt; He notes two problems with public administration: it "has seemed methodologically to lag behind" and "the field's theoretical work too often seems not to define it"-indeed, "some of the most interesting recent ideas in public administration have come from outside the field".&lt;ref name="h-net" /&gt;

[[Public administration theory]] is the domain in which discussions of the meaning and purpose of government, the role of bureaucracy in supporting democratic governments, budgets, governance, and public affairs takes place.  In recent years, public administration theory has periodically connoted a heavy orientation toward critical theory and [[postmodern]] philosophical notions of government, governance, and power.  However, many public administration scholars support a classic definition of the term emphasizing constitutionality, public service, bureaucratic forms of organization, and hierarchical government.

===Comparative public administration===
Comparative public administration or CPA is defined as the study of administrative systems in a comparative fashion or the study of public administration in other countries. There have been several issues which have hampered the development of comparative public administration, including: the major differences between Western countries and developing countries; the lack of curriculum on this sub-field in public administration programs; and the lack of success in developing theoretical models which can be scientifically tested. Even though CPA is a weakly formed field as a whole, this sub-field of public administration is an attempt at cross-cultural analysis, a "quest for patterns and regularities of administrative action and behavior."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jreisat|first=Jamil E.|date=2005-03-01|title=Comparative Public Administration Is Back In, Prudently|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6210.2005.00447.x/abstract|journal=Public Administration Review|language=en|volume=65|issue=2|pages=231–42|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6210.2005.00447.x|issn=1540-6210}}&lt;/ref&gt; CPA is an integral part to the analysis of public administration techniques. The process of comparison allows for more widely applicable policies to be tested in a variety of situations.

Comparative public administration emerged during the post-World War II period in order to seek international developmental strategies which aided in the [[containment]] of [[communism]] during the [[Cold War]]. (Riggs 1954, Heady 1960)&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;utminers.utep.edu/spena2/PAD5355/WHAT%20IS%20CPA.ppt&lt;/ref&gt; The developers of this field expanded on a general theory, a research agenda, and generalized "lessons learned". (Riggs 1954, Heady 1960) A prominent figure of Public Administration, Woodrow Wilson, commented on the study by saying, "Like principles of civil liberty are everywhere fostering like methods of government; and if comparative studies of the ways and means of government should enable us to offer suggestions which will practicably combine openness and vigor in the administration of such governments with ready docility to all serious, well-sustained public criticism, they will have approved themselves worthy to be ranked among the highest and most fruitful of the great departments of political study".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heritage.org/initiatives/first-principles/primary-sources/woodrow-wilson-on-administration |title=American Founders &amp;#124; The Heritage Foundation |publisher=Heritage.org |date=2013-07-08 |accessdate=2017-04-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170112020613/http://www.heritage.org/initiatives/first-principles/primary-sources/woodrow-wilson-on-administration |archive-date=2017-01-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the financial state of the powering countries began to stabilize toward the decline of the Cold War, the field of CPA began to diminish.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The resulting decline caused the lack of further expansion of this study making it irrelevant.

Comparative public administration lacks curriculum, which has prevented it from becoming a major field of study. This lack of understanding of the basic concepts that build this field's foundation has ultimately led to its lack of use. For example, William Waugh, a professor at Georgia State University has stated "Comparative studies are difficult because of the necessity to provide enough information on the sociopolitical context of national administrative structures and processes for readers to understand why there are differences and similarities."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/194699522?accountid=5683|title=Off Campus Database Authentication|website=search.proquest.com|access-date=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also asserts, "Although there is sizable literature on comparative public administration it is scattered and dated."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Waugh argues that public administration requires an understanding of different administrative structures and a comparison of different public administration models. The literature to build this base of knowledge is scattered and often hard to obtain. The lack or ill-formed use of comparative public administration has been detrimental for many countries, including the United States. Fred Riggs a political scientist, states that "comparisons to the United States also can be problematic, because of the tendency of many American scholars to presume the American organizational structures and processes are models for other nations to emulate, which was a failing of early developmental administrative studies."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In this, he claims the misuse and misapplication of comparative public administration has led to it being underdeveloped.

The development and better use comparative public administration could lead to better understanding. In 2002, the National Security Strategy was used in the battle of hearts and minds.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/209950790?accountid=5683|title=Off Campus Database Authentication|website=search.proquest.com|access-date=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; They tried to assimilate with an Arab and Islamic audience to push American values and democracy in an attempt to stop terrorism, when in fact the lack of comparison on the public level was ineffective and backfired.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The lack of willingness to understand their culture led to more tension in the Middle East.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In conclusion of these events there are not enough resources directed to the study of comparative public administration. For a basic understanding of sociopolitical structure of a society or culture is a key component of comparative public administration.

Despite all of its set backs there are examples of the application of well-formed Comparative Public Administration working in the world today. One of which is the comparison on the national level David Clark an author in this field states "In spite of similarities in public management reform rhetoric, it is argued that there is increasing divergence in the philosophy &amp; practice of public service in the two nations, &amp; and these differences reflect regimes that incorporate different ideals of citizenship."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/218320986?accountid=5683|title=Off Campus Database Authentication|website=search.proquest.com|access-date=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This highlights the benefit of proper comparison of public administration. By examining patterns that emerge in international public sectors one can identify similarities and differences in many things including ideals of citizenship on the local level. Although the United States failed use of Comparative Public Administration in the Middle East is noted, they did properly incorporate it domestically. "During the Clinton administration, the focus on residential energy consumption in the United States was elevated to a high level with the inauguration of the Million Solar Roofs initiative, in which the Department of Energy (DOE) sponsored workshops, developed a pool of existing federal lending and financing options, and worked with partners in the solar and building industries to remove market barriers to strengthen grassroots demand for solar technologies".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/224021643?accountid=5683|title=Off Campus Database Authentication|website=search.proquest.com|access-date=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This grassroots demand may have come from the comparative knowledge that concluded "In the United States, residential and commercial buildings combined now use 71% of all electricity produced and account for 79% of all electricity expenditures. Annual CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission attributed to electricity consumption in these U.S. buildings constitute 43% of the country's annual total CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission, which is approximately equivalent to the total CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission of Japan, France, and the United Kingdom combined. These levels support the claim of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] that energy use in buildings offer more potential for reducing carbon emission than any other single sector in the United States and abroad.".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This example compares CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission in the United States to other countries and through the buildings sector; the US could cut down on CO2 emission. The field of comparative public administration is often misunderstood for the definition itself is complex and requires layers of understanding. The field will require many more years of collaborative research before it becomes a widely recognized academic study.

===Master's degrees===
[[File:School of Government.JPG|thumb|The Knapp-Sanders Building, the home of the School of Government at the [[University of North Carolina]].]]

Some public administration programs have similarities to [[business administration]] programs, in cases where the students from both the Master's in Public Administration (MPA) and Master's in Business Administration (MBA) programs take many of the same courses.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} In some programs, the MPA (or MAPA) is more clearly distinct from the MBA, in that the MPA often emphasizes substantially different ethical and sociological criteria that pertain to administering government programs for the public good that have not been key criteria for business managers, who typically aim to maximize [[Profit (economics)|profit]] or [[share price]].

The MPA is related to similar graduate-level government studies programs including [[Master of Arts]] (MA) programs in public affairs, [[public policy]], and [[political science]].  MPA degrees may be more likely to include program emphases on [[policy analysis]] techniques or other topical focuses such as the study of [[International relations|international affairs]] as opposed to MA degrees, which tend to focus on [[constitutional law|constitutional issues]] such as [[separation of powers]], [[administrative law]], contracting with government, problems of [[governance]] and power, and [[participatory democracy]]. Some MPA degrees may be more oriented towards training students to undertake public service work tasks, whereas some MA programs may have a more academic, theoretical focus. Some universities offer their Masters in public administration as an MA degree (e.g., [[Carleton University]] in Ottawa, Canada and the University of Kerala in India).

Some universities offer mid-career Master's programs, sometimes called an MC/MPA, that can be taken part-time (often outside of business hours) by public servants and public service managers who are working full-time. Community programs may offer internships or continuing education credits. One example is the Maxwell School's mid-career Masters at [[Syracuse University]], which was launched by Robert Iversen in the 1970s.

===Doctoral degrees===
There are two types of doctoral degrees in public administration: the Doctor of Public Administration (DPA) and the [[Ph.D.]] in public administration. The DPA is an applied-research doctoral degree in the field of public administration, focusing on the practice of public administration more than on its theoretical aspects. The DPA requires coursework beyond the Masters level and a thesis, dissertation or other doctoral project. Upon successful completion of the doctoral requirements, the title of "Doctor" is awarded and the post-nominals of D.P.A. can be used. Some universities use the Ph.D. as their doctoral degree in public administration (e.g., [[Carleton University]] in Ottawa, Canada, and the [[University Of Kerala]] in India). The Ph.D. is typically sought by individuals aiming to become [[professor]]s of public administration or researchers. Individuals pursuing a Ph.D. in public administration often pursue more theoretical dissertation topics than their DPA counterparts.

===Notable scholars===
{{main article|List of notable public administration scholars}}
Notable scholars of public administration have come from a range of fields. In the period before public administration existed as its own independent discipline, scholars contributing to the field came from economics, sociology, management, political science, administrative law, and, other related fields. More recently, scholars from public administration and public policy have contributed important studies and theories.

==International organizations==
There are a number of international public administration organizations. The Commonwealth Association of Public Administration and Management (CAPAM) is diverse, as it includes the 54 member states of the Commonwealth from India and the UK to Nauru. Its biennial conference brings together ministers of public service, top public officials and leading scholars. The oldest organization is the [[International Institute of Administrative Sciences]] (IIAS). Based in Brussels, Belgium, the IIAS is a worldwide platform providing a space for exchanges that promote knowledge and good practices to improve the organization and operation of public administration. The IIAS also aims to ensure that public agencies will be in a position to better respond to the current and future expectations and needs of society. The IIAS has set up four entities: the International Association of Schools and Institutes of Administration (IASIA), the European Group for Public Administration (EGPA), The Latin American Group for Public Administration (LAGPA) and the Asian Group for Public Administration (AGPA). IASIA is an association of organizations and individuals whose activities and interests focus on public administration and management. The activities of its members include education and training of administrators and managers. It is the only worldwide scholarly association in the field of public management. EGPA, LAGPA and AGPA are the regional sub-entities of the IIAS. Another body, the International Committee of the US-based [[Network of Schools of Public Policy, Affairs, and Administration]] (NASPAA), has developed a number of relationships around the world.  They include sub regional and National forums like CLAD, INPAE and NISPAcee, APSA, ASPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.GlobalMPA.net |title=NASPAA International Web Portal |publisher=Globalmpa.net |date= |accessdate=2014-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517102057/http://globalmpa.net/ |archivedate=2014-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center for Latin American Administration for Development (CLAD), based in [[Caracas, Venezuela]], this regional network of schools of public administration set up by the governments in Latin America is the oldest in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clad.org.ve |title=CLAD |publisher=CLAD |date=2007-08-29 |accessdate=2017-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute is a founding member and played a central role in organizing the Inter-American Network of Public Administration Education (INPAE). Created in 2000, this regional network of schools is unique in that it is the only organization to be composed of institutions from North and Latin America and the Caribbean working in public administration and policy analysis. It has more than 49 members from top research schools in various countries throughout the hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebape.fgv.br/inpae] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150525004501/http://www.ebape.fgv.br/inpae|date=May 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NISPAcee is a network of experts, scholars and practitioners who work in the field of public administration in central Europe and Eastern Europe, including the Russian Federation and the Caucasus and Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Floyd |last=Studio |first2= Ján |last2=Andruch |url=http://www.nispa.sk/_portal/homepage.php|title=Homepage - NISPAcee Information Portal|work=nispa.sk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US public administration and political science associations like NASPAA, American Political Science Association (APSA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apsanet.org |title=APSA - American Political Science Association |publisher=Apsanet.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and American Society of Public Administration (ASPA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aspanet.org aspanet.org]&lt;/ref&gt; These organizations have helped to create the fundamental establishment of modern public administration.

[[Eastern Regional Organization for Public Administration]] (EROPA) is a state-membership based organization, open to other organizations and individuals, headquartered in [[The Philippines]] with centres and membership organized around the [[Asia Pacific]] region. EROPA organizes annual conferences, and publishes a journal ''Asian Review of Public Administration'' (ARPA). It has a number of centres in the region, and assists in networking experts with its members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eastern Regional Organization for Public Administration|url=http://www.eropa.org.ph|website=Eastern Regional Organization for Public Administration|accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public management==

"Public management" is an approach to government administration and non-profit administration that resembles or draws on private-sector [[management]] and [[business]] techniques and approaches. These business approaches often aim to maximize [[wikt:efficiency|efficiency]] and [[effectiveness]] and provide improved [[customer service]].  A contrast is drawn with the study of public administration, which emphasizes the social and cultural drivers of government that many contend (e.g., [[Graham T. Allison]] and [[Charles Goodsell]]) makes it different from the private sector.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Studying and teaching about public management are widely practiced in [[developed nation]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11982">'''Regulatory science''' is the scientific and technical foundations upon which regulations are based in various industries – particularly those involving health or safety.  Regulatory bodies employing such principles in the US include for example the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] for food and medical products, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] for the environment, and [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] for work safety.

"Regulatory science" is contrasted with [[regulatory affairs]] and [[regulatory law]], which refer to the administrative or legal aspects of regulation, in that the former is focused on the regulations' ''scientific'' underpinnings and concerns – rather than the regulations' promulgation, implementation, compliance, or enforcement.{{fact|date=October 2016}}

==History==
Probably the first investigator who recognized the nature of regulatory science was Alvin Weinberg &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weinberg|first1=AM|title=Science and trans science|journal=Minerva|date=1970|volume=10|pages=209–222|doi=10.1007/BF01682418}}&lt;/ref&gt; who described the scientific process used to evaluate effects of ionizing radiation as trans science.  The origin of the term '''regulatory science''' is unknown. It was probably coined sometimes in the late 1970s in an undated memorandum prepared by [[A. Alan Moghissi]] who was describing scientific issues that the newly formed US [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) was facing. During that period the EPA was forced to meet legally mandated deadlines to make decisions that would require reliance upon science that was not meeting conventional scientific requirements. At that time the prevailing view was that there was no need to establish a new [[scientific discipline]] because “science is science” regardless of how its application. In the spring of 1985 Moghissi established the Institute for Regulatory Science in the [[Commonwealth of Virginia]] as a non-profit organization with the objective to perform scientific studies “at the interface between science and the regulatory system”  Moghissi et al.&lt;ref name=j1/&gt; have provided an extensive description of history of regulatory science including various perception of regulatory science leading to the acceptance of regulatory science by the FDA

==Definition==
Moghissi ''et al''.&lt;ref name=j1/&gt; have described the history of regulatory science and provide two definitions. The first definition is the generalized definition provided by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) “Regulatory science is a scientific discipline consisting of the development and application of scientific methods, tools, approaches, and other relevant processes derived from various scientific disciplines used to support regulatory and other policy objectives”. An abbreviated definition consists of “regulatory science consists of the application of science to support policy notably regulatory objectives”

The objectives, stated by the FDA in 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/downloads/scienceresearch/specialtopics/regulatoryscience/ucm228444.pdf|title=Advancing Regulatory Science for Public Health|last=|first=FDA|date=2010|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; will provide a basis to: 

* Improve capacity for safety and efficacy evaluations and monitoring of candidate and licensed products,
* Modernize current regulatory pathways,
* Develop new regulatory pathways where there are currently none.

There have been several attempts to define regulatory science. In many cases there are claims that there is a difference between regulatory science and “normal science”, “academic science”, “research science”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jasanoff|first1=S|title=The fifth branch: science advisors as policy makers|date=1990|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt; or compliance with regulations &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gad|first1=SC|title=Regulatory Toxicology|date=2001|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|location=Philadelphia, PA|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The primary problem is the lack of appreciation that many branches of science are evolving and much of the evolving science includes inherent uncertainties.

==Application of regulatory science==
Regulatory science is included in every regulation that includes science. The regulatory science community&lt;ref name="j1"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Straja|first2=Sorin R.|last3=Love|first3=Betty R.|last4=McBride|first4=Dennis K.|last5=Stough|first5=Roger R.|date=2014|title=Innovation in Regulatory Science: Evolution of a new scientific discipline|journal=Technology and Innovation|volume=16|issue=2|pages=155–165|doi=10.3727/194982414X14096821477027|last1=Moghissi|first1=AA}}&lt;/ref&gt; consists of three groups of regulatory scientists: 
*Those who are involved in development of regulations. Typically this group is employed by regulatory agencies 
*Those who must comply with regulations. Typically this group consists of employees or contractors of regulated community.
*Those segments of the scientific community who perform research and development in areas relevant to the relevant regulated community.

The third group is of particular significance as they consist of organizations and individuals who support the first two groups. Included in this group are members of numerous advisory panels, organizations that provide peer reviews, and members of peer review panels. An example of this group is the National Academies consisting of the National Academy of Science, National Academy of Engineering, Institute of Medicine, and National Research Council.   
The application of regulatory science occurs in three phases. During the first phase the regulators must meet a legislative or court- mandated deadline and promulgate regulations using their best judgment. The second phase provides opportunity to develop regulatory science tools. These include human health and ecological risk assessment procedures and post marketing evaluation method d processes for drugs ad medical devices. The third Standard Operating phase, used tools developed during the second phase to improve the initial decision. ( Moghissi et al.)

==Regulatory engineering==
[[Engineering]] is the development of new products and processes, hence regulatory engineering encompasses principally the development of products and processes to facilitate or better examine regulations or their scientific foundations.  Another related segment of regulatory science deal with the application of engineering design or analysis to operations such as the safety of nuclear and other power plants, chemical production facilities, mining operations, and air transportation.

Sometimes the term "regulatory engineer(ing)" is misused to refer to essentially administrative or regulatory roles dealing with organizing or coordinating regulatory matters for an organization; however, "engineering" refers only to functional design of products and processes, and in many jurisdictions this definition is legally enforced (see [[Regulation and licensure in engineering]]).

==Areas of focus==

===Regulatory pharmaceutical medicine===
Consistent with its mission, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) suggests that “Regulatory science is the science of developing new tools, standards and approaches to assess the safety, efficacy, quality and performance of FDA-regulated products.”
Based on several decades of experience regulatory science is logically defined as a distinct scientific discipline constituting the scientific foundation of regulatory, legislative, and judicial decisions. Much like many scientific disciplines that have evolved within the last several decades, regulatory science is both [[interdisciplinary]] and [[multidisciplinary]] and relies upon a large number of basic and applied scientific disciplines.

Regulatory science is an emerging area of interest within pharmaceutical medicine as the shaping and implementation of legislation and guidelines. One definition of “regulatory science” is the science of developing new tools, standards and approaches to evaluate the efficacy, safety, quality and performance of medical products in order to assess benefit-risk and facilitate a sound and transparent regulatory decision-making. It has been recognized as having a significant impact on the industry’s ability to bring new medicines and medical devices to patients in need. Regulatory science challenges current concepts of benefit/risk assessment, submission and approval strategies, patient’s involvement and ethical aspects. It creates the platform for launching new ideas – not only by the pharmaceutical industry and regulatory authorities, but also by, for example, academia, who wants to contribute to better use of their research activities within medical aspects. Regulatory science &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=FDA (Food and Drug Administration)|title=The Promise of regulatory science|url=http://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/RegulatoryScience/ucm228206.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; has the potential as an enabler for directing companies towards more efficient global development of medical products as well as more robust quality decision-making processes.

===Human health===
By far the predominant foci of Regulatory Science pertain to human health and well-being. This realm covers a broad range of scientific areas – including pollution and [[toxicology]], work safety, food, drugs, and numerous others.

===Ecology===
Regulatory [[ecology]] covers resources the [[Protected species|protection of various species]], [[Wetland conservation|protection of wetlands]], and numerous other regulated areas including [[ecotoxicology]].

For example, the US Clean Water Act is based upon an interest in protecting water quality for its own sake, in contrast with the Clean Air Act which is premised upon protecting air quality only for the sake of human health; however, these are ideological policy premises rather than scientific matters themselves.

The US Department of Agriculture regulates animal care, and the FDA regulates humaneness for animal studies.

The US Department of Interior, [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|Fish and Wildlife Service]] (USFWS), and [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration]], [[National Marine Fisheries Service]], implement the development and enforcement of policies required by the [[Endangered Species Act|Federal Endangered Species Act]] (FESA), [[Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918|Migratory Bird Treaty Act]], and other biological resources laws. The FESA requires that the decisions to list a species as endangered or threatened are based on the best available scientific data. To that end, the USFWS, and other government agencies fund research to determine the conservation status of proposed species. Regulatory scientists within the Services review, evaluate, and incorporate data from these studies of proposed species in their published regulations. Survey protocols for listed species are also developed from scientific studies of their target species. The purpose of the protocols is to reliably and accurately determine the residency of the target species in a given study area.

==Regulatory economics==
There are numerous [[Regulatory economics|economic decisions]] in the regulatory process including the [[economics]] part of [[cost-benefit analysis]].

==Science in legislation and in courts==
Although often less than fully recognized the scientific foundation of [[Legislation|legislative]] decisions are included in regulatory science and should be based on reliable science. Similarly [[Court of law|courts]] have recognized the need to rely upon information that meets scientific requirements.

[[File:Dutch, 17th century, Black boy with slave collar, Private Collection.jpg|thumb|upright|Black boy with [[slavery|slave collar]], Dutch 17th-century painting.]]

'''Representations of slavery in European art''' date back to ancient times. They show slaves of varied ethnicity, white as well as black.

In Europe, slavery became increasingly associated with blackness from the 17th century onwards. However, slaves before this period were predominantly white. The ''black'' in European art is not the same topic as the ''slave'' in European art: slaves were not always black and blacks not always slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Also note the ambiguity of the term "Turkish slave": a Turkish slave may be a Turk or someone enslaved by a Turk. See [[Turkish Slave]] for yet another layer of confusion about a picture by [[Parmigianino]].&lt;/ref&gt; The article also concentrates on European art rather than Western art in general.

== Slaves in art ==
[[File:Retrato de Juan Pareja, by Diego Velázquez.jpg|thumbnail|upright|''[[Portrait of Juan de Pareja]]'', by Velázquez]]
[[File:Alexandre Dumas (1762-1806).JPG|thumbnail|upright|Thomas Alexandre Dumas]]

From the Renaissance onwards, a substantial number of bound figures, often naked and crouching, illustrate enslavement.&lt;ref&gt;''The Slave in European Art: From Renaissance Trophy to Abolitionist Emblem'', ed Elizabeth McGrath and Jean Michel Massing, London (The Warburg Institute) and Turin 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This imagery had for one of its roots the ancient tradition of [[Roman Triumph]], but its contemporaneous relevance was greatly magnified by the prevalence of slavery within European countries. In particular, [[galley slaves]] were often used by artists as models for muscular nude bodies.

Sometimes the name of an individual who was a slave is known. One instance is  [[Juan de Pareja]] (1606–1670) who was a slave of [[Velázquez]] and was trained as a painter by the artist. Velázquez freed Juan de Pareja in 1650 and the document of manumission survives.&lt;ref&gt;See Carmen Fracchia's article in The Slave in European Art: From Renaissance Trophy to Abolitionist Emblem, ed Elizabeth McGrath and Jean Michel Massing, London (The Warburg Institute) and Turin 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The document which was discovered by [[Jennifer Montagu]] is in the Archivio di Stato in Rome. See ''Burlington Magazine'', volume 125,1983,pages 683-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Juan de Pareja became a successful artist himself.

[[Alexandre Dumas]] of ''The Three Musketeers'' fame, was the son of a slave, [[Thomas-Alexandre Dumas|also known as Alexandre]], who rose to be a general in chief in the French army. His portrait hardly suggests his early life as a slave. He was pawned by his father who was a French nobleman but was lucky enough to be retrieved by the father and brought up in France.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Reiss, ''The Black Count: Glory, Revolution, Betrayal, and the Real Count of Monte Cristo'' (New York: Crown Publishers, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frans Post]] (1612—1680) and [[Albert Eckhout]] (c.1610–1665) were two early Dutch painters to depict slavery. Post painted pictures of slaves working in  idyllic rural landscapes which do little to reflect the harsh realities of their life.&lt;ref&gt;See Ernest van den Boogaart article in ''The Slave in European Art: From Renaissance Trophy to Abolitionist Emblem'', ed Elizabeth McGrath and Jean Michel Massing, London (The Warburg Institute) and Turin 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Eckhout's work is a visual record of the ethnic mix in Dutch Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;See Jean Michel Massing in Studies in ''Imagery II: the World Discovered''. London 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Rebecca Parker Brienen, ''Albert Eckhout'', 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconographic aspects of slavery==


The trade in black Africans was widespread in Europe long before the [[Triangular Trade]] involving Europe, Africa and the Americas. Numerous portraits of high-class Europeans show them in the company of black figures, often children, whose status may be advertised by the silver [[slavery|slave collar]] being worn. A silver collar is usually worn in conjunction with luxurious clothes and other finery, which allowed the artist to show off his repertoire and the owner of the slave to show off his or her wealth. In fact, in the 17th and 18th centuries, it was the fashion among some wealthy Europeans to have their black household slaves or servants wear silver collars; these were often inscribed with the name of the owner or employer. The slave collar is seen in contemporary paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Slave in European Art: From Renaissance Trophies to Abolitionist Emblem| editor1= McGrath, Elizabeth  | editor2= Massing, Jean Michel |location= London |publisher=The Warburg Institute|date= 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chains, fetters, manacles, slave collars are the familiar iconographic markers of slavery with the broken chain being particularly useful for ''dis''-enslavement.{{cn|date=May 2014}} 

Slaves were chattel and so it is no surprise to see that they were on occasion branded like cattle in life and in art. Another sign of slavery, less obvious and much less gruesome, was the cropped pony tail or topknot which marked an enslaved Turk in the galleys.&lt;ref&gt;See articles by Elizabeth McGrath and Rick Scorza in ''The Slave in European Art: From Renaissance Trophy to Abolitionist Emblem'', ed Elizabeth McGrath and Jean Michel Massing, London (The Warburg Institute) and Turin 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Often slaves were  prisoners captured in war and  there is an iconographical overlap between the two.  Michelangelo's [[Dying Slave]] was not given this title by him. He instead talked of such figures as prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Echinger-Maurach, ''Studien zu Michelangelos Juliusgrabmal'', 2 vols, Hildesheim,  1991.&lt;/ref&gt; The slave status of Caryatids is similarly open to interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Vitruvius ''De Architectura'' I.1.4-5.&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is not always clear from a picture that a slave or a servant or a free person has been represented. Thus, it is unknown if the portrait of Juan de Pareja were painted by Velázquez while the former was still a slave. In any case, the portrait is not an image of enslavement, even if Juan de Pareja were a slave at the time of painting.{{cn|date=May 2014}}

== Abolitionism ==

[[File:Wedgwood - Anti-Slavery Medallion - Walters 482597.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Anti-Slavery Medallion by Josiah Wedgwood]]

With [[Abolitionism]], the imagery of enslavement was turned to a social and political purpose. An instance of this is the medallion devised for the movement by [[Josiah Wedgwood]] which shows a  pleading grateful black slave. People wore the medallion as a token of their commitment to abolitionism.

An example of an anti-Abolitionist image is that by [[George Cruikshank]], ''New Union Club''. It satirises what supposedly took place at a celebrated dinner organised by Abolitionists.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6270">'''SIGCSE''' is the [[Association for Computing Machinery]]'s [[Special Interest Group]] on Computer Science Education, which provides a forum for educators to discuss issues related to the development, implementation, and/or evaluation of computing programs, curricula, and courses, as well as syllabi, laboratories, and other elements of teaching and pedagogy.  It is also the name of one of the three annual events organized by SIGCSE. This event, the ACM [[SIGCSE Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education]], is held annually in February or March in the USA. SIGCSE also sponsors an annual conference in or around Europe, named ITiCSE (Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education), usually in late June, and an annual research workshop named ICER (International Computing Education Research), at varied locations, usually in August.

The main focus of SIGCSE is higher education, and discussions include improving computer science education at high school level and below. The membership level has held steady at around 3300 members for several years. The current chair of SIGCSE is
[[Amber Settle]] for July 1, 2016 to June 30, 2019.

==Conferences==

SIGCSE has three annual conferences.

* The Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education conference is held in the United States with an average annual attendance of approximately 1300. The next conference will be held February 27 through March 2, 2019 in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sigcse2019.sigcse.org/|title=SIGCSE 2019|website=sigcse2019.sigcse.org|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The annual conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education (ITiCSE). The next one will be held Monday 2 July through Wednesday 4 July 2018 in [[Larnaca, Cyprus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://iticse.acm.org/|title=ITiCSE 2018|website=iticse.acm.org|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This conference is attended by about 200-300 and is mainly held in Europe, but has also been held in countries outside of Europe ([[Turkey]] - 2010), ([[Israel]] - 2012), and ([[Peru]] - 2016).
* The International Computing Education Research (ICER) Conference. This conference has about 70 attendees and is held in the United States every other year. On the alternate years it rotates between [[Europe]] and [[Australasia]].  The next conference will be held August 13 through August 15, 2018 in [[Espoo, Finland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://icer.acm.org/|title=ICER Conference {{!}} International Computing Education Research|website=icer.acm.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Newsletter/Bulletin==
The SIGCSE Bulletin is a quarterly newsletter that was first published in 1969. It evolved from an informal gathering of news and ideas to a venue for columns, editor-reviewed articles, research announcements, editorials, symposium proceedings, etc.

In 2010, with the inception of ACM Inroads magazine, the Bulletin was transformed into an electronic newsletter sent to all SIGCSE members providing communications about SIGCSE: announcing activities, publicizing events, and highlighting topics of interest. In other words, it has returned to its roots.

The '''Sea Around Us''' is an international research initiative and a member of the Global Fisheries Cluster at the [[University of British Columbia]]. The Sea Around Us assesses the impact of fisheries on the marine ecosystems of the world and offers mitigating solutions to a range of stakeholders. To achieve this, the Sea Around Us presents fisheries and fisheries-related data at spatial scales that have ecological and policy relevance, such as by Exclusive Economic Zones, High Seas areas, or Large Marine Ecosystems.

All spatialized data are visualized either graphically or mapped, and all data can be downloaded. Global fisheries catches from 1950 to the present are available, under explicit consideration of coral reefs, seamounts, estuaries and other critical habitats of fish and marine invertebrates. The data presented, which are all freely available, are meant to support studies of global fisheries trends and the development of sustainable, ecosystem-based fisheries policies.

In the early 2000s, members of the Sea Around Us uncovered that [[China]] was overestimating its catches and showed that, when such distortions were removed from overall fisheries catches, global fisheries were actually declining since the late 1980s.  The Sea Around Us also showed that the biomass of large fish in the [[North Atlantic]] is one-tenth of what it was only a century ago. [[Aquaculture]], according to another study with members from the Project, cannot be expected to compensate for overfishing but is instead likely to exacerbate the problem due to the reliance on wild fish for fishmeal. In other words, without serious long-term planning, the oceans might get a lot worse before they get better.

In 2016, members of the Sea Around Us, using reconstructed global catch data that combine officially reported landings data with comprehensive estimates of unreported landings and discards, documented that, from 1950-2010, global catches were around 50% higher than reported data suggest. Furthermore, total catches seem to be declining faster from their peak catch in the mid-1990s than reported data would suggest.

The good news is that the discrepancy between reported data and estimated total catches is decreasing in more recent years, meaning that the comprehensiveness of data reported by countries seems to be improving.

All this information was compiled in the [http://www.seaaroundus.org/sea-around-us-new-atlas-reveals-why-the-ocean-is-giving-us-1-2-million-mt-less-of-fish-every-year/ Global Atlas of Marine Fisheries], a 520-page book published in October 2016 by [https://islandpress.org/book/global-atlas-of-marine-fisheries Island Press].

The Sea Around Us also communicates to broad audiences to convey the urgency to:

* Reduce excess fishing capacity (much of which is being ‘exported’ to developing countries).
* Eliminate damaging subsidies and create extensive networks of marine protected areas.
* Reconsider the current model of carnivorous aquaculture.
* Refocus fisheries to the small-scale sectors that are crucial to national food security concerns in developing countries.

The Sea Around Us was initiated in collaboration with [[The Pew Charitable Trusts]] in 1999, and in 2014, Sea Around Us began a collaboration with [[Paul G. Allen Family Foundation|The Paul G. Allen Family Foundation]] and its executive arm, Vulcan Inc., to provide African and Asian countries with more accurate and comprehensive fisheries data, and to redesign and revamp the Sea Around Us website.

'''Sexual stimulation''' is any [[stimulation|stimulus]] (including bodily contact) that leads to, enhances and maintains [[sexual arousal]], and may lead to [[orgasm]]. Although sexual arousal may arise without [[physical stimulation]], achieving orgasm usually requires physical sexual stimulation.

The term ''sexual stimulation'' often implies stimulation of the [[sex organ|genitals]], but may also include stimulation of other areas of the body, stimulation of the senses (such as sight or hearing) and mental stimulation (i.e. from reading or [[sexual fantasy|fantasizing]]). Sufficient stimulation of the [[human penis|penis]] in males and the [[clitoris]] in females usually results in an orgasm.&lt;ref name="Weiten"&gt;{{cite book|first=Wayne |last=Weiten |first2=Dana S.|last2=Dunn |first3=Elizabeth Yost |display-authors=2 |last3=Hammer|title=Psychology Applied to Modern Life: Adjustment in the 21st century|page=386|isbn =1-111-18663-4|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|year=2011 |accessdate=5 January 2012|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CGu96TeAZo0C&amp;pg=PT423&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clitoris"&gt;{{cite web|title='I Want a Better Orgasm!'|publisher=[[WebMD]]|accessdate=August 18, 2011|url=http://www.webmd.com/sex/want-better-orgasms|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113132443/http://www.webmd.com/sex/want-better-orgasms|archivedate=2009-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kenneth Mah"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Kenneth | last = Mah | first2 = Yitzchak M | last2 = Binik | title = The nature of human orgasm: a critical review of major trends | journal = [[Clinical Psychology Review]] | volume = 21 | issue = 6 | pages = 823–856| date = January 7, 2001 | pmid = 11497209| doi = 10.1016/S0272-7358(00)00069-6 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272735800000696 | quote=Women rated clitoral stimulation as at least somewhat more important than vaginal stimulation in achieving orgasm; only about 20% indicated that they did not require additional clitoral stimulation during intercourse.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kammerer-Doak"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Dorothy | last = Kammerer-Doak | first2 = Rebecca G. | last2 = Rogers | title =  Female Sexual Function and Dysfunction | journal = Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America | volume = 35 | issue = 2 | pages = 169–183 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 18486835 | doi = 10.1016/j.ogc.2008.03.006 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889854508000235 | quote=Most women report the inability to achieve orgasm with vaginal intercourse and require direct clitoral stimulation ...

Some people practice [[Edging (sexual practice)|orgasm control]], whereby a person or their sexual partner controls the level of sexual stimulation to delay orgasm, and to prolong the sexual experience leading up to orgasm.

==Physical sexual stimulation==
[[File:Primary and specific erogenous zones.svg|thumb|The erogenous zones of the male and female body.]]

===Genital===
Physical sexual stimulation usually consists of touching the genitals or other [[erogenous zone]]s. [[Masturbation]], [[erotic massage]], sexual intercourse, a [[handjob]] or [[Fingering (sexual act)|fingering]] are types of physical sexual stimulation involving the genitals. [[Sexual arousal]] is usually triggered through sensitive nerves in these body parts,&lt;ref&gt;Schober, Justine M., and Donald Pfaff. "[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Justine_Schober/publication/5968480_The_neurophysiology_of_sexual_arousal/links/545cf0c90cf2c1a63bfa5af6.pdf The neurophysiology of sexual arousal.]" Best practice &amp; research Clinical endocrinology &amp; metabolism 21.3 (2007): 445-461.&lt;/ref&gt; which cause the release of pleasure-causing  chemicals ([[endorphins]]) that act as mental rewards to pursue such stimulation. A person may also become sexually aroused by touching another person's genitals or other body parts.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} The [[bulbocavernosus reflex]] is triggered by stimulation of the glans penis or clitoris.&lt;ref name=Wheeless&gt;http://www.wheelessonline.com/ortho/bulbocavernosus_reflex Bulbocavernosus Reflex&amp;nbsp;– Wheeless' Textbook of Orthopaedics&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of [[sex toy]]s is to provide pleasure and stimulation through an alternative route than just using people's bodies. They can be used by someone on their own, with partnered sex, or group sex. They can be exciting and provide new types of stimulation that the body cannot produce, such as vibrations.

Sex toys have been used as a source of sexual stimulation for thousands of years. There have been [[dildo]]s found from the [[Paleolithic|Palaeolithic era]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4713323.stm|title=Ancient Phallus Unearthed in Cave.|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; made of [[Siltstone]] and polished to a high gloss. Dildos were also made of camel dung and coated with resin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Book of Kink: Sex Beyond the Missionary|last=Christina, E.|first=|publisher=Tarcher Perigree|year=2011|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SFcWmcGLXJ4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians are uncertain whether these have been used for [[religious ritual]]s or for personal pleasure. It is known that dildos were used for [[fertility ritual]]s,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alternet.org/sex-amp-relationships/sex-toy|title=The long, strange history of sex toys.|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; however. The [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] created their dildos from a carved penis covered in leather or animal intestines to create a more natural feel.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Romans created double-ended dildos for use with a partner. Ancient Chinese dildos were made of [[bronze]] or other metals and some were hollow allowing them to be filled with liquid to simulate an [[ejaculation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=With the hand: a cultural history of masturbation|last=Driel, M.|first=|publisher=Reaktion Books.|year=2012|isbn=|location=London|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were used because wealthy Chinese men would often have too many wives to please. In Persia, they thought that the blood of the [[hymen]] was unclean, and should be avoided by husbands. On the night before a lady's wedding, a local holy-man would come and break her hymen with a large stone dildo, a ritual also used to confirm the virginity of the bride.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Marriage customs of the world: from henna to honeymoons|last=Monger, G.|first=|publisher=ABC-Clio|year=2004|isbn=|location=California|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-genital stimulation  ===
There are many areas through which a person can be sexually stimulated, other than the genitals. To name a few, the nipples, thighs, lips, and neck can all provide sexual stimulation when touched. 
[[File:Oral nipple stimulation small sharpened.png|thumb|Sexual stimulation of a nipple]]
[[Nipples]]: One study&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levin, R. &amp;|first=Meston, C.|year=2006|title=Nipple/breast stimulation and sexual arousal in young men and women.|url=http://www.jsm.jsexmed.org/article/S1743-6095(15)31341-2/fulltext|journal=The Journal of Sexual Medicine|volume=3|pages=450–454|via=|doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2006.00230.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; administered a questionnaire about sexual activity to 301 participants and found that 81.5% of women reported that stimulating their nipples caused or enhanced sexual arousal and that 59.1% of them asked to have their nipples stimulated during sex. Furthermore, 51.7% of men reported that nipple stimulation caused sexual arousal, and 39% said that it enhanced their existing arousal. Research  using &lt;ref name="Komisaruk"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Komisaruk |first1=B.

The research suggests the sensations are genital orgasms caused by [[nipple stimulation]], and may also be directly linked to "the genital area of the brain".&lt;ref name="Komisaruk" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levi |first=R, J. |year=2006|title=The breast/nipple/areola complex and human sexuality.|url=|journal=Sexual &amp; Relationship therapy|volume=21|pages=237–249|via=|doi=10.1080/14681990600674674}}&lt;/ref&gt; In women, one study indicated that sensation from the nipples travels to the same part of the brain as sensations from the vagina, clitoris and cervix. Nipple stimulation may trigger uterine contractions, which then produce a sensation in the genital area of the brain.&lt;ref name="Komisaruk" /&gt;

[[Thigh]]s: In 2012 the California Institute of Technology&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=V. |last1=Gazzola |first2=M.L. |last2=Spezio |first3=J.A. |last3=Etzel |first4=F. |last4=Castelli |first5=R. |last5=Adolphs |first6=C. |last6=Keysers|first=|year=2012|title=Primary somatosensory cortex discriminates affective significance in social touch.|url=|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=109|pages=1657–1666.|doi=10.1073/pnas.1113211109|pmc=3382530}}&lt;/ref&gt; measured brain responses in heterosexual males as they were having their inner thighs touched whilst being [[MRI Scanner|MRI scanned]]. They were either watching a video of a woman touching their thigh or a man touching their thigh. They reported more sexual pleasure when they thought it was the woman touching them than the man, and this was reflected in their MRI scans with greater arousal of their somatosensory cortex. It can be therefore concluded that the thighs are an area that can cause sexual stimulation when touched.

[[Lip]]s: Lips contain a huge number of [[nerve endings]] and are considered to be an erogenous zone. Men report experiencing more pleasure from the stimulation of their lips than women do (see below for sex differences in stimulation). In addition to stimulation of the lips by touching, men can be visually stimulated by looking at a woman's lips. It has also been&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Evolution of Human Sexuality.|last=Symons, D.|first=|publisher=Oxford university press.|year=1979|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported that men prefer women with fuller lips because they are an indicator of youth.

[[Neck]]:&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Turnbull |first1=O. H. |last2=Lovett |first2=V. E. |last3=Chaldecott |first3=J. |last4=Lucas |first4=M.

Females reported neck stimulation as being more arousing than men did, and the nape of the neck was more arousing for both sexes than the back of the neck.{{Contradict-inline|reason="nape is the back of the neck"|date=October 2017}}

=== Sex differences in erogenous zones ===
This table&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; shows the sex differences in erogenous zones and includes the top ten most arousing areas for both sexes. Each body part was rated out of ten for how arousing it is when touched. Apart from body parts exclusive to one gender such as the penis or clitoris, many of the erogenous zones are similar and contain lots of nerve endings. They suggested also that women experience more areas of greater arousal than men do.

=== Internal stimulation: excitation-transfer theory of sexual arousal ===
The [[excitation-transfer theory]] states that existing arousal in the body can be transformed into another type of arousal. For example, sometimes people can be sexually stimulated from residual arousal arising from something such as exercise, being transformed into another type of arousal such as sexual arousal. In one study&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Cantor |first1=J. R. |last2=Bryant |first2=J. |last3=Zillmann |first3=D. |year=1975|title=Enhancement of experienced sexual arousal in response to erotic stimuli through misattribution of unrelated residual excitation.|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Joanne_Cantor/publication/21948123_Enhancement_of_Experienced_Sexual_Arousal_in_Response_to_Erotic_Stimuli_Through_Misattribution_of_Unrelated_Residual_Excitation/links/5431cbe00cf277d58e982d6f.pdf|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=32|pages=69–75|via=|doi=10.1037/h0076784}}&lt;/ref&gt; participants performed some physical exercise and at different stages of recovery had to watch an erotic film and rate how aroused it made them feel. They found that participants who were still experiencing excitatory residues from the exercise rated the film as more arousing than those who had fully recovered from the exercise. This suggests that the remaining arousal from the exercise was being transformed into sexual arousal without any external stimulation.

== Alternative routes ==
The human sexual response is a dynamic combination of cognitive, emotional, and physiological processes. Whilst the most common forms of sexual stimulation discussed are [[Sexual fantasy|fantasy]] or physical stimulation of the genitals and other erogenous areas, sexual arousal may also be mediated through alternative routes such as visual, olfactory and auditory means.

=== Visual ===
Perhaps the most researched non-tactile form of sexual stimulation is visual sexual stimulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arnow | first1 = B. A. | last2 = Desmond | first2 = J.

Although seen socio-historically as an unacceptable form of '[[Paraphilia|sexual deviation]]', it highlights the human tendency to find sexual stimulation through purely visual routes. The multibillion-dollar industry that is [[pornography]] is yet another example. A common presumption in society and the media is that men respond more strongly to visual sexual stimuli than do women. This is perhaps best exemplified by the [[Alfred Kinsey|Kinsey]] hypothesis that men are more prone to sexual arousal from visual stimulation than women&lt;ref&gt;Kinsey, A. C., Pomeroy, W. B., Martin, C. E., &amp; Sloan, S. (1948). [[Sexual behavior in the human male]].&lt;/ref&gt; and, arguably, can be seen depicted through the "male glaze"&lt;ref&gt;Mulvey, L. (1989). [http://theslideprojector.com/pdffiles/art6/visualpleasureandnarrativecinema.pdf Visual pleasure and narrative cinema]. In ''Visual and other pleasures'' (pp. 14-26). Palgrave Macmillan UK.&lt;/ref&gt; that dominates the pornography industry. Nonetheless, both sexes can be sexually aroused through visual stimulation. In one study, visual stimulation was tested by means of an erotic video. Although significantly higher in the male group, sexual arousal was the main emotional reaction reported by both sexes. Their physiological responses to the video also showed characteristics of sexual arousal, such as increased urinary excretions of [[Epinephrine|adrenaline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Levi | first1 = L | year = 1969 | title = Sympatho-adrenomedullary activity, diuresis, and emotional reactions during visual sexual stimulation in human females and males | url = http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.564.5354&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf | journal = Psychosomatic Medicine | volume = 31 | issue = | pages = 251–268 | doi=10.1097/00006842-196905000-00005}}&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent study investigating male arousal showed that men were able to achieve rigid [[erection]]s through visual stimulation of an erotic film alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = B. | last2 = Sikka | first2 = S.

Studies that use visual stimulation as a means for sexual stimulation find that sexual arousal is predominantly correlated with an activation in [[Limbic system|limbic]] and [[Paralimbic cortex|paralimbic]] cortex and in [[Cerebral cortex|subcortical]] structures, along with a deactivation in several parts of the [[Temporal cortex|temporal]] cortex. These same areas are activated during physical sexual stimulation highlighting how powerful visual stimulation can be as a means of [[sexual arousal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holstege | first1 = G. | last2 = Georgiadis | first2 = J. R. | last3 = Paans | first3 = A. M. | last4 = Meiners | first4 = L. C. | last5 = van der Graaf | first5 = F. H. | last6 = Reinders | first6 = A.

=== Olfactory and evolutionary ===
Olfactory information is critical to human sexual behavior. One study investigating olfactory sexual stimulation found that men experience sexual arousal in response to a female perfume. Individuals rated odourant stimulation and perceived sexual arousal. They also had [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|functional MRI]] scans taken during the experiment. The results showed that olfactory stimulation with women's perfume produces activation of specific brain areas associated with sexual arousal in men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Huh | first1 = J. | last2 = Park | first2 = K. | last3 = Hwang | first3 = I. S. | last4 = Jung | first4 = S. I. | last5 = Kim | first5 = H. J. | last6 = Chung | first6 = T. W. | last7 = Jeong | first7 = G. W. | year = 2008 | title = Brain activation areas of sexual arousal with olfactory stimulation in men: A preliminary study using functional MRI | url = http://www.jsm.jsexmed.org/article/S1743-6095(15)31972-X/fulltext | journal = The Journal of Sexual Medicine | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 619–625 | doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2007.00717.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolutionary analysis of sex differences in reproductive strategies can help explain the importance of smell in sexual arousal due to its link to immunological profile and offspring viability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rikowski | first1 = A. | last2 = Grammer | first2 = K. | year = 1999 | title = Human body odour, symmetry and attractiveness | url = | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences | volume = 266 | issue = | pages = 869–874 | doi=10.1098/rspb.1999.0717| pmc = 1689917 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because olfactory cues may be able to trigger an [[incest]] avoidance mechanism by reflecting parts of an individual's genetic equipment. In one study, males rated visual and olfactory information as being equally important for selecting a lover, while females considered olfactory information to be the single most important variable in [[mate choice]]. Additionally, when considering sexual activity, females singled out [[Body odor|body odour]] from all other sensory experiences as most able to negatively affect desire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Herz | first1 = R. S. | last2 = Cahill | first2 = E. D. | year = 1997 | title = Differential use of sensory information in sexual behavior as a function of gender | url = https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rachel_Herz/publication/225106584_Differential_use_of_sensory_information_in_sexual_behavior_as_a_function_of_sex/links/56e01e2608ae979addf0e501.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Human Nature | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 275–286 | doi=10.1007/bf02912495}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Auditory ===
Auditory stimulants may also serve to intensify sexual arousal and the experience of pleasure. Making sounds during sexual arousal and sexual activity is widespread among primates and humans. These include sighs, moans, strong expirations and inspirations, increased breathing rate and occasionally, at orgasm, screams of ecstasy. Many of these sounds are highly exciting to men and women, and act as strong reinforcers of sexual arousal, creating a powerful positive feedback effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Levin | first1 = R. J. | year = 1992 | title = The mechanisms of human female sexual arousal | url = | journal = Annual Review of Sex Research | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 1–48 | doi=10.1080/10532528.1992.10559874}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, [[Female copulatory vocalizations|copulatory vocalisations]] are likely to serve mutual sexual stimulation for mating partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hamilton | first1 = W. J. | last2 = Arrowood | first2 = P. C. | year = 1978 | title = Copulatory vocalizations of chacma baboons (Papio ursinus), gibbons (Hylobates hoolock), and humans | url = | journal = Science | volume = 200 | issue = | pages = 1405–1409 | doi=10.1126/science.663622}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even when not coupled with "touching", sounds can be highly sexually arousing. Commercial erotic material (mainly produced for the male market) uses such sounds extensively. As early as the 1920s and 30s, several genres of singers turned to "low moans" for erotic effect. [[Vaudeville]] Jazz singers often incorporated sex sounds into the narrative of the lyrics. Even contemporary music such as [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]'s "Orgasm" or [[Marvin Gaye]]'s "[[You Sure Love to Ball]]" includes sounds of the female orgasm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Corbett | first1 = J. | last2 = Kapsalis | first2 = T. | year = 1996 | title =  Aural Sex: The Female Orgasm in Popular Sound| url = | journal =  TDR (1988-)| volume = 40 | issue = | pages = 102–111 | doi=10.2307/1146553}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown music to be an auditory sexual stimulant. In one mood induction study, exposure to certain music resulted in significantly greater [[penile tumescence]] and subjective sexual arousal for men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mitchell | first1 = W. B. | last2 = DiBartolo | first2 = P. M. | last3 = Brown | first3 = T. A. | last4 = Barlow | first4 = D. H. | year = 1998 | title = Effects of positive and negative mood on sexual arousal in sexually functional males | url = | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 197–207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar experiment, women did not show significant physiological responses to certain types of music but did reported higher levels of sexual arousal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Laan | first1 = E. | last2 = Everaerd | first2 = W. | last3 = Van Berlo | first3 = R. | last4 = Rijs | first4 = L. | year = 1995 | title = Mood and sexual arousal in women | url = | journal = Behaviour Research and Therapy | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 441–443 | doi=10.1016/0005-7967(94)00059-s}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further studies have looked at the connection between auditory stimulation and the experience of sexual pleasure. Whilst the highest levels of physiological and subjective arousal were found for visual stimuli, spoken-text was found to elicit sexual arousal in men implicating sounds a means for sexual stimulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Julien | first1 = E. | last2 = Over | first2 = R. | year = 1988 | title = Male sexual arousal across five modes of erotic stimulation | url = | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 131–143 | doi=10.1007/bf01542663}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mental stimulation ==
Sexual arousal includes feelings, attractions and desires, as well as physiological changes.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;LeVay, S., &amp; Valente, S. M. (2006). ''Human sexuality'' (2nd ed.). Sunderland, MA: Sinauer Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; These can be elicited not only by physical but also mental stimulations, such as [[Sexual fantasy|fantasy]], erotic literature, dreams, role-play, and imagination.
[[File:Rope bondage-020914-2905-31.jpg|thumb|Bondage can be a sexual fantasy and is often practiced by those participating in BDSM. 
]]

=== Fantasy  ===
[[Sexual fantasy]] is a form of mental sexual stimulation which many people engage in.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It is where a person imagines a sexual experience while they are awake. Fantasy has less social or safety limits than in real life situations. It gives people more freedom to experiment or think of things they could not necessarily try in real life and can be anything from imagining your spouse naked, to imagining a sexual experience with a mythical creature. Common sexual fantasies include imagining activities with a loved partner, reliving past experiences and experiences with multiple partners of the opposite gender.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It's also common to have fantasies about things you would not do in real life and about taboo or illegal activities, such as forcing another, or being forced to have sex, intercourse with a stranger and sex with a boy or girl or older partner.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leitenberg | first1 = H. | last2 = Henning | first2 = K. | year = 1995 | title = Sexual fantasy | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 117 | issue = | pages = 469–496 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.117.3.469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is useful for research because it makes differences between male and female heterosexual preferences clearer than studies of behaviour. Many sexual fantasies are shared between men and women, possibly because of cultural influence.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; However, there are still gender differences that have been found. Men are more likely than women to imagine being in a dominant or active role, whereas women are more likely to imagine themselves as passive participants.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Women's fantasies have significantly more affection and commitment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kelley | first1 = K | year = 1984 | title = Sexual fantasy and attitudes as functions of sex of subject and content of erotica | url = | journal = Imagination, Cognition, and Personality | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 339–347 | doi=10.2190/j66d-n10e-lth5-8aw5}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas men are more likely to fantasise using visual imagery and explicit detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barclay | first1 = A. M. | year = 1973 | title = Sexual fantasies in men and women | url = | journal = Medical Aspects of Human Sexuality | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 205–216 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hardin | first1 = K. | last2 = Gold | first2 = S. | year = 1988 | title = Relationship of sex, sex guilt, and experience to written sexual fantasies | url = http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2190/YQQJ-7A8U-23LE-59KJ | journal = Imagination, Cognition, and Personality | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 155–163 | doi=10.2190/yqqj-7a8u-23le-59kj}}&lt;/ref&gt; One explanation of this difference comes from the [[Evolutionary psychology|evolutionary perspective]]. Women have a higher minimum parental investment than males (they have 9 months of gestation prior birth and are then the main care givers, whereas men only have to provide sperm to ensure their genes are passed on) and are therefore more likely to want commitment from their partner in order to gain resources to improve their offspring's chance of survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ellis | first1 = B. | last2 = Symons | first2 = D. | year = 1990 | title = Sex Differences in Sexual Fantasy: An Evolutionary Psychological Approach | url = | journal = The Journal of Sex Research | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 527–555 | doi=10.1080/00224499009551579}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fantasies can have benefits, such as increasing arousal more than other forms of sexual stimuli (such as an [[Erotic literature|erotic story]]) and increasing [[sexual desire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goldey | first1 = K. L. | last2 = van Anders | first2 = S. M. | year = 2012 | title = Sexual arousal and desire: Interrelations and responses to three modalities of sexual stimuli | url = http://www.jsm.jsexmed.org/article/S1743-6095(15)34099-6/fulltext | journal = Journal of Sexual Medicine | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 2315–2329 | doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2012.02845.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who disclose their sexual fantasies to their partners also have a higher sexual satisfaction. However, whether people are willing to open up to their partner generally depends on the content of such fantasies.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, M. (2012). ''[https://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/bitstream/handle/1808/9806/Anderson_ku_0099D_11825_DATA_1.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y Sexual communication in romantic relationships: An investigation into the disclosure of sexual fantasies]'' (Order No. AAI3489846).&lt;/ref&gt; A more negative effect of sexual fantasy is that it has been linked with [[sexual crimes]], and indeed sexual offenders often report that they have had fantasies related to their offense.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; However, such fantasies are also common among those who have not been involved in such criminal acts&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and non-offenders do not use their fantasies to guide their behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Howitt | first1 = D | year = 2004 | title = What is the role of fantasy in sex offending? | url = | journal = Criminal Behaviour and Mental Health | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 182–188 | doi=10.1002/cbm.585}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, fantasy alone cannot be used as a sign that someone will become an offender.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Dreams ===
Nocturnal orgasms, or "[[Nocturnal emission|wet dreams]]" are when men ejaculate during sleep. These occur during [[Rapid eye movement sleep|REM (rapid eye movement)]] phases of sleep,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; which is the main stage when humans dream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Suzuki | first1 = H. | last2 = Kuga | first2 = R. | last3 = Uchiyama | first3 = M. | year = 2002 | title = Relationship between dream experience and sleep state under ultra-short sleep-wake schedule | url = https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jjppp1983/20/1/20_19/_pdf | journal = Japanese Journal of Physiological Psychology and Psychophysiology | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 19–28 | doi=10.5674/jjppp1983.20.19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that [[Erotic Dream|erotic dreams]] alone are enough to stimulate men, however erections accompany all REM phases.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; According to self-report data, as many as 22% of young women may also experience [[orgasm]] during sleep, with such dreams being more common in college students in higher school years than younger students.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Henton | first1 = C. L. | year = 1976 | title = Nocturnal orgasm in college woman: Its relation to dreams and anxiety associated with sexual factors | url = | journal = Journal of Genetic Psychology | volume = 129 | issue = | page = 245 | doi=10.1080/00221325.1976.10534034}}&lt;/ref&gt; The orgasms experienced were positively correlated with high emotionality, including [[Sexual arousal|sexual excitement]], but also [[anxiety]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Sexual role-play ===
[[Sexual roleplay|Sexual role-play]] is when people act out characters or scenarios which may sexually stimulate each other. This can include [[Sexual fantasy|fantasies]] (discussed above) and [[Sexual fetishism|fetishes]], such as [[BDSM]] (bondage and discipline, dominance and submission, sadism and masochism) or [[Ageplay|age-play]]. It has been described by some as an adult form of [[Live action role-playing game|L.A.R.P]] (live action role-play).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harviainen | first1 = J. T. | year = 2011 | title = Sadomasochist role-playing as live-action role-playing: a trait-descriptive analysis | url = http://www.ijrp.subcultures.nl/wp-content/issue2/IJRPissue2-Article5.pdf | format = PDF | journal = International Journal of Role-Playing | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 59–70 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Role-play can also be carried out online, by typing stories to each other or pretending to be a character, and is therefore a form of mental stimulation you can engage in with another person without them being physically present. Many adolescents find online role-play pleasurable and arousing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nielsen | first1 = S. | last2 = Paasonen | first2 = S. | last3 = Spisak | first3 = S. | year = 2015 | title = 'Pervy role-play and such': Girls' experiences of sexual messaging online | url = | journal = Sex Education | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 472–485 | doi=10.1080/14681811.2015.1048852}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Role-play can also include sexual [[Fan fiction|fanfiction]], where characters from well-known stories, that were not sexually or romantically together in the original story, are written into sexual scenes. [[Slash fiction]] is a type of fan fiction where the characters of the same sex (originally male-male) engage in romantic or sexual activities. Slash fiction allows people the freedom to share stimulating things that can be counter-cultural. However, there may still be [[copyright]] or [[Obscenity|obscenity laws]] if posted onto a public forum or published.&lt;ref&gt;Kustritz, A. M. (2008).

'''Substitutes for leadership theory''' is a [[leadership]] theory first developed by Steven Kerr and John M. Jermier in 1978. The theory states that different situational factors can enhance, neutralize, or substitute for leader behaviors (Avolio, Walumbwa, &amp; Weber, 2009; Den Hartog &amp; Koopman, 2001). It has received criticism for shortcomings due to perceived methodological issues (Dionne, Yammarino, Atwater, &amp; James, 2002; Podsakoff &amp; Mackenzie, 1995). Empirical research has produced mixed results as to its ability to predict subordinate outcomes.

==Origins==
Over the years, researchers have developed many [[leadership theory|leadership theories]].  Prior to the 1970s, [[trait leadership]] theory and [[path-goal theory]] were the two heavily researched theories. (Den Hartog &amp; Koopman, 2001).  Proponents of trait leadership theory held that the ability to lead is a characteristic some people innately have and others do not.  Effort was put forth to uncover which characteristics and abilities leaders had that separated them from non-leaders.
Leadership style was another angle researchers took.  Proponents of this approach did not believe the ability to lead was innate, rather it was a set of behaviors anyone could learn (Den Hartog &amp; Koopman, 2001).

In the mid 1970s, a great deal of research was dedicated to the contingency model and path-goal theory (Schriesheim, 1997).  The contingency model stated that various leadership styles would be more or less effective depending on the situation (Den Hartog &amp; Koopman, 2001; Fiedler, 1965; Hunt, 1967).  Path-goal theory proposed that subordinates would be satisfied with their leader if they perceived that their leader’s behavior would bring them future satisfaction.  Subordinates would be motivated by their leader if they perceived that completing work tasks would bring them satisfaction, and if the leader provided proper coaching, support, rewards, and guidance (House, 1996).  Frustrations with not being able to find significant results with any one theory resulted in the development of reexaminations and new approaches, including questioning which situations necessitated a leader figure and which did not (Den Hartog &amp; Koopman, 2001).

Steven Kerr was one of the researchers publicly expressing his frustrations (e.g., Kerr &amp; Harlan, 1973) with current leadership theories.  In the 1970s, Kerr was at Ohio State University actively involved in leadership research.  Kerr was studying existing proposed subordinate constructs such as organizational independence (Schriesheim, 1997) and proposed leadership constructs such as consideration and initiating structure (put forth by the Ohio State Leadership Studies; Kerr, Schriesheim, Murphy, &amp; Stogdill, 1974).

Subordinates that are organizational independents do not feel tied to one company and are internally motivated instead of motivated by the characteristics of the organization, such as leader behavior (House &amp; Kerr, 1973; Schriesheim, 1997).  Leaders high on initiating structure clarify their own role and their subordinates’ roles in obtaining a goal (Kerr et al., 1974). Kerr and colleagues (1974) noticed many studies had found significant [[Moderation (statistics)|moderators]] that played a part in the relationship between initiating structure leader behavior and subordinate outcomes.  For example, when a task was ambiguous, the relationship between leader initiating structure and subordinate satisfaction was stronger than if the task was clear. These findings made it apparent that there were variables that affected the relationship between leader behavior and subordinate outcomes, making the relationship stronger or weaker.

Kerr (1973) was the first to coin substitutes for leadership as elements in the work setting that lessened leader effectiveness on subordinate outcomes.  Further publications (e.g., Kerr et al., 1974) led to Kerr and Jermier’s 1978 paper, which unveiled substitutes for leadership theory.  This paper presented two types of elements in the job environment: substitutes and neutralizers.  These elements were proposed to serve as moderators in the relationship between leader behavior and subordinate outcomes.

The theory originally classified substitutes as characteristics of the subordinate, characteristics of the task, and characteristics of the organization.  Howell, Dorfman, &amp; Kerr (1986) proposed an alteration to the theory in terms of subordinate classification.  They argued that moderators should be grouped based on their effect on the criterion.  The original theory had already proposed moderators that act as substitutes and moderators that act as neutralizers.  Howell and colleagues added enhancers to these.

Substitutes for leadership theory was a heavily researched area until the late 1980s, when [[transformational leadership]] became the focus of the majority of leadership research (Dionne, Yammarino, Howell, &amp; Villa, 2005).

==Definitions==

===Substitutes for leadership theory===

Substitutes for leadership theory states that different situational factors can enhance, neutralize, or substitute for leader behaviors (Avolio et al., 2009; Den Hartog &amp; Koopman, 2001).

===Substitutes===
Substitutes are variables that make leadership unnecessary for subordinates (Schriesheim, 1997) and reduce the extent to which subordinates rely on their leader (Kerr et al.,1974)

====Examples of substitutes====
* Characteristics of the subordinate
** Subordinate ability (Kerr &amp; Jermier, 1978)
** Subordinate’s professional orientation (Kerr &amp; Jermier, 1978)
* Characteristics of the task
** Unambiguous and routine task (when all subordinates are performing menial labor, there is little role leadership can play; Den Hartog &amp; Koopman, 2001)
** Task that provides its own feedback as to how well the task is being done (Kerr &amp; Jermier, 1978)
** Task that is intrinsically satisfying (Kerr &amp; Jermier, 1978)
* Characteristics of the organization
** Cohesive work groups (a tight-knit group of employees have less need for a leader; Den Hartog &amp; Koopman, 2001)
** Organizational formulation (clear job goals that are written down, performance appraisals that are written down; Howell &amp; Dorfman, 1981; Kerr and Jermier, 1987)
** Self-managed work teams (employees rely on each other, not their leader; Villa, Howell, Dorfman, &amp; Daniel, 2003)

===Enhancers===
Enhancers are variables that serve to strengthen leader influence on subordinate outcomes (Den Hartog &amp; Koopman, 2001; Howell et al., 1986; Schriesheim, 1997).

====Examples of enhancers====
* Characteristics of the subordinate
** Subordinates having experience (those more experienced will be able to translate even the most ambiguous instructions into results; Howell et al., 1986)
* Characteristics of the task
** Task is non-routine (Kerr &amp; Jermier, 1978)
* Characteristics of the organization
** Having group norms that encourage cooperation with leaders (Den Hartog &amp; Koopman, 2001)
** Leader having the ability to reward subordinates (Howell et al., 1986)

===Neutralizers===
Neutralizers are variables which serve to weaken, or block leader influence on subordinate outcomes (Den Hartog &amp; Koopman, 2001; Schriesheim, 1997).

====Examples of neutralizers====
* Characteristics of the subordinate

==Scales used to measure==

===Kerr and Jermier===
The original scale to measure the effects of various substitutes was developed by Kerr and Jermier (1978).  They assessed leadership substitutes via a questionnaire that contained thirteen subscales with a total of 55 items.  The items were on a [[Likert scale]] ranging from 1 (almost always untrue or completely untrue), to 5 (almost always true or almost completely true).

The subscales included were:
# Ability, experience, training, and knowledge
# Professional orientation
# Indifference towards organizational rewards
# Unambiguous, routine, and methodically invariant tasks
# Task-provided feedback concerning accomplishment
# Intrinsically satisfying tasks
# Organizational formulization
# Organizational inflexibility
# Advisory and staff functions
# Close-knit, cohesive, interdependent work groups
# Organizational rewards not within the leader’s control
# Spatial distance between superior and subordinates
# Subordinate need for independence

Kerr and Jermier (1978) tested nine of these subscales in a lab setting and found that they were independent and had adequate internal [[reliability (statistics)|reliabilities]]. They claim that the subscales produce easily interpretable data which describe the extent to which substitutes for leadership are present or absent in a given work situation.
They went on to test their subscales in a field setting using police officers, and concluded that the subscales met acceptable standards of reliability, and can be used to assess the [[validity (statistics)|validity]] of the substitutes for leadership construct in future studies.

===Podsakoff, Niehoff, MacKenzie, and Williams===
Podsakoff, Niehoff, MacKenzie, and Williams (1993) noted that studies testing the substitutes for leadership model had not been fully supportive of the theory, and believed that one reason for this may be that the quality of the scale developed by Kerr and Jermier (1978) to measure the substitutes constructs may be to blame. In response to this, they designed their own 74-item measure of substitutes for leadership.
To test their scale, they administered it to 372 business students.  Their analyses of the [[psychometrics|psychometric]] properties of the revised measure revealed their scale to be superior to Kerr and Jermier’s scale, as evidenced by better dimensionality and reliability of the revised scale.

==Consequences==

Kerr and Jermier (1978) proposed that substitute variables should render leader behaviors unable to predict subordinate outcomes.  Researchers that have tested this characteristic of substitutes have found mixed results (Howell &amp; Dorfman, 1981; Podsakoff &amp; MacKenzie, 1995).

A study involving hospital personnel (Howell &amp; Dorfman, 1981) found that tasks that gave feedback regarding performance were negatively correlated with [[job satisfaction]].  Routine repetitive work tasks were correlated with [[organizational commitment]].  Intrinsically satisfying work, organizational formulation, and cohesive work groups were substitutes that were significantly correlated with both job satisfaction and organizational commitment.  However, they found little evidence that substitutes prevented or replaced a leader’s effect on subordinate job satisfaction or organizational commitment.  The only substitute that served as a replacement was organizational formulation, which replaced leader behavior’s predictive power in explaining subordinate job satisfaction and organizational commitment .

Another study (Podsakoff &amp; Mackenzie, 1995) looked at 1,235 employees working for 265 leaders in a variety of job settings.  Among their findings were that intrinsically satisfying tasks were positively related to subordinate satisfaction, indifference to rewards was negatively related to organizational commitment, and organizational formulation was negatively related to subordinate perceptions of role ambiguity.  The researchers in this study concluded that substitutes for leadership were useful in predicting subordinate outcomes, but leader behaviors and substitutes should always be studied together, because together they explained about a third of the total [[variance]] in subordinate outcomes in their sample .
A more recent study conducted by Dionne and colleagues (2002) collected data from 940 subordinates.  Unsatisfied with the fact that prior studies had tested substitutes, enhancers, and neutralizers as moderators, they tested the effect of substitutes as [[Mediation (statistics)|mediators]] as well as moderators.  Testing a variety of different substitutes and outcomes, the researchers found only very weak evidence that substitutes make a difference, and concluded that leader behaviors are the only important variable in predicting employee outcomes.
Podsakoff, MacKenzie, and Bommer (1996) conducted a [[meta-analysis]] in which they took the results of 22 studies that examined the main effect of substitutes for leadership on the relationship between leader behaviors and subordinate outcomes.  They found evidence supporting the theory— taking into account both leader behaviors and the effect of substitutes accounted for more of the variance in subordinate outcomes than taking into account leader behaviors alone.

==Applications==

===Autonomous work groups===
Bass (1990) suggested that [[autonomous work group]]s can substitute for formal leadership.  In this scenario, employees are divided into groups that are responsible for managing their own day-to-day work (i.e. collective control over pace, distribution of tasks, organization of breaks, recruitment, and training; Gulowsen, 1972).  A [[quasi-experiment]] conducted by Wall, Kemp, Jackson, and Clegg (1986) found that implementing autonomous work groups of 8 to 12 shop-floor employees in a manufacturing setting positively affected both the intrinsic and extrinsic job satisfaction of employees, while obviating some supervisory positions.

===Self-management===
Self-management is defined by Thoresen and Mahoney (1974) as occurring when an individual behaves in a way he would not normally behave, and there are no external forces dictating that the person maintain that behavior.
Self-management requires self-observations (e.g., keeping a log of what one has discussed with others on the phone), specification of goals (e.g., being responsible for setting one’s own schedule and priorities), cueing strategies (e.g., putting a checkout board by the exit to remind an employee to let their secretary know where they are going and when they expect to return), rehearsal (e.g., recording one’s presentation to clients and making corrections as needed), self-evaluation (e.g., using a chart to keep track of work quality and quantity), and self-reinforcement (accomplished by building intrinsic rewards for the performance of tasks; Bass, 1990; Manz &amp; Sims 1980).  These strategies can be understood as being substitutes for leadership.  Instead of requiring that a supervisor monitor a subordinate’s progress on a work task, a subordinate can self-manage by utilizing one of the strategies listed above.  This makes the supervisor’s guidance unnecessary for the subordinate.

==Criticisms and methodological problems with research==

===Common-source bias===
Dionne and colleagues (2002) argued that significant effects of substitutes found in prior studies may be a statistical artifact due to ''common-source bias'', or bias occurring when independent and dependent variables are collected from the same person or group of people.  In a study sampling 49 organizations, Dionne and colleagues controlled for the effect of common-source bias and found no moderating or mediating effects of substitutes on the relationship between leader behavior and group effectiveness.

In a study by Podsakoff and Mackenzie (1995), the predictor variables, as well as the job attitude and role perception variables, were both taken from individual employees, while the performance measures were taken from supervisors. They found that their predictors accounted for a higher proportion of variance in job attitudes and role perceptions, than in employee performance. They posit the reason for this was that their predictors shared a common source with the job attitudes and role perception criterion measures, but not with the employee performance criterion measures. They suggested that common-source bias may not be the only reason for this, but that it should be controlled in future research.

===Lack of longitudinal studies===
Keller (2006) conducted a [[longitudinal study]] in which he pointed out that the vast majority of studies conducted on substitutes for leadership theory are [[cross-sectional study|cross-sectional]] in nature, making it more difficult to discern a causal relationship between substitutes and their effects on employee performance.  Cross-sectional research is focused on finding relationships between variables at a specific point in time, whereas longitudinal studies involve taking multiple measures over a longer period of time.  Keller’s longitudinal study of the effect of substitutes on Research &amp; Development teams found that two of the seven substitutes (ability and intrinsic satisfaction) affected team performance over time.

===Conceptual weakness===
Yukl (1998) pointed out that it is hard to identify specific substitutes and neutralizers for broad behavior categories, and that an improvement on the theory would be to use more specific behaviors in place of "supportive and instrumental leadership behaviors." Yukl said that recent studies testing the theory have used specific behaviors (e.g., contingent reward behavior and role clarification), however the development of the theory does not reflect these developments.

==Closely related constructs==

===Contingency model===
The [[Fiedler contingency model|contingency model]] of leadership was developed by Fred Fiedler in the 1960s after Fiedler spent 12 years collecting data from over 800 groups of employees.  This model predicts that the most effective method of leadership will vary depending on the situation.  A study which supported the model was one Fiedler did with 48 petty officers and 240 recruiters at a Belgium naval training center (Fiedler, 1965).  Fiedler found that a leader’s fit with the group and the task was more important in predicting outcomes than the leader’s characteristics.  For example, controlling leaders went best with heterogeneous groups with low position power (Fiedler, 1965; Hunt 1967).
There are many different theories within the contingency paradigm, which differ on what situational factors change leadership effectiveness.  The most influential theory within this model is path-goal theory (Den Hartog &amp; Koopman, 2001).

===Path-goal theory===
Proposed by Robert House in 1971, [[path-goal theory]] predicts that subordinates will be satisfied with their leader if they feel their leader’s behavior will lead them to satisfaction.  Also, subordinates will be motivated when they feel that their satisfaction depends on their performance and their leader acts in a way to help them reach goals (Den Hartog &amp; Koopman, 2001, House, 1971).  Path-goal theory predicts that when goals and the paths to those goals are clear, subordinates may not need leader guidance (Kerr &amp; Jermier, 1978).

Bolivia's President [[Evo Morales]] told the conference that, one of the world's main polluters, the [[government of the United States|United States]] denied science, turned its backs on multilateralism, and attempted to deny a future to upcoming generations by its national government deciding to [[United States withdrawal from the Paris Agreement|leave the Paris agreement]], making "it the main threat to Mother Earth and life itself".&lt;ref name=aljazeera1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Papenfuss|first1=Mary|title=U.S. Lashed As 'Main Threat' To Environment at UN Ocean Conference|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/us-main-environmental-threat-united-nations_us_593618e4e4b0099e7faeaac2|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=6 June 2017|date=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wash1/&gt;&lt;ref name=chicagotribune1/&gt;&lt;ref name=townhall1/&gt; [[Albert II, Prince of Monaco]] called Trump's withdrawal "catastrophic" and the reaction from US mayors, governors and many in the corporate world as "wonderful".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monaco's ruler: Trump should listen to scientists on climate|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/monacos-ruler-trump-should-listen-to-scientists-on-climate/2017/06/07/3eeca946-4bce-11e7-987c-42ab5745db2e_story.html|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 May Sweden's deputy prime minister [[Isabella Lövin]] stated that the United States is resisting plans to highlight how climate change is disrupting life in the oceans at the conference, that the US has negatively affected preparations and that "the decline of the oceans is really a threat to the entire planet" with a "need to start working together".&lt;ref name=reuters1&gt;{{cite web|title=INTERVIEW-US resists plan to link climate change, ocean health-UN co-chair|url=http://news.trust.org/item/20170530150853-6bg97|publisher=Thomson Reuters Foundation|accessdate=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. resists plan to link climate change, ocean health: U.N. co-chair|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/r-us-resists-plan-to-link-climate-change-ocean-health-un-co-chair-2017-5?IR=T|publisher=Business Insider|accessdate=9 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lovin also makes note of difficulties to engage with Washington in the conference, partly because key posts at the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] remain unfilled since the end of the Obama administration.&lt;ref name=reuters1/&gt;

&lt;!--Subsidies--&gt;
UNCTAD Secretary-General [[Mukhisa Kituyi]] states that [[subsidies]] from wealthy governments encourage overfishing, overcapacity and may contribute to [[Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing|illegal and unregulated fishing]], creating [[food insecurity]], unemployment and poverty for people relying mainly on fish as their primary source of nourishment or livelihood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNCTAD and other global influencers gather to discuss eliminating harmful fisheries subsidies at UN Ocean Conference|url=http://unctad.org/en/pages/newsdetails.aspx?OriginalVersionID=1494|accessdate=7 June 2017|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact and progress==&lt;!--/continuation/...--&gt;
&lt;!--Requires not just UN--&gt;
[[Marine biologist]] Ayana Elizabeth Johnson notes that the UN's work alone is not nearly enough and that for a solution to this existential crisis of the health of our global environment, strong and inspired leadership at all levels – from mayors, to governors, CEOs, scientists, artists and presidents is needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Ayana Elizabeth|title=Climate, Oceans, the United Nations, and What's Next|url=http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2017/06/02/climate-oceans-the-united-nations-and-whats-next/|website=National Geographic Society (blogs)|accessdate=6 June 2017|date=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Goals and how much of it has been achieved etc--&gt;
In 2010 the international community agreed to protect 10% of the ocean by 2020 in the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]]'s Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011–2020 and Sustainable
Development Goal 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marine Protected Areas and climate change|url=https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/documents/2016-067.pdf|accessdate=10 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global marine protected are a target of 10% to be achieved by 2020|url=https://www.cbd.int/doc/press/2017/pr-2017-06-05-mpa-pub-en.pdf|accessdate=10 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However as of June 2017 less than 3% of the ocean are under some form of protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mittler|first1=Daniel|title=Time for ocean action – for us, our climate and diversity on earth|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/time-for-ocean-action-for-us-our-climate-and-diversity_us_59382a87e4b0b65670e566c6|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=9 June 2017|date=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pledges made during the conference would add around an additional 4.4 percent of protected marine areas,&lt;ref name=indianexpress1/&gt; increasing the protected total to around 7.4% of the ocean.

&lt;!--Organizers' résumé--&gt;
Peter Thomson called the conference was a success, stating that he was "satisfied with [its] results", that the conference "held at a very critical time" has "turned the tide on [[marine pollution]]". He says that "we are now working around the world to restore a relationship of balance and respect towards the ocean".&lt;ref name=unn1/&gt;&lt;ref name=xin1/&gt;

&lt;!--Procedure from there--&gt;
[[Elizabeth Wilson]], director of international conservation at [[Pew Charitable Trusts]] thinks that this meeting "will be followed by a whole series of other meetings that we hope will be impacted in a positive way".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='We cannot afford to fail': Pacific leaders appeal for action on World Oceans Day|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-06-08/pacific-leaders-set-the-agenda-for-world-oceans-day/8597994|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=9 June 2017|language=en-AU|date=8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
