'''Angkor Wat''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|ŋ|k|ɔːr|_|ˈ|w|ɒ|t}}; {{lang-km|អង្គរវត្ត}}, "Capital Temple") is a temple complex in [[Cambodia]] and one of the largest
religious monuments in the world, on a site measuring {{convert|162.6|ha|m2 acre}}.&lt;ref name="Guinness"&gt;{{cite web|title=Largest religious structure|work=Guinness World Records|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-religious-structure/|accessdate=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally constructed as a [[Hinduism|Hindu]] temple dedicated to the god [[Vishnu]] for the [[Khmer Empire]], gradually transforming into a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] temple towards the end of the 12th century.&lt;ref name="cyark"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyark.org/news/recycling-monuments-the-hinduismbuddhism-switch-at-angkor|title=Recycling Monuments: The Hinduism/Buddhism Switch at Angkor|author=Ashley M.

Breaking from the [[Shaivism|Shaiva]] tradition of previous kings, Angkor Wat was instead dedicated to Vishnu. As the best-preserved temple at the site, it is the only one to have remained a significant religious centre since its foundation. The temple is at the top of the high classical style of [[Khmer architecture]]. It has become a symbol of [[Cambodia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Government : Cambodia|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cb.html|work=CIA World Factbook}}&lt;/ref&gt; appearing on [[Flag of Cambodia|its national flag]], and it is the country's prime attraction for visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cambodia's Angkor Wat Breaking Records for Visitors Again {{!}} News from Tourism Cambodia|url=http://www.tourismcambodia.com/news/localnews/8637/cambodias-angkor-wat-breaking-records-for-visitors-again.htm|website=Tourism of Cambodia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Angkor Wat combines two basic plans of Khmer temple architecture: the [[Khmer architecture#Temple mountain|temple-mountain]] and the later [[Khmer architecture#Gallery|galleried temple]]. It is designed to represent [[Mount Meru]], home of the [[Deva (Hinduism)|devas]] in [[Hindu mythology]]: within a [[moat]] more than 5 kilometres (3&amp;nbsp;mi) long&lt;ref name=Jarus2018&gt;{{cite news |last1=Jarus |first1=Owen |title=Angkor Wat: History of Ancient Temple |url=https://www.livescience.com/23841-angkor-wat.html |accessdate=28 July 2018 |work=Live Science |publisher=Purch |date=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an outer wall {{convert|3.6|km|mi|1}} long are three rectangular galleries, each raised above the next. At the centre of the temple stands a [[quincunx]] of towers. Unlike most Angkorian temples, Angkor Wat is oriented to the west; scholars are divided as to the significance of this. The temple is admired for the grandeur and harmony of the architecture, its extensive [[Relief#Bas-relief or low relief|bas-reliefs]], and for the numerous [[devata]]s adorning its walls.

==Etymology==
The modern name, Angkor Wat ({{lang-km|អង្គរវត្ត}}) (alternate name: ''Nokor Wat'', {{lang-km|នគរវត្ត}}),&lt;ref&gt;Khmer dictionary adopted from Khmer dictionary of Buddhist institute of Cambodia, p. 1424, pub. 2007&lt;/ref&gt; means "Temple City" or "City of Temples" in [[Khmer language|Khmer]]; ''Angkor'' ({{lang-km|អង្គរ}}) meaning "city" or "capital city", is a vernacular form of the word ''nokor'' ({{lang-km|នគរ}}), which comes from the [[Sanskrit]] word ''nagara'' ([[Devanāgarī]]: नगर).&lt;ref name=Nath&gt;Chuon Nath Khmer Dictionary (1966, Buddhist Institute, Phnom Penh)&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Wat]]'' ({{lang-km|វត្ត}}) is the [[Khmer language|Khmer]] word for "temple grounds", also derived from [[Sanskrit]] ''vāṭa'' ([[Devanāgarī]]: वाट), meaning "enclosure".&lt;ref name=Headley77&gt;Cambodian-English Dictionary by Robert K. Headley, Kylin Chhor, Lam Kheng Lim, Lim Hak Kheang, and Chen Chun (1977, Catholic University Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

The original name of the temple was Vrah Viṣṇuloka or Parama Viṣṇuloka ([[Sanskrit]]), ({{lang-km|បរមវិស្ណុលោក}} – ''Barom Visnulōk'') which means the sacred dwelling of Vishnu.

==History==

[[File:Suryavarman II in procession.jpg|thumb|left|King [[Suryavarman II]], the builder of Angkor Wat]]
Angkor Wat lies {{convert|5.5|km|mi}} north of the modern town of [[Siem Reap]], and a short distance south and slightly east of the previous capital, which was centred at [[Baphuon]]. In an area of Cambodia where there is an important group of ancient structures, it is the southernmost of Angkor's main sites.

According to legend, the construction of Angkor Wat was ordered by Indra to serve as a palace for his son Precha Ket Mealea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HAZrFhvqnTkC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage|title=Asiatic Mythology:A Detailed Description and Explanation of the Mythologies of All the Great Nations of Asia|author1= J. Hackin|author2= Clayment Huart|author3= Raymonde Linossier| author4=Raymonde Linossier|author5= H. de Wilman Grabowska|author6= Charles-Henri Marchal|author7= Henri Maspero|author8= Serge Eliseev|date=1932|page=194|isbn=978-8120609204}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 13th-century Chinese traveller [[Zhou Daguan]], some believed that the temple was constructed in a single night by a divine architect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= A Record of Cambodia: The Land and Its People|author=daguan Zhou|others=Translated by Peter Harris|publisher=Silkworm Books|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial design and construction of the temple took place in the first half of the 12th century, during the reign of [[Suryavarman II]] (ruled 1113 – c. 1150). Dedicated to [[Vishnu]], it was built as the king's state temple and capital city. As neither the foundation [[Stele|stela]] nor any contemporary inscriptions referring to the temple have been found, its original name is unknown, but it may have been known as "Varah Vishnu-lok" after the presiding deity. Work seems to have ended shortly after the king's death, leaving some of the [[Relief#Bas-relief or low relief|bas-relief]] decoration unfinished.&lt;ref name="Ohio"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://huntingtonarchive.osu.edu/seasia/angkor.html|title=Angkor Wat, 1113–1150 |accessdate=27 April 2008 |publisher=College of the Arts, The Ohio State University |work=The Huntington Archive of Buddhist and Related Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1177, approximately 27 years after the death of Suryavarman II, Angkor was sacked by the [[Champa|Chams]], the traditional enemies of the Khmer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Coedès|first= George|authorlink= George Coedès|editor= Walter F.

Towards the end of the 12th century, Angkor Wat gradually transformed from a Hindu centre of worship to [[Buddhism]], which continues to the present day.&lt;ref name="cyark" /&gt; Angkor Wat is unusual among the Angkor temples in that although it was largely neglected after the 16th century it was never completely abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;Glaize, ''The Monuments of the Angkor Group'' p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Fourteen inscriptions dated from the 17th century discovered in Angkor area testify to [[Japanese people|Japanese]] Buddhist pilgrims that had established small settlements alongside Khmer locals.&lt;ref name="Nikkei"&gt;{{cite web |title =Japanese Diaspora – Cambodia | author = Masako Fukawa | author2 = Stan Fukawa |date = 6 Nov 2014 | website = Discover Nikkei | url =http://www.discovernikkei.org/en/journal/2014/11/6/japanese-diaspora-cambodia/ | accessdate =18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the temple was thought by the Japanese visitors as the famed [[Jetavana]] garden of the [[Buddha]], which originally located in the kingdom of [[Magadha]], India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Au-dela du plan Japonais du XVII siècle d'Angkor Vat,  (A XVII century Japanese map of Angkor Wat) |author = Abdoul-Carime Nasir |url =http://aefek.free.fr/iso_album/carteangkor_jetavana.pdf | language =French |accessdate =18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best-known inscription tells of [[Ukondafu Kazufusa]], who celebrated the [[Khmer New Year]] at Angkor Wat in 1632.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = History of Cambodia, Post-Angkor Era (1431 – present day) | work = Cambodia Travel |url =http://www.cambodia-travel.com/khmer/post-angkor.htm |accessdate =18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first Western visitors to the temple was [[António da Madalena]], a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] friar who visited in 1586 and said that it "is of such extraordinary construction that it is not possible to describe it with a pen, particularly since it is like no other building in the world. It has towers and decoration and all the refinements which the human genius can conceive of."&lt;ref&gt;Higham, ''The Civilization of Angkor'' pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-19th century, the temple was effectively rediscovered by the French naturalist and explorer [[Henri Mouhot]], who popularised the site in the West through the publication of travel notes, in which he wrote:{{cquote|One of these temples, a rival to that of [[Solomon's Temple|Solomon]], and erected by some ancient [[Michelangelo]],
might take an honorable place beside our most beautiful buildings.
It is grander than anything
left to us by [[Ancient Greece|Greece]]
or [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], and presents a sad contrast to the state of barbarism in which the nation is now plunged.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [http://www.cambodianview.com/documents/articles/Brief_Presentation.pdf Brief Presentation by Venerable Vodano Sophan Seng]&lt;/ref&gt;}}Angkor Wat may relate to the architecture of the Greek and Roman record explored in terms of the west rather than east orientation of the temple. Some architects have written that it is 'correct' for the construction to be facing to the west. In temple orientations for the Greek and Etruscan context, west is associated with "right" and the "underworld" to suggest a religious connection of the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aveni|first=A.|last2=Romano|first2=G.|date=September 1994|title=Orientation and Etruscan ritual|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/orientation-and-etruscan-ritual/E68E1A7992190129C4168A3629E39C9A|journal=Antiquity|language=en|volume=68|issue=260|pages=545–563|doi=10.1017/S0003598X00047049|issn=0003-598X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mouhot, like other early Western visitors, found it difficult to believe that the Khmers could have built the temple and mistakenly dated it to around the same era as Rome. His reports inspired the French government, already an established presence in Indochina, to begin a systematic study of the ruins. The true history of Angkor Wat was pieced together from stylistic and [[epigraphy|epigraphic]] evidence accumulated during subsequent clearing and restoration work.  There were no ordinary dwellings or houses or other signs of settlement, including cooking utensils, weapons, or items of clothing usually found at ancient sites. Instead there is only the evidence of the monuments themselves.&lt;ref name="Southeast Asia 1995 p. 67-99"&gt;''Time Life Lost Civilizations series: Southeast Asia: A Past Regained'' (1995). pp. 67–99&lt;/ref&gt; An exploration commission began drawing up a list of principal monuments. Subsequent missions copied inscriptions written on Angkor buildings so scholars might translate them and learn something of Angkor's history. By 1885 they had worked up a chronology of the rulers and developed the outlines of a description of the civilization that had produced the temple complex.  In 1898 the French decided to commit substantial funds to Angkor's preservation. Centuries of neglect had permitted the jungle to recapture many of the more significant structures, and unless efforts were made to free the buildings from the embrace of huge banyan and silk-cotton trees, they might soon be crushed to destruction.

The 20th century saw considerable restoration of Angkor Wat.&lt;ref name="multiref1"&gt;Glaize p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Gradually teams of laborers and archeologists pushed back the jungle and exposed the expanses of stone, permitting the sun once again to illuminate the dark corners of the temple. Work was interrupted by the [[Cambodian Civil War]] and [[Khmer Rouge]] control of the country during the 1970s and 1980s, but relatively little damage was done during this period. Camping Khmer Rouge forces used whatever wood remained in the building structures for firewood, and a shoot-out between Khmer Rouge and Vietnamese forces put a few bullet holes in a bas relief. Far more damage was done after the wars, by [[art thieves]] working out of Thailand, which, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, claimed almost every head that could be lopped off the structures, including reconstructions.&lt;ref name="Angkor Battle"&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.dk/books?id=9hAteN7ddW0C&amp;pg=PA52&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;dq=Angkor+Wat+Khmer+Rouge+war#v=onepage&amp;q=Angkor%20Wat%20Khmer%20Rouge%20war|title=The Battle of Angkor Wat |magazine=New Scientist|pages=52–57|date=14 October 1989 |author=Russell Ciochon |author2=Jamie James |last-author-amp=yes |accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The temple is a powerful symbol of Cambodia, and is a source of great national pride that has factored into Cambodia's diplomatic relations with France, the United States and its neighbour Thailand. A depiction of Angkor Wat has been a part of [[Flag of Cambodia|Cambodian national flags]] since the introduction of the first version circa 1863.&lt;ref&gt;Flags of the World, [http://flagspot.net/flags/kh_hstry.html Cambodian Flag History]&lt;/ref&gt; From a larger historical and even transcultural perspective, however, the temple of Angkor Wat did not become a symbol of national pride ''sui generis'' but had been inscribed into a larger politico-cultural process of French-colonial heritage production in which the original temple site was presented in French colonial and universal exhibitions in Paris and Marseille between 1889 and 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Falser, Michael (2011).  [http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/ojs/index.php/transcultural/article/view/9083 ''Krishna and the Plaster Cast. Translating the Cambodian Temple of Angkor Wat in the French Colonial Period''].&lt;/ref&gt; Angkor Wat's aesthetics were also on display in the plaster cast museum of [[Louis Delaporte]] called ''musée Indo-chinois'' which existed in the Parisian Trocadero Palace from c.1880 to the mid-1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Falser, Michael (2013).  [http://www.riha-journal.org/articles/2013/2013-apr-jun/falser-musee-indo-chinois ''From Gaillon to Sanchi, from Vézelay to Angkor Wat. The Musée Indo-Chinois in Paris: A Transcultural Perspective on Architectural Museums.''].&lt;/ref&gt;

The splendid artistic legacy of Angkor Wat and other Khmer monuments in the [[Angkor]] region led directly to France adopting Cambodia as a [[protectorate]] on 11 August 1863 and invading Siam to take control of the ruins. This quickly led to Cambodia reclaiming lands in the northwestern corner of the country that had been under Siamese (Thai) control since AD 1351 (Manich Jumsai 2001), or by some accounts, AD 1431.&lt;ref&gt;Penny Edwards (2007).''Cambodge: The Cultivation of a Nation, 1860–1945'' {{ISBN|978-0824829230}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cambodia gained independence from France on 9 November 1953 and has controlled Angkor Wat since that time. It is safe to say that from the colonial period onwards until the site's nomination as [[UNESCO World Heritage]] in 1992, this specific temple of Angkor Wat was instrumental in the formation of the modern and gradually globalised concept of built cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Falser, Michael: Clearing the Path towards Civilization – 150 Years of "Saving Angkor". In: Michael Falser (ed.) Cultural Heritage as Civilizing Mission. From Decay to Recovery. Springer: Heidelberg, New York, pp.&amp;nbsp;279–346.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, it was announced that a research team from [[University of Sydney]] had found a previously unseen ensemble of buried towers built and demolished during the construction of Angkor Wat, as well as massive structure of unknown purpose on its south side and wooden fortifications. The findings also include evidence of low-density residential occupation in the region, with a road grid, ponds and mounds. These indicate that the temple precinct, bounded by moat and wall, may not have been used exclusively by the priestly elite, as was previously thought. The team used [[LiDAR]], [[ground-penetrating radar]] and targeted excavation to map Angkor Wat.&lt;ref name="sydney"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2015/12/09/new-discoveries-redefine-angkor-wat-s-history.html|title=Recent research has transformed archaeologists' understanding of Angkor Wat and its surroundings|publisher=University of Sydney| date=9 December 2015| accessdate =10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Site and plan===
[[File:Angkor-Wat-from-the-air.JPG|thumb|left|Aerial view of Angkor Wat]]
Angkor Wat, located at {{Coord|13|24|45|N|103|52|0|E|type:landmark_region:KH|display=inline}}, is a unique combination of the [[Khmer architecture#Temple mountain|temple mountain]] (the standard design for the empire's state temples) and the later plan of concentric [[Khmer architecture#Gallery|galleries]]. The construction of Angkor Wat also suggests that there was a celestial significance with certain features of the temple. This is observed in the temple's east-west orientation, and lines of sight from terraces within the temple that show specific towers to be at the precise location of the sunrise on a solstice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fleming |first1=Stuart |title=Science Scope: The City of Angkor Wat: A Royal Observatory on Life? |journal=Archaeology |date=1985 |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=62–72 |jstor=41731666}}&lt;/ref&gt; The temple is a representation of [[Mount Meru]], the home of the gods: the central [[quincunx]] of towers symbolises the five peaks of the mountain, and the walls and moat symbolise the surrounding mountain ranges and ocean.&lt;ref name="multiref2"&gt;Freeman and Jacques p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Access to the upper areas of the temple was progressively more exclusive, with the laity being admitted only to the lowest level.&lt;ref&gt;Glaize p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike most Khmer temples, Angkor Wat is oriented to the west rather than the east. This has led many (including [[Maurice Glaize]] and [[George Coedès]]) to conclude that Suryavarman intended it to serve as his funerary temple.&lt;ref name=Coedes&gt;{{cite book|last= Coedès|first= George|authorlink= George Coedès|editor= Walter F. Vella|others= trans.Susan Brown Cowing|title= The Indianized States of Southeast Asia|date= 1968|publisher= University of Hawaii Press|isbn= 978-0824803681 |page=162 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The diplomatic envoy Zhou Da Guan sent by Emperor [[Temür Khan]] to Angkor in 1295 reported that the head of state was buried in a tower after his death, and he referred to Angkor Wat as a mausoleum&lt;/ref&gt; Further evidence for this view is provided by the [[Relief#Bas-relief or low relief|bas-reliefs]], which proceed in a counter-clockwise direction—''[[Mandir|prasavya]]'' in Hindu terminology—as this is the reverse of the normal order. Rituals take place in reverse order during Brahminic funeral services.&lt;ref name="multiref1" /&gt; The archaeologist [[Charles Higham (archaeologist)|Charles Higham]] also describes a container which may have been a funerary jar which was recovered from the central tower.&lt;ref name="multiref3"&gt;Higham, ''The Civilization of Angkor'' p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been nominated by some as the greatest expenditure of energy on the disposal of a corpse.&lt;ref name="Scarre p. 81-85"&gt;Scarre, Chris editor (1999). "The Seventy Wonders of the Ancient World", London: Thames &amp; Hudson, pp.&amp;nbsp;81–85&lt;/ref&gt;  Freeman and Jacques, however, note that several other temples of [[Angkor]] depart from the typical eastern orientation, and suggest that Angkor Wat's alignment was due to its dedication to [[Vishnu]], who was associated with the west.&lt;ref name="multiref2" /&gt;

A further interpretation of Angkor Wat has been proposed by Eleanor Mannikka. Drawing on the temple's alignment and dimensions, and on the content and arrangement of the bas-reliefs, she argues that the structure represents a claimed new era of peace under King [[Suryavarman II]]: "as the measurements of solar and lunar time cycles were built into the sacred space of Angkor Wat, this divine mandate to rule was anchored to consecrated chambers and corridors meant to perpetuate the king's power and to honour and placate the deities manifest in the heavens above."&lt;ref&gt;[[Eleanor Mannikka|Mannikka, Eleanor]].

===Style===
[[File:Angkor Vat (6931599619).jpg|thumb|left|Angkor Wat as viewed from the side]]
Angkor Wat is the prime example of the classical style of [[Khmer architecture]]—the Angkor Wat style—to which it has given its name. By the 12th century Khmer architects had become skilled and confident in the use of [[sandstone]] (rather than brick or [[laterite]]) as the main building material. Most of the visible areas are of sandstone blocks, while laterite was used for the outer wall and for hidden structural parts. The binding agent used to join the blocks is yet to be identified, although natural [[resin]]s or [[slaked lime]] has been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gacp-angkor.de/ German Apsara Conservation Project] Building Techniques, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The temple has drawn praise above all for the harmony of its design. According to Maurice Glaize, a mid-20th-century conservator of Angkor, the temple "attains a classic perfection by the restrained monumentality of its finely balanced elements and the precise arrangement of its proportions. It is a work of power, unity and style."&lt;ref&gt;Glaize p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Architecturally, the elements characteristic of the style include: the [[Ogive|ogival]], redented towers shaped like [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]] buds; half-[[Architecture of Cambodia#Gallery|galleries]] to broaden passageways; axial galleries connecting enclosures; and the cruciform terraces which appear along the main axis of the temple. Typical decorative elements are [[Architecture of Cambodia#Apsara and devata|devatas (or apsaras)]], [[bas-relief]]s, and on [[pediment]]s extensive garlands and narrative scenes. The statuary of Angkor Wat is considered conservative, being more static and less graceful than earlier work.&lt;ref&gt;APSARA authority, [http://www.autoriteapsara.org/en/angkor/art/styles/angkorian/angkor_vat.html Angkor Vat Style]&lt;/ref&gt; Other elements of the design have been destroyed by looting and the passage of time, including [[gilding|gilded]] [[stucco]] on the towers, gilding on some figures on the bas-reliefs, and wooden ceiling panels and doors.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman and Jacques p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Features===

====Outer enclosure====
[[File:West wall of the outer enclosure Angkor Wat0636.jpg|thumb|left|View of the west wall of the outer enclosure of Angkor Wat]]
[[File:Angkor Wat 005.jpg|thumb|right|Northern library]]
The outer wall, {{convert|1024|m|ft|abbr=on}} by {{convert|802|m|ft|abbr=on}} and {{convert|4.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} high, is surrounded by a {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}} apron of open ground and a moat {{convert|190|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide and over 5 kilometres (3&amp;nbsp;mi) in perimeter.&lt;ref name=Jarus2018 /&gt; Access to the temple is by an earth bank to the east and a sandstone causeway to the west; the latter, the main entrance, is a later addition, possibly replacing a wooden bridge.&lt;ref name="multiref4"&gt;Freeman and Jacques p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; There are [[Architecture of Cambodia#Gopura|gopuras]] at each of the [[cardinal point]]s; the western is by far the largest and has three ruined towers. Glaize notes that this gopura both hides and echoes the form of the temple proper.&lt;ref&gt;Glaize p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the southern tower is a statue of [[Vishnu]], known as ''Ta Reach'', which may originally have occupied the temple's central shrine.&lt;ref name="multiref4" /&gt; Galleries run between the towers and as far as two further entrances on either side of the gopura often referred to as "elephant gates", as they are large enough to admit those animals. These galleries have square pillars on the outer (west) side and a closed wall on the inner (east) side. The ceiling between the pillars is decorated with [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]] rosettes; the west face of the wall with dancing figures; and the east face of the wall with balustered windows, dancing male figures on prancing animals, and [[Architecture of Cambodia#Apsara and devata|devatas]], including (south of the entrance) the only one in the temple to be showing her teeth.

The outer wall encloses a space of 820,000 square metres (203 acres), which besides the temple proper was originally occupied by the city and, to the north of the temple, the royal palace. Like all secular buildings of Angkor, these were built of perishable materials rather than of stone, so nothing remains of them except the outlines of some of the streets.&lt;ref name="Freeman and Jacques p. 50"&gt;Freeman and Jacques p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the area is now covered by forest. A {{convert|350|m|ft|abbr=on}} causeway connects the western gopura to the temple proper, with [[Architecture of Cambodia#Naga|naga]] balustrades and six sets of steps leading down to the city on either side. Each side also features a [[Architecture of Cambodia#Library|library]] with entrances at each cardinal point, in front of the third set of stairs from the entrance, and a pond between the library and the temple itself. The ponds are later additions to the design, as is the cruciform terrace guarded by lions connecting the causeway to the central structure.&lt;ref name="Freeman and Jacques p. 50"/&gt;

====Central structure====
[[File:Middle tower of Angkor Wat temple.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The middle tower of Angkor Wat symbolizes the sacred mountain, mount Meru.]]
[[File:Angot war.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of the central structure; in front of the central structure lies the cruciform terrace.]]
The temple stands on a terrace raised higher than the city. It is made of three rectangular [[Architecture of Cambodia#Gallery|galleries]] rising to a central tower, each level higher than the last. Mannikka interprets these galleries as being dedicated to the king, [[Brahma]], the moon, and [[Vishnu]].&lt;ref name="Ohio" /&gt; Each gallery has a [[gopura]] at each of the points, and the two inner galleries each have towers at their corners, forming a [[Architecture of Cambodia#Quincunx|quincunx]] with the central tower. Because the temple faces west, the features are all set back towards the east, leaving more space to be filled in each enclosure and gallery on the west side; for the same reason the west-facing steps are shallower than those on the other sides.
[[File:Awatcornertower01.JPG|thumb|left|upright|A tower of Angkor Wat]]
[[File:REJ 2790.jpg|thumb|View of the Outer Gallery of Angkor Wat]]

The outer gallery measures {{convert|187|m|ft|abbr=on}} by {{convert|215|m|ft|abbr=on}}, with pavilions rather than towers at the corners. The gallery is open to the outside of the temple, with columned half-galleries extending and buttressing the structure. Connecting the outer gallery to the second enclosure on the west side is a cruciform cloister called ''Preah Poan'' (the "Hall of a Thousand Gods"). [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] images were left in the cloister by pilgrims over the centuries, although most have now been removed. This area has many inscriptions relating the good deeds of pilgrims, most written in [[Khmer language|Khmer]] but others in [[Burmese language|Burmese]] and Japanese. The four small courtyards marked out by the cloister may originally have been filled with water.&lt;ref&gt;Glaize p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; North and south of the cloister are [[Architecture of Cambodia#Library|libraries]].

Beyond, the second and inner galleries are connected to each other and to two flanking libraries by another cruciform terrace, again a later addition. From the second level upwards, [[Architecture of Cambodia#Apsara and devata|devatas]] abound on the walls, singly or in groups of up to four. The second-level enclosure is {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} by {{convert|115|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and may originally have been flooded to represent the [[ocean]] around [[Mount Meru]].&lt;ref&gt;Ray, ''Lonely Planet guide to Cambodia'' p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; Three sets of steps on each side lead up to the corner towers and gopuras of the inner gallery. The very steep stairways represent the difficulty of ascending to the kingdom of the gods.&lt;ref&gt;Ray p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; This inner gallery, called the ''Bakan'', is a {{convert|60|m|ft|abbr=on}} square with axial galleries connecting each gopura with the central shrine, and subsidiary shrines located below the corner towers. The roofings of the galleries are decorated with the motif of the body of a snake ending in the heads of lions or [[garuda]]s. Carved [[Architecture of Cambodia#Lintels and pediments|lintels and pediments]] decorate the entrances to the galleries and to the shrines.
The tower above the central shrine rises {{convert|43|m|ft|abbr=on}} to a height of {{convert|65|m|ft|abbr=on}} above the ground; unlike those of previous temple mountains, the central tower is raised above the surrounding four.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; The shrine itself, originally occupied by a statue of Vishnu and open on each side, was walled in when the temple was converted to [[Theravada Buddhism]], the new walls featuring standing Buddhas. In 1934, the conservator George Trouvé excavated the pit beneath the central shrine: filled with sand and water it had already been robbed of its treasure, but he did find a sacred foundation deposit of [[gold leaf]] two metres above ground level.&lt;ref&gt;Glaize p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Decoration====
[[File:Awatoceanofmilk01.JPG|thumb|The bas-relief of the [[Samudra manthan|Churning of the Sea of Milk]] shows [[Vishnu]] in the centre, his turtle [[Avatar]] [[Kurma]] below, [[asura]]s and [[deva (Hinduism)|devas]] to left and right, and [[apsaras]] and [[Indra]] above.]]
[[File:Angkor Wat - 047 Apsaras (8581709930).jpg|thumb|left|[[Devatas]] are characteristic of the Angkor Wat style.]]
Integrated with the architecture of the building, and one of the causes for its fame is Angkor Wat's extensive decoration, which predominantly takes the form of [[bas-relief]] friezes. The inner walls of the outer gallery bear a series of large-scale scenes mainly depicting episodes from the Hindu epics the [[Ramayana]] and the [[Mahabharata]]. Higham has called these, "the greatest known linear arrangement of stone carving".&lt;ref&gt;Higham, ''Early Cultures of Mainland Southeast Asia'' p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt; From the north-west corner anti-clockwise, the western gallery shows the Battle of Lanka (from the Ramayana, in which [[Rama]] defeats [[Ravana]]) and the [[Kurukshetra War|Battle of Kurukshetra]] (from the Mahabharata, showing the mutual annihilation of the [[Kaurava]] and [[Pandava]] clans). On the southern gallery follow the only historical scene, a procession of [[Suryavarman II]], then the 32 [[hell]]s and 37 [[heaven]]s of Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;Glaize p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Angkor-4+.JPG|thumb|upright|Decoration on the corner]]
On the eastern gallery is one of the most celebrated scenes, the [[Kurma|Churning of the Sea of Milk]], showing 92&lt;ref&gt;Glaize&lt;/ref&gt; [[asura]]s and 88 [[deva (Hinduism)|devas]] using the serpent [[Vasuki (snake)|Vasuki]] to churn the sea under Vishnu's direction (Mannikka counts only 91 asuras, and explains the asymmetrical numbers as representing the number of days from the [[winter solstice]] to the [[spring equinox]], and from the equinox to the summer [[solstice]]).&lt;ref&gt;Described in Michael Buckley, [http://www.veloasia.com/library/buckley/churning_milk.html The Churning of the Ocean of Milk]&lt;/ref&gt; It is followed by Vishnu defeating [[asura]]s (a 16th-century addition). The northern gallery shows Krishna's victory over [[Banasura|Bana]] (where according to Glaize, "The workmanship is at its worst").&lt;ref&gt;Glaize p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Angkor Wat is decorated with depictions of [[apsaras]] and [[devata]]; there are more than 1,796 depictions of devata in the present research inventory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.devata.org/2010/02/angkor-wat-devata-inventory/ Angkor Wat devata inventory – February 2010] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423123631/http://www.devata.org/2010/02/angkor-wat-devata-inventory/ |date=23 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Angkor Wat architects employed small apsara images ({{convert|30|cm|in|abbr=on}}–{{convert|40|cm|in|abbr=on}}) as decorative motifs on pillars and walls. They incorporated larger devata images (all full-body portraits measuring approximately {{convert|95|cm|in|abbr=on}}–{{convert|110|cm|in|abbr=on}}) more prominently at every level of the temple from the entry pavilion to the tops of the high towers. In 1927, Sappho Marchal published a study cataloging the remarkable diversity of their hair, headdresses, garments, stance, jewellery and decorative flowers, which Marchal concluded were based on actual practices of the Angkor period.&lt;ref&gt;Sappho Marchal, ''Khmer Costumes and Ornaments of the Devatas of Angkor Wat''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Construction techniques===
[[File:Angkor Wat 13 11.JPG|thumb|upright|Corridor]]
The stones, as smooth as polished marble, were laid without mortar with very tight joints that are sometimes hard to find. The blocks were held together by [[mortise and tenon]] joints in some cases, while in others they used dovetails and gravity. The blocks were presumably put in place by a combination of elephants, [[coir]] ropes, pulleys and [[bamboo scaffolding]]. Henri Mouhot noted that most of the blocks had holes {{convert|2.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter and {{convert|3|cm|in|abbr=on}} deep, with more holes on the larger blocks. Some scholars have suggested that these were used to join them together with iron rods, but others claim they were used to hold temporary pegs to help manoeuvre them into place.

The monument was made out of 5 million to 10 million sandstone blocks with a maximum weight of 1.5 tons each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/24440-angkor-wat-canals.html|title=Mystery of Angkor Wat Temple's Huge Stones Solved|date=31 October 2012|last=Ghose|first=Tia|work=livescience.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the entire city of [[Angkor]] used up far greater amounts of stone than all the Egyptian pyramids combined, and occupied an area significantly greater than modern-day [[Paris]]. Moreover, unlike the Egyptian pyramids which use limestone quarried barely {{convert|0.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} away all the time, the entire city of Angkor was built with sandstone quarried {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} (or more) away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://video.nationalgeographic.com/video/specials/ancient-mysteries/angkor-wat-temples/|title=Lost City of Angkor Wat|work=National Geographic}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This sandstone had to be transported from Mount Kulen, a quarry approximately {{convert|25|mi|km}} to the northeast. The route has been suggested to span {{convert|35|km|mi}} along a canal towards [[Tonlé Sap]] lake, another {{convert|35|km|mi}} crossing the lake, and finally {{convert|15|km|mi}} against the current along [[Siem Reap River]], making a total journey of {{convert|90|km|mi}}. However, Etsuo Uchida and Ichita Shimoda of [[Waseda University]] in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]] have discovered in 2011 a shorter {{convert|35|km|mi|adj=on}} canal connecting Mount Kulen and Angkor Wat using satellite imagery. The two believe that the Khmer used this route instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first = Etsuo | last = Uchida | first2 = Ichita | last2 = Shimoda | title = Quarries and transportation routes of Angkor monument sandstone blocks | journal = Journal of Archaeological Science | volume = 40 | issue = 2 | date = 2013 | doi = 10.1016/j.jas.2012.09.036 | issn = 0305-4403 | pages = 1158–1164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virtually all of its surfaces, columns, lintels and even roofs are carved. There are miles of reliefs illustrating scenes from [[Indian literature]] including unicorns, griffins, winged dragons pulling chariots as well as warriors following an elephant-mounted leader and celestial dancing girls with elaborate hair styles. The gallery wall alone is decorated with almost 1,000 square metres of bas reliefs. Holes on some of the Angkor walls indicate that they may have been decorated with bronze sheets. These were highly prized in ancient times and were a prime target for robbers. While excavating Khajuraho, Alex Evans, a stonemason and sculptor, recreated a stone sculpture under {{convert|4|ft|m}}, this took about 60 days to carve.&lt;ref&gt;"Lost Worlds of the Kama Sutra" History channel&lt;/ref&gt; Roger Hopkins and Mark Lehner also conducted experiments to quarry limestone which took 12 quarrymen 22 days to quarry about 400 tons of stone.&lt;ref&gt;Lehner, Mark  (1997). ''The Complete Pyramids'', London: Thames and Hudson, pp.&amp;nbsp;202–225 {{ISBN|0500050848}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The labour force to quarry, transport, carve and install so much sandstone must have run into the thousands including many highly skilled artisans. The skills required to carve these sculptures were developed hundreds of years earlier, as demonstrated by some artefacts that have been dated to the seventh century, before the Khmer came to power.&lt;ref name="Southeast Asia 1995 p. 67-99"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scarre p. 81-85"/&gt;

===Restoration and conservation===
[[File:WMF Angkor Wat.ogv|[[World Monuments Fund]] video on conservation of Angkor Wat|thumb]]
As with most other ancient temples in Cambodia, Angkor Wat has faced extensive damage and deterioration by a combination of plant overgrowth, fungi, ground movements, war damage and theft. The war damage to Angkor Wat's temples however has been very limited, compared to the rest of Cambodia's temple ruins, and it has also received the most attentive restoration.&lt;ref name="Angkor Battle"/&gt;

[[File:Bullet holes at angkor wat.jpg|thumb|left|Bullet holes left by a shoot-out between the Khmer Rouge and Vietnamese forces at Angkor Wat.]]

The restoration of Angkor Wat in the modern era began with the establishment of the Conservation d'Angkor (Angkor Conservancy) by the [[École française d'Extrême-Orient]] (EFEO) in 1908; before that date, activities at the site were primarily concerned with exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wmf.org/sites/default/files/wmf_publication/Considerations_for_the_Conservation_and_Preservation_of_the_Historic_City_of_Angkor_Report_I.pdf |title=Considerations for the Conservation and Presentation of the.

The main phase of work ended in 2012, with the final component being the installation of finials on the roof of the gallery in 2013.

Microbial biofilms have been found degrading sandstone at Angkor Wat, Preah Khan, and the Bayon and West Prasat in Angkor. The dehydration- and radiation-resistant filamentous cyanobacteria can produce organic acids that degrade the stone. A dark filamentous fungus was found in internal and external [[Preah Khan]] samples, while the alga ''[[Trentepohlia (alga)|Trentepohlia]]'' was found only in samples taken from external, pink-stained stone at Preah Khan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Microbial biofilms on the sandstone monuments of the Angkor Wat Complex, Cambodia|journal=Current Microbiology|date=Feb 2012|pages=85–92|volume=64|author1=Gaylarde CC|author2=Rodríguez CH|author3=Navarro-Noya YE|author4=Ortega-Morales BO|doi=10.1007/s00284-011-0034-y|pmid=22006074|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Replicas were also made to replace some of the lost or damaged sculptures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-19279491 |title=Restoring ancient monuments at Cambodia's Angkor Wat|author= Guy De Launey|date=21 August 2012 |work=BBC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tourism===

Since the 1990s, Angkor Wat has become a major tourist destination.  In 1993, there were only 7,650 visitors to the site;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/feb/25/travel.travelnews |title= Tourist invasion threatens to ruin glories of Angkor Wat |author=Justine Smith |date= 25 February 2007 |work=The Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt; by 2004, government figures show that 561,000 foreign visitors had arrived in Siem Reap province that year, approximately 50% of all foreign tourists in Cambodia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.tourismcambodia.com/Statistics/index.asp?Year=2005 |title=Executive Summary from Jan–Dec 2005 |accessdate=25 April 2008 |work=Tourism of Cambodia |publisher=Statistics &amp; Tourism Information Department, Ministry of Tourism of Cambodia| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080413115411/http://www.tourismcambodia.com/Statistics/index.asp?Year=2005| archivedate= 13 April 2008 | deadurl= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The number reached over a million in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tourismcambodia.org/images/mot/statistic_reports/tourism_statistics_annual_report_book_2007.pdf |title=Tourism Statistics: Annual Report |page=60 |work=Ministry of Tourism }}&lt;/ref&gt; and over two million by 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tourismcambodia.org/images/mot/statistic_reports/tourism_statistics_annual_report_2012.pdf |title=Tourism Annual Report 2012 |work=Ministry of Tourism }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most visited Angkor Wat, which received over two million foreign tourists in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.phnompenhpost.com/business/ticket-sales-angkor-wat-exceed-2-million |title=Ticket sales at Angkor Wat exceed 2 million |work=The Phnom Penh Post |date= 21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The site has been managed by the private [[Sokimex|SOKIMEX]] group since 1990, which rented it from the [[Cambodian government]]. The influx of tourists has so far caused relatively little damage, other than some [[graffiti]]; ropes and wooden steps have been introduced to protect the bas-reliefs and floors, respectively. Tourism has also provided some additional funds for maintenance—as of 2000 approximately 28% of ticket revenues across the whole [[Angkor]] site was spent on the temples—although most work is carried out by teams sponsored by foreign governments rather than by the Cambodian authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Tales of Asia, [http://www.talesofasia.com/cambodia-interviews-AC.htm Preserving Angkor: Interview with Ang Choulean (13 October 2000)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Angkor Wat has seen significant growth in tourism throughout the years, [[UNESCO]] and its International Co-ordinating Committee for the Safeguarding and Development of the Historic Site of Angkor (ICC), in association with representatives from the Royal Government and [[APSARA]], organised seminars to discuss the concept of "cultural tourism".&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.annals.2006.06.004|title=Rethinking tourism in asia|date=2007|last1=Winter|first1=Tim|journal=Annals of Tourism Research|volume=34|pages=27–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wanting to avoid commercial and mass tourism, the seminars emphasised the importance of providing high quality accommodation and services in order for the Cambodian government to benefit economically, while also incorporating the richness of Cambodian culture.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt; In 2001, this incentive resulted in the concept of the "Angkor Tourist City" which would be developed with regard to traditional Khmer architecture, contain leisure and tourist facilities, and provide luxurious hotels capable of accommodating large numbers of tourists.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt;

The prospect of developing such large tourist accommodations has encountered concerns from both APSARA and the ICC, claiming that previous tourism developments in the area have neglected construction regulations and more of these projects have the potential to damage landscape features.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt; Also, the large scale of these projects have begun to threaten the quality of the nearby town's water, sewage, and electricity systems.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt; It has been noted that such high frequency of tourism and growing demand for quality accommodations in the area, such as the development of a large highway, has had a direct effect on the underground water table, subsequently straining the structural stability of the temples at Angkor Wat.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt; Locals of Siem Reap have also voiced concern that the charm and atmosphere of their town have been compromised in order to entertain tourism.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt; Since this local atmosphere is the key component to projects like Angkor Tourist City, the local officials continue to discuss how to successfully incorporate future tourism without sacrificing local values and culture.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt;

At the [[ASEAN]] Tourism Forum 2012, it was agreed that [[Borobudur]] and Angkor Wat would become sister sites and the provinces sister provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/01/13/borobudur-angkor-wat-become-sister-sites.html |title=Borobudur, Angkor Wat to become sister sites |date=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[geography]], the word '''bank''' generally refers to the land alongside a body of water. Different structures are referred to as ''banks'' in different fields of geography, as follows.

In [[limnology]] (the study of inland waters), a stream bank or river bank is the terrain alongside the [[Stream bed|bed]] of a [[river]], creek, or [[stream]].&lt;ref name=Leopold1995&gt;{{cite book |isbn=978-0-486-68588-5 |author1=Luna B. Leopold |author2=M. Gordon Wolman |author3=John P. Miller |year=1995 |publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York|title=Fluvial processes in geomorphology}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bank consists of the sides of the [[channel (geography)|channel]], between which the [[streamflow|flow]] is confined.&lt;ref name=Leopold1995/&gt; Stream banks are of particular interest in [[fluvial]] geography, which studies the processes associated with rivers and streams and the [[Deposition (geology)|deposits]] and [[landform]]s created by them. Bankfull discharge is a [[Discharge (hydrology)|discharge]]  great enough to fill the channel and overtop the banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2009/5144/pdf/sir2009-5144_mulvihil_bankfull_2revised508.pdf|title=2 Bankfull Discharge and Channel Characteristics of Streams in New York State|last=Mulvihill|first=Christiane|date=|website=United States Geological Survey|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The descriptive terms ''left bank'' and ''right bank'' are relative to an observer looking [[current (stream)|downstream]], in which the right bank is to the observer's right; a famous example is the naming of the two sides of the [[Seine]] in [[Paris]]. The [[shore]]line of [[pond]]s, [[swamp]]s, [[estuary|estuaries]], [[reservoir]]s, or [[lake]]s are also of interest in limnology and are sometimes referred to as banks. The [[grade (slope)|grade]] of all these banks or shorelines can vary from vertical to a shallow slope.

In [[freshwater ecosystem|freshwater ecology]], banks are of interest as the location of riparian [[habitat]]s. [[Riparian zone]]s occur along [[upland and lowland]] river and stream beds. The ecology around and depending on a [[marsh]], [[swamp]], [[slough (hydrology)|slough]], or [[estuary]], sometimes called a bank, is likewise studied in freshwater ecology.

Banks are also of interest in [[navigation]], where the term can refer either to a [[barrier island]] or a submerged [[plateau]],&lt;ref name="Bucksch1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Herbert Bucksch|title=Dictionary Geotechnical Engineering: English German|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=te9FMHjOR4oC|year=1997|publisher=Springer DE|isbn=978-3-540-58164-2|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=te9FMHjOR4oC&amp;pg=PA47 47]}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as an [[ocean bank]]. A barrier island is a long narrow island composed of sand and forming a barrier between an island [[lagoon]] or [[sound (geography)|sound]] and the ocean. A submerged plateau is a relatively flat topped elevation of the sea floor at shallow depth (generally less than 200 m), typically on the [[continental shelf]] or near an [[island]].

'''Bularchus''' was an [[Ancient Greek]] painter; Pliny indicates that he was working in the 8th century BC, during the reign of [[Candaules]], King of [[Lydia]].&lt;ref name=bryan/&gt;

==Life==
Bularchus' '' Battle of the Magnesians'', is the earliest picture of which the ancient writers have left a description. The artist appears to have flourished in the late 8th century BC, as, according to [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], this picture was purchased for as much gold as would cover its surface by [[Candaules]], King of [[Lydia]], who died in about [[700 B.C.]]&lt;ref name=bryan/&gt;

After Bularchus we encounter a gap of upwards of two centuries and a half in the history of Greek painting. It appears, however, that it was practised on the island of [[Rhodes]], at the time of [[Anacreon]], who lived about 600 years before Christ. That poet, in his twenty-eighth and twenty-ninth [[Ode]]s, mentions the practice of  [[encaustic painting]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4708">'''CALERIE''' ('''Comprehensive Assessment of Long-term Effects of Reducing Intake of Energy''') is a trial currently underway in the U.S. to study the effects of prolonged [[calorie restriction]] on healthy human subjects. 

The CALERIE study is being carried out at the [[Pennington Biomedical Research Center]] (Baton Rouge, Louisiana), the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at [[Tufts University]] (Boston, Massachusetts) and the [[Washington University in St. Louis|Washington University]] School of Medicine (St. Louis, Missouri).&lt;ref&gt;[http://calerie.dcri.duke.edu/about/index.html About CALERIE], retrieved 12 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is hoped that caloric restriction reduces the incidence of [[cardiovascular disease]] and [[cancer]] and leads to a longer life, as has been demonstrated previously in numerous animal studies.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; CALERIE is the first study to investigate prolonged calorie restriction in healthy humans, which is practiced and advocated for by the members of the [[Calorie Restriction Society]]. Study subjects are selected from people who are not obese (because calorie restriction on obese people is already known to lengthen life, but possibly for different reasons).&lt;ref name=economist/&gt;

A smaller predecessor study ended in 2006. Forty-eight subjects were randomly assigned to a control group and a treatment group; those in the treatment group were put on a 25% calorie reduction over a 6-month period. It was found that the treatment group had lower [[insulin resistance]], lower levels of [[LDL cholesterol]], lower body temperature and blood-insulin levels as well as less oxidative damage to their DNA.&lt;ref name=economist&gt;[http://www.economist.com/sciencetechnology/displaystory.cfm?story_id=6823498 Eat less, live more], ''The Economist'', April 22, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The second, larger, phase of CALERIE began in 2007. The participants are subjected to a 25% calorie restriction over a 2-year period, and several physiological variables are regularly monitored. Participants are paid [[US$]]5,000 at Tufts and Pennington and $2,400 at Washington University. As of October 2009 the study had 132 participants and was still accepting new ones.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

Study subjects have to be highly motivated and organized enough to keep a detailed journal of all foods they eat. Their daily baseline calorie requirements are precisely determined before the trial: in a two-week laboratory test the rate of [[carbon dioxide]] production is measured, allowing to compute the number of burned calories. The subjects are then taught a diet of low-energy density foods, such as vegetables, fruits (especially apples), [[dietary fiber|insoluble fiber]] and soups. Most subjects reported that they felt hungry for the first few weeks, after which they adjusted to the new diet. Complaints focused on the rigid bookkeeping scheme imposed on them.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

That calorie restriction (CR) might lengthen human lifespan was suggested by various studies on laboratory animals. However, when the studies were extended to long-lived [[primates]] ([[rhesus monkeys]]), while it was indeed found in a 2012 study by the US [[National Institute on Aging]] (NIA) that CR had benefits to immune function, motor coordination, and resistance to sarcopenia, a CR regimen implemented in rhesus monkeys of various ages did not improve survival outcomes. The authors considered that the study suggested "a separation between health effects, morbidity and mortality", and that "study design, husbandry and diet composition may strongly affect the life-prolonging effect of CR in a long-lived non-human primate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mattison|first1=Julie A.|last2=Roth|first2=George S.|last3=Beasley|first3=T.

'''Cognitive ethology''' is a branch of [[ethology]] concerned with the influence of conscious awareness and intention on the behaviour of an animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Harber|title=Collins COBUILD Advanced Dictionary of English|year=2012|publisher=Higher Education Press|isbn=9787040327878}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donald Griffin]], a [[zoology]] professor in the United States, set up the foundations for researches in the cognitive awareness of animals within their habitats.&lt;ref&gt;Ristau, C, Erlbaum L, et al. (1991). Cognitive Ethology. "Biological Psychology",  32 (2-3): 220-222&lt;/ref&gt;

The fusion of [[cognitive science]] and classical [[ethology]] into cognitive ethology "emphasizes observing animals under more-or-less natural conditions, with the objective of understanding the evolution, adaptation (function), causation, and development of the species-specific [[behavioral repertoire]]" ([[Niko Tinbergen]] 1963).

According to Jamieson &amp; Bekoff (1993),&lt;ref&gt;: Dale Jamieson and Marc Bekoff
Source: Analysis, Vol. 52, No. 1 (Jan., 1992), pp. 23-28&lt;/ref&gt; "Tinbergen's four questions about the evolution, adaptation, causation and development of behavior can be applied to the cognitive and mental abilities of animals."  Allen &amp; Bekoff (1997, chapter 5)&lt;ref&gt;Dittrich, W.H. (1998) Book review of Allen &amp; Bekoff (1997) on Cognitive Ethology.&lt;/ref&gt; attempt to show how cognitive ethology can take on the central questions of cognitive science, taking as their starting point the four questions described by Barbara Von Eckardt in her 1993 book ''What is Cognitive Science?'', generalizing the four questions and adding a fifth. Kingstone, Smilek &amp; Eastwood (2008) suggested that cognitive ethology should include human behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Kingstone, A., Smilek, D. &amp; Eastwood, J. D., (2008) 'Cognitive Ethology: a new approach for studying human cognition'. British Journal of Psychology, 99, 317-340&lt;/ref&gt; They proposed that researchers should firstly study how people behave in their natural, real world environments and then move to the lab. Anthropocentric claims for the ways non-human animals interact in their social and non-social worlds are often used to influence decisions on how the non-human animals can or should be used by humans.&lt;ref&gt;Bekoff, M. (1994) "Cognitive ethology and the treatment of non-human animals: How matters of mind inform matters of welfare." Animal Welfare, Vol 3(2),75-96&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relation to laboratory experimental psychology ==
Traditionally, cognitive ethologists have questioned research methods that isolate animals in unnatural surroundings and present them with a limited set of artificial stimuli, arguing that such techniques favor the study of artificial issues that are not relevant to an understanding of the natural behavior of animals.  However, many modern researchers favor a judicious combination of field and laboratory methods.&lt;ref&gt;Shettleworth, S. J. (2010) ''Cognition, Evolution, and Behavior'' New York: Oxford&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relation to ethics ==
Bekoff, M and Allen, C (1997) "identify three major groups of people (among some of whose members there are blurred distinctions) with different views on cognitive ethology, namely, slayers, skeptics, and proponents." The latter seemingly convergent with [[animal rights]] thinking in seeing animal experience as worthy in itself.

[[Ethicist]] [[Peter Singer]] is an example of a "proponent" in this sense, as is biologist [[E. O. Wilson]] who coined the term [[biophilia hypothesis|biophilia]] to describe the basis of a direct [[moral cognition]], that 'higher' animals would use to perceive moral implications in the environment directly.

==Three views==
According to Marc Bekoff, there are three different views towards whether a science of cognitive ethology is even possible. Slayers deny any possibility of success in cognitive ethology, proponents keep an open mind about animal cognition and the utility of cognitive ethological investigation, and skeptics stand somewhere in between.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bekoff|first=Marc|title=Cognitive Ethology and the Explanation of Nonhuman Animal Behavior|journal=Comparative Approaches to Cognitive Science.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4057">The '''Collingridge dilemma''' is a methodological quandary in which efforts to influence&lt;!--/contribute to--&gt; or control the further development&lt;!--/impact/..--&gt; of technology face a [[double bind|double-bind problem]]:
* An information problem: impacts cannot be easily predicted until the technology is extensively developed and widely used.
* A [[Power (philosophy)|power]] problem: control or change is difficult when the technology has become entrenched.
The idea was coined by David Collingridge, The [[University of Aston]], Technology Policy Unit, in his 1980 book ''The Social Control of Technology''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Social Control of Technology'' (New York: St. Martin's Press; London: Pinter) {{ISBN|0-312-73168-X}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The dilemma is a basic point of reference in [[technology assessment]] debates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itas.fzk.de/tatup/092/boeh09a.htm Article] by K. Böhle in TATuP, September 2009, pp. 121-125 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

In "This Explains Everything," edited by [[John Brockman (literary agent)|John Brockman]], technology critic [[Evgeny Morozov]] explains Collingridge's idea by quoting Collingridge himself: "When change is easy, the need for it cannot be foreseen; when the need for change is apparent, change has become expensive, difficult, and time-consuming." &lt;ref&gt;"This Explains Everything" (Harper Perennial, 2013, p.255, {{ISBN|0062230174}})&lt;/ref&gt;

In "The Pacing Problem, the Collingridge Dilemma &amp; [[Technological Determinism]]" by [[Adam Thierer]], a senior research fellow at the [[Mercatus Center]] at [[George Mason University]], the Collingridge dilemma is related to the "pacing problem" in technology regulation. The "pacing problem" refers to the notion that technological innovation is increasingly outpacing the ability of laws and regulations to keep up, first explained in [[Larry Downes]]' 2009 book ''[[The Laws of Disruption]]'', in which he famously states that "technology changes exponentially, but social, economic, and legal systems change incrementally". In Thierer's essay, he tries to correlate these two concepts by saying that "the 'Collingridge dilemma' is simply a restatement of the pacing problem but with greater stress on the social drivers behind the pacing problem and an implicit solution to 'the problem' in the form of preemptive control of new technologies while they are still young and more manageable."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techliberation.com/2018/08/16/the-pacing-problem-the-collingridge-dilemma-technological-determinism/|title=The Pacing Problem, the Collingridge Dilemma &amp; Technological Determinism|date=2018-08-16|work=Technology Liberation Front|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A widely-adopted solution to Collingridge dilemma is the "[[Precautionary principle|Precautionary Principle]]", the belief that new innovations should not be embraced "until their developers can prove that they will not cause any harm to individuals, groups, specific entities, cultural norms, or various existing laws, norms, or traditions".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; If they fail to do so, this innovation should be "prohibited, curtailed, modified, junked, or ignored". &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=What technology wants|last=Kelly|first=Kevin|publisher=Viking Press|year=2010|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach received criticisms from technology critics like [[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kevin Kelly]] who believe the contour of such principle is ill-defined&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and such principle is biased against anything new because it drastically elevates threshold for anything innovative. According to American philosopher [[Max More]], the Precautionary Principle "is very good for one thing—stopping technological progress...not because it leads in bad directions, but because it leads in no direction at all."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4368">In [[quantum information science]], the concurrence is a state invariant involving qubits.

==Definition==
The '''concurrence''' is an [[entanglement monotone]] defined for a mixed state of two [[qubit]]s as:&lt;ref name="Hill1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wootters1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hildebrand2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Horodecki2009"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C}(\rho)\equiv\max(0,\lambda_1-\lambda_2-\lambda_3-\lambda_4) &lt;/math&gt;

in which &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1,...,\lambda_4&lt;/math&gt; are the eigenvalues, in decreasing order, of the Hermitian matrix

:&lt;math&gt;R = \sqrt{\sqrt{\rho}\tilde{\rho}\sqrt{\rho}} &lt;/math&gt;

with

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{\rho} = (\sigma_{y}\otimes\sigma_{y})\rho^{*}(\sigma_{y}\otimes\sigma_{y})&lt;/math&gt;
the spin-flipped state of &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sigma_y&lt;/math&gt; a [[Pauli spin matrix]], and the eigenvalues listed in decreasing order.

A generalized version of concurrence for multiparticle pure states in arbitrary dimensions is defined as:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rungta|first=Pranaw|date=2001-01-01|title=Universal state inversion and concurrence in arbitrary dimensions|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevA.64.042315|journal=Physical Review A|volume=64|issue=4|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.64.042315|arxiv=quant-ph/0102040|bibcode=2001PhRvA..64d2315R}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bhaskara|first=Vineeth S.|last2=Panigrahi|first2=Prasanta K.|date=2017-05-01|title=Generalized concurrence measure for faithful quantification of multiparticle pure state entanglement using Lagrange’s identity and wedge product|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11128-017-1568-0|journal=Quantum Information Processing|language=en|volume=16|issue=5|pages=118|doi=10.1007/s11128-017-1568-0|issn=1570-0755|arxiv=1607.00164|bibcode=2017QuIP...16..118B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{M}}(\rho)=\sqrt{2(1-\text{Tr}\rho^2_{\mathcal{M}})} &lt;/math&gt;

in which &lt;math&gt; \rho_{\mathcal{M}} &lt;/math&gt; is the reduced density matrix across the bipartition &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{M} &lt;/math&gt; of the pure state, and it measures how much the complex amplitudes deviate from the constraints required for tensor separability. The faithful nature of the measure admits necessary and sufficient conditions of separability for pure states.

==Other formulations==
Alternatively, the &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{i}&lt;/math&gt;'s represent the square roots of the eigenvalues of the non-Hermitian matrix &lt;math&gt;\rho\tilde{\rho}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Wootters1998"/&gt; Note that each &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{i}&lt;/math&gt; is a non-negative real number.  From the concurrence, the [[entanglement of formation]] can be calculated.
==Properties==

For pure states, the concurrence is a polynomial &lt;math&gt;SL(2,\mathbb{C})^{\otimes 2}&lt;/math&gt; invariant in the state's coefficients.&lt;ref name="Djocovic2009"/&gt; For mixed states, the concurrence can be defined by [[convex roof extension]].&lt;ref name="Hildebrand2007"/&gt;

For the concurrence, there is monogamy of entanglement,&lt;ref name="Coffman2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Osborne2006"/&gt; that is, the concurrence of a qubit with the rest of the system cannot ever exceed the sum of the concurrences of qubit pairs which it is part of.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15899">'''Deficit irrigation''' ('''DI''') is a watering strategy that can be applied by different types of [[irrigation]] application methods. The correct application of DI requires thorough understanding of the yield response to water (crop sensitivity to drought stress) and of the economic impact of reductions in harvest.&lt;ref&gt;English, M., (1990). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9437(1990)116:3(399) Deficit Irrigation. I: Analytical Framework.] ''J. Irrig. Drain. E.-ASCE'' 116, 399-412.&lt;/ref&gt; In regions where [[water resources]] are restrictive it can be more profitable for a farmer to maximize [[#Crop water productivity|crop water productivity]] instead of maximizing the harvest per unit land.&lt;ref&gt;Fereres, E., Soriano, M.A., (2007).[http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/58/2/147 Deficit irrigation for reducing agricultural water use] ''J. Exp. Bot. 58, 147-158''&lt;/ref&gt; The saved water can be used for other purposes or to irrigate extra units of land.&lt;ref&gt;Kipkorir, E.C., Raes, D., Labadie, J., (2001). Optimal allocation of short-term irrigation supply. ''Irrig. Drain. Syst.'' 15, 247-267.&lt;/ref&gt;
DI is sometimes referred to as incomplete supplemental irrigation or regulated DI.

== Definition ==

Deficit irrigation (DI) has been reviewed and defined as follows:

&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"&gt;Geerts, S., Raes, D., (2009). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2009.04.009 Deficit irrigation as an on-farm strategy to maximize crop water productivity in dry areas.] ''Agric. Water Manage'' 96, 1275-1284&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Deficit irrigation is an [[Process optimization|optimization]] strategy in which irrigation is applied during drought-sensitive growth stages of a crop. Outside these periods, irrigation is limited or even unnecessary if rainfall provides a minimum supply of water. Water restriction is limited to drought-tolerant [[phenology|phenological]] stages, often the vegetative stages and the late ripening period. Total irrigation application is therefore not proportional to irrigation requirements throughout the crop cycle. While this inevitably results in plant [[drought]] stress and consequently in production loss, DI maximizes irrigation water productivity, which is the main limiting factor (English, 1990). In other words, DI aims at stabilizing yields and at obtaining maximum [[#Crop water productivity|crop water productivity]] rather than maximum yields (Zhang and Oweis, 1999)."''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Crop water productivity==
Crop water productivity (WP) or water use efficiency (WUE)&lt;ref&gt;Kijne, J.W., Barker, R., Molden, D., (2003). Improving water productivity in agriculture: editor's overview. In: Kijne, J.W., Barker, R.M.D. (eds.), [http://www.cabi.org/bk_BookDisplay.asp?SubjectArea=&amp;Subject=&amp;PID=1626 ''Water productivity in agriculture: limits and opportunities for improvement.] '' International Water Management Institute, Colombo, Sri Lanka, p. xi-xix.&lt;/ref&gt; expressed in kg/m³ is an [[Economic efficiency|efficiency]] term, expressing the amount of marketable product (e.g. kilograms of grain) in relation to the amount of input needed to produce that output (cubic meters of water). The water used for crop production is referred to as crop [[evapotranspiration]]. This is a combination of water lost by [[evaporation]] from the soil surface and [[transpiration]] by the plant, occurring simultaneously. Except by [[#Modeling|modeling]], distinguishing between the two processes is difficult. Representative values of WUE for cereals at field level, expressed with evapotranspiration in the denominator, can vary between 0.10 and 4&amp;nbsp;kg/m3.&lt;ref&gt;Zwart, S.J., Bastiaanssen, W.G.M., (2004). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2004.04.007 Review of measured crop water productivity values for irrigated wheat, rice, cotton and maize.] ''Agric. Water Manage'' 69, 115-133.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experiences with deficit irrigation==
For certain crops, experiments confirm that DI can increase water use efficiency without severe yield reductions. For example for winter wheat in Turkey, planned DI increased yields by 65% as compared to winter wheat under rainfed cultivation, and had double the water use efficiency as compared to rainfed and fully irrigated winter wheat.&lt;ref&gt;Ilbeyi, A., Ustun, H., Oweis, T., Pala, M., Benli, B., (2006). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2005.08.005 Wheat water productivity and yield in a cool highland environment: Effect of early sowing with supplemental irrigation.] ''Agric. Water Manage'' 82, 399-410.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar positive results have been described for cotton.&lt;ref&gt;Raes, D., Geerts, S., Vandersypen, K., (2008). More Food, Less Water. In: Raymaekers, B. (ed.), ''Lectures for the XXIst century. '' Leuven University Press, Leuven, Belgium, p. 81-101.&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments in Turkey and India indicated that the irrigation water use for cotton could be reduced to up to 60 percent of the total crop water requirement with limited yield losses. In this way, high water productivity and a better nutrient-water balance was obtained.

Certain [[Underutilized crops|Underutilized]] and [[horticultural]] crops also respond favorably to DI, such as tested at experimental and farmer level for the crop [[quinoa]].&lt;ref&gt;Geerts, S., Raes, D., Garcia, M., Vacher, J., Mamani, R., Mendoza, J., Huanca, R., Morales, B., Miranda, R., Cusicanqui, J., Taboada, C., (2008). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2007.11.008 Introducing deficit irrigation to stabilize yields of quinoa (''Chenopodium quinoa'' Willd. ').] ''Eur. J. Agron. '' 28, 427-436.&lt;/ref&gt; Yields could be stabilized at around 1.6 tons per hectare by supplementing irrigation water if rainwater was lacking during the plant establishment and reproductive stages. Applying irrigation water throughout the whole season (full irrigation) reduced the water productivity. Also in [[viticulture]] and fruit tree cultivation, DI is practiced.&lt;ref&gt;Spreer, W., Ongprasert, S., Hegele, M., Wünnsche, J. N., Müller, J. (2009). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2008.09.020  Yield and fruit development in mango (''Mangifera indica'' L. cv. Chok Anan) under different irrigation regimes.] ''Agric.

Scientists affiliated with the [[Agricultural Research Service]] (ARS) of the [[USDA]] found that conserving water by forcing drought (or deficit irrigation) on peanut plants early in the growing season has shown to cause early maturation of the plant yet still maintain sufficient yield of the crop. [http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/pr/2010/100114.htm]  Inducing drought through deficit irrigation earlier in the season caused the peanut plants to physiologically "learn" how to adapt to a stressful drought environment, making the plants better able to cope with drought that commonly occurs later in the growing season.  Deficit irrigation is beneficial for the farmers because it reduces the cost of water and prevents a loss of crop yield (for certain crops) later on in the growing season due to drought.  In addition to these findings, ARS scientists suggest that deficit irrigation accompanied with [[conservation tillage]] would greatly reduce the peanut crop water requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

For other crops, the application of deficit irrigation will result in a lower water use efficiency and yield. This is the case when crops are sensitive to drought stress throughout the complete season, such as [[maize]].&lt;ref&gt;Pandey, R.K., Maranville, J.W., Admou, A., (2000). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0378-3774(00)00073-1  Deficit irrigation and nitrogen effects on maize in a Sahelian environment. I. Grain yield and yield components.] ''Agric. Water Manage.'' 46, 1-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from university research groups and farmers associations, international organizations such as [[FAO]], [[ICARDA]], [[IWMI]] and the [[CGIAR]] Challenge Program on Water and Food are studying DI.

==Reasons for increased water productivity under deficit irrigation==
If crops have certain phenological phases in which they are tolerant to water stress, DI can increase the ratio of yield over crop water consumption ([[evapotranspiration]])&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org" /&gt; by either reducing the water loss by unproductive [[evaporation]], and/or by
increasing the proportion of marketable yield to the totally produced biomass (harvest index), and/or by increasing the proportion of total [[biomass]] production to [[transpiration]] due to hardening of the crop - although this effect is very limited due to the conservative relation between biomass production and crop transpiration,&lt;ref&gt;Steduto, P., Hsiao, T. C., Fereres, E., (2007) [https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00271-007-0064-1 On the conservative behavior of biomass water productivity.] ''Irrig. Sci. '' 25, 189-207.&lt;/ref&gt; - and/or due to adequate [[fertilizer]] application&lt;ref&gt;Steduto, P., Albrizio, R., (2005). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2005.04.003 Resource use efficiency of field-grown sunflower, sorghum, wheat and chickpea. II. Water use efficiency and comparison with radiation use efficiency.] ''Agric. Forest Meteorol. '' 130, 269-281.&lt;/ref&gt; and/or by avoiding bad agronomic conditions during crop growth, such as water logging in the root zone, [[pest (organism)|pests]] and [[diseases]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;Pereira, L.S., Oweis, T., Zairi, A., (2002). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0378-3774(02)00075-6 Irrigation management under water scarcity.] ''Agric. Water Manage'' 57, 175-206.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==
The correct application of DI for a certain crop:
* maximizes the productivity of water, generally with adequate harvest quality;
* allows economic planning and stable income due to a stabilization of the harvest in comparison with rainfed cultivation;
* decreases the risk of certain diseases linked to high humidity (e.g. [[fungi]]) in comparison with full irrigation;
* reduces nutrient loss by [[Leaching (agriculture)|leaching]] of the root zone, which results in better [[groundwater]] quality&lt;ref&gt;Ünlü, M., Kanber, R., Senyigit, U., Onaran, H., Diker, K., (2006). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2005.02.004 Trickle and sprinkler irrigation of potato (''Solanum tuberosum'' L.) in the middle Anatolian region in Turkey.] ''Agric. Water Manage'' 79, 43-71.&lt;/ref&gt; and lower [[fertilizer]] needs as for cultivation under full irrigation;&lt;ref&gt;Pandey, R.K., Maranville, J.W., Chetima, M.M., (2000). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0378-3774(00)00074-3 Deficit irrigation and nitrogen effects on maize in a Sahelian environment.] II. Shoot growth, nitrogen uptake and water extraction. ''Agric. Water Manage'' 46, 15-27.&lt;/ref&gt;
* improves control over the sowing date and length of the growing period&lt;ref&gt;Geerts, S., Raes, D., Garcia, M., Mendoza, J., Huanca, R., (2008). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2008.04.008 Indicators to quantify the flexible phenology of quinoa (''Chenopodium quinoa Willd. '') in response to drought stress.] ''Field Crop. Res.'' 108, 150-156.&lt;/ref&gt; independent from the onset of the rainy season and therefore improves agricultural planning.

==Constraints==
A number of constraints apply to deficit irrigation:
* Exact knowledge of the crop response to water stress is imperative.&lt;ref&gt;Hsiao, T.C., (1973). Plant Responses to Water Stress. ''Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. '' 24, 519-570.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kirda, C., (2002). Deficit irrigation scheduling based on plant growth stages showing water stress tolerance. In: Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO) (ed.), [http://www.fao.org/docrep/004/Y3655E/y3655e00.htm ''Deficit irrigation practices'']. Rome, Italy, p. 3-10.&lt;/ref&gt;
* There should be sufficient flexibility in access to water during periods of high demand (drought sensitive stages of a crop).&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, H., (2003). Improving water productivity through deficit irrigation: examples from Syria, the North China Plain and Oregon, USA. In: Kijne, J.W., Barker, R., Molden, D. (eds.), [http://www.cabi.org/bk_BookDisplay.asp?SubjectArea=&amp;Subject=&amp;PID=1626 ''Water productivity in agriculture: limits and opportunities for improvement.''] International Water Management Institute, Colombo, Sri Lanka, p. 301-309.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A minimum quantity of water should be guaranteed for the crop, below which DI has no significant beneficial effect.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, H., Oweis, T., (1999). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0378-3774(98)00069-9 Water-yield relations and optimal irrigation scheduling of wheat in the Mediterranean region.] ''Agric. Water Manage'' 38, 195-211.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kang, S., Zhang, L., Liang, Y., Hu, X., Cai, H., Gu, B., (2002). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0378-3774(01)00180-9 Effects of limited irrigation on yield and water use efficiency of winter wheat in the Loess Plateau of China.] ''Agric. Water Manage'' 55, 203-216.&lt;/ref&gt;
* An individual farmer should consider the benefit for the total water users community (extra land can be irrigated with the saved water), when he faces a below-maximum yield;
* Because irrigation is applied more efficiently, the risk for [[soil salinization]] is higher under DI as compared to full irrigation.&lt;ref&gt;Geerts, S., Raes, D., Garcia, M., Condori, O., Mamani, J., Miranda, R., Cusicanqui, J., Taboada, C., Vacher, J., (2008). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2008.02.012 Could deficit irrigation be a sustainable practice for quinoa (''Chenopodium quinoa'' Willd.) in the Southern Bolivian Altiplano?] ''Agric. Water Manage'' 95, 909-917.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modeling==
Field experimentation is necessary for correct application of DI for a particular crop in a particular region. In addition, simulation of the soil [[water balance]] and related crop growth (crop water productivity modeling) can be a valuable [[decision support]] tool.&lt;ref&gt;Raes, D., Steduto, P., Hsiao, T. C., Fereres, E. (2009) [https://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2008.0140s AquaCrop--The FAO Crop Model to Simulate Yield Response to Water: II. Main Algorithms and Software Description.] ''Agron. J. '' 101, 438-447.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steduto, P, Hsiao, T. C., Raes, D., Fereres, E. (2009). [https://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2008.0139s AquaCrop--The FAO Crop Model to Simulate Yield Response to Water: I. Concepts and Underlying Principles.] ''Agron. J. '' 101, 426-437.&lt;/ref&gt; By conjunctively simulating the effects of different influencing factors ([[climate]], [[soil]], management, crop characteristics) on crop production, models allow to (1) better understand the mechanism behind improved water use efficiency, to (2) schedule the necessary irrigation applications during the [[drought]] sensitive crop growth stages, considering the possible variability in climate, to (3) test DI strategies of specific crops in new regions, and to (4) investigate the effects of future climate scenarios or scenarios of altered management practices on crop production.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5092">'''Digital self-defense''' is the use of [[self-defense]] strategies by [[Internet]] users to ensure [[digital security]]; that is to say, the protection of confidential [[personal electronic information]].&lt;ref&gt;“Components of Security”, http://nms.csail.mit.edu/~snoeren/stp307/ppt/sld002.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Internet security]] software provides initial protection by setting up a [[firewall (computing)|firewall]], as well as scanning computers for [[malware]], [[viruses]], [[Trojan horses]], [[computer worm|worms]] and [[spyware]].  However information at most risk includes personal details such as [[birthdate]]s, [[phone number]]s, [[bank account]] and [[schooling]] details, [[sexual orientation|sexuality]], [[religious affiliation]]s, [[email address]]es and [[password]]s.  This information is often openly revealed in [[social networking]] sites leaving Internet users vulnerable to [[social engineering (security)|social engineering]] and possibly [[Internet crime]]. Mobile devices, especially those with [[Wi-Fi]], allow this information to be shared inadvertently.&lt;ref&gt;“Protect yourself in the online, social network community”,  Creston News Advertiser, 11 Feb 2011. http://www.crestonnewsadvertiser.com/articles/ara/2011/02/11/8044960708/index.xml&lt;/ref&gt;

Digital self-defense requires Internet users to take an active part in guarding their own personal information. Four key strategies are frequently suggested to assist that protection.

==Computer security==
Computer security in this context is referring to [[Internet security]] software. The ongoing security of private information requires frequent updating of virus and spyware definitions so that ongoing developments in malicious software cannot interfere with, or copy, private information.&lt;ref&gt;"Secure your computer", © Commonwealth of Australia 2010 and © Stay Smart Online. http://www.staysmartonline.gov.au/home_internet_users/secure_your_computer&lt;/ref&gt;

==Email Accounts and Usernames==

===Choice of Appropriate Email Account===
The practice of utilising more than one [[email]] account to separate personal and business usage from recreational usage is a strategy commonly used to manage personal privacy. The free and ready availability of email accounts from sites such as [[Yahoo]], [[Google]] or [[Hotmail]] allows the protection of personal identity through the use of different names to identify each email account. These [[throw-away account]]s can be discarded or replaced at will, providing another level of protection.

===Choice of Username===
A [[username]] is required to set up email accounts and to open accounts for various official, commercial, recreational and social networking sites.  In many cases, an email address may also be utilised as a username. Usernames that correlate with personal information such as names or nicknames are more at risk than ones that are cryptic or anonymous, particularly on social and recreational sites.

==Password Strength==
A [[password]] is a mandatory security measure that accompanies usernames. The use of personal data to construct passwords i.e. family members’ names, pet’s names or birth dates increases the risk to confidential information and are easier to crack than long complicated passwords so [[password strength]] is a key strategy for protecting personal information. A password can be weak or strong:a weak password is ''cutekittens'', a strong password is ''?lACpAs56IKMs''.

According to [[Microsoft]] an ideal password should be at least 14 characters in length and have letters, punctuation, symbols, and numbers, where complexity is added by the inclusion of uppercase letters.&lt;ref&gt;"Create Strong Passwords", Microsoft Safety and Security Center. {{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/security/online-privacy/passwords-create.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110214012154/http://www.microsoft.com/security/online-privacy/passwords-create.aspx |archivedate=2011-02-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Managing Personal Information Using Privacy Options==
[[Social networking]] sites offer greater security risks to personal electronic information because sensitive, private or confidential information such as [[personal identifier]]s are routinely used to create public profiles.&lt;ref&gt;"Safer Social Networking". © Commonwealth of Australia 2010.http://www.cybersmart.gov.au/Parents/Brochures%20and%20posters%20and%20contacts/Cybersmart%20contacts.aspx#Information&lt;/ref&gt; Many websites give options to suppress the amount of personal information revealed through the customisation of privacy settings. However privacy settings can reset if changes to the website occur.&lt;ref&gt;“Protect yourself in the online, social network community”,  Creston News Advertiser, 11 Feb 2011. http://www.crestonnewsadvertiser.com/articles/ara/2011/02/11/8044960708/index.xml&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Earth System Governance Project'''&lt;ref name="Biermann2009"&gt;[http://earthsystemgovernance.org/sites/default/files/publications/files/Earth-System-Governance_Science-Plan.pdf] Biermann, Frank, Michele M. Betsill, Joyeeta Gupta, Norichika Kanie, Louis Lebel, [[Diana Liverman]], Heike Schroeder, and Bernd Siebenhüner, with contributions from Ken Conca, Leila da Costa Ferreira, Bharat Desai, Simon Tay, and Ruben Zondervan. 2009. ''Earth System Governance: People, Places and the Planet. Science and Implementation Plan of the Earth System Governance Project''. Earth System Governance Report 1, IHDP Report 20. Bonn, IHDP: The Earth System Governance Project.&lt;/ref&gt; is a long-term, interdisciplinary social science research programme originally developed under the auspices of the [[International Human Dimensions Programme|International Human Dimensions Programme on Global Environmental Change]].&lt;ref name="IHDP"&gt;[http://www.ihdp.unu.edu/publications/?id=325] IHDP Annual Report 2009&lt;/ref&gt; It started in January 2009.

The Earth System Governance Project currently consists of a network of ca. 300 active and about 2,300 indirectly involved scholars from all continents. The project has evolved into the largest social science research network in the area of governance and global environmental change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=9446496&amp;jid=JPS&amp;volumeId=-1&amp;issueId=-1&amp;aid=9446492] John Dryzek. 2014. Institutions for the Anthropocene: Governance in a Changing Earth System. ''British Journal of Political Science''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Earth System Governance Project Office is hosted at Lund University, Sweden.

== Aims ==
The Earth System Governance Project aims to contribute to science on the large, complex challenges of governance in an era of rapid and large-scale environmental change. The project seeks to create a better understanding of the role of institutions, organizations and governance mechanisms by which humans regulate their relationship with the natural environment.&lt;ref name="Biermann2009"/&gt; The Earth System Governance Project aims to integrate governance research at all levels. The project aims to examine problems of the ‘global commons’, but also local problems from [[air pollution]] to the preservation of waters, [[waste treatment]] or [[desertification]] and [[soil degradation]]. However, due to natural interdependencies local environmental pollution can be transformed into changes of the global system that affect other localities. Therefore, the Earth System Governance Project looks at institutions and governance processes both local and globally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.futureearth.org/blog/2013-jul-15/what-earth-system-governance] What is Earth System Governance?&lt;/ref&gt;

The Earth System Governance Project is a scientific effort, but also aims to assist policy responses to the pressing problems of earth system transformation &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebrokeronline.eu/Articles/Managing-global-change/Earth-System-Governance-Project/] The Broker Online&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.cri.cn/6966/2011/05/19/1461s638279.htm] Nobel Laureates Hand in Recommendations to UN Panel on Global Sustainability&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conceptual framework ==
{{Main|Earth system governance}}
The Earth System Governance Project organizes its research according to a conceptual framework guided by five analytical problems. These are the problems of the overall ''architecture'' of earth system governance, of ''agency'' beyond the state and of the state, of the ''adaptiveness'' of governance mechanisms and processes, of their ''accountability'' and legitimacy and of modes of ''allocation and access'' in earth system governance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agci.vu.nl/en/Images/Biermann%20et%20al%20%202010%20INEA%20ESG%20Research%20Framework_tcm143-191335.pdf] Frank Biermann, Michele M. Betsill, Joyeeta Gupta, Norichika Kanie, Louis Lebel, Diana Liverman, Heike Schroeder, Bernd Siebenhüner and Ruben Zondervan. 2010. Earth system governance: a research framework. ''International Environmental Agreements: Politics, Law, and Economics''. Vol 10. Nr 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''concept of Earth System Governance''' is defined as: 
&lt;blockquote&gt; ''... the interrelated and increasingly integrated system of formal and informal rules, rule-making systems, and actor-networks at all levels of human society (from local to global) that are set up to steer societies towards preventing, mitigating, and adapting to global and local environmental change and, in particular, earth system transformation, within the normative context of sustainable development''.&lt;ref name="Biermann2009"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Origin and history ==
In 2001, the four then active global change research programmes [[Diversitas|(DIVERSITAS]], [[International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme]], [[World Climate Research Programme]], and [[International Human Dimensions Programme|International Human Dimensions Programme on Global Environmental Change]]) agreed to intensify co-operation through setting up an overarching [[Earth System Science Partnership]]. The research communities represented in this Partnership contend in the 2001 Amsterdam Declaration on Global Change&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.essp.org/index.php?id=41] The Amsterdam Declaration on Global Change&lt;/ref&gt; that the earth system now operates ‘well outside the normal state exhibited over the past 500,000 years’ and that ‘human activity is generating change that extends well beyond natural variability—in some cases, alarmingly so— and at rates that continue to accelerate.’ To cope with this challenge, the four global change research programmes have called ‘urgently’ for strategies for Earth System management’.&lt;ref name="Biermann2009"/&gt;

In March 2007, in response to the 2001 Amsterdam Declaration, the Scientific Committee of the International Human Dimensions Programme on Global Environmental Change (IHDP), the overarching social science programme in the field, mandated the drafting of the Science Plan of the Earth System Governance Project by a newly appointed Scientific Planning Committee. The Earth System Governance Project builds on the results of an earlier long-term research programme, the IHDP core project Institutional Dimensions of Global Environmental Change (IDGEC).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Dsj1rkoH3scC&amp;pg=PA235&amp;lpg=PA235&amp;dq=HDP+core+project+Institutional+Dimensions+of+Global+Environmental+Change+earth+system+governance+project&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NXxIhAHHT2&amp;sig=uHwEdIOQzkkkMQdI7e-kmI0b4Mw&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zr-TVdXiLYq5UYWNrBA&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=HDP%20core%20project%20Institutional%20Dimensions%20of%20Global%20Environmental%20Change%20earth%20system%20governance%20project&amp;f=false] Peijun Shi, Carlo Jaeger, Qian Ye (editors). 2012. ''Integrated Risk Governance: Science Plan and Case Studies of Large-scale Disasters''. Heidelberg: Springer Science &amp; Business Media.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthsystemgovernance.org/publication/young-oran--institutions-and-environmental-change] Young, Oran., Heike Schroeder and Leslie A. King (editors). 2008. ''Institutions and Environmental Change: Principal Findings, Applications, and Research Frontiers''. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the Earth System Governance Project was officially launched.  

In 2009, the Science and Implementation Plan of the Earth System Governance Project was published.&lt;ref name="Biermann2009"/&gt; In the science and implementation plan, the conceptual problems, cross-cutting themes, flagship projects, and its policy relevance are outlined in detail. The Science Plan was written by an international, interdisciplinary Scientific Planning Committee chaired by Prof. Frank Biermann, which drew on a consultative process that started in 2004. Several working drafts of this Science Plan have been presented and discussed at a series of international events and conferences, and numerous scholars in the field, as well as practitioners, have offered suggestions, advice, and critique.&lt;ref name="IHDP"/&gt;

Since then, the project has evolved into a broader research alliance that builds on an international network of research centers, lead faculty and research fellows. After the termination of the IHDP in 2014, the activities of the Earth System Governance research alliance are supported by an international steering group of representatives of the main Earth System Governance Research Centres and the global group of lead faculty and research fellows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthsystemgovernance.org/people/lead-faculty Earth System Governance Project: Lead Faculty. Website accessed 1 July 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global research network ==
For its activities and implementation, the Earth System Governance Project relies on a global network of experts from different academic and cultural backgrounds. The research network consists of different groups of scientific experts. The Earth System Governance Project operates under the direction of a ''Scientific Steering Group'' chaired by Frank Biermann. The role of the Scientific Steering Committee is to guide the implementation of the Earth System Governance Science Plan. The ''Lead Faculty'' of the Earth System Governance Project is a group of individual scientists who take over (shared) responsibility for the development of research on particular analytical problems. ''Earth System Governance Fellows'' are scientists who link their own research projects with the broader themes and questions raised by the Earth System Governance Science and Implementation Plan.

An important element in the project organisation is the global alliance of research centres that brings together the [[VU University Amsterdam]]; the [[Australian National University]]; [[Chiang Mai University]]; [[Colorado State University]]; [[Lund University]]; [[University of East Anglia]]; [[University of Oldenburg]]; the [[Stockholm Resilience Centre]]; the [[University of Toronto]]; the [[Tokyo Institute of Technology]] and [[Yale University]]. In addition, strong networks on earth system governance research exist in China, Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe, and Russia.

The network of researchers affiliated with the Earth System Governance Project has brought out many reports and books, and has published in journals such as International Environmental Agreements: Politics, Law and Economics;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = International Environmental Agreements: Politics, Law and Economics – incl. option to publish open access|url = https://www.springer.com/law/environmental/journal/10784|website = springer.com|accessdate = 2015-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecological Economics;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ecological Economics {{!}} 0921-8009 {{!}} Elsevier|url = http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/503305/description|website = www.elsevier.com|accessdate = 2015-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Global Environmental Change;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Global Environmental Change {{!}} 0959-3780 {{!}} Elsevier|url = http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/30425/description|website = www.elsevier.com|accessdate = 2015-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental Science &amp; Policy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Environmental Science &amp; Policy {{!}} 1462-9011 {{!}} Elsevier|url = http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/601264/description|website = www.elsevier.com|accessdate = 2015-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Global Environmental Politics and Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability - ScienceDirect.com|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/18773435|website = www.sciencedirect.com|accessdate = 2015-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recurring research topics of the Earth System Governance Project are water governance, climate governance and fragmentation of global environmental governance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthsystemgovernance.org/publications Earth System Governance Project: Publications. Website accessed 23 July 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt;

A related MIT Press Book series is designed to address the research challenge of earth system governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ESG / MIT Press book series {{!}} Earth System Governance|url = http://earthsystemgovernance.org/esg%20and%20mit%20press%20book%20series|website = earthsystemgovernance.org|accessdate = 2015-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the Project publishes regular Working Papers, which are peer-reviewed online publications that broadly address questions raised by the Project’s Science and Implementation Plan.

Several special issues of topics related to earth system governance have been published in scientific journals over the last years.

==  Education programmes ==
Earth system governance as a research object is quickly emerging, and as a consequence, the number of education programmes on bachelor, master and doctoral level related to earth system governance steadily increases. A number of institutes and universities currently collaborate in a Global Alliance of Earth System Governance Research Centres, including:&lt;ref&gt;[http://earthsystemgovernance.org/teaching Earth System Governance Project: Teaching. Website accessed 29 April 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Ecosystems, Resilience and Governance, University of Stockholm and Stockholm Resilience Centre, Sweden
* Environmental Studies and Sustainability Science, LUMES, International Master’s Programme, Lund University, Sweden
* Environment and Resource Management, VU University Amsterdam, The Netherlands
* Global Environmental Governance, Specialization track in MSc Political Science, VU University Amsterdam, The Netherlands
* Lund University Centre of Excellence for Integration of Social and Natural Dimensions of Sustainability, LUCID, Research School, Lund University, Sweden
* Sustainability Economics and Management, MSc Programme, University of Oldenburg, Germany
* Environmental Governance related Programmes, MA, MSc, and PhD Programmes, Colorado State University, United States of America
* Environment and Development Programmes, MSc, MRes, and MBA Programmes, University of East Anglia, United Kingdom

A substantial number of the workshops and other events of the project are capacity-building activities. The project also organizes, endorses and provides teaching to summer schools and capacity building events and programs. In addition, members of the Scientific Steering Group and staff of the International Project Office give guest lectures around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://earthsystemgovernance.org/teaching Earth System Governance Project: Teaching. Website accessed 2 July 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Task forces ==
The Earth System Governance Project organizes Task Forces, international networks of senior and early career scholars with a series of working groups focused on particular ideas or idea clusters. There are currently two active Task Forces:

* Task Force on Conceptual Foundations of Earth System Governance&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthsystemgovernance.net/conceptual-foundations/ website Task Force on Conceptual Foundations of Earth System Governance]&lt;/ref&gt;
This Task Force aims to explore key concepts with regard to Earth System Governance, such as planetary boundaries, green economy, resilience and the Anthropocene. It aims to critically examine and further refine these novel governance ideas. 

* Task Force on Methodology for Earth System Governance Research&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbl.nl/en/news/newsitems/2013/methodology-for-earth-system-governance-research PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency]&lt;/ref&gt;
This Task Force seeks aims to advance quantitative earth system governance research by promoting new international research collaborations, fostering interaction and dialogue among existing research projects, and developing architectures to promote the building and sharing of datasets.

== Policy influence ==
In 2011, the Earth System Governance Project launched an initiative on International Environmental Governance. This initiative aims to provide a forum for discussion of current and ongoing research on international environmental governance and the institutional framework for sustainable development, in the period leading up to the [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development|2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development]] in Rio de Janeiro, also known as ‘Rio + 20’. In addition, the initiative aims to target decision-makers and to contribute not just to a better understanding but also to actual improvements in international environmental governance towards an institutional framework that enables sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessinitiative.org/blog/2011/07/guest-blog-post-earth-system-governance-initiative-international-environmental-governan The Access Initiative, Guest Blog Post: Earth System Governance Initiative on International Environmental Governance]&lt;/ref&gt;

== context ==
There is widespread support for the Earth System Governance Project in the scientific community, which is reflected in the size of the research network and in various publications by experts. &lt;ref&gt;[http://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu/admin/publication_files/resource-2585-2007.32.pdf.] Myanna Lahsen. 2007. Earth System Governance: Research in Aid of Global Environmental Sustainability. ''Global Change NewsLetter No. 70''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=WIzFBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA210&amp;lpg=PA210&amp;dq=interesting+earth+system+governance+project&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=klDVNzhn8u&amp;sig=zIOwy73tahadMZ5OwQOooWa-QnI&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAjhGahUKEwjgpM7a4qrHAhUFPBoKHVuIC10#v=onepage&amp;q=interesting%20earth%20system%20governance%20project&amp;f=false] Michael Manton and Linda Anne Stevenson. 2013. Climate in Asia and the Pacific: Security, Society and Sustainability. ''Springer Science &amp; Business Media''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, criticisms of the Earth System Governance Project have also been made. 

In an internal report of the International Human Dimensions Programme it is stated that the steering group of the Earth System Governance Project is too much dominated by experts from OECD countries. Since then, the Earth System Governance Project has actively sought ways to involve experts from different regions of the world. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ihdp.unu.edu/docs/Publications/ESG/ESG%20SSC-1_Minutes-clean.pdf] 1st Earth System Governance Scientific Steering Committee Meeting&lt;/ref&gt; 

The idea of earth system governance has also been criticized for being too top-down, for placing too much emphasis on global governance structures. According to Mike Hulme, earth system governance represents an attempt to ‘geopolitically engineer’ our way out of the climate crisis. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/30139401?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents] Mike Hulme. 2008. The Conquering of Climate: Discourses of Fear and Their Dissolution. ''The Geographical Journal''. Vol. 174, No. 1&lt;/ref&gt; He questions whether the climate is governable and argues that it is way too optimistic and even hubristic to attempt to control the global climate by universal governance regimes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mikehulme.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/2008-hulme-governing-and-adapting.pdf] Mike Hulme. 2008. Governing and adapting to climate.

''Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers''.&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation of the novel concept, however, has been rejected by other scholars as being too narrow and misleading &lt;ref&gt;Frank Biermann. 2014.

==Terminology==
[[File:Apollo15LunarRover.jpg|thumb|[[NASA]]'s [[Lunar Roving Vehicle]]s were battery-driven]]

Electric cars are a variety of [[electric vehicle]] (EV). The term "electric vehicle" refers to any vehicle that uses electric motors for propulsion, while "electric car" generally refers to highway-capable [[automobiles]] powered by electricity. [[Low-speed vehicle|Low-speed]] electric vehicles, classified as [[neighborhood electric vehicle]]s (NEVs) in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/cars/rules/rulings/lsv/lsv.html|title=US DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 49 CFR Part 571 Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards |accessdate=2009-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as electric [[motorised quadricycle]]s in Europe,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/sectors/automotive/files/cit-sum-com-542_en.pdfCitizens' summary EU proposal for a Regulation on L-category vehicles (two- or three-wheel vehicles and quadricycles)]{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; are plug-in electric-powered [[microcar]]s or [[city car]]s with limitations in terms of weight, power and maximum speed that are allowed to travel on public roads and city streets up to a certain posted speed limit, which varies by country.

While an electric car's power source is not explicitly an on-board battery, electric cars with motors powered by other energy sources are typically referred to by a different name. An electric car carrying [[solar panel]]s to power it is a [[solar car]], and an electric car powered by a gasoline generator is a form of [[hybrid car]]. Thus, an electric car that derives its power from an on-board battery pack is a form of [[battery electric vehicle]] (BEV). Most often, the term "electric car" is used to refer to [[battery electric vehicles]], but may also refer to [[plug-in hybrid electric vehicles]] (PHEV).

In 1897, electric cars found their first commercial use in the US. Based on the design of the [[Electrobat|Electrobat II]], a fleet of twelve hansom cabs and one brougham were used in New York City as part of a project funded in part by the Electric Storage Battery Company of Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edisontechcenter.org/ElectricCars.html |title=History of Electric Cars |first=Galen |last=Handy |publisher=The Edison Tech Center |location=US |year=2014 |access-date=2017-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 20th century, the main manufacturers of electric vehicles in the US were Anthony Electric, Baker, Columbia, Anderson, Edison, Riker, Milburn, [[S.R. Bailey &amp; Co.|Bailey Electric]] and others. Unlike gasoline-powered vehicles, the electric ones were less noisy, and did not require gear changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.automobilesreview.com/auto-news/some-facts-about-electric-vehicles/42240/ |title=Some Facts About Electric Vehicles |date=2012-02-25 |access-date=2017-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=June 2018}}

Advances in [[internal combustion engine]]s (ICE) in the first decade of the 20th century lessened the relative advantages of the electric car. Their much quicker refueling times, and cheaper production costs, made them more popular. However, a decisive moment was the introduction in 1912 of the electric [[Starter (engine)|starter motor]] which replaced other, often laborious, methods of starting the ICE, such as [[Crank (mechanism)#20th Century|hand-cranking]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Six electric cars held the [[land speed record]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.macscouter.com/CubScouts/PowWow07/SCCC_2007/CubScoutThemes/Jan_2008.pdf|date=January 2008|title=Cub Scout Car Show|accessdate=2009-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last of them was the rocket-shaped [[La Jamais Contente]], driven by [[Camille Jenatzy]], which broke the {{convert|100|km/h|abbr=on}} speed barrier by reaching a top speed of {{convert|105.88|km/h|abbr=on}} on 29 April 1899.

In the early 1990s, the [[California Air Resources Board]] (CARB) began a push for more fuel-efficient, lower-emissions vehicles, with the ultimate goal being a move to [[zero-emissions vehicle]]s such as electric vehicles.&lt;ref name=TwoBillion&gt;{{cite book |last=Sperling |first=Daniel |first2=Deborah |last2=Gordon |title = Two billion cars: driving toward sustainability |year=2009| pages=22–26 |publisher=Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-537664-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Boschert06&gt;{{cite book |first=Sherry |last=Boschert |title=Plug-in Hybrids: The Cars that will Recharge America |year=2006 |pages=15–28 |publisher=New Society Publishers| isbn=978-0-86571-571-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, automakers developed electric models, including the [[Chrysler TEVan]], [[Ford Ranger EV]] pickup truck, [[GM EV1]], and [[Chevrolet S10 EV|S10 EV]] pickup, [[Honda EV Plus]] hatchback, Nissan [[Nissan Altra|Altra EV]] miniwagon, and [[Toyota RAV4 EV]]. Both US Electricar and [[Solectria Force|Solectria]] produced 3-phase AC Geo-bodied electric cars with the support of GM, Hughes, and Delco.

Electric motors can provide high [[power-to-weight ratio]]s, batteries can be designed to supply the currents needed to support these motors. Electric motors have flat torque curve down to zero speed. For simplicity and reliability, many electric cars use fixed-ratio gearboxes and have no clutch.

Many electric cars have motors that have high acceleration, relative to comparable cars, however, [[Neighborhood Electric Vehicle]]s may have a low acceleration due to their relatively weak motors. This is largely due to the relatively constant torque of an electric motor, which often increase the acceleration relative to a similar [[horsepower|motor power]] internal combustion engine.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Electric vehicles can also use a direct motor-to-wheel configuration which increases the available [[power (physics)|power]].

==Energy efficiency==
{{main|Electric car energy efficiency}}

[[Internal combustion engine]]s have [[Carnot's theorem (thermodynamics)|thermodynamic limits]] on efficiency, expressed as fraction of energy used to propel the vehicle compared to energy produced by burning fuel. [[Gasoline engine]]s effectively use only 15% of the fuel energy content to move the vehicle or to power accessories, and [[diesel engine]]s can reach on-board efficiency of 20%, while electric vehicles have on-board efficiency of over 90%, when counted against stored chemical energy, or around 80%, when counted against required energy to recharge.&lt;ref name=PEVs2&gt;{{Cite book|title=Plug-In Electric Vehicles: What Role for Washington?|first=Saurin D. |last=Shah|year=2009 |publisher=The Brookings Institution|isbn=978-0-8157-0305-1 |edition=1st |chapter=2|pages=29, 37 and 43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Electric motor]]s are more efficient than internal combustion engines in converting stored energy into driving a vehicle. Electric cars can not idle. [[Regenerative braking]], which is most common in electric vehicles, can recover as much as one fifth of the energy normally lost during braking.&lt;ref name=TwoBillion/&gt;&lt;ref name=PEVs2/&gt;

Tesla Motors indicates that the vehicle efficiency (including charging inefficiencies) of their [[lithium-ion battery]] powered vehicle is 12.7&amp;nbsp;kW·h/100&amp;nbsp;km (0.21&amp;nbsp;kW·h/mi) and the well-to-wheels efficiency (if the electricity is generated from natural gas) is 24.4&amp;nbsp;kW·h/100&amp;nbsp;km (0.39&amp;nbsp;kW·h/mi).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teslamotors.com/goelectric/efficiency |publisher=Tesla Motors |title=Energy Efficiency of Tesla Electric Vehicles |accessdate=2009-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cabin heating and cooling===
While heating can be provided with an electric resistance heater, higher efficiency and integral cooling can be obtained with a reversible [[heat pump]]. [[Temperature coefficient#Positive temperature coefficient of resistance|PTC junction cooling]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |country-code=US |series-number=5889260 |title=Electrical PTC heating device |publication-date=30 March 1999 |editor1-last=Golan|editor1-first=Gad |editor2-last=Galperin|editor2-first=Yuly }}&lt;/ref&gt; is also attractive for its simplicity&amp;nbsp;— this kind of system is used, for example, in the [[Tesla Roadster (2008)]].

To avoid using part of the battery's energy for heating and thus reducing the range, some models allow the cabin to be heated while the car is plugged in. For example, the Nissan Leaf, the Mitsubishi i-MiEV and the Tesla Model S can be pre-heated while the vehicle is plugged in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=NativeEnergy |url=https://www.recyclebank.com/live-green/3-electric-car-myths-that-will-leave-you-out-in-the-cold |title=3 Electric Car Myths That Will Leave You Out in the Cold |publisher=Recyclebank |date=2012-09-07 |accessdate=2013-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ed |last=Piotrowski |url=http://cgdailydrive.com/how-i-survived-the-cold-weather/ |title=How i Survived the Cold Weather |publisher=The Daily Drive – Consumer Guide Automotive |date=2013-01-03 |accessdate=2013-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teslarati.com/effects-winter-tesla-battery-range/|title= Effects of Winter on Tesla Battery Range and Regen|work=teslarati.com|date=2014-11-24|accessdate=2015-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some electric cars, for example the [[Citroën Berlingo Electrique]], use an auxiliary heating system (for example [[gasoline]]-fueled units manufactured by Webasto or Eberspächer) but sacrifice "green" and "Zero emissions" credentials. Cabin cooling can be augmented with [[solar power]], or by automatically allowing outside air to flow through the car when parked. Two models of the 2010 Toyota Prius include this feature as an option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toyota.com/prius-hybrid/options.html |title=2010 Options and Packages |work=Toyota Prius |publisher=Toyota |accessdate=2009-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety==
[[File:V10084P006.jpg|thumb|Side impact test of a [[Tesla Model X]]]]

The safety issues of BEVs are largely dealt with by the international standard [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 6469. This document is divided in three parts dealing with specific issues:

* On-board electrical energy storage, i.e. the battery
* Functional safety means and protection against failures
* Protection of persons against electrical hazards.

In the United States, General Motors ran in several cities a training program for [[firefighter]]s and [[certified first responder|first responders]] to demonstrate how to safely disable the [[Chevrolet Volt]]’s powertrain and its 12 volt electrical system. The Volt's high-voltage system is designed to shut down automatically in the event of an airbag deployment, and to detect a loss of communication from an airbag control module.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://media.gm.com/content/media/us/en/gm/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2011/Jan/0118_NFPA|title=Detroit First Responders Get Electric Vehicle Safety Training |author=General Motors|work=General Motors News|date=2011-01-19|accessdate=2011-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2010/08/gmfr-20100827.html|title= General Motors Kicks Off National Electric Vehicle Training Tour For First Responders|publisher=Green Car Congress |date=2010-08-27|accessdate=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; GM also made available an Emergency Response Guide for the 2011 Volt for use by emergency responders.

===Vehicle safety===
The weight of the batteries themselves usually makes an EV heavier than a comparable gasoline vehicle, in a collision, the occupants of a heavy vehicle will on average, suffer fewer and less serious injuries than the occupants of a lighter vehicle; therefore, the additional weight brings safety benefits&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=National Research Council|author2=Transportation Research Board|author3=Division on Engineering and Physical Sciences|author4=Board on Energy and Environmental Systems|author5=Committee on the Effectiveness and Impact of Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) Standards|title=Effectiveness and Impact of Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) Standards|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yRybeDbz8R8C&amp;pg=PA71|year=2002|publisher=National Academies Press|isbn=978-0-309-07601-2|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite having a negative effect on the car's performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mehrdad Ehsani|author2=Yimin Gao|author3=Sebastien E.

===Hazard to pedestrians===
{{See also|Electric vehicle warning sounds}}
At low speeds, electric cars produced less [[roadway noise]] than vehicles propelled by internal combustion engines. Blind or [[visual impairment|visually impaired]] people consider the noise of combustion engines a helpful aid while crossing streets, hence electric cars and [[hybrid vehicle|hybrids]] could pose an unexpected hazard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/2007-10-03-2698183585_x.htm|title=Blind people: Hybrid cars pose hazard|publisher=[[USA Today]]|first=Ben|last=Nuckols |date=2007-03-03 |accessdate=2009-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Economist0509"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13606446|title=Electric cars and noise: The sound of silence|publisher=Economist|date=2009-05-07|accessdate=2009-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tests have shown that this is a valid concern, as vehicles operating in electric mode can be particularly hard to hear below {{convert|20|mph|-1|abbr=on}}, which affects all road users, not just the visually impaired. At higher speeds, the sound created by tire friction and the air displaced by the vehicle start to make sufficient audible noise.&lt;ref name="Economist0509"/&gt;

The [[Government of Japan]], the [[U.S. Congress]], and the [[European Parliament]] passed legislation to regulate the minimum level of sound for hybrids and [[plug-in electric vehicle]]s when operating in electric mode, so that blind people and other pedestrians and cyclists can hear them coming and detect from which direction they are approaching.&lt;ref name="Economist0509"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://detnews.com/article/20110104/AUTO01/101040430/Obama-signs-law-to-require-%E2%80%98quiet%E2%80%99-cars-to-get-noisier|title=Obama signs law to require 'quiet' cars to get noisier|work=[[The Detroit News]]|author=David Shepardson|date=2011-01-04|accessdate=2011-01-05}}{{dead link|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TMC0810&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.toyota.co.jp/en/news/10/08/0824.html|title=TMC to Sell Approaching Vehicle Audible System for 'Prius'|publisher=[[Toyota Motor Company]] News Release|date=2010-08-24|accessdate=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-14-363_en.htm|title=Commission welcomes Parliament vote on decreasing vehicle noise |author=European Commission Press Release|publisher=[[European Commission]]|date=2014-04-02|accessdate=2014-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nissan Leaf]] was the first electric car to use Nissan's [[Vehicle Sound for Pedestrians]] system, which includes one sound for forward motion and another for reverse.&lt;ref name=NYT0610B&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/17/blind-advocates-disappointed-in-nissan-e-v-sounds-for-pedestrians/?ref=automobiles|title=Blind Advocates ‘Disappointed’ in Nissan E.V.

Several anti-noise and electric car advocates have opposed the introduction of artificial sounds as warning for pedestrians, as such an introduction is based on vehicle type and not actual noise level, a concern regarding ICE vehicles which themselves are becoming quieter.

==Controls==
{{As of|2018}}, most Electric cars have similar driving controls to that of a car with a conventional [[automatic transmission]]. Even though the motor may be permanently connected to the wheels through a fixed-ratio gear and no [[parking pawl]] may be present the modes "P" and "N" are often still provided on the selector. In this case the motor is disabled in "N" and an electrically actuated [[hand brake]] provides the "P" mode.

In some cars the motor will spin slowly to provide a small amount of creep in "D", similar to a traditional automatic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autocar.co.uk/CarReviews/FirstDrives/Ford-Focus-BeV/245743/ |title=Ford Focus BEV – Road test |publisher=Autocar.co.uk |date=|accessdate=2011-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the foot is lifted from the accelerator of an [[internal combustion engine|ICE]], [[engine braking]] causes the car to slow. An EV would coast under these conditions, if it wasn't for [[Regenerative brake|regenerative braking]] which instead provides a more familiar response and recharges the battery to an extent. These features also reduce the use of the conventional brakes, significantly reducing wear and tear and maintenance costs as well as improving vehicle range.

==Batteries==
[[File:NASA Lithium Ion Polymer Battery.jpg|thumb|Prototypes of 50 watt-hour/kilogram [[lithium-ion polymer battery]]. Newer lithium-ion cells can provide up to 130&amp;nbsp;W·h/kg and last through thousands of charging cycles]]
{{Main|Electric vehicle battery}}
Lithium-based batteries are often chosen for their high power and energy density, although may wear out over a long period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/gadgets/how-to/a7432/why-your-gadgets-batteries-degrade-over-time-6705747/|title=Why Your Gadgets' Batteries Degrade|date=2012-04-25|work=Popular Mechanics|access-date=2018-09-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are many [[Electric battery#Solid state batteries|emergring technologies]] trying to combat this issue.

There are also other battery types, such as [[Nickel metal hydride battery|Nickel metal hydride (NiMH)]] batteries which have a poorer power to weight ratio than lithium ion, but are cheaper. Several other battery chemistries are in development such as [[zinc-air battery]] which could be much lighter.

Electric cars are typically charged overnight from a charging station installed in the owner's house, or from faster charging stations found in businesses and public areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2018/01/25/electric-vehicle-car-charging/1059349001/|title=Thinking of buying an electric vehicle? Here's what you need to know about charging|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-05-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An overnight charge of 8 hours will only give about a 40 mile charge with a standard 120 volt outlet whereas a 240 volt outlet would give around 180 miles in the same amount of time. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ucsusa.org/clean-vehicles/electric-vehicles/car-charging-time-type-cost#.XACNxGhKiUl|title=Electric Vehicle Charging: Types, Time, Cost and Savings|last=|first=|date=March 9, 2018|work=Union of Concerned Scientists|access-date=2018-11-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within each major region of the world, electric car charging stations are essentially universal across car and charger brands, and simply plugging in a charger into an electric car will charge the car at the fastest rate that car and charger can support.  A notable exception are the [[Tesla Motors|Tesla]] line of cars and charging stations, which use their own proprietary chargers. However, this can be solved by using a converter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.autoblog.com/2017/01/19/diginow-super-charger-v2-tesla-ev/|title=Diginow Super Charger V2 opens up Tesla destination chargers to other EVs|work=Autoblog|access-date=2018-09-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some companies have been experimenting with [[battery swapping]] to eliminate delay while charging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.machinedesign.com/automotive/could-battery-swapping-ease-range-anxiety-ev-owners|title=Could Battery Swapping Ease Range Anxiety for EV Owners?|date=2016-07-19|work=Machine Design|access-date=2018-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Tesla charging station with solar collector trimmed.jpeg|thumb|Panoramic view of [[Tesla supercharger]] rapid charging station in [[Tejon, California|Tejon Ranch, California]] ]]

====Hybrid vehicles====
{{Further|Hybrid vehicle}}[[File:2018 BMW i3 facelift (1).jpg|thumb|The [[BMW i3]] has an optional gasoline-powered [[Range-extended vehicle|range extender]] engine]]

Some electric vehicles have built in generators, these are considered a type of [[hybrid vehicle]].

===Lifespan===
{{Main|rechargeable battery#Lifespan and cycle stability}}

As with all lithium-ion batteries, electric vehicle batteries may degrade over long periods of time, especially if they are frequently overcharged, however, this may take at least several years before being noticeable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://phys.org/news/2013-04-life-lithium-ion-batteries-electric.html|title=Understanding the life of lithium ion batteries in electric vehicles|access-date=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Nissan stated in 2015 that thus far only 0.01 percent of batteries had to be replaced because of failures or problems, and then only because of externally inflicted damage. The vehicles that had already covered more than {{convert|200,000|km|0|abbr=on}}, have no problems with the battery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/mobilitaet/2015-04/elektroauto-batterie-akku-tesla-s/seite-2 „zeit.de: Batterie-Upgrade? Unwahrscheinlich!“]; retrieved, 22 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Extraction ===
Over half of the world's cobalt, a key element in lithium-ion batteries, is mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo where the children are forced to mine the cobalt while having little to no protection. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/child-labor-still-rife-in-democratic-republic-of-congo/a-39194724|title=Child labor still rife in Democratic Republic of Congo|last=Cascais|first=Antonio|date=November 6, 2017|website=DW.COM|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future===

;Autonomous park-and-charge

Volkswagen, in collaboration with six partners, is developing an EU research project that is focused on automating the parking and charging of electric vehicles. The objective of this project is to develop a smart car system that allows for autonomous driving in designated areas (e.g. valet parking, park and ride) and can offer advanced driver support in urban environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ori.ox.ac.uk/older-projects/vcharge/|title=VCharge|work=Oxford Robotics Institute|access-date=2018-03-06|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla has shown interest in making an arm that automatically charges their vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2015/08/06/teslas-prehensile-car-charger-plugs-itself-in-automatically/|title=Tesla's prehensile car charger plugs itself in automatically|work=Engadget|access-date=2018-05-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Other methods of energy storage
Experimental [[electric double-layer capacitor|supercapacitor]]s and [[flywheel energy storage]] devices offer comparable storage capacity, faster charging, and lower volatility. They have the potential to overtake batteries as the preferred rechargeable storage for EVs.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://discovermagazine.com/1996/aug/reinventingthewh842

;Solar cars
{{Main|Solar vehicle}}

Solar cars are electric vehicles powered completely or significantly by direct [[solar energy]], usually, through [[photovoltaic]] (PV) cells contained in [[solar panel]]s that convert the sun's energy directly into electric energy, usually used to charge a battery.

==Infrastructure==

===Charging station===

[[File:Eletroposto6.jpg|thumb|Charging station at [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]]. This station is run by [[Petrobras]] and uses [[solar energy]]]]
{{Main|charging station}}

[[Battery electric vehicle|Battery Electric Vehicles]] are most commonly charged from the [[power grid]] overnight at the owner's house, provided they have their own charging station. The electricity on the grid is in turn generated from a variety of sources; such as [[Fossil fuel power plant|coal]], [[hydroelectricity]], [[nuclear power|nuclear]] and others. Power sources such as [[photovoltaic]] solar cell panels, [[micro hydro]] or [[wind power|wind]] may also be used and are promoted because of concerns regarding [[global warming]].

Charging stations can have a variety of different speeds of charging, with slower charging being more common for houses, and more powerful charging stations on public roads and areas for trips.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity_infrastructure.html|title=Alternative Fuels Data Center: Developing Infrastructure to Charge Plug-In Electric Vehicles|website=www.afdc.energy.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[BMW i3]] can charge 0–80% of the battery in under 30 minutes in rapid charging mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Charging time for the BMW i3 |url=http://www.bmw.co.uk/en/new-vehicles/bmw-i/i3/2013/charging.html |publisher=BMW |location=UK |accessdate=2013-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921015553/http://www.bmw.co.uk/en/new-vehicles/bmw-i/i3/2013/charging.html |archivedate=2013-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The superchargers developed by Tesla Motors provided up to 130&amp;nbsp;kW of charging, allowing a 300-mile charge in about an hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cars.com/articles/2013/11/how-quickly-does-the-tesla-model-s-battery-charge/|title=How Quickly does the tesla model S battery charge?|last=Popely|first=Rick|date=November 9, 2013|website=Cars.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Connectors====
Most electric cars have used [[conductive coupling]] to supply electricity for recharging after the [[California Air Resources Board]] settled on the [[SAE J1772]]-2001 standard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arb.ca.gov/regact/charger/uid.pdf |title=Rulemaking:  2001-06-26 Updated and Informative Digest ZEV Infrastructure and Standardization |date=2002-05-13 |work=title 13, California Code of Regulations |publisher=California Air Resources Board |accessdate=2010-05-23|quote=Standardization of Charging Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the charging interface for electric vehicles in California in June 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=ARB Amends ZEV Rule: Standardizes Chargers &amp; Addresses Automaker Mergers |url=http://www.arb.ca.gov/newsrel/nr062801.htm |publisher=California Air Resources Board |date=2001-06-28 |accessdate=2010-05-23| quote=the ARB approved the staff proposal to select the conductive charging system used by Ford, Honda and several other manufacturers}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, the [[European Automobile Manufacturers Association|ACEA]] has decided to use the Type 2 connector from the range of [[IEC 62196#Plug types|IEC_62196 plug types]] for conductive charging of electric vehicles in the European Union, as the Type 1 connector (SAE J1772-2009) does not provide for three-phase charging.&lt;ref name="acea2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acea.be/images/uploads/files/20100630_Standardisation_e-vehicles.pdf |title=ACEA position and recommendations for the standardization of the charging of electrically chargeable vehicles |publisher=ACEA Brussels |date=2010-06-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706132407/http://www.acea.be/images/uploads/files/20100630_Standardisation_e-vehicles.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vehicle-to-grid: uploading and grid buffering===
{{Main|vehicle-to-grid}}

During [[peak load]] periods, when the cost of generation can be very high, electric vehicles could contribute energy to the grid.  These vehicles can then be recharged during [[off-peak]] hours at cheaper rates while helping to absorb excess night time generation. Here the batteries in the vehicles serve as a distributed storage system to buffer power.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

'''Exoteric''' refers to knowledge that is outside, and independent from, a person's experience and can be ascertained by anyone (related to [[common sense]]). The word is derived from the comparative form of [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἔξω ''eksô'', "from, out of, outside". It signifies anything which is public, without limits, or [[universalism|universal]]. It is distinguished from internal [[esoteric]] knowledge. "Exoteric" relates to external reality as opposed to a person's thoughts or feelings. It is knowledge that is public as opposed to [[secret]] or [[cabal]]istic.  It is not required that exoteric knowledge come easily or automatically, but it should be referenceable or reproducible.

== Philosophical context ==
Most philosophical and religious belief systems presume that reality must be independent of what an individual makes of it. However, even before the days of [[Plato]], a prominent alternate [[theory of knowledge]] insisted that the perceived outside reality is merely an internal fabrication of the observer and that it has no existence or substance outside the imagination of the observer. The Buddha's statement: "All that we are arises with our thoughts"  ([[Dhammapada]] 1.1) is reminiscent of this.

In his book entitled ''[[The Book of Five Rings]]'', the Japanese swordsmaster [[Miyamoto Musashi]] noted that when he teaches people martial arts, "since [he] generally makes them learn such things as have actual relevance to addressing [deeper principles], there is no such thing as a distinction between the esoteric and the exoteric." &lt;ref&gt;Miyamoto Musashi. ''The Book of Five Rings.'' Translated by Thomas Cleary. Shambhala Library. Boston &amp; London. 2003. p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious context ==
In the same way as the term "esoteric" is often associated with [[esotericism|esoteric spirituality]], the term "exoteric" is mostly used in discussions of religion and spirituality, as when the teachings shift the believer's focus away from an exploration of the inner self and towards an adherence to rules, laws, and an individual God.

The term "exoteric" may also reflect the notion of a divine identity that is outside of, and different from, human identity, whereas the esoteric notion claims that the divine is to be discovered ''within'' the human identity. Going one step further, the pantheistic notion suggests that the divine and the material world are one and the same.

==Government==
The exoteric form of government is one where all actions taken by the government must be both publicly disclosed and ratified by the public. This is often referred to as [[transparency (humanities)|transparency]] of governance.

==Societies==
Many societies are divided into 2 sections—the ''exoteric'' or "public face" and the ''esoteric'' or "behind closed doors". Such are many [[fraternal organization]]s, such as [[Freemasonry]], which are at some level accessible to the uninitiated but which have higher and higher levels of initiation as one progresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cavron|first1=John T. Mathews,|title=The True Freemasonry: Exoteric and Esoteric|url=http://www.masonicworld.com/education/articles/THE-TRUE-FREEMASONRY-EXOTERIC-AND-ESOTERIC.htm|website=www.masonicworld.com|accessdate=3 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Faculty of Translation and Interpreting''' (FTI) is a faculty of the [[University of Geneva]] in Switzerland.

== Introduction ==
[[File:UniMail-batiment-claire.jpg|thumb|The FTI is located on the sixth floor of the University of Geneva’s Uni Mail building.]]

The Faculty of Translation and Interpreting (FTI) is one of the oldest translation and interpreting education and research institutions in the world.&lt;ref name="Stelling-Michaud1959"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Claude-Namy1973"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stelling-Michaud1975"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DHStrad"/&gt; It was founded in 1941, by Antoine Velleman, as the Ecole d’interprètes de Genève (EIG).&lt;ref name="Stelling-Michaud1959" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaiser2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gaiba-Francesca1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vanHoof-Henri1991" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Millan-Carmen1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaiser2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Velleman-Antoine1943" /&gt; When a translation degree was introduced in 1972,&lt;ref name="Namy-Claude1973-5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Louis-Truffaut1991"/&gt; it became the École de traduction et d’interprétation (School of Translation and Interpreting - ETI), before adopting its current title – Faculty of Translation and Interpreting – in 2011.

{{Quote|text="Mr. Velleman was more than qualified to set up and direct the school, which he predicted would expand rapidly as Switzerland prepared itself for post-war recovery. Furthermore, Geneva, with its tradition of international collaboration, offered plenty of advantages to successfully bring about such a project. Before the Second World War, only one other school of its kind existed – a school that was founded in 1930 in Mannheim by Swiss professor Dr. Charles Glauser and was attached to the University of Heidelberg in 1936."|author=S. Stelling-Michaud|title=L’École d’interprètes de 1941 à 1956.&lt;ref name="Stelling-Michaud1959" /&gt;}}

Initially a part of the Faculty of Humanities, the EIG broke away from the Faculty between 1953-1955, and eventually became an independent institution of the [[University of Geneva|university]].&lt;ref name="Geisendorf"/&gt;{{sfn|Martin|1958|p=296}} Today, the FTI has over a hundred teachers and researchers.&lt;ref name="Corps-academique2015"/&gt;

== Location ==
Up until 1946, the school’s administrative offices were located in Antoine Velleman’s office at 5 Avenue Marc-Monnier,{{sfn|Capel Esteve|Chazal|2010}} then in an apartment at 4 Rue Saint-Victor. Three rooms and the hallway were used for the school, while three other rooms were reserved for administrative purposes.&lt;ref name="Stelling-Michaud318"/&gt; From 1952–1953, the University was renovated and the school’s administrative offices were set up on the former premises of the physics institute (ground floor).&lt;ref name="Stelling-Michaud318"/&gt; In 1978, the school moved to the Cours Commerciaux de Genève building at 19 Place des Augustins. It then moved to the new Uni Mail building at 40 Boulevard du Pont-d'Arve in 1992.{{sfn|Capel Esteve|Chazal|2010}}

== Resources and services ==
Students have access to [[IT]] and audiovisual resources, as well as a library specialized in [[translation studies]], [[translation]] (theory, history, education, etc.), [[language interpretation|consecutive and simultaneous interpreting]], [[sign language]] interpreting, [[computational linguistics]], [[terminology]] and [[lexicology]].

=== Library ===
The FTI library is located on the second floor of Uni-Mail. Students can consult and take out books on subjects taught at the FTI, specialized and language dictionaries, and journals.{{sfn|Duret|1998a|p=4}} Since 1984, the library has been a part of [[RERO (Réseau romand)|RERO]], a network of libraries in Western Switzerland.{{sfn|Duret|1998b|p=34}} It uses the [[Dewey Decimal Classification|Dewey Decimal System]].{{sfn|Duret|1998a|p=4}}

The first FTI library was made up of Antoine Velleman’s own personal collection of works, which he kept in his office on Avenue Marc-Monnier and would lend out to students.

{{Quote|text="Antoine Velleman made his library available to the first students, who – with much emotion – recall learning things from dictionaries, books and journals annotated in Velleman’s own hand. For years, there was no one there in that room… We had the key to the library (several of us were almost always gathered around the table), no one monitored us. And I don’t think many of those books disappeared…"|author=Gérard Ilg|title=cited in Duret.{{sfn|Duret|1998b|pp=11-12}}}}

In 1953, a room in the basement of the Bastions building on Rue de Candolle was converted into a library.{{sfn|Duret|1998b|p=21}}{{sfn|Duret|1998b|p=11}} The library truly became specialized, providing access to a collection of dictionaries (monolingual, bilingual, technical) and documents on the [[International Organizations]].{{sfn|Duret|1998b|p=21}} When the school moved to the Cours Commerciaux de Genève building in 1978, the library was equipped with computers, cassette tapes containing interpreting exercises and CD-ROMs.{{sfn|Duret|1998b|p=34}}

=== Simultaneous interpreting ===
Antoine Velleman was not in favour of simultaneous interpreting and so, initially, only consecutive interpreting classes were offered by the school. Graduates of the programme took it upon themselves to organize simultaneous interpreting training sessions in the evenings. The school’s alumni association (AAEDEI) contacted [[International Business Machines|IBM]] to set up an interpreting booth. The training sessions took place in a room rented on the ground floor of a Methodist church at 12 Rue Calvin. Sessions took place regularly from 1947 onwards. Each participant had to pay three francs per session in order to cover the cost of constructing the booth and renting the room. It was not until 1950 that the first simultaneous interpreting classes were officially offered at the school by Serge Gloor.{{sfn|Rumprecht|2008}}

In 1952, the school acquired simultaneous interpreting equipment, thanks to a donation from IBM. On 4 February 1953, a new simultaneous interpreting training room was inaugurated in the basement of Uni Bastions.{{sfn|Duret|1998b|p=15}} The room was equipped with ten booths and a control box, which was integrated into the teacher’s desk, allowing the teacher to monitor each booth.

Today, the Faculty has a virtual teaching platform that allows simultaneous interpreting to be taught at a distance. The application gives users access to digitized [[Public speaking|speeches]], a [[Internet forum|forum]], a [[Online chat|chat]] system and a space for teachers to give feedback to students. Students can listen back to the original speech as well as their interpretation of it.{{sfn|Moussadek|2007}}

== FTI Programmes ==
The Faculty offers the following programmes: [[Bachelor of Arts]] in Multilingual Communication, [[Master of Arts]] in Translation, Master of Arts in Conference Interpreting,&lt;ref name="bestFTI"&gt;Graduates of the FTI are among the best interpreters in the world, according to an article in The Monocle Forecast,  {{citation |language=en |issue=43 |author=Ed Stocker |title=Strong Language |periodical=The Monocle Forecast |year=2016 |pages=38–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Complementary Certificate in Translation.&lt;ref name="FTI2015formations"/&gt; Students make up their language combination based on the languages offered by the Faculty, which are [[German language|German]], [[English language|English]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Russian language|Russian]].

Besides translation and conference interpreting, the programmes offered by the Faculty can lead to careers in [[Wikipedia:Multilingual communication|multilingual communication]], [[public relations]], the [[mass media|media]], [[public administration]], [[tourism]], the [[court]] system, language mediation services, [[education]] and [[research]].

'''Foster's rule''', also known as the '''island rule''' or the '''island effect''', is an [[ecogeographical rule]] in [[evolutionary biology]] stating that members of a [[species]] get smaller or bigger depending on the resources available in the environment. For example, it is known that [[pygmy mammoth]]s evolved from normal [[mammoth]]s on small [[island]]s. Similar evolutionary paths have been observed in [[elephant]]s, [[hippopotamus]]es, [[Boidae|boa]]s, [[deer]] (such as [[Key deer]]) and [[human]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Juan Luis Arsuaga, Andy Klatt, ''The Neanderthal's Necklace: In Search of the First Thinkers'', Thunder's Mouth Press, 2004, {{ISBN|1-56858-303-6}}, {{ISBN|978-1-56858-303-7}}, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Baptiste de Panafieu, Patrick Gries, ''Evolution'', Seven Stories Press, 2007, {{ISBN|1-58322-784-9}}, {{ISBN|978-1-58322-784-8}}, p 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rule was first stated by J. Bristol Foster in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Foster | first=J.B. | year=1964 | title=The evolution of mammals on islands | journal=Nature | volume=202 | pages=234–235| doi=10.1038/202234a0 | bibcode=1964Natur.202..234F | issue=4929 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foster, J. B. (1965) The evolution of the mammals of the Queen Charlotte Islands, British Columbia. ''Occasional Papers of the British Columbia Provincial Museum'', '''14''', 1–130.&lt;/ref&gt; In it, he compared 116 island species to their mainland varieties. He proposed that certain island creatures evolved into [[insular gigantism|larger versions of themselves (insular gigantism)]] while others became [[insular dwarfism|smaller versions of themselves (insular dwarfism)]]. He proposed the simple explanation that smaller creatures get larger when predation pressure is relaxed because of the absence of some of the predators of the mainland, and larger creatures become smaller when food resources are limited because of land area constraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=R.J. | last=Whittaker | title=Island biogeography: ecology, evolution, and conservation | publisher=Oxford University Press, UK | year=1998 | isbn=978-0-19-850020-9 | pages=73–75 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea was expanded upon in ''[[The Theory of Island Biogeography]]'', by [[Robert MacArthur]] and [[Edward O. Wilson]]. In 1978, Ted J. Case published a longer paper on the topic in the journal ''[[Ecology (journal)|Ecology]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Case | first=T.J. | year=1978 | title=A general explanation for insular body size trends in terrestrial vertebrates | journal=Ecology | volume=59 | pages=1–18 | doi=10.2307/1936628 | issue=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[rocket]]ry, the '''Goddard problem''' is to optimize the [[altitude]] of a rocket, ascending vertically, and taking into account [[atmospheric drag]] and the [[gravitational field]].  This was first posed by [[Robert H. Goddard]] in his 1919 publication, "A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aoe.vt.edu/~cliff/aoe5244_99/week_13_a.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=AD0409855&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hans Kilian Award''' honors researchers whose outstanding scientific achievements provide a deeper insight into the historical and cultural existence of humankind and the changing human psyche.

The award was conceived by [[:de: Lotte Köhler|Lotte Köhler]] and established by the Köhler Foundation. It bears the name of the late social psychologist and psychoanalyst [[:de: Hans Kilian|Hans Kilian]] (1921-2008) and aims to foster his idea of an interdisciplinary social psychology and psychoanalysis as well as his concept of "metacultural humanization." This concept reflects the interactions between individual life history and broader sociohistorical developments and aims to integrate social and cultural psychological, psychoanalytic, anthropological, historical, and sociological perspectives.

In line with Hans Kilian's ideas, the award recognizes international scientific achievements that cross the boundaries between disciplines and cultures and create productive syntheses between previously isolated areas of knowledge. Desirable inter- and transdisciplinary perspectives combine theories, methods, and findings from a wide spectrum of disciplines including the humanities, the social sciences, and cultural studies, as well as psychiatry and other areas of medicine. Amounting to 80,000 euros, the Hans Kilian Award is one of the best-endowed social sciences awards in Europe. It is awarded every two years and was first awarded in 2011.

The award will be a central part of the activities of the [[Hans Kilian and Lotte Köhler Center]] (KKC) for Social and Cultural Scientific Psychology and Historical Anthropology which was founded by the Köhler Foundation in August 2014 and whose office and activities are based at the Chair of Social Theory and Social Psychology, Ruhr University Bochum, Germany.

[[File:Hjulströms diagram en.PNG|thumb|right|300px|The Hjulström curve]]The '''Hjulström curve''', named after [[Filip Hjulström]] (1902–1982), is a [[graph of a function|graph]] used by [[Hydrology|hydrologists]] and geologists to determine whether a [[river]] will [[erosion|erode]], [[sediment transport|transport]], or [[deposition (geology)|deposit]] sediment. It was originally published in his doctoral thesis "Studies of the morphological activity of rivers as illustrated by the River [[Fyris]].&lt;ref&gt;Hjulstrom, F. (1935). Studies of the morphological activity of rivers as illustrated by the River Fyris, Bulletin. Geological Institute Upsalsa, 25, 221-527.&lt;/ref&gt;" in 1935. The graph takes sediment particle size and water velocity into account.&lt;ref name=geography&gt;[http://www.geographylwc.org.uk/A/AS/ASriver/seddep.html Sediment transportation]. Last accessed 26 Dec 2011. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111211142423/http://www.geographylwc.org.uk/A/AS/ASriver/seddep.html |date=2011-12-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The upper curve shows the critical erosion velocity in cm/s as a function of particle size in mm, while the lower curve shows the deposition velocity as a function of particle size. Note that the axes are [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic]]. 

The plot shows several key concepts about the relationships between erosion, transportation, and deposition. For particle sizes where friction is the dominating force preventing erosion, the curves follow each other closely and the required velocity increases with particle size. However, for [[Cohesion (geology)|cohesive]] sediment, mostly [[clay]] but also [[silt]], the ''erosion'' velocity increases with decreasing [[grain size]], as the cohesive forces are relatively more important when the particles get smaller. The critical velocity for deposition, on the other hand, depends on the [[settling velocity]], and that decreases with decreasing grainsize. The Hjulström curve shows that sand particles of a size around 0.1 mm require the lowest stream velocity to erode.

The curve was expanded by [[Åke Sundborg]] in 1956. He significantly improved the level of detail in the cohesive part of the diagram, and added lines for different modes of transportation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://imnh.isu.edu/digitalatlas/hydr/concepts/gwater/hjulstrm.htm Hjulström's Diagram]. [[Idaho State University]]. Last accessed 26 Dec 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The result is called the ''Sundborg diagram'', or the ''Hjulström-Sundborg Diagram'', in the academic literature.

This curve dates back to early 20th century research on river geomorphology and has no more than a historical value nowadays, although its simplicity is still attractive. Among the drawbacks of this curve are that it does not take the water depth into account and more importantly, that it does not show that sedimentation is caused by flow velocity ''deceleration'' and erosion is caused by flow ''acceleration''. The dimensionless [[Shields Diagram]] is now unanimously accepted for initiation of sediment motion in rivers. Much work was done on river sediment transport formulae in the second half of the 20th century and that work should be used preferably to Hjulström's curve.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

[[File:Tyranov - Young Housewife.jpg|thumb|''Young Housewife'', Oil on canvas, by [[Alexey Tyranov]] (1801–1859), in the [[Russian Museum]], [[Saint Petersburg|St Petersburg]], [[Russia]]]]

A '''housewife''' (also known as a '''homekeeper''') is a woman whose work is running or managing her family's home—caring for her [[children]]; buying, [[cooking]], and [[Food preservation|storing]] food for the family; buying [[Good (economics)|goods]] that the family needs in everyday life; [[housekeeping]] and maintaining the home; and [[Sewing|making]] clothes for the family—and who is not employed outside the home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/american/housewife|website= Macmillan Dictionary |title=Housewife}}&lt;/ref&gt; A housewife may also be called a '''stay-at-home mother'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.stayathomemum.com.au|website=StayAtHomeMum|title=Home page}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a househusband may be called a "male homemaker" or [[stay-at-home dad|stay-at-home father]].

''[[Webster's Dictionary]]'' describes a housewife as a married woman who is in charge of her [[household]]. The British ''Chambers's Twentieth Century Dictionary'' (1901) defined a housewife as: "the mistress of a household; a female domestic manager; a pocket sewing kit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Davidson, Thomas (ed.)|title=Chambers's Twentieth Century Dictionary of the English Language|location=London|publisher= W. &amp; R. Chambers|page=443}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small sewing kit is sometimes called a "housewife" or "'''hussif'''".&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|housewife|id=88947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout history, women have usually worked for pay, either by contributing to farming and other family-owned businesses or working for other employers.  Housewives were common in developed countries only for a few decades during the middle of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Housewives work many unpaid hours a week, often depending on income from their husband's employment for financial support.

===Traditional societies===
[[File:The National Archives UK - CO 1069-46-45.jpg|thumb|A housewife in Yendi, [[Kumasi]], Ghana, pours water into a meal and her children play; 1957]]
In societies of [[Hunter-gatherer|hunters and gatherers]] like the traditional society of the Australian aboriginal people, the men hunt animals for meat, and the women gather other foods such as [[grain]], [[fruit]] and [[vegetable]]s. One of the reasons for this division of labor was that it is much easier to look after a baby while gathering fruit than while hunting a fast-moving animal. Even when homes were very simple and there were few possessions, men and women did different jobs.

In rural societies, where the main work is [[farming]], women have also taken care of gardens and animals around the house, generally helping men with heavy work when a job needed to be done quickly, usually because of the season.

Examples of the heavy work that a traditional housewife (homemaker) in a ''rural society'' would do are:
* Picking fruit when it was ripe for market
* Planting rice in a [[rice|paddy field]]
* Harvesting and stacking grain
* Cutting hay

In rural studies, the word ''housewife'' is occasionally used for a woman who does the majority of the chores within a farm's [[Compound (enclosure)|compound]] as opposed to field and livestock work{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}.

===Modern society===
A career woman may follow a "[[mommy track]]", or a [[shared earning/shared parenting marriage]].

Regarding [[Family#Size|family size]], a study of three [[Mexico|Mexican]] cities came to the result that there was no significant difference in the number of children in housewife families compared to those where women worked outside of the home part or full-time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Chant | first=Sylvia | title=Women and Survival in Mexican Cities: perspectives on gender, labour markets, and low-income households | publisher=Manchester University Press Distributed in the USA and Canada by St. Martin's Press | location=Manchester, UK; New York, NY, USA | year=1991 | isbn=0-7190-3443-4 | ref=harv}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=bPTPAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA128 Page 128]&lt;/ref&gt;

It has become more commonplace for the husband and wife to both be employed outside of the home and for both to share in the "housework" and caring for the children.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Full-time homemakers usually share in the income produced by members of the household who are employed; wage-earners working full-time benefit from the unpaid work provided by the housewife; otherwise, the performance of such work (child care, cooking, housecleaning, teaching, transporting, etc.) could be a household expense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/whats-a-wife-worth/Content?oid=871934|title=What's a Wife Worth?|date=17 March 1988|accessdate=17 Oct 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Community property]] states recognize joint ownership of marital property and income, and unless a prenuptial or postnuptial agreement is followed, most marital households in the US operate as a joint financial team and file [[taxes]] jointly.

===Education===
The method, necessity and extent of education of house wives has been debated since at least the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dement|first1=Alice L.|title=Higher Education of the Housewife: Wanted or Wasted?|journal=The Journal of Higher Education|date=1960|volume=31|issue=1 (January)|doi=10.2307/1977571|jstor=1977571|publisher=Ohio State University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mummy, I want to be a housewife|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/mummy-i-want-to-be-a-housewife/93431.article|accessdate=8 May 2016|work=Times Higher Education|date=26 April 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic1114896.files/Najmabadi%201998.pdf|title=Crafting an Educated Housewife in Iran}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/columnists/article3485879.ece|title=Highly educated housewives: what an economic waste|date=25 July 2012|work=The Times|accessdate=8 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Songs about the housewife's lot==
The housewife's tasks have often been the subject of songs. Examples include: "The Housewife's Lament" (from the diary of Sarah Price, Ottawa, Illinois, mid 19th century);&lt;ref&gt;Recorded on: ''The Female Frolic'', Argo ZDA 82 &amp; [[Peggy Seeger|Seeger, P.]] ''Penelope isn't Waiting any More'' Blackthorne BR 1050&lt;/ref&gt; "Nine Hours a Day" (1871 English song, anonymous); "A Woman's Work is Never Done"&lt;ref&gt;Recorded on [[Sam Richards (writer)|Staverton Bridge]] SADISC SDL 266&lt;/ref&gt; or "A Woman Never Knows When her Day's Work is Done"; "The Labouring Woman"; "How Five and Twenty Shillings were Expended in a Week" (English popular songs); "A Woman's Work" (London music hall song by Sue Pay, 1934).&lt;ref&gt;Kathy Henderson et al., comp. (1979) ''My Song is My Own: 100 women's songs''. London: Pluto; pp. 126-28, 142-43&lt;/ref&gt; "The Housewife's Alphabet", by [[Peggy Seeger]], was issued as a Blackthorne Records single with "My Son".&lt;ref&gt;''New City Songster''; vol. 13, Oct. 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

===In China===
In [[Imperial era of Chinese history|imperial China]] (excluding periods of the [[Tang dynasty]]), women were bound to homemaking by the doctrines of [[Confucianism]] and cultural norms. Generally, girls did not attend school and, therefore, spent the day doing household chores with their mothers and female relatives (for example, [[cooking]] and [[Housekeeping|cleaning]]). In most cases, the husband was alive and able to work, so the wife was almost always forbidden to take a job and mainly spent her days at home or doing other domestic tasks. As Confucianism spread across [[East Asia]], this social norm was also observed in [[Korea]], [[Japan]] and [[Vietnam]]. As [[foot binding]] became common after the [[Song Dynasty]], many women lost the ability to work outside.

After the founding of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] in 1911, these norms were gradually loosened and many women were able to enter the workforce. Shortly thereafter, a growing number of females began to be permitted to attend schools. Starting with the rule of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949, all women were freed from compulsory family roles. During the [[Great Leap Forward]] and [[Cultural Revolution]], some women even worked in fields that were traditionally reserved for males.

In modern China, housewives are no longer as common, especially in the largest cities and other urban areas.  Many modern women work simply because one person's income is insufficient to support the family, a decision made easier by the fact that it is common for Chinese grandparents to watch after their grandchildren until they are old enough to go to school. Nonetheless, the number of Chinese housewives has been steadily rising in recent years as China's economy expands.{{dubious|date=February 2017}}

===In India===

In a traditional [[Hindu]] family, the head of the family is the ''Griha Swami'' (Lord of the House) and his wife is the ''Griha Swamini'' (Lady of the House). The [[Sanskrit]] words ''Grihast'' and ''Grihasta'' perhaps come closest to describing the entire gamut of activities and roles undertaken by the homemaker. ''Grih'' is the Sanskrit root for house or home; Grihasta and Grihast are derivatives of this root, as is [[Grihastya]]. The couple lives in the state called ''Grihastashram'' or family system and together they nurture the family and help its members (both young and old) through the travails of life. The woman who increments the family tree (bears children) and protects those children is described as the ''Grihalakshmi'' (the wealth of the house) and ''Grihashoba'' (the glory of the house). The elders of the family are known as ''Grihshreshta''. The husband or wife may engage in countless other activities which may be social, religious, political or economic in nature for the ultimate welfare of the family and society. However, their unified status as joint householders is the nucleus from within which they operate in society. The traditional status of a woman as a homemaker anchors them in society and provides meaning to their activities within the social, religious, political and economic framework of their world. However, as India undergoes modernisation, many women are in employment, particularly in the larger cities such as [[Mumbai]], [[Delhi]], [[Kolkata]], [[Chennai]], [[Hyderabad]], [[Bangalore]] where most women will work. The role of the male homemaker is not traditional in [[India]], but it is socially accepted in [[urban area|urban]] areas. According to one sociologist's study in 2006, twelve percent of unmarried Indian men would consider being a homemaker according to a survey conducted by ''[[Business Today (business magazine)|Business Today]]''.&lt;ref name="life&amp;times"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://specials.indiatoday.com/indianmensurvey/Unmarried_Man_partner.php|title=Life &amp; Times of Indian Men|date=July 29, 2009|publisher=Business Today|accessdate=2009-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; One sociologist, Sushma Tulzhapurkar, called this a shift in Indian society, saying that a decade ago, "it was an unheard concept and not to mention socially unacceptable for men to give up their jobs and remain at home."&lt;ref name="dias"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/NEWS/City/Bombay-Times/Now-papas-do-what-mamas-did-best-/articleshow/1682154.cms|title=Now papas do what mamas did best!|last=Dias|first=Raul|date=June 26, 2006|publisher=Times of India|accessdate=2009-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, only 22.7 percent of Indian women are part of the [[labor force]], compared to 51.6 percent of men; thus, women are more likely to be caregivers because most do not work outside the home.&lt;ref name="fao"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/sd/wpdirect/WPre0108.htm|title=Asia's women in agriculture, environment and rural production|accessdate=2009-07-30|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140630002611/http://www.fao.org/sd/wpdirect/WPre0108.htm|archivedate=2014-06-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Korea===

====North Korea====
Until around 1990, the [[North Korea]]n state required every able-bodied male to be employed by some [[state enterprise]]. However, some 30% of married women of working age were allowed to stay at home as full-time housewives (less than in some countries in the same region like South Korea, Japan and [[Taiwan]]; more than in the former [[Soviet Union]], [[Mainland China]] and Nordic countries like Sweden, and about the same as in the United States&lt;ref&gt;[http://article.yeeyan.org/view/91830/133129 a Chinese-English translation web (译言网）:Will Chinese women rule the world?]&lt;/ref&gt;). In the early 1990s, after an estimated 900,000-3,500,000 people perished in the [[North Korean famine]], the old system began to fall apart. In some cases women began by selling homemade food or household items they could do without. Today at least three-quarters of North Korean market vendors are women. A joke making the rounds in [[Pyongyang]] goes: 'What do a [[husband]] and a pet dog have in common?' Answer: 'Neither works nor earns money, but both are cute, stay at home and can scare away burglars.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cuyoo.com/html/guoji/2010/0422/14322.html |author=Andrei Lankov (a professor in South Korea National University)|work= cuyoo.com (Chinese-English Translate Web|title= Pyongyang’s Women Wear the Pants}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two British magazines for housewives have been published: ''The Housewife'' (London: Offices of "The Million", 1886[1900]) and ''Housewife'' (London: Hultons, 1939–68).&lt;ref&gt;Held by various libraries in the UK; [http://copac.ac.uk Copac]&lt;/ref&gt;

"On a Tired Housewife" is an anonymous poem about the housewife's lot:

&lt;poem&gt;
Here lies a poor woman who was always tired,
She lived in a house where help wasn't hired:
Her last words on earth were: "Dear friends, I am going
To where there's no cooking, or washing, or sewing,
For everything there is exact to my wishes,
For where they don't eat there's no washing of dishes.
I'll be where loud anthems will always be ringing,
But having no voice I'll be quit of the singing.
Don't mourn for me now, don't mourn for me never,
I am going to do nothing for ever and ever."&lt;ref&gt;''The Penguin Book of Comic and Curious Verse'', ed. J. M. Cohen. Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1952; p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;

About 50% of married US women in 1978 continued to work after giving birth, while in 1997, the number was 61%. The number of housewives increased in the 2000s. With the [[2008 financial crisis]], a decrease in average income made two incomes more attractive, and the percentage of married US women who kept working after they giving birth increased to 69% by 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/news.release/famee.nr0.htm Employment Characteristics of Families Summary". U.S. Department of Labor. Retrieved 2011-10-22.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://article.yeeyan.org/view/91830/133129 a Chinese-English translation web (译言网: Will Chinese women rule the world?]&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, according to the Pew Research Center, more than one in four mothers are stay at home in the United States.

Housewives in America were typical in the middle of the 20th century among middle-class and upper-class white families.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://longreads.com/2018/03/21/seeking-a-roadmap-for-the-new-american-middle-class/|title=Seeking a Roadmap for the New American Middle Class|last=Gershon|first=Livia|date=2018-03-21|work=Longreads|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Black families, recent immigrants, and other minority groups tended not to benefit from the union wages, government policies, and other factors that led to white wives being able to stay at home during these decades.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A 2005 study estimated that 31 percent of working mothers leave the workplace (for an average of 2.2 years), most often precipitated by the birth of the second child.&lt;ref&gt;Hewlett, S. A., Luce, C. B., Shiller, P. &amp; Southwell, S. (2005, March). The hidden brain drain: Off-ramps and on-ramps in women’s careers. Center for WorkLife. Policy/Harvard Business Review Research. Report, Product no. 9491. Cambridge, MA: Harvard Business School Publishing Corporation.&lt;/ref&gt; This gives time to concentrate full-time on child-rearing and to avoid the high cost of child care, particularly through the early years (before school begins at age five). There is considerable variability within the stay-at-home mother population with regard to their intent to return to the paid workforce. Some plan to work from their homes, some will do part-time work, some intend to return to part or full-time work when their children have reached school age, some may increase their skill sets by returning to higher education, and others may find it financially feasible to refrain from entering (or re-entering) the paid workforce. Research has linked feelings of "maternal guilt and separation anxiety" to returning to the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, Stacey E., and H. Ray Wooten. "Highly educated stay-at-home mothers: A study of commitment and conflict." ''The Family Journal'' 15.4 (2007): 336-345.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, there is considerable variation in the stay-at-home mother's attitude towards domestic work not related to caring for children. Some may embrace a traditional role of housewife, cooking and cleaning in addition to caring for children. Others see their primary role as that of child-care providers, supporting their children's physical, intellectual, emotional, and spiritual development while sharing or outsourcing other aspects of home care.

==History==
Although men have generally been thought of as the primary [[breadwinner]]s for families in recent history, the division of labor between men and women in traditional societies required both genders to take an active role in obtaining resources outside the domestic sphere. Prior to discovering agriculture and animal husbandry, predictable food sources were a scarce commodity. To achieve optimal nutrition during this time, it was imperative that both men and women focus their energies on hunting and gathering as many different edible foods as possible to sustain themselves on a daily basis. Lacking the technologies necessary to store and preserve food, it was critical for men and women to seek out and obtain fresh food sources almost continuously. These nomadic tribes used gender differences to their advantage, allowing men and women to use their complementary adaptations and survival strategies to find the most diverse and nutritionally complete foods available. For example, in the context of daily foraging, childcare itself was not a hindrance to women's productivity; rather, performing this task with her children both increased the overall efficiency of the activity (more people participating equals a greater yield of edible roots, berries, nuts and plants), and functioned as an important hands-on lesson in survival skills for each child. By sharing the burden of daily sustenance – and developing specialized gender niches – humans not only ensured their continued survival, but also paved the way for later technologies to evolve and grow through experience.

In the 19th century, more and more women in industrialising countries stopped being homemakers and farm wives and began to undertake paid work in various industries outside the home and away from the family farm, in addition to the work they did at home. At this time many big [[factory|factories]] were set up, first in England then in other European countries and the United States. Many thousands of young women went to work in factories; most factories employed women in roles different from those occupied by men. There were also women who worked at home for low wages while caring for their children at the same time.

Being a housewife was only realistic among middle-class and upper-class families.  In working-class families, it was typical for women to work.  In the 19th century, a third to half of married women in England were recorded in the census as working for outside pay, and some historians believe this to be an undercount.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/13/working-women-stay-at-home-wives-myths|title=So wives didn't work in the 'good old days'?

Women were often very proud to be a good homemaker and have their house and children respectably taken care of.  Other women, like [[Florence Nightingale]], pursued non-factory professions even though they were wealthy enough that they did not need the income. Some professions open to women were also restricted to unmarried women, e.g., teaching.

In the early 20th century, both world wars ([[World War I]], 1914–18, and [[World War II]], 1939-45) were fought by men from many countries. (There were also special roles in the armed forces carried out by women, e.g. nursing, transport, etc. and in some countries women soldiers also.) While the men were at war, many of their womenfolk went to work to keep the countries running. Women, who were also homemakers, worked in factories, businesses and farms. At the end of both wars, many men had died, and others had returned injured. Some men were able to return to their previous positions, but some women stayed in the workforce as well. In addition to this surge in women entering the workforce, convenience food and technology were also rising in popularity, both of which saved women time that they may have spent performing domestic tasks, and enabled them to instead pursue other interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite | last = Maurer | first = Elizabeth | title = "How Highly Processed Foods Liberated 1950s Housewives" | publisher = National Women's History Museum | year = 2017 | url = https://www.womenshistory.org/articles/how-highly-processed-foods-liberated-1950s-housewives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The governments of [[Communist]] countries in the early and middle 20th century such as the Soviet Union and China encouraged married women to keep working after giving birth. There were very few housewives in Communist countries until [[Post-communism|free market economic reform]] in the 1990s, which led to a resurgence in the number of housewives. Conversely, in the [[Western World]] of the 1950s, many women quit their jobs to be housewives after giving birth. Only 11% of married women in the US kept working after giving birth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doc88.com/p-57886790766.html In the kitchen debate in 1959: Nixon said American housewives are happier than the Soviet Union working women]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s in western countries, it was becoming more accepted for a woman to work until she got married, when it was widely held that she should stop work and be a housewife. Many women believed that this was not treating men and women [[gender equality|equally]] and that women should do whatever jobs they were able to do, whether they were married or not. ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'', a 1963 book by [[Betty Friedan]] which is widely credited with sparking the beginning of [[second-wave feminism]] in the United States, discussed among other things the lives of housewives from around the United States who were unhappy despite living in material comfort and being married with children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/feminine-mystique/summary |title=The Feminine Mystique Summary |publisher=Enotes.com |accessdate=2011-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes2006"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/05/national/05friedan.html Betty Friedan, Who Ignited Cause in 'Feminine Mystique,' Dies at 85] - ''The New York Times,'' February 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, many women were becoming more educated. As a result of this increased education, some women were able to earn more than their husbands. In very rare cases, the husband would remain at home to raise their young children while the wife worked. In 1964 a US stamp was issued honoring homemakers for the 50th anniversary of the [[Smith-Lever Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nwhm.org/online-exhibits/stamps/homemakers.html|title=Leaving Their Stamp on History|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906064904/https://www.nwhm.org/online-exhibits/stamps/homemakers.html|archivedate=2015-09-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arago.si.edu/category_2034154.html|title=Arago: Homemakers Issue|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 20th century, in many countries it became harder for a family to live on a single wage. Subsequently, many women were required to return to work following the birth of their children. However, the number of male homemakers began gradually increasing in the late 20th century, especially in developed Western nations. In 2010, the number of male homemakers had reached its highest point of 2.2 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2014/06/05/growing-number-of-dads-home-with-the-kids/|title=Growing Number of Dads Home with the Kids|last=Livingston|first=Gretchen|website=Pew Research Center’s Social &amp; Demographic Trends Project|access-date=2016-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the role is subject to many [[stereotype]]s, and men may have difficulties accessing parenting benefits, communities, and services targeted at mothers, it became more socially acceptable by the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrea Doucet]], 2006.

However, in some regions of the world the male homemaker remains culturally unacceptable.

'''Metallurgical failure analysis''' is the process by which a metallurgist determines the mechanism that has caused a metal component to fail. Typical failure modes involve various types of corrosion and mechanical damage. It has been estimated that the direct annual [cost of corrosion] alone in the United States was $276 billion, approximately 3.1% of GDP, in 1998. Corrosion costs have continued to skyrocket and total corrosion costs now are greater than $1 trillion annually in the United States as of 2012.

Metal components fail as a result of the environmental conditions to which they are exposed to as well as the mechanical stresses that they experience. Often a combination of both environmental conditions and stress will cause failure.

Metal components are designed to withstand the environment and stresses that they will be subjected to. The design of a metal component involves not only a specific elemental composition but also specific manufacturing process such as heat treatments, machining processes, etc.…  The huge arrays of different metals that result all have unique physical properties.
 Specific properties are designed into metal components to make them more robust to various environmental conditions. These differences in physical properties will exhibit unique failure modes.  A metallurgical failure analysistakes into account as much of this information as possible during analysis. The end goal of failure analysis is to provide a determination of the root cause and a solution to any underlying problems to prevent future failures.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.g2mtlabs.com/failure-analysis/what-is-failure-analysis/   G2MT Labs - "What is Failure Analysis?"&lt;/ref&gt; 

Analysis of a failed part can be done using [[destructive testing]] or [[non-destructive testing]]. Destructive testing involves removing a metal component from service and sectioning the component for analysis. Destructive testing gives the failure analyst the ability to conduct the analysis in a [[laboratory]] setting and perform tests on the material that will ultimately destroy the component. Non destructive testing is a test method that allows certain physical properties of metal to be examined without taking the samples completely out of service. NDT is generally used to detect failures in components before the component fails catastrophically.

There is no standardized list of metallurgical [[failure mode]]s and different metallurgists might use a different name for the same failure mode. The Failure Mode Terms listed below are those accepted by [[ASTM]],&lt;ref&gt;“Standard Terms Relating to Corrosion and Corrosion Testing” (G 15), Annual Book of ASTM Standards, ASTM, Philadelphia, PA.
&lt;/ref&gt; [[ASM International (society)|ASM]],&lt;ref&gt;ASM-International Metals Handbook, Ninth Edition, Corrosion, ASM-International, Metals Park, OH
&lt;/ref&gt; and/or [[National Association of Corrosion Engineers|NACE]]&lt;ref&gt;NACE-International NACE Basic Corrosion Course, NACE-International, Houston, TX&lt;/ref&gt; as distinct metallurgical failure mechanisms.

'''MusicWriter''' was founded in 1989 by music industry veterans [[Jon Monday]] and Larry Heller to develop and market NoteStation, a kiosk-based retail "point-of-sale manufacturing" system for the distribution and printing of [[sheet music]]. Besides having a very large library of songs across all music genres, the NoteStation was able to print the [[sheet music]] on demand in any key, as selected by the customer. This reduced the need for retailers to carry a large selection of physical inventory, which was usually only printed in one key.

Early in the MusicWriter's history [[Warner Bros.]] Music and [[Thorn EMI]], the two largest music publishers in the world, invested in the company and became board members. The company then was able to sign most of the major music publishers to offer their titles through the system.

MusicWriter was among the first applications of the new distribution paradigm of "Mass Customization" or "Point-of-Sale Manufacturing", where a retailer is able to offer a very large selection of a product, with virtually no inventory, and manufacture the customized product on the spot for a customer. This trend was documented in B. Joseph Pine II’s 1993 book, ''Mass Customization, The New Frontier in Business Competition'' published by Harvard Business School Press.

The company expanded its features to include producing [[MIDI]] files on demand and online ordering of music products from distributors.{{ref|Article1}}

The company was featured on CNN TV and written about in Fortune Magazine, Business Week, USA Today, San Francisco Examiner, San Jose Mercury News, and Popular Science.

Due to the major print music companies that fought against the technologies, in 1999 MusicWriter went bankrupt as online technology emerged and the decline of [[sheet music]] retailers made the in-store technology obsolete. However, years later online versions of the technology were introduced by other companies, such as SheetMusicDirect.com, MusicNotes.com, and SheetMusicPlus.com.

'''Music acquisition''' is a theory or a term that has not yet been clearly or concisely defined, although there has been research done and attempts to prove that acquiring music, like language, is cognitively possible over time. Furthermore, the process of actually and gradually acquiring music has been carefully looked at yet not with enough information or cases to form a concrete definition or states with confidence that music acquisition is impossible or definitely possible. This theory itself is influenced by the concept and studies done on [[Language acquisition]] which is defined as the processes in which people acquire over time the cognitive ability to perceive and comprehend any language, but also, use and produce language as one form of expression. Some research conveys that the definition or attributes used for expression through language can also be used for expression through music or musical instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adrono|first1=T.

'''Music engraving''' is the [[art]] of drawing [[music notation]] at high quality for the purpose of mechanical reproduction. The term ''music copying'' is almost equivalent—though ''music engraving'' implies a higher degree of skill and quality, usually for publication. The name of the process originates in plate engraving, a widely used technique dating from the late sixteenth century.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Four Hundred Years of Music Printing|last = King|first = A. Hyatt|publisher = Trustees of the British Museum|year = 1968|isbn = |location = London|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''engraving'' is now used to refer to any high-quality method of drawing [[music notation]], particularly on a [[computer]] ("computer engraving" or "computer setting") or by hand ("hand engraving").

== Traditional engraving techniques ==

=== Elements of music engraving style ===
Mechanical music engraving began in the middle of the fifteenth century. As [[musical composition]] increased in complexity, so too did the technology required to produce accurate [[Sheet music|musical score]]s. Unlike literary printing, which mainly contains printed words, music engraving communicates several different types of information simultaneously. To be clear to musicians, it is imperative that engraving techniques allow absolute precision. Notes of [[Chord (music)|chords]], [[Dynamics (music)|dynamic markings]], and other notation line up with vertical accuracy. If text is included, each syllable matches vertically with its assigned melody. Horizontally, subdivisions of beats are marked not only by their flags and [[Beam (music)|beams]], but also by the relative space between them on the page.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The logistics of creating such precise copies posed several problems for early music engravers, and have resulted in the development of several music engraving technologies.

=== Moveable type ===
Similar to book printing, music printing began in the fifteenth century with the use of [[moveable type]]. The central problem posed to early music engravers using moveable type was the proper integration of notes, staves, and text. Often, staff lines were hand drawn prior to printing, or added to the printed music afterward. [[Ottavio Petrucci]], one of the most innovative music printers working at the turn of the sixteenth century, used a triple impression technique that printed staves, text, and notes in three separate steps.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Plate engraving ===
Although [[Engraving|plate engraving]] had been used since the early fifteenth century for creating visual art and maps, it was not applied to music until 1581.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In this method, a mirror image of a complete page of music was engraved onto a metal plate. Ink was then applied to the grooves, and the music print was transferred onto paper. Metal plates could be stored and reused, which made this method an attractive option for music engravers. [[Copper]] was the initial metal of choice for early plates, but by the eighteenth century [[pewter]] became the standard material due to its malleability and lower cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Early American Music Engraving and Printing|last = Wolfe|first = Richard J.|publisher = University of Illinois Press|year = 1980|isbn = |location = Urbana, IL|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At first, plates were engraved freely by hand. Eventually, music engravers developed a number of tools to aid in their process, including:
* Scorers for staves and [[Bar (music)|bar lines]], the use of which inspired the term [[Sheet music|musical score]]
* Elliptical gravers for [[Dynamics (music)|crescendos and diminuendos]]
* Flat gravers for [[Tie (music)|ties]] and [[ledger lines]]
* [[Punch (tool)|Punches]] for [[note head]]s, [[clefs]], [[Accidental (music)|accidentals]], and letters&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Music Publishing in the Canadas, 1800-1867|last = Calderisi|first = Maria|publisher = National Library of Canada|year = 1981|isbn = |location = Ottawa|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plate engraving was the methodology of choice for music printing until the late nineteenth century, at which point its decline was hastened by the development of photographic technology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Nevertheless, the technique has survived to the present day, and is still occasionally used by select publishers such as [[G. Henle Verlag]] in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.henle.com/en/the-publishing-house/music-engraving/index.html|title = Music Engraving|date = |accessdate = November 3, 2014|website = G. Henle Publishers|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hand copying ===
Historically, a musician was required to draw his own [[staff (music)|staff]] lines (staves) onto blank paper. Eventually, staff paper was manufactured pre-printed with staves as a labor-saving technique. The musician could then write music directly onto the lines in pencil or ink.

In the twentieth century, music staff paper was sometimes printed on [[vellum]] or [[onionskin]]—a durable, semi-transparent material that made it easier for the musician to correct mistakes and revise the work, and also made it possible to reproduce the manuscript through the [[ozalid|ozalid process]]. Also at this time, a [[music copyist]] was often employed to hand-copy individual parts (for each performer) from a composer's full score. Neatness, speed, and accuracy were desirable traits of a skilled copyist.

=== Other techniques ===
* '''[[Lithography]]''': Similar to metal plate engraving, the music was etched onto limestone and then burned onto the surface with acid to preserve the stone plates for future use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.musicprintinghistory.org/lithography/about-lithography.html|title = About Lithography|date = |accessdate = November 3, 2014|website = Music Printing History|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Stencils''', '''stamps''', and '''dry transfers''', including the Notaset, a system inspired by the [[Letraset]] used in the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.musicprintinghistory.org/stencils/transfers.html|title = Transfers|date = |accessdate = November 3, 2014|website = Music Printing History|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brushing ink through stencils was a high-quality technique used by [[Amersham]]-based company Halstan &amp; Co.
* '''Music [[typewriters]]''': Originally developed in the late nineteenth century, this technology did not become popular until the mid-1900s. The machines required the use of pre-printed [[manuscript paper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.musicprintinghistory.org/music-typewriters|title = Music Typewriters|date = |accessdate = October 22, 2017|website = Music Printing History|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique produced low-quality results and was never widely used.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QCgDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA143&amp;dq=popular+science+1930&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=AnvcTt6DBMePgwfR96XpDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwCThu#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Machine Types Simplified Music."] ''Popular Science'', August 1948, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Computer music engraving ==
{{Main article|Scorewriter}}

With the advent of the [[personal computer]] since the 1980s, traditional music engraving has been in decline, as it can now be accomplished by computer [[software]] designed for this purpose. There are various such programs, known as [[scorewriter]]s, designed for writing, editing, printing and playing back music, though only a few produce results of a quality comparable to high-quality traditional engraving. Scorewriters have many advanced features, such as the ability to extract individual parts from an orchestral/band score, to transcribe music played on a [[MIDI]] keyboard, and conversely to play back notation via MIDI.

Beginning in the 1980s, [[WYSIWYG]] software such as [[Sibelius Software|Sibelius]], [[MuseScore]], and [[Finale (software)|Finale]] first let musicians enter complex music notation on a computer screen, displaying it just as it will look when eventually printed. Such software stores the music in files of proprietary or standardized formats, usually not directly readable by humans.

Other software, such as GNU [[LilyPond]] and [[Philip's Music Writer]], reads input from ordinary text files whose contents resemble a computer [[Macro (computer science)|macro]] programming language that describes bare musical content with little or no layout specification. The software translates the usually handwritten description into fully engraved graphical pages to view or send for printing, taking care of appearance decisions from high level layout down to glyph drawing. The music entry process is iterative and is similar to the edit-compile-execute cycle used to debug computer programs.

Beside ready-made [[Application software|applications]] there are also some [[Library (computing)|programming libraries]] for music engraving, such as [http://www.vexflow.com/ Vexflow] ([[JavaScript|Javascript]] library), [http://www.verovio.org/ Verovio] (C++, [[JavaScript|Javascript]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]]), [http://guidolib.sourceforge.net/ Guido Engine] ([[C++]] library), and [http://manufaktura-controls.com/ Manufaktura Controls] ([[.NET Framework|.NET]] libraries).  The main purpose of these libraries is to reduce time required for development of software with score rendering capabilities.

'''Perceived performance''', in [[computer engineering]], refers to how quickly a [[software feature]] appears to perform its task. The concept applies mainly to [[user acceptance]] aspects.

The amount of time an application takes to start up, or a file to download, is not made faster by showing a startup screen (see [[Splash screen]]) or a file progress [[dialog box]]. However, it satisfies some human needs: it ''appears'' faster to the user as well as providing a visual cue to let them know the system is handling their request.

In most cases, increasing real performance increases perceived performance, but when real performance cannot be increased due to physical limitations, techniques can be used to increase perceived performance at the cost of marginally decreasing real performance. For example, drawing and refreshing a progress bar while loading a file satisfies the user who is watching, but steals time from the process that is actually loading the file, but usually this is only a very small amount of time. All such techniques must exploit the inability of the user to accurately judge real performance, or they would be considered detrimental to performance.

Techniques for improving perceived performance may include more than just decreasing the delay between the user's request and visual feedback. Sometimes an increase in delay can be perceived as a performance improvement, such as when a variable controlled by the user is set to a running average of the users input. This can give the impression of smoother motion, but the controlled variable always reaches the desired value a bit late. Since it smooths out hi-frequency jitter, when the user is attempting to hold the value constant, they may feel like they are succeeding more readily. This kind of compromise would be appropriate for control of a sniper rifle in a video game. Another example may be doing trivial computation ahead of time rather than after a user triggers an action, such as pre-sorting a large list of data before a user wants to see it.

A technique to measure and interpret perceived performance remote systems is shown in a 2003&lt;ref name="one"&gt;[http://www.tmurgent.com/WhitePapers/PerceivedPerformance.pdf Perceived Performance]&lt;/ref&gt; and updated in 2005 for virtual machines.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;[http://www.tmurgent.com/WhitePapers/PerceivedPerformance_VirtualOS.pdf Perceived Performance and Virtual Operating Systems]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Occupational hazards}}

'''Personal protective equipment''' ('''PPE''') refers to protective [[clothing]], [[helmets]], [[goggles]], or other garments or equipment designed to protect the wearer's body from [[injury]] or [[infection]]. The hazards addressed by protective equipment include physical, electrical, heat, chemicals, [[biological hazard|biohazards]], and [[Atmospheric particulate matter|airborne particulate matter]]. Protective equipment may be worn for job-related [[occupational safety and health]] purposes, as well as for [[sports]] and other  [[recreation|recreational activities]]. "Protective clothing" is applied to traditional categories of clothing, and "protective gear" applies to items such as pads, guards, shields, or  masks, and others.

The purpose of personal protective equipment is to reduce employee exposure to hazards when [[engineering controls]] and [[administrative controls]] are not feasible or effective to reduce these risks to acceptable levels. PPE is needed when there are hazards present. PPE has the serious limitation that it does not eliminate the hazard at the source and may result in employees being exposed to the hazard if the equipment fails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citation.co.uk/health-and-safety/personal-protective-equipment |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014041258/http://www.citation.co.uk/health-and-safety/personal-protective-equipment |archivedate=2012-10-14 |df= }} Personal Protective Equipment&lt;/ref&gt;

Any item of PPE imposes a barrier between the wearer/user and the working environment. This can create additional strains on the wearer;
impair their ability to carry out their work and create significant levels of discomfort. Any of these can discourage wearers from using PPE correctly, therefore placing them at risk of injury, ill-health or, under extreme circumstances, death. Good ergonomic design can help to minimise these barriers and can therefore help to ensure safe and healthy working conditions through the correct use of PPE.

Practices of occupational safety and health can use hazard controls and interventions to mitigate workplace hazards, which pose a threat to the safety and quality of life of workers. The [[hierarchy of hazard controls]] provides a policy framework which ranks the types of hazard controls in terms of absolute risk reduction. At the top of the hierarchy are [[Hazard elimination|elimination]] and [[Hazard substitution|substitution]], which remove the hazard entirely or replace the hazard with a safer alternative. If elimination or substitution measures cannot apply, engineering controls and administrative controls, which seek to design safer mechanisms and coach safer human behavior, are implemented. Personal protective equipment ranks last on the hierarchy of controls, as the workers are regularly exposed to the hazard, with a barrier of protection. The hierarchy of controls is important in acknowledging that, while personal protective equipment has tremendous utility, it is not the desired mechanism of control in terms of worker safety.

==Types==

Personal protective equipment can be categorized by the area of the body protected, by the types of hazard, and by the type of garment or accessory. A single item, for example boots, may provide multiple forms of protection: a steel toe cap and steel insoles for protection of the feet from crushing or puncture injuries, impervious rubber and lining for protection from water and chemicals, high [[Reflectance|reflectivity]] and heat resistance for protection from radiant heat, and high electrical [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|resistivity]] for protection from electric shock. The protective attributes of each piece of equipment must be compared with the hazards expected to be found in the workplace. More breathable types of personal protective equipment may not lead to more contamination but do result in greater user satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Verbeek|first1=Jos H|last2=Ijaz|first2=Sharea|last3=Mischke|first3=Christina|last4=Ruotsalainen|first4=Jani H|last5=Mäkelä|first5=Erja|last6=Neuvonen|first6=Kaisa|last7=Edmond|first7=Michael B|last8=Sauni|first8=Riitta|last9=Kilinc Balci|first9=F Selcen|last10=Mihalache|first10=Raluca C|title=Personal protective equipment for preventing highly infectious diseases due to exposure to contaminated body fluids in healthcare staff|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=19 April 2016|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd011621.pub2|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD011621.pub2/full|accessdate=29 April 2016|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|language=en|pmid=27093058|volume=4|page=CD011621}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Respirators===
{{main article|Respirator}}
[[File:Air-Purifying Respirator.jpg|thumb|Air-purifying respirator]]

Respirators serve to protect the user from breathing in contaminants in the air, thus preserving the health of one's respiratory tract. There are two main types of respirators. One type of respirator functions by filtering out chemicals and gases, or airborne particles, from the air breathed by the user.&lt;ref name=resp&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/respirators/ Respirators] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120830084012/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/respirators/ |date=2012-08-30 }}. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.&lt;/ref&gt; The filtration may be either passive or [[Powered, air-purifying respirator|active (powered)]]. [[Gas mask]]s and [[respirator|particulate respirators]] are examples of this type of respirator. A second type of respirator protects users by providing clean, respirable air from another source. This type includes airline respirators and [[self-contained breathing apparatus]] (SCBA).&lt;ref name =resp/&gt; In work environments, respirators are relied upon when adequate ventilation is not available or other engineering control systems are not feasible or inadequate.&lt;ref name=resp/&gt;

In the United Kingdom, an organization that has extensive expertise in respiratory protective equipment is the [[Institute of Occupational Medicine]]. This expertise has been built on a long-standing and varied research programme that has included the setting of workplace protection factors to the assessment of efficacy of masks available through high street retail outlets.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

The [[Health and Safety Executive]] (HSE), [[NHS Health Scotland]] and Healthy Working Lives (HWL) have jointly developed the RPE (Respiratory Protective Equipment) Selector Tool, which is web-based. This interactive tool provides descriptions of different types of respirators and breathing apparatuses, as well as "dos and don'ts" for each type.&lt;ref name=rpe&gt;[http://www.healthyworkinglives.com/rpe-selector/ "Selecting the right Respiratory Protective Equipment (RPE) for the job"]. Healthy Working Lives. 2008-4-4&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) provides recommendations on respirator use, in accordance to NIOSH federal respiratory regulations 42 CFR Part 84.&lt;ref name=resp/&gt; [[The National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory]] (NPPTL) of NIOSH is tasked towards actively conducting studies on respirators and providing recommendations.&lt;ref name=factsheet&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/factsheets/respfact.html CDC - NIOSH - Respirator Fact Sheet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170928092148/https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/factsheets/respfact.html |date=2017-09-28 }}.

===Skin protection===

Occupational skin diseases such as [[contact dermatitis]], [[skin cancer]]s, and other skin injuries and infections are the second-most common type of occupational disease and can be very costly.&lt;ref name="skin"&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/skin/ CDC - Skin Exposures and Effects - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120806040459/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/skin/ |date=2012-08-06 }}. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.&lt;/ref&gt; Skin hazards, which lead to occupational skin disease, can be classified into four groups. [[Chemical hazard|Chemical agents]] can come into contact with the skin through direct contact with contaminated surfaces, deposition of aerosols, immersion or splashes.&lt;ref name="skin" /&gt; Physical agents such as extreme temperatures and ultraviolet or solar radiation can be damaging to the skin over prolonged exposure.&lt;ref name="skin" /&gt; Mechanical trauma occurs in the form of friction, pressure, abrasions, lacerations and contusions.&lt;ref name="skin" /&gt; Biological agents such as parasites, microorganisms, plants and animals can have varied effects when exposed to the skin.&lt;ref name="skin" /&gt;

Any form of PPE that acts as a barrier between the skin and the agent of exposure can be considered skin protection. Because much work is done with the hands, [[glove]]s are an essential item in providing skin protection. Some examples of gloves commonly used as PPE include [[rubber gloves]], [[cut-resistant gloves]], [[chainsaw safety clothing|chainsaw gloves]] and heat-resistant gloves. For sports and other recreational activities, many different gloves are used for protection, generally against mechanical trauma.

Other than gloves, any other article of clothing or protection worn for a purpose serve to protect the skin. [[White coat|Lab coats]] for example, are worn to protect against potential splashes of chemicals. [[Face shield]]s serve to protect one's face from potential impact hazards, chemical splashes or possible infectious fluid.

===Eye protection===
{{Main|Eye protection}}
[[Image:Nuxos1pl.JPG|thumb|left|A paintball player wearing appropriate eye protection against impact.]]

Each day, about 2000 US workers have a job-related eye injury that requires medical attention.&lt;ref name="eye"&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/eye/ CDC - Eye Safety - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707114404/https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/eye/ |date=2017-07-07 }}. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.&lt;/ref&gt; Eye injuries can happen through a variety of means. Most eye injuries occur when solid particles such as metal slivers, wood chips, sand or cement chips get into the eye.&lt;ref name="eye" /&gt; Smaller particles in [[smoke]]s and larger particles such as broken glass also account for particulate matter-causing eye injuries. Blunt force trauma can occur to the eye when excessive force comes into contact with the eye. Chemical burns, biological agents, and thermal agents, from sources such as [[welding]] torches and [[ultraviolet|UV light]], also contribute to occupational eye injury.&lt;ref name="eyesafe"&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/eye/eyesafe.html CDC - Eye Safety - Eye Safety for Emergency Response and Disaster Recovery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170902212409/https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/eye/eyesafe.html |date=2017-09-02 }}. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the required eye protection varies by occupation, the safety provided can be generalized. Safety glasses provide protection from external debris, and should provide side protection via a wrap-around design or side shields.&lt;ref name="eyesafe" /&gt;
* [[Goggles]] provide better protection than safety glasses, and are effective in preventing eye injury from chemical splashes, impact, dusty environments and welding.&lt;ref name="eyesafe" /&gt; Goggles with high air flow should be used to prevent fogging.&lt;ref name="eyesafe" /&gt;
* [[Face shield]]s provide additional protection and are worn over the standard eyewear; they also provide protection from impact, chemical, and blood-borne hazards.&lt;ref name="eyesafe" /&gt;
* Full-facepiece respirators are considered the best form of eye protection when respiratory protection is needed as well, but may be less effective against potential impact hazards to the eye.&lt;ref name="eyesafe" /&gt;
* Eye protection for welding is shaded to different degrees, depending on the specific operation.&lt;ref name="eyesafe" /&gt;

===Hearing protection===
{{Main article|Hearing protection}}
[[Industrial noise]] is often overlooked as an occupational hazard, as it is not visible to the eye. Overall, about 22 million workers in the United States are exposed to potentially damaging noise levels each year.&lt;ref name="noise"&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noise/stats.html CDC - Noise and Hearing Loss Prevention - Facts and Statistics - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160703145248/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noise/stats.html |date=2016-07-03 }}. The National Institute for Occuaptional Safety and Health.&lt;/ref&gt; Occupational hearing loss accounted for 14% of all occupational illnesses in 2007, with about 23,000 cases significant enough to cause permanent hearing impairment.&lt;ref name="noise" /&gt; About 82% of occupational hearing loss cases occurred to workers in the manufacturing sector.&lt;ref name="noise" /&gt; The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] establishes occupational noise exposure standards.&lt;ref name="oshanoise"&gt;[https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=standards&amp;p_id=9735 Occupational noise exposure - 1910.95] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402213424/https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=standards&amp;p_id=9735 |date=2015-04-02 }}. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration.&lt;/ref&gt; NIOSH recommends that worker exposures to noise be reduced to a level equivalent to 85&amp;nbsp;dBA for eight hours to reduce occupational [[noise-induced hearing loss]].&lt;ref name="criteria"&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/98-126/pdfs/98-126.pdf Criteria for a Recommended Standard: Occupational Noise Exposure] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202172749/https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/98-126/pdfs/98-126.pdf |date=2017-02-02 }}.  DHHS (NIOSH) Publication No. 98-126.&lt;/ref&gt;

PPE for hearing protection consists of [[earplugs]] and [[earmuffs]]. Workers who are regularly exposed to noise levels above the NIOSH recommendation should be furnished hearing protection by the employers, as they are a low-cost intervention.

===Protective clothing and ensembles===
{{See also|List of personal protective equipment by body area}}
[[File:Regal mit Persönlicher Schutzausrüstung.jpg|thumb|upright|Locker containing personal protective equipment]][[Image:High-Pressure-Cleaning-with-Personal-Protective-Equipment.jpg|thumb|right|A complete PPE ensemble worn during high pressure cleaning work]]

This form of PPE is all-encompassing and refers to the various suits and uniforms worn to protect the user from harm. Lab coats worn by scientists and [[ballistic vest]]s worn by law enforcement officials, which are worn on a regular basis, would fall into this category. Entire sets of PPE, worn together in a combined suit, are also in this category.

====Ensembles====
Below are some examples of ensembles of personal protective equipment, worn together for a specific occupation or task, to provide maximum protection for the user.
* [[Chainsaw]] [[chainsaw safety clothing|protection]] (especially a helmet with face guard, hearing protection, [[kevlar]] [[chaps]], anti-vibration gloves, and [[Chainsaw safety clothing#Boots|chainsaw safety boots]]).
* [[Beekeeping|Bee-keepers]] wear various levels of protection depending on the temperament of their bees and the reaction of the bees to nectar availability. At minimum most bee keepers wear a brimmed hat and a veil made of fine mesh netting. The next level of protection involves [[leather glove]]s with long gauntlets and some way of keeping [[bees]] from crawling up one's trouser legs. In extreme cases, specially fabricated shirts and trousers can serve as barriers to the bees' stingers.
* [[Diving equipment]], for underwater diving, constitutes equipment such as a [[diving helmet]] or [[diving mask]], an [[scuba set|underwater breathing apparatus]], and a [[diving suit]].
* [[Firefighter]]s wear PPE designed to provide protection against fires and various fumes and gases. PPE worn by firefighters include [[bunker gear]], [[self-contained breathing apparatus]], a [[helmet]], [[steel-toe boot|safety boots]], and a [[PASS device]].

====In sports====
{{Main|Protective gear in sports}}
Participants in sports often wear protective equipment. Studies performed on the injuries of professional athletes, such as that on [[National Football League|NFL]] players,&lt;ref name=brainnfl&gt;[http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2012/09/nfl-brain-injury/ CDC - NIOSH Science Blog - Brain Injury in the NFL] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20121220112221/http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2012/09/nfl-brain-injury/ |date=2012-12-20 }}.

==Limits of the definition==
[[File:Safetyequipment3030.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Workers using personal protective equipment while painting poles. While basic head protection is present, no engineering fall protection systems appear to be in place.]]
The definition of what constitutes as personal protective equipment varies by country. In the United States, the laws regarding PPE also vary by state. In 2011, workplace safety complaints were brought against [[Hustler]] and other adult film production companies by the [[AIDS Healthcare Foundation]], leading to several citations brought by [[California Occupational Safety and Health Administration|Cal/OSHA]].&lt;ref name=hustler&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110330007006/en/Larry-Flynt%E2%80%99s-Hustler-Video-Cited-CalOSHA-Condoms|title=Larry Flynt’s Hustler Video Cited by Cal/OSHA over Condoms, Safety, Says AHF|author=|date=|website=businesswire.com|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806224124/http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110330007006/en/Larry-Flynt%E2%80%99s-Hustler-Video-Cited-CalOSHA-Condoms|archivedate=6 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The failure to use [[condom]]s by adult film stars was a violation of Cal/OSHA's Blood borne Pathogens Program, Personal Protective Equipment.&lt;ref name=hustler/&gt; This example shows that personal protective equipment can cover a variety of occupations in the United States, and has a wide-ranging definition.

==Legislation in the European Union==
At the [[European Union]] level, personal protective equipment is governed by Directive 89/686/EEC on personal protective equipment (PPE). The Directive is designed to ensure that PPE meets common quality and safety standards by setting out basic safety requirements for personal protective equipment, as well as conditions for its placement on the market and free movement within the EU single market. It covers ‘any device or appliance designed to be worn or held by an individual for protection against one or more health and safety hazards’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/1989/686/oj/eng|title=Council Directive 89/686/EEC of 21 December 1989 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to personal protective equipment|author=|date=30 December 1989|website=europa.eu|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The directive was adopted on 21 January 1989 and came into force on 1 July 1992. The [[European Commission]] additionally allowed for a transition period until 30 June 1995 to give companies sufficient time to adapt to the legislation. After this date, all PPE placed on the market in EU Member States was required to comply with the requirements of Directive 89/686/EEC and carry the [[CE Marking]].

Article 1 of Directive 89/686/EEC defines personal protective equipment as any device or appliance designed to be worn or held by an individual for protection against one or more health and safety hazards. PPE which falls under the scope of the Directive is divided into three categories:
* Category I: simple design (e.g. gardening gloves, footwear, ski goggles)
* Category II:  PPE not falling into category I or III (e.g. personal flotation devices, dry and wet suits)
* Category III:  complex design (e.g. respiratory equipment, harnesses)

Directive 89/686/EEC on personal protective equipment does not distinguish between PPE for professional use and PPE for leisure purposes.

Personal protective equipment falling within the scope of the Directive must comply with the basic health and safety requirements set out in Annex II of the Directive. To facilitate conformity with these requirements, harmonized standards are developed at the European or international level by the [[European Committee for Standardization]] (CEN, CENELEC) and the [[International Organization for Standardization]] in relation to the design and manufacture of the product. Usage of the harmonized standards is voluntary and provides presumption of conformity. However, manufacturers may choose an alternative method of complying with the requirements of the Directive.

Personal protective equipment excluded from the scope of the Directive includes:
* PPE designed for and used by the armed forces or in the maintenance of law and order;
* PPE for self-defence (e.g. aerosol canisters, personal deterrent weapons);
* PPE designed and manufactured for personal use against adverse atmospheric conditions (e.g. seasonal clothing, umbrellas), damp and water (e.g. dish-washing gloves) and heat;
* PPE  used on vessels and aircraft but not worn at all times;
* helmets and visors intended for users of two- or three-wheeled motor vehicles.

The European Commission is currently working to revise Directive 89/686/EEC. The revision will look at the scope of the Directive, the conformity assessment procedures and technical requirements regarding market surveillance. It will also align the Directive with the New Legalislative Framework. The European Commission is likely to publish its proposal in 2013. It will then be discussed by the [[European Parliament]] and [[Council of the European Union]] under the ordinary legislative procedure before being published in the [[Official Journal of the European Union]] and becoming law.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5828">Anna Cecilia '''Petra Östergren''' (born 29 September 1965 in [[Kiruna Municipality]]) is a Swedish [[feminist]] writer, debater, social commentator and an instructor in [[self defense]]. She has an MA in [[Social Anthropology]] ([[University of Stockholm]]), and is a doctoral student at [[Lund University]]. Her research is titled "The State of Feminism".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/o.o.i.s?id=24890&amp;news_item=4626 Ulrika Oredsson. Interview with Petra Östergren - Prostitution Law, Lund University, 28 January 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815053804/http://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/o.o.i.s?id=24890&amp;news_item=4626 |date=15 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lu.se/o.o.i.s?id=12344&amp;news_item=4419 Porträtt Petra Östergren: Ofrivillig provokatör.

== Self-defence ==
In the 1980s Östergren  helped launch a feminist self-defense movement in [[Sweden]]. She was active as an instructor in the organisation ''Pandora kvinnligt försvar'' (Pandora Women's Defense) and ran the Kung Fu club in the [[kajukenbo]] style in an effort to help women defend themselves against sexual assault. She was involved with the National Organisation for Women's Shelters and [[Roks]].
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roks.se/ Roks: Riksorganisationen för kvinnojourer och tjejjourer i Sverige (National organisation for women's and young women's shelters in Sweden)]&lt;/ref&gt;
She is the author of ''Slå tillbaka!: Handbok i självförsvar'' (Fight back!; A handbook of self-defence) published in 1993. She also wrote a book about her mother, who was beaten to death by a man she had had a brief relationship with, entitled ''Att komma till ro med det allra värsta'' (Coming to terms with the worst).

== Sociology and gender politics ==
Her involvement with teaching men self-defence made her a controversial figure with radical feminists, and the rift became complete when she published an article in [[Bang (magazine)|Bang]] magazine in which she questioned whether all pornography was essentially misogynous.

Östergren is considered a major critic of [[radical feminism]] in Sweden. In particular she has challenged their views on sex, violence and power, pointing out that violence in [[lesbian]] relationships did not differ significantly from that in [[heterosexual]] relationships. From its origin, Östergren was one of the few people who publicly challenged the radical feminist position on [[Prostitution in Sweden|prostitution]] which culminated in the ''sexköpslagen'' (Sex Purchase Act) 1999. She has been an advocate for the decriminalisation of prostitution. In 2006, she published ''Porr, horor och feminister'' (Pornography, whores and other feminists), an analysis of three decades of Swedish policy on [[pornography]] and prostitution, and a critique of radical feminist sexual politics. In 2008, she published an edited volume ''F-ordet: Mot en ny feminism'' (The F -word: Towards a new feminism), bringing together writers and commentators to provide new perspectives on old feminist issues.

== Work ==
In addition to her books, Östergren writes regularly for newspapers and magazines, including ''[[Svenska Dagbladet]]'', ''[[LO-tidningen]]'', ''[[Expressen]]'', ''[[Aftonbladet]]'', [[Axess magasin|''Axess'']] and ''Voltaire'' and regularly gives public talks, and is consulted on prostitution and gender issues.

'''Plant nutrition''' is the study of the [[chemical element]]s and [[Chemical compound|compounds]] necessary for plant growth, plant metabolism and their external supply. In 1972, [[Emanuel Epstein]] defined two criteria for an element to be essential for plant growth:

# in its absence the plant is unable to complete a normal life cycle.
# or that the element is part of some essential plant constituent or metabolite.

This is in accordance with Justus von [[Liebig's law of the minimum]].&lt;ref name="Epstein1972" /&gt; The essential plant nutrients include [[carbon]], [[oxygen]] and [[hydrogen]] which are absorbed from the air, whereas other nutrients including nitrogen are typically obtained from the  soil (exceptions include some [[parasitic plant|parasitic]] or [[carnivorous plant|carnivorous]] plants).

There are seventeen most important nutrients for plants. Plants must obtain the following mineral nutrients from their growing medium:-&lt;ref name="BarkerPilbeam2007" /&gt;
* the macronutrients: [[nitrogen]] (N), [[phosphorus]] (P), [[potassium]] (K), [[calcium]] (Ca), [[sulfur]] (S), [[magnesium]] (Mg), [[carbon]] (C), [[oxygen]](O), [[hydrogen]] (H)
* the micronutrients (or trace minerals): [[iron]] (Fe), [[boron]] (B), [[chlorine]] (Cl), [[manganese]] (Mn), [[zinc]] (Zn), [[copper]] (Cu), [[molybdenum]] (Mo), [[nickel]] (Ni)

These elements stay beneath soil as [[salts]], so plants consume these elements as [[ions]]. The macronutrients are consumed in larger quantities; hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and carbon contribute to over 95% of a plants' entire biomass on a dry matter weight basis. Micronutrients are present in plant tissue in quantities measured in parts per million, ranging from 0.1&lt;ref name="Marschner2012" /&gt; to 200&amp;nbsp;ppm, or less than 0.02% dry weight.&lt;ref name=aesl /&gt;

Most [[soil]] conditions across the world can provide plants adapted to that climate and soil with sufficient nutrition for a complete life cycle, without the addition of nutrients as [[fertilizer]]. However, if the soil is cropped it is necessary to artificially modify [[soil fertility]] through the addition of [[fertilizer]] to promote vigorous growth and increase or sustain yield. This is done because, even with adequate water and light, [[Physiological plant disorders#Nutrient deficiencies|nutrient deficiency]] can limit growth and crop yield.

==Processes==
Plants take up [[essential element]]s from the soil through their roots and from the air (mainly consisting of nitrogen and oxygen) through their leaves. Nutrient uptake in the soil is achieved by [[cation exchange]], wherein [[root hair]]s pump hydrogen ions (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) into the soil through [[proton pump]]s. These hydrogen ions displace cations attached to negatively charged soil particles so that the cations are available for uptake by the root. In the leaves, [[stomata]] open to take in carbon dioxide and expel oxygen. The carbon dioxide molecules are used as the carbon source in [[photosynthesis]].

The [[root]], especially the root hair, is the essential organ for the uptake of nutrients. The structure and architecture of the root can alter the rate of nutrient uptake. Nutrient ions are transported to the center of the root, the [[stele (biology)|stele]], in order for the nutrients to reach the conducting tissues, xylem and phloem.&lt;ref name="HunerHopkins2009"/&gt; The [[Casparian strip]], a cell wall outside the stele but within the root, prevents passive flow of water and nutrients, helping to regulate the uptake of nutrients and water.&lt;ref name="HunerHopkins2009"/&gt; [[Xylem]] moves water and mineral ions within the plant and [[phloem]] accounts for organic molecule transportation. [[Water potential]] plays a key role in a plant's nutrient uptake. If the water potential is more negative within the plant than the surrounding soils, the nutrients will move from the region of higher solute concentration—in the soil—to the area of lower solute concentration - in the plant.

There are three fundamental ways plants uptake nutrients through the root: 
# [[Simple diffusion]] occurs when a nonpolar molecule, such as O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; follows a concentration gradient, moving passively through the cell lipid bilayer membrane without the use of transport proteins. 
# [[Facilitated diffusion]] is the rapid movement of solutes or ions following a concentration gradient, facilitated by transport proteins. 
# [[Active transport]] is the uptake by cells of ions or molecules against a concentration gradient; this requires an energy source, usually ATP, to power molecular pumps that move the ions or molecules through the membrane.&lt;ref name="HunerHopkins2009"/&gt;

Nutrients can be moved within plants to where they are most needed. For example, a plant will try to supply more nutrients to its younger leaves than to its older ones. When nutrients are mobile within the plant, symptoms of any deficiency become apparent first on the older leaves. However, not all nutrients are equally mobile. Nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium are mobile nutrients while the others have varying degrees of mobility. When a less-mobile nutrient is deficient, the younger leaves suffer because the nutrient does not move up to them but stays in the older leaves.  This phenomenon is helpful in determining which nutrients a plant may be lacking.

Many plants engage in [[symbiosis]] with microorganisms.  Two important types of these relationship are 
# with bacteria such as [[rhizobia]], that carry out [[biological nitrogen fixation]], in which atmospheric [[nitrogen]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is converted into [[ammonium]] (NH{{su|b=4|p=+}}); and 
# with [[mycorrhizal fungi]], which through their association with the plant roots help to create a larger effective root surface area. Both of these mutualistic relationships enhance nutrient uptake.&lt;ref name="HunerHopkins2009"/&gt; 
 
Though nitrogen is plentiful in the Earth's atmosphere, relatively few plants harbour nitrogen-fixing bacteria, so most plants rely on nitrogen compounds present in the soil to support their growth. These can be supplied by [[Mineralization (soil science)|mineralization]] of [[soil organic matter]] or added plant residues, nitrogen fixing bacteria, animal waste, through the breaking of triple bonded N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules by lightning strikes or through the application of [[fertilizer]]s.

==Functions of nutrients==
{{Further information|Soil#Nutrients}}

At least 17 elements are known to be essential nutrients for plants. In relatively large amounts, the soil supplies nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and sulfur; these are often called the [[Nutrient|macronutrients]]. In relatively small amounts, the [[soil]] supplies iron, manganese, boron, molybdenum, copper, zinc, chlorine, and cobalt, the so-called [[Nutrient|micronutrients]]. Nutrients must be available not only in sufficient amounts but also in appropriate ratios.

Plant nutrition is a difficult subject to understand completely, partially because of the variation between different plants and even between different species or individuals of a given clone. Elements present at low levels may cause deficiency symptoms, and toxicity is possible at levels that are too high. Furthermore, deficiency of one element may present as symptoms of toxicity from another element, and vice versa. An abundance of one nutrient may cause a deficiency of another nutrient. For example, K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; uptake can be influenced by the amount of NH{{su|b=4|p=+}} available.&lt;ref name="HunerHopkins2009"/&gt;

Although nitrogen is plentiful in the Earth's atmosphere, relatively few plants engage in [[nitrogen fixation]] (conversion of atmospheric nitrogen to a biologically useful form). Most plants, therefore, require nitrogen compounds to be present in the soil in which they grow.

Carbon and oxygen are absorbed from the air while other nutrients are absorbed from the soil. [[Plant|Green plants]] obtain their carbohydrate supply from the carbon dioxide in the air by the process of [[photosynthesis]]. Each of these nutrients is used in a different place for a different essential function.&lt;ref name=Taiz2002 /&gt;

=== Macronutrients (derived from air and water) ===

====Carbon====

[[Carbon]] forms the backbone of most plant [[biomolecule]]s, including proteins, [[starch]]es and [[cellulose]]. [[Carbon fixation|Carbon is fixed]] through [[photosynthesis]]; this converts [[carbon dioxide]] from the air into [[carbohydrate]]s which are used to store and transport energy within the plant.

====Hydrogen====

[[Hydrogen]] also is necessary for building sugars and building the plant. It is obtained almost entirely from water. Hydrogen ions are imperative for a proton gradient to help drive the electron transport chain in photosynthesis and for respiration.&lt;ref name="HunerHopkins2009"/&gt;

====Oxygen====

[[Oxygen]] is a component of many organic and inorganic molecules within the plant, and is acquired in many forms. These include: [[Dioxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] (mainly from the air via leaves) and [[Water|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]], [[Nitrate|NO{{su|b=3|p=−}}]], [[Dihydrogen phosphate|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO{{su|b=4|p=−}}]] and [[Sulfate|SO{{su|b=4|p=2−}}]] (mainly from the soil water via roots). Plants produce oxygen gas (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) along with [[glucose]] during [[photosynthesis]] but then require O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to undergo aerobic [[cellular respiration]] and break down this glucose to produce [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].

===Macronutrients (primary)===
{{Further information|Microbial inoculant}}

====Nitrogen====
{{Further information|Nitrogen cycle}}

[[Nitrogen]] is a major constituent of several of the most important plant substances. For example, nitrogen compounds comprise 40% to 50% of the dry matter of [[protoplasm]], and it is a constituent of [[amino acid]]s, the building blocks of [[protein]]s.&lt;ref name="swan2"/&gt; It is also an essential constituent of [[chlorophyll]].&lt;ref name="Roy2006Chapter3" /&gt; [[Nitrogen deficiency]] most often results in stunted growth, slow growth, and chlorosis. Nitrogen deficient plants will also exhibit a purple appearance on the stems, petioles and underside of leaves from an accumulation of anthocyanin pigments.&lt;ref name="HunerHopkins2009"/&gt; Most of the nitrogen taken up by plants is from the soil in the forms of NO{{su|b=3|p=−}}, although in acid environments such as boreal forests where nitrification is less likely to occur, ammonium NH{{su|b=4|p=+}} is more likely to be the dominating source of nitrogen.&lt;ref name=Lowenfels2011 /&gt; Amino acids and proteins can only be built from NH{{su|b=4|p=+}}, so NO{{su|b=3|p=−}} must be reduced. In many agricultural settings, nitrogen is the limiting nutrient for rapid growth. Nitrogen is transported via the xylem from the roots to the leaf canopy as nitrate ions, or in an organic form, such as amino acids or amides. Nitrogen can also be transported in the phloem sap as amides, amino acids and ureides; it is therefore mobile within the plant, and the older leaves exhibit chlorosis and necrosis earlier than the younger leaves.&lt;ref name="HunerHopkins2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roy2006Chapter3" /&gt;

There is an abundant supply of nitrogen in the earth’s atmosphere — N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas comprises nearly 79% of air. However, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is unavailable for use by most organisms because there is a triple bond between the two nitrogen atoms in the molecule,  making it almost inert. In order for nitrogen to be used for growth it must be [[Nitrogen fixation|“fixed”]] (combined) in the form of [[ammonium]] (NH{{su|b=4|p=+}}) or nitrate (NO{{su|b=3|p=−}}) ions. The weathering of rocks releases these ions so slowly that it has a negligible effect on the availability of fixed nitrogen. Therefore, nitrogen is often the limiting factor for growth and [[biomass]] production in all environments where there is a suitable climate and availability of water to support life.

Nitrogen enters the plant largely through the [[root]]s. A “pool” of soluble nitrogen accumulates. Its composition within a species varies widely depending on several factors, including day length, time of day, night temperatures, nutrient deficiencies, and nutrient imbalance. Short day length promotes [[asparagine]] formation, whereas glutamine is produced under long day regimes. Darkness favors protein breakdown accompanied by high asparagine accumulation. Night temperature modifies the effects due to night length, and soluble nitrogen tends to accumulate owing to retarded synthesis and breakdown of proteins. Low night temperature conserves [[glutamine]]; high night temperature increases accumulation of asparagine because of breakdown. Deficiency of K accentuates differences between long- and short-day plants. The pool of soluble nitrogen is much smaller than in well-nourished plants when N and P are deficient since uptake of nitrate and further reduction and conversion of N to organic forms is restricted more than is protein synthesis. Deficiencies of Ca, K, and S affect the conversion of organic N to protein more than uptake and reduction. The size of the pool of soluble N is no guide ''per se'' to growth rate, but the size of the pool in relation to total N might be a useful ratio in this regard. Nitrogen availability in the rooting medium also affects the size and structure of tracheids formed in the long lateral roots of white spruce (Krasowski and Owens 1999).&lt;ref name="kras"/&gt;

[[Microorganism]]s have a central role in almost all aspects of nitrogen availability, and therefore for life support on earth. Some bacteria can convert N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into ammonia by the process termed ''[[nitrogen fixation]]''; these bacteria are either free-living or form [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] associations with plants or other organisms (e.g., termites, protozoa), while other bacteria bring about transformations of [[ammonia]] to [[nitrate]], and of nitrate to N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or other nitrogen gases. Many [[bacteria]] and [[Fungus|fungi]] degrade organic matter, releasing fixed nitrogen for reuse by other organisms. All these processes contribute to the [[nitrogen cycle]].

====Phosphorus====
{{Further information|Phosphorus cycle}}

Like nitrogen, [[phosphorus]] is involved with many vital plant processes. Within a plant, it is present mainly as a structural component of the [[nucleic acid]]s: [[DNA|deoxyribonucleic acid]] (DNA) and [[RNA|ribonucleic acid]] (RNA), as well as a constituent of fatty [[phospholipid]]s, that are important in membrane development and function. It is present in both organic and inorganic forms, both of which are readily translocated within the plant. All energy transfers in the cell are critically dependent on phosphorus.  As with all living things, phosphorus is part of the [[Adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP), which is of immediate use in all processes that require energy with the cells. Phosphorus can also be used to modify the activity of various enzymes by [[phosphorylation]], and is used for [[cell signaling]]. Phosphorus is concentrated at the most actively growing points of a plant and stored within seeds in anticipation of their germination. Phosphorus is most commonly found in the soil in the form of polyprotic phosphoric acid (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), but is taken up most readily in the form of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO{{su|b=4|p=−}}. Phosphorus is available to plants in limited quantities in most soils because it is released very slowly from insoluble phosphates and is rapidly fixed once again. Under most environmental conditions it is the element that limits growth because of this constriction and due to its high demand by plants and microorganisms. Plants can increase phosphorus uptake by a mutualism with mycorrhiza.&lt;ref name="HunerHopkins2009"/&gt;
A [[Phosphorus deficiency]] in plants is characterized by an intense green coloration or reddening in leaves due to lack of chlorophyll. If the plant is experiencing high phosphorus deficiencies the leaves may become denatured and show signs of death. Occasionally the leaves may appear purple from an accumulation of [[anthocyanin]]. Because phosphorus is a mobile nutrient, older leaves will show the first signs of deficiency.

On some [[soil]]s, the phosphorus nutrition of some [[Pinophyta|conifers]], including the spruces, depends on the ability of [[mycorrhiza]]e to take up, and make soil phosphorus available to the tree, hitherto unobtainable to the non-mycorrhizal root. Seedling white spruce, greenhouse-grown in sand testing negative for phosphorus, were very small and purple for many months until spontaneous mycorrhizal inoculation, the effect of which was manifested by a greening of foliage and the development of vigorous shoot growth.

[[Phosphorus deficiency]] can produce symptoms similar to those of nitrogen deficiency,&lt;ref name="black" /&gt; but as noted by Russel:&lt;ref name="russ" /&gt; “Phosphate deficiency differs from nitrogen deficiency in being extremely difficult to diagnose, and crops can be suffering from extreme starvation without there being any obvious signs that lack of phosphate is the cause”. Russell’s observation applies to at least some [[Pinophyta|coniferous]] seedlings, but Benzian&lt;ref name="benz1965"/&gt; found that although response to phosphorus in very acid forest tree nurseries in England was consistently high, no species (including Sitka spruce) showed any visible symptom of deficiency other than a slight lack of lustre. Phosphorus levels have to be exceedingly low before visible symptoms appear in such seedlings. In sand culture at 0 ppm phosphorus, white spruce seedlings were very small and tinted deep purple; at 0.62 ppm, only the smallest seedlings were deep purple; at 6.2 ppm, the seedlings were of good size and color.&lt;ref name="swan4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="swan5"&gt;Swan, H.S.D. 1962. The scientific use of fertilizers in forestry. p. 13-24 ''in'' La Fertilisation Forestière au Canada. Fonds de Recherches Forestières, Laval Univ., Quebec QC, Bull. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

It is useful to apply a high phosphorus content fertilizer, such as bone meal, to perennials to help with successful root formation.&lt;ref name="HunerHopkins2009"/&gt;

====Potassium====

Unlike other major elements, [[potassium]] does not enter into the composition of any of the important plant constituents involved in metabolism,&lt;ref name="swan2" /&gt; but it does occur in all parts of plants in substantial amounts. It seems to be of particular importance in leaves and at growing points. Potassium is outstanding among the nutrient elements for its mobility and solubility within plant tissues. Processes involving potassium include the formation of [[carbohydrate]]s and [[protein]]s, the regulation of internal plant moisture, as a catalyst and condensing agent of complex substances, as an accelerator of enzyme action, and as contributor to [[photosynthesis]], especially under low light intensity.

[[Potassium]] regulates the opening and closing of the [[stomata]] by a potassium ion pump. Since stomata are important in water regulation, potassium regulates water loss from the leaves and increases [[drought]] tolerance. [[Potassium deficiency (plants)|Potassium deficiency]] may cause necrosis or interveinal chlorosis. The potassium ion (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) is highly mobile and can aid in balancing the anion (negative) charges within the plant. Potassium helps in fruit coloration, shape and also increases its [[brix]]. Hence, quality fruits are produced in potassium-rich soils. Potassium serves as an activator of enzymes used in photosynthesis and respiration.&lt;ref name="HunerHopkins2009"/&gt; Potassium is used to build cellulose and aids in photosynthesis by the formation of a chlorophyll precursor. [[Potassium deficiency (plants)|Potassium deficiency]] may result in higher risk of pathogens, wilting, chlorosis, brown spotting, and higher chances of damage from frost and heat.

When [[soil]]-potassium levels are high, plants take up more potassium than needed for healthy growth. The term ''luxury consumption'' has been applied to this. When potassium is moderately deficient, the effects first appear in the older tissues, and from there progress towards the growing points. Acute deficiency severely affects growing points, and die-back commonly occurs. Symptoms of potassium deficiency in white spruce include: browning and death of needles ([[chlorosis]]); reduced growth in height and diameter; impaired retention of needles; and reduced needle length.&lt;ref name="heib"/&gt; A relationship between potassium nutrition and cold resistance has been found in several tree species, including two species of spruce.&lt;ref name="sato"/&gt;

===Macronutrients (secondary and tertiary)===

====Sulfur====
[[Sulfur]] is a structural component of some amino acids (including [[cystein]] and [[methionine]]) and vitamins, and is essential for [[chloroplast]] growth and function; it is found in the iron-sulfur complexes of the electron transport chains in photosynthesis. It is needed for N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixation by legumes, and the conversion of nitrate into amino acids and then into protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haneklaus|first1=Silvia|last2=Bloem|first2=Elke|last3=Schnug|first3=Ewald|last4=de Kok|first4=Luit J.|last5=Stulen|first5=Ineke|editor1-last=Barker|editor1-first=Allen V.|editor2-last=Pilbeam|editor2-first=David J.|title=Handbook of plant nutrition|date=2007|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8247-5904-9|pages=183-238|url=https://books.google.co.za/books?id=ZWjLBQAAQBAJ&amp;q=sulfur#v=snippet&amp;q=sulfur&amp;f=false|accessdate=12 June 2017|chapter=Sulfur}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In plants, sulfur cannot be mobilized from older leaves for new growth, so deficiency symptoms are seen in the youngest tissues first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plant Nutrition|url=http://www.fao.org/ag/agp/agpc/doc/publicat/faobul4/faobul4/b402.htm|website=www.fao.org|accessdate=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms of deficiency include yellowing of leaves and stunted growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diagnosing sulphur deficiency in cereals|url=https://www.agric.wa.gov.au/mycrop/diagnosing-sulphur-deficiency-cereals|website=www.agric.wa.gov.au|accessdate=12 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Calcium====
[[Calcium]] regulates transport of other nutrients into the plant and is also involved in the activation of certain plant enzymes. [[Calcium deficiency (plant disorder)|Calcium deficiency]] results in stunting. This nutrient is involved in photosynthesis and plant structure.&lt;ref name="transport protein identified" /&gt;&lt;ref name=new-light /&gt; [[Calcium deficiency (plant disorder)|Blossom end rot]] is also a result of inadequate calcium.&lt;ref name="transport protein identified"/&gt;

Another common symptom of calcium deficiency in leaves is the curling of the leaf towards the veins or center of the leaf. Many times this can also have a blackened appearance&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simon|first=E. W.|date=1978-01-01|title=The Symptoms of Calcium Deficiency in Plants|jstor=2431629|journal=The New Phytologist|volume=80|issue=1|pages=1–15|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.1978.tb02259.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Calcium has been found to have a positive effect in combating salinity in soils. It has been shown to ameliorate the negative effects that salinity has such as reduced water usage of plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaya|first=C|last2=Kirnak|first2=H|last3=Higgs|first3=D|last4=Saltali|first4=K|date=2002-02-28|title=Supplementary calcium enhances plant growth and fruit yield in strawberry cultivars grown at high (NaCl) salinity|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304423801003132|journal=Scientia Horticulturae|volume=93|issue=1|pages=65–74|doi=10.1016/S0304-4238(01)00313-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calcium in plants occurs chiefly in the [[Leaf|leaves]], with lower concentrations in seeds, fruits, and roots. A major function is as a constituent of cell walls. When coupled with certain acidic compounds of the jelly-like pectins of the middle lamella, calcium forms an insoluble salt. It is also intimately involved in [[meristem]]s, and is particularly important in root development, with roles in cell division, cell elongation, and the detoxification of hydrogen ions. Other functions attributed to calcium are; the neutralization of organic acids; inhibition of some potassium-activated ions; and a role in nitrogen absorption. A notable feature of calcium-deficient plants is a defective root system.&lt;ref name="russ"/&gt; Roots are usually affected before above-ground parts.&lt;ref name="chap"/&gt;

====Magnesium====
{{Main article|Magnesium in biological systems}}

The outstanding role of [[magnesium]] in plant nutrition is as a constituent of the [[chlorophyll]] molecule. As a carrier, it is also involved in numerous enzyme reactions as an effective activator, in which it is closely associated with energy-supplying [[phosphorus]] compounds. Magnesium is very mobile in plants, and, like potassium, when [[Magnesium deficiency (plants)|deficient]] is translocated from older to younger tissues, so that signs of deficiency appear first on the oldest tissues and then spread progressively to younger tissues.

=== Micro-nutrients ===

Plants are able sufficiently to accumulate most trace elements. Some plants are sensitive indicators of the chemical environment in which they grow (Dunn 1991),&lt;ref name="dunn" /&gt; and some plants have barrier mechanisms that exclude or limit the uptake of a particular element or ion species, e.g., alder twigs commonly accumulate molybdenum but not arsenic, whereas the reverse is true of spruce bark (Dunn 1991).&lt;ref name="dunn" /&gt; Otherwise, a plant can integrate the geochemical signature of the soil mass permeated by its root system together with the contained groundwaters. Sampling is facilitated by the tendency of many elements to accumulate in tissues at the plant’s extremities.

====Iron====
[[Iron]] is necessary for photosynthesis and is present as an enzyme cofactor in plants. [[Iron deficiency (plant disorder)|Iron deficiency]] can result in interveinal [[chlorosis]] and [[necrosis]].
Iron is not a structural part of chlorophyll but very much essential for its synthesis. Copper deficiency can be responsible for promoting an iron deficiency.&lt;ref name=Ruhr2012 /&gt;
It helps in the electron transport of plant.

====Molybdenum====
[[Molybdenum]] is a cofactor to enzymes important in building amino acids and is involved in nitrogen metabolism. Molybdenum is part of the [[nitrate reductase]] enzyme (needed for the reduction of nitrate) and the [[nitrogenase]] enzyme (required for [[biological nitrogen fixation]]).&lt;ref name="Roy2006Chapter3"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roy|first1=R.N.|last2=Finck|first2=A.|last3=Blair|first3=G.J.|last4=Tandon|first4=H.L.S.|title=Plant nutrition for food security: a guide for integrated nutrient management|date=2006|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|location=Rome|isbn=92-5-105490-8|pages=25–42|url=ftp://ftp.fao.org/agl/agll/docs/fpnb16.pdf|accessdate=20 June 2016|chapter=Chapter 3: Plant nutrients and basics of plant nutrition}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reduced productivity as a result of [[Molybdenum deficiency (plant disorder)|molybdenum deficiency]] is usually associated with the reduced activity of one or more of these enzymes.

====Boron====
{{Multiple issues|section=yes|
{{Overly detailed|section=yes|date=July 2016}}
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}
{{original research section|date=July 2016}}
}}
[[Boron]] is absorbed by plants in the form of the anion BO{{su|b=3|p=3−}}. It is available to plants in moderately soluble mineral forms of Ca, Mg and Na borates and the highly soluble form of organic compounds. It is available to plants over a range of pH, from 5.0 to 7.5. It is mobile in the soil, hence, it is prone to leaching. Leaching removes substantial amounts of boron in sandy soil, but little in fine silt or clay soil. Boron's fixation to those minerals at high pH can render boron unavailable, while low pH frees the fixed boron, leaving it prone to leaching in wet climates. It precipitates with other minerals in the form of borax in which form it was first used over 400 years ago as a soil supplement. Decomposition of organic material causes boron to be deposited in the topmost soil layer. When soil dries it can cause a precipitous drop in the availability of boron to plants as the plants cannot draw nutrients from that desiccated layer. Hence, boron deficiency diseases appear in dry weather.

Boron has many functions within a plant: it affects flowering and fruiting, pollen germination, cell division, and active salt absorption. The metabolism of amino acids and proteins, carbohydrates, calcium, and water are strongly affected by boron. Many of those listed functions may be embodied by its function in moving the highly polar sugars through cell membranes by reducing their polarity and hence the energy needed to pass the sugar. If sugar cannot pass to the fastest growing parts rapidly enough, those parts die.

Boron is not relocatable in the plant via the [[phloem]]. It must be supplied to the growing parts via the [[xylem]]. Foliar sprays affect only those parts sprayed, which may be insufficient for the fastest growing parts, and is very temporary.

Boron is essential for the proper forming and strengthening of cell walls. Lack of boron results in short thick cells producing stunted fruiting bodies and roots. Calcium to boron ratio must be maintained in a narrow range for normal plant growth.  For alfalfa, that calcium to boron ratio must be from 80:1 to 600:1. Boron deficiency appears at 800:1 and higher. Boron levels within plants differ with plant species and range from 2.3 mg/kg for barley to 94.7 mg/kg for poppy. Lack of boron causes failure of calcium metabolism which produces hollow heart in beets and peanuts.

Inadequate amounts of boron affect many agricultural crops, legume forage crops most strongly.  Of the micronutrients, boron deficiencies are second most common after zinc. Deficiency results in the death of the terminal growing points and stunted growth.

Boron supplements derive from dry lake bed deposits such as those in Death Valley, USA, in the form of [[sodium tetraborate]] (borax), from which less soluble calcium borate is made. Foliar sprays are used on fruit crop trees in soils of high alkalinity. Boron is often applied to fields as a contaminant in other soil amendments but is not generally adequate to make up the rate of loss by cropping. The rates of application of borate to produce an adequate alfalfa crop range from 15 pounds per acre for a sandy-silt, acidic soil of low organic matter, to 60 pounds per acre for a soil with high organic matter, high cation exchange capacity and high pH.

Boron concentration in soil water solution higher than one ppm is toxic to most plants. Toxic concentrations within plants are 10 to 50 ppm for small grains and 200 ppm in boron-tolerant crops such as sugar beets, rutabaga, cucumbers, and conifers.  Toxic soil conditions are generally limited to arid regions or can be caused by underground borax deposits in contact with water or volcanic gases dissolved in percolating water. Application rates should be limited to a few pounds per acre in a test plot to determine if boron is needed generally. Otherwise, testing for boron levels in plant material is required to determine remedies. Excess boron can be removed by irrigation and assisted by application of elemental sulfur to lower the pH and increase boron solubility.

Boron deficiencies can be detected by analysis of plant material to apply a correction before the obvious symptoms appear, after which it is too late to prevent crop loss. Strawberries deficient in boron will produce lumpy fruit; apricots will not blossom or, if they do, will not fruit or will drop their fruit depending on the level of boron deficit. Broadcast of boron supplements is effective and long term; a foliar spray is immediate but must be repeated.

====Copper====
[[Copper]] is important for photosynthesis. Symptoms for copper deficiency include chlorosis.It is involved in many enzyme processes; necessary for proper photosynthesis; involved in the manufacture of lignin (cell walls) and involved in grain production. It is also hard to find in some soil conditions.

====Manganese====
[[Manganese]] is necessary for photosynthesis,&lt;ref name=new-light /&gt; including the building of [[chloroplast]]s. [[Manganese deficiency (plant)|Manganese deficiency]] may result in coloration abnormalities, such as discolored spots on the [[foliage]].

====Sodium====
[[Sodium]] is involved in the regeneration of [[phosphoenolpyruvate]] in [[Crassulacean acid metabolism|CAM]] and [[C4 carbon fixation|C4]] plants. Sodium can potentially replace potassium's regulation of stomatal opening and closing.&lt;ref name="HunerHopkins2009"/&gt;

Essentiality of sodium:
* Essential for C4 plants rather C3
* Substitution of K by Na: Plants can be classified into four groups:
# Group A—a high proportion of K can be replaced by Na and stimulate the growth, which cannot be achieved by the application of K
# Group B—specific growth responses to Na are observed but they are much less distinct
# Group C—Only minor substitution is possible and Na has no effect
# Group D—No substitution occurs
* Stimulate the growth—increase leaf area and stomata. Improves the water balance
* Na functions in metabolism
# C4 metabolism
# Impair the conversion of pyruvate to phosphoenol-pyruvate
# Reduce the photosystem II activity and ultrastructural changes in mesophyll chloroplast
* Replacing K functions
# Internal osmoticum
# Stomatal function
# Photosynthesis
# Counteraction in long distance transport
# Enzyme activation
* Improves the crop quality e.g. improves the taste of carrots by increasing sucrose

====Zinc====
[[Zinc]] is required in a large number of enzymes and plays an essential role in [[Transcription_(biology)|DNA transcription]]. A typical symptom of [[Zinc deficiency (plant disorder)|zinc deficiency]] is the stunted growth of leaves, commonly known as "little leaf" and is caused by the oxidative degradation of the growth hormone [[auxin]].

====Nickel====
In [[vascular plant|higher plants]], [[nickel]] is absorbed by plants in the form of Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion. Nickel is essential for activation of [[urease]], an enzyme involved with [[nitrogen metabolism]] that is required to process urea. Without nickel, toxic levels of urea accumulate, leading to the formation of necrotic lesions. In [[lower plants]], nickel activates several enzymes involved in a variety of processes, and can substitute for zinc and iron as a cofactor in some enzymes.&lt;ref name="BarkerPilbeam2007" /&gt;

====Chlorine====
[[Chlorine]], as compounded chloride, is necessary for [[osmosis]] and [[ionic balance]]; it also plays a role in [[photosynthesis]].

====Cobalt====
[[Cobalt]] has proven to be beneficial to at least some plants although it does not appear to be essential for most species.&lt;ref name="BarkerPilbeam2015" /&gt; It has, however, been shown to be essential for [[nitrogen fixation]] by the nitrogen-fixing bacteria associated with [[legumes]] and other plants.&lt;ref name="BarkerPilbeam2015" /&gt;

====Aluminium====
Aluminum is one of the few elements capable of making soil more acidic. This is achieved by aluminum taking hydroxide ions out of water, leaving hydrogen ions behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mossor-Pietraszewska|first=Teresa|year=2001|title=Effect of aluminium on plant growth and metabolism|url=http://www.actabp.pl/pdf/3_2001/673-686s.pdf|journal=Acta Biochimica Polonica|volume=48|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the soil is more acidic, which makes it unlivable for many plants. Another consequence of aluminum in soils is aluminum toxicity, which inhibits root growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Delhaize|first=Emmanuel|year=1995|title=Aluminum Toxicity and Tolerance in Plants|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC157131/pdf/1070315.pdf|journal=Update on Environmental Stress|volume=107|pages=315–321|via=|pmc=157131|pmid=12228360|doi=10.1104/pp.107.2.315}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Tea has a high tolerance for [[aluminum]] (Al) toxicity and the growth is stimulated by Al application. The possible reason is the prevention of Cu, Mn or P toxicity effects.
* There have been reports that Al may serve as a fungicide against certain types of [[root rot]].

====Silicon====
[[Silicon]] is not considered an essential element for plant growth and development. It is always found in abundance in the environment and hence if needed it is available. It is found in the structures of plants and improves the health of plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://canadianwollastonite.com/soil-amendments/silicon-plant-health/|title=Wollastonite as a soil ammendment|website=canadianwollastonite.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170421092532/http://canadianwollastonite.com/soil-amendments/silicon-plant-health/|archive-date=2017-04-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In plants, [[silicon]] has been shown in experiments to strengthen [[cell wall]]s, improve plant strength, health, and productivity.&lt;ref name=PHC /&gt; There have been studies showing evidence of silicon improving [[drought]] and [[frost]] resistance, decreasing [[lodging]] potential and boosting the plant's natural pest and disease fighting systems.&lt;ref name=Bangalore /&gt; Silicon has also been shown to improve plant vigor and physiology by improving root mass and density, and increasing above ground plant [[biomass]] and [[crop yield]]s.&lt;ref name=PHC /&gt;  Silicon is currently under consideration by the Association of American Plant Food Control Officials (AAPFCO) for elevation to the status of a "plant beneficial substance".&lt;ref name=AAPFCO2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=presentation /&gt;

====Vanadium====
[[Vanadium]] may be required by some plants, but at very low concentrations. It may also be substituting for [[molybdenum]].

====Selenium====
[[Selenium]] is probably not essential for flowering plants, but it can be beneficial; it can stimulate plant growth, improve tolerance of oxidative stress, and increase resistance to pathogens and herbivory.&lt;ref name="White2016" /&gt;

Selenium is, however, an essential mineral element for animal (including human) nutrition and [[Selenium deficiency|selenium deficiencies]] are known to occur when food or animal feed is grown on selenium-deficient soils. The use of inorganic selenium fertilizers can increase selenium concentrations in edible crops and animal diets thereby improving animal health.&lt;ref name="White2016" /&gt;

==Nutrient deficiency==

The effect of a nutrient deficiency can vary from a subtle depression of growth rate to obvious stunting, deformity, discoloration, distress, and even death. Visual symptoms distinctive enough to be useful in identifying a deficiency are rare. Most deficiencies are multiple and moderate. However, while a deficiency is seldom that of a single nutrient, nitrogen is commonly the nutrient in shortest supply.

[[Chlorosis]] of foliage is not always due to mineral nutrient deficiency. Solarization can produce superficially similar effects, though mineral deficiency tends to cause premature defoliation, whereas solarization does not, nor does solarization depress nitrogen concentration.&lt;ref name="ronco" /&gt;

==Nutrient status of plants==

Nutrient status (mineral nutrient and trace element composition, also called ionome and nutrient profile) of plants are commonly portrayed by tissue elementary analysis. Interpretation of the results of such studies, however, has been controversial.&lt;ref name="parent" /&gt; During the last decades the nearly two-century-old “law of minimum” or “Liebig's law” (that states that plant growth is controlled not by the total amount of resources available, but by the scarcest resource) has been replaced by several mathematical approaches that use different models in order to take the interactions between the individual nutrients into account. The latest developments in this field are based on the fact that the nutrient elements (and compounds) do not act independently from each other;&lt;ref name="parent" /&gt; Baxter, 2015,&lt;ref name="baxter"&gt;Baxter, I. 2015. Should we treat the ionome as a combination of individual elements, or should we be deriving novel combined traits? J. Exp. Bot. 66, 2127–2131. doi:10.1093/jxb/erv040&lt;/ref&gt; because there may be direct chemical interactions between them or they may influence each other’s uptake, translocation, and biological action via a number of mechanisms as exemplified for the case of ammonia.&lt;ref name="parent"&gt;Parent, S.-E. et al. 2013. The plant ionome revisited by the nutrient balance concept. Front. Plant Sci. 4. doi:10.3389/fpls.2013.00039&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plant nutrition in agricultural systems==

===Hydroponics===
[[Hydroponics]] is a method for growing plants in a water-nutrient solution without the use of nutrient-rich soil. It allows researchers and home gardeners to grow their plants in a controlled environment. The most common solution is the [[Hoagland solution]], developed by D. R. Hoagland in 1933. The solution consists of all the essential nutrients in the correct proportions necessary for most plant growth.&lt;ref name="HunerHopkins2009"/&gt; An aerator is used to prevent an [[Anoxic waters|anoxic]] event or hypoxia. [[Hypoxia (environmental)|Hypoxia]] can affect nutrient uptake of a plant because, without oxygen present, respiration becomes inhibited within the root cells. The [[nutrient film technique]] is a hydroponic technique in which the roots are not fully submerged. This allows for adequate aeration of the roots, while a "film" thin layer of nutrient-rich water is pumped through the system to provide nutrients and water to the plant.

'''Prodesis''' was a development project in the [[Lacandon region]] of [[Chiapas]], [[Mexico]], that ran from 2004 to 2008.&lt;!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:Mexico+Chiapas+Prodesis.jpg|thumb|right]] --&gt;
The aim of the project was to reduce pressure on the rainforest and combat poverty among its inhabitants, most of them being [[Maya peoples|Mayan Indians]] and [[Subsistence agriculture|subsistence peasants]].

== Plan and objectives ==

'''Prodesis''' is an abbreviation of the Spanish name for the programme:&lt;br /&gt;
''Proyecto de Desarrollo Social Integrado y Sostenible, Chiapas, Mexico''&lt;br /&gt;
(''Integrated and Sustainable Social Development Project, Chiapas, Mexico'').

Its overall objectives were:[http://www.prodesis.chiapas.gob.mx/?Plan_Global_y_Planes_Operativos_Anuales]
# [[poverty reduction]] among the inhabitants of the [[Lacandon region]]
# reduction of the pressure on the [[natural resources]] and mitigation of [[environmental degradation]]
# reformulation of [[Chiapas conflict#Social development policies|social development policies in Chiapas]], with emphasis on [[Participatory democracy|participative]] and [[Sustainable development|sustainable]] territorial development

These goals should stimulate a sense of [[citizenship]], and enhance the relation between the [[Chiapas]] government and the 155,000 inhabitants of the 830 communities located around the protected area of the [[Lacandon Jungle]]: the [[Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve]]. This population, which is mainly [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] and [[Subsistence agriculture|rural]], has the highest levels of [[poverty]] and [[marginalization]] in the State of Chiapas, and of [[Mexico]] as a whole.

''Prodesis'' was a continuation the ''Integral Programme for the Sustainable Development of the Selva Lacandon Forest'' ([[Chiapas conflict#Social development policies|PIDSS]]), which in turn was a continuation of [[Chiapas conflict#Social development policies|Plan Cañadas]].

As re-formulated on start-up in 2003, ''Prodesis'' focussed on 16 of the 34 micro-regions identified by  [[Chiapas conflict#Social development policies|PIDSS]]. These "micro-regions" were defined by suitability for particular approaches to social and economic development and included Agua Azul, Avellanal, Amador Hernández, Betania, Benemerito de las Américas, Carmen Villaflores, Comunidad Lacandona, Damasco, Francisco I Madero, Maravilla Tenejapa, Marqués de Comillas, Nahá, Nuevo Francisco León, Nuevo Huixtán, Rio Blanco, and Santo Domingo.

== Financing, organization, implementation and evaluation ==
The project was a cooperation between the state of [[Chiapas]] and the [[European Union]] ([[European Union|EU]]), and was budgeted for €31.000.000, of which €16.000.000 was invested by the state of Chiapas. The [[European Union|EU]] contributed €15.000.000 through [[EuropeAid]]. The European project (or agreement) code is ALA/B7-310/2003/5756.

The history of PRODESIS stretches back to 1996 when a mission of 4 consultants visited Mexico and carried out an area appraisal to prepare a proposal for a Euro 5 million project to be carried out between SEMARNAP and the EC (Teyssier, Capietto and de Agostini, 1996). In late 1998 SEMARNAP responded to a set of key issues that had been raised by the EC Delegation in 1997, presented a reformulated proposal and requested that renewed consideration be given to the Project.
 
The 1996 proposal was appraised by a further mission, carried out in September 1999, made up of Dr. Alastair White (anthropologist and socioeconomist) and Torsten Mark Kowal (rural development forester and climate/environmental scientist), working for LTS Consultants, Scotland, UK. They reported on the ongoing feasibility of the Project as designed in 1996 through: (i) fact-finding to identify substantive changes in the socio-economic and political context; (ii) analysis of the logic and applicability of the original approach; (iii) appraisal of the probability of fulfilment of basic conditions, identified in 1996 as prerequisites for successful project implementation. The re-designed project was proposed to EU Aide Attaches in Sept 1999 and to EuropeAid in Brussels. The main points in the re-design were to require local project-orientated planning processes within all components to supersede the ambitious participatory planning component proposed in 1996; and emphasis was placed on defining options for achievable changes in land-use, for training specific groups in the alternative land use and microenterprises options, and for linking up community-level projects with credit and other funding sources. 

From 2000 to 2003 the project then awaited improvements in the social and political context, as well as due process by the EC and the Mexican Government. The go-ahead for Prodesis was agreed in 2001. Preparations and consultations started in 2002, and the final contract was signed December 2003. 

Following formal approval, given all the elapsed time, it was necessary to re-design the project yet again, and this was done by Dieter Paas and Arturo Arreola, once the project was tendered for European Technical Assistance in 2003.[http://www.prodesis.chiapas.gob.mx] However, it is unclear how far the White/Kowal recommendations were accepted; nor is it evident how many of the changes proposed in 1999 to the 1996 proposal were then taken on board during the 2003 re-design once the project formally started up. No internet references exist that describe these inputs and their role. 

The project started in 2004 and initially was expected to run until 2007, but due to delays related to modifications of the project plan and financial issues between the EU and Mexico, the project then continued for an extra year until September 2008.

Prodesis was carried out by SeDeSol (Secretariat of Social Development of the State of Chiapas), and its director was Rodolfo Diaz Sarvide.&lt;br /&gt;
Christian Bouteille was the (European) head of the International Technical Assistance. The European Delegation in Mexico-City [http://www.delmex.ec.europa.eu/] was responsible for the European involvement in the project.

Despite some progress and the benefits resulting from the Prodesis investment,in 2008 a classified evaluation report, ordered by the European Commission, and conducted by IBF International Consulting in collaboration with B.A.a Consultors (Piero Di Giacinto, Jan Karremans, Thomas Pijnenburg) concluded that Prodesis had not achieved all its objectives. 

These strong criticisms were summarised by independent sources and can be read here [http://www.expresionlibre.org/site2/estados/noti_0642.php] or here [http://eljustoreclamo.blogspot.com/2008/01/chiapas-operacin-fracaso-comunidades.html]. A further clear set of criticisms are summarised here [https://web.archive.org/web/20110722230208/http://www.rmalc.org.mx/documentos/libros/libro%20EU-boell.pdf] that take Prodesis as a case study.

On the 13th and 14 October 2008 the 8th meeting of the Joint Committee (established Under the EU-Mexico Economic Partnership) Political Coordination and Cooperation Agreement (Global Agreement) was held in Mexico City. Regarding the session on cooperation it was stated that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;

"Both parties took note of the progress achieved in current projects in the fields of social development, economic cooperation and science and technology. The parties furthermore underlined the positive results of PRODESIS implementation and agreed to explore the possibility of continuing it with a second phase in the 2007-2013 Cooperation Programme."[http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/08/st14/st14478.en08.pdf]
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In early 2009 it was decided that Prodesis was not going to be continued with a second phase in the Cooperation Programme.

== Historical background of European involvement ==

Prodesis was signed within the framework of the [[Free Trade Agreement]] and [[Association Agreement]] between the [[European Union]] and [[Mexico]]:[https://web.archive.org/web/20090309205444/http://ec.europa.eu/external_relations/mexico/index_en.htm]

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The new agreement should lead to liberalization of trade and investment between Mexico and the EU [...but also to...] greater social equality and a political system that is genuinely democratic and pluralist and respects human rights. [...] This agreement opens the door to a wide range of potential cooperation activities between the parties, and will allow '''the EU to provide Mexico with financial and technical assistance for such social programmes as action against poverty, regional development, and cooperation in the field of human rights and protection of indigenous communities'''. [...] With regard to the current political context in Mexico, the discussions on the new agreement are going hand-in-hand in Mexico with a complex internal political process of democratization and reform. [...] '''The process of reform currently underway is also being hindered by a range of other factors such as [...] the [[Chiapas conflict|conflict in Chiapas]], the activities of [[EZLN|guerilla movements]] in a number of other areas and the human rights situation, one of the most dramatic recent examples being the massacre which occurred in [[Acteal massacre|Acteal]] on 22 December 1997 and which was strongly condemned by Parliament in its resolution of 15 January 1998.''' [...] The 1997 agreements [...] include a '''democracy clause''' or '''human rights clause''' as an essential component. This was a stumbling block to the signing of the framework agreement in 1991. Nevertheless, the difficulties which have arisen in the context of the transition process in Mexico have highlighted the importance of the ''democracy clause''. [...] Parliament therefore considered it vital that the ''democracy clause'' be included in the new agreement and that the applicability of the agreement would be conditional on strict respect for that clause."[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//NONSGML+REPORT+A4-1998-0156+0+DOC+PDF+V0//EN]

== Criticism of Prodesis ==
On January 23, 2004 an article in the Mexican newspaper ''La Jornada''[http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2004/01/24/010n3pol.php?printver=1&amp;fly=1] reported that in the community of Nuevo San Rafael in the Lacandon forest, 23 houses were burned down and that the victims were chased into the jungle. February 3 Mexican news magazine Proceso suggested a link with a cooperation programme between Mexico and the EU.[http://www.proceso.com.mx/noticias_articulo.php?articulo=21506] On several Indymedia-sites [http://www.indymedia.org/it/2004/01/110358.shtml] and other news and community sites around the world it was soon suggested that the violence was perpetrated by the [[Mexican Army]] against the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] [[Ch'ol people|Ch'ol]] tribe, and that the [[European Union|EU]] was involved in relation to [[Plan Puebla Panamá]]. Before the project even got started Prodesis was already accused of being a [[counter-insurgency]] project aimed at getting rid of the local population to gain control over the regions' [[natural resources]].

Based on this information Member of the [[European Parliament]] Erik Meijer posed a question (E-0546/04, 26-2-2004) to the [[European Commission]] ([[Prodesis#Questions about Prodesis in the European Parliament|see below]]).

Since early 2004 numerous critical articles (varying in factuality) about Prodesis have been published in Mexican newspapers (mainly [[La Jornada]]), magazines (Proceso [http://www.proceso.com.mx/busqueda.php?fuente=h&amp;b=chiapas%20operaci%F3n%20fracaso], Contralínea [http://www.contralinea.com.mx/]), and on websites of local and international [[NGO]]'s.

On the 9th of February 2007 58 representants of communities in the [[Lacandon region]] signed the [[Declaration of Moxviquil]] in which they demanded the project to be suspended. The most important reasons stated in the document were that they were not properly informed about the project, which is a violation of [[Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989|ILO convention 169]] [https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20111031202527/http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/cgi-lex/convde.pl?C169] and the [[Mexican Constitution#Article 2|Mexican Constitution (art.2)]]. Another reason was that they did not see any serious effort in real social development, only some subsidies for cement, tin roofs, chickens and crops. After they had offered the declaration to the director of Prodesis and the head of the European Delegation in Mexico-City, some of those who signed the declaration were threatened by Prodesis staff: if they would stand by their signature, they would not receive any kind of government support anymore (like ''opportunidades'' or ''procampo'').

== Historical background and previous development projects ==

Also please see more about the socio-political context in the [[Lacandon region]], and the predecessor-projects of Prodesis, '''[[Chiapas conflict]]'''.

Until the 1950s, the Selva Lacandona covered an area of about 1.3 million hectares (13,000 km2). By the mid-1990s the pristine forest had been reduced to about 400,000 or at most 450,000 ha. The Lacandón Indians, who until the 1950s were the still the only inhabitants of the Selva Lacandona, were then only about 600 persons, having been reduced from much larger numbers by the diseases brought in the late nineteenth century to which they had no immunity, brought by the mahogany cutters who first penetrated the area. The Lacandones by late last century numbered about 800. Due to demographic pressure, since the late 1950s and especially in the 1970s, about 80,000 other Indians originating in the highlands of Chiapas have occupied parts of the forest area. They are mainly [[Tzeltal people|Tzeltals]] (56% of the present population), with some Tojolabales (17%), Chols (11%) and Tzotzils (2%). 

The small Maya Lacandón communities were outside the monetary economy until recent decades and their main monetary income today comes from the sale of craft items. In 1972, as part of a state government manoeuvre in relation to timber extraction, the Lacandones were granted formal ownership of the 614,000 hectares of the ‘Bienes Comunales Lacandones’ then established, but in 1978 were obliged to share this with some 15,000 Tzeltal and Chol settlers then granted communal rights.  The majority of Lacandones do not possess cattle so have little negative impact on the forest, whereas in all the other communities, a better-off part of the population owns some beef-cattle, constituting an important form of saving and investment. Cattle are managed extensively, each head requiring about a hectare of land, and forest areas are frequently converted to pasture.
 
Marqués de Comillas, previously part of the Selva Lacandona forest, began to be settled by the same Indian groups in the 1970s. Then it was colonised in 1974-86 by settlers coming largely from other Mexican states, though the ejidos that were then formed absorbed the already-settled Tzeltal and other Chiapas Indian groups. Some 10-15% of the total population of the Selva Lacandona area are now mestizos (non-Indians) concentrated in Marqués de Comillas. At the time of settlement, the only communications were by river and by air, and some of the settlers left in the early years finding themselves unsuited to the pioneer life. As a result of the early unattractiveness of the area, the generation of settlers was able to obtain larger areas of land than the 20 hectares usually available to ejidatarios (heads of family on land distributed under the Mexican agrarian reform laws) elsewhere, with 50 hectares a common allocation. However, the interior of the Marqués de Comillas triangle remains poorly served by roads, and this has affected the growth of the communities where substantial concentrations of poverty are still found. 

Between about 1958 and 1986, both the Chiapas State and Federal governments either actively or passively favoured migration to “undeveloped” forest-land. The Chiapas state government looked favourably upon the migration of Indians to the Selva Lacandona, as it tended to reduce the pressure on land and particularly the demands for land reforms in parts of Chiapas where a latifundio system predominated. In the early 1960s and in 1974-86 two periods of federal government-sponsored colonisation occurred, the latter focused on Marqués de Comillas. This was a question of relieving pressures on the land elsewhere in the country.

Until 1986, government policy was by no means clearly oriented to protecting the forest. State-led exploitation of the forest’s precious woods was managed by COFOLASA/CORFO during the 1970s and 80s (cedar and particularly mahogany), as against private companies with largely North American capital who first entered the region in the 1850s. Valuable timber was extracted in this period from areas within the areas formally owned by the Comunidad Lacandona, as well as from Marqués de Comillas, as COFOLASA/CORFO was most active during the period of maximum conversion of forest for agriculture as colonisation proceeded.

Between the mid-1970s and 1986 agricultural and forestry policies continued to be inconsistent. Government statements and actions included both support for maintaining the forest (e.g. the proclamation of the Biosphere Reserve of Montes Azules in 1978); and support for activities which would have the opposite effect (e.g. legalisation of landholdings on the western side of the forest, and the opening-up of Marqués de Comillas with credit support for cattle, as well as state-sponsored oil exploration). Efforts to promote sustainable timber production in Marqués de Comillas began in 1987 and, after a Chiapas State ban on timber extraction from 1990 to 1994, restarted in 1995.

Since 1987 there has been an overall consistent policy of discouraging, if not preventing new settlement. The negotiated departure has been sought of those settled within the Biosphere Reserve post-1978 without land-rights. 

Government policy, as executed by a variety of state and federal authorities since the early 90s, has broadly sought to encourage a shift to sustainable agriculture so as not to make further inroads into the forest, but without great success due to weaknesses in conception and implementation - including the lack of participatory agricultural extension as proposed should be the methods used by PRODESIS. 

During the mid-1990s, SEMARNAP had established environmentally-orientated subsidies for maize cultivation (termed ‘milpa sedentarizada’), to prevent the burning of cut-over forest or reclaimed fallow, and to stop annual burns of weeds and crop residues. However,  the quota of families to receive these subsidies in each community is usually limited and the money typically arrives very late, which greatly reduces the incentive effect. Subsidies in money and kind are also given for other crops (coffee, organic vegetables, and saplings for timber plantations), but are subject to the same limitations. Inputs have also been given for minor animal husbandry projects. Numerous small economic projects for particular communities have been implemented with a low success rate, as little participatory planning was practised, and there has been little training of community members in the management of such projects.

State intervention patterns have created a situation in which government funds have become an important potential source of direct income, and this has affected local attitudes and behaviour. Communities wait and call for government schemes before taking action and can become disinclined to take local initiatives. A ‘dependency syndrome’ has developed that is often pronounced among the poorer communities, for which the government funds assume greater significance relative to their earnings from production. At least in some communities (Nueva Palestina) the incipient differentiation and the availability of government funds has led to tensions within the community: as to whether funds should go the better-off to further their entrepreneurial activities, or be reserved for the more disadvantaged sections of the community.

== Criticism of Prodesis and European involvement in the historical context ==

Despite the considerable development and biodiversity justifications for setting-up Prodesis, like its predecessor-projects [[Chiapas conflict#Social development policies|PIDSS]] and [[Chiapas conflict#Social development policies|Plan Cañadas]], was perceived by (a part of) the population and [[NGO]]'s (local as well as international) as a [[counter-insurgency]] "light" project. 

Something that sustained this scepticism was the fact that Prodesis focussed extensively on the demographic aspects of ''"[[The Chiapas Problem]]"'', and hardly referred to the socio-political history of the area where Prodesis was implemented. By blaming the [[Chiapas conflict]] on overpopulation in a vulnerable environment, but avoiding political issues connecting to the [[EZLN]], the [[San Andrés Accords]], and the diluted [[Cocopa law]] of 2001, many felt these core issues were not being taken seriously by the EC intervention. 

In particular, Prodesis has found it hard to deal with: (i) the delicate issue of "illegal" settlements within the nucleus of the Reserve; (ii) the considerable tensions between ethnic groups; and (iii) the extremely polarized political allegiances that are found in the area. Ensuring  participation in project design and management of the Lacandon people, other indigenous groups, and their organisations, was especially difficult.   

Criticism on Prodesis in relation to [[counter-insurgency]] or [[low intensity conflict]] can be broadly divided along 3 dimensions:

1] in relation to the history of [[marginalization]] of [[Maya peoples#Chiapas|indigenous people]] and [[Subsistence agriculture|landless peasants]] in Chiapas

2] in relation to the history of [[Chiapas conflict#Social development policies|social development policy in Chiapas]]

3] in relation to [[globalization]], [[Plan Puebla Panama]] and the European involvement in Prodesis

Many do believe that, under the guise of a development project (aimed at poverty reduction and protecting the environment), Europe's real motive to cooperate in Prodesis would be to secure European trade and investment in Mexico. Since social or political instability (or perceived instability) would pose a threat to the economic partnership, the EU would contribute to a [[counter-insurgency]] project. 

This would contradict Prodesis' emphasis on [[Grassroots democracy|participative democracy]]. (for a similar argument see also [[Riordan Roett|the Zapatista memo]]). Hence the allegations of a new [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Conquista]] by means of [[neo-liberal]] policies and [[Foreign direct investment|direct foreign investment]]. Communications from the EU itself have encouraged these ideas. Some quotes:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

"The Commission wants to create a climate favourable to trade and investment. [...] It is in the EU’s interest to develop and consolidate its market positions and to pursue a dynamic investment policy. [...] The current challenge is to find a way to facilitate trade and European investment in Latin America. The Commission’s aim is to encourage the development of a legal climate to attract European investments and guarantee the predictability and security of these investments In the WTO framework […] contributing to the development of a stable and predictable framework to help the Latin American countries attract more European investment." [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52005SC1590:EN:HTML Strategy for a stronger partnership between the European Union and Latin America]

"There are destabilising factors that could ultimately jeopardize growth and European investments, and thereby affect the biregional partnership. [...] They jeopardise growth and economic development. [...] These relate, in particular to the '''Chiapas problem''' and the integration of the marginalized population groups and the country’s '''indigenous communities''' in general. These potential '''instability factors''' bring with them a cost (lack of security for companies, a distorted image abroad, especially in Europe) and may '''represent important barriers to''' the general development of the country, and in particular to '''attracting European trade and investment'''."

== Questions about Prodesis in the European Parliament ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Tzixcao1.jpg|thumb|right|click to enlarge]] --&gt;
26-2-2004: MEP '''[[Erik Meijer (politician)|Erik Meijer]], question E-0546/04'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Is the Commission aware that, according to the Mexican newspaper La Jornada of 3 February 2004, five non-governmental organisations in the south-eastern state of Chiapas consider the European Union to have been involved in an attack on the village of Nuevo San Rafael, controlled by the Zapatista movement and occupied by members of the Chol tribe, in the remote nature reserve of Montes Azules, which consists of primeval forest, on 19 or 22 January, in which attack 23 houses were set on fire, the occupants fled, the village was permanently cut off from the outside world by soldiers and the land is being returned to the former big land-owners to enable them to fell the primeval forest? [...] Was this attack encouraged by the fact that the EU has concluded an agreement concerning a development project worth € 15.000.000 with governor Pablo Salazar, possibly in part in connection with Plan Puebla Panama, which comprises major infrastructure projects in Central America from Panama to nine poor federal states in Mexico, which require the indigenous Indian population to make way for newcomers and to enable the land to be put to new uses or at least compel that population to give up the autonomy which it in practice enjoys?"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

30-3-2004: Commissioner '''[[Chris Patten#European Commissioner|Chris Patten]], answer E-0546/04'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The Economic Partnership, Political Coordination and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and Mexico states in its first article that the: Respect for democratic principles and fundamental human rights, proclaimed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, underpins the domestic and external policies of both Parties and constitutes an essential element of this Agreement. The Commission at all times ensures that its actions are consistent with this article. The Commission recently signed a Financing Agreement with Mexico for the Integrated and Sustainable Social Development Project in Chiapas, Mexico. Implementation of this project has not yet begun, but is
expected to start in the coming months. [...] The project was designed with the input and participation of local stakeholders who will continue to participate in the planning and implementation process, in particular through the Micro-regional Councils (Consejos microregionales) who represent the local communities. The project is not part of the Plan Puebla Panama (PPP). It has been reported that some local communities and governments in the South/Southeast of Mexico criticise the PPP as a top-down initiative with supposedly inadequate consultation of local stakeholders. The Commission is aware of the press reports in question, and considers any suggestion of EU involvement in any act of violence in Chiapas or elsewhere to be utterly without foundation. [...] There is certainly no evidence to suggest that the reported attack was encouraged by the signing of the financing agreement for this project."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

6-1-2005: MEP '''[[Eva Lichtenberger]], question E-3589/04'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Parliament has received news that the indigenous people and those in the rural areas around Montes Azules have not been duly informed about the project and there is a great deal of mistrust. [...] Do the representatives elected to work on the project have Community support? [...] What will happen to communities which refuse to take part in this project? [...] How will support for the project be assessed in this highly militarised and conflictive region? [...] There are many displaced persons in the area of Montes Azules. What connection is there between the above project and a possible relocation of settlements for the displaced?"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

24-2-2005: Commissioner '''[[Benita Ferrero-Waldner]], answer E-3589/04''' (in French [http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getAllAnswers.do?reference=E-2004-3589&amp;language=FR] and German [http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getAllAnswers.do?reference=E-2004-3589&amp;language=DE])

18-7-2005: MEP '''[[Tobias Pflüger]], question P-2769/05'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;[[File:Tzixcao2.JPG|thumb|right|click to enlarge]]
"According to press reports and my own local research, those belonging to the indigenous population and farmers living in the Lacandon Jungle region were not adequately informed beforehand about this project, or involved in the planning of the project. Under Article 7 of [[International Labour Organization#Indigenous peoples|ILO-convention 169]] [https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20111031202527/http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/cgi-lex/convde.pl?C169], indigenous population groups have to be consulted before projects may be carried out on their lands. According to human rights organisations in Europe and Mexico, the European Commission is running a risk, in financing this project, of lending support to the counter-insurgency action being waged in the context of low-intensity warfare and of exacerbating socio-economic tensions between communities, by virtue of the fact that only certain individual population groups are benefited by this project."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

16-2-2006: Commissioner '''[[Benita Ferrero-Waldner]], answer P-2769/05'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;
1) The current Chiapas State Government, elected in 2000, qualified as beneficiary institution in this EC project due to its reconciliatory position in the conflict between federal government and ELZN, that has been recognised by the latter on several occasions. [...] After its election, the Government of Chiapas also politically assumed the principles of the San Andrés Agreement between the federal Mexican government and the EZLN, as well as the 169 ILO Convention.&lt;br /&gt;
2) The State Government’s position is sustained by the fact that one of the most delicate subjects in the Lacandona region, the agrarian (land) reform and resulting conflicts over land and delocalisation of “informal settlements” (especially in the Montes Azules area – that is not part of Prodesis’ area of intervention), are falling under federal competence. The Chiapas Government hence is not participating in the very tense negotiations between local communities and federal institutions on that issue.&lt;br /&gt;
3) From an institutional point of view, major emphasis has been put on inclusive participation and control by civil society within PRODESIS’ Consultative Council, whose “civil society college” currently includes 30 members of regional and national civil society organisations. The renowned Chiapas expert and EZLN’s external consultant during the negotiation of the San Andres Agreement, Professor [[Jan de Vos (historian)|Jan de Vos]], is also a member of that Consultative Council.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Comments on answer P-2769/05''' by Commissioner [[Benita Ferrero-Waldner]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
1) Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner refers to the political situation in 2000: Newly elected president Fox had promised to revive the peace process and ratify the [[Cocopa legislative proposal]] which, taken to the constitutional level, would mean the fulfillment of the [[San Andrés Accords]]. However, in April 2001 Mexican Congress adopted a diluted version of the [[Cocopa law]], which was criticised by the [[International Labour Organization]] for violating [[International Labour Organization#Indigenous peoples|ILO-convention 169]] [https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20111031202527/http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/cgi-lex/convde.pl?C169]. The [[EZLN]] felt betrayed and broke off all dialogue with the federal and state government and installed ''juntas de buen gobierno'' (''communities of [[Good governance]]''). Furthermore, in 2004 Ruben Velazquez Lopez (secretary of government of Chiapas) said he would "not tolerate land-occupations anymore", threatening informal settlements with eviction. So the legitimation the Commissioner gives in her answer of February 16th 2006 conceils the changed political situation between 2000 and 2004, when Prodesis started.[[File:montes-Azules+marker.jpg|thumb|right|click to enlarge]]
2) The Commissioner suggests that conflicts over land and delocalisation of ''informal settlements'' happen only in the [[Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve]], which falls under federal competence. Prodesis’ area of intervention is the Lacandon region ''around'' [[Montes Azules]], which is Chiapas territory. The Chiapas Government (beneficiary of the €15.000.000 for Prodesis), hence would not be involved in these matters. This distinction however is purely theoretical: in reality conflicts over land, [[para-military]] attacks, [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] presence, and Prodesis' 16 micro-regions are all located in the [[Lacandon region]] ''around'' the [[Montes Azules]] Reserve. This is illustrated by this map (see on the right) of Chiapas' [[Lacandon region]], with [[Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve]] (green area) at the center. The green circles represent Prodesis projects, the blue circles represent areas with conflicts over land, and the red markings represent areas with para-military presence.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Although emphasis has been put on inclusive participation and control by civil society within Prodesis’ Consultative Council, several members of that council (among them [[Jan de Vos (historian)|Jan de Vos]] and [[Tim Trench (anthropologist)|Tim Trench]]) are critical of Prodesis' consultation process, and sceptical of its effectivity, stating that the project might indeed be worsening the situation in the region.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

15-7-2008: MEP '''[[Eva Lichtenberger]], question H-0628/08'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Why was an extremely strife-torn region chosen without consulting or securing the agreement of the local population? [...] What mechanisms does the EU intend to use in order to guarantee that its projects are carried out in accordance with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Indigenous Peoples concerning the need to secure free and informed consent for any project being carried out on land belonging to indigenous peoples?"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

25-9-2008: Commissioner '''[[Benita Ferrero-Waldner]], answer H-0628/08'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"At every step of the project cycle, and even now with PRODESIS in its closing stages, the Commission has been aware of the difficult political and social situation on the ground. This is reflected both by Prodesis' openness to local partner institutions, and its strong commitment to accountability to final beneficiaries and communities. During the feasibility study and formulation mission, there were multiple contacts and consultations with local beneficiaries and communities as well as national and regional civil society organisations. During the project launch and execution, each planning exercise and productive activity financed by the project necessarily depended on the prior agreement and free consent of local communities and grass-root organisations. From an institutional point of view, emphasis has been put on civil society participation and control within the project's Consultative Council, whose independent Civil Society College included approximately 30 members of regional and national Non State Actors (NSA)."

== Life and career ==

=== Early years ===

The oldest daughter in a large [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] pioneer farming family, Rebecca Keck ([[née]] Ilgenfritz, sometimes spelled Ilginfritz) was born in [[Wooster, Ohio|Wooster]], [[Wayne County, Ohio]] in 1838.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;''History of Scott Co., Iowa'' Chicago: Inter-State Pub. Co., 1882, pp. 858-861.&lt;/ref&gt;  She moved with her parents to [[Fairfield, Iowa]] at the age of thirteen, where she may have completed schooling as far as the eighth grade.&lt;ref name="State Census"&gt;''Iowa State Census'' July 3, 1854.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1857, she married John Conrad Keck, a merchant and mechanic newly arrived in Fairfield from Northampton County, Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="Jefferson County Marriages"&gt;''Jefferson County Iowa Marriages'' page 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three of Rebecca's brothers died of [[tuberculosis]] between 1857 and 1869; while she was nursing them through their illnesses, she also gave birth to six children (five girls and a boy)&lt;ref name="US Census"&gt;''United States Census'' records for 1860, 1870 and 1880.&lt;/ref&gt; and began to develop a reputation among her neighbors as an [[herbalist]].&lt;ref name="Clarke"&gt;James Frederic Clarke, M.D. "A History of Medicine in Jefferson County, Iowa" ''The Journal of the Iowa State Medical Society'' Dec. 1934 and December, 1935. pg. 13&lt;/ref&gt;  During this time, her husband built up a substantial farm equipment and foundry business.&lt;ref name="Report"&gt;''Report of the Iowa State Agricultural Society,'' John R. Shaffer, Secretary. 1866 through 1876.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medical career ===

Following the national banking [[Panic of 1873]], Mr. Keck's foundry business collapsed and the couple began to collect herbs and brew her remedies together, which Rebecca Keck started to sell door to door.&lt;ref name="Journal"&gt;Dr. James Frederic Clarke M.D. ''ibid'' page 29&lt;/ref&gt; Seeking a wider market, in November, 1873, she took out her first advertisement for "Keck's [[Catarrh]]ochesis"  in Dubuque.&lt;ref name="Dubuque"&gt;''[[Dubuque Herald]]'' November 23 to 29, 1873&lt;/ref&gt; Success came very quickly; within three years she was advertising her "Catarrh Cure" heavily in a number of newspapers including the ''[[Telegraph Herald|Dubuque Herald]]'', the ''Davenport Gazette'' and the ''[[Chicago Times]]'' and ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''.

Besides selling her remedies by mail order, she practiced as an "itinerant physician," a common business model for the frontier, because sick people were scattered across long distances and lacked regular access to medical care. She would rent rooms in a local hotel or storefront for visits of two days to two weeks, and take out large advertisements in advance to advise her customers of her upcoming personal consultations. She traveled her entire circuit every two months, so that patients could see her for follow-up treatment. At its height, her practice served between 12,000 and 15,000 patients, and she would typically see 350 patients per week.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;

[[File:Flyer1894.jpg|thumb|The first page of a 4-page booklet describing Mrs. Dr. Keck's medical services, published in 1894.]]

Mrs. Dr. Keck moved her family to [[Davenport, Iowa]], on the Mississippi River, in 1875 as her business expanded.&lt;ref name="Finger's"&gt;''Finger's Davenport Business Directory for 1876''&lt;/ref&gt; As was common for Midwestern women physicians in her day, she used both Dr &amp; Mrs so that her married and professional status could both be understood by the public. She only treated chronic conditions and according to the testimonial letters she published in her advertising, the majority of her customers were working people and farm families who could not afford the high cost of private doctors' fees and who received her medical remedies and treatment advice by mail order.

Rebecca Keck considered herself to be a fully qualified physician by virtue of her long years of experience treating her family, neighbors and public customers. She owned a large medical library&lt;ref name="will"&gt;Rebecca J. Keck's last will and testament p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; and advertised herself as an Eclectic practitioner. The [[Eclectic medicine|Eclectic School of medicine]], which grew out of the sectarian medical reform movements of the 1830s, was an active and publicly accepted school of medicine in the mid 19th century in the Midwest that competed with [[homeopathy]] and [[Allopathic medicine|allopathic]] (or regular, scientific) medical approaches. Eclectic treatments combined an emphasis on botanical remedies with a willingness to use regular medical techniques in certain cases.

There is no evidence that Rebecca Keck ever graduated from an Eclectic medical school although most of them were open to women by the 1870s. She did not enroll for regular medical training at the University of Iowa's new medical school which opened for men and women in 1871. Either she could not afford the time and money required (because of her six children and her family's bankruptcy in 1873) or she did not consider a professional degree to be necessary for her practice as a physician.

===Fame grows ===

With the exception of [[Lydia Pinkham]], Mrs. Dr. Keck appears to be the only woman to have earned substantial wealth on her own behalf in the lucrative but highly competitive and bruising profession of selling [[patent medicine]] in 19th century America.&lt;ref name="Stage"&gt;Sarah Stage, ''Female Complaints: Lydia Pinkham and the Business of Women's Medicine'' W.W. Norton &amp; Co. 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; Like Mrs. Pinkham, Mrs. Dr. Keck began her career because of family bankruptcy caused by the Panic of 1873. Unlike Mrs. Pinkham, Rebecca Keck not only believed herself to be a practicing physician, but became the top executive of the family's business and ran it herself, with the assistance of her two oldest daughters, Belle Alexander and Charlotte Dorn, while her husband played only a peripheral role and her only son contributed even less to the operations.

It is difficult to know Mrs. Dr. Keck's exact income, but she was able to purchase her infirmary in 1879 for $12,000 in cash,&lt;ref name="Gazette"&gt;''Davenport Gazette'' June 2, 1879, p.2&lt;/ref&gt; and at the time of her death, her life insurance payout of $15,520 was one of the largest made in the United States for the week of May 17, 1905.&lt;ref name="Insurance"&gt;''The Insurance Press'' May 17, 1905&lt;/ref&gt;

While extremely unpopular with members of the medical establishment in Iowa and Illinois, Rebecca Keck enjoyed glowing front page editorial endorsements from newspapers in the cities where she practiced. Some newspapers ran her illustrated, full-column ads on the front page under the heading, "Mrs. Dr. Keck's Column." The ''Decatur Review''&lt;ref name="DecaturReview"&gt;[http://search.ancestry.com/search/db.aspx?dbid=7104 About Decatur Review (Decatur, Illinois)]&lt;/ref&gt; declared on November 15, 1883, "We have a marked example among us of success in medicine, in the person of Mrs. Dr. Keck, well-known in the West," while the ''Bloomington Pantagraph'' declared on August 30, 1883 that Mrs. Dr. Keck "absorbs considerable public attention and is a subject for congratulation among the women of America…a forcible illustration of the ability of women to succeed" in "avenues of professional or public life." The ''Quincy Whig'' said she was "one of our longest established and best known physicians,"&lt;ref name="Whig"&gt;The ''Quincy Whig'' July 21, 1881 page 5&lt;/ref&gt; while the ''Evening Peorian'' referred to her "celebrity as a physician and good name as a citizen."&lt;ref&gt;''Bloomington Daily Leader'' September 24, 1881 page 2&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Peoria National Democrat'' declared, "her success is unprecedented…she is capable of doing the work of five ordinary women."

The regular medical establishment disagreed. The secretary of the Illinois State Board of Health, Dr. John Rauch was quoted in the ''Chicago Tribune'' as saying that Mrs. Dr. Keck was "foul and damnable in every way,"&lt;ref name="Tribune"&gt;''Chicago Daily Tribune'' February 7, 1880, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; and mostly male members of county medical associations were hardly less kind; Dr. James Clarke M.D. of Fairfield averred that the sale of her [[catarrh]] cures "made the doctor wealthy, even if it did not cure her patients."&lt;ref name="Clarke"/&gt; Regular doctors universally dismissed her as a quack, and her name was excluded from the physicians and surgeons listing in the Davenport business directories every year after 1878, although she continued to describe herself as a specialist and physician in the regular alphabetical listings and bought the entire back cover of the 1882 edition to advertise her infirmary.

=== Legal reform ===

The state of Illinois passed its [[Medical Practices Act]] in 1877 in an effort to exert some control of the wholly unregulated medical profession in the state.&lt;ref name="Sandvick"&gt;Clinton Sandvick, Enforcing Medical Licensing in Illinois: 1877-1890  ''Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine''  June 2009; 82(2): 67–74&lt;/ref&gt; This Illinois law was a landmark in [[health law]] in the United States, leading the way towards improved standards for the dismal state of medical licensing and medical education in the country at that time.&lt;ref name="NEJM"&gt;''The New England Journal of Medicine'', known in 1890 as ''The Boston Medical and Surgical Journal'' 122(11): page 257&lt;/ref&gt; The act defined requirements for a [[Medical license|physician's license]] that were extremely loose by modern standards, but which were sufficient to expel thousands of untrained and unqualified physicians and quacks from the state during the first year after it was passed.&lt;ref name="Board of Health 1878"&gt;Illinois State Board of Health, ''First Annual Report of the Illinois State Board of Health, 1878'' Springfield: Weber, Magie and Co. State Printer, 1879&lt;/ref&gt; Popular opposition to this measure was strong, and outraged citizens complained that a law requiring doctors to obtain a license to practice medicine was "an opening wedge for [[socialized medicine]]" in the state.&lt;ref name="Beatty"&gt;William K. Beatty, M.D. (1991) "John H. Rauch—Public Health, Parks and Politics" in ''The Proceedings of the Institute of Medicine of Chicago'' Volume 44 page 107&lt;/ref&gt;

Mrs. Dr. Keck refused to stop treating her patients in Illinois and quickly emerged as one of the most formidable opponents to the state's legal reform effort. As she pushed back against the new governmental regulations, Mrs. Dr. Keck became locked in a highly publicized, adversarial relationship with the secretary of the new Illinois State Board of Health, [[John Henry Rauch|Dr. John H. Rauch M.D.]], that lasted for at least a decade.&lt;ref name="Tribune"/&gt; When local doctors tried to block Mrs. Dr. Keck from practicing in McLean County, Illinois in early 1878, the ''Bloomington Daily Leader'' called hers the first test case of the new legislation, "the beginning of a long and tedious litigation" between the "regulars" and the "irregulars."&lt;ref&gt;''Bloomington Daily Leader'' February 12, 1878 page 4&lt;/ref&gt; The lasting stigma of these accusations was probably an important reason why her accomplishments faded quickly and completely from public view after her death, and her career remains little known today.

Criminal charges were brought against Mrs. Dr. Keck in at least five different counties in Illinois for [[practicing medicine without a license]] between 1878 and 1889, but she was ably defended by her lawyer W. S. McCoy&lt;ref name="champaign"&gt;''The People of Illinois vs. Rebecca Keck'' Case No. 1686, Circuit Court of Champaign County, Ill. March 1886 etc.&lt;/ref&gt; and persisted in business in McLean, Logan, Champaign, Peoria and Adams counties in Illinois for twenty years.&lt;ref name="Review"&gt;''Decatur Review'' February 6, 1884, and hundreds of advertisements in newspapers from those cities&lt;/ref&gt; Iowa's medical legislation had even less effect on her business, and she opened Mrs. Dr. Keck's Infirmary for All Chronic Diseases in Davenport in 1879,&lt;ref name="Gazette"/&gt; practicing with uninterrupted financial success there and in Cedar Rapids, Dubuque and rural communities in Iowa until she retired in 1900.&lt;ref name="Republican"&gt;''Davenport Daily Republican'' July 11, 1900, page 5&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accusations of quackery ===

Over the years, Mrs. Dr. Keck grew more and more boastful of her ability to cure many types of chronic diseases, including tuberculosis, an obviously impossible task in an era before the bacillus that caused the disease had even been identified.  Grateful patients wrote to her when they were cured of chronic lung infections, piles, eczema, general debility, deafness and a host of other issues, and she published their testimonial letters in her advertisements.,&lt;ref&gt;''Davenport Daily Gazette'' Nov. 10, 1881.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="flyer"&gt;''Dr. Mrs.Keck's Medical Infirmary'' a four-page advertising flyer published by Rebecca J. Keck circa 1894, and thousands of advertisements published in newspapers, business directories and gazettes across upper Illinois and eastern Iowa between 1873 and 1900--see Newspaperarchive.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Fraudulent testimonial letters were a common feature of 19th century patent medicine advertising.&lt;ref name="Young"&gt;James Harvey Young, ''The Toadstool Millionaires: A Social History of Patent Medicines in America before Federal Regulation,'' Princeton, NJ: The Princeton University Press, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, United States Census records from 1880 show that many of these people actually existed as presented in print by Mrs. Dr. Keck.&lt;ref name="US Census"/&gt; However, in over a thousand ads that survive to be studied today, less than a hundred different individuals are named, and there is no way to verify the facts presented about their illnesses, particularly the accuracy of the diagnoses, and there is no way to know for sure what percentage of her thousands of other patients did and did not get cured.

Regular allopathic medical practice during the 1870s and 1880s often involved "heroic" treatments with harsh, mineral medications containing lead, mercury (calomel) and arsenic, as well as toxic vegetable compounds containing strychnine, castor oil (derived from ricin), belladonna and other poisonous substances we would consider extremely dangerous today.&lt;ref name="Starr"&gt;Paul Starr, ''The Social Transformation of American Medicine'' Basic Books, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; Clumsy, unsanitary surgical procedures were also common, so it is not impossible that Mrs. Dr. Keck's herbal tonics and sensible nursing advice were actually better for her patients than the regular doctors' remedies in some cases.

It is unlikely that Mrs. Dr. Keck ever hurt anyone. Alert opponents in the medical profession would have been quick to pounce on any provable instance if she had ever actually harmed a patient with her treatments. While a number of outright quacks were taken to court by angry patients seeking reparations for botched treatments in Davenport during the years she practiced, no such accusation against Mrs. Dr. Keck shows up in the public record.&lt;ref name="Alexander"&gt;See for example: ''W.R.Alexander vs. Edward Emerson'' Case No. 1724, District Court of the State of Iowa for Scott County. November 6, 1890 etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

The only parties who sued her during her career were male doctors with M.D. credentials. In every instance, they were seeking to solidify institutional boundaries for their evolving practice of allopathic or scientific medicine by first preventing her from getting a license and second by preventing her from practicing medicine without one. No evidence that she harmed a patient was ever produced in any of these cases.

{{Wiktionary}}
[[File:Parallax scrolling example scene.gif|thumb|[[Parallax scrolling]]]]
In [[computer display]]s, [[filmmaking]], [[television production]], and other kinetic displays, '''scrolling''' is sliding text, images or video across a monitor or display, vertically or horizontally. "Scrolling", as such, does not change the layout of the text or pictures, but moves ([[panning (camera)|pans]] or [[Tilt (camera)|tilts]]) the user's view across what is apparently a larger image that is not wholly seen. A common television and movie special effect is to scroll credits, while leaving the background stationary. Scrolling may take place completely without user intervention (as in film credits) or, on an interactive device, be triggered by [[touchscreen]] or a keypress and continue without further intervention until a further user action, or be entirely controlled by [[input device]]s.

Scrolling may take place in discrete increments (perhaps one or a few lines of text at a time), or continuously ('''smooth scrolling'''). [[Frame rate]] is the speed at which an entire image is redisplayed. It is related to scrolling in that changes to text and image position can only happen as often as the image can be redisplayed. When frame rate is a limiting factor, one smooth scrolling technique is to blur images during movement that would otherwise appear to "jump".

==Computing==

=== Implementation ===
{{anchor|software scrolling|hardware scrolling}}
Scrolling is often carried out on a computer by the CPU (''software scrolling'') or by a [[graphics processor]]. Some systems feature ''hardware scrolling'', where an image may be offset as it is displayed, without any [[frame buffer]] manipulation (see also [[hardware windowing]]). This was especially common in 8 and 16bit video game consoles.

=== UI paradigms ===
In a [[WIMP (computing)|WIMP]]-style [[graphical user interface]] (GUI), user-controlled scrolling is carried out by manipulating a [[scrollbar]] with a mouse, or using [[keyboard shortcut]]s, often the [[arrow key]]s. Scrolling is often supported by [[text user interface]]s and [[command line interface]]s. Older [[computer terminal]]s changed the entire contents of the display one screenful ("page") at a time; this paging mode requires fewer resources than scrolling. Scrolling displays often also support page mode. Typically certain keys or [[key combination]]s page up or down; on [[PC-compatible]] keyboards the [[page up and page down keys]] or the [[space bar]] are used; earlier computers often used [[control key]] combinations.&lt;ref group="notes"&gt;The widely used [[Wordstar]] word processor used the "diamond" of Ctrl-S/E/D/X to move the cursor left, up, right, and down, and Ctrl-R and Ctrl-C to page up and down.&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Computer mouse|computer mice]] have a [[scroll wheel]], which scrolls the display, often vertically, when rolled; others have [[scroll ball]]s or [[tilt wheel]]s which allow both vertical and horizontal scrolling.

Some software supports other ways of scrolling. [[Adobe Reader]] has a mode identified by a small hand icon ("[[hand tool]]") on the document, which can then be dragged by clicking on it and moving the mouse as if sliding a large sheet of paper. When this feature is implemented on a [[touchscreen]] it is called ''kinetic scrolling''. [[Touchscreen|Touch-screens]] often use ''inertial scrolling'', in which the scrolling motion of an object continues in a decaying fashion after release of the touch, simulating the appearance of an object with [[inertia]]. An early implementation of such behavior was in the "Star7" [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]] of [[Sun Microsystems]] ca. 1991&amp;ndash;1992.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsTH9S79qI&amp;t=4m28s&lt;/ref&gt;

Scrolling can be controlled in other software-dependent ways by a PC mouse. Some scroll wheels can be pressed down, functioning like a button.  Depending on the software, this allows both horizontal and vertical scrolling by dragging in the direction desired; when the mouse is moved to the original position, scrolling stops.  A few scroll wheels can also be tilted, scrolling horizontally in one direction until released. On [[touchscreen]] devices, scrolling is a [[multi-touch]] gesture, done by swiping a finger on the screen vertically in the direction opposite to where the user wants to scroll to.

If any content is too wide to fit on a display, horizontal scrolling is required to view all of it. In applications such as [[graphics]] and [[spreadsheet]]s there is often more content than can fit either the width or the height of the screen at a comfortable scale, and scrolling in both directions is necessary.

===Text===
In [[Horizontal and vertical writing in East Asian scripts|languages written horizontally]], such as most Western languages, text documents longer than will fit on the screen are often displayed [[Word wrap|wrapped]] and sized to fit the screen width, and scrolled vertically to bring desired content into view. It is possible to display lines too long to fit the display without wrapping, scrolling horizontally to view each entire line. However, this requires inconvenient constant line-by-line scrolling, while vertical scrolling is only needed after reading a full screenful.

Software such as [[word processor]]s and [[web browser]]s normally uses word-wrapping to display as many words in a single line as will fit the width of the screen or window or, for text organised in columns, each column.

====Demos====
Scrolling texts, also referred to as ''scrolltexts'' or ''scrollers'', played an important part in the birth of the computer [[Demo (computer programming)|demo culture]]. The [[Software cracking|software cracker]]s often used their deep knowledge of [[computer platform]]s to transform the information that accompanied their releases into [[crack intro]]s. The sole role of these intros was to scroll the text on the screen in an impressive way.&lt;ref&gt;http://tomaes.32x.de/text/faq.php#2.3{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many scrollers were plain horizontal scrollers, but [[demoscene|demo coders]] also paid a lot of attention to creating new and different types of scrolling. The characters could, for example, continuously alter their shape, take unusual flying paths or incorporate color effects such as [[raster bar]]s. Sometimes it makes the text nearly unreadable.

==Film and television==
Scrolling is commonly used to display the credits at the end of [[film]]s and [[television program]]s.

Scrolling is often used in the form of a [[news ticker]] towards the bottom of the picture for content such as [[television news]], scrolling sideways across the screen, delivering short-form content.

== Video games ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Bubble Bobble]] --&gt;
{{see also|Side-scrolling video game|Parallax scrolling|2.5D}}

In [[Video game|computer and video games]], scrolling of a playing field allows the player to control an object in a large contiguous area. Early examples of this method include [[Taito]]'s 1974 vertical-scrolling [[racing video game]] ''[[Tomohiro Nishikado#Speed Race|Speed Race]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{KLOV game|id=9709|name=Speed Race}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sega]]'s 1976 [[2.5D|forward-scrolling]] [[racing game]]s ''[[Fonz (arcade)|Moto-Cross]]''&lt;ref name=Moto-Cross&gt;{{KLOV game|12812|Moto-Cross}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''Fonz'')&lt;ref name=Fonz&gt;{{KLOV game|id=12812|name=Fonz}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Road Race'',&lt;ref name=Road-Race&gt;{{KLOV game|12733|Road Race}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Super Bug''.

The [[Namco Galaxian]] [[arcade system board]] introduced with ''[[Galaxian]]'' in 1979 pioneered a [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] system that animated pre-loaded sprites over a scrolling background, which became the basis for [[Nintendo]]'s ''[[Radar Scope]]'' and ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'' arcade hardware and [[home console]]s such as the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120505103737/http://www.glitterberri.com/developer-interviews/how-the-famicom-was-born/making-the-famicom-a-reality/ Making the Famicom a Reality], ''Nikkei Electronics'' (September 12, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Parallax scroll]]ing, which was first featured in ''[[Moon Patrol]]'', involves several [[transparency (optics)|semi-transparent]] layers (called playfields), which scroll on top of each other at varying rates in order to give an early [[2.5D|pseudo-3D]] illusion of depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/f/gamings-most-important-evolutions/a-20101008102331322035/p-3|title=Gaming's Most Important Evolutions|page=3|publisher=[[GamesRadar]]|date=October 8, 2010|accessdate=2011-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''{{vanchor|Belt scrolling}}''' is a method used in side-scrolling [[beat 'em up]] games with a downward camera angle where players can move up and down in addition to left and right. A previously much used alternative to video game scrolling is the [[flip-screen]] method.

== Studies ==
A 1993 article by George Fitzmaurice studied spatially aware [[palmtop computer]]s. These devices had a 3D sensor, and moving the device caused the contents to move as if the contents were fixed in place. This interaction could be referred to as “moving to scroll.” Also, if the user moved the device away from their body, they would zoom in; conversely, the device would zoom out if the user pulled the device closer to them. [[Smartphone]] [[camera]]s and “[[optical flow]]” image analysis utilize this technique nowadays. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fitzmaurice|first=George W.|date=1993-07-01|title=Situated Information Spaces and Spatially Aware Palmtop Computers|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/159544.159566|journal=Commun. ACM|volume=36|issue=7|pages=39–49|doi=10.1145/159544.159566|issn=0001-0782}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1996 research paper by Jun Rekimoto analyzed tilting operations as scrolling techniques on small screen interfaces. Users could not only tilt to scroll, but also tilt to select menu items. These techniques proved especially useful for field workers, since they only needed to hold and control the device with one hand. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rekimoto|first=Jun|date=1996-01-01|title=Tilting Operations for Small Screen Interfaces|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/237091.237115|journal=Proceedings of the 9th Annual ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology|series=UIST '96|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=167–168|doi=10.1145/237091.237115|isbn=0897917987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent study from 2013 by Selina Sharmin, Oleg Špakov, and Kari-Jouko Räihä explored the action of reading text on a screen while the text auto-scrolls based on the user’s eye tracking patterns. The control group simply read text on a screen and manually scrolled. The study found that participants preferred to read primarily at the top of the screen, so the screen scrolled down whenever participants’ eyes began to look toward the bottom of the screen. This auto-scrolling caused no statistically significant difference in reading speed or performance. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sharmin|first=Selina|last2=Špakov|first2=Oleg|last3=Räihä|first3=Kari-Jouko|date=2013-01-01|title=Reading On-screen Text with Gaze-based Auto-scrolling|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2509315.2509319|journal=Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Eye Tracking South Africa|series=ETSA '13|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=24–31|doi=10.1145/2509315.2509319|isbn=9781450321105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''singing telegram''' is a message that is delivered by an [[artist]] in a musical form.  Singing telegrams are historically linked to normal [[telegram]]s, but tend to be humorous. Sometimes the artist is in costume or formal clothing.  Singing telegrams are often given as a gift.

[[Western Union]], the American [[telegraph]] company began offering singing telegram services in 1933. That July 28, a fan sent Hollywood singing star [[Rudy Vallee]] a birthday greeting by telegram. [[George P. Oslin]] (1899–1996), the Western Union public relations director, decided this would be a good opportunity to make telegrams, which had been associated with deaths and other tragic news, into something more popular.  He asked a Western Union operator, Lucille Lipps, to sing the message over the telephone, and this became the first singing telegram.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.jrn.columbia.edu/studentwork/cns/2002-07-07/168.asp | title = Special delivery: The singing telegram endures | newspaper = Columbia News Service | date = July 7, 2002 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061108220256/http://www.jrn.columbia.edu/studentwork/cns/2002-07-07/168.asp | archivedate = November 8, 2006 | df =  | author=Liz Sadler }}.&lt;/ref&gt; While Oslin created the singing telegram because he thought "that messages should be fun," he recalled that he "was angrily informed I was making a laughingstock of the company."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = George Oslin, 97, creator of the singing telegram | newspaper = [[Chicago Tribune]] | date = October 31, 1996 | page = 11}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As relatively few telegram recipients had telephones, most telegrams, including singing telegrams, were first delivered in person. The popularization of the telephone in the 1960s reduced telegrams in general. By 1972, Western Union was receiving a small number of requests for singing telegrams and was seeking regulatory approval on a state-by-state basis to eliminate the offering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Western Union Tuning Out Singing Telegram | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = July 29, 1972 | page = 27}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Western Union suspended its singing telegram service in 1974, but independent singing telegram companies, specializing in often costumed personal delivery of gift messages, have kept up the tradition.

==Variants==
A '''DIY singing telegram''' is a specially written song all about the person in karaoke DVD form, so that any singer anywhere in the world can deliver the fully personalised singing telegram.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===Kissogram===
A '''kissogram''', also called '''kissagram''' (short for kissing [[telegram]]), is a [[message]] delivered along with a [[kiss]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/american_english/kissogram |title=Definition of kissogram |publisher=[[OxfordDictionaries.com]] |accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually arranged as a fun surprise for a person for a special occasion. Message deliverers can be hired either by themselves, or as part of an [[Employment agency|agency]]. A kissogram is usually presented by a performer dressed in a costume or uniform such as a [[police officer]], [[nurse]], [[french maid]] or [[nun]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} This term was used in the TV program Doctor Who to describe the profession of Doctor Who's companion Amy Pond. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/doctor-who/news/a197176/new-who-companion-has-kissogram-job/|title=New 'Who' companion 'has kissogram job'|date=2010-01-18|work=Digital Spy|access-date=2018-03-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stripogram===
A '''stripogram''' or '''strippergram'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/strippergram|title=strippergram - Wiktionary|website=en.wiktionary.org|language=en|access-date=2017-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a form of message delivery in which a [[stripper]] will perform a [[striptease]] while singing or dancing.  The word is a combination of [[telegram]] and striptease.  This type of entertainment became popular in the 1970s in the US and spread to the UK and Europe during the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=thecelebratedmisterk|title=Newsroom Stripper|date=2012-03-11|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lusr48t3cBM|accessdate=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically a Strip-O-Gram is most often a form of gift given for a [[birthday]], [[anniversary]] or [[bachelor party]].  A common practice is for the stripper-gram to be dressed in an outfit of one kind or another and to act out some form of charade connected with this, before commencing their act - for example a police officer 'arresting' somebody, a lawyer pretending to serve papers, a jilted bride and so on (sometimes this charade will be relevant to something the intended 'victim' has experienced, such as a divorce, or brush with the law). Usually a Strip-o-gram entertainer is accompanied by a chaperone, who plays her music, holds on to the money, tips and secures her safety. Unlike an escort who comes alone and does more of a one on one with the celebrant and is not chaperoned. Now-a-days, some agencies or performers do both to secure a bigger pay out.

==Star System==
In the early 1980s, a collaboration of independent singing telegrams companies in the U.S. was formed by Larry Balsamo, Hey!Wires Sing Telegrams in Chicago. Similar to [[Florists' Transworld Delivery]], the Star System was a referral system for people to send a singing telegram to friends and family throughout the United States.

==In popular culture==
In the 1976 season 5, episode 1 of The Bob Newhart Show, Bob receives a singing telegram announcing a visit from his college roommate and his new wife.  

In the 1985 movie ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'', Sam Lowry ([[Jonathan Pryce]]) received an invitation to his mother's party via singing telegram. When told the message had been sent Reply Paid, he attempted to sing his reply.

In ''[[Clue (film)|Clue]]'', 1985, a singing telegram ([[Jane Wiedlin]]) arrives and is shot on the doorstep. She is later revealed to be a secret blackmail informant. 

In a classic episode of [[Sesame Street]], Grover poses as a singing telegram artist. He goes up to [[Mr. Johnson (Sesame Street)|Mr. Johnson]] singing a series of singing telegrams not directed for him until he eventually gives him the right telegram. The telegram is about Mr. Johnson's hat being found by someone in Buffalo, New York, but to Mr. Johnson's dismay, Grover forgets who sent the telegram.

In the 1987 [[MacGyver (1985 TV series)|MacGyver]] episode "Soft Touch", [[Penny Parker]] ([[Teri Hatcher]]) tries her hand at being a singing telegram deliveryperson. But due to her forgetfully visiting the wrong address, she happens to witness two thugs torturing a man.

In ''[[The Fisher King]]'', 1991, Parry ([[Robin Williams]]) sends a singing telegram ([[Michael Jeter]]) to Lydia, the love interest in her office.

In the 2010 ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode "[[The Eleventh Hour (Doctor Who)|The Eleventh Hour]]", the [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|Doctor's]] [[companion (Doctor Who)|companion]] [[Amy Pond]] worked delivering kissograms, prior to traveling with the Doctor.

Soil quality reflects how well a soil performs the functions of maintaining [[biodiversity]] and productivity, partitioning water and solute flow, filtering and buffering, [[nutrient cycle|nutrient cycling]], and providing support for plants and other structures. [[Soil management]] has a major impact on soil quality. 

Soil quality in agricultural terms is measured on a scale of [[soil value]] (''Bodenwertzahl'') in [[Germany]].

Soil quality is related to soil function. Unlike water or air, for which established standards have been set, soil quality is difficult to define or quantify.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6042">'''Sorin Alexandrescu''' (born 18 August 1937) is a Romanian-born academic, literary critic, [[semiotics|semiotician]], linguist, essayist, and translator.

Born in [[Bucharest]] as the son of Constantin, a magistrate, and Ileana, [[Mircea Eliade]]'s sister, he graduated from the "Mihai Viteazu" High School in his hometown (1955), and after that, from the Faculty of Letters, University of Bucharest (1959). After teaching [[comparative literature]] at the [[University of Bucharest]], where he was considered to be a [[structuralism|structuralist]], he was sent in 1969 by the Romanian authorities to teach Romanian language and literature at universities in Amsterdam and Groningen.&lt;ref name="UPM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upm.ro/cercetare/CentreCercetare/DictionarCritica/Alexandrescu.pdf|title=Alexandrescu, Sorin|language=Romanian|accessdate=November 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974 he decided to defect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.romlit.ro/cronologia_exilului_literar_postbelic_ii|title=Cronologia exilului literar postbelic (II)|last=Simut|first=Ion|language=Romanian|date=2008|number=24|publisher=[[Romania literara]]|accessdate=November 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, he founded the ''International Journal of Roumanian Studies''.&lt;ref name="UPM"/&gt;

During the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|1989 Romanian Revolution]], he returned to Romania as a correspondent for a Dutch newspaper.&lt;ref name=int&gt;{{Citation |author1=Laurențiu Ungureanu |author2=Anca Vancu |author3=Alina Boghiceanu | title=Adevărul Live.

In 1998, he was named presidential adviser for culture. In 2001, he settled permanently in Romania again.&lt;ref name=int /&gt; That same year, he was one of the founders of the so-called ''Centrul de Excelență în Studiul Imaginii'' at the [[University of Bucharest]], together with Dan Grigorescu, Mihai Zamfir, Laura Mesina, Vlad Alexandrescu, Vasile Morar and Zoe Petre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Sorin Alexandrescu| newspaper=Pagina oficială a Centrului de Excelență în Studiul Imaginii| url=http://www.cesi.ro/ro/info/cvs/s_alexandrescu.htm| accessdate=7 September 2014|language=Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17952">A '''subtropical climate vegetated roof''' ('''SCV roof''') is a type of [[green building]] practice that employs a planted soil media installed above a waterproof roof deck to obtain [[Environmental management|environmental]] benefits and address [[sustainability]] concerns, similar to traditional [[green roofs]] located in northern continental United States. Soil media, plant palettes, and green roof systems that can adapt to the adverse weather conditions and physical characteristics of the humid, subtropical regions of the United States are utilized in the construction and design of subtropical climate vegetated roofs.

Green roofs are used for various reasons including: [[urban oasis]], storm water mitigation, [[carbon reduction]], [[energy conservation]], aesthetics, and therapeutic values depending on the [[geographic location]] and the intended specific goals of the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.igra-world.com/benefits/public_benefits.php|title= Public Benefits}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Most of the current green roof research pertains to northern parts of the continental United States, whereas, very limited research has been conducted in humid, subtropical regions.&lt;ref name="ufl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.springerlink.com.lp.hscl.ufl.edu/content/1250j6n7008p73pu/fulltext.pdf|title=Connecting From Off-Campus|publisher=University of Florida Libraries|accessdate=2014-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although similar characteristics and principles exist, there are several differences between the two types of environmentally sound roofing systems. These differences are comparable to the differences found between regions of the United States in conventional [[landscaping]] and gardening or the variations found in forms of landscaping. Plant species and landscaping methods utilized in northern parts of the United States are not suitable for humid, subtropical regions of United States due to the extreme temperatures and rain events that occur. This accounts for the most significant difference between a green roof in northern United States and a subtropical climate vegetated roof (SCV roof).

A subtropical climate vegetated roof that is well designed according to the specific geographic locations climate can lower roof surface temperatures by as much 38° and depending on the amount of the event retain up to 88% of rainfall.&lt;ref name="ufl"/&gt; An improperly designed subtropical climate vegetated (SCV roof) using incorrect soil media and plant species can fail by not achieving the intended goals.&lt;ref name="ufl"/&gt; This roofing method also contributes towards growing the [[green economy]], [[clean energy]] technology policies, and qualifies for Federal and local tax incentives, set in place by the United States government.

==Technology and terminology==

Compared with other parts of the United States, the number of vegetated roofs currently in the Southeast is significantly less. Vegetated roofs in humid subtropical regions rely on the same core green roof terminologies that are used throughout the world and other parts of the United States. Extensive, intensive, soil media, ballast, filter fabric, drainage layer, waterproof membrane are some of the core green roof component terms associated with SCV roofs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.igra-world.com/engineering/vegetation_technology.php|title= Vegetation technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regional terms, plant palettes, and technologies are forming to adapt to recent innovations and increased popularity of green roofs in the humid, subtropical regions of the United States. All forms of green roofs have the potential to retain [[stormwater]] on the roof surface and lower the [[thermal loading]] on buildings. Due to high temperatures, prolonged heat, and excessive amounts of precipitation, humid subtropical regions of the United States receive the greatest environmental benefits provided by SCV roofs, which are: reduced rainwater input into storm water retention systems during rainfall and increased energy performance ratings in buildings.&lt;ref name="ufl"/&gt; SCV and green roofs increase energy efficiencies of buildings by stabilizing roof surface temperatures. In other regions of the United States, the greatest environmental benefits of green roof design may be different based upon the type of [[climate]] the area possesses.

Recent advancements in soil engineering and plastic technologies allow vegetated roofs the ability to adapt to different locations within the humid, subtropical region of the United States. Soil media [[moisture content]] and capacity levels can be regulated by using soil elements that adapt to the climate of each specific geographic location and client needs. The amount of moisture retained depends on the maximum moisture retention capacity, the permeability and the depth of the soil media.&lt;ref name="ufl2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com.lp.hscl.ufl.edu/journals.htm?issn=0956-6163&amp;volume=13&amp;issue=4&amp;articleid=871400&amp;show=html&amp;PHPSESSID=2dhaso94ddmb4b04rlsb3lbrj4|title=Connecting From Off Campus - UF Libraries|publisher=emeraldinsight.com.lp.hscl.ufl.edu|accessdate=2014-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; High density plastics permit SCV roof systems to withstand the weather elements and adjust to varying building types of the region.

As defined by green roof industry standards, extensive green roofs have a soil media of less than 6 inches in depth and intensive green roofs have a soil media of more than 6 inches in depth.&lt;ref name="ufl3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buildgreen.ufl.edu/Fact_sheet_Green_Roofs_Eco_roofs.pdf|date=22 December 2008|title=Green Roofs/Eco-roofs|publisher=University of Florida|accessdate=2014-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most SCV roofs that are greater than 6 inches in depth are expensive and found on residential high rise structures, often containing [[Swimming pool|pool]]s and other amenities.

An SCV roofs requires a unique soil media mixture to adapt to the harsh [[weather conditions]] and physical characteristics of the southern United States. Expanded shall and [[clay]] are typically used to form a base and comprise up to 90% of some soil media mixtures used throughout the United States. [[Perlite]], [[vermiculite]], ash, tire crumbs, sand, [[peat moss]], and recycled vegetation are some of the other elements utilized in soil media engineering. [[Albedo]] and heat transfer rates are key variables to consider when designing an SCV roof and do not have a significant effect on green roofs in the northern continental United States.

There are three basic SCV and green roof systems available in today’s market: built-up, modular, and mat. These systems vary from manufacture to manufacture and are composed of different materials such as: [[foam]], high density plastic, and fabrics. Many of the systems have geographic limitations and do not perform well in humid, subtropical regions based upon the intent of the system and the materials being used.

==Built-up==

Multi-layered systems containing the following functional layers: [[root barrier]], protection layer, drainage layer, filter layer, growing medium and plant level.&lt;ref name=" Vegetation technology "&gt;Vegetation technology&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modular systems==

Self-contained units, typically square in shape, that require only the soil medium and vegetative layer for a functioning green roof. These systems are easy to install and remove. Some modular systems are pre-grown at nurseries to client specifications, forming an instant vegetative layer.&lt;ref name=" Vegetation technology "&gt;Vegetation technology&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mat systems==

Singled-layered systems of this type are drained by a multi-layer fabric mat called a “drainage mat” that combines soil separation, drainage, and protection functions. Current research suggests that the depth of the soil media, material, and amount of layers affect the success rate of an individual green or SCV roof.&lt;ref name=" Vegetation technology "&gt;Vegetation technology&lt;/ref&gt;

==Suitable plant pallets==

A suitable plant species for SCV roofs consist of the following features: drought tolerant, minimal root structure, minimal height, ability to form a vegetative mat, non-rangy, heat tolerant, [[frost]] tolerant, and the ability to adapt to a non-traditional soil media. Plant species that have extensive root system and tend to be rangy can puncture waterproofing elements or grow into unwanted areas causing [[mold]] and [[mildew]]. Water, high [[nutrient]], and [[shade (shadow)|shade]]-dependent plants are not suitable for SCV roofs and should be avoided and can lead to expensive failures.

Some of the most successful SCV roof plant species are in the [[Crassulaceae]] and [[Aizoaceae]] family which are CAM plants. A plant that uses the [[crassulacean acid metabolism]] (CAM) as an adaptation for arid conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/CAM_plant|title= CAM plant}}&lt;/ref&gt; CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; entering the stomata during the night is converted into [[organic acids]], which release [[CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] for the [[Calvin Cycle]] during the day, when the stomata are closed.&lt;ref name=" CAM plant "&gt;CAM plant&lt;/ref&gt; CAM plants often show [[xerophytic]] features, such as thick, reduced leaves with a low surface-area-to-volume ratio, thick cuticle, and [[stomata]] sunken into pits.&lt;ref name=" CAM plant "&gt;CAM plant&lt;/ref&gt;

Green roofs in the northern continental United States rely on [[Sedums]] which are in the Crassulaceae family. Most varieties of Sedums are not appropriate for humid, subtropical climates and experience root rot and disease problems due to high temperatures and humidity levels. However, two Sedum cultivars, ‘Lemon Coral’ and’ Florida Friendly Gold’ are currently{{When|date=March 2011}} being researched at the [[University of Florida]] and appear to be adapting to the humid, subtropical climate of [[Gainesville, Florida]].

==Challenges==

SCV roofs confront a magnitude of challenges due the adverse weather conditions of the Southeastern United States. High [[humidity]] levels, excessive rain amounts, prolonged heat, mold, mildew, insects, disease, weeds, soil borne disease, maintenance concerns, and sloped roofs are the major challenges faced in designing a SCV roof. High humidity levels, excessive rain amounts, prolonged heat lead to decreased plant health on CAM plants that are standard in green roof design. The decreased plant health causes diseases, insects, root rot, and plant fatality.

Soil-borne diseases occur more frequently due to warm, rainy, humid environment rhythm of the humid, subtropical region.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com.lp.hscl.ufl.edu/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=KNktsuZMtboC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA125&amp;dq=soil+diseases+humid+subtropical+regions&amp;ots=RVN_l-UXUA&amp;sig=MUA4wZo4IVPddW6FS8KcNbyqwUA#v=onepage&amp;q=warm%2C%20rainy&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; SCV roof plants are researched and tested at several different universities throughout the southeast to avoid system failure and economic loses. Mold and mildew can form on areas of the roof and building when proper ventilation is not taken into consideration and are also repercussions of high humidity levels and prolonged heat.

One of the greatest challenges to SCV roofs can be [[hurricanes]]. The strong hurricane winds can cause uplifting of the roofs. High winds can scour the growth media where the plants are established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.greenroofs.com/content/greenroofguy003.htm|title= Green Roof Wind Uplift Challenges}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scouring is the blowing of the particles in the growth media from the surface of the vegetated roof, thereby reducing the volume and weight of growth media and its ability to [[ballast]] the green roof.&lt;ref name=" Green Roof Wind Uplift Challenges "&gt;Green Roof Wind Uplift Challenges&lt;/ref&gt;

Sloped roofs that are prevalent in the southeastern United States also pose a significant challenge for SCV roofs. Soil media [[erosion]] and poor plant establishment are the most common problems and can occur on any angle of sloped roof if not designed properly. Erosion blankets and green roof soil media stabilization products are used to mitigate the effects of sloped roofs. Flat roofs and low sloped roofs are conventional roof slopes by the building industry in the southeastern United States and allow for successful implementation of SCV roofs.

===Standard roof slopes===

Flat roofs – 1% to 2% slope

Low slope-3:12 to 5:12

Medium Slope-6:12 to 9:12

High Slope-10:12 to 12:12

;Subtropical regions in the US where SCV roofs could apply

Here are some of the states where humid subtropical climates can be found:
* Eastern half of Texas
* [[Louisiana]]
* [[Arkansas]]
* [[Alabama]]
* [[Mississippi]]
* [[North Carolina]]
* [[South Carolina]]
* [[Tennessee]]
* [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]
* [[Kentucky]]
* most of Florida
* [[Virginia]]
* southern [[West Virginia]]

The climate in many of these states can vary and be extreme.

'''Benefits (Performance ratings)'''
* Reduces stormwater volume (50%–85%)&lt;ref name="ufl3"/&gt;
* Improves stormwater quality through load reduction&lt;ref name="ufl3"/&gt;
* Saves water by [[rainwater harvesting]]&lt;ref name="ufl3"/&gt;
* Reduces [[heat island effect]]&lt;ref name="ufl3"/&gt;
* Lowers surface temperatures by 40–50 degrees [[Fahrenheit]]&lt;ref name="ufl3"/&gt;
* Energy savings can reach 15%–30%&lt;ref name="ufl3"/&gt;
* Reduces noise for building occupants&lt;ref name=" Public Benefits "&gt;Public Benefits&lt;/ref&gt;
* Increases the life of the roof and reduces roof maintenance&lt;ref name="ufl3"/&gt;
* Contributes to [[biodiversity]] and creates [[habitats]] for birds and [[invertebrates]]&lt;ref name=" Public Benefits "&gt;Public Benefits&lt;/ref&gt;
* Filters air pollutant particles&lt;ref name=" Public Benefits "&gt;Public Benefits&lt;/ref&gt;
* Increased storm event safety
* Neighborhood diversity
* Aesthetic value
* Reduces need for [[Retention basin|retention ponds]] and [[ditches]]

===Costs===

Initially, vegetated roofs can have a high short-term capital but the long-term energy and maintenance savings outweigh them. Even the [[U.S. Green Building Council]] and some new advances in green roofs suggest that green buildings don't necessarily have to cost more than a conventional one.

== Background ==
A sustainable landscape is designed to be both attractive and in balance with the local climate and environment and it should require minimal resource inputs. Thus, the design must be “functional, cost-efficient, visually pleasing, environmentally friendly and maintainable" &lt;ref name="ext.colostate.edu"&gt;Colorado State University Extension. http://www.ext.colostate.edu/Pubs/Garden/07243.html. Viewed 11-15-09.&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the concept called [[sustainable development]] it pays close attention to the preservation of limited and costly resources, reducing waste and preventing air, water and soil pollution. Landscape Maintenance practices greatly influence the waste produced and the cost of the maintenance itself; such as using electric or gas [[hedge trimmer]]s which degrade plant material rather than using hand shears which create plant longevity, reduce the amount of waste over time, and prevent the misshaping of plant material and eliminates the "Balls and Boxes that unskilled gardeners create.(James Deagan, Prof Cal Poly Pomona Lecture 1980),  In addition, compost, fertilization, grass cycling, pest control measures that avoid or minimize the use of chemicals, [[integrated pest management]], using the right plant in the right place, appropriate use of turf, irrigation efficiency and [[xeriscaping]] or water-wise gardening are all components of sustainable landscaping.&lt;ref name="ciwmb.ca.gov"/&gt;

== Benefits ==
The geographic location can determine what is sustainable due to differences in precipitation and temperature. For example, the [[California Waste Management]] Board emphasizes the link between minimizing environmental damage and maximizing one’s bottom line of urban commercial landscaping companies. In California, the benefits of landscapes often do not outweigh the cost of inputs like water and labor. However, using appropriately selected and properly sited plants may help to ensure that maintenance costs are lower than they otherwise would be due to reduced chemical and water inputs.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;California Integrated Waste Management Board. http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/Organics/landscaping/ Viewed 11-15-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programs ==
There are several programs in place that are open to participation by various groups. For example, the [[Audubon International#Programs|Audubon Cooperative Sanctuary Program]] for [[Golf|Golf Courses]],&lt;ref&gt;http://Audubon International. acspgolf.auduboninternational.org/. Viewed 9/23/09.&lt;/ref&gt; the Audubon Green Neighborhoods Program,&lt;ref&gt;Green Neighborhoods http://gn.auduboninternational.org/.

The Sustainable Sites Initiative, the cooperative effort between the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]], the [[Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center]] and the [[United States Botanic Garden]], began in 2005 and will provide a points-based certification for landscapes, similar to the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] program for buildings operated by the [[Green Building Council]]. The Sustainable Sites Initiative now has a document titled Guidelines and Performance Benchmarks.&lt;ref&gt;The Sustainable Sites Initiative. http://www.sustainablesites.org/report/SSI_Guidelines_Draft_2008.pdf. Viewed 9/23/09.&lt;/ref&gt; The credit system is expected to be completed in 2011.

== Proper design ==
The primary step to landscape design is to do a "sustainability audit". This is similar to a landscape site analysis that is typically performed by landscape designers at the beginning of the design process. Factors such as lot size, house size, local covenants and budgets should be considered. The steps to design include a base plan, site inventory and analysis, construction documents, implementation and maintenance.&lt;ref name="ext.colostate.edu"/&gt; Of great importance is considerations related to the growing conditions of the site.  These include orientation to the sun, [[soil type]], wind flow, slopes, shade and climate.  The goal of reducing artificial [[irrigation]] (such as preventing irrigation of landscapes leaving the Los Angeles Basin a Desert again), and reducing use of toxic substances and requires proper plant selection for the specific site.

== Composting ==
{{Main|Composting}}
Composting is a way to recycle kitchen and garden waste while creating inexpensive organic fertilizer for the garden and landscape. Earthworms, microbes and other soil microorganisms feast on such organic matter when provided adequate nitrogen and proper temperatures and moisture. The ideal size for a compost pile or bin is one cubic yard (3' x 3' x 3'). It should be placed in a partly shady location to avoid intense sun and drying out, as this will delay the decomposition process. The pile heats up during the decomposition process, then cools as material is transformed; this is a good time to turn the pile, so that uncomposed materials on the periphery of the pile can be moved to the center to complete the process. With adequate moisture, nitrogen, proper temperature and correct timing of turning the pile, compost can be made in about a 30-day period. Left alone this process will still occur, but may take three to four months under less-than-ideal conditions.

Compost can be added as an amendment to poorly draining soil, as a fertilizer on flower and vegetable beds, to fruit trees or used as a potting soil for potted plants. Trimmings from lawns, trees and shrubs from a large landscape site can be used as feedstock for on-site composting. Reusing on-site organic materials will decrease the need for purchasing other soil additives.

== Irrigation ==
[[Mulch]] may be used to reduce water loss due to [[evaporation]], reduce weeds, minimize [[erosion]], dust and mud problems. Mulch can also add nutrients to the soil when it decomposes. However, mulch is most often used for weed suppression.  Over use of mulch can result in harm to the selected plantings. Care must be taken in the source of the mulch, for instance, black walnut trees result in a toxic mulch product. Grass cycling turf areas (using mulching mowers that leave grass clippings on the lawn) will also decrease the amount of fertilizer needed, reduce landfill waste and reduce costs of disposal.&lt;ref name="ciwmb.ca.gov"/&gt;

A common recommendation is to adding 2-4&amp;nbsp;inches of mulch in flower beds and under trees away from the trunk. Mulch should be applied under trees to the dripline (extension of the branches) in lieu of flowers, [[hosta]]s, [[turf]] or other plants that are often planted there. This practice of planting under trees is detrimental to tree roots, especially when such plants are irrigated to an excessive level that harms the tree. One must be careful not to apply mulch to the bark of the tree.  It can result in smothering, mold and to insect depredation.

The practice of [[xeriscaping]] or water-wise gardening suggests that placing plants with similar water demands together will save time and low-water or drought tolerant plants would be a smart initial consideration.

A homeowner may consider consulting an accredited irrigation technician/auditor and obtain a water audit of current systems. In the event that the situation is difficult to manage, drip or sub-surface irrigation may be most effective. If the system has been in use for over five years, upgrading to [[evapotranspiration]] (ET) controllers, soil sensors and refined control panels will improve the system. Often irrigation heads are in need of readjustment to avoid sprinkling on sidewalks or streets. Business owners may consider developing watering schedules based on historical or actual weather data and soil probes to monitor soil moisture prior to watering.&lt;ref name="ext.colostate.edu"/&gt;

== Building materials ==
{{see also|Sustainable architecture}}
When deciding what kind of building materials to put on a site it is important to recycle as often as possible. Reusing old bricks from sidewalks as patio pavers is one way to provide an aesthetic appeal to an area while reducing what goes to the landfill.

But it is also important to be careful about what materials you use, especially if you plan to grow food crops of any kind. Old telephone poles and railroad ties have usually been treated with a substance called [[creosote]] that can leach into the soils and make any food grown there toxic enough to cause harm to anyone that eats it. In general, you should avoid any kind of treated material, especially wood, that could leach into the soil with rain.&lt;ref name="sustainable-landscape.com"&gt;Sustainable Landscape Design's Custom Design Philosophy. http://www.sustainable-landscape.com/about.html.

The [[Forest Stewardship Council]] (http://www.fscus.org/) was formed in 1993 "to change the dialogue about and the practice of sustainable forestry worldwide." Sustainably harvested lumber - also called [[certified wood]] is now available, in which ecological, economic and social factors are integrated into the management of trees used for lumber.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bearcreeklumber.com/products/intextboth/sustainable.html. Viewed 12-07-09.&lt;/ref&gt; A chain of custody document is used in the certification process.

== Planting selection ==
{{see also|Xeriscaping|Native plant}}
One important part of sustainable landscaping is plant selection. Most of what makes a landscape unsustainable is the amount of inputs required to grow a non-native plant on it. What this means is that a local plant, which has adapted to local climate conditions will require less work on the part of some other agent to flourish. For example, it does not make sense to grow tomatoes in Arizona because there is not enough natural rainfall for them to survive without constant watering. Instead, [[drought-tolerant]] plants like [[succulents]] and [[cacti]] are better suited to survive. Also, by choosing native plants, one can avoid certain problems with insects and pests because these plants will also be adapted to deal with any local invader. The bottom line is that by choosing the right kind of local plants, a great deal of money can be saved on amendment costs, pest control and watering.&lt;ref name="sustainable-landscape.com"/&gt;

Plants used as [[windbreak]]s can save up to 30% on [[heating costs]] in winter. They also help with shading a residence or commercial building in summer, create cool air through evapo-transpiration and can cool hardscaped areas such as driveways and sidewalks.&lt;ref&gt;Farmstead Windbreaks: Planning. http://www.extension.iastate.edu/Publications/PM1716.pdf. Retrieved 12-12-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

A house surrounded by local trees or bushes enjoys multiple benefits. Plants release [[water vapor]] in the air through [[transpiration]] and water has the ability to reduce temperature extremes in the areas near it (as it boasts very high [[heat capacity]]). The larger and more leafy the plant, the most water vapor it produces. Additionally, the presence of trees is crucial in the creation of stable, healthy and productive ecosystems (such as forests). In fact this is an important principle of [[permaculture]].

If the surrounding trees are chosen to produce edible fruit they can provide a sustainable food source for the occupants of the house. Even if some are fairly demanding (especially in the summer), irrigation is an excellent end-use option in [[greywater]] recycling and [[rainwater harvesting]] systems, and a [[composting toilet]] can cover (at least) some of the [[nutrient]] requirements. Research suggests that diluted human urine might be as effective as chemical fertilizers.{{fact|date=January 2016}} Not all fruit trees are suitable for greywater irrigation, as reclaimed greywater is typically of high pH and [[acidophile]] plants don't do well in alkaline environments.

An intelligent choice for direct energy conservation would be the placement of broadleaf [[deciduous]] trees near the east, west and optionally north-facing walls of the house. Such selection provides shading in the summer while permitting large amounts of heat-carrying solar radiation to strike the house in the winter. The trees are to be placed as closely as possible to the house walls but no closer than 1 meter - otherwise the roots can cause substantial foundation damage. A sustainable house will most likely be equipped with south-facing (north-facing in the S. hemisphere) [[photovoltaic panel]]s and a large, south-facing [[glazing (window)|glazing]] as a result of [[passive solar]] heating design. As the efficiency of both systems is very sensitive to shading, experts suggest the complete absence of trees near the south side.

Another intelligent choice would be that of a dense vegetative fence composed of evergreens (e.g. [[conifer]]s) near that side from which cold continental winds blow (usually north in the N. hemisphere) and also that side from which the [[prevailing winds]] blow (west in temperate regions of both hemispheres). Since north winds are most cold and westerlies blow most often, such choice creates an effective winter windbarrier that prevents very low temperatures outside the house and reduces air infiltration towards the inside. Calculations show that placing the windbrake at a distance twice the height of the trees can reduce the wind velocity by 75%. It then follows that, with some planning, both arrangements (deciduous and evergreen) can be applied simultaneously.&lt;ref name="GF"&gt;"Green from the ground up" by D. Johnston and S. Gibson&lt;/ref&gt;

The above vegetative arrangements come with two disadvantages. Firstly, they minimize air circulation in summer (although in many climates heating is more important and costly than cooling) and, secondly, they may affect the efficiency of photovoltaic panels, thus prompting the need for a shading analysis. However, it has been estimated that if both arrangements are applied properly, they can reduce the overall house energy usage by up to 22%.&lt;ref name="GF" /&gt;

== Maintenance ==
{{see also|Organic gardening}}
'''''Pest Problems'''''

Maintaining plant health will eliminate most pest problems. It is best to start with pest-free plant materials and supplies and close inspection of the plant upon purchase is also recommended. Establishing diversity within the area of plant species will encourage beneficial organism populations (e.g. birds, insects), which feed on potential plant pests. Attracting a wide variety of organisms with a variety of host plants has shown to be effective in increasing pollinator presence in agrarian settings &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cole|first=Lorna J.|last2=Brocklehurst|first2=Sarah|last3=Robertson|first3=Duncan|last4=Harrison|first4=William|last5=McCracken|first5=David I.|date=2015-12|title=Riparian buffer strips: Their role in the conservation of insect pollinators in intensive grassland systems|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167880915002327|journal=Agriculture, Ecosystems &amp; Environment|volume=211|pages=207–220|doi=10.1016/j.agee.2015.06.012|issn=0167-8809}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Because plant pests vary from plant to plant, assessing the problem correctly is half the battle. The owner must consider whether the plant can tolerate the damage caused by the pest. If not, then does the plant value justify some sort of treatment? While pesticide is often chosen to solve the problem, physical barriers and repellents may help. If pesticides are the chosen method, selective organic or natural pesticide is often better because it has less impact on non-target species.&lt;ref name="ext.colostate.edu" /&gt; 

'''''Pruning'''''

Proper pruning will increase air circulation and decrease the likelihood of plant diseases. However, improper pruning is detrimental to shrubs and trees.&lt;ref name="ext.colostate.edu" /&gt; Hedging, topping and shearing of landscape plants causes excessive plant growth. In addition, topping is a hazardous practice which creates a hazardous tree which is highly susceptible to wind damage. Natural pruning techniques during the proper season, on the other hand, promotes healthier, more stable plants.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; In temperate areas, deciduous plants should be pruned during dormancy. Plants should never be pruned at the end of a growing season because growth is stimulated and such new growth will be too tender to survive winter freezing temperatures.

'''''Pollution Prevention'''''

Landscape managers should make use of the Integrated Pest Management (IPM) to reduce use of pesticides and herbicides and reduce non-point source solution. As there is considerable debate on the safety levels of nitrates and the impact of fertilizer run-off, more studies are needed in order to determine if the risks justify the outcomes of applying nitrate-ladden fertilizers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Powlson|first=David S.|last2=Addiscott|first2=Tom M.|last3=Benjamin|first3=Nigel|last4=Cassman|first4=Ken G.|last5=Kok|first5=De|last6=M|first6=Theo|last7=van Grinsven|first7=Hans|last8=L'hirondel|first8=Jean-Louis|last9=Avery|first9=Alex A.|date=2008-03-01|title=When Does Nitrate Become a Risk for Humans?|url=https://www.agronomy.org/publications/jeq/abstracts/37/2/291|journal=Journal of Environmental Quality|language=en|volume=37|issue=2|pages=291–295|doi=10.2134/jeq2007.0177|pmid=18268290|issn=1537-2537}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:Syntagma01.png|right|thumb|300px]]
'''''Syntagma Musicum''''' is a book by the German musicologist [[Michael Praetorius]], published in [[Wittenberg]] and [[Wolfenbüttel]] in three parts between 1614 and 1620. It is one of the most commonly used research sources for the music theory of the seventeenth century.&lt;ref name="Herbert2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Herbert|first=Trevor|title=The Trombone|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wy8bhvi2-j8C&amp;pg=PA87|accessdate=27 February 2013|date=28 March 2006|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-10095-2|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second work ''De Organographia'' illustrates and describes musical instruments and their use; becoming a valuable resource for the research and reconstruction of early instruments.

The three volumes (a fourth was in progress but never published) were:

==Overview==
Fulbeck began the project in 2001, traveling the country photographing over 1200 volunteer subjects who self-identified as [[Hapa]] (defined for the project as mixed ethnic heritage with partial roots in Asian and/or Pacific Islander ancestry)&lt;ref&gt;[http://seaweedproductions.com/the-hapa-project/hapa-about/].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discovernikkei.org/en/people/clip.php?id=495&amp;nf=1] {{dead link|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each individual was photographed in a similar minimalist style (directly head-on, unclothed from the shoulders up, and without jewelry, glasses, excess make-up, or purposeful expression).  After being photographed, participants chose their own racial/ethnic terms to describe themselves, then responded to the question "What are you?" in their own handwriting.  The photographs, self-descriptions, and handwritten responses were then combined and displayed as a collection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20070518155355/http://www.discovernikkei.org/en/people/clip.php?id=480&amp;nf=1] &lt;/ref&gt;

Over 1200 volunteer participants were photographed at dozens of shoots throughout California and Hawaii, as well as Illinois, New York, and Wisconsin.&lt;ref name="discovernikkei1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Fulbeck |first=Kip |url=http://www.discovernikkei.org/forum/en/node/2297 |title=kip fulbeck: part asian, 100% hapa – an artist’s thoughts |publisher=Discover Nikkei |date=2008-03-18 |accessdate=2015-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objective==
The Hapa Project was created to promote awareness and recognition of the millions of multiracial/multiethnic individuals of Asian/Pacific Islander descent in the U.S; to give voice to multiracial people and previously ignored ethnic groups; to dispel myths of exoticism, hybrid vigor and racial homogeneity; to foster positive identity formation and self-image in multiracial children; and to encourage solidarity and empowerment within the multiracial/Hapa community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdiversity.com/Villages/Asian/arts_culture_media/archives/fulbeck_hapa_project.asp |accessdate=September 5, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704071724/http://www.imdiversity.com/Villages/Asian/arts_culture_media/archives/fulbeck_hapa_project.asp |archivedate=July 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fulbeck also notes that a main objective "... was to make the book I wish I owned when I was a kid. I never knew anyone else like me, going through things I went through, not fitting in, always having to choose sides ... Identity is a personal process and I’m adamant that it should be a personal decision, not one made by a community, a government or others." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyotojournal.org/10,000things/184.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513031725/http://www.kyotojournal.org/10,000things/184.html |date=May 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of race as identifier==
Fulbeck states that despite its utilization of common racial classifications, The Hapa Project is fundamentally a project about identity rather than a project about race: "It's about identity using race as a starting point." &lt;ref name="fulbeck1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Fulbeck |first=Kip |url=http://www.discovernikkei.org/forum/en/node/2298 |title=kip fulbeck: part asian, 100% hapa – an artist’s thoughts - part 2 |publisher=Discover Nikkei |date=2008-03-19 |accessdate=2015-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that race in itself is not biologically determined, but socially created: "For the record, race is not a scientifically sound assumption. For example, there is no DNA difference between human beings. We are all African. Biologically, race does not exist. It is a social and [[cultural construct]] ... The U.S. is a country with a long history of social genocide (Native Americans, African slavery, etc.) and this was all due to the seeming differences we attributed to race. Yes, it is very convenient to categorize people according to race. It is also extremely inaccurate, however." &lt;ref name="fulbeck1"/&gt;

==Conceptual strategies==
[[Image:janm2.jpg|thumb|400px|The Hapa Project at the Japanese American National Museum]]
[[Image:janm1.jpg|thumb|400px|The Hapa Project at the Japanese American National Museum]]
The use of a clinical photographic style combined with the listing of the subject's ethnic heritage alongside their image visually quotes from various pseudo-scientific 18th and 19th century racial studies of [[Carl Linnaeus]], [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]], and [[Arthur de Gobineau]] [See: Spickard, Paul, ''Almost All Aliens'', Routledge, New York, NY 2007]  However, Fulbeck's decision to have the subjects self-designate their ethnicity and to include their individual handwritten statements counters this methodology, giving ownership and responsibility to the subjects themselves. As historian Paul Spickard writes, "Kip Fulbeck is using the pictures to provoke and encourage his readers.  He is using the old form, but with exactly opposite content." [See: Fulbeck, Kip, Part Asian, 100% Hapa, Chronicle Books, San Francisco 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;261]

The project also plays upon and critiques the official photographs each person has taken for their driver's licenses, passports and other forms of identification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.janm.org/press/release/92/ |title=Photographic Exhibition Kip Fulbeck: Part Asian, 100% Hapa Explores Perceptions of Identity, Questions Notions of Race, Ethnicity &amp;#124; Press Releases &amp;#124; Japanese American National Museum |publisher=Janm.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A further strategy aimed at diminishing the power dynamic between photographer/subject was to have each participant choose their own image, with the option of re-photographing them if they desired.  Fulbeck states, "... every participant not only got to write their statement the way they wanted to, they also got to pick their own image. A camera is a tremendously powerful tool and the power dynamic between photographer and subject is palpable. For this reason, I wanted to give some of the power back to the subjects. It was never going to be completely democratic – it is, after all, my concept, my project, and my design – but there are some strategies you can employ to make it less unilateral. Everyone got to see their image and choose to keep it or erase it and shoot again."  One participant was re-photographed 27 times.&lt;ref name="imdiversity1"/&gt;

==Offshoot projects==
Numerous schools and community organizations have created similar projects inspired by Fulbeck's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/emory_omps/sets/72157602156257949/set=72157602156257949&amp;nsid=43037005@N00&amp;lang=en-us |accessdate=September 5, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.brown.edu/Student_Services/TWC/2006_2007/aahm.html |title=ANNOUNCEMENTS &amp;#124; Brown Center for Students of Color |publisher=Brown.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dbq.edu/news/news1.cfm?ID=375 |accessdate=September 5, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080731214017/http://www.dbq.edu/news/news1.cfm?ID=375 |archivedate=July 31, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discovernikkei.org/nikkeialbum/en/collection/6926/item/7435 |title=The Hapa Collection |publisher=Discover Nikkei |date= |accessdate=2015-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibition history==
[[Image:hapaproject1.jpg|thumb|400px|Participatory component of The Hapa Project]]
The Hapa Project publicly premiered in 2006 at the [[Japanese American National Museum]] with a 5-month solo exhibition entitled "kip fulbeck: part asian, 100% hapa."  The work has also exhibited at Space180 Gallery (San Francisco), Mandeville Gallery (New York), [[The Field Museum]], [[University of North Carolina]], [[Oakland University]], [[Northern Arizona University]], [[Santa Clara University]], and [[Woodward Academy]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seaweedproductions.com/bio/curriculum-vitae/ |title=Curriculum Vitae - Kip Fulbeck |publisher=Seaweedproductions.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sixteen images from the series are included in the [[Science Museum of Minnesota]]'s exhibition ''Race: Are We So Different?'' currently touring nationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smm.org/travelingexhibits/race/gallery/11/ |title=Science Museum of Minnesota - The Hapa Project |publisher=Smm.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the exhibitions include a participatory component where visitors can take part in the project by having their picture taken and writing an individual statement.

==Public attention==
The project has received both national and international news coverage, being featured on [[CNN]], [[MTV]], [[PBS]], [[NPR]], and [[Voice of America]].  Major newspapers covering the project include [[The Los Angeles Times]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/jun/11/local/me-hapas11 |title=Mixed-Race Asians Find Pride as Hapas - Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=2006-06-11 |accessdate=2015-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Orange County Register]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ocregister.com/ocregister/life/homepage/article_1158297.php |title=Hapa nation |publisher=Ocregister.com |accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Kyoto Journal.  It has also been featured on dozens of websites exploring race and identity in the U.S.

==Book==
[[Image:Part Asian 100% Hapa Cover.jpg|thumb|''Part Asian, 100% Hapa'' (Chronicle Books)]]
A book based on the project entitled ''Part Asian, 100% Hapa'' was published by [[Chronicle Books]] in 2006.  It features a foreword by musician [[Sean Lennon]] and an afterword by historian Paul Spickard.

The book includes portraits and statements from approximately 10% of the overall project participants.  Fulbeck has discussed the difficulties in selecting these images from the overall pool, as well the problematic of selecting a single image for the book cover.  He also has written about the conscious decision to dispel stereotypes of Hapa people all being conventionally attractive.&lt;ref name="discovernikkei1"/&gt;

==Influences==
Fulbeck cites photographer [[Jim Goldberg]] and comic artist [[Lynda Barry]] as specifically influential to the creation of the project.  Lynda Barry also participated in the project and is included in ''Part Asian, 100% Hapa.''  Fulbeck also credits historian Paul Spickard as a major influence, particularly his book ''Mixed Blood: Intermarriage &amp; Ethnic: Intermarriage And Ethnic Identity In Twentieth Century America'' (University of Wisconsin Press, 1991) [See: Fulbeck, Kip, ''Part Asian, 100% Hapa'', Chronicle Books, San Francisco 2006, pp.&amp;nbsp;8, 55, 259].

==Anonymity and celebrity==
Participant names are listed alphabetically in both the photographic exhibition and book (without  index to individual images).  Fulbeck chose participant anonymity both for the safety of the children and as a thematic strategy.  "...I wanted participants to have as blank a slate as possible to work with, to not be burdened by any pre-existing identifiers. It’s interesting with celebrities, because celebrities without their gear – their look or environment or entourage – don’t look like celebrities. They look like people. And that’s what I wanted. I could photograph Cher this way and she’d look like a regular person." &lt;ref name="discovernikkei1"/&gt;

Celebrities in the project include [[Lynda Barry]], [[Wuv Bernardo]], [[Asia Carrera]], [[Karen David]], [[Amy Hill]], [[Sean Lennon]], Liz Masakayan, [[Greg Pak]], [[Sonny Sandoval]], and [[Sandra Tsing Loh]].

==Emerging patterns==
Two-thirds of the project volunteers were part Japanese-American. An overwhelming majority of participants were female, including some shoots where women outnumbered men 20:1.&lt;ref name="discovernikkei1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discovernikkei.org/en/people/clip.php?id=485&amp;nf=1 |accessdate=September 5, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current work==
Fulbeck followed ''Part Asian, 100% Hapa'' with the publication of ''Permanence: Tattoo Portraits by Kip Fulbeck'' in 2008 and ''Mixed: Portraits of Multiracial Kids'' in 2010 (both by [[Chronicle Books]]). Both books also had accompanying solo exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://asianamericanart.blogspot.com/2009/01/permanence-tattoo-portraits-by-kip.html |title=Asian American Art: “Permanence”, Tattoo Portraits By Kip Fulbeck Invisible NYC |publisher=Asianamericanart.blogspot.com |date=2009-01-05 |accessdate=2015-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.janm.org/exhibits/mixed/ |title=About &amp;#124; MIXED: Portraits of Multiracial Kids by Kip Fulbeck &amp;#124; Japanese American National Museum |publisher=Janm.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A major speaker on the college circuit, Fulbeck has spoken on The Hapa Project at hundreds of campuses throughout the U.S. He is represented by The Creative Artists Agency in Los Angeles.

'''''The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism''''' is a book on the [[sociology of religion]] written by [[Max Weber]], a German [[economist]] and [[sociologist]] of the early twentieth century. The original edition was in German under the title '''''Hinduismus und Buddhismus''''' and published in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sagepub.com/mcdonaldizationstudy5/references.htm&lt;/ref&gt; An English translation was made in 1958 and several editions have been released since then.

It was his third major work on the sociology of religion, after ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'' and ''[[The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism]]''. In this work he deals with the structure of Indian [[society]], with the [[orthodoxy|orthodox]] [[doctrine]]s of [[Hinduism]] and the [[heterodoxy|heterodox]] doctrines of [[Buddhism]], with the changes wrought by popular [[religiosity]] and their influence on the [[secular]] [[ethic]] of Indian society.&lt;ref name=rb142&gt;Reinhard Bendix, ''Max Weber: an intellectual portrait'', University of California Press, 1977, p.142&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Hindu social system==

The Indian social system was influenced by the concept of [[Varna (Hinduism)|varna]].&lt;ref name=rb142/&gt; Varna is not caste and caste is not Varna. This is a critical difference not understood by many. It directly linked religious belief and the segregation of society into [[status group]]s. Weber goes on to describe the Varna system (the [[Brahmin]]s - priests, the [[Kshatriya]]s - warriors, the [[Vaishya]]s - merchants, the [[Shudra]]s - laborers and the [[Dalit|Untouchable]]).

Weber pays special attention to Brahmins and considers why they occupied the highest place in Indian society for many centuries. With regards to the concept of [[dharma]] he concludes that the Indian ethical pluralism is very different both from the universal ethic of [[Confucianism]] and [[Christianity]]. He notes that the varna system prevented the development of urban status groups.&lt;ref name=rb147-148&gt;Reinhard Bendix, ''Max Weber: an intellectual portrait'', University of California Press, 1977, p.147-148&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hindu orthodoxy and Brahmin restoration==

After the structure of the society, Weber analysed the Hindu religious beliefs - [[ascetism]] and the Hindu view of the world, the Brahman orthodox doctrines, the rise and fall of Buddhism in India, the Hindu restoration and the evolution of [[guru]].

==Secular ethic and impact of Hindu beliefs on economy==

Weber discussed what influence Hinduism and Buddhism had on the mundane activities, and how they impacted the economy. He noted the idea of unchanging world order consisting of the eternal [[rebirth (Buddhism)|cycle]]s of [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]], and the deprecation of mundane world.&lt;ref name=rb193&gt;Reinhard Bendix, ''Max Weber: an intellectual portrait'', University of California Press, 1977, p.193&lt;/ref&gt; By the [[tradition]]alism of the Varna system supported by the dharma, the economic development is slowed as, - according to Weber - the "spirit" of the varna system worked against the development of [[capitalism]].&lt;ref name=rb196&gt;Reinhard Bendix, ''Max Weber: an intellectual portrait'', University of California Press, 1977, p.196&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asian belief systems==

Weber ended his research of society and religion in India by bringing in insights from [[The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism|his previous work on China]] to discuss similarities of the Asian belief systems. He notes that the beliefs saw the meaning of life as otherworldy [[Mysticism|mystical]] experience. The social world is fundamentally divided between the educated elite, following the guidance of a [[prophet]] or wise man, and the uneducated masses whose beliefs are centered on [[magic (paranormal)|magic]]. In Asia, there was no [[Messianic prophecy]] to ''plan and meaning to the everyday life of educated and uneducated alike''. Weber juxtaposed such Messianic prophecies, notably from the [[Near East]] region to those found on the [[Asia]]tic mainland, focusing more on exemplary ways to live one's life. It was those differences that prevented the countries of the [[Western world|Occident]] from following the paths of the earlier Chinese and Indian civilizations. His next work, [[Ancient Judaism (book)|Ancient Judaism]] was an attempt to prove this theory.&lt;ref name=rb199-201&gt;Reinhard Bendix, ''Max Weber: an intellectual portrait'', University of California Press, 1977, p.199-201&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; of [[High-mountain Asia]]. The plateau is bordered to the south by the [[Himalayas|inner Himalayan range]], to the north by the [[Kunlun Mountains]], which separate it from the [[Tarim Basin]], and to the northeast by the [[Qilian Mountains]], which separate the plateau from the [[Hexi Corridor]] and [[Gobi Desert]]. To the east and southeast the plateau gives way to the forested gorge and ridge geography of the mountainous headwaters of the [[Salween River|Salween]], [[Mekong]], and [[Yangtze]] rivers in northwest [[Yunnan]] and western [[Sichuan]] (the [[Hengduan Mountains]]).  In the west the curve of the rugged [[Karakoram]] range of northern [[Kashmir]] embraces the plateau. The [[Indus River]] originates in the western Tibetan Plateau in the vicinity of [[Lake Manasarovar]].

[[File:Aba County Aba Prefecture Sichuan China.jpg|thumb|[[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] [[stupa]] and houses outside the town of [[Ngawa Town|Ngawa]], on the Tibetan Plateau.|upright=1.2]]
The Tibetan Plateau is bounded in the north by a broad escarpment where the altitude drops from around {{convert|5000|m}} to {{convert|1500|m}} over a horizontal distance of less than {{convert|150|km}}. Along the escarpment is a range of mountains. In the west the [[Kunlun Mountains]] separate the plateau from the Tarim Basin. About halfway across the Tarim the bounding range becomes the [[Altyn-Tagh]] and the Kunluns, by convention, continue somewhat to the south. In the 'V' formed by this split is the western part of the [[Qaidam Basin]]. The Altyn-Tagh ends near the Dangjin pass on the [[Dunhuang]]-[[Golmud]] road. To the west are short ranges called the Danghe, Yema, Shule, and Tulai Nanshans. The easternmost range is the Qilian Mountains. The line of mountains continues east of the plateau as the [[Qinling]], which separates the [[Ordos Plateau]] from Sichuan. North of the mountains runs the Gansu or [[Hexi Corridor]] which was the main silk-road route from [[China proper]] to the West.

The plateau is a high-altitude arid [[steppe]] interspersed with mountain ranges and large [[brackish water|brackish]] lakes. Annual precipitation ranges from {{convert|100|to|300|mm|in}} and falls mainly as hail. The southern and eastern edges of the steppe have grasslands which can sustainably support populations of nomadic herdsmen, although frost occurs for six months of the year. [[Permafrost]] occurs over extensive parts of the plateau. Proceeding to the north and northwest, the plateau becomes progressively higher, colder and drier, until reaching the remote [[Changtang]] region in the northwestern part of the plateau. Here the average altitude exceeds {{convert|5000|m}} and winter temperatures can drop to {{convert|−40|°C}}. As a result of this extremely inhospitable environment, the Changthang region (together with the adjoining Kekexili region) is the least populous region in Asia, and the third least populous area in the world after [[Antarctica]] and northern [[Greenland]].

== Geology and geological history ==
{{Expand section|date=January 2011}}
{{Main article|Geology of the Himalaya}}
[[File:Lake Yamdroktso.jpg|thumb|[[Yamdrok Lake]] is one of the three largest sacred lakes in Tibet.|upright=1.2]]
The geological history of the Tibetan Plateau is closely related to that of the Himalayas. The Himalayas are among the youngest mountain ranges on the planet and consist mostly of uplifted [[sedimentary rock|sedimentary]] and [[metamorphic rock]]. Their formation is a result of a [[continental collision]] or [[orogeny]] along the [[convergent boundary]] between the [[Indo-Australian Plate]] and the [[Eurasian Plate]].

The collision began in the [[Cretaceous|Upper Cretaceous]] period about 70 million years ago, when the north-moving [[Indo-Australian Plate]], moving at about {{Convert|15|cm|4=0|abbr=on}} per year, collided with the [[Eurasian Plate]]. About 50 million years ago, this fast moving Indo-Australian plate had completely closed the [[Tethys Ocean]], the existence of which has been determined by [[sedimentary rock]]s settled on the ocean floor, and the [[volcano]]es that fringed its edges. Since these sediments were light, they crumpled into mountain ranges rather than sinking to the floor. The Indo-Australian plate continues to be driven horizontally below the Tibetan Plateau, which forces the plateau to move upwards; the plateau is still [[tectonic uplift|rising]] at a rate of approximately {{Convert|5|mm|4=1|abbr=on}} per year.

Much of the Tibetan Plateau is of relatively low relief. The cause of this is debated among geologists. Some argue that the Tibetan Plateau is an uplifted [[peneplain]] formed at low altitude, while others argue that the low relief stems from [[erosion]] and [[sedimentary basin|infill]] of topographic depressions that occurred at already high elevations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Lia, Jijun; Ma, Zhenhua; Li, Xiaomiao; Peng, Tingjiang; Guo, Benhong; Zhang, Jun; Song, Chunhui; Liu, Jia; Hui, Zhengchuang; Yu, Hao; Ye, Xiyan; Liu, Shanpin; Wang Xiuxi |date=2017 |title = Late Miocene-Pliocene geomorphological evolution of the Xiaoshuizi peneplain in the Maxian Mountains and its tectonic significance for the northeastern Tibetan Plateau |url= |journal=[[Geomorphology (journal)|Geomorphology]] |volume=295 |issue= |pages=393–405 |doi= 10.1016/j.geomorph.2017.07.024|pmc= |pmid= |access-date=|name-list-format=|bibcode=2017Geomo.295..393L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environment==
The Tibetan Plateau supports a variety of ecosystems, most of them classified as [[montane grasslands]].  While parts of the plateau feature an [[alpine tundra]]-like environment, other areas feature monsoon-influenced shrublands and forests. [[Species diversity]] is generally reduced on the plateau due to the elevation of low precipitation. The Tibetan Plateau hosts species of [[gray wolf]], [[snow leopard]], [[wild yak]], [[Donkey#Feral donkeys and wild asses|wild donkey]], [[Crane (bird)|cranes]], [[vulture]]s, [[hawk]]s, [[goose|geese]], [[snake]]s, and [[water buffalo]]. One notable animal is the [[Euophrys omnisuperstes|high-altitude jumping spider]], that can live at elevations of over {{convert|6500|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/documentaries/natureofthings/2008/wildchina/wildchina3.html|title=Wild China: The Tibetan Plateau|website=The Nature of Things|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Company|accessdate=2013-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ecoregion]]s found on the Tibetan Plateau, as defined by the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], are as follows:
* The [[Pamir alpine desert and tundra]] covers the western end of the Tibetan Plateau where it transitions to the [[Pamir Mountains]]
* The [[North Tibetan Plateau-Kunlun Mountains alpine desert]] covers the northwestern limits of the Tibetan Plateau along the [[Kunlun Mountains]]
* The [[Karakoram-West Tibetan Plateau alpine steppe]] covers the westernmost parts of the Tibetan Plateau and [[Ladakh]]
* The [[Northwestern Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows]] on the edges mountains bordering the extreme west of the Tibetan Plateau
* The [[Central Tibetan Plateau alpine steppe]] covers most of the central portions of the Tibetan Plateau and the eastern [[Changtang]]
* The [[Western Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows]] covers the southwestern plateau in the [[Garuda Valley]] region
* The [[Qaidam Basin semi-desert]] located in the [[Qaidam Basin]] on the northern Tibetan Plateau
* The [[Qilian Mountains subalpine meadows]] covering the [[Qilian Mountains]] in the northernmost portions of the plateau
* The [[Qilian Mountains conifer forests]] covering parts of the mountain ranges in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau
* The [[Tibetan Plateau alpine shrub and meadows]] covering a swath of the central and northeastern Tibetan Plateau
* The [[Yarlung Tsangpo arid steppe]] in the [[Yarlung Tsangpo River|Yarlung Tsangpo River Valley]], where most of the permanent human population on the Tibetan Plateau lives
* The [[Eastern Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows]] cover the southern Tibetan Plateau on the north side of the [[Himalayas]]
* The [[Southeast Tibet shrub and meadows]] cover the southeastern and eastern parts of the plateau and are generally rainier than the other high-altitude Tibetan Plateau regions
* The [[Northeastern Himalayan subalpine conifer forests]] reach up mountain valleys in the southern plateau and contain some of the highest altitude forests in the world
* The [[Nujiang Langcang Gorge alpine conifer and mixed forests]] cover the mountain valleys that reach {{cvt|500|km|mi}} into the southeastern Tibetan Plateau
* The [[Hengduan Mountains subalpine conifer forests]] cover the southeasternmost mountain valleys on the plateau
* The [[Qionglai-Minshan conifer forests]] cover the eastern edges of the plateau and are the densest forests to be found anywhere on the Tibetan Plateau

Archaeological evidence suggests that the colonization leading to the full-time occupation of the plateau occurred much later than the previously thought 30,000 years ago.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}{{Who|date=February 2014}}

The northern portion, the [[Changtang]], is generally too high and cold to support permanent population.&lt;ref name="historical atlas"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ryavec|first1=Karl |title= A Historical Atlas of Tibet |year = 2015 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn = 9780226732442 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most notable civilizations to have developed on the Tibetan Plateau is the [[Tibetan Empire]] from the 7th century to the 9th century AD.

== Impact on other regions ==
=== Role in monsoons ===
{{Main article|Monsoon}}
[[File:Jewel-Toned Lakes of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.jpg|thumb|Natural-colour satellite image of the Tibetan Plateau|upright=1.2]]

Monsoons are caused by the different amplitudes of surface temperature seasonal cycles between land and oceans. This differential warming happens because heating rates differ between land and water. Ocean heating is distributed vertically through a "mixed layer" that may be fifty meters deep through the action of wind and buoyancy-generated [[turbulence]], whereas the land surface conducts heat slowly, with the seasonal signal penetrating only a meter or so. Additionally, the [[specific heat capacity]] of liquid water is significantly greater than that of most materials that make up land. Together, these factors mean that the heat capacity of the layer participating in the seasonal cycle is much larger over the oceans than over land, with the consequence that the land warms and cools faster than the ocean. In turn, air over the land warms faster and reaches a higher temperature than does air over the ocean.&lt;ref name="Oracle"&gt;Oracle Thinkquest Education Foundation. [http://library.thinkquest.org/C003603/english/monsoons/causesofmonsoons.shtml monsoons: causes of monsoons.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416181043/http://library.thinkquest.org/C003603/english/monsoons/causesofmonsoons.shtml |date=16 April 2009 }} Retrieved on 22 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The warmer air over land tends to rise, creating an area of [[low pressure]]. The pressure anomaly then causes a steady wind to blow toward the land, which brings the moist air over the ocean surface with it. Rainfall is then increased by the presence of the moist ocean air. The rainfall is stimulated by a variety of mechanisms, such as low-level air being lifted upwards by mountains, surface heating, convergence at the surface, divergence aloft, or from storm-produced outflows near the surface. When such lifting occurs, the air cools due expansion in lower pressure, which in turn produces [[condensation]] and precipitation.

In winter, the land cools off quickly, but the ocean maintains the heat longer. The hot air over the ocean rises, creating a low-pressure area and a breeze from land to ocean while a large area of drying high pressure is formed over the land, increased by wintertime cooling.&lt;ref name="Oracle"/&gt; Monsoons are similar to [[sea breezes|sea and land breezes]], a term usually referring to the localized, [[diurnal cycle]] of circulation near coastlines everywhere, but they are much larger in scale, stronger and seasonal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[BBC]] Weather|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041101181531/http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/features/understanding/monsoon.shtml|archivedate=2004-11-01|title= The Asian Monsoon|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/features/understanding/monsoon.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seasonal monsoon wind shift and weather associated with the heating and cooling of the Tibetan plateau is the strongest such monsoon on Earth.

==Glaciology: the Ice Age and at present==
[[Image:Himalayas.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The Himalayas as seen from space looking south from over the Tibetan Plateau.]]
Today, Tibet is an important heating surface of the atmosphere. However, during the [[Last Glacial Maximum]], an approximately {{convert|2400000|km2|sqmi}} ice sheet covered the plateau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Matthias|last=Kuhle|year=1998|title=Reconstruction of the 2.4 Million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Late Pleistocene Ice Sheet on the Tibetan Plateau and its Impact on the Global Climate|journal=Quaternary International|volume=45/46|pages=71–108|doi=10.1016/S1040-6182(97)00008-6|bibcode=1998QuInt..45...71K}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuhle|first=M|year=2004|chapter=The High Glacial (Last Ice Age and LGM) ice cover in High and Central Asia|title=Development in Quaternary Science 2c (Quaternary Glaciation – Extent and Chronology, Part III: South America, Asia, Africa, Australia, Antarctica)|editor1-last=Ehlers|editor1-first=J.|editor2-last=Gibbard|editor2-first=P.L.|pages=175–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=K1999&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuhle|first=M.|year=1999|journal=GeoJournal|volume=47|issue=1–2|title=Tibet and High Asia V. Results of Investigations into High Mountain Geomorphology, Paleo-Glaciology and Climatology of the Pleistocene|pages=3–276|doi=10.1023/A:1007039510460}}
See chapter entitled: "Reconstruction of an approximately complete Quaternary Tibetan Inland Glaciation between the Mt. Everest and Cho Oyu Massifs and the Aksai Chin. – A new glaciogeomorphological southeast-northwest diagonal profile through Tibet and its consequences for the glacial isostasy and Ice Age cycle".&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its great extent, this glaciation in the subtropics was an important element of [[radiative forcing]]. With a much lower latitude, the ice in Tibet reflected at least four times more radiation energy per unit area into space than ice at higher [[latitude]]s. Thus, while the modern plateau heats the overlying atmosphere, during the Last Ice Age it helped to cool it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuhle|first=M.|year=1988|title=The Pleistocene Glaciation of Tibet and the Onset of Ice Ages – An Autocycle Hypothesis|journal=GeoJournal|volume=17|issue=4|id=Tibet and High-Asia I. Results of the Sino-German Joint Expeditions (I)|pages=581–96|doi=10.1007/BF00209444}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This cooling had multiple effects on regional climate. Without the [[thermal low]] pressure caused by the heating, there was no [[monsoon]] over the Indian subcontinent. This lack of monsoon caused [[pluvial|extensive rainfall]] over the [[Sahara]], expansion of the [[Thar Desert]], more dust deposited into the [[Arabian Sea]], and a lowering of the [[life zone|biotic life zones]] on the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Animals responded to this shift in climate, with the [[Javan rusa]] migrating into India.&lt;ref name=K2001&gt;{{cite journal|first=Matthias|last=Kuhle|year=2001|title=The Tibetan Ice Sheet; its Impact on the Palaeomonsoon and Relation to the Earth's Orbital Variations|journal=Polarforschung|volume=71|pages=1–13|issue=1/2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the glaciers in Tibet created [[glacial lake|meltwater lakes]] in the [[Qaidam Basin]], the [[Tarim Basin]], and the [[Gobi Desert]], despite the strong [[evaporation]] caused by the low latitude. [[Rock flour|Silt]] and clay from the glaciers accumulated in these lakes; when the lakes dried at the end of the ice age, the silt and clay were [[aeolian processes|blown]] by the [[katabatic wind|downslope wind]] off the Plateau. These airborne fine grains produced the enormous amount of [[loess]] in the Chinese lowlands.&lt;ref name=K2001/&gt;

===Effect of climate change===
The Tibetan Plateau contains the world's third-largest store of ice. Qin Dahe, the former head of the [[China Meteorological Administration]], issued the following assessment in 2009:
{{quote|Temperatures are rising four times faster than elsewhere in China, and the Tibetan glaciers are retreating at a higher speed than in any other part of the world. [...] In the short term, this will cause lakes to expand and bring floods and mudflows. [...] In the long run, the glaciers are vital lifelines for Asian rivers, including the Indus and the Ganges. Once they vanish, water supplies in those regions will be in peril.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5g1eE4Xw3njaW1MKpJRYOch4hOdLQ |title = Global warming benefits to Tibet: Chinese official |date=2009-08-18 |agency = AFP }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Legal education in the United States}}
'''Trial practice''' is an upper level course offered in most American [[law school]]s designed to teach future [[litigation|litigators]] the fine points of presenting a case to a [[judge]] and [[jury]]. Unlike most law school courses, a trial practice class has very little discussion of [[substantive law]], and is focused on the practical application of [[public speaking]], [[narrative]], and using [[body language]] to communicate a particular set of events to the triers of fact. Trial practice also contains elements of [[strategy]], teaching students how to decide the order in which witnesses should testify, when exhibits should be introduced, and how to trap opposing witnesses into giving testimony that damages their side.

[[evidence (law)|Evidence]] is the area of substantive law most reinforced by a trial practice course, with students learning how to apply evidence law in a real-life setting, including learning when they can object to questions asked of witnesses, what objections to raise, and how to effectively present objections.

Trial practice courses may have a classroom component.  Also, trial practice courses will usually have an ongoing "lab" component where an attorney will instruct a small group of students on trial skills and assist them in honing their craft. Often, students practice against one another in [[mock trial]]s throughout the course; for example, students may be divided into groups of 4, with each group containing two teams who practice against one another in mock trials. 

Rather than a [[final exam]], the course may culminate in a mock trial with volunteer "witnesses".

The School of Agricultural and Life Sciences ('''Ecole Nationale Supérieure Agronomique de Toulouse''') is a [[France|French]] public and national [[Grande Ecole]] in agricultural and life sciences, funded by the Ministry of Higher Education and Research and member of [[Toulouse Tech]]. The ENSAT is a school of the National Polytechnic Institute of Toulouse (INPT), a university federating several schools dealing with engineering, agriculture and veterinary sciences, chemistry, meteorology.

ENSAT works with seven laboratories joint to INRA or CNRS, and several industrial partners.

==History==
Founded in 1909 by [[Paul Sabatier (chemist)|Paul Sabatier]], Nobel prize in chemistry, the institute became ENSAT in 1970 and  joined forces with [[INP-ENSIACET]] and [[INP-ENSEEIHT]] to create the [[National Polytechnic Institute of Toulouse]].

==Training==
ENSAT's mission is to offer training, research and expertise, based on the specialities of the research teams: Food, Sustainable Agriculture, Biotechnology, Environment and Territories.  International students have the opportunity to prepare for an Engineer’s degree in Agricultural Sciences (equivalent to a master's degree), several master's degrees in Agricultural Sciences, Food Sciences or Environmental Sciences, and the possibility of completing a PhD.

==Research==
There are seven research teams working on: 
* Chemistry Laboratory (LGC)
* Impact of farming and forestry on ecosystems (DYNAFOR)
* Biogeochemical functions of ecosystems (ECOLAB)
* Genomics and biotechnology of fruit (GBF)
* Agro-systems and rural development (AGIR)
* Animal production and nutrition (TANDEM)
* Socio-economy of rural territories (DYNAMIQUES RURALES)

==Programs for exchange students==
ENSAT cooperates with institutions all over the world through student exchanges with other European countries ([[ERASMUS]]), Latin America as well as with the U.S. and Canada.

Exchange students can select a list of courses within the following programs: 
* '''ENSAT Agro-engineer’s programme''' (courses in French), in one of the options:
**''Plant Bio sciences'' – Biotechnology, plant breeding, plant protection
**''Agro-geomatics'' – Remote sensing, GIS
**''Agro-Management'' – Project management, Business Administration, Marketing 
**''Food Industry'' – Innovation and product quality

In [[mathematics]], '''Łukasiewicz logic''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|l|uː|k|ə|ˈ|ʃ|ɛ|v|ɪ|tʃ}}; {{IPA-pl|wukaˈɕɛvʲitʂ|lang}}) is a [[non-classical logic|non-classical]], [[many-valued logic]]. It was originally defined in the early 20th century by [[Jan Łukasiewicz]] as a [[three-valued logic]];&lt;ref name="Luk1920"&gt;Łukasiewicz J., 1920, O logice trójwartościowej (in Polish). Ruch filozoficzny '''5''':170–171. English translation: On three-valued logic, in L. Borkowski (ed.), ''Selected works by Jan Łukasiewicz'', North–Holland, Amsterdam, 1970, pp. 87–88. {{isbn|0-7204-2252-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was later generalized to ''n''-valued (for all finite ''n'') as well as [[infinite-valued logic|infinitely-many-valued]] (ℵ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;-valued) variants, both propositional and first-order.&lt;ref name="Hay1963"&gt;Hay, L.S., 1963, Axiomatization of the infinite-valued predicate calculus. ''Journal of Symbolic Logic'' '''28''':77–86.&lt;/ref&gt; The ℵ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;-valued version was published in 1930 by Łukasiewicz and [[Alfred Tarski]]; consequently it is sometimes called the '''Łukasiewicz-Tarski logic'''.&lt;ref name="Ciungu2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lavinia Corina Ciungu|title=Non-commutative Multiple-Valued Logic Algebras|year=2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-01589-7|page=vii}} citing Łukasiewicz, J., Tarski, A.: [http://chc60.fgcu.edu/images/articles/lukasiewicztarski.pdf Untersuchungen über den Aussagenkalkül]. Comp. Rend. Soc.
Sci. et Lettres Varsovie Cl. III 23, 30–50 (1930).&lt;/ref&gt; It belongs to the classes of [[t-norm fuzzy logics]]&lt;ref name="Hájek1998"&gt;Hájek P., 1998, ''Metamathematics of Fuzzy Logic''. Dordrecht: Kluwer.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[substructural logic]]s.&lt;ref name="Ono2003"&gt;Ono, H., 2003, "Substructural logics and residuated lattices — an introduction". In F.V. Hendricks, J. Malinowski (eds.): Trends in Logic: 50 Years of Studia Logica, ''Trends in Logic'' '''20''': 177–212.&lt;/ref&gt;

This article presents the Łukasiewicz[-Tarski] logic in its full generality, i.e. as an infinite-valued logic. For an elementary introduction to the three-valued instantiation Ł&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, see [[three-valued logic]].

== Language ==
The propositional connectives of Łukasiewicz logic are
''implication'' &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;,
''negation'' &lt;math&gt;\neg&lt;/math&gt;,
''equivalence'' &lt;math&gt;\leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt;,
''weak conjunction'' &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt;,
''[[strong conjunction]]'' &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt;,
''weak disjunction'' &lt;math&gt;\vee&lt;/math&gt;,
''[[strong disjunction]]'' &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt;,
and propositional constants &lt;math&gt;\overline{0}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{1}&lt;/math&gt;.
The presence of conjunction and disjunction is a common feature of substructural logics without the rule of contraction, to which Łukasiewicz logic belongs.

== Axioms ==
{{expand section|additional axioms for finite-valued logics|date=August 2014}}
The original system of axioms for propositional infinite-valued Łukasiewicz logic used implication and negation as the primitive connectives:
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
                                          A &amp;\rightarrow (B \rightarrow A) \\
                          (A \rightarrow B) &amp;\rightarrow ((B \rightarrow C) \rightarrow (A \rightarrow C)) \\
          ((A \rightarrow B) \rightarrow B) &amp;\rightarrow ((B \rightarrow A) \rightarrow A) \\
                (\neg B \rightarrow \neg A) &amp;\rightarrow (A \rightarrow B).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Propositional infinite-valued Łukasiewicz logic can also be axiomatized by adding the following axioms to the axiomatic system of [[monoidal t-norm logic]]:
; Divisibility: &lt;math&gt;(A \wedge B) \rightarrow (A \otimes (A \rightarrow B))&lt;/math&gt;
; Double negation: &lt;math&gt;\neg\neg A \rightarrow A.&lt;/math&gt;

That is, infinite-valued Łukasiewicz logic arises by adding the axiom of double negation to basic t-norm logic [[BL (logic)|BL]], or by adding the axiom of divisibility to the logic IMTL.

Finite-valued Łukasiewicz logics require additional axioms.

== Real-valued semantics ==
Infinite-valued Łukasiewicz logic is a [[infinite-valued logic|real-valued logic]] in which sentences from [[sentential calculus]] may be assigned a [[truth value]] of not only zero or one but also any [[real number]] in between (e.g. 0.25). Valuations have a [[recursion|recursive]] definition where:
* &lt;math&gt;w(\theta \circ \phi) = F_\circ(w(\theta), w(\phi))&lt;/math&gt; for a binary connective &lt;math&gt;\circ,&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;w(\neg\theta) = F_\neg(w(\theta)),&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;w\left(\overline{0}\right) = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w\left(\overline{1}\right) = 1,&lt;/math&gt;

and where the definitions of the operations hold as follows:
* '''Implication:''' &lt;math&gt;F_\rightarrow(x,y) = \min\{1, 1 - x + y\}&lt;/math&gt;
* '''Equivalence:''' &lt;math&gt;F_\leftrightarrow(x, y) = 1 - |x - y|&lt;/math&gt;
* '''Negation:''' &lt;math&gt;F_\neg(x) = 1 - x&lt;/math&gt;
* '''Weak Conjunction:''' &lt;math&gt;F_\wedge(x, y) = \min\{x, y\}&lt;/math&gt;
* '''Weak Disjunction:''' &lt;math&gt;F_\vee(x, y) = \max\{x, y\}&lt;/math&gt;
* '''Strong Conjunction:''' &lt;math&gt;F_\otimes(x, y) = \max\{0, x + y - 1\}&lt;/math&gt;
* '''Strong Disjunction:''' &lt;math&gt;F_\oplus(x, y) = \min\{1, x + y\}.&lt;/math&gt;

The truth function &lt;math&gt;F_\otimes&lt;/math&gt; of strong conjunction is the Łukasiewicz [[t-norm]] and the truth function &lt;math&gt;F_\oplus&lt;/math&gt; of strong disjunction is its dual [[t-norm#T-conorms|t-conorm]]. The truth function &lt;math&gt;F_\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; is the [[t-norm#Residuum|residuum]] of the Łukasiewicz t-norm. All truth functions of the basic connectives are continuous.

By definition, a formula is a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]] of infinite-valued Łukasiewicz logic if it evaluates to 1 under any valuation of [[propositional variable]]s by real numbers in the interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1].

== Finite-valued and countable-valued semantics ==
Using exactly the same valuation formulas as for real-valued semantics Łukasiewicz (1922) also defined (up to isomorphism) semantics over  
* any [[finite-valued logic|finite set]] of cardinality ''n'' ≥ 2 by choosing the domain as {{nowrap|{ 0, 1/(''n'' − 1), 2/(''n'' − 1), ..., 1 }}}
* any [[countable set]] by choosing the domain as { ''p''/''q'' | 0 ≤ ''p'' ≤ ''q'' where ''p'' is a non-negative integer and ''q'' is a positive integer }.

== General algebraic semantics ==
The standard real-valued semantics determined by the Łukasiewicz t-norm is not the only possible semantics of Łukasiewicz logic. General [[algebraic semantics (mathematical logic)|algebraic semantics]] of propositional infinite-valued Łukasiewicz logic is formed by the class of all [[MV-algebra]]s. The standard real-valued semantics is a special MV-algebra, called the ''standard MV-algebra''.

Like other [[t-norm fuzzy logics]], propositional infinite-valued Łukasiewicz logic enjoys completeness with respect to the class of all algebras for which the logic is sound (that is, MV-algebras) as well as with respect to only linear ones. This is expressed by the general, linear, and standard completeness theorems:&lt;ref name="Hájek1998"/&gt;
:The following conditions are equivalent:
:* &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is provable in propositional infinite-valued Łukasiewicz logic
:* &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is valid in all MV-algebras (''general completeness'')
:* &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is valid in all [[total order|linearly ordered]] MV-algebras (''linear completeness'')
:* &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is valid in the standard MV-algebra (''standard completeness'').

Font, Rodriguez and Torrens introduced in 1984 the Wajsberg algebra as an alternative model for the infinite-valued Łukasiewicz logic.&lt;ref&gt;http://journal.univagora.ro/download/pdf/28.pdf citing J. M. Font, A. J. Rodriguez, A. Torrens, Wajsberg Algebras, Stochastica, VIII, 1, 5-31, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1940s attempt by [[Grigore Moisil]] to provide algebraic semantics for the ''n''-valued Łukasiewicz logic by means of his [[Łukasiewicz–Moisil algebra|Łukasiewicz–Moisil (LM) algebra]] (which Moisil called ''Łukasiewicz algebras'') turned out to be an incorrect [[model (mathematical logic)|model]] for ''n'' ≥ 5. This issue was made public by Alan Rose in 1956.  [[C. C. Chang]]'s MV-algebra, which is a model for the ℵ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;-valued (infinitely-many-valued) Łukasiewicz-Tarski logic, was published in 1958. For the axiomatically more complicated (finite) ''n''-valued Łukasiewicz logics, suitable algebras were published in 1977 by Revaz Grigolia and called MV&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-algebras.&lt;ref name="Ciungu2013bis"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lavinia Corina Ciungu|title=Non-commutative Multiple-Valued Logic Algebras|year=2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-01589-7|pages=vii-viii}} citing Grigolia, R.S.: "Algebraic analysis of Lukasiewicz-Tarski’s n-valued logical systems". In: Wójcicki, R., Malinkowski, G. (eds.) Selected Papers on Lukasiewicz Sentential Calculi, pp. 81–92. Polish Academy of Sciences, Wroclav (1977)&lt;/ref&gt; MV&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-algebras are a subclass of LM&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-algebras, and the inclusion is strict for ''n'' ≥ 5.&lt;ref&gt;Iorgulescu, A.: Connections between MV&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-algebras and ''n''-valued Łukasiewicz–Moisil algebras—I. Discrete Math. 181, 155–177 (1998) {{doi|10.1016/S0012-365X(97)00052-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982 Roberto Cignoli published some additional constraints that added to LM&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-algebras produce proper models for ''n''-valued Łukasiewicz logic; Cignoli called his discovery ''proper Łukasiewicz algebras''.&lt;ref&gt;R.
