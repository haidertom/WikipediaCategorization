      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8955">The '''As d'Or''' (''Golden Ace'') is a games award given out by a jury at the '''Festival International des Jeux''' in [[Cannes, France]].

The awards were established in 1988. From 1989 to 2003, a jury of journalists allotted "Golden Aces" by category to games presented by their editors.  A special prize, the ''Super As d'Or'', was allotted to the best game from any category.

In 2003, the process was modified to give more autonomy to the jury.  A single As d'Or was awarded, and 10 nominees were announced.

In 2005, the award merged with the [[Jeu de l'Année]].  It was decided that the combined award should be named after the year of awarding rather than year of publication, so the first combined award was the 2005 ''As d'Or Jeu de l'Année'' with awards in three categories: general public/family games, experts, and children. In 2012, the ''As d'Or Prix du Jury'' was added.

'''''Awakenings'''''  is a 1973 [[Non-fiction|non-fiction book]] by [[Oliver Sacks]]. It recounts the life histories  of those who had been victims of the 1920s [[encephalitis lethargica]] epidemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Fiona | last = MacCarthy | authorlink=Fiona MacCarthy |newspaper = [[The Times]] | date = 5 December 1985 | title = Travels round a couch}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sacks chronicles his efforts in the late 1960s to help these patients at the Beth Abraham Hospital (now [[Montefiore Medical Center|Beth Abraham Health Services]]) in the [[Bronx]], [[New York City|New York]]. The treatment used the then-new drug [[L-DOPA]].

In 1982, Dr. Sacks wrote:
{{Quote |I have become much more optimistic than I was when I […] wrote ''Awakenings,'' for there has been a significant number of patients who, following the vicissitudes of their first years on L-DOPA, came to do – and still do – extremely well.  Such patients have undergone an ''enduring'' awakening, and enjoy possibilities of life which had been impossible, unthinkable, before the coming of L-DOPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Amazon | url = https://www.amazon.com/Awakenings-Oliver-Sacks/dp/0375704051 | title = Awakenings | first = Oliver | last = Sacks}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The book inspired the 1982 play ''[[A Kind of Alaska]]'' by [[Harold Pinter]], performed as part of a trilogy of Pinter's plays titled ''Other Places'', and a documentary television episode, the pilot of the British television programme ''[[Discovery (British TV programme)|Discovery]]''. It was also made into a 1990 Oscar-nominated film, ''[[Awakenings]]'' starring [[Robert De Niro]] and [[Robin Williams]].

The 1976 edition of the book is dedicated to the memory of poet [[W. H. Auden]], and bears an extract from Auden's 1969 poem ''The Art of Healing'':
{{Quote |&lt;poem&gt;'Healing',
Papa would tell me,
'is not a science,
but the intuitive art
of wooing Nature.'&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Prior to his 1973 death, Auden himself wrote: "Have read the book and think it a masterpiece".&lt;ref&gt;Sacks, O. (1976), ''Awakenings'', Harmondsworth: [[Pelican Books]], back cover blurb&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974 the book won the [[Hawthornden Prize]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.librarything.com/bookaward/Hawthornden+Prize|title=Hawthornden Prize - Book awards - LibraryThing|website=www.librarything.com|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mnstate.edu/schwartz/hawthornden.htm|title=Hawthornden Prize|website=web.mnstate.edu|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It made its debut on 6 December 2010 and ended on 7 January 2011. This drama serial consists of 25 episodes, and was screened on every weekday night at 9:00 pm.

Being the end-year [[MediaCorp Channel 8|Channel 8]] blockbuster of 2010, It was the tenth Channel 8 drama to be fully filmed in [[High-definition television|HD]] and the first to be filmed in [[Dolby Digital]].

This drama will be encored from 30 November 2011 to 3 January 2012 at midnight, and this time rated &lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;PG&lt;/span&gt; for violence, similar to [[The Ultimatum]]. However, [[The Family Court]] and [[The Score (TV series)|The Score]] were not being broadcast at midnight, but at 5.30pm instead.

''Breakout'' was one of two blockbuster dramas for the year 2010 and has been mistaken to be Channel 8's anniversary special. There were no anniversary dramas that year.It was known as Best Drama Serial in 2010 at [[Star Awards]].

==Title==
The drama's title translates to the [[technical analysis|Technical Analysis]] term in financial markets, referring to super-villain Yang Tianwei's attempt to trade using that strategy so as to get rich quickly enough to seek revenge for his murdered son rather than wait for justice to be meted out.

==Synopsis==
On her 12th birthday, Tang Ying (younger portrayed by Regine Lim, older portrayed by [[Zhou Ying (actress)|Zhou Ying]]) lost her parents and older brother to a tragic road accident. Although she survived, she lapsed into a coma for 13 years. When she came out of her coma, she was stunned to realize that she was no longer a 12-year-old girl but a 25-year-old young woman. Trapped in an older body with her memory still frozen at age 12, Tang Ying struggles to cope with reality which includes the cruel truth that her family is dead.

Tang Ying suspects that there is more to the tragic road accident which claimed the lives of her entire family. As a result, Tang Ying embarks on a rigorous routine to learn and to familiarize herself with a society that has changed tremendously in the years when she was unconscious.

During this time, she befriends Zou Jieming (portrayed by [[Elvin Ng]]), an [[Autism|autistic]] but highly intelligent [[Savant syndrome|savant]], and Situ Dongcheng (portrayed by [[Christopher Lee (Malaysian actor)|Christopher Lee]]), a down-and-out former lawyer who has lost everything he treasured in his life. Together, they embark on a battle against Yang Tianwei (portrayed by [[Guo Liang (actor)|Guo Liang]]), a cruel, ruthless and cunning man who will stop at nothing in his quest to avenge his dead son Zhenjie. Tianwei's children, Chris Yang Zhenfeng (portrayed by [[Dai Xiangyu]]) and Nianqing (portrayed by [[Jeanette Aw]]), assist him in his evil deeds. It is revealed that Yang Tianwei had planned the murder of the Tang Yaozu and his family for a past grudge using a road accident and it was not an isolated incident. Will Tang Ying, Jieming and Dongcheng be able to bring him to justice before he ruins more lives?

The '''Canadian Historical Dinner Service''', originally called the '''Cabot Commemorative State Dinner Service''', is 204-piece eight-course dinner service with 24 place settings of hand-painted porcelain. It was created in 1896–97 to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the discovery of Canada by [[John Cabot]]. The illustrations all have Canadian subjects, and no two pieces are the same.

==Background==
[[File:Soup plate - Entrance to Fort Lennox - Clara Elizabeth Galbreaith.jpg|thumb|Soup plate ''Entrance to Fort Lennox'' by Clara Elizabeth Galbreaith (1864-1941)]]
In 1896 the [[Woman's Art Association of Canada]] (WAAC) decided to commission a state dinner service to be painted on china by members of the association.{{sfn|Lerner|Williamson|1991|p=271}}
The WAAC formed a Ceramic Committee, which pulled together photographs and drawings of old forts, battlefields and other historical scenes.{{sfn|Elwood|1977|p=41}}
The committee also assembled reproductions of Canadian game, fish, shells, ferns and flowers.
A competition of Canadian ceramic artists was held, and the work was divided among them "according to their individual proficiency in the painting of various subjects."{{sfn|Elwood|1977|p=42}}
The artists were to represent each province of Canada.{{sfn|Elwood|1977|p=41}}
In fact the chosen artists were from Ontario, Quebec and Nova Scotia.{{sfn|Elwood|1977|p=42}}
Eight of the artists were from Toronto.{{sfn|Elwood|1977|p=44}}

[[Mary Ella Dignam]], first president of the Women's Art Association of Canada, was the driving force behind production of the dinner service.{{sfn|Mary Ella Dignam, WAAC}}
Dignam supervised the work of [[Alice Egan]] and other Ontario and Quebec artists.{{sfn|Lerner|Williamson|1991|p=271}}
These included [[Lily Osman Adams]] (1865–1945) and [[Phoebe Amelia Watson]] (1858–1947).{{sfn|The Artists, Canadian Museum of History}}
The dinner service for eight courses with 24 place settings was to commemorate the 400th anniversary in 1897 of [[John Cabot]]'s discovery of Canada.{{sfn|Creating the Dinner Service, CMH}}
Sixteen Canadian women artists were chosen to paint the 204{{efn|One source gives 192 pieces.{{sfn|Mary Ella Dignam, WAAC}} Another gives 204 pieces.{{sfn|Bryers|2007}} A third source inexplicably gives 208.{{sfn|Elwood|1977|p=42}} 8 courses and 24 settings would give 192 pieces, assuming a cup and saucer is considered one piece. The discrepancy between the first two may be due to whether or not the twelve coffee cups and saucers of Limoges porcelain are counted.}} china blanks with Canadian historical scenes and birds, ferns, fish, flowers and fruits.{{sfn|Bryers|2007}} 
They were given details of the plates or cups and saucers they were to paint, and worked independently.{{sfn|The Cabot Commemorative State Service ... History, CMH|p=2}}

The WAAC arranged to obtain the china blanks. According to the Secretary of the WAAC, E .J . Thompson, "our object was to get nothing but the best, for we want our State Set to be as near perfect as possible . . . . Sir [[Henry Doulton]] has taken quite an interest in our State Set and has given us the only plain china with the red factory mark that has ever left the factory to be decorated, and has sent us their best china and at the lowest price ."{{sfn|Elwood|1977|p=44}}
Mary E. Dignam wrote to Alice Egan that the blanks would cost $6.60 a dozen to the artist. "Your best work is expected - not less than $60.00 will be asked per dozen in disposing of the set, proceeds to go to the artist, less 10%. Details of border of gold edge and W.A.A. stamp will be sent you, when you are ready for them. The pieces are be finished by May 18th [1897]."{{sfn|Elwood|1977|p=44}}
The dinner service was not assembled as whole, inspected and approved until 7 July 1897.{{sfn|The Cabot Commemorative State Service ... History, CMH|p=2}}

==Plates==

All of the plates are painted on circular bone china blanks from [[Doulton &amp; Co.]] of Burslem, Staffordshire, England, with twenty-four plates of each type.
All but the desert plates have scalloped rims, and all but the game plates and dessert plates are bordered with a gilt scroll and trellis design.{{sfn|The Dinner Service, CMH}}
The soup plates each have a shallow bowl decorated with a historic Canadian landscape. 
The heraldic shield of the landscape's province is included on the border.{{sfn|The Dinner Service, CMH}}
Clara Elizabeth Galbreaith of [[Hamilton, Ontario]], painted twelve of the soup plates, and Phoebe Amelia Watson of [[Doon, Ontario]], painted the other twelve.{{sfn|Clara Elizabeth Galbreaith, CMH}}{{sfn|Phoebe Amelia Watson, CMH}}

[[File:Dinner plate - Parliament Buildings and Ottawa River - Martha Logan.jpg|thumb|Dinner plate ''Parliament Buildings and Ottawa River'' by Martha Logan (1863-1937)]]
The fish plates illustrate  Canadian freshwater and saltwater fish, shells and seaweeds.{{sfn|The Dinner Service, CMH}}
Lily Osman Adams of [[Toronto]] painted eighteen of the fish plates, with underwater designs, and Louise Couen, also of Toronto, painted the other six.{{sfn|ADAMS, Lily Osman, Concordia}}{{sfn|M. Louise Couen, CMH}}
The dinner plates show historic landscapes, and also include the heraldic shield of the province in the border design.{{sfn|The Dinner Service, CMH}}
Margaret Irvine of Toronto and Martha Logan, originally from [[Hartford, Connecticut]], each painted twelve of the dinner plates.{{sfn|Margaret Irvine, CMH}}{{sfn|Martha Logan, CMH}}  Margaret Irvine was born in County Fermanagh, Ireland, sometime between 1847 and 1856.  She was the daughter of William Irvine and Jane Dignam, who came to Canada from County Fermanagh, Ireland, between 1846 and 1859.  The Irvine Family settled in London, Middlesex, Ontario, Canada.

The game plates each depict a different Canadian game bird, and the borders are decorated with plants from the bird's habitat. 
Small maple leaf motifs decorate the rims.{{sfn|The Dinner Service, CMH}}
Alice Egan of [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]], was chosen to paint twelve of the game plates, and Elizabeth Whitney of St. Catherine's Street in [[Montreal]] to paint the other twelve.
They were asked to decide how they would divide the task. Alice wrote "I chose the ducks, or rather my father did.{{sfn|Elwood|1977|p=42}}{{efn|
Alice Egan's father, Colonel T.J. Egan, was a respected taxidermist.{{sfn|Elwood|1977|p=42}} }} My father was afraid that other artists would paint the birds with deformed legs and wings, as they paid no attention to bird's joints.{{sfn|Elwood|1977|p=42}}
Her father was a hunter, and she used his [[John James Audubon|Audubon]] books as guides for her illustrations.{{sfn|Morrison|2014}}

==Reception==
[[File:Dessert plate - Redcurrants - Painted by AM Judd.jpg|thumb|Dessert plate ''Redcurrants'' Alice M. Judd (died 1943)]]
In July 1897 the service was put on display in Toronto.{{sfn|The Cabot Commemorative State Service ... History, CMH|p=2}}
It was then exhibited in Montreal and [[Quebec City]].{{sfn|The Cabot Commemorative State Service ... History, CMH|p=3}}
The finished product was well received.{{sfn|Lerner|Williamson|1991|p=271}}
It was called "a most valuable and interesting work on a large scale, accomplished by the most representative talent in the Dominion ... it is hoped that it will be accepted by the government and placed where it may be seen and studied and preserved to mark the first era in ceramics in Canada."{{sfn|Elwood|1977|p=46}}
However, the government was unwilling to pay the asking price of CDN$1,000.{{sfn|The Cabot Commemorative State Service ... History, CMH|p=3}}

Mary Dignam and [[Lady Edgar]], wife of the speaker of the House of Commons of Canada, asked some members of the Senate and House of Commons for help. 
They arranged for the service to be bought at the artists' prices by private subscriptions from members of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada.
On 13 June 1898 the service was formally presented by the members to [[Ishbel Hamilton-Gordon, Marchioness of Aberdeen and Temair|Lady Aberdeen]] after the end of the term of her husband as Governor General.{{sfn|Elwood|1977|p=46}}
In accepting the gift, Lady Aberdeen made an eloquent speech that ended,{{sfn|Elwood|1977|p=46}}

{{quote|These painted scenes will remind us of many voices from prairie, lake and river which will haunt us in our home, but there will be an undertone of deeper voices which will speak of human love and friendships and these voices will form a choir invisible and will speak to us in the truest music of Canada.{{sfn|Elwood|1977|p=46}}}}

The service was shipped to Scotland and placed on display in [[Haddo House]], home of the Countess and Earl of Aberdeen.

This is still its home, although the house and the ceramic display are now the property of the [[National Trust for Scotland]].{{sfn|The Cabot Commemorative State Service ... History, CMH|p=3}}

'''Casavant Frères Ltée. Opus 1841''' is a [[pipe organ]] [[Organ building|built]] by the famous [[Casavant Frères]] of [[Saint-Hyacinthe]], [[Quebec]]. The organ was first completed in 1911 as '''Casavant Brothers - Opus 452''' for '''St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church''' at 40 Bentinck Street, [[Sydney, Nova Scotia]], [[Canada]]. '''St. Andrew's''' later became '''St. Andrew's United Church''' and is now the '''[[Highland Arts Theatre]]'''.

'''Opus 1841''' is presently composed of 33 [[organ stop|speaking stops]] spread over three [[Manual (music)|manuals]]  and [[Pedal keyboard|pedals]]. The 2,045 [[Organ pipe|pipe]] organ is the largest such instrument on [[Cape Breton Island]].&lt;ref name="St. Andrew's United Church Sydney"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The original specification was for three manuals, 4 divisions, 29 stops, 27 registers, 29 ranks, 1843 pipes. A Stoplist for the 1911 instrument copied from the factory specifications for '''Casavant Opus 452''' 1911 3/29, courtesy of the Casavant Frères Archives, St. Hyacinthe, Québec, Canada is available by following this link: [http://database.organsociety.org/SingleOrganDetails.php?OrganID=48983 Original Stoplist]

The organ was rebuilt, including electrification, in 1946 by Casavant Frères Ltée. as '''Opus 1841''', at a cost of $7,600.00.  Work included three new Choir stops, a new traditional style [[Organ console|console]] with [[Rolltop desk|roll top]], three manuals, 4 divisions, 33 stops, 30 registers, 32 ranks, 2045 pipes. Manual compass is 61 notes, pedal compass is 32 notes. Equipped with [[Electro-pneumatic action|electro-pneumatic (EP)]] chests, drawknobs in vertical rows on angled jambs, [[Expression pedal#Balanced swell pedal|balanced swell shoes/pedals]] at standard [[American Guild of Organists|AGO placement]], adjustable [[Combination action|combination pistons]], AGO Standard (concave radiating) pedalboard, reversible full organ/tutti toe stud, combination action thumb pistons, combination action toe studs, coupler reversible thumb pistons, coupler reversible toe studs.

In 1962 further work was undertaken, the Clarion 4' replaced the Vox Humana, the Trompette 8' replaced the Cornopean, &amp; the Hooded Harmonic Trumpet replaced an earlier Trumpet on the Great Organ, with tonal changes (new pipework supplied) made by Casavant via Ledoux &amp; MacDonald Organ Service Co., Halifax. [[Pipe organ#Wind system|Wind]] is supplied by a 3 [[Horsepower|hp]] electric [[Centrifugal fan|blower]] located in the basement directly below the organ.

The 18-ton organ underwent $15,000 in repairs to its bellows in 2008, with the sheep skin seams being replaced by rubberized bellows cloth. The repairs were undertaken by Maritime Pipe Organ Builders Ltd. of [[Moncton]], [[New Brunswick]].&lt;ref name = "Famed church organ getting a five-figure overhaul"&gt;{{cite news

In February 2017 [[Pipe organ tuning|Organ Tuner]] Jean-François Mailhot of Sydney Mines spent a week refurbishing Opus 1841, revoicing the reed stops (cleaning the reed tongues and shallots) of the swell organ: the 8' Trompette, the 8' Oboe, and the 4' Clarion, as well as the 16' Trombone of the Pedal Organ.  At this time he also repaired a damaged facade pipe, part of the 8' Open Diapason stop of the Great Organ.

While still serving as a church, St. Andrew's was considered to be perhaps the finest concert venue in the city of Sydney. Before its rebirth as an arts centre, the building had a distinguished background as a performance space. St. Andrew's Choir presented many [[cantata]]s over the years and massed [[choir]]s from eight of Sydney's churches assembled in St. Andrew's to sing as individual choirs and as a group the new and old Christmas carols.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid 1950s St. Andrew's was a regular stop for one of the incarnations of the [[Symphony Nova Scotia|Halifax Symphony Orchestra]] whose performances at St. Andrew's were broadcast regionally and even nationally by [[CBC Radio]]. Thomas Mayer was the conductor.  He would often invite local performers to join them, at the time there were several [[Soprano|operatic sopranos]] and [[mezzo-soprano]]s from Cape Breton who gained a national following because of these broadcasts.  More recently, due to its seating capacity of over 1,000, and excellent acoustics it was sought after by organizations such as [[Celtic Colours]], [[The Barra MacNeils]],&lt;ref name = "Cathedral marks a new journey for Barra MacNeils"&gt;{{cite web

The '''coat of arms of Birmingham''' - the [[coat of arms|heraldic emblem]] of the English city of [[Birmingham]] - was first used in 1838 and has changed several times since, as the former [[town]] grew and developed into a [[city]].

==History==
===Incorporation===
[[File:Common seal of the Mayor, Aldermen + Burgesses of the Borough of Birmingham.jpg|thumb|left|The device adopted in 1839]] Following the incorporation of Birmingham as a [[borough]] in 1838, the corporation approved the design of a seal comprising "The Birmingham Arms, encircled with a wreath", with the motto "Forward". The arms were those used from about 1413 to 1536 by the [[de Birmingham family|de Bermingham family]], holders of the manor.

The quartered shield featured in the first and fourth quarters five gold lozenges or diamond shapes conjoined in a diagonal "bend". These were the original arms of the de Berminghams until about 1343. The second and third quarters were divided vertically with an "indented" line. This should have been coloured in black and white, but in the version adopted by the corporation it was coloured gold and red. These were in fact the arms of another branch of the family, who became the Barons of [[Athenry]] and Earls of [[County Louth|Louth]] in [[Ireland]]. In 1867 a new seal was made, and at the time the discrepancy in the colouring of the second and third quarters was noticed. However, it was decided to retain the colouring.

===City Status===
In 1889 Birmingham was granted city status, and to celebrate this fact, the corporation applied to the [[College of Arms]] for a grant of supporters to the arms. It was then realised that the arms used by Birmingham had never been officially granted, so a full grant of arms, crest and supporters was obtained in April of that year.

The shield was altered, with the addition of an ermine fess or horizontal band across the centre. This comes from the arms of the [[Gough-Calthorpe family|Calthorpe family]], Lords of the Manor of [[Edgbaston]], an area included in the borough at its incorporation. A mural crown - resembling a city wall - was placed on the fess to represent local government. The crest consisted of a man's arm holding a hammer, symbolising industry. The supporters were two human figures: a male figure (dressed as a blacksmith) representing industry and a female figure (holding a book and painter's palette) representing art.

===Modernisation===
By 1930 the city corporation felt that the design looked too old fashioned and adopted a new depiction designed by the [[Birmingham School of Art]].

As there were doubts about the heraldic correctness of the new design, a new painting was obtained from the [[College of Arms]] in 1936 incorporating the changes, but still conforming to the 1889 blazon or technical description. The main changes were the addition of a helm and mantling between the shield and crest, a redrawing of the male figure and the replacement of the platform on which the supporters stood with a grassy [[Compartment (heraldry)|compartment]].

These arms continued in use until the abolition of the corporation.

[[File:Harborne Fire Station Coat of Arms.JPG|100px|thumb|right|The coat of arms incorporated into a [[Keystone (architecture)|keystone]] over an entrance to the former City of Birmingham fire station at [[Harborne]].]]
==Current==
A new City of Birmingham was created, including the old city and the former borough of [[Sutton Coldfield]] in 1974. New arms were granted to [[Government of Birmingham, England|Birmingham City Council]] in 1977, closely based on the old arms. Instead of the ermine fess a cross was introduced, charged with a bishop's mitre. These come from the Sutton Coldfield corporation arms and commemorate [[John Vesey|Bishop Vesey of Exeter]], a native of Sutton, who was largely responsible for the growth of the town in the 16th century. A [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] rose was added to the 1889 crest. This was the device of Sutton Coldfield from at least 1619 until 1935. As the College of Arms does not allow two bodies or persons to have identical supporters, they were swapped to opposite sides of the shield. The male figure now holds a [[Cupellation|cupel]], a tool used in the manufacture of jewellery, an important industry in modern Birmingham.

== Use ==

As well as its use on seals and letters, the coat of arms is used in a number of ways, for example as an architectural detail, or to decorate items including buses (in the days when municipal transport was the responsibility of the council), [[street furniture]], refuse collection vehicles, and even the crockery and cutlery used in the [[Birmingham Council House|Council House]].&lt;!-- pictures to follow --&gt;

A [[banner of arms|banner of the arms]] is used as the flag of the city council.

'''''Cubist Landscape''''', also referred to as '''''Tree and River''''' and '''''Paysage cubiste''''' or '''''Arbre et fleuve''''', is a [[Cubist]] painting created in 1914 by the French artist, theorist and writer [[Albert Gleizes]]. ''Tree and River'' is one of Gleizes' last pre-World War I landscapes. A comparison with earlier works such as ''[[Le Chemin, Paysage à Meudon]]'' (1911), ''[[Les Baigneuses (Gleizes)]]'' (1912), ''[[Harvest Threshing]]'' (1912) and ''[[Passy, Bridges of Paris]]'' (1912) demonstrates the artists' continuity with the theme of deep spatial vistas and wide panoramic views, though with a notable diminution of specific references to reality.&lt;ref name="Robbins, Guggenheim"&gt;Robbins, Daniel, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, [https://archive.org/details/albertgleizes1881robb ''Albert Gleizes, 1881-1953, A Retrospective Exhibition''], 1964&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was reproduced in the German art and literary magazine ''[[Der Sturm]]'' (titled ''Baum und Fluss'') October 1920.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bluemountain.princeton.edu/bluemtn/cgi-bin/bluemtn?a=d&amp;d=bmtnabg19201005-01.2.4.1&amp;srpos=6&amp;e=-------en-20--1--txt-IN-gleizes----# Albert Gleizes, Baum und Fluss, Gemälde, Vierfarbendruck, Der Sturm, 5 October 1920], Princeton University Blue Mountain Project&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
''Cubist Landscape'' is an oil painting on canvas in horizontal format with dimensions {{convert|97|x|130|cm|in|abbr=on}}, signed and dated ''Alb Gleizes, 14'', lower right. Executed in a Cubist style, the work is notable in its fusing of foreground and background, the multiple perspective—also called [[simultaneity]] or multiplicity,&lt;ref name="MoMA, Meanings and interpretations"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;section_id=T020544#skipToContent Christopher Green, 2009, ''Cubism, Meanings and interpretations'', MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702090838/http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;section_id=T020544|date=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; successive views at various moments in time of the elements—the freely flowing brushstrokes, and the dark lines and arcs delineating juxtaposing color planes or surfaces.

Art historian [[Daniel Robbins (art historian)|Daniel Robbins]], in his Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum Gleizes Retrospective Exhibition catalogue writes of Gleizes' work during the period:
&lt;blockquote&gt;His work was always directly engaged with environment, especially an unfamiliar one... In the works from 1914 through the end of the New York period, paintings without subject and paintings with an evident visual basis exist side by side, their difference in degree of abstraction hidden by the uniformity with which they were painted and by the constant effort to tie the plastic realization of the painting to a specific, even unique, experience. In the absence of his individual reflexes, these unique references—no matter how neutral—seem less and less in accord with the generalized nature of his austere, flat painting style.&lt;ref name="Robbins, Guggenheim" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robbins"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/albertgleizes1881robb Daniel Robbins, 1964, ''Albert Gleizes 1881 – 1953, A Retrospective Exhibition'', Published by The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York, in collaboration with Musée National d'Art Moderne, Paris, Museum am Ostwall, Dortmund]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Albert Gleizes, 1914-15, Portrait of an Army Doctor (Portrait d'un médecin militaire), oil on canvas, 119.8 x 95.1 cm, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum.jpg|thumb|Albert Gleizes, 1914-15, ''[[Portrait of an Army Doctor|Portrait of an Army Doctor (Portrait d'un médecin militaire)]]'', oil on canvas, 119.8 x 95.1 cm, [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]]]]
With regard to structural composition, ''Cubist Landscape'' and other works closely related, are of critical importance, as their rhythms anticipate Gleizes' vital principles of [[Albert Gleizes#Painting and its Laws|translation and rotation]] (tilting planes and circular movements).&lt;ref name="Robbins" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org/form-and-history/poznanski/painting-and-its-laws.html Albert Gleizes, ''Painting and Its Laws'', summary by Peter Brooke]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alibert"&gt;Pierre Alibert, ''Gleizes, Naissance et avenire du cubisme'', Aubin-Visconti, Edition Dumas, Saint-Etienne, October 1982, {{ISBN|2-85529-000-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="La Peinture et ses lois"&gt;Albert Gleizes, ''La Peinture et ses lois, Ce qui devait sortir du cubisme'', La Vie des lettres et des arts, 1922-3, 1924 in book form&lt;/ref&gt;

Rhythm and space, for Gleizes, are two vital conditions. Rhythm is a consequence of the continuity of certain phenomena, variable or invariable, following from mathematical relations. Space is a conception of the human psyche that follows from quantitative comparisons. This mechanism, according to Gleizes, is the foundation for artistic expression. It is therefor both a philosophical and scientific synthesis. Cubism was a means to arrive not only at a new mode of expression but above all a new way of thinking. This was, according to art historian {{Interlanguage link multi|Pierre Alibert (art historian)|fr|Pierre Alibert|lt=Pierre Alibert}}, the foundation of both a new species of painting and an alternative relationship with the world; hence another principle of civilization.&lt;ref name="Alibert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="La Peinture et ses lois" /&gt;

'''Daphni''' or '''Dafni''' ([[Modern Greek]]: Δαφνί; [[Katharevousa]]: Δαφνίον, ''Daphnion'') is an eleventh-century [[Byzantine]] monastery {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=off|sp=us|spell=in}} northwest of central [[Athens]] in the suburb of [[Chaidari]], south of Athinon Avenue ([[Greece Interstate 8A|GR-8A]]). It is situated near the forest of the same name, on the [[Sacred Way]] that led to [[Eleusis]]. The forest covers about {{cvt|18|km2|mi2|0}}, and surrounds a laurel grove. "Daphni" is the modern Greek name that means "laurel grove", derived from Daphneion (Lauretum).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Daphne Monastery: History, Architecture, Mosaics|last=Kyriacopoulou|first=Helen|publisher=Society for Peloponnesian Studies, 1956|year=1956|isbn=|location=Athens|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Daphni Monastery was founded towards the end of the sixth century A.D. on the site of the Sanctuary of [[Apollo]] which had been desecrated by the [[Goths]] in 395.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The Sanctuary of Apollo was built in the [[Ionic style]] using the thinnest and smallest columns. The columns stand on a base with an ornamental scroll at the top. A few of the columns of the temple have been preserved. One of the four Ionic columns of the ancient Sanctuary of Apollo remains at the site, as it was re-used in the Daphni Monastery. The other columns were removed and taken to London by [[Thomas Bruce, Earl of Elgin]] (of [[Elgin Marbles]] fame). The columns, column bass, and column tops from the Sanctuary of Apollo are currently in the possession of the [[British Museum]]; they are currently not on display but can be seen on the museum’s [http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=3682783&amp;partId=1&amp;searchText=Dhafni+monastery&amp;images=true&amp;museumno=1816.0610.232&amp;page=1 website] .

The first monastery on the site was constructed in the style of a castle with a [[basilica]] in the middle. It was fortified with enclosing walls and small [[monastic cell|cells]] that were usually just inside the walls and used by monks or nuns. The walls were attached to the church rather than standing free around the perimeter of the property and one of the columns from Apollo was built into the southern wall of the church.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Some of the rectangular blocks of porous stone were also salvaged and used in the western outer wall of the church. This first monastery fell into decline when Greece was severely damaged following invasions of barbarians from the North and the sea in the ninth and tenth Centuries A.D.

During a period of renewed prosperity In the eleventh and twelfth centuries, the Daphni Monastery was restored. A new octagonal church, a [[refectory]] and a chapel for the cemetery were built.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Architecture of Greece|last=Darling|first=Janina|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2004|isbn=|location=Westport, CT|pages=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; The old basilica was completely demolished except for the enclosing walls and cells from the former church which were incorporated into the new church. Traces of old frescoes found on the walls show a person with bands, perhaps Emperor [[Basil II]], holding a scroll. The craftsmanship used in the church construction suggests Basil II brought in workers from [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Daphni Monastery fell into decline after it was sacked by [[Frankokratia|Frankish]] [[Fourth Crusade|crusaders]] in 1205. The region became part of the [[Duchy of Athens]] under [[Othon de la Roche]]. Othon gave the Daphni Monastery to the [[Cistercian]] [[Abbey of Bellevaux]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Byzantine Mosaics in Greece|last=Diez|first=Ernest|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1931|isbn=|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=409}}&lt;/ref&gt; who added their own cloister and twin pointed arches [[Gothic architecture|in the Gothic style]] to the façade of the church. The Daphni Monastery became a popular burial place for Knights. In 1458, immediately after the coming of the Turks and the visit of Sultan [[Mehmed II]] to Athens, the Cistercians abandoned the Daphni Monastery and the Duchy of Athens was abolished.

The Daphni Monastery, along with the famous monasteries of [[Hosios Loukas]] near [[Delphi]] and [[Nea Moni]] on the island of [[Chios]], are designated [[UNESCO World Heritage Sites]] for their significant historical and architectural value. These monasteries are famed as masterpieces of middle Byzantine architecture, and are especially noted for their sumptuous interior gold mosaics.

== Architecture ==
The exterior of the church has a [[cloisonné]] style, which is very common for middle Byzantine churches in Greece.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The cloisonné style of masonry consists of rectangular blocks of stone separated or framed on all four sides by bricks. The windows are set off from the cloisonné work by arched frames made of brick. The contrast between the light color of the stone blocks of the cloisonné and the red bricks around the windows, and the orange roof create a sophisticated and understated elegance.

The floor plan for the Church of Daphni is a simple Greek cross-octagon arranged with various levels of light and illumination. The upper church, particularly the dome symbolizes the Heavens while the lower area symbolizes the earth. A square bay in the center of the church is covered by a broad dome. Squinches, small half-domes that span the corner of a square are connected by tall L-shaped piers to form the transition from the square to the circle of the dome. The four squinches in the square bay transform it into an octagon. The wall surfaces fan out at the top above the squinches and join together to form the circular base of the dome. 
[[File:Ground.Plan of the Monastery-Church at Daphni. John M. Neale. A history of the Holy Eastern Church. P.183.jpg|thumb|Ground Plan of the Monastery-Church at Daphni
]]
A [[Greek cross]] is formed by four [[barrel vault|barrel-vaulted]] arms of the same length that project from the center bay. Small bays covered with groin vaults (ceilings made up of two barrel vaults) that intersect at right angles give the building its rectangular shape. The bays that fill in the cross are only one-story high and with a low-level of illumination to subordinate them from the Greek cross.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Mosaics ==
The interior of The Daphni Monastery has an elegant interplay of spaces and light with the windows at the base of the dome illuminating the vertical space above; as the space becomes taller, it also become brighter. This graduated light enhances the radiant gold-ground [[tesserae]] used to create the remarkable quality of the mosaics.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The unknown artist was from the early [[Komnenian period]] ({{circa|1100}}). The wide assortment of colored shades of glass tesserae further enhances the mosaics. Several important studies have been conducted on the composition of the glass used in the tesserae for these mosaics as the unusually bright color of the gold-ground tesserae and the deep brilliance of the colors combine with important stylistic qualities to make these mosaics unique &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=James|first=Liz|year=2006|title=Byzantine Glass Mosaic Tesserae: Some Material Considerations|url=|journal=Byzantine and Modern Greek Studies 30|volume=1|pages=29–47|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the factors that identifies mosaics from different areas is the variance in glass used. The glass can be crafted locally or imported from other areas; in the case of Daphni, it is believed the glass was created on site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=New Light on Old Glass: Recent Research on Byzantine Mosaics and Glass|last=Entwistle|first=Christopher|publisher=British Museum|year=2013|isbn=|location=Loneon|pages=242}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This group of mosaics is considered one of the most important and best-preserved mosaic cycles from this period. They are evidence of the iconographic and stylistic conceptions formulated at the end of the [[Byzantine Iconoclasm|iconoclastic crisis]] (AD 843) by the [[Church of Constantinople]]. The decoration shows a rigid consistency in the distribution of subject characteristic of Constantinopolitan art.

In Byzantine theology, the church building was a symbol of the Christian universe, intended to reflect the splendor of heaven. A standardized program in Byzantine churches established the order in which the representations were arranged. The most sacred characters were depicted in the dome and the apse, while below, the dome scenes were arranged from higher to lower levels relating to their level of religious importance.

Visitors to the church are immediately drawn to the most important and famous of the mosaics: [[Christ Pantocrator]] (Lord of the Universe) watching over all from the crown of the dome. He is depicted with a stern face and a threatening gaze with only his head and shoulders shown. This medallion is recognized as representing high artistic quality and as “one of the greatest creations in art”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Christ is wearing a purple robe and a blue mantle, he is the [[King of Kings]] and shows strength, austerity and power. The artist created a bold and realistic drawing, executed with very simple means. The eyebrows are shown with a strong arch to accentuate the vertical lines and the long nose that intersects with the horizontal lines of the halo to create a symbolic cross. Several studies have been conducted in an attempt to determine whether significant changes have been made during restorations to the appearance of the Christ Pantocrator mosaic, but there is general agreement that changes have not been significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cormack|first=Robin|year=2008|title=Rediscovering the Christ Pantocrator at Daphni|jstor=20462776|journal=Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes|volume=71|pages=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christ is surrounded by sixteen Prophets at the base of the dome, between the windows that illuminate Christ as the dominant figure in the church. The prophets are wearing ancient garments and hold a parchment containing text proclaiming the glory of Christ or the [[Second Coming]].

[[File:Final_pictures_Christ_in_the_Apse.jpg|thumb|Christ Pantocrator]]
On the [[pendentives]] there are four scenes from the life of Christ. The [[Crucifixion]] scene shows three figures: Christ on the cross, with Mary and Saint John are at the foot of the cross, one on each side. The figures are arranged in the shape of a triangle against the empty golden background. Each figure is separate and unified with the other figures. This balanced arrangement is similar to the way Greek sculptors placed their figures in the pediments of temples. The figure of St. John is depicted in a bending position, with his weight on one leg – a pose used by Greek sculptors. The body of Christ is depicted in a classic, athletic style, but unlike Greek sculpture, the anatomy is not true to life. The faces of Saint John and the Madonna have the flatness and heavy lines of the Byzantine style, but they express the calm of Greek statues.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', "the ensemble represents a visualization of the Christian [[cosmos]], its effect created by an intricately conceived interplay of pictures and architecture. Space in fact fuses the decoration into one giant image, in which the ruler, hailed by the prophets surrounding him, presides in his sphere above the host of saints that people the lower part of the room."

Other important mosaics include: Prayers of Joachim and Anna, Annunciation of Joachim, The Virgin with Anna, Annunciation of the Mother of God, The Baptism of Christ, The Washing of the Disciples, Entering Jerusalem, Christ at the Last Supper, The Crucifixion, The Resurrection, Dormition of the Mother of God, Angel to Receive the Mother of God, Prophet Sophonia, St. Bacchus.

Byzantine art often survives as an ecclesiastical art. The Daphni Monastery was built during a period of [[Macedonian Renaissance|renaissance in culture and art]] and a return to classical traditions. The figures in the mosaics are more naturalistically represented, and they blend more smoothly into their surroundings&lt;ref name="Setton409"&gt;''The Latins in Greece and the Aegean from the Fourth Crusade to the End of the Middle Ages'', K. M. Setton, ''The Cambridge Medieval History:Vol IV, The Byzantine Empire'', ed. J.M. Hussey, D.M. Nicol and G. Cowan, (Cambridge University Press, 1966), 409.&lt;/ref&gt; The decoration of the monastery is inspired by the spirit of the times.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Faces are dematerialized, austere and depicted with unemotional expressions. The bodies are heavy and rigid, common characteristics in depicting the icons of the Bishops, Monks and the Martyrs. The pictorial perspective, the figure styles and gestures, the modeling of the figures along with simplicity of design, and the dazzling splendor of color reflecting from the gold and silver tesserae distinguish the Daphni mosaics among the mosaics of the eleventh and twelfth centuries as particularly grand specimens of Byzantine art in general.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Denver’s Art District on Santa Fe''' (ADSF) is a nationally known arts and cultural district, encompassing hundreds of artists, galleries, studios, theaters, and creative businesses along Santa Fe Drive in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]]. ADSF is a 501(c)(3), nonprofit membership organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.guidestar.org/profile/56-2403574|title=Denver's Art District on Santa Fe - GuideStar Profile|website=www.guidestar.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Denver's Art District on Santa Fe.JPG|275px|thumb|right|The Arts District, looking north along Santa Fe Drive from 8th Avenue.]]
The organization formed in 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sos.state.co.us/biz/BusinessEntityDetail.do?quitButtonDestination=BusinessEntityResults&amp;nameTyp=ENT&amp;entityId2=20031303408&amp;srchTyp=ENTITY&amp;fileId=20131736400&amp;masterFileId=20031303408|title=Colorado Secretary of State - Summary|website=www.sos.state.co.us}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became one of the first Certified Creative Districts in the state of Colorado in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bizjournals.com/denver/news/2012/03/09/santa-fe-drive-salida-named-colorado.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Denver's Art District on Santa Fe spans from 13th Street on the North to Alameda Avenue on the South, and Kalamath Street on the West to Inca Street on the East. It is primarily located in the La Alma-[[Lincoln Park, Denver|Lincoln Park]] neighborhood in Denver, but it also overlaps the [[Baker, Denver|Baker]] neighborhood. The stretch of Santa Fe was once a [[American bison|buffalo]] migration route, and the first settlers arrived in the mid-1800s. The area was home to waves of immigrants, initially from Europe and Russia, followed by Mexicans fleeing the [[Revolution of 1910]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lincolnparkneighborhood.org/history/|title=La Alma-Lincoln Park Neighborhood Association  » History|website=www.lincolnparkneighborhood.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12433">'''Ethnofiction''' is a [[neologism]] which refers to an [[ethnographic]] [[docufiction]], a blend of [[documentary]] and [[fictional film]] in the area of [[visual anthropology]]. It is a film type in which, by means of [[fictional]]  [[narrative]] or creative [[imagination]], often improvising, the portrayed characters ([[Indigenous peoples|natives]]) play their own roles as members of an [[ethnic]] or social group.

[[Jean Rouch]] is considered to be the father of ethnofiction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maitres-fous.net/glossary.html Glossary] at MAITRES_FOUS.NET&lt;/ref&gt; An [[ethnologist]], he discovered that a filmmaker interferes with the event he registers.

An ethnographer cameraperson, in this view, will be accepted as a natural partner by the actors who play their roles. The cameraperson will be one of them, and may even be possessed by the [[rhythm]] of dancers during a ritual celebration and induced in a state of ''cine-[[trance]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cinetrance.com/cine-trance.htm Cine-trance]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://der.org/jean-rouch/pdf/American_Anthropologist_Tribute.pdf Cine-trance: a Tribute to Jean Rouch](Visual Anthropology, American Anthropologist)&lt;/ref&gt; Going further than his predecessors, [[Jean Rouch]] introduces the [[actor]] as a tool in research.

A new genre was born.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Rouch and the Genesis of Ethnofiction – thesis by Brian Quist (Long Island University)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Flaherty]], a main reference for Rouch, may be seen as the grandfather of this [[genre]], although he was a pure documentary maker and not an ethnographer.

Being mainly used to refer to [[ethnographic]] films as an object of visual anthropology, the term ethnofiction is as well adequate to refer to experimental documentaries preceding and following Rouch's oeuvre and to any [[fictional]] creation in human communication, arts or literature, having an ethnographical or social background.

==History==
Parallel to those of Flaherty or Rouch, ethnic portraits of hard local realities are often drawn in Portuguese films since the thirties, with particular incidence from the sixties to the eighties,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comite-film-ethno.net/colloque-2006/pdf/constructions-identitaires/alves-costa.pdf Imagining Rurality: Portuguese Documentary and Ethnographic Film in the 1960s and 1990s] – Abstract for a conference by Catarina Alves Costa at [http://www.comite-film-ethno.net/ Comité du Film Ethnographique]&lt;/ref&gt;  and again in the early 21st century. The remote Trás-os-Montes region (see: [[Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro Province]] in [[Portugal]]), [[Guinée Bissau]] or the [[Cape Vert]] islands (ancient Portuguese colonies), which step in the limelights from the eighties on thanks to the work of certain directors ([[Flora Gomes]], [[Pedro Costa]], or [[Daniel E. Thorbecke]], the unknown author of [[Terra Longe]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://woyingi.wordpress.com/2011/04/02/african-filmmaker-profiles-flora-gomes/ African  Filmmaker Profiles: Flora Gomes] at [http://woyingi.wordpress.com/ The Woyingi Blog]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://reehanmiah.wordpress.com/2010/12/27/pedrocosta/ The Films of Pedro Costa] at [http://reehanmiah.wordpress.com/ Distant Voices]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spla.pro/fiche.php?no=1094&amp;type=films Terra Longe] at [http://www.spla.pro/ South Planet] (French)&lt;/ref&gt;) are themes for pioneering films of this genre, important landmarks in film history.
Arousing fiction in the heart of [[ethnicity]] is something current in the Portuguese popular narrative ([[oral literature]]): in other words, the traditional attraction for [[legend]] and [[surrealistic]] imagery in popular arts&lt;ref&gt;[http://d1113048.dotsterhost.com/The_Portuguese_and_the_others.pdf The Portuguese and the “others”: dialogue of cultures and characters in oral literary tradition] - Article by Maria Edite Orange and Maria Inês Pinho at Departamento de Artes e Motricidade Humana do IPP – Escola Superior de Educação (Porto)&lt;/ref&gt; inspires certain Portuguese films to strip off realistic predicates and become poetical fiction. This practice is common to many fictional films by [[Manoel de Oliveira]] and [[João César Monteiro]] and to several [[docufiction]] hybrids by [[António Campos]], [[António Reis]] and [[Ricardo Costa (filmmaker)|Ricardo Costa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scielo.oces.mctes.pt/pdf/etn/v14n3/v14n3a05.pdf  Things we see: Portuguese anthropology on material culture] – Paper by Filomena Silvano at [http://www.scielo.oces.mctes.pt/ Scielo]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.movingimagesource.us/articles/disquieting-objects-20110503 Disquieting Objects]  - Article by Gabe Klinger at [http://www.movingimagesource.us/ The Museum of Moving Image]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://d1113048.dotsterhost.com/RCen.pdf Ricardo Costa and the Flowing Pictures] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710145733/http://d1113048.dotsterhost.com/RCen.pdf |date=July 10, 2011 }} – Article by [[José de Matos-Cruz]]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1960s, ethnofiction (local real life and fantasy in one) is a distinctive mark of Portuguese cinema.

'''''Execution of Czolgosz with Panorama of Auburn Prison''''' is a 1901 [[silent film]] produced by the [[Edison Studios]] arms of [[Edison Manufacturing Company]]. The film is a [[Historical reenactment|dramatic reenactment]] of the execution of [[Leon Czolgosz]] by [[electric chair]] at [[Auburn Correctional Facility]] following his 1901 conviction for the [[assassination of William McKinley]]. It is considered an important film in the history of cinema.&lt;ref name="Auerbach"&gt;Auerbach, Jonathan (2007). ''Body Shots: Early Cinema's Incarnations.'' University of California Press, {{ISBN|9780520252936}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production and influence==

Throughout 1901, Edison had produced and released numerous films about the assassination, due to intense public interest. For the final film in the series, producer [[Edwin S. Porter]] sought permission to film the execution itself but was denied. Instead, they filmed outside the prison the day of the execution, then recreated the execution on a set.

The film comprises four shots. Two of them are actual footage of the outside of Auburn Prison on the day of the execution. The other two are recreations of the execution with actors, cut together in an early example of [[continuity editing]].&lt;ref name="Fairservice"&gt;Fairservice, Don (2002). ''Film Editing: History, Theory and Practice: Looking at the Invisible.'' Manchester University Press, {{ISBN|9780719057779}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Doane"&gt;Doane, Mary Ann (2002). ''The Emergence of Cinematic Time: Modernity, Contingency, the Archive.'' [[Harvard University Press]], {{ISBN|9780674007291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Edison Studios catalog of the time, the film is: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;A detailed reproduction of the execution of the assassin of President McKinley faithfully carried out from the description of an eye witness. The picture is in three scenes. First: Panoramic view of Auburn Prison taken the morning of the electrocution. The picture then dissolves into the corridor of murderer's row. The keepers are seen taking Czolgosz from his cell to the death chamber, and shows State Electrician, Wardens and Doctors making final test of the chair. Czolgosz is then brought in by the guard and is quickly strapped into the chair. The current is turned on at a signal from the Warden, and the assassin heaves heavily as though the straps would break. He drops prone after the current is turned off. The doctors examine the body and report to the Warden that he is dead, and he in turn officially announces the death to the witness.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Because [[copyright]] did not cover films until The Townsend Amendment of 1912 updated the [[Copyright Act of 1909]], Edison Manufacturing Company submitted a paper copy to the Paper Print Collection of the [[Library of Congress]], now part of the collection in the Motion Picture, Broadcasting, and Recorded Sound Division.

Film historian Don Fairservice has noted the parallels with the 1901 film ''[[Histoire d'un crime (film)|Histoire d'un crime]]'' by [[Ferdinand Zecca]].&lt;ref name="Fairservice"/&gt;

== Career ==
Under the influence of [[Maurice Blanchot]] and [[Jean-Luc Nancy]] he has published many essays on philosophy, as well as literature. He has written two books with [[Jean-Luc Nancy]]: the first on the subject of nude,&lt;ref&gt;Ginette Michaud, ''Nus sommes [la peau des images], de Federico Ferrari et Jean-Luc Nancy'', Spirale, Montreal, n. 192, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; the second on the iconography of the writer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Catherine Mavrikakis]], ''Iconographie de l’auteur, de Federico Ferrari et Jean-Luc Nancy'', Spirale, Montreal, n. 204, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
More recently, he has been working on the deconstruction of the museum in post-modernity, on the issue of art and/in time and on the ontological status of the image.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.teknemedia.net/magazine_detail.html?mId=8842/ Il re è nudo]" by Antonello Tolve in "Arskey"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.doppiozero.com/materiali/contemporanea/il-mondo-immagine-e-l%E2%80%99insieme-vuoto/ Il mondo-immagine e l'insieme vuoto]" by Fabrizio Migliorati in "doppiozero"&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2011 he theorized the aesthetics of "Arte Essenziale", which manifested itself in the show held at [[Collezione Maramotti]] ([[Reggio Emilia]], Italy) and at [[Frankfurter Kunstverein]] (Germany).&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.fkv.de/files/111031_besucher_a4_arte_rz04.pdf/  Shortguide of the exhibition]" by FKV&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Eugenio Viola]] writes of Ferrari, "In a time when many continue to lament what they see as the inexorable decline of theory’s role in criticism, “Arte essenziale” (Essential Art), curated by philosopher Federico Ferrari, does its part to placate concerns with an exploration of the ties that link artistic practice and philosophical speculation. The show focuses on the Wesen, or essence, of a work of art—a notion that has always been inextricably linked with a search for the new."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://artforum.com/picks/id=28538&amp;view=print/  Arte essenziale]" by Eugenio Viola in "Artforum"&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''folk dance''' is developed by people that reflect the life of the people of a certain country or region. Not all ethnic dances are folk dances. For example, [[ritual dance]]s or dances of ritual origin are not considered to be folk dances. Ritual dances are usually called "Religious dances" because of their purpose.
The terms "ethnic" and "traditional" are used when it is required to emphasize the cultural roots of the dance. In this sense, nearly all folk dances are ethnic ones. If some dances, such as [[polka]], cross ethnic boundaries and even cross the boundary between "folk" and "ballroom dance", ethnic differences are often considerable enough to mention.
==Background==
They share some or all of the following attributes:

*Dances are usually held at folk dance gatherings or social functions by people with little or no professional training, often to traditional music.
*Dances not generally designed for public performance or the stage, though they may later be arranged and set for stage performances.
*Execution dominated by an inherited tradition from various international cultures rather than innovation (though folk traditions change over time).
*New dancers often learn informally by observing others or receiving help from others.
More controversially, some people define folk dancing as dancing for which there is no governing body or dancing for which there are no competitive or professional institutions. The term "folk dance" is sometimes applied to dances of historical importance in European culture and history; typically originating before the 20th century. For other cultures the terms "ethnic dance" or "traditional dance" are sometimes used, although the latter terms may encompass [[ceremonial dance]]s.

There are a number of modern dances, such as hip hop dance, that evolve spontaneously, but the term "folk dance" is generally not applied to them, and the terms "street dance" or "vernacular dance" are used instead. The term "folk dance" is reserved for dances which are to a significant degree bound by tradition and originated in the times when the distinction existed between the dances of "common folk" and the dances of the modern ballroom dances originated from folk ones.

Sword dances include Longsword dances and rapper dancing. Some [[choreographed]] dances such as [[contra dance]], [[Scottish country dance]], and [[modern Western square dance]], are called folk dances, though this is not true in the strictest sense. [[Country dance]] overlaps with contemporary folk dance and ballroom dance. Most country dances and ballroom dances originated from folk dances, with gradual refinement over the years.

People familiar with folk dancing can often determine what country a dance is from even if they have not seen that particular dance before. Some countries' dances have features that are unique to that country, although neighboring countries sometimes have similar features.  For example, the [[Germany|German]] and [[Austria]]n [[Schuhplattler|schuhplattling dance]] consists of slapping the body and shoes in a fixed pattern, a feature that few other countries' dances have.

Folk dances sometimes evolved long before current political boundaries, so that certain dances are shared by several countries.  For example, some Serbian, Bulgarian, and Croatian dances share the same or similar dances, and sometimes even use the same name and music for those dances.

[[International folk dance]] groups exist in cities and college campuses in many countries, in which dancers learn folk dances from many cultures for recreation.

[[Balfolk]] events are [[social dance]] events with live music in Western and Central Europe, originating in the folk revival of the 1970s and becoming more popular since about 2000, where popular European partner dances from the end of the 19th century such as the [[schottische]], [[polka]], [[mazurka]] and [[waltz]] are danced, with additionally other European folk dances, mainly from France, but also from Sweden, Spain and other countries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3453">{{Situationists}}

The '''Golden Fleet''' ({{lang-sv|Gyllene Flottan}}) was a minor left-wing group in [[Sweden]], existing during the end of the 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s. It was ideologically aligned with the [[Situationist International]], an [[avant-garde]] revolutionary movement. The Situationists, whose intellectual foundations were derived primarily from [[libertarian Marxism]] and the avant-garde art movements of the early 20th century (particularly [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Plant|first=Sadie|date=1992|title=The Most Radical Gesture|url= |location=[[New York City]]|publisher=Routledge|page= |isbn=978-0-415-06222-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; initially put its emphasis on concepts like [[unitary urbanism]] and [[psychogeography]]. Gradually the focus moved more towards revolutionary and political theory. Much like the main organ of that particular ideological current, the Situationist International, the Golden Fleet had its heyday around the [[protests of 1968]], gradually disappearing by the first years of the 1970s.

Extremely little is known about the Golden Fleet, yet still it became notorious, this to such an extent that it has been labelled "legendary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Edin|first=Fredrik|date=6 September 2013|title=Den siste situationisten|url=http://arbetaren.se/artiklar/den-sista-situationisten/|newspaper=[[Arbetaren]]|language=Swedish|location=[[Stockholm]]|publisher=[[Central Organisation of the Workers of Sweden]]|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing is known about its establishment, composition, and disestablishment. The name was most likely taken from an art exhibit in [[Denmark]] by the Situationist [[Jeppesen Victor Martin]], which consisted of geopolitical paintings featuring coastlines, strategic arrows and toy battleships sprayed over with metallic paint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Slater|first=Howard|date=2001|title=Divided We Stand - An Outline of Scandinavian Situationism|url= |location=[[London]]|publisher=Infopool|page= |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group was centered in the capital [[Stockholm]], although some members appear to have been from [[Gothenburg]]. It is primarily notable through the fact that its members were those that introduced situationist writings to Sweden by its brief but hectic work with publishing political texts. Among them were ''Instruktion i vapendragning'' in 1970 (a translation of "Instructions for an Insurrection", originally published 1961), as well as longer translations of texts by [[Guy Debord]] and [[Raoul Vaneigem]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hyllienmark|first=Olov|date=10 October 1997|title=Jakten på Gyllene Flottan|newspaper=Känguru|language=Swedish|location= |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group also produced a number of works on its own, prominent among them the poster "Hang the [[Stalinism|Stalinists]] High" ({{lang-sv|Häng stalinisterna högt}}, on the subject of the contemporary left-wing) and the brochure "King [[Gustaf V of Sweden|Gustaf's]] Sardines" ({{lang-sv|Kung Gustafs sardiner}}) which discussed the "meaningful meaninglessness of the Swedish students". Another Situationist group existed in Sweden, the [[Second Situationist International]] of [[Jørgen Nash]], but there appears to have been no connection between the Golden Fleet and the Nashists.

'''''Golf Ball''''' (sometimes '''''Golfball''''') is a 1962 painting by [[Roy Lichtenstein]]. It is considered to fall within the [[art movement]] known as [[Pop art]]. It depicts "a single sphere with patterned, variously directional semi-circular grooves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pop Art|last=Lippard|first=Lucy R.|publisher=[[Praeger Publishers]]|year=1970|edition=third printing|isbn=|page=125|chapter=New York Pop}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is commonly associated with black-and-white [[Piet Mondrian]] works. It is one of the works that was presented at Lichtenstein's first solo exhibition and one that was critical to his early association with pop art. The work is commonly critiqued for its tension involving a three-dimensional representation in two dimensions with much discussion revolving around the choice of a background nearly without any perspective.

==History==
When Lichtenstein had his first solo show at the [[Leo Castelli Gallery]] in February 1962, it sold out before opening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Roy Lichtenstein: Mural With Blue Brushstroke|last=Tomkins|first=Calvin|publisher=[[Harry N. Abrams, Inc.]]|year=1988|isbn=0-8109-2356-4|location=|page=25|pages=|quote=His first show at Castelli's, in February 1962, was sold out before the opening.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Golf Ball'' was one of the works that Lichtenstein exhibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pop Art: A Critical History|last=|first=|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|year=1997|isbn=0-520-21018-2|editor-last=Madoff|editor-first=Steven Henry|location=|page=198|pages=|chapter=Focus: The Major Artists|quote=Yes. The first show was very diverse.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Lichtenstein included ''Golf Ball'' in ''Still Life with Goldfish Bowl'', 1972, and ''Go for Baroque'', 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Waldman|1993|loc=''Still Lifes: 1972–76'', pp. 206–7, 216–7|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting exemplifies the novel [[superimposition]] of abstraction and [[Figurative art|figuration]].&lt;ref name="RLMOA60"&gt;{{cite book|title=Roy Lichtenstein: Meditations 0n Art|author=Mercurio, Gianni|first=|publisher=SKIRA|year=2010|isbn=978-88-572-0460-4|location=|page=60|pages=|quote=Good examples of just how abstraction and figuration were superimposed to propose fresh solutions are Lichtenstein's ''Golf Ball'' (1962) and ''Ball of Twine'' (1963).}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work also represents abstraction as a result of elimination of three-dimensionality, [[chiaroscuro]] and a landscape context.&lt;ref name=RLMOA61&gt;{{cite book|title=Roy Lichtenstein: Meditations 0n Art|author=Mercurio, Gianni|publisher=SKIRA|isbn=978-88-572-0460-4|year=2010|page=61|quote=''Golf Ball'' and ''Ball of Twine'' highlight how the more an image is synthesized by eliminating its three-dimensionality, chiaroscuro and a landscape context, the more it takes on the characteristics of abstraction.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Composition in Black and White, 1917.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''Golf Ball'' is said to reflect the black and white elements of ''Compositions in Black and White'', 1917, [[Piet Mondrian]].]]
The use of black and white is regarded as dramatic, and although it may have been influenced by 1940s and 1950s works of [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Franz Kline]] and [[Robert Motherwell]], it is more likely a commentary on Mondrian's 1917 ''Composition in Black and White''.&lt;ref name=W33/&gt; Alternatively, it may have been a reference to another of Mondrian's Pre-[[World War I]] black and white oval paintings, such as ''Pier and ocean'', 1915.&lt;ref name="RLJH"&gt;{{harvnb|Hendrickson|1993|loc=''The Pictures That Lichtenstein made Famous, or The Pictures that Made Lichtenstein Famous'', pp. 25–26}}  For someone familiar with modern art, the formally related oval paintings of Piet Mondrian from before the First World War (Ill. p. 26) may come to mind.&lt;/ref&gt; This complementary source art was common of Lichtenstein's 1960s work on frequently advertised objects.&lt;ref name="W33"&gt;{{harvnb|Waldman|1993|loc=''Cliches into Icons: Early Pop Pictures'', p. 29-31}} "Lichtenstein's dramatic use of black and white is also a feature of subsequent paintings such as ''Golf Ball'', 1962 ...&lt;/ref&gt; Lichtenstein describes his sources as Mondrian ''Plus and Minus'' paintings.&lt;ref name=RLOF/&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Roy Lichtenstein.jpg|thumb|upright|Lichtenstein in 1967]]
In 1962, Lichtenstein produced several works in which he depicted "...the repetitive regularity of their patterned surfaces..."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hendrickson1993|loc=''The Pictures That Lichtenstein made Famous, or The Pictures that Made Lichtenstein Famous'', p. 46}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Golf Ball'' is a depiction of a [[golf ball]] using a [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]]esque set of black and white arcs to depict the three-dimensionality of the subject. However, the neutral background manipulates the image and diminishes the volumetric characteristics by stripping the viewer of his perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=15|title=Roy Lichtenstein|last=Waldman|first= Diane|publisher=The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation|year=1969|quote=''Golf Ball'', 1962 is composed of a series of black and white arcs that form an abstract pattern reminiscent of Mondrian’s plus and minus system. At the same time, by means of their placement, these black and white lines conform to the shape of a three-dimensional object. But the placement of the golf ball on a neutral ground once again neutralizes the object as a volumetric form. This manipulation of the two and three dimensional is one that the artist obviously relishes for he returns to it repeatedly.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is described as a "pure graphic mark on a gray ground" as well as a "totality of abstract marks."&lt;ref name=RLMOA60/&gt; Lichtenstein described ''Golf Ball'' as "the antithesis of what was thought of as having 'art meaning'" because of its lack of perspective.&lt;ref name="RLOF"&gt;{{cite book|title=Roy Lichtenstein: October Files|author=Lichtenstein, Roy|first=|publisher=[[The MIT Press]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-262-51231-2|editor-last=Bader|editor-first=Graham|location=|page=60|pages=|chapter=A Review of My Work Since 1961—A Slide Presentation|quote=''Golf Ball'' (1962), a painting of a single object, is intended to remind one of a Mondrian ''Plus and Minus'' painting.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Golf Ball'' is an example of the emerging "confident authority" of his single-image paintings with its "Rock of Gibraltar-like thereness".&lt;ref name=RLLA/&gt; The "frontal and centralized presentation"'s directness lacked the sophistication to market the images of household goods for advertising but was considered daring artistically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pop Art: A Continuing History|last=Livingstone|first=Marco|publisher=[[Harry N. Abrams]]|year=1990|isbn=0-8109-3707-7|location=|pages=|quote=The frontal and centralized presentation employed by Lichtenstein in early pairings of domestic objects, such as ''Roto Broil'' and ''Electric Cord'' of 1961 and ''Golf Ball'' (1962), was of such assertive directness that it would have been dismissed in contemporary advertising as too crude and unsophisticated. In the context of painting, however, this projection of an image so as to be instantly apprehended as a whole&amp;nbsp;– as a perceptual pattern or structure that in psychological terms would be labelled a Gestalt&amp;nbsp;– was daring in its austere simplicity, anticipating the Minimalism of the mid 1960s.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The black and white painting on a grey background challenges both the natural perception of [[Realism (arts)|realism]] and the boundaries of abstraction.&lt;ref name="P"&gt;{{cite book|title=Pop|last=Foster|first=Hal|publisher=[[Phaidon Press|Phaidon]]|year=2010|isbn=978-0-7148-5663-6|editor=Francis, Mark|location=|page=26|pages=|quote=A golf ball is a prime object of suburban banality, but here it also recalls the pristine plus-and-minus abstractions Mondrian painted forty-five years before.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The work "gives us both the impression of space and the fact of surface".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pop|last=Foster|first= Hal|editor-last=Francis|editor-first= Mark|isbn=978-0-7148-5663-6|publisher=Phaidon|year=2010|page=27|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Golf Ball'' was one of the bases by which "critics aligned him with other practitioners of Pop Art", although much is made about the painting's references to abstract painting, especially its likeness to Mondrian's works.  Furthermore, the painting leverages tensions regarding three-dimensional representation in two dimensions resulting from spatial ambiguities caused by the lack of cues in the background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Roy Lichtenstein: All About Art|last=Lobel|first=Michael|publisher=Louisiana Museum of Modern Art|year=2003|isbn=87-90029-85-2|editor1-last=Holm|editor1-first=Michael Juul|location=|page=84|pages=|chapter=Pop according To Lichtenstein|quote=...it was through paintings like...''Golf Ball''...that critics aligned him with other practitioners of Pop Art...Many of his paintings of objects veer toward abstraction, whether ''Golf Ball''{{'s}} radiating fields of arcs enclosed within a circular form...In this way these works often make reference to the traditions of abstract painting.|editor2-last=Tøjner|editor2-first=Poul Erik|editor3-last=Caiger-Smith|editor3-first=Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Diane Waldman refers to the subject of ''Golf Ball'' as a freestanding form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Roy Lichtenstein: Reflections|last=Waldman |first=Diane|publisher=Electa|year=1999|isbn=88-435-7287-3|page=25|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of the figures in which Lichtenstein demonstrates his draftsman experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Waldman|1993|loc=''Cliches into Icons: Early Pop Pictures'', p. 28}} "Lichtenstein's experience as a draftsman is reflected in his spare presentation of kitchen stoves, washing machines, bathroom interiors, golf balls, ice cream sodas....&lt;/ref&gt;  This work demonstrated his maturation as an artist with standardized contours that present uniformity and solidified inflections.&lt;ref name="RLLA"&gt;{{cite book|title=Roy Lichtenstein|last=Alloway|first=Lawrence|publisher=[[Abbeville Press]]|year=1983|isbn=0-89659-331-2|location=|pages=18–19|quote=This is particularly evident in the single-image paintings, which take on a Rock of Gibraltar-like thereness, and in the paintings from war comics, which have a clarity and elaboration in advance of the comparatively constrained romance subjects.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a strong example of presenting the tension of volumetric potential balanced against two-dimensional presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Waldman|1993|loc=''Cliches into Icons: Early Pop Pictures'', p. 33}} "Both ''Black Flowers'' and ''Golf Ball'' are successful examples of this dialectic.&lt;/ref&gt;  It also shows how placement against a neutral background diminishes three-dimensionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pop Art: A Critical History|last=|first=|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|year=1997|isbn=0-520-21018-2|editor-last=Steven Henry|editor-first=Madoff|location=|page=208|pages=|chapter=Focus: The Major Artists|quote=At the same time, by means of their placement, the black and white lines conform to the shape of a three-dimensional object. But the placement of the golf ball on a neutral ground once again neutralizes the object as a volumetric form.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Lichtenstein's techniques to display/minimize dimensionality, the viewer imposes his or her own visualization experiences on the painting, which minimizes the effect of spatial illusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Waldman|1993|loc=''Comic Strips and Advertising Images'', p. 47}} "We know that a golf ball is three-dimensional, and so most of us project the additional dimension onto such a two-dimensional image even though it may not be depicted in that manner."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Hannah Wilke was born on March 7, 1940 in [[New York City]] to [[Judaism|Jewish]] parents; her grandparents were Eastern European immigrants. In 1962, she received a Bachelor of Fine Art and a Bachelor of Science in Education from the [[Tyler School of Art]], [[Temple University]], Philadelphia. She taught art in several high schools and joined the faculty of the [[School of Visual Arts]], New York, where she taught sculpture and ceramics from 1974–1991.&lt;ref name="artinamerica-97"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Art in America]] |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_n2_v85/ai_19114074 |date=February 1997 |volume=85 |issue=2 |pages=92–93 |last=Princenthal |first=Nancy |accessdate=2007-07-07 |title=Mirror of Venus — photography, videos and performance art, Hannah Wilke, Ronald Feldman Gallery, New York, New York |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071216021606/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_n2_v85/ai_19114074 |archivedate=2007-12-16 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="biography" /&gt; From 1969 to 1977, Wilke was in a relationship with the American Pop artist, [[Claes Oldenburg]], and they lived, worked and traveled together during that time.&lt;ref&gt;Marsie Scharlatt, "Hannah in California," in ''Hannah Wilke: Selected Work, 1963-1992'', Hannah Wilke Collection &amp; Archive, Los Angeles, and SolwayJones, Los Angeles, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tracy Fitzpatrick, "Making Myself into a Monument," ''Gestures'', Neuberger Museum of Art, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Princenthal, ''Hannah Wilke'', Prestel Publishing, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Wilke's work was exhibited&lt;ref name="biography"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hannahwilke.com/id10.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528031221/http://www.hannahwilke.com/id10.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 28, 2008 |title=Hannah Wilke: Biography, Exhibitions, Awards, HWCALA |accessdate=December 18, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; nationally and internationally throughout her life and continues to be shown posthumously.&lt;ref name="exhibitions"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hannahwilke.com/id25.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110125204052/http://www.hannahwilke.com/id25.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 25, 2011 |title=EXHIBITIONS |accessdate=December 18, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Solo exhibitions of her work were first shown in New York and Los Angeles in 1972. Her first full museum exhibition was held at the [[University of California, Irvine]], in 1976, and her first retrospective at the [[University of Missouri]] in 1989. Posthumous retrospectives were shown in Copenhagen, Helsinki, and Malmo, Sweden in 2000 and at the [[Neuberger Museum of Art]] from 2008 to 2009. Since her death, Wilke's work has been shown in solo gallery shows, group exhibitions, and several surveys of women's art, including WACK! (www.moca.org) and Elles (www.pompidou.fr).

===Early work===

Wilke first gained renown with her "[[vulval]]" [[terra-cotta]] sculptures in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="grrrls"&gt;{{cite book|title=Pin-up Grrrls: Feminism, Sexuality, Popular Culture  |last = Buszek |first= Maria Elena |publisher = [[Duke University Press]] |isbn=0-8223-3746-0 |year=2006 |pages=291–294 |chapter = Our Bodies/Ourselves}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her sculptures, first exhibited in New York in the late 1960s, are often mentioned as some of the first explicit [[vaginal]] imagery arising from the [[women's liberation movement]],&lt;ref name="grrrls" /&gt; and they became her signature form which she made in various media, colors and sizes, including large floor installations, throughout her life.&lt;ref name="biography" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tracy Fitzpatrick, ''Gestures'', Neuberger Museum of Art, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of her mediums included clay, chewing gum, kneaded erasers, laundry lint and latex.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The use of unconventional materials is typical of feminist art, because traditionally women did not have access to art supplies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schapiro|first=Miriam|year=1977–78|title=Waste Not Want Not|url=|journal=Heresies 1|volume=no. 4|pages=153|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sculptures were an innovative example of eroticism using a style that combined [[Postminimalism|post-minimalism]] and feminist aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Middleman|first=Rachel|year=2013|title=Rethinking Vaginal Iconology with Hannah Wilke's Sculpture|url=https://search.proquest.com/artshumanities/docview/1710658672/984B0B3843BF4D87PQ/3?accountid=14171|journal=Art Journal|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A consummate draftswoman, Wilke created numerous drawings, beginning in the early 1960s and throughout her life. In a review of Wilke's drawings at Ronald Feldman Fine Arts in 2010, Thomas Micchelli writes in ''[[The Brooklyn Rail]]'': "at her core, she was a maker of things ... an artist whose sensuality and humor are matched by her formal acumen and tactile rigor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Micchelli|first=Thomas|title=HANNAH WILKE Early Drawings|journal=The Brooklyn Rail|date=October 2010|url=http://brooklynrail.org/2010/10/artseen/hannah-wilke-early-drawings}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She performed live and videotaped performance art, beginning in 1974 with ''Hannah Wilke Super-t-Art'', a live performance at the Kitchen, New York, which she also made into an iconic photographic work. The performance art Wilke did evokes the likes of [[Simone Forti]], [[Trisha Brown]] and [[Yvonne Rainer]]. The sculptural art Wilke created, with its unconventional materials and feminist narratives also relates to the likes of [[Louise Bourgeois]], [[Eva Hesse]], [[Alina Szapocznikow]] and [[Niki de Saint Phalle|Niki de St Phalle]].

===Body art===
In 1974, Wilke began work on her photographic [[body art]] piece ''S.O.S — Starification Object Series'' in which she merged her minimalist sculpture and her own body by creating tiny vulval sculptures out of [[chewing gum]] and sticking them to herself.&lt;ref name="grrrls"/&gt;  She then had herself photographed in various [[pin-up]] poses, providing a juxtaposition of glamour and something resembling [[tribal scarification]].&lt;ref name="grrrls"/&gt; Wilke has related the scarring on her body to an awareness of the [[Holocaust]]. These poses exaggerate and satirize American cultural values of feminine beauty and fashion and also hint at an interest in ceremonial scarification.&lt;ref name="wacks"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wacks|first=Debra|last2=Goldman|first2=Saundra|last3=Fischer|first3=Alfred M.|last4=Cottingham|first4=Laura|date=Summer 1999|title=Naked Truths: Hannah Wilke in Copenhagen|journal=[[Art Journal (CAA)|Art Journal]]|publisher=College Art Association|volume=58|issue=2|pages=104–106|doi=10.2307/777953|jstor=777953}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 50 self-portraits were originally created as a game, "S.O.S.Starificaion Object Series: An Adult Game of Mastication", 1974–75, which Wilke made into an installation that is now in the [[Centre Pompidou]], Paris. She also performed this piece publicly in Paris in 1975, having audience members chew the gum for her before she sculpted them and placed them on papers that she hung on the wall.&lt;ref name="wacks"/&gt; Wilke also used colored chewing gum as a medium for individual sculptures, using multiple pieces of gum to create a complex layering representing the vulva.&lt;ref name="extra"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[X-TRA Contemporary Art Quarterly|X-TRA]] |volume=6 |issue=4 |title=Hannah Wilke |last=Dick |first=Leslie |url=http://x-traonline.org/past_articles.php?articleID=161 |accessdate=2007-07-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721171909/http://x-traonline.org/past_articles.php?articleID=161 |archivedate=2011-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilke coined the term "performalist self-portraits" to credit photographers who assisted her, including her father (''First Performalist Self-Portrait'', 1942–77) and her sister, Marsie (Butter) 
Scharlatt (''Arlene Hannah Butter and Cover of Appearances'', 1954–77). The title of Wilke's photographic and performance work, ''So Help Me Hannah'', 1979, was taken from a vernacular phrase from the 1930s and '40s and has been interpreted as playing off of the [[Jewish mother stereotype]] and referencing Wilke's relationship with her mother.&lt;ref name="artinamerica-97"/&gt;

Besides ''Hannah Wilke Super-t-Art'', 1974, other well-known performances in which Wilke used her body include ''Gestures'', 1974; ''Hello Boys'', 1975; ''Intercourse with ... '' (audio installation) 1974–1976; ''Intercourse with ... '' (video) 1976; and ''Hannah Wilke Through the Large Glass'' performed at the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] in 1977.

===Death and ''Intra-Venus''===

Hannah Wilke died in 1993 from [[lymphoma]].&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; Her last work, ''Intra-Venus'' (1992–1993), is a posthumously published photographic record of her physical transformation and deterioration resulting from [[chemotherapy]] and bone marrow transplant.&lt;ref name="tierny-review"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tierney|first=Hanne|date=January 1996|title=Hannah Wilke: The Intra-Venus Photographs|journal=[[Performing Arts Journal]]|volume=18|issue=1|pages=44–49|jstor=3245813}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The photographs, which were taken by her husband Donald Goddard whom she had lived with since 1982 and married in 1992 shortly before her death, confront the viewer with personal images of Wilke progressing from midlife happiness to bald, damaged, and resigned.&lt;ref name="tierny-review"/&gt; ''Intra-Venus'' mirrors her photo diptych ''Portrait of the Artist with Her Mother, Selma Butter'', 1978–82, which portrayed her mother's struggles with cancer and "having literally incorporated her mother, illness and all."&lt;ref name="jones-189"&gt;{{cite book|title = Body Art/Performing the Subject |last = Jones |first = Amelia |authorlink = Amelia Jones |chapter = The Rhetoric of the Pose: Hannah Wilke |publisher = [[University of Minnesota Press]] |location = [[Minneapolis]] |year=1998 |isbn = 0-8166-2773-8 |page = 189}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Intra-Venus'' was exhibited and published posthumously partially in response to Wilke's feelings that clinical procedures hide patients as if dying was a "personal shame".&lt;ref name="artinamerica-94"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_n5_v82/ai_15406252 |accessdate=2007-07-07 |title=Hannah Wilke at Ronald Feldman — New York, New York — Review of Exhibitions |last=Vine |first=Richard |journal=[[Art in America]] |date=May 1994 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071028104819/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_n5_v82/ai_15406252 |archivedate=2007-10-28 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Intra Venus works also include watercolor Face and Hand drawings, ''Brushstrokes,'' a series of drawings made
from her own hair and the ''Intra Venus Tapes'', a 16-channel videotape installation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theartstory.org/artist-wilke-hannah-artworks.htm|title=Hannah Wilke Biography, Art, and Analysis of Works|work=The Art Story|access-date=2018-03-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pose and narcissism==
In her work, Hannah Wilke often features herself as a posing glamour model. Her use of self in photography and [[performance art]], however, has been interpreted as a celebration and validation of Self, Women, the Feminine, and Feminism.&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Frueh, "Hannah Wilke," in ''Hannah Wilke: A Retrospective'', University of Missouri Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arlene Raven,"The Eternal Hannah Wilke," in ''Hannah Wilke: Selected Works, 1963-1992'', Hannah Wilke Collection &amp; Archive, Los Angeles and SolwayJones, Los Angeles&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, it has also been described as an artistic deconstruction of cultural modes of female vanity, [[narcissism]] and beauty.&lt;ref name="toepfer"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Toepfer|first=Karl|date=September 1996|title=Nudity and Textuality in Postmodern Performance|journal=[[Performing Arts Journal]]|volume=18|issue=3|pages=82–83|jstor=3245676}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jones-152"&gt;Jones (1998), pp.151-152.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilke referred to herself as a feminist artist from the beginning.&lt;ref name="Wooster on Wilke"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wooster|first=Ann-Sargent|title=Hannah Wilke: Whose Image is it anyway|newspaper=High Performance|date=Fall 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[art critic]] Ann-Sargent Wooster said that Wilke's identification with the feminist movement was confusing because of her beauty — her self-portraitures looked more like a Playboy centerfold than the typical feminist nudes.&lt;ref name="Wooster on Wilke"/&gt; According to Wooster,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The problem Wilke faced in being taken seriously is that she was conventionally beautiful and her beauty and self-absorbed narcissism distracted you from her reversal of the voyeurism inherent in women as sex objects. In her photographs of herself as a goddess, a living incarnation of great works of art or as a pin-up, she wrested the means of production of the female image from male hands and put them in her own.&lt;ref name="Wooster on Wilke"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If critics found Wilke's beauty an impediment to understanding her work, this changed in the early 1990s when Wilke began documenting the decay of her body ravaged by lymphoma. Wilke's use of self-portraiture has been explored in detail in writing about her last photographic series, ''Intra Venus''.&lt;ref&gt;Amelia Jones, "Hannah Wilke's Feminist Narcissism," ''Intra Venus'', Ronald Feldman Fine Arts, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilke once answered the critics who commented on her body being too beautiful for her work by saying "People give me this bullshit of, 'What would you have done if you weren't so gorgeous?' What difference does it make? ... Gorgeous people die as do the stereotypical 'ugly.' Everybody dies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.feldmangallery.com/media/pdfs/wilke%20in%20markszine03.pdf|title=Everybody Dies ...

==Critical recognition==
During her lifetime, Wilke was widely exhibited, and although controversial, received critical praise. However, until recently, museums were hesitant to acquire work by women artists who, including Wilke, engaged in protests decrying their lack of inclusion during the feminist movement of the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Princenthal, ''Hannah Wilke'', Prestel, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Wilke's work, with its confrontational use of female sexuality and the fact that it does not fit into a distinct genre or style, was in very few permanent collections when she was alive. Since her death, Wilke's work has been acquired into the permanent collections of [[The Museum of Modern Art]], New York, the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]], New York, [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]], [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles]], and in European museums such as the [[Centre Pompidou]], Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hannah Wilke Art in Selected Public Collections|url=http://www.hannahwilke.com/id12.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10256">The "'''Hawksian woman'''" is, in [[film theory]], a character [[archetype]] of the tough-talking woman, popularized in film by director [[Howard Hawks]] through his use of actresses such as [[Katharine Hepburn]],&lt;ref name=lat/&gt; [[Ann Dvorak]], [[Rosalind Russell]],&lt;ref name=ind/&gt; [[Barbara Stanwyck]],&lt;ref name=ryzik/&gt; and [[Angie Dickinson]].&lt;ref name=lacma/&gt; The best known Hawksian woman is probably [[Lauren Bacall]], who iconically played the type opposite [[Humphrey Bogart]] in ''[[To Have and Have Not (film)|To Have and Have Not]]'' and ''[[The Big Sleep (1946 film)|The Big Sleep]].''&lt;ref name=frontier/&gt;&lt;ref name=grauniad/&gt; The archetype was first identified by film critic [[Naomi Wise (film critic)|Naomi Wise]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=wise/&gt; Major film theorists who have studied Hawksian women are [[Andrew Sarris]] and [[Molly Haskell]].&lt;ref name=schwartz /&gt;

==Characteristics==
The Hawksian woman is up-front in speaking her mind and keeping up with her male counterparts in witty banter as well as taking action to get what she wants personally as well as sexually. She can be seen as the fast-talker, frank, and can beat a man in verbal sparring.&lt;ref name=dames&gt;"Fast-Talkikng Dames by Maria Dibattista." {{jstor|1559084}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite his preference for this kind of woman, Hawks never considered himself a feminist and simply stated that he thought these women were lively and interesting both in films and in life. Hawks' marriage to actress [[Slim Keith]] shows this interest in life and directing in her book ''Slim: Memories of a Rich and Imperfect Life''.&lt;ref name=keith/&gt; It is believed that Lauren Bacall was the perfect woman for Hawks. In Keith's book it states "Howard had been working on this formula woman for years in his films. Rather, it was that, until he met me, the woman of his dreams was only in his head. And until Howard got to Betty Bacall, there hadn’t been an actress to make that dream come alive on screen."&lt;ref name=keith /&gt; Hawks' first film, ''A Girl in Every Port'', exhibited the start of the female lead's formula, in which [[Louise Brooks]] was directed as the very first Hawksian Woman .&lt;ref&gt;Hagopian, Kevin. "Film Notes&amp;nbsp;– A Girl in Every Port." Albany.edu. Accessed September 12, 2013. http://www.albany.edu/writers-inst/webpages4/filmnotes/fnf01n8.html.&lt;/ref&gt; A later example of a Hawksian woman would be Barbara Stanwyck's character in ''[[Ball of Fire]]'', in which she plays Sugarpuss O'Shea, alongside [[Gary Cooper]].&lt;ref name=ryzik /&gt; Hawksian women would work under Hawks' direction with exclusive contracts, using an actress like Lauren Bacall just twice a year to make the public want them more.&lt;ref name=miami&gt;"The Miami News&amp;nbsp;– Google News Archive Search." Accessed September 13, 2013. https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=S_pUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=dz0NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6343,606440&amp;dq=lauren+bacall+howard+hawks&amp;hl=en.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hawksian woman plays across general female role expectations for the setting, defining herself and her choices and leading action. This albeit on masculine terms as denoted by being known, like the male protagonists, by nickname rather than forename. This makes the Hawksian woman especially different from other female archetypes of the time, in that she is considered "one of the gang" rather than an object of sexual desire.&lt;ref name="senses"/&gt; She can hold her own in a wit-driven argument, have the same profession as her male counterpart, and keep her cool under stress.&lt;ref name=keith /&gt; The equality given to the Hawksian woman by the director, however, does not detract from her feminine qualities, such as seductiveness and softness.&lt;ref name=ryzik /&gt; The strength of the Hawksian woman often brings out the more masculine qualities of an otherwise quiet and timid male lead.&lt;ref name=schwartz /&gt; Typically Hawksian women came from either the aristocracy and learned to appreciate their working-man's ideals, or were hard-working professionals themselves who fought for the good of the common man.&lt;ref name=dames /&gt; Hawks discussed his preference for this kind of woman in some detail with [[Joseph McBride (writer)|Joseph McBride]], taking up a full chapter of ''Hawks on Hawks'' (1982).
[[File:Howard Hawks'Rio Bravo trailer (27).jpg|thumb|[[Angie Dickinson]] as "Feathers", opposite [[John Wayne]] ("Chance") in Hawks' ''[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]'' (1959).]]
Hawksian women would be tailored in well-cut, sporty styles, that were attractive yet down to earth.&lt;ref name=keith /&gt; Physically Hawksian women are not all classic beauties, but rather, are carried more by their spunk and charisma than their physical features.&lt;ref name=greer /&gt;

==Decline==
According to some film critics, the Hawksian woman slowly faded from Hollywood in the 1950s, as a new archetype for female leads came to the screen.&lt;ref name=greer&gt;Greer, Germaine. "Siren Song." The Guardian, December 29, 2006. https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/dec/30/film.&lt;/ref&gt; World War II had ended, and the role of women in society had changed.&lt;ref name=greer /&gt; [[Germaine Greer]] describes this archetype as the 'Female Eunuch', powerless women often portrayed by actresses like [[Marilyn Monroe]] and [[Catherine Deneuve]].&lt;ref name=greer /&gt;

==Influence==
[[John Carpenter]], an avowed Hawks fan, includes Hawksian women in most of his movies, from ''[[Assault on Precinct 13 (1976 film)|Assault on Precinct 13]]'' through ''[[Ghosts of Mars]].'' Examples of Hawksian women in Carpenter's films include the characters played by [[Karen Allen]] in ''[[Starman (film)|Starman]]'' and [[Adrienne Barbeau]] in ''[[The Fog]]'' and ''[[Escape from New York]]'' (the latter was also his real-life wife at the time).

In a May 2000 profile of actress [[Cameron Diaz]] in ''The New York Times'', journalist [[Dave Kehr]] remarked that Diaz "would have fit marvelously well into the tradition of the Hawksian woman, with her sense of fun, camaraderie and forthright sexuality."&lt;ref name=cameron/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1517">'''Honolulu Printmakers''' is a non-profit organization of [[Honolulu, Hawaii|Honolulu]]-based [[printmaking]] artists that operates a printing studio open to the community.  It conducts public exhibitions, lectures, demonstration, workshops, and an outreach program in local intermediate and high schools.  The organization holds an annual [[Juried (competition)|juried]] print exhibition.

The Honolulu Printmakers was established in 1928 by [[Charles W. Bartlett]], [[John Melville Kelly]], [[Huc-Mazelet Luquiens]] and [[Alexander Samuel MacLeod]].  It has developed the tradition of the “gift print”, a print commissioned for sale as a fundraiser at the organization’s exhibitions.  The 75th anniversary of the organization was celebrated with a retrospective exhibition at the [[Honolulu Museum of Art]] and an accompanying catalogue, ''A Tradition of Gift Prints''.

The oldest records date to the [[Three Kingdoms]] period (57 BC- 668 AD) when architecture and palace gardens showed a development noted in the Korean ''[[Samguk Sagi|History of the Three Kingdoms]]''.

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}
Korean garden culture can be traced back more than 2,000 years. In recent years, 300 documents have been found, written during the Koryo (918-1392) and Choson (1392-1910) dynasties, that contain detailed records about traditional Korean gardens, many of which survive and can be visited today.

In prehistoric times, Koreans worshipped nature, the sun, stars, water, rocks, stones, and trees. They especially believed that rocks had more power than water and other things in nature. Also, they have believed that rocks engendered God's good-will. Therefore, the arrangement of rocks is considered as one of the "essential" elements in designing the traditional Korean garden. Koreans have recently rediscovered their stone garden tradition in the stacked stone altars that express the ancient concept of a round heaven and square earth. Also ''Susok'' or "rock arrangement," gardens are commonly found. In recent years, in fact, there has been a revival of interest in rock arrangements in gardens. In general, Korean ''Susok'' (rock arrangement) garden culture can be described according to its stages of development. Even during the primitive agricultural period, stones were an essential element in building gardens. Then, rock arrangements for shamanic rituals were built in the shape of shrines or heavenly altars.

During the Three Kingdoms period (57 BC - 668 AD), palace gardens were erected on a grand scale with stones. And in the 4th century temple gardens were introduced along with Buddhism. Since the early [[Koryo dynasty]], when Buddhism was established as the national religion, gardens evolved into the style of ''Hwagye'' (terraced rock garden), which represented Son (Zen) Buddhist rock arrangements. In the middle of the Koryo period, a new style of stone garden, called ''Imchon'', which contained a pavilion and a stone pond in beautiful forest surroundings, became popular. During the [[Joseon dynasty]], the ''Hwagye'' garden style was popular in the yards of many homes, and mansion gardens were usually built in ''Imchon'' style.

==Style of a Korean garden==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}
A [[Korea]]n garden is natural, simple, and unforced. The garden involves both the people within it, and the buildings, in an unforced and at times irregular asymmetry, where the total landscape flows in a natural and progressive way without being forced, or ritualized. Western landscape designs by the likes of [[Capability Brown]] and the American [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] are comparable.

[[Image:Buryeongsa.jpg|right|thumb|[[Buryeongsa]]]]
A Korean garden is generally classified into eight categories: palaces, private residence, country village or Byolso, pavilions, Buddhist temples, [[Seowon]], royal funerary grounds and villages.

==Representative Korean gardens==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}
The most central and representative and relatively undisturbed classical Korean gardens are in three complexes.

*The [[Iseong mountain]] [[fortress]] of [[Baekje]] near [[Seoul]], where one finds numerous rockeries depicting [[turtle]]s, [[dragon]]s or [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenixes]]
*The [[Anak Palace]] Garden of [[Goguryeo]] near [[Pyongyang]], where one finds the remains of three rock Garden complexes.
*The [[Anapji]] Garden of Silla in [[Gyeongju]] is perhaps the best known, with three islands in the pond, man-made waterfalls in two tiers, granite basins of round and square design as well as hundreds of rock arrangement along its curbed shore.

Further important gardens, often historical recreations, are found at these sites:

* The rear garden of Changdeok Palace in Seoul, especially the Buyong pond with the pavilion of cosmic union.
* The Chongpyeong-sa temple near [[Chuncheon]].

==Restoration work==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}
National scholars in the [[Republic of Korea]] are now attempting to build a database through drawings, photographs, and surveys of the landscape of traditional gardens, and attempt recreations.

Rumoured attempts at recreating classical Korean gardens are said to be occurring on small scales in the [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea]], but as yet there is no pictorial evidence.

==Trees, plants and symbolic landscape of a Korean garden==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}
[[Image:Coreangarden.jpg|200|right|thumb|Garden in [[Jejudo]]]]
The vernacular of the Korean garden generally includes evergreen trees (various species of [[Korean pine]]) as a constant, flowering pear trees in the spring; bamboo forests alongside the secondary entrance gates of temples and palaces symbolize fidelity and honesty; and straight walks tend to be bordered by larger sized gravels of irregular shape. These features are especially noticeable in restorations.

Terrain tends to follow natural courses, and unlike the traditional Chinese garden, the use of straight paths is not proscribed, but lessened. Significant or important elements tend to face east. And Korean readings of [[Pungsu]] are regarded with great care, as geomancy was a strong influence in aligning the gardens with stelae, halls and buildings.

==Unusual features==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}
A Korean garden is interesting for attracting various birds. Animals were important to the natural appeal of the garden, so stone animals and animal motifs were common as well as actual fish, birds and other creatures.

A Korean garden will often have a decorative pavilion from which the surrounding garden can be enjoyed. Scholars from the yangban aristocracy sat in their pavilions constructed in either a cultivated garden or a natural area with its own view of the mountains or landscape. These served as places of relaxation and enjoyment and as a place to receive other men to be entertained or to talk about business. Playing chess, painting, resting and other leisurely activities were also pursued in these pavilions because of the exceptional view and surrounding beauty.

A Korean garden may also often have ponds because water is an important element to any garden for practical reasons such as plant watering and cooling the temperature. It was also important in old days because it prevented the wooden buildings of Korea from burning down. In the garden, a murky green color is prized unlike the Western love of blue water. Clear water is generally found in streams and natural water sources rather than ponds which are dug out on purpose in a convenient spot. Sometimes the water looks black if the inside of the pond is walled with stone blocks. Lotuses are usually the most common thing to plant in a pond, but there are many unusual options other than lotuses.

Huwon in Changduk Palace is a huge garden showing the refined style of the imperial family. It contains many trees which are hundreds of years old however and is carefully monitored and preserved from the public. The style of Huwon is very different from the gardens of the yangban classes and is much more refined. However, like all Korean gardens it has a very natural beauty in which the royal family could rest in a private place.

==Korean gardens abroad==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}
A traditional Korean garden is currently under construction in [[Nantes, France|Nantes]], France. "Suncheon Garden", a 5000 square metre site, is enclosed within [[Blottereau Park]], and celebrates the 120th anniversary of diplomatic ties between South Korea and France. There are traditional Korean gardens in the [[Chapultepec Zoo]] in [[Mexico City]]; Gençlik Park in [[Ankara]], [[Turkey]]; in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]]; le [[Jardin d'Acclimatation]] de [[Paris]]; [[Marzahn|Erholungspark Marzahn]] in [[Berlin]]; [[Grüneburgpark]] in [[Frankfurt]]; and at the [[VanDusen Botanical Garden]] in [[Vancouver]], Canada. The Korean Ambassador's Residence Garden in Washington, D.C. is a typical example of a well-maintained Korean garden.

==Korean Garden Society==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}
The Traditional Korean Garden Society in Seoul, ROK, often sponsors lectures and tours of Korean gardens with Professor [[Sim Woo-kyung]] often acting as host and landscape interpreter.

The '''Kossuth Prize''' ({{lang-hu|Kossuth-díj}}) is a state-sponsored award in [[Hungary]], named after the Hungarian politician and revolutionary [[Lajos Kossuth]]. The Prize was established in 1948 (on occasion of the centenary of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|March 15th revolution]], the day on which it is still handed over every year) by the [[Hungarian National Assembly]], to acknowledge outstanding personal and group achievements in the fields of science, culture and the arts, as well as in the building of [[Socialism]] in general.

In 1950s the award was given to Gabor Bela Fodor for his contributions in the field of Chemistry as the prize was given to selected scientists. Since 1963, the domain was restricted to culture and the arts. Today, it is regarded as the most prestigious cultural award in Hungary, and is awarded by the [[President of Hungary|President]].

'''LAB HD''' was a three-year experiment by [[Voom HD Networks]]. It is the only channel in history devoted to video art and experimental film as a continuous flow of ambient television. While it is no longer broadcasting, the channel persists as Voom HD Lab, an outreach effort on the part of its parent company, and it continues to commission pieces from artists and filmmakers.

Voom launched as a DBS (direct broadcast satellite) service in the United States in October 2003. The service offered 21 channels of high-definition video focused on niche audiences.  Most of the channels were conventional offerings, but one slot was reserved for an experimental channel called [[Moov HD|MOOV HD]]. The channel was produced by Concrete Pictures, a design and production house in Philadelphia founded by Jeff Boortz. The intent was to produce video art for public consumption. The branding of the channel was elegant, but the content was of uneven quality, and it was derided as "the [[screensaver]] channel."

Voom assigned [[Ali Hossaini]] to serve as executive producer of the channel. He began revamping the programming with high-profile productions, notably a series of "video portraits" directed by Robert Wilson and produced by Noah Khoshbin.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newsday.com/features/printedition/ny-c5073773feb01,0,1704020.story&lt;/ref&gt; New strands of programming were introduced, such as Tank TV and Micro TV. The former featured public aquariums and the latter photomicroscopy in high-definition. Concrete Pictures produced a program called Space, which stitched together footage from NASA into ambient video.

Efforts to transform the channel culminated on January 1, 2004, when it was relaunched as LAB HD, with the tagline, Experiments in High Definition. Hossaini hired filmmaker Lili Chin to manage a new Outreach Program that would put high-definition gear, including cameras and a post-production facility, into the hands of selected artists. Chin succeeded in attracted a range of talent from the orbit of Anthology Film Archives. LAB HD has deep connections to [[Anthology Film Archives]], where Lili Chin curates film programs and [[Ali Hossaini]] serves on the Board of Advisors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.transmag.org/mailer/mailer26/ Trans News&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2005 LAB HD productions thrived. Director [[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]] produced avant-garde video pieces with [[Brad Pitt]], [[Winona Ryder]], [[Jeanne Moreau]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://broadcastengineering.com/hdtv/hd_still_life_artist_wilson_1227/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315053312/http://broadcastengineering.com/hdtv/hd_still_life_artist_wilson_1227/ |archivedate=2007-03-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hossaini also collaborated with Sandra Antelo-Suarez  of Trans Gallery on her project, ''Don’t Trust Anyone Over 30'', a rock and roll puppet show conceived by Dan Graham. Originally staged with live puppets at Miamia Basel,&lt;ref&gt;http://artdaily.com/news/11724/Don-t-Trust-Anyone-Over-Thirty-by-Dan-Graham#.VwMLxRMrLsk Art Daily News&lt;/ref&gt; a video version of the show was directed by [[Tony Oursler]] for the 2006 Whitney Biennial.&lt;ref&gt;http://whitney.org/www/2006biennial/artists.php?artist=DTAOT Whitney&lt;/ref&gt; The Museum of the Moving Image put LAB HD on permanent exhibit as well.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amcnetworks.com/press-releases/vooms-equator-hd-names-ali-hossaini-executive-producer AMC Networks&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately LAB HD did not meet the criteria to survive as a commercial channel. It had been conceived as an ambient channel, and, in his notes, Hossaini refers to [[Jerry Mander]]'s book ''[[Four Arguments for the Elimination of Television]]'' as a model for the channel. The channel was a continuous flow of non-narrative images and sounds, mostly music. It was meant to provoke reflection not distraction. This presented a weak value proposition from a marketing standpoint, and, on January 1, 2006, it was replaced by another innovative format, a video gaming channel that has garnered considerably more attention (outside the art world).

Voom HD Networks decided to keep the Outreach Program under the name Voom HD Lab, with [[Ali Hossaini]] as executive producer and Lili Chin as associate producer. Voom HD Lab has supported the work of numerous artists and filmmakers, many of whom had never worked in high-definition video. LAB productions appeared in numerous museums, film festivals and galleries.

{{Main|Avant Garde}}
[[File:Pablo picasso 1.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Pablo Picasso]] 1962]]
'''Avant-garde''' ({{IPA-fr|avɑ̃ ɡaʁd}}) is [[French language|French]] for "vanguard".&lt;ref name="dictref"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=avant-garde|title=Avant-garde definitions|accessdate=2007-03-14|publisher=Lexico Publishing Group, LLC|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is commonly used in French, English, and German to refer to people or works that are [[experiment]]al or innovative, particularly with respect to [[art]] and [[culture]].

Avant-garde represents a pushing of the boundaries of what is accepted as the [[Norm (sociology)|norm]] or the [[status quo]], primarily in the cultural realm. The notion of the existence of the avant-garde is considered by some to be a hallmark of [[modernism]], as distinct from [[postmodernism]]. Postmodernism posits that the age of the constant pushing of boundaries is no longer with us and that avant-garde has little to no applicability in the age of [[Postmodern art]].

'''''Loc. cit.''''' ([[Latin language|Latin]], short for '''''loco citato''''', meaning "in the place cited") is a [[footnote]] or [[endnote]] term used to repeat the title and page number for a given work (and author). ''Loc. cit.'' is used in place of [[ibid.]] when the reference is not only to the work immediately preceding, but also refers to the same page. Therefore, ''loc. cit.'' is never followed by volume or page numbers. ''Loc. cit.'' may be contrasted with ''[[op. cit.]]'' (''opere citato'', "in the work cited"), in which reference is made to a work previously cited, but to a different page within that work.

==Sample usage==
* Example 1:

&lt;blockquote&gt;9. R. Millan, "Art of Latin grammar" (Academic, New York, 1997), p. 23.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;10. ''Loc. cit.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the above example, the ''loc. cit.'' in reference #10 refers to reference #9 in its entirety, including page number. Note that ''loc. cit.'' is capitalized in this instance.

* Example 2:

&lt;blockquote&gt;9. R. Millan, "Art of Latin grammar" (Academic, New York, 1997), p. 23.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;10. G. Wiki, "Blah and its uses" (Blah Ltd., Old York, 2000), p. 12.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;11. Millan, ''loc. cit.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the second example, the ''loc. cit.'' in reference #11 refers to reference #9, including page number.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3108">'''Manasology''' (кyrgyz. ''Манастаануу'') is a separate line of research within Kyrgyz studies, which looks into the scientific study of the Kyrgyz [[Manas epic]]. Representatives of this [[scientific]] area are called ''manasologists''.

==Periods of development==
Scientific research of the epic began in the second half of the XIX century by Ch. [[Valikhanov]] and V. [[Radlov]]. Valikhanov had recorded one of the episodes ("Pominki po Kyokyotoyu") in 1856 and partially translated it into Russian. The texts published by Radlov in 1885 in St. Petersburg (in Kyrgyz and German languages) occupy 12,454 lines (including 9449 lines about "Manas")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Karalaev|first1=Sayakbai|title=Manas|date=1984|location=Frunze|url=https://bilim.akipress.org/lib/book:333/manas-po-variantu-sayakbaya-karalaeva-kniga-1-frunze-1984g/?from=bilim&amp;place=type|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Full record of the texts of the "Manas" [[trilogy]] has been carried out since 1920, however, fixing versions by [[manaschi]], let alone their full publication are still far from complete.

Kazakh writer M.O. Auezov wrote the first work after Chokan Valikhanov’s works, a monograph on the Kyrgyz "[[Epic of Manas|Manas]]" epic, by creating of a free version of his texts. Monuments were erected for both Kazakh researchers in the [[Bishkek]] city. Among the [[Russian scientists]] who studied the epic, V. Radlov should be noted (the author of the first Russian translation of fragments of the epic), P. Falev (the author of the first [[Soviet]] study on "Manas" - articles "How the Kara-Kygyz epic is built") and S. [[Malov]].

The All-Union Scientific Conference of 1952 in [[Bishkek|Frunze]] came to the conclusion that the epic "is folk in its basis"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Karalayev|first1=Sayakbai|title=Manas II|date=1984|location=Frunze|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Among the translators of the epic into Russian are S. [[Lipkin]], L. [[Penkovsky]], M. Tarlovskiy and others. The largest Russian translation (prosaic) is in 4 volumes  so far by A.S. Mirbadaleva and N. V. Kydaish-Pokrovskaya for a bilingual edition in the series "Epic of the Peoples of the USSR" (1984-1995), covers about 50 thousand lines (according to S.Orozbakov).

The first one who played the "Manas" epic in [[Russian language]] in the translations of E. [[Polivanov]], L. [[Penkovsky]], M. Tarlevsky and S. [[Lipkin]], is a national artist of Kyrgyzstan Valery Rovinsky.

Abbreviated versions of the epic exist in [[Kazakh language]] (4 volumes in M. Auezov's presentation, including 2 parts about Manas and the part about Semetey and Seytek) and in [[Uzbek language]] (the poet Mirtemir); separate episodes were translated into German, Hungarian, English and other languages.

==Scientific institutions==
The main center of manasology is the National Center for Manasology and Art Culture of the National Academy of Sciences of the [[Kyrgyz Republic]] (director - Akmataliev, Abdyldazhan Amanturovich).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7450">'''Mono-ha''' (もの派) is the name given to a group of 20th-century Japanese artists. The Mono-ha artists explored the encounter between natural and industrial materials, such as stone, steel plates, glass, light bulbs, cotton, sponge, paper, wood, wire, rope, leather, oil, and water, arranging them in mostly unaltered, ephemeral states. The works focus as much on the interdependency of these various elements and the surrounding space as on the materials themselves.

==Origin of the Term “Mono-ha” and its Members==

“Mono-ha” is usually translated in a literal manner, as “School of Things.” The Mono-ha artists regularly assert that “Mono-ha” was a term disparagingly coined by critics (specifically Teruo Fujieda and Toshiaki Minemura  in ''Bijutsu Techo'' magazine in 1973) well after they had begun to exhibit their work, and they did not begin as an organized collective. Many of the Mono-ha artists were first exhibited at Tamura and Maki Galleries in Tokyo owned by Nobuo[[(Shinro) Yamagiishi]] who was also an art writer and whose archives are in the collection of [[The National Art Center Tokyo]].

Toshiaki Minemura explains in his 1986 essay “What Was Mono-ha?,” that in terms of their academic background and intellectual exchange, the Mono-ha artists are divided into three groups:&lt;ref&gt;Minemura, Toshiaki. [https://www.kamakura.gallery/mono-ha/minemura-en.html "What was MONO-HA?"], ''MONO-HA'', Kamakura Gallery, 1986, p.6&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''"The [[Lee Ufan|Lee]] + [[Tama Art University|Tamabi]] Connection.”''' This comprises [[Nobuo Sekine]], [[Kishio Suga]], Shingo Honda, Katsuhiko Narita and Katsurō Yoshida in the painting department, and  [[Susumu Koshimizu]] in the sculpture department at [[Tama Art University]] (aka Tamabi) as well as [[Jiro Takamatsu]] and [[Lee Ufan]], a Korean artist who is a close friend of Sekine. 
# '''“The [[Tokyo University of the Arts|Geidai Connection]],”''' a group of artists around [[Kōji Enokura]] and Noboru Takayama, who were both graduates of the [[Tokyo University of the Arts]] (aka Geidai), and Hiroshi Fujii and Makoto Habu, who were involved in Mono-ha later on. 
# '''“The [[Nihon University|Nichidai]] Connection,”''' students from the [[Nihon University]] (aka Nichidai) Fine Arts Department—whose central figure was Noriyuki Haraguchi—also known as the “Yokosuka Group,” due to Haraguchi’s upbringing in Yokosuka and his critique of the local US military presence through his work.&lt;ref&gt;''Kishio Suga''. Los Angeles: Blum &amp; Poe, 2012, p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socio-Political Context==

Mono-ha emerged in response to a number of social, cultural and political precedents set in the 1960s. With the exception of Lee Ufan, who was a decade older, most of the Mono-ha artists were just beginning their careers when the violent student protests of 1968–69 occurred.

At the same time, there was much protest against the second extension of the US-Japan Security Treaty (known in abbreviated Japanese as ''[[Anpo]]'') in 1970, binding Japan into providing logistical support for the US war in Vietnam. Coupled with demands for the reversion of [[Okinawa]] by 1972 and the removal of nuclear weapons based there, the climate of protest during this period was symptomatic of a growing distrust of the United States’ intentions towards Asia and its dominant position in the bilateral relationship with Japan. The activism of the “''Anpo'' generation” gave rise to a highly intellectual counterculture that was both critical of US “[[imperialism]]” and acutely self-aware of its Japanese identity.&lt;ref&gt;Munroe, Alexandra. ''Japanese Art After 1945: Scream Against the Sky''. Harry N. Abrams Inc, 1994. p.215&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mono-ha artists typically deny involvement with student activist movements at the time, though it is thought that the tense political climate influenced their work, allowing them to grapple with and make sense of their unease and disillusionment with postwar modernity in their different ways.

==Recent Attention in the United States==

In 2012, [[Blum &amp; Poe]] gallery introduced the Mono-ha art into the US with the survey exhibition “Requiem for the Sun: The Art of Mono-ha,” curated by Mika Yoshitake. The gallery has also held solo exhibitions of [[Lee Ufan]], [[Kishio Suga]], [[Susumu Koshimizu]], [[Koji Enokura]], and [[Nobuo Sekine]].

The [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian's]] '''Museum Conservation Institute'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsdesk.si.edu/factsheets/museum-conservation-institute Museum Conservation Institute Fact Sheet]&lt;/ref&gt; (MCI) aims to be the center for specialized [[Conservation-restoration|conservation]] and technical collection [[research]] for all of the Smithsonian museums&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsdesk.si.edu/factsheets/facts-about-smithsonian-institution Smithsonian Institution Fact Sheet]&lt;/ref&gt; and collections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsdesk.si.edu/factsheets/fact-sheet-smithsonian-collections Smithsonian Collections Fact Sheet]&lt;/ref&gt; MCI's staff combine state-of-the-art instrumentation and scientific techniques with the knowledge of materials and the history of technology to provide technical research studies and interpretation of art, as well as historical and anthropological objects, to improve the conservation and collections storage capabilities at the Smithsonian. For the majority of the Smithsonian collections, MCI is the only Smithsonian resource for technical studies and analyses.

==History==

The Smithsonian's Board of Regents&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsdesk.si.edu/factsheets/smithsonian-board-regents Smithsonian Board of Regents Fact Sheet]&lt;/ref&gt; established the Conservation Research Laboratory of the United States National Museum in 1963 in response to a growing need to support conservation of the entire Institution's collections.

In 1965 the name of the laboratory was changed to the Conservation Analytical Laboratory (CAL). In 1983, the laboratory moved to the Museum Support Center&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsdesk.si.edu/factsheets/museum-support-center Museum Support Center Fact Sheet]&lt;/ref&gt; in Suitland, Maryland. Congress mandated a national conservation training program among other wider responsibilities including an expanded conservation science research program.

The Board of Regents approved a name change to the Smithsonian Center for Materials Research and Education (SCMRE) in 1998. SCMRE's mission was to serve all museum communities - national and international, and provide professional training and education programs.

In 2006 the Board of Regents approved the name change to the Museum Conservation Institute (MCI).

'''Naomi Stead''' is an architectural academic, scholar and critic, based in Melbourne, Australia. She is currently the Head of the Architecture Department at [[Monash University Faculty of Art Design &amp; Architecture]], Australia.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Dr Naomi Stead|url = https://www.monash.edu/mada/about-us/people/academic-staff/naomi-stead|website = monash.edu/mada|accessdate = 2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early years and education ==
Naomi Stead was born in February, 1975, and grew up in [[Adelaide]], South Australia. She studied architecture at the Louise Laybourne School of Architecture, [[University of South Australia]], graduating with a Bachelor of Architecture with first class honours in 1998. Stead's PhD, ‘On the Object of the Museum and its Architecture’, was conferred by [[University of Queensland|The University of Queensland]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = On the object of the museum and its architecture|url = http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:106696|website = espace.library.uq.edu.au|date = 2004-01-01|accessdate = 2015-11-14|first = Stead,|last = Naomi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic career ==
Stead began her academic career at the [[University of Technology Sydney|University of Technology, Sydney]] (2001–2009) and became a research fellow at the Research Centre ATCH (Architecture Theory Criticism History), University of Queensland in 2009, later becoming a senior research fellow. In 2015 she took up an academic position as Associate Professor at the School of Architecture, University of Queensland.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Stead has also undertaken a number of research fellowships, including Postdoctoral Fellow, Advanced Cultural Studies Institute of Sweden, [[Linköping University|Linkoping University]] (October 2007 – February 2008), and Honorary Visiting Scholar, School of Architecture, [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven|Catholic University of Leuven]], Belgium (June – December 2005).

Stead describes her academic research as engaged with the following areas: 
* the history, theory and writing of architectural criticism; experimental writing in architecture; 
* representations of architects and architecture in popular media
* the material culture of the architectural workplace; visual sociology in architecture; 
* gender equity in architectural practice; feminist architecture theory; women in architecture;
* urban cultural geography and walking as an aesthetic practice; tourist culture in cities;
* thing theory, artefactuality, and objecthood in architecture; miniaturisation in architecture; 
Stead was a researcher with John Macarthur on the project The Cultural Logic of Queensland Architecture: Place, Taste and Economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Cultural Logic of Queensland Architecture: Place, Taste and Economy - UQ Researchers|url = http://researchers.uq.edu.au/research-project/12477|website = researchers.uq.edu.au|accessdate = 2015-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Equity and Diversity in the Australian Architecture Profession: women, work and leadership ===
Stead initiated and led the [[Australian Research Council]] funded project Equity and Diversity in the Australian Architecture Profession: Women, Work and Leadership (2011–2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Equity and Diversity in the Australian Architecture Profession: Women, Work, and Leadership - Architecture Theory Criticism History - The University of Queensland, Australia|url = http://atch.architecture.uq.edu.au/equity-and-diversity-australian-architecture-profession-women-work-and-leadership|website = atch.architecture.uq.edu.au|accessdate = 2015-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This involved eight researchers –  Stead, [[Karen Burns (academic)|Karen Burns]], [[Justine Clark]], [[Gill Matthewson]], [[Amanda Roan]], [[Gillian Whitehouse]], [[Julie Willis]] and [[Sandra Kaji-O'Grady]] – and sought map women’s participation in the architectural profession in Australia, to understand why women are under-represented at senior management level, and to identify concrete strategies for change. The project resulted in scholarly publications and in the advocacy and activism project [[Parlour: women, equity, architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Parlour - women, equity, architecture.|url = http://archiparlour.org/|website = archiparlour.org|accessdate = 2015-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Gender equality: Reading between the lines|url = http://architectureau.com/articles/gender-equality/|website = ArchitectureAU|accessdate = 2015-11-14|first = Michael|last = Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Equity: not just Parlour talk|url = http://www.theage.com.au/national/education/voice/equity-not-just-parlour-talk-20140602-39eh2.html|newspaper = The Age|date = 2014-06-10|access-date = 2015-11-14|first = Niamh|last = Cremins}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also led to the Parlour Guides to Equitable Practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Parlour Guides to Equitable Practice Parlour|url = http://archiparlour.org/topics/parlour-guides-to-equitable-practice/|website = archiparlour.org|accessdate = 2015-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The New York Center for Independent Publishing''' is located on New York's "Literary Row" at 20 West 44th Street in Midtown Manhattan. Formerly the Small Press Center, the Center was founded by Whitney North Seymour, Jr. in 1984.  The Center's historical seedbed as the home of independent publishing dates back to 1831, when [[James Harper (publisher)|James Harper]], one of the original four Harper Brothers, joined as a member of the [[General Society of Mechanics and Tradesmen of the City of New York]], which has housed the Center since its inception. Other early printer and publisher members include [[John Bishop Putnam]], James J. Little and Benjamin Collins.

The Center provides access to education and expertise in the field of independent publishing, networking opportunities, workshops, teleseminars, lectures, its annual small press book fair and exhibits. The Center also houses [[The Crouse Library for Publishing Arts]], a comprehensive collection of books (many rare and out of print) and other materials on the bookselling and publishing industries. 

The Center's annual signature programs include: the Independent and Small Press Book Fair; National Small Press Month, and its host of reading marathons, lectures, and publishing workshops; the New York Round Table Writers’ Conference; and the series, Emerging Voices: Writers Published by Groundbreaking Independent Presses. In addition to such public programs, each year the Center awards the coveted Poor Richard Award to an independent Publisher who has made an outstanding contribution to the field of independent publishing. Past recipients include: [[Barney Rosset]], [[André Schiffrin]], Peter Workman, Esther Margolis and Bill Henderson.  

The Center is an educational program of the [[General Society of Mechanics and Tradesmen of the City of New York]], located at 20 West 44th Street, between 5th and 6th Avenues in midtown Manhattan.

A '''Nomadic bag''' is a bag woven by various [[nomadic]] tribes of the [[Middle East]] and [[Central Asia]] for utilitarian and decorative purposes.

The nomadic tribes of the Middle East and Central Asia are perhaps more known for the hand knotted [[carpets]] and hand woven [[kilim]]s (flatwoven textiles) that they made. These tribes include but are not limited to the [[Baloch people|Baloch]], the [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]], the [[Afshar tribe|Afshars]], the [[Bakhtyari]], the [[Qashqai people|Qashqai]], the [[Kurds]] and many others. The bags that they wove were done in the same techniques as the larger rugs they also made. The most common technique is [[Persian Carpet|hand-knotted pile]], but many tribal bags were also done in the various flat woven techniques including [[plain weave]] ([[kilim]] weave), soumac technique and other less common techniques.

These bags were used for various purposes. Often they were used for transporting goods while on migration. They also served as storage containers to be used in the tent or [[yurt]]. There are also specialized bags such as bags for carrying mirrors, bags for carrying the [[Qur'an]], bags for carrying tent stakes and more. Often the bags are known by specific names based on the function they served.  Some common bag names are "cuval" ([[camel]] bag), "khorjin" (double-sided [[donkey]] bags) and "mafrash" (bedding bag) to name just a few.

Often, the back panel of a bag will have little or no design. Generally on bags with knotted pile faces, the back of the bag will be executed in a plain woven [[kilim]] technique.

Although there are still some tribal weavers weaving nice bags, it is the antique bags and bag faces that are the most prized and the most collected.

==Bag face==
From the [[collecting|collector]]s point of view, the front or the ''face'' of the bag is much more interesting and more collectible. Often, with antique bags, the backs of the bag have been separated and discarded at some point and only the bagface remains.

[[File:Outside Omphalos at Delphi.jpg|thumb|The omphalos stone displayed outside at Delphi, Greece]]
The '''Omphalos of Delphi''' is an ancient marble monument that was found at the archaeological site of [[Delphi]], [[Greece]].

==Mythology==
The omphalos represents the stone which [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]] wrapped in swaddling clothes, pretending it was Zeus, in order to deceive [[Cronus]].

==Description==
Among the [[Ancient Greeks]], it was a widespread belief that Delphi was the center of the world. According to the myths regarding the founding of the [[Pythia|Delphic Oracle]], [[Zeus]], in his attempt to locate the center of the earth, launched two eagles from the two ends of the world, and the eagles, starting simultaneously and flying at equal speed, crossed their paths above the area of Delphi. From this point, Zeus threw a stone from the sky to see where it will fall. The stone fell at Delphi, which since then was considered to be the center of the world, the omphalos – "navel of the earth". Indeed, the same stone thrown by Zeus took the same name and became the symbol of Apollo, the sacred Oracle and more generally of the region of Delphi. 

The marble-carved stone which constituted the omphalos in the monument with the tripod and the dancers troubled the excavators, because they could not decide if it was the original or a copy from Hellenistic and Roman times. In the 2nd century A.D., [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] traveled to the area of Delphi and has provided us with rare evidence through his work. The stone of the omphalos seems to have been decorated in high relief and had an oval shape. It is possible that in ancient times it was covered by a mesh of wool cloth  and it was kept in the adyton (inner sanctum), beside the tripod and the daphne (bay leaves), the other sacred symbols of the god. As described by Pausanias, within the woolen cloth that was wound around the stone there were precious stones designed in the shape of a mermaid, while two gilded eagles were fixed on top of it. 

Recent studies by French archaeologists have demonstrated that the omphalos and the columns are connected and interlocked. In other words, the stone navel was mounted on the bronze tripods supported by the three dancers, at the top of the column. This is the spot where the omphalos is thought to have been placed till today, as a cover of the column, in order to symbolically supplement the meaning and importance of the Athenian votive offering. The Athenians, wanting to placate and honor the goddess of light, offered him this copy of the original stone, which combined both delphic symbols as a gift from the hands of the three priestess figures of Athenian origin.&lt;ref name=A&gt;[http://odysseus.culture.gr/h/4/gh430.jsp?obj_id=4687 Μόνιμη Έκθεση Αρχαιολογικού Μουσείου Δελφών: Ομφαλός.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ροζίνα Κολώνια, ''Το Αρχαιολογικό Μουσείο Δελφών'', Αθήνα, Υπουργείο Πολιτισμού – Ταμείο Αρχαιολογικών πόρων και Απαλλοτριώσεων, 2009, 60 – 62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Πάνος Βαλαβάνης, ''Ιερά και Αγώνες στην Αρχαία Ελλάδα.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5275">'''Reel Women Media''' is a [[filmmaking]] [[non-profit organization]] in [[Austin, Texas]], USA, that provides support to women in the [[film industry]].

[[Ally Acker]] coined the term Reel Women in 1984 for her book ''Reel Women: Pioneers of the Cinema, 1896 to Present'' and documentary series. This was the first production in the market that revealed the transformative roles women had within the film industry that were not as widely recognized by prior film history studies.

'''René Wellek''' (August 22, 1903 – November 11, 1995) was a [[Czech Republic|Czech]]-[[United States|American]] [[comparative literature|comparative]] [[literary critic]]. Like [[Erich Auerbach]], Wellek was an eminent product of the Central European [[philology|philological]] tradition and was known as a vastly erudite and "fair-minded critic of critics."&lt;ref name="RobertMcG" /&gt;

René Wellek was born and raised in [[Vienna]], speaking [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[German language|German]]. He studied literature at the [[Charles University]] in Prague, and was active among the [[Prague linguistic circle|Prague School]] linguists there, before moving to teach at [[School of Slavonic and East European Studies]] (now part of [[University College London]]) in 1935. His younger brother [[Albert Wellek]] (1904-1972) was one of the founders of musical psychology and lived in Germany. Before 1939, Wellek published some 60 items, all written in Czech.&lt;ref&gt;Wellek, René. ''Concepts of Criticism'' ed. S. G. Nichols, Jr. New Haven and London: Yale UP, 1963, p. 365.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1939, the beginning of [[World War II]] in Europe, Wellek lived in America.&lt;ref name="RobertMcG" /&gt; He taught first at the [[University of Iowa]] for seven years until 1946, and then, beginning in that year, at [[Yale University]], where he established and chaired a department of comparative literature. In the United States, he was "widely regarded as a founder of the study of [[comparative literature]]."&lt;ref name="RobertMcG" /&gt;  With [[Austin Warren]], Wellek published a landmark volume entitled ''[[Theory of Literature]]'', one of the first works to systematize [[literary theory]].

Beginning in the 1960s, Wellek defended the [[New Critics]] against the condemnation of their work in the name of a [[Semiotic literary criticism|structuralist]]-influenced literary theory, and is thus sometimes classed as a conservative critic. Wellek advocated a synthesized approach to literary criticism, one that included 1) literary theory, 2) a careful study of previous works of criticism, and 3) a thorough understanding of the surrounding history involved in an author's creation of a work, including the author's personal history and milieu. Any approach elevating one of these aspects above the other would be in error.&lt;ref&gt;Wellek, René. ''Concepts of Criticism'' ed. S. G. Nichols, Jr. New Haven and London: Yale UP, 1963, p. 2 and p. 20. Reprint of "Literary Theory, Criticism, and History," ''English Studies Today,'' 2nd ser., ed. G. A. Bonnard (Bern, Francke Verlag, 1961) pp. 53-65.&lt;/ref&gt; Wellek said the best literary critic must "do what every scientist and scholar does: to isolate his object, in our case, the literary work of art, to contemplate it intently, to analyze, to interpret, and finally to evaluate it by criteria derived from, verified by, buttressed by, as wide a knowledge, as close an observation, as keen a sensibility, as honest a judgment as we can command."&lt;ref&gt;''ibid''. p 17.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Wellek, bringing all of literary theory, criticism, and history into consideration allows a critic to achieve "victory over impermanence, relativity, and history."&lt;ref&gt;''ibid'' p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The crowning work of Wellek's career was an eight-volume ''magnum opus'' entitled ''A History of Modern Criticism: 1750-1950'', the last two volumes of which he dictated from his bed in a nursing home at age 90.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/16/arts/rene-wellek-92-a-professor-of-comparative-literature-dies.html Wellek obituary]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was founded in [[London]], [[England]] in 1853 as '''The Photographic Society of London''' with the objective of promoting the art and science of [[photography]], and in 1854 received [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|Royal]] [[patronage]] from [[Queen Victoria]] and [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]]. A change to the society's name to reflect the Royal patronage was, however, not considered expedient at the time. In 1874 it was renamed the '''Photographic Society of Great Britain''', and from 1894 it became known as '''The Royal Photographic Society of Great Britain'''. A registered [[Charitable organization|charity]] since 1962, in July 2004, The Royal Photographic Society of Great Britain was granted a [[Royal charter]] recognising its eminence in the field of photography as a [[learned society]].&lt;ref name="RPSOGB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RPS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rps.org/about/history|title=History – RPS|accessdate=2016-06-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160714202810/http://www.rps.org/about/history|archive-date=2016-07-14|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1107831&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0|title=Find charities: 1107831 – THE ROYAL PHOTOGRAPHIC SOCIETY OF GREAT BRITAIN|publisher=Charity Commission|date= |accessdate=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/RemovedCharityMain.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=212684&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0|title=Find charities: 212684 – THE ROYAL PHOTOGRAPHIC SOCIETY OF GREAT BRITAIN – 1853|date= |accessdate=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; For most of its history the Society was based at various premises in [[London]]. It moved to [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] in 1979, and since 2004 its headquarters has been at Fenton House in Bath, England. Membership is international and open to anyone with an interest in photography.

In addition to standard membership, the Society also offers three levels of distinctions which set recognised standards of achievement throughout the world, and can be applied for by both members and non-members: [[Licentiate (degree)|Licentiate]], Associate and [[Fellow#Learned or professional societies, or speciality training|Fellow]], in all aspects of photography and vocational qualifications in the areas of Creative Industries and Imaging Science.&lt;ref name="RPS2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rps.org/distinctions/about-distinctions|title=About Distinctions – RPS|accessdate=2016-06-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610014157/http://www.rps.org/distinctions/about-distinctions|archive-date=2016-06-10|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It runs an extensive programme of more than 300 events throughout the United Kingdom and abroad, through local groups and special interest groups. The Society acts as a national voice for photographers and for photography more generally and it represents these interests on a range of governmental and national bodies dealing with areas as diverse as copyright and photographers' rights.

== History ==
[[File:Royal Photographic Society 1858.jpg|thumb|Charles Thurston Thompson: ''Exhibition of the Photographic Society, London'', 1858]]
Photographers were slow in coming together and forming clubs and societies. The first was an informal grouping the [[Edinburgh Calotype Club]] around 1843 and the first photographic society, the Leeds Photographic Society in 1852 and claims to be the oldest photographic society in the world,&lt;ref&gt;The Société héliographique was established in Paris in 1851.&lt;/ref&gt; although it had a break between 1878 and 1881 when it ceased to exist independently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Ferguson |url=http://www.lps1852.co.uk/ |title=lps1852.co.uk |publisher=lps1852.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other countries the [[Société française de photographie]] was founded in Paris in 1854.

=== Founding and early history ===
The catalyst behind the formation of The Photographic Society was [[Roger Fenton]]. The Great Exhibition of 1851 had raised public awareness of photography and in December 1852 an [[Exhibition of Recent Specimens of Photography|exhibition of nearly 800 photographs]] at The Society of Arts had brought together amateur and professional photographers. The inaugural meeting of The Photographic Society was held on 20 January 1853. Fenton became the Society's first secretary, a position he held for three years.

=== Modernisation and the 1970s ===
As Jane Fletcher has argued the changing nature of photography and photographic education in the early 1970s forced The Society to modernise and to become more relevant to British photography. An internal review led to constitutional changes, the introduction of a new distinction called the Licentiate in 1972 and six new specialist groups were established.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, Jane, '"Un Embarras de Richesses": Making the Most of the Royal Photographic Society Collection, 1970-1980', ''Photography &amp; Culture'', vol. 3., no. 2. (July 2010), pp. 133-152.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bath Project ===
The rising cost of maintaining The Society's premises in [[South Audley Street]], London, eventually led the Society's Executive Committee to look for alternative premises. The Council approved at a meeting on 1 April 1977 a move to Bath and the establishment of a National Centre of Photography to house the Society's headquarters and collection. An appeal for £300,000 was launched in the summer of 1978 for the funds needed to convert The Octagon and adjacent buildings in Milsom Street, Bath.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, Jane, '"Un Embarras de Richesses": Making the Most of the Royal Photographic Society Collection, 1970-1980', ''Photography &amp; Culture'', vol. 3., no. 2 (July 2010), pp. 148–149.&lt;/ref&gt; The inaugural exhibition opened in May 1980 with the building officially opened by [[Princess Margaret]] in April 1981.

=== Premises ===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:35 Russell Square London.jpg|thumb|35 Russell Square, London, during the Society's occupancy. The building was demolished to make way for the expansion of the University of London. Photograph: Bedford Lemere &amp; Co.]] --&gt;
Although the Society's inaugural meeting took places at the Society of Arts in London, it was some time before the Society had its own permanent home. It held functions as a number of addresses, some concurrently for different types of meetings.

Premises used were: Royal Society of Arts, John Adam Street; 20 Bedford Street, 4 Trafalgar Square, 21 Regent Street, 28 George Street (Hanover Square), 1 Coventry Street; Kings College, Strand; 9 Conduit Street, 5A Pall Mall East, London – used for certain meetings until 1899; 50 Great Russell Street; and 12 Hanover Square, London.

The Society's premises were:
* 1899–1909 – 66 [[Russell Square]], London.
* 1909–1940 – 35 Russell Square, London.&lt;ref&gt;The Photographic Journal, May 1940, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1940–1968 – Princes Gate, South Kensington, London.
* 1968–1970 – 1 [[Maddox Street]], Mayfair, London (temporary premises).
* 1970–1979 – 14 South Audley Street, Mayfair, London
* 1980–2003 – The Octagon, [[Milsom Street, Bath]].
* 2004–January 2019 – Fenton House, 122 Wells Road, Bath; officially opened 16 February 2005.
* 1 February 2019 – Paintworks, Bath Road, Bristol.

== Collection and archive ==

=== Collection ===
The Society had collected photographs and items of historical importance on an ad hoc basis but there was no formal collecting policy until John Dudley Johnston was appointed Honorary Curator a post he held between 1924 and 1955.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Pam, ''The Royal Photographic Society Collection. A companion volume to vol. 134, no. 10, of The Photographic Journal'', p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Up to Johnston's appointment the collection has largely concentrated on technical advances of photography and Johnston began to concentrate on adding pictorial photography to the collection.
On Johnston's death in 1955 his role of Honorary Curator was taken over by his wife Florence and a succession of paid and unpaid staff including Gail Buckland, Carolyn Bloore, Arthur Gill, Valerie Lloyd, and Brian Coe, with Professor [[Margaret Harker]] as Honorary Curator over a long period. Pam Roberts was appointed curator, a position she held until the collection was closed in 2001 pending its transfer to the National Museum of Photography, Film, and Television (NMPFT) in 2002.&lt;ref name="The Collection"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rps.org/the-collection|title=The Collection|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112141125/http://www.rps.org/the-collection|archive-date=2011-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move was supported by the Head of the museum, [[Amanda Nevill]] who had been The Society's Secretary in the 1990s.

The Collection was transferred from the National Media Museum to the Victoria and Albert Museum in 2017 where it now forms a key part of the museum's Photography Centre. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/apr/05/va-to-open-new-galleries-for-photos-acquired-from-bradford-museum |title=V&amp;A to open new galleries for photos acquired from Bradford museum |last=Ellis-Petersen |first=Hannah  |date=2017-04-05 |website=theguardian.com |access-date=2018-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1953 the number of items in the Society's Collection had reached 'upwards' of 3000 items.&lt;ref&gt;Wratten, I. D., 'The Presidential Address', ''The Photographic Journal'', January 1953, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the Collection's transfer to the NMPFT, now the [[National Science and Media Museum]], it consisted of some 270,000 photographic objects, over 6000 items of photographic equipment, 13,000 books, 13,000 bound periodicals, and 5000 other photography-related documents.

The Tyng Collection owned by the RPS is a collection of outstanding pictorial photography started in 1927 by an American philanthropist and a Society member, Stephen H. Tyng. He established a foundation to promote and recognise photographic work of outstanding pictorial merit. The first '''colour''' print to be accepted into the Tyng Collection, in 1960, was "Madrasi Fishermen" taken by Dr [[S. D. Jouhar]] FRPS FPSA during his six-month trip to India in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;''Photographic Society of America Journal'', Vol. 29, No. 4, April 1963, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Archive ===
The Society's early records, Council, Committee and Meeting Minute books, are held with the Society's Collection at the V&amp;A. More recent Council and committee minutes are retained by the Society in Bath. There is no published or online record of former or current members of the Society. Occasional lists of members were published by the Society up the 1890s when lists were issued more regularly, from the 1930s membership lists were issued periodically and are now not issued. New members have usually been recorded in the ''Photographic Journal''. There is a project to publish an online searchable database of members from 1853-1900. This project has been undertaken by Dr Michael Pritchard and will be published by [[De Montfort University]]'s photographic history research centre&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dmu.ac.uk/research/aad/photographic-history-research-centre/ |title={title} |access-date=2011-11-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403022217/http://www.dmu.ac.uk/research/aad/photographic-history-research-centre/ |archive-date=2012-04-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Society has a card index of members from the late 1930s-1980s which it will search on request and may also be able to assist with membership enquiries between 1900 and the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rps.org |title=Requests may be directed to the Director-General of the Society in Bath |publisher=Rps.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140402035959/http://www.rps.org/ |archive-date=2014-04-02 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Current membership data is held in a computer database and remains confidential.

== Publications ==
From the Society's formation it has published a journal and other publications have been issued over the years. 
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Photographic Journal cover February 1937.jpeg|thumb|The Photographic Journal, February 1937]] --&gt;

=== ''The Photographic Journal'' ===
The Society's journal was original called ''The Journal of the Photographic Society of London'' and for most of its existence has simply been called ''[[The Photographic Journal]]'', it is now called ''RPS Journal''. It has been published continuously since 1853 making it the UK's oldest photographic periodical. The journal, particularly in its early years was read and distributed beyond the Society's membership.  Past editors have included Arthur Henfrey, [[Hugh Welch Diamond]], William de Wiveleslie Abney, H. H. Blacklock, and more recently [[Jack Schofield (journalist)|Jack Schofield]] and David Land. The current editor is Clare Harris.

=== ''The Imaging Science Journal'' ===
The Society publishes a peer-reviewed journal devoted to imaging science and technology, ''[[The Imaging Science Journal]]'' (''ISG''), previously known as the ''Journal of Photographic Science''. The ''ISJ'' is now published on behalf of The Society by Maney Publishing in print and digital versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://maneypublishing.com/index.php/journals/ims/ |title=Taylor &amp; Francis Group has acquired Maney Publishing |date=18 November 2015 |website=Maney Publishing |access-date=7 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101083202/http://maneypublishing.com/index.php/journals/ims/ |archive-date=2014-01-01 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Year's Photography'' ===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:The Years Photography 1961.jpg|thumb|The Year's Photography 1961]]  --&gt;
''The Year's Photography'' was published annually by the Society from 1922 until at least 1961. The flyleaf of the 1957 edition states: "This edition contains a selection from all the exhibitions held in 1956 under the Society's auspices which contained pictures suitable for reproduction There are also review of artistic photography and of the nature exhibition." The publication gives a broad overview of the state of British amateur and professional photography during the year.

=== Other publications ===
Over the years the Society has published a number of one-off publications often in partnership with commercial publishers. These include John Wall's ''Directory of British Photographic Collections'' in conjunction with Heinemann (1977), Roger Reynolds (ed.), ''Portfolio One'' (2007) and Roger Reynolds (ed.), ''Portfolio Two'' (2010). The Society publishes an annual ''International Print Exhibition'' catalogue and increasingly publishes digital catalogues of its exhibitions.

==Membership==
There are no restrictions on membership which is international and includes amateur and professional photographers through to photographic scientists and those involved in exhibiting, curating and writing about photography, as well as those with a general interest in the medium.&lt;ref name="The Collection"/&gt; Many of the great names in photographic history as well as many well-known photographers today have been members.

==Special interest groups==
The Society established special interest groups to cater for specific interests within the membership. These have included:
* Pictorial Group (1919)
* Science and Technical Group (1920)
* Kinematograph Group (1923)&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Photographic Journal]]'', May 1925, p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Colour Group (1927)&lt;ref&gt;Provisionally formed 27 February 1927. ''The [[Photographic Journal]]'', May 1928, p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt;
As of 2016 there are fourteen groups &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rps.org/special-interest-groups|title=Groups|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-05-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160607182344/http://www.rps.org/special-interest-groups|archive-date=2016-06-07|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distinctions and qualifications ==
Until 1895 membership was limited simply to 'members' with some minor distinctions for those living overseas, In that year the Society introduced a new membership category of Fellow and it now offers (from lowest to highest distinction):
*'''LRPS''': ''Licentiateship'' of the Royal Photographic Society introduced in 1972
*'''ARPS''': ''Associateship'' of the Royal Photographic Society introduced in 1924
*'''FRPS''': ''Fellowship'' of the Royal Photographic Society introduced in 1895&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://rps.org/distinctions/about-distinctions |title=About Distinctions |website=rps.org |access-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These require the submission of evidence – photographs or written – which is assessed by competent panels before they are awarded by the Society's Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.amateurphotographer.co.uk/technique/rps-day-distinction-117981 |title=RPS: A day of distinction |last=Harris |first=Geoff |date=2018-04-22 |website=amateurphotographer.co.uk |access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition the Society's [[Imaging Science|Imaging Scientist]] Qualifications provide a structure leading to professional qualifications for engineers, scientists and technologists whose professional activities are concerned with quantitative or mechanic aspects of imaging systems or their applications. These are broken down into four levels;
*'''QIS'''; Qualified Imaging Scientist and Licentiate (QIS LRPS) of the Royal Photographic Society (Level 1)
*'''GIS'''; Graduate Imaging Scientist and Associate (GIS ARPS) of the Royal Photographic Society (Level 2)
*'''AIS'''; Accredited Imaging Scientist and Associate (AIS ARPS) of the Royal Photographic Society (Level 3)
*'''ASIS'''; Accredited Senior Imaging Scientist and Fellow (ASIS FRPS) of the Royal Photographic Society (Level 4)

== Exhibitions ==
The Society has held an annual exhibition since 1854.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://peib.dmu.ac.uk peib.dmu.ac.uk] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180620010250/http://peib.dmu.ac.uk/ |date=2018-06-20 }} and [http://erps.dmu.ac.uk/ erps.dmu.ac.uk] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917204335/http://erps.dmu.ac.uk/ |date=2008-09-17 }} for a list and searchable database of exhibitions and exhibitors from 1854-1915.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Society now holds an annual International Print Exhibition, which tours the United Kingdom, an annual International Projected Image Exhibition which tours; a Members' Exhibition and Science exhibition; and monthly exhibitions of members' work at Fenton House.

==Workshops==
The Society runs more than 300 workshops and lectures throughout the UK that are open to members and non-members.  Many are held at the RPS headquarters in Bath and range from an Introduction to Digital Photography to Plant and Garden Photography.

== Awards and medals ==

'''Sigmund Freud's views on homosexuality''' have been described as deterministic, whereas he would ascribe biological and psychological factors in explaining the principal causes of [[homosexuality]]. [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] believed that humans are born with [[Polymorphous perversity|unfocused sexual libidinal drives]], and therefore argued that homosexuality might be a deviation from this. Nevertheless, he also felt that certain deeply rooted forms of homosexuality were difficult or impossible to change.

==Overview==
Freud's most important articles on homosexuality were written between 1905, when he published ''Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality'', and 1922, when he published "Certain Neurotic Mechanisms in Jealousy, Paranoia, and Homosexuality".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewes|1988|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freud believed that all humans were bisexual, by which he primarily meant that everyone incorporates aspects of both sexes, and that everyone is sexually attracted to both sexes. In his view, this was true anatomically and therefore also mentally and psychologically. Heterosexuality and homosexuality both developed from this original bisexual disposition.&lt;ref name="Ruse"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ruse|1988|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; As one of the causes of homosexuality, Freud mentions the distressing heterosexual experience: "Those cases are of particular interest in which the libido changes over to an inverted sexual object after a distressing experience with a normal one."&lt;ref name="3essays"&gt;{{Harvnb|Freud|1905|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud appears to have been undecided whether or not homosexuality was [[pathological]], expressing different views on this issue at different times and places in his work. Freud frequently called homosexuality an "inversion", something which in his view was distinct from the necessarily pathological perversions, and suggested that several distinct kinds might exist, cautioning that his conclusions about it were based on a small and not necessarily representative sample of patients.&lt;ref name="Lewes"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewes|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SigmundFreudOnSexuality" /&gt;

Freud derived much of his information on homosexuality from psychiatrists and sexologists such as [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]] and [[Magnus Hirschfeld]], and was also influenced by [[Eugen Steinach]], a [[Vienna|Viennese]] endocrinologist who transplanted [[testicle]]s from straight men into gay men in attempts to change their sexual orientation. Freud stated that Steinach's research had "thrown a strong light on the organic determinants of [[homoeroticism]]",&lt;ref name="SigmundFreudOnSexualityP58"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewes|1988|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; but cautioned that it was premature to expect that the operations he performed would make possible a therapy that could be generally applied. In his view, such transplant operations would be effective in changing sexual orientation only in cases in which homosexuality was strongly associated with physical characteristics typical of the opposite sex, and probably no similar therapy could be applied to lesbianism.&lt;ref name="SigmundFreudOnSexuality"&gt;{{Harvnb|Freud|1991|pp=58–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SigmundFreudCaseHistoriesII" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LeVay1996" /&gt; In fact Steinach's method was doomed to failure because the [[immune system]]s of his patients rejected the transplanted glands, and was eventually exposed as ineffective and often harmful.&lt;ref name="LeVay1996"&gt;{{Harvnb|LeVay|1996|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Female homosexuality==
Freud's main discussion of female homosexuality was the 1920 paper "The Psychogenesis of a Case of Homosexuality in a Woman," which described his analysis of a young woman who had entered therapy because her parents were concerned that she was a [[lesbian]]. Her father hoped that psychoanalysis would cure her lesbianism, but in Freud's view, the prognosis was unfavourable because of the circumstances under which the woman entered therapy, and because the homosexuality was not an illness or neurotic conflict. Freud wrote that changing homosexuality was difficult and therefore possible only under unusually favourable conditions, observing that "in general to undertake to convert a fully developed homosexual into a heterosexual does not offer much more prospect of success than the reverse."&lt;ref name="SigmundFreudCaseHistoriesIIP376"&gt;{{Harvnb|Freud|1991|p=376}}&lt;/ref&gt; Success meant making heterosexual feeling possible rather than eliminating homosexual feelings.&lt;ref name="SigmundFreudCaseHistoriesII"&gt;{{Harvnb|Freud|1991|p=375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views on attempts to change homosexuality==
Freud believed that homosexuals could seldom be convinced that sex with someone of the opposite sex would provide them with the same pleasure they derived from sex with someone of the same sex. Patients often had only superficial reasons to want to become heterosexual, pursuing treatment due to [[Minority stress|social disapproval]], which was not a strong enough motive for change. Some patients might have no real desire to become heterosexual, seeking treatment only so that they could convince themselves that they had done everything possible to change, leaving them free to return to homosexuality afterwards. Freud, therefore, told the parents only that he was prepared to study their daughter to determine what effects therapy might have. Freud concluded that he was probably dealing with a case of biologically innate homosexuality, and eventually broke off the treatment because of what he saw as his patient's hostility to men.&lt;ref name="Lewes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Freud|1991|pp=371–400}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OconnorandRyan"&gt;{{Harvnb|O’Connor|Ryan|1993|pp=30–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1935 letter===
In 1935, Freud wrote to a mother who had asked him to treat her son's homosexuality, a letter that would later become famous:&lt;ref name="Lewes" /&gt;

{{quote|I gather from your letter that your son is a homosexual. I am most impressed by the fact that you do not mention this term yourself in your information about him. May I question you why you avoid it? Homosexuality is assuredly no advantage, but it is nothing to be ashamed of, no vice, no degradation; it cannot be classified as an illness; we consider it to be a variation of the sexual function, produced by a certain arrest of sexual development. Many highly respectable individuals of ancient and modern times have been homosexuals, several of the greatest men among them. (Plato, Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, etc). It is a great injustice to persecute homosexuality as a crime&amp;nbsp;–and a cruelty, too. If you do not believe me, read the books of [[Havelock Ellis]].
By asking me if I can help [your son], you mean, I suppose, if I can abolish homosexuality and make normal heterosexuality take its place. The answer is, in a general way we cannot promise to achieve it. In a certain number of cases we succeed in developing the blighted germs of heterosexual tendencies, which are present in every homosexual; in the majority of cases it is no more possible. It is a question of the quality and the age of the individual. The result of treatment cannot be predicted.

What analysis can do for your son runs in a different line. If he is unhappy, neurotic, torn by conflicts, inhibited in his social life, analysis may bring him harmony, peace of mind, full efficiency, whether he remains homosexual or gets changed.&lt;ref name="ErnstLFreud"&gt;{{Harvnb|Freud|1992|pp=423–424}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''São Jorge Castle''' ({{lang-pt|Castelo de São Jorge}}; {{IPA-pt|kɐʃˈtɛlu dɨ sɐ̃w̃ ˈʒɔɾʒ(ɨ)}}; Saint George Castle) is a [[Moors|Moorish]] [[castle]] occupying a commanding hilltop overlooking the historic centre of the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] city of [[Lisbon]] and [[Tagus River]]. The strongly fortified [[citadel]] dates from medieval period of Portuguese history, and is one of the main tourist sites of Lisbon.

==History==
[[File:Castle-DuarteGalvao3.jpg|thumb|left|235px|A 16th-century illuminated manuscript of Lisbon, in the ''Crónica de D. Afonso Henriques'' by Duarte Galvao, depicting the castle and walls, including the Royal Palace (''Alcáçova'') (1505)]]
[[File:Lisbon - Lisbonne - Lisboa 1572.png|thumb|235px|left|Caravels and carracks in the Tagus River, with the castle in the centre distance, unknown artist (1572)]]
Although the first fortifications on this hilltop date from the 2nd century BC, [[archaeology|archaeological]] excavations have identified a human presence in the Tagus valley as far back as the 6th century BC. The first fortification was, presumably, erected in 48 BC, when Lisbon was classified as a Roman municipality.&lt;ref name="SIPA"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.monumentos.pt/Site/APP_PagesUser/SIPA.aspx?id=3128 |title=Castelo de São Jorge e restos das cercas de Lisboa (PT031106120023) |publisher=SIPA–Sistema de Informação para o Património Arquitectónico |editor=SIPA |location=Lisbon, Portugal |language=Portuguese |first=João |last=Silva |first2=Albertina |last2=Rodrigues |year=2002 |accessdate=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hill was first used by indigenous [[Celt]]ic tribes, then by [[Phoenicia]]ns, [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], and [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] as a defensible outpost that was later expropriated by [[Ancient Rome|Roman]], [[Suevi|Suebic]], [[Visigoths|Visigothic]], and [[Moors|Moorish]] peoples. During the 10th century, the fortifications were rebuilt by Muslim [[Berbers|Berber]] forces, these included the walls or ''Cerca Moura'' ("Moorish Encirclement").&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

===Kingdom===
In the context of the [[Christian]] ''[[Reconquista]]'', the castle and the city of Lisbon were freed from Moorish rule in 1147 by [[Afonso Henriques]] and northern European knights in the [[Siege of Lisbon]]  during the [[Second Crusade]]; this victory was the only notable success of that failed crusade.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; According to an oft-repeated [[legend]], the [[knight]] [[Martim Moniz]], noticing that one of the doors to the castle was open, prevented the Moors from closing it by throwing his own body into the breach, thus allowing Christian soldiers to enter at the cost of his own life. With the taking of the castle Christian forces were able to maintain the defense of Lisbon until the end of the 12th century.

When Lisbon became the capital of the kingdom in 1255, the castle served as the ''alcáçova'', a fortified residence for [[Afonso III of Portugal|Afonso III]], in his role as governor.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; It was extensively renovated around 1300 by [[Denis I of Portugal|King Denis I]], transforming the Moorish alcáçova into the Royal Palace of the Alcáçova.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; Between 1373 and 1375, King [[Ferdinand I of Portugal|Ferdinand I]] ordered the building of the ''Cerca Nova'' or ''Cerca Fernandina'', the walled compound that enclosed the entirety of the castle.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; The master builders João Fernandes and Vasco Brás were responsible for its construction.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; This wall, which partially replaced the old Moorish walls, was designed to encircle previously unprotected parts of the city. Completed in two years, it had 77 towers and a perimeter of {{convert|5400|m|ft}}.

The castle and the city resisted the forces of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] several times during the 14th century (notably in 1373 and in 1383–1384). It was during this period (the late 14th century) that the castle was dedicated to [[Saint George]] by King [[John I of Portugal|John I]], who had married the English princess [[Philippa of Lancaster]].&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; Saint George, the warrior-saint, was normally represented slaying a dragon, and was very popular in both countries.

From this point onward many of the kingdom's records were housed in the ''Torre de Ulisses'' ("Tower of Ulysses"), also known as the ''Torre Albarrã'', until the reign of [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]].&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; The Portuguese [[Torre do Tombo|National Archive]], where the eminent Portuguese [[chronicle]]rs [[Fernão Lopes]] and [[Damião de Góis]] once worked, is still referred to as the ''[[Torre do Tombo]]'' (literally the "Tower of the Archive"). On 9 December 1448, Gil Pires was named the castle master builder to replace Afonso Esteves, being paid 400 [[Portuguese real|réis]] for his work.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; Between 1448 and 1451, the master builder was paid several stipends for his work on the palace. Similarly, the mason João de Alverca was paid a substantial sum for stonework. These public works continued from 1449 until 1452, with additional payments being made for labor and materials to convert the building from a fortified castle to a royal residence.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

As the royal palace, the castle was the setting for the reception by King [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]] of the navigator [[Vasco da Gama]] when he returned from discovering the maritime route to India in 1498. The castle also served as a theater in 1502 when pioneering playwright [[Gil Vicente]] staged his ''Monólogo do Vaqueiro'' to honor the birth of Manuel I's son and heir, the future [[John III of Portugal|João III]].&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

Around the early 16th century, following the construction of the [[Ribeira Palace]] beside the [[Tagus]] river, the Palace of Alcáçova  began to lose its importance.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; An [[1531 Lisbon earthquake|earthquake]] occurring in 1531 further damaged the old castle, contributing further to its decay and neglect.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; In 1569, King [[Sebastiao I of Portugal|Sebastian]] ordered the rebuilding of the royal apartments in the castle, intending to use it as his official residence. As part of the rebuilding, in 1577 Filippo Terzi demolished one of the towers near the principal facade of the Church of Loreto.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; However, many of the works were never completed after the young king's apparent death during the [[Battle of Alcácer Quibir]]. The following [[Struggle for the throne of Portugal|Portuguese dynastic crisis]] opened the way for [[Iberian Union|sixty years of Spanish rule]] and the castle was converted into military barracks and a prison.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; On 30 December 1642, Teodósio de Frias the Younger was appointed master builder to continue the works begun by his father, Luís de Frias, and his grandfather, Teodósio de Frias. This was part of a greater plan by the Spanish forces to recommission the fortification. 
[[File:Castelo de São Jorge (14005714101).jpg|thumb|center|500px|Lisbon seen from São Jorge Castle]]
However, after Portugal regained its independence following the [[Portuguese Restoration War]], the works were taken over by the Portuguese government. On 6 November 1648, Nicolau de Langres was called upon to take over the design, execution and construction of a new fortification that would surround the Castle of São Jorge and the city walls of Lisbon. In 1650 the military architect Mateus do Couto was named master builder of the project and reconstruction took on a new formality: although the military engineer João Gillot built new walls in 1652, construction again followed Couto's plans between 1657 and 1733. In 1673, the Soldiers' Hospital, dedicated to ''São João de Deus'' (St John of God), was installed on the grounds beside the Rua do Recolhimento. At the end of the 17th century the ''Recolhimento do Castelo'' ("Castle Shelter") was constructed along the southeast angle of the courtyard, and in 1733, new projects were initiated by master Custódio Vieira.

The [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]] severely damaged the castle and contributed to its continuing decay: apart from the walls of the old castle, the soldier's hospital and the ''Recolhimento'' were left in ruins. The necessity of maintaining a supporting military force within the capital city required expansion of the site's role of garrison and presidio. From 1780 to 1807, the charitable institution [[Casa Pia]], dedicated to the education of poor children, was established in the citadel, while soldiers continued to be garrisoned on site. Inspired by the events of the earthquake and the following tsunami, the first [[geodesy|geodetic]] observatory in Portugal was constructed in 1788 at the top of one of the towers of the castle, later referred to as the ''Torre do Observatório'' (Observatory Tower).

===Republic===
As part of the commemorative celebrations marking the foundation of nationhood and restoration of independence ({{lang-pt|Fundação da Nacionalidade e da Restauração da Independência}}), the government of [[António de Oliveira Salazar]] initiated extensive renovations at the site. Most of the incongruous structures added to the castle compound in previous centuries were demolished, under the supervision of the DGEMN, and there was a partial restoration of the ''Recolhimento''. In addition, on 25 October 1947, a monument dedicated to [[Afonso Henriques]], presented by the city of Porto, of a replica created by Soares dos Reis (in 1887) was installed on the grounds.

In 1998, the semi-rectangular spaces, columns and cistern were adapted into the museum ''Olissipónia''.

On 22 August 2006, Direcção Regional de Cultura Lisboa (DRCLisboa) defined a special protection zone, that included the Castle of São Jorge and the rest of the walls of Lisbon, the ''Baixa Pombalina'' and various properties that were already classified as cultural heritage. The ''Conselho Nacional de Cultura'' (National Council of Culture) proposed shelving this definition on 10 October 2011, which was supported by [[IGESPAR]].

==Architecture==
[[File:CastleSaintGeorge.jpg|thumb|800px|center|A panorama of the entire Castle of São Jorge]]
The castle is in the centre of [[Lisbon]], on a hill, while many of its walls extend around the citadel into the civil parishes that surround it to the east and south.

The castle's plan is roughly square, and it was originally encircled by a wall, to form a [[citadel]]. The castle complex consists of the castle itself (the ''castelejo''), some ancillary buildings (including the ruins of the royal palace), gardens, and a large terraced square from which an impressive panorama of Lisbon is visible. The main entrance to the citadel is a 19th-century gate surmounted by the [[coat-of-arms]] of Portugal, the name of [[Maria II of Portugal|Queen Maria II]], and the date 1846. This gate permits access to the main square (''Praça d'Armas''), which is decorated with old cannons and a bronze statue of [[Afonso Henriques]], the Portuguese monarch who took the castle from the Moors. This statue is a copy of the 19th-century original, by the [[Romanticism|romantic]] sculptor [[António Soares dos Reis]], which is located near [[Guimarães Castle]] in northern Portugal.

The remnants of the royal palace are located near the main square, but all that is left are some walls and a few rebuilt rooms such as the ''Casa Ogival''. It now hosts the ''Olissipónia'', a multimedia show about the history of Lisbon.

The medieval castle is located toward the northwest corner of the citadel, at its highest point. Hypothetically, during a [[siege]], if attackers managed to enter the citadel, the castle was the last stronghold, the last place in which to take refuge. It is rectangular, with ten towers. A wall with a tower and a connecting door divides the castle courtyard into halves. A series of stairways allow visitors to reach the walkway atop the wall and the towers, from which magnificent views of Lisbon can be enjoyed. The Tower of Ulysses (where the [[Torre do Tombo|''Torre do Tombo'' archive]] used to be) had in 1998 a [[camera obscura]] installed&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.camera-obscura.org.uk/Camera_Obscura/Camera_Obscuras.html Camera Obscuras]&lt;/ref&gt; that allows spectators a 360-degree view of the city and [[Tagus River]].

Apart from its main walls, the castle is protected, on its southern and eastern sides, by a [[barbican]] (''barbacã''), a low wall that prevented [[siege engines]] from approaching the main castle walls. The northern and western sides of the castle, on the other hand, were naturally protected by the steep hillside sloping downward from the castle's foundations. The castle is also partially encircled by a [[moat]], now dry. The main entrance is fronted by a stone bridge across the moat. On the west side, there is a long curtain wall extending downhill, ending at a tower (the ''Torre De Couraça''). This tower served to control the valley below, and it could also be used to escape, in case the castle was taken by enemies.

A '''taste receptor''' is a type of [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] which facilitates the sensation of [[taste]]. These receptors are of four types. When food or other substances enter the mouth, molecules interact with saliva and are bound to taste receptors in the oral cavity and other locations. Molecules which give a sensation of taste are considered "sapid".&lt;ref name="oven"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cup.columbia.edu/book/978-0-231-14706-4/the-science-of-the-oven/excerpt|title=The Science of the Oven - Excerpt from Chapter 1|last=This|first=Hervé|date=2012|accessdate=30 Apr 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taste receptors are divided into two families:{{cn | reason = There are five basic tastes; only 3 are represented with these two families.  It would be more credible if a good reference says there are only these two. |date=April 2018}}
* Type 1, [[Sweetness|sweet]], first characterized in 2001:&lt;ref name="pmid11509186"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nelson G, Hoon MA, Chandrashekar J, Zhang Y, Ryba NJ, Zuker CS | title = Mammalian sweet taste receptors | journal = Cell | volume = 106 | issue = 3 | pages = 381–90 | date = Aug 2001 | pmid = 11509186 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(01)00451-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Gene|TAS1R2}} – {{Gene|TAS1R3}}
* Type 2, [[bitter (taste)|bitter]], first characterized in 2000:&lt;ref name="pmid10761934"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Adler E, Hoon MA, Mueller KL, Chandrashekar J, Ryba NJ, Zuker CS | title = A novel family of mammalian taste receptors | journal = Cell | volume = 100 | issue = 6 | pages = 693–702 | date = Mar 2000 | pmid = 10761934 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80705-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Gene|TAS2R1}} – {{Gene|TAS2R50}}, and {{Gene|TAS2R60}}

Combinations of these receptors in dimers or other complexes contributes to different perceptions of taste.

Visual, olfactive, “sapictive” (the perception of tastes), trigeminal (hot, cool), mechanical, all contribute to the perception of ''taste''. Of these, transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 ([[TRPV1]]) vanilloid receptors are responsible for the perception of heat from some molecules such as capsaicin, and a [[TRPM8|CMR1 receptor]] is responsible for the perception of cold from molecules such as menthol, eucalyptol, and icilin.&lt;ref name="oven"/&gt;

== Tissue distribution ==

The [[gustatory system]] consists of taste receptor cells in [[taste bud]]s. Taste buds, in turn, are contained in structures called [[lingual papillae|papillae]]. There are three types of papillae involved in taste: [[fungiform papilla]]e, [[foliate papilla]]e, and [[circumvallate papilla]]e. (The fourth type - [[lingual papilla#filiform papillae|filiform papillae]] do not contain taste buds). Beyond the papillae, taste receptors are also in the [[palate]] and early parts of the [[digestive system]] like the [[larynx]] and upper [[esophagus]].  There are three [[cranial nerve]]s that innervate the tongue; the [[vagus nerve]], [[glossopharyngeal nerve]], and the [[facial nerve]].  The [[glossopharyngeal nerve]] and the [[chorda tympani]] branch of the [[facial nerve]] innervate the TAS1R and TAS2R taste receptors.

In 2010, researchers found bitter receptors in lung tissue, which cause airways to relax when a bitter substance is encountered.  They believe this mechanism is evolutionarily adaptive because it helps clear lung infections, but could also be exploited to treat [[asthma]] and [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Deshpande DA, Wang WC, McIlmoyle EL, Robinett KS, Schillinger RM, An SS, Sham JS, Liggett SB | title = Bitter taste receptors on airway smooth muscle bronchodilate by localized calcium signaling and reverse obstruction | journal = Nature Medicine | volume = 16 | issue = 11 | pages = 1299–304 | date = Nov 2010 | pmid = 20972434 | pmc = 3066567 | doi = 10.1038/nm.2237 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==

[[Taste]] helps to identify [[toxin]]s and maintain [[nutrition]].  Five basic tastes are recognized today: salty, sweet, bitter, sour, and [[umami]].  Salty and sour taste sensations are both detected through [[ion channel]]s.  Sweet, bitter, and umami tastes, however, are detected by way of [[G protein-coupled receptor|G protein-coupled]] taste receptors.&lt;ref name="pmid17444812"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bachmanov AA, Beauchamp GK | title = Taste receptor genes | journal = Annual Review of Nutrition | volume = 27 | issue =  | pages = 389–414 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17444812 | pmc = 2721271 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.nutr.26.061505.111329 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, some agents can function as [[:Category:Taste modifiers|taste modifiers]], as [[miraculin]] or [[curculin]] for sweet or [[sterubin]] to [[:Category:Bitter-masking compounds|mask bitter]].

== Mechanism of action ==

The standard bitter, sweet, or umami taste receptor is a [[G protein-coupled receptor]] with seven transmembrane domains.  Ligand binding at the taste receptors activate [[second messenger]] cascades to depolarize the taste cell. [[Gustducin]] is the most common taste Gα subunit, having a major role in TAS2R bitter taste reception.  Gustducin is a homologue for [[transducin]], a G-protein involved in vision transduction.&lt;ref name="Sainz"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sainz E, Cavenagh MM, LopezJimenez ND, Gutierrez JC, Battey JF, Northup JK, Sullivan SL | title = The G-protein coupling properties of the human sweet and amino acid taste receptors | journal = Developmental Neurobiology | volume = 67 | issue = 7 | pages = 948–59 | date = Jun 2007 | pmid = 17506496 | doi = 10.1002/dneu.20403 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, taste receptors share the use of the TRPM5 ion channel, as well as a phospholipase PLCβ2.&lt;ref name = "pmid12581520"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang Y, Hoon MA, Chandrashekar J, Mueller KL, Cook B, Wu D, Zuker CS, Ryba NJ | title = Coding of sweet, bitter, and umami tastes: different receptor cells sharing similar signaling pathways | journal = Cell | volume = 112 | issue = 3 | pages = 293–301 | date = Feb 2003 | pmid = 12581520 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(03)00071-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
=== Savory or glutamates ===
The [[TAS1R1]]+[[TAS1R3]] heterodimer receptor functions as the savory receptor, responding to L-[[amino acid]] binding, especially L-[[glutamate]].&lt;ref name="pmid11509186"/&gt;  The [[umami]] taste is most frequently associated with the food additive [[monosodium glutamate]] (MSG) and can be enhanced through the binding of [[inosine monophosphate]] (IMP) and [[guanosine monophosphate]] (GMP) molecules.&lt;ref name="Nelson2002"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nelson G, Chandrashekar J, Hoon MA, Feng L, Zhao G, Ryba NJ, Zuker CS | title = An amino-acid taste receptor | journal = Nature | volume = 416 | issue = 6877 | pages = 199–202 | date = Mar 2002 | pmid = 11894099 | doi = 10.1038/nature726 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Delay"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Delay ER, Beaver AJ, Wagner KA, Stapleton JR, Harbaugh JO, Catron KD, Roper SD | title = Taste preference synergy between glutamate receptor agonists and inosine monophosphate in rats | journal = Chemical Senses | volume = 25 | issue = 5 | pages = 507–15 | date = Oct 2000 | pmid = 11015322 | doi = 10.1093/chemse/25.5.507 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  TAS1R1+3 expressing cells are found mostly in the [[fungiform papilla]]e at the tip and edges of the tongue and palate taste receptor cells in the roof of the mouth.&lt;ref name="pmid11509186"/&gt;  These cells are shown to synapse upon the [[chorda tympani]] nerves to send their signals to the brain, although some activation of the [[glossopharyngeal nerve]] has been found.&lt;ref name="Nelson2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Danilova"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Danilova V, Hellekant G | title = Comparison of the responses of the chorda tympani and glossopharyngeal nerves to taste stimuli in C57BL/6J mice | journal = BMC Neuroscience | volume = 4 | pages = 5 | date = Mar 2003 | pmid = 12617752 | pmc = 153500 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2202-4-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sweet ===

The [[TAS1R2]]+[[TAS1R3]] heterodimer receptor functions as the [[sweet]] receptor by binding to a wide variety of [[sugar]]s and [[sugar substitute]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid11509186"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" Li"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Li X, Staszewski L, Xu H, Durick K, Zoller M, Adler E | title = Human receptors for sweet and umami taste | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 99 | issue = 7 | pages = 4692–6 | date = Apr 2002 | pmid = 11917125 | pmc = 123709 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.072090199 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  TAS1R2+3 expressing cells are found in [[circumvallate papilla]]e and [[foliate papilla]]e near the back of the [[tongue]] and [[palate]] taste receptor cells in the roof of the mouth.&lt;ref name="pmid11509186"/&gt;  These cells are shown to [[synapse]] upon the [[chorda tympani]] and [[glossopharyngeal nerve]]s to send their signals to the brain.&lt;ref name="pmid17444812"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Danilova"/&gt; The [[TAS1R3]] homodimer also functions as a sweet receptor in much the same way as TAS1R2+3 but has decreased sensitivity to sweet substances.  Natural sugars are more easily detected by the [[TAS1R3]] receptor than [[sugar substitute]]s.  This may help explain why sugar and artificial sweeteners have different tastes.&lt;ref name="Zhao"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhao GQ, Zhang Y, Hoon MA, Chandrashekar J, Erlenbach I, Ryba NJ, Zuker CS | title = The receptors for mammalian sweet and umami taste | journal = Cell | volume = 115 | issue = 3 | pages = 255–66 | date = Oct 2003 | pmid = 14636554 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(03)00844-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bitter===
The TAS2R proteins function as [[bitter (taste)|bitter]] taste receptors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chandrashekar J, Mueller KL, Hoon MA, Adler E, Feng L, Guo W, Zuker CS, Ryba NJ | title = T2Rs function as bitter taste receptors | journal = Cell | volume = 100 | issue = 6 | pages = 703–11 | date = Mar 2000 | pmid = 10761935 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80706-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are 43 human ''TAS2R'' genes, each of which (excluding the five [[pseudogene]]s) lacks [[intron]]s and codes for a [[GPCR]] protein.&lt;ref name = "pmid17444812"/&gt;  These proteins, as opposed to TAS1R proteins, have short extracellular domains and are located in [[circumvallate papillae]], [[palate]], [[foliate papillae]], and [[epiglottis]] taste buds, with reduced expression in [[fungiform papillae]].&lt;ref name="pmid10761934"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "pmid17444812"/&gt; Though it is certain that multiple TAS2Rs are expressed in one taste receptor cell, it is still debated whether mammals can distinguish between the tastes of different bitter [[ligand]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid10761934"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "pmid17444812"/&gt;  Some overlap must occur, however, as there are far more bitter compounds than there are TAS2R genes.  Common bitter ligands include [[cycloheximide]], [[denatonium]], PROP (6-''n''-propyl-2-[[thiouracil]]), PTC ([[phenylthiocarbamide]]), and β-[[glucoside|glucopyranosides]].&lt;ref name = "pmid17444812"/&gt;

[[Signal transduction]] of bitter stimuli is accomplished via the α-subunit of [[gustducin]].  This G protein subunit activates a taste [[phosphodiesterase]] and decreases [[cyclic nucleotide]] levels.  Further steps in the transduction pathway are still unknown.  The βγ-subunit of gustducin also mediates taste by activating IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ([[inositol triphosphate]]) and DAG ([[diglyceride]]).  These second messengers may open gated ion channels or may cause release of internal [[calcium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Margolskee RF | title = Molecular mechanisms of bitter and sweet taste transduction | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 277 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–4 | date = Jan 2002 | pmid = 11696554 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1074/jbc.R100054200 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though all TAS2Rs are located in gustducin-containing cells, knockout of gustducin does not completely abolish sensitivity to bitter compounds, suggesting a redundant mechanism for bitter tasting&lt;ref name = "pmid12581520"/&gt; (unsurprising given that a bitter taste generally signals the presence of a [[toxin]]).&lt;ref name = "pmid12581520"/&gt;  One proposed mechanism for gustducin-independent bitter tasting is via ion channel interaction by specific bitter ligands, similar to the ion channel interaction which occurs in the tasting of sour and salty stimuli.&lt;ref name = "pmid17444812"/&gt;

One of the best-researched TAS2R proteins is [[TAS2R38]], which contributes to the tasting of both PROP and PTC.  It is also the only taste receptor whose [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]]s are shown to be responsible for differences in taste perception.  Current studies are focused on determining other such taste phenotype-determining polymorphisms.&lt;ref name = "pmid17444812"/&gt;

=== Sour ===

Historically it was thought that the sour taste was produced solely when free [[Hydronium|hydrogen ions]] (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) directly depolarised taste receptors. However, specific receptors for sour taste with other methods of action are now being proposed.  HCN1 and HCN4 ([[HCN channel]]s) were two such proposals; both of these receptors are cyclic nucleotide-gated channels.  The two ion channels suggested to contribute to sour taste are [[ACCN1]] and TASK-1.

[[File:Signal Transaction of Taste; Sour &amp; Salty.svg|thumb|The diagram depicts the signal transduction pathway of the sour or salty taste. Object A is a taste bud, object B is a taste receptor cell within object A, and object C is the neuron attached to object B. I. Part I is the reception of hydrogen ions or sodium ions. 1. If the taste is sour, H+ ions, from an acidic substances, pass through their specific ion channel. Some can go through the Na+ channels. If the taste is salty Na+, sodium, molecules pass through the Na+ channels. Depolarization takes place II. Part II is the transduction pathway of the relay molecules.2. Cation, such as K+, channels are opened. III. Part III is the response of the cell. 3. An influx of Ca+ ions is activated.4. The Ca+ activates neurotransmitters. 5. A signal is sent to the neuron attached to the taste bud.]]

=== Salt ===

Various receptors have also been proposed for salty tastes, along with the possible taste detection of lipids, complex carbohydrates, and water.  Evidence for these receptors is, however, shaky at best, and is often unconvincing in mammal studies.  For example, the proposed [[ENaC]] receptor for sodium detection can only be shown to contribute to sodium taste in ''Drosophilia''.&lt;ref name = "pmid17444812"/&gt;

=== Carbonation ===

An enzyme connected to the sour receptor transmits information about carbonated water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nih.gov/news/health/oct2009/nidcr-15.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703113412/http://www.nih.gov/news/health/oct2009/nidcr-15.htm |archivedate=2015-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fat===
A possible taste receptor for fat, [[CD36]], has been identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Laugerette F, Passilly-Degrace P, Patris B, Niot I, Febbraio M, Montmayeur JP, Besnard P | title = CD36 involvement in orosensory detection of dietary lipids, spontaneous fat preference, and digestive secretions | journal = The Journal of Clinical Investigation | volume = 115 | issue = 11 | pages = 3177–84 | date = Nov 2005 | pmid = 16276419 | doi = 10.1172/JCI25299 | pmc=1265871}}&lt;/ref&gt; CD36 has been localized to the circumvallate and foliate [[lingual papillae|papillae]], which are present in [[taste bud]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Simons PJ, Kummer JA, Luiken JJ, Boon L | title = Apical CD36 immunolocalization in human and porcine taste buds from circumvallate and foliate papillae | journal = Acta Histochemica | volume = 113 | issue = 8 | pages = 839–43 | date = Dec 2011 | pmid = 20950842 | doi = 10.1016/j.acthis.2010.08.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and research has shown that the CD36 receptor binds long chain [[fatty acid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baillie AG, Coburn CT, Abumrad NA | title = Reversible binding of long-chain fatty acids to purified FAT, the adipose CD36 homolog | journal = The Journal of Membrane Biology | volume = 153 | issue = 1 | pages = 75–81 | date = Sep 1996 | pmid = 8694909 | doi=10.1007/s002329900111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Differences in the amount of CD36 [[gene expression|expression]] in human subjects was associated with their ability to taste fats,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pepino MY, Love-Gregory L, Klein S, Abumrad NA | title = The fatty acid translocase gene CD36 and lingual lipase influence oral sensitivity to fat in obese subjects | journal = Journal of Lipid Research | volume = 53 | issue = 3 | pages = 561–6 | date = Mar 2012 | pmid = 22210925 | doi = 10.1194/jlr.M021873 | pmc=3276480}}&lt;/ref&gt; creating a case for the receptor's relationship to fat tasting. Further research into the CD36 receptor could be useful in determining the existence of a true fat-tasting receptor.

[[GPR120]] and [[Free fatty acid receptor 1|GPR40]] have been implicated to respond to oral fat,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = DiPatrizio NV | title = Is fat taste ready for primetime? | journal = Physiology &amp; Behavior | volume = 136 | pages = 145–54 | date = Sep 2014 | pmid = 24631296 | doi = 10.1016/j.physbeh.2014.03.002 | pmc=4162865}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their absence leads to reduced fat preference and reduced neuronal response to orally administered fatty acids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cartoni C, Yasumatsu K, Ohkuri T, Shigemura N, Yoshida R, Godinot N, le Coutre J, Ninomiya Y, Damak S | title = Taste preference for fatty acids is mediated by GPR40 and GPR120 | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 30 | issue = 25 | pages = 8376–82 | date = Jun 2010 | pmid = 20573884 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0496-10.2010 | url = http://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/30/25/8376.full.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[TRPM5]] has been shown to be involved in oral fat response and identified as a possible oral fat receptor, but recent evidence presents it as primarily a downstream actor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mattes RD | title = Accumulating evidence supports a taste component for free fatty acids in humans | journal = Physiology &amp; Behavior | volume = 104 | issue = 4 | pages = 624–31 | date = Sep 2011 | pmid = 21557960 | doi = 10.1016/j.physbeh.2011.05.002 | pmc=3139746}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu P, Shah BP, Croasdell S, Gilbertson TA | title = Transient receptor potential channel type M5 is essential for fat taste | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 31 | issue = 23 | pages = 8634–42 | date = Jun 2011 | pmid = 21653867 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.6273-10.2011 | pmc=3125678}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==

Human bitter taste receptor genes are named TAS2R1 to TAS2R64, with many gaps due to non-existent genes, pseudogenes or proposed genes that have not been annotated to the most recent human genome assembly. Many bitter taste receptor genes also have confusing synonym names with several different gene names referring to the same gene. See table below for full list of human bitter taste receptor genes:

'''''The Four Apostles''''' is a [[panel painting]] by the German [[Renaissance]] master [[Albrecht Dürer]]. It was finished in 1526, and is the last of his large works. It depicts the four apostles larger-than-life-size.  The Bavarian  [[Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria|Elector Maximilian I]] obtained ''The Four Apostles'' in the year 1627 due to pressure on the Nuremberg city fathers.  Since then, the painting has been in [[Munich]] and, despite all the efforts of Nuremberg since 1806, it has not been returned.

==Description==
{{external media | width = 210px | headerimage = [[File:Albrecht Dürer - The Four Holy Men (detail) - WGA07027.jpg|210px]] | align = right | video1 =[http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/durer-four-apostles.html Smarthistory - Dürer's ''The Four Apostles'']}}
When Dürer moved back to [[Nuremberg]] he produced many famous paintings there, including several self-portraits. He gave ''The Four Apostles'' to the town council.  Saints John and Peter appear in the left panel; the figures in the right panel are Saints Mark and Paul. Mark and Paul both hold Bibles, and John and Peter are shown reading from the opening page of John's own Gospel.  At the bottom of each panel, quotations from the Bible are inscribed.&lt;ref name=smart&gt;
{{cite web | title =Dürer's Four Apostles | work = | publisher =Smarthistory at Khan Academy | date = | url =http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/durer-four-apostles.html | accessdate =December 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The apostles are recognizable by their symbols:
*St. John the Evangelist: open book
*St. Peter: keys
*St. Mark: scroll
*St. Paul: sword and closed book

They are also associated with the [[four temperaments]].
*St. John: sanguine
*St. Peter: phlegmatic
*St. Mark: choleric
*St. Paul: melancholy

==Historical context==
''The Four Apostles'' was created during the Reformation, begun in 1517 and having the largest initial impact on Germany. As it was a Protestant belief that icons were contradictory to the Word of God, which was held in the utmost supremacy over Protestant ideas, the Protestant church was not a patron of any sacred art. Therefore, any Protestant artist, like Dürer became, had to commission their own works. Many aspects of the image depicted prove significant in light of the Reformation itself.&lt;ref name=smart/&gt;

The '''Waldalgesheim chariot burial''' ({{lang-de|Waldalgesheimer Fürstengrab}}) was a 4th-century BC [[Celts|Celtic]] princely [[chariot burial]] site in [[Waldalgesheim]], Germany, discovered in 1869.
It has given its name to the "'''Waldalgesheim Style'''" of artifacts of the [[La Tène culture]], a more fluid and confident style of decoration than early [[Celtic art]], with Greek and Etruscan influences. The objects from the burial site were dug up by the farmer who found them on his land. The site was not investigated by archaeologists, and has recently been covered by a housing development.

==Site==

Waldalgesheim is in the middle Rhine valley to the west of the point where the Rhine is joined by the [[Nahe (Rhine)|Nahe]].{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=72}}
The first objects were found there by the plowman Peter Heckert on 18 October 1869 while digging holes to plant beets.
He did not attach any importance to them at first, but a passer-by said they could be historically important.
Eventually a [[Bingen am Rhein|Bingen]] antique dealer bought the pieces for 450 Thaler.
Heckert continued to explore, and eventually found over 30 pieces.{{sfn|"Waldalgesheimer Stil" – Zukunftsgemeinde}}
It was not until the 20th century that it was recognized that the objects dated to the 4th century BC.
Objects from the site including gold rings and a bronze pot are held in the ''[[Rheinisches Landesmuseum Bonn|Rheinischen Landesmuseum]]'' in [[Bonn]].{{sfn|"Waldalgesheimer Stil" – Zukunftsgemeinde}}

After the objects had been found the exact location was forgotten and no effort was made to preserve the site.{{sfn|Schönherr|2006|p=6}}
In 1997 Professor Michael Schönherr tried to organize an investigation of the arable area where the site was presumed to be located, based on fragmentary records.
He received no response from the state archaeologists apart from a request not to publish the location since that could attract looters.
In 2002 it emerged that there were plans to build housing over the plot.{{sfn|Schönherr|2006|p=7}}

==Contents==

The Waldalgesheimer [[chariot burial]] is one of the most important finds from the early Celtic period.{{sfn|"Waldalgesheimer Stil" – Zukunftsgemeinde}}
The grave dates from about 330 BC.{{sfn|Shaw|Jameson|2008|p=142}}
It was a wooden chamber under a barrow mound, with the fragments of a two-wheeled chariot to one side.{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=72}}
The burial dates from the La Tène Iron Age of the Rhineland.{{sfn|Kipfer|2000|p=596}}
From the absence of warrior equipment and presence of jewelry the burial is presumed to be of a woman.{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=45}}
Based on the rich array of grave goods, it is thought to have been that of a Celtic princess.{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=72}}
The objects mostly belong to the La Tène B period, apart from a spouted flagon, which is older.{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=45}}

The funerary offerings include gold ornaments, a bronze flagon, a bucket and bronze plaques with repoussé human figures.{{sfn|Kipfer|2000|p=596}}
The finest of the ornaments were a gold [[torc]], an arm ring and two bracelets.
The torc and the bracelets were decorated with low-relief "Waldalgesheim style" designs.{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=72}}
The style of the objects show influences from eastern France and southern Italy.{{sfn|"Waldalgesheimer Stil" – Zukunftsgemeinde}}
The bronze bucket from [[Campania]] probably dates to the second quarter of the 4th century BC, or soon after.{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=72}}
The artifacts also include the fittings of the chariot. 
The harness and belt attachments have similar styles of ornament to the personal jewelry.{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=72}}
Two similar sheets of bronze, badly damaged, are decorated with repoussé busts ornamented with the new style.{{sfn|Sandars|1995|p=363}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

[[File:Grabfund Waldalgesheim04.jpg|Bronze flagon|thumb]]
The flagon is in Early Style.{{sfn|Collis|2003|loc=PT191}}
It is at least a generation older than the other objects.
The precise engraving indicates that the flagon was made by skilled and specialized smiths.{{sfn|Koch|Minard|2012|p=}}
It is heavily worn on the body, where it would have been held when pouring, showing that it was already old when it was buried.{{sfn|Collis|2003|loc=PT191}}
The flagon has a flattened pedestal base, a pot belly and a tubular spout.
Similar vessels have been found as far apart as [[Eigenbilzen]] in Belgium and [[Dürrnberg]] in Austria, and pottery versions have also been found.
There is a benign human face at the foot of the flagon's handle, and a stylized ram's head at the upper end of the handle.{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=45}}
A horse decorates the lid of the flagon, showing eastern influences. Similarities with a gilt-bronze spouted flagon found at [[Reinheim]] indicate the same artist may have made both, or they may have been made by artists from the same school.{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=47}}

The flagon and the bronze bucket seem to have been more deeply buried than the gold torc and bracelets, which has been taken as possible evidence of two burials at different dates.
However, it is entirely possible that the older objects were heirlooms buried at the same time as the more recent jewelry.{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=47}}

==Waldalgesheim style==

The term "Waldalgesheim Style" was coined by [[Paul Jacobsthal]] (1880–1957) for objects with similar style to those found at Waldalgesheim.
It continues to draw on classical Celtic plant motifs, but marks the highest artistic level of the early Le Tene period with its confident interpretation and execution.
There is disagreement about the origin of the style, with no reason to suppose that it first appeared in the Rhineland. 
For this reason, some archaeologists prefer the term "vegetal" to reflect the emphasis on design derived from plants, and particularly from tendrils.
However, it is not the only style to use such motifs, and it included motifs unrelated to plants.{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=70}}

Metalwork in this style appeared throughout Celtic Europe after about 350 BC.{{sfn|Kipfer|2000|p=596}}
The style shows influence from the Early Style, but generally has been found in different locations apart from the Marne region of the north of France.{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=72}}
Although the Waldalgesheimer objects were found in a late barrow, Waldalgesheimer style objects are more often found in flat cemeteries in southern Germany, Switzerland, Italy and central and southeast Europe.{{sfn|Shaw|Jameson|2008|p=142}}
Some archaeologists see Waldalgesheimer influences in British objects, but this is questionable.{{sfn|Harding|2014|loc=PT208}}
The decorative style is found on different types of objects in different regions: sword sheaths in Italy, [[Fibula (brooch)|fibulae]] in Switzerland and neck rings in France.
This indicates that the style was developed by specialized local craftsmen who adapted new decorative designs from Greek models, as opposed to being spread by traveling craftsmen.{{sfn|Sandars|1995|p=363}}

[[File:Casque d'Agris, musée d'Angoulême, Lamiot 2015 03.JPG|thumb|300px|Ornamentation on the neck guard of the [[Agris Helmet]] ]]
The Waldalgesheimer style is less naturalistic than the Early Style, with plant motifs that characteristically flow into each other in a continuous manner.
The designs subtly incorporate elements of human and animal faces and bodies.{{sfn|Shaw|Jameson|2008|p=142}}
Sometimes the designs incorporate chains of triskels, or curved-sided triangles.{{sfn|Koch|Minard|2012|p=}}
The style includes sinuous tendrils and scrolls and asymmetrical plant spirals.
The low-relief compositions have over-and-under patterns.
Megaw (1970) has called the style "assured irrationality".{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=72}}
Two basic themes are the serpentine scroll and the lyre-motif, often combined with [[palmette]].{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=74}}

The parade armor helmets found in [[Amfreville-sous-les-Monts]] and in [[Agris]] are examples of the style.{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=75}}
The [[Agris Helmet]] is remarkable as an example of high-status Le Tene metalwork which may have been buried as a ritual offering to the underworld spirits. The upper and lower panels of the helmet are decorated with unconnected palmettes, and the central panel with a series of S-curves, again unconnected. The infilling designs on the center panel show similarities to the Waldalgesheim objects, while the ornament of the neck-guard shows a freer experiment with a sinuous composition.{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=76}}
