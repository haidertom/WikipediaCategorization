The '''Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory''' ('''AOML'''), a federal research laboratory, is part of [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]'s (NOAA) [[Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research]] (OAR), located in Miami, Florida. AOML's research spans [[tropical cyclone]] and hurricanes, [[coastal ecosystem]]s, oceans and human health, [[Climatology|climate studies]], global carbon systems, and ocean observations. It is one of seven NOAA Research Laboratories (RLs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = NOAA Research Laboratories |publisher = NOAA Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research |date = |url = http://ci.noaa.gov/NOAAResearchLaboratories.aspx |accessdate = 2014-04-26 |archiveurl = |archivedate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

AOML’s organizational structure consists of an Office of the Director and three scientific research divisions. The Office of the Director oversees the Laboratory’s scientific programs, as well as its financial, administrative, computer, outreach/education, and facility management services. Research programs are augmented by the [[Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies]] (CIMAS), a joint enterprise with the University of Miami’s Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science. CIMAS enables AOML and university scientists to collaborate on research areas of mutual interest and facilitates the participation of students and visiting scientists. 

The Laboratory is a member of a unique community of marine research and educational institutions located on [[Virginia Key]] in Miami, Florida. Approximately $150M per year is invested in marine science and education among the University of Miami's [[Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science]], NOAA's Southeast Fisheries Science Center, the [[Miami Seaquarium]], the [[Maritime and Science Technology Academy]] (MAST Academy).

==History==
The deeper roots of AOML can be traced to the oceanographic investigations of the U.S. Coast Survey beginning in the mid-19th century under the direction of Professor [[Alexander Dallas Bache]], great grandson of Benjamin Franklin and a preeminent U.S. science figure of the age. In subsequent decades, the urgency of charting coastal waters in support of growing commerce, a task increased by the acquisition of Alaska, Hawaii, and other island territories, came to require all the resources of the Coast Survey.
 
The modern era can be considered to have begun during the 1960s. In early 1966, an Institute for Oceanography was created, primarily from research groups of the then [[U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey]] of the Environmental Science Services Administration (ESSA, forerunner of NOAA). The following year the Institute was relocated to Miami for a variety of reasons, including the presence already in Miami of meteorological research groups of ESSA dedicated to hurricane research, and air-sea interaction was a hot topic of the time in weather research.
 
All of these groups were reorganized as the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratories (AOML) and by 1973 took occupancy in the new laboratory constructed on Virginia Key.
 
Emphasis at AOML continues to be on making and interpreting observations of the ocean and atmosphere from ships, buoys, and research aircraft. The motivation and objectives of our research is continually evolving, however. In the beginning, study of the geology, geophysics, and sedimentation of the sea floor was the largest activity of the Laboratory, but it has diminished to a smaller part of ecosystem research. Research in response to concerns for marine environmental quality and large-scale physics and chemistry of the oceans related to climate variation and global change have supplemented the original themes. Research into the nature and mechanisms of hurricanes has been and is also expected to continue as a major theme in view of the importance of this natural hazard to the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States.
 
New projects include expansion of the use of satellite and locally operated remote sensing techniques to enhance the coverage and detail of observations. Outreach via electronic communication is enabling AOML to  serve a larger constituency with access to oceanographic and meteorological observations.

==Research==
AOML conducts mission oriented scientific research that seeks to understand the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics and processes of the ocean and atmosphere, both separately and as a coupled system. The Laboratory’s research themes (oceans and climate, coastal ecosystems, and hurricanes and [[tropical meteorology]]) employ a cross-disciplinary approach, conducted through collaborative interactions with national and international research and environmental forecasting institutions. More information about AOML's research can be found at [http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/research/ http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/research].

===Oceans and its link to extreme weather and climate===
AOML carries out interdisciplinary scientific investigations of the physics of ocean currents and water properties, and on the role of the ocean in climate, extreme weather events, and ecosystems. The tools used to carry out these studies range from sensors on deep ocean moorings to satellite-based instruments to measurements made on research and commercial shipping vessels and autonomous vehicles, and include data analysis and numerical modeling as well as theoretical approaches  (http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/phod).
 
AOML manages, leads, or participate in the design, implementation, maintenance, and enhancement of several key components of the global ocean observing system and, with these and other data, conducts research in several areas including:
* [[Meridional Overturning Circulation]]
* Tropical Atlantic variability
* Oceans and extreme weather (hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts, etc.)
* [[Physical oceanography]]
* Oceans and ecosystems
* Global carbon cycle
* Research to Applications and Operations
* Development of oceanographic instrumentation

===Coastal ecosystems===
Coastal and regional ecosystem research has been a focus of AOML activities for more than two decades. Current interdisciplinary field efforts include physical, biological, and chemical studies supporting the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration (SFER) effort and the underlying health of this ecosystem to the regional Intra-Americas Sea program, as well as the status and health of coral reef ecosystems worldwide.

Coastal Ecosystem related research projects:
* Global carbon cycle
* [[Climate change]]
* Coastal pollution
* Fishing effects
* Physical oceanography of [[coral reef]]s
* Coral health and monitoring program
* Petroleum and oil spill research
* Marine and Estuarine Goal Setting for South Florida (MARES) Project

===Hurricanes and tropical meteorology===
Tropical meteorology research at AOML is focused on advancing the understanding and prediction of hurricanes and other tropical weather. Scientists conduct their research utilizing a combination of models, theories, and observations, with particular emphasis on data obtained with research aircraft in the inner core of tropical cyclones and their surrounding environment.

Hurricanes and tropical meteorology related research projects:
* [[Tropical cyclone track forecasting|Track forecasting]]
* Hurricane intensity change
* [[Climate variation]]
* Hurricane impacts
* Administrative projects

The '''Biblical Archaeology Society''' is a non-denominational organization that supports and promotes [[biblical archaeology]]. It publishes ''[[Biblical Archaeology Review]]''. Its past publications included ''[[Bible Review]]'' (1985–2005) and ''Archaeology Odyssey'' (1998–2006). The Biblical Archaeology Society also publishes books about biblical archaeology aimed at a general readership. The Society has, for more than 30 years, run seminars and tours offering an opportunity to learn directly from world-renowned archaeologists and scholars. It also produces videos (DVD) and CDs on archaeology and biblical archaeology.

The society was founded by [[Hershel Shanks]] in 1975 and he served as editor for 42 years, retiring at the end of 2017. Robert R. Cargill was selected to replace Shanks as editor of the Society and associated publications.

The Biblical Archaeology Society has been at the center of several controversies. 

In 1991, the Biblical Archaeology Society published ''A Facsimile Edition of the Dead Sea Scrolls'', making the [[Dead Sea scrolls]] available to scholars around the world. Previously, access to the scrolls was limited to a small team of specialists who had been invited to translate them.

At a 2002 press conference co-hosted with the [[Discovery Channel]], the Biblical Archaeology Society announced the existence of the [[James Ossuary]]. Some critics have alleged that the ossuary, which may have once held the remains of [[James, brother of Jesus|James]], the brother of [[Jesus]], is a forgery. During the forgery trial, which lasted for several years, Shanks remained a staunch defender of the ossuary. On March 14, 2012, the defendants were acquitted of all charges of forgery because the ossuary's authenticity could not be determined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Lorenzi, Rossella | title = Trial Does Not Settle 'Brother of Jesus' Controversy | work = Discovery News | date = March 14, 2012 | url = http://news.discovery.com/history/archaeology/james-ossuary-120314.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Clef Diagram.png|thumb|Diagram of treble, alto and bass clefs with identically sounding musical notes aligned vertically|alt=|440x440px]]
A '''clef''' (from [[French language|French]]: ''[[wikt:en:clé#French|clé]]'' "key") is a [[musical notation|musical symbol]] used to indicate the [[pitch (music)|pitch]] of written [[Musical note|notes]].&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Strictly speaking, the clef does not indicate the pitch of the notes, but their names; the actual pitch may vary according to the [[tuning system]] or [[Pitch (music)#History of pitch standards in Western music|pitch standard]] employed.&lt;/ref&gt; Placed on a [[staff (music)|stave]], it indicates the name and pitch of the notes on one of the lines. This line serves as a reference point by which the names of the notes on any other line or space of the stave may be determined.&lt;!--See the Octave Clefs section below for a proof of this statement--&gt;

There are three types of clef used in modern music notation: ''F'', ''C'', and ''G''. Each type of clef assigns its reference note to a line (and in rare cases, a space) depending on its placement on the stave.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;The G and F clefs are used as treble and bass clefs, respectively, in the vast majority of modern music.&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

Once one of these clefs has been placed on one of the lines of the stave, the other lines and spaces are read in relation to it.

The use of three different clefs makes it possible to write music for all instruments and voices, regardless of differences in [[tessitura]]. Because the modern [[Staff (music)|stave]] has only five lines, it is not possible to represent all pitches playable by the orchestra with only one clef, even with the use of [[ledger line]]s. The use of different clefs for various instruments and voices allows each part to be written comfortably on the stave with a minimum of ledger lines. To this end, the G-clef is used for high parts, the C-clef for middle parts, and the F-clef for low parts—with the notable exception of [[transposing instruments|transposing parts]], which are written at a pitch different from their sound, often even in a different octave.

== Placement on the stave ==
To facilitate writing for different tessituras, any of the clefs may theoretically be placed on any line of the stave. The further down on the stave a clef is positioned, the higher the tessitura; conversely, the higher the clef is positioned, the lower the tessitura.

Since there are five lines on the stave, and three clefs, it might seem that there would be fifteen possible clefs. Six of these, however, are redundant clefs (for example, a G-clef on the third line would be the same as a C-clef on the first line). That leaves nine possible ''distinct'' clefs, all of which have been used historically: the G-clef on the two bottom lines, the F-clef on the three top lines, and the C-clef on any line of the stave except the topmost, earning the name of "movable C-clef".&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;The C-clef on the topmost line is redundant, because it is equivalent to the F-clef on the third line; both options have been used.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of these clefs has a different name based on the tessitura for which it is best suited.
&lt;!--image displayed wider than 400px for clarity--&gt;
[[File:All clefs.svg|center|640px|The nine possible clefs]]

In modern music, only four clefs are used regularly: [[Clef#Treble clef|treble clef]], [[#bass clef|bass clef]], [[#alto clef|alto clef]], and [[#tenor clef|tenor clef]]. Of these, the treble and bass clefs are by far the most common. The tenor clef is used for the upper register of several instruments that usually use bass clef (including [[cello]], [[bassoon]], and [[trombone]]), while the alto is only used by the [[viola]] and a few other instruments.

[[File:common clefs.svg|center|212px|Common clefs]]

== Individual clefs ==
Here follows a complete list of the clefs, along with a list of instruments and voice parts notated with them. Each clef is shown in its proper position on the stave, followed by its reference note.†&lt;ref name=dagger group=lower-alpha&gt;A [[Dagger (typography)|dagger (†)]] after the name of a clef indicates that the clef is no longer in common use.&lt;/ref&gt;

Where the G-clef is placed on the second line of the stave, it is called the [[Treble (sound)|treble]] clef. This is the most common clef used today, the first clef that those studying music generally learn,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greer|first=Amy|date=2003|title=In Praise of Those Grass-Eating Cows|url=|journal=American Music Teacher|volume= 53| issue = 1|pages=22–25|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the only G-clef still in use. For this reason, the terms G-clef and treble clef are often seen as synonymous. The treble clef was historically used to mark a treble, or pre-pubescent, voice part.

Among the instruments that use treble clef are the [[violin]], [[flute]], [[oboe]], [[bagpipe]], [[cor anglais]], all [[clarinet]]s, all [[saxophone]]s, [[French horn|horn]], [[trumpet]], [[cornet]], [[vibraphone]], [[xylophone]], [[mandolin]], [[recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]]; it is also used for the [[guitar]], which sounds an octave lower than written, as well as the [[euphonium]] and [[baritone horn]], both of which sound a major ninth lower.  Treble clef is the upper stave of the [[grand stave]] used for [[harp]] and [[keyboard instrument]]s. It is also sometimes used, along with tenor clef, for the highest notes played by bass-clef instruments such as the [[cello]], [[double bass]] (which sounds an octave lower), [[bassoon]], and [[trombone]]. The [[viola]] also sometimes uses treble clef for very high notes. Treble clef is used for the [[soprano]], [[mezzo-soprano]], [[alto]], [[contralto]] and [[tenor]] voices. The tenor voice sounds an octave lower, and is often written using an octave clef (see below) or double-treble clef.

†&lt;ref name=dagger group=lower-alpha/&gt; In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, a special clef was used for violin music, particularly that published in France. For this reason it is known as the French clef or French violin clef, although it was more commonly used for flute music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dolmetsch Online – Music Theory Online – Other Clefs|url=http://www.dolmetsch.com/musictheory14.htm|website=www.dolmetsch.com|accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The G-clef is placed on the first line of the stave and is identical to the bass clef transposed up two octaves.

When the F-clef is placed on the fourth line, it is called the bass ({{IPAc-en|b|eɪ|s}} {{respell|BAYSS}}) clef.  This is the only F-clef used today so that the terms "F-clef" and "bass clef" are often regarded as synonymous.

This clef is used for the cello, euphonium, double bass, [[bass guitar]], bassoon, [[contrabassoon]], trombone, [[baritone horn]], [[tuba]], and [[timpani]]. It is also used for the lowest notes of the [[French horn|horn]], and for the [[baritone]] and [[bass (vocal range)|bass]] voices. [[Tenor]] voice is notated in bass clef when the tenor and bass are written on the same stave.  Bass clef is the bottom clef in the [[grand stave]] for [[harp]] and [[keyboard instrument]]s. The contrabassoon, double bass, and [[electric bass]] sound an octave lower than the written pitch; no notation is usually made of this fact, but some composers/publishers will place an "8" beneath the clef for these instruments on the conductor's full score to differentiate from instruments that naturally sound within the clef (see "Octave clefs" below).

This clef was used for the left hand of keyboard music (particularly in France; see [[Bauyn manuscript]]) as well as the baritone part in vocal music.

The baritone clef has the less common variant as a C clef placed on the 5th line which is exactly equivalent (see [[Clef#Baritone clef† 2|below]]).

This clef is currently used for the viola, the [[viola da gamba]], the [[Types of trombones#Alto trombone|alto trombone]], and the [[mandola]]. It is also associated with the [[countertenor]] voice and therefore called the counter-tenor (or countertenor) clef.&lt;ref&gt;Moore 1876, 176; Dolmetsch Organisation 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; A vestige of this survives in [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s use of the clef for the [[cor anglais]], as in his symphonies.

Where the C-clef is placed on the fourth line of the stave, it is called the tenor clef.

This clef is used for the upper ranges of the bassoon, cello, euphonium, double bass, and trombone. These instruments use bass clef for their low- to mid-ranges; treble clef is also used for their upper extremes. Where used for the double bass, the sound is an octave lower than the written pitch. The [[tenor violin]] parts were also drafted in this clef (see e.g. [[Giovanni Battista Vitali]]'s Op.&amp;nbsp;11). Formerly, it was used by the tenor part in [[vocal music]] but its use has been largely supplanted{{why|date=January 2018}} either with an octave version of the treble clef where written alone or the bass clef where combined on one stave with the bass part.

The mezzo-soprano clef is very rarely used in modern contexts. It was traditionally used for mezzo-soprano voices in operatic roles, notably by composer [[Claudio Monteverdi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Curtis|first=Alan|date=1989-04-01|title=La Poppea Impasticciata or, Who Wrote the Music to La Poppea Impasticciata (1643)?|url=http://jams.ucpress.edu/content/42/1/23|journal=Journal of the American Musicological Society|language=en|volume=42|issue=1|pages=23–54|doi=10.2307/831417|issn=0003-0139}}&lt;/ref&gt; This clef was also used for certain flute parts during renaissance, especially when doubling vocal lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thomas|first=Bernard|date=1975|title=The Renaissance Flute|url=|journal=Early Music|volume= 3| issue =  1|pages=2–10|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other clefs ==

=== Octave clefs ===
[[File:Tenorclefs.png|thumb|left|200px|Three types of suboctave treble clef showing middle C]]
[[File:Diatonic scale on C transposing clef.png|thumb|Diatonic scale on C, suboctave clef. {{audio|Diatonic scale on C bass clef.ogg|Play}}]]
[[File:Diatonic scale on C sopranino clef.png|thumb|Diatonic scale on C, "sopranino" clef. {{audio|Diatonic scale on C sopranino clef.ogg|Play}} (this is one octave higher than the treble clef without an 8)]]

Starting in the 18th-century treble clef has been used for [[transposing instrument]]s that sound an octave lower, such as the [[guitar]]; it has also been used for the [[tenor]] voice. To avoid ambiguity, modified clefs are sometimes used, especially in the context of [[choir|choral]] writing; of those shown, the C clef on the third space, easily confused with the tenor clef, is the rarest.

This is most often found in tenor parts in [[SATB]] settings, in which a treble clef is written with the numeral 8 below it, indicating that the pitches sound an octave below the written value. As the true tenor clef has fallen into disuse in vocal writings, this "octave-dropped" treble clef is often called the tenor clef. The same clef is sometimes used for the [[octave mandolin]]. In some scores, the same concept is construed by using a double clef—two G-clefs overlapping one another.

Tenor banjo is commonly notated in treble clef. However, notation varies between the written pitch sounding an octave lower (as in guitar music and called octave pitch in most tenor banjo methods) and music sounding at the written pitch (called actual pitch).  An attempt has been made to use a treble clef with a diagonal line through the upper half of the clef to indicate octave pitch, but this is not always used.

At the other end of the spectrum, treble clefs with an ''8'' positioned above the clef may be used for the [[piccolo]], [[penny whistle]], [[Recorder (musical instrument)#Sheet music notation|soprano and sopranino recorder]], and other high woodwind parts. A treble clef with a ''15'' above (sounding two octaves above the standard treble clef) is used for the [[garklein recorder|garklein (sopranissimo) recorder]], whose lowest note is two octaves above [[middle C]].

The F clef can also be notated with an octave marker. The F clef notated to sound an octave lower is used for contrabass instruments such as the double bass and contrabassoon. The F clef notated to sound an octave higher is used for the bass recorder. However, both of these are extremely rare (and, in fact, the countertenor clef is largely intended to be humorous as with the works of [[P.D.Q. Bach]]). In Italian scores up to [[Gioachino Rossini]]'s [[William Tell Overture|Overture to ''William Tell'']], the cor anglais was written in bass clef an octave lower than sounding.&lt;ref&gt;Del Mar 1981, 143.&lt;/ref&gt; The unmodified bass clef is so common that performers of instruments and voice parts whose ranges lie below the stave simply learn the number of ledger lines for each note through common use, and if a line's true notes lie significantly above the bass clef the composer or publisher will often simply write the part in either the treble clef or notated an octave down under an ''8va'' bracket.

Use of octave-marked clefs appears to have increased as computers have become more important in musical transcription. Performers will normally know the right octave to use with or without the octave marking. However, the appropriate use of octave marking in [[scorewriter|score editing software]] ensures that music files (such as [[MIDI file]]s) generate tones in their proper octaves.

=== Neutral clef ===
[[File:Music-neutralclef.png|95px|left]]
[[File:Characteristic rock drum pattern.png|thumb|Simple quadruple [[drum beat|drum pattern]] on a rock [[drum kit]]. {{Audio|Simple duple drum pattern.ogg|Play}}]]

The ''neutral'' or ''percussion'' clef is not a clef in the same sense that the F, C, and G clefs are. It is simply a convention that indicates that the lines and spaces of the stave are each assigned to a [[percussion instrument]] with no precise pitch. With the exception of some common drum-kit and marching percussion layouts, the keying of lines and spaces to instruments is not standardised, so a legend or indications above the stave are necessary to indicate what is to be played. Percussion instruments with identifiable pitches do not use the neutral clef, and timpani (notated in bass clef) and [[mallet percussion]] (noted in treble clef or on a [[grand stave]]) are usually notated on different staves than unpitched percussion.

Staves with a neutral clef do not always have five lines. Commonly, percussion staves only have one line, although other configurations can be used.

The neutral clef is sometimes used where non-percussion instruments play non-pitched extended techniques, such as hitting the body of a violin, violoncello or acoustic guitar, or where a vocal choir is instructed to clap, stomp, or snap, but more often the rhythms are written with X marks in the instrument's normal stave with a comment placed above as to the appropriate rhythmic action.

=== Tablature ===
[[File:Tablature.svg|left|60px]]
[[File:Diatonic scale on C tablature clef.png|thumb|Diatonic scale on C, guitar tablature and stave notation (suboctave is assumed). {{audio|Diatonic scale on C tablature.ogg|Play}}]]

For guitars and other fretted instruments, it is possible to notate [[tablature]] in place of ordinary notes. In this case, a TAB-sign is often written instead of a clef. The number of lines of the stave is not necessarily five: one line is used for each string of the instrument (so, for standard six-stringed guitars, six lines would be used, four lines for the traditional bass guitar). Numbers on the lines show on which fret the string should be played. This Tab-sign, like the Percussion clef, is not a clef in the true sense, but rather a symbol employed instead of a clef.

== History ==
Originally, instead of a special clef symbol, the reference line of the stave was simply labeled with the name of the note it was intended to bear: ''F'' and ''C'' and, more rarely, ''G''. These were the most often-used 'clefs', or ''litterae clavis'' (key-letters), in Gregorian chant notation. Over time the shapes of these letters became stylised, leading to their current versions.

Many other clefs were used, particularly in the early period of chant notation, including most of the notes from the low ''Γ'' (''gamma'', the note written today on the bottom line of the bass clef) up to the G above middle C, written with a small letter ''g'', and including two forms of lowercase ''b'' (for the note just below middle C): round for B{{Music|flat}}, and square for B{{Music|natural}}. In order of frequency of use, these clefs were: ''F'', ''c'', ''f'', ''C'', ''D'', ''a'', ''g'', ''e'', ''Γ'', ''B'', and the round and square ''b''.&lt;ref&gt;Smits van Wasberghe 1951, 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:G-Schluessel.png|thumb|Early forms of the G clef—the third combines the G and D clefs vertically]]
In the [[Polyphonic Era|polyphonic period]] up to 1600, unusual clefs were occasionally used for parts with extremely high or low written tessituras. For very low bass parts, the Γ clef is found on the middle, fourth, or fifth lines of the stave (e.g., in [[Pierre de La Rue]]’s Requiem and in a mid-16th-century dance book published by the Hessen brothers); for very high parts, the high-D clef (''d''), and the even higher ''ff'' clef (e.g., in the ''[[Mulliner Book]]'') were used to represent the notes written on the fourth and top lines of the treble clef, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Hiley 2001; P. and B. Hessen 1555.&lt;/ref&gt;

Varying shapes of different clefs persisted until very recent times. The F-clef was, until as late as the 1980s in some cases (such as hymnals), or in British and French publications, written like this: [[File:Oldbassclef.svg|45px]]

In printed music from the 16th and 17th centuries, the C clef often assumed a ladder-like form, in which the two horizontal rungs surround the stave line indicated as C: [[File:Mensural c clef 06.svg|40px]]; this form survived in some printed editions ([[:File:Far Above Cayuga's Waters 1906.png|see this example]], written in [[TTBB|four-part men's harmony]] and positioned to make it equivalent to an octave G clef) into the 20th century.

The C-clef was formerly written in a more angular way, sometimes still used, or an, even more, simplified ''K''-shape, when writing the clef by hand: [[File:Old C-clef.png|45px]]

In modern Gregorian chant notation, the C clef is written (on a four-line stave) in the form [[File:C clef neume.gif|30px]] and the F clef as [[File:F clef neume.gif|30px]]

The flourish at the top of the G-clef probably derives from a cursive ''S'' for "sol", the name for "G" in [[solfege]].&lt;ref&gt;Kidson 1908, 443-44.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AdesteFidelesLilyPhil.png|thumb|300px|right|Vocal music can be contracted into two staves, using the treble and bass clefs.]]

C clefs (along with G, F, Γ, D, and A clefs) were formerly used to notate vocal music. Nominally, the soprano voice parts were written in first- or second-line C clef (''soprano clef'' or ''mezzo-soprano clef'') or second-line G clef (''treble clef''), the alto or tenor voices in third-line C clef (''alto clef''), the tenor voice in fourth-line C clef (''tenor clef'') and the bass voice in third-, fourth- or fifth-line F clef (''baritone'', ''bass'', or ''sub-bass clef'').

Until the 19th century, the most common arrangement for vocal music used the following clefs:&lt;!--The immediately preceding paragraph says otherwise. Neither is sourced, so the first one to come up with a verifying citation wins?--&gt; &lt;!-- this one does appear in most sources prior: manuscripts (ex. Bach's or Telemann's), printed scores (ex. mostly everything from Breitkopf und Härtel up to that point), even occasionally keyboard music! --&gt;

*Soprano = soprano clef (first-line C clef)
*Alto = alto clef (third-line C clef)
*Tenor = tenor clef (fourth-line C clef)
*Bass = bass clef (fourth-line F clef)

In more modern publications, four-part [[harmony]] on parallel staves is usually written more simply as:
*Soprano = treble clef (second-line G clef)
*Alto = treble clef
*Tenor = treble clef with an ''8'' below ''or'' a double treble clef. Many pieces, particularly those from before the 21st century, use an unaltered treble clef, with the expectation the tenors will still sing an octave lower than notated.
*Bass = bass clef (fourth-line F clef)
This may be reduced to two staves, the soprano/alto stave with a treble clef, and tenor/bass stave marked with the bass clef.

== Further uses ==
Clef combinations played a role in the modal system toward the end of the 16th century, and it has been suggested certain clef combinations in the polyphonic music of 16th-century vocal polyphony are reserved for authentic (odd-numbered) modes, and others for plagal (even-numbered) modes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Powers|first=Harold S.|title=Tonal Types and Modal Categories in Renaissance Polyphony|journal=Journal of the American Musicological Society|year=1981|volume=34|pages=428–470|doi=10.1525/jams.1981.34.3.03a00030}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kurtzman|first=J.G.|title=Tones, Modes, Clefs, and Pitch in Roman Cyclic Magnificats of the 16th Century|journal=Early Music|year=1994|volume=22|pages=641–664|doi=10.1093/earlyj/xxii.4.641}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the precise implications have been the subject of much scholarly debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hermelink|first=S.|title=Zur Chiavettenfrage|journal=Musikwissenschaftlichen Kongress|year=1956|pages=264–271|location=Vienna}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=A.|title=Über modus und Transposition um 1600|journal=Basler Jahrbuch für historische Musikpraxis|year=1982|pages=9–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parrott|first=Andrew|title=Transposition in Monteverdi's Vespers of 1610: an "Aberration" Defended|journal=Early Music|year=1984|volume=7|pages=490–516|doi=10.1093/earlyj/12.4.490}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wiering|first=F.|title=The Waning of the Modal Ages: Polyphonic Modality in Italy, 1542–1619|journal=Ruggiero Giovannelli: Palestrina and Velletri|year=1992|pages=389–419}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Music can be transposed at sight if a different clef is mentally substituted for the written one. For example, to play an A-clarinet part, a B{{music|flat}}-clarinet player may mentally substitute tenor clef for the written treble clef.  Concert-pitch music in bass clef can be read on an E{{music|flat}} instrument as if it were in treble clef. (Notes will not always sound in the correct octave.) The written key signature must always be adjusted to the proper key for the instrument being played.

'''Codevelopment''' is a trend of thought and a development strategy in [[development studies]]
which considers [[Human migration|migrants]] to be a developing factor for their countries of origin.

Although it is widely accepted that it was [[France|French]] scholar [[Sami Naïr]] who first coined the word codevelopment, it is believed this phenomenon has existed alongside migrations since they exist. Traditionally, immigrants (especially those who migrate for economic reasons) have, collectively or individually, supported their communities of origin.

In 1997 Sami Naïr, while directing the Interministerial Mission on Migration/Codevelopment, defined this last concept as ''a proposal for integrating immigration and development in a way that migration fluxes will benefit both the country of origin and the country of destination. This is, a consensual relationship between two countries that will allow migration to the country of destiny not to imply an equivalent loss in the country of origin''.

Adherents to this model believe that it fosters mutual collaboration among countries in a way that traditional and hierarchical north-south development focus did not.
In this context, immigrant initiatives enrich the countries of origin both from a cultural and a [[human resources]] perspective. Their condition as transnational citizens would allow them a better understanding of the needs of both the communities of origin and destination.
For this reason, their participation in projects involving members of their communities, in both “their” countries would be more effective, as priorities and needs would be correctly identified.
On the other hand, this participation would also work as an integrating force in the destination countries, as they would be perceived as an enriching factor by the public opinion and institutions.

== Codevelopment and migration control ==

In countries receiving immigration, codevelopment has been implemented by the institutions in a different way. Since they were first implemented in France, codevelopment initiatives in Europe have been frequently linked to control of the migration fluxes, often promoting the return of immigrants.

At a European level, codevelopment was first mentioned during the [[Tampere Summit]] held in October 1999, when the [[European Council]] defined 5 guidelines for the new European migration policy aimed at a common space of ''"Liberty, Security and Justice".''
Anyhow, critics consider that Tampere quickly shifted towards a [[Fortress Europe]] mentality, limiting [[development aid]] to those countries willing to implement migration control measures and accepting repatriations.

An example of this tendency may be found in the imbalance between de 23 million euro budget that the [[European Union|EU]] plans on investing in the [[Schengen Information System]] and the [[Visa Information System]] (aimed at a further immigrant identification and control) with the 3 million euro budget (4 million in its second year) granted to codevelopment projects.

== Codevelopment in Spain ==

Since the late nineties, codevelopment has been the subject of postgraduate studies, specialist courses, discussions and forums among multiple stakeholders, as well as calls for project grants by some local and regional administrations, beginning with the Municipality of Madrid.  These authorities quickly became aware of the local impact of the presence of new immigrant communities, the importance of the links that bind them with their communities of origin, and the desirability of relating them in any future action to support the policies of cooperation. Codevelopment policies had a much stronger presence and development in the regional and local levels.

At the state level, in accordance with Tampere Summit on Migration, the GRECO Plan on migration management (Programa Global de Regulación y Coordinación de la Extranjería y la Inmigración 2000-2004), was launched by the Interior Ministry in 2001. This Plan devoted an important space for “joint development”, in line with the policies of Tampere and the French government. GRECO insisted on technical and educational cooperation, the voluntary return of migrants, the channelling of migrants’ remittances to development projects, and finally, on the cooperation with those governments that were ready to accept the returned illegal migrants, as well as to control the exit of their citizens with destination Spain. However, codevelopment was not even mentioned as a policy line in the Immigration law passed in 2000, and did not receive proper funding within the GRECO’s framework.

Since ending 2004, codevelopment policies have been open to discussion, including the contents, limits, and plans. Two state agencies claimed their space in codevelopment actions: the State Secretary for International Cooperation, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the brand new General Directorate of Immigrants’ Integration, at the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.

===Codevelopment policy ===

During 2005 there has been progress in the search for a consensus on competences and actors. A codevelopment line was mainstreamed in the Master Plans on Development Cooperation, and two years later, also in the new Integration Plan, called Strategic Plan on Citizenship and Integration 2007-2010, which was finally implemented in 2007, by the Ministry of Labour and Migration.

Regional and local authorities soon adopted this win/win approach and consequently launched several codevelopment guidelines within their Integration Plans and Development Cooperation Strategies. Ending 2009, most of the Spanish Regions (Comunidades Autónomas) had considered codevelopment and had set up budget lines both for migrants' associations and Development NGOs. Graciela Malgesini argues that codevelopment and migrants' remittances partly redirect the decentralized cooperation funds to their countries of origin.

===Current definitions of codevelopment ===

In the last ten years, academic research on codevelopment increased, as a result of the strong immigration process experienced by the Spanish society from 2000 onwards (which represented nearly 80% of Spain’s demographic growth). Many universities decided to open up new learning courses on the matter, following the steps of the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid. Several doctoral thesis are currently being carried out, focusing diverse aspects of codevelopment, including the impact of migration and remittances in the sending countries, mainly Ecuador, Colombia and Morocco. Migrants living in Spain remitted nearly EURO 10 thousands millions, in 2007 (while the overall Spanish OAD summed only half of this amount).

According to Graciela Malgesini, spontaneous codevelopment could be defined as the win/win effect, the linkage between migration and development, which generates mostly positive impacts on both the society of origin of immigrants, and the host society. This definition presumes the role of immigrants as actors and vectors of development, in "both sides", and the understanding of the relations between host countries (North) and sending countries (South) in a horizontal way. Codevelopment is directly related to Transnationalism.

Carlos Gimenez pinpointed other two characteristics of codevelopment: (1) The multiplicity of stakeholders (a network of participants that surpasses both quantitatively and qualitatively the traditional agents in the traditional development cooperation projects, as it includes authorities, social organizations, trade unions, universities, training institutes, businesses and immigrant associations). (2) Transnational citizenship (immigrants acting in codevelopment activities, embedded in a transnational dynamic, are also transnational citizens, to the extent that they have a dual presence. This dual space of belonging, in turn, encourages decision making, influences on the economic, political and social development, and allows the formation of a separate identity, based on two geographical areas, the country of origin and the country of destination).

===Codevelopment in practice ===

Transnationalism and codevelopment are spreading.In Latin America, covedelopment is a relatively new idea, but it has been embraced by grassroots organizations. For example, on November 25, 2010, FAMIGRANTES—the Federation of associations gathering migrants' family members in South America—gathered in their 4th Meeting on Migration and Codevelopment, in Rosario, Argentina. They stated that the codevelopment approach was the best way of understanding the contribution that their relatives were making both in the reception countries and in their homelands (www.famigrantes.org and www.famisur.org). At the same time, more than 100 migrants' associations launched FEDACOD (Federation of Associations for Codevelopment) in Valencia, Spain, on September 24, 2010 (www.fedacod.com).

'''Computer simulation''' is the reproduction of the behavior of a system using a [[computer]] to simulate the outcomes of a [[mathematical model]] associated with said system. Since they allow to check the reliability of chosen mathematical models, computer simulations have become a useful tool for the mathematical modeling of many natural systems in [[physics]] ([[computational physics]]), [[astrophysics]], [[climatology]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]] and [[manufacturing]], human systems in [[economics]], [[psychology]], [[social science]], [[health care]] and [[engineering]]. Simulation of a system is represented as the running of the system's model. It can be used to explore and gain new insights into new [[technology]] and to estimate the performance of systems too complex for [[analytical solution]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Computer simulations are realized by running [[computer program]]s that can be either small, running almost instantly on small devices, or large-scale programs that run for hours or days on network-based groups of computers. The scale of events being simulated by computer simulations has far exceeded anything possible (or perhaps even imaginable) using traditional paper-and-pencil mathematical modeling. Over 10 years ago, a desert-battle simulation of one force invading another involved the modeling of 66,239 tanks, trucks and other vehicles on simulated terrain around [[Kuwait]], using multiple supercomputers in the [[United States Department of Defense|DoD]] High Performance Computer Modernization Program.&lt;ref name="JPLsim"&gt;" [http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/releases/97/military.html "Researchers stage largest Military Simulation ever"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080122123958/http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/releases/97/military.html |date=2008-01-22 }}, [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]], [[Caltech]], December 1997,&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the computational cost of simulation, [[computer experiment]]s are used to perform inference such as [[uncertainty quantification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author1=Santner, Thomas J| author2=Williams, Brian J| author3=Notz, William I| title=The design and analysis of computer experiments| year=2003| publisher=Springer Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Simulation versus model ==
A [[computer model]] is the algorithms and equations used to capture the behavior of the system being modeled. By contrast, computer simulation is the actual running of the program that contains these equations or algorithms. Simulation, therefore, is the process of running a model. Thus one would not "build a simulation"; instead, one would "build a model", and then either "run the model" or equivalently "run a simulation".

== History ==
Computer simulation developed hand-in-hand with the rapid growth of the computer, following its first large-scale deployment during the [[Manhattan Project]] in [[World War II]] to model the process of [[nuclear weapon|nuclear detonation]]. It was a simulation of 12 [[hard spheres]] using a [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo algorithm]]. Computer simulation is often used as an adjunct to, or substitute for, modeling systems for which simple [[closed-form solution|closed form analytic solutions]] are not possible. There are many types of computer simulations; their common feature is the attempt to generate a sample of representative scenarios for a model in which a complete enumeration of all possible states of the model would be prohibitive or impossible.

== Data preparation ==
The external data requirements of simulations and models vary widely. For some, the input might be just a few numbers (for example, simulation of a waveform of AC electricity on a wire), while others might require terabytes of information (such as weather and climate models).

Input sources also vary widely:
* Sensors and other physical devices connected to the model;
* Control surfaces used to direct the progress of the simulation in some way;
* Current or historical data entered by hand;
* Values extracted as a by-product from other processes;
* Values output for the purpose by other simulations, models, or processes.

Lastly, the time at which data is available varies:
* "invariant" data is often built into the model code, either because the value is truly invariant (e.g., the value of π) or because the designers consider the value to be invariant for all cases of interest;
* data can be entered into the simulation when it starts up, for example by reading one or more files, or by reading data from a [[preprocessor (CAE)|preprocessor]];
* data can be provided during the simulation run, for example by a sensor network.

Because of this variety, and because diverse simulation systems have many common elements, there are a large number of specialized [[simulation language]]s. The best-known may be [[Simula]] (sometimes called Simula-67, after the year 1967 when it was proposed). There are now many others.

Systems that accept data from external sources must be very careful in knowing what they are receiving. While it is easy for computers to read in values from text or binary files, what is much harder is knowing what the [[accuracy]] (compared to [[Graphic display resolutions|measurement resolution]] and [[Accuracy and precision|precision]]) of the values are. Often they are expressed as "error bars", a minimum and maximum deviation from the value range within which the true value (is expected to) lie. Because digital computer mathematics is not perfect, rounding and truncation errors multiply this error, so it is useful to perform an "error analysis"&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{cite book |title=An Introduction to Error Analysis: The Study of Uncertainties in Physical Measurements |author=John Robert Taylor |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=giFQcZub80oC&amp;pg=PA128 |pages=128–129 |isbn=0-935702-75-X |year=1999 |publisher=University Science Books |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316103343/http://books.google.com/books?id=giFQcZub80oC&amp;pg=PA128 |archivedate=2015-03-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to confirm that values output by the simulation will still be usefully accurate.

Even small errors in the original data can accumulate into substantial error later in the simulation. While all computer analysis is subject to the "GIGO" ([[garbage in, garbage out]]) restriction, this is especially true of digital simulation. Indeed, observation of this inherent, cumulative error in digital systems was the main catalyst for the development of [[chaos theory]].

== Types ==
Computer models can be classified according to several independent pairs of attributes, including:
* [[stochastic process|Stochastic]] or [[Deterministic algorithm|deterministic]] (and as a special case of deterministic, chaotic) – see external links below for examples of stochastic vs. deterministic simulations
* Steady-state or dynamic
* [[Continuous function|Continuous]] or [[discrete mathematics|discrete]] (and as an important special case of discrete, [[Discrete event simulation|discrete event]] or DE models)
* [[Dynamic simulation|Dynamic system simulation]], e.g. electric systems, hydraulic systems or multi-body mechanical systems (described primarely by DAE:s) or dynamics simulation of field problems, e.g. CFD of FEM simulations (described by PDE:s).
* Local or [[distributed computing|distributed]].

Another way of categorizing models is to look at the underlying data structures. For time-stepped simulations, there are two main classes:
* Simulations which store their data in regular grids and require only next-neighbor access are called [[stencil code]]s. Many [[Computational fluid dynamics|CFD]] applications belong to this category.
* If the underlying graph is not a regular grid, the model may belong to the [[meshfree method]] class.

Equations define the relationships between elements of the modeled system and attempt to find a state in which the system is in equilibrium. Such models are often used in simulating physical systems, as a simpler modeling case before dynamic simulation is attempted.
*Dynamic simulations model changes in a system in response to (usually changing) input signals.
*''[[stochastic process|Stochastic]]'' models use ''[[random number generator]]s'' to model chance or random events;
*A ''[[discrete event simulation]]'' (DES) manages events in time. Most computer, logic-test and fault-tree simulations are of this type. In this type of simulation, the simulator maintains a queue of events sorted by the simulated time they should occur. The simulator reads the queue and triggers new events as each event is processed. It is not important to execute the simulation in real time. It is often more important to be able to access the data produced by the simulation and to discover logic defects in the design or the sequence of events.
*A ''continuous dynamic simulation'' performs numerical solution of [[Differential algebraic equation|differential-algebraic equations]] or [[differential equations]] (either [[partial differential equation|partial]] or [[ordinary differential equation|ordinary]]). Periodically, the simulation program solves all the equations and uses the numbers to change the state and output of the simulation. Applications include flight simulators, [[construction and management simulation games]], [[chemical process modeling]], and simulations of [[electrical circuit]]s. Originally, these kinds of simulations were actually implemented on [[analog computer]]s, where the differential equations could be represented directly by various electrical components such as [[op-amp]]s. By the late 1980s, however, most "analog" simulations were run on conventional [[digital computer]]s that [[emulator|emulate]] the behavior of an analog computer.
*A special type of discrete simulation that does not rely on a model with an underlying equation, but can nonetheless be represented formally, is [[agent-based model|agent-based simulation]]. In agent-based simulation, the individual entities (such as molecules, cells, trees or consumers) in the model are represented directly (rather than by their density or concentration) and possess an internal state and set of behaviors or rules that determine how the agent's state is updated from one time-step to the next.
*[[Distributed computing|Distributed]] models run on a network of interconnected computers, possibly through the [[Internet]]. Simulations dispersed across multiple host computers like this are often referred to as "distributed simulations". There are several standards for distributed simulation, including [[Aggregate Level Simulation Protocol]] (ALSP), [[Distributed Interactive Simulation]] (DIS), the [[High Level Architecture (simulation)]] (HLA) and the [[Test and Training Enabling Architecture]] (TENA).

== Visualization ==
Formerly, the output data from a computer simulation was sometimes presented in a table or a matrix showing how data were affected by numerous changes in the simulation [[Parameter (computer programming)|parameters]]. The use of the matrix format was related to traditional use of the matrix concept in [[mathematical model]]s. However, psychologists and others noted that humans could quickly perceive trends by looking at graphs or even moving-images or motion-pictures generated from the data, as displayed by [[computer generated imagery|computer-generated-imagery]] (CGI) animation. Although observers could not necessarily read out numbers or quote math formulas, from observing a moving weather chart they might be able to predict events (and "see that rain was headed their way") much faster than by scanning tables of rain-cloud [[coordinate]]s. Such intense graphical displays, which transcended the world of numbers and formulae, sometimes also led to output that lacked a coordinate grid or omitted timestamps, as if straying too far from numeric data displays. Today, [[weather forecasting]] models tend to balance the view of moving rain/snow clouds against a map that uses numeric coordinates and numeric timestamps of events.

Similarly, CGI computer simulations of [[CAT scan]]s can simulate how a [[brain cancer|tumor]] might shrink or change during an extended period of medical treatment, presenting the passage of time as a spinning view of the visible human head, as the tumor changes.

Other applications of CGI computer simulations are being developed to graphically display large amounts of data, in motion, as changes occur during a simulation run.

== Computer simulation in science ==
[[File:Osmosis computer simulation.jpg|250px|thumb|Computer simulation of the process of [[osmosis]] ]]

Generic examples of types of computer simulations in science, which are derived from an underlying mathematical description:
* a numerical simulation of [[differential equation]]s that cannot be solved analytically, theories that involve continuous systems such as phenomena in [[physical cosmology]], [[fluid dynamics]] (e.g., [[climate model]]s, [[roadway noise]] models, [[roadway air dispersion model]]s), [[continuum mechanics]] and [[chemical kinetics]] fall into this category.
* a [[stochastic]] simulation, typically used for discrete systems where events occur [[probabilistic]]ally and which cannot be described directly with differential equations (this is a ''discrete'' simulation in the above sense). Phenomena in this category include [[genetic drift]], [[biochemistry|biochemical]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gupta|first=Ankur|last2=Rawlings|first2=James B.|date=April 2014|title=Comparison of Parameter Estimation Methods in Stochastic Chemical Kinetic Models: Examples in Systems Biology|journal=AIChE Journal |volume=60|issue=4|pages=1253–1268|doi=10.1002/aic.14409|issn=0001-1541|pmc=4946376|pmid=27429455}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[gene regulatory network]]s with small numbers of molecules. (see also: [[Monte Carlo method]]).
* multiparticle simulation of the response of nanomaterials at multiple scales to an applied force for the purpose of modeling their thermoelastic and thermodynamic properties. Techniques used for such simulations are [[Molecular dynamics]], [[Molecular mechanics]], [[Monte Carlo method]], and [[Multiscale Green's function]].

Specific examples of computer simulations follow:
* statistical simulations based upon an agglomeration of a large number of input profiles, such as the forecasting of equilibrium [[temperature]] of [[receiving waters]], allowing the gamut of [[meteorological]] data to be input for a specific locale. This technique was developed for [[thermal pollution]] forecasting.
* agent based simulation has been used effectively in [[ecology]], where it is often called "individual based modeling" and is used in situations for which individual variability in the agents cannot be neglected, such as [[population dynamics]] of [[salmon]] and [[trout]] (most purely mathematical models assume all trout behave identically).
* time stepped dynamic model. In hydrology there are several such [[hydrology transport model]]s such as the [[SWMM]] and [[DSSAM Model]]s developed by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] for river water quality forecasting.
* computer simulations have also been used to formally model theories of human cognition and performance, e.g., [[ACT-R]].
* computer simulation using [[molecular modeling]] for [[drug discovery]].&lt;ref&gt;Atanasov AG, Waltenberger B, Pferschy-Wenzig EM, Linder T, Wawrosch C, Uhrin P, Temml V, Wang L, Schwaiger S, Heiss EH, Rollinger JM, Schuster D, Breuss JM, Bochkov V, Mihovilovic MD, Kopp B, Bauer R, Dirsch VM, Stuppner H. {{doi|10.1016/j.biotechadv.2015.08.001}} Discovery and resupply of pharmacologically active plant-derived natural products: A review.] Biotechnol Adv. 2015, {{PMID|26281720}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Computational fluid dynamics]] simulations are used to simulate the behaviour of flowing air, water and other fluids. One-, two- and three-dimensional models are used. A one-dimensional model might simulate the effects of [[water hammer]] in a pipe. A two-dimensional model might be used to simulate the drag forces on the cross-section of an aeroplane wing. A three-dimensional simulation might estimate the heating and cooling requirements of a large building.
* An understanding of statistical thermodynamic molecular theory is fundamental to the appreciation of molecular solutions. Development of the [[Potential Distribution Theorem]] (PDT) allows this complex subject to be simplified to down-to-earth presentations of molecular theory.

Notable, and sometimes controversial, computer simulations used in science include: [[Donella Meadows]]' [[World3]] used in the ''[[Limits to Growth]]'', [[James Lovelock|James Lovelock's]] [[Daisyworld]] and Thomas Ray's [[Tierra (computer simulation)|Tierra]].

In social sciences, computer simulation is an integral component of the five angles of analysis fostered by the data percolation methodology,&lt;ref&gt;Mesly, Olivier 
(2015). ''Creating Models in Psychological Research.'' United States: Springer Psychology: 126 pages. {{ISBN|978-3-319-15752-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; which also includes qualitative and quantitative methods, reviews of the literature (including scholarly), and interviews with experts, and which forms an extension of data triangulation.

=== Simulation environments for physics and engineering ===
[[Graphical environment]]s to design simulations have been developed. Special care was taken to handle events (situations in which the simulation equations are not valid and have to be changed). The open project [[Open Source Physics]] was started to develop reusable libraries for simulations in [[Java (programming language)|Java]], together with [[EJS|Easy Java Simulations]], a complete graphical environment that generates code based on these libraries.

=== Simulation environments for linguistics ===

International Journal of Computational Linguistics &amp; Chinese Language Processing; 22:2 2017.12 pp. 73-86&lt;/ref&gt; is a simulator of Taiwanese tone sandhi acquisition.
In practical, the method using linguistic theory to implement the Taiwanese tone group parser is a way to apply [[knowledge engineering]] technique to build the experiment environment of computer simulation for language acquisition. A work-in-process version of artificial tone group parser that includes a [[knowledge base]] and an executable program file for Microsoft Windows system (XP/Win7) can be [http://vikon.myweb.hinet.net/ttgpe.htm download] for evaluation.

== Computer simulation in practical contexts ==
Computer simulations are used in a wide variety of practical contexts, such as:
* analysis of [[air pollutant]] dispersion using [[atmospheric dispersion modeling]]
* design of complex systems such as [[aircraft]] and also [[logistics]] systems.
* design of [[noise barrier]]s to effect roadway [[noise mitigation]]
* modeling of [[Application performance management|application performance]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wescott | first = Bob | title = The Every Computer Performance Book, Chapter 7: Modeling Computer Performance | publisher = [[CreateSpace]] | date = 2013 | isbn = 1482657759 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150726045408/http://www.amazon.com/Every-Computer-Performance-Book-Computers/dp/1482657759 |url=https://www.amazon.com/Every-Computer-Performance-Book-Computers/dp/1482657759 | archivedate = 2015-07-26 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Atmospheric model|weather forecasting]]
* [[risk management|forecasting of risk]]
* simulation of electrical circuits
* [[Power system simulation]]
* simulation of other computers is [[Emulator|emulation]].

See a more detailed article on [[Traffic Simulation|Simulation in Transportation]].
* modeling car crashes to test safety mechanisms in new vehicle models.
* [[Theoretical production ecology|crop-soil systems]] in agriculture, via dedicated software frameworks (e.g. [[Biophysical Models|BioMA]], OMS3, APSIM)

The reliability and the trust people put in computer simulations depends on the [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of the simulation [[model (abstract)|model]], therefore [[verification and validation]] are of crucial importance in the development of computer simulations. Another important aspect of computer simulations is that of reproducibility of the results, meaning that a simulation model should not provide a different answer for each execution. Although this might seem obvious, this is a special point of attention in [[stochastic simulation]]s, where random numbers should actually be semi-random numbers. An exception to reproducibility are human-in-the-loop simulations such as flight simulations and [[computer games]]. Here a human is part of the simulation and thus influences the outcome in a way that is hard, if not impossible, to reproduce exactly.

[[Vehicle]] manufacturers make use of computer simulation to test safety features in new designs. By building a copy of the car in a physics simulation environment, they can save the hundreds of thousands of dollars that would otherwise be required to build and test a unique prototype. Engineers can step through the simulation milliseconds at a time to determine the exact stresses being put upon each section of the prototype.&lt;ref&gt;Baase, Sara. A Gift of Fire: Social, Legal, and Ethical Issues for Computing and the Internet. 3. Upper Saddle River: Prentice Hall, 2007. Pages 363–364. {{ISBN|0-13-600848-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Computer graphics]] can be used to display the results of a computer simulation. [[Animations]] can be used to experience a simulation in real-time, e.g., in [[Training Simulation|training simulations]]. In some cases animations may also be useful in faster than real-time or even slower than real-time modes. For example, faster than real-time animations can be useful in visualizing the buildup of queues in the simulation of humans evacuating a building. Furthermore, simulation results are often aggregated into static images using various ways of [[scientific visualization]].

In debugging, simulating a program execution under test (rather than executing natively) can detect far more errors than the hardware itself can detect and, at the same time, log useful debugging information such as instruction trace, memory alterations and instruction counts. This technique can also detect [[buffer overflow]] and similar "hard to detect" errors as well as produce performance information and [[Performance tuning|tuning]] data.

== Pitfalls ==
Although sometimes ignored in computer simulations, it is very important to perform a [[sensitivity analysis]] to ensure that the accuracy of the results is properly understood. For example, the probabilistic risk analysis of factors determining the success of an oilfield exploration program involves combining samples from a variety of statistical distributions using the [[Monte Carlo method]]. If, for instance, one of the key parameters (e.g., the net ratio of oil-bearing strata) is known to only one significant figure, then the result of the simulation might not be more precise than one significant figure, although it might (misleadingly) be presented as having four significant figures.

=== Model calibration techniques ===
The following three steps should be used to produce accurate simulation models: calibration, verification, and validation. Computer simulations are good at portraying and comparing theoretical scenarios, but in order to accurately model actual case studies they have to match what is actually happening today. A base model should be created and calibrated so that it matches the area being studied. The calibrated model should then be verified to ensure that the model is operating as expected based on the inputs. Once the model has been verified, the final step is to validate the model by comparing the outputs to historical data from the study area. This can be done by using statistical techniques and ensuring an adequate R-squared value. Unless these techniques are employed, the simulation model created will produce inaccurate results and not be a useful prediction tool.

Model calibration is achieved by adjusting any available parameters in order to adjust how the model operates and simulates the process. For example, in traffic simulation, typical parameters include look-ahead distance, car-following sensitivity, discharge headway, and start-up lost time. These parameters influence driver behavior such as when and how long it takes a driver to change lanes, how much distance a driver leaves between his car and the car in front of it, and how quickly a driver starts to accelerate through an intersection. Adjusting these parameters has a direct effect on the amount of traffic volume that can traverse through the modeled roadway network by making the drivers more or less aggressive. These are examples of calibration parameters that can be fine-tuned to match characteristics observed in the field at the study location. Most traffic models have typical default values but they may need to be adjusted to better match the driver behavior at the specific location being studied.

Model verification is achieved by obtaining output data from the model and comparing them to what is expected from the input data. For example, in traffic simulation, traffic volume can be verified to ensure that actual volume throughput in the model is reasonably close to traffic volumes input into the model. Ten percent is a typical threshold used in traffic simulation to determine if output volumes are reasonably close to input volumes. Simulation models handle model inputs in different ways so traffic that enters the network, for example, may or may not reach its desired destination. Additionally, traffic that wants to enter the network may not be able to, if congestion exists. This is why model verification is a very important part of the modeling process.

The final step is to validate the model by comparing the results with what is expected based on historical data from the study area. Ideally, the model should produce similar results to what has happened historically. This is typically verified by nothing more than quoting the R-squared statistic from the fit. This statistic measures the fraction of variability that is accounted for by the model. A high R-squared value does not necessarily mean the model fits the data well. Another tool used to validate models is graphical residual analysis. If model output values drastically differ from historical values, it probably means there is an error in the model. Before using the model as a base to produce additional models, it is important to verify it for different scenarios to ensure that each one is accurate. If the outputs do not reasonably match historic values during the validation process, the model should be reviewed and updated to produce results more in line with expectations. It is an iterative process that helps to produce more realistic models.

Validating traffic simulation models requires comparing traffic estimated by the model to observed traffic on the roadway and transit systems. Initial comparisons are for trip interchanges between quadrants, sectors, or other large areas of interest. The next step is to compare traffic estimated by the models to traffic counts, including transit ridership, crossing contrived barriers in the study area. These are typically called screenlines, cutlines, and cordon lines and may be imaginary or actual physical barriers. Cordon lines surround particular areas such as a city's central business district or other major activity centers. Transit ridership estimates are commonly validated by comparing them to actual patronage crossing cordon lines around the central business district.

Three sources of error can cause weak correlation during calibration: input error, model error, and parameter error. In general, input error and parameter error can be adjusted easily by the user. Model error however is caused by the methodology used in the model and may not be as easy to fix. Simulation models are typically built using several different modeling theories that can produce conflicting results. Some models are more generalized while others are more detailed. If model error occurs as a result, in may be necessary to adjust the model methodology to make results more consistent.

In order to produce good models that can be used to produce realistic results, these are the necessary steps that need to be taken in order to ensure that simulation models are functioning properly. Simulation models can be used as a tool to verify engineering theories, but they are only valid if calibrated properly. Once satisfactory estimates of the parameters for all models have been obtained, the models must be checked to assure that they adequately perform the intended functions. The validation process establishes the credibility of the model by demonstrating its ability to replicate actual traffic patterns. The importance of model validation underscores the need for careful planning, thoroughness and accuracy of the input data collection program that has this purpose. Efforts should be made to ensure collected data is consistent with expected values. For example, in traffic analysis it is typical for a traffic engineer to perform a site visit to verify traffic counts and become familiar with traffic patterns in the area. The resulting models and forecasts will be no better than the data used for model estimation and validation.

The ''' conservation and restoration of vinyl discs''' refers to the preventive measures taken to defend against damage and slow degradation, and to maintain [[fidelity]] of singles, 12" singles, EP, LP in  45 or 33⅓ rpm [[Gramophone record|disc]] [[Sound recording and reproduction|recordings]]. LPs are most often in the 12” format, although very early [[gramophone record|vinyl]] recordings were 10”. Vinyl LP preservation is generally considered separate from conservation, which refers to the repair and stabilization of individual discs. Commonly practiced in major sound archives and research [[libraries]] that house large collections of [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]] recordings, it is also frequently followed by [[audiophiles]] and home record collectors. Because [[Vinyl group|vinyl]]—a virtually unbreakable light plastic made up of polyvinyl chloride acetate copolymer, or [[PVC]]—is considered the most stable of analog recording media, it is seen as less a concern for deterioration than earlier sound recordings made from more fragile materials such as acetate, vulcanite, or [[shellac]]. This hardly means that vinyl recordings are infallible, however, and research—both expert and evidential—has shown that the way in which discs are handled and cared for can have a profound effect on their [[longevity]]. Though some [[Gramophone record|45s]] (7”s) are also made from vinyl, many of them are actually [[polystyrene]]—a more fragile medium that is prone to fracturing from internal stress.&lt;ref&gt;McWilliams, Jerry. ''The Preservation and Restoration of Sound Recordings,'' page 42. Nashville: American Association for State and Local History, 1979. '', page 42&lt;/ref&gt; Still, many of the recommendations for the care of vinyl LPs can be applied to 45s.

== Historical development and standards ==

In 1959—roughly a decade after [[gramophone record|vinyl]] LPs first became widely available to [[consumer]]s—the [[Library of Congress]] published ''Preservation of Sound Recordings'' (A.G. Pickett and M.M. Lemcoe), the first and most extensive investigation of the deterioration of grooved discs and [[magnetic tape]]. Funded by a grant from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], the purpose of the investigation was to establish suitable guidelines for the storage and preservation of [[sound recordings]] for libraries. Conducted at the Southwest Research Institute of San Antonio, the study involved subjecting sound recordings to a series of lab tests, from accelerated aging to fungal exposure. Though considered the definitive study in the field, the chemical makeup of [[plastics]] and how they perform under stress was the primary focus of the report, whereas playback deterioration—a significant concern to sound archivists and record collectors—was excluded from the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;Pickett, A. G., and M. M. Lemcoe. ''Preservation and Storage of Sound Recordings,'' page iv. Washington: Library of Congress, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Preservation and Restoration of Sound Recordings'' (Jerry McWilliams), published in 1979 by the American Association of State and Local History, did include information about disc wear through playback, and is still a practical source of information on sound recording preservation. A comprehensive manual based on reports gathered from library professionals, sound [[archivists]], audio engineers, and other experts, it included information on such topics as disc damage from frequency of use, stylus wear, and inferior or improperly adjusted equipment.

In 1986 the Association of Recorded Sound Collections (ARSC) Associated Archives (AAA) Committee received a grant from the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] to conduct an in-depth study in order to identify the problems of preservation and access for sound recordings. Their 860-page report, titled ''Audio Preservation, A Planning Study'' was published in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Swartzburg, Susan G. ''Preserving Library Materials: A Manual," page 201. N.J.: Scarecrow Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the shift from [[Analog signal|analog]] to [[digital recording]], research in the preservation of sound recordings has been in serious decline. Gerald L. Gibson, the head of the Motion Picture, Broadcasting, and Recorded Sound Division of the [[Library of Congress]] expressed his concern on this issue in 1991, by referencing an investigation on the effects of fire on sound and audiovisual recordings as some of the only new research being done on the topic, stating, “Comparatively little is known about the preservation, conservation, aging problems, or properties of sound recordings…virtually no independent work is going on in these areas.” (Gerald L. Gibson, Head of the Motion Picture, Broadcasting, and Recorded Sound Division of the Library of Congress, 1991).&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, Gerald D. “Preservation and Conservation of Sound Recordings,” page 27 in ''Conserving and Preserving Materials in Nonbook Formats''. Henderson, Kathryn L. and William T., editors. Urbana-Champaign, Ill.: University of Illinois, Graduate School of Library and Information Science, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though guidelines and recommendations for the care, handling, and proper storage of vinyl LPs are available from such resources as The Library of Congress and the [[National Library of Canada]], to this date there are no nationally agreed upon standards for audio preservation.&lt;ref name=arl&gt;Association of Research Libraries, [http://www.arl.org/bm~doc/stsrfinal.pdf Letter to National Recording Preservation Board], Library of Congress&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2007, a five-page letter was sent to the National Recording Preservation Board at the Library of Congress on behalf of the Association of Research Libraries (ARL) in support of a study on the current state of recorded sound preservation in the United States, stating “the lack of agreed upon standards and commonly accepted best practices presents a major barrier to effective audio preservation.”(Prudence S. Adler, Associate Executive Director and Karla L. Hahn, Director, Office of Scholarly Communication, Association of Research Libraries, Jan. 2007)&lt;ref name=arl /&gt;

== Recommendations ==

Though recommendations for LP preservation differ among professionals, the majority are in agreement on some basic [[guidelines]]: discs need to be kept clean, stored in such a way to prevent distortion, and maintained in a stable, climate-controlled environment. Routine [[Preventive maintenance|maintenance]] of [[Phonograph|turntable]] equipment including regular inspection of the weight, tracking, and condition of the [[stylus]] is also advised.

=== Cleaning ===

Though proper methods are debated, [[Parts cleaning|cleaning]] is extremely important in maintaining the [[fidelity]] of LPs. As Gibson stated, “As with most things in the field, there is very little certainty regarding cleaning. What is known is based on trial-and-error, not upon controlled, scientific study…however, one thing is certain: playing a dirty recording, regardless of its format, is one of the most damaging things you can do to it.”(Gerald L. Gibson, Head of the Motion Picture, Broadcasting, and Recorded Sound Division of the Library of Congress, 1991)&lt;ref name="Gibson, Gerald D. 1991"&gt;Gibson, Gerald D. “Preservation and Conservation of Sound Recordings,” page 32 in ''Conserving and Preserving Materials in Nonbook Formats''. Henderson, Kathryn L. and William T., editors. Urbana-Champaign, Ill.: University of Illinois, Graduate School of Library and Information Science, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is imperative that LPs be kept free from foreign matter deposits. [[Oils]] from fingerprints, adhesives, and soot are damaging, as are air [[pollutants]] like cigarette smoke. Even [[Petroleum|grease]] from cooking can deposit itself on LPs. Probably the number one contributor to damage, however, is ordinary household [[dust]]. Dust can become embedded permanently into the disc’s grooves, causing distortion of the transmitting signal, ticks, pops, and inferior sound quality. Vinyl discs can become so dirty and scratched that they are virtually unlistenable.

It is recommended that discs be cleaned before—and after—each playback, carbon-fibre brushes are quite effective. Records should be cleaned in a circular motion, in the direction of the grooves. [[Distilled water]] (not tap water as it will leave behind mineral deposits) and a soft, lint-free cloth is a common method of cleaning. Another method is to clean the LP on the turntable with a disc cleaning brush (the Discwasher system is frequently recommended by the audio press).&lt;ref&gt;McWilliams, Jerry. ''The Preservation and Restoration of Sound Recordings,'' page 60. Nashville: American Association for State and Local History, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; A simple "cleaning bath" device called the Spin Clean gives good results,{{according to whom|date=November 2015}}  and there are also vacuum machines on the market such as the Nitty Gritty, Keith Monks, Clearaudio, and VPI, which are recommended for more a thorough cleaning.&lt;ref name="Gibson, Gerald D. 1991"/&gt; In recent years, ultrasonic cleaning machines from manufacturers such as Klaudio (Korea) and Audio Desk Systeme (Germany) have also been used with great success. The effectiveness of the ultrasonic machines coupled with their premium price tags (both $4,000 US in January 2015) has opened the door for companies to offer professional ultrasonic cleaning at an affordable cost of just a few dollars per record.&lt;ref&gt;Stereophile review of Audio Desk Systeme Vinyl Cleaner [http://www.stereophile.com/content/audio-desk-systeme-vinyl-cleaner] Websites for professional ultrasonic cleaning service  [http://originalsvinyl.com][http://recordgenie.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Another cleaning product recently released called Record Revirginizer uses a polymer that is applied to record surface then left to dry, the polymer is then peeled from the surface taking the microscopic contaminants with it.&lt;ref&gt;Queensland university student restores retro records [http://newsmaker.com.au/news/2741] Official Website [http://recordrevirginizer.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Though in the past, using [[alcohol]] on vinyl LPs was considered safe, experts now caution against it unless absolutely necessary, as alcohol threatens the loss of the plasticizer or stabilizer.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, Gerald D. “Preservation and Conservation of Sound Recordings,” page 33 in ''Conserving and Preserving Materials in Nonbook Formats''. Henderson, Kathryn L. and William T., editors. Urbana-Champaign, Ill.: University of Illinois, Graduate School of Library and Information Science, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; As vinyl is often prone to electrostatic charges that cause dust and debris to be attracted to its surface, anti-static products can be used if needed.

Other recommendations for the care, handling, and storage of LPs include the following:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/preserv/care/record.html Cylinder, Disc, and Tape Care in A Nutshell], Library of Congress&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collectionscanada.ca/6/28/s28-10190e.html The Preservation of Recorded Sound Materials], National Library of Canada&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Handling ===
* When possible, use clean, white, lint-free gloves for handling.
* Handle by edge and label areas only, with the third and fourth fingers balancing the label and the thumb supporting the rim.
* Remove from jacket by bowing the jacket open and holding it against the body and letting the LP with its inner sleeve slide out gently (following the same method for removing the inner sleeve).
* Do not expose to air or light unnecessarily. Return LPs to their jackets immediately after playback.

=== Storing ===
* Store exactly vertically to prevent [[wikt:warp|warp]]ing. Spacers are recommended for every four to six inches.
* Store LPs with other LPs. Avoid mixing with other sizes such as 10″ and 7″ discs. Never use bookends.
* Store on metal shelves (as opposed to wood, which expands and contracts).
* Do not allow LPs to hang over the edge of shelves.
* Remove shrink wrap from dust jackets immediately after acquiring.
* Use polyethylene inner sleeves. Never use PVC sleeves as their chemical makeup is too close to vinyl and may cause imprints or fuse to the LP.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, Gerald D. “Preservation and Conservation of Sound Recordings,” page 34 in ''Conserving and Preserving Materials in Nonbook Formats''. Henderson, Kathryn L. and William T., editors. Urbana-Champaign, Ill.: University of Illinois, Graduate School of Library and Information Science, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Replace paper sleeves as paper deteriorates, leaving oil and paper residue.
* Store in-use LPs at a temperature of {{convert|65|to|70|F|C}}. Those in long-term storage should be kept at {{convert|45|to|50|F|C}}. Though [[relative humidity]] (RH) is considered less an issue for vinyl than other recorded media,&lt;ref&gt;McWilliams, Jerry. ''The Preservation and Restoration of Sound Recordings,'' page 42. Nashville: American Association for State and Local History, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; it is recommended that LPs be stored at 45 to 50% RH.

=== Playback equipment ===

* The stylus tip should be kept clean at all times. A soft, camelhair brush is recommended with a drop of Discwasher solution. Only clean from back to front.
* The stylus should be periodically inspected as it is gradually worn by use. Never play LPs with a worn stylus.
* Maintain proper tracking force. If too high, the stylus will bear down on the groove walls of the LP; if too low, the stylus will bounce in the groove.&lt;ref&gt;McWilliams, Jerry. ''The Preservation and Restoration of Sound Recordings,'' page 74. Nashville: American Association for State and Local History, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reformatting ===

As vinyl recordings are known to degrade after repeated playback, preservation copying is recommended for archival purposes. This is especially true for rare recordings or those that have special value. A general guideline is to digitise the recording using the appropriate stylus, tracking weight, equalisation curve and other playback parameters and use high-quality analogue-to-digital converters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iasa-web.org/tc04/audio-preservation ''Guidelines on the Production and Preservation of Digital Audio Objects'' (IASA TC04)]  International Association of Sound and Audiovisual Archives 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; A service copy of the recording can then be created (on CD or other format) from the preservation master. A second option is to create three copies, the second copy acting as a duplicating master and the third for public use.

'''Critical ethnography''' applies a [[critical theory]] based approach to [[ethnography]]. It  focuses on the implicit values expressed within ethnographic studies and, therefore, on the unacknowledged biases that may result from such implicit values.&lt;ref name="sagepub"&gt;Soyini Madison, D. (2005). Critical ethnography: method, ethics, and performance. Retrieved from http://www.sagepub.com/upm-data/4957_Madison_I_Proof_Chapter_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It has been called critical theory in practice.&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;Thomas, J. (1993). Doing critical ethnography. Newbury Park, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;  of critical theory, this approach seeks to determine symbolic mechanisms, to extract ideology from action, and to understand the cognition and behaviour of research subjects within historical, cultural, and social frameworks.

Critical ethnography incorporates reflexive inquiry into its methodology. Researchers employing this approach position themselves as being intrinsically linked to those being studied and thus inseparable from their context.&lt;ref name="Simon"&gt;Simon, R. I., &amp; Dippo, D. (1986). On critical ethnographic work. Anthropology &amp; Education Quarterly, 17(4), 195-202.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to speaking on behalf of subjects, critical ethnographers will also attempt to recognize and articulate their own perspective as a means of acknowledging the biases that their own limitations, histories, and institutional standpoints bear on their work.&lt;ref name="sagepub" /&gt; Further, critical ethnography is inherently political as well as pedagogical in its approach.&lt;ref name="Simon" /&gt; There is no attempt to be purely detached and scientifically objective in reporting and analysis. In contrast to conventional ethnography which describes what is, critical ethnography also asks what could be in order to disrupt tacit power relationships and perceived social inequalities.&lt;ref name="Thomas" /&gt;

==History==
Critical ethnography stems from both [[anthropology]] and the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago school]] of sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, J. (2003). Musings on critical ethnography, meanings, and symbolic violence. In R.P. Clair (Ed.), ''Expressions of Ethnography''. Albany, NY: SUNY Press, pp. 45-54.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[movements for civil rights]] of the 1960s and 1970s some ethnographers became more politically active and experimented in various ways to incorporate emancipatory political projects into their research.&lt;ref&gt;Noblit, G. W., Flores, S. Y., &amp; Murillo, E. G. (2004). Postcritical ethnography: An introduction. Cress, NJ: Hampton Press.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, some ethnographers with political agendas for change chose to conduct fieldwork in unconventional environments such as modern workplaces that were not necessarily considered exotic, as previous anthropologists had typically done.&lt;ref name="sagepub" /&gt; Other ethnographers consciously attempted to conduct research on so-called deviant or suppressed groups from outside the paradigm of hegemonic cultural positionings to provide new avenues for dissent and dialogue on societal transformation.&lt;ref name="Simon" /&gt;

A '''cyanide''' is a [[chemical compound]] that contains the group C≡N. This group, known as the '''cyano group''', consists of a [[carbon]] atom [[triple-bond]]ed to a [[nitrogen]] atom.&lt;ref&gt;[[IUPAC Gold Book]] [http://goldbook.iupac.org/C01486.html ''cyanides'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In inorganic cyanides, the cyanide group is present as the anion CN&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;.  For the [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] such as [[sodium cyanide]] and [[potassium cyanide]], these compounds are highly toxic.&lt;ref name="CMC"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cyanidecode.org/cyanide_environmental.php| title=Environmental and Health Effects of Cyanide| publisher=International Cyanide Management Institute|year=2006| accessdate=4 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrocyanic acid, also known as hydrogen cyanide, or HCN, is a highly volatile liquid that is produced on a large scale industrially.  It is obtained by acidification of cyanide salts.

Organic cyanides are usually called [[nitrile]]s. In nitriles, the CN group is linked by a [[covalent bond]] to carbon.  For example, in [[acetonitrile]], the cyanide group is bonded to [[methyl]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Because they do not release cyanide ions, nitriles are generally far less toxic than cyanide salts.  Some nitriles, which occur naturally as [[cyanohydrin]]s, release hydrogen cyanide.

{{see also|Isocyanide}}
In [[IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry|IUPAC nomenclature]], [[organic compound]]s that have a&amp;nbsp;–C≡N [[functional group]] are called [[nitrile]]s. Thus, nitriles are organic compounds.&lt;ref&gt;[[IUPAC Gold Book]] [http://goldbook.iupac.org/N04151.html ''nitriles'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NCBI-MeSH [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/68009570 ''Nitriles'']&lt;/ref&gt;
An example of a nitrile is CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN, [[acetonitrile]], also known as [[methyl]] cyanide. Nitriles usually do not release cyanide ions. A functional group with a hydroxyl and cyanide bonded to the same carbon is called [[cyanohydrin]]. Unlike nitriles, cyanohydridins do release [[hydrogen cyanide]]. In inorganic chemistry, salts containing the C≡N&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ion are referred to as '''cyanides'''.

The word is derived from the Greek ''kyanos'', meaning dark blue, as a result of its being first obtained by the heating of the pigment known as [[Prussian blue]].

==Bonding==
The cyanide ion is [[isoelectronic]] with [[carbon monoxide]] and with molecular [[nitrogen]].&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood, N. N.; &amp; Earnshaw, A. (1997).

==Occurrence and reactions==

===In nature===
[[File:Removal of cyanide poison from cassava.jpg|thumb|left|Removal of cyanide from [[cassava]] in [[Nigeria]].]]
Cyanides are produced by certain [[bacterium|bacteria]], [[fungi]], and [[algae]] and are found in a number of plants. Cyanides are found in substantial amounts in certain seeds and fruit stones, e.g., those of [[bitter almond]]s, [[apricot]]s, [[apple]]s, and [[peach]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tf.asp?id=71&amp;tid=19 |title=ToxFAQs for Cyanide |accessdate=2008-06-28 |date = July 2006|publisher=[[Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In plants, cyanides are usually bound to [[sugar]] molecules in the form of cyanogenic [[glycoside]]s and defend the plant against [[herbivore]]s. [[Cassava]] roots (also called manioc), an important [[potato]]-like food grown in tropical countries (and the base from which [[tapioca]] is made), also contain cyanogenic glycosides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=J. |last=Vetter |title=Plant cyanogenic glycosides |journal=Toxicon |year=2000 |volume=38 |pages=11–36 |doi=10.1016/S0041-0101(99)00128-2 |pmid=10669009 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jones&gt;{{Cite journal|first=D.

The [[Madagascar]] bamboo ''[[Cathariostachys madagascariensis]]'' produces cyanide as a deterrent to grazing. In response, the [[golden bamboo lemur]], which eats the bamboo, has developed a high tolerance to cyanide.

===Interstellar medium===
The [[cyanide radical]] CN· has been identified in interstellar space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pieniazek |first=Piotr A. |author2=Bradforth, Stephen E. |author3=Krylov, Anna I.  |title=Spectroscopy of the Cyano Radical in an Aqueous Environment |date=2005-12-07 |publisher=Department of Chemistry, [[University of Southern California]]|pages=4854–65|issue=14 |location=[[Los Angeles]], [[California]] 90089-0482|volume=110 |url=http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~krylov/pubs/pdf/jpca-110-4854.pdf|journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry A|pmid=16599455 |format=PDF |doi=10.1021/jp0545952|bibcode=2006JPCA..110.4854P}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cyanide radical (called [[cyanogen]]) is used to measure the temperature of interstellar gas clouds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Interstellar Cyanogen and the Temperature of the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation |author1=Roth, K.

===Pyrolysis and combustion product===
Hydrogen cyanide is produced by the combustion or [[pyrolysis]] of certain materials under [[oxygen deficient environment|oxygen-deficient condition]]s. For example, it can be detected in the [[exhaust gas|exhaust]] of [[internal combustion engine]]s and [[tobacco]] smoke. Certain [[plastic]]s, especially those derived from [[acrylonitrile]], release hydrogen cyanide when heated or burnt.&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt;

===Coordination chemistry===
{{main|Cyanometalate}}
The cyanide anion is a [[ligand]] for many [[transition metals]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharpe, A. G. The Chemistry of Cyano Complexes of the Transition Metals; Academic Press: London, 1976{{page needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high affinities of metals for this [[anion]] can be attributed to its negative charge, compactness, and ability to engage in π-bonding. Well-known complexes include:
*hexacyanides [M(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt; (M = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co), which are octahedral in shape.  
*the tetracyanides, [M(CN)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; (M = Ni, Pd, Pt), which are square planar in their geometry;
*the dicyanides [M(CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (M = Cu, Ag, Au), which are linear in geometry.

Among the most important cyanide coordination compounds are the octahedrally coordinated compounds [[potassium ferrocyanide]] and the pigment [[Prussian blue]], which are both essentially nontoxic due to the tight binding of the cyanides to a central iron atom.&lt;ref name=Holl&gt;{{ cite book |author1=Holleman, A. F. |author2=Wiberg, E. | title = Inorganic Chemistry | publisher = Academic Press | location = San Diego | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-12-352651-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Prussian blue was first accidentally made around 1706, by heating substances containing iron and carbon and nitrogen, and other cyanides made subsequently (and named after it). Among its many uses, Prussian blue gives the blue color to [[blueprints]], [[bluing (fabric)|bluing]], and [[cyanotype]]s.

The [[enzymes]] called [[hydrogenase]]s contain cyanide [[ligand]]s attached to iron in their active sites. The biosynthesis of cyanide in the [NiFe]-hydrogenases proceeds from [[carbamoyl phosphate]], which converts to [[cystein]]yl [[thiocyanate]], the CN&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; donor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reissmann |first1=Stefanie |last2=Hochleitner |first2=Elisabeth |last3=Wang |first3=Haofan |last4=Paschos |first4=Athanasios |last5=Lottspeich |first5=Friedrich |last6=Glass |first6=Richard S. |last7=Böck |first7=August |title=Taming of a Poison: Biosynthesis of the NiFe-Hydrogenase Cyanide Ligands |journal=Science |volume=299 |issue=5609 |pages=1067–70 |year=2003 |pmid=12586941 |doi=10.1126/science.1080972 |bibcode=2003Sci...299.1067R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organic derivatives===
{{Main|Nitriles}}
Because of the cyanide anion's high [[nucleophile|nucleophilicity]], cyano groups are readily introduced into organic molecules by displacement of a [[halide]] group (e.g., the [[chloride]] on [[methyl chloride]]). In general, organic cyanides are called nitriles. Thus, CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN can be called methyl cyanide but more commonly is referred to as [[acetonitrile]]. In organic synthesis, cyanide is a C-1 [[synthon]]; i.e., it can be used to lengthen a carbon chain by one, while retaining the ability to be [[wiktionary:functionalize|functionalized]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}
:RX + CN&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → RCN + X&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ([[nucleophilic substitution]]) followed by
# RCN + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → [[carboxylic acid|RCOOH]] + NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ([[hydrolysis]] under reflux with mineral acid catalyst), or
# 2 RCN + [[Lithium aluminium hydride|LiAlH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] + (second step) 4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → [[amine|2 RCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] + LiAl(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (under [[reflux]] in dry [[diethyl ether|ether]], followed by addition of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)

==Manufacture==
{{main|Hydrogen cyanide#Production and synthesis}}
The principal process used to manufacture cyanides is the [[Andrussow process]] in which gaseous [[hydrogen cyanide]] is produced from [[methane]] and [[ammonia]] in the presence of [[oxygen]] and a [[platinum]] [[catalyst]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

:2 CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 HCN + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Gaseous hydrogen cyanide may be dissolved in aqueous [[sodium hydroxide]] solution to produce [[sodium cyanide]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

==Toxicity==
{{Main|Cyanide poisoning}}
Many cyanides are highly toxic. The cyanide anion is an [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]] of the [[enzyme]] [[cytochrome c oxidase]] (also known as aa&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) in the fourth complex of the [[electron transport chain]] (found in the membrane of the [[mitochondria]] of eukaryotic cells). It attaches to the iron within this protein. The binding of cyanide to this enzyme prevents transport of electrons from [[cytochrome c]] to oxygen. As a result, the electron transport chain is disrupted, meaning that the cell can no longer aerobically produce [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] for energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nelson|first1=David L.|last2=Cox|first2=Michael M.|title=Lehniger Principles of Biochemistry|publisher=[[Worth Publishers]]|year=2000|location=New York|edition=3rd|isbn=1-57259-153-6|pages=668,670–71,676}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tissues that depend highly on [[aerobic respiration]], such as the [[central nervous system]] and the [[heart]], are particularly affected. This is an example of [[histotoxic hypoxia]].&lt;ref name=Biller&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

The most hazardous compound is [[hydrogen cyanide]], which is a gas and kills by inhalation. For this reason, an air respirator supplied by an external oxygen source must be worn when working with hydrogen cyanide.&lt;ref name="CDC"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/cyanide/basics/facts.asp|title=Facts about cyanide:Where cyanide is found and how it is used|last=Anon|date=June 27, 2013|work=CDC Emergency preparedness and response|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrogen cyanide is produced by adding acid to a solution containing a cyanide salt. Alkaline solutions of cyanide are safer to use because they do not evolve hydrogen cyanide gas. Hydrogen cyanide may be produced in the combustion of [[polyurethane]]s; for this reason, polyurethanes are not recommended for use in domestic and aircraft furniture. Oral ingestion of a small quantity of solid cyanide or a cyanide solution as little as 200&amp;nbsp;mg, or exposure to airborne cyanide of 270 [[parts per million|ppm]], is sufficient to cause death within minutes.&lt;ref name=Biller/&gt;

Organic [[nitrile]]s do not readily release cyanide ions, and so have low toxicities. By contrast, compounds such as [[trimethylsilyl cyanide]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiCN readily release HCN or the cyanide ion upon contact with water.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===Antidote===
[[Hydroxocobalamin]] reacts with cyanide to form [[cyanocobalamin]], which can be safely eliminated by the kidneys. This method has the advantage of avoiding the formation of methemoglobin (see below). This antidote kit is sold under the brand name Cyanokit and was approved by the U.S. FDA in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{EMedicine|article|814287|Cyanide Toxicity|treatment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An older cyanide antidote kit included administration of three substances: [[amyl nitrite]] pearls (administered by inhalation), [[sodium nitrite]], and [[sodium thiosulfate]]. The goal of the antidote was to generate a large pool of [[ferric]] iron (Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;) to compete for cyanide with cytochrome a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (so that cyanide will bind to the antidote rather than the enzyme). The [[nitrite]]s [[oxidize]] [[hemoglobin]] to [[methemoglobin]], which competes with cytochrome oxidase for the cyanide ion. Cyanmethemoglobin is formed and the [[cytochrome oxidase]] enzyme is restored. The major mechanism to remove the cyanide from the body is by enzymatic conversion to [[thiocyanate]] by the [[mitochondrial]] enzyme [[rhodanese]]. Thiocyanate is a relatively non-toxic molecule and is excreted by the kidneys. To accelerate this detoxification, sodium thiosulfate is administered to provide a sulfur donor for [[rhodanese]], needed in order to produce thiocyanate.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhary, M.; Gupta, R. "Cyanide Detoxifying Enzyme: Rhodanese" Current Biotechnology, 2012, vol. 1, pp. 327-335. {{DOI|10.2174/2211550111201040327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sensitivity===
Minimum risk levels (MRLs) may not protect for delayed health effects or health effects acquired following repeated sublethal exposure, such as hypersensitivity, [[asthma]], or [[bronchitis]]. MRLs may be revised after sufficient data accumulates.&lt;ref&gt;Toxicological Profile for Cyanide, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2006{{full citation needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Mining===
{{Main|Gold cyanidation}}
Cyanide is mainly produced for the [[mining]] of [[gold]] and [[silver]]: It helps dissolve these metals and their ores. In the ''[[cyanide process]]'', finely ground high-grade ore is mixed with the cyanide (concentration of about two kilogram NaCN per tonne); low-grade ores are stacked into heaps and sprayed with a cyanide solution (concentration of about one kilogram NaCN per ton). The precious metals are complexed by the cyanide [[anion]]s to form soluble derivatives, e.g., [Au(CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; and [Ag(CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;{{cite book |first1=Andreas |last1=Rubo |first2=Raf |last2=Kellens |first3=Jay |last3=Reddy |first4=Norbert |last4=Steier |first5=Wolfgang |last5=Hasenpusch |chapter=Alkali metal cyanides |title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |year=2006 |doi=10.1002/14356007.i01_i01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
::4 Au + 8 NaCN + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 4 Na[Au(CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] + 4 NaOH

Silver is less [[Noble metal|"noble"]] than gold and often occurs as the sulfide, in which case redox is not invoked (no O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is required). Instead, a displacement reaction occurs:
::Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S + 4 NaCN + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 2 Na[Ag(CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] + NaSH + NaOH
The "pregnant liquor" containing these ions is separated from the solids, which are discarded to a [[tailing pond]] or spent heap, the recoverable gold having been removed. The metal is recovered from the "pregnant solution" by reduction with [[zinc]] dust or by [[adsorption]] onto [[activated carbon]]. This process can result in environmental and health problems. A number of [[List of gold mining disasters|environmental disasters]] have followed the overflow of tailing ponds at gold mines. Cyanide contamination of waterways has resulting in numerous cases of human and aquatic species mortality.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Aqueous cyanide is hydrolyzed rapidly, especially in sunlight. It can mobilize some heavy metals such as mercury if present. Gold can also be associated with arsenopyrite (FeAsS), which is similar to [[iron pyrite]] (fool's gold), wherein half of the sulfur atoms are replaced by [[arsenic]]. Gold-containing arsenopyrite ores are similarly reactive toward inorganic cyanide.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Cyanide is also used in [[electroplating]], where it stabilizes metal ions in the electrolyte solution prior to their deposition.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Industrial organic chemistry===
Some nitriles are produced on a large scale, e.g., [[adiponitrile]] is a precursor to [[nylon]]. Such compounds are often generated by combining hydrogen cyanide and alkenes, i.e., [[hydrocyanation]]:
RCH=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + HCN → RCH(CN)CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Metal catalysts are required for such reactions.

===Medical uses===
The cyanide compound [[sodium nitroprusside]] is used mainly in [[clinical chemistry]] to measure [[urine]] [[ketone bodies]] mainly as a follow-up to [[diabetic]] patients. On occasion, it is used in emergency medical situations to produce a rapid decrease in [[blood pressure]] in humans; it is also used as a [[vasodilator]] in vascular research. The cobalt in artificial [[Vitamin B12|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]] contains a cyanide ligand as an artifact of the purification process; this must be removed by the body before the vitamin molecule can be activated for biochemical use. During [[World War I]], a copper cyanide compound was briefly used by [[Japan]]ese physicians for the treatment of [[tuberculosis]] and [[leprosy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Takano |first=R. |date=August 1916 |title=THE TREATMENT OF LEPROSY WITH CYANOCUPROL |journal=The Journal of Experimental Medicine |volume=24 |issue= 2|pages=207–211 |url=http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/abstract/24/2/207 |accessdate=2008-06-28 |doi=10.1084/jem.24.2.207 |pmc=2125457 |pmid=19868035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Illegal fishing and poaching===
{{Main|Cyanide fishing}}
Cyanides are illegally used to capture live fish near [[coral reef]]s for the [[aquarium]] and seafood markets.

===Niche uses===
[[Potassium ferrocyanide]] is used to achieve a blue color on cast [[bronze sculpture]]s during the final finishing stage of the sculpture. On its own, it will produce a very dark shade of blue and is often mixed with other chemicals to achieve the desired tint and hue. It is applied using a torch and paint brush while wearing the standard safety equipment used for any patina application: rubber gloves, safety glasses, and a respirator. The actual amount of cyanide in the mixture varies according to the recipes used by each foundry.

Cyanide is also used in [[jewelry]]-making and certain kinds of [[photography]] such as [[sepia toning]].

Cyanides are used as [[insecticide]]s for fumigating ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SODIUM CYANIDE|url=https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/sodium_cyanide|website=PubChem|publisher=National Center for Biotechnology Information|accessdate=2 September 2016|date=2016|quote=Cyanide and hydrogen cyanide are used in electroplating, metallurgy, organic chemicals production, photographic developing, manufacture of plastics, fumigation of ships, and some mining processes.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyanide salts are used for killing ants,&lt;ref name="EPAReg1994"&gt;{{cite web|title=Reregistration Eligibility Decision (RED) Sodium Cyanide|url=https://archive.epa.gov/pesticides/reregistration/web/pdf/3086.pdf|website=EPA.gov|accessdate=2 September 2016|page=7|date=1 September 1994|quote=Sodium cyanide was initially registered as a pesticide on December 23, 1947, to control ants on uncultivated agricultural and non-agricultural areas.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have in some places been used as rat poison&lt;ref name="TariffInfo1921"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tariff Information, 1921: Hearings on General Tariff Revision Before the Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives|url=http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?tn=Tariff+Information,+1921|website=AbeBooks.com|publisher=US Congress, House Committee on Ways and Means, US Government Printing Office|accessdate=2 September 2016|page=3987|date=1921|quote=Another field in which cyanide is used in growing quantity is the eradication of rats and other vermin--especially in the fight against typhus.}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the less toxic poison [[arsenic]] is more common).&lt;ref name="PlanetDeadly2013"&gt;{{cite web|title=Deadliest Poisons Used by Man|url=http://www.planetdeadly.com/human/deadliest-poisons-man|website=PlanetDeadly.com|accessdate=2 September 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160511033535/http://www.planetdeadly.com/human/deadliest-poisons-man|archivedate=11 May 2016|date=18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although usually thought to be toxic, cyanide and cyanohydrins have been demonstrated to increase germination in various plant species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1104/pp.52.1.23 |last=Taylorson |first=R. |last2=Hendricks |year=1973 |first2=SB |title=Promotion of Seed Germination by Cyanide |journal=Plant Physiol. |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=23–27 |pmid=16658492 |pmc=366431}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mullick |first=P. |year=1967 |last2=Chatterji |first2=U.

For notable cyanide deaths, see [[Cyanide poisoning#History|Cyanide poisoning: History]].

Most significantly, hydrogen cyanide released from pellets of [[Zyklon-B]] was used extensively in the systematic mass murders of [[the Holocaust]], especially in [[extermination camp]]s. Poisoning by hydrogen cyanide gas within a [[gas chamber]] (as a salt of hydrocyanic acid is dropped into a strong acid, usually sulfuric acid) is one method of [[capital punishment|executing a condemned prisoner]] as the condemned prisoner eventually breathes the lethal fumes.

==Chemical tests for cyanide==

===Prussian blue===
[[Iron(II) sulfate]] is added to a solution suspected of containing cyanide, such as the filtrate from the [[sodium fusion test]]. The resulting mixture is acidified with [[mineral acid]]. The formation of [[Prussian blue]] is a positive result for cyanide.

===''para''-Benzoquinone in DMSO===
A solution of [[1,4-Benzoquinone|''para''-benzoquinone]] in [[dimethyl sulfoxide|DMSO]] reacts with inorganic cyanide to form a cyano[[phenol]], which is [[fluorescent]]. Illumination with a [[UV light]] gives a green/blue glow if the test is positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/0041-008X(80)90225-2 |pmid = 7423496 |title = Fluorometric determination of cyanide in biological fluids with p-benzoquinone*1 |first4 = JL |last4 = Way |first3 = RL |last3 = Morgan |first2 = GE |year = 1980 |last2 = Isom |last1 = Ganjeloo |first1 = A |journal = [[Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology]] |volume = 55 |issue = 1 |pages = 103–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copper and an aromatic amine===
As used by [[fumigation|fumigators]] to detect [[hydrogen cyanide]], [[copper]](II) salt and an aromatic amine such as [[benzidine]] is added to the sample; as an alternative to benzidine an alternative amine di-(4,4-''bis''-dimethylaminophenyl) methane can be used. A positive test gives a blue color. [[Copper(I) cyanide]] is poorly soluble. By sequestering the copper(I) the copper(II) is rendered a stronger [[oxidant]]. The copper, in a cyanide facilitated oxidation, converts the [[amine]] into a colored compound. The [[Nernst equation]] explains this process. Another good example of such chemistry is the way in which the saturated [[calomel]] [[reference electrode]] ([[saturated calomel electrode|SCE]]) works. The copper, in a cyanide-facilitated oxidation, converts the [[amine]] into a colored compound.

===Pyridine-barbituric acid colorimetry===
A sample containing inorganic cyanide is purged with air from a boiling acid solution into a basic absorber solution. The cyanide salt absorbed in the basic solution is buffered at pH 4.5 and then reacted with chlorine to form cyanogen chloride. The cyanogen chloride formed couples pyridine with barbituric acid to form a strongly colored red dye that is proportional to the cyanide concentration. This colorimetric method following distillation is the basis for most regulatory methods (for instance EPA 335.4) used to analyze cyanide in water, wastewater, and contaminated soils. Distillation followed by colorimetric methods, however, have been found to be prone to interferences from thiocyanate, nitrate, thiosulfate, sulfite, and sulfide that can result in both positive and negative bias. It has been recommended by the USEPA (MUR March 12, 2007) that samples containing these compounds be analyzed by Gas-Diffusion Flow Injection Analysis—Amperometry.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

===Corrinoids colorimetry===

A solution of aquacyano-corrinoids, such as [[cobalamin]] or [[cobinamide]], reacts with free cyanide in an aqueous sample. The binding of cyanide to the corrinoid cobalt center leads to a color change from orange to violet,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Inorganic Chemistry of Vitamin B12|last=Pratt|first=J.M.|publisher=Academic Press|year=1972|isbn=|location=|page=44|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing for semi-quantification by naked-eye. Precise quantification of the cyanide content is feasible by [[UV-vis spectroscopy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zelder|first=F.H.|year=2008|title=Specific Colorimetric Detection of Cyanide Triggered by a Conformational Switch in Vitamin B12 |url= |journal=Inorganic Chemistry|volume=47|pages=1264–1266|via=|doi=10.1021/ic702368b}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mannel-Croise, Zelder|first=|year=2009|title=Side chains of cobalt corrinoids control the sensitivity and selectivity in the colorimetric detection of cyanide|url=|journal=Inorganic Chemistry|volume=48|pages=1272–1274|via=|doi=10.1021/ic900053h}}&lt;/ref&gt; Absorption of the corrinoid on a solid phase,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mannel-Croise, Zelder|first=|year=2012|title=Complex samples cyanide detection with immobilized corrinoids |url= |journal=ACS applied materials &amp; interfaces|volume=4|pages=725–729|via=|doi=10.1021/am201357u}}&lt;/ref&gt; allows detection of cyanide even in colored samples, rendering this method appropriate for the analysis of cyanide in water, wastewater, blood, and food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tivana, Da Cruz Francisco, Zelder, Bergenståhl, Dejmek |first= |year=2014 |title=Straightforward rapid spectrophotometric quantification of total cyanogenic glycosides in fresh and processed cassava products|url=|journal=Food Chemistry |volume=158 |pages=20–27|via= |doi=10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.02.066}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mannel-Croise, Zelder|first=|year=2012|title=Rapid visual detection of blood cyanide |url= |journal=Analytical Methods |volume=4|pages=2632–2634|via= |doi=10.1039/c2ay25595b}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, this technology is non-toxic and considerably less prone to interference than the pyridine-barbituric acid colorimetry method.

===Gas diffusion flow injection analysis—amperometry===
Instead of distilling, the sample is injected into an acidic stream where the HCN formed is passed under a hydrophobic gas diffusion membrane that selectively allows only HCN to pass through. The HCN that passes through the membrane is absorbed into a basic carrier solution that transports the CN to an amperometric detector that accurately measures cyanide concentration with high sensitivity. Sample pretreatment determined by acid reagents, ligands, or preliminary UV irradiation allow cyanide speciation of free cyanide, available cyanide, and total cyanide respectively. The relative simplicity of these flow injection analysis methods limit the interference experienced by the high heat of distillation and also prove to be cost effective since time consuming distillations are not required.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3389">'''ERG theory''' is a theory in [[psychology]] proposed by [[Clayton Alderfer]].
[[File:Alderfer's ERG Theory.jpg|thumb]]

Alderfer further developed [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]] by categorizing the hierarchy into his '''ERG theory''' ([[Existence]], [[Coefficient of relationship|Relatedness]] and Growth). The existence group is concerned with providing the basic material existence requirements of humans. They include the items that Maslow considered to be physiological and safety needs. The second group of needs is those of relatedness&amp;nbsp;– the desire people have for maintaining important [[Interpersonal relationship|interpersonal relationships]]. These social and status desires require interaction with others if they are to be satisfied, and they align with Maslow's social need and the external component of Maslow's esteem classification. Finally, Alderfer isolates growth needs: an intrinsic desire for [[personal development]]. These include the intrinsic component from Maslow's esteem category and the characteristics included under [[self-actualization]].
Alderfer categorized the lower order needs (Physiological and Safety) into the Existence category. He fit Maslow's interpersonal love and esteem needs into the Relatedness category. The Growth category contained the self-actualization and self-esteem needs. Alderfer also proposed a regression theory to go along with the ERG theory. He said that when needs in a higher category are not met then individuals redouble the efforts invested in a lower category need. For example if self-actualization or [[self-esteem]] is not met then individuals will invest more effort in the relatedness category in the hopes of achieving the higher need.&lt;ref&gt;[http://courses.washington.edu/inde495/lece.htm Design in the Manufacturing Firm syllabus] University of Washington Industrial Engineering course syllabus.

'''Ecotoxicity''', the subject of study of the field of [[ecotoxicology]] (a [[portmanteau]] of [[ecology]] and [[toxicology]]), refers to the potential for [[biological]], [[chemical]] or physical [[stressor]]s to affect [[ecosystems]]. Such stressors might occur in the natural environment at densities, concentrations or levels high enough to disrupt the natural biochemistry, physiology, behavior and interactions of the living organisms that comprise the ecosystem.

Ecotoxicology has been defined as, "the branch of toxicology concerned with the study of toxic effects, caused by natural or synthetic pollutants, to the constituents of ecosystems, animal (including human), vegetable and microbial, in an integral context".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Truhaut R | year = 1977 | title = Eco-Toxicology - Objectives, Principles and Perspectives | url = | journal = Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety | volume = 1 | issue = 2| pages = 151–173 | doi=10.1016/0147-6513(77)90033-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Common environmental toxicants == 
# [[Diethyl phthalate]], that enter environments through industries manufacturing cosmetics, plastic and many other commercial products.
# [[Bisphenol A]] (BPA), found in many mass-produced products such as, medical devices, food packaging, cosmetics, children's toys, computers, CD's, etc.
# Pharmaceuticals such as [[Climbazole]], a fungicide found in [[anti-dandruff shampoo]]s.
# [[Pesticide]]s
# Some but not all; [[Cleaning agent|cleaning products]], [[laundry detergent]]s, [[fabric softener]]s, [[oven cleaner]]s, [[disinfectant]]s
# [[Phosphate]]s
# [[Oil]]

== Everyday hazards ==

In Canada, there is no law requiring manufactures to state the health and [[environmental hazard]]s associated with their cleaning products. Many people buy such products to support a clean and healthy home, often unaware of the products ability to harm both their own health and the surrounding environment. "Canadians spend more than $275 million on household [[cleaning product]]s in a year" &lt;ref name="Suzuki"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://davidsuzuki.org/issues/health/science/toxics/the-dirt-on-toxic-chemicals-in-household-cleaning-products/ |title=The dirt on toxic chemicals in household cleaning products |last=Suzuki |first=David |publisher= The David Suzuki Foundation |date=  |website=David Suzuki Foundation, Solutions are in our nature |access-date=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemicals from these cleaners enter our bodies through air passageways and [[skin absorption|absorption through the skin]] and when these cleaning products are  washed down the drain they negatively affect [[aquatic ecosystem]]s. There are also no regulations in place stating that the ingredients be listed on labels of cleaning products leading the users to be ultimately unaware of the chemicals they expose themselves and their surrounding environments to.

=== 2-Butoxyethanol === 
The organic compound [[2-Butoxyethanol]], commonly found in [[glass cleaner]]s, laundry [[stain remover]]s, windshield wiper fluid, [[oven cleaner]]s, and [[rust remover]]s has been proven to cause [[reproductive problems]] in laboratory experiments.

=== Ammonia === 
The compound [[ammonia]] is found in many window cleaners, drain cleaners, bathroom cleaners, oven cleaners, [[car polish]], and all-purpose cleaners. Its vapour is particularly harmful to people with [[asthma]] and it may also cause kidney and [[liver damage]]. When ammonia is mixed with products containing [[chlorine bleach]], highly poisonous [[chloramine]] gas is formed. This poisonous gas often forms when cleaners are mixed in the home forming strong irritants.

=== Fragrance chemicals ===

[[Fragrance]] chemicals are found in most cleaning products, perfumes, and [[personal care]] products. More than 3000 chemicals are used in these fragrance mixtures. The synthetic musks used in [[detergent]]s accumulate in the environment and are harmful to aquatic organisms. Certain musks are possible [[endocrine disruptor]]s that interfere with hormone functioning. Phthalates are a common ingredient in these fragrance mixtures found in laundry detergents and fabric softeners. These phthalates are suspected endocrine disrupters that affect reproduction rates including reduced sperm count in males. Certain glass cleaners and floor polishes contain dibutyl phthalate (DBP). The European Union classifies DBP as very toxic to aquatic organisms, posing a huge danger as these cleaners, especially the floor polishes are often rinsed down the drain and into aquatic environments.

=== Phosphates ===

[[Phosphates]] are found in many dishwasher detergents, laundry detergents, and bathroom cleaners. They act as a fertilizer in water and in high concentrations can promote algae blooms and increase weed growth. When water containing phosphates are washed into water areas they carry with them [[fertilizer]]s, nutrients, and wastes from the land. [[Phytoplankton]] and algae flourish at the surface due to increased phosphates. Dead phytoplankton and other organisms sink to the bottom giving rise to large numbers of decomposers due to increased food supply (dead organisms, phytoplankton). Due to the increased number of decomposers that use more oxygen, fish and shrimp at the lower layers of the ocean become oxygen-starved and [[hypoxic zone]]s become apparent.

=== Quaternary ammonium compounds (quats) ===

[[Quats]] are [[anti-microbial]] agents that are found in bathroom cleaners, [[fabric softener]]s, and degreasers. They are a class of irritants and [[Allergy|sensitizers]] that negatively affect people who suffer from asthma. Chemicals in this class are persistent in aquatic environments, and toxic to the organisms that live in these environments. Many researchers are concerned that their widespread use in everyday household [[disinfectant]]s and cosmetics are contributing to [[antibiotic resistant]] bacteria, thus limiting microbial infection treatment options.

===Trisodium nitrilotriacetate===

Trisodium [[nitrilotriacetate]] is found in bathroom cleaners and possibly some laundry detergents although more actively used in industrial formulations. Small amounts add up in the environment and add to an overall toxic issue. In aquatic ecosystems these chemicals cause [[heavy metal (chemical element)|heavy metals]] in [[sediment]] to redisolve and many of these metals are toxic to fish and other wildlife.&lt;ref name="Suzuki"/&gt;

== Plasticizers ==
[[Phthalates]] and [[Bisphenol A|BPA]] date back to the 1920s and 1930s. Phthalates have been applied as polyvinyl chloride (PVC) additives since 1926, but were also used for health care purposes as [[insect repellent]]s and [[cercaricides]]. BPA is present in most aquatic environments, entering water systems through [[landfill]]s and [[sewage treatment plant]] [[surface runoff|runoff]] allowing for [[bioaccumulation]] in aquatic organisms.&lt;ref name=Oehlmann2009&gt;{{cite journal|author = Oehlmann, J. | author2 = Oehlmann, U.S. | author3 = Kolas, W. | author4 = Jagnytsch, O. |author5=Lutz, I. | author6 = Kusk, K.O. | author7 = Wollenberger, L. | author8 = Santos E.M. | author9 = Paull, G.C. | author10 = Van Look, K.J.W. | author11 = Tyler, C.R. | date = 2009| title = A critical analysis of the biological impacts of plasticizers on wildlife. |journal= Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society |volume= 364| issue = | pages = 2047–2062 | doi=10.1098/rstb.2008.0242 | pmid=19528055 | pmc=2873012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These endocrine disrupters are a large group of chemicals that enter into the aquatic environment through the manufacturing of various industrial and consumer products, agriculture and food/drug processing, waste water treatment plants and human wastes. Phthalate esters are common additives that soften and make PVC more flexible.&lt;ref name=Barse2007&gt;{{cite journal|author = Barse, A. V.| author2 = Chakrabarti, T. | author3 = Ghosh, T.K. | author4 = Pal, A.K. |author5=Jadhao, S.B.| date = 2007| title = Endocrine disruption and metabolic changes following exposure of Cyprinus carpio to diethyl phthalate |journal= Pesticide Biochemistry and Physiology |volume= 88| issue = | pages = 36–42 | doi=10.1016/j.pestbp.2006.08.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in many everyday items such as medical devices, packaging for fragrances and cosmetics, ropes and varnishes, in plastic used to wrap food, and shower curtains. These Phthalate esters have been found in areas of water, air, sediment, and in gulfs and rivers around the world, Giam et al. as cited by.&lt;ref name="Barse2007"/&gt; Phalates and BPA affect reproduction in animal groups such as Molluscs, crustaceans, amphibians and fish. Most of these plasticizers affect hormone systems, and some phthalates have even larger pathways of disruption. Phthalates and BPA have been proven to affect development and reproduction in a variety of species. Disturbances include changes in the number of offspring produced and reduced hatching success. In amphibians for example, phthalates and BPA disrupt thyroid functioning which in turn impacts larval development. Molluscs, crustaceans and amphibians appear to be more responsive than fish, with most effects being induced in low concentration ranges with the exception of disrupted [[spermatogenesis]] in fish in the low range.&lt;ref name="Oehlmann2009"/&gt; 
A Phthalate referred to as [[diethyl phthalate]] (DEP) enters the aquatic environment through industries that manufacture cosmetics, plastics and many commercial products that pose hazards to aquatic organisms and human health. Through exposing an adult male common Carp (Cyprinus carpio) to [[LC50]] doses it was evident that a bioaccumulation of DEP in testis, liver, brain, gills and muscle tissue was present. Fish exposed to 20 ppm of DEP became drowsy and discolored during the onset of the fourth week.&lt;ref name="Barse2007"/&gt; 
Sources of DEP contamination and accumulation in humans include cosmetic products and dietary meat of fish, Persky et al.&lt;ref name="Barse2007"/&gt; This DEP acts as a cosmetic ingredient and vehicle for fragrances, both which come in contact with the skin. 
Many countries around the world including India practice sewage fed fisheries where waste waters are used for the purpose of culturing fish. Endocrine disruption and a presence of phthalate residue is highly likely to be observable in these sewage fed fish. This is the case as waste water from various industries and garbage containing DEP are released into these waters. Through a DEP treatment with [[Cyprinus carpio]], liver size was observed to increase and testis size decreased. In fish, muscle ALT and AST activities decreased as it was effected by DEP treatment.  Like many toxic chemicals DEP has been known to affect metabolic enzyme profiles and activities of phosphatases and transaminases, Ghorpade et al. as cited by.&lt;ref name="Barse2007"/&gt; A decrease in immunity of [[M. rosenbergii]] after exposure to DEP was also noted. 
Given that biological effect concentrations for plasticizers used in the laboratory coincide with concentrations present in the environment, it seems that some wildlife species must be negatively impacted.

== Personal hygiene products ==
Personal care products can reach the environment through drainage from waste water treatment plants and digested sludge. Recently, the anti-dandruff and [[antimycotic]], [[Climbazole]], was detected in waste water treatment drainages. Climbazole is readily used in cosmetics, and is an ingredient in anti-dandruff shampoos. Shampoos contain formulations of up to 2.0% which is the equivalent of approximately 15g/L. Climbazole is classified as very toxic to aquatic organisms. It affects the growth of green algae [[Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata]] at very low concentrations. [[Zebrafish]] experienced lethal effects after exposure to climbazole in laboratory testing. Effects included thickening of fertilized eggs, lack of somite formation, lack of detachment of the tail bud from the yolk sac, and lack of a heartbeat were evaluated after 48 hours.&lt;ref name=Richter2013&gt;{{cite journal|author = Richter, E. | author2 = Wick, A. | author3 = Ternes, T.A. | author4 = Coors, A. | date = 2013| title = Ecotoxicity of Climbzole, a fungicide contained in Antridandruff shampoo. |journal= Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry  |volume= 32| issue = | pages = 2816–2825 | doi=10.1002/etc.2367}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[Danio rerio]], [[Lemna minor]], [[Navicula pelliculosa]], Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, and [[Daphnia magna]] were tested and all were found to be negatively affected by climbazole in a concentration-dependant manner with highest toxicity observed in L. minor. Effects included stunted colony growth and darkening in color. Effects of climbazole on [[oats]] and [[turnip]] included retarded, stunted growth of the leaves and shoot as well as turning darker in color. The aquatic ecotoxicity of climbazole can be classified as very toxic to Lemna and algae, toxic to fish and harmful to Daphnia.&lt;ref name="Richter2013"/&gt;

== Pesticides == 
[[Pesticides]] often pose serious problems as they kill not only targeted organisms but also non-targeted organisms in the process. They are released into the natural environment intentionally by people who are often unaware that the chemicals will travel further than anticipated, Hatakeyama et al. as cited in.&lt;ref name=Hanazato2001&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hanazato T. | date = 2001 | title = Pesticide effects on freshwater zooplankton: an ecological perspective | url = | journal = Environmental Pollution  | volume = 112 | issue = 1| pages = 1–10 | doi=10.1016/s0269-7491(00)00110-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the pesticides largely affect the natural communities in which they are used. They negatively effect multiple levels ranging from molecules to tisues to organs to individuals to populations and onto communities. In the natural environment, a combination of pesticide exposure and natural stressors such as fluctuating temperature, food shortage or decreased oxygen availability are worse than when presented alone. Pesticides can affect the feeding rates of zoo-plankton. In the presence of pesticides zoo-plankton display lower feeding rates which result in reduced growth and reproduction. Swimming may also be affected by pesticides which poses a life-threatening issue for zoo-plankton as they swim to obtain food and nutrients and avoid predators. Such changes may alter predator-prey relationships. A spinning behavior became apparent in Daphnia induced by carbaryl which increased the probability of the Daphnia being eaten by other fish, Dodson et al. as cited by.&lt;ref name="Hanazato2001"/&gt; The toxicant [[pentachlorophenol]] increases swimming speed in the rotifer [[Brachionus calyciflorus]], in turn increasing the encounter rate of the prey with their predators, Preston et al. as cited by.&lt;ref name="Hanazato2001"/&gt;

== Oil spills == 
One of the major environmental impacts of oil exploration on the environment is the contamination of aquatic ecosystems from [[oil spill]]s and oil seepages from pits. Oftentimes, as is the case in the [[Ecuadorian Amazon]], oil is used to control [[dust]] on roadways, causing the precipitation [[surface runoff|runoff]] from these roads to also be contaminated. Direct human health hazards occur since many people, including children walk barefoot on these oiled roads putting them in direct contact with the crude oil. Other hazards to humans include [[seepage]]s into ponds that provide drinking water for the population. 
During the exploration for oil, mud that has been drilled is deposited into pits. These production pits are often not lined risking the possibility for contaminants to leak into the surrounding environment. Environmental concerns are primarily focused on a group of [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAHs). “PAHs accumulate on particles and sediments, which tend to protect them from biodegrading processes", Green and Trett as cited in.&lt;ref name=Wernersson2004&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wernersson A.S. | date = 2004 | title = Aquatic ecotoxicity due to oil pollution in the Ecuadorian Amazon. | url = | journal = Aquatic Ecosystem Health &amp; Management | volume = 7 | issue = 1| pages = 127–136 | doi=10.1080/14634980490281470}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the exploration for oil, mud that has been drilled is deposited into pits. These production pits are often not lined risking the possibility for contaminants to leak into the surrounding environment. 
Samples were collected from four sites (13 stations) in the Ecuadorian Amazon where crude oil was the main pollutant. The water collected from Site B, a drinking water pond located 100m from an in use pit, had the highest [[total petroleum hydrocarbon]] (THP) concentration. Sediments were found to be acutely [[phototoxic]]. This area which has poorly developed infrastructure is one where residents collect water for drinking, cooking and bathing from the rivers and ponds nearby. “A recent study observed excess [[cancer rate]]s in a village in this region” Sebastian et. Al, as cited in.&lt;ref name="Wernersson2004"/&gt; Not only were excess cancer rates apparent but many people in this area that were consuming the water for drinking purposes became ill.
In Wernersson’s study, toxicity of water and sediment samples were studied on Daphnia magna (a crustacean zoo-plankton species) and [[Hyalella azteca]] (an amphipod). These samples were collected from four sites where crude oil was the main source of pollution. 1-4 day old organisms of both species were used in the tests. Immobility of D. magna was recorded after 24 hours of exposure indoors. They were then moved outdoors where they were exposed to sunlight. After 1–2 hours the samples were removed from the sunlight and it was found that D. Magna often recovered within an hour after UV exposure.
Hyalella azteca was cultured in the same medium as was used for the D. Magna species. To minimize stress shade was provided. 16 hours of light and 8 hours of darkness were provided. [[Lethality]] was recorded after 96 hours of exposure.

'''Environmental policy''' is the commitment of an organization or government to the laws, regulations, and other policy mechanisms concerning [[environmental issue]]s. These issues generally include [[air pollution|air]] and [[water pollution]], [[waste management]], [[ecosystem management]], maintenance of [[biodiversity]], the protection of [[natural resource]]s, [[wildlife]] and [[endangered species]].&lt;ref&gt;Eccleston, Charles H. (2010). [https://www.amazon.com/Global-Environmental-Policy-Concepts-Principles-ebook/dp/B005H6M86Q/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1486949351&amp;sr=8-7&amp;keywords=charles+eccleston Global Environmental Policy: Concepts, Principles, and Practice]. {{ISBN|978-1439847664}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Concerning environmental policy, the importance of implementation of an eco-energy-oriented policy at a global level to address the issues of global warming and climate changes should be accentuated.&lt;ref&gt;Eraldo Banovac, Marinko Stojkov, Dražan Kozak. Designing a global energy policy model, Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers - Energy, Vol. 170, Issue 1, February, 2017, pp. 2-11. https://doi.org/10.1680/jener.16.00005&lt;/ref&gt;
Policies concerning energy or regulation of [[toxic substances]] including [[pesticide]]s and many types of [[industrial waste]] are part of the topic of environmental policy. This policy can be deliberately taken to direct and oversee human activities and thereby prevent harmful effects on the [[environment (biophysical)|biophysical environment]] and natural resources, as well as to make sure that changes in the environment do not have harmful effects on humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Definition==
It is useful to consider that environmental policy comprises two major terms: [[Natural environment|environment]] and [[policy]]. Environment refers to the physical ecosystems, but can also take into consideration the social dimension (quality of life, health) and an economic dimension (resource management, biodiversity).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[Environmental issues]] generally addressed by environmental policy include (but are not limited to) [[air pollution|air]] and [[water pollution]], [[waste management]], [[ecosystem]] management, [[biodiversity]] protection, the protection of [[natural resource]]s, [[wildlife]] and [[endangered species]], and the preservation of these natural resources for future generations. Relatively recently, environmental policy has also attended to the communication of environmental issues.&lt;ref&gt;A major article outlining and analyzing the history of environmental communication policy within the European Union has recently come out in ''The Information Society'', a journal based in the United States.  See Mathur, Piyush.  "Environmental Communication in the Information Society:  The Blueprint from Europe," ''The Information Society:  An International Journal'', 25: 2, March 2009 , pp. 119–38.  Accessible:  http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a909229825~db=all~jumptype=rss&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale==
The rationale for governmental involvement in the environment is [[market failure]] in the form of forces beyond the control of one person, including the [[free rider problem]] and the [[tragedy of the commons]]. An example of an externality is when a factory produces waste [[water pollution|pollution]] which may be dumped into a river, ultimately contaminating water. The cost of such action is paid by society-at-large, when they must clean the water before drinking it and is external to the costs of the factory. The free rider problem is when the private marginal cost of taking action to protect the environment is greater than the private marginal benefit, but the social marginal cost is less than the social marginal benefit. The tragedy of the commons is the problem that, because no one person owns the commons, each individual has an incentive to utilize common resources as much as possible. Without governmental involvement, the commons is overused.  Examples of tragedies of the commons are [[overfishing]] and [[overgrazing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Instruments, problems, and issues==
Environmental policy instruments are tools used by governments to implement their environmental policies. Governments may use a number of different types of instruments. For example, economic incentives and [[market-based instruments]] such as taxes and tax exemptions, tradable permits, and fees can be very effective to encourage compliance with environmental policy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oecd.org/about/0,3347,en_2649_34281_1_1_1_1_1,00.html http://www.oecd.org/about/0,3347,en_2649_34295_1_1_1_1_1,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; Corporate companies who engage in efficient environmental management and are transparent about their environmental data and reporting benefit from improved business performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.emisoft.com/environmental-compliance-corporate-performance-can-you-have-it-all/|title=Environmental Compliance &amp; Corporate Performance - Can You Have It All?|last=|first=|date=|website=www.emisoft.com|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bilateral agreements between the government and private firms and commitments made by firms independent of government requirement are examples of voluntary environmental measures. Another instrument is the implementation of greener public purchasing programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/about/0,3347 en_2649_34281_1_1_1_1_ 1,00.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610225031/http://www.oecd.org/about/0,3347 |date=June 10, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several instruments are sometimes combined in a policy mix to address a certain environmental problem. Since environmental issues have many aspects, several policy instruments may be needed to adequately address each one. Furthermore, a combination of different policies may give firms greater flexibility in policy compliance and reduce uncertainty as to the cost of such compliance.

Government policies must be carefully formulated so that the individual measures do not undermine one another, or create a rigid and cost-ineffective framework. Overlapping policies result in unnecessary administrative costs, increasing the cost of implementation.&lt;ref&gt;"Instrument Mixes for Environmental Policy" (Paris: OECD Publications, 2007) 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; To help governments realize their policy goals, the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] Environment Directorate collects data on the efficiency and consequences of environmental policies implemented by the national governments.&lt;ref&gt;“Environmental Policies and Instruments,” http://www.oecd.org/department/0,3355,en_2649_34281_1_1_1_1_1,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; The website, www.economicinstruments.com, [http://www.economicinstruments.com] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.economicinstruments.com |title=Economic Instruments |publisher=Economic Instruments |date=2011-01-26 |accessdate=2012-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides database detailing countries' experiences with their environmental policies. The [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]], through [[UNECE Environmental Performance Reviews]], evaluates progress made by its member countries in improving their environmental policies.

The current reliance on a market-based framework is controversial, however, and many environmentalists contend that a more radical, overarching approach is needed than a set of specific initiatives, to deal with [[climate change]]. For example, energy efficiency measures may actually increase energy consumption in the absence of a cap on fossil fuel use, as people might drive more fuel-efficient cars. Thus, Aubrey Meyer calls for a 'framework-based market' of [[contraction and convergence]]. The [[Cap and Share]] and the Sky Trust are proposals based on the idea.

Environmental impact assessments (EIA) are conducted to compare impacts of various policy alternatives. Moreover, it is assumed that policymakers make rational decisions based on the merits of the project. Eccleston and March argue that although policymakers normally have access to reasonably accurate information, political and economic factors often lead to environmentally destructive decisions in the long run.

The decision-making theory casts doubt on this premise. Irrational decisions are reached based on unconscious biases, illogical assumptions, and the desire to avoid ambiguity and uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;Eccleston C. and Doub P., Preparing NEPA Environmental Assessments:  A Users Guide to Best Professional Practices, CRC Press Inc., 300 pages (publication date: March 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles H. Eccleston|Eccleston]] identifies and describes four of the most critical environmental policy issues facing humanity: [[water scarcity]], [[food scarcity]], [[climate change]], and the [[Income and fertility|population paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;Eccleston C. and March F., Global Environmental Policy: Principles, Concepts And Practice, CRC Press Inc. 412 pages (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://ourworld.unu.edu/en/the-population-paradox&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/population-paradox-europes-time-bomb-888030.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and innovation policy==
Synergic to the environmental policy is the [[environmental research]] and [[innovation policy]]. An example is the [[European environmental research and innovation policy]], which aims at defining and implementing a transformative agenda to greening the economy and the society as a whole so to achieve a truly sustainable development. Europe is particularly active in this field, via a set of strategies, actions and programmes to promote more and better research and innovation for building a resource-efficient, climate resilient society and thriving economy in sync with its natural environment. Research and innovation in Europe are financially supported by the programme [[Horizon 2020]], which is also open to participation worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;See Horizon 2020 – the EU's new research and innovation programme http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-13-1085_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The 1960s marked the beginning of modern environmental policy making. Although mainstream America remained oblivious to environmental concerns, the stage had been set for change by the publication of Rachel Carson's New York Times bestseller Silent Spring in 1962. Earth Day founder Gaylord Nelson, then a U.S. Senator from Wisconsin, after witnessing the ravages of the 1969 massive oil spill in Santa Barbara, California. Administrator Ruckelshaus was confirmed by the Senate on December 2, 1970, which is the traditional date used as the birth of the agency. Five months earlier, in July 1970, President Nixon had signed Reorganization Plan No. 3 calling for the establishment of EPA in July 1970. At the time, Environmental Policy was a bipartisan issue and the efforts of the [[United States of America]] helped spark countries around the world to create environmental policies.&lt;ref&gt;“[http://search.proquest.com/docview/207664697/ Managing the Environment, Managing Ourselves: A History of American Environmental Policy]”&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, legislation was passed to regulate pollutants that go into the air, water tables, and solid waste disposal. President Nixon signed the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] in 1970 which set the USA as one of the world leaders in environmental conservation.

In the European Union, the very first Environmental Action Programmed was adopted by national government representatives in July 1973 during the first meeting of the Council of Environmental Ministers.&lt;ref&gt;Knill, C. and Liefferink, D. (2012) The establishment of EU environmental policy. In: Jordan, A.J. and C. Adelle (ed.) Environmental Policy in the European Union: Contexts, Actors and Policy Dynamics (3e).  Earthscan: London and Sterling, VA.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then an increasingly dense network of legislation has developed, which now extends to all areas of [[environmental protection]] including air pollution control, water protection and waste policy but also nature conservation and the control of chemicals, biotechnology and other industrial risks. [[EU environmental policy]] has thus become a core area of European politics.

Overall organizations are becoming more aware of their environmental risks and performance requirements. In line with the [[ISO 14001]] standard they are developing environmental policies suitable for their organization.&lt;ref&gt;Eccleston, Charles H. (2010). [https://www.amazon.com/Global-Environmental-Policy-Concepts-Principles-ebook/dp/B005H6M86Q/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1486949351&amp;sr=8-7&amp;keywords=charles+eccleston Global Environmental Policy: Concepts, Principles, and Practice]. Chapter 7. {{ISBN|978-1439847664}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This statement outlines environmental performance of the organization as well as its environmental objectives. Written by top management of the organization they document a commitment to continuous improvement and complying with legal and other requirements, such as the environmental policy objectives set by their governments.

== Environmental policy integration ==

The concept of '''environmental policy integration''' (EPI) refers to the process of integrating environmental objectives into non-environmental policy areas, such as energy, agriculture and transport, rather than leaving them to be pursued solely through purely environmental policy practices. This is oftentimes particularly challenging because of the need to reconcile global objectives and international rules with domestic needs and laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farah|first1=Paolo Davide|last2=Rossi|first2=Piercarlo|title=National Energy Policies and Energy Security in the Context of Climate Change and Global Environmental Risks: A Theoretical Framework for Reconciling Domestic and International Law Through a Multiscalar and Multilevel Approach|journal=European Energy and Environmental Law Review|date=December 2, 2011|volume=2|issue=6|pages=232–244|ssrn=1970698|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; EPI is widely recognised as one of the key elements of sustainable development. More recently, the notion of ‘climate policy integration’, also denoted as ‘mainstreaming’, has been applied to indicate the integration of climate considerations (both mitigation and adaptation) into the normal (often economically focused) activity of government.&lt;ref&gt;Taskforce on Conceptual Foundations of Earth System Governance http://www.earthsystemgovernance.net/conceptual-foundations/?page_id=144&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental policy studies==
Given the growing need for trained environmental practitioners, [[graduate school]]s throughout the world offer specialized [[professional degree]]s in environmental policy studies. While there is not a standard [[curriculum]], students typically take classes in [[policy analysis]], [[environmental science]], [[environmental law]] and [[environmental politics|politics]], [[ecology]], [[energy]], and [[natural resource management]]. Graduates of these programs are employed by [[government]]s, [[international organizations]], [[private sector]], [[think tanks]], [[universities]], and so on.

Due to the lack of standard [[nomenclature]], institutions use varying designations to refer to academic degrees they award. However, the degrees typically fall in one of four broad categories: [[master of arts]], [[master of science]], [[master of public administration]], and [[PhD]] in environmental policy. Sometimes, more specific names are used to reflect the focus of the academic program. For example, the [[Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey]] awards master of arts in international environmental policy (MAIEP) to emphasize the international orientation of the curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Monterey Institute of International Studies|url=http://www.miis.edu/academics/programs/environmentalpolicy |title=MA in International Environmental Policy |publisher=Miis.edu |accessdate=2012-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8763">'''European Architecture Student Assembly''' was founded in 1981 by architect students like Geoff Haslam and [[Richard Murphy (architect)|Richard Murphy]] and is closely related to the Winterschool concept, which organises similar events for UK students of architecture.
'''EASA''' takes place each summer in a different country, with the event usually lasting two weeks. It is organised by students of architecture for students of architecture and the concept is operated on a cooperative basis. In fall at INCM, Intermediate National Contact Meeting, the location for EASA is decided one and a half years in advance. Typically 400 students take part in the event and engage in '''workshops''', '''exhibitions''', '''lectures''' and social events loosely based around a specific theme. These events are run by a combination of academics and students and encompass a wide variety of activities with a greater or lesser relationship to architecture. The event is funded through a combination of attendance fees (which vary for each country based upon ability to pay), grants and sponsorship, all arranged by the organising committee for each event.

'''EASA''' has little or no formal structure in that each event is organised as a unique occurrence- though a system of '''National Contacts''', '''NC's''', that ensures, that the event each year is well supported. NC's also typically meet once a year to discuss the previous '''EASA''' and prepare for the next. Students come from over 40 European countries to the event each year. Recent Assemblies have seen students participating from the USA, India and Central American countries.

The '''INCM''' is held every year in autumn. They are the main event next to the assembly to keep the continuity of easa. There have been such memorable meetings like Berlin 1990, where the "Lichterfelder statement" was made. The "Lichterfelder Statement" later became the "easa-guide" developed, which is updated yearly at the NC-meetings.

===SESAM (Small European Architecture Students Assembly Meeting)===
The '''SESAM''' is an event arranged by the '''EASA''' network. Like the basic idea of the '''EASA''', a '''SESAM''' can give an addition and/or alternative to the education of the students. The independence and off-university-character creates an informal atmosphere. The '''SESAM''' is a '''workshop''' with a small number of participants. Through this concentrated character the '''SESAM''' allows to work on a tight theme. After a number of similar events in the year before in Italy, the [[Netherlands]], [[Czechoslovakia]], etc., the first '''EASA''' workshop with the name '''SESAM''' was realized 1992 in [[Villafames]]  (Valencia, Spain, October 1992, 50 participants). SESAM2007 was held in [[Aarhus]], [[Denmark]] on 23–25 November 2007.

===Pivo SESAM ===
The event is an excuse to meet with the other members of the network. It usually takes place during the New Year celebrations.

==EASA Newspaper: Umbrella==
Each year, during '''EASA''', one of the workshops is dedicated to cover the event by reporting about events and workshops in a newspaper-like fashion. This workshop and hence the newspaper is typically called umbrella, or variation of the local word for umbrella. This newspaper is usually published on a daily basis and has been an integral part of '''EASA''' since the early 1980s. In recent years, The Umbrella Workshop has also embraced new media, and has run EASA TV during the event. In 2009 EASA TV was a workshop of its own for the first time, but with integral co-operation with Umbrella.

==EASA TV==
EASA.TV tries to cover as much of the assembly as possible and the material is then edited, screened on site at the assembly and uploaded online. The participants will learn how to plan episodes, write scripts, draw storyboards, record with DSLR cameras and edit and export with software such as Adobe Premiere Pro. But most of all they will get the chance to document the very essence of EASA, the EASA spirit. Since 2007

==EASA FM==
EASA FM is a temporary radio station that was started in EASA011, Cadiz/Spain.

[[File:CEA logo nouveau.svg|thumb|Former logo of CEA]]
The French '''Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission''' or '''CEA''' ([[French language|French]]: [[:fr:Commissariat à l'énergie atomique et aux énergies alternatives|Commissariat à l'énergie atomique et aux énergies alternatives]]), is a [[France|French]] public government-funded research organisation in the areas of energy, defense and security, information technologies and health technologies. The CEA maintains a cross-disciplinary culture of engineers and researchers, building on the synergies between fundamental and technological research.

CEA is headed by a board headed by the general administrator (currently François Jacq since April 20, 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cea.fr/presse/Pages/actualites-communiques/institutionnel/nomination-francois-jacq-administrateur-general-cea.aspx|title=François Jacq est nommé Administrateur général du CEA}}&lt;/ref&gt;), advised by the high-commissioner for atomic energy (currently [[Yves Bréchet]]). The missions of the CEA are equivalent to those of the [[United States Department of Energy]]. Its yearly budget amounts to 4.7 billion euros and its permanent staff is slightly under 16,000 persons.&lt;ref name=CEA-website/&gt; It owns [[Areva]].

CEA was created in 1945; since then, the successive high-commissioners have been [[Frédéric Joliot-Curie]], [[Francis Perrin]], [[Jacques Yvon]], [[Jean Teillac]], [[Raoul Dautry]], [[René Pellat]], [[Bernard Bigot]], and [[Daniel Verwaerde]].

It conducts fundamental and applied research into many areas, including the design of [[nuclear reactor]]s, the manufacturing of [[integrated circuits]], the use of [[radionucleide]]s for curing illnesses, [[seismology]] and [[tsunami]] propagation, the safety of [[computer|computerized systems]], etc.

It has one of the [[TOP500|top 100]] [[supercomputer]]s in the world, the ''[[Tera-100]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.top500.org/system/176928|title=Tera-100 - Bull bullx super-node S6010/S6030 {{!}} TOP500 Supercomputer Sites|website=www.top500.org|access-date=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; TERA 100, first system designed and built in Europe to reach the petaflops in 2010, was ranked in 5th position in the worldwide TOP 500.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.top500.org/site/47593|title=Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique (CEA) {{!}} TOP500 Supercomputer Sites|website=www.top500.org|access-date=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bull.com/tera-1000-cea-completes-first-milestone-towards-exascale|title=TERA 1000: CEA completes first milestone towards Exascale|date=2015-11-12|newspaper=Welcome|access-date=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; CEA is now building TERA-1000 which is a key step in the implementation of their [[Exascale computing|Exascale]] program for the computing needs that CEA would face by 2020.

== Organisation ==

CEA is divided into 5 ''directions'', or divisions:

=== The division of nuclear energy (DEN) ===

=== The division of [[technology|technological]] research (DRT) ===
The CEA Tech&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.drt-cea.com/accueil.htm|title=CEA Tech division|last=|first=|date=|website=en.drt-cea.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; division is based on a strong scientific, industrial and academic environment and is distributed in two site of CEA at Saclay and Grenoble. The CEA Tech is focused on cutting the edge of the technological research and development in the field of energy, IT and health care information. It provides an active role in transferring the knowledge and research ideas into the industry.

The CEA Tech division is further divided into three labs:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8402">{{sociology}}
'''Historical sociology''' is a branch of [[sociology]] focusing on how [[society|societies]] develop through [[history]]. It looks at how [[social structures]] that many regard as natural are in fact shaped by complex social processes. The structure in turn shapes institutions and organizations, which affect the society - resulting in phenomena ranging from [[gender bias]] and [[income inequality]] to [[war]].

Contemporary historical sociology is primarily concerned with how the [[State (polity)|state]] has developed since the [[Middle Ages]], analysing relations between states, classes, economic and political systems.

==Use of history in sociology==
As time has passed, history and sociology have developed into two different specific academic disciplines. Historical data was used and is used today in mainly these three ways.  The first one is: Examining a theory through a Parallel investigation. To correspond with the natural-science conceptions of laws, and to look at, or apply various historical material where you gather your resources in order to prove the theory that is applied. Or on the other hand sociologists for the parallel investigation theory could apply the theory to certain cases of investigation but in a different modalities of a more widely used process. The second theory that sociologists mainly use: applying and contrasting certain events or policies. Analysed by their specific, or what makes them in unique quality of a composition, certain events used by the sociologist for comparative data can be contrasted and compared. For interpretive sociologists it is very common for them to use the 'Verstehen' tradition. And lastly, the third way sociologists typically relate is by taking a look at the causalities from a macro point of view. This is Mill's method: " a) principle of difference: a case with effect and cause present is contrasted with a case with effect and cause absent; and b) principle of agreement: cases with same effects are compared in terms of their (ideally identical) causes. There is an important debate on the usefulness of Mill's method for sociological research, which relates to the fact that historical research is often based on only few cases and that many sociological theories are probabilistic, not deterministic.&lt;ref&gt;Deflem, Mathieu. 2007. "Comparative and Historical Sociology: Lecture Notes." &lt;http://deflem.blogspot.com/2007/08/comparative-and-historical-sociology.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Today, historical sociology is measured by a conjunction of questions that are rich in detail.&lt;ref&gt;Clemens, Elizabeth S. "Toward a Historicized Sociology: Theorizing Events, Processes, and Emergence." EBSCOhost. Web. Oct.-Nov. 2010. &lt;http://ezp.tccd.edu:2321/ehost/detail?vid=3&amp;hid=119&amp;sid=cd26f66e-45f2-493d-804f-c67b713823ae%40sessionmgr114&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#db=pbh&amp;AN=26613934&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Path dependence==
[[Path dependence]] to some sociologists is the theory that events that happened in past, have some or a lot of influence on events that happen in the future. However, sociologist James Mahoney has a different definition of path dependence. His theory suggests that "process, sequence, and temporality" have a valid reason for affecting path dependence and the meaning of past historical events. There are three path-dependent analyses with an explanation to how each theory works. "1) the study of causal processes that are especially sensitive, in a sequence, to early historical events, which are more important than later events; 2) these events are contingent occurrences that cannot be explained by prior events or initial conditions; and 3) that once contingent events take place, the path dependent sequence becomes a deterministic pattern."&lt;ref&gt;Mahoney, James. "Path Dependence in Historical Sociology." Welcome to the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of South Carolina. 2007. Web. 2 Nov. 2010. &lt;http://www.cas.sc.edu/socy/faculty/deflem/zcomphistnotes.html#problems&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate over general theory in sociology==
James Mahoney revisited the debate over general theory in historical sociology. By bridging the gaps of different assumptions, causal agents and causal mechanisms are connected to the empirical analysis, and this is seen as the general theory.
{{quote|... the debate over general theory in historical sociology with the goal of clarifying the use of this kind of theory in empirical research. General theories are defined as postulates about causal agents and causal mechanisms that are linked to empirical analysis through bridging assumptions. These theories can contribute to substantive knowledge by helping analysts derive new hypotheses, integrate existing findings, and explain historical outcomes. To illustrate these applications, the article considers five different general theories that have guided or could guide historical sociology: functionalist, rational choice, power, neo-Darwinian, and cultural theories. A key conclusion that emerges is that scholars must evaluate both the overall merits of general theory and the individual merits of specific general theories&lt;ref&gt;Mahoney, James.

{{Anthropology }}

'''History of anthropology'scientific word during the [[Renaissance]], has always meant "the study (or science) of man". The topics to be included and the terminology have varied historically. At present they are more elaborate than they were during the development of anthropology. For a presentation of modern social and cultural anthropology as they have developed in Britain, France, and North America since approximately 1900, see the relevant sections under [[Anthropology]].

==Etymology==
The term ''[[wiktionary:anthropology|anthropology]]'' ostensibly is a produced compound of [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἄνθρωπος}} ''anthrōpos'', "human being" (understood to mean "humankind" or "humanity"), and a supposed -λογία ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]]'', "study".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=-logy | work=Online Etymological Dictionary | url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=-logy&amp;allowed_in_frame=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The compound, however, is unknown in ancient Greek or Latin, whether classical or mediaeval. It first appears sporadically in the scholarly Latin ''anthropologia'' of Renaissance France, where it spawns the French word ''anthropologie'', transferred into English as anthropology. It does belong to a class of words produced with the [[-logy]] suffix, such as archeo-logy, bio-logy, etc., "the study (or science) of".

The mixed character of Greek ''anthropos'' and Latin ''-logia'' marks it as [[New Latin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=-logy | encyclopedia=Webster's Third New International Dictionary Unabridged and Seven Language Dictionary | volume=II H to R | publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. | year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no independent noun, logia, however, of that meaning in classical Greek. The word λόγος ([[logos]]) has that meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Liddell|Scott|1940|loc=[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dlo%2Fgos logos]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Hunt (speech therapist)|James Hunt]] attempted to rescue the etymology in his first address to the [[Anthropological Society of London]] as president and founder, 1863. He did find an ''anthropologos'' from Aristotle in the standard [[A Greek–English Lexicon|ancient Greek Lexicon]], which he says defines the word as "speaking or treating of man".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hunt|1863|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view is entirely wishful thinking, as Liddell and Scott go on to explain the meaning: "i.e. fond of personal conversation".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Liddell|Scott|1940|loc=[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aalphabetic+letter%3D*a%3Aentry+group%3D178%3Aentry%3Da%29nqrwpolo%2Fgos anthropologos]}}&lt;/ref&gt; If Aristotle, the very philosopher of the logos, could produce such a word without serious intent, there probably was at that time no anthropology identifiable under that name.

The lack of any ancient denotation of anthropology, however, is not an etymological problem. Liddell and Scott list 170 Greek compounds ending in ''–logia'', enough to justify its later use as a productive suffix.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Liddell|Scott|1940|loc=[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/resolveform?type=end&amp;lookup=logia&amp;lang=greek logia]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Greeks often used suffixes in forming compounds that had no independent variant.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buck|1933|p=359}}&lt;/ref&gt; The etymological dictionaries are united in attributing ''–logia'' to ''logos'', from ''legein'', "to collect". The thing collected is primarily ideas, especially in speech. The [[American Heritage Dictionary]] says:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=leg- | encyclopedia=[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]] | edition=4th | chapter=Appendix I: Indo-European Roots | year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; "(It is one of) derivatives independently built to logos." Its morphological type is that of an abstract noun: log-os &gt; log-ia (a "qualitative abstract")&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buck|1933|p=347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Renaissance]] origin of the name of anthropology does not exclude the possibility that ancient authors presented anthropogical material under another name (see below). Such an identification is speculative, depending on the theorist's view of anthropology; nevertheless, speculations have been formulated by credible anthropologists, especially those that consider themselves [[Structural functionalism|functionalists]] and others in history so classified now.

==The science of history==
[[Marvin Harris]], a historian of anthropology, begins ''The Rise of Anthropological Theory'' with the statement that anthropology is "the science of history".&lt;ref name=Harris1&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|2001|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is not suggesting that [[history]] be renamed to anthropology, or that there is no distinction between history and [[prehistory]], or that anthropology excludes current social practices, as the general meaning of history, which it has in "history of anthropology", would seem to imply. He is using "history" in a special sense, as the founders of [[cultural anthropology]] used it:&lt;ref&gt;There is currently some regional and traditional equivocation about whether it should be called culture history, as in [[cultural anthropology]]; i.e., [[Culture-historical archaeology]], or [[social history]], as in [[social anthropology]], or the compromise, [[sociocultural anthropology]]. Different theorists have different practices, the distinctions being mainly verbal.&lt;/ref&gt; "the natural history of society", in the words of [[Herbert Spencer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|2001|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the "universal history of mankind", the 18th-century [[Age of Enlightenment]] objective.&lt;ref name=Harris1/&gt; Just as [[natural history]] comprises the characteristics of organisms past and present, so cultural or social history comprises the characteristics of society past and present. It includes both documented history and prehistory, but its slant is toward institutional development rather than particular non-repeatable historical events.

According to Harris, the 19th-century anthropologists were theorizing under the presumption that the development of society followed some sort of laws. He decries the loss of that view in the 20th century by the denial that any laws are discernable or that current institutions have any bearing on ancient. He coins the term ideographic for them. The 19th-century views, on the other hand, are [[nomothetic]]; that is, they provide laws. He intends "to reassert the methodological priority of the search for the laws of history in the science of man".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|2001|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is looking for "a general theory of history".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|2001|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; His perception of the laws: "I believe that the analogue of the Darwinian strategy in the realm of sociocultural phenomena is the principle of techno-environmental and techno-economic determinism", he calls [[Cultural materialism (anthropology)|cultural materialism]], which he also details in ''Cultural Materialism: The Struggle for a Science of Culture.''

Elsewhere he refers to "my theories of historical determinism", defining the latter: "By a deterministic relationship among cultural phenomena, I mean merely that similar variables under similar conditions tend to give rise to similar consequences."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|1991|pp=xii-xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of "tends to" implies some degree of freedom to happen or not happen, but in strict [[determinism]], given certain causes, the result and only that result must occur. Different philosophers, however, use determinism in different senses. The deterministic element that Harris sees is lack of human social engineering: "free will and moral choice have had virtually no significant effect upon the direction taken thus far by evolving systems of social life."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|1991|p=xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harris agrees with the 19th-century view that laws are [[abstraction]]s from [[empirical evidence]]: "...sociocultural entities are constructed from the direct or indirect observation of the behavior and thought of specific individuals&amp;nbsp;...."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|1999|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Institutions are not a physical reality; only people are. When they act in society, they do so according to the laws of history, of which they are not aware; hence, there is no historical element of free will. Like the 20th-century anthropologists in general, Harris places a high value on the empiricism, or collection of data. This function must be performed by trained observers.

He borrows terms from linguistics: just as a [[phonetics|phon-'''etic''' system]] is a description of sounds developed without regard to the meaning and structure of the language, while a [[phoneme|phon-'''emic''']] system describes the meaningful sounds actually used within the language, so anthropological data can be [[emic and etic]]. Only trained observers can avoid eticism, or description without regard to the meaning in the culture: "...&amp;nbsp;etics are in part observers' emics incorrectly applied to a foreign system...."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|1999|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; He makes a further distinction between [[Synchrony and diachrony|synchronic and diachronic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|2001|pp=75–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Synchronic ("same time") with reference to anthropological data is contemporaneous and cross-cultural. Diachronic ("through time") data shows the development of lines through time. Cultural materialism, being a "processually holistic and globally comparative scientific research strategy" must depend for accuracy on all four types of data.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|1999|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural materialism differs from the others by the insertion of culture as the effect. Different material factors produce different cultures.

Harris, like many other anthropologists, in looking for anthropological method and data before the use of the term anthropology, had little difficulty finding them among the ancient authors. The ancients tended to see players on the stage of history as ethnic groups characterized by the same or similar languages and customs: the Persians, the Germans, the Scythians, etc. Thus the term history meant to a large degree the "story" of the fortunes of these players through time. The ancient authors never formulated laws. Apart from a rudimentary [[three-age system]], the stages of history, such as are found in Lubbock, Tylor, Morgan, Marx and others, are yet unformulated.

==Proto-anthropology==
Eriksen and Nielsen use the term proto-anthropology to refer to near-anthropological writings, which contain some of the criteria for being anthropology, but not all. They classify proto-anthropology as being "travel writing or social philosophy", going on to assert "It is only when these aspects&amp;nbsp;... are fused, that is, when data and theory are brought together, that anthropology appears."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1=Thomas Hylland | last1=Eriksen | first2=Finn Sivert | last2=Nielsen | title=A History of Anthropology | edition=2nd | series=Anthropology, Culture and Society Series | location=London | publisher=Pluto Press | year=1013 | pages=10–12 | url=http://hyllanderiksen.net/History2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process began to occur in the 18th century of the [[Age of Enlightenment]].

===Classical Age===
Many anthropological writers find anthropological-quality theorizing in the works of [[Classical Greece]] and [[Classical Rome]]; for example, [[John Myres]] in ''Herodotus and Anthropology'' (1908); E. E. Sikes in ''The Anthropology of the Greeks'' (1914); [[Clyde Kluckhohn]] in ''Anthropology and the Classics'' (1961), and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Jonathan Z. | last=Smith | title=Map is Not Territory: Studies in the History of Religions | location=Chicage | publisher=University of Chicago Press | year=1993 | page=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; An equally long list may be found in French and German as well as other languages.

====Herodotus====
[[Herodotus]] was a 5th-century BC Greek historian who set about to chronicle and explain the [[Greco-Persian Wars]] that transpired early in that century. He did so in a surviving work conventionally termed ''the History'' or ''the Histories''. His first line begins: "These are the researches of Herodotus of Halicarnassus&amp;nbsp;...."

The [[Achaemenid Empire]], deciding to bring Greece into its domain, conducted a massive invasion across the [[Bosphorus]] using multi-cultural troops raised from many different locations. They were decisively defeated by the Greek city-states. Herodotus was far from interested in only the non-repeatable events. He provides ethnic details and histories of the peoples within the empire and to the north of it, in most cases being the first to do so. His methods were reading accounts, interviewing witnesses, and in some cases taking notes for himself.

These "researches" have been considered anthropological since at least as early as the late 19th century. The title, "Father of History" (''pater historiae''), had been conferred on him probably by [[Cicero]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=François | last=Hartog | title=The mirror of Herodotus : the representation of the other in the writing of history | series=New historicism, 5. | year=1988 | location=Berkeley | publisher=University of California Press | page=379}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pointing out that [[John Myres]] in 1908 had believed that Herodotus was an anthropologist on a par with those of his own day, [[James M. Redfield]] asserts: "Herodotus, as we know, was both Father of History and Father of Anthropology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=James M. | last=Redfield | title=Herodotus the Tourist | journal=Classical Philology | year=1985 | volume=80 | pages=97–118 | url=https://courses.cit.cornell.edu/class3676/secure/Redfield.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herodotus calls his method of travelling around taking notes "theorizing". Redfield translates it as "tourism" with a scientific intent. He identifies three terms of Herodotus as overlapping on culture: ''diaitia'', material goods such as houses and consumables; ''[[Ethos|ethea]]'', the mores or customs; and ''nomoi'', the authoritative precedents or [[law]]s.

====Tacitus====
The [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] historian, [[Tacitus]], wrote many of our only surviving contemporary accounts of several ancient [[Celts|Celtic]] and [[Germanic peoples]].

===Middle Ages===

Another candidate for one of the first scholars to carry out comparative ethnographic-type studies in person was the medieval [[Persian people|Persian]] scholar [[Abū Rayhān Bīrūnī]] in the eleventh century, who wrote about the peoples, customs, and religions of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. According to Akbar S. Ahmed, like modern anthropologists, he engaged in extensive [[participant observation]] with a given group of people, learnt their language and studied their primary texts, and presented his findings with [[objectivity (science)|objectivity]] and [[Neutrality (philosophy)|neutrality]] using [[Cross-cultural studies|cross-cultural comparisons]].&lt;ref name=Ahmed&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ahmed | first1 = Akbar S. | year = 1984 | title = Al-Beruni: The First Anthropologist | url = | journal = RAIN | volume = 60 | issue = 60| pages = 9–10 | doi = 10.2307/3033407 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue, however, that he hardly can be considered an anthropologist in the conventional sense.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Tapper (1995). "Islamic Anthropology" and the "Anthropology of Islam", ''Anthropological Quarterly'' '''68''' (3), Anthropological Analysis and Islamic Texts, p. 185-193.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote detailed comparative studies on the religions and cultures in the [[Middle East]], [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]], and especially [[South Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1353/jhi.1998.0030 | last1 = Walbridge | first1 = J.

Medieval scholars may be considered forerunners of modern anthropology as well, insofar as they conducted or wrote detailed studies of the customs of peoples considered "different" from themselves in terms of geography. [[John of Plano Carpini]] reported of his stay among the [[Mongols]]. His report was unusual in its detailed depiction of a non-European culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timothyjpmason.com/WebPages/Publications/Source_pages/AnthroHist.htm Resources for a History of Anthropology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231041925/http://www.timothyjpmason.com/WebPages/Publications/Source_pages/AnthroHist.htm |date=2012-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marco Polo]]'s systematic observations of nature, anthropology, and geography are another example of studying human variation across space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tk421.net/essays/polo.html Marco Polo's Asia]&lt;/ref&gt; Polo's travels took him across such a diverse human landscape and his accounts of the peoples he met as he journeyed were so detailed that they earned for Polo the name "the father of modern anthropology".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaanet.org/sections/gad/history/011rowe.pdf The Renaissance Foundations of Anthropology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904194548/http://www.aaanet.org/sections/gad/history/011rowe.pdf |date=2012-09-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance===
{{See also|Bernardino de Sahagún}}
The first use of the term "anthropology" in English to refer to a natural science of humanity was apparently in [[Richard Harvey (astrologer)|Richard Harvey's]] 1593 ''Philadelphus, a defense of the legend of Brutus in British history'', which, includes the passage: "Genealogy or issue which they had, Artes which they studied, Actes which they did. This part of History is named Anthropology."

==The Enlightenment roots of the discipline==
[[File: Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|left|220px|Immanuel Kant (1724-1804)]]

Many scholars consider modern anthropology as an outgrowth of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] (1715–89),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=8407 http://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=8407]&lt;/ref&gt; a period when Europeans attempted to study human behavior systematically, the known varieties of which had been increasing since the fifteenth century as a result of the [[first European colonization wave (15th century–19th century)|first European colonization wave]]. The traditions of [[jurisprudence]], history, [[philology]], and [[sociology]] then evolved into something more closely resembling the modern views of these disciplines and informed the development of the [[social sciences]], of which anthropology was a part.

It took [[Immanuel Kant]] (1724-1804) 25 years to write one of the first major treatises on anthropology, ''Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View'' (1798), which treats it as a branch of philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel. "Introduction" to his 1961 translation of Kant's work, reprinted, [http://www.generation-online.org/p/fpfoucault1.htm Generation-online.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Kant is not generally considered to be a modern anthropologist, as he never left his region of Germany, nor did he study any cultures besides his own.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Brian, and Kain, Patrick (eds.), Essays on Kant's Anthropology, Cambridge University Press, 2003, 278pp., {{ISBN|0-521-79038-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He did, however, begin teaching an annual course in anthropology in 1772.
Developments in the systematic study of ancient civilizations through the disciplines of [[Classics]] and [[Egyptology]] informed both archaeology and eventually social anthropology, as did the study of East and South Asian languages and cultures. At the same time, the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] reaction to the Enlightenment produced thinkers, such as [[Johann Gottfried Herder]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pitt.edu/~votruba/sstopics/slovaklawsonlanguage/Herder_on_Language.pdf | title = Herder on Language | last = Votruba | first = Martin | work = Slovak Studies Program | publisher = University of Pittsburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later [[Wilhelm Dilthey]], whose work formed the basis for the "culture concept", which is central to the discipline.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Institutionally, anthropology emerged from the development of [[natural history]] (expounded by authors such as [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]]) that occurred during the European colonization of the seventeenth, eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Programs of ethnographic study originated in this era as the study of the "human primitives" overseen by colonial administrations.

There was a tendency in late eighteenth century Enlightenment thought to understand human society as natural phenomena that behaved according to certain principles and that could be observed empirically. In some ways, studying the language, culture, physiology, and artifacts of European colonies was not unlike studying the flora and fauna of those places.

Early anthropology was divided between proponents of [[unilineal evolution|unilinealism]], who argued that all societies passed through a single evolutionary process, from the most primitive to the most advanced, and various forms of non-lineal theorists, who tended to subscribe to ideas such as [[diffusionism]].&lt;ref&gt;Stocking, George W. (1968) Race, Culture, and Evolution: Essays in the history of anthropology. London: The Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Most nineteenth-century social theorists, including anthropologists, viewed non-European societies as windows onto the pre-industrial human past.

==Overview of the modern discipline==
Marxist anthropologist [[Eric Wolf]] once characterized anthropology as "the most scientific of the humanities, and the most humanistic of the social sciences". Understanding how [[anthropology]] developed contributes to understanding how it fits into other academic disciplines.
Scholarly traditions of [[jurisprudence]], history, [[philology]] and [[sociology]] developed during this time and informed the development of the [[social sciences]] of which anthropology was a part. At the same time, the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] reaction to the Enlightenment produced thinkers such as [[Herder]] and later [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] whose work formed the basis for the culture concept which is central to the discipline.

These intellectual movements in part grappled with one of the greatest paradoxes of [[modernity]]: as the world is becoming smaller and more integrated, people's experience of the world is increasingly atomized and dispersed. As [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] observed in the 1840s:

{{Quotation|All old-established national industries have been destroyed or are daily being destroyed. They are dislodged by new industries, whose introduction becomes a life and death question for all civilized nations, by industries that no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones; industries whose products are consumed, not only at home, but in every quarter of the globe. In place of the old wants, satisfied by the production of the country, we find new wants, requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes. In place of the old local and national seclusion and self-sufficiency, we have intercourse in every direction, universal interdependence of nations.}}

Ironically, this universal interdependence, rather than leading to greater human solidarity, has coincided with increasing racial, ethnic, religious, and class divisions, and new—and to some confusing or disturbing—cultural expressions. These are the conditions of life with which people today must contend, but they have their origins in processes that began in the 16th century and accelerated in the 19th century.

Institutionally anthropology emerged from [[natural history]] (expounded by authors such as [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]]). This was the study of human beings—typically people living in European colonies. Thus studying the language, culture, physiology, and artifacts of European colonies was more or less equivalent to studying the flora and fauna of those places. It was for this reason, for instance, that [[Lewis Henry Morgan]] could write monographs on both ''The League of the Iroquois'' and ''The American Beaver and His Works''. This is also why the material culture of 'civilized' nations such as China have historically been displayed in fine arts museums alongside European art while artifacts from Africa or Native North American cultures were displayed in [[natural history museum]]s with dinosaur bones and nature dioramas. Curatorial practice has changed dramatically in recent years, and it would be wrong to see anthropology as merely an extension of colonial rule and European [[chauvinism]], since its relationship to [[imperialism]] was and is complex.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Drawing on the methods of the [[natural science]]s as well as developing new techniques involving not only structured interviews but unstructured "participant-observation"—and drawing on the new [[theory of evolution]] through [[natural selection]], they proposed the scientific study of a new object: "humankind", conceived of as a whole. Crucial to this study is the concept "culture", which anthropologists defined both as a universal capacity and propensity for social learning, thinking, and acting (which they see as a product of human evolution and something that distinguishes Homo sapiens—and perhaps all species of genus ''[[Hominoid|Homo]]''—from other species), and as a particular adaptation to local conditions that takes the form of highly variable beliefs and practices. Thus, "culture" not only transcends the opposition between nature and nurture; it transcends and absorbs the peculiarly European distinction between politics, religion, kinship, and the economy as autonomous domains. Anthropology thus transcends the divisions between the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities to explore the biological, linguistic, material, and symbolic dimensions of humankind in all forms.

==National anthropological traditions==
{{Main|History of anthropology by country}}

As academic disciplines began to differentiate over the course of the nineteenth century, anthropology grew increasingly distinct from the biological approach of natural history, on the one hand, and from purely historical or literary fields such as Classics, on the other. A common criticism was that many social sciences (such as economists, sociologists, and psychologists) in Western countries focused disproportionately on Western subjects, while anthropology focuseed disproportionately on the "other".&lt;ref&gt;Clifford, James and George E. Marcus (1986) Writing culture: the poetics and politics of ethnography. Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Britain===
Museums such as the [[British Museum]] weren't the only site of anthropological studies: with the [[New Imperialism]] period, starting in the 1870s, [[zoo]]s became unattended "laboratories", especially the so-called "ethnological exhibitions" or "Negro villages". Thus, "savages" from the colonies were displayed, often nudes, in cages, in what has been called "[[human zoos]]". For example, in 1906, Congolese [[pygmy]] [[Ota Benga]] was put by anthropologist [[Madison Grant]] in a cage in the [[Bronx Zoo]], labelled "the missing link" between an orangutan and the "white race"—Grant, a renowned [[eugenicist]], was also the author of ''[[The Passing of the Great Race]]'' (1916). Such exhibitions were attempts to illustrate and prove in the same movement the validity of [[scientific racism]], which first formulation may be found in [[Arthur de Gobineau]]'s ''[[An Essay on the Inequality of Human Races]]'' (1853–55). In 1931, the [[Colonial Exhibition]] in Paris still displayed [[Kanaks]] from [[New Caledonia]] in the "indigenous village"; it received 24&amp;nbsp;million visitors in six months, thus demonstrating the popularity of such "human zoos".

Anthropology grew increasingly distinct from natural history and by the end of the nineteenth century the discipline began to crystallize into its modern form—by 1935, for example, it was possible for T.K. Penniman to write a history of the discipline entitled ''A Hundred Years of Anthropology''. At the time, the field was dominated by 'the comparative method'. It was assumed that all societies passed through a single evolutionary process from the most primitive to most advanced. Non-European societies were thus seen as evolutionary 'living fossils' that could be studied in order to understand the European past. Scholars wrote histories of prehistoric migrations which were sometimes valuable but often also fanciful. It was during this time that Europeans first accurately traced [[Polynesia]]n migrations across the [[Pacific Ocean]] for instance—although some of them believed it originated in [[Egypt]]. Finally, the concept of [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] was actively discussed as a way to classify—and rank—human beings based on difference.

==== E.B. Tylor and James Frazer====
[[File:Edward Burnett Tylor.jpg|thumb|left|Sir E. B. Tylor (1832-1917), nineteenth-century British anthropologist]]
[[File:JamesGeorgeFrazer.jpg|thumb|right|Sir James George Frazer (1854-1941)]]

[[Edward Burnett Tylor]] (2 October 1832&amp;nbsp;– 2 January 1917) and [[James Frazer|James George Frazer]] (1 January 1854&amp;nbsp;– 7 May 1941) are generally considered the antecedents to modern [[social anthropology]] in Britain. Although Tylor undertook a field trip to [[Mexico]], both he and Frazer derived most of the material for their comparative studies through extensive reading, not [[fieldwork]], mainly the Classics (literature and history of Greece and Rome), the work of the early European folklorists, and reports from missionaries, travelers, and contemporaneous ethnologists.

Tylor advocated strongly for unilinealism and a form of "uniformity of mankind".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaanet.org/gad/history/044stocking.pdf Stocking, George Jr. (1963) "Matthew Arnold, E. B. Tylor, and the Uses of Invention", ''American Anthropologist'', 65:783-799, 1963] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071202133549/http://www.aaanet.org/gad/history/044stocking.pdf |date=2007-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tylor in particular laid the groundwork for theories of [[cultural diffusionism]], stating that there are three ways that different groups can have similar cultural forms or technologies: "independent invention, inheritance from ancestors in a distant region, transmission from one race {{sic}} to another".&lt;ref&gt;Tylor, E. B. (1865) ''Researches into the early history of mankind the development of civilization.'' London: John Murray.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tylor formulated one of the early and influential anthropological conceptions of [[culture]] as "that complex whole, which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by [humans] as [members] of society".&lt;ref&gt;Tylor, E. B. (1871) ''Primitive culture: researches into the development of mythology, philosophy, religion, art, and custom''. 2 vols. London, John Murray.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as Stocking notes, Tylor mainly concerned himself with describing and mapping the distribution of particular elements of culture, rather than with the larger function, and he generally seemed to assume a Victorian idea of progress rather than the idea of non-directional, multilineal cultural development proposed by later anthropologists.

Tylor also theorized about the origins of religious beliefs in human beings, proposing a theory of [[animism]] as the earliest stage, and noting that "religion" has many components, of which he believed the most important to be belief in supernatural beings (as opposed to moral systems, cosmology, etc.). Frazer, a Scottish scholar with a broad knowledge of Classics, also concerned himself with religion, myth, and magic. His comparative studies, most influentially in the numerous editions of ''[[The Golden Bough]]'', analyzed similarities in religious belief and symbolism globally. Neither Tylor nor Frazer, however, was particularly interested in [[fieldwork]], nor were they interested in examining how the cultural elements and institutions fit together. The Golden Bough was abridged drastically in subsequent editions after his first.

==== Bronislaw Malinowski and the British School ====
Toward the turn of the twentieth century, a number of anthropologists became dissatisfied with this categorization of cultural elements; historical reconstructions also came to seem increasingly speculative to them. Under the influence of several younger scholars, a new approach came to predominate among British anthropologists, concerned with analyzing how societies held together in the present ([[wikt:synchronic|synchronic]] analysis, rather than [[wikt:diachronic|diachronic]] or historical analysis), and emphasizing long-term (one to several years) immersion fieldwork. [[Cambridge University]] financed a [[William Rivers#Torres Straits Expedition|multidisciplinary expedition]] to the [[Torres Strait Islands]] in 1898, organized by [[Alfred Cort Haddon]] and including a physician-anthropologist, [[William Rivers]], as well as a linguist, a botanist, and other specialists. The findings of the expedition set new standards for ethnographic description.

A decade and a half later, Polish anthropology student [[Bronisław Malinowski]] (1884–1942) was beginning what he expected to be a brief period of [[fieldwork]] in the old model, collecting lists of cultural items, when the outbreak of the First World War stranded him in [[New Guinea]]. As a subject of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] resident on a British colonial possession, he was effectively confined to New Guinea for several years.&lt;ref&gt;Malinowski, Bronisław (1967) ''A diary in the strict sense of the term''. New York, Harcourt, Brace &amp; World [1967]&lt;/ref&gt;

He made use of the time by undertaking far more intensive fieldwork than had been done by ''British'' anthropologists, and his classic ethnography, ''[[Argonauts of the Western Pacific]]'' (1922) advocated an approach to [[fieldwork]] that became standard in the field: getting "the native's point of view" through [[participant observation]]. Theoretically, he advocated a [[Structural functionalism|functionalist]] interpretation, which examined how social institutions functioned to satisfy individual needs.

British social anthropology had an expansive moment in the [[Interwar period]], with key contributions coming from the Polish-British [[Bronisław Malinowski]] and [[Meyer Fortes]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Goody]] (1995) ''[http://www3.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521450489 The Expansive Moment: The Rise of Social Anthropology in Britain and Africa, 1918-1970] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071106055917/http://www3.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521450489 |date=2007-11-06 }}'' review at {{jstor|646577}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[A. R. Radcliffe-Brown]] also published a seminal work in 1922. He had carried out his initial fieldwork in the [[Andaman Islands]] in the old style of historical reconstruction. However, after reading the work of French sociologists [[Émile Durkheim]] and [[Marcel Mauss]], Radcliffe-Brown published an account of his research (entitled simply ''The Andaman Islanders'') that paid close attention to the meaning and purpose of rituals and myths. Over time, he developed an approach known as [[structural functionalism]], which focused on how institutions in societies worked to balance out or create an equilibrium in the social system to keep it functioning harmoniously. (This contrasted with Malinowski's functionalism, and was quite different from the later French [[Structuralism#Structuralism in anthropology and sociology|structuralism]], which examined the conceptual structures in language and symbolism.)

Malinowski and Radcliffe-Brown's influence stemmed from the fact that they, like Boas, actively trained students and aggressively built up institutions that furthered their programmatic ambitions. This was particularly the case with Radcliffe-Brown, who spread his agenda for "Social Anthropology" by teaching at universities across the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]]. From the late 1930s until the postwar period appeared a string of monographs and edited volumes that cemented the paradigm of British Social Anthropology (BSA). Famous ethnographies include ''The Nuer,'' by [[Edward Evan Evans-Pritchard]], and ''The Dynamics of Clanship Among the Tallensi,'' by [[Meyer Fortes]]; well-known edited volumes include ''African Systems of Kinship and Marriage'' and ''African Political Systems.''

==== Post WW II trends ====
[[Max Gluckman]], together with many of his colleagues at the [[Rhodes-Livingstone Institute]] and students at [[Manchester University]], collectively known as the [[Manchester School (anthropology)|Manchester School]], took BSA in new directions through their introduction of explicitly Marxist-informed theory, their emphasis on conflicts and conflict resolution, and their attention to the ways in which individuals negotiate and make use of the social structural possibilities.

In Britain, anthropology had a great intellectual impact, it "contributed to the erosion of [[Christianity]], the growth of [[cultural relativism]], an awareness of the survival of the primitive in modern life, and the replacement of [[wikt:diachronic|diachronic]] modes of analysis with [[wikt:synchronic|synchronic]], all of which are central to modern culture."&lt;ref name="Heyck1997"&gt;Heyck, Thomas William (1997) at The American Historical Review, Vol. 102, No. 5 (December, 1997), pp. 1486–1488 {{doi|10.2307/2171126}} {{jstor|2171126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the 1960s and 1970s, [[Edmund Leach]] and his students [[Mary Douglas]] and [[Nur Yalman]], among others, introduced French structuralism in the style of [[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Lévi-Strauss]]; while British anthropology has continued to emphasize social organization and economics over purely symbolic or literary topics, differences among British, French, and American sociocultural anthropologies have diminished with increasing dialogue and borrowing of both theory and methods. Today, social anthropology in Britain engages internationally with many other social theories and has branched in many directions.

In countries of the British Commonwealth, social anthropology has often been institutionally separate from [[physical anthropology]] and [[primatology]], which may be connected with departments of biology or zoology; and from archaeology, which may be connected with departments of [[Classics]], [[Egyptology]], and the like. In other countries (and in some, particularly smaller, British and North American universities), anthropologists have also found themselves institutionally linked with scholars of [[folklore]], [[Museology|museum studies]], [[human geography]], [[sociology]], [[social relations]], [[ethnic studies]], [[cultural studies]], and [[social work]].

Anthropology has been used in Britain to provide an alternative explanation for the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010]] to the technical explanations rooted in economic and political theory. Dr. [[Gillian Tett]], a [[Cambridge University]] trained anthropologist who went on to become a senior editor at the [[Financial Times]] is one of the leaders in this use of anthropology.

===Canada===
Canadian anthropology began, as in other parts of the Colonial world, as ethnological data in the records of travellers and missionaries. In Canada, [[Jesuit]] [[Missionary|missionaries]] such as Fathers LeClercq, Le Jeune and Sagard, in the 17th century, provide the oldest ethnographic records of native tribes in what was then the Dominion of Canada. The academic discipline has drawn strongly on both the British Social Anthropology and the American Cultural Anthropology traditions, producing a hybrid "Socio-cultural" anthropology.

==== George Mercer Dawson ====
True anthropology began with a [[Government agency|Government department]]: the [[Geological Survey of Canada]], and [[George Mercer Dawson]] (director in 1895). Dawson's support for anthropology created impetus for the profession in Canada. This was expanded upon by Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier, who established a Division of Anthropology within the Geological Survey in 1910.

==== Edward Sapir ====
Anthropologists were recruited from England and the USA, setting the foundation for the unique Canadian style of anthropology. Scholars include the linguist and Boasian [[Edward Sapir]].

===France===
[[File:Emile Durkheim.jpg|thumb|[[Émile Durkheim]]]]
Anthropology in France has a less clear genealogy than the British and American traditions, in part because many French writers influential in anthropology have been trained or held faculty positions in sociology, philosophy, or other fields rather than in anthropology.

==== Marcel Mauss ====
Most commentators consider [[Marcel Mauss]] (1872–1950), nephew of the influential sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]], to be the founder of the French anthropological tradition. Mauss belonged to Durkheim's ''[[Année Sociologique]]'' group. While Durkheim and others examined the state of modern societies, Mauss and his collaborators (such as [[Henri Hubert]] and [[Robert Hertz]]) drew on ethnography and philology to analyze societies that were not as 'differentiated' as European nation states.

Two works by Mauss in particular proved to have enduring relevance: ''[[The Gift (book)|Essay on the Gift]],'' a seminal analysis of [[trade|exchange]] and [[reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]], and his Huxley lecture on the notion of the person, the first comparative study of notions of person and selfhood cross-culturally.&lt;ref&gt;Mauss, Marcel (1938) "A category of the human mind: the notion of person; the notion of self", in M. Carrithers, S. Collins, and S. Lukes, eds. ''The Category of the Person: anthropology, philosophy, history''. Pp. 1-25. Cambridge/New York: Cambridge University Press. Originally given as "Une categorie de l'Esprit Humain: La Notion de Personne, Celle de 'Moi'", for the Huxley Memorial Lecture and appeared in the ''Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute'', 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the interwar years, French interest in anthropology often dovetailed with wider cultural movements such as [[surrealism]] and [[primitivism (art movement)|primitivism]], which drew on ethnography for inspiration. [[Marcel Griaule]] and [[Michel Leiris]] are examples of people who combined anthropology with the French avant-garde. During this time most of what is known as ''ethnologie'' was restricted to museums, such as the [[Musée de l'Homme]] founded by [[Paul Rivet]], and anthropology had a close relationship with studies of [[folklore]].

==== Claude Lévi-Strauss ====
Above all, [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] helped institutionalize anthropology in France. Along with the enormous influence that his theory of [[structuralism]] exerted across multiple disciplines, Lévi-Strauss established ties with American and British anthropologists. At the same time, he established centers and laboratories within France to provide an institutional context within anthropology, while training influential students such as [[Maurice Godelier]] and [[Françoise Héritier]]. They proved influential in the world of French anthropology. Much of the distinct character of France's anthropology today is a result of the fact that most anthropology is carried out in nationally funded research laboratories ([[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|CNRS]]) rather than academic departments in universities

Other influential writers in the 1970s include [[Pierre Clastres]], who explains in his books on the [[Guayakis|Guayaki]] tribe in [[Paraguay]] that "primitive societies" actively oppose the institution of the [[state (polity)|state]]. These stateless societies are not less evolved than societies with states, but chose to conjure the institution of [[authority]] as a separate function from society. The [[Leadership|leader]] is only a spokesperson for the group when it has to deal with other groups ("international relations") but has no inside authority, and may be violently removed if he attempts to abuse this position.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomew Dean "Critical Re-vision: Clastres' Chronicle and the optic of [[primitivism]]", 2002 In ''Best of Anthropology Today, 1974–2000'', ed. J. Benthall, with a preface by M. Sahlins. London: Routledge. [https://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0415262550 Amazon.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important French social theorist since [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]] and Lévi-Strauss is [[Pierre Bourdieu]], who trained formally in philosophy and sociology and eventually held the Chair of Sociology at the Collège de France. Like Mauss and others before him, he worked on topics both in sociology and anthropology. His fieldwork among the [[Kabyle people|Kabyle]] of Algeria places him solidly in anthropology, while his analysis of the function and reproduction of fashion and cultural capital in European societies places him as solidly in sociology.

===United States===
From its beginnings in the early 19th century through the early 20th century, anthropology in the United States was influenced by the presence of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] societies. [[File:FranzBoas.jpg|thumb|right|[[Franz Boas]], one of the pioneers of modern anthropology, often called the "Father of American Anthropology"]]
[[Cultural anthropology]] in the United States was influenced greatly by the ready availability of Native American societies as ethnographic subjects. The field was pioneered by staff of the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] and the Smithsonian Institution's [[Bureau of American Ethnology]], men such as [[John Wesley Powell]] and [[Frank Hamilton Cushing]].

Late-eighteenth-century ethnology established the scientific foundation for the field, which began to mature in the United States during the presidency of [[Andrew Jackson]] (1829–1837). Jackson was responsible for implementing the Indian Removal Act, the coerced and forced removal of an estimated 100,000 American Indians during the 1830s to Indian Territory in present-day Oklahoma; for insuring that the franchise was extended to all white men, irrespective of financial means while denying virtually all black men the right to vote; and, for suppressing abolitionists' efforts to end slavery while vigorously defending that institution. Finally, he was responsible for appointing Chief Justice [[Roger B. Taney]] who would decide, in Scott v. Sandford (1857), that Negroes were "beings of an inferior order, and altogether unfit to associate with the white race&amp;nbsp;... and so far inferior that they had no rights which the white man was bound to respect". As a result of this decision, black people, whether free or enslaved, could never become citizens of the United States.

It was in this context that the so-called American School of Anthropology thrived as the champion of polygenism or the doctrine of multiple origins—sparking a debate between those influenced by the Bible who believed in the unity of humanity and those who argued from a scientific standpoint for the plurality of origins and the antiquity of distinct types. Like the monogenists, these theories were not monolithic and often used words like races, species, hybrid, and mongrel interchangeably. A scientific consensus began to emerge during this period "that there exists a Genus Homo, embracing many primordial types of 'species'". [[Charles Caldwell (physician)|Charles Caldwell]], [[Samuel George Morton]], [[Samuel A. Cartwright]], [[George Gliddon]], [[Josiah C. Nott]], and [[Louis Agassiz]], and even South Carolina Governor [[James Henry Hammond]] were all influential proponents of this school. While some were disinterested scientists, others were passionate advocates who used science to promote slavery in a period of increasing sectional strife. All were complicit in establishing the putative science that justified slavery, informed the Dred Scott decision, underpinned miscegenation laws, and eventually fueled Jim Crow. Samuel G. Morton, for example, claimed to be just a scientist but he did not hesitate to provide evidence of Negro inferiority to John C. Calhoun, the prominent pro-slavery Secretary of State to help him negotiate the annexation of Texas as a slave state.

The high-water mark of polygenic theories was Josiah Nott and Gliddon's voluminous eight-hundred page tome titled ''Types of Mankind'', published in 1854. Reproducing the work of Louis Agassiz and Samuel Morton, the authors spread the virulent and explicitly racist views to a wider, more popular audience. The first printing sold out quickly and by the end of the century it had undergone nine editions. Although many Southerners felt that all the justification for slavery they needed was found in the Bible, others used the new science to defend slavery and the repression of American Indians. Abolitionists, however, felt they had to take this science on its own terms. And for the first time, African American intellectuals waded into the contentious debate. In the immediate wake of Types of Mankind and during the pitched political battles that led to Civil War, [[Frederick Douglass]] (1818–1895), the statesman and persuasive abolitionist, directly attacked the leading theorists of the American School of Anthropology. In an 1854 address, entitled "The Claims of the Negro Ethnologically Considered", Douglass argued that "by making the enslaved a character fit only for slavery, [slaveowners] excuse themselves for refusing to make the slave a freeman.... For let it be once granted that the human race are of multitudinous origin, naturally different in their moral, physical, and intellectual capacities&amp;nbsp;... a chance is left for slavery, as a necessary institution.... There is no doubt that Messrs. Nott, Glidden, Morton, Smith and Agassiz were duly consulted by our slavery propagating statesmen" (p.&amp;nbsp;287).

==== Lewis Henry Morgan in the United States====
[[Lewis Henry Morgan]] (1818–1881), a lawyer from [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[New York (state)|New York]], became an advocate for and ethnological scholar of the [[Iroquois]]. His comparative analyses of religion, government, material culture, and especially kinship patterns proved to be influential contributions to the field of anthropology. Like other scholars of his day (such as [[Edward Tylor]]), Morgan argued that human societies could be classified into categories of cultural evolution on a scale of progression that ranged from ''savagery'', to ''barbarism'', to ''civilization''. He focused on understanding how cultures integrated and systematized, and how the various features of one culture indicate an evolutionary status in comparison with other cultures. Generally, Morgan used technology (such as bowmaking or pottery) as an indicator of position on this scale.

==== Franz Boas ====
[[Franz Boas]] established academic anthropology in the United States in opposition to this sort of evolutionary perspective. His approach was empirical, skeptical of overgeneralizations, and eschewed attempts to establish universal laws. For example, Boas studied immigrant children to demonstrate that biological race was not immutable, and that human conduct and behavior resulted from nurture, rather than nature.

Influenced by the German tradition, Boas argued that the world was full of distinct ''cultures,'' rather than societies whose evolution could be measured by how much or how little "civilization" they had. He believed that each culture has to be studied in its particularity, and argued that cross-cultural generalizations, like those made in the [[natural science]]s, were not possible.

In doing so, he fought discrimination against immigrants, blacks, and indigenous peoples of the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;Stocking, George W. (1968) ''Race, Culture, and Evolution: Essays in the history of anthropology''. London: The Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Many American anthropologists adopted his agenda for social reform, and theories of race continue to be popular subjects for anthropologists today. The so-called "Four Field Approach" has its origins in Boasian Anthropology, dividing the discipline in the four crucial and interrelated fields of sociocultural, biological, linguistic, and archaic anthropology (e.g. archaeology). Anthropology in the United States continues to be deeply influenced by the Boasian tradition, especially its emphasis on culture.
[[File:Ruth Benedict.jpg|thumb|[[Ruth Benedict]] in 1937]]

Boas used his positions at [[Columbia University]] and the [[American Museum of Natural History]] to train and develop multiple generations of students. His first generation of students included [[Alfred Kroeber]], [[Robert Lowie]], [[Edward Sapir]] and [[Ruth Benedict]], who each produced richly detailed studies of indigenous North American cultures. They provided a wealth of details used to attack the theory of a single evolutionary process. Kroeber and Sapir's focus on Native American languages helped establish [[linguistics]] as a truly general science and free it from its historical focus on [[Indo-European languages]].

The publication of [[Alfred Kroeber]]'s textbook, ''Anthropology,'' marked a turning point in American anthropology. After three decades of amassing material, Boasians felt a growing urge to generalize. This was most obvious in the 'Culture and Personality' studies carried out by younger Boasians such as [[Margaret Mead]] and [[Ruth Benedict]]. Influenced by psychoanalytic psychologists including [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Carl Jung]], these authors sought to understand the way that individual personalities were shaped by the wider cultural and social forces in which they grew up.

Though such works as ''[[Coming of Age in Samoa]]'' and ''[[The Chrysanthemum and the Sword]]'' remain popular with the American public, Mead and Benedict never had the impact on the discipline of anthropology that some expected. Boas had planned for Ruth Benedict to succeed him as chair of Columbia's anthropology department, but she was sidelined by [[Ralph Linton]], and Mead was limited to her offices at the [[American Museum of Natural History|AMNH]].

===Other countries===
Anthropology as it emerged amongst the Western colonial powers (mentioned above) has generally taken a different path than that in the countries of southern and central Europe ([[Italy]], [[Greece]], and the successors to the [[Austro-Hungarian]] and [[Ottoman empire]]s). In the former, the encounter with multiple, distinct cultures, often very different in organization and language from those of Europe, has led to a continuing emphasis on [[cross-cultural comparison]] and a receptiveness to certain kinds of cultural relativism.&lt;ref name="Spiro1987"&gt;On varieties of cultural relativism in anthropology, see Spiro, Melford E. (1987) "Some Reflections on Cultural Determinism and Relativism with Special Reference to Emotion and Reason", in ''Culture and Human Nature: theoretical papers of Melford E. Spiro''. Edited by B. Kilborne and L. L. Langness, pp. 32–58. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the successor states of continental Europe, on the other hand, anthropologists often joined with folklorists and linguists in building cultural perspectives on nationalism. Ethnologists in these countries tended to focus on differentiating among local ethnolinguistic groups, documenting local folk culture, and representing the prehistory of what has become a nation through various forms of public education (e.g., museums of several kinds).&lt;ref&gt;Gellner, Ernest. (1998) ''Language and solitude: Wittgenstein, Malinowski, and the Habsburg dilemma''. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this scheme, Russia occupied a middle position. On the one hand, it had a large region (largely east of the Urals) of highly distinct, pre-industrial, often non-literate peoples, similar to the situation in the Americas. On the other hand, Russia also participated to some degree in the nationalist (cultural and political) movements of Central and Eastern Europe. After the Revolution of 1917, views expressed by anthropologists in the USSR, and later the Soviet Bloc countries, were highly shaped by the requirement to conform to Marxist theories of social evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Gellner, Ernest, ed. (1980) ''Soviet and Western anthropology''. New York: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Greece, there was since the 19th century a science of the [[folklore]] called ''laographia'' (laography), in the form of "a science of the interior", although theoretically weak; but the connotation of the field deeply changed after World War II, when a wave of Anglo-American anthropologists introduced a science "of the outside".&lt;ref&gt;Geneviève Zoïa, "L'anthropologie en Grèce", Terrain, Numéro 14—L'incroyable et ses preuves (mars 1990), [En ligne], mis en ligne le 7 octobre 2005, [http://terrain.revues.org/document3641.html Terrain.revues.org], Consulté le 15 juin 2007. {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Italy, the development of [[ethnology]] and related studies did not receive as much attention as other branches of learning&lt;ref&gt;Grottanelli, Vinigi ''Ethnology and/or Cultural Anthropology in Italy: Traditions and Developments (and Comments and Reply)''. Other authors: Giorgio Ausenda, Bernardo Bernardi, Ugo Bianchi, [[Y. Michal Bodemann]], Jack Goody, Allison Jablonko, David I. Kertzer, Vittorio Lanternari, Antonio Marazzi, Roy A. Miller, Jr., Laura Laurencich Minelli, David M. Moss, Leonard W. Moss, H. R. H. Prince Peter of Greece and Denmark, Diana Pinto, Pietro Scotti, Tullio Tentori. ''[[Current Anthropology]]'', Vol. 18, No. 4 (December, 1977), pp. 593–614 {{jstor|2741501}}&lt;/ref&gt;, but nonetheless included important researchers and thinkers like [[Ernesto De Martino]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bookrags.com/research/de-martino-ernesto-eorl-04/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Germany]] and [[Norway]] are the countries that showed the most division and conflict between scholars focusing on domestic socio-cultural issues and scholars focusing on "other" societies.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}. Some German and Austrian scholars have increased cultural anthropology as both legal anthropology regarding "other" societies and anthropology of Western civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Fikentscher: "Law and Anthropology: Outlines, Issues, and Suggestions", Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, C.H.

The development of [[World Anthropologies|world anthropologies]] has followed different trajectories.

==20th-century developments==
In the mid-20th century, American anthropology began to study its own history more systematically. In 1967 [[Marvin Harris]] published his ''The Rise of Anthropological Theory'', presenting argumentative examinations of anthropology's historical developments, and [[George W. Stocking, Jr.]], established the historicist school, examining the historical contexts of anthropological movements.

'''Indian Veterinary Research Institute''' ('''IVRI''') is located at [[Izatnagar]], [[Bareilly]] in [[Uttar Pradesh]] state.  It is [[India]]'s premier advanced research facility in the field of [[veterinary medicine]] and allied branches.  It has regional campuses at [[Mukteshwar]], [[Bangalore]], [[Palampur]], [[Bhopal]], [[Kolkata]] and [[Srinagar]].  Formerly known as Imperial Bacteriological Laboratory, it was renamed in 1925 as Imperial Veterinary Research Institute. The name of the Institute was changed following independence to Indian Veterinary Research Institute.  Administrative control of the Institute is currently under [[Indian Council of Agricultural Research|Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR)]], [[New Delhi]]. The Ministry of Education, Govt. of India on the recommendation of University Grants Commission conferred the status of the [[Deemed university|Deemed]] to be University on 16 November 1983 under Section 3 of UGC Act 1956.
It has recently started its UG education in 2015 with 20 seats.

The '''Institute of Bioinformatics and Applied Biotechnology (IBAB)''' is a non-profit autonomous institute set up by the Department of IT, BT and S&amp;T, Government of Karnataka. It is located in a 20-acre campus in the southern part of the City of Bengaluru and is a part of Biotech Park. Its mission is to help grow the biotech industry and, to fulfill this mission, it has adopted the strategies of education, research and promoting entrepreneurship.

==History==

The [http://www.bangaloreitbt.in/ Department of Information Technology and Biotechnology of the Government of Karnataka] established the institute in 2001, with financial support from ICICI Bank. The institute has received overwhelming support from academic and industry scientists, primarily those in Bengaluru. Its programmes would not be possible without this ongoing support.

IBAB's first Director, Prof. Manju Bansal, is a professor at the [[Indian Institute of Science]], [[Bengaluru]]. She was with the institute for the first three years. She was succeeded by Prof. N. Yathindra of the [[University of Madras]] in the year 2004. He served as the Director of IBAB until February, 2018. Dr. Hosahalli Subramanya is the current Director of IBAB, since February, 2018.

Originally located at the [http://www.itpbangalore.com International Tech Park], IBAB moved to its own campus in the Biotech Park, Electronic City in Bengaluru in June 2009. The two-storeyed academic block of the new campus has (in its first phase) 30,000 sq ft. There is a three-storeyed men's hostel, which can accommodate almost 100 students, and a dining block. The lady students moved into their spacious new 4-storeyed hostel on 20 March 2015. In addition, a neighbouring 40,000 sq. ft. life science and med-tech incubator  hosted its first incubatee in December 2015. It currently has about 40 startups on its premises.

==Funding support==

The institute continues to be supported by the Government of Karnataka's Department of IT, BT and S&amp;T. It has been funded under DST's FIST programme, and has received research funding from the MeitY, Department of Biotechnology and Department of Science &amp; Technology, all of the Government of India. It has been recognized as a Centre of Excellence of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India.

Most recently the institute has received generous funding from the Infosys Foundation to fund the Infosys Chair. In the past, the institute has received faculty chairs from AstraZeneca Research Foundation, [http://www.biocon.com Biocon] and Merck &amp; Co. and has also been funded by the [http://www.wadhwani-foundation.org Wadhwani Foundation] and Institut Merieux. IBAB has received scholarship support from the Government of Karnataka, Accelrys, Merck &amp; Co, Millipore, Sartorius, [http://www.strandls.com Strand Life Sciences] and an anonymous donor. Sudha Murty of the [http://www.infosys.com/infosys_foundation Infosys Foundation] has endowed medals to two of the best students of the graduating bioinformatics class each year, and a scholarship in the name of Purnima Chaudhury.  Several companies and individuals have supported the students' entrepreneurship activities.

==Education==

The institute offered a Postgraduate Diploma in Bioinformatics (starting in 2002), and Biotechniques (since 2003). The bioinformatics course involved 12 months of classes and, in the third term, a six-month internship placement in industry or academia. The biotechniques course involved eight months of coursework and an optional six-month research project. These courses have now been stopped.

Starting in August 2011, IBAB offered an M.Sc. degree in 'Bioinformatics and Biotechnology', recognized by [[IGNOU]], New Delhi. The affiliation of the M.Sc. program was changed to [[Mysore University]] starting from  2013 and subsequently to [[Bangalore University]] from 2018.   IBAB has an ongoing Ph.D program in affiliation with MAHE, Manipal and TDU, Bangalore.

IBAB offers short term courses on Data Analytics, Omics and Next Generation Sequencing frequently.

The institute has an excellent record in placing its students in various companies (about 95% of its graduating students have been placed in the past). Details of student's placement are available at http://www.ibab.ac.in/index.php/placements/.

==Research==

Research work by the faculty has led to bioinformatics tools, such as ExPrimer for primer design. It has also led to several publications in international journals such as ''Cell'', ''Nature Biotechnology'', ''Nucleic Acids Research'', ''PLoS One'', ''Journal of Medicinal Chemistry'', ''Journal of Biological Chemistry'', ''BMC Genomics'', ''Bioinformatics'', ''Drug Discovery Today'' and ''FEBS Journal''. Eight articles in the area of bio-business have appeared in [http://www.currentscience.ac.in ''Current Science''].

==GANIT Labs, Bio-IT Centre==
IBAB, in collaboration with [http://www.strandls.com Strand Life Sciences], has set up [http://www.ganitlabs.in GANIT Labs, Bio-IT Centre], a not-for-profit centre in  2011 that is dedicated to Functional Genomics, Next Generation Sequencing and Computational Biology. housed at IBAB, the Centre was headed by Dr. Binay Panda. The Centre's initial funding came from the MeitY, Government of India and Department of IT, BT and S&amp;T, Government of Karnataka. Various projects at the Centre are funded by Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Department of Science and Technology (DST) and Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), all Government of India agencies.

GANIT Labs worked on several India-centric projects, namely sequencing and analysis of diseases prevalent in India, and sequencing and analysis of species that are of particular interest to India and have tremendous biotechnological potential. In late 2011, GANIT Labs announced the sequencing of [[Azadirachta indica|neem]]. Besides these, the Centre is working on several other subjects, including sequencing of other complex higher organisms, developing bioinformatics and computational pipeline for massive amount of sequencing data. 

Since 2017, the facility has been integrated into IBAB, as Bio-IT Centre. The Bio-IT center, comprises state-of-the-art facility for NGS with the high throughput sequencer Hi Seq 2500, which can generate 480-500GB data in 10 days equivalent to sequencing 6 human genomes at 30X coverage. Other equipment in the facility include Hi-Scan (Illumina bead-array) for genotyping and Ion-torrent for NGS and Qubit, C-bot, Covaris, Bio-analyzer and Tape-station for the processing of DNA and RNA samples. The Bio-IT centre  provides service to the scientific community in a collaborative program mode or on a purely service basis. 

==Promoting entrepreneurship==

In 2004, the institute received a grant from the [http://wadhwani-foundation.org/ Wadhwani Foundation] to promote entrepreneurship. It has since become a partner of the Foundation. The bioinformatics students took a course in entrepreneurship. In addition, the institute does research in the areas of patents and company formation.

Several companies have availed the incubation services of IBAB, including [http://www.cellworksgroup.com CellWorks Group], Symbiosis Biowares, Novozymes R&amp;D, [http://www.shodhaka.com Shodhaka Life Sciences], Ixora Biosciences, BioCOS Life Sciences, Geniron Biolabs, Microtest Innovations, MIR Life Sciences, DeNovo BioLabs, Privils, String Bio, Omix R&amp;D Laboratories, Pentavalent, Indoor Biotechnologies, Techsicon Biotech and Plasmatech Solutions.

'''International Center for Materials Nanoarchitectonics''' ('''MANA''' from ''MAterials NanoArchitectonics'') is a special research unit established in 2007 at the [[National Institute for Materials Science]] (NIMS) within the [http://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-toplevel/ World Premier International (WPI)] Research Center Initiative by the Japan [[Society for the Promotion of Science]] (JSPS).

== Members ==

MANA brings together outstanding researchers from [[Japan]] and other countries to conduct research at NIMS. The organizations providing foreign researchers are named "satellites" and currently include 

*[[University of Cambridge]] (UK)
*[[University of California]] (US)
*[[Georgia Institute of Technology]] (US)
*[[CNRS]] (France)
*[[University of Tsukuba]] (Japan)
*[[Tokyo University of Science]] (Japan) and
*[[Hokkaido University]] (Japan).

MANA [http://www.nims.go.jp/mana/about/advisor/index.html advisors] include [[Nobel Prize]] laureates [[Harold Kroto]] and [[Heinrich Rohrer]], as well as other prominent scientists ([[C. N. R. Rao]], [[Galen D. Stucky]], etc.) and industry leaders (L. Schlapbach, CEO of [[Empa]]). 

MANA [http://www.nims.go.jp/mana/members/principal_investigator/index.html members] include such recognized scientists as [[Omar M. Yaghi]], [[Christoph Gerber]], [[James Gimzewski]], [[Mark Welland]] and others. 

MANA currently (September 2008) employs only several tens members,
originating from at least 9 countries (Japan, UK, US, China, India, Russia, France, Italy and Sweden). However, the number of employees is planned to increase up to about 200.

== Purpose and structure ==

The purpose of establishing MANA is very unusual for a scientific institution in a way that a relatively small unit (MANA, about 50 employees) is put forward to lead the research of a large scientific body (NIMS, about 1500 employees). In fact, MANA is considered as a mechanism of [http://www.nims.go.jp/mana/about/ourgoal/sysreform.html reorganization] of the whole research system of NIMS. Consequently, best young scientists from all over the world are hired to conduct research, and the elite senior scientists are invited to guide them. Despite very young age of MANA, important results have already been obtained and published in major journals, such as [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] and [[Science (journal)|Science]], and more are expected to come in the nearest future. 

Another unusual feature of MANA is that although it is located in Japan and most its employees are Japanese, its primary language is English. This feature reflects the initiative of NIMS to become a leading and truly international scientific center.

== Research directions ==

The research directions of MANA are based on the concept named [[nanoarchitectonics]] - a technology allowing to manipulate a group of atoms or molecules. Consequently, much effort is devoted to the synthesis and characterization of various [[nanomaterials]] and [[nanostructures]] with the results published in the main scientific journals and the [http://www.nims.go.jp/mana/research/index.html MANA research] and [http://www.nims.go.jp/mana/news/index.html MANA news] pages.

== Scientific cooperation ==
In September 2008, MANA embarked on a new program of scientific cooperation with the [[Yonsei University]] in [[Seoul]], [[Korea]].  The exchange of researchers and research information between the two institutions is projected as a crucial factor in collaborative research on the development and evaluation of sustainable chemical technology and nano-biofusion technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nims.go.jp/eng/wnew/080901/index.html  "MANA signed a cooperation agreement with Yonsei University, Korea,"] ''News at MINS.'' September 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2372">'''Interpret Scotland''' is an inter-agency initiative between [[Scotland|Scottish]] organisations concerned with [[heritage interpretation]]. It was begun in 1997 and its key aims are to :

* Improve the quality and quantity of interpretation in Scotland
* Promote the co-ordination of interpretation at local and strategic level
* Share resources, expertise and experience to avoid duplicating effort

The Interpret Scotland journal, which is published twice a year, has been running since 2000 and includes articles on all facets of interpretation. Interpret Scotland can be credited with raising awareness of professional heritage interpretation within Scotland, particularly through inter-agency support and networking.

Together with the [[Association for Heritage Interpretation]], Interpret Scotland established a steering group which planned and carried out [[The Vital Spark Interpretation Conference]].

== List of members ==

The Interpret Scotland steering group has expanded over the years and currently consists of :-

* Association for Scottish Visitor Attractions
* [[Council for Scottish Archaeology]]
* [[Forestry Commission]] Scotland
* [[Highlands and Islands Enterprise]]
* [[Historic Scotland]]
* [[Museums Galleries Scotland]]
* [[National Archives of Scotland]]
* [[National Galleries of Scotland]]

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Morrison-color.jpg|thumb|upright=2.0|Indiana University's Morrison Hall where the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction is housed.]] --&gt;

== History ==

=== Formation ===
The origins of the Kinsey Institute lie in the scientific research of [[Indiana University]] professor and entomologist turned sexuality researcher, [[Alfred Kinsey]].  The 1947 creation of the nonprofit institute, originally named the Institute for Sex Research (ISR), was supported by both Indiana University president [[Herman B Wells]] and the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], a major financial backer of Kinsey’s research. The ISR was established to protect and preserve the confidentiality of Kinsey’s data and research materials by creating a secure, permanent repository for them.&lt;ref&gt;Gathorne-Hardy, Jonathon. Sex the Measure of All Things : A Life of Alfred C. Kinsey. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2000. Print.; 249&lt;/ref&gt;

Alfred Kinsey was director of the institute from 1947 until his death in 1956. Since then, the institute has had six directors: [[Paul Gebhard]] PhD (1956–1982), June Reinisch PhD (1982–1993), Stephanie Sanders PhD (interim director, 1993–1995), [[John Bancroft (sexologist)|John Bancroft]] MD (1994–2004), [[Julia Heiman]] PhD (2004–2014), and [[C. Sue Carter]] (2014-present).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/about/previous.html |title=previous directors |publisher=Kinseyinstitute.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140409004717/http://kinseyinstitute.org/about/previous.html |archivedate=2014-04-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kinsey's directorship (1947–1956) ===
Shortly after the ISR’s establishment, Kinsey’s interview based research was published in the 1948 bestselling&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, Vern L. Science in the Bedroom: A History of Sex Research. New York: Basic Books, 1994. Print ; 181.&lt;/ref&gt;  book, ''Sexual Behavior in the Human Male''.&lt;ref&gt;Kinsey, Alfred C., Wardell B. Pomeroy, and Clyde E. Martin. Sexual Behavior in the Human Male. Philadelphia: W.B. Saunders Co., 1948. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Its companion ''Sexual Behavior in the Human Female'' was published 5 years later.&lt;ref&gt;Research, Institute for Sex. Sexual Behavior in the Human Female. Philadelphia: Saunders, 1953. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; These books were popularly known as the “[[Kinsey Reports]]”.&lt;ref&gt;Gathorne-Hardy, Jonathon. Sex the Measure of All Things : A Life of Alfred C. Kinsey. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2000. Print; 274.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in 1950, research materials being shipped to the ISR were seized by U.S. Customs thereby resulting in the federal court case U.S. vs. 31 photographs. This case continued on after Kinsey’s death, until it was finally settled in the institute’s favor in 1957.  The ruling granted ISR permission to import erotic materials for research purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, Kenneth R. "United States V. 31 Photographs: Dr. Alfred C. Kinsey and Obscenity Law." Indiana Magazine of History 71.4 (1975): 299-318. Print ; 299-300.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gebhard's directorship (1956–1982) ===
Under Paul Gebhard's leadership, the interview based research project continued, resulting in the publication of ''[[Pregnancy, Birth and Abortion]]''&lt;ref&gt;Gebhard, Paul H., Wardell B. Pomeroy, and Clyde E. Martin. "Pregnancy, Birth and Abortion ". New York: Harper, 1958. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Sex Offenders (1965 book)|Sex Offenders: An Analysis of Types]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Research, Institute for Sex.

Print.&lt;/ref&gt; and Alan Bell and Martin Weinberg’s ''[[Homosexualities: A Study of Diversity Among Men and Women]]''.&lt;ref name="Rice"&gt;{{cite book |author=Rice, Lee C. |editor=Soble, Alan |title=The Philosophy of Sex: Contemporary Readings |publisher=Littlefield, Adams &amp; Co |location=Totowa, New Jersey |year=1980 |page=280 |isbn=0-8226-0351-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in response to criticism that Kinsey’s original data was biased and not well defined, Gebhard and Johnson wrote ''The Kinsey Data: Marginal Tabulations of the 1938-1963 Interviews''.&lt;ref&gt;Gebhard, Paul, and Alan Blaine Johnson. The Kinsey Data : Marginal Tabulations of the 1938-1963 Interviews Conducted by the Institute for Sex Research Philadelphia: Saunders, 1979. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  To honor its founder, the Institute for Sex Research was renamed The Kinsey Institute for Sex Research in 1981.&lt;ref name="kinseyinstitute1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/library/kiarchives.html |title=Library &amp; Special Collections&amp;#93; |publisher=The Kinsey Institute |date= |accessdate=2014-04-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429195952/http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/library/kiarchives.html |archivedate=2014-04-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== June Reinisch's directorship (1982–1993) ===
When [[June Machover Reinisch]] became the new director, the name of the institute changed to The Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction, in order to better reflect its expanded mission.&lt;ref name="kinseyinstitute1"/&gt;  During her first years as director, as part of her contract with the University, the Institute was completely renovated and expanded adding a new full floor for the library including temperature and humidity controlled stacks, a scholars' reading room, additional staff offices, and The John Money Visiting Scholars Study, an art gallery and new archives for the art and artifacts collections and additional research offices and laboratory space. Reinisch’s directorship also saw the creation of a five-volume monographic series, The Kinsey Institute Series, beginning with the publication of ''Masculinity/Femininity''&lt;ref&gt;Reinisch, June Machover, ed. Masculinity/Femininity : Basic Perspectives. New York: Oxford University Press, 1987. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; resulting from institute- sponsored multidisciplinary seminars.  Research focused on at-risk sexual behavior and the effects of prenatal exposure to medications on sexual and psychosexual development. Additionally, in 1990 the establishment of the institute’s art gallery led to exhibitions featuring its art collection.&lt;ref&gt;Becherer. J. P. Selections from the collections of the Kinsey Institute. Bloomington, IN: The Kinsey Institute, 1990. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
From 1984 to 1993, with direction from Indiana University to play an active role in public education, the Institute produced “The Kinsey Report,” an internationally syndicated newspaper column.&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, Vern L. Science in the Bedroom: A History of Sex Research. New York: Basic Books, 1994. Print; 283.&lt;/ref&gt; Although "The Kinsey Report" is no longer a syndicated column, the Kinsey Institute continues to maintain a sex and sexuality FAQ and statistics page on their website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kinseyinstitute.org/research/faq.php|title=Sex FAQs and statistics|author=|date=|website=kinseyinstitute.org|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a trade book aimed at popular audiences, ''The Kinsey Institute New Report on Sex: What you must know to be Sexually Literate'', was released in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Reinisch, June Machover with Ruth Beasley. The Kinsey Institute New Report on Sex : What You Must Know to Be Sexually Literate New York: St. Martin's Press, 1991. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dr. Stephanie Sanders's interim directorship (1993–1995) ===
Following June Reinisch's retirement, Dr. Stephanie Sanders held the Institute's research and curriculum programs together as the Board reorganized its internal structure amid drastic budget cuts from Indiana University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwitimes.com/uncategorized/year-after-director-s-retirement-sex-institute-still-without/article_68197bd2-da6e-5f76-b974-143db156654a.html|title=Year after director's retirement, sex institute still without|first=Associated|last=Press|date=|website=nwitimes.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kinseyinstitute.org/about/profiles/ssanders.php|title=Stephanie A.

=== John Bancroft's directorship (1995–2004) ===
From 1995 to 2001, The Kinsey Institute operated a clinic for sexual health and menstrual problems under the directorship of John Bancroft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/about/chronology.html |title=History - Event Chronology [About the Institute&amp;#93; |publisher=The Kinsey Institute |date=1947-04-08 |accessdate=2014-04-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928231429/http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/about/chronology.html |archivedate=2013-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research focus was placed upon the psychology of sexual behavior, hormonal effects on sex, and sexuality and well-being.  Bancroft and Erick Janssen developed the Dual-control model of sexual arousal, a theory of sexual arousal involving inhibitory and excitation processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/graduate/phminor.html |title=Graduate Education&amp;#93; |publisher=The Kinsey Institute |date= |accessdate=2014-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1999, the website Kinsey Confidential (originally called Kinsey Institute Sexuality Information Service for Students) was started to provide research-based information regarding sexuality to college-aged adults. It includes sex questions and answers provided by sex researcher and columnist [[Debby Herbenick]], PhD in both column-format and podcast-format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kinseyconfidential.org/about/ |title=About |publisher=Kinsey Confidential |date= |accessdate=2014-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the following year, the institute began regularly rotating exhibitions of artwork and archival materials in addition to offering public tours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=94814&amp;page=1 |title=Sex Institute Opens Its Doors to Public - ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Julia Heiman's directorship (2004–2013) ===
In 2006, the institute began hosting an annual juried art show.&lt;ref name="newsinfo1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.iu.edu/news/page/normal/18550.html |title=Contemporary art: The Kinsey Institute Juried Art Show 2011: IU News Room: Indiana University |publisher=Newsinfo.iu.edu |date=2011-05-12 |accessdate=2014-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007, The Kinsey Institute also hosted the inaugural conference of The University Consortium for Sexuality Research and Training.&lt;ref name="newsinfo1"/&gt;  Also, a question and answer column from the Kinsey Confidential runs in university newspapers including Indiana University’s  [[Indiana Daily Student]].&lt;ref&gt;"Kinsey Confidential."

=== Sue Carter's directorship (2014–present) ===
[[C. Sue Carter|Sue Carter]], a pioneer in examining mechanisms underlying love, bonding and other emotions, 
was named director in October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;''Sue Carter named director of The Kinsey Institute at Indiana University, Researcher a pioneer in examining mechanisms underlying love, bonding and other emotions'' IU Bloomington Newsroom, Oct. 29, 2014
[http://news.indiana.edu/releases/iu/2014/10/new-kinsey-director-announced.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt;  Carter said her directorship will emphasize love, sexuality and well-being.  "I want to take Kinsey into directions that are unequivocally important" including sexual trauma, the transgender movement and medical interventions that can affect a person’s sexuality and relationships. Reflecting this broadened scope, the Institute changed its tagline from ''advancing sexual health and knowledge worldwide'' to ''explore love, sexuality, and well-being'' and introduced a new red logo, a circle inscribed with a hexagonal arrangement of circular arcs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kinseyinstitute.org/news-events/news/2016-01-11-kinsey-institute-undergoing-brand-refresh.php#|title=Kinsey Institute Undergoing Brand Refresh|author=|date=|website=kinseyinstitute.org|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The earlier green logo, a penetrative superposition of the sans serif letters K and I, had been phased out around 2010-11 [https://web.archive.org/web/20100628001647/http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/].

== Library, archive, and art gallery ==

=== Library, archive, and art collection ===
The Kinsey Institute is considered to have one of the largest collections of library, archival, and art materials pertaining to sex, gender, and reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;Pomeroy, Wardell B. Dr. Kinsey and the Institute for Sex Research. New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1972. Print; 458.&lt;/ref&gt;  The current collection began as Alfred Kinsey’s private research collection.  To ensure its protection, Kinsey sold it to the institute for one dollar.&lt;ref&gt;Harter, Margaret H., and June Machover Reinish. "Kinsey, Alfred C." Human Sexuality: An Encyclopedia. Eds. Bullough, Bonnie and Vern Bullough. New York: Garland Publishing, Inc., 1994. Print; 335.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, neither state nor grant money have been used to build collections.  Instead the institute uses funds obtained from book royalties and fees in addition to donations. A sampling of the broad range of items housed at the institute includes scientific and popular books, pulp magazines, publications from both sexual and anti-sexual organizations, data from Kinsey’s original interview project, films, photos, erotic objects, and artwork by both professionals and amateurs.  Items from all over the world are represented in the collection and some objects even date back to the pre-Columbian era.&lt;ref&gt;Pomeroy, Wardell B. Dr. Kinsey and the Insititute for Sex Research. New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1972. Print; 458-460.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, materials do not circulate and must be studied within the reading room which is open to scholars, professionals, university faculty, and students over eighteen who are researching topics pertaining to sexuality, gender, and reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/library/use.html |title=Library &amp; Special Collections&amp;#93; |publisher=The Kinsey Institute |date= |accessdate=2014-04-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416175443/http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/library/use.html |archivedate=2014-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to the highly specialized nature of the collection, holdings are described using subject headings created by The Kinsey Institute and organized using a modified version of the Dewey Decimal System.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/library/kicat-guide.html#what |title=Library &amp; Special Collections&amp;#93; |publisher=The Kinsey Institute |date= |accessdate=2014-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Language for specific purposes''' ('''LSP''') has been primarily used to refer to two areas within applied linguistics:  
# One focusing on the needs in education and training
# One with a focus on research on language variation across a particular subject field

LSP can be used with any target language needed by the learners as a tool for specific purposes, and has often been applied to English ('''English for specific purposes''', or '''ESP'''). 

A third approach, content or theme-based language instruction (CBI) has also been confused with LSP.  These several uses of the label of LSP have caused some confusion internationally.

==Education and training==
LSP is a widely applied approach to second or foreign language teaching and training that addresses immediate and very specific needs of learners who need that language as a tool in their education, training or job. Needs analysis is the underlying "driver" for the development of LSP programs.&lt;ref&gt;Hutchinson &amp; Waters 1987, Robinson 1980, Swales, 185, 1992, Hyland 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, English native speaking nurses who work in hospitals with a high percentage patient whose native language is Spanish might have to study Spanish for the very specific purpose of communication between nurses and patients.
Students are encouraged to take active roles in their own learning and question what they have been taught. This is likened to negotiated syllabus about which Hyland (2009)&lt;ref&gt;Hyland, K. (2009). Specific purpose programs. In M. H. Long &amp; C. J. Doughty (eds.), The handbook of language teaching (pp. 201-217). Singapore:Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; writes, "A negotiated syllabus means that the content of a particular course is a matter of discussion between teacher and students, according to the wishes and needs of the learners in conjunction with the expertise, judgement, and advice of the teacher" (p. 208).

==Research==
"Language for specific purposes" has also been used to refer to a branch of [[applied linguistics]] which deals with a variety of language used by members of a particular subject field, concentrating on its [[genre]]s, [[stylistics (field of study)|stylistic]] features and technical [[lexis (linguistics)|lexis]]. This research is relevant for such problem-based areas as [[language education]], [[translation]] and the [[lexicography|design of specialised dictionaries]]. Some in the training area consider such research on Professional Communications as LSP-related research when it is paired with or applied directly to an LSP training program.

==Relationship to content-based instruction==
[[Content-based instruction|Content-based language instruction]] (CBI) is also sometimes confused with ESP.  At the post-secondary level it is frequently used to motivate groups of learners who may be interested in the same professional field, providing meaningful communication opportunities.  However, as in their regular studies they are usually not studying through a foreign/second language (except for sheltered courses), they do not need English as a tool in their immediate studies. "Content-based instruction (CBI) is the integration of selected content with language teaching aims".&lt;ref&gt;Brinton, D. M., Snow, M. A., &amp; Wesche, M. B. (1989). ''Content-based second language instruction.'' New York: Newbury House.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, when trying to identify which approach being taken, the question is: "Is it English for Specific Purposes or English through specific content themes or content areas?"

'''Leadership analysis''' is the art of breaking down a leader into basic [[Psychology|psychological]] components for study and use by academics and practitioners. Good leadership analyses are not reductionist, but rather take into consideration the overall person in the context of the times, society, and culture from which they come. Leadership analysis is traditionally housed in [[political psychology]] departments and utilizes the tools of psychology to achieve political ends by exploiting the psyche in the case of practitioners, or to gain knowledge about the building blocks of leadership and individuals in the case of academics.&lt;ref name=USIC&gt;{{cite book|last=Richelson|first=Jeffrey T.|title=The US Intelligence Community|year=2012|publisher=Westview Press|location=United States|isbn=9780813345116|page=390}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The distinction between the two is not made frivolously; in fact, while academics and practitioners both engage in the overarching act of analyzing leaders, they go about it quite differently. Applied analysts make great use of the psychobiography, while academics tend to analyze transcriptions in search of [[trait theory|traits]] and character clues.&lt;ref name=Post&gt;{{cite book|last=Post|first=Jerrold|title=The Psychological Assessment of Political Leaders|year=2005|publisher=The University of Michigan Press|location=Michigan|isbn=0472068385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applied analysis ==

In keeping with the goals of psychology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Halonen|first=Jane|title=APA GUIDELINES FOR  THE UNDERGRADUATE PSYCHOLOGY MAJOR|url=http://www.apa.org/ed/precollege/about/psymajor-guidelines.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (describe, explain, predict, control), a psychobiography is first a description of an individual’s life, an explanation or analysis in psychological terms of how the events shaped the individual, and an if/then predictor (if conducting an applied analysis) of the actions the individual might take if given the right situation, leaving the control/change up to the policy-maker requesting the analysis. An if/then predictor is used because no analyst will be able to know the environment that acts upon the individual to the extent of proper analysis. One of the most influential government analysts is [[Jerrold Post]], founder of [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA’s]] [[Center for the Analysis of Personality and Political Behavior]]. Post's analytical paradigm is below. His background, like many of the earliest applied analysts, was in psychiatry, which utilizes qualitative methods for analysis.

Important theorists for a [[psychobiography]] would be [[Gordon Allport]], [[Alfred Adler]], [[Erik Erikson]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Urie Bronfenbrenner]], [[Carl Jung]], [[Albert Bandura]], [[John Bowlby]], among others.

These methods focus primarily [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]], [[personality]], and [[developmental psychology|developmental]] theories including the influence of role models, early experiences, heroes and mentors, as well as ego defenses (known more commonly as [[defence mechanisms]]), personality types, belief systems, information processing styles, and cognitive factors. The important thing to note about leadership analysis is the consistency of the individual’s belief systems, rather than small fluctuations.

[[Personality type]]s (and [[personality disorder]]s) play a large part in aiding with analysis, as they are often associated with specific cognitive beliefs and processes. For example, extreme narcissists lack [[empathy]], conscience, and will do anything to accomplish personal goals. Lack of accomplishment is usually taken extremely badly and narcissists have low self-esteem. Narcissists have trouble learning from others because they know everything. Leaders who are narcissists make their people give great shows affirming their righteous leadership, demand praise from others, and employ “yes men”, or sycophants.

Other common personality types of leaders are obsessive-compulsive, which makes for a hardworking leader with great organizational skills, but also one afraid to make decisions for fear of making a mistake, excessively contentious, and lacking in social grace, and the paranoid; a hypersensitive, easily slighted leader who see the world as full of enemies and will rarely negotiate. [[Paranoia|Paranoid]] leaders fall prey to projecting their beliefs (ego defense) on those around them and are therefore largely autonomous and independent. Their enemies are always coordinated and rational actors intent on the paranoid’s destruction.

In line with developmental psychology, life stages are a particularly important part of analysis, especially during the mid-thirties (when most leaders of coups emerge), or in old age, when leaders, especially narcissists, feel the reins of power slipping and either try to consolidate power, as did [[Deng Xiaoping]], or give it up, as did [[Charles de Gaulle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Post|first=Jerrold|title=Leaders and their Followers in a Dangerous World: the Psychology of Political Behavior|year=2004|publisher=Cornell University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempt to predict how the individual will interact with other political figures, including opposition leaders and other key foreign leaders&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Post|first=Jerrold|title=The Psychological Assessment of Political Leaders|year=2005|publisher=The University of Michigan Press|location=Michigan|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic analysis ==
In contrast to applied analysts, academic analysts generally come from the fields of social psychology and political science and take a quantitative methodology when conducting analysis, usually consisting in part of [[trait theory]] (openness, contentiousness, extroversion, etc.) and/or character study (central to individual’s functioning, observable, stable patterns of behavior, present across circumstances). In addition, quantitative measures such as verbal styles, grammatical choices, and scales for achievement, affiliation, and power provide room for analysis.

=== Verbal categories ===
Sources that are analyzed for verbal styles are general public data that has been cross-checked, legitimized, and filtered for representation of the individual as much as possible. Verbal style is preferred to be off the cuff, both to ensure lack of third party input and to put the individual in what is deemed a stressful situation.

Verbal categories include [[qualifier]]s (“I believe”), retractors (“but”, “nevertheless”), I/We, me, [[Affirmative and negative|negatives]] (“nothing”, “never”, “not”), explainers (“because” “therefore”), feeling expressions (“I like”),  direct references (“your question”), nonpersonal references (“Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine”), and expressions. The scores are based on occurrences/1000 words.

These scores can tell about the traits of the individual. Many qualifiers suggest a lack of decisiveness, use of retractors indicate an individual who will reconsider, use of retractors and negatives indicates a large amount of impulsivity, a combination of using I, me, explainers, negatives, and qualifiers, suggest anxiousness (and a less likely change of being the leader of a country), moodiness is identified by high I/we ratio, direct references, expression of feelings, and adverbial intensifiers. Other traits include an angry disposition, evidenced by high negatives, rhetorical questions, and direct references. Impulsive speakers use negatives more than any other group, controlling speakers use low qualifiers, steer the conversation, and use very few feelings. Histrionic individuals use adverbial intensifiers and exaggeration. Passivity is categorized by the extensive use of me. Domineering individuals use lots of qualifiers, retractors, and explainers as well as interruptions. Familiar behavior (establish report) is not surprising evidenced by the use of first names and high direct references. A resilient speaker will lose their verbal style during a crisis and then afterward resume it.&lt;ref name=Weintraub&gt;{{cite book|last=Weintraub|first=Walter|title=The Psychological Assessment of Political Leaders|year=2005|publisher=The University of Michigan Press|location=Michigan|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Motivation assessments ===
Leadership analyses can also come in the form of [[motivation]] assessments, where achievement, affiliation, and power are deemed the three fundamental dimensions. Achievement motivation, the concern for excellence, is often manifested in the leader claiming to do “good” or “better”. High achievers delay gratification, have high but achievable expectations, and are innovative. These leaders are rational calculators pursuing self-interest. Affiliation motivation, the concern for close relations with others, is manifested by statements of togetherness and common pursuits. Affiliation leaders form ideological circles and rely on friends, rather than experts, when formulating decisions. They work harder with people who share their ideologies and are aggressive towards people who are different or new. Affiliate leaders will rebel against those they believe are being exploitive, and perceptions of friends and enemies is important. They may appear erratic and unstable and are not adept and working with or managing people they don’t know or like. Power motivation portrays the leader and the leader’s group as the mover and shaker of events. Power motives with a sense of self-control, responsibility, and altruism leads to successful managers who create high-morale atmospheres, are visible and well-known (and liked). Power motives without self-censorship are prone to fall victim to ingratiation and flattery and will take extreme risks with little thought to moral considerations. Unchecked power motives create impulsive behavior and combined with stress, leads to lower immune functions, vulnerability to cardiovascular problems, and infectious diseases.

Studies have shown that countries heading to war will increase power language while decreasing affiliation language. Country documents with high achievement scores generally have stronger economies with greater numbers of entrepreneurs and higher levels of economic development.&lt;ref name=Winter&gt;{{cite book|last=Winter|first=David G|title=The Psychological Assessment of Political Leaders|year=2005|publisher=The University of Michigan Press|location=Michigan|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trait assessment ===
Seven other traits are used for assessing leadership style. The belief that one can influence or control what happens ([[locus of control]]), the need for power and influence, conceptual complexity (ability to differentiate between people and things in an environment), self-confidence, and motivations (problem solving/relationships), general distrust or suspicion, in-group bias. Scoring is done per mention per speech and compared with other leaders being studied. When the first trait, belief in influence, is scored high, these leaders generally get their way and have a way forward. Low scores indicate a belief in constraints, but also in consensus building and compromise. High scores in this trait but low in power motivation will not be able to manipulate as well and will not achieve all they want to do.

=== Conceptual complexity ===
Conceptual complexity and levels of self-confidence make up a self-other orientation, which analyses the level of openness the individual is to input from others. Higher complexity than self-confidence mean more likely to take input, showing a concern for others and are successful at seeing the whole picture and dealing with situations on a case-by-case basis. The reverse situation (higher self-confidence) shows a leader who view the world as they wish to perceive it and use coercion to ensure their views become their follower’s views. Low in both is an individual who mirrors the group that elected them and tends to exhibit narcissistic tendencies.

Self-confidence scores are judged on the use of the words, I, me, myself, and mine. Scores are calculated by average percentage over the course of several speeches. Again, high self-confidence forms a filter with which the individual creates their world-view, low self-confidence turns the individual into a mouth for a cause. Contextual complexity (degree of differentiation) forecasts leaders either seeing multiple paths through situations  (high) or absolutist terms (low).

=== Motivation assessment ===
The continuum of motivations spans from relationships (group maintenance) to problem solving. Coding is done through word choice, where words like accomplish(ment), achieve(ment), plan, position, proposal, recommend(ation),  and tactic signify problem solving and words like appreciation, amnesty, collaboration, disappoint(ment), forgive(ness), harm, liberation, and suffering indicate group maintenance. Scoring is done of one in proportion to the other.

Problem solvers view people as tools to solve problems, sacrificing unity, morale, and cohesion if necessary. Relationship builders will move only if morale is high and the group wants to go in that way.

General distrust and suspicion and in-group bias come from leader’s distrustful of the “other” and believe in the exceptionalism of their people/state. Cues of this trait include words and phrases like great, peace-loving, progressive, successful, prosperous, powerful, capable, made great advances, has boundless resources, firmly defend borders, decide our own fate. Scoring is based on average of percentages across transcripts. Distrust is coded with words like doubtful, uneasy about, misgivings (of the out-group). High leaders in this category see the us-them paradigm and the leader becomes the group (we). The world is a zero-sum game and there may be external enemies constantly needing confrontation.

The directed psychobiography in this case would only include categories of topics discussed in speeches, audience, events and tenure, and any significance in changes of speech patterns/traits.&lt;ref name=Hermann&gt;{{cite book|last=Hermann|first=Margaret G.|title=The Psychological Assessment of Political Leaders|year=2005|publisher=The University of Michigan Press|location=Michigan|page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Operational coding ===
Another way to conduct a leadership analysis is through operational coding. Operational coding analysis is the study of political leaders that closely focus on set of political beliefs and their cultural context. There are ten questions that should be answered:

Philosophy
#What is the “essential” nature of political life? Is the political universe essentially one of harmony or conflict? What is the fundamental character of one’s political opponents?
#What are the prospects for the eventual realization of one’s fundamental values and aspirations? Can one be optimistic, or must one be pessimistic on this score; and in what respects the one and/or the other?
#Is the political future predictable? In what sense and to what extent?
#How much “control” or “mastery” can one have over historical development? What is one’s role in “moving” and “shaping” history in the desired direction?
#What is the role of “chance” in human affairs and in historical development?

Instrumental
#What is the best approach for selecting goals or objectives for political action?
#How are the goals of action pursued most effectively?
#How are the risks of political action calculated, controlled, and accepted?
#What is the best “timing” of action to advance one’s interests?
#What are the utility and role of different means for advancing one’s interests?

Answering these questions will give the nature of the belief system, which can then be categorized into six types (A-F) regarding the opinions of the nature of conflict. A, B, and C believe that conflict is temporary, caused by individual misperceptions (A), pathological societal institutions (B), or anarchical organizations of the international system (C). D, E, and F believe that conflict is permanent, caused by the individual (D), society (E), or the international system (F). Type A’s motivation is affiliation, which DEF are power motives. B and C shared achievement, but differed in power (B) and affiliation (C).

A system of analysis of operational coding is the psycholinguistic VICS (Verbs in Context System), a system for reviewing belief patterns in speeches in public statements and making inferences about behavior from those beliefs. Subject, verb category, domain of politics, tense of verb, intended target, and context are all scored with + or – points according to the table:

#	Identify the subject: Self or Other
#	Identify the tense of the transitive verb: past, present, future
:a.	Identify the category of the verb +/-
#	Words
:a.	Appeal, support (+1)		Oppose, resist (-1)
:b.	Promise benefits (+2)	Threaten costs (-2)
#	Deeds
:a.	Rewards (+3)			Punishments (-3)
#	Identify domain: Domestic or Foreign
#	Identify target and place in context

Scoring (after weighting based on same verb categories and multiplying by frequency measures)- these can be applied to any of the operational coding questions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Walker, Schafer, and Young|title=The Psychological Assessment of Political Leaders|year=2005|publisher=The University of Michigan Press|location=Michigan|page=215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

=== Adolf Hitler ===
[[Adolf Hitler]] was one of the first targets of government analysis by the [[Office of Strategic Services]] on at least two occasions, one being by Dr. [[Henry Murray]] titled "[[Analysis of the Personality of Adolph Hitler]]", another by [[Walter Charles Langer|Walter Langer]] titled [[The Mind of Adolf Hitler]], and another of unknown origin titled "Adolf Hitler". These psychobiographies included headers such as background, education, physique, religion, metamorphosis in Landsberg, sexual life, speechmaking technique, Hitler as he believes himself to be, Hitler as the German people know him, Hitler as his associates know him, Hitler as he knows himself, Hitler the man, and Predictions of Hitler's behavior in the coming future. These analyses included observations such as Hitler's messiah complex, sense of destiny, and how his rough beginnings inspired him to be where he is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Murray|first=Henry|title=Analysis of the Personality of Adolph Hitler: With Predictions of His Future Behavior and Suggestions for Dealing with Him Now and After Germany's Surrender|url=http://www.lawschool.cornell.edu/library/WhatWeHave/SpecialCollections/Donovan/Hitler/Download.cfm|work=Cornell University Law Library|publisher=Cornell University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Woodrow Wilson ===
[[Woodrow Wilson]] was another target of analysis by psychobiographers George and George, who concluded a self-defeating pattern of low self-esteem and inner doubt that originated from his father, a Presbyterian Preacher whose perfectionist demands his son internalized. A competing analysis by [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] maintained that Wilson had not resolved the [[Oedipus complex]] and identified with his father and his harsh [[superego]]. His repressed aggression was reflected on those around him, who were his "younger brothers".

=== Camp David Profiles ===
Post's creation of the Center for the Analysis of Personality and Behavior (CAPB) (later the Political Psychology Division) at [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] lead to the creation of the Camp David Profiles, psychobiographies of [[Anwar Sadat]] and [[Menachem Begin]] as well as how to manipulate each to get the best negotiation position. These were extensively studied by Carter, and resulted in the Nobel Prize. Among the findings where Anwar Sadat's "Nobel Prize Complex", his desire to be forever known in history as a great leader and Begin's biblical preoccupation and fixation on detail, which Carter was able to play off each other.

=== Carter ===
From an academic perspective, Carter's VICS score changed intensely from before to after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Carter had previously been cooperative and friendly but changed to hostile and conflict prone afterward.

=== Bill Clinton ===
Bill Clinton's Trait and Motivation Profile, gathered from Q&amp;A at press conferences, presented [[Bill Clinton]] as a single successful politician, rather than a part of a larger whole or cause (use of "I" was highest of post-World War II presidents while "we" was lowest), the use of qualifiers and retractors, presented a confident individual with no desire to control the flow of conversation but who would make decisions and rethink them when necessary. He doesn't use many explainers and tells, rather than explains his views. He is the most expressive post-World War II president and with high adverbial intensifiers, he is an actor who displays histrionic ([[attention seeking]]) behavior. His high negatives score shows he's very defensive when attacked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weintraub|first=Walter|title=The Psychological Assessment of Political Leaders|year=2005|publisher=The University of Michigan|location=Michigan|page=303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Saddam Hussein ===
An analysis of [[Saddam Hussein]] reveals a rational calculator who when necessary, finds it prudent to change mind and adapt other tactics, as long as he can find a face-saving measure to do so. His childhood started with his mother rejecting physically rejecting room, being saved by a [[Jews|Jewish]] family, and then sent off to live with his uncle in order to get an education. His uncle indoctrinated him in the ways of Iraqi nationalism and the Baath party. His early hero was Abdel Nasser of [[Egypt]], who confronted the West and gained his Arab nationalist credentials. Saddam was part of an attempted Iraqi uprising, which failed and forced him to Egypt, law school, and high ranks in Egyptian Baath party until he was able to return to Iraq. From there he was appointed successor to [[Michel Aflaq]], the father of the Baath party. In Saddam's efforts to become the Supreme Arab Nationalist Leader, he had to compete against Assad of [[Syria]].

Throughout his tenure, Saddam killed supporters who gave advice contrary to his thinking, and thus surrounded himself with sycophants. He warred with the [[Kurds]] and Iranians and was pragmatic enough to change his mind regarding the Shatt al Arab Waterway, his foreign hostage policy, and the War with Iran, which had started going badly for the Iraqis. To his mind, Saddam is Iraq and Iraq is Saddam. He was a [[Narcissism|narcissist]] who believed he was the chosen leader of the [[Arab world]], despite lack of support for the [[Kuwait]] invasion. Paranoid, he was convinced in conspiracies of the US, [[Israel]], and [[Iran]] to kill him. After the Kuwait invasion and defeat, he worked to shore up his forces and eventually began to trust party loyalists over his family, including two of his sons whom he killed after giving them amnesty. His goal is survival and a place in the world state with world class weapons. When backed into a corner, he fights with everything he has but can change his mind and compromise to be seen as a global leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Post|first=Jerrold|title=The Psychological Assessment of Political Leaders|year=2005|publisher=The University of Michigan Press|location=Michigan|page=335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mock-heroic''', '''mock-epic''' or '''heroi-comic''' works are typically [[satire]]s or [[parodies]] that mock common Classical stereotypes of [[hero]]es and heroic literature.  Typically, mock-heroic works either put a fool in the role of the hero or exaggerate the heroic qualities to such a point that they become absurd.

==History==
Historically, the mock-heroic style was popular in 17th century Italy, and in the post-[[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] and [[Augustan literature|Augustan]] periods in Great Britain.

The earliest example of the form is the ''[[Batrachomyomachia]]'' ascribed to [[Homer]] by the Romans and parodying his work, but believed by most modern scholars to be the work of an anonymous poet in the time of Alexander the Great &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.carmentablog.com/2016/12/27/batrachomyomachia-classical-parody/|title=Batrachomyomachia: A Classical Parody - Carmenta Language School Blog|date=2016-12-27|work=Carmenta Language School Blog|access-date=2017-12-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

A longstanding assumption on the origin of the mock-heroic in the 17th century is that [[epic (genre)|epic]] and the [[pastoral]] genres had become used up and exhausted,&lt;ref name="Griffin1994p135"&gt;Griffin,Dustin H. (1994) ''Satire: A Critical Reintroduction'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=MLM2edymLtUC&amp;pg=PA135 p.135]&lt;/ref&gt; and so they got parodically [[reprise]]d. In the 17th century the epic genre was heavily criticized, because it was felt expressing the traditional values of the feudal society.
Among the new genres, closer to the modern feelings and proposing new ideals, the satirical literature was particularly effective in criticizing the old habits and values. Beside the Spanish [[picaresque novel]]s and the French [[burlesque]] novel, in Italy flourished the ''poema eroicomico''. &lt;br&gt;
In this country those who still wrote epic poems, following the rules set by [[Torquato Tasso]] in his work ''Discorsi del poema eroico'' (''Discussions about the Epic Poems'') and realized in his masterwork, the ''[[Jerusalem Delivered]]'', were felt as antiquated.&lt;br&gt;
The new mock-heroic poem accepted the same metre, vocabulary, rhetoric of the epics. However, the new genre turned the old epic upside down about the meaning, setting the stories in more familiar situations, to ridiculize the traditional epics. In this context was created the parody of epic genre.

''Lo scherno degli dèi'' (''The Mockery of Gods'') by [[Francesco Bracciolini]], printed in 1618 is often regarded as the first Italian ''poema eroicomico''.

[[File:Houghton MS Typ 619 - Amelonghi.jpg|thumb|Girolamo Amelonghi, 1547]]
However, the best known of the form is ''[[La secchia rapita]]'' (''The rape of the Bucket'') by [[Alessandro Tassoni]] (1622). &lt;br&gt;Other Italian mock-heroic poems were ''La Gigantea'' by [[Girolamo Amelonghi]] (1566), the ''Viaggio di Colonia'' (''Travel to Cologne'') by [[Antonio Abbondanti]] (1625), ''L'asino'' (''The donkey'') by [[Carlo de' Dottori]] (1652), ''La Troja rapita'' by [[Loreto Vittori]] (1662), ''Il malmantile racquistato'' by [[Lorenzo Lippi]] (1688), ''La presa di San Miniato'' by [[Ippolito Neri]] (1764).

Also in Italian dialects were written mock-heroic poems. For example, in [[Neapolitan dialect]] the best known work of the form was ''La Vaiasseide'' by [[Giulio Cesare Cortese]] (1612).&lt;br&gt; While in [[Romanesco dialect|Romanesco]] [[Giovanni Camillo Peresio]] wrote ''Il maggio romanesco'' (1688), [[Giuseppe Berneri]] published ''[[Meo Patacca]]'' in 1695, and, finally, [[Benedetto Micheli]] printed ''La libbertà romana acquistata e defesa'' in 1765.

After the translation of ''[[Don Quixote]]'', by [[Miguel de Cervantes]], English authors began to imitate the inflated language of [[Romance (heroic literature)|Romance]] poetry and narrative to describe misguided or common characters.  The most likely genesis for the mock-heroic, as distinct from the [[picaresque novel|picaresque]], [[burlesque (literature)|burlesque]], and [[satire|satirical]] poem is the comic poem ''[[Hudibras]]'' (1662–1674), by [[Samuel Butler (poet)|Samuel Butler]].  Butler's poem describes a "trew blew" Puritan knight during the [[Interregnum (England)|Interregnum]], in language that imitates Romance and [[epic poetry]].  After Butler, there was an explosion of poetry that described a despised subject in the elevated language of heroic poetry and plays.  

''Hudibras'' gave rise to a particular verse form, commonly called the "[[Hudibrastic]]."  The Hudibrastic is poetry in closed rhyming couplets in iambic tetrameter, where the rhymes are often [[feminine rhyme]]s or unexpected conjunctions.  For example, Butler describes the [[English Civil War]] as a time which "Made men fight like mad or drunk/ For dame religion as for punk/ Whose honesty all durst swear for/ Tho' not one knew why or wherefore" ("punk" meaning a prostitute).  The strained and unexpected rhymes increase the comic effect and heighten the parody.  This formal indication of satire proved to separate one form of mock-heroic from the others.  After Butler, [[Jonathan Swift]] is the most notable practitioner of the Hudibrastic, as he used that form for almost all of his poetry.

[[Poet Laureate]] [[John Dryden]] is responsible for some of the dominance among satirical genres of the mock-heroic in the later Restoration era.  While Dryden's own plays would themselves furnish later mock-heroics (specifically, ''[[The Conquest of Granada]]'' is satirized in the mock-heroic ''[[The Author's Farce]]'' and ''[[Tom Thumb (play)|Tom Thumb]]'' by [[Henry Fielding]], as well as ''[[The Rehearsal (play)|The Rehearsal]]''), Dryden's ''[[Mac Flecknoe]]'' is perhaps the ''[[locus classicus]]'' of the mock-heroic form as it would be practiced for a century to come.  In that poem, Dryden indirectly compares [[Thomas Shadwell]] with [[Aeneas]] by using the language of ''[[Aeneid]]'' to describe the coronation of Shadwell on the throne of Dullness formerly held by King Flecknoe.  The [[parody]] of Virgil satirizes Shadwell.  Dryden's prosody is identical to regular [[heroic verse]]:  iambic pentameter closed couplets.  The parody is not formal, but merely contextual and ironic. (For an excellent overview of the history of the mock-heroic in the 17th and 18th centuries see "the English Mock-Heroic poem of the 18th Century" by Grazyna Bystydzienska, published by Polish Scientific Publishers, 1982.) 

After Dryden, the form continued to flourish, and there are countless minor mock-heroic poems from 1680 to 1780.  Additionally, there were a few attempts at a mock-heroic novel.  The most significant later mock-heroic poems were by [[Alexander Pope]].  Pope’s ''The Rape of the Lock'' is a noted example of the Mock-Heroic style; indeed, Pope never deviates from mimicking [[epic poetry]] such as [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' and [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'' .   The overall form of the poem, written in [[canto]]s, follows the tradition of epics, along with the precursory “Invocation of the [[Muse]]”; in this case, Pope's [[Muse]] is literally the person who prodded him to write the poem, [[John Caryll the younger|John Caryll]]: “this verse to Caryll, Muse, is due!” (line 3).  Epics always include foreshadowing which is usually given by an otherworldly figure{{fact|date=November 2013 }}, and Pope mocks tradition through Ariel the sprite, who sees some “dread event” (line 109) impending on Belinda.  These epic introductory tendencies give way to the main portion of the story, usually involving a battle of some kind (such as in the ''Iliad'') that follows this pattern: dressing for battle (description of Achilles shield, preparation for battle), altar sacrifice/libation to the gods, some battle change (perhaps involving drugs), treachery (Achilles ankle is told to be his weak spot), a journey to the Underworld, and the final battle.  All of these elements are followed eloquently by Pope in that specific order: Belinda readies herself for the card game (which includes a description of her hair and beauty), the Baron makes a sacrifice for her hair (the altar built for love and the deal with Clarissa), the “mock” battle of cards changes in the Baron’s favor, Clarissa’s treachery to her supposed friend Belinda by slipping the Baron scissors, and finally the treatment of the card game as a battle and the Baron’s victory.  Pope’s [http://www.sparknotes.com/poetry/rapeofthelock/analysis.html mastery of the Mock-Heroic] is clear in every instance.  Even the typical [[apotheosis]] found in the epics is mimicked in ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'', as “the stars inscribe Belinda’s name!” (line 150). He invokes the same Mock-heroic style in ''[[The Dunciad]]'' which also employs the language of heroic poetry to describe menial or trivial subjects.    In this mock-epic the progress of [[Dulness]] over the face of the earth, the coming of stupidity and tastelessness, is treated in the same way as the coming of civilization is in the ''[[Aeneid]]'' (see also the metaphor of ''[[translatio studii]]'').  [[John Gay]]'s ''[[Trivia (poem)|Trivia]]'' and ''[[Beggar's Opera]]'' were mock-heroic (the latter in [[opera]]), and [[Samuel Johnson]]'s ''[[London (Samuel Johnson poem)|London]]'' is a mock-heroic of a sort.

By the time of Pope, however, the mock-heroic was giving ground to narrative [[parody]], and authors such as Fielding led the mock-heroic novel into a more general novel of parody.  The ascension of the novel drew a slow end to the age of the mock-heroic, which had originated in Cervantes's novel.  After [[Romanticism]]'s flourishing, mock-heroics like Byron's ''[[Don Juan (Byron)|Don Juan]]'' were uncommon.

Finally, the mock-heroic genre spread throughout Europe, in [[France]], in [[Scotland]], in [[Poland]], in [[Bohemia]], in [[Russia]]. The most noted mock-heroic poems in French were ''Le Vergile Travesti'' (''The disguised Vergil'') by [[Paul Scarron]] (1648–52) and ''[[The Maid of Orleans (poem)|The Maid of Orleans]]'' by [[Voltaire]] (1730). In [[macaronic Latin]] enriched with Scottish Gaelic expressions [[William Drummond of Hawthornden]] wrote ''Polemo-Middinia inter Vitarvam et Nebernam'' in 1684. The main author of mock-heroic poems in Polish was [[Ignacy Krasicki]], who wrote ''Myszeida'' (''Mouseiad'') in 1775 and ''Monacomachia'' (''The War of the Monks'') in 1778. In the same language [[Tomasz Kajetan Węgierski]] published ''Organy'' in 1775-77. The Bohemian poet [[Šebestiàn Hnĕvkovský]] in 1805 printed two mock-heroic poems: ''Dĕvin'' in Czech and ''Der böhmische Mägderkrieg'' in German. In 1791 the Russian poet [[N. P. Osipov]] published {{Interlanguage link multi|Eneida travestied|ru|3=Вергилиева Энеида, вывороченная наизнанку|lt=''Eneida travestied''}} ({{lang-ru|Вирги́лиева Энеи́да, вы́вороченная наизна́нку|italic=yes}}). [[Ivan Kotliarevsky]]'s mock-epic poem Eneyida (Ukrainian: Енеїда), written in 1798, is considered to be the first literary work published wholly in the [[modern Ukrainian language]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5041">'''Museum Planning''' is the creation of documents to describe a new [[museum]]’s vision, the visitor experience and an organizational plan for a new institution, or one undergoing a major expansion or change in focus.

[[Museum]] plans may include some or all of the following:
* A review of institutional resources, assets and [[Collection (museum)|collections]]
* A review of local attractions and museums
* A new or updated mission and vision
* [[Collection (museum)|Collections]] objectives of the new institution
* Educational objectives of the new institution
* Experience objectives of the new institution
* Potential visitor and other audience and user groups
* [[Interpretive planning|Interpretive Plan]]
* [[Exhibition]] storylines
* Visitor flow diagrams
* Thematic treatments
* Preliminary [[exhibition]] layout
* Style Boards
* Exhibition Renderings
* Space Needs Analysis
* [[Site selection]]
* Architectural Concepts
* Preliminary staffing plan
* Preliminary project schedule
* Preliminary project budget

Plans are created by a [[museum]] planning team, that includes; [[museum]] staff and volunteers, members of the [[board of directors]], community members, and representatives of city and state planning agencies working together with a museum planner, architects, exhibit designers, economists, and other specialist consultants. The objective of a [[Museum]] Plan is to create a clear and concise “road map” for the creation of new institution and a sustainable long term museum vision.

Museum planning may also refer to the designing of [[museum]] galleries, spaces, or new wings and buildings. The goal of a well-designed museum space is that it accents the collection, and puts the patron at ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McAndrew|first=John|title=New Installations in the Metropolitan Museum|journal=College Art Association|date=Dec 1945|volume=27|issue=4|pages=260–265|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3047029?uid=3739896&amp;uid=2134&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21103385038211|accessdate=02/05/2014|doi=10.1080/00043079.1945.11407722}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are many features of galleries that must be considered when organizing and planning a new space. Some of those aspects are '''circulation, density, lighting, backgrounds, arrangement, and labels.'''

The '''circulation''' of the space indicates the layout and direction of flow for visitors. This can be done by numbering objects, or the layout of displays. Poor circulation can result in the patron missing some galleries or displays or viewing objects in an order other than what the curator intended. Circulation should feel natural and logical; the patron may feel herded and become resentful.

'''Density, clarity, and emphasis''' are other aspects to consider when planning a new space. Galleries and individual objects should be placed so that everything appears to have equal value and importance. Then within displays, objects should not be overcrowded or cluttered. '''Lighting''' is extremely important and cannot be overlooked when planning new galleries. Natural light is ideal, but it must be filtered, and not too intense. It also should be consistent throughout the day – northern and southern exposure is ideal. 

'''Backgrounds''' can refer to a number of things: props, panels, or a simple painted wall can serve as a background to an object or display.  These must be subdued enough that they do not detract from the object on display, but they should be complimentary. The specific '''position, arrangement, and display''' of an object is important to consider. Height of the display case, order in which objects are placed or hung, and the grouping of certain objects are all major factors in how patrons interpret objects. 

'''[[Museum label]] and explanatory accessories''' are essential to a patron’s experience in a museum. Enough information should be provided that the patron feels as if they understand what they are looking at, but too much can bore or confuse the visitor. Some examples of these accessories are collection guides available for the overall museum experience, larger panels at the start of each gallery that can explain the intent of the collection, and smaller panels at each object should inform the viewer the object’s use, medium, creator, and dates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McAndrew|first=John|title=New Installations in the Metropolitan Museum|journal=College Art Association|date=Dec 1945|volume=27|issue=4|pages=260–265|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3047029?uid=3739896&amp;uid=2134&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21103385038211|accessdate=02/05/2014|doi=10.1080/00043079.1945.11407722}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Agricultural Technology Institute''' ({{lang-es|Instituto Nacional de Tecnología Agropecuaria}}), commonly known as '''INTA''', is an [[Argentina|Argentine]] federal [[extension agency]] in charge of the generation, adaptation and diffusion of technologies, knowledge and learning procedures for the [[agriculture]], forest and agro-industrial activities within an ecologically clean environment.

Even though the institute, created in 1956, depends on the Secretary of Agriculture, Livestock, Fishing and Food of the Ministry of Economy and Production, it has financial and operative autarkic autonomy given by law 25641/02 that provides the Institute with the 0.5% of the importations.

==Activities==

[[Image:Mesadalabmol1.jpg|thumb|240px|Molecular biology lab.]]
The INTA researches and produces information and technologies applied to processes and products, that are later forwarded to the producers. It works, for instance, in the genetic improvement and development of specific properties of diverse cereals, fruits, flowers, forest trees and vegetables, as well as the handling of cultivations and native forests.

Another important field is the sanity of the products; plagues control, weeds and diseases. It studies and researches the harvest, manipulation, packing, distribution and commercialisation of fruit and vegetables, as well as the handling and processing of meats and dairy products. 
The institute also observes market behaviours of internal and external consume, as well as the economical impact of the different applied technologies.

==Organization==
The INTA has a directive board composed of members of both the official and the private sector; they define the politics at national level. 
The national direction executes the planning of the board, assisted by the organization and administration technical areas.

Research and producers' capacitation takes place in 44 experimental agricultural stations and 240 extension units around the country.

The '''National Cryptologic School''' ('''NCS''') is a school within the [[National Security Agency]] that provides  training to members of the Agency.

The National Cryptologic School is a Cryptologic Training School within the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA). It is responsible for designing, developing, and delivering curriculum in [[Cryptology]], [[Information Assurance]], Language, and Leadership.

It was opened on November 1, 1965, and is now housed on multiple campuses, including the NSA's [[Friendship Annex]] facility in [[Linthicum, Maryland|Linthicum]], [[Maryland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bamford |first=James |authorlink=James Bamford |title=The Puzzle Palace: A Report on America's Most Secret Agency |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |year=1983 |page=153 |isbn=9780140067484}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Career Development |publisher=National Security Agency |date=February 23, 2009 |url=http://www.nsa.gov/careers/career_dev/ |accessdate=July 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NCS courses are provided to the civilian and military population of the NSA, as well as the [[United States Intelligence Community|Intelligence Community]], the military services, and the [[Central Security Service]] (CSS). Many of the courses are accredited by the [[American Council on Education]] and the [[Council on Occupational Education]], and are eligible for transfer credits at a variety of educational institutions.

Training is delivered via computer-based methods, as well as in the traditional classroom setting. Employees have access to thousands of web-based training courses developed by NSA, as well as those offered by a variety of vendors and agencies throughout the Intelligence Community.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4297">'''NERI''', the '''National Environmental Research Institute of Denmark''' ({{lang-da|Danmarks Miljøundersøgelser}} or simply ''DMU'') was an independent research institute under the [[University of Aarhus|Aarhus University]]. NERI undertook scientific consultancy work and monitoring of nature and the environment as well as applied and strategic research. NERI’s primary task was to establish a scientific foundation for environmental policy decisions.

NERI participated in a large number of national and international research programmes, and also in scientific working groups, commissions, and organizations under such bodies as the [[European Union]] and the [[United Nations]].

NERI closed in 2011. On 1 July 2011, the consultancy side was reorganised into The DCE - [[Danish Centre for Environment and Energy]], while the research departments of the old NERI are now divided between the Department of Bioscience and the Department of Environmental Science. All three areas are part of Aarhus University.

==Departments within NERI==

NERI includes a number of departments devoted to various environmental and ecological categories:

* Department of Policy Analysis
* Department of Atmospheric Environment
* Department of Marine Ecology
* Department of Environmental Chemistry and Microbiology
* Department of Arctic Environment
* Department of Terrestrial Ecology
* Department of Freshwater Ecology
* Department of Ecology and Biodiversity

==Department of Atmospheric Environment (ATMI)==

NERI monitors [[air pollution]] in [[Denmark]] and [[Greenland]], and works with mathematical [[atmospheric dispersion model]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Turner, D.B. | title=Workbook of atmospheric dispersion estimates: an introduction to dispersion modeling| edition=2nd| publisher=CRC Press | year=1994 | isbn=1-56670-023-X }}  [http://www.crcpress.com/shopping_cart/products/product_detail.asp?sku=L1023&amp;parent_id=&amp;pc= www.crcpress.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105075907/http://www.crcpress.com/shopping_cart/products/product_detail.asp?sku=L1023&amp;parent_id=&amp;pc= |date=2007-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Beychok, Milton R.|title=[[Fundamentals Of Stack Gas Dispersion]]|edition=4th|publisher=author-published|year=2005|isbn=0-9644588-0-2}} [http://www.air-dispersion.com www.air-dispersion.com]&lt;/ref&gt; to describe transport, transformation and deposition of [[air pollutant]]s. The models range in spatial resolution from local air pollution in a single street, to both nationwide and global air pollution. NERI compiles Danish [[emission inventory|emission inventories]] as part of Denmark's obligations in accordance with international conventions.

NERI also participates in many international collaboration networks within the field of air pollution, and it hosts websites for several such networks.

NERI's Department of Atmospheric Environment (ATMI) has a staff of over 65 scientists and researchers who conduct work within the following fields:

* Monitoring and mapping of the [[air quality]] in Denmark and the Arctic. 
* Research, development and application of atmospheric chemical dispersion models.
* Studying air pollution scenarios and prognoses as well as air pollution from vehicular traffic.
* Studies, analyses, and models for the transport, transformation and fate of [[toxic]] air pollutants.

The '''Newbury Principles''' collectively refer to an [[urban planning]] guideline stating that decisions should be made based only on the planning considerations relevant to the current development, even if the consideration of ulterior purposes may lead to a greater public good. In practice, the principles are used as a test to verify the validity of conditions to be imposed by a planning authority. 

Specifically, the decision of the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] in ''Newbury District Council v Secretary of State for the Environment'',&lt;ref&gt;''Newbury District Council v Secretary of State for the Environment'' [1981] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 578.&lt;/ref&gt; contains the following three principles when considering the reasonableness of imposing conditions on consents:

# It must be imposed for a planning purpose.
# It must fairly and reasonably relate to the development for which permission is being given.
# It must be reasonable.

The Newbury principles are applied in [[Australia]], and have been cited by courts in [[New South Wales]] and [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1981+AC+578 LawCite records].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For example:

[[File:NotationsCage.jpg|thumb|First edition]]
{{Italics title}}
'''''Notations''''' is a book that was edited and compiled by American [[avant-garde]] [[composer]] [[John Cage]] (1912–1992) with [[Alison Knowles]] and first published in 1969 by Something Else Press.{{Sfn|Cage|Knowles|1969}}{{Sfn|John Cage Collection}} The book is made up of a large collection of [[graphical scores]], [[facsimile]]s of [[holograph]]s, from the [[Foundation for Contemporary Arts|Foundation for Contemporary Performance Arts]], with text by 269 [[composer]]s, which are presented in alphabetical order, with each score allotted equal space, and in which the editor has no more authority than the reader in assigning value to the work.{{Sfn|Kostelanetz}} The book includes the manuscript for the Beatles song "The Word" (song lyrics, but no musical notation) from the ''Rubber Soul'' album (1965).

The text of the book was created using chance procedures to determine which of the 269 composers would be asked to write about their work, and how many words each entry was to consist of. These pieces of writing, which contain from one to sixty-four words, are proceeded by paragraph signs. The typesetting was done by Alison Knowles using chance-derived mixtures of typefaces and sizes. There are also comments by Cage and other writers included throughout the book, typeset using similar procedures.

In 2009, Mark Batty Publisher released ''Notations 21''. Inspired by the work of Cage and Knowles, it contained illustrated musical scores from more than 100 composers along with commentary from each composer.

An '''overview''' in [[policy debate]] is part of a [[structure of policy debate|speech]] which is flagged as not responding to the line-by-line arguments on the [[flow (policy debate)|flow]]. An overview may be "global" if presented at the beginning of a speech or "local" if presented at the beginning of a position.

Overviews typically list the order a debater's speech will be given in. For instance, On-Case, Co-op Disadvantage, Spending Disadvantage, Weapon Disadvantage would be an expected overview.

Debaters will usually inform the [[judge (policy debate)|judge]] where they will be giving an overview before they start a speech because it can make it harder to flow the speech. A small minority of judges dislike this practice and will start speech time when a debater starts giving this order.

Many judges dislike overviews because, since many are scripted before the round begins, they tend to be non-responsive or repetitive and are often long. However, most judges and coaches support the practice for arguments which cannot be placed anywhere on the line-by-line or that need to be flagged for their importance.

The above is also informally known as a "road map"

Another form of an overview is of specifically in the section of the speech(i.e. [[Topicality (policy debate)|Topicality]], [[Kritik]], Disadvantage, Counter-Plan, etc). This is commonly announced before the debater's speech and will signpost an overview.

The overview usually consists of star/main arguments being made and more than likely tend to contain extended evidence or authors. This practice is used to elaborate an argument and/or bring it back up in order for the judge to be aware of the main arguments being made by a team.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1407">'''Phytosemiotics''' is a branch of [[biosemiotics]] that studies the [[sign process]]es in plants, or more broadly, the vegetative [[semiosis]]. Vegetative semiosis is a type of sign processes that occurs at cellular and tissue level, including cellular recognition, [[plant perception (physiology)|plant perception]], plant [[signal transduction]], intercellular communication, immunological processes, etc.

The term 'phytosemiotics' has been introduced by [[Martin Krampen]] in 1981.

A '''pragmatic sanction''' is a sovereign's solemn decree on a matter of primary importance and has the force of fundamental law. In the late history of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] it referred more specifically to an edict issued by the Emperor.

When used as a proper noun, and the year is not mentioned, it usually refers to the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713]], a legal mechanism designed to ensure that the Austrian throne and Habsburg lands would be inherited by [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles VI's]] daughter, [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]].

Pragmatic sanctions tend to be issued at times in which the theoretically ideal situation is untenable, and a change of the rules is called for.
*The Pragmatic Sanction of [[Justinian I]], promulgated in August 554, on the reorganization of [[Italy]] following the [[Gothic War (535–554)|Gothic War]].
*The so-called Pragmatic Sanction of [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]], purporting to have been issued in March 1269, regarding various clerical reforms, was a forgery fabricated in the 15th century.
*The [[Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges]], issued on July 7, 1438 by King [[Charles VII of France]], limited the authority of the pope over the Church within France.
*The German [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1439]], issued by German ruling princes March 26, 1439, accepted some of the decrees of the [[Council of Basel]] with modifications. It has been argued that the name ''Pragmatic Sanction'' is not properly applied to this document, as it was issued by princes subordinate to the emperor without the emperor's endorsement.
*The [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1549]], issued by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Charles V]], established the [[Seventeen Provinces]] as an entity. 
*The [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713]] issued by Emperor Charles VI on April 19, 1713, by which the Habsburg hereditary possessions (Austria, Bohemia, Hungary, and various other smaller lands) were allowed to pass to a woman (specifically [[Maria Theresa]]) if [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]] had no male heirs.
**The Croatian [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1712]], passed by the [[Sabor|Diet]] of the Habsburg [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Kingdom of Croatia]] and predating the Austrian decree, allowing the Croatian throne to pass to the female line of the House of Habsburg.
**The [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1723]] passed by the Hungarian Parliament, accepting female inheritance in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. Charles VI had permitted Hungary to revert to elective monarchy should he die without a male heir; this instrument signalled the Hungarian parliament's acceptance of his choice of successor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/southernslavques00seto/southernslavques00seto_djvu.txt R. W. SETON -WATSON: The southern Slav question and the Habsburg Monarchy page 22]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Pragmatic Sanction of Naples]], issued October 6, 1759, by King [[Charles III of Spain]], governed the succession to the thrones of Naples, Sicily, and Spain, and forbade the union of Spain and the Two Sicilies.
*The Spanish [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1830]], issued March 29, 1830 by King [[Ferdinand VII of Spain]], ratified a Decree of 1789 by [[Charles IV of Spain]], which had replaced the semi-[[Salic law|Salic]] system established by Philip V with the [[male-preference primogeniture]] system that had historically characterized the Castilian monarchy (upon which the Spanish monarchy draws its traditions), as exemplified by the inheritance by queens regnant [[Urraca of Castile|Urraca]], [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella I]], and [[Joanna of Castile|Joanna]].

'''Projexity''' is a Canadian company that offers online audience engagement tools to groups, organizations and municipalities. Projexity's tools have predominantly been used by organizations with strong social impact mandates like the David Suzuki Foundation.

Projexity's tools aim to make it easy for the public to submit content such as events and initiatives to organizations directly through their own websites, effectively transforming any website into a dynamic community hub.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://projexity.com/ |title=About |publisher=Projexity |date= |accessdate=2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The platform was originally created by designers [[Nicolas Koff]] and [[Marisa Bernstein]], and computer programmer [[Jonathan Koff]] as a means to bring more public engagement and transparency to the often exclusive city building process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/metromorning/episodes/2013/04/04/crowd-sourcing/ |title=Metro Morning &amp;#124; Crowdsourcing |publisher=CBC.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Relative pitch''' is the ability of a person to identify or re-create a given [[musical note]] by comparing it to a reference note and identifying the interval between those two notes. Relative pitch implies some or all of the following abilities:
* Determine the distance of a musical note from a set point of reference, e.g. "three [[octave]]s above [[middle C]]"
* Identify the intervals between given tones, regardless of their relation to [[concert pitch]] (A = 440&amp;nbsp;Hz)
* the skill used by singers to correctly sing a melody, following [[musical notation]], by pitching each note in the melody according to its distance from the previous note.  Alternatively, the same skill which allows someone to hear a melody for the first time and name the notes relative to some known [[Ear training#Functional pitch recognition|reference pitch]].

This last definition, which applies not only to singers but also to players of instruments who rely on their own skill to determine the precise pitch of the notes played (wind instruments, fretless string instruments like violin or viola, etc.), is an essential skill for musicians in order to play successfully with others. As an example, think of the different [[concert pitch]]es used by orchestras playing music from different styles (a baroque orchestra using [[Historically informed performance|period instruments]] might decide to use a higher-tuned pitch).

Unlike [[absolute pitch]] (sometimes called "perfect pitch"), relative pitch is quite common among musicians, especially musicians who are used to "playing by ear", and a precise relative pitch is a constant characteristic among good musicians. Unlike perfect pitch, relative pitch can be developed through [[ear training]].&lt;ref&gt;Humphries, Lee. [http://www.thinkingapplied.com/sight-singing_folder/sight-singing.pdf ''Learning to Sight-Sing: The Mental Mechanics of Aural Imagery.''] Minneapolis: Thinking Applied, 2008, No. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Computer-aided ear training is becoming a popular tool for musicians and music students, and various software is available for improving relative pitch.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Some music teachers teach their students relative pitch by having them associate each possible interval with the first two notes of a popular song. (See [[ear training]].) Another method of developing relative pitch is playing melodies by ear on a musical instrument, especially one which, unlike a piano or other fingered instrument, requires a specific manual adjustment for each particular tone.  Indian musicians learn relative pitch by singing intervals over a [[drone (music)|drone]], which is also described by [[W. A. Mathieu]]{{Full citation needed|date=August 2018}} using Western [[just intonation]] terminology. Many Western ear training classes use [[solfège]] to teach students relative pitch, while others use [[numerical sight-singing]].

Compound intervals (intervals greater than an octave) can be more difficult to detect than simple intervals (intervals less than an octave).{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Interval recognition is used to identify chords, and can be applied to accurately tune an instrument with respect to a given reference tone, even if the tone is not in [[concert pitch]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

'''Rights''' are [[law|legal]], social, or [[ethics|ethical]] [[principle]]s of [[Liberty|freedom]] or [[entitlement]]; that is, rights are the fundamental [[normative]] rules about what is allowed of people or owed to people, according to some legal system, social convention, or ethical theory.&lt;ref name=tws21decgghg/&gt; Rights are of essential importance in such disciplines as [[law]] and [[ethics]], especially theories of [[justice]] and [[deontology]].
 
Rights are often considered fundamental to [[civilization]], for they are regarded as established pillars of [[society]] and [[culture]],&lt;ref&gt;UN [[UDHR]] Preamble: "Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world..."&lt;/ref&gt; and the history of [[social conflict]]s can be found in the history of each right and its development. According to the ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', "rights structure the form of [[government]]s, the content of [[laws]], and the shape of [[morality]] as it is currently perceived".&lt;ref name=tws21decgghg/&gt;

[[File:RNC 04 protest 89.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Street protest scene; people deliberately lying down on a busy city street, surrounded by onlookers and police|Rights are widely regarded as the basis of law, but what if laws are bad? Some theorists suggest [[civil disobedience]] is, itself, a ''right'', and it was advocated by thinkers such as [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], and [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]].]]
There is considerable disagreement about what is meant precisely by the term ''rights''. It has been used by different groups and thinkers for different purposes, with different and sometimes opposing definitions, and the precise definition of this principle, beyond having something to do with normative rules of some sort or another, is controversial.

One way to get an idea of the multiple understandings and senses of the term is to consider different ways it is used. Many diverse things are claimed as rights: {{cquote|A right to life, a right to choose; a right to vote, to work, to strike; a right to one phone call, to dissolve parliament, to operate a forklift, to asylum, to equal treatment before the law, to feel proud of what one has done; a right to exist, to sentence an offender to death, to launch a nuclear first strike, to carry a concealed weapon, to a distinct genetic identity; a right to believe one's own eyes, to pronounce the couple husband and wife, to be left alone, to go to hell in one's own way.&lt;ref name=tws21decgghg&gt;{{cite news
|title = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy
|quote = Rights dominate most modern understandings of what actions are proper and which institutions are just. Rights structure the forms of our governments, the contents of our laws, and the shape of morality as we perceive it. To accept a set of rights is to approve a distribution of freedom and authority, and so to endorse a certain view of what may, must, and must not be done.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There are likewise diverse possible ways to categorize rights, such as:
{{cquote|''Who'' is alleged to have the right: Children's rights, animal rights, workers' rights, states' rights, the rights of peoples. ''What actions or states or objects'' the asserted right pertains to: Rights of free expression, to pass judgment; rights of privacy, to remain silent; property rights, bodily rights. ''Why'' the rightholder (allegedly) has the right: Moral rights spring from moral reasons, legal rights derive from the laws of the society, customary rights are aspects of local customs. ''How the asserted right can be affected'' by the rightholder's actions: The inalienable right to life, the forfeitable right to liberty, and the waivable right that a promise be kept.&lt;ref name=tws21decgghg/&gt;}}
There has been considerable debate about what this term means within the academic community, particularly within fields such as [[philosophy]], [[law]], [[deontology]], [[logic]], [[political science]], and [[religion]].

===Natural versus legal===
[[File:Brueghel Jan II God creating.jpg|thumb|right|alt=painting of dark gray skies with trees and water, and a human image, flying, with arms outstretched|According to some views, certain rights derive from [[deities]] or [[nature]]]]
{{Main|Natural and legal rights}}
* '''Natural rights''' are rights which are "natural" in the sense of "not artificial, not man-made", as in rights deriving from [[human nature]] or from the [[divine command theory|edicts of a god]]. They are universal; that is, they apply to all people, and do not derive from the laws of any specific society. They exist necessarily, inhere in every individual, and can't be taken away. For example, it has been argued that humans have a natural ''right to life''. These are sometimes called ''[[natural and legal rights|moral rights]]'' or ''inalienable rights''.
* '''Legal rights''', in contrast, are based on a society's customs, laws, [[statute]]s or actions by [[legislature]]s. An example of a legal right is the ''right to vote'' of citizens. [[Citizenship]], itself, is often considered as the basis for having legal rights, and has been defined as the "right to have rights". Legal rights are sometimes called ''[[civil rights]]'' or ''statutory rights'' and are culturally and politically [[moral relativism|relative]] since they depend on a specific societal context to have meaning.

Some thinkers see rights in only one sense while others accept that both senses have a measure of validity. There has been considerable philosophical debate about these senses throughout history. For example, [[Jeremy Bentham]] believed that legal rights were the essence of rights, and he denied the existence of natural rights; whereas [[Thomas Aquinas]] held that rights purported by [[positive law]] but not grounded in [[natural law]] were not properly rights at all, but only a facade or pretense of rights.

===Claim versus liberty===
[[File:Chorin deed 1273.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Picture of a deed which has hand-written writing on a yellowed piece of paper with three gold tassles at the bottom|A [[deed]] is an example of a ''claim right'' in the sense that it asserts a ''right'' to own land. This particular deed dates back to 1273.]]
{{Main|Claim rights and liberty rights}}
* A '''claim right''' is a right which entails that another person has a duty to the right-holder. Somebody else must do or refrain from doing something to or for the ''claim holder'', such as perform a service or supply a product for him or her; that is, he or she has a ''claim'' to that service or product (another term is ''[[thing in action]]'').&lt;ref name=IEP&gt;Fagan, Andrew. "Human Rights". ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' http://www.iep.utm.edu/hum-rts/#SH3b&lt;/ref&gt; In logic, this idea can be expressed as: "Person ''A'' has a claim that person ''B'' do something if and only if ''B'' has a duty to ''A'' to do that something." Every claim-right entails that some other duty-bearer must do some duty for the claim to be satisfied. This duty can be to act or to refrain from acting. For example, many jurisdictions recognize broad claim rights to things like "life, liberty, and property"; these rights impose an obligation upon others ''not'' to assault or restrain a person, or use their property, without the claim-holder's permission. Likewise, in jurisdictions where social welfare services are provided, citizens have legal claim rights to be provided with those services.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}
* A '''liberty right''' or ''privilege'', in contrast, is simply a freedom or permission for the right-holder to do something, and there are ''no obligations'' on other parties to do or not do anything.&lt;ref name="IEP" /&gt; This can be expressed in logic as: "Person ''A'' has a privilege to do something if and only if ''A'' has no duty not to do that something." For example, if a person has a legal liberty right to free speech, that merely means that it is not legally forbidden for them to speak freely: it does ''not'' mean that anyone has to help enable their speech, or to listen to their speech; or even, per se, refrain from stopping them from speaking, though ''other'' rights, such as the claim right to be free from assault, may severely limit what others can do to stop them.

Liberty rights and claim rights are the inverse of one another: a person has a liberty right permitting him to do something only if there is no other person who has a claim right forbidding him from doing so. Likewise, if a person has a claim right against someone else, then that other person's liberty is limited. For example, a person has a ''liberty right'' to walk down a sidewalk and can decide freely whether or not to do so, since there is no obligation either to do so or to refrain from doing so. But pedestrians may have an obligation not to walk on certain lands, such as other people's private property, to which those other people have a claim right. So a person's ''liberty right'' of walking extends precisely to the point where another's ''claim right'' limits his or her freedom.

===Positive versus negative===
{{Main|Negative and positive rights}}
In one sense, a right is a permission to do something or an entitlement to a specific service or treatment from others, and these rights have been called ''positive rights''. However, in another sense, rights may allow or require inaction, and these are called ''negative rights''; they permit or require doing nothing. For example, in some countries, e.g. the [[United States]], citizens have the ''positive right'' to vote and they have the ''negative right'' to not vote; people can choose not to vote in a given election without punishment. In other countries, e.g. [[Australia]], however, citizens have a positive right to vote but they don't have a negative right to not vote, since [[compulsory voting|voting is compulsory]]. Accordingly:
* '''Positive rights''' are permissions to do things, or entitlements to be done unto. One example of a positive right is the purported "right to welfare."&lt;ref name=tws21decgkfjf/&gt;
* '''Negative rights''' are permissions not to do things, or entitlements to be left alone. Often the distinction is invoked by [[libertarianism|libertarians]] who think of a ''negative right'' as an entitlement to non-interference such as a right against being assaulted.&lt;ref name=tws21decgkfjf&gt;{{cite news
|title = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy
|quote = A distinction between negative and positive rights is popular among some normative theorists, especially those with a bent toward libertarianism. The holder of a negative right is entitled to non-interference, while the holder of a positive right is entitled to provision of some good or service. A right against assault is a classic example of a negative right, while a right to welfare assistance is a prototypical positive right.

|date = July 9, 2007

|accessdate = 2009-12-21
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though similarly named, positive and negative rights should not be confused with ''active rights'' (which encompass "privileges" and "powers") and ''passive rights'' (which encompass "claims" and "immunities").

===Individual versus group===
{{Main|Individual and group rights}}
The general concept of rights is that they are possessed by individuals in the sense that they are permissions and entitlements to do things which other persons, or which governments or authorities, can not infringe. This is the understanding of people such as the author [[Ayn Rand]] who argued that only individuals have rights, according to her philosophy known as [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]].&lt;ref name=tws18decafafa&gt;{{cite news
|author = Ayn Rand
|title = The Virtue of Selfishness: Individual Rights
|quote = Individual rights are not subject to a public vote; a majority has no right to vote away the rights of a minority; the political function of rights is precisely to protect minorities from oppression by majorities (and the smallest minority on earth is the individual). see page 104. See also: [[Group rights#Objectivist view|Collectivized 'Rights]]
|publisher = ''The Ayn Rand Lexicon''
|date = 2009-12-18
|url = http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/individual_rights.html
|accessdate = 2009-12-18
}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, others have argued that there are situations in which a group of persons is thought to have rights, or ''group rights''. Accordingly:
* '''Individual rights''' are rights held by individual people regardless of their group membership or lack thereof.
[[File:Malian Soldiers.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Soldiers lined up in a row, with green caps, carrying rifles|Do groups have ''rights''? Some argue that when soldiers bond in [[combat]], the group becomes like an organism in itself and has ''rights'' which trump the rights of any individual soldier.]]
* '''Group rights''' have been argued to exist when a group is seen as more than a mere composite or assembly of separate individuals but an entity in its own right. In other words, it's possible to see a group as a distinct being in and of itself; it's akin to an enlarged individual, a corporate body, which has a distinct will and power of action and can be thought of as having ''rights''. For example, a platoon of soldiers in [[combat]] can be thought of as a distinct group, since individual members are willing to risk their lives for the survival of the group, and therefore the group can be conceived as having a "right" which is superior to that of any individual member; for example, a soldier who disobeys an officer can be punished, perhaps even killed, for a breach of obedience.  But there is another sense of group rights in which people who are members of a group can be thought of as having specific individual rights because of their membership in a group. In this sense, the set of rights which individuals-as-group-members have is expanded because of their membership in a group. For example, workers who are members of a group such as a [[Trade union|labor union]] can be thought of as having expanded individual rights because of their membership in the labor union, such as the rights to specific working conditions or wages. As expected, there is sometimes considerable disagreement about what exactly is meant by the term "group" as well as by the term "group rights."{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

There can be tension between individual and group rights. A classic instance in which group and individual rights clash is conflicts between unions and their members. For example, individual members of a union may wish a wage higher than the union-negotiated wage, but are prevented from making further requests; in a so-called [[closed shop]] which has a [[union security agreement]], only the union has a ''right'' to decide matters for the individual union members such as wage rates. So, do the supposed "individual rights" of the workers prevail about the proper wage? Or do the "group rights" of the union regarding the proper wage prevail? Clearly this is a source of tension.

The [[Austrian School|Austrian School of Economics]] holds that only individuals think, feel, and act whether or not members of any abstract group. The society should thus according to economists of the school be analyzed starting from the individual. This methodology is called [[methodological individualism]] and is used by the economists to justify [[individual rights]].

===Other senses===
Other distinctions between rights draw more on historical association or [[family resemblance]] than on precise philosophical distinctions. These include the distinction between '''[[civil and political rights]]''' and '''[[economic, social and cultural rights]]''', between which the articles of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] are often divided. Another conception of rights groups them into '''[[three generations of human rights|three generations]]'''. These distinctions have much overlap with that between [[negative and positive rights]], as well as between [[individual rights]] and [[group rights]], but these groupings are not entirely coextensive.

==Politics==
[[File:Man being arrested.jpg|thumb|right|alt=three police officers surround a man in a tee shirt who is handcuffed|In the [[United States]], persons who are going to be questioned by police when they are in police custody must be read their "Miranda rights". The [[Miranda warning]] requires police officers to read a statement to people being arrested which informs them that they have certain rights, such as the right to remain silent and the right to have an attorney.]]
Rights are often included in the foundational questions that governments and politics have been designed to deal with. Often the development of these socio-political institutions have formed a dialectical relationship with rights.

Rights about particular issues, or the rights of particular groups, are often areas of special concern. Often these concerns arise when rights come into conflict with other legal or moral issues, sometimes even other rights.  Issues of concern have historically included [[labor rights]], [[LGBT social movements|LGBT rights]], [[reproductive rights]], [[disability rights]], [[patient rights]] and [[prisoners' rights]].  With increasing [[mass surveillance|monitoring]] and the information society, [[digital rights|information rights]], such as the [[right to privacy]] are becoming more important.

Accordingly, politics plays an important role in developing or recognizing the above rights, and the discussion about which behaviors are included as "rights" is an ongoing political topic of importance. The concept of rights varies with political orientation. Positive rights such as a "right to medical care" are emphasized more often by left-leaning thinkers, while right-leaning thinkers place more emphasis on negative rights such as the "right to a fair trial".

Further, the term ''equality'' which is often bound up with the meaning of "rights" often depends on one's political orientation. [[Conservatism|Conservatives]] and [[Libertarianism|libertarians]] and advocates of [[free markets]] often identify equality with [[equality of opportunity]], and want equal and fair rules in the process of making things, while agreeing that sometimes these fair rules lead to unequal outcomes. In contrast, [[socialism|socialists]] often identify equality with [[equality of outcome]] and see fairness when people have equal amounts of goods and services, and therefore think that people have a right to equal portions of necessities such as [[health care]] or [[Welfare|economic assistance]] or [[House|housing]].&lt;ref name=tws21dece563e&gt;{{cite news

|title = Roemer on equality of opportunity
|quote = Equality of opportunity is to be contrasted with equality of outcome. While advocacy of the latter has been traditionally associated with a left-wing political philosophy, the former has been championed by conservative political philosophy. Equality of outcome fails to hold individuals responsible for imprudent actions that may, absent redress, reduce the values of the outcomes they enjoy, or for wise actions that would raise the value of the outcomes above the levels of others’. Equality of opportunity, in contrast, ‘levels the playing field,’ so that all have the potential to achieve the same outcomes; whether or not, in the event, they do, depends upon individual choice.

==Philosophy==
In [[philosophy]], [[meta-ethics]] is the branch of ethics that seeks to understand the nature of ethical [[property (philosophy)|properties]], statements, attitudes, and judgments. Meta-ethics is one of the three branches of ethics generally recognized by philosophers, the others being [[normative ethics]] and [[applied ethics]].

While normative ethics addresses such questions as "What should one do?", thus endorsing some ethical evaluations and rejecting others, meta-ethics addresses questions such as "What ''is'' goodness?" and "How can we tell what is good from what is bad?", seeking to understand the nature of ethical properties and evaluations.

Rights ethics is an answer to the meta-ethical question of ''what normative ethics is concerned with'' (Meta-ethics also includes a group of questions about how ethics comes to be known, true, etc. which is not directly addressed by rights ethics).
Rights ethics holds that normative ethics is concerned with rights. Alternative meta-ethical theories are that ethics is concerned with one of the following:
* Duties ([[deontology]])
* [[Value (ethics)|Value]] ([[axiology]])
* Virtue ([[virtue ethics]])
* Consequences ([[consequentialism]], e.g. [[utilitarianism]])

Rights ethics has had considerable influence on political and social thinking. The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] gives some concrete examples of widely accepted rights.

===Criticism===
Some philosophers have criticised rights as [[ontologically]] dubious entities.  For instance, although in favour of the extension of [[individual rights|individual legal rights]], the [[utilitarian]] philosopher [[Jeremy Bentham]] opposed the idea of [[natural law]] and [[natural rights]], calling them "nonsense upon stilts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Harrison |first=Ross |chapterurl=http://www.utilitarian.net/bentham/about/1995----.htm |chapter=Jeremy Bentham |editor-last=Honderich |editor-first=Ted |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |location= |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1995 |pages=85–88 }} Also see {{cite web |last=Sweet |first=William |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/b/bentham.htm |title=Jeremy Bentham |work=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=11 April 2001 |accessdate=7 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, one can question the ability of rights to actually bring about justice for all.

==Etymology==
[[File:Beowulf - rihte.jpg|thumb|"rihte," an Old English word for 'right']]
The [[Modern English]] word ''right'' derives from [[Old English]] ''riht'' or ''reht'', in turn from [[Proto-Germanic]] ''*riχtaz'' meaning "right" or "direct", and ultimately from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''*reg-to-'' meaning "having moved in a straight line", in turn from ''*(o)reg'(a)-'' meaning "to straighten or direct".&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:right]]&lt;/ref&gt; In several different [[Indo-European languages]], a single word derived from the same root means both "right" and "law", such as French ''droit'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:droit]]&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish ''derecho'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:derecho]]&lt;/ref&gt; German ''Recht'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:recht]]&lt;/ref&gt; and Italian ''diritto''.

Many other words related to normative or regulatory concepts derive from this same root, including ''correct'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:correct]]&lt;/ref&gt;  ''regulate'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:regulate]]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''rex''&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:rex#latin]]&lt;/ref&gt; (meaning "king"), whence ''regal''&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:regal]]&lt;/ref&gt; and thence ''royal''.&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:royal]]&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise many more geometric terms derive from this same root, such as ''erect'' (as in "upright"),&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:erect]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''rectangle'' (literally "[[right angle]]"),&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:rectangle]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''straight''&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:straight]]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''stretch''.&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:stretch]]&lt;/ref&gt; Like ''right'', the English words ''rule''&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:rule]]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''ruler'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:ruler]]&lt;/ref&gt; deriving still from the same root, have both normative or regulatory and geometric meanings (e.g. a ruler as in a king, or a ruler as in a straightedge).

Several other roots have similar normative and geometric descendants, such as Latin ''norma'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:norma#latin]]&lt;/ref&gt; whence ''[[norm (philosophy)|norm]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:norm]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''normal'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:normal]]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''normative''&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:normative]]&lt;/ref&gt; itself, and also geometric concepts such as ''[[Normal (geometry)|normal vectors]]''; and likewise Greek ''ortho''&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:ortho]]&lt;/ref&gt; and Latin ''ordo'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:ordo]]&lt;/ref&gt; meaning either "right" or "correct" (as in ''orthodox'', meaning "correct opinion"&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:orthodox]]&lt;/ref&gt;) or "straight" or "perpendicular" (as in ''orthogonal'', meaning "perpendicular angle"&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:orthogonal]]&lt;/ref&gt;), and thence ''order'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:order]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''ordinary'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:ordinary]]&lt;/ref&gt; etc.

==History==
{{see also|History of human rights}}
[[File:Magna Carta (British Library Cotton MS Augustus II.106).jpg|thumb|right|The ''[[Magna Carta]]'' or "Great Charter" was one of England's first documents containing commitments by a [[monarch|king]] to his people to respect certain [[law|legal]] rights. It reduced the power of the monarch.]]

The specific enumeration of rights has differed greatly in different periods of history. In many cases, the system of rights promulgated by one group has come into sharp and bitter conflict with that of other groups. In the political sphere, a place in which rights have historically been an important issue, constitutional provisions of various states sometimes address the question of who has what legal rights.

Historically, many notions of rights were [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] and [[hierarchy|hierarchical]], with different people granted different rights, and some having more rights than others. For instance, the right of a father to respected from his son did not indicate a right from the son to receive a return from that respect; and the [[divine right of kings]], which permitted absolute power over subjects, did not leave a lot of room for many rights for the subjects themselves.&lt;ref name=tws21decfrre&gt;{{cite news

'''Shalva''' (The Israel Association for Care and Inclusion of Persons with Disabilities) ([[Hebrew]]: שַׁלְוָה) is a registered [[non-profit organization]]&lt;ref name="shalva on the Israeli Corporations Authority"&gt;{{cite web|title=Israeli Corporations Authority|url=http://index.justice.gov.il/Units/RasutHataagidim/units/RashamAmutot/services/Pages/amuttview.aspx|website=Israeli Corporations Authority|accessdate=28 January 2015|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; that supports and empowers individuals with [[disabilities]] and their families in [[Israel]]. The organization works with a wide range of individuals with disabilities: [[mental retardation]], [[developmental delays]], [[learning disabilities]], attention deficit disorders, the [[Autism spectrum]], [[special needs]] with recognized [[Disability|handicaps]] (children with minor to severe [[Intellectual disability|retardation]], [[Down syndrome]], [[Fragile X syndrome]]), and more.

Founded by [[Kalman Samuels]] in 1990, the organization offers a range of programs to approximately 2000 individuals with disabilities including [[infants]], [[children]], and [[youth]] and their families. Non-denominational and free of charge, Shalva offers a range of therapies, inclusive educational frameworks, recreational programs, vocational training, respite and family support.  Shalva advocates for the inclusion of persons with disabilities through employment programs, community initiatives, and  disability research.  Shalva collaborates with communities worldwide as well as government, academic, and cultural institutions to pioneer innovative therapy solutions around the common goal of improving the lives of people with disabilities and promoting their inclusion in society.  The organization is supported by a wide network of [[volunteering|volunteers]] from the broader community as well as National Service volunteers. 

Shalva's programs have been distinguished by several awards, among them: the President of Israel Prize for Excellence (1994); the Mayor of Jerusalem Award for Exceptional Service (1999); the Shalem Fund Award for “Israel’s most unique program for the mentally challenged” (2004); the Knesset Speaker’s Quality of Life Prize for Leadership and Public Excellence (2005); the Ruderman Foundation Prize for the integration of children with special needs (2012); and Consultant Status for the United Nations Economic and Social Council (2018).  The organization’s management standards are recognized by the ISO 9001/2001 certification and Midot’s Seal for Outstanding Eﬀectiveness. 
==Background==
As [[parents]] of a child with disabilities,&lt;ref name="Never stop dreaming"&gt;{{cite news|title=Never stop dreaming|url=http://www.cjnews.com/news/%E2%80%98never-stop-dreaming%E2%80%99-says-dad-child-special-needs|accessdate=28 January 2015|work=The Canadian Jewish News|date=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kalman and Malki Samuels understood the need for the founding of an organization that would ease the burdens of families of children with disabilities. Their son, Yossi Samuels, was born a healthy child in 1977 however, after receiving a faulty [[DPT vaccine|DPT vaccination]], he was rendered [[blindness|blind]], [[deaf]], and [[hyperactive]]. He was isolated in his own world without a method of communication. Based on their personal experience with the day-to-day challenges of raising a family and the constant need to care for a child with special needs, they decided to establish Shalva in 1990.

The first center was established in a private apartment in the [[Har Nof]] neighborhood in [[Jerusalem]] and catered to a few dozen local children. As a greater need emerged, the organization bought an additional facility on an adjacent street and began expanding its programs; the building was later called ”Beit Nachshon” in memory of [[Nachshon Wachsman]] who was kidnapped and murdered by [[terrorists]] in 1994.&lt;ref name="Esther Wachsman, Mother of slain soldier presents Gilad Shalit with Spirit of Hope Award"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Friedson|first1=Felice|title=Esther Wachsman, Mother of slain soldier presents Gilad Shalit with Spirit of Hope Award|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/live_from_the_arab_spring/article/mother_of_slain_soldier_presents_gilad_shalit_with_spirit_of_hope_award|accessdate=30 January 2015|work=Jewish Journal|date=March 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, programs with innovative therapies were developed for infants, and the organization began to support [[research]] in various subjects in its field.&lt;ref name="Israel joins validation of test to detect Down syndrome"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Siegel-Itzkovich|first1=Judy|title=Israel joins validation of test to detect Down syndrome|url=http://www.jpost.com/Health-and-Science/Israel-joins-validation-of-test-to-detect-Down-syndrome|accessdate=30 January 2015|work=The Jerusalem Post|date=March 3, 2012|ref=Israel joins validation of test to detect Down syndrome}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Shalva's programs are housed in the Shalva National Center in the [[Bayit VeGan|Bayit Vegan]] near the [[Shaare Zedek Medical Center]].

[[File:Tippelzone amsterdam.jpg|thumb|300px|View of sex drive-in facility in Amsterdam (where panels do not reach to the ground), which is now closed]]

A '''sex drive-in''' or '''sex box''' is a car garage (or similarly shielded location) that is designed to allow [[prostitution]] to take place using cars, and can be found in a few countries in Europe. Generally the facilities are created by local authorities to put some control on where prostitution occurs and to provide increased safety.

==Background==

The concept started in the Netherlands where such facilities are called ''afwerkplek'' (literally meaning "a place to finish the work"; more to the point, "a sheltered area, provided by the authorities, where prostitutes provide their services"&lt;ref name="Ammon2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Swaan|first=Abram de|editor=Ulrich Ammon|title=The Dominance of English As a Language of Science: Effects on Other Languages and Language Communities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NEulLJm9dqQC&amp;pg=PA76|date=2001|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=9783110166477|page=76|chapter=English in the Social Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and was first used in [[Utrecht]] starting in 1986.&lt;ref name="first"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ARBTTMC4cF8C&amp;pg=PA225&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false AIDS: Prevention Through Education : a World View], p. 225 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1986-one"&gt;(18 August 2008).

There, a football field-sized, fenced-in space of a former industrial area (typically the kind of area where there are no residents to complain about the location), with a gated entry, security cameras, and alarm buttons in each stall.&lt;ref name="ref3"&gt;(7 July 2005). [http://www.dw.de/cologne-leads-the-way-in-safe-prostitution/a-1641575-1 Cologne Leads the Way in Safe Prostitution], ''dw-world.de''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="koln10"&gt;(16 Sep 2010). [http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/zuerich/stadt/In-Koeln-bewaehren-sich-die-Sexboxen/story/11982755 In Köln bewähren sich die Sexboxen], ''[[Tages-Anzeiger]]'' (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally facilities are designed so that the driver cannot exit the vehicle after pulling into the structure, but the prostitute can.&lt;ref name="nzz1"&gt;(20 September 2010). [http://www.nzz.ch/aktuell/startseite/der-strassenstrich-auf-der-gruenen-wiese-1.7614942 Der Strassenstrich auf der grünen Wiese], ''[[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]]'' (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, this design width was reported to be a problem in the Utrecht sex drive-in because the growing sizes of [[sports utility vehicle|SUV]] and [[luxury car]]s meant they were having difficulties fitting into the slots.&lt;ref name="1986-one"/&gt;

==Expansion to Switzerland==

In 2013, the first facility in [[Switzerland]] opened in [[Zurich]]. In addition to security, the stalls are equipped with alarm buttons.&lt;ref name="art1"&gt;(26 August 2013). [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-23839358 Zurich introduces 'drive-in' sex], ''BBC''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="German1"&gt;(25 February 2005).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5626">The '''sustainable yield''' of [[natural capital]] is the [[ecological yield]] that can be extracted without reducing the base of capital itself, i.e. the surplus required to maintain [[ecosystem services]] at the same or increasing level over time.  This yield usually varies over time with the needs of the [[ecosystem]] to maintain itself, e.g. a [[forest]] that has recently suffered a [[blight]] or [[flooding]] or [[fire]] will require more of its own ecological yield to sustain and re-establish a mature forest.  While doing so, the sustainable yield may be much less.

In fisheries, the basic natural capital, or virgin population, must decrease with extraction. At the same time productivity increases. Hence, sustainable yield would be within the range in which the natural capital together with its production are able to provide satisfactory yield. It may be very difficult to quantify sustainable yield, because dynamic ecological conditions and other factors  not  related to harvesting induce changes and fluctuations in both the natural capital and its productivity.

==Maximum sustainable yield==
{{see also|Maximum sustainable yield}}
In [[population ecology]] and [[economics]], '''maximum sustainable yield''' or '''MSY''' is, theoretically, the largest yield/catch that can be taken from a species' stock over an indefinite period. Under the assumption of logistic growth, the MSY will be exactly at half the [[carrying capacity]] of a species, as this is the stage at when population growth is highest. The maximum sustainable yield is usually higher than the [[optimum sustainable yield]].

This [[logistic function|logistic]] model of growth is produced by a population introduced to a new habitat or with very poor numbers going through a lag phase of slow growth at first. Once it reaches a foothold population it will go through a rapid growth rate that will start to level off once the species approaches carrying capacity. The idea of maximum sustained yield is to decrease population density to the point of highest growth rate possible. This changes the number of the population, but the new number can be maintained indefinitely, ideally.

In most fisheries, the population has been decreased so significantly from their native populations, that the only way to increase production is to decrease production, and wait for populations to recover. Establishing limits is a perennial difficulty.

MSY is extensively used for fisheries management. Unlike [[Milner Baily Schaefer#Schaefer short-term catch equation|Schaefer's logistic model]], MSY in most modern fisheries models occurs at around 30% of the unexploited population size. This fraction differs among populations depending on the life history of the species and the age-specific selectivity of the fishing method.

Unfortunately errors in estimating the population dynamics of a species can lead to setting the maximum sustainable yield too high (or too low). An example of this was the New Zealand [[orange roughy]] fishery. Early quotas were based on an assumption that the orange roughy had a fairly short lifespan and bred relatively quickly. However, it was later discovered that the orange roughy lived a long time and had [[k-selection|bred slowly]] (~30 years). By this stage stocks had been largely depleted.

==Optimum sustainable yield==
{{see also|Optimum sustainable yield}}
In [[population ecology]] and [[economics]], '''optimum sustainable yield''' is the [[Level of Effort|level of effort]] (LOE) that maximizes the difference between total revenue and total cost. Or, where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. This level of effort maximizes the economic profit, or rent, of the resource being utilized. It usually corresponds to an effort level lower than that of maximum sustainable yield.

In [[environmental science]], '''optimum sustainable yield''' is the largest economical yield of a renewable resource achievable over a long time period without decreasing the ability of the population or its environment to support the continuation of this level of yield.

==Annual Sustainable Yield==
Annual Sustainable Yield (ASY) is defined as biomass that can be harvested from a fish population each year without resulting in a decline.  ASY is dynamic and is adjusted based on population levels and performance of previous years fisheries.

''The Cryptic Cosmology of Synchromysticism'']]&lt;/ref&gt; Steven Sutcliff and Carole Cusack describe synchromysticism as "part artistic practice, part spiritual or metaphysical system, part conspiracy culture",&lt;ref name=Sutcliffe&gt;[[#refSutcliffe|Sutcliffe, Steven &amp; Cusack, Carole. ''The Problem of Invented Religions'']]&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Jason Horsley]] describes it as "a form of [[postmodernism|postmodern]] [[animism]]" that "combines Jung's notion of meaningful coincidences with the quest for the divine, or self-actualization through experience of the divine."&lt;ref name=Horsley&gt;[[#refHorsley|Horsley, Jason. ''The Secret Life of Movies'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Precursors and concept == 

'''Synchronicity''' is a concept first introduced by [[Analytical psychology|analytical psychologist]] [[Carl Jung]], which holds that events are "meaningful coincidences" if they occur with no [[Causality|causal relationship]] yet seem to be meaningfully related.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Cosmos and Psyche |last=Tarnas |first=Richard |year= 2006 |publisher=Penguin Group  |location=New York|isbn=0-670-03292-1 |page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jung defined synchronicity as an "acausal connecting (togetherness) principle", "meaningful coincidence", and "acausal parallelism."&lt;ref name=Synchronicity&gt;{{cite book |author=Jung, Carl G.|title=Synchronicity: An Acausal Connecting Principle|year=1993|publisher=Bollingen Foundation|location=Bollingen, Switzerland|origyear=1952 |isbn=978-0-691-01794-5}} Since included in his ''Collected Works'' volume 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jung's belief was that, just as events may be connected by causality, they may also be connected by [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]. Jung used the concept in arguing for the existence of the [[paranormal]].&lt;ref name=Roderick&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rushnell|first1=S.|title=When God winks|date=2006|publisher=Atria Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; A believer in the paranormal, [[Arthur Koestler]] wrote extensively on synchronicity in his 1972 book ''[[The Roots of Coincidence]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Koestler, Arthur (1973). ''The Roots of Coincidence''. Vintage. {{ISBN|0-394-71934-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mysticism''', in turn, has been loosely defined as union with God or the Absolute.{{sfn|McGinn|2005}}{{sfn|Moore|2005}} An influential proponent of this understanding was [[William James]] (1842–1910), who stated that "in mystic states we both become one with the Absolute and we become aware of our oneness."{{sfn|Harmless|2007|p=14}} James popularized this use of the term "religious experience" in his ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]'',{{sfn|Hori|1999|p=47}}{{sfn|Sharf|2000}} contributing to the interpretation of mysticism as a distinctive experience, comparable to sensory experiences.{{sfn|Harmless|2007|pp=10–17}} Religious experiences belong to the "personal religion", which he considered to be "more fundamental than either theology or ecclesiasticism".{{sfn|James|1982|p=30}}

'''Synchromysticism''', as the union of synchronicity and mysticism, is thus the sense of interconnectedness and oneness with reality that comes from a heightened and enhanced awareness of synchronicity.&lt;ref name=Valis&gt;[[#refValis|Valis. ''The Cryptic Cosmology of Synchromysticism'']]&lt;/ref&gt; A form of "postmodern animism", Horsley argues that synchromysticism "underlines a common theme beneath three apparently disparate areas: that of the religious quest for meaning or 'signs,' the [[shamanism|shamanic]]/[[animism|animistic]] relationship with Nature, and the [[schizophrenia|schizophrenic's]] inability to distinguish between reality and fantasy."&lt;ref name=Horsley&gt;[[#refHorsley|Horsley, Jason. ''The Secret Life of Movies'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Within chaos magic ==

[[Chaos magic]] as a contemporary [[Magic (paranormal)|magical practice]] consisting of "techniques" (most frequently, entering into an [[altered state of consciousness]] and manipulating [[Sigil (magic)|symbols]]) to attain objective "results" in physical reality.&lt;ref name=Chryssides&gt;[[#refChryssides|Chryssides, George. ''Historical Dictionary of New Religious Movements'']]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Drury&gt;[[#refDrury|Drury, Nevill. ''The Watkins Dictionary of Magic'']]&lt;/ref&gt; From the beginning, the founders of chaos magic were explicit in stating that these "results" take the form of synchronicities, with [[Peter J. Carroll]] stating in ''Liber Null &amp; Psychonaut'' (1978):

&lt;blockquote&gt;All magical paradigms partake of some form of action at a distance, be it distance in space or time or both... In magic this is called synchronicity. A mental event, perception, or an act of will occurs at the same time (synchronously) as an event in the material world... Of course, this can always be excused as coincidence, but most magicians would be quite content with being able to arrange coincidences.&lt;ref name=Carroll2&gt;[[#refCarroll2|Carroll, Peter J. ''Liber Null &amp; Psychonaut'']]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Essentially, chaos magic consists of a set of techniques for deliberately engineering synchronicities.&lt;ref name=Carroll2&gt;[[#refCarroll2|Carroll, Peter J. ''Liber Null &amp; Psychonaut'']]&lt;/ref&gt; As Carroll makes clear in later texts, magical "results" consist of "meaningful coincidences" or "a series of events going somewhat improbably in the desired direction."&lt;ref name=Carroll4&gt;[[#refCarroll4|Carroll, Peter J. ''Octavo'']]&lt;/ref&gt; Later chaos magicians have made the link between chaos magic and synchromysticism more overt. Gordon White, for example, writes in ''Synchromysticism as Kabbalah'': 

&lt;blockquote&gt;How does the Technical [[Hermetica]] ‘work’? How did [[Ficino]]’s system of planetary [[ritual magic]] ‘work’? Simply put, both work because some things are associated with other things. Symbols recur, patterns repeat, sounds heard on a radio associate with similar outcomes in your life. An Animist universe speaks a language of symbol and synchronicity. To you, to itself, to the birds. This awareness underpins systems of magical correspondence the world over – such as practical [[Kabbalah]] or Technical Hermetica... These systems are indications that the universe speaks in a symbolic language... use them in a wider synchromystic context.&lt;ref name=White1&gt;[[#refWhite1|White, Gordon. ''Pieces of Eight'']]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Elsewhere, White speculates that this may be "the secret of kabbalistic apotheosis" – "hearing the language behind the words, connecting the things that aren't connected... a mystical framework for exploring and ''encouraging'' synchronicity."&lt;ref name=White6&gt;[[#refWhite6|White, Gordon. ''Twilight Language: The Quest for the Grail'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=September 2014}}
'''''Tempo giusto''''' ({{IPA-it|ˈtɛmpo ˈd͡ʒusto}}) is a musical term that means “in exact time”, often directing a return to strict time following a period of [[tempo rubato|rubato]]. or to play in “strict time” or “suitable time”.

==General==
The literal meaning of the term is 'in exact time'. Its most common meaning is to indicate a return to the main tempo after a temporary change (e.g. a [[rallentando]]).&lt;ref&gt;David Fallows. 'Tempo giusto' in Grove Music Online. Oxford University Press. www.oxfordmusiconline.com. Accessed 20 Feb 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th and 18th centuries ([[Baroque music|Baroque]] and [[Classical period (music)|early Classical]]), ''tempo giusto'' referred to the idea that each [[Metre (music)|meter]] has its own 'ideal' tempo. The larger the beat value of the meter, the slower the tempo. Therefore, meters with beat values of a minim/half note (e.g. {{music|time|2|2}}, {{music|time|3|2}}) should be performed with a slow tempo; those with quaver/eighth note beats (e.g. {{music|time|3|8}}) are fast; while those with crotchet/quarter note beats (e.g. {{music|time|2|4}}, {{music|time|3|4}}, {{music|time|4|4}}) are performed at a moderate or middling tempo.

The composer and music theorist [[Johann Kirnberger]] (1776) refined this idea by instructing the performer to consider the following details in combination when determining the best performance tempo of a piece: the tempo giusto of the meter, the tempo term (''[[Allegro (music)|Allegro]]'', ''[[Adagio (music)|Adagio]]'', etc., if there is one, at the start of the piece), the particular rhythms in the piece (taking account of the longest and shortest notes), the 'character' of the piece, and the piece's genre (whether it was a [[minuet]], [[sarabande]], [[gigue]], etc.). In this way, an experienced musician could rely on his/her (informed) intuition to find the 'right' tempo.&lt;ref&gt;Kirnberger, Johann Philipp. 1771–76. Die Kunst des reinen Satzes in der Musik. 2 vols. Berlin: Christian Friedrich Boß. Reprint vol. 1 Berlin und Königsberg: G. J. Decker und G. L. Hartung, 1774. Trans. David Beach and Jurgen Thym. 1982. The Art of Strict Musical Composition.  New Haven and London: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally, a composer will mark a piece ''tempo giusto'' to request the performer to use his/her experience in this way: that is, to intuit the correct tempo from the structure and nature of the piece itself.&lt;ref&gt;David Fallows. 'Tempo giusto' in Grove Music Online. Oxford University Press. www.oxfordmusiconline.com. Accessed 20 Feb 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the mid-18th century, the notion of each meter having an 'ideal tempo' fell out of fashion, as composers started preferring to indicate tempo with tempo terms and (later, in the nineteenth century) with [[Metronome marking|metronome markings]].

==Life Movement==

Although tempo giusto is only sparsely sprinkled through musical time, it has recently reemerged.  The term has given rise to a whole life movement, which advises the modern world to stop plowing through life at breakneck speed, and to start living instead at the “right tempo." Man is told to live in accordance with his own inner tempo.&lt;ref&gt;Honoré, Carl. ''In Praise of Slowness: Challenging the Cult of Speed.'' San Francisco: HarperSanFrancisco, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The artistic director of the [[Madison Symphony Orchestra]], Maestro [[John DeMain]], has said, “[n]ow that I think about it, the idea of tempo giusto describes just about everything I do or aspire to."&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Jess. "John DeMain: In Search of Tempo Giusto." ''Madison Magazine, August 2001.'' http://www.madisonmusicreviews.org/doc/p_200108_demain.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5146">'''Urophagia''' is the consumption of [[urine]]. Urine was used in several ancient cultures for various health, healing, and [[Cosmetics|cosmetic]] purposes; urine drinking is still practised today, though there is no proven health benefit to it. In extreme cases, people drink urine if no other potable fluid is available, although numerous credible sources (including the [[US Army Field Manual]]) advise against it. Also, some people consume urine as a [[Urolagnia|sexual activity]].

== Reasons for urophagia ==

=== As an emergency survival technique ===
Survival guides such as the ''[[US Army Field Manual]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.equipped.com/21-76/ch6.pdf |title=Water Procurement |work=[[US Army Field Manual]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The SAS Survival Handbook]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The SAS Survival Handbook |first=John "Lofty" |last=Wiseman |page=42 |quote=Warning: Urine and sea-water. Never drink either – Never!}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.equipped.com/primer.htm|title=Equipped to Survive – A Survival Primer|publisher=|accessdate=May 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=September 2018}} generally advise ''against'' drinking urine for survival. These guides state that drinking urine tends to worsen rather than relieve dehydration due to the salts in it, and that urine should not be consumed in a survival situation, even when there is no other fluid available.

While some people in dire straits have drunk urine, it is unclear whether this actually helped or hindered their situation. 

In one relatively recent incident, [[Aron Ralston]] drank urine when trapped for several days with his arm wedged under a boulder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://outsideonline.com/outside/features/200409/aron_ralston_9.html|title=Aron Ralston – Between a Rock and the Hardest Place|author=Mark Jenkins|work=Outside Online|accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The survivalist television host [[Bear Grylls]] drank urine and encouraged others to do so on several episodes on his TV shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/hay-festival/10867228/Bear-Grylls-Kids-please-dont-drink-your-own-urine.html |title=Bear Grylls: Kids, please don't drink your own urine |date=May 31, 2014 |first=Anita |last=Singh, |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/obama-refused-to-drink-his-own-urine-on-bear-grylls-a6777991.html |title=Obama refused to drink his own urine... |first=Clarisse |last=Loughrey |date=December 18, 2015 |work=[[The Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.express.co.uk/celebrity-news/560690/Bear-Grylls-Mission-Survive-celebrities-vomiting |title=Stars vomit profusely after drinking their own urine..., |first=Felicity |last=Thistlethwaite |date=February 26, 2015 |work=[[Daily Express]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Folk medicine===
{{Further|Urine therapy}}
In various cultures, there are [[alternative medicine]] applications of human [[urine]] for medicinal or cosmetic purposes, including [[urine therapy|drinking of one's own urine]]; but no evidence to support its use.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gizmodo.com/why-you-definitely-shouldnt-drink-your-own-pee-1648474064 Why You Definitely Shouldn't Drink Your Own Pee], Gizmodo, 22 Oct 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Indep&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/urine-the-bodys-own-health-drink-5335496.html |title=Urine: The body's own health drink? |newspaper=The Independent |date=21 February 2006 |author=Maxine Frith |accessdate=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual practice===
{{Further|Urolagnia}}
Some persons are sexually aroused by [[urolagnia]], which can include the drinking of their own or other people's urine.

===Biochemical constituents===
Some of these are extracted and then purified from urine according to sources.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33376">'''Wildlife observation''' is the practice of noting the occurrence or abundance of a dead or living animal [[species]] at a specific location and time.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, D. E. and R. L. Winstead, 1980. Estimating the numbers of wildlife populations. Pp. 221-247. In S.D. Schemnitz (editor). Wildlife Management and Techniques Manual. The Wildlife Society,Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; The process of scientific wildlife observation includes the reporting of what ([[diagnosis]] of the species), where ([[geographical location]]), when (date and time), who (details about observer), and why (reason for observation, or explanations for occurrence). Wildlife observation can be performed if the animals are alive, with the most notable example being face-to-face observation and live cameras, or are dead, with the primary example being the notifying of where roadkill has occurred. This outlines the basic information needed to collect data for a wildlife observation; which can also contribute to scientific investigations of distribution, habitat relations, trends, and movement of wildlife species. One example of this type of activity is [[birdwatching|bird watching.]] Wildlife observation allows for the study of organisms with minimal disturbance to their ecosystem depending on the type of method or equipment used. The use of equipment such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), more commonly known as drones, may disturb and cause negative impacts on wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hodgson|first=Jarrod C.|last2=Koh|first2=Lian Pin|date=2016-05-23|title=Best practice for minimising unmanned aerial vehicle disturbance to wildlife in biological field research|journal=Current Biology|volume=26|issue=10|pages=R404–405|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2016.04.001|issn=1879-0445|pmid=27218843}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specialized equipment can be used to collect more accurate data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fws.gov/policy/605fw4.html|title=605 FW 4, Wildlife Observation, Fish and Wildlife Service Manual, U.S.  Fish and Wildlife Service|website=www.fws.gov|access-date=2016-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance==
Through wildlife observation, there are many important details that can be discovered about the environment. For instance, if a fisher in Taiwan discovers that a certain species of fish he/she frequently catches is becoming rarer and rarer, there might be a substantial issue in the water that fisher is fishing in. It could be that there is a new predator in the water that has changed the [http://nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/food-chain/ animal food chain], a source of pollution, or perhaps even a larger problem. Regardless of the reason, this process of observing animals can help identify potential issues before they become severe problems in the world.

Additionally, through animal observation, those who participate are also actively participating in the conservation of animal life. Oftentimes, the two subjects go hand-in-hand with one another because through the observation of animals, individuals are also discovering what issues animals around the world are currently facing and if there are any ways to put up a fight against them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://globalwildlife.org|title=Global Wildlife Conservation|website=globalwildlife.org|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; With more observation, fewer species of animals will become extinct.

==Research==
Before one can get started observing wildlife and helping the environment, it is important to research the animal they are choosing to observe. If one simply went into the observation process and skipped the crucial process of obtaining knowledge about the animals, it would be difficult for them to determine if anything was out of the ordinary.&lt;ref name="How to Watch Wildlife"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wikihow.com/Watch-Wildlife|title=How to Watch Wildlife|newspaper=wikiHow|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before observing, it would be wise to find out simple information about the animal such as:
* What the animal eats - Is the animal a carnivore, herbivore, or omnivore?

==Projects and programs devoted to wildlife observation==

===Projects===
There are a variety of projects and websites devoted to wildlife observations. One of the most common projects are for bird observations (for example: [http://ebird.org e-bird]). For those who enjoy bird watching, there are a variety of ways one can contribute to this type of wildlife observation. The National Wildlife Refuge System has volunteer opportunities, citizen science projects, and if one is limiting in time; could purchase a Federal Duck Stamp that donates money to the wildlife refuge lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fws.gov/refuges/birding/getinvolved.html|title=Get Involved {{!}} National Wildlife Refuge System|last=System|first=National Wildlife Refuge|website=www.fws.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past few years, websites dedicated to reporting wildlife across broad taxonomic ranges have become available. For example, the [http://www.wildlifecrossing.net/california California Roadkill Observation System] provides a mechanism for citizen-scientists in California to report wildlife species killed by vehicles. The [http://www.wildlifecrossing.net/maine Maine Audubon Wildlife Road Watch] allows reporting of observations of both dead and live animals along roads. A more recent addition to wildlife observation tools are the web sites that facilitate uploading and management of images from remote wildlife cameras. For example, the [[Smithsonian Institution]] supports the [http://eMammal.wordpress.com eMammal] and [http://siwild.si.edu Smithsonian Wild] programs, which provide a mechanism for volunteer deployment of wildlife cameras around the world.  Similarly, the [http://wildlifeobserver.net Wildlife Observer Network] hosts over a dozen wildlife-camera projects from around the world, providing tools and a database to manage photographs and camera networks.

===Monitoring programs===
Monitoring programs for wildlife utilize new and easier ways to monitor animal species for citizen scientists and research scientists alike. One such monitoring device is the automated recorder. Automated recorders are a reliable way to monitor species such as bird, bats, and amphibians as they provide ability to save and independently identify a specific animal call.&lt;ref name="Furnas"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Furnas|first1=Brett J.|title=Using Automated Recorders and Occupancy Models to Monitor Common Forest Birds Across a Large Geographic Region|journal=Journal of Wildlife Management|date=February 2015|volume= 79|pages=pp.&amp;nbsp;325–337.|doi=10.1002/jwmg.821}}&lt;/ref&gt; The automated recorder analyzes the sounds of the species to identify the species and how many there are.&lt;ref name="Furnas" /&gt; It was found that using the automated recorders produced larger quantity and even more quality data when compared with traditional, point-count data recording.&lt;ref name="Acevedo"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Acevedo|first1=Miguel A.and |last2=Villanueva-Rivera|first2=Luis J.|title=Using Automated Digital Recording Systems as Effective Tools for the Monitoring of Birds and Amphibians|journal=Wildlife Society Bulletin|date=2006|volume= 34 | issue = 1 |pages=pp.&amp;nbsp;211–214. |doi=10.2193/0091-7648(2006)34[211:uadrsa]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; While providing better quality, it also provides a permanent record of the census which can be continually reviewed for any potential bias.&lt;ref name="Acevedo" /&gt; This monitoring device can improve wildlife observation and potentially save more animals. Using this device can allow for continued tracking of populations, continued censusing of individuals within a species, and allow for faster population size estimates.&lt;ref name="Furnas" /&gt;

==Live watching and observation==

===Birdwatching===
One of the most popular forms of wildlife observation, [[birdwatching]], is typically performed as a recreational pleasure. Those looking to birdwatch typically travel into a forest or other wooded area with a pair of binoculars in hand to aid the process. Birdwatching has become all the more important with the amount of deforestation that has been occurring in the world. Birds are arguably the most important factor in the balance of environmental [[system]]s: "They pollinate plants, disperse seeds, scavenge carcasses and recycle nutrients back into the earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.audubon.org/magazine/march-april-2013/why-do-birds-matter|title=Why Do Birds Matter?|date=2013-03-06|newspaper=Audubon|access-date=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A decrease in the total number of birds would cause destruction to much of the environmental system. The plants and trees around the world would die at an alarming rate which would, in turn, set off a chain reaction that would cause many other animals to die due to the environment change and [[Habitat destruction|habitat loss]]. 
[[File:Birdwatching on beach.jpg|thumb|244x244px|Birdwatchers on a beach]]

One of the ways that birdwatching has an effect on the environment as a whole is that through consistent birdwatching, an observer would be able to identify whether they are seeing less of a certain species of bird. If this happens, there typically is a reasons for the occurrence, whether it be because of an increase in pollution in the area or possibly an increase in the population of predators.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://birding.about.com/od/birdconservation/a/importconserve.htm|title=bird wildlife conservation protect protection conserve environment|newspaper=About.com Home|access-date=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a watcher were to take notice of a change in what they typically see, they could notify the city or park and allow them to investigate into the cause a bit further. Through this action, birdwatchers are preserving the future for both animal and human life.

Subsequently, by taking children birdwatching it is allowing the future generation to understand the importance of animal observation. If children learn at a young age how the environmental system works and that all life is intertwined, the world will be in much better hands.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These children will be the ones pioneer conservation movements and attempt to protect the habit for all animals.

===Livestreams===
Live streams of animal exhibits at various zoos and aquariums across the United States have also become extremely popular. The [[Tennessee Aquarium]] has a webcam that allows online viewers to take a look into the happening so their Secret Reef exhibit which consists of reef fish, sharks, and a rescued green sea turtle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tnaqua.org/animals-exhibits/secret-reef-cam/|title=Secret Reef Cam {{!}} Tennessee Aquarium|last=Aquarium|first=Tennessee|website=www.tnaqua.org|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most popular animals cams in the United States though come from, naturally, the largest zoo in the United States: [[San Diego Zoo|The San Diego Zoo]]. The San Diego Zoo features eight live cams on their website – A panda, elephant, ape, penguin, polar bear, tiger, condor, and koala. The purpose of the live streams is to help educate the public about the behaviors of several different animals and to entertain those who might not be able to travel to a zoo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://zoo.sandiegozoo.org/content/video-more|title=Video &amp; More|date=2013-12-03|newspaper=San Diego Zoo|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other notable zoos that have webcams are the [[National Zoological Park (United States)|National Zoo]], [[Woodland Park Zoo]], [[Houston Zoo]], and [[Zoo Atlanta|Atlanta Zoo]].

Additionally, the [[National Museum of Natural History|Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History]] has opened a butterfly and plant observation pavilion. Visitors walk into a large tent and experience a one-of-a-kind situation in which hundreds of rare butterflies from all across the world are inches from their faces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://naturalhistory.si.edu/butterflies/|title=Butterflies + Plants: Partners in Evolution, Home Page|website=naturalhistory.si.edu|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collecting data===
As is the case with a majority of subjects, one of the best and most effective ways to observe live animals is through data collection. This process can be done through a livestream or in the wild but it is more useful if the data is collected on animals that are in currently in the wild.&lt;ref name="study.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://study.com/academy/lesson/how-to-observe-measure-describe-animal-behavior.html|title=How to Observe, Measure &amp; Describe Animal Behavior {{!}} Study.com|newspaper=Study.com|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ways the data can be collected are endless and it really just depends on what purpose an individual has as to what data would be the most useful.

For example, if someone is interested in how deer interact with other animals in a certain location, it would be beneficial for them to take notes and record all of the animals that are native to the area where the deer are located. From there, they can describe any scenarios in which the deer had a positive or negative interaction with the other species of animals. In this instance, it would not really be helpful for the observer to collect data pertaining to the types of food the deer eat because the study is only focusing on the interaction amongst animals.

Another example of how collecting data on wildlife would be useful is keeping track of the total number of a certain species exists within a forest. Naturally, it will be impossible to get a definitive number but if an accurate approximation can be made, it could be beneficial in determining if there has been a random increase or decrease in the population. If there is an increase, it could be due to a change in the species migration habits and if there is a decrease, it could be due to an external factor such as pollution or introduction of a new predator.&lt;ref name="study.com"/&gt;

==Deceased wildlife observation==
[[File:Wildlife crossing.jpg|thumb|244x244px|An example of a wildlife crossing sign]]

===Online systems and mobile apps===
Many states have already begun to set up websites and systems for the public. The main purpose behind the movement is so that they can notify other individuals about [[Roadkill|road-killed]] wildlife. If enough people fill out the forms located on the websites, the government will become notified that there have been occurrences of a loss of animal life and will take the steps required to prevent it. Typically, the step that is taken is the posting of a wildlife crossing sign that, in turn, allows the public to know where there are common animal crossings. Maine and California are the states that have been the pioneers of this movement and this process has become particularly important on heavily traveled roads as no one would like endanger the animals or themselves.&lt;ref name="wildlifecrossing.net|title=wildlifecrossing.net"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wildlifecrossing.net|title=wildlifecrossing.net {{!}} wildlife observation reporting|website=www.wildlifecrossing.net|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, there is an app (available on both iPhone and Android devices) made specifically for the purpose of identifying road-kill called [https://www.herpmapper.org/mobile/mapper “Mobile Mapper.”] The app is a partner of the HerpMapper website. The purpose of the website is to use the user recorded observations for research and conservation purposes.&lt;ref name="wildlifecrossing.net|title=wildlifecrossing.net"/&gt;

On average, the cost of repairing a car that has been damaged by a deer or other medium to large-sized animal is $2,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hcn.org/issues/291/15268|title=Roadkill statistics|access-date=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though there is no way that accidents involving animals can completely be prevented, placing more signs about possible animal crossings zones would cause drivers to drive more carefully and therefore have fewer accidents. Economically, this means that more families will be saving money and it could be used in a different way to help contributed to society as a whole.

==Issues leading to the extinction of animals==

===Climate change===
[[Climate change]] is one of the most heavily discussed topics around the world today, both politically and scientifically. The climate that Earth is currently experiencing has been steadily changing over time due to both natural causes and human exploitation.&lt;ref name="Media"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.climateandweather.net/global-warming/climate-change-and-animals.html|title=Climate change - effects on animals|last=Media|first=Ali Penman {{!}} Web Smart|website=www.climateandweather.net|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate change has the potential to be detrimental to wildlife across the world, whether that be through rising sea levels, changes in temperatures through the years, or [[deforestation]].&lt;ref name="Media"/&gt; These are just a few of the examples of the contributing factors to climate change.

Climate change is not something that citizens can entirely prevent from happening even if they wanted to. There are many natural causes such as [[Volcano|volcanic activity]] and the Earth's orbit around the sun that are strong contributing factors to the phenomena.&lt;ref name="Canada"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.climatechange.gc.ca/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=65CD73F4-1|title=climatechange.gc.ca - Facts on Climate Change - Causes of Climate Change|last=Canada|first=Government of Canada, Environment and Climate Change|website=www.climatechange.gc.ca|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however, prevention measures that can be taken to prevent climate change from happening as quickly. The primary way to prevent climate change is for society to reduce the amount of [[greenhouse gas]]es that are present in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Canada"/&gt; This can be done through the improving of energy efficiency in many buildings, the stoppage of deforestation so more carbon dioxide can be removed from the atmosphere, and mode switching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cehtp.org/faq/climate_change/preventing_and_preparing_for_climate_change|title=Climate Change|website=cehtp.org|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rising sea levels====
One of the more notable effects climate change has on the environment is the rising of sea levels around the world. Over the past 100 years, the sea level has risen approximately 1.8 millimeters each year.&lt;ref name="actforlibraries.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.actforlibraries.org/the-impact-of-rising-sea-levels-on-animal-life/|title=The Impact of Rising Sea Levels on Animal Life {{!}} Actforlibraries.org|website=www.actforlibraries.org|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The steady rise in sea levels can be attributed to the steadily increasing temperatures the Earth faces each year which causes the ice caps and glaciers to melt.&lt;ref name="actforlibraries.org"/&gt; This increase in sea level is detrimental to the [[Coast|coastal ecosystems]] that exist around the world.
[[File:Polar bear after unlucky hunt for a seal.jpg|thumb|Polar bear hunting for food]]
The increase in sea level causes flooding on coastal wetlands, where certain animals will be unable to survive due to [http://eden.cce.cornell.edu/disasters/Documents/PDFs/saltwater%20innundation%20fact%20sheet.pdf saltwater inundation].&lt;ref name="actforlibraries.org"/&gt; The increase in the total amount of saltwater present in these wetlands could prove to be problematic for many species. While some may simply have to migrate to other areas, smaller ecosystems within the wetlands could be destroyed which, once again, influences the animal food chain.&lt;ref name="actforlibraries.org"/&gt;

[[Polar bear]]s are animals that are specifically affected through the process of rising sea levels. Living near the Arctic region, polar bears find their food on ice caps and sheets of ice. As these sheets continue to become fewer in quantity, it is predicted that the polar bears will have a difficult time sustaining life and that by the year 2050, there could be less than 20,000 on Earth.&lt;ref name="actforlibraries.org"/&gt;

[[Coral reef]]s are the primary ecosystem that would be affected through a continuing increase in the sea level:&lt;blockquote&gt;"The coral reef ecosystem is adapted to thrive within certain temperature and sea level range. Corals live in a symbiotic relationship with photosynthetic [[zooxanthellae]]. Zooxanthellae need the sunlight in order to produce the nutrients necessary for the coral. Sea level rise may cause a decrease in solar radiation at the sea surface level, affecting the ability of photosynthetic zooxanthellae to produce nutrients for the coral, whereas, a sudden exposure of the coral reef to the atmosphere due to a low tide event may induce coral bleaching."&lt;ref name="actforlibraries.org"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Coral reefs with fishes.JPG|thumb|Coral reef with fish]]
The loss of coral would have a subsequent effect on the total number of fish that exist within these ecosystems. In the Indo-Pacific coral reefs alone, there are in-between 4000 and 5000 different species of fish that have a relationship with the species of coral.&lt;ref name="eatlas.org.au"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eatlas.org.au/content/relationship-between-corals-and-fishes-great-barrier-reef|title=Relationship between corals and fishes on the Great Barrier Reef {{!}} eAtlas|website=eatlas.org.au|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the numerous different species of [[Butterflyfish|butterfly fish]] that feed on coral within these reefs would be affected if the coral was unable to live due to an increase in sea level.&lt;ref name="eatlas.org.au"/&gt; Referring back to the food chain topic, this would then subsequently but directly affect species of snappers, eels, and sharks that use butterfly fish as a primary source of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://a-z-animals.com/animals/butterfly-fish/|title=Butterfly Fish (Chaetodontidae) - Animals - A-Z Animals - Animal Facts, Information, Pictures, Videos, Resources and Links|last=A-Z-Animals.com|website=a-z-animals.com|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the snappers cannot find any butterfly fish to eat because the butterfly fish are dying due to the lack of coral, it means that the snapper population will decrease as well.

The rising of sea level has the possibility to be catastrophic to the coastal ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/climate-impacts/climate-impacts-coastal-areas|title=Climate Impacts on Coastal Areas|last=EPA,OA|first=US|website=www.epa.gov|language=en|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pollution===
[[Pollution]] is another crucial threat to animal life, and human life, across the world. Every form of pollution has an effect on wildlife, whether it be through the air, water, or ground. While sometimes the origin and form of pollution is visible and easy to determine, other times it can be a mystery as to what exactly is causing the death of animals. Through constant and consistent observation of habitat analysis, humans can help prevent the loss of animal life by recognizing the early signs of pollution before the problem becomes too large.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldwildlife.org/threats/pollution|title=Pollution {{!}} Threats {{!}} WWF|website=World Wildlife Fund|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ocean and water pollution====
[[File:Deepwater Horizon oil spill fishing closure map 2010-06-02.png|thumb|Map of the area where fishing was affected because of the BP oil spill]]
Pollution can enter bodies of water in many different ways - Through toxic runoff from pesticides and fertilizers, containers of oil and other hazardous materials falling off of ships, or just from debris  from humans that has not been picked up.&lt;ref name="Pollution {{!}} Threats {{!}} WWF"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldwildlife.org/threats/pollution|title=Pollution {{!}} Threats {{!}} WWF|website=World Wildlife Fund|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; No matter what the form of pollution is, the effects water pollution has on animal life can be drastic. For example, the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill|BP oil spill]] which occurred in 2010 impacted over 82,000 birds, 6,000 sea turtles, approximately 26,000 marine animals, and hundreds of thousands of fish.&lt;ref name="A Deadly Toll"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/programs/public_lands/energy/dirty_energy_development/oil_and_gas/gulf_oil_spill/a_deadly_toll.html|title=A Deadly Toll|website=www.biologicaldiversity.org|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the observation of how animal life was and has been affected by this spill is unique and definitely on the larger scale, it still represents an accurate depiction of how observation can be crucial to animal lives. For example, by observing that a certain species of sea turtle was affected by the oil spill, zoologists and their teams would be able to determine the effects the loss of that sea turtle would have.&lt;ref name="A Deadly Toll"/&gt;

Another prominent example is how if one day a fisherman goes to a lake that he/she frequently visits and notices two or three dead fish on the surface. Knowing that that frequently does not happen, the fisherman tells his local city officials and park rangers about the occurrence and they find out that a farmer has been using a new pesticide that runs off into the lake. By simply observing what is common and what is not, the effects of some water pollution can be stopped before becoming too severe.

====Air pollution====
[[File:Pollution de l'air.jpg|thumb|Smoke coming from a factory]]
Air pollution is commonly associated with the image of billowing clouds of smoke rising into the sky from a large factory. While the fumes and smoke previously stated definitely is a prominent form of air pollution, it is not the only one. Air pollution can come from the emission of cars, smoking, and other sources.&lt;ref name="Pollution {{!}} Threats {{!}} WWF"/&gt; Air pollution does not just affect birds though, like one may have thought. Air pollution affects mammals, birds, reptiles, and any other organism that requires oxygen to live.&lt;ref name="Pollution {{!}} Threats {{!}} WWF"/&gt; Frequently, if there is any highly dangerous air pollution, the animal observation process will be rather simple: There will be an abundance of dead animals located near the vicinity of the pollution.

The primary concern of air pollution is how widespread the pollution can become in a short period of time. [[Acid rain]] is one of the largest forms of pollution today. The issue with acid rain is that it affects literally every living organism it comes in contact with, whether that be trees in a forest, water in an ocean or lake, or the skin of humans and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.climateandweather.net/world-weather/acid-rain.html|title=Acid Rain|last=Media|first=Ali Penman {{!}} Web Smart|website=www.climateandweather.net|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, acid rain is a combination of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides that are emitted from factories.&lt;ref name="Pollution {{!}} Threats {{!}} WWF"/&gt; If it is not controlled in a timely manner, it could lead to loss of life due to the dangerous nature of the composition of the rain.

===Deforestation===
Deforestation has become one of the most prevalent issues environmentally. With an continuously growing population and not having the space to contain all the humans on Earth, forests are frequently the first areas that are cleared to make more room.&lt;ref name="Society"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://environment.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/deforestation-overview/|title=Deforestation Facts, Deforestation Information, Effects of Deforestation - National Geographic|last=Society|first=National Geographic|newspaper=National Geographic|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to National Geographic, forests still cover approximately 30 percent of the land on Earth but each year large portions are cleared.&lt;ref name="Society"/&gt;

With deforestation, there are numerous subsequent side effects. Most notably, the clearing of entire forests (in some instances) destroys the habitat for hundreds of species of animals and 70 percent of the animals that reside in the forest will die as a result.&lt;ref name="Society"/&gt; Additionally, deforestation causes a reduction in the total [[Canopy (biology)|canopy cover]] which leads to more extreme temperature swings on the ground level because there are no branches and leaves to catch the sun's rays.&lt;ref name="Society"/&gt;

The way to combat the severe effects on the loss of animal life would be to stop cutting trees and forests down. While this is unlikely and almost impossible to happen, there is another solution: the partial removal of forests. By only removing portions of the forest, it keeps the environment of the entire forest in tact which allows the animals to adapt to their surroundings.&lt;ref name="Society"/&gt; Additionally, it is recommended that for every tree that is cut down that another one be planted elsewhere in the forest.&lt;ref name="Society"/&gt;

==Economic effects of animal observation==

===Costs of observation===
Typically, the costs of animal observation are minuscule. As previously stated, animal observation can be done on a small or large scale; it just depends what goal an individual has in mind. For example, animal observation can be performed in the backyard of a house or at a local state park at no charge. All one would have to do is take a notepad, phone, or other device to write down their data and observations. On a larger scale, animal observation could be performed at an animal reserve, where the associated costs would be those associated with keeping the animals happy inside the reserve.

While it is impossible to pinpoint exactly how much the zoos across the world spend on live streaming, it is estimated to be in the $1,000 range for every camera that is set up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://livestream.com/platform/pricing|title=Livestream {{!}} Plans &amp; Pricing|website=Livestream|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Costs that observation prevents===
Referring back to the example from the "Deceased Wildlife Observation" section, it becomes apparent how animal observation can save families and the government money. With the average cost of repairing a car that has damage from a large sized animal being $2,000, families and the government could save money by making the public aware that they should proceed with caution in areas where animals have been hit.&lt;ref name="Roadkill statistics"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hcn.org/issues/291/15268|title=Roadkill statistics|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pollution in Maracaibo lake.jpg|thumb|298x298px|Water pollution at Maracaibo lake]]
Additionally, approximately $44 million of the $4.3 billion spent on water purity is spent each year on protecting aquatic species from nutrient pollution.&lt;ref name="Roadkill statistics"/&gt; It is encouraging that the government is willing to spend the money to help save animals' lives, sometimes the effects of the pollution take effect before they are able to stop them entirely.  One million seabirds and hundred thousand aquatic mammals and fish that are killed as a result of water pollution each year and that has its economic effects, both directly and indirectly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dosomething.org/us/facts/11-facts-about-pollution|title=11 Facts About Pollution {{!}} DoSomething.org {{!}} Volunteer for Social Change|website=www.dosomething.org|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Directly, the loss of aquatic mammals and fish has a direct impact on the sales of food. The EPA estimated recently that the effects of pollution cost the fishing industry tens of millions of dollars in sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/effects-economy|title=The Effects: Economy|last=EPA,OW,OWOW|first=US|website=www.epa.gov|language=en|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indirectly, the loss of birds causes humans to spend more money on pest control because the food chain is out of order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.whatdobirdseat.info|title=What do Birds Eat?|website=www.whatdobirdseat.info|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The small rodents and insects that some birds prey upon are no longer being killed if the birds die. This means more of these pests find their ways into homes which causes more people to call exterminators, therefore setting off a chain reaction. The exterminators then must use insecticides to kill the animals which can have harmful runoff into the ground and local water systems, instead of allowing it to be done naturally by the animal food chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.toxicsaction.org/problems-and-solutions/pesticides|title=The Problem with Pesticides {{!}} Toxics Action Center|website=www.toxicsaction.org|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
