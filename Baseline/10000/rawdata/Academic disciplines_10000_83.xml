      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9383">'''Agroecological restoration''' is the practice of re-integrating natural systems into agriculture in order to maximize [[sustainability]], [[ecosystem services]], and [[biodiversity]]. This is one example of a way to apply the principles of [[agroecology]] to an agricultural system.

== Overview ==
Farms cannot be restored to a purely natural state because of the negative economic impact on farmers, but returning processes, such as [[pest control]] to nature with the method of [[intercropping]], allows a farm to be more ecologically sustainable and, at the same time, economically viable. Agroecological restoration works toward this balance of sustainability and economic viability because conventional farming is not sustainable over the long run without the integration of natural systems and because the use of land for agriculture has been a driving force in creating the present world biodiversity crisis. Its efforts are complementary to, rather than a substitute for, [[biological conservation]].&lt;ref&gt;1.^ Jackson et al., The Farm as Natural Habitat, Introduction&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"...biodiversity is just as important on farms and in fields as it is in deep river valleys or mountain cloud forests."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;[http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/focus/2004/51102/index.html  FAO, 15 October 2004]

Agriculture creates a conflict over the [[land use|use of land]] between wildlife and humans. Though the [[domestication]] of [[crop plants]] occurred 10,000 years ago, a 500% increase in the amount of pasture and crop land over the last three hundred years has led to the rapid loss of natural habitats.&lt;ref&gt;^ Macdonald, Key Topics in Conservation Biology, Chapter 16&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, the world community acknowledged the value of biodiversity in treaties, such as the 1992 landmark Convention on Biological Diversity.&lt;ref&gt;3.^ {{cite web | title=The future of agriculture depends on biodiversity | website=fao.org | url=http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/focus/2004/51102/index.html | access-date=July 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reintegration ==
The reintegration of agricultural systems into more natural systems will result in decreased yield and produce a more complex system, but there will be considerable gains in biodiversity and ecosystem services.

===Biodiversity===
The [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] estimates that more than 40% of earth’s land surface is currently used for agriculture. And because so much land has been converted to agriculture, habitat loss is recognized as the driving force in [[biodiversity loss]] (FAO). This biodiversity loss often occurred in two steps, as in the [[American Midwest]], with the introduction of [[mixed farming]] carried out on small farms and then with the widespread use of [[mechanized farming]] and [[monoculture]] beginning after World War II.&lt;ref&gt;4. Jackson et al., The Farm as Natural Habitat, Ch. 10&lt;/ref&gt;  The decline in farmland biodiversity can now be traced to changes in farming practices and increased agricultural intensity.&lt;ref&gt;5.^ Benton et al., 182&lt;/ref&gt;

===Increasing heterogeneity===
[[Heterogeneity]] (here, the diversity or complexity of the landscape) has been shown to be associated with species diversity. For example, the abundance of butterflies has been found to increase with heterogeneity.  One important part of maintaining heterogeneity in the spaces between different fields is made up of habitat that is not cropped, such as grass margins and strips, scrub along field boundaries, woodland, ponds, and fallow land. These seemingly unimportant pieces of land are crucial for the biodiversity of a farm. The presence of field margins benefits many different taxa: the plants attract herbivorous insects, will which attract certain species of birds and those birds will attract their natural predators. Also, the cover provided by the no cropped habitat allows the species that need a large range to move across the landscape.&lt;ref&gt;6.^ Benton et al., 183&amp;ndash;184&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monoculture===
In the absence of cover, species face a landscape in which their [[habitat fragmentation|habitat is greatly fragmented]]. The isolation of a species to a small habitat that it can’t safely wander from can create a [[genetic bottleneck]], decreasing the resilience of the particular population, and be another factor leading to the decline of the total population of the species.&lt;ref&gt;7.^ Macdonald et al., Key Topics in Conservation Biology, Ch 4&lt;/ref&gt; Monoculture, the practice of producing a single crop over a wide area, causes fragmentation. In conventional farming, monoculture, such as with rotations of corn and soybean crops planted in alternating growing seasons, is used so that very high yields can be produced. After the mechanization of farming, monoculture became a standard practice in corn-beans rotation, and had broad implications for the long-term sustainability and biodiversity of farms. Whereas organic fertilizers, had kept the soil’s nutrients fixed to the ecosystem, the introduction of monoculture removed the nutrients and farmers compensated for that loss by using inorganic fertilizers. It is estimated that humans have doubled the rate of nitrogen input into the nitrogen cycle, mostly since 1975. As a result, the biological processes that controlled the way crops used the nutrients changed and the leached nitrogen from farmland soils has become a source of pollution.&lt;ref&gt;8. Jackson et al., The Farm as Natural Habitat, Ch. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organic farming===
[[Organic farming]] is defined in different legal terms by different nations, but its main distinction from conventional farming is that it prohibits the use of synthetic chemicals in crop and livestock production. Often, it also includes diverse [[crop rotation]]s and provides non-cropped habitat for insects that provide ecosystem services, such as pest control and [[pollination]].&lt;ref&gt;9.^ Zhang et al., 255&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is merely encouraged that organic farmers follow those kinds of wildlife friendly practices, and as a result there is a great difference between the ecosystem services that similarly sized but distinctly managed organic farms provide.&lt;ref&gt;10.^ Hole D.G. et al., 114&lt;/ref&gt; A recent review of the 76 studies concerning the relationship between biodiversity and organic farming listed three practices associated with organic farming that accounted for the higher biodiversity counts found in organic farms as compared to conventional farms. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"1. ''Prohibition/reduced use of [[chemical pesticides]] and inorganic fertilizers'' is likely to have a positive impact through the removal of both direct and indirect negative effects on arable plants, invertebrates and vertebrates.&lt;br /&gt;
2. ''Sympathetic management of non-crop habitats and [[field margin]]s'' can enhance diversity and abundance of arable plants, invertebrates, birds and mammals.&lt;br /&gt;
3. ''Preservation of mixed farming'' is likely to positively impact farmland biodiversity through the provision of greater habitat heterogeneity at a variety of temporal and spatial scales within the landscape.&lt;ref&gt;11.^ Hole D.G. et al., 120&lt;/ref&gt;"

'''The Alpheios Project''' is an open source initiative originally focused on developing software to facilitate reading [[Latin]] and [[ancient Greek]]. Dictionaries, grammars and inflection tables were combined in a set of web-based tools to provide comprehensive reading support for scholars, students and independent readers. The tools were implemented as browser add-ons so that they could be used on any web site or any page that a user might create in Unicoded HTML.
  
In collaboration with the Perseus Digital Library, the goals of the Alpheios Project were subsequently broadened to combine reading support with language learning. Annotation and editing tools were added to help users contribute to the development of new resources, such as enhanced texts that have been syntactically annotated or aligned with translations.
  
The Alpheios tools are designed modularly to encourage the addition of other languages that have the necessary digital resources, such as morphological analyzers and dictionaries. In addition to Latin and ancient Greek, Alpheios tools have been extended to [[Arabic]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. 
 
The Alpheios Project is a non-profit ([[501c3]]) initiative. The software is open source, and resides on Sourceforge.com. The Alpheios software is released as [[GNU General Public License#|GPL 3.0]] and texts and data as [[Creative Commons license|CC-by-SA]].

== History ==

The Alpheios Project was established in 2007 by Mark Nelson, the founder of the commercial software company [[Ovid Technologies]], which he started after writing a search engine for medical literature that became widely popular in medical libraries and research facilities (Strauch, 1996). Nelson, who holds an MA in English literature from Columbia University, sold the company to [[Wolters Kluwer]] in 1999 (Quint, 1998). Nelson created Alpheios by recruiting several developers and programmers from his previous company, defining the project's initial goals and funding its first three years of operation. In 2008 he also provided the initial funding for The Perseus Treebank of Ancient Greek, which has subsequently been crowd-sourced.

In 2011, the Perseus Project hired key Alpheios staff and the activities of the projects were extensively integrated, although Alpheios remains an independent organization focused on developing adaptive reading and learning tools that can provide formative assessment customized to the individual user's special abilities and goals, including the study of specific authors or texts.

To date, all Alpheios applications, enhanced texts and code have been provided without any fees or licenses. A separate Alpheios LLC provides commercial consultation on customization and extension of the Alpheios tools.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1813">'''Associate Teacher Learning and Skills''' (ATLS) status is a designation awarded to teachers in the [[Further Education]] and Post-Compulsory Education &amp; Training sectors by the Education &amp; Training Foundation (ETF) in the [[United Kingdom]]. ATLS may be earned en route to [[Qualified Teacher Learning and Skills]] (QTLS) status, which is seen as on an equal level to [[Qualified Teacher Status]] (QTS).

ATLS is a professional 'status'.

==Gaining ATLS==

From November 2014, ATLS has been offered by the Education &amp; Training Foundation (ETF) to members of the Society for Education &amp; Training (SET) for a fee of £485. In order to obtain ATLS, the candidate is required to register with SET, undertake Continuing Professional Development (CPD) and complete SET's 'Professional Formation' process.

Prior to November 2014, ATLS was offered by the [[Institute for Learning]] (IfL) which was absorbed into the Education &amp; Training Foundation (ETF) on 31 October 2014.

ATLS can be obtained en route to [[Qualified Teacher Learning and Skills|QTLS]] which is seen as on an equal level to [[Qualified Teacher Status|QTS]].  Should an individual want to work as an Associate Teacher in maintained schools, the same way as any other teacher, then they must have ATLS and be a member of the Society for Education &amp; Training (SET).

The [[Certificate in Education and Training]] qualification and its predecessors (e.g. [[CTLLS]]) qualify a teacher to attain ATLS.

AuT technologies share many common traits, which justify the common notation. They are all based on recent breakthroughs in the domains of (deep) [[machine learning]] and [[artificial intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/ai-artificial-intelligence-deep-machine-learning/|title=Why Deep Learning Is Suddenly Changing Your Life|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/234669-turing-learning-breakthrough-computers-can-now-learn-from-pure-observation|title=Turing Learning breakthrough: Computers can now learn from pure observation – ExtremeTech|date=August 30, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/10/future-of-artificial-intelligence/|title=The Three Breakthroughs That Have Finally Unleashed AI on the World|first=Kevin|last=Kelly|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They all require extensive and prompt regulatory developments to specify the requirements from them and to license and manage their deployment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/detail/vr/autonomous/auto|title=Deployment of Autonomous Vehicles for Public Operation|first=California Department of Motor|last=Vehicles|website=www.dmv.ca.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see the further reading below). And they all require unprecedented levels of safety (e.g., [[automobile safety]]) and security,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/01/worried-about-cybersecurity-and-the-connected-car-theres-a-bill-for-that/|title=Worried about cybersecurity and the connected car?

As an example, the [[autonomous car]] both addresses the main existing safety issues and creates new issues. It is expected to be much safer than existing vehicles, by eliminating the single most dangerous element{{snd}}the driver. The US's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates 94 percent of US accidents were the result of [[human error]] and poor decision-making, including speeding and impaired driving,&lt;ref name="moral dilemma"/&gt; and the Center for Internet and Society at Stanford Law School claims that "Some ninety percent of motor vehicle crashes are caused at least in part by human error".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2013/12/human-error-cause-vehicle-crashes |title=Human error as a cause of vehicle crashes |author=Bryant Walker Smith |date=December 18, 2013 |accessdate=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; So while safety standards like the [[ISO 26262]] specify the required safety, there is still a burden on the industry to demonstrate acceptable safety.

While car accidents claim every year 35,000 lives in the US,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/812348 |title=Quick Facts 2015 |work=[[US DOT]] |accessdate=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1.25&amp;nbsp;million worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/gho/road_safety/mortality/en/|title=Road traffic deaths|website=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; some{{Who|date=August 2017}} believe that even "a car that's 10 times as safe, which means 3,500 people die on the roads each year [in the US alone]" would not be accepted by the public.&lt;ref name="moral dilemma"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2017/02/20/the-big-moral-dilemma-facing-self-driving-cars/ |title=The big moral dilemma facing self-driving cars |author=Steven Overly |quote="[..] Would we accept that?" asks John Hanson, a spokesman for the Toyota Research Institute, which is developing the automaker's self-driving technology. |date=February 20, 2017 |accessdate=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The acceptable level may be closer to the current figures on [[aviation accidents and incidents]], with under a thousand worldwide deaths in most years&lt;ref&gt;"Death Rate per Year". Bureau of Aircraft Accidents Archives (ACRO). Retrieved April 18, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;{{snd}}three orders of magnitude lower than cars. This underscores the unprecedented nature of the safety requirements that will need to be met for cars, with similar levels of safety expected for other Autonomous Things.

== Biography ==
Born on 2 December 1944 in [[Kolkata]], in the Indian state of [[West Bengal]] to Bhabaranjan-Malancha couple, Bhattacharyya graduated in chemistry from the [[University of Calcutta]] and secured his master's degree in physical chemistry from the same university.&lt;ref name="Indian Fellow - Bhattacharya" /&gt; Subsequently, he joined the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science, Kolkata and pursued his doctoral studies to secure the degree under the guidance of Uma Shankar Nandi of the [[Indian Institute of Science]]. Moving to the US, he completed his post-doctoral studies at the laboratory of Jan Wolff of the [[National Institutes of Health]]. He returned to India in 1976 to join [[Bose Institute]] as a [[Council of Scientific and Industrial Research|CSIR]] pool officer where he shifted to academics as a lecturer in 1978 and continued his service till his superannuation as a professor and head of the department of biochemistry.&lt;ref name="Fellow profile - Indian Academy of Sciences"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ias.ac.in/describe/fellow/Bhattacharyya,_Prof._Bhabatarak | title=Fellow profile - Indian Academy of Sciences | publisher=Indian Academy of Sciences | date=2016 | accessdate=September 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also been associated with [[Presidency College, Calcutta]] as a professor at their Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry.&lt;ref name="Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.presiuniv.ac.in/web/chemistry.php | title=Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry | publisher=Presidency University | date=2016 | accessdate=October 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bhattacharyya's early work during his post-doctoral studies at Jan Wolff's laboratory were on [[tubulin]] and its binding mechanism with [[antimitotic]] drugs.&lt;ref name="Indian Fellow - Bhattacharya" /&gt; Later, he focused his researches on colchicine-tubulin interaction and elucidated the effect of the ''carbonyl group on the side chain of B-ring'' in the irreversible binding of [[colchicine]].&lt;ref name="Handbook of Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize Winners"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.csirhrdg.res.in/ssb.pdf | title=Handbook of Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize Winners | publisher=Council of Scientific and Industrial Research | date=1999 | accessdate=September 28, 2016 | pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He demonstrated the fluorescence of colchicine-tubilin bind which is reported to have offered an alternative to radio-labeled colchicine in pharmacological [[assays]] and made the study of the kinetics of colchicine binding easier. He studied the ''mechanism of chaperone-like activity of tubulin and microtubule associated proteins'' and his studies have known to be of significance in the design of lead compounds as well as new drugs for the treatment of cancer.&lt;ref name="Faculty Bhabatarak Bhattacharyya"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://bic.boseinst.ernet.in/biochem/bablu.html | title=Faculty Bhabatarak Bhattacharyya | publisher=Bose Institute | date=2016 | accessdate=October 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has published several articles detailing his research findings,&lt;ref name="Bhabatarak Bhattacharyya on Microsoft Academic Search"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://65.54.113.26/Author/11083556/bhabatarak-bhattacharyya | title=Bhabatarak Bhattacharyya on Microsoft Academic Search | publisher=Microsoft Academic Search | date=2016 | accessdate=October 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; has registered patents for his work&lt;ref name="Patents by Inventor Abhik Saha"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://patents.justia.com/inventor/abhik-saha | title=Patents by Inventor Abhik Saha | publisher=Justia Patents | date=2016 | accessdate=October 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has mentored many scholars in their doctoral studies.&lt;ref name="Dr. Gopa Mitra"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sjri.res.in/mmkeyperson/560 | title=Dr. Gopa Mitra | publisher=St. John's Research Institute | date=2016 | accessdate=October 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="About Fellow"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wellcomedbt.org/fellowsprofile/dr-abhik-saha-222 | title=About Fellow | publisher=Wellcome Trust | date=2016 | accessdate=October 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His scientific career has been documented in an article, ''Dr. Bablu Bhattacharyya: A Journey of Four Decades with Tubulin'', published in 2015.&lt;ref name="Dr. Bablu Bhattacharyya: A Journey of Four Decades with Tubulin"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.jpp.org.in/index.php/jpp/article/view/133 | title=Dr. Bablu Bhattacharyya: A Journey of Four Decades with Tubulin | author=Dulal Panda, Tapas K Manna | journal=Journal of Proteins and Proteomics | year=2015 | volume=6 | issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also been associated with the [[Council of Scientific and Industrial Research]], [[Department of Science and Technology (India)|Department of Science and Technology]],&lt;ref name="Isothermal Titration Calorimetry"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.caluniv.ac.in/seminar/Workshop_Proteomics.pdf | title=Isothermal Titration Calorimetry | publisher=Calcutta University | date=2016 | accessdate=October 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indian National Science Academy]] and the [[Indian Academy of Sciences]] as a member of their various technical committees.&lt;ref name="Indian Fellow - Bhattacharya" /&gt;

==History==
The phenomenon was first documented by Swedish perceptual psychologist, [[Gunnar Johansson (psychophysicist)|Gunnar Johansson]], in 1973.&lt;ref name=Johansson1973&gt;{{cite journal |title=Visual perception of biological motion and a model for its analysis|author=Johansson|journal=Perception &amp; Psychophysics|year=1973|volume=14|issue=2|pages=201–214|doi=10.3758/bf03212378}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Early work suggested that the brain may contain mechanisms specialised for the detection of other humans from motion signals, but over the years this claim has been scaled down to the point where some authors now suggest that we have more generalised detectors tuned simply to the characteristic signal generated by the feet of a [[Animal locomotion|locomoting]] animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|  title=The Inversion Effect in Biological Motion Perception: Evidence for a "Life Detector"? | journal=Current Biology | volume= 16 | issue= 8 | pages= 821–824 | author=N . Troje, C . Westhoff|  doi=10.1016/j.cub.2006.03.022|  pmid=16631591|  year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Experiments ==
An experiment by Cutting and Kozlowski found that individuals are better at identifying themselves compared to others when looking at gait on a point-light display.&lt;sup&gt;[[Biological motion#cite note-:0-3|[3]]]&lt;/sup&gt; In a point-light display, participants are presented with a static or dynamic visual that consists of small, circular light sources placed on the major joints that allow movement for humans. Although these lights are individual, participants are able to perceive motion in the dynamic visuals. &lt;sup&gt;[[Biological motion#cite note-4|[4]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Participants are able to recognize different emotions from the point light-displays. With special attention to body language, one can identify anger, sadness, and happiness. Also, gender is identifiable from these displays.

Humans perception of biological motion matures with age, usually capping at around five years of age. In an experiment by Pavlova et al., 2001, three-year olds, four-year olds, five-year olds, and adults were asked to identify animals (walking human, running dog, flying bird, and walking dog) displayed with moving point-light displays. The adults and five-year olds were able to accurately identify the moving animal, while four-year olds and three-year olds struggled (although 4-year olds were significantly better than 3-year olds). This implies that our perception of motion gets better as we age and reach the cap at five years. While animals tend to recognize their own species over others (for example, cats recognize their own point-light displays over scrambled ones&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blake|first=Randolph|date=1993-01-01|title=Cats Perceive Biological Motion|url=http://pss.sagepub.com/content/4/1/54|journal=Psychological Science|language=en|volume=4|issue=1|pages=54–57|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.1993.tb00557.x|issn=0956-7976}}&lt;/ref&gt;), the three-year olds had the most success identifying a walking dog and least with a walking human. A possible explanation of this might be because of the children's small physical stature and their resulting visual perspectives: dogs are on the same horizontal plane as small kids, while human walkers are a lot taller and harder to perceive. In the next part of the experiment, different participants were asked to identify the same point-light display animals but with static images instead of moving dots. Five-year olds and adults gave results of [[Probability|chance performance]], while the younger participants were omitted due to the harder nature of the task. Therefore, this experiment suggests that at five-years old, we are adept at identifying animals with point-light displays and that motion is critical to how we perceive it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pavlova|first=Marina|date=April 24, 2001|title=Recognition of point-light biological displays by young children|url=|journal=Perception|volume=30|issue=8|doi=10.1068/p3157|pmid=11578078|via=Sage Journals|pages=925–933}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humans use similar cognitive functions in identifying real verbs and replicable motions. An experiment by Christel Bidet-Ildei and Lucette Toussaint gave participants a [[Content word|lexical]] and an action decision task to measure how long it took them to identify whether the words were real or the action doable. Participants took much longer to identify pseudo words and actions. The correlation between verbs and actions was found to be rather strong (r= 0.56), while the correlation between nouns and actions was much lower (r= 0.31). This suggests that humans use similar cognitive functions to identify motion, whether it is presented through written language or point-light displays. The author suggests that these findings are in favor of the embodied theory, which states that the processing of actions and words use similar motor functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bidet-Ildei|first=Christel|last2=Toussaint|first2=Lucette|date=2014-09-20|title=Are judgments for action verbs and point-light human actions equivalent?|journal=Cognitive Processing|language=en|volume=16|issue=1|pages=57–67|doi=10.1007/s10339-014-0634-0|pmid=25238900|issn=1612-4782}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent research has begun to focus on the brain structures that are necessary for this processing. Use of [[Transcranial magnetic stimulation|Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation]] gave evidence to suggest that biological motion processing is a dual process that looks at both form and motion, located outside of the MT+/V5 area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mather | first1 = G. | last2 = Battaglini | first2 = L. | last3 = Campana | first3 = G. | year = 2016 | title = TMS reveals flexible use of form and motion cues in biological motion perception | url = | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 84 | issue = | pages = 193–197 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2016.02.015 | pmid=26916969}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further evidence from another study show that the [[Default mode network|Default Mode Network]] is essential in distinguishing between biological and non-biological motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dayan | first1 = E. | last2 = Sella | first2 = I. | last3 = Mukovskiy | first3 = A. | last4 = Douek | first4 = Y. | last5 = Giese | first5 = M.

Other research looks into the differences between global and local processing of biological motion. One study investigated the contradiction by replacing the local dots of point-light displays with human images or stick figures; the results showed that the brain allocates fewer resources to the global form processing when the local elements are complex, indicating that the brain uses a similar form-based mechanism for the recognition of both global and local stimuli during processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kerr-Gaffney | first1 = J. E. | last2 = Hunt | first2 = A. R. | last3 = Pilz | first3 = K. S. | year = 2016 | title = Local form interference in biological motion perception | url = | journal = Attention, Perception, &amp; Psychophysics | volume = 78 | issue = 5| pages = 1434–1443 | doi = 10.3758/s13414-016-1092-9 | pmid = 27016343 | pmc = 4914516 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The results also show that processing local images is an automatic process that interferes with the subsequent processing of the global form of the stimulus.

==Psychophysics==
Perception of biological motion depends both on the motions of individual dots and the configuration/orientation of the body as a whole, as well as interactions between these local and global cues. Similar to the [[Thatcher Effect]] in face perception, inversion of individual points is easy to detect when the entire figure is presented normally, but difficult to detect when the entire display is presented upside-down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mirenzi | first1 = A | last2 = Hiris | first2 = E | year = 2011 | title = The Thatcher effect in biological motion | url = | journal = Perception | volume = 40 | issue = 10| pages = 1257–1260 | doi=10.1068/p7077| pmid = 22308898 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, recent electrophysiological work suggest that the configuration/orientation of the figure might be more important than the figure's motion, at least for early levels of processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The [[superior temporal sulcus]] is known to be activated for biological motion perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Grossman | first1 = E. | last2 = Blake | first2 = R. | year = 2002 | title = Brain areas active during visual perception of biological motion | doi = 10.1016/s0896-6273(02)00897-8 | journal = Neuron | volume = 35 | issue = 6| pages = 1167–1175 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, premotor cortex is important, which indicates that the mirror neuron system is recruited for "filling in" the dots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Saygin | first1 = A.P. | last2 = Wilson | first2 = S.M. | last3 = Hagler Jr | first3 = D.J. | last4 = Bates | first4 = E. | last5 = Sereno | first5 = M.I. | year = 2004 | title = Point-light biological motion perception activates human premotor cortex | url = | journal = Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 24 | issue = 27| pages = 6181–6188 | doi=10.1523/jneurosci.0504-04.2004| pmid = 15240810 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Control system security''' is the prevention of intentional or unintentional interference with the proper operation of [[automation|industrial automation]] and [[industrial control systems|control systems]]. These control systems manage essential services including electricity, petroleum production, water, transportation, manufacturing, and communications. They rely on computers, networks, operating systems, applications, and [[programmable logic controller|programmable controllers]], each of which could contain [[vulnerability (computing)|security vulnerabilities]]. The 2010 discovery of the [[Stuxnet|Stuxnet worm]] demonstrated the vulnerability of these systems to cyber incidents.&lt;ref name="tofinoexida201202"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.exida.com/index.php/News/new_whitepaper_the_7_steps_to_ics_and_scada_security/ | title=The 7 Steps to ICS Security | accessdate=March 3, 2011 | author1=Byres, Eric | author2=Cusimano, John | date=February 2012 | publisher=Tofino Security and exida Consulting LLC | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123141949/http://www.exida.com/index.php/News/new_whitepaper_the_7_steps_to_ics_and_scada_security/ | archivedate=January 23, 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States and other governments have passed [[cyber-security regulation]]s requiring enhanced  protection for control systems operating critical infrastructure.

Control system security is known by several other names such as ''[[SCADA]] security'', ''PCN security'', ''industrial [[network security]]'', and ''control system cyber security''.

== Risks ==
Insecurity of, or vulnerabilities inherent in industrial automation and control systems (IACS) can lead to severe consequences in categories such as safety, loss of life, personal injury, environmental impact, lost production, equipment damage, information theft, and company image.
Guidance to assess, evaluate and mitigate these potential risks is provided through the application of many Governmental, regulatory, industry documents and Global Standards, addressed below.

== Vulnerability of control systems ==
Industrial automation and control systems have become far more vulnerable to security incidents due to the following trends that have occurred over the last 10 to 15 years.  
* Heavy use of Commercial Off-the Shelf Technology (COTS) and protocols.  Integration of technology such as MS Windows, SQL, and Ethernet means that process control systems are now vulnerable to the same viruses, worms and trojans that affect IT systems 
* Enterprise integration (using plant, corporate and even public networks) means that process control systems (legacy) are now being subjected to stresses they were not designed for
* Demand for Remote Access - 24/7 access for engineering, operations or technical support means more insecure or rogue connections to control system
* Public Information - Manuals on how to use control system are publicly available to would be attackers as well as to legitimate users

The cyber threats and attack strategies on automation systems are changing rapidly.  Fortunately, regulation of control system security is rare as regulation is a slow moving process. The United States, for example, only does so for the [[nuclear power in the United States|nuclear power]] and the [[chemical industry|chemical industries]].&lt;ref name="gross201104"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2011/04/stuxnet-201104|title=A Declaration of Cyber-War|author=Gross, Michael Joseph|first=|date=2011-04-01|work=Vanity Fair|publisher=Condé Nast|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140713082739/http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2011/04/stuxnet-201104|archivedate=2017-11-29|accessdate=2017-11-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Government efforts ==
The U.S. Government [[Computer Emergency Readiness Team]] (US-CERT) originally instituted a [[control systems security program]] (CSSP) now the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) Industrial Control Systems, which has made available a large set of free National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards documents regarding control system security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.us-cert.gov/control_systems/csstandards.html|title=Standards and References - NCCIC / ICS-CERT|website=ics-cert.us-cert.gov/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Automation &amp; control system security standards ==

===ISA/IEC-62443 (Formerly ISA-99)===
ISA/IEC-62443 is a series of standards, technical reports, and related information that define procedures for implementing electronically secure Industrial Automation and Control Systems (IACS). This guidance applies to end-users (i.e. asset owner), system integrators, security practitioners, and control systems manufacturers responsible for manufacturing, designing, implementing, or managing industrial automation and control systems.

These documents were originally referred to as '''ANSI/ISA-99''' or '''ISA99''' standards, as they were created by the [[International Society of Automation|International Society for Automation (ISA)]] 99 committee, accredited by and publicly released as [[American National Standards Institute|American National Standards Institute (ANSI)]] documents. In 2010, they were renumbered to be the '''ANSI/ISA-62443''' series. This change was intended to align the ISA and ANSI document numbering with the corresponding [[International Electrotechnical Commission|International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)]] standards.

All ISA work products are now numbered using the convention “ISA-62443-x-y” and previous ISA99 nomenclature is maintained for continuity purposes only. 

ISA99 remains the name of the Industrial Automation and Control System Security Committee of the ISA. Since 2002, the committee has been developing a multi-part series of standards and technical reports on the subject of IACS security. These work products are then submitted to the ISA approval and then publishing under ANSI. They are also submitted to IEC for consideration as standards and specifications in the IEC 62443 series following the IEC standards development process.

[[File:ISA-62443_Standard_Series_2012.png|thumb|right|alt=The numbering and organization of ISA62443 work products into categories.|Planned and published ISA62443 work products for IACS Security.]] All ISA-62443 standards and technical reports are organized into four general categories called ''General'', ''Policies and Procedures'', ''System'' and ''Component''.&lt;ref&gt;More information about the activities and plans of the ISA99 committee is available on the committee Wiki site ([https://web.archive.org/web/20110402180044/http://isa99.isa.org/ISA99%20Wiki/Home.aspx])&lt;/ref&gt;

# The first (top) category includes common or foundational information such as concepts, models and terminology. Also included are work products that describe security metrics and security life cycles for IACS.
# The second category of work products targets the Asset Owner. These address various aspects of creating and maintaining an effective IACS security program.
# The third category includes work products that describe system design guidance and requirements for the secure integration of control systems. Core in this is the zone and conduit design model.
# The fourth category includes work products that describe the specific product development and technical requirements of control system products. This is primarily intended for control product vendors, but can be used by integrator and asset owners for to assist in the procurement of secure products.

=== IEC-62443 ===
The IEC-62443 cybersecurity standards are the result of the IEC standards creation process where ANSI/ISA-62443 proposals are submitted to country committees where review is done and comments regarding changes are submitted.  The comments are reviewed by various IEC 62443 committees where comments are discussed and changes are made as agreed upon. Many members of the IEC committees are the same persons from the ISA S99 committees.  To date, the fundamental concepts from the original ANSI/ISA 62443 documents have been utilized. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/7033|title=Standards and References - IEC-62443|website=www.iec.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;


These standards are being used by practitioners in several industries to design and evaluate automation systems for cybersecurity resilience. Several of the standards are being used in personnel, engineering process, product, and system cybersecurity certification programs (also called conformity assessment programs).  

Certifications are awarded by accredited Certification Bodies (CB) who operate following ISO/IEC 17065 and ISO/IEC 17025. Certification Bodies are accredited to perform the auditing, assessment, and testing work by an Accreditation Body (AB). There is often one national AB in each country. These ABs operate per the requirements of ISO/IEC 17011, a standard that contains requirements for the competence, consistency, and impartiality of accreditation bodies when accrediting conformity assessment bodies.  ABs are typically members of the International Accreditation Forum (IAF) for work in management systems, products, services, and personnel accreditation or the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC) for laboratory accreditation. A Multilateral Recognition Arrangement (MLA) between ABs will ensure global recognition of accredited CBs.

== Control system security certification ==

=== The ISA Security Compliance Institute (ISCI) Conformity Assessment Program  ===
ISCI created the first conformity assessment scheme (commonly known as a certification scheme) for the ISA S99 IACS cybersecurity standards. This program certifies Commercial Off-the-shelf (COTS) IACS products and systems, addressing securing the IACS supply chain. 
exida from the United States was the first organization accredited for the ISCI scheme by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) followed by the Control Systems Security Center – Certification Laboratory (CSSC-CL) accredited by the Japan Accreditation Board (JAB) and TÜV Rheinland accredited by Deutsche Akkreditierungsstelle (DAkkS).  All of these AB organizations are members of the IAF.

==== ISCI Certification Offerings====
Two COTS product certifications are available under the ISASecure® brand: ISASecure-EDSA (Embedded Device Security Assurance) certifying IACS products to the 62443-4-1 / 62443-4-2 IACS cybersecurity standards and ISASecure-SSA (System Security Assurance), certifying IACS systems to the same standards.

A third certification, SDLA (Secure Development Lifecycle Assurance) is available from ISCI which certifies IACS development organizations to the 62443-4-1 cybersecurity standard, providing assurances that a supplier organization has institutionalized cybersecurity into their product development practices.

====ISO 17065 and Global Accreditation====
The ISASecure 62443 conformity assessment scheme is an ISO 17065 program whose labs (certification bodies or CB) are independently accredited by ANSI/ANAB, JAB and other global ISO 17011 accreditation bodies (AB).  The certification labs must also meet ISO 17025 lab accreditation requirements to ensure consistent application of certification requirements and recognized tools.

Through Mutual Recognition Arrangements (MRA) with IAF, ILAC and others, the accreditation of the ISASecure labs by the ISA 17011 accreditation bodies ensures that certificates issued by any of the ISASecure labs are globally recognized.

====Test Tool Recognition====
The ISASecure scheme includes a process for recognizing test tools to ensure the tools meet functional requirements necessary and sufficient to execute all required product tests and that test results will be consistent among the recognized tools.

====Chemicals, Oil and Gas Industries====
ISCI development processes include maintenance policies to ensure that the ISASecure certifications remain in alignment with the IEC 62443 standards as they evolve. While the IEC 62443 standards are designed to horizontally address technical cybersecurity requirements of a cross-section of industries, the ISASecure scheme’s certification requirements working groups include subject matter experts from the chemical and oil and gas industries and are reflective of their cybersecurity needs.

=== IEC 62443 Certification Programs===
IEC 62443 certification schemes have also been established by several global Certification Bodies.  Each has defined their own scheme based upon the referenced standards and procedures.  Programs are being offered globally by several recognized CBs including exida, TÜV Rheinland, TÜV Sud, TÜV Nord, and SGS-TÜV Saar.

'''Cross-resistance''' is the [[Drug tolerance|tolerance]] to a usually [[toxic substance]] as a result of exposure to a similarly acting substance. It is a phenomenon affecting e.g. [[pesticide]]s and [[antibiotic]]s. As an example [[rifabutin]] and [[rifampin]] cross react in the treatment of tuberculosis. This sort of resistance is also seen against drugs involved with the treatment of HIV. Drugs ending  with "- ine" and "-inavir" are the most common.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Far from the most common energy supply, the [[sun]], and from many nutrient supplies closely tied to the surface, the [[deep sea]] is still home to a unique ecosystem. '''Deep-sea wood''' is the term for wood which sinks to the ocean floor. All organisms of the ocean floor face unique challenges in [[Adenosine triphosphate|synthesizing ATP/GTP]] needed for cellular function and replication. In this case, '''deep-sea wood''' supports a unique form of deep sea community life including chemo-synthetic [[bacteria]]. Sources of carbon for these organisms are not limited to wood, but also include [[kelp]] and the remains of [[whales]]. As it is difficult and very costly to simply discover logs that have fallen to the ocean floor, much of what is known about '''deep-sea wood''' is obtained from experiments by marine biologists, in which wood is forced to the bottom of the ocean for a set amount of time and is then collected later for sampling.

==Organisms present==

===Wood boring bivalves===
Colonization experiments revealed the presence of wood boring bivalves that belong to the subfamily Xylophagainae, such as ''Xylophaga dorsalis'',&lt;ref&gt;Bienhold, Christina; Pop Ristova, Petra; Wenzhöfer, Frank; Dittmar, Thorsten &amp; Boetius, Antje.(2 January 2013). [http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0053590 ''How Deep-Sea Wood Falls Sustain Chemosynthetic Life''], PLoS ONE, {{doi|10.1371/journal.pone.0053590}}. Retrieved 25 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; or other species recently described from deep-sea canyons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Romano |first1=Chiara |last2=Voight |first2=Janet Ruth |last3=Perez-Portela |first3=Rocio |last4=Martin |first4=Daniel |title=Morphological and Genetic Diversity of the Wood-Boring Xylophaga (Mollusca, Bivalvia): New Species and Records from Deep-Sea Iberian Canyons |journal=PLoS ONE|date=2014 |volume=9 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0102887 |page=e102887}}&lt;/ref&gt; They range in shell size from 1-10mm. These bivalves are able to digest wood with the help of symbiotic bacteria in their gills.

===Chemosyntheic fauna===
Chemosyntheic muscles identified as ''Idas modiolaeformis'' were also found in deep sea wood when organic matter settled for at least one year. They are slightly smaller than the bivalves found and range in length from 1-6mm.

===Other organisms===
A variety of deep-sea crabs and sea urchins seemed to also be chemically attracted to the wood. There are numerous species of snail that have been discovered on the wood, along with predatory worms and small crustaceans. Their attraction to the wood may be attributed to its bacterial inhabitants serving as a base organism for deep-sea life, with the potential to feed on microorganisms, or other inhabitants of the wood.

==Fungal communities==
Fungi are the major degraders of [[Lignocellulosic biomass|lignocellulose]] in aquatic environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hyde|first=K.D.|last2=Jones|first2=E. B. G.|last3=Leano|first3=E.|last4=Pointing|first4=S.B.|last5=Poonyth|first5=A.D.|last6=Vrijmoed|first6=L.L.P.|year=1998|title=Role of fungi in marine ecosystems.|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/46139810/a_3A100882351515720160601-22434-c1u3aw.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1490033337&amp;Signature=XxahzMmEhm6uOlvXGsEJesUdF%2Fk%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DRole_of_fungi_in_marine_ecosystems.pdf|journal=Biodiversity and Conservation|volume=7|pages=1147–1161|via=|doi=10.1023/a:1008823515157}}&lt;/ref&gt; In aerobic terrestrial environments, a majority of cellulose breakdown is broken down by [[wood-decay fungus|wood-decay fungi]]&lt;ref&gt;Baldrian P, Valásková V. Degradation of cellulose by basidiomycetous fungi FEMS Microbiol Rev. 2008 May;32(3):501-21. {{doi|10.1111/j.1574-6976.2008.00106.x}}. Epub 2008 Mar 26.&lt;/ref&gt; commonly and collectively known as white rot and soft rot. Complex enzymes are secreted by the various fungi, converting cellulose into a carbon form that can be utilized by the fungus, and subsequently any organism up the food chain.

==Bacterial communities==
Bacteria also contribute to the digestion of '''deep-sea wood,''' using an alternative method from that of fungi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leschine | first1 = SB | year = 1995 | title = Cellulose degradation in anaerobic environments | url = | journal = Annu Rev Microbiol | volume = 49 | issue = | pages = 399–426 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.mi.49.100195.002151 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lynd | first1 = LR | last2 = Weimer | first2 = PJ | last3 = van Zyl | first3 = WH | last4 = Pretorius | first4 = IS | year = 2002 | title = Microbial cellulose utilization: Fundamentals and biotechnology (vol 66, pg 506, 2002) | url = https://naldc.nal.usda.gov/naldc/download.xhtml?id=13843&amp;content=PDF| journal = Microbiol Mol Biol Rev | volume = 66 | issue = | pages = 739–739 | doi = 10.1128/mmbr.66.4.739.2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to classify bacteria present on deep-sea wood, a variety of different techniques are employed. First, biomass allows scientists to quantify the amount of bacterial growth on a sample. Then DNA extraction and Automated [[Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer analysis]] (ARISA) can be used to identify the strains of bacteria present that are most dominant, and the ones that are present.

While ''Gammaproteobacteria'' dominated the composition of bacteria found on freshly submerged wood, many other bacterial strains populated in response to colonization of the aforementioned wood-boring ''Xylophaga'', which take the large chunks of wood and convert them into fine chips and fecal matter. These processed forms of carbon lead to the growth of many other marine bacteria including ''Alphaproteobacteria'', ''Flavobacteria'', ''Actinobacteria'', ''Clostridia'', and ''Bacteroidetes''.&lt;ref&gt;Bienhold, Christina; Pop Ristova, Petra; Wenzhöfer, Frank; Dittmar, Thorsten &amp; Boetius, Antje.(2 January 2013). [http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0053590 ''How Deep-Sea Wood Falls Sustain Chemosynthetic Life''], PLoS ONE, {{doi|10.1371/journal.pone.0053590}}. Retrieved 25 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wood degradation===

====Presence of anaerobes====
The presence of ''Clostridia'', obligate [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobes]] suggests that the process of degrading the '''deep-sea wood''' may create oxygen-free environments for these bacteria to survive in.&lt;ref&gt;Bienhold, Christina; Pop Ristova, Petra; Wenzhöfer, Frank; Dittmar, Thorsten &amp; Boetius, Antje.(2 January 2013). [http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0053590 ''How Deep-Sea Wood Falls Sustain Chemosynthetic Life''], PLoS ONE, {{doi|10.1371/journal.pone.0053590}}. Retrieved 25 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sulfur reducing bacteria====
Many bacterial strains that were found on '''deep-sea wood''' were [[sulfur-reducing bacteria]], meaning they obtain energy from reducing elemental sulfur, instead of traditionally using the sun for energy like almost all other organisms. Marine biologists suggest they may contribute to the break down of cellulose from the wood.&lt;ref&gt;Bienhold, Christina; Pop Ristova, Petra; Wenzhöfer, Frank; Dittmar, Thorsten &amp; Boetius, Antje.(2 January 2013). [http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0053590 ''How Deep-Sea Wood Falls Sustain Chemosynthetic Life''], PLoS ONE, {{doi|10.1371/journal.pone.0053590}}. Retrieved 25 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variability of organisms== 
The species of wood that falls to the ocean floor produces variability in the organisms present on it. There is also natural viability between organisms found on the same species of tree, which promotes to deep-sea diversity. If fact, a study by marine biologists showed bacterial communities were approximately 75% dissimilar, even as similar logs of the same tree species were placed within the same 500m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; area.&lt;ref&gt;Craig McClain, James Barry Beta-diversity on deep-sea wood falls reflects gradients in energy availability {{doi|10.1098/rsbl.2014.0129Published}} 9 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2326">'''Dialogue''', in fiction, is a verbal exchange between two or more characters. If there is only ''one'' character talking aloud, it is a [[monologue]].

==Identifiers==
''"This breakfast is making me sick," George said.''

The ''George said'' is the identifier. ''Said'' is the [[verb]] most writers use because reader familiarity with ''said'' prevents it from drawing attention to itself. Although other verbs such as ''ask'', ''shout'', or ''reply'' are acceptable, some identifiers get in the reader's way. For example:

''"Hello," he croaked nervously, "my name's Horace."''&lt;br&gt;
''"What's yours?" he asked with as much aplomb as he could muster.''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Turco|1989|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
another example is:
"My name is Peg, what's yours?" I asked.
"My name is William, but my friends call me Will," said Will.

[[Stephen King]], in his book ''[[On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft|On Writing]]'', expresses his belief that ''said'' is the best identifier to use. King recommends reading a novel by [[Larry McMurtry]], who he claims has mastered the art of well-written dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|King|2000|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Substitutes are known as ''said-bookisms''. For example, in the sentence ''"What do you mean?" he smiled.'', the word ''smiled'' is a said-bookism.

'''Discourse''' (from [[Latin]] ''discursus'', "running to and from") denotes written and spoken [[communication]]s:

* In [[semantics]] and [[discourse analysis]]: Discourse is a conceptual generalization of [[conversation]] within each modality and context of communication.
* The totality of codified language (vocabulary) used in a given field of intellectual enquiry and of social practice, such as legal discourse, medical discourse, religious discourse, et cetera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marks|first=Larry|date=June 2001|publisher=revue-texto.net|accessdate=25 May 2011|title=A Little Glossary of Semantics|url=http://www.revue-texto.net/Reperes/Glossaires/Glossaire_en.html#discourse}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the work of [[Michel Foucault]], and that of the social theoreticians he inspired: ''discourse'' describes "an entity of sequences, of signs, in that they are enouncements (''énoncés'')", statements in conversation.&lt;ref name=Foucault1969&gt;{{Cite book| author = M. Foucault| year = 1969| title = [[The Archaeology of Knowledge|L'Archéologie du savoir]]| location = Paris| publisher = Éditions Gallimard| authorlink = M. Foucault}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As discourse, an "enouncement" (statement) is not a unit of [[semiotic]] signs, but an abstract construct that allows the semiotic signs to assign meaning, and so communicate specific, repeatable communications to, between, and among objects, subjects, and statements.&lt;ref name=Foucault1969 /&gt; Therefore, a discourse is composed of semiotic sequences (relations among signs that communicate meaning) between and among objects, subjects, and statements.

The term "discursive formation" ({{lang-fr|formation discursive}}) conceptually describes the regular communications (written and spoken) that produce such discourses, such as informal conversations. As a philosopher, Michel Foucault applied the discursive formation in the analyses of large bodies of knowledge, such as [[political economy]] and [[natural history]].&lt;ref name=Foucault1970&gt;{{Cite book|author= M. Foucault|title=[[The Order of Things]]|year=1970|orig-year=1966| publisher=[[Pantheon Books|Pantheon]]|isbn= 0-415-26737-4|authorlink= M. Foucault}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Compact Oxford Dictionary, Thesaurus and Wordpower Guide'' (2001). Oxford University Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first sense-usage (semantics and discourse analysis), the term ''discourse'' is studied in [[corpus linguistics]], the [[study of language]] expressed in ''[[Text corpus|corpora]]'' (samples) of "real world" text. In the second sense (the codified language of a field of enquiry) and in the third sense (a statement, ''un énoncé''), the analysis of a ''discourse'' examines and determines the connections among [[language]] and [[structure and agency]].

Moreover, because a discourse is a body of text meant to communicate specific data, information, and knowledge, there exist internal relations in the content of a given discourse; likewise, there exist external relations among discourses. As such, a discourse does not exist ''per se'' (in itself), but is related to other discourses, by way of inter-discursivity. Discourses are also perpetually differentiating toward each other in time&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308792484_Quantum_Anthropology_Man_Cultures_and_Groups_in_a_Quantum_Perspective|title=section on inter-discursivity, chapter 10 in Quantum anthropology: Man, cultures, and groups in a quantum perspective|last=Trnka R., Lorencova R.|first=|publisher=Charles University Karolinum Press|year=2016|isbn=978-80-246-3470-8|location=Prague|pages=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Meeting the Universe halfway: Quantum physics and entanglement of matter and meaning|last=Barad, K.|first=|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2007|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Therefore, in the course of [[Research|intellectual enquiry]], the discourse among researchers features the questions and answers of ''What is ...?'' and ''What is not. ...'', conducted according to the meanings (denotation and connotation) of the concepts (statements) used in the given field of enquiry, such as [[anthropology]], [[ethnography]], and [[sociology]]; [[cultural studies]] and [[literary theory]]; the [[philosophy of science]] and [[feminism]].

==The humanities==
In the [[humanities]] and in the [[social science]]s, the term ''discourse'' describes a formal way of thinking that can be expressed through language; the discourse is a social boundary that defines what statements can be said about a topic.

Discourse can affect the person's perspective; it is impossible to avoid discourse for any subject. For example, two notably distinct discourses can be used about various [[guerrilla]] movements describing them either as "[[Resistance movement|freedom fighters]]" or "[[terrorists]]". In other words, the chosen discourse provides the vocabulary, expressions and perhaps also the [[Stylistics (linguistics)|style]] needed to communicate.

Discourses are embedded in different rhetorical genres and metagenres that constrain and enable them. That is language talking about language, for instance the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s [[DSMIV]] manual tells which terms have to be used in talking about mental health, thereby mediating meanings and dictating practices of the professionals of psychology and psychiatry.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine F. Schryer and Philippa Spoel. Genre Theory, Health-Care Discourse, and Professional Identity Formation. Journal of Business and Technical Communication 2005. 19: 249  http://jbt.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/19/3/249&lt;/ref&gt;

Discourse is closely linked to different theories of [[Power (social and political)|power]] and [[State (polity)|state]], at least as long as defining discourses is seen to mean defining reality itself. This conception of discourse is largely derived from the work of French philosopher Michel Foucault.

== Formal semantics ==
A [[discourse representation theory]] describes the [[Formal semantics (linguistics)|formal semantics]] of a sentence using [[predicate logic]].&lt;ref&gt;Muskens, Reinhard. "[https://pure.uvt.nl/ws/files/180683/COMBININ.PDF Combining Montague semantics and discourse representation]." Linguistics and philosophy 19.2 (1996): 143-186.&lt;/ref&gt;
== Modernism ==

Modern theorists were focused on achieving progress and believed in the existence of natural and social laws which could be used universally to develop knowledge and thus a better understanding of society.&lt;ref name="Larrain, 1994"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modernist theorists therefore viewed discourse as being relative to talking or way of talking and understood discourse to be functional.&lt;ref name="Strega, 2005"&gt;Strega, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Discourse and language transformations are ascribed to progress or the need to develop new or more "accurate" words to describe new discoveries, understandings, or areas of interest.&lt;ref name="Strega, 2005"/&gt; In modern times, language and discourse are dissociated from power and ideology and instead conceptualized as "natural" products of common sense usage or progress.&lt;ref name="Strega, 2005"/&gt; [[Modernism]] further gave rise to the liberal discourses of rights, equality, freedom, and justice; however, this rhetoric masked substantive inequality and failed to account for differences, according to Regnier.&lt;ref&gt;Regnier, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structuralism ==

[[Structuralism|Structuralist]] theorists, such as [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] and [[Jacques Lacan]], argue that all human actions and social formations are related to [[language]] and can be understood as systems of related elements.&lt;ref name="Howarth, 2000"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the "…individual elements of a system only have significance when considered in relation to the structure as a whole, and that structures are to be understood as self-contained, self-regulated, and self-transforming entities." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

| page =17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, it is the structure itself that determines the significance, meaning and function of the individual elements of a system. Structuralism has made an important contribution to our understanding of language and social systems.&lt;ref&gt;Sommers, Aaron. ''Discourse and Difference'' "University of New Hampshire Cosmology Seminar" [http://www-ssg.sr.unh.edu/preceptorial/Summaries_2002/summary3_2002.html]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Course in General Linguistics|Saussure's theory of language]] highlights the decisive role of meaning and signification in structuring human life more generally.&lt;ref name="Howarth, 2000"/&gt;

== Postmodernism ==

Following the perceived limitations of the modern era, emerged [[postmodernism|postmodern]] theory.&lt;ref name="Larrain, 1994"/&gt; Postmodern theorists rejected modernist claims that there was one theoretical approach that explained all aspects of society.&lt;ref name="Best &amp; Kellner, 1991"/&gt; Rather, postmodernist theorists were interested in examining the variety of experience of individuals and groups and emphasized differences over similarities and common experiences.&lt;ref name="Strega, 2005"/&gt;

In contrast to modern theory, postmodern theory is more fluid and allows for individual differences as it rejected the notion of social laws. Postmodern theorists shifted away from truth seeking and instead sought answers for how truths are produced and sustained. Postmodernists contended that truth and knowledge is plural, contextual, and historically produced through discourses. Postmodern researchers therefore embarked on analyzing discourses such as texts, language, policies and practices.&lt;ref name="Strega, 2005"/&gt;

French social theorist [[Michel Foucault]] developed a notion of discourse in his early work, especially the ''[[Archaeology of knowledge]]'' (1972). In ''Discursive Struggles Within Social Welfare: Restaging Teen Motherhood'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Lessa | first = Iara | title=Discursive struggles within social welfare: Restaging teen motherhood | journal= [[The British Journal of Social Work]] | volume=36 | issue = 2 | pages=283&amp;ndash;298 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press|Oxford Journals]] | doi=10.1093/bjsw/bch256 | date = February 2006 | url = https://doi.org/10.1093/bjsw/bch256 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iara Lessa summarizes Foucault's definition of discourse as "systems of thoughts composed of ideas, attitudes, courses of action, beliefs and practices that systematically construct the subjects and the worlds of which they speak." Foucault traces the role of discourses in wider social processes of legitimating and power, emphasizing the construction of current truths, how they are maintained and what power relations they carry with them. Foucault later theorized that discourse is a medium through which power relations produce speaking subjects.&lt;ref name="Strega, 2005"/&gt; Foucault (1977, 1980) argued that power and knowledge are inter-related and therefore every human relationship is a struggle and negotiation of power.&lt;ref&gt;Power/Knowledge: Selected Interviews and Other Writings, 1972–1977. M Foucault. ''Selected interviews and other writings'' 1972, 1977, 1980. [[Pantheon Books|Pantheon]]&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault further stated that power is always present and can both produce and constrain the truth.&lt;ref name="Strega, 2005"/&gt; Discourse according to Foucault (1977, 1980, 2003) is related to power as it operates by rules of exclusion. Discourse therefore is controlled by objects, what can be spoken of; ritual, where and how one may speak; and the privileged, who may speak.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coining the phrases [[power-knowledge]] Foucault (1980) stated knowledge was both the creator of power and creation of power.  An object becomes a "node within a network."  In his work, ''The Archaeology of Knowledge,'' Foucault uses the example of a book to illustrate a node within a network.  A book is not made up of individual words on a page, each of which has meaning, but rather "is caught up in a system of references to other books, other texts, other sentences."  The meaning of that book is connected to a larger, overarching web of knowledge and ideas to which it relates.

One of the key discourses that Foucault identified as part of his critique of power-knowledge was that of [[neoliberalism]], which he related very closely to his conceptualization of [[governmentality]] in his lectures on biopolitics.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, M. (2008) ''The Birth Of Biopolitics: Lectures at the Collège de France, 1978–1979''. New York: Palgrave MacMillan.&lt;/ref&gt; This trajectory of Foucault's thinking has been taken up widely within [[Human Geography]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a concept used in [[linguistics]] and [[semiotics]]. It refers to the two-level structure inherent to a [[sign system]], insofar as it is composed by two kinds of elements: 1) significant or meaningful, and 2) distinctive or meaningless.

==Theory==
''Double articulation''&lt;ref&gt;Occasionally also "double segmentation".&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the two fold structure of the stream of speech, which can be primarily divided into ''meaningful'' signs (like words or [[morphemes]]), and then secondarily into ''distinctive'' elements (like letters or [[phonemes]]). For example, the meaningful English word "cat" is composed of the sounds [k], [æ], and [t], which are meaningless as separate individual sounds (and which can also be combined to form the separate words "tack" and "act", with distinct meanings). These sounds, called [[phonemes]], represent the secondary and lowest level of articulation in the hierarchy of the organization of speech. Higher, primary, levels of organization (including [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[syntax]], and [[semantics]]) govern the combination of these individually meaningless phonemes into meaningful elements.

==History==
The French concept of ''double articulation'' was first introduced by the [[André Martinet]],&lt;ref&gt;André Martinet, ''Éléments de linguistique générale'', Colin, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1949. The English calque ''double articulation'' has been criticised as inaccurate and is often replaced by ''duality of patterning''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=3935606 | pmid=24587833 | doi=10.1515/langcog-2012-0014 | volume=4 | title=New perspectives on duality of patterning: Introduction to the special issue | year=2012 | journal=Lang Cogn | pages=251–259 | last1 = de Boer | first1 = B | last2 = Sandler | first2 = W | last3 = Kirby | first3 = S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Charles F. Hockett]] and other linguists, this duality is an important property of human languages, since it allows for the expression of a potentially infinite number of meaningful language sequences. Strictly speaking, however, such expressiveness follows from [[generativity]] or [[Productivity_(linguistics)|productivity]] (a finite number of components combining via rules to produce a potentially infinite arrangement of novel utterances), not of duality per se (one could have a system with 2 levels of the kind referred to as duality, and yet have only finite productivity. For further discussion, see [[figurae]], as well as [[Hockett's_design_features]], which treats productivity and duality as distinct essential properties of language.

[[Sign language]]s may have less double articulation because more gestures are possible than sound and able to convey more meaning without double articulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sedivy|first1=Julie|title=The Unusual Language That Linguists Thought Couldn’t Exist|url=http://nautil.us/blog/the-unusual-language-that-linguists-thought-couldnt-exist|website=Nautilus|accessdate=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Still contains unverified claims.  Still looking though--&gt;

'''Fides''' ([[Latin]]: ''trust'') is a guide allowing estimated reliability calculation for electronic components and systems. The reliability prediction is generally expressed in [[Failure rate|FIT]] (number of failures for 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; hours) or [[Mean time between failures|MTBF]] (Mean Time Between Failures). This guide provides reliability data for RAMS (Reliability, Availability, Maintainability, Safety) studies.

==Purpose==
Fides is a ''[[Délégation générale pour l'armement|DGA]]'' ([[France|French]] armament industry supervision agency) study conducted by a [[Europe]]an consortium formed by eight [[Business magnate|industrialists]] from the fields of [[aeronautics]] and Defence:

*[[Airbus|AIRBUS]] France
*[[Eurocopter]]
*[[Nexter]] Electronics
*[[MBDA]] Missiles Systems
*Thales Services
*Thales Airborne Systems
*Thales Avionics
*[[Thales Underwater Systems]]

The first aim of the Fides project was to develop a new reliability assessment method for electronic components which takes into consideration [[Commercial off-the-shelf|COTS]] (commercial off-the-shelf) and specific parts and the new technologies. The global aim is to find a replacement to the worldwide reference MIL-HDBK-217F,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://assist.daps.dla.mil/quicksearch/basic_profile.cfm?ident_number=53939|title =MIL-HDBK-217F. Military Handbook – Reliability Prediction of Electronic Equipment. Department of Defense, 1991|accessdate =2007-11-17|date =|format =|pages =|publisher =|quote =|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070311233011/http://assist.daps.dla.mil/quicksearch/basic_profile.cfm?ident_number=53939|archivedate =2007-03-11|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is old and has not been revised since 1995 (issue F notice 2). Moreover, the MIL HDBK 217F is very pessimistic for COTS components which are more and more widely used in military and aerospace systems.

The second aim was to write a reliability engineering guide in order to provide engineering process and tools to improve reliability in the development of new electronic systems.

==Method content==
The Fides guide is made of two distinct parts. The first is a reliability prediction calculation method concerning main electronic component families and complete subassemblies like [[Hard disk drive|hard disks]] or [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] displays. The second part is a [[process control]] and [[audit]] guide which is a tool to assess the reliability quality and technical know-how in the operating time of the studied product, operational specification and maintenance. 

==Availability==&lt;!--Probably not the best way, but it works.  Drawing attention to the fact the site requires free registration before the viewer visits--&gt;
The Fides guide is freely available on the &lt;span class="reference"&gt;[[#External_FidesSiteLink|Fides reliability website]]&lt;/span&gt;.

== Standardization==
The French standardisation organisation UTE (''Union Technique de l'Electricité'') has accepted the Fides publication, with the reference UTE C 80 811 (available in both French and English). An international normative reference extension ([[International Electrotechnical Commission]]) is planned for the future.

==Future==
Fides has met great interest and success since the end of the study in 2004. The method has been quickly declared a standard that can be applied to French military programs. For two years, the French military experts of DGA have already used FIDES method in different major programs for Defence, in missiles or tactical [[telecommunication]]s fields for example.

[[United States|American]] companies like [[Boeing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.aero.org/conferences/mrqw/2004-papers/Bechtold.pdf |title = COTS Electronics Reliability - An Assessment of FIDES |accessdate = 2007-11-19 |date = 2005-01-03 &lt;!--date was specified as 3/01/2005. document metadata states 2005-01-03--&gt; |format = PDF |pages =  |publisher = Boeing |quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Japan]]ese organisations like [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency|JAXA]] (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) as well as French companies or organisations like ''[[Électricité de France|EDF]]'' (''Electricité de France'', French electricity provider) or ''[[CNES]]'' (''Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales'', the French space agency) showed an interest in FIDES methodology, but none of them are using FIDES at this time.

Further developments of the Fides guide (such as the improvement of existing models and the widening of the spectrum covered by component families) resulted in a new version of the Fides guide being published in the middle of year 2009.

A '''food group''' is a collection of [[food]]s that share similar [[nutrition]]al properties or [[biological classification]]s. [[List of nutrition guides|Nutrition guides]] typically divide foods into food groups and [[Recommended Dietary Allowance|recommend]] daily [[serving size|servings]] of each group for a [[health]]y [[diet (nutrition)|diet]]. In the United States for instance, [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] has described food as being in from 4 to 11 different groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nestle, Marion|authorlink=Marion Nestle|title=Food Politics: How the Food Industry Influences Nutrition and Health|year=2013|origyear=2002|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-27596-6|pages=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The most common food groups==
* '''[[Dairy product|Dairy]]''', also called '''milk products''' and sometimes categorized with [[:Category:Milk substitutes|milk alternatives]] or meat, is typically a smaller category in [[nutrition guides]],&lt;ref name=AU&gt;{{cite web|title=The Australian Guide to Healthy Eating - Enjoy a Variety of Foods Every Day |url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/health-pubhlth-strateg-food-guide-guide2.htm |work=Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing |accessdate=3 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319033600/http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/health-pubhlth-strateg-food-guide-guide2.htm |archivedate=March 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UK&gt;{{cite web|title=The eatwell plate|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Goodfood/Pages/eatwell-plate.aspx|work=National Health Service|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=US&gt;{{cite web|title=USDA's MyPlate|url=http://www.choosemyplate.gov/|work=United States Department of Agriculture|accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; if present at all, and is sometimes listed apart from other food groups.&lt;ref name="AU" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UK" /&gt; Examples of dairy products include milk, butter, ghee, [[yogurt]], [[cheese]], cream and ice cream. The categorization of dairy as a food group with recommended daily servings has been criticized by, for example, the [[Harvard School of Public Health]] who point out that "research has shown little benefit, and considerable potential for harm, of such high dairy intakes. Moderate consumption of milk or other dairy products—one to two servings a day—is fine, and likely has some benefits for children. But it’s not essential for adults, for a host of reasons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/healthy-eating-plate-questions/|title=Healthy Eating Plate &amp; Healthy Eating Pyramid|date=18 September 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Fruits]]''', sometimes categorized with vegetables, include [[apple]]s, [[orange (fruit)|oranges]], [[banana]]s, [[berry|berries]] and [[lemon]]s. Fruits contain carbohydrates, mostly in the form of sugar as well as important vitamins and minerals.
* '''[[Cereal|Grains, beans and legumes]]''', sometimes categorized as '''cereals''', is often the largest category in nutrition guides.&lt;ref name=AU/&gt;&lt;ref name=UK/&gt;&lt;ref name=US/&gt; Examples include [[wheat]], [[rice]], [[oat]]s, [[barley]], [[bread]] and [[pasta]]. An example of beans would be baked beans and soy beans, while an example of legumes would be lentils and chickpeas. Grains are a good source of [[starch]] and are often categorized with other starchy food such as potatoes. 
* '''[[Meat]]''', sometimes labelled '''[[protein]]''' and occasionally inclusive of [[legume]]s and beans, [[egg (food)|eggs]], [[meat analogue]]s and/or dairy, is typically a medium- to smaller-sized category in nutrition guides.&lt;ref name=AU/&gt;&lt;ref name=UK/&gt;&lt;ref name=US/&gt; Examples include [[chicken (food)|chicken]], [[fish (food)|fish]], [[turkey (food)|turkey]], [[pork]] and [[beef]].
* '''[[confectionery|Confections]]''', also called '''[[confectionery|sugary foods]]''' and sometimes categorized with [[fat]]s and [[oils]], is typically a very small category in nutrition guides, if present at all, and is sometimes listed apart from other food groups.&lt;ref name=AU/&gt;&lt;ref name=UK/&gt; Examples include [[candy]], [[soft drinks]], and chocolate. 
* '''[[Vegetable]]s''', sometimes categorized with fruit and occasionally inclusive of [[legumes]], is typically a large category second only to [[Food grain|grain]]s, or sometimes equal or superior to grains, in nutrition guides.&lt;ref name=AU/&gt;&lt;ref name=UK/&gt;&lt;ref name=US/&gt; Examples include [[spinach]], [[carrot]]s, [[onion]]s, and [[broccoli]].
* '''[[Drinking water|Water]]''' is treated in very different ways by different food guides. Some exclude the category,&lt;ref name=US/&gt; others list it separately from other food groups,&lt;ref name=AU/&gt; and yet others make it the center&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eine runde Sache: Der neue DGE-Ernährungskreis|url=http://www.dge.de/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=219|work=Deutsche Gesellschaft für Ernährung|accessdate=11 June 2011|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; or foundation&lt;ref name=UM&gt;{{cite web|title=Healing Foods Pyramid™ 2010|url=http://www.med.umich.edu/umim/food-pyramid/|work=University of Michigan Health System|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the guide.

==Uncommon food groups==
The number of "common" food groups varies depending on who is defining them. [[Canada's Food Guide]], which has been in continual publication since 1942 and is the second most requested government document (after the income tax form) in [[Canada]], recognizes only four official food groups, listing the remainder of foods as "another". Some of these "others" include:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18294">{{About|homogenization of climate data|other meanings of homogenization, homogeneity, and related words|Homogeneity (disambiguation)}}

'''Homogenization''' in [[Climatology|climate research]] means the removal of non-climatic changes. Next to [[Climate change|changes in the climate]] itself, raw climate records also contain non-climatic jumps  and changes for example due to relocations or changes in instrumentation. The most used principle to remove these inhomogeneities is the relative homogenization approach in which a candidate [[Weather station|stations]] is compared to a reference time series based on one or more neighboring stations. The candidate and reference station(s) experience about the same climate, non-climatic changes that happen only in one station can thus be identified and removed.

==Climate observations==
To study climate change and variability long instrumental climate records are essential, but are best not used directly. These datasets are essential since they are the basis for assessing century-scale trends or for studying the natural (long-term) variability of climate, amongst others. The value of these datasets, however, strongly depends on the homogeneity of the underlying time series. A homogeneous climate record is one where variations are caused only by variations in weather and climate. Long instrumental records are rarely, if ever homogeneous.

Results from the homogenization of instrumental western climate records indicate that detected inhomogeneities in mean temperature series occur at a frequency of roughly 15 to 20 years.&lt;ref name="aueretal2007"&gt;Auer, I., R. Bohm, A. Jurkovic, W. Lipa, A. Orlik, R. Potzmann, W. Schoner, M. Ungersbock, C. Matulla, P. Jones, D. Efthymiadis, M. Brunetti, T. Nanni, K. Briffa, M. Maugeri, L. Mercalli, O. Mestre, et al.

M., Collins, D., and Braganza, K.: "Updating Australia’s high quality annual temperature dataset". ''Austr. Meteor. Mag.'', 53, 277-292, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;
It should be kept in mind that most measurements have not been specifically made for climatic purposes, but rather to meet the needs of weather forecasting, agriculture and hydrology.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, C. N. jr., Menne, M. J., [[Peter Thorne (climatologist)|Thorne, P.W.]] "Benchmarking the performance of pairwise homogenization of surface temperatures in the United States. Journal of Geophysical Research-Atmospheres", 117, D5, {{doi|10.1029/2011JD016761}}, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the typical size of the breaks is often of the same order as the climatic change signal during the 20th century.&lt;ref name="aueretal2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="menne2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="brunettietal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="caussinus_mestre" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dellamarta" /&gt;
Inhomogeneities are thus a significant source of uncertainty for the estimation of secular trends and decadal-scale variability.

If all inhomogeneities would be purely random perturbations of the climate records, collectively their effect on the mean global climate signal would be negligible. However, certain changes are typical for certain periods and occurred in many stations, these are the most important causes as they can collectively lead to artificial biases in climate trends across large regions.

''Int. J. Climatol.'', {{doi|10.1002/joc.1118}}, 25, 65–80, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes of inhomogeneities==
[[Image:HeatIsland Kanto en.png|thumb|300px|[[Tokyo]], an example of an urban heat island. Normal temperatures of Tokyo go up more than those of the surrounding area.]]

The best known inhomogeneity is the [[Urban heat island#Global warming|urban heat island effect]]. The temperature in cities can be warmer than in the surrounding country side, especially at night. Thus as cities grow, one may expect that temperatures measured in cities become higher. On the other hand, with the advent of aviation, many meteorological offices and thus their [[Weather station|stations]] have often been relocated from cities to nearby, typically cooler, airports.&lt;ref name="trewin"&gt;Trewin, B.: "Exposure, instrumentation, and observing practice effects on land temperature measurements".'' WIREs Clim. Change'', 1, 490–506, {{doi|10.1002/wcc.46}}, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Stevenson screen exterior.JPG|thumb|Exterior of a Stevenson screen]]
Other non-climatic changes can be caused by changes in measurement methods. Meteorological instruments are typically installed in a screen to protect them from direct sun and wetting.&lt;ref&gt;Meulen, van der, J.P. and T. Brandsma. "Thermometer screen intercomparison in De Bilt (The Netherlands), part I: Understanding the weather-dependent temperature differences". ''Int. J. Climatol.'', {{doi|10.1002/joc.1531}}, 28, 371-387, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 19th century it was common to use a metal screen in front of a window on a North facing wall. However, the building may warm the screen leading to higher temperature measurements. When this problem was realized the [[Stevenson screen]] was introduced, typically installed in gardens, away from buildings. This is still the most typical weather screen with its characteristic [[Louver|double-louvre]] door and walls for ventilation. The historical Montsouri and Wilds screens were used around 1900 and are open to the North and to the bottom. This improves ventilation, but it was found that infra-red radiation from the ground can influence the measurement on sunny calm days. Therefore, they are no longer used. Nowadays [[automatic weather station]]s, which reduce labor costs, are becoming more common; they protect the thermometer by a number of white plastic cones.&lt;ref name="begert" /&gt; This necessitated changes from manually recorded liquid and glass thermometers to automated electrical resistance thermometers, which reduced the recorded temperature values in the USA.&lt;ref name="menne2009" /&gt;

Also other climate elements suffer from inhomogeneities. The precipitation amounts observed in the early instrumental period, roughly before 1900, are biased and are 10% lower than nowadays because the 
[[Rain gauge|precipitation measurements]] were often made on a roof. At the time, instruments were installed on rooftops to ensure that the instrument is never shielded from the rain, but it was found later that due to the turbulent flow of the wind on roofs, some rain droplets and especially snow flakes did not fall into the opening. Consequently, measurements are nowadays performed closer to the ground.

Other typical causes of inhomogeneities are a change in measurement location; many observations, especially of precipitation are performed by volunteers in their garden or at their work place. Changes in the surrounding can often not be avoided, e.g., changes in the vegetation, the [[Impervious surface|sealing of the land surface]], and warm and sheltering buildings in the vicinity. There are also changes in measurement procedures such as the way the daily mean temperature is computed (by means of the minimum and maximum temperatures, or by averaging over 3 or 4 readings per day, or based on 10-minute data). Also changes in the observation times can lead to inhomogeneities. A recent review by Trewin focused on the causes of inhomogeneities.&lt;ref name="trewin" /&gt;

The inhomogeneities are not always errors. This is seen most clear for stations affected by warming due to the urban heat island effect. From the perspective of global warming, such local effects are undesirable, but to study the influence of climate on health such measurements are fine. Other inhomogeneities are due to compromises that have to be made between ventilation and protection against the sun and wetting in the design of a weather shelter. Trying to reduce one type of error (for a certain weather condition) in the design will often lead to the more errors from the other factors. Meteorological measurements are not made in the laboratory. Small errors are inevitable and may not be relevant for meteorological purposes, but if such an error changes, it may well be an inhomogeneity for climatology.

==Homogenization==
To reliably study the real development of the climate, non-climatic changes have to be removed. The date of the change is often documented (called meta data: data about data), but not always. Meta data is often only available in the local language. In the best case, there are parallel measurements with the original and the new set-up for several years.&lt;ref&gt;Aguilar E., Auer, I., Brunet, M., Peterson, T. C., and Wieringa, J.: [http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/wcp/wcdmp/wcdmp_series/documents/WCDMP-53.pdf ''Guidelines on climate metadata and homogenization'']. World Meteorological Organization, WMO-TD No. 1186, WCDMP No. 53, Geneva, Switzerland, 55 p., 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; 
This is a WMO ([[World Meteorological Organisation]]) guideline, but parallel measurements are unfortunately not very often performed, if only because the reason for stopping the original measurement is not known in advance, but probably more often to save money. By making parallel measurement with replicas of historical instruments, screens, etc. some of these inhomogeneities can still be studied today.
[[File:Centre for Climate Change (C3) Terragona, weather screen intercomparison study.JPG|thumb|upright=1.8|One way to study the influence of changes in measurement techniques is by making simultaneous measurements with historical and current instruments, procedures or screens. This picture shows three meteorological shelters next to each other in Murcia (Spain). The rightmost shelter is a replica of the Montsouri screen, in use in Spain and many European countries in the late 19th century and early 20th century. In the middle, Stevenson screen equipped with automatic sensors. Leftmost, Stevenson screen equipped with conventional meteorological instruments.]]

Because you are never sure that your meta data (station history) is complete, statistical homogenization should always be applied as well. The most commonly used statistical principle to detect and remove the effects of artificial changes is relative homogenization, which assumes that nearby stations are exposed to almost the same climate signal and that thus the differences between nearby stations can be utilized to detect inhomogeneities.&lt;ref&gt;Conrad, V. and Pollak, C.: [https://archive.org/details/methodsinclimato032726mbp ''Methods in Climatology'']. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA, 459 p., 1950.&lt;/ref&gt; 
By looking at the difference time series, the year-to-year variability of the climate is removed, as well as regional climatic trends. In such a difference time series, a clear and persistent jump of, for example 1&amp;nbsp;°C, can easily be detected and can only be due to changes in the measurement conditions.

If there is a jump (break) in a difference time series, it is not yet clear which of the two stations it belongs to. Furthermore, time series typically have more than just one jump. These two features make statistical homogenization a challenging and beautiful statistical problem. Homogenization algorithms typically differ in how they try to solve these two fundamental problems.&lt;ref name="venemaetal"&gt;Venema, V., O. Mestre, E. Aguilar, I. Auer, J.A. Guijarro, P. Domonkos, G. Vertacnik, T. Szentimrey, P. Stepanek, P. Zahradnicek, J. Viarre, G. Müller-Westermeier, M. Lakatos, C.N. Williams,

P. Esteban, Th. Brandsma. [http://www.clim-past.net/8/89/2012/ "Benchmarking homogenization algorithms for monthly data"]. ''Climate of the Past'', '''8''', 89-115, {{doi|10.5194/cp-8-89-2012}}, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, it was customary to compute a composite reference time series computed from multiple nearby stations, compare this reference to the candidate series and assume that any jumps found are due to the candidate series.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandersson, A.: "A homogeneity test applied to precipitation data". ''J. Climatol.'', {{doi|10.1002/joc.3370060607}}, 6, 661-675, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter assumption works because by using multiple stations as reference, the influence of inhomogeneities on the reference are much reduced. However, modern algorithms, no longer assume that the reference is homogeneous and can achieve better results this way. There are two main ways to do so. You can compute multiple composite reference time series from subsets of surrounding stations and test these references for homogeneity as well.

Alternatively, you can only use pairs of stations and by comparing all pairs with each other determine which station most likely is the one with the break.&lt;ref name="caussinus_mestre" /&gt; If there is a break in 1950 in pair A&amp;amp;B and B&amp;amp;C, but not in A&amp;amp;C, the break is likely in station B; with more pairs such an inference can be made with more certainty.

If there are multiple breaks in a time series, the number of combinations easily becomes very large and it is becomes impossible to try them all. For example, in case of five breaks (''k''=5) in 100 years of annual data (''n''=100), the number of combinations is about 100&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;=10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; or 10 billion. This problem is sometimes solved iteratively/hierarchically, by first searching for the largest jump and then repeating the search in both sub-sections until they are too small. This does not always produce good results. A direct way to solve the problem is by an efficient optimization method called [[dynamic programming]].

Sometimes there are no other stations in the same climate region. In this case, sometimes absolute homogenization is applied and the inhomogeneities are detected in the time series of one station. If there is a clear and large break at a certain date, you may well be able to correct it, but smaller jumps and gradually occurring inhomogeneities (urban heat island or a growing vegetation) cannot be distinguished from real natural variability and climate change. Data homogenized this way does not have the quality you may expect and should be used with much care.

==Inhomogeneities in climate data==
By homogenizing climate datasets, it was found that sometimes inhomogeneities can cause biased trends in raw data; that homogenization is indispensable to obtain reliable regional or global trends. For example, for the Greater Alpine Region a bias in the temperature trend between the 1870s and 1980s of half a degree was found, which was due to ''decreasing urbanization'' of the network and systematic changes in the time of observation.&lt;ref&gt;Böhm R., Auer, I., Brunetti, M., Maugeri, M., Nanni, T., and Schöner, W.: "Regional temperature variability in the European Alps 1760–1998 from homogenized instrumental time series". ''International Journal of Climatology'', {{doi|10.1002/joc.689}}, 21, pp. 1779–1801, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;
The precipitation records of the early instrumental period are biased by -10% due to the systematic higher installation of the gauges at the time.&lt;ref name="aueretal2005"&gt;Auer I, Böhm, R., Jurkovic, A., Orlik, A., Potzmann, R., Schöner W., et al.: A new instrumental precipitation dataset for the Greater Alpine Region for the period 1800–2002. International Journal of Climatology,  {{doi|10.1002/joc.1135}}, 25, 139–166, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
Other possible bias sources are new types of weather shelters&lt;ref name="brunettietal" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brunet, M., Asin, J., Sigró, J., Banón, M., García, F., Aguilar, E., Esteban Palenzuela, J., Peterson, T. C., and Jones, P.: "The minimization of the screen bias from ancient Western Mediterranean air temperature 
records: an exploratory statistical analysis". ''Int. J. Climatol.'', {{doi|10.1002/joc.2192}}, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; the change from liquid and glass thermometers to electrical resistance thermometers,&lt;ref name="menne2009" /&gt; as well as the tendency to replace observers by automatic weather stations,&lt;ref name="begert" /&gt; the urban heat island effect and the transfer of many urban stations to airports.&lt;ref name="trewin" /&gt;

In the project HOME homogenization algorithms were recently tested on artificial climate data with known inhomogeneities and it was found that relative homogenization improves temperature records and that the modern methods that do not work with a homogeneous reference are most accurate.&lt;ref name="venemaetal" /&gt;

In [[parasitology]] and [[epidemiology]], a '''host switch''' (or '''host shift''') is an evolutionary change of host specificity. All [[symbiotic]] species, such as [[parasites]], [[pathogens]] and [[mutualists]] exhibit a certain degree of host specificity. They occur in the body (or on the body surface) of a single host species or – more often – on a limited set of host species. In the latter case, the suitable host species tend to be taxonomically related, sharing similar morphology and physiology.&lt;ref&gt;Poulin, R. (2006) [http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8336.html Evolutionary Ecology of Parasites] ''Princeton University Press''&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the [[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]] used to occur in non-human primates in West-central Africa, and have switched to humans in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name=Orgin2011&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sharp PM, Hahn BH | title = Origins of HIV and the AIDS Pandemic | journal = Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in medicine | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = a006841 | year = 2011 | pmid = 22229120 | pmc = 3234451 | doi = 10.1101/cshperspect.a006841 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Faria2014&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Faria NR, Rambaut A, Suchard MA, Baele G, Bedford T, Ward MJ, Tatem AJ, Sousa JD, Arinaminpathy N, Pépin J, Posada D, Peeters M, Pybus OG, Lemey P | title = The early spread and epidemic ignition of HIV-1 in human populations | journal = Science | volume = 346 | issue = 6205 | pages = 56–61 | year = 2014 | doi = 10.1126/science.1256739 | pmid=25278604 | pmc=4254776}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Second, the human louse duplicated into two forms, the [[Head louse]] and [[Body louse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Reed DL, Light JE, Allen JM, Kirchman JJ |year=2007|title=Pair of lice lost or parasites regained: the evolutionary history of anthropoid primate lice |journal=[[BMC Biology]] |volume=5 |page=7 |doi=10.1186/1741-7007-5-7 |pmid=17343749 |pmc=1828715 |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/7}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[File:Switch&amp;shift.png|thumb|A host area (green) withdrawing in the South and advancing forward in the North. Cylinders represent host populations with a stable or changing population size. Parasite populations are represented by red arrows. Host switch more often occurs targeting host populations of increasing size, such as the pioneer populations of an [[invasive species]] (above). Contrarily, host shift more often occurs to move away from shrinking host populations, such as [[Relict (biology)|relict]] populations left behind by a regressing host area (below).&lt;ref name=chapter2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name=FB-EE /&gt;]]

Recent studies proposed to discriminate between two different types of evolutionary changes in host specificity.&lt;ref name=chapter2015&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Rozsa|first1=L|last2=Tryjanowski|first2=P |last3=Vas|first3=Z|year=2015|chapter-url=http://www.zoologia.hu/list/chapter4.pdf|chapter= Under the changing climate: how shifting geographic distributions and sexual selection shape parasite diversification|title=Parasite diversity and diversification: evolutionary ecology meets phylogenetics|editor=Morand S |editor2=Krasnov B |editor3=Littlewood T (eds.) |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9781107037656|pages=58–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FB-EE&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Forró B, Eszterbauer E | url=http://folia.paru.cas.cz/pdfs/fol/2016/01/19.pdf | title = Correlation between host specificity and genetic diversity for the muscle-dwelling fish parasite Myxobolus pseudodispar: examples of myxozoan host-shift? | journal = Folia Parasitologica | volume = 63 | pages = 019 | year = 2016 | doi = 10.14411/fp.2016.019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to this view, host switch is a sudden and accidental colonization of a new host species by a few parasite individuals that are capable to establish a new and viable population there. After the switch, the new population is more-or-less isolated from the parasite population on the donor host species. It does not affect the further fate of the conspecific parasites on the donor host, and it may finally lead to parasite speciation. It is more likely to target an increasing host population that harbours a relatively poor parasite/pathogen fauna, such as the pioneer populations of invasive species.

Contrarily, host-shift is a gradual change of the relative role of a particular host species as primary versus secondary host, in case of a multi-host parasite species. The former primary host slowly becomes a secondary host or even becomes totally abandoned, while the former secondary host becomes a new primary host species. This process is slower and more predictable, and it does not increase parasite diversity. Predictably, it more often occurs in shrinking host populations that harbours a relatively (considering the small host population size) rich parasite/pathogen fauna.

NASA's IV&amp;V Program was established in 1993 as part of an Agency-wide strategy to provide the highest achievable levels of safety and cost-effectiveness for mission critical software. NASA's IV&amp;V Program was founded under the [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/codeq/ NASA Office of Safety and Mission Assurance (OSMA)] as a direct result of recommendations made by the National Research Council (NRC) and the Report of the Presidential Commission on the [https://history.nasa.gov/sts51l.html Space Shuttle Challenger Accident].

Since then, NASA's IV&amp;V Program has experienced growth in personnel, projects, capabilities, and accomplishments. NASA IV&amp;V efforts have contributed to NASA's improved safety record since the program's inception. Today, [[Independent Verification and Validation]] (IV&amp;V) is an Agency-level function, delegated from OSMA to Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) and managed by NASA IV&amp;V. NASA's IV&amp;V Program's primary business, software IV&amp;V, is sponsored by OSMA as a software assurance technology. Having been reassigned as GSFC, NASA IV&amp;V is Code 180 (Center Director's direct report).

NASA's IV&amp;V Program houses approximately 270 employees and leverages the expertise of in-house partners and contractors. Its facilities are located in [[Fairmont, West Virginia]]. In the summer, high school and college interns are employed in addition.

== Affiliations ==
NASA's IV&amp;V Program is affiliated with [[NASA Goddard Space Flight Center]] (GSFC) and the ERC is part of a nationwide network of training sites at NASA centers and facilities.

== Projects ==
NASA's IV&amp;V Program is the lead NASA organization for system software IV&amp;V, and is responsible for the management of all system software IV&amp;V efforts within the Agency. NASA's IV&amp;V Program's role is to provide value-added service to the Agency's system software projects, primarily by appropriately performing IV&amp;V on system software based on the cost, size, complexity, life span, risk, and consequences of failure.

NASA's IV&amp;V Program also provides independent technical assessments of NASA systems and software processes/products to identify developmental and operational risks. This effort helps to provide assurance that safe and reliable software is being provided to NASA missions and projects as they work toward successful systems and software development. Independent assessments can address any aspect of software engineering and can be applied within any SDLC phase. This capability provides for multiple spot-checking throughout the SDLC and addresses those issues that can jeopardize mission safety and quality.

== Educator Resource Center ==
Thanks to a grant with [[Fairmont State University]], the [https://web.archive.org/web/20120612114223/http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ivv/education/erc_index.html Independent Verification and Validation Program Educator Resource Center] (ERC) provides resources and training opportunities for approximately 1,000 in-service, pre-service, and informal educators and in West Virginia annually. The materials and training cover a wide range of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) topics. The ERC also loans hands-on STEM kits to trained teachers which impact over 10,000 students per year in the state.  The on-site student outreach program brings over 2,000 youth to the facility annually to experience workshops on robotics, rocketry, aviation, and other STEM topics.  The ERC also runs numerous student STEM competitions in the fields of robotics and aviation.  Starting in 2012 the ERC became the partner for the FIRST LEGO League competition and has overseen a rapid growth in [http://WVRoboticsAlliance.org robotic competitions] that now include over 100 teams at 10 tournaments statewide each fall.

'''Industrial waste''' is the waste produced by industrial activity which includes any material that is rendered useless during a manufacturing process such as that of [[factories]], industries, mills, and mining operations. It has existed since the start of the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Maczulak |first=Anne Elizabeth |year=2010 |title=Pollution: Treating Environmental Toxins |url= |location=New York |publisher=Infobase Publishing |page=120 |isbn=9781438126333}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of industrial wastes are [[chemical solvent]]s, pigments, sludge, metals, ash, paints, sandpaper, paper products, industrial [[by-products]], and [[radioactive wastes]].

[[Toxic waste]], [[chemical waste]], industrial solid waste and [[municipal solid waste]] are designations of industrial wastes. [[Sewage treatment]] plants can treat some industrial wastes, i.e. those consisting of [[conventional pollutant]]s such as [[biochemical oxygen demand]] (BOD). Industrial wastes containing [[toxic]] pollutants require specialized treatment systems. (''See'' [[Industrial wastewater treatment]]).&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, DC (2011). [http://www.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/pretreatment_program_intro_2011.pdf "Introduction to the National Pretreatment Program"] Document no. EPA-833-B-11-001. pp. 1-1, 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental Impact ==
Production sites are commonly located near bodies of water due to industrial dependence on large amounts of water as an input. Many areas that are becoming industrialized do not yet have the resources or technology to dispose of waste with lesser effects on the environment. Both untreated and partially treated wastewater are commonly fed back into a near lying body of water. Metals, chemicals and sewage released into bodies of water directly affect marine ecosystems and the health of those who depend on the waters as food or drinking water sources. Toxins from the wastewater can kill off marine life or cause varying degrees of illness to those who consume these marine animals, depending on the contaminant. Metals and chemicals released into bodies of water affect the [[Marine ecosystem|marine ecosystems]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wastes in Marine Environments|last=U.S. Congress|first=Office of Technology’ Assessment|publisher=Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office|year=1987|isbn=|location=Washington, DC|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wastewater containing nitrates and phosphates often causes [[Eutrophication]] which can kill off existing life in the water. A Thailand study focusing on water pollution origins found that the highest concentrations of water contamination in the U-tapao river had a direct correlation to industrial wastewater. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gyawali at al.|first=|date=2012|title=Effects of Industrial Waste Disposal on the Surface Water Quality of U-tapao River, Thailand|url=http://www.ipcbee.com/vol32/019-ICESE2012-D10030.pdf|journal=2012 International Conference on Environment Science and Engieering|volume=32|pages=5|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Management==

===In Thailand===
{{Main|Industrial waste management in Thailand}}

In [[Thailand]] the roles in [[Municipal solid waste|Municipal solid waste (MSW)]] management and industrial waste management are organized by the Royal Thai Government, which is then divided into central government, regional government, and local government. Each government is responsible for different tasks. The central government is responsible for stimulating regulation, policies, and standards. The regional governments are responsible for coordinating the central and local governments. The local governments are responsible for waste management in their governed area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jiaranaikhajorn|first1=Taweechai|title=Waste and Hazardous Substances Management Bureau|url=http://infofile.pcd.go.th/mgt/Overview_waste.pdf?CFID=818746&amp;CFTOKEN=13734972|publisher=Pollution Control Department (PCD), THAILAND|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the local governments do not dispose of the waste by themselves but instead hire private companies that have been granted the right from the Pollution Control Department (PCD) in Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pollution Control Department (PCD) Statement, THAILAND|url=http://www.pcd.go.th/about/en_ab_mission.html|publisher=Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111161400/http://www.pcd.go.th/about/en_ab_mission.html|archivedate=2014-11-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main companies are Bangpoo Industrial Waste Management Center,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Visvanathan|first1=C.|title=Hazardous and Industrial Solid Waste Management in Thailand - an Overview|url=http://www.jgsee.kmutt.ac.th/jgsee1/NewsEvents/Seminar/ISSOWAMA/Visvanathan_Presentation.pdf|website=www.faculty.ait.ac.th/visu/|publisher=Asian Institute of Technology Thailand|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; General Environmental Conservation Public Company Limited (GENCO),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Genco Background|url=http://www.genco.co.th/EN-About.htm|publisher=General Environment Conservation Public Company Limited (GENCO)|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; SGS Thailand,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About SGS|url=http://www.sgs.co.th/en/Our-Company/About-SGS/Sponsorship.aspx|publisher=SGS (Thailand) Limited|accessdate=22 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111172910/http://www.sgs.co.th/en/Our-Company/About-SGS/Sponsorship.aspx|archivedate=11 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waste Management Siam LTD (WMS),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Waste Management Siam LTD.

===In the United States===
{{main|Solid waste policy in the United States}}
The 1976 [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] (RCRA) provides for federal regulation of waste while allowing for individual state control through [[EPA]] approved waste disposal programs.

State compliance is monitored by EPA inspections. In the case that waste management guideline standards are not met, action against the site will be taken.

Hazardous waste is monitored in a [[cradle to grave]] fashion.The EPA now manages 2.96 million tons of solid, hazardous and industrial waste. Since establishment, the RCRA has undergone reforms as inefficiencies arise and as waste management evolves. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Image:ILL Grenoble soleil.jpg|thumb|right|Institut Laue-Langevin]]
[[File:ILL members map.svg|thumb|right|ILL members]]
The '''Institut Laue–Langevin''' ('''ILL''') is an internationally financed scientific facility, situated on the [[Polygone Scientifique]] in [[Grenoble]], [[France]]. It is one of the world centres for research using [[neutron]]s. Founded in 1967 and honouring the [[physicist]]s [[Max von Laue]] and [[Paul Langevin]], the ILL provides one of the most intense neutron sources in the world and the most intense continuous neutron flux in the world in the moderator region: 1.5×10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; neutrons per second per cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, with a thermal power of 58.3&amp;nbsp;MW. 

The ILL neutron scattering facilities provide an indispensable analytical tool for the analysis of the structure of novel conducting and magnetic materials for future electronic devices, the measurement of stresses in mechanical materials, and investigations into how complex molecular assemblies behave, particularly in a biological environment. The ILL also tackles questions relating to the fundamental properties of matter.

== History ==
[[Image:Institut Laue Langevin inside reactor hall.jpg|thumb|right|Inside the reactor hall]]
The institute was founded by [[France]] and [[Germany]], with the [[United Kingdom]] becoming the third major partner in 1973. These partner states provide, through [[UK Research Councils|Research Councils]], the bulk of its funding. Ten other countries have since become partners. Scientists of institutions in the member states may apply to use the ILL facilities, and may invite scientists from other countries to participate. Experimental time is allocated by a scientific council involving ILL users. The use of the facility and travel costs for researchers are paid for by the institute. Commercial use, for which a fee is charged, is not subject to the scientific council review process. Over 750 experiments are completed every year, in fields including [[magnetism]], [[superconductivity]], [[materials engineering]], and the study of [[liquid]]s, [[colloid]]s and biological substances. 

The high-flux [[research reactor]] produces neutrons through fission in a specially designed, compact-core fuel element.  [[Neutron moderators]] cool the neutrons to useful wavelengths, which are then directed at a suite of instruments and used to probe the structure and behaviour of many forms of matter by elastic and inelastic [[neutron scattering]], and to probe the fundamental physical properties of the [[neutron]].  Nothing goes to waste: [[Fission products]] and [[gamma rays]] produced by nuclear reactions in the reactor core are also used by specialised instruments, which forms an important part of the instrument suite.

An ambitious modernisation programme was launched in 2000, through the design of new neutron infrastructure and the introduction of new instruments and instrument upgrades. The first phase has already resulted in 17-fold gains in performance. The second phase has started in 2008, it comprises the building of 5 new instruments, the upgrade of 4 others, and the installation of 3 new neutron guides.

== EPN Science Campus ==
{{Science with neutrons}}
The ILL shares its site, the 'epn science campus',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epn-campus.eu/ epn-campus.eu]&lt;/ref&gt; with other institutions including the [[European Synchrotron Radiation Facility]] (ESRF) and the [[European Molecular Biology Laboratory]] (EMBL) and the [[Unit for Viral Host Cell Interactions]] (UVHCI). The French Institut de Biologie Structurale (IBS) has joined the campus in 2013.

== Members ==
The ILL is governed by its Associates, the founding countries:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An international partnership for science|url=http://www.ill.eu/about/what-is-the-ill/an-international-partnership/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[France]], [[Germany]] and [[United Kingdom]]
in association with its Scientific Member countries (listed below by chronological order of accession):
*[[Spain]], [[Switzerland]], [[Austria]], [[Italy]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Sweden]], [[Belgium]], [[Slovakia]], [[Poland]] and [[Denmark]].

== Applications research ==
In summer 2016, using an imaging technique neutron radiation, the facilities of the Institut Laue–Langevin demonstrate that a molecule called ectoine is used by [[Halomonas titanicae]] near the wreck of [[RMS Titanic]] to survive the osmotic pressure that salt water causes on their membranes. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laboratoryequipment.com/news/2016/09/extremophile-bacteria-will-eat-away-wreck-titanic-2030 laboratoryequipment.com, September 6, 2016, Extremophile Bacteria’ Will Eat Away Wreck of the Titanic by 2030.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards and recognitions ==
The physicist [[Duncan Haldane]] who worked at the institute from 1977 to 1981 received the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 2016 with [[Michael Kosterlitz]] and [[David J. Thouless]] for their work on the transitions of topological phases in the material.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/05/science/nobel-prize-physics-topology.html nytimes October 4, 2016, 3 Who Studied Unusual States of Matter Win Nobel Prize in Physics.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ill.eu/fr/presse-et-infos/infos/congratulations-to-the-2016-nobel-prize-laureates/ ill.eu October 4, 2016, Congratulations to the 2016 Physics Nobel Prize laureates !]
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Physically interactive computing - MIT.jpg|thumb|300px|[http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/362248 Physically interactive computing - MIT] ]]
In [[computer science]], '''interactive computing''' refers to [[software]] which accepts [[Input (computer science)|input]] from humans as it runs. Interactive software includes most popular programs, such as [[word processor]]s or [[spreadsheet]] [[application software|applications]]. By comparison, noninteractive programs operate without human contact; examples of these include [[compiler]]s and [[batch processing]] applications.

Interactive computing focuses on real-time interaction ("dialog") between computers and people, and the technologies that enable this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://beki70.wordpress.com/2011/01/27/what-is-interactive-computing/|title=What is Interactive Computing?|website=Beki's Blog|access-date=2016-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the response of the computer system is complex enough, it is said that the system is conducting [[social]] interaction; some systems try to achieve this through the implementation of [[social interface]]s.

== History of interactive computing systems ==
[[Ivan Sutherland]] is considered the Father of Interactive Computing for his work on [[Sketchpad]], the interactive display graphics program he developed in 1963.  He later worked at the ARPA Information Processing Techniques Office under the direction of [[J. C. R. Licklider|J.C.R. Licklider]].  There he facilitated ARPA's research grant to [[Douglas Engelbart]] for developing the [http://www.dougengelbart.org/about/augment.html NLS] system at SRI based on his visionary manifesto published in a [http://www.dougengelbart.org/firsts/interactive-computing.html#Ref-1962-Report 1962 Report], in which Engelbart envisioned interactive computing as a vehicle for human interaction with computers, with each other, and with their knowledge, all in a vast virtual information space.  In a [http://www.dougengelbart.org/firsts/interactive-computing.html#Ref-1965-Report 1965 Report] he published his early experiments with pointing devices, including the mouse, for composing and editing on interactive display workstations. Engelbart's work on interactive computing at SRI migrated directly to Xerox PARC, from there to Apple, and out into the mainstream. Thus, the tree of evolution for interactive computing generally traces back to Engelbart's lab at SRI.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dougengelbart.org/firsts/interactive-computing.html|title=Interactive Computing - Doug Engelbart Institute|last=Administrator|website=www.dougengelbart.org|access-date=2016-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2008, on the 40th anniversary of his 1968 demo, SRI sponsored the public commemorative event [http://www.dougengelbart.org/events/40th.html Engelbart and the Dawn of Interactive Computing] in his honor.

Some common computing systems previously were:
* Batch interfaces 
* Conversational interfaces
* Graphical interfaces

== Later examples ==
'''[http://tangible.media.mit.edu/project/inform/ inFORM]''' is a Dynamic Shape Display that can render 3D content physically, so users can interact with digital information in a tangible way. inFORM can also interact with the physical world around it, for example moving objects on the table’s surface. Remote participants in a video conference can be displayed physically, allowing for a strong sense of presence and the ability to interact physically at a distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tangible.media.mit.edu/vision/|title=Tangible Media Group|website=tangible.media.mit.edu|access-date=2016-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-11/13/inform-shape-shifting-display|title=MIT researchers develop InForm, a shape-shifting display surface (Wired UK)|website=Wired UK|access-date=2016-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''[[Sprout (computer)|HP Sprout]]''' released at the end of the 2014 by HP Inc is a projector-camera (pro-cam) system that enables users to interact with physical and digital content while working.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2878427/hands-on-with-the-hp-sprout-an-imaging-powerhouse-built-into-a-touch-friendly-pc.html|title=Hands-on with the HP Sprout, an imaging powerhouse built into a touch-friendly PC|website=PCWorld|access-date=2016-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:HP Sprout.jpg|thumb|none]]

== Tools ==
[[IPython]] provides a rich architecture for interactive computing [https://ipython.org/ IPython] with:
* A powerful interactive shell.
* A kernel for [https://jupyter.org/ Jupyter].
* Support for interactive data visualization and use of [http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/interactive/reference.html#gui-event-loop-support GUI toolkits].
* Flexible, [http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/interactive/reference.html#embedding-ipython embeddable] interpreters to load into your own projects.
* Easy to use, high performance tools for [http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/parallel/parallel_intro.html parallel computing].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perez|first=F.|last2=Granger|first2=B.

== Current research ==
The need of constant user interaction in interactive computing systems makes it different in many ways from [[batch processing]] systems. Thus different aspects of computing systems are significantly different for interactive computing systems and they have been focused on different research. The design of a different programming model has been discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perera|first=Roly|date=2008-05-14|title=Programming Languages For Interactive Computing|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1571066108003009|journal=Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science|series=Proceedings of the Workshop on the Foundations of Interactive Computation (FInCo 2007)|volume=203|issue=3|pages=35–52|doi=10.1016/j.entcs.2008.04.085}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another article describes the importance of security and reliability in interactive computing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-46766-1_31|title=Foundations of Secure Interactive Computing|last=Beaver|first=Donald|date=1991-08-11|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783540551881|editor-last=Feigenbaum|editor-first=Joan|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|pages=377–391|language=en|doi=10.1007/3-540-46766-1_31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nature of interactive computing as well as its impact on humans are studied extensively in the field of [[human-computer interaction]].

Georgia Institute of Technology has a [[Georgia Institute of Technology School of Interactive Computing|school]] named [http://www.ic.gatech.edu/ School of Interactive Computing] which has formed in 2007. It is still active and offering masters and doctoral degree by collaborations of more than 40 faculties.

The [http://tangible.media.mit.edu/ Tangible Media Group] of [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], led by Professor Hiroshi Ishii, explores the Tangible Bits &amp; Radical Atoms visions to seamlessly couple the dual world of bits and atoms by giving dynamic physical form to digital information and computation.

== The genre of invective ==
The "genre of invective" or "invective (genre)" or "''vituperatio''" in Latin is a form of classical libel used in [[Greek literature|Greek]] and [[Latin literature|Roman]] polemical verse as well as in prose, but its primary context is rhetoric.

The rhetorical genre of ''vituperatio'' belongs to the ''genus demonstrativum'', which is composed by the praise and blame.

During the Roman Republic, personal invectives and character assassination were widely used during the forensic speeches as well as orations. Cicero made a large use of the invectives against his political foes such as Clodius, Catilina (Catilinarian speeches) or Mark Antony (Philippics). The commonly charges are avarice, cupidity, cowardice, effeminacy, drunkenness, low writing and speaking skills, luxury, disapproved sexual habits, tyrannical behaviour, etc.

Between 44 BC and 30 BC, the invective became a tool during the propaganda war between Octavian and Mark Antony&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Le conflit propagandiste entre Octavien et Marc Antoine. De l'usage politique de la uituperatio entre 44 et 30 a. C. n.|last=Borgies|first=Loïc|publisher=Latomus|year=2016|isbn=978-90-429-3459-7|location=Brussels|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Among many other slanders, Mark Antony was accused to have married a foreign queen Cleopatra, to be the submissive subject of her and to have lose his Roman identity. According to this propaganda, Cleopatra would plan to invade Italia. This propaganda before the battle of Actium in 31 BC permits to Octavian to present his campaign as a legitimate war for the safe of the Roman Republic.

The preferred literary term for invective of the [[Renaissance]] is [[Libel (poetry)|libel]].

'''Izidor (Iso) Kršnjavi''' ({{IPA-sh|krʃɲǎːʋi ǐzidor|hr}}, 22 April 1845 – 3 February 1927) was a [[Croats|Croatian]] painter, art historian, curator and politician.

==Biography==
Born in [[Našice]], his first art lessons were obtained in [[Osijek]], where he studied with [[Hugo Conrad von Hötzendorf]].&lt;ref name="GLN"&gt;[http://www.galerija-lavalnugent.com/krsnjavi-izidor-1845-1924 Galerija Laval Nugent: Izidor Kršnjavi]&lt;/ref&gt; He then went to Vienna to study philosophy and [[art history]]. At this time, he was already providing aesthetic and philosophical articles to Croatian journals. He later studied at the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich]] and lived in Italy from 1872–77, where he copied the old masters.

With the help of [[Josip Juraj Strossmayer]], who he had met in Rome, he became a professor of archaeology and art history at the [[University of Zagreb]]. The next year, he helped establish the Society of Arts, and was, for many years, it secretary and spokesman. He also served as the first Director of the [[Strossmayer Gallery of Old Masters]] and was one of the founders of the [[Museum of Arts and Crafts, Zagreb|Museum of Arts and Crafts]].&lt;ref name="GLN" /&gt;

In 1884, he came into conflict with Strossmayer and his supporters in the [[People's Party (Kingdom of Croatia)|People's Party]], where he supported the pro-Hungarian faction, which allowed him to serve in the Croatian Parliament 1884-87. From 1887 to 1891, he studied law and became the Minister of Education and Religion in the [[Károly Khuen-Héderváry]] administration. While in that office, he established several schools, including one for the blind and deaf, introduced [[physical education]] classes and helped to form the foundation for a unified school system. He had to leave the ministry in 1897, after a protest in which he burned a Hungarian flag. He returned to the University and, in 1906, joined the [[Party of Rights]]. Shortly thereafter, he began painting again.

In addition to being a painter and critic, he also translated [[Dante's Divine Comedy]] into Croatian and was the author of poems, travelogues and two novels. He died in [[Zagreb]].

In Croatian film ''[[Countess Dora]]'' (1993) he is played by [[Relja Bašić]].

'''Localization and Urbanization Economies''' are two types of external [[economies of scale]], or agglomeration economies. External economies of scale result from an increase in the productivity of an entire industry, region, or economy due to factors outside of an individual company. There are three sources of external economies of scale: input sharing, [[labour economics|labor market pooling]], and [[knowledge spillover]]s (Marshall, 1920) '&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marshall|first1=Alfred|title=Principles of Economics|date=1920}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Localization economies occur when an increase in the size of an industry in a city leads to an increase in productivity of a particular activity.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal and Strange, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Alfred Marshall (1920) introduced the idea that the localization of industry can increase productivity in his book Principles of Economics. The highly concentrated [[high tech]] industry in [[Silicon Valley]] exemplifies industrial localization.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal and Strange, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Although the cost of labor and land in Silicon Valley is very high, high tech firms continue to locate there because of the added benefit they receive from their proximity to a high-skilled labor pool. The size of the high tech industry, creates positive externalities for each firm located in Silicon Valley.

Urbanization economies arise when the size of the city leads to an increase in productivity. [[Los Angeles]] exemplifies urbanization economies in that it has no single dominant industry, yet continues to grow. Firms which locate in Los Angeles benefit from the common resources and large labor pool found in the city. Common resources such as roads, buildings and power supply benefit firms in cities regardless of their industry. Also, firms have better access to labor by locating in cities. The urban environment creates positive externalities that benefit several different industries. [[Jane Jacobs]] is often credited with the idea that urban diversity and a city’s size leads to agglomeration economies. However, Marshall’s (1920)&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, 1920&lt;/ref&gt; discussion of urban diversity predates her work.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal and Strange, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Men's studies''', often called '''men and masculinities''' in academic settings, is an [[interdisciplinary]] [[academic field]] devoted to topics concerning [[men]], [[masculinity]], [[feminism]], [[gender]], and [[politics]]. It draws upon [[feminist theory]] in order to analyze different ideologies  having to do with masculinity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Allan|first=Jonathan | title = Phallic affect, or why men's rights activists have feelings | journal = [[Men and Masculinities]] | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 22&amp;ndash;41 |publisher= [[SAGE Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/1097184X15574338 |date= April 2016 |url= https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1097184X15574338 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; and through such analysis to examine the multiple ''masculinities'' contained in the idea of masculinity itself. Men's studies also academically examine what it means to be a man in contemporary society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last= Bennett|first=Jessica |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/09/fashion/masculinities-studies-stonybrook-michael-kimmel.html?_r=0|title=A master's degree in...masculinity?|date=August 8, 2015|work=[[New York Times]]|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
As a relatively new field of study, men's studies was formed largely in response to, and as a critique of, an emerging [[men's rights]] movement, and as such, has been taught in academic settings only since the 1970s.  In many universities, men's studies is a correlation to [[women's studies]] or part of a larger [[gender studies]] program, and as such its faculty tends to be sympathetic to, or engaged in, advocacy of [[feminist]] politics. Men's studies works with feminist studies to question the relationship that men have with patriarchal power throughout different temporal and historical times.&lt;ref name="Gurfinkel"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Gurfinkel|first=Helena|title=Masculinity studies: what is it, and why would a feminist care?|url=https://siuewmst.wordpress.com/2012/12/06/masculinity-studies-what-is-it-and-why-would-a-feminist-care/|website=siuewmst.wordpress.com|publisher=[[Southern Illinois University|SIUE]] Women's Studies Program via [[WordPress]]|date=December 6, 2012|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of plural ''masculinities'' was proposed by [[R.W. Connell]] in her influential book ''Masculinities'' (1995);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Connell | first = R. W. | author-link = R.W. Connell | title = Masculinities | publisher = Polity Press | location = Cambridge, UK | year = 1995 | isbn = 9780745614694 }}&lt;/ref&gt; thus the academic field is today often known as ''men and masculinities''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Aboim | first = Sofia | title = Plural masculinities: the remaking of the self in private life | page = 5 | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2016 | isbn = 9781315600901 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In contrast to the discipline of [[masculine psychology]], men's studies programs and courses often include contemporary discussions of men's rights, [[feminist theory]], [[queer theory]], [[matriarchy]], [[patriarchy]], and more generally, what proponents describe as the social, historical, and cultural constructions of [[Man|men]]. They often discuss the issues surrounding [[male privilege]], seen as evolving into more subtle forms rather than disappearing in the modern era.

== Construction of Masculinity ==
When pursuing masculinity studies, many scholars began explaining how masculinity is a [[Social constructionism|social construction]]. [[Michael Kimmel]], a prominent scholar in the field of masculinity studies, writes extensively on manhood and its definition. He does this starting with the 19th century in America, when masculinity began to be defined through proving oneself as a man. As a result, the political arena, workplace, family, and whole world was changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Kimmel |editor1-first=Michael | editor-link = Michael Kimmel |title= The politics of manhood |publisher= [[Temple University Press]] |location= Philadelphia |isbn= 9781566393652 |year=1995 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ksbyvqKZL2MC }}&lt;/ref&gt; This change constructed "[[hegemonic masculinity]]", or the "practice that allowed men's dominance over women to continue",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Laurie|first=Timothy | title = Masculinity studies and the jargon of strategy: ''hegemony, tautology, sense'' | journal = [[Angelaki|Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities]], special issue: Geophilosophies of masculinity: remapping gender, aesthetics and knowledge | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 13&amp;ndash;30 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/0969725X.2015.1017373 | date = 2015 | url = https://doi.org/10.1080/0969725X.2015.1017373 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://www.academia.edu/10912537/Masculinity_Studies_and_the_Jargon_of_Strategy_Hegemony_Tautology_Sense Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; or the stereotypical definition of masculinity that many think of initially. In unpacking masculinity, the construction is understood [[Intersectionality|intersectionally]], looking at the historical, cultural, temporal, political, and psychological ways in which the definition of masculinity is created.&lt;ref name="Gurfinkel" /&gt; Because of the intersectional lens used to study masculinity, it becomes clear that there are multiple masculinities because of the various experiences that different histories, cultures, and times produce.

== Organizations ==
The [[American Men's Studies Association]] (AMSA) traces the roots of an organized field of men's studies to the early 1980s and the work of scholars involved in an [[Sexism|anti-sexist]] organization called the Men's Studies Task Group (MSTG) of the National Organization for Changing Men (NOCM) which included Martin Acker, Shepherd Bliss, [[Harry Brod]], Sam Femiano, Martin Fiebert, and [[Michael Messner]]. However, men's studies classes also pre-date NOCM, and a small number were taught in various colleges across the United States throughout the 1970s. Conferences such as the Men and Masculinity conferences sparked the creation of newsletters and journals, such as the ''Men's Studies Newsletter'' (and its successor, ''Men’s Studies Review''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Men’s Studies Review (journal) | publisher = American Men's Studies Association (AMSA) | location = Harriman, Tennessee | lccn = 93648850 | issn = 0890-9741}}&lt;/ref&gt; pertaining to the growing field of men's studies. These became prime resources for those interested in the field, providing news, bibliographies, and firsthand experiences. Following the newsletters and journals came the [[Men's Studies Press]], thus moving the academic field of masculinity studies to books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Doyle|first=James. A|last2=Femiano|first2=Sam | title = A history of the Men's Studies Press and its Association with the American Men's Studies Association | journal = [[The Journal of Men's Studies]], special issue: AMSA at 20 | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 24&amp;ndash;33 | publisher = [[Sage Publishing|Sage]] | doi = 10.3149/jms.2101.24 | date = January 2013 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.3149/jms.2101.24 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}

When NOCM changed its name to the [[National Organization for Men Against Sexism]] (NOMAS),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Home page | url = http://www.nomas.org/ | website = nomas.org | publisher = [[National Organization for Men Against Sexism]] (NOMAS) }}&lt;/ref&gt; the MSTG became the Men's Studies Association (MSA). The MSA was an explicitly pro-feminist group, and those who felt this was too constraining split away several years later to form the American Men's Studies Association (AMSA).

== Criticism ==
A range of criticisms have been made of the separation between "men's studies" and "gender studies". For example, Timothy Laurie and Anna Hickey-Moody insist that "[any] atomisation of masculinity studies as distinct from gender studies, feminist inquiry or queer studies must be understood as provisional and hazardous rather than as the result of absolute differences in the phenomena being investigated or expertise required".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Laurie | first1 = Timothy | last2 = Hickey-Moody | first2 = Anna | title = Geophilosophies of masculinity: remapping gender, aesthetics and knowledge | journal = [[Angelaki|Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities]], special issue: Geophilosophies of masculinity: remapping gender, aesthetics and knowledge | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 1&amp;ndash;10 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/0969725X.2015.1017359 | date = 2015 | url = https://doi.org/10.1080/0969725X.2015.1017359 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://www.academia.edu/10912564 Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 Joyce E. Canaan and Christine Griffin described their suspicions of The New Men's Studies (TNMS): the emergence of conferences and books on men and masculinity during a time of political and financial cuts to further education and higher education in the UK, "Is it a coincidence that TNMS is being constructed in the present context as a source of potential research, publishing deals, and (even more) jobs for the already-well-paid boys holding prestigious positions?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Canaan | first1 = Joyce E. | last2 = Griffin | first2 = Christine | chapter = The new men's studies: part of the problem or part of the solution | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yC5HBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA208 | editor-last1 = Morgan | editor-first1 = D.

==Work and care==
Men's studies are notably concerned with challenging gendered arrangements of work and care, and the male breadwinner role, and policies are increasingly targeting men as fathers, as a tool of changing gender relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bjørnholt | first = Margunn | authorlink1= Margunn Bjørnholt | title = Changing men, changing times; fathers and sons from an experimental gender equality study | journal = [[The Sociological Review]] | volume = 62 | issue = 2  | pages = 295&amp;ndash;315 | publisher = [[SAGE Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1111/1467-954X.12156 | date = May 2014 | url = https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-954X.12156 }} [http://www.margunnbjornholt.no/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Changing-men-changing-times-fathers-and-sons-from-an-experimental-gender-equality-study.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Association for the Promotion of Social Science (NAPSS)''', often known as the '''Social Science Association''', was a British reformist group founded in 1857 by [[Lord Brougham]]. It pursued issues in [[public health]], [[industrial relations]], [[penal reform]], and [[female education]]. It was dissolved in 1886.&lt;ref name="Hastings"&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=39463|title=Hastings, George Woodyatt|first=Lawrence|last=Goldman|authorlink=Lawrence Goldman|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/39463}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Social Science Congress 1879.jpg|thumb|The Social Science Congress 1879, illustration from ''[[The Graphic]]'']]
The efforts of [[George Hastings (MP for East Worcestershire)|George Hastings]] brought together three groups of the 1850s to form the NAPSS: the Society for Promoting the Amendment of the Law, the National Reformatory Union, and the [[Society for Promoting the Employment of Women]] (the Langham Place Group).&lt;ref name="Hastings"/&gt; It took as model the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]], holding an itinerant annual meeting, which provided a forum for social reformers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Harriet Martineau|author2=Fanny Wedgewood|title=Harriet Martineau's Letters to Fanny Wedgewood|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yR2rAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA171|accessdate=22 June 2013|date=1 January 1983|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-1146-3|page=171 note 20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The objectives of the Association was defined as "to coordinate the efforts of the experts and the politicians".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ben Griffin|title=The Politics of Gender in Victorian Britain: Masculinity, Political Culture and the Struggle for Women's Rights|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jsnnyrckKqQC&amp;pg=PA80|accessdate=23 June 2013|date=12 January 2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-01507-4|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; One factor in the eventual decline of the NSPSS was that the objectives of medical reformers changed. Legislation and the efforts of central government to improve public health became less important to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lawrence Goldman|title=Science, Reform, and Politics in Victorian Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=io2nB6RcaIwC&amp;pg=PA200|accessdate=23 June 2013|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-43301-3|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trades Societies and Strikes===
A committee of the Association produced ''Report on Trade Societies and Strikes'' (1860). This report was highly regarded: the Webbs later called it "the best collection of Trade Union material and the most impartial account of Trade Union action that has ever been issued".&lt;ref name="LaceyFurner1993"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael J.

According to the [[anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Bradd Shore]], the '''''neuromantic'''''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|last=Shore|first=Bradd|title=Culture in Mind: Cognition, Culture, and the Problem of Meaning|url=|volume=|pages=141, 143–4|year=1996|location=|publisher=Oxford University Press|doi=|isbn=|id=|authorlink=Bradd Shore|coauthors=}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the cybernetic frame of mind among excited computer enthusiasts as they experience what Michael Heim called "the all-at-once simultaneity of totalizing presentness".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Shore explains that "the sense of mastery over language resources that word processing bestows on the experienced user is intimately related to [[Martin Heidegger]]'s notion of [[Gestell|enframing ''(Bestellen'')]], a subjection of the world to human will that Heidegger saw as a characteristic of all modern technology."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

There are sources that claim the concept of neuromantic is not only confined to computer enthusiasts. For instance, there is the so-called neuromantic imagination that inspire architects. Here, the cybernetic frame of mind is fired by the concept of the "third nature," which is occupied by those who inhabit not the actual terrain in which we live, work, and play but the virtual space of media flows that enter the "unconscious".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Teletechnologies, Place, and Community|last=Wilken|first=Rowan|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=9780415875950|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Flow (psychology)|Flowstates]].

An '''occulting disk''' is a small disk used in a [[telescope]] to block the view of a bright object in order to allow observation of a fainter one. The [[coronagraph]], at its simplest, is an occulting disk in the focal plane of a [[telescope]], or in front of the entrance [[aperture]], that blocks out the image of the solar disk, so that the [[corona]] can be seen. [[Starshade]] is one designed to fly in formation with a [[space telescope]] to image [[exoplanet]]s.

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to automation:

'''[[Automation]]''' &amp;ndash; use of [[control system]]s and [[information technology|information technologies]] to reduce the need for human work in the production of goods and services. In the scope of [[industrialization]], automation is a step beyond [[mechanization]].

{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

== Essence of automation ==
* [[Control system]] &amp;ndash;  a device, or set of devices to manage, command, direct or regulate the behavior of other devices or system.
* [[Industrial control system]] (ICS) &amp;ndash; encompasses several types of control systems used in industrial production, including supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, distributed control systems (DCS), and other smaller control system configurations such as skid-mounted [[programmable logic controller]]s (PLC) often found in the industrial sectors and critical infrastructures.
* [[Industrialization]] &amp;ndash; period of social and economic change that transforms a human group from an agrarian society into an industrial one.
* [[Numerical control]] (NC) &amp;ndash;  refers to the automation of machine tools that are operated by abstractly programmed commands encoded on a storage medium, as opposed to controlled manually via handwheels or levers, or mechanically automated via cams alone.
* [[Robotics]] &amp;ndash;  the branch of technology that deals with the design, construction, operation, structural disposition, manufacture and application of robots and computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing.

== Branches of automation ==
* [[Autonomous automation]] &amp;ndash;  autonomous software agents to adapt the controllers of computer controlled industrial machinery and processes
* [[Building automation]] &amp;ndash; advanced functionality provided by the control system of a building. A building automation system (BAS) is an example of a distributed control system.
** [[Home automation]] &amp;ndash;  control system of a home.
** [[Office automation]] &amp;ndash;  the varied computer machinery and software used to digitally create, collect, store, manipulate, and relay office information needed for accomplishing basic tasks such as [[business process automation]] and [[robotic process automation]].

== Fields contributing to automation ==
* [[Cybernetics]] &amp;ndash;  the interdisciplinary study of the structure of regulatory systems.
* [[Cognitive science]] &amp;ndash;  interdisciplinary scientific study of the mind and its processes. It examines what cognition is, what it does and how it works.
* [[Robotics]] &amp;ndash;  the branch of technology that deals with the design, construction, operation, structural disposition, manufacture and application of robots and computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing.

== History of automation ==

* [[Mass production#History|History of mass production]] &amp;ndash; Prerequisites of mass production were interchangeable parts, machine tools and power, especially in the form of electricity. Mass production was popularized in the 1910s and 1920s by Henry Ford's Ford Motor Company, which introduced electric motors to the then-well-known technique of chain or sequential production.
* [[Numerical control]] (NC) &amp;ndash;  refers to the automation of machine tools that are operated by abstractly programmed commands encoded on a storage medium, as opposed to controlled manually via handwheels or levers, or mechanically automated via cams alone.
* [[History of home automation]]

== Automated machines ==
* [[Machine to Machine]] &amp;ndash;
* [[OLE for process control]] (OPC) &amp;ndash; 
* [[Process control]] &amp;ndash;  a statistics and engineering discipline that deals with architectures, mechanisms and algorithms for maintaining the output of a specific process within a desired range.
* [[Run Book Automation]] (RBA) &amp;ndash; 
* [[Robot]] &amp;ndash;  a mechanical or virtual intelligent agent that can perform tasks automatically or with guidance, typically by remote control.

== Automated machine components ==
* [[Artificial intelligence]] &amp;ndash; the intelligence of machines and the branch of computer science that aims to create it.
* [[Friendly artificial intelligence]] &amp;ndash; an artificial intelligence that has a positive rather than negative effect on humanity, and the field of knowledge required to build such an artificial intelligence.

===Automation tools===

* [[Artificial neural network]] (ANN) &amp;ndash;  mathematical model or computational model that is inspired by the structure or functional aspects of biological neural networks.
* [[Human machine interface]] (HMI) &amp;ndash; operator level  local control panel that control monitors the field devices,
* [[Laboratory information management system]] (LIMS) &amp;ndash;  software package that offers a set of key features that support a modern laboratory's operations.
* [[Industrial control system]] &amp;ndash; encompasses several types of control systems used in industrial production, including supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, distributed control systems (DCS), and other smaller control system configurations such as skid-mounted programmable logic controllers (PLC) often found in the industrial sectors and critical infrastructures.
** [[Distributed control system]] (DCS) &amp;ndash; control system usually of a manufacturing system, process or any kind of dynamic system, in which the controller elements are not central in location (like the brain) but are distributed throughout the system with each component sub-system controlled by one or more controllers.
** Manufacturing execution system (MES) &amp;ndash; system that manages manufacturing operations in a factory, including management of resources, scheduling production processes, dispatching production orders, execution of production orders, etc.
** [[Programmable automation controller]] (PAC) &amp;ndash; digital computer used for automation of electromechanical processes, such as control of machinery on factory assembly lines, amusement rides, or light fixtures.
** [[Programmable logic controller]] (PLC)A Programmable Logic Controller, PLC or Programmable Controller is a digital computer used for automation of electromechanical processes, such as control of machinery on factory assembly lines, amusement rides, or light fixtures. The abbreviation "PLC" and the term "Programmable Logic Controller" are registered trademarks of the Allen-Bradley Company (Rockwell Automation). PLCs are used in many industries and machines. Unlike general-purpose computers, the PLC is designed for multiple inputs and output arrangements, extended temperature ranges, immunity to electrical noise, and resistance to vibration and impact. Programs to control machine operation are typically stored in battery-backed-up or non-volatile memory. A PLC is an example of a hard real time system since output results must be produced in response to input conditions within a limited time, otherwise unintended operation will result. &amp;ndash;
** [[Supervisory control and data acquisition]] (SCADA) &amp;ndash; generally refers to industrial control systems (ICS): computer systems that monitor and control industrial, infrastructure, or facility-based processes, as described below:* Industrial processes include those of manufacturing, production, power generation, fabrication, and refining, and may run in continuous, batch, repetitive, or discrete modes.
* [[Simulation#Engineering Technology simulation or Process simulation]] &amp;ndash;

==Social movements ==

Automation-related social movement &amp;ndash; a movement that advocates semi- or fully automatic systems to provide for human needs globally. For example, automation of farming and food distribution throughout the world so that no one will go hungry. One goal is to automate all mundane labor, to free humans to engage in more creative activities (or less work).
* The [[Technocracy movement]] &amp;ndash; social movement active from the Great Depression (1930s) to date that proposes replacing politicians and businesspeople with scientists and engineers who have the technical expertise to manage the economy.
* [[The Zeitgeist Movement]] &amp;ndash;  movement advocating the replacement of the market economy with an economy in which all resources are equitably, commonly and sustainably shared.

== Automation in the future ==
* [[Android (robot)|Android]] &amp;ndash; a robot or synthetic organism designed to look and act like a human, and with a body having a flesh-like resemblance
* [[Technological singularity]] &amp;ndash;  the hypothetical future emergence of greater-than-human intelligence through technological means

'''Ozark Medieval Fortress''' is a project designed to construct an accurate replica of a 13th-century [[Château|French castle]] in [[Lead Hill, Arkansas|Lead Hill]], [[Arkansas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bransonshows.com/activity/OzarkMedievalFortress.cfm|title=Ozark Medieval Fortress|website=Bransonshows.com|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction is carried out on the site using only materials and techniques appropriate to the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scatoday.net/node/14323|title=Building It Medieval-The Ozark Medieval Fortress in Arkansas|website=Scatoday.net|accessdate=2 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802204347/http://www.scatoday.net/node/14323#|archive-date=2017-08-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ground was broken in 2009, with the expectation that completion will take about 20 years.

The project was inspired by [[Guédelon Castle]] in France, which is the first attempt to build a medieval castle using accurate construction methods, started by [[Michel Guyot]]. Two French citizens living in Arkansas offered to sell Guyot part of their land for the building of a similar fortification. Guyot accepted, and construction began in June 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.riverfronttimes.com/dailyrft/2010/03/medieval_castle_under_construction_in_ozarks.php |title=Medieval Castle Under Construction in Ozarks|author=Aimee Levitt|date=March 18, 2010|accessdate=2010-07-12 |deadurl=yes |work=Riverfront Times|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100810065410/http://blogs.riverfronttimes.com/dailyrft/2010/03/medieval_castle_under_construction_in_ozarks.php |archivedate=2010-08-10 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010, Ozark Medieval Fortress opened to the public. Visitors had the opportunity to observe the ongoing construction and talk to the costumed workers. Additionally, starting in 2011 a collection of medieval siege weapons was to be on display. The site was open every day from 10AM to 6PM.

In January 2012 the project closed indefinitely, requiring a buyer or an investor.&lt;ref name="ozark_closes"&gt;[http://www.baxterbulletin.com/article/20120124/NEWS01/201240337/Ozark-Medieval-Fortress-closes-now]{{Dead link|date=October 2016|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/28/us/buyer-sought-for-stalled-medieval-castle-in-arkansas.html|title=Buyer Sought for Stalled Tourist Castle Near Branson|first=Bret|last=Schulte|date=27 May 2013|website=Nytimes.com|accessdate=2 August 2017|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4898">'''Philosophy of motion''' is a branch of philosophy concerned with exploring questions on the existence and nature of motion. The central questions of this study concern the [[epistemology]] and ontology of motion, whether motion exists as we perceive it, what is it, and, if it exists,  how does it occur. The philosophy of motion is important in the study of theories of change in natural systems and is closely connected to studies of space and time in philosophy.

The philosophy of motion was of central concern to Ancient Greek and Roman philosophers, particularly the [[pre-Socratic]] philosophers such as [[Parmenides]], [[Zeno of Elea]], [[Heraclitus]] and [[Democritus]].  As such, it was influential in the development of the philosophy of science in general.

==Early history==
===The Greek Physiology===

The concept of motion is closely related to the idea of change, and it is arguments about what made change possible that led the early Greek philosophers to pioneer naturalistic explanations for phenomena.

Heraclitus had famously declared that "all is motion".

Parmenides professed that from our human point of view there are two aspects to the study of the universe of which we must be aware, on the one hand how we see it, and on the other how it must really be. Motion is a fact from our point of view, but Parmenides argues that as far as things must really be, it is logically impossible that motion could exist as we perceive it.

Zeno of Elea, a pupil of Parmenides, formulated the Arguments against motion, more commonly referred to as the [[Zeno's paradoxes|paradoxes]], in order to support his masters theories of the One and of the consequent impossibility of motion at the fundamental level. The rigorous denial of even the possibility of motion forced a more thorough response from philosophers engaged on the same theoretical project.

====Atomism and Determinism====
In response, Democritus expounded the [[atomic theory]], in which indivisible bits of matter are in constant motion through the void. In the absence of something to perturb them they fall evenly through space.

Motion conceived in this way led naturally to questions of [[free will]] and [[determinism]]. In response to this, [[Epicurus]] appears to have included the concept of the [[clinamen]], or atomic swerve. This tiny random motion serves to bring atoms into contact and begin the cascade that leads to the organisation of matter as we see it now., it also introduced an element of uncertainty which appears to have been an important concept in Epicurus' insistence on the existence of individual choice.

===Later Development===
[[Aristotle]], in his physics, defines motion  as the actuality of a potentiality.

===Buddhist===
The philosophy of motion is treated by the [[Buddhist]] philosopher [[Nagarjuna]] in his treatise the [[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]] or Fundamental verses of the [[Middle Way]], in the 2nd and 3rd century CE.

Further east, in China, the [[Sanlun]] school of [[Mahayana]] Buddhism developed a sophisticated philosophy of motion under the philosopher [[Sengzhao]]. His treatise called The Immutability of Things, deals with motion explicitly.

===Aztec===
Aztec metaphysics gave priority to motion over substance in its cosmological [[ontology]]. In other words, process was seen to be fundamental and objects or substances as ephemeral. Change therefore was naturally conceived of as motion, and this motion was divided into three forms, out of which all change occurs. These were named olin (bouncing, oscillating) malinalli (spinning, twisting, spiralling) and, the most important, nepantla (weaving, intersecting, joining, balancing).&lt;ref&gt;https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/53017-aztec-philosophy-understanding-a-world-in-motion/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval==
* [[Maimonides]]
* [[Averroes]]
* [[Thomas Aquinas]]

==Modern==
Achieving a coherent understanding of motion has been, and continues to be, of importance in understanding the nature of space and time in modern science.{{According to whom|date=November 2015}} The main philosophical debate has been between absolute and relational conceptions of motion.&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spacetime-theories/&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Descartes]]
* [[Leibniz]]
* [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]
* [[Ernst Mach|Mach]]
* [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]
* [[Chaos theory]]
* Astronomy

===Biology===
Motion in [[complex systems]] such as protein folding.

===Evolution===
Morphogenesis of animal bodies and change on large and small scales. Niche construction.

===Scale relativity===
The work of Nottale.

===Quantum physics===
Questions of the nature of motion continue to arise in modern physics, with many of the issues of concern to early thinkers arising in different form. Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and the clinamen of the Epicureans.

'''Railway archaeology''' is the study and enjoyment of relics from past eras of rail transportation (including railways and tramways of all gauges and sizes). The aim of railway archaeology is to learn about the history and see images of the previous appearance of a defunct rail system that became redundant or abandoned and to enjoy searching out these remains and exploring them.

Railway archaeology comes under the general ambit of the study of the industrial past and therefore is a sub-set of [[Industrial archaeology]].

==Societies undertaking railway archaeology==
The Railway Archaeological Society, a UK-based group that seems to be defunct.

Light Railway Research Society of Australia is an Australian-based society that was formed in 1961 to promote interest in special-purpose railways. Much of its members' work would fall into the category of Railway archaeology.

==Discoveries==
* '''London Bridge Station''' Archaeologists have discovered hundreds of artifacts at an excavation site under the London Bridge Station.  Excavation pits were dug 6 meters deep revealing many artifacts from Roman times, timber piles that were recorded as to be from 59 AD to 83 AD that was used for buildings during the first London Bridge, and Medieval floors.  The Archaeologists continue excavating the site for more artifacts around the 16th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.networkrail.co.uk/archaeological-finds-at-london-bridge-station/&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Victorian Era''' Archaeologists in London have discovered a railway infrastructure near the London tube station created by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, an engineer that is well known for his invention approximately 200 years ago called the Broad-Gauge Great Western Steam Railway.  The area has evidence of seven foot-wide broad gauge train tracks and buildings from the 1850s.  At the moment, Archaeologists are further researching the site with laser scanning technology for more artifacts of the Victorian-era railway.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.culture24.org.uk/history-and-heritage/archaeology/art500045-victorian-railway-infrastructure-discovered-by-archaeologists-near-london-tube-station&lt;/ref&gt;  They are also using a series of 3D models of the architecture of the 1850s buildings in order to identify paths of the railway.
* '''Derbyshire''' In May 2013, a group of archaeologists have discovered what is believed as the oldest railway tunnel at Derbyshire in England (United Kingdom.) The tunnel lies on the route of the Butterley Gangroad, a horse-operated railway built by 1793 to link the Cromford Canal with the limestone quarries at Crich.  The line closed in 1933 after being open for over 100 years and the tunnel was sealed up 50 years later in the 1980s.  Trevor Griffin, who is project managing the work for the Derbyshire Archaeological Society, said he thought the tunnel could be older than the one regarded as the world's first - which is also in Derbyshire.  He said: "The tunnel that was currently generally considered to be the world's oldest was on the Peak Forest Tramway and was built in 1795."  The two-year project began in January. The society worked with Wessex Archaeology to reopen the tunnel and made a three-dimensional computer model of the interior using laser scanning.  Written evidence suggested the railway was operating by 1793 and Mr Griffin says they were able to prove the line must have run through the tunnel. The Butterley Gangroad, which was engineered by Benjamin Outram, was modernised in the 1840s and turned into a narrow gauge railway.  When the work is completed, the tunnel will be sealed up for further preservation.

The change from GDA to RI on labels on pre-packaged food and drinks sold in the UK is due to [[Regulation (EU) 1169/2011]].&lt;ref&gt;EU Regulation 1169/2011 on the provision of food information to consumers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New EU law on food information to consumers|url=http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/labellingnutrition/foodlabelling/proposed_legislation_en.htm|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=27 April 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325234056/http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/labellingnutrition/foodlabelling/proposed_legislation_en.htm|archivedate=25 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intention of the EU Regulation is to harmonise across Europe the content, expression and presentation of the nutrition information given to consumers.

Since RIs are for an average adult, concerns have been raised by major retailers and manufacturers that they may face criticism for misrepresenting the contribution to the diet of products targeted at children, particularly given concerns around children’s diet and [[Epidemiology of childhood obesity|obesity levels]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adoption of Children’s Reference Intakes for food labelling purposes|url=http://www.sacn.gov.uk/pdfs/sacn1305_childrens_ris.pdf|website=Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition|accessdate=7 June 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714150423/http://www.sacn.gov.uk/pdfs/sacn1305_childrens_ris.pdf|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Schleberoda''' is a village and a former municipality in the [[Burgenlandkreis]] district, in [[Saxony-Anhalt]], [[Germany]]. Since 1 July 2009, it is part of the town [[Freyburg, Germany|Freyburg]].

It has been proposed by Germany for inscription in the List of [[World Heritage]]. The World Heritage nomination [[Naumburg Cathedral and the High Medieval Cultural Landscape of the Rivers Saale and Unstrut]] is representative for the processes that shaped the continent during the [[High Middle Ages]] between 1000 and 1300: [[Christianization]], the so-called [[Landesausbau]] and the dynamics of cultural exchange and transfer characteristic for this very period.&lt;ref name="Bartlett"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Making of Europe: Conquest, Colonization and Cultural Change 950-1350|last=Bartlett|first=Robert|date=1994|publisher=Penguin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
Schleberoda is located north of the [[Unstrut]]. It was founded as a result of intensive land development by clearance in the [[High Middle Ages]] such as other villages with ″root″ (Roda) in the name (e.g. Albersroda, Baumersorda, Schnellroda, Ebersroda and Schleberoda).    
The closely bordering local nobles in the area separated their territories using stone landmarks, as is still visible at the historic edges of the nearby woods, authentic landmarks which have been unchanged since the High Middle Ages: The clearance work and founding of new villages ran southwards from the original parish of Mücheln and ended at the Neue Göhle forest, which belonged to the territory of the [[Landgrave of Thuringia|Landgraves of Thuringia]] and could therefore not be cleared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Linien und Säume, Zonen und Räume an der Ostgrenze des Reiches im frühen und hohen Mittelalter.|trans-title=Lines and frontiers, zones and spaces at the Eastern border of the empire of the Early and High Medieval Ages|pages=39–56|author=Hardt, Matthias|publisher=Wien|date=2000|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The forest Neue Göhle (Old Sorbian name gola = heath forest) has survived as a continuous, large forest complex. It was used for the production of pole wood in the context of [[winegrowing]] at a very early point in time, which is why it had been afforested in the form of coppice-with-standards.  Stone landmarks, ditches, banks and paths are still visible at the historic edges of this woods separated the territories of the closely bordering local nobles in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|date=1913|language=German|trans-title=On the history of the so-called ″circular villages" in the region of Naumburg.

[[File:Steinmeister vineyard.jpg|thumb|Steinmeister vineyard]]

== Today ==
Schleberoda has retained the structures and authentic form dating from the time of its foundation. It is an examples of the land development in the contact area between [[Germans]] and [[Slavs]] in the [[High Middle Ages]]. It has been able to retain its original ground plan as a radial round village dating from the High Middle Ages.  Around the original village [[pond]], serving for fire-fighting, and the bake house, replaced at the end of the [[18th century]], forward-gabled and side-gabled buildings are grouped, some made with packed loam, with high-quality portals dating from the [[16th century|16th]] to [[19th century]]. 
The position of the former gate to the compact village settlement is still identifiable today. Including the outer boundary of the official village area is not only identifiable by a circumferential path and has survived in its original form to the north-west in the shape of an impenetrable hedge. The [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] choir tower of the village church with coupled abat sons has survived.

[[Semiotics]] is the study of [[meaning-making]] on the basis of signs. Semiotics of [[photography]] is the observation of symbolism used within photography or "reading" the picture. This article refers to realistic, unedited photographs not those that have been manipulated in any way.
[[Roland Barthes]] was one of the first people to study the semiotics of images. He developed a way to understand the meaning of images. Most of Barthes' studies related to advertising, but his concepts can apply to photography as well.&lt;ref name="Borchers 2006 271"&gt;{{cite book|last=Borchers|first=Timothy|title=Rhetorical Theory|year=2006|publisher=Thomson Wadsworth|location=Belmont, California|isbn=0-534-63918-6|pages=271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Denotation==

[[Denotation]] refers to the meaning hidden in symbols or images. A denotation is "what we see" in the picture or what is "there" in the picture.&lt;ref name="Bate 2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bate|first=David|title=Photography: The Key Concepts|year=2009|publisher=Burg|isbn=978-1-84520-667-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to author [[Clive Scott (linguist)|Clive Scott]], this is another way of saying that a photograph has both a signified and a referent, is both coded and encoded. This is to re-emphasize the co-existence of the iconic and idexical.&lt;ref name=References&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Clive|title=The Spoken Image: Photography and Language|year=1999|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn=978-1-86189-032-0|pages=355}}&lt;/ref&gt; In photography the photo itself is the signifier, the signified is what the image is or represents.&lt;ref name="Seiter"&gt;{{cite web|last=Seiter|first=Ellen|title=Semiotics, Structuralism, and Television|url=http://www.asu.edu/courses/lia394c/total-readings/Seiter--Semiotics.htm|work=Channels of Discourse, Reassembled: Television and Contemporary Criticism|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|accessdate=December 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The literal meaning of the image.

[[Connotation (Semiotics)]] is arbitrary in that the meanings brought to the image are based on rules or conventions that the reader has learnt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crow|first=David|title=Visible Signs: An Introduction to Semiotics in the Visual Arts|year=2010|publisher=AVA Publishing|isbn=978-2-940411-42-9|pages=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Connotation attaches additional meaning to the first signifier, which is why the first signifier is often described in multiple words that include things like camera angle, color, lighting, etc.&lt;ref name="Seiter"/&gt; It is the immediate cultural meaning from what is seen in the picture, but not what is actually there.&lt;ref name="Bate 2009"/&gt; Connotation is what is implied by the image.

==Coded iconic==

According to Roland Barthes the coded iconic message is the story that the image portrays. This message is easily understood and the images represent a clear relationship.&lt;ref name="Borchers 2006 271"/&gt; The "reader" of the image applies their knowledge to the encoding of the photo. An image of a bowl of fruit for example might imply still life, freshness or market stalls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crow|first=David|title=Visible Signs: An Introduction to Semiotics|year=2003|publisher=AKA Books|isbn=978-2-88479-035-2|pages=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Noncoded iconic==

Noncoded iconic is another part of Barthes' theory of understanding images. Noncoded has nothing to do with the emotions from the image as a whole. It is the "literal" denotation, the recognition of identifiable object in the photograph, irrespective of the larger societal code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Seiler|first=Robert M.|title=Roland Barthes|url=http://people.ucalgary.ca/~rseiler/barthes.htm|accessdate=June 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the bowl of fruit example, this photograph is just that, a bowl of fruit. A non-coded iconic has no deeper meaning, the image is exactly what it shows.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="757">'''Social and Vocational Skills''' (SVS) is a subject which can be taken in [[high schools]] as a [[Standard Grade]] in Scotland. Unlike other subjects in the [[Scottish educational system]], those who take it are picked specially to do it, normally due to failings in other subjects or social issues. There are exceptions to this rule however, such as [[Elgin Academy, Scotland|Elgin Academy]] in Moray, where it is taken as an additional compulsory standard grade by all pupils, giving most students a possible total of 9.

'''Southwestern University''' (also referred to as '''Southwestern''' or '''SU''') is a private [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts college]] in [[Georgetown, Texas]]. Formed in 1873 from a revival of collegiate charters granted in 1840, Southwestern is the oldest university in Texas. The school is affiliated with the [[United Methodist Church]] with a  [[nonsectarian]] curriculum. Southwestern offers 40 bachelor's degrees in the arts, sciences, fine arts, and music as well as interdisciplinary and pre-professional programs. The university is accredited by the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]] and the [[National Association of Schools of Music]].

The university is a member of the [[Annapolis Group]], the [[Associated Colleges of the South]], the [[Council of Independent Colleges]], and is a signatory of the [[Talloires Declaration]].

==History==
[[File:CullenOld.png|right|thumb|The Roy and Lillie Cullen Building shortly after completion]]
[[File:Mood 1910.png|right|thumb|Students in front of [[Mood-Bridwell Hall]] in 1910]]

Prior to assuming the university's current form, charters had been granted by the [[Texas Legislature]] (Texas Congress 1836–1845) to establish four educational institutions: [[Rutersville College]] of [[Rutersville, Texas]], ''Wesleyan College'' of [[San Augustine, Texas]], [[McKenzie College (Texas)|McKenzie College]] of [[Clarksville, Texas]], and [[Soule University]] of [[Chappell Hill, Texas]].

In 1873, the union of these four institutions opened in Georgetown as ''Texas University''.&lt;ref name="To Survive and Excell, Chapter VI. Fulfillment of the Vision: Southwestern University"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=William B.|title=To Survive and Excel|year=2006|publisher=Southwestern University|location=Georgetown, TX|pages=59–75|url=http://www.southwestern.edu/library/documents/ToSurviveAndExcel.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wishing to reserve that name for a proposed state university in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], the [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]], the Texas Legislature instead granted a charter in 1875 under the name ''Southwestern University'' as a continuation of the charters for Rutersville, Wesleyan, McKenzie, and Soule. The university considers its founding date to be 1840 when Rutersville College opened. Southwestern thus claims to be the oldest university in Texas and the second oldest coeducational liberal arts college west of the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]].

Southwestern was a charter member of the [[Southwest Conference]] in 1915. [[Southern Methodist University]] was Southwestern's main rival for several decades in remembrance of an unsuccessful attempt to relocate Southwestern to Dallas which instead resulted in the establishment of SMU. When SMU's student population became much larger, students at Southwestern began considering [[Trinity University (Texas)|Trinity University]] and [[Austin College]] to be the school's main rivals. After World War II, Southwestern transformed itself into a small liberal arts institution, discontinuing its post-graduate degrees, disbanding the football team, and rebuilding much of the campus with a massive capital campaign. The endowment rose substantially.

Southwestern has a history of drawing prolific lecturers to campus, including [[William Jennings Bryan]], [[Helen Keller]], [[bell hooks]], and alumnus [[J. Frank Dobie]]. Orators traveling by train often stopped off on their way to or from [[Austin, TX|Austin]], giving their lectures and catching the next train. Speakers at the annual Brown Symposium have included author [[Isaac Asimov]] (through a [[video conference]]) in the early 1980s and [[Nobel prize]]-winning economist [[Joseph Stiglitz]] in 2002. Since it began, the Shilling Lecture series has brought a variety of prominent figures, including presidential advisor [[Karen Hughes]] (2003), [[Archbishop]] [[Desmond Tutu]] (2004), former [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Pakistani Prime Minister]] [[Benazir Bhutto]] (2005), former Governor of [[New Jersey]] [[Thomas Kean]] (2006), former Secretary of State [[James Baker]] (2007), former U.S. senator [[Bill Bradley]] (2008), Nobel Peace Prize winner [[Wangari Maathai]] (2009), senior fellow in the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]] Global Health Program [[William Foege]] (2010), founder of TOMs Shoes [[Blake Mycoskie]] (2011), and three-time Pulitzer Prize winner [[Thomas Friedman]] (2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roy &amp; Margaret Shilling Lecture Series|url=http://www.southwestern.edu/about/shilling/|accessdate=4 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209072905/http://www.southwestern.edu/about/shilling/|archivedate=February 9, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2002, The Writer's Voice series presented [[Pulitzer Prize]] winning author [[Michael Chabon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.southwestern.edu/library/writers-voice/chabon.html | title = The Writer's Voice presents Michael Chabon | publisher = Southwestern.edu | date = November 4, 2002 | accessdate = October 22, 2008 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080509155553/http://www.southwestern.edu/library/writers-voice/chabon.html | archivedate = May 9, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Writer's Voice has also welcomed such authors as [[Joyce Carol Oates]] (2000), [[Margaret Atwood]] (2003), [[Amy Tan]] (2007), and [[Azar Nafisi]] (2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.southwestern.edu/library/writers-voice/wvoice.html | title = The Writer's Voice | publisher = Southwestern.edu | accessdate = October 22, 2008 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090227005958/http://www.southwestern.edu/library/writers-voice/wvoice.html | archivedate = February 27, 2009 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics==
The university offers 40 majors and 36 minors divided between the Brown College of Arts and Sciences and the Sarofim School of Fine Arts. In addition to traditional academic majors, Southwestern offers [[interdisciplinary]], independent, and paired majors as well as pre-professional programs in Engineering, Law, Medicine, and [[Theology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southwestern.edu/academics/|title=Southwestern University: Academics|accessdate=October 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southwestern.edu/academics/departments.php|title=Southwestern University: Departments|accessdate=October 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2013-2014 school year, total student enrollment was at 1,536, with a gender distribution of about 60 percent female and 40 percent male. Of the entering first-year students in Fall 2013, 37 percent were in the top 10 percent of their high school graduating class with an average SAT score of 1166 (*writing section not included). While the majority of students come from Texas (89 percent),  the remaining 11 percent come from 23 other states and 6 countries. Minority students constitute 33 percent of the student body.&lt;ref name="Southwestern University Profile"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://southwestern.edu/about/profile.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002035810/http://www.southwestern.edu/about/profile.php |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 2, 2013 |title=Southwestern University Profile |accessdate=December 18, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The student to faculty ratio is 11:1, with an average class size of 15 students. Ninety-nine percent of the tenured or tenure-track faculty hold a doctorate or highest degree in their fields. Collaborative research and publication with students is common.&lt;ref name="Southwestern University Profile"/&gt;

===Research===
Southwestern hosts two interdisciplinary academic exhibitions each year to showcase research by students at Southwestern and researchers across the country. The ''Brown Symposium'' held in the early spring is an academic conference attracting guest lecturers and panelists. All Brown Symposium speakers present research that shares the symposium's theme for that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southwestern.edu/academics/brownsymposium/|title=Brown Symposium|accessdate=December 5, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527155719/http://www.southwestern.edu/academics/brownsymposium/|archivedate=May 27, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Creative Works Symposium'' held near the end of the spring semester offers undergraduate students an opportunity to display their own research as a formal oral presentation, panel discussion, poster presentation, art exhibit, or technology demonstration. These student presentations are often the culmination of senior capstone projects, independent studies, collaborations with a faculty member, or a requirement for receiving research grants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southwestern.edu/academics/studentworks/|title=Student Works Symposium|accessdate=December 5, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420003938/http://www.southwestern.edu/academics/studentworks/|archivedate=April 20, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
Southwestern University is located in [[Georgetown, Texas]], about 30 miles (50&amp;nbsp;km) north of [[Austin, Texas|Austin]]. The campus comprises 700 acres (2.8&amp;nbsp;km²) mostly located north of [[Texas State Highway 29|University Avenue]], although the eastern portion of these lands remains largely undeveloped with some portions serving as an EcoLab where faculty and students conduct research. The main campus is organized around a central academic mall formed by a semi-circular grassy area bounded by a pedestrian walkway and academic buildings. Residence halls and on-campus apartments are located to the east and northwest of the academic mall. Sports fields, support facilities, and parking are on the periphery of the main campus.

===Notable buildings===
[[File:Rutlo 3772831372 Southwestern.jpg|thumb|The [[Hugh Roy and Lillie Cullen Building]] in 2009]]
[[File:Dustinc 263451159 Southwestern.jpg|thumb|The Lois Perkins Chapel situated along the Academic Mall]]
The [[Hugh Roy and Lillie Cullen Building]] (formerly called the Administration Building) was built in 1898 in the [[Richardsonian Romanesque]] style and is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. The Cullen Building currently houses the administration, business office, alumni relations, and classrooms. Throughout various times in its history, it has also housed the campus [[auditorium]], gymnasium, chapel, and library. It is named in honor of [[Hugh Roy Cullen]] and his wife.

[[Mood-Bridwell Hall]], originally a men's [[dormitory]], was completed in 1908 and currently houses classrooms, faculty offices, a computer lab, the Debbie Ellis Writing Center, and an indoor [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]]. Mood-Bridwell is included in the Cullen Building's listing on the National Register of Historic Places.

The [[A. Frank Smith Library Center]] opened in 1939 as the [[Cody Memorial Library]] and was built as part of a [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] project. It was expanded in 1966 and again in 1989, receiving the new name as a result of the second expansion. In addition to books and periodicals, the library houses a film and audio collection, 24-hour computer lab, maps, sheet music, and special collections for Texas history and culture, [[John Tower]], [[J. Frank Dobie]], [[Jessie Daniel Ames]], [[Herman Melville]], [[Aaron Burr]], [[Edward Blake]], [[Thomas Bewick]], and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southwestern.edu/library/special-collections/collections.html|title=Special Collections in Smith Library Center|accessdate=October 23, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527135104/http://www.southwestern.edu/library/special-collections/collections.html|archivedate=May 27, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lois Perkins Chapel]] was built in 1950 and includes an [[Aeolian-Skinner]] [[pipe organ]]. [[Stained glass]] windows along the east and west sides depict [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] leaders and [[Methodist]] leaders with seals for the educational institutions they were affiliated with.

The [[McCombs Campus Center]] opened in 1998, replacing the Bishops' Memorial Student Union Building and University Commons. It includes dining facilities, the campus bookstore, [[ballroom]]s, and student organization offices. It is named for billionaire entrepreneur and Southwestern alum [[Red McCombs]].

The [[Fayez Sarofim]] School of Fine Arts is housed in the Alma Thomas Fine Arts Building, originally built in 1956 on the former property of the Texas rancher [[John Wesley Snyder (Texas)|John Wesley Snyder]], a Southwestern University benefactor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=
http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fsn13|title=H. Allan Anderson of Lubbock, Texas, "John Wesley Snyder"|work=[[The Handbook of Texas]]|accessdate=April 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fine Arts Building (FAB) has been renovated multiple times, most recently in 1998 and 2008. The FAB houses the 700-seat Alma Thomas Theater, the smaller Jones Theater, the Caldwell-Carvey Foyer, numerous practice rooms, art studios, a black box theater, and an instrumental rehearsal hall.

The [[Wilhelmina Cullen Admission Center]] opened in 2009, moving the admissions office out of the Roy and Lillie Cullen Building. It is Southwestern's first "green" building and was designed to receive Gold [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] certification. Some of the building's features include a bamboo floor in the lobby area, skylights in the center of the building, solar-powered sink faucets and reflective roof shingles. Southwestern plans to turn the area in the original Cullen Building formerly occupied by the Admission Office into a museum. The Admissions Center was named after Wilhelmina Cullen, the daughter of Roy and Lillie Cullen.

==Student activities and organizations==

There are over 90 student organizations on campus. The school hosts chapters of 16 academic honor societies, including a chapter of [[Phi Beta Kappa]] and the founding chapter of the [[Alpha Chi]] honor society. The national co-ed service fraternity [[Alpha Phi Omega]] also has a chapter. Several groups on campus participate in social activism and awareness on campus and in the Austin area, including College Democrats, Students for Environmental Activism and Knowledge (SEAK), Latinos Unidos, EBONY, and [[Amnesty International]]. Religious groups on campus include the national [[Christian fraternity]] Kappa Upsilon Chi, Christian sorority [[Sigma Phi Lambda]], Jewish Student Association, Muslim Student Organization, and Buddhist Meditation Group. Other groups include Habitat for Humanity, Model U.N., and German Club.

===Student government===
Student government is primarily handled by the Student Congress, with each member elected to represent students living in residence halls, Greek houses, and at-large for students living off-campus. The Student Congress is headed by a president elected through popular vote. An independent organization, Student Foundation, serves as a liaison between students, faculty, alumni, and the university's administration. A panel of students and faculty maintain the university's [[honor code]], replacing the Student Judiciary which previously adjudicated violations of the honor code.

===Greek life===

Southwestern hosts eight national social [[fraternities and sororities]] governed by the North-American Interfraternity Council (IFC) and the National Panhellenic Council (NPC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://southwestern.edu/studentlife/orgs/greek.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218022453/http://southwestern.edu/studentlife/orgs/greek.php|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2009-02-18|title=Southwestern University: Student Life|work=southwestern.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; All fraternities occupy houses on the western side of the campus. The sororities do not have dedicated housing, although they maintain chapter rooms in the Lord Caskey Center. Southwestern has a deferred rush allowing incoming students to become familiar with the campus before formal recruitment begins in the early spring. About 1/3 of the student life is involved in Greek life.&lt;ref&gt;http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/southwestern-university-3620&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media===
''The Megaphone'', established in 1907, is the official student newspaper of Southwestern University. Published online and biweekly in print, the newspaper focuses on the campus community, including sections on news, features, opinions/editorials, culture, and sports. Throughout its history, the Megaphone has changed formats several times, alternating between [[broadsheets]] and [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] paper. The newspaper publishes an [[April Fool's Day]] edition every spring under the title ''The Megaphool''. [https://web.archive.org/web/20100813204439/http://southwestern.edu/su_blogs/megaphone/ The Megaphone (website)]

''Southwestern University Magazine'' is the student [[literary magazine]]. The magazine is the oldest publication on campus, established in 1882 as the ''Alamo and San Jacinto Monthly'' and renamed the ''Southwestern University Monthly'' in 1895, then the ''SU Literary Magazine'', and finally ''The Spyglass'' in 2012. Currently published twice a year at the end of each semester, the magazine features student poetry, short stories, artwork, and photography.

==Notable people==

===Contributors===
Southwestern has had many financial and non-financial supporters, but some stand out by the magnitude or timeliness of their contributions. During the Great Depression, a conditional gift from Southwestern alumna Louisa Carothers Wiess substantially increased the university's endowment and motivated the university to pay off all its debts. While serving in Congress, [[Lyndon Baines Johnson]] helped Southwestern acquire the Navy V-12 Program during World War II at a time when the university was struggling financially. Former student [[Red McCombs]] contributed financial support for the campus center and an apartment complex. The Brown Foundation, Cullen Foundation, and Mabee Foundation have contributed financial support for multiple construction projects.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7080">'''Spurious trip level''' (STL) is defined as a discrete level for specifying the spurious trip requirements of safety functions to be allocated to safety systems. An STL of 1 means that this safety function has the highest level of spurious trips. The higher the STL level the lower the number of spurious trips caused by the safety system. There is no limit to the number of spurious trip levels.

Safety functions and systems are installed to protect people, the environment and for asset protection. A safety function should only activate when a dangerous situation occurs. A safety function that activates without the presence of a dangerous situation (e.g., due to an internal failure) causes economic loss. The spurious trip level concept represents the probability that safety function causes a spurious (unscheduled) trip.

The STL is a metric that is used to specify the performance level of a safety function in terms of the spurious trips it potentially causes. Typical safety systems that benefit from an STL level are defined in standards like [[IEC 61508]]&lt;ref&gt;IEC 61508: Functional safety of electrical/electronic/programmable electronic safety-related systems, IEC, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; [[IEC 61511]],&lt;ref&gt;IEC 61511 - Functional safety - Safety instrumented systems for the process industry sector, IEC, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; IEC 62061,&lt;ref&gt;Safety of machinery - Functional safety of safety-related electrical, electronic and programmable electronic control systems, IEC, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; ISA S84,&lt;ref&gt;ANSI/ISA-84.00.01-2004 Part 1 (IEC 61511-1 Mod) Functional Safety: Safety Instrumented Systems for the Process Industry Sector&lt;/ref&gt; EN 50204&lt;ref&gt;EN 50204 - Electrical apparatus for the detection and measurement of combustible or toxic gases or vapours or of oxygen. Requirements on the functional safety of fixed gas detection systems&lt;/ref&gt; and so on. An STL provides end-users of safety functions with a measurable attribute that helps them define the desired availability of their safety functions. An STL can be specified for a complete safety loop or for individual devices.

For end-users there is always a potential conflict between the cost of safety solutions and the loss of profitability caused by spurious trips of these safety solutions. The STL concept helps the end-users to end this conflict in a way that safety solutions provide both the desired safety and the desired process availability.

== STL determination ==
The spurious trip level represents asset loss due to an internal failure of the safety function. The more financial damage the safety function can cause due to a spurious trip the higher the STL level of the safety function should be. Each company needs to decide for themselves which level of financial loss they can or are willing to take. This actually depends on many different factors including the financial strength of the company, the insurance policy they have, the cost of process shutdown and startup, and so on. All these factors are unique to each company. The table below shows an example of how a company can calibrate its spurious trip levels.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! STL
! Description
|-
| 6
| Spurious trip costs between 20M and 50M EUR
|-
| 5
| Spurious trip costs between 10M and 20M EUR
|-
| 4
| Spurious trip costs between 5M and 10M EUR
|-
| 3
| Spurious trip costs between 1M and 5M EUR
|-
| 2

|-
| 1
| Spurious trip costs between 100k and 500k EUR
|-
| None
| Spurious trip costs between 0 and 100k EUR
|}

== STL levels ==
The STL level achieved by a safety function is determined by the probability of fail safe (PFS) of this safety function. The PFS value is determined by internal failures of the safety system that cause the safety function to be executed without a demand from the process. The table below demonstrates the PFS value and spurious trip reduction values of each STL level.

|-
| 1
| ≥10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; to &lt;10&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;
| 10
|}

== STL vs SIL ==
Today standards only define the [[safety integrity level]] (SIL) for safety functions. Standards do not define STL levels because they do in first instance not represent safety but economic loss. Despite this the STL is also a safety attribute, specially for safety functions in the process, oil &amp; gas, chemical and nuclear industry. In those industries an undesired shutdown of the process leads to dangerous situation as the plant needs to be started up again. Startup and shutdown of a process plant are considered the two most dangerous operational modes of the plant and should be limited to the absolute minimum.

In practice the STL and SIL concepts complement each other. Both factors are attributes of the same safety function. The STL level is determined by the average PFS value of the safety function. The SIL level is determined by the average probability of failure on demand. PFD value of the safety function. The STL level expresses the probability of spurious trips by the safety function, i.e., the safety function is executed without a demand from the process. The SIL level expresses the probability that the safety function does not work upon demand from the process. Both parameters are important to end-users in order to achieve safety and asset protection.

|}

In order to calculate the PFS or PFD value of a safety loop it is necessary to have a reliability model and reliability data for each component in the safety loop. The best reliability model to use is a Markov model (see [[Andrey Markov]]). Typical data required are:
* Lambda safe detected
* Lambda safe undetected
* Lambda dangerous detected
* Lambda dangerous undetected
* Repair rate
* Proof test coverage
* Proof test interval
* Common cause factors

The '''École française d'Extrême-Orient''' ({{IPA-fr|ekɔl fʁɑ̃sɛːz dɛkstʁɛm ɔʁjɑ̃|lang}}, ''French School of the Far East''), abbreviated '''EFEO''', is an associated college of [[PSL University]] dedicated to the study of Asian societies.  It was founded in 1900 with headquarters in [[Hanoi]] in what was then [[French Indochina]]. After the independence of Vietnam, its headquarters were transferred to [[Paris]]. Its main fields of research are [[archaeology]], [[philology]] and the study of modern Asian societies.
Since 1907, the EFEO has been in charge of conservation work at the archeological site of [[Angkor]].

== EFEO romanization system ==
{{main|EFEO Chinese transcription}}
A [[romanization]] system for [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] was developed by the EFEO. It shares a few similarities with [[Wade-Giles]] and [[pinyin|Hanyu Pinyin]]. In modern times, it has been superseded by Hanyu Pinyin.

The differences between the three romanization systems are shown in the following table:
