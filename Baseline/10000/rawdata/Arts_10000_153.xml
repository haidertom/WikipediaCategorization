The '''2011 Montreal Museum of Fine Arts theft''' took place in two separate incidents during September and October of that year. In both instances, the same thief took a small ancient stone piece that was openly exhibited, without a protective case, and smuggled it out of [[Montreal Museum of Fine Arts|the museum]]. One has since been recovered; however, the thief remains unidentified and the whereabouts of the other is not known.

On September 3, one day before the anniversary of [[1972 Montreal Museum of Fine Arts robbery|the 1972 robbery of 18 paintings]], a visitor took a [[sandstone]] [[Achaemenid Empire]] [[relief]]. In late October, he returned to take a Roman marble head from its pedestal. The two works were collectively valued at $1.3 million, with the relief accounting for almost all of that amount. 

The museum did not disclose the theft until February 2012 to avoid compromising the joint investigation by its insurance company and [[Sureté du Québec]]'s [[art theft]] unit. [[Security camera]] footage allowed them to obtain a description of the thief; investigators believed he was local. A reward was offered for the return of the works.

In 2013, police were led to Simon Metke, an [[Edmonton]] man who had bought the Achaemenid piece for [[Canadian dollar|CDN$]]1,400 during a visit to Montreal two years earlier, believing it to possibly be a replica, after it was seen on a wall behind him during a [[CBC News|CBC]] interview unrelated to the case.&lt;ref name="Simon Metke arrest"&gt;{{cite news|title=Stolen artifact from Montreal museum recovered in Edmonton|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/stolen-artifact-from-montreal-museum-recovered-in-edmonton-1.2535754|newspaper=[[CBC News]]|date=February 14, 2014|accessdate=August 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum ultimately declined to buy it back from their insurer and it was put on the market in late 2016.&lt;ref name="Royal Academy frieze page"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Charles Saumarez|last2=Philips|first2=Sam|title=What to see at Frieze 2016|url=https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/article/highlights-of-frieze-london-and-masters-2016|publisher=[[Royal Academy of Art]]|date=October 6, 2016|accessdate=August 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charges laid against Metke were disposed with a [[discharge (sentence)|conditional discharge]] after he pled guilty to [[Possession of stolen goods#Canada|possession of stolen property]]. Metke's story inspired a character in [[Kevin Smith]]'s 2016 film ''[[Yoga Hosers]]'', as well as the film's title.&lt;ref name="Globe and Mail Metke story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pruden|first=Jana|title=The Edmonton man who inspired 'Yoga Hoser' arrested for possession of a $1.2-million ancient statue|url=https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/news/alberta/simon-metke-the-man-thrust-into-a-strange-world-of-canadian-art-theft/article34855605/|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=April 28, 2017|accessdate=August 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thefts==
On September 3, 2011, a visitor who came to the museum shortly after it opened removed a {{convert|20|by|21|by|3|cm|in|adj=on}}&lt;ref name="2011 theft story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Knelman|first=Joshua|title=Two valuable artifacts stolen from Montreal museum|url=https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/arts/two-valuable-artifacts-stolen-from-montreal-museum/article546106/|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=February 14, 2012|accessdate=August 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[sandstone]] [[relief]] depicting a soldier's head, produced during the [[Achaemenid Empire]], which ruled Persia during the 5th century BCE.&lt;ref name="Press artifact return story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Montgomery|first=Sue|title=Police track down artifact stolen from Museum of Fine Arts|url=https://www.pressreader.com/canada/montreal-gazette/20140214/281651073005626|newspaper=[[Montreal Gazette]]||via=[[PressReader]]|date=February 14, 2014|accessdate=August 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was small and secured to the wall it was on only by an anchor, and otherwise unprotected by glass. The museum staff has not been able to determine how it was removed. Coincidentally, the theft occurred on the day before the 39th anniversary of the only other theft from the museum, the 1972 robbery of 18 paintings, all but one of which are still missing, the largest art theft in Canadian history.&lt;ref name="2011 theft story" /&gt;

The thief returned approximately eight weeks later, in late October, at the same time of day. This time he took a 1st-century Roman marble head, approximately the same size, from its pedestal. Like the earlier piece, it was secured there by an anchor, but otherwise unprotected, not even by a glass case.&lt;ref name="2011 theft story" /&gt;

==Investigation==

}}
When it discovered the pieces, both of which were part of the museum's permanent [[Collection (artwork)|collection]], missing, the museum called the [[Sureté du Québec]]'s (SQ) [[art theft]] unit, the only one in any Canadian provincial police force, and [[AXA]], its insurance company, which also dispatched a team of art-theft specialists. They investigated the case jointly. After reviewing [[security camera]] footage and interviewing museum staff who had been on duty the days of the thefts, they identified a suspect, a man {{convert|5|ft|7|in|cm}} tall who wore a baseball cap and dark jacket as he walked around the museum. They believed he spoke French and lived in the Montreal area.&lt;ref name="2011 theft story" /&gt;

The museum did not publicly disclose the thefts until January 2012 in order to avoid compromising the investigation. When it did inform the news media, it released a description of the suspect and offered rewards for both the thief's identity and the safe return of the missing items.&lt;ref name="2011 theft story" /&gt; It put their combined value at $1.3 million, most of which was accounted for by the older, Achaemenid piece, with the Roman head valued at a mere $40,000.&lt;ref name="CTV recovery story"&gt;{{cite news|title=Police recover item stolen from Fine Arts Museum|url=http://montreal.ctvnews.ca/man-who-bought-stolen-artwork-didn-t-know-it-was-worth-1-2-million-1.1684657|newspaper=[[CTV Television Network|CTV]]|date=February 14, 2014|accessdate=August 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Fossey, an archaeologist, told [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] later that he believed the two pieces had not been stolen to order but simply because they were "small [and] easy to put in the bag."&lt;ref name="CTV recovery story" /&gt; Another expert involved, art-theft investigator Mark Dalrymple, observed that the case was similar to a series of 2004 thefts from the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]] in [[Toronto]], which also involved small objects taken by visitors while the museum was open to the public, objects whose return he had secured. He said the museum was preparing photos for dissemination worldwide. "[N]o matter where in the world these pieces go, no one can sell them", he told ''[[The Globe and Mail]]''. He advised anyone in possession of the missing art to return it immediately.&lt;ref name="2011 theft story" /&gt;

===Sale of relief===
Unbeknownst to Dalrymple or any of the other investigators, by the time he made that statement at least one of the missing pieces had already been sold. In November 2011 Simon Metke, a [[Yoga as exercise|yoga]] teacher from [[Edmonton]], travelled to Montreal for a visit.&lt;ref name="CTV recovery story" /&gt; A friend of his there had told him that someone he knew was selling what he described as a stone sculpture of a soldier, claiming it was a genuine antiquity. As a result of his own recent spiritual explorations, Metke had developed an interest in ancient cultures, and the friend thought he might be interested in buying the sculpture.&lt;ref name="Globe and Mail Metke story" /&gt;
[[File:Achaemenid relief of guard in Montreal Museum of Fine Arts.jpg|right|thumb|The stolen Achaemenid relief that Metke believed was merely a replica|alt=A stone panel with the head of a bearded man seen in profile, the top of his shield, and an upright spear tip on the left]]
When Metke finally saw the sculpture, actually the Achaemenid [[relief]] that had been stolen from the museum a few months earlier, he was at first skeptical. He believed it might actually be a replica, something that he might otherwise find at modern stores that sell home decor. But he appreciated the workmanship that had gone into it.&lt;ref name="CTV recovery story" /&gt;

The seller's asking price was [[Canadian dollar|CDN$]]1,400. According to Metke's friend, the seller was motivated. "This other guy had to pay his child support you know and pay his rent," Metke recalled later. "He edged me on that it was worth a bunch more."&lt;ref name="CTV recovery story" /&gt;

Still, Metke had some lingering doubts about the item. So he did a [[Google]] search on "Are there any [[Mesopotamian]] artifacts missing?" After he had satisfied himself from the results that he was not buying something looted or stolen, he bought the item, believing that, with [[2012 phenomenon|2012]], the last year in the [[Mayan Calendar]], a month away, it was his destiny to acquire the artwork.&lt;ref name="Globe and Mail Metke story" /&gt; "It symbolized part of my spiritual journey to me."&lt;ref name="CBC arrest story"&gt;{{cite news|title=Stolen artifact from Montreal museum recovered in Edmonton|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/stolen-artifact-from-montreal-museum-recovered-in-edmonton-1.2535754|newspaper=[[CBC News]]|date=February 14, 2014|accessdate=August 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He thought "it would have been kind of fun" to take it to an ''[[Antiques Roadshow]]'' production, or go to the [[Middle East]] himself and have it authenticated. For the time being, he packed the piece in his luggage and flew with it back to Edmonton, where the airline briefly lost the suitcase containing the relief upon his arrival. Once it was located, he took it home and put it in a [[meditation]] area he had set up in his living room.&lt;ref name="Globe and Mail Metke story" /&gt;

Later he moved it to a shelf in his bedroom, where he put it amid a collection of ''[[Star Wars (franchise)|Star Wars]]'' action figures, crystals and stuffed animals.&lt;ref name="Globe and Mail Metke story" /&gt; A month after returning to Edmonton, he gave an interview to a [[CBC News]] crew for a story unrelated to the artwork he had just purchased. It was, however, visible on the shelf behind him in some shots.&lt;ref name="CBC arrest story" /&gt;

==Recovery of relief and arrests==
The interview eventually led to a tip to police. In late 2013 they obtained a [[search warrant|warrant to search]] Metke's Edmonton condominium, and in January 2014 executed it. "The sun's coming in through the window, the bougainvillea flowers are glowing, the crystals are making rainbows," recalled Metke.&lt;ref name="Globe and Mail Metke story" /&gt;

A team of [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP) from both [[Alberta]] and [[Quebec]], along with the SQ/AXA investigators, quickly located the relief. It was only then that Metke learned it had been stolen, and was indeed an authentic antique artifact 2,500 years old, not a replica. "I don't think he knew it was worth $1.2 million dollars either," he said of the seller.&lt;ref name="CTV recovery story" /&gt; He felt, again, that it was destiny that had brought the relief to him. "[I]t sort of feels like it may have come to me to be protected so that it didn't get destroyed or lost."&lt;ref name="CBC Metke story"&gt;{{cite news|title=Man accused of owning stolen artifact tells his story|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/man-accused-of-owning-stolen-artifact-tells-his-story-1.2536685|newspaper=[[CBC News]]|date=February 13, 2014|accessdate=August 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the arrest, police suggested they had some leads on the identity of the thief.&lt;ref name="CTV recovery story" /&gt; However, as of 2017 no arrests have been made. The whereabouts of the Roman head are also unknown.&lt;ref name="Globe and Mail Metke story" /&gt;

Police charged Metke with [[Possession of stolen goods#Canada|possession of stolen property over $5,000 in value]], possession of the proceeds of a crime, and possessing a controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking, after they also found drugs in the residence. Metke's girlfriend faced the former two charges related to the relief as well.&lt;ref name="CBC arrest story" /&gt; Fossey, who was in Edmonton that day as well, flew home to Montreal with the relief that night. "It's a day I'll never forget, flying back with it in a box at my feet," he said later.&lt;ref name="Press artifact return story" /&gt; 

The museum, however, would have to consider whether to buy it back from AXA, since once it was recovered it became the insurer's legal property; commonly a buyback clause in the policy allows a museum to do this by returning the money paid. The board said it would meet to consider the possibility.&lt;ref name="Artnet recovery story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kinsella|first=Eileen|title=Stolen Artifact Returned to Montreal Museum ... But How Long Will It Remain There?|url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/stolen-artifact-returned-to-montreal-museum-but-how-long-will-it-remain-there-1942|newspaper=[[Artnet]]|date=February 22, 2014|accessdate=August 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It decided not to, and in 2016 it was offered for sale at the [[Frieze Art Fair]]&lt;ref name="Royal Academy frieze page" /&gt; for £2.2 million.&lt;ref name="Guardian Frieze story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Jones|first=Jonathan|authorlink=Jonathan Jones (journalist)|title=Frieze Masters review – for the billionaire who has everything, what about a Magritte?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/oct/05/frieze-masters-2016-review-regents-park|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=October 5, 2016|accessdate=August 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial==
The Crown later [[Stay of proceedings|stayed]] two of the three charges against Metke, and all that it had laid against his girlfriend. In April 2017, he pled guilty to the possession of stolen goods charge. A statement of facts his lawyers agreed on with prosecutors said that while he clearly was unaware the relief had been stolen, he could have done more to assure himself of its [[provenance]]. In return the judge gave him a [[discharge (sentence)|conditional discharge]] with [[probation]] and [[community service]]. Both sides described the case as "unique" and "extraordinary".&lt;ref name="Globe and Mail Metke story" /&gt;

==''Yoga Hosers''==
At the time of Metke's arrest, American filmmaker [[Kevin Smith]] discussed the story on his [[podcast]], ''[[SModcast]]'', amused by Metke's description of the bougainvillea and crystals that morning. His co-host, [[Scott Mosier]], imagined how the RCMP might have spoken to Metke, saying "Open up, yoga [[hoser]]!" The last two words became a minor [[catchphrase]] among their fans.&lt;ref name="Globe and Mail Metke story" /&gt;

In April, Smith announced he was working on a screenplay called ''[[Yoga Hosers]]''. He completed the film in time for the January 2016 [[Sundance Film Festival]]. It was not based on Metke's story, but one character in the film, a [[yoga as exercise|yoga]] instructor named Yogi Bayer, was inspired by Metke. [[Justin Long]], who played Bayer, attempted to contact Metke while preparing for the role; Metke did not respond until after Long had shot his scenes.&lt;ref name="Globe and Mail Metke story" /&gt;

'''''A sergeant of the Light Horse''''' is a [[1920 in art|1920]] painting by Australian artist [[George Washington Lambert]]. The portrait depicts an Australian soldier in Palestine during [[World War I]]. The [[National Gallery of Victoria]] states that the work is "recognised as an image that captured the spirit and character of the Australian soldier".&lt;ref name=FollowTheFlag&gt;{{cite web|title=Follow the Flag: Australian Artists at War 1914 – 45|url=https://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/media_release/follow-the-flag-australian-artists-at-war-1914-45/|publisher=National Gallery of Victoria|accessdate=25 July 2015|date=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subject==
The sitter for the portrait was Thomas Herbert (Harry) Ivers, a [[sergeant]] with the 1st Signal Squadron of the [[Australian Light Horse]]. Lambert met Ivers, a map maker, in Damascus in 1919 and later Ivers was granted permission to assist Lambert in London. The portrait was painted in Lambert's studio in Kensington, London.&lt;ref name=AWM&gt;{{cite web|title=George Lambert 1873 - 1930|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/exhibitions/forging/ww1/lambert.asp|work=Forging the Nation: Federation - the First 20 years|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=4 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
When composing the work, Lambert deliberately set out to "created a new model for the military portrait" eschewing the heroic and dashing soldier on horseback. The painting was intended to represent the typical Australian light horseman&amp;mdash;mainly men from the farms, dairies and orchards across rural Australia.&lt;ref name=AWM /&gt; War correspondent [[Henry Gullett|H.S. Gullett]] wrote of the Australian lighthorseman: "So far as a distinctive type has been evolved it is … young men long of limb and feature, spare of flesh, easy and almost tired in bearing ... He bears himself modestly ... A felt slouch hat, a shirt with sleeves rolled to the elbows, long trousers".&lt;ref name=NGA /&gt;

Reviewing the painting for an exhibition of Lambert's works in 2007, the [[National Gallery of Australia]] noted that "Lambert gave this serviceman a sensuousness through his sharp-focus rendering of flesh and musculature, and in the way he portrayed the taut neck and wiry arms."&lt;ref name=NGA&gt;{{cite web|title=A sergeant of the Light Horse|url=http://nga.gov.au/Exhibition/Lambert/Detail.cfm?IRN=162564|work=George W Lambert Retrospective|publisher=National Gallery of Australia|accessdate=4 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hans Heysen]] observed, "the feeling way the eyes have been painted and the expression of that sensitiveness around the mouth are truly wonderful".&lt;ref name=NGA/&gt;

The portrait palette, and other features such as the downward look and slender neck, were influenced by the artist's appreciation of the works of [[Botticelli]].&lt;ref name=NGA /&gt;

==History==
The portrait was purchased for the [[National Gallery of Victoria]] from the [[Felton Bequest]] in 1921, on the advice of its director Bernard Hall.&lt;ref name=NGA /&gt; The painting remains part of the National Gallery of Victoria's Australian art collection.&lt;ref name=NGV&gt;{{cite web|title=A sergeant of the Light Horse|url=http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/col/work/5822|publisher=National Gallery of Victoria|accessdate=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was part of the National Gallery of Victoria's ''Follow the Flag'' exhibition in 2015, marking the centenary of [[ANZAC Day]].&lt;ref name=FollowTheFlag /&gt;

The painting appeared on a stamp in 1974.&lt;ref name=NGA /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3453">The '''Adolph and Esther Gottlieb Foundation''' was established in 1976. It is an [[United States|American]] nonprofit organization that provides funding for the arts. 
==History==
The Gottlieb Foundation was established after [[Adolph Gottlieb]]’s death in 1974. Esther Gottlieb, his widow, was the founder and president of the Foundation. She set up the Foundation in 1976 at the bequest of her husband according to provisions in his will with assets of some $6 million derived from the sale of his works.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/23/obituaries/esther-gottlieb-is-dead-art-fund-head-was-81.html ''NY Times''. 'Obituaries. Esther Gottlieb is Dead. Art fund Head was 81']&lt;/ref&gt; During his lifetime, Gottlieb was very generous to other artists and often provided loans to artists during times of crisis and need. He became acutely aware of artists’ needs, especially during times of emergency. It was Gottlieb’s wish that his legacy of giving to fellow artists was continued after his death.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20140812020123/http://www.independent-magazine.org/node/2008/print "Funder FAQ: The Adolph and Esther Gottlieb Society Foundation". Independent Magazine. 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; Esther Gottlieb died in 1988 at the age of eighty-one. Sandford Hirsch is currently Executive Director of the Foundation.
 
==Activities==
The Foundation offers grants to painters, sculptors and printmakers through two programmes: an annual Individual Support Grant and a separate programme to assist visual artists in cases of catastrophic events. The Individual Support Grant has a fixed annual deadline: "The Foundation wishes to encourage artists who have dedicated their lives to developing their art, regardless of their level of commercial success. This program was conceived in order to recognize and support the serious, fully-committed artist".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://gottliebfoundation.org/grants/individual-grants/ |title=Gottlieb Foundation |access-date=2014-08-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811065557/http://gottliebfoundation.org/grants/individual-grants/ |archive-date=2014-08-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Twelve of these grants are awarded each year. The Emergency Grant application has no fixed deadline. 

The Foundation also maintains an archive on the art and life of [[Adolph Gottlieb]] and organizes exhibitions of his work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/exhibitions/1184/The_Pictographs_of_Adolph_Gottlieb Brooklyn Museum. The Pictographs of Adolph Gottlieb.]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4234">'''Baile Chuind Chétchathaig''' ("The Vision of [[Conn of the Hundred Battles]]") is an [[Old Irish]] list of [[Kings of Tara]] or [[list of High Kings of Ireland|High Kings of Ireland]] which survives in two 16th-century manuscripts, [[23 N 10]] and [[Egerton 88]]. It is the earliest such king-list known, probably dating from around 700 AD. The later ''[[Baile In Scáil]]'' is closely related.

==Date==
Baile Chuind Chétchathaig was first edited by [[Rudolf Thurneysen]], who dated it to about 700 AD and believed it to have been included in the lost ''[[Cín Dromma Snechtai]]'' manuscript. Thurneysen later revised this opinion on the basis of the content of the poem, supposing that the poem's "Glúnshalach" represented 10th-century king [[Niall Glúndub]]. Later editors and writers have generally preferred Thurneysen's first estimate, taking the work to have been begun in the lifetime of [[Fínsnechta Fledach]] (died 695).&lt;ref&gt;Murray, "Manuscript Tradition", p. 69; Bhreathnach &amp; Murray, "Edition", p. 73; Bhreathnach, "Political Context", pp. 49 &amp; 61&amp;ndash;62; Byrne, ''Irish Kings'', p. 54; Charles-Edwards, ''Early Christian Ireland'', p. 483.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent studies [[Edel Bhreathnach]] has suggested that the current form of the poem may be somewhat later. While the kings who follow Fínsnechta were previously interpreted as imagined future kings, Bhreathnach suggests that these are in fact historical figures from the first quarter of the eighth century disguised by [[kenning]]s. If this is correct, the poem as a whole dates from around 720 or  was revised at about that time.&lt;ref&gt;Bhreathnach, "Political Context", p. 50; Murray, "Manuscript Tradition", p. 70; Mac Shamhráin &amp; Byrne, "Prosopography", pp. 159 &amp; 204&amp;ndash;212.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Balthasar Riepp''' (22 November 1703, [[Kempten]] - 2 August 1764 in [[Vils, Tyrol|Vils]]) was a German-Austrian painter, primarily of religious subjects.

== Life ==
Riepp's father was a servant at the Fürstäbtliche Residenz (a monastery complex) in Kempten. [[Prince-abbot]] {{ill|Rupert von Bodman|de}} helped provide him with a basic education, which included drawing lessons from the [[court painter]] Franz Benedikt Hermann (1664-1735).&lt;ref name="N"&gt;{{NDB|21|603|604|Riepp, Balthasar|Peter Prange|121618714}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1725, after some time as an apprentice to {{ill|Jacob Carl Stauder|de}} he took a two-year study trip to Italy, courtesy of a stipend from {{ill|Anselm Reichlin von Meldegg|de}}, the new Prince-abbott.&lt;ref name="N" /&gt;

In 1728, Riepp was offered employment in the highly successful workshop of [[Paul Zeiller]] in [[Reutte]]. Seven years later, he married Zeiller's daughter, Maria Anna. By that time, he was a sought-after artist with students of his own. In 1738, when Zeiller died, Riepp took over management of his art school.

In 1740, shortly after obtaining his Bürgerrechtes (citizenship) in Reutte, Riepp's only child Johann Anton Laurentius died.&lt;ref name="A" /&gt; He began drinking heavily, which led to a separation from his wife and, as his condition worsened, he was accused of offending [[public morals]]. Soon, he felt it was necessary to leave Reutte. His dependence on alcohol, combined with his generosity toward the needy, slowly reduced him to poverty and homelessness. He died in an [[emergency shelter]] in Vils.&lt;ref name="A"&gt;[http://www.ausserferner.net/region/person/riepp.php Biography and Paintings] @ Alpic.net Community.&lt;/ref&gt;

Streets in Reutte and [[Biberbach, Bavaria|Biberbach]] have been named in Riepp's honor. For the 300th anniversary of his birth in 2003, an exhibition called ''Genie im Schatten'' (Genius in the Shadows) toured Kempten, Reutte, [[Breitenwang]] and Vils.

Used extensively in [[bookbinding]], a '''board shear''' is a large, hand-operated machine for cutting board or paper.  Like [[scissors]], a board shear uses two blades to apply [[shear stress]] exceeding the paper's [[shear strength]] in order to cut.  The stationary blade forms the edge of the cutting table, with the moving blade mounted on a cutting arm.  Originally known as a table gauge shear because its gauge allowed the cutting of consistently-sized materials, the board shear resembles a larger version of the paper cutters commonly found in offices.

The earliest known reference to a board shear comes from an 1842 supplement to ''[[Penny Magazine]]'', titled ''A Day at a Bookbinder's'', which included a drawing of a board shear with many of the major developments already present.  An 1854 article on the history of bookbinding from ''The Bookbinder's Trade Circular'' describes early board shears, and places their development in "about 1836"; credit for the invention is ascribed to Warren De La Rue in the ''Reports of the Juries'' from the [[Great Exhibition|Great Exhibition of 1851]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Middleton |first=Bernard |title=A History of English Craft Bookbinding Technique |publisher=Oak Knoll Press &amp; [[British Library|The British Library]] |year=1996 |pages=232–234 |isbn=1-884718-28-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many modifications of the basic design were made in the 19th century, with changes such as rack-and-pinion adjustment for the outer gauge&lt;ref&gt;Brombacher, C. U.S. Patent 43634, 1864.&lt;/ref&gt; and improved clamp bars.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, J.T. U.S. Patent 225871, 1880.&lt;/ref&gt;  By the late 19th century, board shears were substantively the same as modern machines, and many 19th-century board shears are still in use today.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

'''Cabinets of curiosities''' (also known in [[German language|German]] loanwords as '''Kunstkabinett''', '''Kunstkammer''' or '''Wunderkammer'''; also '''Cabinets of Wonder''', and '''wonder-rooms''') were encyclopedic collections of objects the categorical boundaries of which were, in [[Renaissance]] [[Europe]], yet to be defined. Modern terminology would categorize the objects included as belonging to [[natural history]] (sometimes faked), [[geology]], [[ethnography]], [[archaeology]], religious or historical [[relic]]s, works of art (including  [[cabinet painting]]s), and [[antiquities]]. "The Kunstkammer was regarded as a [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]] or theater of the world, and a memory theater. The Kunstkammer conveyed symbolically the patron's control of the world through its indoor, microscopic reproduction."&lt;ref&gt;Francesaco Fiorani, reviewing Bredecamp 1995 in ''Renaissance Quarterly'' '''51'''.1  (Spring 1998:268-270) p 268.&lt;/ref&gt; Of [[Charles I of England]]'s collection, Peter Thomas states succinctly, "The ''Kunstkabinett'' itself was a form of propaganda."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, "Charles I of England: The tragedy of Absolutism", A.G. Dickens, ed. ''The Courts of Europe'' (London) 1977:201.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the most famous, best documented cabinets of rulers and aristocrats, members of the merchant class and early practitioners of [[science]] in [[Europe]] formed collections that were precursors to [[museum]]s.

The term ''[[Cabinet (architecture)|cabinet]]'' originally described a room rather than a [[Cabinet (furniture)|piece of furniture]]. The classic cabinet of curiosities emerged in the sixteenth century, although more rudimentary collections had existed earlier. The Kunstkammer of [[Rudolf&amp;nbsp;II, Holy Roman Emperor]] (ruled 1576–1612), housed in the [[Hradschin]] at Prague, was unrivalled north of the Alps; it provided a solace and retreat for contemplation&lt;ref&gt;This is the secretive aspect emphasised by R.&amp;nbsp;J.&amp;nbsp;W. Evans, ''Rudolf&amp;nbsp;II and His World: A Study in Intellectual History'' (Oxford) 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; that also served to demonstrate his imperial magnificence and power in symbolic arrangement of their display, ceremoniously presented to visiting diplomats and magnates.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas DaCosta Kaufmann, "Remarks on the Collections of Rudolf&amp;nbsp;II: The Kunstkammer as a Form of Representatio",&lt;!--Representatio is correct--&gt; ''Art Journal'' '''38'''.1 (Autumn 1978:22–28).&lt;/ref&gt; Rudolf's uncle, [[Ferdinand&amp;nbsp;II, Archduke of Austria]], also had a collection, with a special emphasis on paintings of people with interesting deformities, which remains largely intact as the [[Chamber of Art and Curiosities]] at [[Ambras Castle]] in Austria.

==History==
[[Image:RitrattoMuseoFerranteImperato.jpg|thumb|left|Fold-out engraving from [[Ferrante Imperato]]'s ''Dell'Historia Naturale'' (Naples 1599), the earliest illustration of a natural history cabinet]]
[[Image:Frans Francken d. J. 009.jpg|thumb|left|A corner of a cabinet, painted by [[Frans II Francken]] in 1636 reveals the range of connoisseurship a Baroque-era ''[[virtuoso]]'' might evince]]
The earliest pictorial record of a natural history cabinet is the engraving in [[Ferrante Imperato]]'s ''Dell'Historia Naturale'' (Naples 1599) (''illustration, left''). It serves to authenticate its author's credibility as a source of natural history information, in showing his open bookcases at the right, in which many volumes are stored lying down and stacked, in the medieval fashion, or with their spines upward, to protect the pages from dust. Some of the volumes doubtless represent his [[herbarium]]. Every surface of the vaulted ceiling is occupied with preserved fishes, stuffed mammals and curious shells, with a stuffed crocodile suspended in the centre. Examples of corals stand on the bookcases. At the left, the room is fitted out like a ''studiolo''&lt;ref&gt;''Studiolo'': the small retreats in the palaces of Urbino and Gubbio were inlaid with [[intarsia]] that figured just such fitted cabinets with feigned lattice doors and shelves filled with scientific instruments, books and small sculptures in ''trompe-l'oeil'' perspective. The Gubbio ''studiolo'' has been reassembled at the [[Metropolitan Museum]]; the Urbino ''studiolo'' remains in situ.&lt;/ref&gt; with a range of built-in cabinets whose fronts can be unlocked and let down to reveal intricately fitted nests of pigeonholes forming architectural units, filled with small mineral specimens.&lt;ref&gt;Sixteenth-century cabinet-makers serving the luxury trades of [[Florence]] and [[Antwerp]] were beginning to produce moveable cabinets with similar architectural interior fittings, which could be set upon a carpet-covered table or on a purpose-built stand.&lt;/ref&gt; Above them, stuffed birds stand against panels inlaid with square polished stone samples, doubtless marbles and jaspers or fitted with pigeonhole compartments for specimens. Below them, a range of cupboards contain specimen boxes and covered jars.

In 1587 Gabriel Kaltemarckt advised [[Christian&amp;nbsp;I of Saxony]] that three types of item were indispensable in forming a "Kunstkammer" or art collection: firstly sculptures and paintings; secondly "curious items from home or abroad"; and thirdly "antlers, horns, claws, feathers and other things belonging to strange and curious animals".&lt;ref&gt;B. Gutfleish and J. Menzhausen, "How a Kunstkammer Should Be Formed", ''Journal of the History of Collections'', 1989 Vol I: p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Albrecht Dürer]] visited the [[Netherlands]] in 1521, apart from artworks he sent back to [[Nuremberg]] various animal horns, a piece of [[coral]], some large fish fins and a wooden weapon from the [[East Indies]].&lt;ref&gt;A Hyatt Mayor, ''Prints and People'', Metropolitan Museum of Art/Princeton, 1971, nos 48.{{ISBN|0-691-00326-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highly characteristic range of interests represented in  [[Frans II Francken]]'s painting of 1636 (''illustration, left'') shows paintings on the wall that range from landscapes, including a moonlit scene—a genre in itself—to a portrait and a religious picture (the ''[[Adoration of the Magi]]'') intermixed with preserved tropical marine fish and a string of carved beads, most likely [[amber]], which is both precious and a natural curiosity. Sculpture both classical and secular (the sacrificing ''Libera'', a Roman fertility goddess)&lt;ref&gt;Her base is inscribed LIBER[A]&lt;/ref&gt; on the one hand and modern and religious (''Christ at the Column''&lt;ref&gt;It appears to represent a reduction of a well-known sculpture by [[Alessandro Algardi]].&lt;/ref&gt;) are represented, while on the table are ranged, among the exotic shells (including some tropical ones and a shark's tooth): [[portrait miniature]]s, gem-stones mounted with pearls in a curious quatrefoil box, a set of sepia [[Chiaroscuro|chiaroscuro woodcuts]] or drawings, and a small [[still-life]] painting&lt;ref&gt;Still life was considered a [[hierarchy of genres|lesser genre]] than even portraits or landscapes.&lt;/ref&gt; leaning against a flower-piece, coins and medals—presumably Greek and Roman—and Roman terracotta oil-lamps, a Chinese-style brass lock, curious flasks, and a blue-and-white Ming porcelain bowl.

Two of the most famously described seventeenth-century cabinets were those of [[Ole Worm]], known as Olaus Wormius (1588–1654) (''illustration, above right''), and [[Athanasius Kircher]] (1602–1680). These seventeenth-century cabinets were filled with preserved animals, horns, tusks, skeletons, minerals, as well as other interesting man-made objects: sculptures wondrously old, wondrously fine or wondrously small; clockwork [[automaton|automata]]; ethnographic specimens from exotic locations. Often they would contain a mix of fact and fiction, including apparently [[mythology|mythical]] creatures. Worm's collection contained, for example, what he thought was a [[Vegetable Lamb of Tartary|Scythian Lamb]], a woolly [[fern]] thought to be a plant/sheep fabulous creature. However he was also responsible for identifying the [[narwhal]]'s tusk as coming from a whale rather than a [[unicorn]], as most owners of these believed. The specimens displayed were often collected during exploring expeditions and trading voyages.

In the second half of the 18th century, [[Belsazar Hacquet]] (c. 1735–1815) operated in [[Ljubljana]], then the capital of [[Carniola]], a natural history cabinet ({{lang-de|Naturalienkabinet}}) that was appreciated throughout Europe and was visited by the highest nobility, including the Holy Roman Emperor, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], the Russian grand duke [[Paul I of Russia|Paul]] and [[Pope Pius VI]], as well as by famous naturalists, such as {{Interlanguage link multi|Francesco Griselini|it}} and {{Interlanguage link multi|Franz Benedikt Hermann|de|3=Franz Benedikt Hermann (Geologe)}}. It included a number of minerals, including specimens of mercury from the [[Idrija mercury mine|Idrija mine]], a ''[[herbarium vivum]]'' with over 4,000 specimens of Carniolan and foreign plants, a smaller number of animal specimens, a natural history and medical library, and an [[anatomical theatre]].&lt;ref name=Jezernik&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.dlib.si/details/URN:NBN:SI:DOC-IARZL5AU |title=Ljubljanske »knjige sveta« od Auerspergov do Hacqueta |first=Božidar |last=Jezernik |year=2009 |language=Slovenian, English|trans-title=Ljubljana's "Books of the World" – from the Auerspergs to Hacquet |journal=Etnolog |id={{COBISS|ID=1242502}} |volume=19=70 |pages=23–33 |issn=0354-0316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cabinets of curiosities would often serve scientific advancement when images of their contents were published. The catalog of Worm's collection, published as the ''Museum Wormianum'' (1655), used the collection of artifacts as a starting point for Worm's speculations on philosophy, science, natural history, and more.

Cabinets of curiosities were limited to those who could afford to create and maintain them. Many [[monarch]]s, in particular, developed large collections. A rather under-used example, stronger in art than other areas, was the [[Studiolo of Francesco&amp;nbsp;I]], the first Medici Grand-Duke of Tuscany. [[Frederick&amp;nbsp;III of Denmark]], who added Worm's collection to his own after Worm's death, was another such monarch. A third example is the [[Kunstkamera]] founded by [[Peter the Great]] in [[Saint Petersburg]] in 1714. Many items were bought in Amsterdam from [[Albertus Seba]] and [[Frederik Ruysch]]. The fabulous [[Habsburg]] Imperial collection included important [[Aztec]] artifacts, including the [[Montezuma's headdress|feather head-dress]] or crown of [[Moctezuma II|Montezuma]] now in the [[Vienna Museum of Ethnology|Museum of Ethnology, Vienna]]. 
[[File:Berlin Naturkundemuseum Korallen.jpg|thumb|left|upright|An early eighteenth-century German  ''Schrank'' with a traditional display of [[coral]]s (Naturkundenmuseum Berlin)]]

Similar collections on a smaller scale were the complex ''Kunstschränke'' produced in the early seventeenth century by the [[Augsburg]] merchant, diplomat and collector [[Philipp Hainhofer]]. These were cabinets in the sense of pieces of furniture, made from all imaginable exotic and expensive materials and filled with contents and ornamental details intended to reflect the entire cosmos on a miniature scale. The best preserved example is the one given by the city of Augsburg to King [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]] in 1632, which is kept in the [[Gustavianum|Museum Gustavianum]] in [[Uppsala]]. The [[curio cabinet]], as a modern single piece of furniture, is a version of the grander historical examples.

The juxtaposition of such disparate objects, according to Horst Bredekamp's analysis (Bredekamp 1995), encouraged comparisons, finding analogies and parallels and favoured the cultural change from a world viewed as static to a dynamic view of endlessly transforming natural history and a historical perspective that led in the seventeenth century to the germs of a scientific view of reality.

A late example of the juxtaposition of natural materials with richly worked artifice is provided by the [[Grünes Gewölbe]], the "Green Vaults" formed by [[Augustus the Strong]] in [[Dresden]] to display his chamber of wonders.  The "Enlightenment Gallery" in the [[British Museum]], installed in the former "Kings Library" room in 2003 to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the museum, aims to recreate the abundance and diversity that still characterized museums in the mid-eighteenth century, mixing shells, rock samples and botanical specimens with a great variety of artworks and other man-made objects from all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/galleries/themes/room_1_enlightenment.aspx |title=Enlightenment Gallery at the British Museum |publisher=Britishmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In seventeenth-century parlance, both French and English, a ''cabinet'' came to signify a collection of works of art, which might still also include an assembly objects of ''[[virtù]]'' or curiosities, such as a ''[[virtuoso]]'' would find intellectually stimulating. In 1714, [[Michael Bernhard Valentini]] published an early [[Museology|museological]] work, ''Museum Museorum'', an account of the cabinets known to him with catalogues of their contents.

Some strands of the early universal collections, the bizarre or freakish biological specimens, whether genuine or fake, and the more exotic historical objects, could find a home in commercial [[freak show]]s and [[sideshows]].

[[Sir Hans Sloane]] (1660–1753) was an English physician, a member of the [[Royal Society]] and the [[Royal College of Physicians]], and the founder of the [[British Museum]] in London. He began sporadically collecting plants in England and France while studying medicine. In 1687, the [[Duke of Albemarle]] offered Sloane a position as personal physician to the West Indies fleet at Jamaica. He accepted and spent fifteen months collecting and cataloguing the native plants, animals, and artificial curiosities (e.g. cultural artifacts of native and African populations) of Jamaica. This became the basis for his two volume work, ''Natural History of Jamaica'', published in 1707 and 1725. Sloane returned to England in 1689 with over eight hundred specimens of plants, which were live or mounted on heavy paper in an eight-volume herbarium. He also attempted to bring back live animals (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;snakes, an alligator, and an iguana) but they all died before reaching England.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Edward P. ''Museum Masters: Their Museums and Their Influence'', (Walnut Creek, London, New Delhi: AltaMira Press, 1995), 20–42; Clark, Jack A. " Sir Hans Sloane and Abbé Jean Paul Bignon: Notes on Collection Building in the Eighteenth Century," in ''The Library Quarterly'', Vol. 50, No. 4 (October 1980), 475–482; de Beer, G.&amp;nbsp;R. "Sir Hans Sloane, F.R.S 1660–1753," in ''Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London'', Vol. 10, No. 2 (April 1953), 81–84; and [[Kay Dian Kriz|Kriz, Kay Dian]]. "Curiosities, Commodities, and Transplanted Bodies in Hans Sloane's "Natural History of Jamaica", in ''The William and Mary Quarterly'', Third Series, Vol. 57, No. 1 (January 2000), 35–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sloane meticulously cataloged and created extensive records for most of the specimens and objects in his collection. He also began to acquire other collections by gift or purchase. [[Herman Boerhaave]] gave him four volumes of plants from Boerhaave's gardens at Leiden. William Charleton, in a bequest in 1702, gave Sloane numerous books of birds, fish, flowers, and shells and his miscellaneous museum consisting of curiosities, miniatures, insects, medals, animals, minerals, precious stones and curiosities in amber. Sloane purchased [[Leonard Plukenet]]'s collection in 1710. It consisted of twenty-three volumes with over 8,000 plants from Africa, India, Japan and China. [[Mary Somerset, Duchess of Beaufort (1630–1715)]], left him a twelve-volume herbarium from her gardens at Chelsea and Badminton upon her death in 1714. Reverend [[Adam Buddle]] gave Sloane thirteen volumes of British plants. In 1716, Sloane purchased Englebert Kaempfer's volume of Japanese plants and [[James Petiver]]'s virtual museum of approximately one hundred volumes of plants from Europe, North America, Africa, the Near East, India, and the Orient. [[Mark Catesby]] gave him plants from North America and the West Indies from an expedition funded by Sloane. [[Philip Miller]] gave him twelve volumes of plants grown from the [[Chelsea Physic Garden]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Edward P. ''Museum Masters: Their Museums and Their Influence'', (Walnut Creek, London, New Delhi: AltaMira Press, 1995), 20–42; de Beer, G. R. "Sir Hans Sloane, F.R.S 1660–1753," in ''Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London'', Vol. 10, No. 2 (April 1953), 81–84; Gray, Basil. "Sloane and the Kaempfer Collection," in ''The British Museum Quarterly'', Vol. 18, No. 1, Sir Hans Sloane (March 1953), 20–23; and "The Sloane Collection of Manuscripts" in ''The British Museum Quarterly'', Vol. 18, No. 1, Sir Hans Sloane (March 1953), 6–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sloane acquired approximately three hundred and fifty artificial curiosities from North American Indians, Eskimos, South America, the Lapland, Siberia, East Indies, and the West Indies, including nine items from Jamaica.
"These ethnological artifacts were important because they established a field of collection for the British Museum that was to increase greatly with the explorations of Captain [[James Cook]] in Oceania and Australia and the rapid expansion of the [[British Empire]]."&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Edward P. ''Museum Masters: Their Museums and Their Influence'', (Walnut Creek, London, New Delhi: AltaMira Press, 1995), 31.&lt;/ref&gt;
Upon his death in 1753, Sloane bequeathed his sizable collection of 337 volumes to England for £20,000. In 1759, [[George II of Great Britain|George II]]'s royal library was added to Sloane’s collection to form the foundation of the British Museum.

[[John Tradescant the elder]] (circa 1570s–1638) was a gardener, naturalist, and botanist in the employ of the Duke of Buckingham. He collected plants, bulbs, flowers, vines, berries, and fruit trees from Russia, the Levant, Algiers, France, Bermuda, the Caribbean, and the East Indies. His son, [[John Tradescant the younger]] (1608–1662) traveled to Virginia in 1637 and collected flowers, plants, shells, an Indian deerskin mantle believed to have belonged to [[Powhatan]], father of [[Pocahontas]]. Father and son, in addition to botanical specimens, collected zoological (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;the [[dodo]] from Mauritius, the upper jaw of a walrus, and armadillos), artificial curiosities (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;wampum belts, portraits, lathe turned ivory, weapons, costumes, Oriental footwear and carved alabaster panels) and rarities (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;a mermaid's hand, a dragon's egg, two feathers of a phoenix's tail, a piece of the True Cross, and a vial of blood that rained in the Isle of Wight). By the 1630s, the Tradescants displayed their eclectic collection at their residence in South Lambeth. Tradescant's Ark, as it came to be known, was the earliest major cabinet of curiosity in England and open to the public for a small entrance fee.&lt;ref name="IvinsJr"&gt;Ivins, Jr., William M. "The Tradescant Collection", in ''The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin'', Vol. 20, No. 8 (August 1925), 194–197; Josten, C.H. ''Elias Ashmole (1617–1692): His Autobiographical and Historical Notes, His Correspondence, and Other Contemporary Sources Relating to His Life and Work: Texts, 1661–1672'', (Oxford: Clarendon, 1967); Leith-Ross, Prudence.

''Strange Blooms: The Curious Lives and Adventures of the John Tradescants'', (London: Atlantic, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elias Ashmole]] (1617–1692) was a lawyer, chemist, antiquarian, [[Freemason]], and a member of the Royal Society with a keen interest in [[astrology]], [[alchemy]], and botany. Ashmole was also a neighbor of the Tradescants in Lambeth. He financed the publication of ''Musaeum Tradescantianum'', a catalogue of the Ark collection in 1656. Ashmole, a collector in his own right, acquired the Tradescant Ark in 1659 and added it to his collection of astrological, medical, and historical manuscripts. In 1675, he donated his library and collection and the Tradescant collection to the [[University of Oxford]], provided that a suitable building be provided to house the collection. Ashmole’s donation formed the foundation of the [[Ashmolean Museum]] at Oxford.&lt;ref name="IvinsJr" /&gt;

Cabinets of Curiosities can now be found at [[Snowshill Manor]] and [[Wallington Hall]]. The concept has been reinterpreted at [[The Viktor Wynd Museum of Curiosities, Fine Art &amp; Natural History]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A two-headed lamb and ancient dildos: the UK's strangest new museum|url = https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/oct/28/two-headed-lamb-ancient-dildos-uks-strangest-new-museum|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-10-04|first = Oliver|last = Wainwright}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cabinets of curiosities served not only as collections to reflect the particular curiosities of their curators but as social devices to establish and uphold rank in society. There are said to be two main types of cabinets. As R. J. W. Evans notes, there could be "the princely cabinet, serving a largely representational function, and dominated by aesthetic concerns and a marked predilection for the exotic," or the less grandiose, "the more modest collection of the humanist scholar or virtuoso, which served more practical and scientific purposes." Evans goes on to explain that "no clear distinction existed between the two categories: all collecting was marked by curiosity, shading into credulity, and by some sort of universal underlying design".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Impey, MacGregor|first1=Oliver, Arthur|title=The Origins of Museums: The Cabinet of Curiosities in Sixteenth- and Seventeenth-Century Europe|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=737}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to cabinets of curiosity serving as an establisher of socioeconomic status for its curator, these cabinets served as entertainment, as particularly illustrated by the proceedings of the [[Royal Society]], whose early meetings were often a sort of open floor to any Fellow to exhibit the findings his curiosities led him to. However purely educational or investigative these exhibitions may sound, it is important to note that the Fellows in this period supported the idea of “learned entertainment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fontes da Costa|first1=Palmira|title=Singular and the Making of Knowledge at the Royal Society of London in the Eighteenth Century|website=site.ebrary.com/lib/byuprovo/detail.action?docID=10677039&amp;p00=cabinet+curiosities|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;” or the alignment of learning with entertainment. This was not unusual, as the Royal Society had an earlier history of a love of the marvellous. This love was often exploited by eighteenth-century natural philosophers to secure the attention of their audience during their exhibitions.

Places of exhibitions of and places of new societies that promoted natural knowledge also seemed to culture the idea of perfect civility. Some scholars propose that this was “a reaction against the dogmatism and enthusiasm of the [[English Civil War]] and Interregum [sic].&lt;ref name="Cambridge Scholars Publishing"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fontes da Costa|first1=Palmira|title=Singular and the Making of Knowledge at the Royal Society of London in the Eighteenth Century|website=site.ebrary.com/lib/byuprovo/reader.action?docID=10677039|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;” This move to politeness put bars on how one should behave and interact socially, which enabled the distinguishing of the polite from the supposed common or more vulgar members of society. Exhibitions of curiosities (as they were typically odd and foreign marvels) attracted a wide, more general audience, which “[rendered] them more suitable subjects of polite discourse at the Society.”&lt;ref name="Cambridge Scholars Publishing"/&gt; A subject was considered less suitable for polite discourse if the curiosity being displayed was accompanied by too much other material evidence, as it allowed for less conjecture and exploration of ideas regarding the displayed curiosity. Because of this, many displays simply included a concise description of the phenomena and avoided any mention of explanation for the phenomena. Quentin Skinner describes the early Royal Society as “something much more like a gentleman’s club,&lt;ref name="Cambridge Scholars Publishing"/&gt;” an idea supported by [[John Evelyn]], who depicts the Royal Society as “an Assembly of many honorable Gentlemen, who meete inoffensively together under his Majesty’s Royal Cognizance; and to entertaine themselves ingenously, whilst their other domestique avocations or publique business deprives them of being always in the company of learned men and that they cannot dwell forever in the Universities.&lt;ref name="Cambridge Scholars Publishing"/&gt;”

Thomas Dent Mütter (1811–1859) was an early American pioneer of reconstructive plastic surgery. His specialty was repairing congenital anomalies, cleft lip and palates, and club foot. He also collected medical oddities, tumors, anatomical and pathological specimens, wet and dry preparations, wax models, plaster casts, and illustrations of medical deformities. This collection began as a teaching tool for young physicians. Just prior to Mütter's death in 1859, he donated 1,344 items to the [[American College of Physicians]] in Philadelphia, along with a $30,000 endowment for the maintenance and expansion of his museum. Mütter’s collection was added to ninety-two pathological specimens collected by Doctor Isaac Parrish between 1849 and 1852. The [[Mütter Museum]] began to collect antique medical equipment in 1871, including [[Benjamin Rush]]'s medical chest and [[Florence Nightingale]]'s sewing kit. In 1874 the museum acquired one hundred human skulls from Austrian anatomist and phrenologist, [[Joseph Hyrtl]] (1810–1894); a nineteenth-century corpse, dubbed the "soap lady"; the conjoined liver and death cast of [[Chang and Eng Bunker]], the Siamese twins; and in 1893, [[Grover Cleveland]]'s jaw tumor. The Mütter Museum is an excellent example of a nineteenth-century grotesque cabinet of medical curiosities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collphyphil.org/Site/mutter_museum.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304022221/http://www.collphyphil.org/Site/mutter_museum.html |date=March 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mundieart.com/cabinet/ |title=James G.

[[P.&amp;nbsp;T. Barnum]] took over [[Barnum's American Museum]] on five floors in New York, "perpetuating into the 1860s the Wunderkammer tradition of curiosities for gullible, often slow-moving throngs—Barnum's famously sly but effective method of crowd control was to post a sign, "THIS WAY TO THE EGRESS!" at the exit door".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324407504578185622576715416?mod=WSJ_article_MoreIn_Life%26Culture "Catalog of Curiosities"] by BARRYMORE LAURENCE SCHERER Wall Street Journal.

In 1908, New York businessmen formed the [[Hobby Club]], a dining club limited to 50 men, in order to showcase their "cabinets of wonder" and their selected collections. These included literary specimens and [[incunable]]; antiquities such as ancient armour; precious stones and geological items of interest. Annual formal dinners would be used to open the various collections up to inspection for the other members of the club.&lt;ref&gt;According to its constitution, "This Club shall be called THE HOBBY CLUB. The object of the Club shall be to encourage the collection of literary, artistic and scientific works; to aid in the development of literary, artistic and scientific matters; to promote social and literary intercourse among its members, and the discussion and consideration of various literary and economic subjects."[http://hdl.handle.net/2027/njp.32101060744370 Annals of the Hobby Club of New York City, 1912–1920].&lt;/ref&gt;

==In contemporary culture==
[[Image:My Cabinet o'Curiosities1.jpg|thumb|right|upright||Modern interpretation of a Wunderkammer]]

The Houston Museum of Natural Science houses a hands-on Cabinet of Curiosities, complete with taxidermied crocodile embedded in the ceiling a la Ferrante Imperato's Dell'Historia Naturale. In [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], the modern-day [[Museum of Jurassic Technology]] anachronistically seeks to recreate the sense of wonder that the old cabinets of curiosity once aroused.&lt;ref&gt;The American writer Lawrence Weschler, wrote an entire book about the museum: ''Mr. Wilson's Cabinet Of Wonder: Pronged Ants, Horned Humans, Mice on Toast, and Other Marvels of Jurassic Technology'' (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Spring Green, Wisconsin]], the house and museum of Alex Jordan, known as [[House on the Rock]], can also be interpreted as a modern day curiosity cabinet, especially in the collection and display of automatons. In [[Bristol, Rhode Island]], [[Musée Patamécanique]] is presented as a hybrid between an automaton theater and a cabinet of curiosities and contains works representing the field of Patamechanics, an artistic practice and area of study chiefly inspired by [['Pataphysics|Pataphysics]]. The idea of a cabinet of curiosities has also appeared in recent publications and performances. For example, ''[[Cabinet (magazine)|Cabinet]]'' magazine is a quarterly magazine that juxtaposes apparently unrelated cultural artifacts and phenomena to show their interconnectedness in ways that encourage curiosity about the world. The Italian cultural association Wunderkamern&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wunderkammern.net// Wunderkammern] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325091444/http://www.wunderkammern.net/ |date=2008-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; uses the theme of historical cabinets of curiosities to explore how "amazement" is manifested within today's artistic discourse. The May of 2008, the University of Leeds Fine Art BA programme hosted a show called "Wunder Kammer", the culmination of research and practice from students, which allowed viewers to encounter work from across all disciplines, ranging from intimate installation to thought-provoking video and highly skilled drawing, punctuated by live performances.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120918075929/http://www.wunder-kammer.com/ wunder-kamer.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several internet bloggers describe their sites as a wunderkammern either because they are primarily made up of links to things that are interesting, or because they inspire wonder in a similar manner to the original wunderkammern (see External Links, below). The researcher Robert Gehl describes such internet video sites as [[YouTube]] as modern-day wunderkammern, although in danger of being refined into capitalist institutions "just as professionalized curators refined Wunderkammers into the modern museum in the 18th century."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gehl|first=Robert W.|title=Youtube As Archive: Who Will Curate This Digital Wunderkammer?|journal=International Journal of Cultural Studies|year=2009|volume=12|issue=1|pages=43–60|doi=10.1177/1367877908098854}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chris Kraus''' (born 1955&lt;ref&gt;[http://egs.edu/faculty/chris-kraus "Chris Kraus".] egs.edu. Retrieved 27 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;) is an American writer and filmmaker. Her novels include ''[[I Love Dick]]'', ''[[Aliens &amp; Anorexia]]'', ''Torpor'', and ''Summer of Hate''. ''[[Video Green]]'', Kraus' first non-fiction book examines the explosion of late 1990s art by high-profile graduate programs that catapulted [[Los Angeles]] into the center of the international art world.{{whom|date=September 2017}} Her films include ''Gravity &amp; Grace'', ''How To Shoot A Crime'', and ''The Golden Bowl, or, Repression''.

== Biography ==
Kraus was born in [[New York City]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://culturalicons.co.nz/episode/chris-kraus "Conversations with iconic people – Chris Kraus".] culturalicons.co.nz. Retrieved 27 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and spent her childhood in Connecticut and New Zealand. After obtaining a BA at a young age from [[Victoria University of Wellington]], [[New Zealand]], Kraus worked as a journalist for five years, and then moved to [[New York City]]. Kraus was aged 21 when she arrived in New York and began studying with actor [[Ruth Maleczech]] and director [[Lee Breuer]], whose studio in the East Village was called ReCherChez.&lt;ref&gt;Guthrie, Kayla. "[http://www.artinamericamagazine.com/news-features/interviews/chris-kraus-real-fine-arts/ Interview: Performing Is Storytelling: Q+A with Chris Kraus]." ''Art in America''. 2011 June 22.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Kraus made films and [[video art]] and staged performances and plays at many venues. In the late 1970s she was a member of [[The Artists Project]], a City-funded public service venture of painters, poets, writers, filmmakers and dancers.

Her work as a performance and video artist satirized the Downtown scene's gender politics and favored literary tropes, blending theatrical techniques with [[Dada]], literary criticism, social activism, and [[performance art]].

Kraus is Jewish and deals with many spiritual and social aspects of Judaism in her works. She says that her parents attended Christian church and did not tell her that her family is Jewish until she moved back to Manhattan at age 21, possibly to shield her from antisemitism.&lt;ref name="k-word"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sonkin|first1=Rebecca|title=Chris Kraus and the K-Word|url=https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/chris-kraus-k-word/|accessdate=17 May 2017|work=Los Angeles Review of Books|date=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tablet" /&gt;

She continued to make films through the mid-1990s. As of 2006 she was married to [[Sylvère Lotringer]], a Jewish man who survived the [[Holocaust]] as a child,&lt;ref name="tablet"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cahmi|first1=Leslie|title=The Tense of Trauma - Novelist Chris Kraus ponders the meaning of “It would have been”|url=http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/books/864/the-tense-of-trauma|website=Tablet Magazine|accessdate=17 May 2017|date=7 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they had divorced by 2016.&lt;ref name="k-word" /&gt; Some of her works are based on her marriage and her ex-husband.&lt;ref name="k-word" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tablet" /&gt; She now lives in [[Los Angeles]].

In 2017, Kraus published ''After Kathy Acker'', a biography of [[Kathy Acker]].&lt;ref name="Guardian 31 August 2017"&gt;{{cite news |last= Laing |first= Olivia | authorlink= Olivia Laing| title= After Kathy Acker by Chris Kraus review – sex, art and a life of myths |url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/31/after-kathy-acker-by-chris-kraus-review| date= 31 August 2017| newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |location=London| accessdate=6 September 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
===I Love Dick===

''[[I Love Dick]]'' is an [[epistolary novel]], a series of love letters to an elusive addressee, later identified as [[Dick Hebdige]]. In an introduction to the second edition of the novel, [[Eileen Myles]] writes, "Chris' ultimate achievement is philosophical.  She's turned female [[Social rejection|abjection]] inside out and aimed it at a man.  As if her decades of experience were both a painting and a weapon.  As if she, a hag, a jew, a poet, a failed filmmaker, a former go-go dancer—an intellectual, a wife, as if she had the right to go right up to the end of the book and ''live'' having felt all that.  ''I Love Dick'' boldly suggests that Chris Kraus' unswervingly attempted and felt female life is a total work ''and'' it didn't kill her." &lt;ref&gt;New York Magazine - 17 November 1997 - Page 20 "But this first literary effort by Chris Kraus, an alternative filmmaker who is also a fiction editor at Semiotext(e), got the wrong kind of attention. Her confessional roman a clef about the mossy realm of academe and the glossy SoHo-Chelsea art scene nearly landed her in court."&lt;/ref&gt; In  2016, [[Jill Soloway]] adapted the novel as a [[I_Love_Dick_(TV_series)|TV series]], produced by [[Amazon Studios]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url = https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/feb/18/i-love-dick-amazon-produced-by-jill-soloway-creator-transparent| title = Coming from the creator of Transparent: I Love Dick, the TV version of cult novel| last = Gajanan| first = Mahita| date = 2016-02-18| newspaper = The Guardian| language = en-GB| issn = 0261-3077| access-date = 2016-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first season was released on May 12, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.metacritic.com/tv/i-love-dick/critic-reviews| title = ''I Love Dick'' critic reviews| date = May 24, 2017| accessdate = 2017-05-24| publisher = metacritic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aliens and Anorexia===
''Aliens and Anorexia'' jumps back and forth in time and location, tracing the life and activism of [[Ulrike Meinhof]], the downtown theatre scene in late seventies New York, the drug experiments of [[Aldous Huxley]], the paintings and writings of [[Paul Thek]], through the narrator Chris's fruitless attempts to make and sell a feature film, "Gravity and Grace", (which takes its title from the [[Simone Weil]] volume of the same name).

===Video Green===
A series of 23 essays written between 1998 and 2003, mostly in her column "Torpor" in the magazine Artext, ''Video Green'' is dense with the literary, the personal, and the culturally marginal.  A few of the collection's notable essays ''not'' about L.A. include the elegiac "Posthumous Lives", about the performance artist Penny Arcade's loving curation of the estate of the filmmaker Jack Smith, and "How to Shoot a Crime," about Kraus's 1987 film of the same name.  The volume's first essay and its lengthiest, "Art Collection" follows the idea of collecting through L.A.'s M.F.A. art scene and real estate market, ending up in rural upstate New York with the extraordinary poetry—and art collection—of the all-but forgotten William Bronk.

===Torpor===
''Torpor'' follows Jerome Shafir, a literature professor at Columbia, his wife, Sylvie Green, a writer and filmmaker with an inconclusive career, and their dog Lily through rustbelt [[New York City]], Paris, Berlin, and the [[Eastern Bloc]] at the dawn of the New World Order.  As much a shattering portrait of a Holocaust survivor as portrait of a marriage, ''Torpor'' is also the portrait of a lady rarely found in literature: a down-and-out intellectual bearing witness to a culture in collapse{{According to whom|date=March 2018}}. In ''Torpor'', Kraus shifts out of the first-person narration of ''[[I Love Dick]]'', employing a kind of free-indirect discourse.  In naming her central characters Sylvie and Jerome, Kraus alludes to the hapless, interchangeable protagonists of [[George Perec]]'s first novel, ''Les Choses''.  Perec, a childhood friend of both ''Torpor'''s Jerome and Kraus's real-life husband, [[Sylvère Lotringer]], is quoted several times in the novel.  [[Felix Guattari]] and [[Nan Goldin]] also make appearances, among other cultural figures, though Kraus's use of "reality" comes to more subversive effect than a simple ''roman à clef''.

===Summer of Hate===
''Summer of Hate'' is the story of Catt Dunlop who, like Kraus, is an art critic and occasional professor of Cultural Studies. Emerging rattled from a dangerous relationship with a dominant sex partner she met online, Catt invests in a handful of corroding properties in [[Albuquerque]] and moves there to prepare them for rental. She hires Paul Garcia to work as her property manager, and they begin a romantic relationship, though Catt is still married to an older philosopher in [[New York City]]. A recovering alcoholic, Paul is on parole after spending two years in prison for “stealing less than an art gallery spends on an after-party.” Eventually Paul is pulled over for speeding and arrested in fulfillment of an outstanding warrant, and the pair embarks on a grueling legal process involving inhumane prison practices and impossible parole stipulations. Back in [[Los Angeles]] Catt studies and teaches “all the books about symbolic violence, soft forms of control,” but the forms of control to which Paul is subject are neither soft nor symbolic. As the course of her life fuses with the course of Paul’s, Catt's relationship to class, race, citizenship and criminality become increasingly complicated, forming the basis of Kraus' novelistic critique.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.full-stop.net/2012/09/04/reviews/meagan-day/summer-of-hate-chris-kraus/ "Summer of Hate"] reviewed at ''Full Stop''. 4 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===After Kathy Acker===
''After Kathy Acker'' is a biography of [[Kathy Acker]], a radical American experimental novelist, poet, and essayist. Writing in the ''[[Financial_Times|FT]]'', Lauren Elkin wrote that Kraus "is the perfect mediator for Acker, finding in her work an aesthetics of provocation, discomfiture, risk and radical empathy." Reviewing the book for ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[Olivia Laing]] noted, "Acker was the previous girlfriend of Kraus's now ex-husband, Sylvère Lotringer, like Kraus an editor at the independent publisher Semiotext(e) and a frequent interlocutor here. Is it crass to point this out? It certainly complicates any objective perspective, and maybe it would have been better to state it plainly, especially since it's logged in ''I Love Dick'', the roman-à-clef that made Kraus famous. That said, Kraus reconstitutes Acker's wanderings with real wit and beauty, understanding without pandering to the painfully high stakes of her identity games."&lt;ref name="Guardian 31 August 2017"/&gt;

==Semiotext(e) Native Agents Series==
[[Sylvère Lotringer]], Kraus's husband from the late eighties to the late nineties, founded [[Semiotexte]]'s Foreign Agents series, which mostly published French critical theorists, in 1980. Ten years later Kraus founded the press's Native Agents imprint to publish fiction, mostly by women, as an analogue to the French theories of subjectivity in the Foreign Agents series.&lt;ref name="nplusonemag.com"&gt;"Female Trouble," Elizabeth Gumport, n+1 Magazine, 14 February 2012 http://nplusonemag.com/female-trouble&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to groundbreaking works of fiction by writers like [[Michelle Tea]] and [[Ann Rower]], Native Agents has published notable volumes of poetry and prose by [[Eileen Myles]], [[Barbara Barg]], and [[Fanny Howe]], as well as memoirs and interviews by [[Kathy Acker]], [[Bob Flanagan]], David Rattray, and [[William Burroughs]]. In a 2012 piece for ''[[n+1]]'', senior editor Elizabeth Gumport wrote "What united the Native Agents authors was the way their work combined elements of theory, fiction, and biography, explicitly refusing to identify absolutely with any single genre."&lt;ref name="nplusonemag.com"/&gt;

==Films==
Before beginning her career as writer, Kraus was an artist and filmmaker, making a number of short films and videos, including one feature ''Gravity &amp; Grace''. Her films have been the focus of a number of international retrospective exhibitions and screenings, beginning in 2008 with “Plastic is Leather, Fuck You: Film and Video 1983-1993” at Galerie Cinzia Friedlaender, Berlin. In the press release for the 2011 exhibition at Real Fine Arts in [[Brooklyn]], Kraus detailed her thoughts behind the production of these films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|title=Press release for "Chris Kraus ''Films''"|publisher=Real Fine Arts|location=Brooklyn, New York|url=http://realfinearts.com/files/gimgs/35_ck.jpg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Chance Event==
The Chance Event: Three Days in the Desert: Primm, Nevada, November 1996.  Curated by Chris Kraus, Chance brought together [[Jean Baudrillard]], [[Sandy Stone (artist)|Rosanne Alluquere Stone]], [[DJ Spooky]], Diane di Prima, the Moapa Band of Paiute Indians, visual artists, garage noise bands and 600 participants to investigate the mystery of chance at Whiskey Pete's Casino.  Variously described as "a philosophy rave" and "one of the landmark LA events of the 90s," The Chance Event was reviewed on the front page of [[the LA Times]] and throughout the art press.  Highlights, including a performance by Baudrillard wearing a gold Elvis-inspired blazer and accompanied by the 'Chance' band, were broadcast on European television. The event was funded by the French Cultural Service and Art Center College of Design.

==Influence==
Though best known in the art world for much of her career, Kraus's readership is beginning to increase.&lt;ref&gt;"The Novelist as Performance Artist," Michael M. Miller, Gallerist, 30 October 2012 http://galleristny.com/2012/10/the-novelist-as-performance-artist-on-chris-kraus-the-art-worlds-favorite-fiction-writer/&lt;/ref&gt; She's been referenced in the work of poet [[Ariana Reines]], novelist and memoirist [[Kate Zambreno]], and [[n+1]]'s pamphlet No Regrets.&lt;ref&gt;No Regrets, n+1 http://shop.nplusonemag.com/products/no-regrets&lt;/ref&gt;

In an introduction to her September 2013 interview with Kraus in [[The Believer (magazine)|The Believer]], author [[Sheila Heti]] wrote "I know there was a time before I read Chris Kraus’s ''I Love Dick'' (in fact, that time was only five years ago), but it’s hard to imagine; some works of art do this to you. They tear down so many assumptions about what the form can handle (in this case, what the form of the novel can handle) that there is no way to re-create your mind before your encounter with them."&lt;ref&gt;"Interview with Chris Kraus,' Sheila Heti, The Believer, September 2013 http://www.believermag.com/issues/201309/?read=interview_kraus&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In 2008, Kraus received the [[Frank Jewett Mather]] Award for Art Criticism from the [[College Art Association]].&lt;ref name="caa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegeart.org/awards/matherpast|title=Awards|publisher=The College Art Association|accessdate=11 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clara Tice''' (22 May 1888 – 2 February 1973) was an American [[avant-garde]] illustrator and artist, who spent most of her life in [[New York City, United States]]. Because of her provocative art and public appearances, she was seen as representative of bohemian [[Greenwich Village]] and thus known as "The Queen of Greenwich Village."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women in Dada: Essays on Sex, Gender, and Identity|year=1998|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=414–441|author=Keller, Marie T.|authorlink=Clara Tice|editor=Naomi Sawelson-Gorse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
According to herself and the ''[[New York Times]]'', in 1908 Tice was the first woman in Greenwich Village to bob her hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Vogue of Bobbed Hair: Of Course Greenwich Village Lassies Wear Short Locks, But Society's Doing It Too|journal=New York Times|date=27 June 1920|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, Tice was able to study under the famous artist and teacher [[Robert Henri]]. In 1910, Henri and some of his artist friends, organized the first exhibition of Independent Artist. This art show, which was with its jury-free and no-awards concept quite a revolution at that time and thus received enormous attention, was financially backed by Tice and featured her works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women in Dada: Essays on Sex, Gender, and Identity|year=1998|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=415–416|author=Keller, Marie T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Immersion in the arts ==
A few years later, namely in 1915, Tice's fame skyrocketed when [[Anthony Comstock]], main founder of the [[Society for the Suppression of Vice]], tried to confiscate Tice's art at the well-known bohemian restaurant Polly's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Naumann|first=Francis M.|title=New York Dada 1915-23.|year=1994|publisher=Abrams|location=New York|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thereafter images of Tice's artworks and photos of the artist were featured in magazines such as ''[[Vanity Fair (American magazine 1913–1936)|Vanity Fair]], Rogue, [[The Blind Man]],'' and ''[[Cartoons magazine]]''. During that time she had several one-person exhibitions and also worked on numerous other projects, for example, she created posters for bohemian costume balls and played herself in the 1922 version of the ''Greenwich Village Follies''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women in Dada: Essays on Sex, Gender, and Identity|year=1998|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=416–429|author=Keller, Marie T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During those years, Tice not only played an important part in Greenwich Village's colorful art scene, but also joined the Arensberg Circle in their uptown location. It was probably [[Marcel Duchamp]] who introduced Tice to Walter and Louise Arensberg and their salon. There she met [[Henri-Pierre Roché]], with whom she spent several evenings. Tice also participated in two projects by the Arensberg Circle: first, two of her works were shown in the first exhibition of the [[Society of Independent Artists]] and second, one of her works was featured in ''The Blind Man''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women in Dada: Essays on Sex, Gender, and Identity|year=1998|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=425–427|author=Keller, Marie T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1920s, she illustrated about a dozen books with her erotic images,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women in Dada: Essays on Sex, Gender, and Identity|year=1998|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=432–434|author=Keller, Marie T.}}&lt;/ref&gt; these are nowadays expensive collector's items. In 1940, her own book called ''ABC Dogs'' was published. It is a children's book in which each letter of the alphabet is represented by a dog breed whose name starts with the same letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tice|first=Clara|title=ABC Dogs|year=1940|publisher=Funk|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; This publication sparked renewed interest in Tice and her art. She also worked on her memoirs, which she never completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women in Dada: Essays on Sex, Gender, and Identity|year=1998|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=414–441|author=Keller, Marie T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Contemporary Art Society''' is an Australian organisation formed in 1938 to promote non-representative forms of art. It has autonomous branches in each State of the Commonwealth.

==Victoria==
The Contemporary Art Society was established on 13 July 1938, by [[George Bell (painter)|George Bell]], in protest at the perceived conservatism of the dominant Australian Academy of Art, with primary and paramount objectives being the fostering and promotion of contemporary art, to further the understanding of it, and to encourage and stimulate artists. George Bell was President from 1938 to 1940.

Its first exhibition was held in the National Gallery, Victoria, in June 1939, with work from all states. After disagreement over the direction of the Society, George Bell and 83 other members seceded in 1940, and [[John Reed (art patron)|John Reed]] was elected president. Membership of the Contemporary Art Society brought together some of Melbourne's young radical artists – [[Arthur Boyd]], [[John Perceval]], [[Harry de Hartog]], [[Albert Tucker (artist)|Albert Tucker]], [[Sidney Nolan]], [[Victor O'Connor |Vic O'Connor]], [[Yosl Bergner]] and [[Noel Counihan]]. In 1947, after personal and political differences, C.A.S. suspended activities.

John Reed revived C.A.S. in 1954, and in 1956 established the Gallery of Contemporary Art (later the Museum of Modern Art and Design of Australia), as the C.A.S. head office. In 1955 the annual subscription of ten shillings was increased to one pound. In 1956, [[Georges Mora]] was elected President. Artists donated paintings towards an inaugural fundraising exhibition in 1957, and the Victorian Government made available a grant. In 1960 [[Edwin Tanner]] was elected vice-president, 1961 [[David Boyd (artist)|David Boyd]] as president and John Perceval as vice-president. In 1963 C.A.S. rented premises at 9 Collins Street, Melbourne, then 1 Fitzroy St, St Kilda in 1967.

From 1967 to 1987, presidents elected were: 1967 – [[Robert Grieve#Family|Robert Grieve]], 1972 – [[Heather Johnson]], 1975 – [[Joan Gough]], 1980 – [[Sue McDougall]], 1982 – [[Louise Foletta]], 1984 – [[Anthony Syndicas]], 1985 – [[Marek Dobieki]] and 1987 – [[Jan Delaney]]. From 1972, members were able to rent exhibition space at Joan Gough's studio in Kew, and later her studio in South Yarra, until early 1989.

In a change of direction, the Society's July 1989 Annual Exhibition, judged by [[Erica McGilchrist]], was held in the "Old Court House Gallery" in Seymour, Victoria. In June 1989, Robert Lee became President. The C.A.S. held its Council and Members' meetings at members' homes, and local hotels. In October 1989, the Members' Exhibition was held in the "Sky" Gallery in Collingwood.

In February 1990, the C.A.S. gained use of the Ola Cohn Centre in East Melbourne, as a base for its activities. Many successful artists' evenings and discussion nights were held over the next seven years. 1990 also saw exhibitions held at the State Bank Galleria and AMP Square, Melbourne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brief History Contemporary Art Society of Victoria (Inc.)|url=http://www.contemporaryartsociety.org.au/home/history|website=Contemporary Art Society of Victoria|publisher=Contemporary Art Society of Victoria (Inc.)|accessdate=17 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New South Wales==
Founded 1939 with Rah Fizelle president and Peter Bellew secretary. The NSW CAS's founding members promoted abstraction as a revolutionary art form and positioned the Society as an oppositional artist's group dedicated to the production of experimental art, attacking the values of the mainstream artist's groups such as the [[Society of Artists (Australia)|Society of Artists]]. The NSW branch had its first exhibition in Sydney in 1940. The Society purportedly differed from other local societies, in that it "concentrates on unconventional and experimental work".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17702286 |title=LIVELY PICTURES. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=24 September 1940 |accessdate=25 October 2015 |page=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954, as a protest against the [[Archibald Prize]], which it regarded as being biased, boring and of a low standard, the Contemporary Art Society initiated its own awards, with [[Michael Kmit]] the first nominated winner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=E3bYX10wulgC&amp;dq=Contemporary+Art+Society+michael+kmit&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s | title=Andrew Sibley: An Epic of the Everyman | publisher=Macmillan Education | author=David, Thomas | year=2004 | pages=132 | isbn=9781876832155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1506">'''Cormac Mac Con Midhe''', a.k.a. '''Cormac mac Cearbhaill Mac Con Midhe''' (died 1627) was an early [[Modern Irish]] [[poet]].

[[Manuscript]] H.5.6, held at [[Trinity College, Dublin]], contains a [[poem]] of 24 [[stanza]]s apparently written by Mac Con Midhe for Toirealach Ó Néill of Sliocht Airt Óig of Tyrone and his wife, Sorcha. It survives in another copy of 188 lines in MS 1291 (formerly H.1.17), also in Trinity, both being made by Hugh O'Daly in the middle 18th century for a Dr. Sullivan. According to Ó Diobhlin (2000), "Because of the corruptness of the copy the poem has never been edited, nor have its contents been deciphered ... Toirealach was transplanted to Connacht, and then he disappears from history after the [[Jacobite rebellion]]."

The '''European Cultural Convention''' is an international treaty for EU and EU accession states to strengthen, deepen and further develop a European Culture, by using local culture as a starting point, setting common goals and a plan of action, to reach an integrated European society, celebrating [[universal values]], rights and diversity.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/018&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Cultural Convention was opened for signature by the [[Council of Europe]] in Paris on 19 December 1954.&lt;ref name=parties&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=018&amp;CM=8&amp;DF=21/01/2013&amp;CL=ENG|work=Council of Europe|title=European Cultural Convention, CETS No.: 018|date=18 January 2013|accessdate=21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its signature is one of the conditions for becoming a participating state in the [[Bologna Process]] and its [[European Higher Education Area]] (EHEA). The term "Convention" is used as a synonym for an international legal treaty.

The convention has been ratified by all 47 member states of the Council of Europe; it has also been ratified by [[Belarus]], the [[Holy See]], and [[Kazakhstan]].

{{Term|Area of effect|content=area of effect (AoE)}}
{{Defn|
[[File:Freedroid RPG.jpg|thumb|150px|Screenshot from ''FreedroidRPG'' showing area of effect.]]
A term used in many {{gli|role-playing video game|role-playing}} and [[strategy game|strategy]] games to describe attacks or other effects that affect multiple targets within a specified area. For example, in the role-playing game, ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'', a fireball {{gli|magic|spell}} will deal damage to anyone within a certain radius of where it strikes. In most tactical strategy games [[artillery]] weapons have an area of effect that will damage anyone within a radius of the strike zone.
&lt;p&gt;Area of effect can also refer to spells and abilities that are non-damaging. For example, a powerful healing spell may affect anyone within a certain range of the caster (often only if they are a member of the caster's {{gli|party}}). Some games also have what are referred to as "aura" abilities that will affect anyone in the area around the person with the ability. For example, many strategy games have hero or officer units that can improve the morale and combat performance of friendly units around them. The inclusion of AoE elements in game mechanics can increase the role of strategy, especially in {{gli|turn-based game}}s. The player has to place units wisely to mitigate the possibly devastating effects of a hostile area of effect attack; however, placing units in a dense formation could result in gains that outweigh the increased AoE damage received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Point-blank area of effect (PBAoE) is a less-used term for when the affected region is centered on the character performing the ability, rather than at a location of the player's choosing.&lt;/p&gt;}}

&lt;p&gt;Originally built into {{gli|arcade game}}s, the main purpose of the attract mode is to entice passers-by to play the game.&lt;ref name="Ruggill"/&gt; It usually displays the game's [[title screen]], the game's story (if it has one), its [[high score]] list, [[sweepstakes]] (on some games) and the message "[[Game Over]]" or "Insert Coin" over or in addition to a computer-controlled demonstration of {{gli|gameplay}}. In [[Atari]] home video games of the 1970s and 1980s, the term ''attract mode'' was sometimes used to denote a simple [[screensaver]] that slowly cycled the display colors to prevent [[phosphor burn-in]] while the game was not being played. Attract modes demonstrating gameplay are common in current home video games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attract mode is not only found in arcade games, but in most coin-operated games like [[pinball machines]], [[Stacker (game)|stacker machines]] and other games. [[Cocktail arcade cabinet|Cocktail arcade]] machines on which the screen flips its orientation for each player's turn in two-player games traditionally have the screen's orientation in player 1's favour for the attract mode.&lt;/p&gt;}}

{{Defn|Augmented Reality (AR) is an interactive experience of a real-world environment whereby the objects that reside in the real-world are "augmented" by computer-generated perceptual information, sometimes across multiple sensory modalities, including visual, auditory, haptic, somatosensory, and olfactory. The overlaid sensory information can be constructive (i.e. additive to the natural environment) or destructive (i.e. masking of the natural environment) and is seamlessly interwoven with the physical world such that it is perceived as an immersive aspect of the real environment. In this way, augmented reality alters one’s ongoing perception of a real world environment, whereas virtual reality completely replaces the user's real world environment with a simulated one.

[[File:A7xpg-continue.png|thumb|150px|''A7Xpg'' gives the player the opportunity to continue playing after losing their last life]]
A common term in video games for the option to continue the game after all of the player's {{gli|life|lives}} have been lost, rather than ending the game and restarting from the very beginning. There may or may not be a penalty for doing this, such as losing a certain number of points or being unable to access bonus stages.
&lt;p&gt;In {{gli|arcade game}}s, when a player loses or fails an objective, they will generally be shown a "continue countdown" screen, in which the player has a limited amount of time (usually 10, 15, or 20 seconds) to insert additional coins in order to continue the game from the point where it had ended; deciding not to continue will result in the displaying of a {{gli|game over}} screen.&lt;ref name="Compton"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Compton|first1=Shanna|title=Gamers: Writers, Artists and Programmers on the Pleasures of Pixels|date=2004|publisher=Soft Skull Press|location=Brooklyn, New York|isbn=9781932360578|pages=117–118|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-sCO-gODwy4C&amp;pg=RA1-PA117&amp;dq=continue+quarter+arcade&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BDP3TJivM8L38AbPzPnuBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=continue%20quarter%20arcade&amp;f=false|accessdate=May 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The continue feature was added to arcade games in the mid-1980s due to arcade owners wanting to earn more money from players who played for longer periods of time.&lt;ref name="Compton"/&gt; The first arcade game to have a continue feature was ''[[Fantasy (video game)|Fantasy]]'',&lt;ref name="Compton"/&gt; and the first home console cartridge to have this feature was the Atari 2600 version of ''[[Vanguard (video game)|Vanguard]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Kunkel|first1=Bill |authorlink1=Bill Kunkel (gaming)|last2=Katz|first2=Arnie|authorlink2=Arnie Katz|date=May 1983|title=Arcade Alley: Zapping for Truth and Justice |magazine=[[Video (magazine)|Video]]|publisher=Reese Communications|volume=7|issue=2|pages=26–28|issn=0147-8907}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|26}} As a result of the continue feature, games started to have stories and definite endings; however, those games were designed so that it would be nearly impossible to get to the end of the game without continuing.&lt;ref name="Compton"/&gt; Salen and Zimmerman argue that the continue feature in games such as ''[[Gauntlet (arcade game)|Gauntlet]]'' was an outlet for [[conspicuous consumption]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Salen|first1=Katie|last2=Zimmerman|first2=Eric|title=Rules of Play: Game Design Fundamentals|date=2004|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=9780262240451|page=264|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UM-xyczrZuQC&amp;pg=PT232&amp;lpg=PT232&amp;dq=continue+arcade+game+quarter&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2yLDuXdAYv&amp;sig=ghUz9UVW3uMv_tiiyK97XMKjzHE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=qzD3TO2sBoP58AaIg5SCBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CF0Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=continue%20arcade%20game%20quarter&amp;f=false|accessdate=May 24, 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

{{Term|Cooldown|content=cooldown}}
{{Defn|The minimum length of time that the player needs to wait after using an [[Skill (role-playing games)|ability]] before they can use it again. This concept was first introduced by the text {{gli|MUD}} ''[[Avalon (MUD)|Avalon: The Legend Lives]]''.
&lt;p&gt;An analogy can be made to the [[Handloading|reload]] time and [[firing rate]] of weapons. For example, a [[machine gun]] has very fast firing rate, so it has a very low cooldown between shots. Comparatively, a [[shotgun]] has a long cooldown between shots. Cooldown can be used to {{gli|balance}} a weapon such as a [[Gun turret|turret-mounted]] machine gun having infinite ammunition, since it can only sustain continuous fire until reaching a threshold at which the weapon would have to cool down (hence the term) before it could be fired again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In design terms, cooldown can be thought of as an inverted 'casting time' where instead of requiring a wait time before using an ability, cooldown may replace casting time and put the wait after the ability is activated. This creates a new dimension to the balancing act of casting speed versus power: "lower cooldown, faster cast, but weaker strength" versus "higher cooldown, slower cast, but greater strength". This mechanic is integral to such games as ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', where cooldown management is key to higher-level play and various abilities deal with cooldown (for example, cooldown reduction or immediately finishing cooldown on certain abilities). From the technical point of view, cooldown can also be used to assert control over frequency of cast in order to maintain a fluid {{gli|frame rate}} and ping. For example, in the game ''[[Diablo II]]'', cooldown was added in the form of a patch to several graphically and CPU-intensive spells to solve the problem of extreme {{gli|lag}} caused by players spamming (ie: repeatedly casting at {{gli|maxed out}} cast rates) these spells in multiplayer games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moves and attacks in fighting games (like those from the ''[[Street Fighter]]'' series) are measured in animation frames (which may be 1/20th to 1/60th of a second per frame). Each move has a certain number of frames in which it is considered to be "recovering" before another move can be executed, which is similar to cooldown in concept. However, there is no player control over the character during recovery frames, and the character can not perform any movement or attacks until fully recovered. Because the character is vulnerable during recovery, strategic use of skills is necessary to make sure the opponent cannot immediately counter the player-character.&lt;/p&gt;}}

{{Defn|In games where the player advances in level such in RPGs, level scaling is used to alter the attributes of a player or the enemies so that regardless of the player's level, there is generally a similar challenge in combat.

With level scaling, either the enemy would be buffed or the player's abilities nerfed so that the challenge would be similar as if the player and enemy were at the same level. The player would still gain added benefits with higher levels, such as additional abilities, better equipment with unique properties, and access to higher-level quests or areas.

{{Defn|A character-development gaming mechanic typically seen in {{gli|role-playing video game|role-playing games}}. A skill tree consists of a series of skills (sometimes known as {{gli|perks}}) which can be earned as the player [[levels up]] or otherwise progresses their {{gli|player-character}}.

&lt;p&gt;A skill tree is called a "tree" because it uses a tiered system and typically branches out into multiple paths. A tiered skill tree will require a player to achieve certain skills before the next tier of skills become available. The player may be required to achieve all skills in one tier before moving on to the next, or may only be required to complete prerequisites for individual branches. Skill trees are a common tool used for in-game {{gli|balance|balancing}} by game designers. Skill trees also offer a "game within a game" in which players are not only playing a video game, but their decisions on how they allocate points into their skill trees will affect their overall gaming experience.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The initial screen of a [[computer game|computer]], [[video game|video]], or [[arcade game]] after the credits and logos of the [[video game developer|game developer]] and [[video game publisher|publisher]] are displayed. Early title screens often included all the [[game option]]s available (single player, multiplayer, configuration of controls, etc.) while modern games have opted for the title screen to serve as a [[splash screen]]. This can be attributed to the use of the title screen as a [[loading screen]], in which to cache all the graphical elements of the main menu. Older computer and video games had relatively simple menu screens that often featured [[pre-rendered]] artwork.
&lt;p&gt;In arcade games, the title screen is shown as part of the {{gli|attract mode}} loop, usually after a game demonstration is played. The title screen and [[high score]] list urge potential players to [[insert coin]]s. In console games, especially if the screen is not merged with the main menu, it urges the player to press start. Similarly, in computer games, the message "Hit [[any key]]" is often displayed. Controls that lack an actual "Start" button use a different prompt; the [[Wii]], for example, usually prompts to press the "A" button and the "B" trigger simultaneously, as in ''[[Super Mario Galaxy 2]]'' or ''[[Mario Party 9]]''.

For example, in ''[[The King of Fighters '94]]'', each character has special win quotes against each of the 8 teams; in ''[[Street Fighter Alpha]]'', players can choose one of four win quotes by holding certain button combinations after winning a battle; in ''[[Street Fighter III]]'': Giant Attack, characters sometime use special win quotes if they finish the battle with a certain move; and in ''SNK vs. Capcom: Match of the Millennium'', players can input their own win quotes in edit mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some win quotes have characters break the [[fourth wall]], such as [[Chun-Li]]'s ''[[Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter]]'' win quote in which she suspects the game is set on the easiest difficulty setting; or are [[in-joke]]s referring to other [[video game]]s, like [[Sakura Kasugano|Sakura]]'s ''Street Fighter Alpha 3'' win quote in which she says she prefers "street fighting to sparring in [[Rival Schools|rival schools]]."&lt;/p&gt;}}

{{Term|Wrapping|content=[[wraparound (video games)|wrapping]]{{Anchor|Wrapping}}}}
{{Defn|Camera wrapping is a technique often used in video games, which allows a player to move in a straight line and get back to where they started.{{clarify|date=January 2018}} This was more often used in older games to make it seem that the player is moving up or down an extremely high hill; memory can be saved by using wrapping instead of creating a larger area filled with impassable walls. Wrapping is also used to make a 2D game world round; for example, in ''[[PacMan]]'' exiting the game screen to the right wraps the player to the same position on the left side of the screen. Similarly, in ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'', exiting the game map to the right wraps the player to the same position on the left side of the map, and exiting the map to the top wraps the player to the bottom of the map.}}

'''''Lamentation of Christ''''' (also known as '''''Glimm Lamentation''''') is an [[panel painting|oil-on-panel]] painting of the common subject of the [[Lamentation of Christ]] by the German Renaissance artist [[Albrecht Dürer]], executed around 1500 and now in the [[Alte Pinakothek]] of [[Munich]], Germany.

The work was commissioned by goldsmith Jakob Glimm as a memorial of his first wife, Margaret Holzmann, who had died in 1500.  The removal of later re-painting in 1924 showed the original figures of the donors (Glimm and his three sons) and of the dead woman, depicted in far smaller proportions than the religious characters.

==Description==
The painting shows the dead Jesus, held by [[Nicodemus]] and surrounded by the Pious Women, including an aged and  distraught [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]].  In the right part are three standing characters depicted on a diagonal line: from top, [[St. John the Evangelist]], [[Mary Magdalene]], and [[Joseph of Arimathea]], the last two holding vases which contained balms used to prepare the corpse for the burial.

Many car chairs are adorned in leather or synthetic material designed for comfort or relief from the noted stress of being seated.

It was originally designed for passenger lounging while aboard ocean liners or ships.
* [[Dentist chair]], a deeply reclining chair to allow the dentist easy access to the patient's mouth. The reclining position adjusts as well as the overall height of the chair.

The seat and back are made of canvas or a similar strong fabric which bears the user's full weight and can be folded; the frame is made of wood, or sometimes metal or plastic. The seat and scissors members work together to support and distribute the sitter's weight so that the seat is comfortably taut. The back is usually low and the chair usually has armrests. The stereotypical image of a movie director on location includes one of these chairs, hence the name. [[Victor Papanek]] describes this chair as an excellent design in his book ''Design for the Real World'' as it is simple and ideally suited to its function. The design goes back to coffer-makers' chairs of the 15th century and eventually to the Roman [[curule chair]].

* [[Hanging Egg Chair]], designed by Danish furniture designer [[Nanna Ditzel]] in 1957

==I==
* [[Inflatable chair]], usually children's toys made out of plastic; [[IKEA]] briefly marketed them as serious furniture upholstered in fabric; some are designed for use as floating lounge chairs in swimming pools.
* [[Ironing chair]], a lightly built folding chair usually with a metal frame and small padded seat and either a minimal padded back or a simple tubular loop back. The chair is usually used as a 'perch', a support for carrying out an activity - such as ironing - by people with disabilities or back problems, but they are also popular with anyone requiring a light supporting chair for extended periods, such as observing through a telescope.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chairs.faidahbir.org/]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Luigi Chiarelli''' (7 July 1880 &amp;ndash; 20 December 1947) was an [[Italian people|Italian]] [[playwright]], theatre critic, and writer of [[short stories]] who is chiefly known as a founder of the ''teatro grottesco'', or [[Theatre of the Grotesque]], after the subtitle of one of his plays.

==Life==
He was born in 1880 in [[Trani]] and attended university, but abandoned his studies to devote himself to journalism and criticism. The first of his plays to be produced in 1912 were ''Er gendarme'' ("The Policeman") and ''Una notte d'amore'' ("One night of Love"), followed in 1914 by ''Extra dry'' and in 1916 by ''[[La maschera e il volto]]'' ("The Mask and the Face: A Grotesque in Three Acts"), which he had written in 1913, and on which much of his reputation rests. It was praised by [[Antonio Gramsci]] in his magazine ''[[Avanti!]]'' (11 April 1917) for the insight it showed into the chasm between one's persona and one's true personality. It was revived in London in 1993.

It was followed by ''La Scala di seta'' ("The Silken Ladder", 1917), ''Chimere'' ("Chimeras", 1920), ''La morte degli amanti'' ("The Lovers' Death", 1921), which was produced simultaneously in London, ''Fuochi d'artificio'' ("Fireworks", 1922), the [[radio play]] ''L'anello di Teodosio'' ("The Ring of Teodosio", 1929) and ''Un uomo da rifare'' ("A Man to Remake", 1932), among many others. His plays were produced throughout Europe and in America.

He was a theatre critic for the newspaper ''Il corriere di Milano'' from 1923, and the rise of [[Fascism]] in Italy prompted a shift in his expressed opinions from a delight in innovation to a defensive emphasis on the authentically Italian qualities of [[Novecento Italiano|Novecento]] drama. A collection of stories, ''Karakè e altri racconti'', was published in 1944.

He died in [[Rome]] in 1947.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12189">{{Marxism|Aspects}}

'''Marxist literary criticism''' is a loose term describing [[literary criticism]] based on socialist and dialectic theories. Marxist criticism views literary works as reflections of the social institutions from which they originate. (Clarification: In fact, most Marxist critics who were writing in what could chronologically be specified as the early period of Marxist literary criticism subscribed to what has come to be called "[[Vulgar Marxism]]." In this thinking of the structure of societies, literary texts are one register of the Superstructure, which is determined by the economic Base of any given society. Therefore, literary texts are a reflection of the economic Base rather than "the social institutions from which they originate" for all social institutions, or, more precisely human social relationships, are in the final analysis determined by the economic Base). According to Marxists, even literature itself is a social institution and has a specific ideological function, based on the background and ideology of the author.  

The English literary critic and cultural theorist, [[Terry Eagleton]], defines Marxist criticism this way:

: Marxist criticism is not merely a 'sociology of literature', concerned with how novels get published and whether they mention the working class. Its aim is to explain the literary work more fully; and this means a sensitive attention to its forms, styles and, meanings. But it also means grasping those forms, styles and meanings as the product of a particular history.&lt;ref&gt;T Eagleton, Marxism and Literary Criticism, Berkeley, U of California P, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

The simplest goals of Marxist literary criticism can include an assessment of the political 'tendency' of a literary work, determining whether its social content or its literary form are 'progressive'. It also includes analyzing the class constructs demonstrated in the literature. Further, another of the ends of Marxist criticism is to analyze the narrative of class struggle in a given text. Does the text serve to perpetuate the ruling class ideology; to subvert that ideology, such as William Morris's ''News from Nowhere''; or to signify both a perpetuation and subversion of the dominant ideology, such as in the works of Charles Dickens with ''Hard Times'' being the novel that most openly textualizes such a double signification as it offers a damning criticism of capitalism while also and at the same time seeking a perpetuation of a class-structured society.

== History ==
[[Karl Marx]]'s studies have provided a basis for much in socialist theory and research. Marxism aims to revolutionize the concept of work through creating a [[classless society]] built on control and ownership of the means of production. In such a society, the means of production (the Base in the architectural metaphor Marx uses to analyze and describe the structure of any given society in written human history) are possessed in common by all people rather than being owned by an elite ruling class.  Marx believed that Economic Determinism, Dialectical Materialism and Class Struggle were the three principles that explained his theories. (Clarification: Though Marx does attribute a teleological function to the economic, he is no determinist. As he and Engels write in ''The Communist Manifesto'', the class struggle in its capitalist phase could well end "in the common ruin of the contending classes,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Communist Manifesto|last=Marx|first=Karl, and Friedrich Engels|publisher=Norton|year=2013|isbn=|location=New York|pages=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as Terry Eagleton argues in ''Why Marx Was Right,'' "Capitalism can be used to build socialism, but there is no sense in which the whole historical process is secretly labouring towards this goal")&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Why Marx Was Right|last=Eagleton|first=Terry|publisher=Yale UP|year=2011|isbn=|location=New Haven|pages=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Bourgeoisie (Dominant class who control and own the means of production) and Proletariat (Subordinate class: the ones who do not own and control the means of production) were the only two classes who engaged in hostile interaction to achieve class consciousness. (Clarification: In Marx's thought, it is only the proletariat, the working class, that must achieve class consciousness. The bourgeoisie is already quite well aware of its position and power in the capitalist paradigm. As individuals, workers know that they are being exploited in order to produce [[surplus value]] (value produced by the worker that is appropriated by the capitalists); however, the working class must realize that they are being exploited not only as individuals but as a class. It is upon this realization that the working class reaches [[class consciousness]]).  Marx believed that all past history is a struggle between hostile and competing economic classes in state of change.  Marx and [[Friedrich Engels]] collaborated to produce a range of publications based on capitalism, class struggles and socialist movements.

These theories and ideologies can be found within three published works: 
* ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' 
* [[A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy|''Preface to the Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy'']] (1859)
* ''[[Das Kapital]]'' or ''Capital'' (1867)

The first publication ''Communist Manifesto'' (1848) argues that ‘the history of all hitherto existing societies is the history of class struggle’.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted Marx – W Duiker &amp; J Spielvogel, The Essential World History, vol, II: since 1500, 3rd ed, Thomson Higher Education, Belmont, 2008, p. 428&lt;/ref&gt;  As class struggle is the engine room of history, to understand the course of history, one must analyse the class relations that typify different historical epochs, the antagonisms and forms of class struggle embodied in such class relations. This involves the development of class consciousness and follows the revolutionary movements that challenge the dominant classes. It extends to rating the success of these revolutions in developing new modes of production and forms of social organization.&lt;ref&gt;D Mclellan, The Thought of Karl Marx, Macmillan Press, London, 1971, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;  

In contrast to the ''Manifesto'', ''Preface to the Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy'' (1859) and ''Capital'' (1867) focus on the unfolding logic of a system, rather than class struggle. These provide an alternative account of historical development and emphasize the self-destructive contradictions and law of motion of specific modes of production.&lt;ref&gt;R Stones, Key Sociological Thinkers, Macmillan Press, London, 1998, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Preface'' argues that society’s economic organization consists of a distinctive pattern of forces and relations of productions. From this foundation arises a complex political and ideological superstructure,&lt;ref&gt;D Mclellan, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;  where economic development impacts upon societal progress.  

''Capital'' was more concerned with the genesis and dynamic of capitalism. As Mclellan (1971) states, ‘it refers to class struggle mainly in the context of the struggle between capital and labour, within capitalism, rather than over its suppression’.&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in D Mclellan, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Capital'' was less concerned with forecasting how capitalism would be overthrown, than considering how it had developed and how it functioned.&lt;ref&gt;I McIntosh, Classical Sociological Theory: A Reader, Edinburgh University Press, Great Britain, 1997, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; The key to understanding this logic was the ‘commodity’ form of social relations – a form that was most fully developed only in capitalism.

== Ideologies ==
It is through the theories of class struggle, politics and economics that Marxist literary criticism emerged. The thought behind Marxist Criticism is that works of literature are mere products of history that can be analyzed by looking at the social and material conditions in which they were constructed.&lt;ref&gt;K Siegel, ‘Introduction to Modern Literary Theory’, viewed 15 March 2011, http://www.kristisiegel.com/theory.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  Marx’s ''Capital'' states that 'the mode of production of material life determines altogether the social, political, and intellectual life process. It is not the consciousness of men that determines their being, but on the contrary their social being, that determines their consciousness.' Put simply, the social situation of the author determines the types of characters that will develop, the political ideas displayed and the economical statements developed in the text.

== The development of Marxist criticism ==
Although Marx and Friedrich Engels detailed theories of socialism in the mid-nineteenth century, it was not until the 1920s that Marxist literary theory was systematized. The greatest impetus for this standardization came after the [[October Revolution]] of 1917 in Russia. The event instigated a change in belief around socialist ideals in government and society.&lt;ref&gt;K Siegel&lt;/ref&gt;   While these ideals developed, [[socialist realism]] was accepted as the highest form of literature – a theory based on an art movement that depicted and glorified the proletariat's struggle towards societal progress. These ideas guided both literary creation and official literary criticism in the Soviet Union,&lt;ref&gt;K Siegel&lt;/ref&gt;  where works focused on the lives of the different classes. In the years since then, the beliefs of some Marxist schools regarding literary theory have been modified to acknowledge that literary creation is a result of both subjective inspiration and the objective influence of the writer's surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;K Siegel&lt;/ref&gt;  This system of belief relies on the social classes as well as the economic and political development of society. Thus, Marx’s theories intertwined with the emerging ideologies of the new Russian movement and spread throughout the world.

== Writers influenced by Marxist criticism ==
In addition to being the guiding principle behind most literary works in Soviet Russia, Marxism also greatly influenced many Western writers. [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]], [[Claude McKay]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Simone de Beauvoir]], and [[Bertold Brecht]] were deeply influenced by Marxist and socialist theories of the day, and much of this type of reflection is evident in their writings of the time.&lt;ref&gt;K Siegel&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[theatre]], the '''master electrician''' (or '''chief electrician''' in the UK) is responsible for implementing the lighting design for a production drawn up by the [[lighting designer]]. This involves overseeing the preparation, hanging, connection and focusing of [[stage lighting]] fixtures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Parker | first = W. Oren | title = Scene Design and Stage Lighting | isbn = 0-03-028777-4 | publisher = [[Holt, Rinehart and Winston]] | date = 1990 | page = 263 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This can be done on a show-by-show basis, or as a resident position of a specific theatre. The tool of the trade of the theatrical master electrician is the [[adjustable spanner]] or crescent wrench, used to secure [[stage lighting instrument]]s from lighting positions in the theatre. This wrench is typically attached to the belt or wrist with a [[lanyard]], which is important because the master electrician tends to work at great height, from [[ladder]]s, [[lift table]]s, [[catwalk (theater)|catwalks]], or lighting [[trusses]], where a falling wrench may hurt people or damage property below.

== Duties ==
The master electrician supervises and is responsible for all other electricians working on any construction or installation project. Only the master electrician can pull the permits with the electrical authority, and they can only be registered with one electrical contracting company at any one time.
Other electrical duties performed by any electrician include:
* [[Inventory]] and [[repair and maintenance]] of all lighting fixtures, cables, effects, power distribution, [[dimmer]]s, networking and [[lighting control console]]s.
* Organization and purchasing of all consumables including [[color gel]], [[Gobo (lighting)|gobos]], [[Sharpie (marker)|Sharpies]], and [[gaffer tape]].
* Planning and implementing of the cabling (''circuiting'') of lights and [[electric power]] distribution.
* Documenting and tracking of all circuiting, addressing, and system configuration in cooperation with the Lighting Designer.
* Patching assignments of the control console based on the paperwork generated by the lighting designer and the planned circuiting.
* [[Occupational safety and health]] of workers and operational decisions as the head of the electrics department.

== Training, origin, and professional affiliations ==
Master electricians go through extensive on-site and classroom training, with work in more formal settings such as schools or colleges. The designation "master" is only given to electricians who can display extensive job knowledge and are tested to have an extensive understanding of the electrical safety code.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

There are no formal certifications of the "theatrical title, master electrician", as there are in some of the more mainstream trades, but in March 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://etcp.plasa.org/faq/faq.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150611020942/http://etcp.plasa.org/faq/faq.html |archivedate=2015-06-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Entertainment Services and Technology Association|ESTA]], which merged with PLASA in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;http://sightlines.usitt.org/archive/v50/n07/stories/EstaPlasa.html&lt;/ref&gt; developed a certification process. Those who pass this rigorous test will become ETCP Certified Entertainment Electricians - and will be recognized as the industry's best.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://etcp.plasa.org/candidateinfo/electricalexam.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150901060252/http://etcp.plasa.org/candidateinfo/electricalexam.html |archivedate=2015-09-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[stagehands]] union, [[International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees|IATSE]], come close in that they offer [[apprentice]] and [[journeyman]] levels of certification. In the future, IATSE, or some of the larger local affiliations may form a more formal method of certification, which may include the title of master electrician. In the meantime, almost every production, from high school shows to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] uses the term to describe their primary electrician, regardless of their skill level or experience.

==Materials==
The only items required for the installation were a white room and a few black markers. What began as  a clean white space has been filled with letters and lines and numbers as people pass through the gallery. Each tiny line represents a different person. The thousands and thousands of lines show just how many people pass through the museum each day, how many people were, affected by this installation.

[[Image:Omni art performance 1984.jpg|thumb|300px|Jeffrey Milburn's first Omni Art performance installation Denver, Colorado (1984).]]
'''Omni art''' is an [[art movement]] that emerged in 1988 in [[New York City]] ([[United States]]).&lt;ref&gt;The Village Voice, 1988. Village Voice Media Group&lt;/ref&gt; Omni art followed [[Pop art]] and [[Postmodernism]] by shifting attention from social and political issues focusing on the emerging convergence of science, consciousness and art in the late 20th and early 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;Art and Consciousness 2008, Embracing The Journey Podcast with Karen Humphries Sallick&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Boulder Weekly, Interview for performance installation "Khymera" benefit for The Boulder County AIDS Project.1999&lt;/ref&gt;

It draws from ancient [[Sanskrit]] mysticism, [[sacred geometry]], and [[Quantum field theory|theoretical quantum physics]], and its premise maintains that sentient experience is immersed in a multidimensional [[quantum field]] that can be distilled into 5 distinct yet connected planes or dimensions that together weave a Universal fabric or “cosmic soup” of existence.&lt;ref&gt;The New York Observer 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Creating an Art Style", The Omni Art Salon Episodes 1,2,3. Omni Art Salon Productions&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Soul artwork 1981 detail.jpg|thumb|300px|Milburn's "Soul" artwork (1981) in detail..]]

==The Omni art Perspective==
Within the Omni art paradigm,&lt;ref&gt;see OMNI ART - Language of Consciousness, Milburn, Jeffrey. 2007, Voice One Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; there is an ascending series of vibrational fields ranging from the most coarse in vibratory rate (the physical dimension) to the most subtle and sublime (the etheric dimension). Each of the 5 dimensions (described below) maintain environmental vibrational fields that correlate with universal particle and wave energy signatures with qualities that can be ascertained through both [[empirical]] and subjective methodologies.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Observer'', September 23, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;OMNI ART - Language of Consciousness, Milburn, Jeffrey 2007, Voice One Publishing {{ISBN|978-1-4276-1589-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Interview, Colorado Daily,University of Colorado 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Omni art is concerned with exploring and expressing sentient life experiences of and within these 5-dimensional fields that exhibit powerful influences within and upon sentient and other life forms.&lt;ref&gt;Boulder Weekly Interview, Boulder Weekly 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

The quantum physicist postulates that a wave/particle model of energy and matter substructs universal cosmology and in this way quantum physicists and Omni artists are concerned with the same observable and intuited phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;The Creation of an Art Movement,Episodes 1-3. The Omni Art Salon 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Artist [[Jeffrey Milburn]] postulates that these 5-dimensional vibrational particle and wave fields are experienced in the human consciousness through light and sound waves forming a 5-dimensional matrix that sustains the fabric of existence for all life in the visible and invisible universe.&lt;ref&gt;Omni Art - Language of Consciousness, Milburn, Jeffrey. Voice One Publishing 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Five Dimensions of Human Experience==
[[Image:Omni Art Book.jpg|thumb|200px|Language of Consciousness (2007) is a personal description of an art style he developed during the late 1980s and founded as a style in a groundbreaking museum installation in 1991.]]

'''The Physical Dimension''' - The [[primary vibrational field]] has the most dense oscillation pattern and energy signature manifested as matter within the physical universe.

'''The Astral Dimension''' - The [[secondary vibrational field]] has a faster and finer oscillation pattern and energy signature than the physical dimension. This is where dreams, psychic cognition, human emotions, and paranormal phenomenon take place.

'''The Causal Dimension''' - The [[tertiary vibrational field]] has a faster and finer oscillation pattern and energy signature than the astral dimension, and is described by many researchers as a resonant “brain” or record of all the cause-effect relationships in the universe, known in ancient [[Vedic]] texts as the [[akasha]].

'''The Mental Dimension''' - The [[quaternary vibrational field]] has a faster and finer oscillation pattern and energy signature than the causal dimension. The human mind experiences this vibrational field as thoughts, ideas, concepts and connectivity.

'''The Etheric Dimension''' - The [[quinary dimensional field]] has a faster and finer oscillation pattern and energy signature than the mental dimension. This is the subconscious portal to the non-dual dimensions.
This dimension acts as the gateway into non-duality or singularity and can be observed in sudden, unexplainable awareness that spontaneously appears as an "aha!", or sudden, moment of realization.

==The Universalist Group Collection==

Artist [[Jeffrey Milburn]] mounted a museum installation of the foundational collection of 12 artworks called “The Universalist Group.” in 1991 at [http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/organizations/i/islip_art_museum/index.html The Islip Art Museum]&lt;ref&gt;The Islip Art Museum, Islip, New York. March 1991&lt;/ref&gt; in Islip, New York. This group of 12 assemblage artworks were created over a period of 10 years beginning in 1981, and provide the basic vocabulary for the language of the Omni art style. Milburn coined this style of art “Omni art” in 1988 when he founded this nascent art movement. The Universalist Group collection has appeared in whole or in part in all of Milburn's performance installations over the last 30 years and is described in detail in his book, OMNI ART - Language of Consciousness, Milburn’s treatise regarding Omni art.

Milburn's artworks are assemblages of found objects, canvas, and paint. Milburn describes the juxtaposition of objects in his artworks as creating a gestalt “language” allowing the observer to communicate with an inner experience he describes as a “language of consciousness” that is attuned to the observer's current state of developmental awareness. In this way, each artwork serves as a catalyst for a personal inspiration or realization that mirrors what quantum physicists describe as the observer and observed duality that collapses into a singularity field. This is the same [[Omega Point|singularity]] that scientists and ancient spiritual teachers describe as “Source” or “Oneness” that is the origination point for all particles and waves that form the phenomenon of existence.

In this way, Omni art is literally defined as “God art” or “Source art” both by intentional application and [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] utilization. The term Omni was discovered by Milburn when researching terminology that would apply to this emerging art form. Milburn describes his role as one of an artist/mystic and subsequently he has come to be known as “The Oracle of Omni.”

[[Image:Omni art universalist group.jpg|205px|thumb|left|Artist's statement from a 1991 installation at The Islip Art Museum in Islip, New York.]]

===Sacred Geometry===

One of the two primary artworks from The Universalist Group collection titled “SOUL” (1981) contains many elements that are fundamental in the science of [[sacred geometry]]. Surrounding the mirror in the center circle on this art work are 5 hand cut quartz crystals in the shape of the 5 platonic solids originally discovered and articulated upon by [[Plato]].

Milburn identified these platonic solids as corresponding to the 5-dimensional vibrational fields which he deduced constitute the basic elements forming a universal cosmological structure.

This center circle area is fronted with a 3-dimensional metaform mandala projecting out from the front of the artwork also containing many sacred geometry's. Milburn discovered 16 years after creating this artwork that its basic shape reflects the geometric shape of a black hole and posited that this peculiarity pertains to the ancient [[Kabbalistic]] theory that all in the invisible universe is reflected in the visible universe - or more commonly stated as “as above, so below.” In quantum physics jargon this same cosmological structure was articulated by physicist [[David Bohm]] as an “implicate and explicate order.”

Milburn further describes this artwork as a symbolic map or representation of universal [[cosmological]] structures that integrate with emerging scientific theories of conscious human evolution.

===The Omni art Movement===
According to Milburn, conscious human evolution is intrinsic and incontrovertible and can be seen in all aspects of life.  It naturally follows that this conscious evolution can then be observed in all the arts, sciences, and cultural idioms and he coined this process “meta-evolution” as it transcends the boundaries of [[scientific materialism]]. Reaching into the invisible regions of discovery not accessible by current technology, this evolutionary phenomenon is seen by Milburn to be the definition of the Omni art movement in the widest sense.&lt;ref&gt;Creating a New Art, The Omni Art Salon Episodes 1-3, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Rocky Mountain News, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;radio interview, KGNU Boulder Public Radio 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Boulder Museum of Contemporary Art, Public Dialogue on The Four Propositions 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Milburn states that in popular culture one can observe the contemporary appearance of this meta-evolutionary process in contemporary films, books, and videos exploring the many aspects of emerging awareness as it intersects with a popular fascination with metaphysical and [[paranormal phenomenon]].&lt;ref&gt;"Orbiting Omni Art", The Boulder Weekly 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Some of this phenomenon such as UFO sightings, and most recently the light orbs that are appearing by the hundreds of thousands in low resolution (below 2 mega-pixels) digital photographs espoused upon in [[Miceal Ledwith]] and physicist Klaus Heinemann's 2008 book [http://books.simonandschuster.ca/Orb-Project/Klaus-Heinemann/9781582701820 The Orb Project], have captured the imaginations of millions of people around the world and show no sign of abating.

[[File:Jupiter and Antiope, by Titian.jpg|thumb|450px|The ''Pardo Venus'', [[Louvre]], 196 x 385 cm]]
The '''''Pardo Venus''''' is a painting by the Venetian artist [[Titian]], completed in 1551 and now in the [[Louvre Museum]].  It is also known as '''''Jupiter and Antiope''''', since it seems to show the story of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and [[Antiope (mother of Amphion)|Antiope]] from Book VI of the ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' (lines 110-111). It is Titian's largest mythological painting,&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 532&lt;/ref&gt; and was the first major mythological painting produced by the artist for [[Philip II of Spain]].  It was long kept in the [[Royal Palace of El Pardo]] near [[Madrid]] (not to be confused with the [[Prado]], a purpose-built museum), hence its usual name; whether [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] is actually represented is uncertain. It later belonged to the English and French royal collections.
[[File:Tiziano e bottega, giove e antiope, detto la venere del pardo, 1551, 03.jpg|thumb|[[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and [[Antiope (mother of Amphion)|Antiope]]]]

Analysis of its style and composition shows that Titian modified a Bacchanalian scene he had begun much earlier in his career by completing the landscape background and adding figures.  For [[Sydney Joseph Freedberg|Sidney Freedburg]] it was "probably in substance an invention of the later 1530s, though significantly reworked later; it is full of motifs and ideas that have been recollected from an earlier and more Giorgionesque time, ordered in an obvious and uncomplicated classicizing scheme."&lt;ref&gt;Freedburg, 329&lt;/ref&gt;

Though, if Antiope is the nude, the painting meets the basic definition of Titian's famous ''poesie'' series, mythological scenes from [[Ovid]] painted for Philip, the painting is typically not counted in the series, either as it was begun well before Titian used the term in a letter to Philip, or because the nude is indeed Venus, in which case no such scene is described by Ovid.&lt;ref&gt;Brotton, 99 does include it, but it is not included by most sources. Eg: [https://www.museodelprado.es/en/whats-on/exhibition/tiziano-danae-venus-y-adonis-las-primeras-poesias/821a6867-321a-4570-a19a-db4da7e2042c the Prado] and the [http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/learn-about-art/titians-poesie-paintings?viewPage=2 National Gallery].  For Venus being spied on by satyrs, see Bull, 207-210&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Venus or Antiope?==
As to the subject, Titian himself appears to describe it simply as "the landscape", and his son [[Orazio Vecellio|Orazio]] calls it "the nude woman with the landscape and the satyr", both in letters to Philip, but later an inventory of El Pardo calls it "Jupiter and Antiope".&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 532&lt;/ref&gt;  In Madrid in the 1620s, [[Vicente Carducho]] (d. 1638, see below) referred to its subject as "Antiope and some shepherds and satyrs on a large canvas".&lt;ref&gt;Brotton, 99&lt;/ref&gt;  In the correspondence of the French and Spanish ambassadors as Charles I's collection was being sold in 1649-53, the nude is "Venus".&lt;ref&gt;Brotton, 294, 301&lt;/ref&gt;  As Malcolm Bull points out, "In later inventories the terms "naked woman" and "Venus" are almost interchangeable", and the presence of her son Cupid an uncertain indicator, as he often appears with other people.&lt;ref&gt;Bull, 208-211, 211 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Giorgione - Sleeping Venus - Google Art Project 2.jpg|thumb|[[Giorgione]]'s ''[[Dresden Venus]]'', completed by Titian, c. 1510]]
The painting is very large, and the figures somewhat disconnected, the composition divided into two by the tree at centre. In the right foreground we have a scene that would have been familiar to well-educated Renaissance viewers as Jupiter, having taken the form of a [[satyr]], creeping up on the sleeping nymph Antiope, and lifting her drapery to view her naked. He will shortly rape her.  Possibly the situation is only borrowed from this story, but all Titian's other mythological paintings for Philip show scenes from Ovid, where Antiope's story features (''[[Metamorphoses]]'', VI, 110-111).  Scenes of satyr voyeurism or sexual assault, given titles such as ''Nymph Surprised by a Satyr'', are found in art, mostly later than this, but only a very rash satyr would treat the goddess Venus in this way.  The painting can be compared to his ''[[The Bacchanal of the Andrians]]'' of 1523-24 ([[Prado]]), where an apparently unconscious nude in a version of the ''Dresden Venus'' pose shares the picture space with a group of revellers in a mixture of nudity, contemporary and classical dress. 

Venus or Antiope sleeps as yet undisturbed, not only by the voyeur, but a hunting scene above her, where hounds have brought down a stag, and immediately left of her, a satyr or [[faun]] with the legs of a [[goat]] seated on the ground, in conversation with a lady in contemporary dress.  Immediately beside them stands a hunter, with large dogs, and at far left another huntsman blows a horn.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, 159&lt;/ref&gt;

Over Venus' head, [[Cupid]] perches in a tree, with an arrow in his bow, apparently pointed at Jupiter.  In the middle distance a naked couple, apparently both women, talk or kiss on the banks of a river.  The river has a wide waterfall above the stag, and presumably then flows above the conversing couple before perhaps circling round behind the viewer to create the water behind the Jupiter/satyr, but this is not shown clearly, which is rather typical of Titian.  To the right, the landscape includes a contemporary farmhouse at the top of the rise, and a distant settlement dominated by a church tower and steeple.  Distant mountains complete the view, which like many Titian landscapes reflects the country between Venice and his hometown of [[Pieve di Cadore]] in the mountains, though he does not seem to have closely depicted specific locations.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 15-17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning==
Art historians have struggled somewhat in trying to find a coherent meaning for these disparate elements.  Their incongruous combination makes it something of a test case for a long-running dispute over the extent to which Titian's mythological paintings (and to some extent those of Venetian painters in general) carry "great complexity of allegorical meanings", in the way that some works of other Renaissance artists are generally accepted to do.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, 135-136, 135 quoting from Charles Hope, a leading opponent of "complexity" in this context; Hope's position is set out in Hope (1983), 35-37, and Hope (1994), 52-60&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[Harold Wethey]] was not impressed by the idea that the different elements represented different modes of life: "active" in the hunters, "voluptuous" in Venus/Antiope  and Jupiter, and "contemplative" in the couple sitting on the grass.&lt;ref&gt;Wethey, ''The Paintings of Titian'', Vol 3, 56, 1975, Phaidon&lt;/ref&gt;  Another line of thinking is to compare Venus to the stag brought down by the hounds, the stag then becoming a ''cerf fragile'', in an old Gothic visual metaphor with the hunted stag representing the life and trials of [[Christ]] or man.  This draws on a wealth of imagery in religious writings, ultimately going back to ''[[Psalm 41]]/42'': "As a deer pants for flowing streams, so pants my soul for you, O God..".&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, 142-149; Psalm 41 in the [[Vulgate Bible]], 42 in Protestant numberings. [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+42&amp;version=ESV ESV text, from biblegateway]&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively it can be seen as an essentially decorative piling-up of different groups of subject matter with no overall complex meaning intended, but an impressive effect.

==Titian's reclining nudes==
[[File:Tiziano - Venere di Urbino - Google Art Project.jpg|340px|thumb|Titian's ''[[Venus of Urbino]]'', c. 1534, [[Uffizi]]]]
[[File:Venus and organist and little dog.jpg|thumb|340px|''[[Venus and Musician]]'' or ''Venus with an Organist and a Dog'', [[Prado]], c. 1550, which hung in the same room in [[Whitehall Palace]].]]
The painting is a development of Titian's compositions with a reclining female nude in the Venetian style.  The pose of the ''Pardo Venus'', with one arm drawn up to support the head and the other resting near the crotch, is essentially the same as that in [[Giorgione]]'s ''[[Dresden Venus]]'', which after his death in 1510 was completed by Titian.  The pose apart, the paintings offer a strong contrast, with the noisy and hectic scene in the ''Pardo Venus'' completely different from the tranquil and deserted landscape in Dresden.  Around 1534 Titian had painted the ''[[Venus of Urbino]]'', and a repetition of this from 1545, perhaps a lost recorded ''Venus'' sent to Charles V, "was the basis" for the ''[[Venus and Musician]]'' series, which exists in several versions.&lt;ref&gt;Falomir, 61–62&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike the others, the Cupid in most versions of ''Venus and Musician'', and probably in the ''Pardo Venus'', does allow a clear identification of the female as Venus, despite the modern decor.&lt;ref&gt;Falomir, 67. The ''Dresden Venus'' originally had a Cupid, later painted over.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Otherwise the paintings are in danger of falling into the category showing [[courtesan]]s, though these are also often described as "Venus", if only to retain some propriety.&lt;ref&gt;Bull, 211&lt;/ref&gt;  In all an unembarassed Venus is completely naked, except for a gauzy cloth over her crotch in some versions, but wears several pieces of very expensive jewellery,&lt;ref&gt;McIver, 14&lt;/ref&gt; typical aspects of courtesan pictures.&lt;ref&gt;Hollander, 314-21, for two views on "courtesan" pictures&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[Kenneth Clark]] described the ''Pardo Venus'' as a "laboured attempt to recapture his early style", and the Dresden/Urbino pose here "much coarsened".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 121&lt;/ref&gt;  A more original composition and physique, also begun in the mid-1540s, but with versions painted in the 1550s and perhaps 1560s, is used in the [[Danaë (Titian series)|series of ''Danaë'' paintings]], which Clark sees as Titian adopting the conventions for the nude prevailing outside Venice; "in the rest of Italy bodies of an entirely different shape had long been fashionable".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 122–123, 122 quoted&lt;/ref&gt; 

For Clark, the Venus of the ''Venus and Musician'' versions, where the head changes direction but the body remains exactly the same, is "entirely Venetian, younger sister of all those expensive ladies whom [[Palma Vecchio]], [[Paris Bordone]] and [[Bonifazio Veronese|Bonifazio]] painted for local consumption."&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 122&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1574 Titian had still not been paid for the painting, according to a list he sent Philip's secretary and [[favourite]] [[Antonio Pérez (statesman)|Antonio Pérez]].  The painting was still in El Pardo when most of the palace burnt down in 1603, with the loss of several Titians and other important art.  [[Vicente Carducho]]  (1576/78–1638), an Italian-born court painter in Spain, records that when he heard the news, the first question of King [[Philip III of Spain]] was to ask if the Venus had been lost.  Told that it survived, he is said to have commented "I am satisfied, for the rest will be redone".&lt;ref&gt;Brotton, 99&lt;/ref&gt;  

Despite this prestige, the painting was given to [[Charles I of England]] in 1623 when, as [[Prince of Wales]], he made a quixotic, unauthorized and unplanned visit to [[Madrid]] to try to acquire a Spanish bride.&lt;ref&gt;Brotton, 99 on the gift, 85-103 on the trip&lt;/ref&gt;  After Charles' execution the valuers assessing his collection in [[Whitehall Palace]] found the "great Lardge and famous peece" in the "Second and Middle Privie Lodging Roome", along with the ''[[Venus and Musician]]'' now in the Prado, and valued them at £500 and £150 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Penny, 303&lt;/ref&gt;  They were both bought on the same day in 1649 at one of the sales of Charles' art collection by [[John Hutchinson (Roundhead)|Colonel John Hutchinson]], who paid £600 and £165.&lt;ref&gt;Brotton, 236&lt;/ref&gt;  Hutchinson was buying as an investment, and as the major continental collectors realized the situation and organized agents, he sold all his major purchases within a few years.&lt;ref&gt;Brotton, 300-301, 308-9 and see index&lt;/ref&gt;   

[[Alonso de Cárdenas (ambassador)|Alonso de Cárdenas]] the Spanish ambassador, managing purchases in England a year or two later, declined to buy the ''Pardo Venus'', preferring [[Correggio]]'s ''[[Venus with Mercury and Cupid ('The School of Love')]]'' (now [[National Gallery]]), as "no es tan profano como la otra, Venus dormido y el Satyro" ("it is not as profane as the other, Venus sleeping and the satyr").&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Maria Leilani ed., ''Collections of Painting in Madrid, 1601–1755 (Parts 1 and 2)'', 70, 1997, Getty Publications, {{ISBN|9780892364961}}, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=eJhbCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA70 google books]. Alternatively, Brotton, 294, who translates "profano" as "irreverent".&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1653, Hutchinson skillfully negotiated Bordeaux-Neufville, who combined the roles of French ambassador and [[Cardinal Mazarin]]'s art agent, into paying £1,200 for it.&lt;ref&gt;Brotton, 300-301&lt;/ref&gt; It was acquired from Mazarin's heirs in 1661 by [[Louis XIV of France]], and remained in the French royal collection until this passed to the Louvre Museum.&lt;ref&gt;Louvre&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Greekreligion-animalsacrifice-corinth-6C-BCE.jpg|thumb|300px|One of the [[Pitsa panels]], 6th century BCE, paint on wood, showing an animal sacrifice in [[Corinth]]]]
[[File:Pinax prothesis Louvre CA255.jpg|350px|thumb|Terracotta funerary pinax, Athens, 560-550 BC]] 
In the modern study of the culture of [[ancient Greece]] and [[Magna Graecia]], a '''''pinax''''' (πίναξ) (plural '''''pinakes''''' - πίνακες), meaning "board",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpi%2Fnac πίναξ],
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; is a '''votive tablet''' of painted [[wood]], or [[terracotta]], [[marble]] or [[bronze]] [[relief]] that served as a [[votive deposit|votive object]] deposited in a [[sanctuary]] or as a memorial affixed within a [[burial chamber]].&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 127&lt;/ref&gt; 
Such ''pinakes'' feature in the classical collections of most comprehensive museums.

==Other uses==
[[File:Pinax with Persephone and Hades Enthroned, 500-450 BC, Greek, Locri Epizephirii, Mannella district, Sanctuary of Persephone, terracotta - Cleveland Museum of Art - DSC08242.JPG|thumb|left|Terracotta pinax of [[Persephone]] and [[Hades]] from [[Locri]] (Museo Nazionale di [[Reggio di Calabria]])]]

To the ancient Greeks ''pinax'' seems also to have been a general term for a plate, but this is generally not followed in modern archaeological usage.  In daily life ''pinax'' might equally denote a wax-covered [[Wax tablet|writing tablet]]. In Christian contexts,  painted [[icon]]s ("images") are ''pinakes''. In the [[theatre of ancient Greece]], they were images probably usually painted on cloth, but also carved either in stone or wood, that were hung behind, and sometimes below, the stage area as scenery, or as permanent decoration.  The term [[pinacotheca]] for a picture gallery derives from such usages.

==Materials and use==
When they are recovered by archaeologists, painted wooden ''pinakes'' have usually lost all but faint traces of their painted images - the [[Pitsa panels]] being the outstanding exception.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 69-70&lt;/ref&gt; Moulded terracotta ''pinakes'' were also brightly painted.  Marble ''pinakes'' were individually carved, but terracotta ones were impressed in molds, and bronze ones might be repeatedly cast from a model from which wax and resin impressions were made, in the technique called [[lost wax casting]]. 

A few elaborate gold plaques have survived from the 7th century BC, many made in [[Rhodes]], with deity figures, especially [[Artemis]], shown in an orientalizing [[Daedalic]] style.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 33&lt;/ref&gt;

They often have two holes for a suspension cord, and are shown in [[Pottery of ancient Greece|vase-paintings]] both hanging on temple walls, and also suspended from trees in the sanctuary area.  The Roman architect [[Vitruvius]]  mentions the ''pinakes'' in the [[cella]]s of temples, and even in the possession of private persons. Such a collection was a ''pinakothek'',&lt;ref&gt;Compare ''bibliothek'', a library, which provides the designation in several modern European languages.&lt;/ref&gt; which is a modern German term for an [[art museum]], such as the [[Alte Pinakothek]] of Munich.

[[Callimachus]], the Alexandrian poet and scholar at the [[Library of Alexandria]], formed a kind of index, or "map picture" of the library's contents, which he named ''[[Pinakes]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://dc-mrg.english.ucsb.edu/conference/2002/documents/christian_jacob.html Christian Jacob, "From Alexandria to Alexandria: Scholarly Interfaces of a Universal Library" 2002.]&lt;/ref&gt; a term that continued in use in bibliographic catalogs.

==Large finds==
[[File:Plaque Penteskouphia MNB2858.jpg|thumb|Pottery kiln, Penteskouphia]] 
At [[Locri]] in southern Italy, thousands of carefully buried ''pinakes'' have been recovered, most of them from the sanctuary of [[Persephone]] or that of [[Aphrodite]].&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 127; [http://www.naplesldm.com/pinax.htm The Pinakes of Locri] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807033135/http://www.naplesldm.com/pinax.htm |date=2016-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another large group of over 1,000 pottery pinakes was found at the site of [[Penteskouphia]], just outside [[Corinth]].  These are mostly in the [[Antikensammlung Berlin]], with some in Corinth and the [[Louvre]].  As well as the usual religious scenes, some of these show depictions of potters at work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/votive-tablet Louvre, "Votive tablet"]&lt;/ref&gt;  Berlin also has a smaller group of fragments from the [[Kerameikos]] cemetery in [[Athens]], many by the painter [[Exekias]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Pinakes_by_Exekias_at_the_Antikensammlung_Berlin Commons category "Pinakes by Exekias at the Antikensammlung Berlin"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etruscan art==
In [[Etruscan art]], rather larger terracotta plaques than are typical in Greek art have been found in tombs, some forming a series that creates in effect a portable wall-painting.  Wealthy Etruscan families often had tombs with painted walls, which the Greeks did not.  The "Boccanera" tomb at the Banditaccia [[necropolis]] at [[Cerveteri]] contained five panels almost a metre high set round the wall, which are now in the [[British Museum]].  Three of them form a single scene, apparently the [[Judgement of Paris]], while the other two flanked the inside of the entrance, with [[sphinx]]es acting as [[tomb guardian]]s. They date to about 560 BC. Fragments of similar panels have been found in city centre sites, presumably from temples, elite houses and other buildings, where the subjects include scenes of everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 242-243&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Portugaliae Monumenta Historica''''' (Historical Monuments of Portugal, abbreviated PMH) is a collection of &lt;!--[[Critical edition|critically edited]]--&gt; texts from [[Portuguese history]]. Inspired by the ''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]'', it was published by the [[Academia das Ciências de Lisboa]] between 1856 and 1917 and divided into four sections: ''Scriptores'' (writers), ''Leges et Consuetudines'' (laws and customs), ''Diplomata et Chartae'' (diplomas and charters) and ''Inquisitiones'' (investigations). The first three were compiled under the direction of [[Alexandre Herculano]] before 1873, and the last, ''Inquisitiones'', between 1888 and 1897, after his death. The documents date from the [[Middle Ages]] and are primarily in [[Middle Latin]] and [[Old Portuguese]].&lt;ref&gt;João Dionísio, "After the Lisbon Earthquake: Reassembling History", ''European Studies: A Journal of European Culture, History and Politics'' '''26'''.1 (2008): 151–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=March 2009}}
The '''prompter''' (Fr., Ger. ''souffleur''; It. ''rammentatore'', ''suggeritore'') in an [[opera]] house gives the singers the opening words of each phrase a few seconds early. Prompts are mouthed silently or hurled lyrically in a half-voice, audible (hopefully) only on stage. (This is in contrast to the [[Prompter (theatre)|prompter]] in a [[Theatre (building)|theatre]] who aids actors who have forgotten their words or lines.)

Opera prompters are traditionally housed in a stuffy wooden box at the center-front edge of the stage, above the [[orchestra pit]]. They are visible to the performers and no one else. Technology has brought [[air conditioner|cool air]] and small display screens, among other advances, to support their work.

Effective prompting can be a challenge. The American prompter Philip Eisenberg recounts the story at a [[Maria Callas]] performance when she needed louder prompts. The famed diva swooped down in a curtsy right in front of the prompter’s box and — mid-curtsy, unnoticed by the audience — gave the Italian command "più forte!" (louder) to her boxed colleague.{{full citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Prompters attend all rehearsals, mark up any adjustments or clarifications to the score, and generally "prepare" singers for a role. Their profile is low, and opera program books often credit them only under "musical preparation" or some similar moniker.

'''Qajar art''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: هنر دوره قاجاریه) refers to the art, architecture, and art-forms of the [[Qajar dynasty]] of the late [[Persian Empire]], which lasted from 1781 to 1925 in [[Iran]] ([[Name of Iran|Persia]]).

The boom in artistic expression that occurred during the Qajar era was the fortunate side effect of the period of relative peace that accompanied the rule of [[Agha Muhammad Khan]] and his descendants. With his ascension, the bloody turmoil that had been the 18th century in Persia came to a close, and made it possible for the peacetime arts to again flourish.

==Qajar painting==
Most notably, Qajar art is recognizable for its distinctive style of portraiture.

===Origins and influences===
The roots of traditional Qajar painting can be found in the style of painting that arose during the preceding [[Safavid]] empire. During this time, there was a great deal of European influence on [[Persian culture]], especially in the arts of the royalty and noble classes. European art was undergoing a period of [[Realism (arts)|realism]] and this can be seen in the depiction of objects especially by Qajar artists. The European influence is very well evidenced in the preëminent position and prestige of [[oil painting]]. While oil paintings had been par for the course during previous periods of Persian art, it was the influence of the European masters, like [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] and [[Rembrandt]], the true masters of oil portraiture, that raised it to the highest level. Heavy application of paint and dark, rich, [[color saturation|saturated]] colors are elements of Qajar painting that owe their influences directly to the European style.

===Development of painting style===
While the depiction of inanimate objects and [[still life]]s is seen to be very realistic in Qajar painting, the depiction of human beings is decidedly [[idealism|idealised]]. This is especially evident in the portrayal of Qajar royalty, where the subjects of the paintings are very formulaically placed and situated to achieve a desired effect.

====Royal portraiture====
Most famous of the Qajar artworks are the portraits that were made of the various Persian [[Shahs]]. Each ruler, and many of their sons and other relatives, commissioned official portraits of themselves either for private use or public display. The most famous of these are of course the myriad portraits which were painted of [[Fath Ali Shah Qajar]], who, with his narrow waist, long black bifurcated beard and deepset eyes, has come to exemplify the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] image of the great Oriental Ruler. Many of these paintings were by the artist [[Mihr 'Ali]]. While the portraits were executed at various points throughout the life of the [[Fath Ali Shah|Shah]], they adhere to a [[wiktionary:canon|canon]] in which the distinctive features of the ruler are emphasized. Portraits exist of Fath Ali Shah in a very wide assortment of situations, from the armor-clad warrior king to the flower smelling gentleman, but all are similar in their depiction of the Shah, differing only slightly, usually due to the specific artist of the portrait. It is only appropriate that this particular Shah be so immortalized in this style, as it was under his rule as the second Qajar shah that the style truly flourished. One reason for this were the stronger and stronger [[diplomacy|diplomatic ties]] that the Qajar rulers were nurturing with European powers.

As the Shangri La Center for Islamic Arts and Culture notes, "Later Iranian art of the Afsharid (1736–96), Zand (1750–94) and Qajar (1779–1924) periods is distinguished by the depiction of life-size figures, whether in stone relief, tilework or painting on canvas. In the latter category, Qajar rulers like Fath ‘Ali Shah (r. 1797–1834) perpetuated a widespread interest in large-scale portraiture (even sending portraits to political rivals)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.shangrilahawaii.org/islamic-art-collection/collection-highlights/qajar-iran/Painting/|title=Doris Duke's Shangri La {{!}} Painting|website=www.shangrilahawaii.org|access-date=2016-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[Fath Ali Shah]] himself never visited Europe, many portraits of him were sent with envoys in the effort to convey the imperial majesty of the Persian court. With the rise of [[Nasser-al-Din Shah|Nassirudin Shah]], [[photography]] became much more important in the art of the period, and portraiture, while still used for official purposes, fell gradually out of favor. In addition, as Nassirudin Shah was the first Persian ruler to visit Europe, the official sending of portraits was left by the wayside, a relic of times gone by.

====Other portraiture====
[[File:Khusraw Discovers Shirin Bathing, From Pictorial Cycle of Eight Poetic Subjects, mid 18th century.jpg|200px|thumbnail|[[Khosrow II|Khusraw]] Discovers [[Shirin]] Bathing'', From Pictorial Cycle of Eight Poetic Subjects, mid 18th century. [[Brooklyn Museum]].]]
The depiction of nonroyal persons also has a very important place in the explanation and understanding of Qajar art. While naturally not commoners, the subjects of these portraits were often minor princes (of which there were many!), the grandsons, nephews, and great-nephews of the ruling or previously ruling [[Shahs]]. These princes, with the wealth and position of their families, had very little else to do but contribute to the arts, so their patronage was certainly less than detrimental to the arts of the time. Often, portraits of this class would be commissioned as depictions of family groups, depicting the male, an idealized, nubile wife, and their perfectly formed child. Other times, they would be in the form of a royal portrait, depicting solely the male commissioner, but with subtle variations making it clear that the sitter is not a Royal. One way that this was accomplished was through a [[cartouche]] that was displayed next to the head of each portrait's subject, clarifying who was being depicted, and any relevant titles (such as Soltān, shāhzādeh, &amp;c.). For the ruling head of [[Persia]], this cartouche is fairly regulated, ("al-soltān ''Official name'' Shāh Qājār"), while for anyone else, it may include a longer name, a lesser title or a short genealogy.

=====Depiction of women=====
One of the most unusual practices in Qajar art is the depiction of women. In such a strongly [[Islamic]] society, it seems to contradict that view that the women of Qajar Persia are depicted in much art as wearing very little in the way of modest clothing. This is strikingly at odds with the prevalent use of the [[chador|chādor]] ({{lang-fa|چادر,}}, lit. "tent") in Persia.

==Calligraphy in the Qajar era==
[[Islamic calligraphy|Calligraphy]] is and has been the definitive Persian art form. There exists a prohibition in [[Islam]] against the depiction of human beings, similar to the [[Jewish]] rule against graven images, and as such, calligraphy and its associated art forms became a very important part of Islamic expression. Upon the introduction of the [[Arabic script]] to Persia, the people therein set themselves to making it their own.

===The Shāhanshāhnāmeh===

During the reign of [[Fath Ali Shah Qajar]], a work of literature and art was commissioned that was intended to rival the work of [[Ferdowsi]]. This book was called the ''Shāhanshāhnāmeh'' ({{lang|fa|شاهنشاهنامه}}, lit. "Book of the King of Kings"). It is apparent to the scholar of [[Persian art|Persian art and literature]] that this book is based upon the work of art known as the ''[[Shahnameh|Shāhnāmeh]]'' ({{lang|fa| شاهنامه}}, lit. "Book of Kings") which was written by Ferdowsi in the year 1000 . The Shahnameh, in brief, chronicles the quasi-mythical founding of the Persian Empire and the [[Shahnameh Characters|heroes and villains]] who punctuated its inception. This Sahanshahnameh is now situated in the National Library of Vienna, Austria.

==Qajar textile arts==
The [[costume|sartorial]] inclinations of the Qajar period were not so very different from those of earlier period until the latter half of the era. As is evidenced by the early portraiture of [[Fath Ali Shah Qajar]] and [[Mohammad Shah Qajar]], the traditional styles of dress in Persia were preserved, but as Western influences became more and more prevalent, the royal portraits began to depict the [[Shah]] in a more Western, military style garb (such as the portrait of [[Nasser-al-Din Shah|Nassirudin Shah Qajar]] above). This is not to say, however, that the traditional textile arts of Persia had fallen into disuse. While the Shah wished to appear advanced and western to European monarchs and diplomats, it was still his duty to exude the pride and ancient glory of the Persian Empire, so court dress retained very strong elements of traditional dress.

==Reception==
The list received mixed response from fellow publications. Writing for ''[[Flavorwire]]'', Judy Berman criticized the selection of the songwriters, saying "Predictably, it's over 70% white and features only nine solo female songwriters (five other women are included as part of mixed-gender writing teams). Classic rock is overrepresented; every other genre and subgenre of popular music is underrepresented."&lt;ref name="flavorwire"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flavorwire.com/532955/does-rolling-stone-know-it-declared-songwriting-dead|work=[[Flavorwire]]|title=Does ‘Rolling Stone’ Know It Declared Songwriting Dead?|first=Judy |last=Berman|date=August 17, 2015|accessdate=August 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geeta Dayal from ''[[The Guardian]]'' accused "corporate sponsorship" in determining the list's content.&lt;ref name="theguardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/aug/24/rolling-stones-greatest-songwriters-list-corporate-sponsorship-apple-music|title=The real peril in Rolling Stone's greatest songwriters wasn't the lack of diversity – it was the corporate sponsorship|work=[[The Guardian]]|first=Geeta|last=Dayal|date=August 24, 2015|accessdate=August 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Moon from [[NPR]] wrote that "This list represents another trip through the hagiographic, hermetically sealed [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|rock hall of fame]], with the same stars you've been reading about in Rolling Stone since the dinosaur age."&lt;ref name="npr"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2015/08/24/433206610/the-one-real-problem-with-rolling-stones-greatest-songwriters-of-all-time|first=Tom|last=Moon|publisher=[[NPR]]|title=The One Real Problem With Rolling Stone's 'Greatest Songwriters Of All Time'|date=August 24, 2015|accessdate=August 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' editor Martin Chilton responded with a list of 100 best songwriters missed out by ''Rolling Stone'', including [[Cole Porter]], [[Townes Van Zandt]], [[Ewan MacColl]], [[Kate Bush]], and [[Ray Charles]].&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/what-to-listen-to/100-great-songwriters/|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|title=100 great songwriters not in the Rolling Stone list|date=May 17, 2016|first=Martin|last=Chilton|accessdate=August 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1982">In philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]]'s ''[[Either/Or]]'', the '''rotation method''' is the mechanism used by higher level aesthetes in order to avoid [[boredom]]. The method is an essential [[hedonism|hedonistic]] aspect of the aesthetic way of life.

==Overview==
Kierkegaard likens the rotation method to the [[crop rotation]] used in [[agriculture]], in which the soil is constantly rotated in order to maximize the use of nutrients for the crops. For the aesthete, one constantly changes what one is doing in order to maximize the enjoyment and pleasure derived from each activity.

A consequence of the rotation method would be the aesthete's lack of commitment to any one thing. Commitment requires one to constantly repeat an activity; however, for the aesthetic, repeating an activity leads to boredom, as this activity is no longer novel.

The rotation method, Kierkegaard argues, would eventually lead aesthetes to a state of [[Despair (emotion)|despair]], because all activities, no matter how unique or new, will eventually become boring:

:''I don't feel like doing anything. I don't feel like riding – the motion is too powerful; I don't feel like walking – it is too tiring; I don't feel like lying down, for either I have to stay down, and I don't feel like doing that or I would have to get up again, and I don't feel like doing that, either. ''Summa Summarum'': I don't feel like doing anything.'' – ''Either/Or'', p. 4&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard, Søren. ''Either/Or''. Princeton, 1985. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The aesthete, Kierkegaard predicts, realizing and responding to the futility of one's hedonistic finite aims, will yearn to experience a more meaningful life.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, Michael. ''Kierkegaard''. Oneworld, 2003. p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Royal Palace of Mari''' was the royal residence of the rulers of the ancient kingdom of [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] in eastern [[Syria]]. Situated centrally amidst [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Syria]], [[Babylon]], [[Levant]], and other Mesopotamian city-states, Mari acted as the “middle-man” to these larger, powerful kingdoms.{{sfn|Malamat|1989|pp=2}} Both the size and grand nature of the palace demonstrate the importance of Mari during its long history, though the most intriguing feature of the palace is the nearly 25,000 tablets found within the palace rooms.{{sfn|Malamat|1989|pp=6}} The royal palace was discovered in 1935, excavated with the rest of the city throughout the 1930s, and is considered one of the most important finds made at Mari&lt;ref name="Kuhrt"&gt;Kuhrt, 1997, p.102.&lt;/ref&gt; [[André Parrot]] led the excavations and was responsible for the discovery of the city and the palace. Thousands of clay tablets were discovered through the efforts of André Bianquis, which provided archaeologists the tools to learn about, and to understand, everyday life at the palace and in Mari.&lt;ref name="Parrot"&gt;Parrot, 1955, pg. 24-5.&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of the tablets also aided in the labeling of various rooms in terms of their purpose and function.&lt;ref name="Burney"&gt;Burney, 1977, pg. 92-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
{{Mari, Syria}}

The palace reached its grandest state with its last renovation under king [[Zimri-Lim]] in the 18th century BC; in addition to serving as the home of the royal family, the palace would have also housed royal guards, state workers, members of the military, and those responsible for the daily activities of the kingdom.{{sfn|Parrot|1955|pp=22-23}} The apartments of the king were well separated from the rest of the palace and relatively simple to identify when Parrot led the excavations.{{sfn|Parrot|1955|pp=23}} While most rooms in the palace were interconnected and allowed access to one another, the private quarters of the royal family were very isolated. Parrot emphasized the amount of privacy afforded the king and his family, as well as the maximum level of security that was maintained through the architecture of the building.{{sfn|Parrot|1955|pp=23}}

An entry gate was the only access point of the large palace complex, thus providing added security. The layout of the palace was also built with the security of the royal family in mind. A central court was surrounded by a series of smaller rooms. Entryways to courtyards were positioned in such a way as to make any attacks on those within the courtyard nearly impossible.{{sfn|Burney|1977|pp=94}} Such architectural features did not allow any visitor to peer directly into one of the open courts, but forced a visitor to change direction and enter on the side of the court; anyone wishing to use a weapon would not have been able to directly access any room inside of the main gateway.{{sfn|Burney|1977|pp=94}}

The royal palace at Mari was decorated with frescoes and statues. Decoration different depending on the function of the room.{{sfn|Burney|1977|pp=94-95}} Religious and royal scenes were placed in public areas, where the message of kingship and religion could easily be viewed by visitors and residents of the palace.{{sfn|Burney|1977|pp=94-95}} More private rooms, like the royal apartments, were decorated with patterns, shapes, and geometric designs.{{sfn|Burney|1977|pp=94-95}} Designs in the royal apartments would have added to the luxurious accommodations befitting the royal family, while the representational frescoes would have demonstrated luxury, power, and authority.

==Archaeological finds==

===Statues===
Statues of gods and past rulers were the most common among statues unearthed at the Palace of Zimri-Lin. The title of [[Shakkanakku]] (military governor) was borne by all the princes of a dynasty who reigned at [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] in the late third millennium and early second millennium BC. These kings were the descendents of the military governors appointed by the kings of [[Akkad (city)|Akkad]].&lt;ref&gt;Louvre. "The Statuette of Iddi-Ilum," Department of Near Eastern Antiquities: Mesopotamia. Accessed December 1, 2014. http://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/statuette-iddi-ilum&lt;/ref&gt; Statues and sculpture were used to decorate the exterior and interior of the palace. Zimri-Lin used these statues to connect his kingship to the gods and to the traditions of past rulers. Most notable of these statues are the statue of Iddi-Ilum, Ishtup-Ilum, the Statue of the Water Goddess, and Puzur-Ishtar.

====Puzur-Ishtar====
[[File:Istanbul - Museo archeol. - Puzur Ishtar, governatore di Mari (fine 3o mill aC) - Foto G. Dall'Orto 28-5-2006.jpg|thumb|Istanbul - Museo archeol. - Puzur Ishtar, governatore di Mari (fine 3o mill aC) - Foto G. Dall'Orto 28-5-2006|The Statue of Puzur-Ishtar, Former Governor of Mari]]

The statue of Puzur-Ishtar once stood in one of the sanctuaries of the Palace of Zimri-Lim, but was discovered in the museum of [[Nebuchadrezzar]]’s palace at Babylon (604-562 B.C.E). The inscription on the hem of the statue’s skirt mentions Puzur-Ishtar, sakkanakku of Mari, and also mentions his brother the priest Milaga.&lt;ref&gt;Gates, Henriette-Marie. "The Palace of Zimri-Lim at Mari." ''The Biblical Archaeologist'' 47 (June.,1984): 70-87.&lt;/ref&gt; Horned caps are usually limited to divine representations in Mesopotamian art but they do not occur on depictions of kings during the Ur III period, therefore it is considered that perhaps the horns of divinity on Puzur-Ishtar’s cap qualified him (to the Babylonian soldiers) as a god to be carted home as the ultimate symbol of their victory over the people of Mari.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Gates, "The Palace of Zimri-Lim at Mari," 70-87.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ishtup-Ilum====
The Statue of Ishtup-Ilum is made of [[basalt]] and was found in room 65 of the palace. The inscription on his shoulder identifies this man as a governor (sakkanakku) of Mari during the early second millennium B.C.E. Ishtup-Ilum was known for his lavish gifts to the [[Ishtar]] temple, the temple of the popular goddess of fertility, love, war, and sex. The height of the statue is 1.52 meters. The statue is now in the Aleppo Museum.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

====Iddi-Ilum====
[[File:Idi-ilum Louvre AO 19486 n01.jpg|thumb|Idi-ilum Louvre AO 19486 n01|The Statue of Iddi-Ilum]] 
[[Statue of Iddi-Ilum|Iddi-Ilum]] was a former sakkanakku of Mari. This statue portrays Iddi-Ilum as a religious ruler, for his hands are clasped in front of him in the typical Mesopotamian pose of prayer. His luxurious robe has a tasseled border and is wound around his body, contrary to Mesopotamian tradition. The statuette bears an inscription in Akkadian: “Iddi-Ilum, shakkanakku of Mari, has dedicated his statue to [[Inanna]]. Whosoever erases this inscription will have his line wiped out by Inanna.” Connections can be made between this statuette and the statue of Puzur-Ishtar, also shakkanakku of Mari, by virtue of the trimmed beard and rich garments.&lt;ref&gt;Louvre. "Statuette of Iddi-Ilum," Department of Near Eastern Antiquities: Mesopotamia. Accessed December 1, 2014. http://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/statuette-iddi-ilum&lt;/ref&gt;

====Statue of a Water Goddess====
[[File:Deesse au vase (Mari).jpg|thumb|Statue of a Water Goddess. Was originally a fountain, with water flowing out of the vase.]]
Depictions of water bearing goddesses were a common occurrence in Mesopotamia. The statue of a Goddess holding a vase was in fact a fountain, with water flowing out of the vase. This statue is nearly life size and most likely stood in the palace chapel. A channel connected to a water supply was drilled through the body of the statue and allowed water to flow from the goddess’ vase.&lt;ref&gt;Wiess, Harvey. "From Ebla to Damascus: Art and Archaeology of Ancient Syria." ''Archaeology'' 38 (September/October 1985): 58-61.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tablets===

More than 20,000 tablets have been found in the palace.&lt;ref&gt;Robson, 2008, p.127.&lt;/ref&gt; The tablets, according to [[André Parrot]], "brought about a complete revision of the historical dating of the ancient Near East and provided more than 500 new place names, enough to redraw or even draw up the geographical map of the ancient world"&lt;ref&gt;Sasson, Jack M. (October–Dec 1998). "The King and I a Mari King in Changing Perceptions". ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' '''118''' (4): pp. 453–470. doi:10.2307/604782..&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the recovered tablets have been identified as either the remains of the royal epistolary archive of Mari, other administrative documents, and the Kings letters to his wives which were found in the women's quarters. Some letters include direct quotes from King [[Hammurabi]] leading us to believe that they were contemporaneous with his rule.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang, p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

Other letters shed light on divinity at [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] and in the [[ancient Near East]]. Letters from the epistolary archive include fascinating information about divination, gods, and even descriptions of ancient dreams. According to the tablets,  a prophetic dream was had, a letter would be sent to a diviner who would perform [[extispicy]] to confirm the revelation.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang, p.209&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frescoes===
Figural frescoes were found in five rooms within the Palace of Mari. From those recovered, only four compositions were able to be restored,&lt;ref name="Gates, Marie-Henriette 1984 pp. 70-87"&gt;Gates, Marie-Henriette . “The Palace of Zimri-Lim at Mari.” The Biblical Archaeologist, Vol. 47, No. 2 (Jun., 1984), pp. 70-87.&lt;/ref&gt; due to the deterioration of the materials and damage done by [[Hammurabi]] of Babylon's sacking of Mari circa 2760 BCE. the date here is a misprint for ca. 1760 bce. (middle chronology) &lt;ref&gt;J. R. Krupper, "Mari," in Reallexikon der Assyriologie, vol. 7, p. 389. Hammurapi probably occupied Mari in the 32nd year of his reign&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="louvre.fr"&gt;Louvre. “Mural Painting, Department of Near Eastern Antiquities: Mesopostamia.” Accessed November 28th, 2014.  http://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/mural-painting&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Investiture of Zimri-Lim====
[[File:Investiture of Zimri-Lim Louvre AO19826 n01.jpg|thumbnail|The Investiture of Zimri-lim]]
"[[Investiture of Zimri-Lim|The Investiture of Zimri-Lim]]," dating to the 18th century BCE and discovered during 1935–1936 excavations at Mari by French archaeologist [[André Parrot]], was the only painting found [[in situ]] in the palace. The painting is distinguished in part by its wide range of color, including green and blue. Painted on a thin layer of mud plaster applied directly to the palace's brick wall, the scene features a warrior goddess, likely [[Ishtar]], giving [[Zimri-Lim]] a ring and a staff, the symbols of kingship. The continuation of the red and blue painted border of the panel suggests that it was one of several adorning the walls of the room.&lt;ref name="Gates, Marie-Henriette 1984 pp. 70-87"/&gt;

Recent restoration efforts by the [[Louvre]] have revealed previously unseen details, such as scalloping on Zimri-Lim's robe, and unexpectedly vibrant colors, such as a brilliantly orange bull.&lt;ref name="louvre.fr"/&gt;

====Sacrifical procession scene====

Fragments of a sacrificial procession scene were found at the base of the eastern half of the same wall on which "The Investiture of Zimri-Lim" was recovered. The painting has multiple registers and depicts a life-size figure leading men who are in turn leading a procession of sacrificial animals. The colors utilized are black, brown, red, white, and gray.&lt;ref name="Gates, Marie-Henriette 1984 pp. 70-87"/&gt;

The application technique of this scene differs from the thin mud plaster used as a base for other frescoes in the palace. The sacrificial procession scene utilized layered mud, which was scored to aid attachment to a top layer of thick [[gypsum]] plaster. The presence of both frescoes in the same room and the better preservation of the "Investiture" scene could mean that "Investiture" was an earlier painting, and that the concealing of this fresco by the later procession scene is what saved it from suffering the same degree of damage as the palace's other frescoes.&lt;ref name="Gates, Marie-Henriette 1984 pp. 70-87"/&gt;

===="Audience chamber" frescoes====

A number of wall-painting fragments were also discovered in from the south-western end of narrow room that Parrot dubbed the "king's audience chamber." These fragments were restored to a size of 2.8 meters (nearly ten feet) in height and 3.35 meters (nearly eleven feet) in width.&lt;ref name="Gates, Marie-Henriette 1984 pp. 70-87"/&gt;

The paintings include two major registers, each depicting a scene in which offerings are made to deities. The scenes are framed by mythological creatures and bordered top and bottom by striding men carrying bundles on their backs. The figures are outlined with thick black line, with red, gray, brown, yellow, and white pigments utilized throughout the painting.&lt;ref name="Gates, Marie-Henriette 1984 pp. 70-87"/&gt;

====Other fragmentary images====

Painting fragments found in the same room as the "Investiture of Zimri-Lim" and the sacrificial procession scene include goats in heraldic pose flanking a tree, a life-size figure with a dagger in his belt, a figure in front of an architectural background, and a hand grasping hair in a manner very similar to the traditional [[Art of ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] scene of a [[Narmer Palette#Smiting side|king smiting an enemy with a mace]].&lt;ref name="Gates, Marie-Henriette 1984 pp. 70-87"/&gt;

Others rooms yielded very fragmentary wall paintings, which may have fallen and broken partly as a result of the collapse of an upper story. The fragments fall into two general stylistic groups: figures resembling the bundle-bearing men in the "audience chamber" frescoes, and life-size figures bearing similarity to the sacrificial procession scene.&lt;ref name="Gates, Marie-Henriette 1984 pp. 70-87"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4448">The '''''Safvat as-safa''''' ({{lang-fa|صفوة الصفا}}), also spelled '''''Safvat al-safa''''' or '''''Safwat al-safa''''', is a [[hagiography]] of the [[Sufi]] [[sheikh|shaykh]] [[Safi-ad-din Ardabili]] (1252–1334), founder of the [[Safaviya (sufi order)|Safaviya]] Sufi order.

== Author ==
The ''Safvat as-safa'' was written by Ebn Bazzaz ({{lang-fa|ابن بزّاز}}) (d. 1391-2), a disciple of Safi ad-Din's son and successor, [[Sadr al-Dīn Mūsā]], who prompted him to write the work.  He probably completed it in 1358.  Little else is known of his life.&lt;ref&gt;B. Nikitine, "Essai d'analyse du Safvat-us-safa," ''Journal Asiatique'' 245 (1957), 385&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. Glassen, "Ibn al-Bazzaz al-Ardabili," ''Encyclopaedia of Islam'', 2nd ed.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IErSavory"/&gt;

== Content ==
The work is divided into an introduction, 12 chapters (باب), and a conclusion.  Only two of the chapters (chapters 2 and 11) deal with the circumstances of his life.  Most of the rest of the book recounts numerous episodes of the shaykh performing miraculous feats.  The work also includes Shaykh Safi's commentaries on various passages of the Qur'an and hadith.  The contents may be summarized as follows:

*'''Introduction''': Prophecies by the Prophet [[Muhammad]] and various holy men foretelling the coming of Sheikh Safi.
*'''Chapter 1''': Safi ad-Din's genealogy, childhood, discipleship under [[Sheikh Zahed Gilani]], and succession to leadership of the order.
*'''Chapter 2''': Miracles in which Shaykh Safi saved people from perilous situations in the sea, the mountains, or from enemies or illness.
*'''Chapter 3''': Miracles motivated either by Shaykh Safi's grace or displeasure.
*'''Chapter 4''': Safi ad-Din's explanations of difficult passages or apparent contradictions in the Qur'an and hadith.
*'''Chapter 5''': Miracles of Safi ad-Din involving [[jinn]], animals, and non-living things.
*'''Chapter 6''': Safi ad-Din's practice of [[dhikr]].
*'''Chapter 7''': Various miracles performed by Safi ad-Din, such as reading minds, predicting the future, and contact with the dead.
*'''Chapter 8''': Safi ad-Din's virtues and pious acts.
*'''Chapter 9''': Safi ad-Din's final illness and death.
*'''Chapter 10''': Miracles Safi ad-Din performed after he died.
*'''Chapter 11''': The shaykh's greatness and fame throughout the world.
*'''Chapter 12''': Miracles performed by Safi ad-Din's disciples.

== Safavid-era revisions ==
Shaykh Safi ad-Din was a Sunni and an adherent of the Shafi`i school of law.&lt;ref&gt;Zeki Velidi Togan, "Sur l'origine des Safavides," in ''Mélanges Louis Massignon'' 3 (Damascus: Institut Français de Damas, 1957), 353&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1501 the Sufi order he founded became the ruling family in the [[Safavid empire]], but they converted to Shi`ism while at the same time continuing their role as head of the order.  Certain elements in the ''Safvat as-safa'', particularly Shaykh Safi's genealogy and his religious views, became inconsistent with the Safavid dynasty's self-image.  Therefore, in 1542, Shah [[Tahmasp I|Tahmasb]] commissioned Mir Abu al-Fat'h Husayni to revise the ''Safvat as-safa'' to give it an explicit Shi`i tone.  This official version contains textual changes designed to obscure the Kurdish origins of the Safavid family and to vindicate their claim to descent from the Imams.&lt;ref name="IErSavory"&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ebn-bazzaz Roger Savory, "EBN BAZZĀZ" in Encyclopædia Iranica]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Editions ==
There have been two published editions of the ''Safvat as-Safa''.  The first was a [[lithograph]]ed edition prepared by Mirza Ahmad ibn Hajj Karim Tabrizi and published in [[Bombay]] in 1911.  This has traditionally been the standard edition used by scholars, who call it the Bombay lithograph.  The second published edition appeared in 1994 in [[Tehran]], edited by Ghulam Reza Tabataba'i Majd.  Since Majd based his edition on a larger set of manuscripts of better quality,&lt;ref&gt;Michel M. Mazzaoui, "A 'New' Edition of the ''Safvat al-safa''," in ''History and Historiography of Post-Mongol Central Asia and the Middle East: Studies in Honor of John E. Woods'', ed. Judith Pfeiffer, Sholeh Quinn, and Ernest Tucker. Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 306&lt;/ref&gt; it may become the new scholarly standard.

'''''Sentimental Ballad''''' is a 1940 painting by the American artist [[Grant Wood]]. It depicts a group of singing men in a bar.

The painting is located at the [[New Britain Museum of American Art]] in [[New Britain, Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://arthistoryreference.com/cgi-bin/hd.exe?art2=a10870|title=Grant Wood. Sentimental Ballad|work=ArtHistortReference|accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==
The painting came to be because of Wood's art dealer [[Associated American Artists]] and the film producer [[Walter Wanger]], who commissioned nine popular artists to paint a motif from the upcoming film ''[[The Long Voyage Home]]'', directed by [[John Ford]]. The other artists who participated were [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Benton]], [[George Biddle]], [[James Ormsbee Chapin|James Chapin]], [[Ernest Fiene]], [[Robert Philipp]], Luis Quintanilla Isasi, [[Raphael Soyer]] and Georges Schreiber. The artists visited the set of the film for several weeks in May 1940. Wood's scene is toward the end of the film and features, from left to right, the actors [[John Qualen]], [[John Wayne]], [[Barry Fitzgerald]], [[Thomas Mitchell (actor)|Thomas Mitchell]], [[Joe Sawyer]], David Hughes and [[Jack Pennick]].&lt;ref name="nbmaa"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nbmaa.org/original-site-assets/timeline_highlights/essays/wood.html|title=''Sentimental Ballad'', 1940|publisher=[[New Britain Museum of American Art]]|accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Although originally commissioned for the marketing of a film, the painting was well received in the press and went on to tour American museums.&lt;ref name="nbmaa" /&gt;

design (scientific illustration) in 1979 and his [[Master of Arts]] degree in natural history illustration in July 1982.{{#tag:ref|[http://www.zoosprint.org/ZooPrintMagazine/2005/July/26.pdf Zoos' Print Journal Magazine Volume 20 (July 2005): ''Scientific illustrations of South Asia's 45 species and subspecies of primates'' p 26]|group=Note}}  Nash initially planned a profession as medical illustrator but changed his career path after he had seen the [[Callitrichidae|Callitrichid]] monkeys for the first time at [[London Zoo]]. Since 1982 he worked for Dr. [[Russell Mittermeier]], chairman of the IUCN/SSC Primate Specialist Group and president of [[Conservation International]], and for Dr. [[Anthony Rylands]], deputy chairman of the IUCN/SSC Primate Specialist Group. After the founding of Conservation International in 1987, Nash became its scientific illustrator in 1989. In 1990 he married Luci Betti who also works as an illustrator. Nash provided illustrations for numerous books, scientific articles, and conservation education materials, including ''Monkeyshines on the Primates: A Study of Primatology'' (1994), ''Lemurs of Madagascar'' (1994), ''Primates of West Africa: Pocket Identification Guide'' (2010) and the primates volume of the ''[[Handbook of the Mammals of the World]]'' (2013).

'''''The Rabbit''''' is an 1881 [[oil painting]] by the [[France|French]] artist [[Édouard Manet]], now displayed at the [[National Museum Wales]] in [[Cardiff]], [[Wales]]. The work is a still life featuring a hung rabbit or hare (the work is sometimes referred as '''''The Hare''''') which has been placed on a hook outside a closed house window. 

==Origin==
''The Rabbit'' was conceived as one of four decorative panels, and was painted not long after Manet had suggested a series of panels for the meeting chamber at the [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville]] in Paris, though nothing came of this concept. Completed in 1881, when Manet's health was in decline, ''The Rabbit'' was painted while the artist was spending the summer months at a villa in [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]]. The painting, which was one of the central pairings of a four panel set, was part of a new cycle of decorative work undertaken by Manet while at Versailles. The other central panel, along with ''The Rabbit'' conceived to representing hunting trophies, was ''[[Dead Eagle Owl|The Eagle Owl]]'' which as of 2012 is part of the [[Foundation E.G. Bührle|Buhrle Collection]] in Zurich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buehrle.ch/works_detail.php?lang=en&amp;id_pic=36 |title=The Eagle Owl, 1881|publisher=buehrle.ch|accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outer panels illustrate, on one a vine on a trellis and the other a corner of a garden. Two other pictures were grouped as part of the same inventory from his studio at the time of Manet's death, a vase of flowers and a watering can; but although they may be related to the same cycle of work are not believed to be part of the set of panels related to ''The Rabbit''.&lt;ref name="Sumner"&gt;{{cite book|title=Colour and Light: Fifty Impressionist and Post-Impressionist Works at the National Museum of Wales|first=Ann|last=Sumner|year=2005|publisher=National Museum of Wales|page=80|location=Cardiff|isbn=0-7200-0551-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The work was initially submitted to the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] in Paris in 1882, but was not accepted. It was sold after Manet's death as part of a studio sale to the art dealer [[Paul Durand-Ruel]]. It later passed into the ownership of the Paris-based art firm, [[Bernheim-Jeune]]. In 1917 ''The Rabbit'' was purchased from Bernheim-Jeune by the Welsh philanthrapist [[Gwendoline Davies]], who in 1918 exhibited it at the [[Victoria Art Gallery]] in Bath. On Gwendoline's death in 1951, she bequeathed her collection of Impressionist works to the National Museum of Wales, among them ''The Rabbit''.&lt;ref name="Sumner"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/rhagor/industry-to-impressionism/|title=From Industry to Impressionism - what two sisters did for Wales|publisher=museumwales.ac.uk|date=1 January 2009|accessdate=9 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011163636/http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/rhagor/industry-to-impressionism/|archivedate=11 October 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012 it is on view at the [[National Museum Cardiff]] in gallery 11.&lt;ref name="Rabbit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/art/online/?action=show_item&amp;item=1275 |title=The Rabbit|publisher=museumwales.ac.uk|accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
''The Rabbit'' is painted in a bold and loose style, and is intended to be viewed from a distance. This is in stark contrast to an earlier work by Manet also entitled the ''[[Rabbit (Manet 1866)|Rabbit]]'' (1866), which is completed in a far more traditional French style of still-life painting. This earlier painting, which is in the style of [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin|Chardin]], is far more conventional and detailed than the later painting. The 1881 picture is a far more casual work, with fast and broad brushstrokes suggesting various textures, not only in the fur of the dead animal, but also in the curtains behind the window and the climbing plant which both frame the hanging rabbit.&lt;ref name="Sumner"/&gt; This latter work is much closer to the Impressionist style.&lt;ref name="Rabbit"/&gt;

The club, modelled on the [[Three Arts Club of New York]], was founded in 1912. In 1914 the club commissioned their own building, designed by architects [[Holabird &amp; Roche]].&lt;ref name="Bruegmann1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Bruegmann|title=The Architects and the City: Holabird &amp; Roche of Chicago, 1880-1918|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GldLlt4qzJ8C&amp;pg=PA431|accessdate=10 October 2012|year=1997|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-07695-9|pages=431–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This building provided a residential space continuously until 2004, when the last of the residents moved out.

'''''La Vérité sortant du puits armée de son martinet pour châtier l'humanité''''' (English: '''''Truth coming from the well armed with her whip to chastise mankind''''') is an 1896 painting by the French artist [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]].

==Overview==
In 1895, Gérôme had painted a similar work, ''Mendacibus et histrionibus occisa in puteo jacet alma Veritas'' (English: ''The nurturer Truth lies in a well, having been killed by liars and actors'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Academy|date=11 May 1895|publisher=J. Murray|pages=409|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8F08AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA409|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that both paintings (like a similar, later work by [[Édouard Debat-Ponsan]]) were a comment on the [[Dreyfus affair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pouillon|first1=François|title=Dictionnaire des orientalistes de langue française|date=2012|publisher=KARTHALA Editions|isbn=9782811107901|page=466|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UVPhEUNg7CcC&amp;pg=PA466|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brauer|first1=Fae|title=Rivals and Conspirators: The Paris Salons and the Modern Art Centre|date=2013|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|location=Newcastle upon Tyne|isbn=9781443863704|pages=205-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jWBJDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA205|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that the painting is an expression of Gérôme's hostility towards the [[Impressionist]] movement, to which he was violently opposed.&lt;ref name="mab" /&gt; However, in a preface that Gérôme wrote for [[Émile Bayard]]'s ''Le Nu Esthétique'', he refers to the influence photography had had upon painting:
{{Verse translation|lang=fr
|
La photographie est un art. La photographie force les artistes à se dépouiller de la vieille routine et à oublier les vieilles formules. Elle nous a ouvert les yeux et forcé à regarder ce qu'auparavant nous n'avions jamais vu, service considérable et inappréciable qu'elle a rendu à l'Art. C'est grâce à elle que la vérité est enfin sortie de son puits. Elle n'y rentrera plus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bibliothèque nationale (France)|title=Autour de Turandot|date=1997|publisher=Bibliothèque nationale de France|pages=33|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OW5TAAAAMAAJ|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|
Photography is an art. It forces artists to discard their old routine and forget their old formulas. It has opened our eyes and forced us to see that which previously we have not seen; a great and inexpressible service for Art. It is thanks to photography that Truth has finally come out of her well. She will never go back.}}

The expression refers to a widespread translation of an aphorism of the philosopher [[Democritus]], "Of truth we know nothing, for truth is in a well [lit. in an abyss]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Diogenes Laertius|title=Lives of Eminent Philosophers|publisher= IX, 72. Perseus Project, Tufts University|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:abo:tlg,0004,001:9:11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nudity of the model refers to the expression 'the naked truth'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Noël|first1=Benoît|last2=Hournon|first2=Jean|title=Parisiana: la capitale des peintres au XIXème siècle|date=2006|publisher=DISLAB|location=Paris|isbn=9782952721400|pages=147|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j63bUC2bjnoC&amp;pg=PA147|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to his biographer [[Charles Moreau-Vauthier]], Gérôme slept with the painting above his bed and was found after his death with his arm stretched out towards it in a gesture of farewell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moreau-Vauthier|first1=Charles|last2=Gérôme|first2=Jean Léon|title=Gérôme: peintre et sculpteur|date=1906|publisher=Hachette|page=6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YTlGAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA6|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''unguentarium''' (plural "unguentaria")&lt;ref&gt;[[Grammatical gender|Neuter]] [[noun]] from the [[Latin]] ''unguentarius'', "concerned with the production, sale, etc., of [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Unguenta.html ointments]," ''[[Oxford Latin Dictionary]]'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press 1982, 1985 printing), p. 2092. The noun is a modern coinage as it applies to these vessels: see Susan I. Rotroff, "Hellenistic Pottery: Athenian and Imported Wheelmade Table Ware and Related Material," part 1: text, ''The Athenian Agora'' 29 (1997), pp. 175–176, note 28, for references on possible ancient terminology. In antiquity, the [[adjective]] ''unguentarius'' and its [[Noun#Substantive as a word for "noun"|substantives]] referred to the perfume trade.&lt;/ref&gt; is a small [[Ceramic art|ceramic]] or [[Roman glass|glass]] bottle found frequently by [[archaeology|archaeologists]] at [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] and [[ancient Rome|Roman]] sites, especially in cemeteries.&lt;ref&gt;Virginia R. Anderson-Stojanovic, "The Chronology and Function of Ceramic Unguentaria," ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 91 (1987), p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Its most common use was probably as a container for oil, though it is also suited for storing and dispensing liquid and powdered substances. Some finds date into the early Christian era.&lt;ref&gt;For examples, James Whitley, "Archaeology in Greece 2003–2004," ''Archaeological Reports'' 50 (2003–2004), p. 66, with example dating from the 5th–7th century.&lt;/ref&gt; From the 2nd to the 6th century they are more often made of [[Glassblowing#History|blown glass]] rather than [[clay]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry S. Robinson, "Pottery of the Roman Period: Chronology," in ''The Athenian Agora'', vol. 5 (American School of Classical Studies at Athens, 1959), pp. 15 and 118.&lt;/ref&gt; A few examples are [[silver]] or [[alabaster]].&lt;ref&gt;Virginia R. Anderson-Stojanovic, "The Chronology and Function of Ceramic Unguentaria," ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 91 (1987), p. 111, note 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unguentaria were used as product packaging in commerce and for funerary practice. They are distributed throughout the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] region of the [[Roman Empire]] from [[Israel]] to [[Hispania|Spain]], and north into [[Roman Britain|Britain]] and [[Germania]]. Their manufacture was nearly as widespread.&lt;ref&gt;Virginia R. Anderson-Stojanovic, "The Chronology and Function of Ceramic Unguentaria," ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 91 (1987), p. 105; E. Marianne Stern, "Glass Is Hot," ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 106 (2002), p. 464.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forms and function==
The term ''unguentarium'' is functional rather than descriptive; that is, it refers to the purpose for which this relatively small vessel is thought to have been used and is not [[Typology of Greek Vase Shapes|typological by shape]].&lt;ref&gt;Natalia Vogelkoff-Brogan, "Late Hellenistic Pottery in Athens: A New Deposit and Further Thoughts on the Association of Pottery and Societal Change", ''Hesperia'' 69 (2000), p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt; In its early development, the shape was modeled in miniature after larger [[amphora]]s, which would have been the original bulk shipping containers for products sold in the ungentaria.&lt;ref&gt;Susan I. Rotroff, "Hellenistic Pottery: Athenian and Imported Wheelmade Table Ware and Related Material", part 1: text, ''The Athenian Agora'' 29 (1997), p. 177, and "Fusiform Unguentaria," in "Hellenistic Pottery: The Plain Wares", ''The Athenian Agora'' 33 (2006), p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; An unguentarium is not always distinguished in the scholarly literature from an [[wikt:ampulla|ampulla]],&lt;ref&gt;William Anderson, "An Archaeology of [[Late Antiquity|Late Antique]] [[Pilgrimage|Pilgrim]] Flasks," ''[[Anatolia]]n Studies'' 54 (2004), p. 82, with reference to John Hayes (1971), who categorized a wheel-made, fusiform [[wikt:ampulla|ampulla]] as a "late Roman unguentarium."&lt;/ref&gt; a term from antiquity that may refer to these as well as other small vessels. In scholarship of the modern era, an unguentarium is sometimes called a ''lacrimarium'' ("tear-container") or ''balsamarium'' ("[[wikt:balsam|balsam]]-container"). All three terms reflect modern usage based on assumptions about their use, and no single word is found in ancient sources for the vessels.&lt;ref&gt;Virginia R. Anderson-Stojanovic, "The Chronology and Function of Ceramic Unguentaria", ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 91 (1987), pp. 105–106; Susan I. Rotroff, "Hellenistic Pottery: Athenian and Imported Wheelmade Table Ware and Related Material", part 1: text, ''The Athenian Agora'' 29 (1997), pp. 175–176, note 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Small vessels of two shapes, usually but not always without handles, are referred to as unguentaria:
* '''Fusiform''' – The fusiform shape (example here&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~semitic/Cesnola/filemaker.cgi?obnum=509&amp;class=&amp;shape=&amp;cdate= here]&lt;/ref&gt;) is characteristic of Hellenistic unguentaria: a heavy [[oval|ovoid]] body resting usually on a small distinct ring foot, with a long tubular neck or cylindrical stem. The shape is comparable to a [[Spindle (textiles)|spindle]] (Latin ''fusus'', "spindle").&lt;ref&gt;Homer A. Thompson, "Two Centuries of Hellenistic Pottery," ''Hesperia'' 4 (1934), p. 472; Henry S. Robinson, "Pottery of the Roman Period: Chronology," in ''The Athenian Agora'', vol. 5 (American School of Classical Studies at Athens, 1959), p. 15; Nabil I. Khairy, "Nabataean Piriform Unguentaria," ''Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research'' 240 (1980), p. 85; Virginia R. Anderson-Stojanovic, "The Chronology and Function of Ceramic Unguentaria," ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 91 (1987), p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; These ovoid unguentaria first appear in [[Cyprus]] around the turn of the 4th and 3rd centuries BC.&lt;ref&gt;George H. McFadden, "A Tomb of the Necropolis of Ayios Ermoyenis at Kourion," ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 50 (1946), p. 474.&lt;/ref&gt; and may have been [[Ancient Near East|Near Eastern]] in origin or influence.&lt;ref&gt;Virginia R. Anderson-Stojanovic, "The Chronology and Function of Ceramic Unguentaria," ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 91 (1987), p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Early examples are similar in shape to the [[Typology of Greek Vase Shapes|amphoriskos]]. They are believed to develop functionally from the [[lekythos]], which they replace by the end of the 4th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Nabil I. Khairy, "Nabataean Piriform Unguentaria," ''Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research'' 240 (1980), p. 85; Virginia R. Anderson-Stojanovic, "The Chronology and Function of Ceramic Unguentaria," ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 91 (1987), p. 106; Susan I. Rotroff, "Fusiform Unguentaria," in "Hellenistic Pottery: The Plain Wares," ''The Athenian Agora'' 33 (2006), p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; The fusiform unguentarium was in use for several centuries and the form shows many variations, including later examples with very slender profiles.&lt;ref&gt;Virginia R. Anderson-Stojanovic, "The Chronology and Function of Ceramic Unguentaria," ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 91 (1987), p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flared unguentarium.jpg|thumb|125px|Glass unguentarium with conical base, late 1st or early 2nd century]]
* '''Piriform''' – The unguentarium with a footless body that is rounded or pear-shaped (Latin ''pirus'', "pear") began to appear in the second half of the 1st century BC and is characteristic of the Roman era, particularly the early [[Principate]].&lt;ref&gt;Nabil I. Khairy, "Nabataean Piriform Unguentaria," ''Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research'' 240 (1980), pp. 85–86; Virginia R. Anderson-Stojanovic, "The Chronology and Function of Ceramic Unguentaria," ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 91 (1987), pp. 113–114; Patricia Maynor Bikai and Megan A. Perry, "Petra North Ridge Tombs 1 and 2: Preliminary Report," ''Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research'' 324 (2001), p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; These are regularly associated with graves in the 1st century.&lt;ref&gt;Henry S. Robinson, "Pottery of the Roman Period: Chronology," in ''The Athenian Agora'', vol. 5 (American School of Classical Studies at Athens, 1959), p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; The piriform unguentarium was in use for a limited period of about a hundred years and did not replace the fusiform.&lt;ref&gt;Virginia R. Anderson-Stojanovic, "The Chronology and Function of Ceramic Unguentaria", ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 91 (1987), p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; An exception to this chronology is the squat rounded unguentarium with painted bands found on the northeast coast of Spain and in other [[Iberians|Iberian]] cemeteries, dated as early as the 5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Susan I. Rotroff, "Fusiform Unguentaria," in "Hellenistic Pottery: The Plain Wares," ''The Athenian Agora'' 33 (2006), pp. 138–139.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''bulbous'' is used rather confusingly in the scholarship to describe both forms. "Bulbous" appears as a [[synonym]] for "piriform", but is applied descriptively to the fusiform to distinguish certain examples from more slender profiles.

Thin blown-glass bottles began to appear in [[Cyprus]] after the middle of the 1st century BC.&lt;ref&gt;George H. McFadden, "A Tomb of the Necropolis of Ayios Ermoyenis at Kourion," ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 50 (1946), p. 480.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the new medium for unguentaria resulted in variations of form, including the thin, "test-tube" type. Glass unguentaria made in [[Thessaly]], for example, often have a distinctive conical body, flared like the bell of a [[trumpet]], or are squat and rounded with a very long neck; they come in a range of colors including aquamarine, pale green, and yellowish green, or may be colorless.&lt;ref&gt;Gladys Davidson Weinberg, "Evidence for Glass Manufacture in Ancient [[Thessaly]]," ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 66 (1962) 129–133.&lt;/ref&gt; This shape was popular in the 2nd and 3rd centuries and is also characteristic of [[Thrace]] and [[Cyprus]].&lt;ref&gt;Virginia R. Anderson-Stojanovic, "The Chronology and Function of Ceramic Unguentaria," ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 91 (1987), p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

Glass bird-shaped containers for [[History of cosmetics|cosmetics]] found at various Roman sites from [[Herculaneum]] to [[Hispania|Spain]] have also been called unguentaria. In these examples, dating from the period of the piriform type, the neck has become a spout, and the profile is no longer vertical. As with other unguentaria, no clear distinction can be made between the use of these vessels for grooming in daily life, and their inclusion in tombs.&lt;ref&gt;Virginia R. Anderson-Stojanovic, "The Chronology and Function of Ceramic Unguentaria", ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 91 (1987), pp. 116–117; Josefina Pérez-Arantegui, Juan Ángel Paz-Peralta, and Esperanza Ortiz-Palomar, "Analysis of the Products Contained in Two Roman Glass ''unguentaria'' from the Colony of ''Celsa'' (Spain)," ''Journal of Archaeological Science'' 23 (1996), pp. 649–650, following C. Isings, ''Roman Glass from Dated Finds'' (Groningen-Djakarta 1957), on vessel form.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial and secular use==
In her typology of Hellenistic vessels at [[History of Athens|Athens]] used to contain and pour oil, Susan I. Rotroff classes unguentaria with [[Plastic arts|plastic]] [[Askos (pottery vessel)|askoi]] as used for perfumed oil in bathing and grooming, but notes the diversity of craft tradition associated with them.&lt;ref&gt;Susan I. Rotroff, "Hellenistic Pottery: Athenian and Imported Wheelmade Table Ware and Related Material," part 1: text, ''[[Ancient Agora of Athens|The Athenian Agora]]'' 29 (1997), pp. 6, 32, and 169.&lt;/ref&gt; Most unguentaria from the [[Ancient Agora of Athens|Athenian agora]] were probably intended for secular use, as they are found in household dumps; the pattern of deposition in some wells, however, suggests [[votive deposit|votive]] offerings.&lt;ref&gt;Susan I. Rotroff, "Hellenistic Pottery: Athenian and Imported Wheelmade Table Ware and Related Material," part 1: text, ''The Athenian Agora'' 29 (1997), p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Unguentarium asymmetrical.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Roman glass unguentarium, 2nd century; asymmetry may indicate mass production]]
It has been suggested that products shipped in bulk containers were dispensed for sale in these smaller vessels.&lt;ref&gt;Susan I. Rotroff, "Hellenistic Pottery: Athenian and Imported Wheelmade Table Ware and Related Material," part 1: text, ''The Athenian Agora'' 29 (1997), p. 177; Stuart James Fleming, ''Roman Glass: Reflections on Cultural Change'' (University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology, 1999), p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Perfumed oils, ointments, [[wikt:balsam|balsam]], [[jasmine]], [[Kohl (cosmetics)|kohl]], [[honey]], [[Mastic (plant resin)|mastic]], [[incense]], scent powders&lt;ref&gt;''Diapasmata,'' mentioned by [[Pliny the Elder]], ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Historia naturalis]]'' 13.3.19.&lt;/ref&gt; and cosmetic preparations are among the contents proposed by scholars or evidenced by archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;Susan I. Rotroff, "Fusiform Unguentaria," in "Hellenistic Pottery: The Plain Wares," ''The Athenian Agora'' 33 (2006), p. 137; Virginia R.

The substances were a mixture of [[gypsum]] and [[calcite]], tinted with [[hematite]] ([[red ochre]]), in an organic binder.&lt;/ref&gt; The name "unguentarium" may be misleading, as [[solid perfume|solid unguents]], or [[ointment]]s, would be difficult to remove through the narrow neck.&lt;ref&gt;Josefina Pérez-Arantegui, Juan Ángel Paz-Peralta, and Esperanza Ortiz-Palomar, "Analysis of the Products Contained in Two Roman Glass ''unguentaria'' from the Colony of ''Celsa'' (Spain)," ''Journal of Archaeological Science'' 23 (1996), p. 650; Virginia R. Anderson-Stojanovic, "The Chronology and Function of Ceramic Unguentaria," ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 91 (1987), p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; There is little or no evidence of how the contents were prevented from spilling, as no corks, wax or clay seals, or lead stoppers have been found with unguentaria as they have with other vessels.&lt;ref&gt;Virginia R. Anderson-Stojanovic, "The Chronology and Function of Ceramic Unguentaria," ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 91 (1987), p. 114; Nicola Schreiber, ''The [[Ancient history of Cyprus|Cypro]]-[[Phoenicia]]n Pottery of the [[Iron Age]]'' (Brill, 2003), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

The manufacture of unguentaria seems to occur in conjunction with the [[marketing]] of products.&lt;ref&gt;Josefina Pérez-Arantegui, Juan Ángel Paz-Peralta, and Esperanza Ortiz-Palomar, "Analysis of the Products Contained in Two Roman Glass ''unguentaria'' from the Colony of ''Celsa'' (Spain)," ''Journal of Archaeological Science'' 23 (1996), p. 650; Susan I. Potroff, "Fusiform Unguentaria," in "Hellenistic Pottery: The Plain Wares," ''The Athenian Agora'' 33 (2006), p. 157, with cautions on the difficulty of defining industries or determining whether the vessels were intended for local products or repackaging bulk imports.&lt;/ref&gt; Roman glass unguentaria often have markings or lettering, usually on the base, that could indicate the manufacturer of the vessel or the supplier or dealer of the product inside.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart James Fleming, ''Roman Glass'' (University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology, 1999), pp. 65–66.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nabataeans|Nabataean]] piriform wheel-thrown unguentaria show creative variations by potters, perhaps to establish [[brand]] identity for the product they contained. These vessels include some of the larger unguentaria and may have been used for shipping as part of the Nabataeans' active perfume trade.&lt;ref&gt;Nabil I. Khairy, "Nabataean Piriform Unguentaria," ''Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research'' 240 (1980), p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mass production of Roman blown-glass unguentaria is indicated by their frequent [[asymmetry]], which results from speed and timing in shearing the neck from the blow-pipe. Recycled glass, as from a large, heavy broken bottle, could have been used to make many of the smaller unguentaria.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart James Fleming, ''Roman Glass'' (University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology, 1999), pp. 24 and 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funerary and religious context==
[[File:Achilles Ajax dice Louvre MNB911.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Achilles]] and [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]] play [[knucklebones]] on this late 6th-century [[lekythos]], a type of oil-storing vessel associated with funeral rites before the unguentarium replaced it]]
While unguentaria often appear among [[grave goods]], the purpose of their inclusion has not been determined with certainty or may vary by site. Unguentaria found in burials range in size from miniatures (4–5&amp;nbsp;cm.) to large examples 20 to 30&amp;nbsp;cm. high.&lt;ref&gt;Virginia R. Anderson-Stojanovic, "The Chronology and Function of Ceramic Unguentaria," ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 91 (1987), pp. 105–106.&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of the vessel in Hellenistic graves may indicate a revival of an earlier practice, attested in the 6th century by [[aryballos|aryballoi]] and in some 5th- and early 4th-century burials by small [[lekythos|lekythoi]], which involved the deposit of a small container of perfume or oil with the dead.&lt;ref&gt;E.G. Pemberton, "Ten Hellenistic Graves in Ancient Corinth," ''Hesperia'' 54 (1985), pp. 284–285.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 3rd century, the [[Black-figure pottery|black-figure]] lekythos with [[palmette]]s or [[Cult of Dionysus|Dionysiac]] scenes has been completely replaced as a standard grave good by the undecorated, "cruder" unguentarium, indicating a shift in burial practice that is characteristic of the period.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Stears, "Losing the Picture: Change and Continuity in Athenian Grave Monuments in the Fourth and Third Centuries B.C.," in ''Word and Image in Ancient Greece,'' edited by N.K. Rutter and Brian A. Sparkes (Edinburgh University Press, 2000), p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the unguentaria seem often to have been buried along with other objects associated with or treasured by the deceased or as grave gifts, they may have also have held a substance — such as oil, wine, or powdered incense — for a graveside ritual. The design of many unguentaria would not permit them to stand without support, but no stands have been found. Late Hellenistic gravestones depict unguentaria resting in a support, but they would also fit well in the palm of the hand, as shown in this Egyptian [https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_image.aspx?objectId=119929&amp;partId=1&amp;searchText=unguentarium&amp;fromADBC=ad&amp;toADBC=ad&amp;orig=%2fresearch%2fsearch_the_collection_database.aspx&amp;numPages=10&amp;currentPage=1&amp;asset_id=125373 mummy portrait].&lt;ref&gt;From [[Roman Egypt]], 2nd century A.D.; [[British Museum]], information [https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=119929&amp;partid=1&amp;searchText=unguentarium&amp;fromADBC=ad&amp;toADBC=ad&amp;numpages=10&amp;orig=%2fresearch%2fsearch_the_collection_database.aspx&amp;currentPage=1 here.]&lt;/ref&gt; Ritual dispensing, rather than long-term storage, might explain both the lack of durability needed for use in daily life and the absence of stands, stoppers or seals.&lt;ref&gt;Virginia R. Anderson-Stojanovic, "The Chronology and Function of Ceramic Unguentaria," ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 91 (1987) 114, 116, 119, 121; Nicola Schreiber, ''The Cypro-Phoenician Pottery of the Iron Age'' (Brill, 2003), p. 63; Susan I. Rotroff, "Fusiform Unguentaria," in "Hellenistic Pottery: The Plain Wares," ''The Athenian Agora'' 33 (2006), p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no standard assemblage of grave goods for which an unguentarium was required. Unguentaria often appear among articles for personal grooming; in one example, with a stone cosmetics pallet, [[strigil]]s, tweezers and a [[pyxis]],&lt;ref&gt;George H. McFadden, "A Tomb of the Necropolis of Ayios Ermoyenis at Kourion," ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 50 (1946), p. 463.&lt;/ref&gt; and in another, with a pyxis, mirror, bronze [[Scissors#History|scissors]] and tongs.&lt;ref&gt;Susan I. Rotroff, "Hellenistic Pottery: Athenian and Imported Wheelmade Table Ware and Related Material," part 1: text, ''The Athenian Agora'' 29 (1997), p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; Gravestones from [[Anatolia]] depict the deceased with a similar group of objects, including mirror, comb, [[pyxis (pottery)|boxes]] and [[cista]]i, wool basket, and unguentaria.&lt;ref&gt;Susan I. Rotroff, "Fusiform Unguentaria," in "Hellenistic Pottery: The Plain Wares," ''The Athenian Agora'' 33 (2006), p. 139; Susan Walker, ''Ancient Faces: Mummy Portraits from Roman Egypt'' (Taylor &amp; Francis, 2000) p. 123, citing numerous examples in M. Waelkens, ''Die kleinasiatische Türsteine'' (Mainz 1982).&lt;/ref&gt; One Athenian burial produced five bulbous unguentaria along with five [[knucklebones]] and a bronze needle; another, of a female child, contained an unguentarium, earrings, a blue glass pendant, and six knucklebones.&lt;ref&gt;Cedric G. Boulter, "Graves in Lenormant Street, Athens," ''Hesperia'' 32 (1963), pp. 127–128. [[Knucklebones]], widely used for [[divination]], are common in burials; see, for instance, Jenifer Neils, "The Morgantina Phormiskos," ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 96 (1992) 225–235. As playthings of the Child [[Zagreus]], knucklebones are among the sacred objects in [[cult of Dionysus|Dionysiac religion]], which may also account for their inclusion; on these toys, see [[Clement of Alexandria]], ''[[Protrepticus (Clement)|Protrepticus]]'' 2.17.2, and W.K.C. Guthrie, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=-C6wNyrxUO8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=intitle:orpheus+intitle:and+intitle:Greek+intitle:Religion+inauthor:guthrie&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;sig=ACfU3U2RFT3DjQZr0_A0indp_cF4oA-vyg Orpheus and Greek Religion]: A Study of the Orphic Movement'' (New York: Norton, 1966, revised edition), pp. 120–126.&lt;/ref&gt; Gold leaves and unguentaria were the grave gifts in a burial chamber at [[Kourion]] in [[Cyprus]].&lt;ref&gt;George H. McFadden, "A Tomb of the Necropolis of Ayios Ermoyenis at Kourion," ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 50 (1946), p. 465.&lt;/ref&gt;

At Amisos (modern [[Samsun]]) in the [[Black Sea]] region of [[Turkey]], the grave goods in the early Hellenistic tomb of a wealthy family were exceptionally rich and of outstanding workmanship, but the unguentaria were plain and made of clay. One of the bodies was adorned with gold earrings in the shape of [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]], ten gold appliqués of [[Thetis]] riding a [[hippocamp]], snake bracelets and bracelets with lion-head terminals, and other gold items; on the right side of the skull was placed a single clay unguentarium.&lt;ref&gt;Deniz Burcu Erciyas, ''Wealth, Aristocracy and Royal Propaganda under the Hellenistic Kingdom of the [[Mithradatids]]'' (Brill, 2005) pp. 67–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some graves contain multiple unguentaria, in one case numbering 31 of the fusiform type, while others hold a single example.&lt;ref&gt;Cedric G. Boulter, "Graves in Lenormant Street, Athens," ''Hesperia'' 32 (1963), pp. 125–128.&lt;/ref&gt; Grave gifts sometimes consisted of nothing but unguentaria.&lt;ref&gt;Susan I. Rotroff, "Hellenistic Pottery: Athenian and Imported Wheelmade Table Ware and Related Material," part 1: text, ''The Athenian Agora'' 29 (1997), p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; Neither the piriform unguentaria nor thin blown-glass vessels occur in burials before the [[Augustus|Augustan]] period.&lt;ref&gt;George H. McFadden, "A Tomb of the Necropolis of Ayios Ermoyenis at Kourion," ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 50 (1946), p. 480&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Mainz]], unguentaria are the most common grave gifts made of glass during the first half of the 1st century; in [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]] and [[Roman Britain|Britain]], glass unguentaria appear as containers for scented oils in both cremations and inhumations in this period and continuing into the 3rd century, but disappear by the 4th.&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy Watts, ''Religion in Late Roman Britain: Forces of Change'' (London: Routledge, 1998), p. 125, on the unguentaria as evidence of how quickly Roman burial customs were adopted in [[Britannia]]; E. Marianne Stern, "Glass Is Hot," ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 106 (2002), pp. 464–465 on [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Rock-cut tombs at [[Labraunda]], investigated in 2005, contained unguentaria.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

The grave goods of [[Judaism|Jewish]] [[ossuary|ossuaries]] at [[Jericho]] in the [[Second Temple]] period often include unguentaria along with bowls, lamps, and various vessels ordinarily encountered in daily life.&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Hachlili, ''Ancient Jewish Art and Archaeology in the Land of Israel'' (Brill Archive, 1988), p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unguentaria have also been found in Athens in ritual [[pyre]]s along with the burnt bones of [[animal sacrifice]] and smashed pottery.&lt;ref&gt;Susan I. Rotroff, "Hellenistic Pottery: Athenian and Imported Wheelmade Table Ware and Related Material," part 1: text, ''The Athenian Agora'' 29 (1997), p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; A single unguentarium was buried with a dog, possibly a pet, in an industrial district in Athens.&lt;ref&gt;Susan I. Rotroff, "Fusiform Unguentaria," in "Hellenistic Pottery: The Plain Wares," ''The Athenian Agora'' 33 (2006), p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

The many unguentaria at the [[Latium|Latin]] town of [[Ariccia|Aricia]] reflect the growth of commerce to support ritual activities at the famous sanctuary of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] there.&lt;ref&gt;Carin M.C. Green, ''Roman Religion and the Cult of Diana at Aricia'' (Cambridge University Press, 2007) pp. 39 and 294–295, where the term "unguentarium" is used as it was in antiquity for a shop that sells fragrances or [[Materia medica|medicaments]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Most ceramic unguentaria either lack surface decoration or have simple horizontal lines around the neck or body consisting most often of three narrow bands of white paint.&lt;ref&gt;Homer A. Thompson, "Two Centuries of Hellenistic Pottery," ''Hesperia'' 4 (1934), p. 472; Önder Bilgi, "Ikiztepe in the Late Iron Age," ''Anatolian Studies'' 49 (1999), p. 38; Natalia Vogelkoff-Brogan, "Late Hellenistic Pottery in Athens: A New Deposit and Further Thoughts on the Association of Pottery and Societal Change," ''Hesperia'' 69 (2000), p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Unguentario punico.jpg|thumb|[[Punic]] unguentarium found in the [[Phoenicia]]n necropolis of Puig des Molins]]
Glass unguentaria vary widely in quality and show a range of colors. The [[Judean]] desert caves, for instance, yielded unguentaria of aquamarine glass with large bubbles.&lt;ref&gt;Gladys Davidson Weinberg and Dan Barag, "Glass Vessels," in "Discoveries in the Wâdi ed-Dâliyeh," ''Annual of the American Schools of Oriental Research'' 41 (1974), pp. 103–104.&lt;/ref&gt; A striking example of a glass fusiform unguentarium from 1st-century [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]], a little over six inches tall, has a white spiral curling around the cerulean body. The base comes to an elongated, rounded point, and the lip is well-formed and prominent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=I. Olszewski|first1=Deborah|editor1-last=Quick|editor1-first=Jennifer|title=Magnificent Objects from the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology|date=2004|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]]|location=Pa|isbn=1-931707-64-2|url=https://books.google.com/?id=iRtJ8ONWG-4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=editions:ISBN#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Techniques of "[[Marble|marbling]]," intended to emulate fashionably extravagant vessels made of [[sardonyx]] during the reigns of [[Augustus]] and [[Tiberius]], were used for unguentaria as well as bowls.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart James Fleming, ''Roman Glass: Reflections on Cultural Change'' (University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology, 1999), pp. 22–23, with illustrations of the technique.&lt;/ref&gt;

An exceptionally elaborate unguentarium was found in a [[cremation]] burial at [[Stobi]] in [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]. Made of milky glass, the vessel has a globular body decorated with an [[egg-and-dart]] [[motif (visual arts)|motif]] around the top and [[festoon]]s and vine clusters around the bottom. The middle had six panels illustrating various vessels, with two examples each of the [[hydria]], [[oenochoe]] and [[krater|crater]].&lt;ref&gt;James Wiseman and Djordje Mano-Zissi, "Excavations at [[Stobi]], 1970," ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 75 (1971), p. 405.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literature==
[[File:Mosca Antonius und Kleopatra.jpg|thumb|Antony and Cleopatra, 16th century marble relief by Giovanni Maria Mosca]]
The use of the term "lacrimarium" or "lacrimatorium" (also "[[lacrymatory]]" or "lachrymatory") for unguentaria persisted because the small vessels were believed to have been used to collect the tears (''lacrimae'') of mourners to accompany the beloved in the grave. This belief was supported by a scriptural reference ({{bibleverse||Psalm|56.8}}) translated in the [[Authorized King James Version|King James Bible]] as "put thou my tears into thy bottle."&lt;ref&gt;"You have stored my tears in your bottle," [[Contemporary English Version]], but "list my tears on your scroll" or alternatively "put my tears in your wineskin" in the [[New International Version]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shakespeare]] refers to the practice in ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]],'' when Cleopatra chides the Roman for shedding few tears over the death of his wife: "Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill / With sorrowful water?"&lt;ref&gt;[[William Shakespeare]], ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'' I.iii.6; ''The Riverside Shakespeare'' (Boston 1974), p. 1351, note 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

The minor [[Victorian literature|Victorian]] poet [[Charles Tennyson Turner]], brother of the more famous [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Tennyson]], wrote a [[sonnet]] called [http://www.bartleby.com/246/364.html "The Lachrymatory,"] elaborating the idea of "the phial of his kinsman’s tears." Since the early 20th century, the use of a vessel to collect tears of grief has been regarded as more poetic than plausible.&lt;ref&gt;Homer A. Thompson, "Two Centuries of Hellenistic Pottery." ''Hesperia'' 4 (1934), p. 473; Virginia R. Anderson-Stojanovic, "The Chronology and Function of Ceramic Unguentaria," ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 91 (1987), p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1896, The Atlantic Monthly published a poem by Frank Dempster Sherman (1860-1916) called "[http://www.lachrymatory.com/victorian.htm A Tear Bottle.]" which reference Greek Girl Tears, alluding to the role that the tear bottle played during Greek times&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Clarence Stedman, ed. (1833–1908).  An American Anthology, 1787–1900&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Volta Laboratory''' (also known as the "Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory", the "Bell Carriage House" and the "Bell Laboratory") and the '''Volta Bureau''' were created in [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.]] by [[Alexander Graham Bell]].&lt;ref name="NPS" /&gt;

The Volta Laboratory was founded in 1880–1881 with [[Charles Sumner Tainter]] and Bell's cousin, [[Chichester Bell]],&lt;ref name="Schoenherr2005" /&gt; for the [[research and development]] of [[telecommunication]], [[phonograph]] and other technologies.

Using funds generated by the Volta Laboratory, Bell later founded the Volta Bureau in 1887 "for the increase and diffusion of knowledge relating to the [[deafness|deaf]]", and merged with the American Association for the Promotion and Teaching of Speech to the Deaf (AAPTSD) in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;

== History ==

The current building, a U.S. [[National Historic Landmark]], was constructed in 1893 under the direction of Alexander Graham Bell to serve as a center of information for deaf and hard of hearing persons. Bell, best known for receiving the first [[Invention of the telephone|telephone patent]] in 1876, was also a prominent figure of his generation in the [[Second International Congress on Education of the Deaf|education of the deaf]]. His grandfather, father and elder brother were teachers of speech and the younger Bell worked with them.

Born in [[Edinburgh, Scotland]], Bell moved to [[Canada]] with his family in 1870 following the deaths of his brothers, and a year later moved to Boston to teach at a special day school for deaf children.&lt;ref name="NPS" /&gt; Both Bell's mother and wife were deaf, profoundly influencing his life's work. He became a renowned educator by opening a private normal class to train teachers of speech to the deaf and as a professor of [[Human voice|vocal physiology]] and the mechanics of [[speech]] at [[Boston University]]. During this time he also invented an improved [[phonautograph]], the [[Acoustic telegraphy|multiple telegraph]], the speaking telegraph, or [[telephone]], and numerous other devices.&lt;ref name="NPS"&gt;[[National Park Service]].

National Register of Historic Places: Volta Laboratory &amp; Bureau], National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior, Washington. Retrieved from NPS.gov website December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1879, Bell and his wife [[Mabel Hubbard]], who had been deaf from early childhood, moved to Washington, D.C. The following year, the [[France|French government]] awarded Bell the [[Volta Prize]] of 50,000 francs (approximately US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|10000|1879|r=-4}}}} in current dollars{{Inflation-fn|US}}) for the [[invention of the telephone]].&lt;ref name="NPS" /&gt; Bell used the money to establish a trust fund, the Volta Fund, and founded the Volta Laboratory Association, along with his cousin [[Chichester Bell|Chichester A. Bell]] and [[Charles Sumner Tainter|Sumner Tainter]].&lt;ref name="NPS" /&gt; The laboratory focused on research for the analysis, recording and transmission of sound. In 1887, the Volta Laboratory Association transferred the sound recording and phonograph [[invention]] [[patent]]s they had been granted to the American Graphophone Company (later to evolve into [[Columbia Records]]). Alexander Bell, bent on improving the lives of the deaf, took a portion of his share of the profits to found the Volta Bureau as an instrument "''for the increase and diffusion of knowledge relating to the deaf''".&lt;ref name="NPS" /&gt;

The Volta Bureau worked in close cooperation with the American Association for the Promotion of the Teaching of Speech to the Deaf (the AAPTSD) which was organized in 1890, electing Bell as President.&lt;ref name="NPS" /&gt; The Volta Bureau officially merged with the Association in 1908, and has been known as the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf since 1956, and then as the [[Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing]] since 1999.  Informally it is also called the 'AG Bell'.&lt;ref name="NPS" /&gt;

=== Transition from the Volta Laboratory to the Volta Bureau ===

[[File:Volta Laboratory and Bureau nw22.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Alternatetext:An oblique view of a large salmon coloured two story neoclassical style stone building, of some prominence.|Bell's 1893 Volta Bureau building]]

From about 1879 Bell's earliest physics research in Washington. D.C. was conducted at his first [[laboratory]], a rented house, at 1325 L Street NW,&lt;ref name="Bruce"&gt;

Bruce 1990, p. 336

&lt;/ref&gt; and then from the autumn of 1880 at 1221 Connecticut Avenue NW. The laboratory was later relocated to 2020 F Street NW sometime after January 1886.&lt;ref name="Schoenherr2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ERS" /&gt; With most of the laboratory's project work being conducted by his two associates, Bell was able to engage in extensive research into the causes of deafness as well as ways of improving the lives of the deaf, leading him to create the ''Volta Bureau'' in 1887. In 1889, Bell and his family moved from their Brodhead-Bell mansion to a new home close to his father, [[Alexander Melville Bell]]. Between 1889 and 1893, the Volta Bureau was located in the [[carriage house]] to the rear of the home of Bell's father, at 1527 35th Street NW in Washington, D.C. The work of the Bureau increased to such an extent that in 1893 Bell, with the assistance of his father, constructed a [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] yellow brick and sandstone building specifically to house the institution.&lt;ref name="NPS" /&gt;

The new bureau building was constructed across the street from his father's home, where its carriage house had been its original headquarters.&lt;ref name="NPS" /&gt; On May 8, 1893, Bell's 13-year-old prodigy, [[Helen Keller]], performed the sod-breaking ceremony for the construction of the new Volta Bureau building.&lt;ref name="Schoenherr2005"&gt;Schoenherr, Steven.

The 'Volta Bureau' was so named in 1887 at the suggestion of John Hitz, its first superintendent, and Bell's prior [[researcher]]. Hitz remained its first superintendent until his death in 1908.&lt;ref name="Bruce 1990, pp. 412–413"&gt;

Bruce&amp;nbsp;1990, pp.&amp;nbsp;412–413

&lt;/ref&gt; Bell's former trust, the Volta Fund, was also renamed the Volta Bureau Fund when the Bureau was established, except for US$25,000 that Bell diverted to the [[Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf|AAPTSD]],&lt;ref name="Bruce 1990, pp. 412–413" /&gt; one of several organizations for the deaf that Bell ultimately donated some $450,000 (approximately ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|450000|1905|r=-6}}}} in current dollars){{Inflation-fn|US}} to starting in the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;

Bruce 1990, p. 294

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Note: The '$450,000' figure was a cumulative amount of numerous donations over multiple years; for the equivalence calculation a median point of 1905 was selected as the midpoint of a 30 year period between 1890 and 1920, shortly before Bell's death. -hz --&gt;

The building, a neoclassical [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] ''[[Anta (architecture)|templum in antis]]'' structure of closely matching golden yellow sandstone and [[Roman brick]] with [[architectural terracotta]] details, was built in 1893 to a design by [[Peabody and Stearns]] of Boston.&lt;ref name="dctravelitin"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Its design is unique in the [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown]] area of Washington, due to its [[Neoclassical architecture|Academic Revival]] style. It was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1972.&lt;ref name="nhlsum" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nrhpinv2"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Volta Bureau's assigned mission was to conduct research into [[Hearing impairment|deafness]] as well as its related [[pedagogy|pedagogical strategies]], Bell would continue with his other scientific, engineering and inventive works for the remainder of his life, conducted mainly at the newer and larger laboratory he built on his [[Nova Scotia]] estate, [[Beinn Breagh]]. Although Bell self-described his occupation as a "teacher of the deaf" throughout his life, his foremost activities revolved around those of general scientific discovery and invention.

By 1887 the Volta Laboratory Association's assets had been distributed among its partners and its collective works had ceased.&lt;ref name="Schoenherr2005" /&gt; In 1895 Bell's father, noted philologist and elocutionist Alexander Melville Bell, who had authored over 45 publications on elocution, the use of [[visible speech]] for the deaf and similar related subjects, assigned all his publication copyrights to the Volta Bureau for its financial benefit.&lt;ref name="B.H.S.-Reville"&gt;

Retrieved from Brantford. Library.on.ca May 4, 2012.

&lt;/ref&gt; The Volta Bureau later evolved into the [[Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing]] (also known as the AG Bell), and its works have actively continued to the present day under its own charter.

The Volta Laboratory Association, or Volta Associates, was created by formal legal agreement on October 8, 1881 (backdated to May 1 of the same year), constituting the Volta Laboratory Association to be the owner of its patents.&lt;ref name="Schoenherr2005" /&gt; It was dissolved in 1886 when its sound recording intellectual property assets were transferred into the Volta Graphophone Company. The association was composed of [[Alexander Graham Bell]], [[Charles Sumner Tainter]] and Bell's cousin, renowned British chemist Dr. [[Chichester Bell]].

During the 1880s the Volta Associates worked on various projects, at times either individually or collectively.&lt;ref name="Schoenherr2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EWB2004"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, work at the laboratory was to focus on telephone applications, but then shifted to phonographic research at the prompting of Tainter.&lt;ref name="ERS" /&gt; The laboratory's projects and achievements included (partial list):

* a 'speed [[Governor (device)|governor]]' for record players (fall 1882);
* the 'air-jet [[Phonograph#Styli|record stylus]]', an electric-pneumatic phonograph stylus designed to reduce background noise while playing a record, resulting in U.S. Patent # 341,212 granted on May 4, 1886 (known as the ''air-jet recorder'') (November 1885);
* an [[audiometer]] – used in both telecommunications and to assist in studies of [[Hearing impairment|deafness]],&lt;ref name="EWB2004" /&gt;

 ... as well as several other important, and commercially decisive improvements to the [[phonograph]], during which they created the tradename for one of their products – the [[Graphophone]] (a playful transposition of ''phonograph'').

=== Tainter's move to the laboratory ===

Earlier Bell had met fellow Cambridge resident, [[Charles Sumner Tainter]], a young self-educated [[Scientific instrument|instrument maker]] who had been assigned to the [[United States Naval Observatory#History|U.S. Transit of Venus Commission]] [[Geodetic astronomy|geodetic]] expedition to New Zealand to observe the planet's [[Transit of Venus, 1874|solar transit]] in December 1874. Tainter subsequently opened a shop for the production of scientific instruments in [[Cambridgeport, Massachusetts]]. He later wrote of his first meeting with Bell: "... one day I received a visit from a very distinguished looking gentleman with jet black hair and beard, who announced himself as Mr. A. Graham Bell. His charm of manner and conversation attracted me greatly....".&lt;ref&gt;

Tainter. p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the creation of the [[Bell Telephone Company]], Bell took his bride, [[Mabel Gardiner Hubbard|Mabel Hubbard]], to Europe for an extended honeymoon. At that time he asked Tainter to move from Cambridge to Washington to start up the new laboratory.&lt;ref name="Tainter-unpub" /&gt; Bell's cousin, [[Chichester Bell]], who had been teaching college chemistry in London, also agreed to come to Washington as the third associate.&lt;ref name="Newville" /&gt; The establishment of the laboratory was comparatively simple; according to Tainter's autobiography:&lt;ref name="Tainter-unpub" /&gt;

{{quote|I therefore wound up my business affairs in Cambridge, packed up all of my tools and machines, and ... went to Washington, and after much search, rented a vacant house [at 1325] 'L' Street, between 13th and 14th Streets, and fitted it up for our purpose&lt;ref&gt;Tainter p.&amp;nbsp;3&lt;/ref&gt;... The [[Smithsonian Institution]] sent us over a mail sack of scientific books from the library of the Institution, to consult, and primed with all we could learn ... we went to work&lt;ref&gt;Tainter p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;... We were like the explorers in an entirely unknown land, where one has to select the path that seems to be most likely to get you to your destination, with no knowledge of what is ahead. In conducting our work we had first to design an experimental apparatus, then hunt about, often in [[Philadelphia]] and [[New York City|New York]], for the materials with which to construct it, which were usually hard to find, and finally build the models we needed, ourselves.&lt;ref name="Newville" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tainter p.&amp;nbsp;30&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bell appeared to have spent little time in the Volta Laboratory. Tainter's unpublished manuscript and notes (later donated to the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Museum of American History]])&lt;ref name="Tainter-unpub" /&gt; depict Bell as the person who suggested the basic lines of [[research]], furnished the financial resources, and then allowed his associates to receive the credit for many of the [[invention]]s that resulted.&lt;ref&gt;Newville, 1959. p. 79, footnote No. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The experimental machines built at the Volta Laboratory include both [[Phonograph#Disc versus cylinder as a recording medium|disc]] and [[Phonograph cylinder|cylinder types]], with some of the disc type [[phonograph|turntables]] rotating vertically about a horizontal axis, as well as a hand-powered, non-magnetic [[tape recorder]]. The records and tapes used with the machines were donated to the collections of the Smithsonian Institution's [[Museum of Natural History]], and were believed to be the oldest reproducible bona fide sound recordings preserved anywhere in the world. While some were scratched and cracked, others were still in good condition when they were received.&lt;ref name="Newville" /&gt;

=== Photophone ===
{{main|Photophone}}

[[File:Photophony1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Bell and Tainter's Photophone receiver, one part of the device to conduct optical telephony.]]

The Photophone, also known as a [[radiophone]], was invented jointly by Bell and his then-assistant Sumner Tainter on February 19, 1880, at Bell's 1325 'L' Street laboratory in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="Bruce" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SDU"&gt;Jones, Newell. [http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/recording/ar304.html First 'Radio' Built by San Diego Resident Partner of Inventor of Telephone: Keeps Notebook of Experiences With Bell], San Diego Evening Tribune, July 31, 1937. Retrieved from the University of San Diego History Department website, November 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bell believed the photophone was his most important [[invention]]. The device allowed for the [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] of [[sound]] on a beam of [[light]]. On April 1, 1880, and also described by plaque as occurring on June 3, Bell's assistant transmitted the world's first wireless [[telephone]] message to him on their newly invented form of [[telecommunication]], the far advanced precursor to [[fiber-optic communication]]s. The wireless call was sent from the [[Franklin School (Washington, D.C.)|Franklin School]] to the window of Bell's laboratory, some 213 meters away.&lt;ref name="Bruce 1990, p. 338" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Carson-2007-gvttw"&gt;Carson 2007, pp.&amp;nbsp;76-78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Groth"&gt;Groth, Mike. [http://www.bluehaze.com.au/modlight/GrothArticle1.htm Photophones Revisted], 'Amateur Radio' magazine, Wireless Institute of Australia, Melbourne, April 1987 pp.&amp;nbsp;12–17; and May 1987 pp.&amp;nbsp;13–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the eighteen [[patent]]s granted in Bell's name alone, and the twelve he shared with his collaborators, four were for the photophone, which Bell referred to as his "greatest achievement", writing that the Photophone was ''"the greatest invention [I have] ever made, greater than the telephone"''.&lt;ref&gt;Phillipson, Donald J.C., and Neilson, Laura [http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/alexander-graham-bell/ "Alexander Graham Bell"], ''The Canadian Encyclopedia'' online&lt;/ref&gt;

Bell transferred the Photophone's rights to the [[Bell Telephone Company|National Bell Telephone Company]] in May 1880.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce 1990, p. 339&lt;/ref&gt; The master patent for the Photophone ({{US patent|235199}} ''Apparatus for Signalling and Communicating, called Photophone''), was issued in December 1880,&lt;ref name="Groth" /&gt; many decades before its principles could be applied to practical applications.

=== {{Visible anchor|Sound recording and phonograph development}} ===
{{Main|Phonograph}}

==== Early challenge ====
Bell and his two associates took Edison's [[tinfoil]] [[phonograph]] and modified it considerably to make it reproduce sound from wax instead of tinfoil. They began their work in Washington, D. C., in 1879, and continued until they were granted basic patents in 1886 for recording in wax.&lt;ref name="Newville" /&gt;

They preserved some 20 pieces of experimental apparatus, including a number of complete machines, at the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. Their first experimental machine was sealed in a box and deposited in the Smithsonian's archives in 1881 in case of a later patent dispute. The others were delivered by Alexander Graham Bell to the National Museum in two lots in 1915 and 1922. Bell was elderly by that time, busy with his [[Alexander Graham Bell#Hydrofoils|hydrofoil]] and [[Alexander Graham Bell#Aeronautics|aeronautical experiments]] in [[Nova Scotia]].&lt;ref name="Newville" /&gt;

In 1947 the Museum received the key to the locked box of experimental "[[Graphophone]]s, " as they were called to differentiate them from Edison's'' 'phonograph'. '' In that year Mrs. Laura F. Tainter also donated to the Smithsonian's [[National Museum of Natural History]] ten bound notebooks, along with Tainter's unpublished autobiography. This material described in detail the strange creations and even stranger experiments at the laboratory which led to the greatly improved phonographs in 1886 that were to help found the recording and dictation machine industries.&lt;ref name="Tainter-unpub"&gt;

Tainter, Charles Sumner. "The Talking Machine And Some Little Known Facts In Connection With Its Early Development", unpublished manuscript in the collections of the [[United States National Museum]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Newville" /&gt;

[[Thomas A. Edison]] had [[Thomas Edison#Beginning his career|invented the phonograph]] in 1877. But the fame bestowed on Edison for this invention (sometimes called his most original) was not due to its quality. Recording with his tinfoil phonograph was too difficult to be practical, as the tinfoil tore easily, and even when the [[Stylus#Use in music recording and reproduction|stylus]] was properly adjusted, its reproduction of sound was distorted and squeaky, and good for only a few playbacks; nevertheless Edison had discovered the secret of [[sound recording]]. However he did not work to improve its quality, likely because of an agreement to spend the next five years developing the [[History of electric power transmission#Early high voltage and commercial systems|New York City electric light and power]] system.&lt;ref name="Newville" /&gt;

Meanwhile, Bell, a [[scientist]] and experimenter at heart, was looking for new worlds to conquer after his invention of the [[telephone]]. According to Sumner Tainter, it was due to [[Gardiner Hubbard|Gardiner Green Hubbard]] that Bell took an interest in the emerging field of phonograph technology. Bell had married Hubbard's daughter [[Mabel Gardiner Hubbard|Mabel]] in 1879 while Hubbard was president of the Edison Speaking Phonograph Company. Hubbard was also one of five stockholders in the ''Edison Speaking Phonograph'', which had purchased the Edison patent for US$10,000 and dividends of 20% of the company's profits.&lt;ref name="CC2"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; But Hubbard's phonograph company was quickly threatened with financial disaster because people wouldn't buy a machine which seldom worked and which was also difficult for the average person to operate.&lt;ref name="Newville" /&gt;

By 1879 Hubbard was able to interest Bell in improving upon the phonograph, and it was agreed that a laboratory should be created in [[Washington, D.C.]] Experiments were also to be conducted in telephone and other telecommunication technologies such as the [[Fiber-optic communication|transmission of sound by light]], which resulted in the [[selenium|selenium-celled]] [[Photophone]].&lt;ref name="Newville" /&gt; Both the Hubbards and the Bells decided to move to the nation's capital, in part due to the [[The Telephone Cases|numerous legal challenges]] to Bell's master telephone patent of 1876. Washington was additionally becoming a center of scientific and institutional organizations, which also facilitated Bell's research work.

==== Graphophone ====
{{see also|Graphophone}}

[[File:Transcription using cylinder phonograph.png|thumb|2 A 'G' (Graham Bell) model Graphophone being played back by a typist after it had previously recorded dictation.]]

By 1881 the Volta Associates had succeeded in improving an Edison tinfoil phonograph significantly. They filled the groove of its heavy iron cylinder with wax, then instead of wrapping a sheet of foil around it and using a blunt stylus to indent the recording into the foil, as Edison did, they used a chisel-like stylus to engrave the recording into the wax. The result was a clearer recording. Rather than apply for a patent at that time, however, they sealed the machine into a metal box and deposited it at the Smithsonian, specifying that it was not to be opened without the consent of two of the three men. By 1937 Tainter was the only one of the Associates still living, and the box preserved at the Smithsonian was opened with his permission. For the occasion, descendants of Alexander Graham Bell gathered in Washington, but Tainter, who held a lifelong admiration of Bell, was too ill to attend and remained at home in [[San Diego]].&lt;ref name="Newville" /&gt;

A recording had been engraved into the wax-filled groove of the modified Edison machine. When it was played, a voice from the distant past spoke, reciting a quotation from [[Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] [[Hamlet]]:&lt;ref&gt;[[The Washington Herald]], October 28, 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Engel"&gt;Engel, Leonard H.

Believing the faint voice to be that of her father, Bell's daughter [[Gilbert Hovey Grosvenor|Mrs. Gilbert Grosvenor]] remarked: "That is just the sort of thing father would have said. He was always quoting from the classics."&lt;ref name="Newville" /&gt; The voice was later identified by Tainter as in fact that of her paternal grandfather, [[Alexander Melville Bell]].&lt;ref name="Engel" /&gt; The historic recording, not heard since 1937, was played again in 2013 and made available online.

The method of sound reproduction used on the machine was even more interesting than the quotation. Rather than a conventional stylus and [[diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]], a jet of high pressure air was used. Tainter had previously recorded, on July 7, 1881:

{{quote|This evening about 7 P.M.... the apparatus being ready the valve upon the top of the air cylinder was opened slightly until a pressure of about 100 lbs. [69 newtons/scm] was indicated by the gage. The phonograph cylinder was then rotated, and the sounds produced by the escaping air could be heard, and the words understood a distance of at least 8 feet from the phonograph. " The point of the jet [nozzle] is glass, and [the air jet] could be directed at a single [record] groove.&lt;ref name="Newville" /&gt;}}

The associates also experimented with other stylus jets of molten metal, wax, and water.&lt;ref name="Newville" /&gt;

Most of the disc machines designed at the Volta Lab had their disc mounted on vertical turntables. The explanation is that in the early experiments the turntable with disc was mounted on the shop lathe, along with the recording and reproducing heads. Later, when the complete models were built most of them featured vertical turntables.&lt;ref name="Newville" /&gt;

One interesting exception was a horizontal seven inch turntable. Although made in 1886, the machine was a duplicate of one made earlier but taken to Europe by [[Chichester Bell]]. Tainter was granted Patent No. 385886 for it on July 10, 1888. The playing arm is rigid except for a pivoted vertical motion of 90 degrees to allow removal of the record or a return to starting position. While recording or playing, the record not only rotated but moved laterally under the stylus which thus described a spiral, recording 150 grooves to the inch.&lt;ref name="Newville" /&gt;

The preserved Bell and Tainter records are of both the lateral cut and the Edison [[Vertical cut recording|hill-and-dale]] (up-and-down) styles. Edison for many years used the "hill-and-dale" method with both cylinder and disc records, and [[Emile Berliner]] is credited with the invention of the lateral cut Gramophone record in 1887. The Volta associates had been experimenting with both types as early as 1881, as is shown by the following quotation from Tainter:&lt;ref&gt;Tainter, pp. 28-29&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The record on the electro-type in the Smithsonian package is of the other form, where the vibrations are impressed parallel to the surface of the recording material, as was done in the old Scott Phonautograph of 1857, thus forming a groove of uniform depth, but of wavy character, in which the sides of the groove act upon the tracing point instead of the bottom, as is the case in the vertical type. This form we named the zig-zag form, and referred to it in that way in our notes. Its important advantage in guiding the reproducing needle I first called attention to in the note on p. 9-Vol 1-Home Notes on March 29-1881, and endeavored to use it in my early work, but encountered so much difficulty in getting a form of reproducer that would work with the soft wax records without tearing the groove, we used the hill and valley type of record more often than the other.}}

The basic distinction between the Edison's first phonograph patent and the Bell and Tainter patent of 1886 was the method of recording. Edison's method was to indent the sound waves on a piece of tin-foil while Bell and Tainter's invention called for cutting or "engraving" the sound waves into an [[Ozokerite|ozokerite wax]] record with a sharp recording stylus.&lt;ref name="Newville" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Intertique" /&gt; At each step of their inventive process the Associates also sought out the best type of materials available in order to produce the clearest and most audible sound reproduction.

The strength of the Bell and Tainter patent was noted in an excerpt from a letter written by Washington patent attorney S. T. Cameron, who was a member of the law firm conducting litigation for the American Graphophone Company. The letter dated December 8, 1914 was addressed to George C. Maynard, Curator of Mechanical Technology at the U.S. National Museum (now the National Museum of Natural History):&lt;ref&gt;Newville, 1959. p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Subsequent to the issuance of the Bell and Tainter patent No. 341214, Edison announced that he would shortly produce his 'new phonograph' which, when it appeared, was in fact nothing but the Bell and Tainter record set forth in their patent 341214, being a record cut or engraved in wax or wax-like material, although Edison always insisted on calling this record an 'indented' record, doubtless because his original tin-foil record was an 'indented' record. Edison was compelled to acknowledge that his 'new phonograph' was an infringement of the Bell and Tainter patent 341214, and took out a license under the Bell and Tainter patent and made his records under that patent as the result of that license.}}

Among the later improvements, the Graphophone used a cutting stylus to create lateral'' 'zig-zag' ''grooves of uniform depth into the wax-coated cardboard cylinders rather than the up-and-down [[hill and dale]] grooves of [[Thomas Edison|Edison's]] then-contemporary phonograph machine designs.&lt;ref name="Newville" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tainter2"&gt;Tainter, Charles Sumner.

Retrieved from University of San Diego History Department website December 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Bell and Tainter developed wax-coated cardboard cylinders for their record cylinders instead of Edison's cast iron cylinder which was covered with a removable film of tinfoil (the actual recording media) that was prone to damage during installation or removal.&lt;ref name="CC" /&gt; Tainter received a separate patent for a tube assembly machine to automatically produce the coiled cardboard tubes which served as the foundation for the wax cylinder records.

Besides being far easier to handle, the wax recording media also allowed for lengthier recordings and created superior playback quality.&lt;ref name="CC"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The Graphophone designs initially deployed foot treadles to rotate the recordings which were then replaced by more convenient wind-up clockwork drive mechanisms and which finally migrated to electric motors, instead of the manual crank that was used on Edison's phonograph.&lt;ref name="CC" /&gt; The numerous improvements allowed for a sound quality that was significantly better than Edison's machine.

==== Magnetic sound recordings ====

The other experimental Graphophones indicate an amazing range of experimentation. While the method of cutting a record on wax was the one later exploited commercially, everything else seems to have been tried at least once.&lt;ref name="Newville" /&gt; The following was noted on Wednesday, March&amp;nbsp;20,&amp;nbsp;1881:

{{quote|A [[fountain pen]] is attached to a diaphragm so as to be vibrated in a plane parallel to the axis of a cylinder—The ink used in this pen to contain iron in a finely divided state, and the pen caused to trace a spiral line around the cylinder as it turned. The cylinder to be covered with a sheet of paper upon which the record is made.... This ink ... can be rendered magnetic by means of a permanent magnet. The sounds were to be reproduced by simply substituting a magnet for the fountain pen....&lt;ref name="Newville" /&gt;}}

The result of these ideas for magnetic reproduction resulted in patent {{US patent|341287}}, granted on May&amp;nbsp;4,&amp;nbsp;1886; which dealt solely with "the reproduction, through the action of magnetism, of sounds by means of records in solid substances. "&lt;ref name="Newville" /&gt;

==== Tape recorder ====
[[File:Early experimental non-magnetic Tape Recorder invented by the Volta Associates -Bell &amp; Tainter -i013.jpg|thumb|right| 225px | The patent drawing for an early hand-powered non-magnetic tape recorder.]]

A non-[[Magnetism|magnetic]], non-[[electricity|electric]], hand-powered [[tape recorder]] was patented by two of the Volta associates in 1886 ({{US patent|341214}}).&lt;ref name="Newville" /&gt; The tape was a 3/16&amp;nbsp;inch (4.8&amp;nbsp;mm) wide strip of paper coated by dipping it in a solution of [[beeswax]] and [[Paraffin wax|paraffin]] and then scraping one side clean before the coating had set. The machine, of sturdy wood and metal construction, was hand-powered by means of a knob fastened to a [[flywheel]]. The tape passed from one eight inch (20.3&amp;nbsp;cm) diameter reel and around a [[pulley]] with guide flanges, where it came into contact with either the recording or playback [[Stylus#Use in music recording and reproduction|stylus]]. It was then wound onto a second reel. The sharp recording stylus, actuated by a sound-vibrated [[mica]] [[Diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]], engraved a groove into the wax coating. In playback mode, a dull, loosely mounted stylus attached to a rubber diaphragm rode in the recorded groove. The reproduced sound was heard through rubber listening tubes&lt;!--Note that a link to "ear tube" redirects to the irrelevant "Tympanostomy tube" article--&gt; like those of a [[stethoscope]].&lt;ref name="Newville" /&gt;

The position of the recording and reproducing heads, mounted alternately on the same two posts, could be adjusted so that several recordings could be cut on the same wax-coated strip. Although the machine was never developed commercially, it is interesting as a predecessor to the later magnetic tape recorder, which it resembles in general design. The tapes, when later examined at one of the Smithsonian Institution's depositories, had become brittle, the heavy paper reels had warped, and the machine's playback head was missing. Otherwise, with some reconditioning the machine could be put back into working order.&lt;ref name="Newville"&gt;

==== Commercialization of phonograph patents ====
{{main|Graphophone}}

In 1885, when the Volta Associates were sure that they had a number of practical inventions, they filed [[patent]] applications and also began to seek out investors.&lt;ref name="Newville" /&gt; They were granted Canadian and U.S. patents for the Graphophone in 1885 and 1886 respectively. The Graphophone was originally intended for business use as a [[dictation machine|dictation recording and playback machine]].&lt;ref name="CC" /&gt; The Graphophone Company of Alexandria, Virginia, was created on January&amp;nbsp;6,&amp;nbsp;1886 and formally incorporated on February&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;1886 by another of Bell's cousins. It was formed to control the patents and to handle the commercial development of their numerous sound recording and reproduction inventions, one of which became the first dictation machine, the '[[Dictaphone]]'.&lt;ref name="Newville" /&gt;

After the Volta Associates gave several demonstrations in the City of Washington, businessmen from [[Philadelphia]] created the American Graphophone Company on March 28, 1887, in order to produce the machines for the budding phonograph marketplace.&lt;ref name="ERS" /&gt; The Volta Graphophone Company then merged with American Graphophone,&lt;ref name="ERS"&gt;Hoffmann, Frank W. &amp; Ferstler, Howard. [https://books.google.com/books?id=xV6tghvO0oMC&amp;pg=PA1167 Encyclopedia of Recorded Sound: Volta Graphophone Company], CRC Press, 2005, Vol.1, p. 1167, {{ISBN|0-415-93835-X}}, {{ISBN|978-0-415-93835-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which itself later evolved into [[Columbia Records]] (co-founded [[CBS]], and now part of the [[Sony]] media empire).&lt;ref name="Schoenherr2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EWB2004" /&gt; Bell's portion of the share exchange at that time had an approximate value of US$200,000 (half of the total received by all of the Associates), $100,000 of which he soon dedicated to the newly formed Volta Bureau's research and pedagogical programs for the deaf.&lt;ref name="Intertique"&gt;Interique. [http://www.intertique.com/TheColumbiaGraphophoneAndGrafonola.html The Columbia Graphophone and Grafonola – A Beginner's Guide], Intertique.com website. Retrieved March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Graphophone Company was founded by a group of investors mainly from the Washington D.C. area, including Edward Easton, a lawyer and [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] reporter, who later assumed the presidency of the [[Columbia Graphophone Company]]. The [[Elias Howe#Later life and legacy|Howe Machine Factory]] (for [[sewing machines]]) in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]], became American Graphophone's first manufacturing plant. Tainter resided there for several months to supervise manufacturing before becoming seriously ill, but later went on to continue his inventive work for many years, as health permitted. The small Bridgeport plant which in its early times was able to produce three or four machines daily later became, as a successor firm, the [[Dictaphone|Dictaphone Corporation]].&lt;ref name="Newville" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Scriptophily"&gt;Scriptophily.com. [http://www.scripophily.net/amgrcowevi19.html American Graphophone Company - 1900], Scriptophily.com, Chantilly, Virginia. Retrieved 17 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Graphophone1901.jpg|thumb|2A later-model Columbia Graphophone of 1901]]

Shortly after American Graphophone's creation, Jesse H. Lippincott used nearly $1 million (approximately ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1000000|1887|r=-4}}}} in today's dollars), {{Inflation-fn|US}} of an inheritance to gain control of it, as well as the rights to the Graphophone and the Bell and Tainter patents.&lt;ref name="Scriptophily" /&gt; Not long later Lippincott purchased the Edison Speaking Phonograph Company, and then created the North American Phonograph Company to consolidate the national sales rights of both the Graphophone and the Edison Speaking Phonograph.&lt;ref name="Scriptophily" /&gt; In the early 1890s Lippincott fell victim to the unit's mechanical problems and also to resistance from [[stenographer]]s. This would postpone the popularity of the Graphophone until 1889 when Louis Glass, manager of the Pacific Phonograph Company would popularize it again through the promotion of nickel-in-the-slot "entertainment" cylinders.

The work of the Volta Associates laid the foundation for the successful use of [[Dictation machine|dictating machines]] in business, because their wax recording process was practical and their machines were durable. But it would take several more years and the renewed efforts of [[Thomas Edison]] and the further improvements of [[Emile Berliner]], and many others, before the [[recording industry]] became a major factor in [[Entertainment center|home entertainment]].&lt;ref name="Newville" /&gt;

== Legacy ==

In 1887, the Volta Associates effectively sold their sound-recording-related [[patents]] to the newly created American Graphophone Company through a share exchange with the Volta Graphophone Company. Bell used the considerable profits from the sale of his Graphophone shares to found the [[Volta Bureau]] as an instrument "for the increase and diffusion of knowledge relating to the deaf",&lt;ref name="Bruce 1990, pp. 412–413" /&gt; and also to fund his other philanthropic works on deafness. His scientific and statistical research work on deafness became so extensive that within a few years his documentation had engulfed an entire room of the Volta Laboratory in his father's backyard carriage house. Due to the limited space available there, and with the assistance of his father who contributed US$15,000 (approximately ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|15000|1887|r=-4}}}} in today's dollars), {{Inflation-fn|US}} Bell had the new Volta Bureau building constructed nearby in 1893.

Under Superintendent John Hitz's direction, the Volta Bureau became one of the world's premiere centers for research on deafness and [[pedagogy]] for the deaf. Bell's Volta Bureau worked in close cooperation with the American Association for the Promotion of the Teaching of Speech to the Deaf (AAPTSD), which was organized in 1890, and which elected Bell its president.&lt;ref name="Bruce 1990, pp. 412–413" /&gt; The Volta's research was later absorbed into the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf (now also known as the 'AG Bell') upon its creation when the Volta Bureau merged with the AAPTSD in 1908, with Bell's financial support.&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald-1996"&gt;Fitzgerald&amp;nbsp;1996&lt;/ref&gt; The AAPTSD was renamed as the [[Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing|Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf]] in 1956.

The historical record of the Volta Laboratory was greatly improved in 1947 when Laura F. Tainter, the widow of associate Sumner Tainter, donated ten surviving volumes (out of 13) of Tainter's ''Home Notes'' to the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Museum of American History]] – Volumes 9, 10 and 13 having been destroyed in a fire in September 1897.&lt;ref name="Schoenherr2005" /&gt; The daily agenda books described in detail the project work conducted at the laboratory during the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;

Museum staff working with scientists at the U.S. Department of Energy's [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] had also revived the voice of his father, [[Alexander Melville Bell]], from an 1881 recording in the wax-filled groove of a modified Edison tinfoil cylinder phonograph.

Both Bells evidently assisted in testing some of the Volta Laboratory's experimental recorders, several of which used discs instead of cylinders. The 4 minute, 35 second test recording on the disc, mostly a recitation of numbers, is dated April 15, 1885 by an inscription in the wax and an announcement in the recording itself. It concludes with an emphatic spoken signature: "Hear my voice. . . . Alexander. . Graham. . Bell."

After hearing the recording, Bell biographer, [[Charlotte Gray (author)|Charlotte Gray]] described it, saying:&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, Rebecca J.

'''Vrindavani Vastra''' is a drape woven by Assamese weavers during 16th century under the guidance of [[Srimanta Sankardeva]], a Vaishnavite saint and scholar who lived in present-day [[Assam]].&lt;ref name=reach&gt;{{cite news|title=Vrindavani Vastra ‘out of reach’ for govt|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1130323/jsp/northeast/story_16704689.jsp#.Un_VB3BHJgg|accessdate=10 November 2013|newspaper=The Telegraph, Kolkotta|date=23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The large drape illustrates the childhood activities of Lord Krishna in [[Vrindavan]].&lt;ref name=reach/&gt; Parts of the original ''Vrindavani vastra'' are presently owned by the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London and  [[Musee Guimet]] (the Guimet Museum) in Paris.  The piece of cloth demonstrates the skillful weaving methods developed during medieval times and such complexity is rarely seen in present-day Assam.&lt;ref name=editorial/&gt;

==History==
Assamese silk weavers depicted scenes from Bhagavatha, Mahabharatha, mainly of the childhood days of Lord Krishalala on silk clothes under the supervision of Saint, scholar, and poet Srimanta Sankardeva and his disciple Madhvadeva during 16th Century.&lt;ref name=gogoi&gt;{{cite news|title=Vrindavani Vastra: Gogoi to move British Museum|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/vrindavani-vastra-gogoi-to-move-british-museum/article5334146.ece|accessdate=10 November 2013|newspaper=TheHindu|date=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; First woven between 1567 and 1569, it was taken to Bhutan and then later to Tibet, where European merchants brought it back to Europe. Presently, it is owned by the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and the Musee Guimet in Paris.&lt;ref name=reach/&gt; Some reports suggest that the Vrindavani Vastra piece was collected by a reporter of "The Times" (London) and donated to the museum &lt;ref name=gogoi/&gt; around 1904.&lt;ref name=editorial&gt;{{cite news|last=Bezboruah|first=D N|title=Lengths of precious fabric|url=http://www.assamtribune.com/scripts/details.asp?id=nov1009/edit2|accessdate=10 November 2013|newspaper=The Assam Tribune (editorial)|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar silk drapes are also held by other museums like The [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]].&lt;ref name=phil&gt;{{cite web|title="Cloth of Vrindavan" (Vrindavani Vastra) depicting Scenes from the Life of Krishna|url=http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/85842.html|publisher=Philadelphia Museum of Art|accessdate=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, a similar piece of silk drape, probably designed by Sankaradeva during 16th Century, was put up for auction by the auction house of Christie's in New York, with a reserve price of $120,000.&lt;ref name=hugh&gt;{{cite news|last=Hugh and Colleen Gantzer|first=Colleen Gantzer|title=The polymath guru of Assam|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-08-28/edit-page/33426189_1_religious-leaders-teachings-monasteries|accessdate=10 November 2013|newspaper=The Times of India|date=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This type of silken-weaving artwork was produced up to around 1715 in Assam and its neighborhood&lt;ref name=mac&gt;{{cite book|last=Mary Schoeser|first=Foreword by JulienMacdonald|title=Silk|year=2007|publisher=Yale Univ.

The exhibit owned by [[British Museum]], acquired in 1904 from Tibet, is nine and half meters long and is made up of several pieces of silk drapes depicting Krishna's (or Vishnu's) life.&lt;ref name=editorial/&gt; Along with colorful pictorial depictions, it has a portion of a poem written by Srimanta Sankardev woven on it.&lt;ref name=editorial/&gt;

There were futile efforts by government agencies of India to bring back the silk drape back to India.&lt;ref name=reach/&gt; During 2013, Assam government, India has requested British Museum to exhibit Vrindavani Vastra at London so that art lovers, researchers, and local people with Assamese heritage can admire the piece of art.&lt;ref name=gogoi/&gt; This textile is now on display until August 2016 in the exhibition 'Krishna in the garden of Assam: the cultural context of an Indian textile' in Room 91 of the British Museum.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2776">A '''Wallbook''' is a large printed [[book]] that is designed also to be mounted on a wall. For example, its design may be [[concertina]] folded so it can be read like a book or hung on a wall.

==Etymology==
The name was coined by [[Christopher Lloyd (world history author)]], creator of the 2010 ''The What on Earth? Wallbook'' which claims to be the first ever attempt to illustrate the entire history of everything from the [[Big Bang]] to the present day on a single [[timeline]].{{deadlink|date=August 2017}}
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thebookseller.com/news/127565-publisher-launches-with-versatile-wallbook--.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and contents==
Reviewing the book for the ''Telegraph's'' Family Book Club, the writer Christopher Middleton encapsulates the work as a "7-foot, six-inch-long chart, which starts out some four billion years ago, with the explosion that triggered the Earth’s birth, and ends just a matter of months ago, with the election of [[Barack Obama]] and the [[Global credit crunch of 2008|global credit crunch]]" of 2008.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt;

''The What on Earth? Wallbook'' is notable for its use of a [[logarithmic time]]scale. At the beginning of the timeline 1&amp;nbsp;cm represents the passage of 1 billion years but by the end of the timeline the same space accounts for just five years. A total of 12 changes of scale accounts for how the whole of the past can be graphically represented on a single piece of paper.

The wallbook’s 1,000 pictures and captions are arranged into 12 streams of colours which provide the [[Painted photography backdrops|backdrops]] along which the major events of [[Natural history|natural]] and [[human history]] unfold. The section, "Space, Earth, Sky, Sea, Land and Humanity" accounts for the story of [[evolution]] while [[Asia]], the [[Middle East]], [[Europe]], the [[Americas]], [[Africa]] and [[Australasia]] convey the rise and fall of human civilisations.

At the top of the timeline is a series of globes that start by showing the movement of the world’s [[continental plates]] but later chart the rise and fall of major human [[empire]]s.

==Distribution==
''The What on Earth? Wallbook'' was launched exclusively through [[The Daily Telegraph]] newspaper on Saturday 4 September 2010.&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt; https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookclub/7979831/Family-Book-Club-The-What-on-Earth-Wallbook.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nomenclature==
Since the launch of the ''What on Earth? Wallbook'' the word ''wallbook'' has been defined in ''Macmillan's Open Dictionary'' as a new noun meaning: "a large printed book which can be mounted on a wall". &lt;ref&gt;http://www.macmillandictionary.com/open-dictionary/entries/wallbook.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
