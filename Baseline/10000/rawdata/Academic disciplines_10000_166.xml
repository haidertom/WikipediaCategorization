The '''Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations''' ('''ADHO'''), is a [[digital humanities]] umbrella organization formed in 2005 to coordinate the activities of several regional DH organizations, referred to as constituent organizations.&lt;ref name="Unsworth"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; ADHO's constituent organizations are the European Association for Digital Humanities&lt;ref&gt;[http://eadh.org/ European Association for Digital Humanities]&lt;/ref&gt; (EADH), the Association for Computers and the Humanities&lt;ref&gt;[http://ach.org/ Association for Computers and the Humanities]&lt;/ref&gt; (ACH), the Canadian Society for Digital Humanities&lt;ref&gt;[http://csdh-schn.org/ Canadian Society for Digital Humanities]&lt;/ref&gt; (CSDH/SCHN), centerNet,&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalhumanities.org/centernet/ centerNet]&lt;/ref&gt; the Australasian Association for Digital Humanities&lt;ref&gt;[http://aa-dh.org/ Australasian Association for Digital Humanities]&lt;/ref&gt; (aaDH), the Japanese Association for Digital Humanities&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jadh.org/ Japanese Association for Digital Humanities]&lt;/ref&gt; (JADH) and Humanistica,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanisti.ca Humanistica]&lt;/ref&gt; the french-speaking association for Digital Humanities.

==History==
The effort to establish the alliance began in [[Tübingen]], Germany, at the ALLC/ACH conference in 2002: a steering committee was appointed at the ALLC/ACH meeting in 2004, in [[Gothenburg]], Sweden, and the executive committees of the ACH and [[Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing]]  (ALLC) approved the governance and conference protocols at the 2005 meeting in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], Canada. 
The [[Association for Computers and the Humanities]] was also included.&lt;ref name="Unsworth" /&gt;
In 2007, the Alliance Steering Committee voted to enfranchise [[Society for Digital Humanities|The Society for Digital Humanities / Société pour l'étude des médias interactifs]] (SDH/SEMI) of Canada.
In 2012,  centerNet, a network of digital humanities centers, became a "constituent organization" affiliated with ADHO,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= centerNet to join ADHO |date= August 17, 2011 |work= ADHO centerNet blog |url= http://digitalhumanities.org/centernet/2011/08/centernet-to-join-adho |accessdate = October 20, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by the Japanese Association for Digital Humanities in 2013 and the French-speaking Association for Digital Humanities, Humanistica, in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Humanistica rejoint officiellement ADHO |date= July 15, 2016 |work= Humanistica website |url= http://www.humanisti.ca/humanistica-adho/ |accessdate = July 15, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ADHO gained legal status as the Stichting ADHO Foundation (Netherlands) in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bedrijfnederland.nl/zuid-holland/den-haag/stichting-adho-foundation Stichting ADHO Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''American Institute for Economic Research''' ('''AIER'''), located in [[Great Barrington, Massachusetts]], is an independent [[501(c)#501(c)(3)|501(c)(3)]] economic research institute that represents no fund, concentration of wealth, or other special interests. AIER publishes research and critical analysis based on the principles of scientific inquiry and positive economics. 

As of 2017, the president of the Institute is [[Edward Stringham]], previously a professor of economics at [[Trinity College (Connecticut)|Trinity College]] in [[Connecticut]].&lt;ref name=Eagle&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.berkshireeagle.com/stories/aier-names-new-president,509745|title=American Institute for Economic Research names new president|work=The Berkshire Eagle|date=June 7, 2017|author=Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==

The mission of AIER is to conduct independent, scientific, economic research to educate individuals, thereby advancing their personal interests and those of their nation. Neither the Institute itself nor members of its staff may derive profit from organizations or businesses that happen to benefit from the results of Institute research.

==History==

On the advice of Dr. [[Vannevar Bush]], then vice-president and dean of engineering at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], Col. [[Edward C. Harwood]] founded AIER to conduct research into the wide range of economic, social, and monetary developments that had contributed to the catastrophic economic contraction of the Great Depression. Harwood, a graduate of the United States Military Academy, was serving in the Army Corps of Engineers in the 1920s when he undertook an intensive study of economics, with particular emphasis on money-credit problems. Bush's support for Harwood was based on articles that Harwood has published in financial journals in 1928 and 1929 that accurately predicted the impending depression. AIER was housed initially in an office at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], then moved to [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. At the end of World War II, Harwood relocated to a "white elephant" manor house in Great Barrington. In 1956-57, a print shop annex and warehouse were built, and in 1962 a research library was added to the hillside below the annex. The print shop closed in 2008, as AIER transitioned from print to digital dissemination of its research.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title of that paper is "Synthesis of the Elements in Stars", but as that paper grew in influence it came to be referred to only as "B&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;FH". The B&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;FH paper spread [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] theory widely in the scientific community, especially among astronomers who saw everyday relevance to their quest, at a time when it was appreciated by only a handful of experts in nuclear physics. But it did not ''create'' the theory of stellar nucleosynthesis as much as bring it vividly to life.

The paper comprehensively outlined and analyzed several key processes that are responsible for the nucleosynthesis of the elements heavier than iron and [[Abundance of the chemical elements|their relative abundance]] by the capture within stars of free neutrons. It advanced much less the understanding of the synthesis of the very abundant elements from silicon to nickel. A puzzle about that is that despite Hoyle's coauthorship of B&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;FH and being its chief conceptual architect, the paper did not include the [[carbon-burning process]], the [[oxygen-burning process]] and the [[silicon-burning process]], each of which contributes massively to the growth of stellar metallicity from magnesium to nickel in the interstellar gas. The [[supernova nucleosynthesis]] that achieves that had been published by Hoyle in 1954&lt;ref name=hoyle54/&gt;. [[Donald D. Clayton]] has attributed the severe undercitations of Hoyle's 1954 paper relative to the voluminous citations of B&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;FH to several factors: the advanced difficulty of digesting Hoyle's 1954 paper even for his B&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;FH coauthors, as it proved to be for the world of astronomy generally; to Hoyle's having described its key equation only in words&lt;ref&gt;

==Physics in 1957==
At the time of the publication of the B&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;FH paper, [[George Gamow]] advocated a theory of the universe according to which virtually all [[Chemical element|elements]], or [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]], were synthesized during the [[big bang]]. The implications of Gamow's nucleosynthesis theory (not to be confused with present-day [[nucleosynthesis]] theory) would be that [[Abundance of the chemical elements|nuclear abundances]] in the universe are largely static. Together, [[Hans Bethe]] and [[Charles Critchfield|Charles L. Critchfield]] had derived the [[Proton proton chain]] (pp-chain) in 1938,&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; had independently derived the [[CNO cycle]] in 1938 and 1939, respectively, to show that the conversion of [[hydrogen]] to [[helium]] by [[nuclear fusion]] could account for stellar energy production. Thus, it was known by Gamow and others that the [[Abundance of the chemical elements|abundances]] of hydrogen and helium were not perfectly static. Small production of helium would add marginally to its abundance left by the Big Bang. But stellar nuclear power was not a compelling step toward stellar nucleosynthesis. The elements from carbon upward remained a mystery.
Gamow advocated the theory that all elements were residual from the big bang, also allowing for slight changes in the ratios of hydrogen and helium.

Then Fred Hoyle, initially in 1946 and later in 1954,&lt;ref name=hoyle54/&gt; and his three collaborators who authored B&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;FH gave a different account for the origin of heavy elements. They claimed that all other atomic nuclei heavier than [[lithium]] had to have been synthesized in [[star]]s rather than during the Big Bang, if a Big Bang had in fact occurred (as was later confirmed). Both theories agreed that some light nuclei (hydrogen, helium and a relatively tiny mass of lithium) were not created in stars, and this contributed to the now-accepted theory of [[big bang nucleosynthesis]] of H, He and Li.

==Physics in the paper==
Because the idea of origin of the atoms of the chemical elements within stars is that a majority of all elements (all except for hydrogen, helium and the tiny amount of lithium) must come from stars, that idea is called the theory of [[stellar nucleosynthesis]]&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The key difference between this theory of stellar nucleosynthesis and all previous accounts for the origin of the elements is that it predicted [[Stellar nucleosynthesis|chemical evolution]] of the universe, which is testable by astronomers' measuring stellar [[spectral lines]]. [[Quantum mechanics]] explains why different atoms emit light at [[Electromagnetic spectroscopy|characteristic wavelengths]] and so, by studying the light emitted from different stars, one may infer the atmospheric composition of individual stars. Upon undertaking such a task, observations indicate a strong [[Negative relationship|negative correlation]] between a star's initial heavy element content ([[metallicity]]) and its age ([[red shift]]). More recently formed stars tend to have higher metallicity.

[[Big bang nucleosynthesis]] tells us that the early universe consisted of only the light elements, and so one expects the first stars to be composed of [[hydrogen]], [[helium]], and [[lithium]], the three lightest elements. [[Stellar structure]] and the [[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram]] indicate that the length of the lifetime of a star depends greatly on its initial mass, so that massive stars are very short-lived, and less massive stars are longer-lived. B&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;FH argues that as a star dies, it will enrich the [[interstellar medium]] with 'heavy elements' (in this case all elements heavier than lithium, the third element), from which newer stars are formed. This account is consistent with the observed negative correlation between stellar metallicity and red shift.

The theory presented by the authors of B&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;FH also described key aspects of the [[nuclear physics]] and [[astrophysics]] involved in how stars achieve this creative act. By carefully scrutinizing the [[table of nuclides]], they were able to characterize the existence of different stellar environments that could produce the observed [[Abundance of the chemical elements|isotopic abundances]] and the nuclear processes that must occur in these stars. In this paper the authors described creatively the existence of the [[p-process]], [[r-process]], and [[s-process]] to account for the elements heavier than [[iron]]. The abundances of these heavy elements and their isotopes are roughly 100,000 times less than those of the major elements, which Hoyle (1954)&lt;ref name=hoyle54/&gt; had explained three years earlier by nuclear fusion within the burning shells of massive stars.

==Writing of the paper==
[[Margaret Burbidge]] and [[Geoffrey Burbidge]] wrote the first complete draft of the paper in 1956 at Caltech, incorporating an earlier draft of material by Fowler and Hoyle and adding extensive astronomical observations and experimental data to support the theory. Both of the Burbidges had temporary positions created for them in 1956 at Caltech by W.A. Fowler for this purpose. Hoyle and [[William Alfred Fowler|Fowler]] had worked extensively on the early draft in 1955 when all four coauthors were temporarily together in Cambridge U.K. The original theory of [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] had been created earlier in published research papers in 1946 and 1954 by Fred Hoyle in Cambridge. Geoffrey Burbidge has asserted that it is a misconception some have had to presume that Fowler was the leader of the group because the writing and submission for publication were done at Caltech in 1956. But Fowler, though an accomplished nuclear physicist, was still actively learning Hoyle's theory in 1955 while on sabbatical leave from Caltech and later stated emphatically&lt;ref&gt;"William A. Fowler - Nobel Lecture: Experimental and Theoretical Nuclear Astrophysics; the Quest for the Origin of the Elements". Nobelprize.org. Nobel Media AB 2014. Web. 29 Mar 2018. http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1983/fowler-lecture.html (see Biographical)&lt;/ref&gt; that Hoyle was the intellectual leader of this effort. Both Burbidges were also learning Hoyle's theory during 1954-55 in Cambridge. And yet "There was no leader in the group," G. Burbidge puzzlingly wrote in 2008, "we all made substantial contributions".&lt;ref name=hoylesrole&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fowler appeared to be their leader only by virtue of getting the paper written and submitted at Caltech, and Fowler asserted that Hoyle was the leader. So Burbidge's remarks could validly be questioned.

==Recognition==
Because B2FH firmly focused scientific attention onto the field of [[nuclear astrophysics]], it has frequently been said to have founded that field, which exaggerates its importance to the history of science considerably. Although the scientific theory had clearly been started by Fred Hoyle's 1946 and 1954 published papers as well as by his attracting to Cambridge U.K. the B2FH team, Hoyle's own papers did not attract the scientific following that the B2FH paper quickly achieved. Some writers have erroneously stated [[William Alfred Fowler|William A. Fowler]] was awarded half of the 1983 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for his contributions to B2FH, but that prize was clearly stated instead&lt;ref&gt;"William A. Fowler - Facts". Nobelprize.org. Nobel Media AB 2014. Web. 28 Mar 2018. http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1983/fowler-facts.html
"William A. Fowler - Nobel Lecture: Experimental and Theoretical Nuclear Astrophysics; the Quest for the Origin of the Elements". Nobelprize.org. Nobel Media AB 2014.

Fowler's contributions to B2FH can clearly also seen in the nuclear expertise of the details of the [[s-process]] and the [[r-process]], which were its major new creative theories which  captured the excitement of astronomers. Some believe that [[Fred Hoyle]] also deserved similar Nobel Prize recognition for his scholarship creating the theory, and they contend that his unorthodox views concerning the [[Big Bang]] played a role in his not being awarded a share of the [[Nobel Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;

[[Geoffrey Burbidge]] wrote in 2008, "Hoyle should have been awarded a Nobel Prize for this and other work. On the basis of my private correspondence, I believe that a major reason for his exclusion was that W. A. Fowler was believed to be the leader of the group."&lt;ref name=hoylesrole/&gt; Burbidge stated that this perception is not true and also points to Hoyle's earlier papers from 1946 as indicators of Hoyle's role in the authorship of the theory of [[stellar nucleosynthesis]]&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burbidge said that "Hoyle's work has been undercited in part because it was published in an astrophysical journal,&lt;ref name=hoyle54/&gt; and a new one at that (the very first volume, in fact), whereas B&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;FH was published in a well-established physics journal, ''[[Reviews of Modern Physics]]''. When B&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;FH was first written, preprints were widely distributed to the [[nuclear physics]] community. Willy Fowler was very well known as a leader in that community, and the [[California Institute of Technology]] already had a news bureau that knew how to spread the word."

In 2007 a conference was held at Caltech in [[Pasadena, California]] to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the publication of B&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;FH.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opening session on July 23 was titled ''Historical Perspective'', but only G.R. Burbidge and Donald D. Clayton, Fowler's research student during 1956-1961, actually presented talks on that topic. Burbidge posted a lengthy text that included his remarks on the writing of B&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;FH, but also on several other topics that seem to be part of a longer multi-purpose text that exceeded his remarks at the conference. Clayton&lt;ref&gt;http://www.na2007.caltech.edu/Talks/ClaytonCommentsNA2007.doc &lt;/ref&gt; on the other hand posted both his power point slides and his comments on his historical opinion of cultural reasons for the great fame achieved by B&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;FH. He pointed specifically to the high praise among astronomers owing to B&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;FH citing more than a hundred astronomy papers that thrilled astronomers by their referring to observational signs of stellar nucleosynthesis. These brought new headline purpose to astronomers' research, whereas Hoyle's 1954 paper focused only on his nucleosynthesis theory.

==Cultural revolution: Computers==

The papers of Hoyle (1946) and Hoyle (1954) and of B2FH (1957) were written by those scientists before the advent of the age of computers.  They used hand calculations, deep thought, physical intuition, and thorough familiarity with details of nuclear physics. Brilliant as these founding papers were, a cultural disconnect emerged with a younger generation of workers who began to construct computer programs&lt;ref&gt;Donald D. Clayton, Principles of Stellar Evolution and Nucleosynthesis, McGraw-Hill (1968) Chapter 6. Calculation of Stellar Structure&lt;/ref&gt; that would eventually yield numerical answers for the advanced evolution of stars&lt;ref&gt;For example, {{cite journal |last1=Iben |first1=Icko, Jr. |title=Stellar Evolution.VI.

They usually did not cite Hoyle (1954) but did cite B2FH, which became a needed default citation for stellar nucleosynthesis.  This cultural revolution began in late 1960s. The upshot in regard to the confusion over Hoyle and B2FH that followed was made possible by the B2FH review's failing to review Hoyle’s picture. Understandable therefore was the new generation's feeling of discovering themselves the picture that Hoyle had presented, albeit with huge numerical details. The computer models of massive stars demonstrated that core burning in massive stars occurred in smaller cores than the previous burning phase had. This shrinking of successive cores yielded an ''onion shell model'' of the sequence of burning phases, a shell model that was necessary for Hoyle's 1954 picture to work as simultaneous ejection of the abundances from each burning phase. Understanding this cultural revolution of computing takes one far in understanding why Hoyle (1954) was forgotten and B2FH appeared to have been the work that founded stellar nucleosynthesis, as many even claimed.

Founded in 1984, CADRE is the second oldest media lab in the United States and has a long and notable list of alumni. CADRE offers [[Bachelor of Fine Arts|BFA]] and [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] degrees in Digital Media Art.  CADRE has published SWITCH, an online journal of [[new media]], since 1995.

SWITCH and CADRE were early centers of the [[net.art]] movement that coincided with the [[Dot-com bubble]] in nearby [[Silicon Valley]].

The CADRE labs have historically worked closely with the ZeroOne Biennial, one of the foremost new media art exhibitions in the world. In 2006, CADRE, along with SJSU served as the academic hosts for the [[ISEA International|ISEA]] symposium and [https://web.archive.org/web/20070204134816/http://www.01sj.org/ ZeroOne Festival] held in San Jose.

The '''Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics''' ('''CITA''') is a national [[research institute]] funded by the [[Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council]], located at the [[University of Toronto]] in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada. CITA's mission is "to foster interaction within the Canadian theoretical [[Astrophysics]] community and to serve as an international center of excellence for theoretical studies in astrophysics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.cita.utoronto.ca/reports/annrep/AnnRep01/|title = CITA Annual Report 2001|publisher = Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics}}&lt;/ref&gt;  CITA was incorporated in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.nserc.gc.ca/programs/real2000/submissions/gsc17a_e.htm|title = Reallocations Exercise: 2000-2002|publisher = National Science and Engineering Research Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CITA has close administrative and academic relations with the [[Canadian Institute for Advanced Research]] (CIFAR); several CITA faculty also serve as members of CIFAR.

==History==
The concept of a nationally-supported institute for theoretical astrophysics dates back to discussions within the [[Canadian Astronomical Society]] in the early 1980s. A series of committees advocated a model of a university‑based institute governed by a council of Canadian astrophysicists.  Proposals were solicited from universities across the country to host this institute, which by now had been named the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics/Institut Canadien d'astrophysique theorique (CITA/ICAT). The [[University of Toronto]] won the resulting spirited competition, and CITA ([[University of Toronto]]) was established as an institute within the School of Graduate Studies in June 1984, with staff consisting of a single professor ([[Peter G. Martin]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.cita.utoronto.ca/index.php/news/cita_professor_peter_martin_elected_to_royal_society_of_canada|title = CITA Professor Peter Martin Elected to Royal Society of Canada|publisher = Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://archive.is/20120722053248/http://www.cita.utoronto.ca/index.php/news/cita_professor_peter_martin_elected_to_royal_society_of_canada|archivedate = 2012-07-22|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;) as the Acting Director and a visiting professor from [[Queen's University]] (Richard Henriksen) and a temporary administrative assistant.  Today there are 7 faculty members two of which are [[Canada Research Chairs]], two administrative staff, a Systems Manager and technical computing staff.

At the same time, Professor [[Richard Henriksen]] worked on establishing CITA, Inc. (a separate entity from CITA the institute at the University of Toronto) as an incorporated national institute and charity governed by an elected Council of Canadian astrophysics/relativity professors to promote research in theoretical astrophysics across the country.  CITA Council is selected from CITA Inc members.  There are presently 55 members of CITA, Inc.

CITA's research activities are supported by the [[University of Toronto]], [[Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council|NSERC]], multiple grants by the Ontario and Federal governments, as well as private sponsors including the [[Simons Foundation]] and [[CIFAR]].

==Membership==
CITA has a small number of long-term faculty members, and a larger number of short term (3- or 5-year) postdoctoral positions, as well as an active visitor program; the purpose of the relatively high influx of new researchers or visitors is to ensure that timely topics are well represented at CITA.  There are currently approximately 20 postdoctoral researchers at CITA, and 4 full-time administrative and computer staff.  Several graduate students in the [[University of Toronto]] Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics or Department of Physics work with CITA researchers throughout their graduate work, and typically ten undergraduates come to CITA to work over the summer.

In 1985, Scott D. Tremaine came to CITA as its first Director; Margaret Fukunaga was hired as the permanent Business Officer and Richard Bond arrived as the second faculty member.  [[J. Richard Bond|Richard Bond]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2007-03/nsae-wca031407.php|title = World-leading cosmologist at University of Toronto wins Canada's most prestigious science prize|publisher = EurekAlert!}}&lt;/ref&gt; became the Director in 1996 and Norman Murray was director 2006-2016.

In chemical genetics, the phenotype is disturbed not by introduction of mutations, but by exposure to small molecule tool compounds. [[Phenotypic screening]] of chemical libraries is used to identify drug targets ([[forward genetics]]) or to validate those targets in experimental models of disease ([[reverse genetics]]).&lt;ref name="isbn3-527-30987-X"&gt;{{cite book | editors = Folkers G, Kubinyi H, Müller G, Mannhold R | title = Chemogenomics in drug discovery: a medicinal chemistry perspective | publisher = Wiley-VCH | location = Weinheim | year = 2004 | pages = 69–96 | isbn = 3-527-30987-X | chapter = The value of chemical genetics in drug discovery | authors = Russel K, Michne WF  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent applications of this topic have been implicated in signal transduction, which may play a role in discovering new cancer treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Carlson SM, White FM | title = Expanding applications of chemical genetics in signal transduction | journal = Cell Cycle | volume = 11 | issue = 10 | pages = 1903–9 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22544320 | doi = 10.4161/cc.19956 | pmc=3359120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemical genetics can serve as a unifying study between chemistry and biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Connor CJ, Laraia L, Spring DR | title = Chemical genetics | journal = Chemical Society Reviews | volume = 40 | issue = 8 | pages = 4332–45 | date = Aug 2011 | pmid = 21562678 | doi = 10.1039/C1CS15053G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Conquering Infinity with Chemical Genetics | first = Malorye | last = Branca | name-list-format = vanc | date = Feb 2003 | url = http://www.bio-itworld.com/archive/021003/infinity.htmln | work = Bio IT World }}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method ==

Chemical genetic screens are performed using libraries of [[small molecule]]s that have known activities or simply diverse chemical structures. These screens can be done in a [[high-throughput screening|high-throughput]] mode, using 96 well-plates, where each well contains cells treated with a unique compound.  In addition to cells, ''[[Xenopus]]'' or [[zebrafish]] embryos can also be screened in 96 well format where compounds are dissolved in the media in which embryos grow. Embryos are let developed until the stage of interest and then the phenotype can be analyzed. Several concentrations can be tested in order to determine the toxic and the optimal concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomlinson ML, Rejzek M, Fidock M, Field RA, Wheeler GN | title = Chemical genomics identifies compounds affecting Xenopus laevis pigment cell development | language = en | journal = Molecular bioSystems | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | pages = 376–84 | date = Apr 2009 | pmid = 19396374 | doi = 10.1039/B818695B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kälin RE, Bänziger-Tobler NE, Detmar M, Brändli AW | title = An in vivo chemical library screen in Xenopus tadpoles reveals novel pathways involved in angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis | journal = Blood | volume = 114 | issue = 5 | pages = 1110–22 | date = Jul 2009 | pmid = 19478043 | pmc = 2721788 | doi = 10.1182/blood-2009-03-211771 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

Adding compounds to developing embryos allow comprehension of mechanism of action of drugs, their toxicity and developmental processes involving their targets. Chemical screens have been mostly performed on either wild type or transgenic ''[[Xenopus]]'' and [[zebrafish]] organisms as they produce a large amount of synchronized, fast-to-develop and transparent eggs easy to visually score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Taylor KL, Grant NJ, Temperley ND, Patton EE | title = Small molecule screening in zebrafish: an in vivo approach to identifying new chemical tools and drug leads | journal = Cell Communication and Signaling | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 11 | date = 2010-06-12 | pmid = 20540792 | doi = 10.1186/1478-811x-8-11 | pmc=2912314}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ny A, Autiero M, Carmeliet P | title = Zebrafish and Xenopus tadpoles: small animal models to study angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis | journal = Experimental Cell Research | volume = 312 | issue = 5 | pages = 684–93 | date = Mar 2006 | pmid = 16309670 | doi = 10.1016/j.yexcr.2005.10.018 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014482705004854 | series = Special Issue on Angiogenesis }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of chemicals in developmental biology offers two main advantages. Firstly, it is easy to perform high-throughput screen using wide spectrum or specific target compounds and reveal important genes or pathways involved in developmental processes. Secondly, it allows narrowing the time of action of a particular gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomlinson ML, Guan P, Morris RJ, Fidock MD, Rejzek M, Garcia-Morales C, Field RA, Wheeler GN | title = A chemical genomic approach identifies matrix metalloproteinases as playing an essential and specific role in Xenopus melanophore migration | journal = Chemistry &amp; Biology | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 93–104 | date = Jan 2009 | pmid = 19171309 | doi = 10.1016/j.chembiol.2008.12.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be used as a tool in drug development to test toxicity in whole organism. Procedures such as FETAX  (Frog Embryo Teratogenesis Assay – Xenopus) are being developed to implement chemical screenings to test toxicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hu L, Zhu J, Rotchell JM, Wu L, Gao J, Shi H | title = Use of the enhanced frog embryo teratogenesis assay-Xenopus (FETAX) to determine chemically-induced phenotypic effects | journal = The Science of the Total Environment | volume = 508 | pages = 258–65 | date = Mar 2015 | pmid = 25481254 | doi = 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.11.086 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Zebrafish and ''Xenopus'' embryos have also been used to identify new drugs targeting a particular gene of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Molina G, Vogt A, Bakan A, Dai W, Queiroz de Oliveira P, Znosko W, Smithgall TE, Bahar I, Lazo JS, Day BW, Tsang M | title = Zebrafish chemical screening reveals an inhibitor of Dusp6 that expands cardiac cell lineages | journal = Nature Chemical Biology | volume = 5 | issue = 9 | pages = 680–7 | date = Sep 2009 | pmid = 19578332 | pmc = 2771339 | doi = 10.1038/nchembio.190 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Collegio Carlo Alberto''' is a private research and teaching institution, located in the city of [[Turin]], northern Italy, in the [[province of Turin]]. The institution was created in 2004 as a joint initiative of the [[:it:Compagnia di San Paolo|Compagnia di San Paolo]] and the [[University of Turin]], at first located in [[Moncalieri]]. Its mission is to foster research and education in social sciences. President of the Collegio is Pietro Terna.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carloalberto.org/collegio/about-us/governance/ Governance] on the official website&lt;/ref&gt;

The Collegio's research community consists of full-time junior and senior faculty hired on the international academic job market, faculty of the University of Turin, and visiting scholars. They conduct research within the social sciences with both empirical and theoretical emphasis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carloalberto.org/research/ Research] on the official website&lt;/ref&gt; 
Research interactions are fostered by seminar series and scientific conferences. Since 2006 the Collegio has hosted hundreds of international speakers, including Nobel laureates, and leaders of financial institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carloalberto.org/events/overview/ Events] on the official website&lt;/ref&gt;

The Collegio coordinates the ''Allievi'' Honors Program, organizes five one-year master's degree programs (Economics, Economics and Complexity, Finance, Insurance and Risk Management, Public Policy and Social Change), and hosts two doctoral programs of the University of Turin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carloalberto.org/education/ Education] on the official website&lt;/ref&gt; 
English is the official operating language of the Collegio.

Historically, prior to the 1990s, the ''Collegio Carlo Alberto'' referred to a [[Piedmont]] boys boarding school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realcollegio.carloalberto.org/ History of Real Collego Carlo Alberto] (in Italian)&lt;/ref&gt;  The school has since closed, but the building retains its name.

'''Computational humor''' is a branch of [[computational linguistics]] and [[artificial intelligence]] which uses [[computer]]s in [[humor research]]. It is a relatively new area, with the first dedicated conference organized in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Hulstijn, J, and Nijholt, A. (eds.). Proceedings of the International Workshop on Computational Humor. Number 12 in Twente Workshops on Language Technology, Enschede, Netherlands. University of Twente, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first "computer model of a sense of humor" was suggested by
Suslov as early as 1992.&lt;ref&gt;I.M.Suslov, Computer Model of "a Sense of Humour". I. General Algorithm. Biofizika SSSR 37, 318 (1992) [Biophysics 37, 242 (1992)]; https://arxiv.org/abs/0711.2058.&lt;/ref&gt; Investigation of the general scheme of information processing shows the possibility of a specific malfunction, conditioned by the necessity of a quick deletion from consciousness of a false version. This specific malfunction can be identified with a humorous effect on psychological grounds: it exactly corresponds to incongruity-resolution theory. However, an essentially new ingredient, the role of timing, is added to the well-known role of ambiguity. In biological systems, a sense of humor inevitably develops in the course of evolution, because its biological function consists of quickening the transmission of the processed information into consciousness and in a more effective use of brain resources. A realization of this algorithm in neural networks&lt;ref&gt;I.M.Suslov, Computer Model of "a Sense of Humour". II. Realization in Neural Networks. Biofizika SSSR 37, 325 (1992) [Biophysics {\bf 37}, 249 (1992)] https://arxiv.org/abs/0711.2061.&lt;/ref&gt; justifies naturally Spencer's hypothesis on the mechanism of laughter: deletion of a false version corresponds to zeroing of some part of the neural network and excessive energy of neurons is thrown out to the motor cortex, arousing muscular contractions.

A practical realization of this algorithm needs extensive databases, whose creation in the automatic regime was suggested recently.&lt;ref&gt;I.M.Suslov, How to Realize "a Sense of Humour" in Computers? https://arxiv.org/abs/0711.3197.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, this magistral direction was not developed properly and subsequent investigations accepted somewhat specialized colouring.

==Joke generators==

===Pun generation===
An approach to analysis of humor is classification of jokes. A further step is an attempt to generate jokes basing on the rules that underlie classification.

Simple prototypes for computer [[pun]] generation were reported in the early 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;Lessard, G. and Levison, M. (1992). Computational modeling of linguistic humour: Tom Swifties. In ALLC/ACH Joint Annual Conference, Oxford, pages 175–178.&lt;/ref&gt; based on a [[natural language generator]] program, [[VINCI (software)|VINCI]]. [[Graeme Ritchie (scientist)|Graeme Ritchie]] and [[Kim Binsted]] in their 1994 research paper described a computer program, JAPE, designed to generate question-answer-type [[pun]]s from a general, i.e., non-humorous, lexicon.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Binsted, Graeme Ritchie (1994) "A symbolic description of punning riddles and its computer implementation." Research Paper 688, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Scotland, 1994, reported at the International Conference on Humor and Laughter, Luxembourg, 1993
*(conference proceeding version of the above) An implemented model of punning riddles. In Proceedings of the Twelfth National Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-94), Seattle, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;  (The program name is an acronym for "Joke Analysis and Production Engine".) Some examples produced by JAPE are:

:Q: What is the difference between leaves and a car?
:A: One you brush and rake, the other you rush and brake.

:Q: What do you call a strange market?
:A: A bizarre bazaar.

Since then the approach has been improved, and the latest report, dated 2007, describes the STANDUP joke generator, implemented in the [[Java programming language]].&lt;ref name=rmpwbd&gt;Graeme Ritchie, Ruli Manurung, Helen Pain, Annalu Waller, Rolf Black, Dave O'Mara. "[http://homepages.abdn.ac.uk/g.ritchie/pages/papers/ijwcc07.pdf A practical application of computational humour]." In Cardoso, A. &amp; Wiggins, G. (Ed.) Proceedings of the 4th. International Joint Workshop on Computational Creativity, London, UK, 2007, pp. 91–98.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.abdn.ac.uk/ncs/departments/computing-science/standup-315.php STANDUP home page], with a link to free software download&lt;/ref&gt; The STANDUP generator was tested on children within the framework of analyzing its usability for language skills development for children with communication disabilities, e.g., because of [[cerebral palsy]]. (The project name is an acronym for "System To Augment Non-speakers' Dialog Using Puns" and an allusion to [[standup comedy]].) Children responded to this "language playground" with enthusiasm, and showed marked improvement on certain types of language tests.&lt;ref name=rmpwbd/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csd.abdn.ac.uk/research/standup/cuttings/20060819_www.thecourier.co.uk.html "Laughter is the best therapy"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610153820/http://www.csd.abdn.ac.uk/research/standup/cuttings/20060819_www.thecourier.co.uk.html |date=June 10, 2007 }}, ''The Courier'',  19 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/5276366.stm "Joke software helps non-speakers"], ''[[BBC News]],'' 22 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The two young people, who used the system over a ten-week period, regaled their peers, staff, family and neighbors with jokes such as: "What do you call a spicy missile? A hot shot!" Their joy and enthusiasm at entertaining others was inspirational.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Other===
[http://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2006/AAAI06-278.pdf Stock and Strapparava] described a program to generate funny [[acronym]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Stock, O. and Strapparava, C.

*(2005). "The act of creating humorous acronyms." ''Applied Artificial Intelligence'', 19(2):137–151.&lt;/ref&gt;

"AskTheBrain" (2002) [http://www.askthebrain.com/] used clustering and bayesian analysis to associate concepts in a comical way.

==Joke recognition==
A statistical machine learning algorithm to detect whether a sentence contained a "[[That's what she said]]" [[double entendre]] was developed by Kiddon and Brun (2011).&lt;ref&gt;Chloe Kiddon and Yuriy Brun (2011). "[http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P/P11/P11-2016.pdf That's What She Said: Double Entendre Identification."] In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 89–94, Portland, Oregon,
USA, June. Association for Computational Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt;  There is an open-source Python implementation of Kiddon &amp; Brun's TWSS system.&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/tansaku/twss GitHub – tansaku/twss: A Python project inspired by the research of Chloé Kiddon and Yuriy Brun. Part of the Funniest Computer Ever Open Source initiative&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

A program to recognize [[knock-knock joke]]s was reported by Taylor and Mazlack.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, J. M. and Mazlack, L. J. (2004). "Computationally recognizing wordplay in jokes". In ''Proceedings of Cognitive Science Conference'', pages 2166–2171, Stresa, Italy.&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of research is important in analysis of human-computer interaction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uc.edu/News/NR.aspx?ID=6139 "UC Researchers Design Humorous 'Bot'"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602033631/http://www.uc.edu/News/NR.aspx?ID=6139 |date=June 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An application of [[machine learning]] techniques for the distinguishing of joke texts from non-jokes was described by Mihalcea and Strapparava (2006).&lt;ref&gt;Mihalcea, R. and Strapparava, C. (2006). "Learning to laugh (automatically): Computational models
for humor recognition." ''[[Computational Intelligence (journal)|Computational Intelligence]]'', 22(2):126–142.&lt;/ref&gt;

Takizawa ''et al.'' (1996) reported on a [[heuristic]] program for detecting puns in the [[Japanese language]].&lt;ref&gt;Osamu Takizawa, Masuzo Yanagida, Akira Ito, and Hitoshi Isahara (1996). "On Computational Processing of Rhetorical Expressions – Puns, Ironies and Tautologies". In (Hulstijn and Nijholt, 1996), 39–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
A possible application for the assistance in [[language acquisition]] is described in the section "Pun generation". Another envisioned use of joke generators is in cases of steady supply of jokes where quantity is more important than quality. Another obvious, yet remote, direction is automated joke appreciation.

It is known {{citation needed|date=April 2015}} that humans interact with computers in ways similar to interacting with other humans that may be described in terms of personality, politeness, flattery, and in-group favoritism. Therefore, the role of humor in [[human-computer interaction]] is being investigated. In particular, humor generation in [[user interface]] to ease communications with computers was suggested.&lt;ref&gt;Rada Mihalcea, carlo Strapparava, "Technologies That Make You Smile: Adding Humor to Text-Based Applications", ''[[IEEE Intelligent Systems]]'', 2006, vol. 21, no.5, pp. 33–39.

'''Computer Arimaa''' refers to the playing of the [[board game]] [[Arimaa]] by [[computer program]]s.

In 2002, Indian American computer engineer Omar Syed published the rules to Arimaa and announced a $10,000 prize, available annually until 2020, for the first computer program (running on standard, off-the-shelf hardware) able to defeat each of three top-ranked human players in a three-game series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Syed|first=Omar|author2=Syed, Aamir|year=2003|title=Arimaa – a New Game Designed to be Difficult for Computers|journal=International Computer Games Association Journal|volume=26|pages=138–139}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prize was claimed in 2015, when a computer program played 7:2 against three human players.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kingpinchess.net/2015/07/arimaa-game-over/ Arimaa: Game Over?]&lt;/ref&gt; The game has been the subject of several [[#Research papers|research papers]].

==State space of Arimaa==

===Opening===
The number of different ways that each player can set up their pieces at the beginning of the game is:

&lt;math&gt;
\dbinom{16}{8} \cdot
\dbinom{8}{2}  \cdot
\dbinom{6}{2}  \cdot
\dbinom{4}{2}  \cdot
\dbinom{2}{1}  \cdot
\dbinom{1}{1} 
= 64,864,800
&lt;/math&gt;

The player can put 8 rabbits on 16 possible squares, followed by 2 cats on the 8 remaining squares, 2 dogs on the 6 remaining squares, 2 horses on the four remaining squares, one camel on one of the two remaining squares, and the elephant on the final unused square.

Because each player can start the game with one of 64,864,800 opening setups, the total state space for the opening is:

&lt;math&gt;
64,864,800^2 \approx      4.2 \cdot 10^{15}
&lt;/math&gt;

As Christ-Jan Cox said in his Master's thesis, because the number of possible initial states is so large, "[i]t follows that it is very difficult to develop complete databases of opening moves."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arimaa.com/arimaa/papers/CoxThesis/Cox_thesis1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artificial intelligence techniques==

===Material evaluation===
It is important for the computer to be able to evaluate the value of the pieces on the board so it can assess whether or not a capture or exchange would be desirable.  Assessing the relative value of pieces is an area of ongoing Arimaa research.  Some currently-used systems are DAPE and FAME.

===Techniques used in Arimaa bots===
The following techniques are used by some or all of the artificial intelligence programs that play Arimaa:
*[[Bitboard]]s
*[[Transposition table]]s
*[[Zobrist hashing]]
*[[Minimax#Minimax algorithm with alternate moves|Minimax]] and [[Alpha beta pruning]]
*[[Killer heuristic|Killer moves]] and [[Transposition table#Related techniques|refutation tables]]
*[[Static evaluation function]]
*[[Quiescence search]]
*[[Monte-Carlo Tree Search]]
*UCT

===Techniques rarely used In Arimaa bots===
*[[Chess opening book (computers)|Opening book]]
*[[Endgame tablebase]]

==Computer performance==

{{Refimprove section|date=March 2010}}
Several aspects of Arimaa make it difficult for computer programs to beat good human players. Because so much effort has gone into the development of strong [[computer chess|chess-playing software]], it is particularly relevant to understand why techniques applicable to chess are less effective for Arimaa.

=== Brute-force searching ===
Top chess programs use [[brute-force search]]ing coupled with static position evaluation dominated by material considerations. Chess programs examine many, many possible moves, but they are not good (compared to humans) at determining who is winning at the end of a series of moves unless one side has more pieces than the other. The same is true for Arimaa programs, but their results are not as good in practice.

When brute-force searching is applied to Arimaa, the depth of the search is limited by the huge number of options each player has on each turn. Computationally, the number of options a player has available to them governs the number of different paths play can go down. This is known as the [[branching factor]]. The average branching factor in a game of Chess is about 35,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gamedev.net/reference/articles/article1171.asp | title=Chess Programming Part IV: Basic Search | author=François Dominic Laramée | publisher=[[GameDev.net]] | accessdate=2007-05-01 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070514205121/http://www.gamedev.net/reference/articles/article1171.asp | archivedate=14 May 2007 | deadurl=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in Arimaa it is about 17,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://arimaa.janzert.com/bf_study/ | title=A Look at the Arimaa Branching Factor | author=Brian "Janzert" Haskin | work=janzert.com/ | accessdate=2009-11-25| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091107141949/http://arimaa.janzert.com/bf_study/| archivedate= 7 November 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These differing branching factors imply that a computer which can search to a depth of eight turns for each player in chess, can only search about three turns deep for each player in Arimaa:

&lt;math&gt;35^8 \approxeq 17000^3&lt;/math&gt;

=== Alpha-beta pruning ===
Brute force search depth, for chess software, is nearly doubled by [[alpha-beta pruning]], which allows the software to conclude that one move is better than another without examining every possible continuation of the weaker move. If the opponent can crush a certain move with one reply, it isn't necessary to examine other replies, which dramatically increases search speed. In Arimaa, however, the side to move switches only every four steps, which reduces the number of available cutoffs in a step-based search.

Furthermore, the usefulness of alpha-beta pruning is heavily dependent on the order in which moves are considered. Good moves must be considered before bad ones in order for the bad ones to be neglected. In particular, checking and capturing moves are key for pruning, because they are often much better than other moves. In Arimaa software the speedup provided by alpha-beta pruning is less, because captures are rarer. In rated games played on arimaa.com, only 3% of steps result in capture, compared to about 19% of chess moves that result in capture.

In most Arimaa positions, particularly toward the beginning of the game when the board is still crowded, a competent player can avoid losing any pieces within the next two turns. Compared to chess, Arimaa allows either player to delay captures for longer. Indeed, the median move number of the first capture in chess is turn 6, whereas in Arimaa it is turn 12. The struggle is initially more positional in Arimaa, and revolves around making captures unavoidable at some point in the future. This magnifies the importance of correctly judging who is gaining ground in non-material ways. Thus the strength of computer programs (examining millions of positions) is not as significant as their weakness (judging the position apart from who has more pieces).

The weakness of Arimaa programs in the opening phases is further magnified by the setup phase. In chess every game starts from the same position. By compiling before the game a list of stock replies to all standard opening moves, chess programs may often make a dozen or more excellent moves before starting to "think". Humans do the same, but have a smaller and less reliable memory of openings, which puts humans at a relative disadvantage in chess. Arimaa, in contrast, has millions of possible ways to set up the pieces even before the first piece moves. This prevents programs from having any meaningful opening book.

As the game progresses, exchanges and the advancement of rabbits tend to make the position more open and tactical. Arimaa programs typically play better in this sort of position, because they see tactical shots which humans overlook. However, it is usually possible for humans to avoid wide-open positions by conservative play, and to angle for strategic positions in which computers fare worse. Against a conservative opponent it is almost impossible to bust open the position in Arimaa, whereas in chess it is merely difficult. One must beat defensive play by the accumulation of small, long-term advantages, which programs do not do very well.

One additional technique from computer chess which does not apply to Arimaa is [[endgame tablebase]]s. Master-level chess games sometimes trade down into unclear endgames with only a few pieces, for example king and knight vs. king and rook. It is possible to build, by [[retrograde analysis]], an exhaustive table of the correct move in all such positions. Programs have only to consult a pre-generated table in such positions, rather than "thinking" afresh, which gives them a relative advantage over humans. Arimaa, in contrast, seldom comes to an endgame. Equal exchanges of pieces are less common than in chess, so it is rare for a game of Arimaa to "trade down" and still be unclear. An average game of Arimaa has only eight captures (compared to seventeen for chess), and top humans can often defeat top programs in Arimaa without losing a single piece, for example [http://arimaa.com/arimaa/games/jsShowGame.cgi?gid=298810&amp;s=w the second game of the 2014 Challenge match]. Another example of low capture density is [http://arimaa.com/arimaa/games/jsShowGame.cgi?gid=218654&amp;s=w this semifinal game of the 2012 World Championship], featuring only a single capture, a goal-forcing elephant sacrifice.

Omar Syed hopes that, because traditional artificial intelligence techniques are only moderately effective for Arimaa, programmers will be forced to use new artificial intelligence techniques to create a strong Arimaa-playing program. The successful quest to build a world-championship-caliber chess program has produced many techniques to successfully play games, but has contributed essentially nothing to more general reasoning; in fact, the techniques of chess playing programs have been excluded from some definitions of [[artificial intelligence]]; a goal for Arimaa is that the techniques involved in playing it will help the larger goals of artificial intelligence.

The structure of Syed's man-against-machine challenge is focused on rewarding advances in AI software and not advances in hardware. In the annual challenge, programs are run on machines chosen and provided by Syed himself, under the criterion that it be a typical, inexpensive, off-the-shelf home computer. The challenge would not be open to anyone requiring expensive multi-processor machines such as those used to challenge top-level chess players, much less something like the custom-built supercomputer [[IBM Deep Blue|Deep Blue]], even though it was the success of this hardware-intensive approach which inspired Arimaa's invention. Syed believes that even the computer used in the 2004 challenge match (a Pentium 4 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz system with 512 MB of RAM) had sufficient hardware to win the challenge prize if only it was running the proper software. Supercomputers might already have the power to conquer Arimaa by brute force using conventional AI software, and eventually personal computers will too, if hardware continues to advance at the current rate. This is why the Arimaa challenge prize is offered only until the year 2020.

==Comparing the Arimaa Challenge to chess challenges==
{{OR-section|date=April 2015}}
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}

It has been argued that a computer has beaten the world chess champion but not beaten the human in the Arimaa Challenge (until 2015) because of six reasons:

# Arimaa is a new game. Therefore, the number of programmers and amount of time devoted to computer Arimaa is much less than for computer chess. Computer chess had thousands more programmers and 40 more years than computer Arimaa. The later and smaller effort resulted in less and slower progress in computer Arimaa.
# The rules for the Arimaa Challenge required the computer to show a higher playing ability than the rules for the chess matches. &lt;!--&lt;ref&gt; [http://arimaa.com/arimaa/challenge/2009/ Rules to the Arimaa Challenge]&lt;/ref&gt; The rules don't even contain the word chess! Clearly this reference alone cannot be used.--&gt; In the Arimaa Challenge, the computer must beat three human players in three matches. In the chess matches, the computer must win one match against one human player.
# In the Arimaa Challenge, the computer needs to score 2/3 of the total points to win. In chess matches, the computer needs to score more than 1/2 of the total points to win.
# In the Arimaa Challenge, the computer needs to win a qualification match. Humans are allowed to study the computer's previous games to find the computer’s weaknesses. In chess, there is no qualification match and no requirement that the computer's previous games be made publicly available.{{dubious|date=November 2013}}
# In the Arimaa Challenge, the computer cannot be improved between games. In chess, the computer was improved between games.
# In the Arimaa Challenge, the rules reject powerful or custom-made computers priced over $1,000. However, a powerful custom-made computer beat the world chess champion.

However, the Arimaa community disputes this argument point by point. To the first point, Arimaa is a new game, so the playing community is still small and even the best players are not professional players and have only been playing the game for a few years. Thus the human players in the Arimaa Challenge are much weaker than the human players in the chess challenge. The weakness of human players should make the Arimaa Challenge easier to conquer than chess, which compensates developers for having studied the problem for a shorter time.

The remaining five points compare the Arimaa Challenge only to Kasparov vs. Deep Blue, ignoring all other man vs. machine chess matches in which computers have prevailed. The chess match which can most closely be compared to the Arimaa Challenge match is the [[Man vs Machine World Team Championship]]. In 2004 and 2005 a team of humans played against a team of computer opponents. In both years the computers won by wide margin. In 2005 all three humans lost, the computers won 2/3 of the total points, the chess engines were commercially available for the humans to study, and the machine hardware used was not a supercomputer, but rather comparable to hardware used in the Arimaa Challenge.

Man-vs.-machine chess matches since 2005 have shown increasing computer dominance. For example, the 2006 [[Vladimir Kramnik#Deep Fritz match|Deep Fritz vs. Vladimir Kramnik]] and 2007 Rybka vs. Jaan Ehlvest matches gave additional advantages to the human player, but the computers (running on commodity hardware) prevailed anyway.

==Resources for software developers==
The [http://arimaa.janzert.com/aei/ Arimaa Engine Interface], developed by Brian Haskin, defines a protocol that allows an Arimaa engine to communicate with a controller.

According to the documentation: "An engine is a program capable of taking the state of an Arimaa game and selecting a legal move to make. A controller is anything that wants to communicate with and control an engine. This could be anything from a simple script to have the engine analyse a single position to a GUI program that allows games to be played with humans or other engines."&lt;ref&gt;http://arimaa.janzert.com/aei/aei-protocol.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arimaa Engine Interface includes an implementation of an engine and controller, documentation, and various scripts to control the engine and play games on any website which supports the protocol, including the official Arimaa website.&lt;ref&gt;http://arimaa.janzert.com/aei/readme.txt&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://arimaa.com/arimaa/challenge/devBot.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[linguistics]], '''construction grammar''' groups a number of models of [[grammar]] that all subscribe to the idea that knowledge of a language is based on a collection of "form and function pairings". The "function" side covers what is commonly understood as ''meaning'', ''content'', or ''intent''; it usually extends over both conventional fields of [[semantics]] and [[pragmatics]].

Language users learn these pairings as individual, whole facts about language. These language facts are indexed to specific interactive contexts and/or linguistic practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fischer|first=Kerstin|date=December 2015|title=Conversation, Construction Grammar, and cognition|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/language-and-cognition/article/conversation-construction-grammar-and-cognition/F60C5CDB2335B915DD69D2C6E7A1C903|journal=Language and Cognition|language=en|volume=7|issue=4|pages=563–588|doi=10.1017/langcog.2015.23|issn=1866-9808}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may be associated in the mind of the language user with a highly particularized [[sociolect]], [[dialect]], pattern of [[jargon]], [[genre]],&lt;ref&gt;Michaelis, Laura A. and Hanbing Feng. 2015. What is this, Sarcastic Syntax? Constructions and Frames 7: 148–180&lt;/ref&gt; or register.

The guiding insight of '''construction grammar''' (often abbreviated '''CxG''') is that rules of syntactic combination are directly associated with interpretive and use conditions. All construction-based grammars allow units bigger than the word as semantic building blocks of syntax.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.stanford.edu/group/cslipublications/cslipublications/pdf/BoasSag-intro.pdf|title=Introducing Sign Based Construction Grammar|last=Boas, Hans|first=Ivan Sag and Paul Kay|date=2012|website=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example is the bipartite clausal pattern sometimes referred to as the Correlative Conditional construction, as found in the proverbial expression ''The bigger they come, the harder they fall'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sag|first=Ivan|date=2010|title=English Filler-Gap Constructions|url=|journal=Language|volume=86|pages=486-545|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fillmore|first=Charles|date=1986|title=Varieties of Conditional Sentences|url=|journal=Eastern States Conference on Linguistics|volume=3|pages=163-182|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Michaelis|first=Laura A.|date=1994-01-01|title=A Case of Constructional Polysemy in Latin|url=http://www.jbe-platform.com/content/journals/10.1075/sl.18.1.04mic|journal=Studies in Language|language=en|volume=18|issue=1|pages=45–70|doi=10.1075/sl.18.1.04mic|issn=0378-4177}}&lt;/ref&gt;; another is the Copula Doubling construction exemplified by ''The thing is, is you never really know'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/38263988/BrenierMichaelis.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1521475150&amp;Signature=TWAXUdE0zZ2GItL76IwBVILCcA8%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DOptimization_via_Syntactic_Amalgam_Synta.pdf|title=Optimization via syntactic amalgam: Syntax-prosody mismatch and copula doubling|last=Brenier, Jason|first=Laura Michaelis|date=2005|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In contrast to traditional compositional approaches to syntax, in which all conceptual content comes from the lexicon, and rules of syntactic combination do no more than determine which word sequences function as units for syntactic purposes, constructional approaches assume a continuum of idiomaticity (or generality) of expressions, from tightly bound idioms to fully productive patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Kay, Paul and Laura A. Michaelis. 2012. Constructional Meaning and Compositionality. In C. Maienborn, K. von Heusinger and P. Portner (eds.), Semantics: An International Handbook of Natural Language Meaning. Vol. 3. Berlin: de Gruyter. 2271-2296&lt;/ref&gt; This fundamental commitment unites all of the varieties of CxG, whether or not formal descriptive methods are used and whether the research program targets language development, second-language learning, typology, diachrony, language productions and comprehension, language evolution, conversational practice or social identity. Owing to its focus on descriptive precision, patterns of usage, grammaticalization and the structure of linguistic categories, CxG is closely linked to the explanatory frameworks of [[cognitive-functional linguistics]].

== History ==
Historically, the notion of construction grammar developed out of the ideas of "global rules" and "transderivational rules"{{example needed}} in [[generative semantics]], together with the generative semantic idea of a grammar as a constraint satisfaction system.
[[George Lakoff]]'s "Syntactic Amalgams" paper in 1974 (Chicago Linguistics Society, 1974) posed a challenge for the idea of transformational derivation.

Construction grammar was spurred on by the development of Cognitive Semantics, beginning in 1975 and extending through the 1980s. Lakoff's 1977 paper, Linguistic Gestalts (Chicago Linguistic Society, 1977) was an early version of CxG, arguing that the meaning of the whole was not a compositional function of the meaning of the parts put together locally. Instead, he suggested, constructions themselves must have meanings.

Construction grammar was developed in the 1980s by linguists such as [[Charles J. Fillmore|Charles Fillmore]], [[Paul Kay]], and George Lakoff. Construction grammar was developed in order to handle cases that intrinsically went beyond the capacity of [[generative grammar]].

The earliest study was "There-Constructions," which appeared as Case Study 3 in George Lakoff's ''[[Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Lakoff, George| title=Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things: What Categories Reveal about the Mind| location=Chicago | publisher=University of Chicago Press| year=1987 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It argued that the meaning of the whole was not a function of the meanings of the parts, that odd grammatical properties of [[Deictic]] There-constructions followed from the pragmatic meaning of the construction, and that variations on the central construction could be seen as simple extensions using form-meaning pairs of the central construction.

Fillmore et al.'s (1988) paper on the English ''let alone'' construction was a second classic. These two papers propelled cognitive linguists into the study of CxG.

== Grammatical construction ==
In construction grammar, like in general [[semiotics]], the [[grammatical construction]] is a pairing of form and content. The formal aspect of a construction is typically described as a [[syntax|syntactic]] template, but the form covers more than just syntax, as it also involves [[phonology|phonological]] aspects, such as [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] and [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]]. The content covers [[semantics|semantic]] as well as [[pragmatics|pragmatic]] meaning.

The semantic meaning of a grammatical construction is made up of conceptual structures postulated in [[cognitive semantics]]: [[Image schema|image-schema]]s, frames, conceptual metaphors, conceptual metonymies, prototypes of various kinds, mental spaces, and bindings across these (called "blends"). Pragmatics just becomes the cognitive semantics of communication—the modern version of the old [[John R. Ross|Ross]]-Lakoff performative hypothesis from the 1960s.

The form and content are [[symbolic relation|symbolically linked]] in the sense advocated by [[Ronald Langacker|Langacker]].

Thus a construction is treated like a [[Sign (semiotics)|sign]] in which all structural aspects are integrated parts and not distributed over different modules as they are in the [[componential model]]. Consequentially, not only constructions that are lexically fixed, like many idioms, but also more abstract ones like [[argument structure]] schemata, are pairings of form and conventionalized meaning. For instance, the [[ditransitive]] schema [S V IO DO] is said to express semantic content X CAUSES Y TO RECEIVE Z, just like ''kill'' means X CAUSES Y TO DIE.

In construction grammar, a grammatical construction, regardless of its formal or semantic complexity and make up, is a pairing of form and meaning. Thus words and word classes may be regarded as instances of constructions. Indeed, construction grammarians argue that all pairings of form and meaning are constructions, including phrase structures, [[idiom]]s, [[word]]s and even [[morpheme]]s.

== Syntax-lexicon continuum ==
Unlike the componential model, construction grammar denies any strict distinction between the two and proposes a ''syntax-lexicon continuum''. The argument goes that words and complex constructions are both pairs of form and meaning and differ only in internal symbolic complexity. Instead of being discrete modules and thus subject to very different processes they form the extremes of a continuum (from regular to idiosyncratic): syntax &gt; [[Subcategorization|subcategorization frame]] &gt; idiom &gt; [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] &gt;  [[syntactic category]] &gt; word/[[lexicon]] (these are the traditional terms; construction grammars use a different terminology).

== Grammar as an inventory of constructions ==
In construction grammar, the grammar of a language is made up of [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomic]] networks of families of constructions, which are based on the same principles as those of the conceptual categories known from [[cognitive linguistics]], such as inheritance, prototypicality, extensions, and multiple parenting.

Four different models are proposed in relation to how information is stored in the taxonomies:

#'''Full-entry model'''
#:In the full-entry model information is stored redundantly at all relevant levels in the taxonomy, which means that it operates, if at all, with minimal generalization.{{example needed}}
#:
#'''Usage-based model'''
#:The [[usage-based model]] is based on [[Inductive reasoning|inductive learning]], meaning that linguistic knowledge is acquired in a bottom-up manner through use. It allows for redundancy and generalizations, because the language user generalizes over recurring experiences of use.{{example needed}}
#:
#'''Default inheritance model'''
#:According to the default inheritance model, each network has a default central form-meaning pairing from which all instances inherit their features. It thus operates with a fairly high level of generalization, but does also allow for some redundancy in that it recognizes extensions of different types.{{example needed}}
#:
#'''Complete inheritance model'''
#:In the complete inheritance model, information is stored only once at the most superordinate level of the network. Instances at all other levels inherit features from the superordinate item. The complete inheritance does not allow for redundancy in the networks.{{example needed}}

===Shift towards usage-based model===
All four models are advocated by different construction grammarians, but since the late 1990s there has been a shift towards a general preference for the usage-based model.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} The shift towards the usage-based approach in construction grammar has inspired the development of several [[corpus linguistics|corpus]]-based methodologies of constructional analysis (for example, [[collostructional analysis]]).

== Synonymy and monotony ==
As construction grammar is based on schemas and taxonomies, it does not operate with dynamic rules of derivation. Rather, it is [[monotonic models of grammar|monotonic]].

Because construction grammar does not operate with surface derivations from underlying structures, it adheres to functionalist linguist [[Dwight Bolinger]]'s ''principle of no synonymy'', on which [[Adele Goldberg (linguist)|Adele Goldberg]] elaborates in her book.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book | author=Goldberg, Adele| title=Constructions: A construction grammar approach to argument structure| location=Chicago/London | publisher=University of Chicago Press| year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This means that construction grammarians argue, for instance, that active and passive versions of the same proposition are not derived from an underlying structure, but are instances of two different constructions. As constructions are pairings of form and meaning&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195396683.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780195396683-e-1|title=Construction Grammar|last=Hoffmann|first=Thomas|last2=Trousdale|first2=Graeme|date=2013-04-18|language=en|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195396683.013.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt;, active and passive versions of the same proposition are not synonymous, but display differences in content: in this case the pragmatic content.

== Some construction grammars ==
As mentioned above, Construction grammar is a "family" of theories rather than one unified theory. There are a number of formalized Construction grammar frameworks. Some of these are:

===Berkeley Construction Grammar===
Berkeley Construction Grammar (BCG: formerly also simply called Construction Grammar in upper case) focuses on the formal aspects of constructions and makes use of a unification-based framework for description of syntax, not unlike [[head-driven phrase structure grammar]]. Its proponents/developers include Charles Fillmore, Paul Kay, [[Laura Michaelis]], and to a certain extent [[Ivan Sag]]. Immanent within BCG works like Fillmore and Kay 1995&lt;ref&gt; Fillmore, Charles J. and Paul Kay. 1995. A Construction Grammar Coursebook. Unpublished ms, University of California, Berkeley.&lt;/ref&gt; and Michaelis and Ruppenhofer 2001&lt;ref&gt; Michaelis, L. A., &amp; Ruppenhofer, J. 2001. Beyond alternations: A constructional account of the applicative pattern in German. Stanford: CSLI Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; is the notion that phrasal representations—embedding relations—should not be used to represent combinatoric properties of lexemes or lexeme classes. For example, BCG abandons the traditional practice of using non-branching domination (NP over N' over N) to describe undetermined nominals that function as NPs, instead introducing a determination construction that requires ('asks for') a non-maximal nominal sister and a lexical 'maximality' feature for which plural and mass nouns are unmarked. BCG also offers a unification-based representation of 'argument structure' patterns as abstract verbal lexeme entries ('linking constructions'). These linking constructions include transitive, oblique goal and passive constructions. These constructions describe classes of verbs that combine with phrasal constructions like the VP construction but contain no phrasal information in themselves.

===Sign Based Construction Grammar===

In the mid-2000s, several of the developers of BCG, including Charles Fillmore, Paul Kay, Ivan Sag and Laura Michaelis, collaborated in an effort to improve the formal rigor of BCG and clarify its representational conventions. The result was Sign Based Construction Grammar (SBCG). SBCG&lt;ref&gt;Boas, H.C. and Sag, I.A. eds., 2012. Sign-based construction grammar (pp. xvi+-391). CSLI Publications/Center for the Study of Language and Information.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michaelis, L.A., 2009. Sign-based construction grammar. The Oxford handbook of linguistic analysis, pp.155-176.&lt;/ref&gt; is based on a multiple-inheritance hierarchy of typed feature structures. The most important type of feature structure in SBCG is the sign, with subtypes word, lexeme and phrase. The inclusion of phrase within the canon of signs marks a major departure from traditional syntactic thinking. In SBCG, phrasal signs are licensed by correspondence to the mother of some licit construct of the grammar. A construct is a local tree with signs at its nodes. Combinatorial constructions define classes of constructs. Lexical class constructions describe combinatoric and other properties common to a group of lexemes. Combinatorial constructions include both inflectional and derivational constructions. SBCG is both formal and generative; while cognitive-functional grammarians have often opposed their standards and practices to those of formal, generative grammarians, there is in fact no incompatibility between a formal, generative approach and a rich, broad-coverage, functionally based grammar. It simply happens that many formal, generative theories are descriptively inadequate grammars. SBCG is generative in a way that prevailing syntax-centered theories are not: its mechanisms are intended to represent all of the patterns of a given language, including idiomatic ones; there is no 'core' grammar in SBCG. SBCG a licensing-based theory, as opposed to one that freely generates syntactic combinations and uses general principles to bar illicit ones: a word, lexeme or phrase is well formed if and only if it is described by a lexeme or construction. Recent SBCG works have expanded on the lexicalist model of idiomatically combining expressions sketched out in Sag 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Sag, Ivan A. (2012) Sign-Based Construction Grammar: An informal synopsis, in H. C. Boas and I. A. Sag, (eds), Sign-Based Construction Grammar. Stanford: CSLI Publications). 69-202&lt;/ref&gt;

===Goldbergian/Lakovian construction grammar===
The type of construction grammar associated with linguists like Goldberg and Lakoff looks mainly at the external relations of [[grammatical construction|constructions]] and the structure of constructional networks. In terms of form and function, this type of construction grammar puts psychological plausibility as its highest desideratum. It emphasizes experimental results and parallels with general cognitive psychology. It also draws on certain principles of cognitive linguistics. In the Goldbergian strand, constructions interact with each other in a network via four inheritance relations: [[polysemy]] link, subpart link, metaphorical extension, and finally instance link.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Cognitive grammar===
Sometimes, Ronald Langacker's [[cognitive grammar]] framework is described as a type of construction grammar. Cognitive grammar deals mainly with the semantic content of constructions, and its central argument is that conceptual semantics is primary to the degree that form mirrors, or is motivated by, content. Langacker argues that even abstract grammatical units like [[part-of-speech]] classes are semantically motivated and involve certain conceptualizations.

===Radical construction grammar===
[[William A. Croft]]'s [[radical construction grammar]] is designed for [[linguistic typology|typological]] purposes and takes into account cross-linguistic factors. It deals mainly with the internal structure of constructions. Radical construction grammar is totally non-[[reductionism|reductionist]], and Croft argues that constructions are not derived from their parts, but that the parts are derived from the constructions they appear in. Thus, in radical construction grammar, constructions are likened to [[wikt:gestalt|Gestalt]]s. Radical construction grammar rejects the idea that syntactic categories, roles, and relations are universal and argues that they are not only language-specific, but also construction specific. Thus, there are no universals that make reference to formal categories, since formal categories are language- and construction-specific. The only universals are to be found in the patterns concerning the mapping of meaning onto form. Radical construction grammar rejects the notion of syntactic relations altogether and replaces them with semantic relations. Like Goldbergian/Lakovian construction grammar and cognitive grammar, radical construction grammar is closely related to cognitive linguistics, and like cognitive grammar, radical construction grammar appears to be based on the idea that form is semantically motivated.

===Embodied construction grammar===
Embodied construction grammar (ECG), which is being developed by the [http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/NTL/ Neural Theory of Language (NTL)] group at ICSI, UC Berkeley, and the University of Hawai{{okina}}i, particularly including Benjamin Bergen and Nancy Chang, adopts the basic constructionist definition of a grammatical construction, but emphasizes the relation of constructional semantic content to [[Embodied cognition|embodiment]] and [[sensorimotor rhythm|sensorimotor]] experiences. A central claim is that the content of all linguistic signs involves [[mental simulation]]s and is ultimately dependent on basic [[image schema]]s of the kind advocated by [[Mark Johnson (professor)|Mark Johnson]] and George Lakoff, and so ECG aligns itself with cognitive linguistics. Like construction grammar, embodied construction grammar makes use of a [[unification-based]] model of representation. A non-technical introduction to the NTL theory behind embodied construction grammar as well as the theory itself and a variety of applications can be found in Jerome Feldman's ''From Molecule to Metaphor: A Neural Theory of Language'' (MIT Press, 2006).

===Fluid construction grammar===
[[Fluid construction grammar]] (FCG) was designed by [[Luc Steels]] and his collaborators for doing experiments on [http://www.fcg-net.org the origins and evolution of language].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor=Steels, Luc| title=Design Patterns in Fluid Construction Grammar| location=Amsterdam | publisher=John Benjamins| year=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor=Steels, Luc| title=Computational Issues in Fluid Construction Grammar| location=Heidelberg | publisher=Springer| year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; FCG is a fully operational and computationally implemented formalism for construction grammars and proposes a uniform mechanism for parsing and production. Moreover, it has been demonstrated through robotic experiments that FCG grammars can be grounded in embodiment and sensorimotor experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Steels, Luc |editor2=Hild, Manfred | title=Language Grounding in Robots| location=New York | publisher=Springer| year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; FCG integrates many notions from contemporary [[computational linguistics]] such as [[feature structure]]s and unification-based language processing. Constructions are considered bidirectional and hence usable both for parsing and production. Processing is flexible in the sense that it can even cope with partially ungrammatical or incomplete sentences. FCG is called 'fluid' because it acknowledges the premise that language users constantly change and update their grammars. The research on FCG is conducted at [http://csl.sony.fr Sony CSL Paris] and the AI Lab at the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]].

===Others===
In addition there are several construction grammarians who operate within the general framework of construction grammar without affiliating themselves with any specific construction grammar program. There is a growing interest in the [[Synchrony and diachrony|diachronic]] aspect of grammatical constructions and thus in the importation of methods and ideas from [[grammaticalization]] studies. Another area of growing interest is the [[pragmatics]] of [[pragmatic constructions]]. This is probably one of the reasons why the usage-based model is gaining popularity among construction grammarians. Another area of increasing interest among construction grammarians is that of [[language acquisition]] which is mainly due to [[Michael Tomasello]]'s work. [[Mats Andrén]] coined the term [[multimodal constructions]] to account for constructions that incorporate both (conventionalized) gesture and speech.

'''Crowdreviewing''' is the practice of gathering opinion or feedback from a large number of people, typically via the internet or an online community; a [[portmanteau]] of “crowd” and “reviews”. Crowdreviewing is also often viewed as a form of crowd voting which occurs when a website gathers a large group's opinions and judgment.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite news|title=IEM Demonstrates the Political Wisdom of Crowds |first=John |last=Robson |url=http://tippie.uiowa.edu/iem/media/story.cfm?id=2793 |newspaper=Canoe.ca |date=February 24, 2012 |accessdate=March 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is based on the principles of  [[crowdsourcing]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;and lets users submit online reviews to participate in building online metrics that measure performance. By harnessing social collaboration in the form of feedback individuals are generally able to form a more informed opinion.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Crowdreviews: Today’s Word of Mouth - Search Marketing Standard Magazine {{!}} Covering Search Engines|url = http://www.searchmarketingstandard.com/crowdreviews-todays-word-mouth|website = www.searchmarketingstandard.com|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Crowdreviews |url = http://www.crowdreviews.com/frequently-asked-questions#what-is-crowdreviewing|website = www.crowdreviews.com|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Article - CrowdReviews.com takes lead as a top reputation tool - sourced from the crowd by visibility|publisher=Visibility Magazine|url = http://www.visibilitymagazine.com/crowdreviews-com-takes-lead-as-a-top-reputation-tool-sourced-from-the-crowd/|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Crowdsourced Performance Review: How to Use the Power of Social Recognition to Transform Employee Performance|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=F0qsK46nSA0C|publisher = McGraw Hill Professional|date = 2013-05-31|isbn = 9780071817998|first = Eric|last = Mosley}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Information Systems and Technology for Organizational Agility, Intelligence, and Resilience|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=lw6XBQAAQBAJ|publisher = IGI Global|date = 2014-04-30|isbn = 9781466659711|first = Rahman|last=Hakikur}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of the crowd==
In crowdreviewing the crowd becomes the source of information used in determining the relative performance of products and services.&lt;ref name="Safire"&gt;{{cite news|last= Safire | first= William | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/08/magazine/08wwln-safire-t.html?_r=3&amp;ref=magazine&amp; | title= On Language | publisher= New York Times Magazine | date= February 5, 2009 | accessdate= May 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As crowdreviewing focuses on receiving input from a large number of parties, the resulting collaboration produces more credible feedback compared to the feedback left by a single party. The responsibility of identifying strengths and weaknesses falls to multiple individuals which each have had their own experience rather than on a single individual. Buyers will therefore be more likely to trust the feedback of a collective group of people rather than a single individual.&lt;ref name="estelles"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Estellés-Arolas | first1 = Enrique | last2 = González-Ladrón-de-Guevara | first2 = Fernando | title = Towards an Integrated Crowdsourcing Definition | journal = Journal of Information Science | volume = 38 | issue = 2 | year = 2012 | pages = 189–200 | url = http://www.crowdsourcing-blog.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Towards-an-integrated-crowdsourcing-definition-Estell%C3%A9s-Gonz%C3%A1lez.pdf| format=PDF | doi=10.1177/0165551512437638}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = wired2007&gt;

== Common Parties ==
The crowd consists of a number of different parties which have various interests in regards to the outcome produced.&lt;ref name="Prpić, J 2015"&gt;{{cite book|last=Prpić| first=J|author2=Shukla, P. |author3=Roth, Y. |author4=Lemoine, J.F. |year=2015 |chapter=A Geography of Participation in IT-Mediated Crowds |title=Proceedings of the Hawaii International Conference on Systems Sciences 2015.|ssrn=2494537|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Potential Customers ===
A potential customer of a product or service would have an interest in viewing information on how a particular product or service stands in terms of subjective or objective quality before making a purchasing decision.

=== Customers ===
Customers of products and services are a primary party in the process of reviewing. Customers are closely connected to the process as they would have first-hand experience with a product and service. Their primary role would be detailing their experiences with the product or service. A customer’s interest in crowdreviewing would stem from an interest in showing their appreciation towards the quality of a product or service or in voicing their concerns or disappointment in a product or service.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Sellers ===
Sellers usually get their satisfied customers involved in leaving reviews for their products and services. A seller has an interest in having positive feedback on display as a means to influence potential buyers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bracken, D.W., Rose, D.S. (2011) "When does 360-degree Feedback create behavior change? And How would we know when it does?"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Competitors ===
Competitors would have an interest in reviewing feedback from the crowd as a means of obtaining competitive intelligence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

There may be other audiences involved in the process such as employees, suppliers, partners, and other relevant parties.&lt;ref name="Britt"&gt;{{cite web |title = Crowdsourcing: The Debate Roars On |url= http://insite.artinstitutes.edu/crowdsourcing-the-debate-roars-on-39739.aspx | first= Darice|last= Britt | accessdate= 2015-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits and risks ==
There are a number of benefits to the different parties which make up the crowd. Potential buyers are able to obtain information on products and services prior to making a purchase. Those which have already bought or used the product or service are able to post experiences both positive and negative in order to inform other potential buyers. As an additional benefit to the buyers, buyers may also post negative reviews in hopes of resolving their negative experiences with their seller. Sellers have the benefits of receiving positive feedback and also potentially resolving issues with dissatisfied customers. Competitors are able to learn more about what their competition is doing in order to improve their own products and services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burnap|first1=Alex|last2=Ren|first2=Alex J.|last3=Papazoglou|first3=Giannis|last4=Gerth|first4=Richard|last5=Gonzalez|first5=Richard|last6=Papalambros|first6=Panos|title=When Crowdsourcing Fails: A Study of Expertise on Crowdsourced Design Evaluation|format=PDF |url= http://ode.engin.umich.edu/publications/PapalambrosPapers/2015/316J.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aitamurto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/963662/The_Promise_of_Idea_Crowdsourcing_Benefits_Contexts_Limitations |title=The Promise of Idea Crowdsourcing: Benefits, Contexts, Limitations &amp;#124; Tanja Aitamurto |publisher=Academia.edu |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ipeirotis2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ipeirotis |last2 = Provost |last3=Wang |year=2010 |title=Quality Management on Amazon Mechanical Turk |format=PDF |url= http://people.stern.nyu.edu/panos/publications/hcomp2010.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the benefits associated with crowdreviewing, there are a number of risks and challenges to overcome. For potential buyers there is always the risk that reviews may be sourced by the vendors themselves or other parties paid to leave a specific type of feedback on a product or service. Sellers have the possibility of receiving negative reviews which may in turn negatively influence their reputation and affect their bottom line revenue numbers. Competitors, while enjoying the benefit of being able to learn from their competitors are also subject to their competitors learning about their positives and negatives.&lt;ref name="aitamurto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Woods"&gt;{{cite news |title = The Myth of Crowdsourcing |url= https://www.forbes.com/2009/09/28/crowdsourcing-enterprise-innovation-technology-cio-network-jargonspy.html | first= Dan |last=Woods | date=28 September 2009 | accessdate= 2012-12-04 | work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations and controversies ==

=== Size of the Crowd ===
One of the major factors influencing crowdreviewing is the size of the crowd involved. A crowdreviewing venture is positively influenced by having a large number of parties leave reviews and feedback on products and services. In cases where a small number of individuals leave their feedback, more weight is placed on an individual reviewer or opinion and could therefore be of minimal value to potential customers. A smaller sample of reviews may also exhibit bias towards or against the product or service.&lt;ref name="Borst"&gt;{{cite web |title = The Case For and Against Crowdsourcing: Part 2 |url= http://www.crowdsourcing.org/editorial/the-case-for-and-against-crowdsourcing-part-2/2850 | first= Irma |last= Borst | accessdate= 2015-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Industry Knowledge ===
A common limitation of allowing all parties to have an opportunity to review a product or service may involve having reviews written without a minimal or meaningful understanding of the product or service. A lack of industry or specialized knowledge may in turn minimize the value of a review or potentially inversely affect what would be considered a fair review.&lt;ref name="Borst" /&gt;

=== Seller Manipulation ===
With allowing multiple parties to review a product or service there is a possibility that a seller may attempt to manipulate reviews in a number of ways. Sellers may hire third parties or create fake identities in order to leave positive reviews on their product or service. They may also do the same to create negative reviews on competing products and services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Ipeirotis |year=2010 |title= Analyzing the Amazon Mechanical Turk Marketplace |journal=XRDS: Crossroads, The ACM Magazine for Students |volume=17 |issue=2 |publisher = ACM |url=http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/1870000/1869094/p16-ipeirotis.pdf?ip=128.237.228.168&amp;acc=OPEN&amp;CFID=67955182&amp;CFTOKEN=99801176&amp;__acm__=1330412802_d8ed25958879e894447fe2c38fb1cf1a |format=PDF| accessdate=February 26, 2012|doi=10.1145/1870000/1869094}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Balance of Negative and Positive Reviews ===
Customers which have a negative experience with a product or service are more likely to offer a their review in an effort to resolve buyer’s remorse in comparison to those which have had a positive experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kurve|first1=Aditya|last2=Miller|first2=David J.|last3=Kesidis|first3=George|title=Multicategory Crowdsourcing Accounting for Variable Task Difficulty, Worker Skill, and Worker Intention|journal=IEEE KDE|date=30 May 2014|issue=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== One Side of the Story ===
Those reading reviews on products and services are likely to view reviews which only tell one side to the story. This is a disadvantage to both a potential customer and seller as the review may not tell the other side of a story which may be based on a misunderstanding.&lt;ref name="Britt2"&gt;{{cite web |title = Crowdsourcing: The Debate Roars On |url= http://insite.artinstitutes.edu/crowdsourcing-the-debate-roars-on-39739.aspx | first= Darice|last= Britt | accessdate= 2012-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CyberPatriot''' is the National Youth Cyber Education Program created to help direct students toward careers in [[cybersecurity]] or other science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. The program, created by the [[Air Force Association]] (AFA), features the National Youth Cyber Defense Competition for high school and middle school students.

Now in its eleventh season, CyberPatriot XI is open to all high schools, middle schools, and accredited home school programs around the country. [[JROTC]] units of all Services, [[Civil Air Patrol]] squadrons, and [[Naval Sea Cadet Corps]] divisions may also participate in the competition.  Outside of the regular competition, CyberPatriot also hosts two additional sub-programs: Summer CyberCamps&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uscyberpatriot.org/special-initiatives/afa-cybercamp-program/program-overview|title=2018 AFA CyberCamp Program Overview|website=www.uscyberpatriot.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an Elementary School Cyber Education Initiative&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uscyberpatriot.org/special-initiatives/afa-cybercamp-program/standard-afa-cybercamp-information|title=Standard AFA CyberCamp Information|website=www.uscyberpatriot.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The [[Northrop Grumman]] Foundation is the presenting sponsor. A spin off program is run in the UK called [[Cyber Centurion]].

==History==
CyberPatriot began in 2009 as a proof of concept demonstration at AFA’s Air Warfare Symposium in Orlando, Florida. Nine high school [[Civil Air Patrol]] squadrons competed.  The second phase of the program was limited to Air Force [[JROTC|AFJROTC]] and Civil Air Patrol teams. Online training and qualification competitions were held during fall 2009 with nearly 200 teams from 44 states competing for eight slots to the in-person National Finals Competition in February 2010, held in Orlando, Florida. The final phase of the developmental program, full national deployment, is now underway. Over 1,500 teams from all 50 states, Canada, and DoD Dependant schools overseas competed in CyberPatriot VI. CyberPatriot VII began in October 2014, with over 2,100 teams registered to compete. A new division, the Middle School Division, has been added this season. CyberPatriot IX, started in October 2016, featured over 4,300 registered teams.

==Goals and objectives==

CyberPatriot, is designed to be accessible to any high school or middle school student, provides a path from high school to college and the workforce, and benefits all CyberPatriot partners and our nation. The program increases the awareness of cybersecurity by delivering a basic cybersecurity education in a competitive format that enhances leadership, communication, and cooperation skills among its competitors.

==Organization and preparation==

Teams have the following members:
* Coach: Supervises, chaperones team. Usually a teacher. Does not need to have a technical background.  
* Competitors: 2-6 students (5 competitors, 1 alternate)
* Technical Mentor (Optional):  Particularly useful when coach is not cyber-savvy. Helps teach cyber concepts.
* Team Assistant (Optional): Assistants Coach with daily administrative tasks related to the competition

Each team is required to have a registered Coach and registered Competitors. Coach registration begins in the late spring to allow preparation over the summer. The qualification rounds of the competition are completed online at the teams’ home locations from September to early January.

== Competition guidelines ==
The competition is a tournament structure with three divisions:
# Open High School Division:  Open to all public, private, parochial, magnet, charter, home schools, and special groups such as CampFire, Boys &amp; Girls Club, Boy Scouts, Church Youth Groups, Girl Scouts, etc.
# All-Service Division: Open to all JROTC Services, Civil Air Patrol squadrons, US Naval Sea Cadet Corps units. The registration fee is waived for teams competing in the All-Service Division
# Middle School Division: Open to all middle schools and junior high schools which follow the same common organizations as mentioned above in the Open High School Division.

The early rounds of the competition are done online during weekends via the Internet from teams’ schools or other sponsoring organizations’ facilities. Prior to the round, teams download virtual image representations of operating systems with known flaws, or cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Each team is tasked to find the flaws while keeping specified computer functions (services such as email) working. Team progress is recorded by a central CyberPatriot scoring system.

The scores from Qualification Rounds 1 and 2 are totaled to determine which tier a team advances to:

*Platinum: Top 30% of teams. Rounds include State (guaranteed), Semifinals, and National Finals
*Gold: Middle 40% of teams. Rounds include State (guaranteed) and Semifinals.
*Silver: Bottom 30% of teams. Rounds include State (guaranteed) and Semifinals.

Teams in the Platinum tier are the only teams eligible to qualify for National Finals.

See additional rules below:

* The Qualification Competition begins as soon as this image is opened, and ends 6 consecutive hours later, after which the score will be logged. Attempting to continue after the time limit has reached will incur penalties. It is the coach's responsibility to ensure their team does not exceed the limit.
* Only one instance of the image can be open at any given time. Opening multiple instance of a virtual image will result in a penalty.
* No person may compete on a team with which they are not registered, and may only be registered with one team per competition.
* During the competition, no outside assistance may be given to or received from anyone.
* No competitor may offer assistance to another after their round ends and the others begins.
* No outside communication is allowed during the competition. This includes but is not limited to verbal, electronic, written or coded.
* No offensive activity of any kind is permitted, including but not limited to hacking through programs or manual code injection, interfering with another team through social engineering and/or deception, or attaining the opposing machine.

==National Finals Competition==

The top scoring Semifinal teams from each division, approximately 28 teams, are invited (all-expenses paid) to the in-person National Finals Competition each spring.  For CyberPatriot IV - VII, National Finals Competitions was held at the Gaylord National Hotel and Convention Center in National Harbor, Maryland. Beginning the CyberPatriot VIII season, the National Finals Competitions moved to the Hyatt Regency in Inner Harbor, Baltimore, Maryland.

The Challenges that teams may face include:

# Network Security Master Challenge, in which teams fix vulnerabilities in "images" of Operating Systems that have been purposely tampered with while protecting the "images" from "Red Team" which is a group of "hackers" that will unfix vulnerabilities and mess with the competitors.
# Leidos Digital Forensics Challenge, in which teams solve mysteries with computer programs.
# Digital Crime Scene Challenge, in which teams search a live "crime scene" for digital evidence.
# Cisco Networking Challenge, in which teams show their knowledge about Wiring, Cisco's Packet Tracer, and in a Cisco quiz.

Winning teams in the Open and All Service Division earn education grants to the school of their choice. First place teams earn $2,000 per competitor, second place teams earn $1,500 per competitor, and third place earns $1,000 per competitor. The scholarship money is provided by Northrop Grumman Corp. In CyberPatriot VII, for first, second, and third place, an additional $2,000, $1,500, and $1,000 were awarded to the teams, respectively, by the National Security Agency.

As a subfield in [[artificial intelligence]], '''Diagnosis''' is concerned with the development of algorithms and techniques that are able to determine whether the behaviour of a system is correct.  If the system is not functioning correctly, the algorithm should be able to determine, as accurately as possible, which part of the system is failing, and which kind of fault it is facing.  The computation is based on ''observations'', which provide information on the current behaviour.

The expression ''diagnosis'' also refers to the answer of the question of whether the system is malfunctioning or not, and to the process of computing the answer.  This word comes from the medical context where a [[diagnosis]] is the process of identifying a disease by its symptoms.

==Example==

An example of diagnosis is the process of a garage mechanic with an automobile.  The mechanic will first try to detect any abnormal behavior based on the observations on the car and his knowledge of this type of vehicle.  If he finds out that the behavior is abnormal, the mechanic will try to refine his diagnosis by using new observations and possibly testing the system, until he discovers the faulty component; the mechanic plays an important role in the vehicle diagnosis.

==Expert diagnosis==

The expert diagnosis (or diagnosis by [[expert system]]) is based on experience with the system.  Using this experience, a mapping is built that efficiently associates the observations to the corresponding diagnoses.

The experience can be provided:
* By a human operator.  In this case, the human knowledge must be translated into a computer language. 
* By examples of the system behaviour.  In this case, the examples must be classified as correct or faulty (and, in the latter case, by the type of fault).  [[Machine learning]] methods are then used to generalize from the examples.

The main drawbacks of these methods are:
* The difficulty acquiring the expertise.  The expertise is typically only available after a long period of use of the system (or similar systems). Thus, these methods are unsuitable for safety- or mission-critical systems (such as a nuclear power plant, or a robot operating in space).  Moreover, the acquired expert knowledge can never be guaranteed to be complete.  In case a previously unseen behaviour occurs, leading to an unexpected observation, it is impossible to give a diagnosis.
* The [[complexity]] of the learning.  The off-line process of building an expert system can require a large amount of time and computer memory.
* The size of the final expert system.  As the expert system aims to map any observation to a diagnosis, it will in some cases require a huge amount of storage space.
* The lack of [[wikt:robust|robustness]]. If even a small modification is made on the system, the process of constructing the expert system must be repeated.

A slightly different approach is to build an expert system from a model of the system rather than directly from an expertise.  An example is the computation of a [[Diagnoser (Sampath)|diagnoser]] for the diagnosis of [[discrete event systems]].  This approach can be seen as model-based, but it benefits from some advantages and suffers some drawbacks of the expert system approach.

==Model-based diagnosis==

Model-based diagnosis is an example of [[abductive reasoning]] using a [[model (abstract)|model]] of the system.  In general, it works as follows:

[[File:principle-diagnosis.png|600px|center|Principle of the model-based diagnosis]]

We have a model that describes the behaviour of the system (or artefact).  The model is an abstraction of the behaviour of the system and can be incomplete.  In particular, the faulty behaviour is generally little-known, and the faulty model may thus not be represented.  Given observations of the system, the diagnosis system simulates the system using the model, and compares the observations actually made to the observations predicted by the simulation.

The modelling can be simplified by the following rules (where &lt;math&gt;Ab\,&lt;/math&gt; is the ''Ab''normal predicate):

&lt;math&gt;\neg Ab(S) \Rightarrow Int1 \wedge Obs1&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;Ab(S) \Rightarrow Int2 \wedge Obs2&lt;/math&gt; (fault model)

The semantics of these formulae is the following: if the behaviour of the system is not abnormal (i.e. if it is normal), then the internal (unobservable) behaviour will be &lt;math&gt;Int1\,&lt;/math&gt; and the observable behaviour &lt;math&gt;Obs1\,&lt;/math&gt;.  Otherwise, the internal behaviour will be &lt;math&gt;Int2\,&lt;/math&gt; and the observable behaviour &lt;math&gt;Obs2\,&lt;/math&gt;.  Given the observations &lt;math&gt;Obs\,&lt;/math&gt;, the problem is to determine whether the system behaviour is normal or not (&lt;math&gt;\neg Ab(S)\,&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;Ab(S)\,&lt;/math&gt;).  This is an example of [[abductive reasoning]].

==Diagnosability==

A system is said to be '''diagnosable''' if whatever the behavior of the system, we will be able to determine without ambiguity a unique diagnosis.

The problem of diagnosability is very important when designing a system because on one hand one may want to reduce the number of sensors to reduce the cost, and on the other hand one may want to increase the number of sensors to increase the probability of detecting a faulty behavior.

Several algorithms for dealing with these problems exist. One class of algorithms answers the question whether a system is diagnosable; another class looks for sets of sensors that make the system diagnosable, and optionally comply to criteria such as cost optimization.

The diagnosability of a system is generally computed from the model of the system. In applications using model-based diagnosis, such a model is already present and doesn't need to be built from scratch.

[[File:DHCOM Computer On Module - AM35x.jpg|thumb|right|An ''embedded system'' on a plug-in card with processor, memory, power supply, and external interfaces]]

An '''embedded system''' is a [[RTOS|programmed controlling and operating system]] with a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electrical system, often with [[real-time computing]] constraints.&lt;ref name="Barr-glossary"&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Barr|title=Embedded Systems Glossary|work=Neutrino Technical Library|accessdate=2007-04-21|url=http://www.netrino.com/Embedded-Systems/Glossary|authorlink=Michael Barr (software engineer)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heath|first=Steve |title=Embedded systems design|publisher=Newnes|year=2003|edition=2|series=EDN series for design engineers|page=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BjNZXwH7HlkC&amp;pg=PA2|quote= An embedded system is a [[microprocessor]] based system that is built to control a function or a range of functions. | ISBN=978-0-7506-5546-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is ''embedded'' as part of a complete device often including hardware and mechanical parts. Embedded systems control many devices in common use today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Michael Barr|author2=Anthony J. Massa|title=Programming embedded systems: with C and GNU development tools|publisher=O'Reilly|year=2006|pages=1–2|chapter=Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nPZaPJrw_L0C&amp;pg=PA1 | ISBN=978-0-596-00983-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ninety-eight percent of all [[microprocessor]]s are manufactured components of embedded systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Real men program in C | last=Barr |first=Michael | page=2 | date=1 August 2009 | work=Embedded Systems Design | publisher=TechInsights (United Business Media) | url=http://www.embedded.com/electronics-blogs/barr-code/4027479/Real-men-program-in-C | accessdate=2009-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of properties of typical embedded computers when compared with general-purpose counterparts are low power consumption, small size, rugged operating ranges, and low per-unit cost. This comes at the price of limited processing resources, which make them significantly more difficult to program and to interact with. However, by building intelligence mechanisms on top of the hardware, taking advantage of possible existing sensors and the existence of a network of embedded units, one can both optimally manage available resources at the unit and network levels as well as provide augmented functions, well beyond those available.&lt;ref name="Alippi2014"&gt;C.Alippi: ''Intelligence for Embedded Systems.'' Springer, 2014, 283pp, {{ISBN|978-3-319-05278-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, intelligent techniques can be designed to manage power consumption of embedded systems.&lt;ref&gt;S. Mittal, "[https://www.academia.edu/4186102/A_survey_of_techniques_for_improving_energy_efficiency_in_embedded_computing_systems A survey of techniques for improving energy efficiency in embedded computing systems]", IJCAET, 6(4), 440–459, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern embedded systems are often based on [[microcontroller]]s (i.e. CPUs with integrated memory or peripheral interfaces),&lt;ref name="micro controller"&gt;{{cite web|first=Bill |last=Giovino|title=Micro controller.com – Embedded Systems supersite|url=http://www.microcontroller.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; but ordinary microprocessors (using external chips for memory and peripheral interface circuits) are also common, especially in more complex systems. In either case, the processor(s) used may be types ranging from general purpose to those specialized in certain class of computations, or even custom designed for the application at hand. A common standard class of dedicated processors is the [[digital signal processor]] (DSP).

Since the embedded system is dedicated to specific tasks, design engineers can optimize it to reduce the size and cost of the product and increase the reliability and performance. Some embedded systems are mass-produced, benefiting from [[economies of scale]].

Embedded systems range from portable devices such as [[digital watch]]es and [[Digital audio player|MP3 players]], to large stationary installations like [[traffic light]]s, [[Programmable logic controller|factory controllers]], and largely complex systems like [[hybrid vehicles]], [[MRI]], and [[avionics]]. Complexity varies from low, with a single [[microcontroller]] chip, to very high with multiple units, [[peripheral]]s and networks mounted inside a large [[chassis]] or enclosure.

==History==
One of the very first recognizably modern embedded systems was the [[Apollo Guidance Computer]],{{cn|reason=linked article claims it is the first IC-based computer. nothing there supports it being the first embedded system.|date=August 2018}} developed ca. 1965 by [[Charles Stark Draper]] at the [[MIT Instrumentation Laboratory]]. At the project's inception, the Apollo guidance computer was considered the riskiest item in the Apollo project as it employed the then newly developed monolithic integrated circuits to reduce the size and weight. An early mass-produced embedded system was the [[D-17B|Autonetics D-17 guidance computer]] for the [[Minuteman (missile)|Minuteman missile]], released in 1961. When the Minuteman II went into production in 1966, the D-17 was replaced with a new computer that was the first high-volume use of integrated circuits.

Since these early applications in the 1960s, embedded systems have come down in price and there has been a dramatic rise in processing power and functionality. An early [[microprocessor]] for example , the [[Intel 4004]] (released in 1971), was designed for [[calculator]]s and other small systems but still required external memory and support chips. In 1978 National Engineering Manufacturers Association released a "standard" for programmable microcontrollers, including almost any computer-based controllers, such as single board computers, numerical, and event-based controllers.

As the cost of microprocessors and microcontrollers fell it became feasible to replace expensive knob-based [[analog electronics|analog]] components such as [[potentiometer]]s and [[variable capacitor]]s with up/down buttons or knobs read out by a microprocessor even in consumer products. By the early 1980s, memory, input and output system components had been integrated into the same chip as the processor forming a [[microcontroller]]. Microcontrollers find applications where a general-purpose computer would be too costly.

A comparatively low-cost microcontroller may be programmed to fulfill the same role as a large number of separate components. Although in this context an embedded system is usually more complex than a traditional solution, most of the complexity is contained within the microcontroller itself. Very few additional components may be needed and most of the design effort is in the software. Software prototype and test can be quicker compared with the design and construction of a new circuit not using an embedded processor.

==Applications==
[[File:Accupoll-embedded-computer.jpg|thumb|Embedded Computer Sub-Assembly for Accupoll Electronic Voting Machine&lt;ref&gt;[http://w2.eff.org/Activism/E-voting/infosheets2006/AccuPollAVS1000.pdf Electronic Voting Machine Information Sheet Accupoll AVS 1000 ]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Embedded systems are commonly found in consumer, cooking, industrial, automotive, medical, commercial and military applications.

Telecommunications systems employ numerous embedded systems from [[telephone switch]]es for the network to [[cell phone]]s at the end user.
Computer networking uses dedicated [[Router (computing)|routers]] and [[network bridge]]s to route data.

[[Consumer electronics]] include [[MP3 player]]s, mobile phones, [[video game console]]s, [[digital camera]]s, [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] receivers, and [[computer printer|printers]].
Household appliances, such as [[microwave oven]]s, [[washing machine]]s and [[dishwashers]], include embedded systems to provide flexibility, efficiency and features. Advanced [[HVAC]] systems use networked [[thermostat]]s to more accurately and efficiently control temperature that can change by time of day and [[season]]. [[Home automation]] uses wired- and wireless-networking that can be used to control lights, climate, security, audio/visual, surveillance, etc., all of which use embedded devices for sensing and controlling.

Transportation systems from flight to automobiles increasingly use embedded systems.
New airplanes contain advanced [[avionics]] such as [[inertial guidance system]]s and [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] receivers that also have considerable safety requirements.
Various electric motors — [[brushless DC motor]]s, [[induction motor]]s and [[DC motor]]s — use electric/electronic [[motor controller]]s.
[[Automobile]]s, [[electric vehicle]]s, and [[hybrid vehicle]]s increasingly use embedded systems to maximize efficiency and reduce pollution.
Other automotive safety systems include [[anti-lock braking system]] (ABS), [[Electronic Stability Control]] (ESC/ESP), [[Traction control system|traction control]] (TCS) and automatic [[four-wheel drive]].

[[Medical equipment]] uses embedded systems for [[vital signs]] monitoring, [[electronic stethoscope]]s for amplifying sounds, and various [[medical imaging]] ([[Positron emission tomography|PET]], [[Single photon emission computed tomography|SPECT]], [[Computed tomography|CT]], and [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]]) for non-invasive internal inspections. Embedded systems within medical equipment are often powered by industrial computers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.dell.com/us/en/enterprise/oem-industry-solutions-build-your-product-with-dell Embedded Systems Dell OEM Solutions | Dell]. Content.dell.com (2011-01-04). Retrieved on 2013-02-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

Embedded systems are used in transportation, fire safety, safety and security, medical applications and life critical systems, as these systems can be isolated from hacking and thus, be more reliable, unless connected to wired or wireless networks via on-chip 3G cellular or other methods for IoT monitoring and control purposes.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} For fire safety, the systems can be designed to have greater ability to handle higher temperatures and continue to operate. In dealing with security, the embedded systems can be self-sufficient and be able to deal with cut electrical and communication systems.

A new class of miniature wireless devices called [[mote (sensor)|motes]] are networked wireless sensors. Wireless sensor networking, [[WSN]], makes use of miniaturization made possible by advanced IC design to couple full wireless subsystems to sophisticated sensors, enabling people and companies to measure a myriad of things in the physical world and act on this information through IT monitoring and control systems. These motes are completely self-contained, and will typically run off a battery source for years before the batteries need to be changed or charges.

Embedded Wi-Fi modules provide a simple means of wirelessly enabling any device that communicates via a serial port.

==Characteristics==
Embedded systems are designed to do some specific task, rather than be a general-purpose computer for multiple tasks. Some also have [[Real-time computing|real-time]] performance constraints that must be met, for reasons such as safety and usability; others may have low or no performance requirements, allowing the system hardware to be simplified to reduce costs.

Embedded systems are not always standalone devices. Many embedded systems consist of small parts within a larger device that serves a more general purpose. For example, the [[Gibson Robot Guitar]] features an embedded system for tuning the strings, but the overall purpose of the Robot Guitar is, of course, to play music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.embedded.com/underthehood/207401418 Embedded.com – Under the Hood: Robot Guitar embeds autotuning] By David Carey, TechOnline EE Times (04/22/08, 11:10:00 AM EDT)Embedded Systems Design – Embedded.com&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, an embedded system in an [[automobile]] provides a specific function as a subsystem of the car itself.

[[File:ESOM270 eSOM300 Computer on Modules.jpg|thumb|e-con Systems eSOM270 &amp; eSOM300 Computer on Modules]]
The program instructions written for embedded systems are referred to as [[firmware]], and are stored in read-only memory or [[flash memory]] chips. They run with limited computer hardware resources: little memory, small or non-existent keyboard or screen.

===User interface===
[[File:MicroVGA TUI demoapp.jpg|thumb|Embedded system [[text user interface]] using MicroVGA&lt;ref group="nb" name="MicroVGA"&gt;For more details of MicroVGA see this [http://www.microvga.com/pdf/uvga-text-ds.pdf PDF].&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Embedded systems range from [[Headless system|no user interface]] at all, in systems dedicated only to one task, to complex [[Desktop operating system#Graphical user interfaces|graphical user interfaces]] that resemble modern computer desktop operating systems.
Simple embedded devices use [[Push-button|buttons]], [[LED]]s, graphic or character [[LCD]]s ([[Hitachi HD44780 LCD controller|HD44780 LCD]] for example) with a simple [[menu (computing)|menu system]].

More sophisticated devices that use a graphical screen with [[touch screen|touch]] sensing or screen-edge buttons provide flexibility while minimizing space used: the meaning of the buttons can change with the screen, and selection involves the natural behavior of pointing at what is desired. [[Mobile device|Handheld systems]] often have a screen with a "joystick button" for a pointing device.

Some systems provide user interface remotely with the help of a serial (e.g. [[RS-232]], [[USB]], [[I²C]], etc.) or network (e.g. [[Ethernet]]) connection. This approach gives several advantages: extends the capabilities of embedded system, avoids the cost of a display, simplifies [[Board support package|BSP]] and allows one to build a rich user interface on the PC. A good example of this is the combination of an [[Embedded HTTP server|embedded web server]] running on an embedded device (such as an [[IP camera]]) or a [[Router (computing)|network router]]. The user interface is displayed in a [[web browser]] on a PC connected to the device, therefore needing no software to be installed.

===Processors in embedded systems===
Embedded processors can be broken into two broad categories. Ordinary microprocessors (μP) use separate integrated circuits for memory and peripherals. Microcontrollers (μC) have on-chip peripherals, thus reducing power consumption, size and cost. In contrast to the personal computer market, many different basic [[CPU architecture]]s are used since software is custom-developed for an application and is not a commodity product installed by the end user. Both [[Von Neumann architecture|Von Neumann]] as well as various degrees of [[Harvard architecture]]s are used. [[RISC]] as well as non-RISC processors are found. Word lengths vary from 4-bit to 64-bits and beyond, although the most typical remain 8/16-bit. Most architectures come in a large number of different variants and shapes, many of which are also manufactured by several different companies.

[[List of common microcontrollers|Numerous microcontrollers]] have been developed for embedded systems use. General-purpose microprocessors are also used in embedded systems, but generally, require more support circuitry than microcontrollers.

====Ready-made computer boards====
[[PC/104]] and PC/104+ are examples of standards for ''ready-made'' computer boards intended for small, low-volume embedded and ruggedized systems, mostly x86-based. These are often physically small compared to a standard PC, although still quite large compared to most simple (8/16-bit) embedded systems. They often use [[DOS]], [[Linux]], [[NetBSD]], or an embedded [[real-time operating system]] such as [[MicroC/OS-II]], [[QNX]] or [[VxWorks]]. Sometimes these boards use non-x86 processors.

In certain applications, where small size or power efficiency are not primary concerns, the components used may be compatible with those used in general purpose x86 personal computers. Boards such as the VIA [[EPIA]] range help to bridge the gap by being PC-compatible but highly integrated, physically smaller or have other attributes making them attractive to embedded engineers. The advantage of this approach is that low-cost commodity components may be used along with the same software development tools used for general software development. Systems built in this way are still regarded as embedded since they are integrated into larger devices and fulfill a single role. Examples of devices that may adopt this approach are [[Automated teller machines|ATMs]] and [[arcade machines]], which contain code specific to the application.

However, most ready-made embedded systems boards are not PC-centered and do not use the ISA or PCI buses. When a [[system-on-a-chip]] processor is involved, there may be little benefit to having a standardized bus connecting discrete components, and the environment for both hardware and software tools may be very different.

One common design style uses a small system module, perhaps the size of a business card, holding high density [[Ball grid array|BGA]] chips such as an [[ARM architecture|ARM]]-based [[system-on-a-chip]] processor and peripherals, external [[flash memory]] for storage, and [[Dynamic random access memory|DRAM]] for runtime memory. The module vendor will usually provide boot software and make sure there is a selection of operating systems, usually including [[Linux]] and some real time choices. These modules can be manufactured in high volume, by organizations familiar with their specialized testing issues, and combined with much lower volume custom mainboards with application-specific external peripherals.

Implementation of embedded systems has advanced so that they can easily be implemented with already-made boards that are based on worldwide accepted platforms. These platforms include, but are not limited to, [[Arduino]] and [[Raspberry Pi]].

====ASIC and FPGA solutions====
A common array for very-high-volume embedded systems is the [[system on a chip]] (SoC) that contains a complete system consisting of multiple processors, multipliers, caches and interfaces on a single chip. SoCs can be implemented as an [[application-specific integrated circuit]] (ASIC) or using a [[field-programmable gate array]] (FPGA).

===Peripherals===
[[File:SMSC LAN91C110 ethernet chip.jpg|thumb|A close-up of the SMSC LAN91C110 (SMSC 91x) chip, an embedded [[Ethernet]] chip]]

Embedded systems talk with the outside world via [[peripheral]]s, such as:
* Serial Communication Interfaces (SCI): [[RS-232]], [[RS-422]], [[RS-485]], etc.
* Synchronous Serial Communication Interface: [[I2C]], [[Serial Peripheral Interface Bus|SPI]], SSC and ESSI (Enhanced Synchronous Serial Interface)
* [[Universal Serial Bus]] (USB)
* Multi Media Cards (SD cards, Compact Flash, etc.)
* Networks: [[Ethernet]], [[LonWorks]], etc.
* [[Fieldbus]]es: [[Controller Area Network|CAN-Bus]], [[Local Interconnect Network|LIN-Bus]], [[PROFIBUS]], etc.
* Timers: [[Phase-locked loop|PLL]](s), Capture/Compare and [[Time Processing Unit]]s
* Discrete IO: aka [[General Purpose Input/Output]] (GPIO)
* Analog to Digital/Digital to Analog ([[Analog-to-digital converter|ADC]]/[[Digital-to-analog converter|DAC]])
* Debugging: [[JTAG]], [[In-System Programming|ISP]], [[In Circuit Serial Programming (ICSP)|ICSP]], [[Background Debug Mode interface|BDM]] Port, BITP, and DB9 ports.

===Tools===
As with other software, embedded system designers use [[compiler]]s, [[Assembly language|assemblers]], and [[debugger]]s to develop embedded system software. However, they may also use some more specific tools:
* In circuit debuggers or emulators (see next section).
* Utilities to add a checksum or [[Cyclic redundancy check|CRC]] to a program, so the embedded system can check if the program is valid.
* For systems using [[digital signal processing]], developers may use a math workbench to simulate the mathematics.
* System level modeling and simulation tools help designers to construct simulation models of a system with hardware components such as [[processors]], [[memories]], [[Direct memory access|DMA]], [[Interface (computing)|interface]]s, buses and software behavior flow as a state diagram or flow diagram using configurable library blocks. Simulation is conducted to select right components by performing power vs. performance trade-off, reliability analysis and bottleneck analysis. Typical reports that helps designer to make architecture decisions includes application latency, device throughput, device utilization, power consumption of the full system as well as device-level power consumption.
* A model-based development tool creates and simulate graphical data flow and UML state chart diagrams of components like digital filters, motor controllers, communication protocol decoding and multi-rate tasks.
* Custom compilers and linkers may be used to optimize specialized hardware.
* An embedded system may have its own special language or design tool, or add enhancements to an existing language such as [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]] or [[BASIC Stamp|Basic]].
* Another alternative is to add a [[real-time operating system]] or [[embedded operating system]]
* Modeling and code generating [[UML tool|tools]] often based on [[UML state machine|state machines]]

Software tools can come from several sources:
* Software companies that specialize in the embedded market
* Ported from the [[GNU]] software development tools
* Sometimes, development tools for a personal computer can be used if the embedded processor is a close relative to a common PC processor

As the complexity of embedded systems grows, higher level tools and operating systems are migrating into machinery where it makes sense. For example, [[cellphone]]s, [[personal digital assistant]]s and other consumer computers often need significant software that is purchased or provided by a person other than the manufacturer of the electronics. In these systems, an open programming environment such as [[Linux]], [[NetBSD]], [[OSGi]] or [[Embedded Java]] is required so that the third-party software provider can sell to a large market.

Embedded systems are commonly found in consumer, cooking, industrial, automotive, medical applications.
Some examples of embedded systems are MP3 players, mobile phones, video game consoles, digital cameras, DVD players, and GPS. Household appliances, such as microwave ovens, washing machines and dishwashers, include embedded systems to provide flexibility and efficiency.

==Debugging==
Embedded [[debugging]] may be performed at different levels, depending on the facilities available. The different metrics that characterize the different forms of embedded debugging are: does it slow down the main application, how close is the debugged system or application to the actual system or application, how expressive are the triggers that can be set for debugging (e.g., inspecting the memory when a particular [[program counter]] value is reached), and what can be inspected in the debugging process (such as, only memory, or memory and registers, etc.).

From simplest to most sophisticated they can be roughly grouped into the following areas:
* Interactive resident debugging, using the simple shell provided by the embedded operating system (e.g. Forth and Basic)
* External debugging using logging or serial port output to trace operation using either a monitor in flash or using a debug server like the [[Remedy Debugger]] that even works for heterogeneous [[Multi-core processor|multicore]] systems.
* An in-circuit debugger (ICD), a hardware device that connects to the microprocessor via a [[JTAG]] or [[Nexus (standard)|Nexus]] interface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tancreti|first=Matthew|last2=Hossain|first2=Mohammad Sajjad|last3=Bagchi|first3=Saurabh|last4=Raghunathan|first4=Vijay|date=2011|title=Aveksha: A Hardware-software Approach for Non-intrusive Tracing and Profiling of Wireless Embedded Systems|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2070942.2070972|journal=Proceedings of the 9th ACM Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems|series=SenSys '11|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=288–301|doi=10.1145/2070942.2070972|isbn=9781450307185}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows the operation of the microprocessor to be controlled externally, but is typically restricted to specific debugging capabilities in the processor. 
* An [[in-circuit emulator]] (ICE) replaces the microprocessor with a simulated equivalent, providing full control over all aspects of the microprocessor.
* A complete [[emulator]] provides a simulation of all aspects of the hardware, allowing all of it to be controlled and modified, and allowing debugging on a normal PC. The downsides are expense and slow operation, in some cases up to 100 times slower than the final system.
* For SoC designs, the typical approach is to verify and debug the design on an FPGA prototype board. Tools such as Certus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eejournal.com/archives/articles/20121030-tektronix/ | title=Tektronix Shakes Up Prototyping, Embedded Instrumentation Boosts Boards to Emulator Status| publisher=Electronic Engineering Journal | date= 2012-10-30|accessdate=2012-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; are used to insert probes in the FPGA RTL that make signals available for observation. This is used to debug hardware, firmware and software interactions across multiple FPGA with capabilities similar to a logic analyzer.
* Software-only debuggers have the benefit that they do not need any hardware modification but have to carefully control what they record in order to conserve time and storage space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tancreti|first=Matthew|last2=Sundaram|first2=Vinaitheerthan|last3=Bagchi|first3=Saurabh|last4=Eugster|first4=Patrick|date=2015|title=TARDIS: Software-only System-level Record and Replay in Wireless Sensor Networks|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2737095.2737096|journal=Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks|series=IPSN '15|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=286–297|doi=10.1145/2737095.2737096|isbn=9781450334754}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unless restricted to external debugging, the programmer can typically load and run software through the tools, view the code running in the processor, and start or stop its operation. The view of the code may be as [[High-level programming language|HLL]] [[source-code]], [[assembly code]] or mixture of both.

Because an embedded system is often composed of a wide variety of elements, the debugging strategy may vary. For instance, debugging a software- (and microprocessor-) centric embedded system is different from debugging an embedded system where most of the processing is performed by peripherals (DSP, FPGA, and co-processor).
An increasing number of embedded systems today use more than one single processor core. A common problem with multi-core development is the proper synchronization of software execution. In this case, the embedded system design may wish to check the data traffic on the busses between the processor cores, which requires very low-level debugging, at signal/bus level, with a [[logic analyzer]], for instance.

===Tracing===

Real-time operating systems ([[RTOS]]) often supports [[tracing (software)|tracing]] of operating system events. A graphical view is presented by a host PC tool, based on a recording of the system behavior. The trace recording can be performed in software, by the RTOS, or by special tracing hardware. RTOS tracing allows developers to understand timing and performance issues of the software system and gives a good understanding of the high-level system behaviors. Commercial tools like [[RTXC Quadros]] or [[IAR Systems]] exists.

===Reliability===
Embedded systems often reside in machines that are expected to run continuously for years without errors, and in some cases recover by themselves if an error occurs. Therefore, the software is usually developed and tested more carefully than that for personal computers, and unreliable mechanical moving parts such as disk drives, switches or buttons are avoided.

Specific reliability issues may include:
* The system cannot safely be shut down for repair, or it is too inaccessible to repair. Examples include space systems, undersea cables, navigational beacons, bore-hole systems, and automobiles.
* The system must be kept running for safety reasons. "Limp modes" are less tolerable. Often backups are selected by an operator. Examples include aircraft navigation, reactor control systems, safety-critical chemical factory controls, train signals.
* The system will lose large amounts of money when shut down: Telephone switches, factory controls, bridge and elevator controls, funds transfer and market making, automated sales and service.

A variety of techniques are used, sometimes in combination, to recover from errors—both software bugs such as [[memory leak]]s, and also [[soft error]]s in the hardware:
* [[watchdog timer]] that resets the computer unless the software periodically notifies the watchdog subsystems with redundant spares that can be switched over to software "limp modes" that provide partial function
* Designing with a [[Trusted Computing Base]] (TCB) architecture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://c59951.r51.cf2.rackcdn.com/5557-528-heiser.pdf |title=Your System is secure?

This encapsulation keeps faults from propagating from one subsystem to another, improving reliability. This may also allow a subsystem to be automatically shut down and restarted on fault detection.

===High vs. low volume===
For high volume systems such as [[Digital audio player|portable music players]] or [[mobile phone]]s, minimizing cost is usually the primary design consideration. Engineers typically select hardware that is just “good enough” to implement the necessary functions.

For low-volume or prototype embedded systems, general purpose computers may be adapted by limiting the programs or by replacing the operating system with a [[real-time operating system]].

==Embedded software architectures==
{{Main article|Embedded software}}

There are several different types of software architecture in common use.

===Simple control loop===
In this design, the software simply has a [[loop (computing)|loop]]. The loop [[subroutine|calls subroutines]], each of which manages a part of the hardware or software. Hence it is called a simple control loop or control loop.

===Interrupt-controlled system===
Some embedded systems are predominantly controlled by [[interrupt]]s. This means that tasks performed by the system are triggered by different kinds of events; an interrupt could be generated, for example, by a timer in a predefined frequency, or by a serial port controller receiving a byte.

These kinds of systems are used if event handlers need low latency, and the event handlers are short and simple. Usually, these kinds of systems run a simple task in a main loop also, but this task is not very sensitive to unexpected delays.

Sometimes the interrupt handler will add longer tasks to a queue structure. Later, after the interrupt handler has finished, these tasks are executed by the main loop. This method brings the system close to a multitasking kernel with discrete processes.

===Cooperative multitasking===
A [[nonpreemptive multitasking]] system is very similar to the simple control loop scheme, except that the loop is hidden in an [[Application programming interface|API]].&lt;ref name="Barr-glossary" /&gt; The programmer defines a series of tasks, and each task gets its own environment to “run” in. When a task is idle, it calls an idle routine, usually called “pause”, “wait”, “yield”, “nop” (stands for ''no operation''), etc.

The advantages and disadvantages are similar to that of the control loop, except that adding new software is easier, by simply writing a new task, or adding to the queue.

===Preemptive multitasking or multi-threading===
In this type of system, a low-level piece of code switches between tasks or threads based on a timer (connected to an interrupt). This is the level at which the system is generally considered to have an "operating system" kernel. Depending on how much functionality is required, it introduces more or less of the complexities of managing multiple tasks running conceptually in parallel.

As any code can potentially damage the data of another task (except in larger systems using an [[Memory management unit|MMU]]) programs must be carefully designed and tested, and access to shared data must be controlled by some synchronization strategy, such as [[message queue]]s, [[semaphore (programming)|semaphores]] or a [[non-blocking synchronization]] scheme.

Because of these complexities, it is common for organizations to use a [[real-time operating system]] (RTOS), allowing the application programmers to concentrate on device functionality rather than operating system services, at least for large systems; smaller systems often cannot afford the overhead associated with a ''generic'' real-time system, due to limitations regarding memory size, performance, or battery life. The choice that an RTOS is required brings in its own issues, however, as the selection must be done prior to starting to the application development process. This timing forces developers to choose the embedded operating system for their device based upon current requirements and so restricts future options to a large extent.&lt;ref&gt;

|title= Working across Multiple Embedded Platforms
|publisher=clarinox
|accessdate=2010-08-17
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The restriction of future options becomes more of an issue as product life decreases. Additionally the level of complexity is continuously growing as devices are required to manage variables such as serial, USB, TCP/IP, Bluetooth, Wireless LAN, trunk radio, multiple channels, data and voice, enhanced graphics, multiple states, multiple threads, numerous wait states and so on. These trends are leading to the uptake of [[embedded middleware]] in addition to a real-time operating system.

===Microkernels and exokernels===
A [[microkernel]] is a logical step up from a real-time OS. The usual arrangement is that the operating system kernel allocates memory and switches the CPU to different threads of execution. User mode processes implement major functions such as file systems, network interfaces, etc.

In general, microkernels succeed when the task switching and intertask communication is fast and fail when they are slow.

[[Exokernel]]s communicate efficiently by normal subroutine calls. The hardware and all the software in the system are available to and extensible by application programmers.

===Monolithic kernels===
In this case, a relatively large kernel with sophisticated capabilities is adapted to suit an embedded environment. This gives programmers an environment similar to a desktop operating system like [[Linux]] or [[Microsoft Windows]], and is therefore very productive for development; on the downside, it requires considerably more hardware resources, is often more expensive, and, because of the complexity of these kernels, can be less predictable and reliable.

Common examples of embedded monolithic kernels are [[embedded Linux]] and [[Windows CE]].

Despite the increased cost in hardware, this type of embedded system is increasing in popularity, especially on the more powerful embedded devices such as [[wireless router]]s and [[Automotive navigation system|GPS navigation systems]]. Here are some of the reasons:
* Ports to common embedded chip sets are available.
* They permit re-use of publicly available code for [[device driver]]s, [[web server]]s, [[Firewall (networking)|firewalls]], and other code.
* Development systems can start out with broad feature-sets, and then the distribution can be configured to exclude unneeded functionality, and save the expense of the memory that it would consume.
* Many engineers believe that running application code in user mode is more reliable and easier to debug, thus making the development process easier and the code more portable.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}
* Features requiring faster response than can be guaranteed can often be placed in [[Programmable logic device|hardware]].

===Additional software components===
In addition to the core operating system, many embedded systems have additional upper-layer software components. These components consist of networking protocol stacks like [[Controller–area network|CAN]], [[TCP/IP]], [[FTP]], [[HTTP]], and [[HTTPS]], and also included storage capabilities like [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] and flash memory management systems. If the embedded device has audio and video capabilities, then the appropriate drivers and codecs will be present in the system. In the case of the monolithic kernels, many of these software layers are included. In the RTOS category, the availability of the additional software components depends upon the commercial offering.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4146">'''Entosis''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἐντός ''entos'', "within" and -ωσις ''-osis'', "disease") is the invasion of a living cell into another cell's cytoplasm.&lt;ref name="Janssen 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Janssen|first=Aniek|author2=Rene H. Medema|title=Entosis: aneuploidy by invasion|journal=Nature Cell Biology|date=1 March 2011|volume=13|pages=199–201|doi=10.1038/ncb0311-199}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process was discovered by Overholtzer, et al. as reported in ''[[Cell (journal)|Cell]]''.&lt;ref name="Overholtzer 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Overholtzer|first=Michael|author2=Arnaud A. Mailleux |author3=Ghassan Mouneimne |author4=Guillaume Normand |author5=Stuart J. Schnitt |author6=Randall W. King |author7=Edmund S. Cibas |author8=Joan S.

Entotic cells, also referred to as cell-in-cell structures, are triggered by loss of attachment to the extracellular matrix (ECM). This internalization of one cell by another is dependent on adherens junctions, and is driven by a Rho-dependent process, involving actin polymerization and myosin II activity in the internalized cell.&lt;ref name="Overholtzer 2007" /&gt; Adherens junctions bind cells together by linking cadherin transmembrane protein complexes of adjacent cells to the cytoskeleton. When certain cell types are detached from the ECM and have lost adhesion, the compaction force between neighboring cells can cause them to push into their neighbors, forming the trademark cell-in-cell structures.&lt;ref name="Memorial 2009" /&gt; Though cell-in-cell structures commonly refer to the interaction between two neighboring cells, entosis has been observed involving more than two cells. In the case of an entotic structure formed between three cells, the middle cell acts as both an internalizing and an outer host cell simultaneously.&lt;ref name="Memorial 2009"&gt;{{cite web|last=Overholtzer|first=Michael|title=An Interview with Michael Overholtzer|url=http://www.mskcc.org/research/lab/michael-overholtzer/interview-michael-overholtzer|publisher=Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center|accessdate=14 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aneuploidy, a condition in which non-disjunction gives rise to gametes with an abnormal number of chromosomes,&lt;ref name="Alberts 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Alberts|first=Bruce|title=Essential Cell Biology, 3rd Ed|year=2010|publisher=Garland Science, Taylor &amp; Franis Group, LLC|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-8153-4129-1|pages=662–663}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the most prevalent phenotypes of human tumors. The underlying cause of aneuploidy remains highly debated; however, entosis is shown to perturb cytokinesis (cytoplasmic division) and trigger the formation of aneuploid cells.&lt;ref name="Janssen 2011" /&gt; This would be in line with past research, as cell-in-cell structures have been widely observed in the focused study of many human tumors, including lung, breast, and endometrial stromal carcinomas.&lt;ref name="Overholtzer 2007" /&gt;

A cell trapped by entosis is initially alive and can divide inside the cell that has enveloped it. On occasion, the entotic cell will be released by the host cell, but most internalized cells are eventually killed.&lt;ref name="Memorial 2009" /&gt; Normal cells can kill themselves via apoptosis, involving the programmed engulfment and phagocytic ingestion of a cell by another. Entosis differs greatly from apoptosis in that the entotic process exhibits behavior closely resembling cellular invasion rather than cellular engulfment.&lt;ref name="Overholtzer 2007" /&gt;  Cancer cells adaptively avoid apoptosis, allowing them to live and multiply indefinitely, making it difficult to design drugs that effectively kill tumors. Therefore, entosis acts as a nonapoptotic cell death mechanism, and could possibly be a new way in which cancer cells can be killed.&lt;ref name="Memorial 2009" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15431">'''Eternal inflation''' is a hypothetical [[inflation (cosmology)|inflationary universe]] model, which is itself an outgrowth or extension of the [[Big Bang]] theory.

According to eternal inflation, the inflationary phase of the universe's expansion lasts forever throughout most of the universe. Because the regions expand exponentially rapidly, most of the volume of the universe at any given time is inflating. Eternal inflation, therefore, produces a hypothetically infinite [[multiverse]], in which only an insignificant [[fractal]] volume ends inflation.

[[Paul Steinhardt]], one of the original architects of the inflationary model, introduced the first example of eternal inflation in 1983,&lt;ref name="steinhardt"&gt;{{cite book| editor1-last=Gibbons| editor1-first= Gary W.| editor1-link= Gary Gibbons| editor2-first = Stephen W.| editor2-last = Hawking |editor2-link=Stephen Hawking| editor3-last = Siklos| editor3-first= S.T.C. |title=The Very Early Universe |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |chapter=Natural Inflation |pages = 251–66| year=1983 |isbn=0-521-31677-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alexander Vilenkin]] showed that it is generic.&lt;ref name = "vilenkin"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vilenkin | first1 = Alexander | year = 1983 | title = Birth of Inflationary Universes  | url = http://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.27.2848  | journal = Physical Review D | volume = 27  | issue = 12 | pages = 2848–2855 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevD.27.2848|bibcode = 1983PhRvD..27.2848V }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alan Guth]]'s 2007 paper, "Eternal inflation and its implications",&lt;ref name="eternal"&gt;Guth, Alan; [https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0702178 Eternal inflation and its implications] arXiv:hep-th/0702178&lt;/ref&gt; states that under reasonable assumptions "Although inflation is generically eternal into the future, it is not eternal into the past."  Guth detailed what was known about the subject at the time, and demonstrated that eternal inflation was still considered the likely outcome of inflation, more than 20 years after eternal inflation was first introduced by Steinhardt.

==Overview==

===Development of the theory===
Inflation, or the inflationary universe theory, was originally developed as a way to overcome the few remaining problems with what was otherwise considered a successful theory of cosmology, the Big Bang model.

In 1979, Alan Guth introduced the inflationary model of the universe to explain why the universe is flat and homogeneous (which refers to the smooth distribution of matter and radiation on a large scale).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Guth |first1= Alan H. |title = Inflationary universe: A possible solution to the horizon and flatness problems |url = http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.23.347 |journal = Phys. Rev. D | volume=23 |issue= 2|pages= 347–356|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.23.347|bibcode=1981PhRvD..23..347G}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic idea was that the universe underwent a period of rapidly accelerating expansion a few instants after the Big Bang. He offered a mechanism for causing the inflation to begin: false vacuum energy.  Guth coined the term "inflation," and was the first to discuss the theory with other scientists worldwide.

Guth's original formulation was problematic, as there was no consistent way to bring an end to the inflationary epoch and end up with the hot, [[isotropic]], homogeneous universe observed today.  Although the false vacuum could decay into empty "bubbles" of "true vacuum" that expanded at the speed of light, the empty bubbles could not coalesce to reheat the universe, because they could not keep up with the remaining inflating universe.

In 1982, this "[[Graceful exit problem (cosmology)|graceful exit problem]]" was solved independently by [[Andrei Linde]] and by [[Andreas Albrecht (cosmologist)|Andreas Albrecht]] and Paul J. Steinhardt&lt;ref name="journals.aps.org"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Albrecht | first1 = A. | last2 = Steinhardt | first2 = P. J. | year = 1982 | title = Cosmology For Grand Unified Theories With Radiatively Induced Symmetry Breaking | url = http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.48.1220 | journal = Phys. Rev. Lett. | volume = 48 | issue = 17 | pages = 1220–1223 | doi= 10.1103/PhysRevLett.48.1220 | bibcode=1982PhRvL..48.1220A}}&lt;/ref&gt; who showed how to end inflation without making empty bubbles and, instead, end up with a hot expanding universe. The basic idea was to have a continuous "slow-roll" or slow evolution from false vacuum to true without making any bubbles.  The improved model was called "new inflation."

In 1983, Paul Steinhardt was the first to show that this "new inflation" does not have to end everywhere.&lt;ref name="steinhardt"/&gt; Instead, it might only end in a finite patch or a hot bubble full of matter and radiation, and that inflation continues in most of the universe while producing hot bubble after hot bubble along the way.  Alexander Vilenkin showed that when quantum effects are properly included, this is actually generic to all new inflation models.&lt;ref name= "vilenkin"/&gt;

Using ideas introduced by Steinhardt and Vilenkin, Andrei Linde published an alternative model of inflation in 1986 which used these ideas to provide a detailed description of what has become known as the Chaotic Inflation theory or eternal inflation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Linde, A.D. |title=Eternally Existing Self-Reproducing Chaotic Inflationary Universe| journal= Physics Letters B |date= August 1986|volume=175|pages=395–400|url=http://www.stanford.edu/~alinde/Eternal86.pdf|doi=10.1016/0370-2693(86)90611-8|bibcode = 1986PhLB..175..395L|issue=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quantum fluctuations===
New inflation does not produce a perfectly symmetric universe due to quantum fluctuations during inflation.  The fluctuations cause the energy and matter density to be different in different points in space.

Quantum fluctuations in the hypothetical inflation field produce changes in the rate of expansion that are responsible for eternal inflation. Those regions with a higher rate of inflation expand faster and dominate the universe, despite the natural tendency of inflation to end in other regions. This allows inflation to continue forever, to produce future-eternal inflation. As a simplified example, suppose that during inflation, the natural decay rate of the inflaton field is slow compared to the effect of quantum fluctuation. When a mini-universe inflates and "self-reproduces" into, say, twenty causally-disconnected mini-universes of equal size to the original mini-universe, perhaps nine of the new mini-universes will have a larger, rather than smaller, average inflaton field value than the original mini-universe, because they inflated from regions of the original mini-universe where quantum fluctuation pushed the inflaton value up more than the slow inflation decay rate brought the inflaton value down. Originally there was one mini-universe with a given inflaton value; now there are nine mini-universes that have a slightly larger inflaton value. (Of course, there are also eleven mini-universes where the inflaton value is slightly lower than it originally was.) Each mini-universe with the larger inflaton field value restarts a similar round of approximate self-reproduction within itself. (The mini-universes with lower inflaton values may also reproduce, unless its inflaton value is small enough that the region drops out of inflation and ceases self-reproduction.) This process continues indefinitely; nine high-inflaton mini-universes might become 81, then 729... Thus, there is eternal inflation.&lt;ref&gt;Linde, Andrei. "Inflationary cosmology." Inflationary cosmology. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2008. 1-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, quantum fluctuations were suggested by [[Viatcheslav Mukhanov]] and [[Gennady Chibisov]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=JETP Letters|volume=33|pages=532–5|year=1981|title=Quantum fluctuation and "nonsingular" universe|first=ViatcheslavF.|last=Mukhanov|bibcode = 1981JETPL..33..532M|last2=Chibisov|first2=G.

In the context of inflation, quantum fluctuations were first analyzed at the three-week 1982 Nuffield Workshop on the Very Early Universe at Cambridge University.&lt;ref&gt;See Guth (1997) for a popular description of the workshop, or ''The Very Early Universe'', {{ISBN|0521316774}} eds Hawking, Gibbon &amp; Siklos for a more detailed report&lt;/ref&gt; The average strength of the fluctuations was first calculated by four groups working separately over the course of the workshop: [[Stephen Hawking]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The development of irregularities in a single bubble inflationary universe|first=S.W.|last=Hawking|journal=Physics Letters B|volume=115|issue=4|pages=295–297|year=1982|doi=10.1016/0370-2693(82)90373-2|bibcode = 1982PhLB..115..295H }}&lt;/ref&gt; Starobinsky;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Dynamics of phase transition in the new inflationary universe scenario and generation of perturbations|first=Alexei A.|last=Starobinsky|journal=Physics Letters B|volume=117|issue=3–4|pages=175–8|year=1982|doi=10.1016/0370-2693(82)90541-X|bibcode = 1982PhLB..117..175S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Guth and So-Young Pi;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Fluctuations in the new inflationary universe|first1=A.H.|last1=Guth|first2=So-Young|last2= Ping| year=1982|journal=Phys.

The early calculations derived at the Nuffield Workshop only focused on the average fluctuations, whose magnitude is too small to affect inflation.  However, beginning with the examples presented by Steinhardt&lt;ref name="steinhardt"/&gt; and Vilenkin,&lt;ref name="vilenkin"/&gt; the same quantum physics was later shown to produce occasional large fluctuations that increase the rate of inflation and keep inflation going eternally.

===Further developments===
In analyzing the Planck Satellite data from 2013,  Anna Ijjas and Paul Steinhardt showed that the simplest textbook inflationary models were eliminated and that the remaining models require exponentially more tuned starting conditions,  more parameters to be adjusted, and less inflation. Later Planck observations reported in 2015 confirmed these conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Iijas | first1 = Anna | last2 = Loeb | first2 = Abraham| last3 = Steinhardt | first3 = Paul | year = 2013 | title = Inflationary Paradigm in trouble after Planck 2013  | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269313003924 | journal = Phys.

A 2014 paper by Kohli and Haslam called into question the viability of the eternal inflation theory, by analyzing Linde's chaotic inflation theory in which the quantum fluctuations are modeled as Gaussian white noise.&lt;ref&gt;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1408.2249.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; They showed that in this popular scenario, eternal inflation in fact cannot be eternal, and the random noise leads to spacetime being filled with singularities. This was demonstrated by showing that solutions to the Einstein field equations diverge in a finite time. Their paper therefore concluded that the theory of eternal inflation based on random quantum fluctuations would not be a viable theory, and the resulting existence of a multiverse is "still very much an open question that will require much deeper investigation".

==Inflation, eternal inflation, and the multiverse==
In 1983, it was shown that inflation could be eternal, leading to a [[multiverse]] in which space is broken up into bubbles or patches whose properties differ from patch to patch spanning all physical possibilities.

Paul Steinhardt, who produced the first example of eternal inflation,&lt;ref name="steinhardt"/&gt; eventually became a strong and vocal opponent of the theory. He argued that the multiverse represented a breakdown of the inflationary theory, because, in a multiverse, any outcome is equally possible, so inflation makes no predictions and, hence, is untestable. Consequently, he argued, inflation fails a key condition for a [[scientific theory]].&lt;ref name= "Inflation Debate"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Steinhardt, Paul J.| title = Inflation Debate: Is the theory at the heart of modern cosmology deeply flawed?| journal = Scientific American|date=April 2011| url = http://www.physics.princeton.edu/~steinh/0411036.pdf|doi = 10.1038/scientificamerican0411-36| volume=304| pages=36–43| bibcode=2011SciAm.304d..36S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.physics.princeton.edu/~steinh/vaasrev.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Linde and Guth, however, continued to support the inflationary theory and the multiverse. Guth declared:
{{bquote|It's hard to build models of inflation that don't lead to a multiverse. It's not impossible, so I think there's still certainly research that needs to be done. But most models of inflation do lead to a multiverse, and evidence for inflation will be pushing us in the direction of taking the idea of a multiverse seriously.&lt;ref name=Kramer&gt;[http://www.space.com/25100-multiverse-cosmic-inflation-gravitational-waves.html Our Universe May Exist in a Multiverse, Cosmic Inflation Discovery Suggests]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Linde, "It's possible to invent models of inflation that do not allow a multiverse, but it's difficult. Every experiment that brings better credence to inflationary theory brings us much closer to hints that the multiverse is real."&lt;ref name=Kramer/&gt;

The exact cover problem is a kind of [[constraint satisfaction problem]].

An exact cover problem can be represented by an [[incidence matrix]] or a [[bipartite graph]].

[[Knuth's Algorithm X]] is an [[algorithm]] that finds all solutions to an exact cover problem. DLX is the name given to Algorithm X when it is implemented efficiently using [[Donald Knuth]]'s [[Dancing Links]] technique on a computer.&lt;ref name="knuth" /&gt;

The standard exact cover problem can be generalized slightly to involve not only "exactly one" constraints but also "at-most-one" constraints.
 
Finding [[Pentomino]] tilings and solving [[Sudoku]] are noteworthy examples of exact cover problems.
The [[N queens problem]] is a slightly generalized exact cover problem.

== Formal definition ==

Given a collection &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; of [[subset]]s of a set ''X'', an exact cover of ''X'' is a subcollection &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}^*&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; that satisfies two conditions:
* The [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of any two distinct subsets in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}^*&lt;/math&gt; is [[empty set|empty]], i.e., the subsets in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}^*&lt;/math&gt; are [[pairwise disjoint]]. In other words, each element in ''X'' is contained in ''at most one'' subset in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}^*&lt;/math&gt;.
* The [[union (set theory)|union]] of the subsets in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}^*&lt;/math&gt; is ''X'', i.e., the subsets in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}^*&lt;/math&gt; [[cover (topology)|cover]] ''X''. In other words, each element in ''X'' is contained in ''at least one'' subset in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}^*&lt;/math&gt;.

In short, an exact cover is "exact" in the sense that each element in ''X'' is contained in ''exactly one'' subset in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}^*&lt;/math&gt;.

Equivalently, an exact cover of ''X'' is a subcollection &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}^*&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; that [[partition of a set|partitions]] ''X''.

For an exact cover of ''X'' to exist, it is necessary that:
* The union of the subsets in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; is ''X''. In other words, each element in ''X'' is contained in at least one subset in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;.

If the [[empty set]] ∅ is contained in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;, then it makes no difference whether or not it is in any exact cover.
Thus it is typical to assume that:
* The empty set is not in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}^*&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, each subset in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}^*&lt;/math&gt; contains at least one element.

=== Basic examples ===

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; = {''N'', ''O'', ''P'', ''E''} be a collection of subsets of a set ''X'' = {1, 2, 3, 4} such that:
* ''N'' = { },
* ''O'' = {1, 3},
* ''P'' = {2, 3}, and
* ''E'' = {2, 4}.

The subcollection {''O'', ''E''} is an exact cover of ''X'', since the subsets ''O'' = {1, 3} and ''E'' = {2, 4} are disjoint and their union is ''X'' = {1, 2, 3, 4}.

The subcollection {''N'', ''O'', ''E''} is also an exact cover of ''X''.
Including the empty set ''N'' = { } makes no difference, as it is disjoint with all subsets and does not change the union.

The subcollection {''E'', ''P''} is not an exact cover of ''X''.
The intersection of the subsets ''E'' and ''P'', {2}, is not empty:
The subsets ''E'' and ''P'' are not disjoint.
Moreover, the union of the subsets ''E'' and ''P'', {2, 3, 4}, is not ''X'' = {1, 2, 3, 4}:
Neither ''E'' nor ''P'' covers the element 1.

On the other hand, there is no exact cover—indeed, not even a cover—of ''Y'' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} because &lt;math&gt;\bigcup \mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; = {1, 2, 3, 4} is a proper subset of ''Y'':
None of the subsets in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; contains the element 5.

=== Detailed example ===

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; = {''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ''D'', ''E'', ''F''} be a collection of subsets
of a set ''X'' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} such that:
* ''A'' = {1, 4, 7};
* ''B'' = {1, 4};
* ''C'' = {4, 5, 7};
* ''D'' = {3, 5, 6};
* ''E'' = {2, 3, 6, 7}; and
* ''F'' = {2, 7}.

Then the subcollection &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}^*&lt;/math&gt; = {''B'', ''D'', ''F''} is an exact cover, since each element in ''X'' is contained in exactly one of the subsets:
* ''B'' = {1, 4};
* ''D'' = {3, 5, 6}; or
* ''F'' = {2, 7}.

Moreover, {''B'', ''D'', ''F''} is the only exact cover, as the following argument demonstrates:
Because ''A'' and ''B'' are the only subsets containing 1, an exact cover must contain ''A'' or ''B'', but not both.
If an exact cover contains ''A'', then it doesn't contain ''B'', ''C'', ''E'', or ''F'', as each of these subsets has an element in common with ''A''.
Then ''D'' is the only remaining subset, but the collection {''A'', ''D''} doesn't cover the element 2.
In conclusion, there is no exact cover containing ''A''.
On the other hand, if an exact cover contains ''B'', then it doesn't contain ''A'' or ''C'', as each of these subsets has an element in common with ''B''.
Because ''D'' is the only remaining subset containing 5, ''D'' must be part of the exact cover.
If an exact cover contains ''D'', then it doesn't contain ''E'', as ''E'' has an element in common with ''D''.
Then ''F'' is the only remaining subset, and the collection {''B'', ''D'', ''F''} is indeed an exact cover.
See the [[Knuth's Algorithm X#Example|example]] in the article on [[Knuth's Algorithm X]] for a matrix-based version of this argument.

== Representations ==

An exact cover problem is defined by the [[binary relation]] "contains" between subsets in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; and elements in ''X''.
There are different equivalent ways to represent this relation.

=== Standard representation ===

The standard way to represent the relation "contains" is to list the elements in each subset.

For example, the [[#Detailed example|detailed example]] above uses this standard representation:
* ''A'' = {1, 4, 7};
* &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;''B''&lt;/span&gt; = {&lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;};
* ''C'' = {4, 5, 7};
* &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;''D''&lt;/span&gt; = {&lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;};
* ''E'' = {2, 3, 6, 7}; and
* &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;''F''&lt;/span&gt; = {&lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;}.

Again, the subcollection &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}^*&lt;/math&gt; = {''B'', ''D'', ''F''} is an exact cover, since each element is contained in exactly one selected subset, as the highlighting makes clear.

=== Inverse representation ===

The relation "contains" between subsets and elements can be [[converse relation|converted]], listing the subsets in which each element is contained. 

For example, the relation "contains" in the [[#Detailed example|detailed example]] above can be represented by listing the subsets each element is contained in:
* 1 is an element of ''A'', &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;''B''&lt;/span&gt;;
* 2 is an element of ''E'', &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;''F''&lt;/span&gt;;
* 3 is an element of &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;''D''&lt;/span&gt;, ''E'';
* 4 is an element of ''A'', &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;''B''&lt;/span&gt;, ''C'';
* 5 is an element of ''C'', &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;''D''&lt;/span&gt;;
* 6 is an element of &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;''D''&lt;/span&gt;, ''E''; and
* 7 is an element of ''A'', ''C'', ''E'', &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;''F''&lt;/span&gt;.

Again, the subcollection &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}^*&lt;/math&gt; = {''B'', ''D'', ''F''} is an exact cover, since each element is contained in exactly one selected subset, as the highlighting makes clear.

When solving an exact cover problem, it is often useful to switch between the standard and inverse representations.
is an element of

=== Matrix and hypergraph representations ===

The relation "contains" can be represented by an [[incidence matrix]].  

The matrix includes one row for each subset in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; and one column for each element in ''X''.
The entry in a particular row and column is 1 if the corresponding subset contains the corresponding element, and is 0 otherwise.
As each row represents the elements contained in the corresponding subset and each column represents the subsets containing the corresponding element, an incidence matrix effectively provides both the standard and inverse representations.

In the matrix representation, an exact cover is a selection of rows such that each column contains a 1 in exactly one selected row.

For example, the relation "contains" in the [[#Detailed example|detailed example]] above can be represented by a 6×7 incidence matrix:&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Knuth]] in his paper "Dancing Links" gives this example, as equation (3), only with the rows reordered.&lt;/ref&gt;

:{| border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0"
! !! 1 !! 2 !! 3 !! 4 !! 5 !! 6 !! 7
|-
! ''A''
| 1 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 1
|-
! &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;''B''&lt;/span&gt;
| &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; || 0 || 0 || &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; || 0 || 0 || 0
|-
! ''C''
| 0 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 1 || 0 || 1
|-
! &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;''D''&lt;/span&gt;
| 0 || 0 || &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; || 0 || &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; || &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; || 0
|-
! ''E''
| 0 || 1 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 1
|-
! &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;''F''&lt;/span&gt;
| 0 || &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
|}

Again, the subcollection &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}^*&lt;/math&gt; = {''B'', ''D'', ''F''} is an exact cover, since each element is contained in exactly one selected subset, i.e., each column contains a 1 in exactly one selected row, as the highlighting makes clear.

See the [[Knuth's Algorithm X#Example|example]] in the article on [[Knuth's Algorithm X]] for a matrix-based solution to the [[#Detailed example|detailed example]] above.

In turn, the incidence matrix can be seen also as describing a [[hypergraph]].  The hypergraph includes one node for each element in ''X'' and one edge for each subset in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;; each node is included in exactly one of the edges forming the cover.

=== Graph representation ===

The relation "contains" can be represented by a [[bipartite graph]].

The vertices of the graph are divided into two disjoint sets, one representing the subsets in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; and another representing the elements in ''X''.
If a subset contains an element, an edge connects the corresponding vertices in the graph.

In the graph representation, an exact cover is a selection of vertices corresponding to subsets such that each vertex corresponding to an element is connected to exactly one selected vertex.

For example, the relation "contains" in the [[#Detailed example|detailed example]] above can be represented by a bipartite graph with 6+7 = 13 vertices:

[[File:Exact-cover-bigraph-highlighted.svg|none|300px]]

Again, the subcollection &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}^*&lt;/math&gt; = {''B'', ''D'', ''F''} is an exact cover, since each element is contained in exactly one selected subset, i.e., the vertex corresponding to each element in ''X'' is connected to exactly one selected vertex, as the highlighting makes clear.

== Equivalent problems ==

Although the canonical exact cover problem involves a collection &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; of subsets of a set ''X'', the logic does not depend on the presence of subsets containing elements.
An "abstract exact cover problem" arises whenever there is a [[heterogeneous relation]] between two sets ''P'' and ''Q'' and the goal is to select a subset ''P*'' of ''P'' such that each element in ''Q'' is related to ''exactly one'' element in ''P*''.
In general, the elements of ''P'' represent choices and the elements of ''Q'' represent "exactly one" constraints on those choices.

More formally, given a binary relation ''R'' &lt;math&gt;\subseteq &lt;/math&gt; ''P'' × ''Q'' between sets ''P'' and ''Q'', one can call a subset ''P*'' of ''P'' an "abstract exact cover" of ''Q'' if each element in ''Q'' is ''R''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;-related to exactly one element in ''P*''. Here ''R''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[converse relation|converse]] of ''R''.

In general, ''R''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; [[restriction (mathematics)|restricted]] to ''Q'' × ''P*'' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] from ''Q'' to ''P*'', which maps each element in ''Q'' to the unique element in ''P*'' that is ''R''-related to that element in ''Q''.
This function is [[onto]], unless ''P*'' contains the "empty set," i.e., an element which isn't ''R''-related to any element in ''Q''.

In the canonical exact cover problem, ''P'' is a collection &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; of subsets of ''X'', ''Q'' is the set ''X'', ''R'' is the binary relation "contains" between subsets and elements, and ''R''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; restricted to ''Q'' × ''P*'' is the function "is contained in" from elements to selected subsets.

== Exact hitting set ==

In [[mathematics]], given a collection &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; of subsets of a set ''X'', an '''exact hitting set''' ''X*'' is a subset of ''X'' such that each subset in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; contains ''exactly one'' element in ''X*''. One says that each subset in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; '''is hit by''' exactly one element in ''X*''.

In [[computer science]], the '''exact hitting set problem''' is a [[decision problem]] to find an exact hitting set or else determine none exists.

The exact hitting set problem is an abstract exact cover problem.
In the [[#Equivalent problems|notation above]], ''P'' is the set ''X'', ''Q'' is a collection &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; of subsets of ''X'', ''R'' is the binary relation "is contained in" between elements and subsets, and ''R''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; restricted to ''Q'' × ''P*'' is the function "contains" from subsets to selected elements.

Whereas an exact cover problem involves selecting subsets and the relation "contains" from subsets to elements, an exact hitting set problem involves selecting elements and the relation "is contained in" from elements to subsets.
In a sense, an exact hitting set problem is the inverse of the exact cover problem involving the same set and collection of subsets.

=== Exact hitting set example ===

As in the [[#Detailed example|detailed exact cover example]] above, let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; = {''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ''D'', ''E'', ''F''} be a collection of subsets of a set ''X'' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} such that:
* ''A'' = {&lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;, 4, 7};
* ''B'' = {&lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;, 4};
* ''C'' = {4, &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;, 7};
* ''D'' = {3, &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;, 6};
* ''E'' = {&lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;, 3, 6, 7}; and
* ''F'' = {&lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;, 7}.

Then ''X*'' = {1, 2, 5} is an exact hitting set, since each subset in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; contains exactly one element in ''X*'', as the highlighting makes clear.

Moreover, {1, 2, 5} is the only exact hitting set, as the following argument demonstrates:
Because 2 and 7 are the only elements that hit ''F'', an exact hitting set must contain 2 or 7, but not both.
If an exact hitting set contains 7, then it doesn't contain 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, as each of these elements are contained in some subset also containing 7.
Then there are no more remaining elements, but {7} is not an exactly hitting set, as it doesn't hit ''B'' or ''D''.
In conclusion, there is no exact hitting set containing 7.
On the other hand, if an exact hitting set contains 2, then it doesn't contain 3, 6, or 7, as each of these elements are contained in some subset also containing 2.
Because 5 is the only remaining element that hits ''D'', the exact hitting set must contain 5.
If an exact hitting set contains 5, then it doesn't contain 4, as both hit ''C''.
Because 1 is the only remaining element that hits ''A'', the exact hitting set must contain 1.
Then there are no more remaining elements, and {1, 2, 5} is indeed an exact hitting set.

Although this example involves the same collection of subsets as the detailed exact cover example above, it is essentially a different problem. In a sense, the exact hitting set problem is the inverse (or transpose or converse) of the corresponding exact cover problem above, as the matrix representation makes clear:

:{| border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0"
! !! ''A'' !! ''B'' !! ''C'' !! ''D'' !! ''E'' !! ''F''
|-
! &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
| &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; || &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0
|-
! &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
| 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; || &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
|-
! 3
| 0 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 1 || 0
|-
! 4
| 1 || 1 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0
|-
! &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
| 0 || 0 || &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; || &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; || 0 || 0
|-
! 6
| 0 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 1 || 0
|-
! 7
| 1 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 1 || 1
|}

=== Dual example ===

But there is another exact hitting set problem that is essentially the same as the [[#Detailed example|detailed exact cover example]] above, in which numbered elements become subsets and lettered subsets become elements, effectively inverting the relation between subsets and element.

For example, as the subset ''B'' contains the elements 1 and 4 in the exact cover problem, the subsets ''I'' and ''IV'' contain the element ''b'' in the dual exact hitting set problem.

In particular, let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; =  {''I'', ''II'', ''III'', ''IV'', ''V'', ''VI'', ''VII''} be a collection of subsets of a set ''X'' = {''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'', ''e'', ''f''} such that:
* ''I'' = {''a'', &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;''b''&lt;/span&gt;}
* ''II'' = {''e'', &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;''f''&lt;/span&gt;}
* ''III'' = {&lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;''d''&lt;/span&gt;, ''e''}
* ''IV'' = {''a'', &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;''b''&lt;/span&gt;, ''c''}
* ''V'' = {''c'', &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;''d''&lt;/span&gt;}
* ''VI'' = {&lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;''d''&lt;/span&gt;, ''e''}
* ''VII'' = {''a'', ''c'', ''e'', &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;''f''&lt;/span&gt;}

Then ''X*'' = {''b'', ''d'', ''f''} is an exact hitting set, since each subset in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; contains (is hit by) exactly one element in ''X*'', as the highlighting makes clear.

The exact hitting set ''X*'' = {''b'', ''d'', ''f''} here is essentially the same as the exact cover &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}^*&lt;/math&gt; = {''B'', ''D'', ''F''} above, as the matrix representation makes clear:

:{| border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0"
! !! ''I'' !! ''II'' !! ''III'' !! ''IV'' !! ''V'' !! ''VI'' !! ''VII''
|-
! ''a''
| 1 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 1
|-
! &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;''b''&lt;/span&gt;
| &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; || 0 || 0 || &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; || 0 || 0 || 0
|-

|}

== Finding solutions ==

[[Knuth's Algorithm X|Algorithm X]] is the name [[Donald Knuth]] gave for "the most obvious trial-and-error approach" for finding all solutions to the exact cover problem.&lt;ref name="knuth" /&gt; Technically, Algorithm X is a [[Recursion (computer science)|recursive]], [[Nondeterministic algorithm|nondeterministic]], [[depth-first]], [[backtracking]] [[algorithm]].

When Algorithm X is implemented efficiently using [[Donald Knuth]]'s [[Dancing Links]] technique on a computer, Knuth calls it DLX. DLX uses the matrix representation of the problem, implemented as a series of [[doubly linked list]]s of the 1s of the matrix: each 1 element has a link to the next 1 above, below, to the left, and to the right of itself. (Technically, because the lists are circular, this forms a torus). Because exact cover problems tend to be sparse, this representation is usually much more efficient in both size and processing time required. DLX then uses the [[Dancing Links]] technique to quickly select permutations of rows as possible solutions and to efficiently backtrack (undo) mistaken guesses.&lt;ref name="knuth" /&gt;

== Generalizations ==

In a standard exact cover problem, each constraint must be satisfied exactly once.
It is a simple generalization to relax this requirement slightly and allow for the possibility that some "primary" constraints must be satisfied by ''exactly one'' selection but other "secondary" constraints can be satisfied by ''at most one'' selection.

As Knuth explains, a generalized exact cover problem can be converted to an equivalent exact cover problem by simply appending one row for each secondary column, containing a single 1 in that column.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Knuth explains this simple generalization in his paper "Dancing Links," in particular, in explaining the tetrastick and [[N queens problem|N queens]] problems.&lt;/ref&gt; If in a particular candidate solution a particular secondary column is satisfied, then the added row isn't needed.
But if the secondary column isn't satisfied, as is allowed in the generalized problem but not the standard problem, then the added row can be selected to ensure the column is satisfied.

But Knuth goes on to explain that it is better working with the generalized problem directly, because the generalized algorithm is simpler and faster:
A simple change to his Algorithm X allows secondary columns to be handled directly.

The [[N queens problem]] is an example of a generalized exact cover problem, as the constraints corresponding to the diagonals of the chessboard have a maximum rather than an exact queen count.

== Noteworthy examples ==

Due to its NP-completeness, any problem in NP can be [[reduction (complexity)|reduced]] to exact cover problems, which then can be solved with techniques such as Dancing Links.
However, for some well known problems, the reduction is particularly direct.
For instance, the problem of tiling a board with [[pentominoes]], and solving [[Sudoku]] can both be viewed as exact cover problems.

=== Pentomino tiling ===

{{main|Pentomino}}

The problem of tiling a 60-square board with the 12 different free [[pentominoes]] is an example of an exact cover problem, as [[Donald Knuth]] explains in his paper "Dancing links."&lt;ref name="knuth"&gt;{{cite arxiv | author = [[Donald Knuth|Knuth, Donald]] | title = Dancing links | year = 2000 | eprint = cs/0011047 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, consider the problem of tiling with pentominoes an 8×8 chessboard with the 4 central squares removed:

:{| border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0"
| 11 || 12 || 13 || 14 || 15 || 16 || 17 || 18
|-
| 21 || 22 || 23 || 24 || 25 || 26 || 27 || 28
|-
| 31 || 32 || 33 || 34 || 35 || 36 || 37 || 38
|-
| 41 || 42 || 43 ||    ||    || 46 || 47 || 48
|-
| 51 || 52 || 53 ||    ||    || 56 || 57 || 58
|-
| 61 || 62 || 63 || 64 || 65 || 66 || 67 || 68
|-
| 71 || 72 || 73 || 74 || 75 || 76 || 77 || 78
|-
| 81 || 82 || 83 || 84 || 85 || 86 || 87 || 88
|}

The problem involves two kinds of constraints:
: '''Pentomino:''' For each of the 12 pentominoes, there is the constraint that it must be placed exactly once. Name these constraints after the corresponding pentominoes: F I L P N T U V W X Y Z.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Golomb | first = Solomon W. | authorlink = Solomon W. Golomb |author2=Warren Lushbaugh | title = Polyominoes: Puzzles, Patterns, Problems, and Packings | edition = 2nd | publisher = Princeton University Press | location = Princeton, New Jersey | year = 1994 | isbn = 0-691-02444-8 | page = 7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
: '''Square:''' For each of the 60 squares, there is the constraint that it must be covered by a pentomino exactly once. Name these constraints after the corresponding squares in the board: ''ij'', where ''i'' is the rank and ''j'' is the file.

Thus there are 12+60 = 72 constraints in all.

As both kinds of constraints are "exactly one" constraints, the problem is an exact cover problem.

The problem involves many choices, one for each way to place a pentomino on the board.
It is convenient to consider each choice as satisfying a set of 6 constraints: 1 constraint for the pentomino being placed and 5 constraints for the five squares where it is placed.

In the case of an 8×8 chessboard with the 4 central squares removed, there are 1568 such choices, for example:
* {F, 12, 13, 21, 22, 32}
* {F, 13, 14, 22, 23, 33}
* …
* {I, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15}
* {I, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16}
* …
* {L, 11, 21, 31, 41, 42}
* {L, 12, 22, 32, 42, 43}
* …

One of many solutions of this exact cover problem is the following set of 12 choices:
* {I, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15}
* {N, 16, 26, 27, 37, 47}
* {L, 17, 18, 28, 38, 48}
* {U, 21, 22, 31, 41, 42}
* {X, 23, 32, 33, 34, 43}
* {W, 24, 25, 35, 36, 46}
* {P, 51, 52, 53, 62, 63}
* {F, 56, 64, 65, 66, 75}
* {Z, 57, 58, 67, 76, 77}
* {T, 61, 71, 72, 73, 81}
* {V, 68, 78, 86, 87, 88}
* {Y, 74, 82, 83, 84, 85}

This set of choices corresponds to the following solution to the pentomino tiling problem:

[[File:Pentomino Puzzle Solution 8x8 Minus Center.svg|none|300px]]

A pentomino tiling problem is more naturally viewed as an exact cover problem than an exact hitting set problem, because it is more natural to view each choice as a set of constraints than each constraint as a set of choices.

Each choice relates to just 6 constraints, which are easy to enumerate. On the other hand, each constraint relates to many choices, which are harder to enumerate.

Whether viewed as an exact cover problem or an exact hitting set problem, the matrix representation is the same, having 1568 rows corresponding to choices and 72 columns corresponding to constraints.
Each row contains a single 1 in the column identifying the pentomino and five 1s in the columns identifying the squares covered by the pentomino.

Using the matrix, a computer can find all solutions relatively quickly, for example, using [[Dancing Links]].

=== Sudoku ===

{{pad|1.2em}}''Main articles: [[Sudoku]], [[Sudoku solving algorithms]]''

The problem in [[Sudoku]] is to assign numbers (or digits, values, symbols) to cells (or squares) in a grid so as to satisfy certain constraints.

In the standard 9×9 Sudoku variant, there are four kinds of constraints:
: '''Row-Column:'''  Each intersection of a row and column, i.e, each cell, must contain exactly one number.
: '''Row-Number:'''  Each row must contain each number exactly once
: '''Column-Number:'''  Each column must contain each number exactly once.
: '''Box-Number:'''  Each box must contain each number exactly once.

While the first constraint might seem trivial, it is nevertheless needed to ensure there is only one number per cell.  Intuitively, placing a number into a cell prohibits placing that number in any other cell sharing the same column, row, or box and also prohibits ''placing any other number'' into the now occupied cell.  

Solving Sudoku is an exact cover problem.

More precisely, solving Sudoku is an exact [[hitting set]] problem, which is equivalent to an exact cover problem, when viewed as a problem to select possibilities such that each constraint set contains (i.e., is hit by) exactly one selected possibility.
In the notation above for the (generalized) exact cover problem, ''X'' is the set of possibilities, ''Y'' is a set of constraint sets, and ''R'' is the binary relation "is contained in."

Each possible assignment of a particular number to a particular cell is a '''possibility''' (or candidate).
When Sudoku is played with pencil and paper, possibilities are often called pencil marks.

In the standard 9×9 Sudoku variant, in which each of 9×9 cells is assigned one of 9 numbers, there are 9×9×9=729 possibilities.
Using obvious notation for rows, columns and numbers, the possibilities can be labeled
: R1C1#1, R1C1#2, …, R9C9#9.

The fact that each kind of constraint involves exactly one of something is what makes Sudoku an exact hitting set problem.
The constraints can be represented by '''constraint sets'''.
The problem is to select possibilities such that each constraint set contains (i.e., is hit by) exactly one selected possibility.

In the standard 9×9 Sudoku variant, there are four kinds of constraints sets corresponding to the four kinds of constraints:

: '''Row-Column:''' A row-column constraint set contains all the possibilities for the intersection of a particular row and column, i.e., for a cell. For example, the constraint set for row 1 and column 1, which can be labeled R1C1, contains the 9 possibilities for row 1 and column 1 but different numbers:
::  R1C1 = { R1C1#1, R1C1#2, R1C1#3, R1C1#4, R1C1#5, R1C1#6, R1C1#7, R1C1#8, R1C1#9 }.

: '''Row-Number:''' A row-number constraint set contains all the possibilities for a particular row and number. For example, the constraint set for row 1 and number 1, which can be labeled R1#1, contains the 9 possibilities for row 1 and number 1 but different columns:
:: R1#1 = { R1C1#1, R1C2#1, R1C3#1, R1C4#1, R1C5#1, R1C6#1, R1C7#1, R1C8#1, R1C9#1 }.

: '''Column-Number:''' A column-number constraint set contains all the possibilities for a particular column and number. For example, the constraint set for column 1 and number 1, which can be labeled C1#1, contains the 9 possibilities for column 1 and number 1 but different rows:
:: C1#1 = { R1C1#1, R2C1#1, R3C1#1, R4C1#1, R5C1#1, R6C1#1, R7C1#1, R8C1#1, R9C1#1 }.

: '''Box-Number:''' A box-number constraint set contains all the possibilities for a particular box and number. For example, the constraint set for box 1 (in the upper lefthand corner) and number 1, which can be labeled B1#1, contains the 9 possibilities for the cells in box 1 and number 1:
:: B1#1 = { R1C1#1, R1C2#1, R1C3#1, R2C1#1, R2C2#1, R2C3#1, R3C1#1, R3C2#1, R3C3#1 }.

Since there are 9 rows, 9 columns, 9 boxes and 9 numbers, there are 9×9=81 row-column constraint sets, 9×9=81 row-number constraint sets,  9×9=81 column-number constraint sets,  and 9×9=81 box-number constraint sets: 81+81+81+81=324 constraint sets in all.

In brief, the standard 9×9 Sudoku variant is an exact hitting set problem with 729 possibilities and 324 constraint sets.
Thus the problem can be represented by a 729×324 matrix.

Although it is difficult to present the entire 729×324 matrix, the general nature of the matrix can be seen from several snapshots:

The [http://www.stolaf.edu/people/hansonr/sudoku/exactcovermatrix.htm complete 729×324 matrix] is available from Bob Hanson.

Note that the set of possibilities R''x''C''y''#''z'' can be arranged as a 9×9×9 cube in a 3-dimensional space with coordinates ''x'', ''y'', and ''z''.
Then each row R''x'', column C''y'', or number #''z'' is a 9×9×1 "slice" of possibilities; each box B''w'' is a 9x3×3 "tube" of possibilities; each row-column constraint set R''x''C''y'', row-number constraint set R''x''#''z'', or column-number constraint set C''y''#''z'' is a 9x1×1 "strip" of possibilities; each box-number constraint set B''w''#''z'' is a 3x3×1 "square" of possibilities; and each possibility R''x''C''y''#''z'' is a 1x1×1 "cubie" consisting of a single possibility.
Moreover, each constraint set or possibility is the [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of the component sets.
For example, R1C2#3 = R1 ∩ C2 ∩ #3, where ∩ denotes set intersection.

Although other Sudoku variations have different numbers of rows, columns, numbers and/or different kinds of constraints, they all involve possibilities and constraint sets, and thus can be seen as exact hitting set problems.

=== ''N'' queens problem ===
 {{main|N queens problem}}
 {{Expand section|date=July 2008}}

The [[N queens problem|''N'' queens problem]] is an example of a generalized exact cover problem.&lt;ref name="knuth"/&gt; The problem involves four kinds of constraints:
: '''Rank:''' For each of the ''N'' ranks, there must be exactly one queen.
: '''File:''' For each of the ''N'' files, there must be exactly one queen.
: '''Diagonals:''' For each of the 2''N''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 diagonals, there must be at most one queen.
: '''Reverse diagonals:''' For each of the 2''N''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 reverse diagonals, there must be at most one queen.

Note that the 2''N'' rank and file constraints form the primary constraints, while the 4''N''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2 diagonal and reverse diagonals form the secondary constraints. Further, because each of first and last diagonal and reverse diagonals involves only one square on the chessboard, these can be omitted and thus one can reduce the number of secondary constraints to 4''N''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;6. The matrix for the ''N'' queens problem then has ''N''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; rows and 6''N''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;6 columns, each row for a possible queen placement on each square on the chessboard, and each column for each constraint.

The '''German Research Institute for Public Administration''' (''GRIP'', [[German language|German]]: ''Deutsches Forschungsinstitut für öffentliche Verwaltung, FÖV'') is a non-university [[research institute]] for [[public administration]] located in [[Speyer]], [[Rhineland Palatinate]], [[Germany]]. Founded in 1976 as an organizationally independent institution under the jurisdiction of the [[List of Ministers-President of Rhineland-Palatinate|Minister-President of Rhineland-Palatinate]], it is largely integrated in, and maintains a strategic partnership with the [[German University of Administrative Sciences Speyer]]. As an "institution of nationwide interest" it forms part of the [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Scientific Community]] and is thus funded equally by the [[Federal Republic of Germany|Federal Republic]]  and [[States of Germany|all 16 German states]]. At present the institute has 26 ordinary, 19 corresponding and two honorary [[fellow]]s from Germany and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nesse.fr/nesse/activities/research-mapping/educational-governance/institutions/forschungsinstitut-fur-offentliche-verwaltung-bei-der-deutschen-hochschule-fur-verwaltungswissenschaften-speyer-the-research-institute-for-public-administration-at-the-german-university-of-administrative-sciences-speyer-fov

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3396">'''H.H. Scott, Inc.''' was a major manufacturer of [[hi-fi]] equipment in the U.S. It was founded in 1947 by [[Hermon Hosmer Scott]] in [[Maynard, Massachusetts]].

== History ==
H.H. Scott sold some of the earliest [[FM broadcasting|FM stereo]] multiplex tuners and receivers, with some units sold as kits. The company's competition included brands like [[The Fisher (electronics manufacturer)|Fisher]], [[Marantz]], [[McIntosh Laboratory|McIntosh]], and [[Harman Kardon]]. The 1961 Model 350 was the first FM stereo multiplex tuner sold in the US. H.H. Scott was involved in early stereo multiplex testing with radio station [[WCRB]] in Boston, one of the first three U.S. FM stations to broadcast in multiplex stereo. In 1985, the brand was purchased by [[Emerson Electronics]].&lt;ref name="Holmes2013"&gt;{{citation|author=Thom Holmes|title=The Routledge Guide to Music Technology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qvCNAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT314|date=18 October 2013|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-135-47787-5|pages=314–|authormask=|format=|origyear=|oclc=|doi=|bibcode=|id=|quote=|laysummary=|laydate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CzinkotaRonkainen2009"&gt;{{citation|author1=Michael Czinkota|author2=IIkka Ronkainen|title=Emerging Trends, Threats and Opportunities in International Marketing: What Executives Need to Know|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ir9ncyTsTB4C&amp;pg=PA271|date=1 November 2009|publisher=Business Expert Press|isbn=978-1-60649-036-5|pages=271–|authormask=|format=|origyear=|oclc=|doi=|bibcode=|id=|quote=|laysummary=|laydate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Earlier Similar Name==

Between 1924 and 1945, E. H. Scott built hand-made radios.  These were expensive works of art with chrome-plated chassis, for only the upper crust to afford.  This company had no connection to H. H. Scott although ironically H. H. Scott sold his first product, the Dynaural Noise Suppressor, as an optional accessory on the E. H. Scott 800B made just after WW2.

[[File:Humanzoogermany.jpg|upright|thumb|400px|An ad for a "Peoples Show" (''Völkerschau'') in [[Stuttgart]] (Germany), 1928]]
'''Human zoos''', also called '''ethnological expositions''', were 19th-, 20th-, and 21st-century public exhibitions of humans, usually in a so-called natural or primitive state. The displays often emphasized the cultural differences between Europeans of [[Western world|Western civilization]] and non-European peoples or with other Europeans who practiced a lifestyle deemed more primitive. Some of them placed [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] populations in a continuum somewhere between the [[great ape]]s and Europeans. Ethnological expositions have been extensively criticized and ascertained as highly degrading and [[Racism|racist]], depending on the show and individuals involved.

== Human zoos in Germany ==

{{refimprove section|date=June 2018}}
In the late 19th century German ethnographic museums&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Objects of Culture Ethnology and Ethnographic Museums in Imperial Germany|last=H. Glenn|first=Penny|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; were an attempt at empirical study of human culture. They contained artifacts from cultures around the world organized by continent allowing visitors to see the similarities and differences between the groups and form their own ideas. The ethnographic museums of Germany were explicitly designed to steer away from projecting certain principles or instructing its viewers to interpret the material in a particular manner. They were instead left open for museum guests to form their own opinions.

The directors of Germany's ethnographic museums intended to create a unifying history of mankind,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; to show how humans had progressed to the cosmopolitan creatures that walked the halls of these museums. Imperialism influenced the supporters, visitors, and collectors of these museums, the displays, directions, and political rhetoric.

Ethnology studies in Germany took a new approach in the 1870s as human displays were incorporated into zoos. These exhibits were lauded as educational to the general population by the scientific community of the time, because they were informing of the way people lived across the world. Very quickly the exhibits were used as a way to show that Europeans had evolved into a superior cosmopolitan life.

As Ethnogenic expositions were discontinued in Germany around 1931,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.com/en/human-zoos-when-people-were-the-exhibits/a-37748193 Ethnogenic expositions were discontinued in Germany around 1931]&lt;/ref&gt; there were many repercussions for the performers. Many of the people brought from their homelands to work in the exhibits had created families in Germany, and there were many children that had been born in Germany. Once they no longer worked in the zoos or for performance acts these people were stuck living in Germany where they had no rights and were harshly discriminated against. During the rise of the Nazi party the foreign actors in these stage shows were typically able to stay out of concentration camps because there were so few of them that the Nazis did not see them as a real threat.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;“‘You Better Go Back to Africa’| Interview.” ''"You Better Go Back to Africa"| Interview'', DW English, 18 June 2017, www.youtube.com/watch?v=baGXUsOKBcU.&lt;/ref&gt; Although they were able to avoid concentration camps, they were not able to participate in German life as citizens of ethnically German origin could. The [[Hitler Youth]] did not allow children of foreign parents to participate, and adults were rejected as German soldiers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Many ended up working in war industry factories or foreign laborer camps.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; After [[World War II|WWII]] ended, racism in Germany became more concealed or invisible but did not go away. Many people of foreign descent intended to leave after the war, but because of their German nationality, it was difficult for them to emigrate.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Key influences ===
[[Carl Hagenbeck]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Savages and Beasts: The Birth of the Modern Zoo|last=Rothfels|first=Nigel|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a German exotic animal businessman, who became famous for his conquering of the animal trade market during the mid to late 1800’s. Due to the costs of acquiring and keeping animals, the financial implications started to worry Hagenbeck, and he began looking for other ways to alleviate the company’s monetary strains. [[Heinrich Leutemann]], an old friend of Hagenbeck suggested bringing along the people from the foreign lands to accompany the animals. The idea struck Hagenbeck as brilliant and he had a group of [[Sami people|Laplander]]s accompany his next shipment of Reindeer. They set up traditional houses and went about their business as usual on the Hagenbeck property. The display was so successful that Carl was organizing his second show before the first was over. Although the concept of parading peoples captured from conquered lands goes back to the Romans, Hagenbeck claimed to have the first show’s displaying “cultures” from foreign lands. Carl Hagenbeck continued to bring indigenous people along with the animals he was importing from across the globe. The people would come with their hunting equipment, homes, and other facets of their daily life. Hagenbeck’s displays evolved in complexity as the years went by. In 1876 Hagenbeck had a group of 6 [[Sami people|Sami]] accompany a herd of reindeer, and by 1874 his acts included close to 67 men, women, and children in his ''Ceylon'' show performing with 25 elephants. The performances also expanded from showing every day activities such as milking reindeer and building huts, to displaying some of the more extravagant parts of the cultures such as magicians, jugglers, and devil dancers.

[[File:Baartman.jpg|thumb|upright|A caricature of [[Saartjie Baartman]], called the ''Hottentot Venus''. Born to a [[Khoisan]] family, she was displayed in London in the early 19th century.]]
The notion of the human curiosity has a history at least as long as [[History of colonialism|colonialism]]. For instance, in the [[Western Hemisphere]], one of the earliest-known [[zoo]]s, that of [[Moctezuma II|Moctezuma]] in Mexico, consisted not only of a vast collection of animals, but also exhibited humans, for example, dwarves, albinos and hunchbacks.&lt;ref&gt;Mullan, Bob and Marvin Garry, ''Zoo culture: The book about watching people watch animals'', [[University of Illinois Press]], [[Urbana, Illinois]], Second edition, 1998, p.32. {{ISBN|0-252-06762-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Renaissance]], the [[Medici]] developed a large [[menagerie]] in the Vatican.
In the 16th century, Cardinal [[Ippolito de' Medici|Hippolytus Medici]] had a collection of people of different races as well as exotic animals.
He is reported as having a troupe of so-called Savages, speaking over twenty languages; there were also Moors, Tartars, Indians, Turks and Africans.&lt;ref&gt;Mullan, Bob and Marvin Garry, ''Zoo culture: The book about watching people watch animals'', [[University of Illinois Press]], [[Urbana, Illinois]], Second edition, 1998, p.98. {{ISBN|0-252-06762-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Maximo and Bartola CDV by Edmonds of Southampton, c1867.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Maximo and Bartola, c. 1867]] One of the first modern public human exhibitions was [[P. T. Barnum|P.T. Barnum]]'s exhibition of [[Joice Heth]] on February 25, 1835&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/joiceheth.html|title=The Museum of Hoaxes|work=Museum of Hoaxes|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, subsequently, the [[Conjoined twins|Siamese twins]] [[Chang and Eng Bunker]]. These exhibitions were common in [[freak show]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://migs.concordia.ca/occpapers/zoo.htm "On A Neglected Aspect Of Western Racism"] by Kurt Jonassohn, December 2000, Montreal Institute for Genocide and Human Rights Studies&lt;/ref&gt; Another famous example was that of [[Saartjie Baartman]] of the [[Nama people|Namaqua]], often referred to as the Hottentot Venus, who was displayed in London and France until her death in 1815.

During the 1850s, [[Maximo and Bartola]], two [[microcephalic]] children from El Salvador, were exhibited in the US and Europe under the names Aztec Children and Aztec Lilliputians.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roberto Aguirre]], ''Informal Empire: Mexico And Central America In Victorian Culture'', Univ. of Minnesota Press, 2004, ch. 4&lt;/ref&gt;  However, human zoos would become common only in the 1870s in the midst of the [[New Imperialism]] period.

== 1870s to the 1930s ==

In the 1870s, exhibitions of exotic populations became popular in various countries. Human zoos could be found in [[Paris]], [[Hamburg]], [[Antwerp]], [[Barcelona]], [[London]], [[Milan]], and [[New York City]]. [[Carl Hagenbeck]], a merchant in wild animals and future entrepreneur of many zoos in Europe, decided in 1874 to exhibit [[Samoans|Samoan]] and [[Sami people]] as "purely natural" populations. In 1876, he sent a collaborator to the Egyptian [[Sudan]] to bring back some wild beasts and [[Nubians]]. The Nubian exhibit was very successful in Europe and toured Paris, London, and [[Berlin]]. In 1880, Hagenbeck dispatched an agent to Labrador to secure a number of Esquimaux (Eskimo / [[Inuit]]) from the moravian mission of Hebron; these Inuit were exhibited in his [[Hamburg Tierpark]]. Other ethnological expositions included Egyptian and Bedouin mock settlements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Belvedere: Zeitschrift für bildende Kunst, Volume 12|date=2006|publisher=Österreichische Galerie Belvedere|page=102|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=nChMAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hagenbeck would also employ agents to take part in his ethnological exhibits, with the aim of exposing his audience to various different subsistence modes and lifestyles. Among these hired workers were Hersi Egeh and his lineage from Berbera in present-day northwestern Somalia, who in the process accumulated much wealth, which they later reinvested in real estate in their homeland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Africana Publishing Company|journal=The International Journal of African Historical Studies|date=1985|page=20|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=NXgMAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The viceroy of India likewise gave Hagenbeck permission to hire local inhabitants for an exhibit, on the condition that Hagenbeck would first have to deposit funds into the royal treasury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Janet M.|title=The Circus Age: Culture and Society under the American Big Top|date=2003|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|isbn=0807861499|page=198|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=FDzqCQAAQBAJ|accessdate=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Albert Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire|Geoffroy de Saint-Hilaire]], director of the [[Jardin d'acclimatation]], decided in 1877 to organize two ethnological spectacles that presented Nubians and [[Inuit]]. That year, the audience of the Jardin d'acclimatation' doubled to one million. Between 1877 and 1912, approximately thirty ethnological exhibitions were presented at the ''Jardin zoologique d'acclimatation''.

Both the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|1878]] and the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|1889 Parisian World's Fair]] presented a Negro Village (''village nègre''). Visited by 28 million people, the 1889 World's Fair displayed 400 indigenous people as the major attraction. The 1900 World's Fair presented the famous [[diorama]] living in [[Madagascar]], while the [[Colonial exhibition|Colonial Exhibitions]] in [[Marseille]]s (1906 and 1922) and in Paris (1907 and 1931) also displayed humans in cages, often nude or semi-nude. The [[Paris Colonial Exposition|1931 exhibition in Paris]] was so successful that 34 million people attended it in six months, while a smaller counter-exhibition entitled ''The Truth on the Colonies'', organized by the [[French Communist Party|Communist Party]], attracted very few visitors—in the first room, it recalled [[Albert Londres]] and [[André Gide]]'s critiques of [[unfree labour|forced labour]] in the colonies. Nomadic [[Senegal|Senegalese Villages]] were also presented.

In 1883, native people of [[Suriname]] were displayed in the [[Internationale Koloniale en Uitvoerhandel Tentoonstelling|International Colonial and Export Exhibition]] in Amsterdam, held behind the [[Rijksmuseum]].

In the late 1800s, Hagenbeck organized exhibitions of indigenous populations from various parts of the globe. He staged a public display in 1886 of [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] autochthones from the [[Sri Lanka]]. In 1893/1894, he also put together an exhibition of [[Sami people|Sami]]/Lapps in [[Hamburg]]-Saint Paul.

At the 1901 [[Pan-American Exposition]]&lt;ref&gt;See [[Charles Dudley Arnold]]'s [http://www.pdphotoblog.com/category/native-american photo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705021556/http://www.pdphotoblog.com/category/native-american |date=2008-07-05 }} similar human displays had been seen of six men dressed in Native-American costume, in front and on top of a reconstruction of a Six-Nations Long House.&lt;/ref&gt; and at the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]], where [[Little Egypt (dancer)|Little Egypt]] performed [[bellydance]], and where the photographers [[Charles Dudley Arnold]] and [[Harlow Higginbotham]] took depreciative photos, presenting indigenous people as catalogue of "types", along with sarcastic legends.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Maxell, "Montrer l'Autre: Franz Boas et les soeurs Gerhard", in ''Zoos humains.

In 1896, to increase the number of visitors, the [[Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden|Cincinnati Zoo]] invited one hundred Sioux Native Americans to establish a village at the site. The Sioux lived at the zoo for three months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=685 Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden], Ohio Historical Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1904, [[Apache]]s and [[Igorot]]s (from the Philippines) were displayed at the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition|Saint Louis World Fair]] in association with the [[1904 Summer Olympics]]. The US had just acquired, following the [[Spanish–American War]], new territories such as [[Guam]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Puerto Rico]], allowing them to "display" some of the native inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Remembering St. Louis, 1904: A World on Display and Bontoc Eulogy|publisher=[[Syracuse University]]|author=Jim Zwick|date=March 4, 1996|accessdate=2007-05-25|url=http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/Bontoc.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Rev. [[Sequoyah Ade]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;To further illustrate the indignities heaped upon the [[Philippines|Philippine]] people following their eventual loss to the Americans, the United States made the Philippine campaign the centrepoint of the 1904 World's Fair held that year in St. Louis, MI [sic]. In what was enthusiastically termed a "parade of evolutionary progress," visitors could inspect the "primitives" that represented the counterbalance to "Civilisation" justifying [[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling]]'s poem "[[The White Man's Burden]]". [[Pygmy|Pygmies]] from New Guinea and Africa, who were later displayed in the Primate section of the [[Bronx Zoo]], were paraded next to American Indians such as Apache warrior [[Geronimo]], who sold his autograph. But the main draw was the Philippine exhibition complete with full size replicas of Indigenous living quarters erected to exhibit the inherent backwardness of the Philippine people. The purpose was to highlight both the "civilising" influence of American rule and the economic potential of the island chains' natural resources on the heels of the [[Philippine–American War]]. It was, reportedly, the largest specific Aboriginal exhibition displayed in the exposition. As one pleased visitor commented, the human zoo exhibition displayed "the race narrative of odd peoples who mark time while the world advances, and of savages made, by American methods, into civilized workers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Passions of Suzie Wong Revisited, by Rev.

In 1906, [[Madison Grant]]—socialite, [[eugenics|eugenicist]], amateur [[anthropology|anthropologist]], and head of the [[New York Zoological Society]]—had [[Congo Pygmies|Congolese pygmy]] [[Ota Benga]] put on display at the Bronx Zoo in New York City alongside [[ape]]s and other animals. At the behest of Grant, the zoo director [[William Temple Hornaday|William Hornaday]] placed Benga displayed in a cage with the chimpanzees, then with an [[orangutan]] named Dohong, and a parrot, and labeled him ''The Missing Link'', suggesting that in [[evolution]]ary terms Africans like Benga were closer to apes than were Europeans. It triggered protests from the city's clergymen, but the public reportedly flocked to see it.&lt;ref name=NYTBenga/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, Phillips Verner and Blume, Harvey. ''Ota Benga: The Pygmy in the Zoo''. St. Martins Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Friedländer.plakat.8.jpg|thumb|upright|Ad for a [[Carl Hagenbeck]] show (1886)]]

Benga shot targets with a bow and arrow, wove twine, and wrestled with an orangutan. Although, according to ''The New York Times'', "few expressed audible objection to the sight of a human being in a cage with monkeys as companions", controversy erupted as black clergymen in the city took great offense. "Our race, we think, is depressed enough, without exhibiting one of us with the apes", said the Reverend James H. Gordon, superintendent of the Howard Colored Orphan Asylum in Brooklyn. "We think we are worthy of being considered human beings, with souls."&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/06/nyregion/thecity/06zoo.html?ex=1155009600&amp;en=c2cc9b84edc068cd&amp;ei=5087%0A|title=The Scandal at the Zoo|last=Keller|first=Mitch|date=2006-08-06|work=New York Times|accessdate=2008-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mayor of New York City|New York City Mayor]] [[George B. McClellan Jr.]] refused to meet with the clergymen, drawing the praise of Hornaday, who wrote to him: "When the history of the Zoological Park is written, this incident will form its most amusing passage."&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;

As the controversy continued, Hornaday remained unapologetic, insisting that his only intention was to put on an ethnological exhibition. In another letter, he said that he and Grant—who ten years later would publish the racist tract ''[[The Passing of the Great Race]]''—considered it "imperative that the society should not even seem to be dictated to" by the black clergymen.&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;

On Monday, September 8, 1906, after just two days, Hornaday decided to close the exhibition, and Benga could be found walking the zoo grounds, often followed by a crowd "howling, jeering and yelling."&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;

In 1925, a display at [[Belle Vue Zoo]] in [[Manchester]], England, was entitled "Cannibals" and featured black Africans depicted as savages.&lt;ref&gt;Paul A. Rees, ''An Introduction to Zoo Biology and Management'', [[Wiley-Blackwell]], John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd., [[Chichester]] ([[West Sussex]]), 2011, p.44. {{ISBN|978-1-4051-9349-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1930s, a new kind of human zoo appeared in America, nude shows masquerading as education. These included the [[Zoro Garden Nudist Colony]] at the Pacific International Exposition in San Diego, California (1935-6) and the Sally Rand Nude Ranch at the [[Golden Gate International Exposition]] in San Francisco (1939). The former was supposedly a real [[nudist colony]], which used hired performers instead of actual nudists. The latter featured nude women performing in western attire. The Golden Gate fair also featured a "Greenwich Village" show, described in the Official Guide Book as “Model artists’ colony and revue theatre.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfmuseum.org/bio/rand.html "Sally Rand and The Music Box", Virtual Museum of San Francisco]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2007, pygmy performers at the Festival of Pan-African Music (Fespam) were housed at a zoo in [[Brazzaville]], [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]].  Although members of the group of twenty people - among them an infant, age three-months - were not officially on display, it was necessary for them to "collect firewood in the zoo to cook their food, and [they] were being stared at and filmed by tourists and passers-by".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/6898241.stm|title=Pygmy artists housed in Congo zoo|author=[[BBC News]]|date=2007-07-13|accessdate=2008-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Josephus Augustinus Brentano''' (1753 – 1821) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] art collector.

Brentano was born in [[Amsterdam]] and became a merchant in trade with the [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]] and the [[Dutch West India Company|WIC]]. He was not unsuccessful and retired early in a canal mansion on the [[Herengracht]] (today nr. 544). He formed a large art cabinet there that ''competed'' with the one formed by [[Jan Gildemeester]] further down the canal. Like Gildemeester, he hired [[Adriaan de Lelie]] to portray him among his prize paintings. He started the collection to ''encourage artists in their field'', according to [[Roeland van Eynden]] and [[Adriaan van der Willigen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/retroboeken/vaderlandsche_schilderkunst/#source=III&amp;page=481 Brentano] in Van Eynden and Van der Willigen's ''[[Geschiedenis der Vaderlandsche Schilderkunst]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Brentano died a bachelor in [[Amsterdam]] and his collection was sold to found a home for poor elderly men.

[[File:Liber Physiognomiae Michael Scot.jpg|thumb|right|The first page of a 1505 copy of the ''Liber Physiognomiae'', written by the Scottish mathematician, philosopher, and scholar [[Michael Scot]] sometime in the early 13th century.]]
'''''Liber physiognomiae''''' ({{IPA-la|lī.ber fi.si.oː.noː.mi.ae̯|lang}}; '''''The Book of Physiognomy'''''){{#tag:ref|This work is also known as ''De physiognomia et de hominis procreatione'' ({{IPA-la|deː fi.si.oː.noː.mi.a ɛt deː ˈhoː.mɪ.nɪs proː.kreː.aː.ti.oː.nɛ|lang}}; ''Concerning Physiognomy and Human Procreation'') and the ''Physionomia''. During the [[Renaissance]] it was often referred to as ''De secretis nature''&lt;!-- In Medieval Latin, "ae" was often simplified to "e"; as such, "nature" and NOT "naturae" is the correct spelling --&gt; ({{IPA-la|deː seːˈkreː.tīs naː.tu.rɛ|lang}}; ''Concerning the Secrets of Nature'').&lt;ref&gt;[[#Resnick|Resnick (2012)]], p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;|group="nb"}} is a work by the Scottish mathematician, philosopher, and scholar [[Michael Scot]] concerning [[physiognomy]]; the work is also the final book of a trilogy known as the ''[[Liber introductorius]]''. The ''Liber physiognomiae'' itself is divided into three sections, which deal with various concepts like procreation, generation, dream interpretation, and physiognomy proper.

The information found in the ''Liber physiognomiae'' seems to have been derived largely from Arabic copies of Aristotelian and [[Pseudo-Aristotle|Pseudo-Aristotelian]] works. The work was written in the early 13th century for [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], but was first officially printed in 1477. ''Liber physiognomiae'' would go on to be very popular, and would be reprinted many times. Scot's work had a major influence on physiognomy itself, and heavily affected how it would be approached and applied in the future.

== Background ==

''Liber physiognomiae'' was written by the Scottish mathematician [[Michael Scot]] (AD 1175 – c. 1232) and is the final entry in a divination-centered trilogy, collectively titled the ''[[Liber introductorius]]'' (''The Great Introductory Book'').{{#tag:ref|Some sources refer to the first book in the trilogy as the ''Liber introductorius'',&lt;ref&gt;Examples includes: [[#Edwards|Edwards (1985)]]; [[#Kay|Kay (1985)]], p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas other sources specify that the first book is the ''Liber quatuor distinctionum'' and that ''Liber introductorius'' is the name of the trilogy as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Examples include: [[#Meyer|Meyer (2010)]]; [[#Pick|Pick (1998)]], p. 96; [[#Resnick|Resnick (2012)]], p. 15, note 10.&lt;/ref&gt;|group="nb"}} This trilogy also includes the ''Liber quatuor distinctionum'' (''The Book of the Four Distinctions'') and the ''Liber particularis'' (''The Singular Book'').&lt;ref name=resnicknote&gt;[[#Resnick|Resnick (2012)]], p. 15, note 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kay5&gt;[[#Kay|Kay (1985)]], p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kay|Kay (1985)]], p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Scott|Scott &amp; Marketos (2014)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

|source =—''Liber physiognomiae'', Introduction, translated by Lynn Thorndike&lt;ref name="thorn87" /&gt;}}

''Liber physiognomiae'', as the title suggests, concerns [[physiognomy]], or a technique by which a person's character or personality is deduced based on their outer appearance. Scot refers to this as a "doctrine of salvation" (''Phisionomia est doctrina salutis''), as it easily allows one to determine if a person is virtuous or evil.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Resnick|Resnick (2012)]], p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Resnick|Resnick (2012)]], p. 16, note 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The book is relatively short, comprising about sixty [[octavo]] pages.&lt;ref name=kay5 /&gt; The work is usually divided into around one hundred chapters, with the number of chapters and their divisions differing greatly depending on what manuscript is being consulted.&lt;ref name=thorn87&gt;[[#Thorndike|Thorndike (1965)]], p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the chapter headings vary across manuscripts, scholars are in agreement that the work is made up of three distinct sections. The first of these deals with the concepts of procreation and generation, largely according to the doctrines of [[Aristotle]] and [[Galen]].&lt;ref name=encyclopedia&gt;[[#Baynes|Baynes &amp; Smith (1891)]], p. 491.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=contents&gt;[[#Brown|Brown (1897)]], p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; This section opens by stressing the important influence of the stars before it deals with topics concerning human [[sexual intercourse]]. The book then moves onto the topics of conception and birth, and the author then explores the physical signs of pregnancy. The final two chapters of this section deal with animals; the penultimate chapter focuses on "animals ''in genere et in specie''" (i.e. in regards to genus and species),{{#tag:ref|In [[Aristotle's biology|his biology]], Aristotle used the term γένος (génos) to mean a general 'kind' and εἶδος (eidos) to mean a specific [[Hylomorphism|form]] within a kind. For instance, "bird" would be a ''génos'', whereas an eagle would be an ''eidos''. ''Génos''and ''eidos'' were later translated into Latin as "genus" and "species", though they do not correspond to the [[Linnean taxonomy|Linnean terms]] thus named.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Leroi|Leroi (2014)]], pp. 88{{en dash}}90.&lt;/ref&gt; Given that Scot was writing before the Linnean terms were developed, his use of the words "genus" and "species" retain their Aristotelian meanings.|group="nb"}} while the final details an idiosyncratic system for differentiating the various types of animals.&lt;ref name=thorn8788&gt;[[#Thorndike|Thorndike (1965)]], pp. 87{{en dash}}88.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second section begins to focus specifically on physiognomy, considering different organs and body regions that index the "character and faculties" of individuals.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia /&gt;&lt;ref name=contents /&gt;&lt;ref name=thorn88&gt;[[#Thorndike|Thorndike (1965)]], p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Early chapters in this portion of the book are written in a medical style, and they detail signs in regards to "temperate and healthy bod[ies] ... repletion of bad [[Humorism|humours]] and excess of blood, cholera, phlegm, and melancholy", before turning to particular sections of the body.&lt;ref name=thorn88 /&gt; Several following chapters discuss [[Dream interpretation|dreams and their meanings]]. Scot argues that dreams are: true or false; represent past, present, or future events; or are entirely meaningless.&lt;ref name=thorn89&gt;[[#Thorndike|Thorndike (1965)]], p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; The second section comes to an end with chapters concerning [[augury|auguries]] and sneezes, respectively.&lt;ref name=thorn90&gt;[[#Thorndike|Thorndike (1965)]], p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third and final section covers body parts, and explicates what the characteristics of these portions may reveal about the nature of the person in question.&lt;ref name=contents /&gt; The final chapter in this section warns the would-be physiognomist to withhold judgement based solely on one part of their body, but rather to "tend always to a general judgement based on the majority of all [the person's] members."&lt;ref name=thorn91&gt;[[#Thorndike|Thorndike (1965)]], p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; This is because another part which has not been consulted may readily counter a conclusion suggested by a part that has. Scot also argues that a physiognomist should take into account a person's "age, long residence in one place, long social usage, excessive prevalence of the humours of his complexion beyond what is customary, accidental sickness, violence, accidents contrary to nature, and a defect of one of the five natural senses."&lt;ref name=thorn91 /&gt;

=== Sources ===

According to the physiognomy scholar Martin Porter, the ''Liber physiognomiae'' is a "distinctly Aristotelian" compendium of "the more Arabic influenced 'medical' aspects of natural philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Porter|Porter (2005)]], p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Porter|Porter (2005)]], p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, it seems likely that Scot made use of several Aristotelian and [[Pseudo-Aristotle|Pseudo-Aristotelian]] works in the writing of the ''Liber physiognomiae'', many of which were derived from Arabic copies. The first of these is an Arabic translation of the ''[[History of Animals|Historia Animalium]]''.&lt;ref name=brown38 /&gt; The second is the ''[[Secretum Secretorum|Kitāb Sirr al-Asrār]]'' ({{lang-ar|كتاب سر الأسرار}}; known in Latin as the ''Secreta Secretorum''), an Arabic text that purports to be a letter from Aristotle to his student [[Alexander the Great]] on a range of topics, including physiognomy.&lt;ref name=brown3237&gt;[[#Brown|Brown (1897)]], pp. 32{{en dash}}37.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|James Wood Brown argues it is "beyond question" that Scot used the Latin-translation of this text, the ''Secretum Secretorum'', in writing the ''Liber physiognomiae''; Haskins, on the other hand, argues that Scot's work is related to the Latin version only "through a common Arabic source".&lt;ref name=haskins262 /&gt;&lt;ref name=brown3237 /&gt; Lynn Thorndike seems to favor Haskins hypothesis, aruging "Michael, himself a translator of long standing from the Arabic, could have made direct use of the Arabic text ... Other evidence makes it more likely that Philip knew of Michael's ''Physiognomy'' and that his translation of ''Secreta secretorum'' was subsequent to it."&lt;ref name="thorn91" /&gt;|group="nb"}} The third of these works is ''[[Physiognomonics]]'', also [[Pseudepigrapha|attributed]] to Aristotle and, as the title suggests, also about physiognomy; the influence of this Pseudo-Aristotelian work, according to Haskins, is "limited to the preface" of the ''Liber physiognomiae''.&lt;ref name=haskins262 /&gt;&lt;ref name=brown38&gt;[[#Brown|Brown (1897)]], p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Scot probably used the original Greek version of ''Physiognomonics'' to write his book.{{#tag:ref|Because it is believed that the first Latin version of the ''Physiognomonics'' was translated directly from the original Greek by Bartholomew of Messina several years after Scot's ''Liber physiognomiae'' was written,&lt;ref name=brown38 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Knuuttila|Knuuttila &amp; Sihvola (2013)]], p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; and because no Arabic translation of the work is known to exist, the fact that several passages in Scot's book correspond to passages from Bartholomew of Messina's Latin version of the ''Physiognomonics'' suggests that the two were working from the same (Greek) source. This is evidence that Scot had a working knowledge of Greek.&lt;ref name=brown38 /&gt;|group="nb"}} The historian [[Charles Homer Haskins]] argues that the ''Liber physiognomiae'' also "makes free use" of [[Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi]] (also known as Rhazes) and shows "some affinities" with [[Trotula]] texts and writers of the [[Schola Medica Salernitana]] (a [[medical school]] located in the Italian town of [[Salerno]]).&lt;ref name=haskins262&gt;[[#Haskins|Haskins (1921)]], p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publication history and popularity ==

[[File:Frederick II and eagle.jpg|thumb|upright|The work was dedicated to [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]].]]

The work was written sometime in the early 13th century, and is explicitly dedicated to [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]]. The scholar James Wood Brown argues that the book was likely written for the soon-to-be [[Holy Roman Emperor]] Frederick II in AD 1209 on the occasion of his wedding to [[Constance of Aragon]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brown|Brown (1897)]], p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Brown also adds, "No date suits this publication so well as 1209, and nothing but the urgent desire of Court and people that the marriage should prove fruitful can explain, one might add excuse, some passages of almost [[Fescennine Verses|fescennine]] license which it contains."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brown|Brown (1897)]], pp. 30{{en dash}}31.&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophy and religion scholar Irven Resnick argues that the work was given to Frederick so that "the emperor [might be able] to distinguish, from outward appearances, trustworthy and wise counselors from their opposite numbers."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Resnick|Resnick (2012)]], pp. 15{{en dash}}16.&lt;/ref&gt;

While manuscripts of the ''Liber quatuor distinctionum'' and the ''Liber particularis'' exist, the ''Liber physiognomiae'' was the only book from the ''Liber introductorius'' trilogy to be professionally printed, with a first print of the book being released in 1477.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thorndike|Thorndike (1965)]], p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=turner/&gt; Between the date of its official printing and 1660, the work was reprinted eighteen times in many languages; this popularity of the text led Rudolf Hirsch (a book scholar) in 1950 to call the book one of the Middle Ages' "best sellers".&lt;ref name=turner&gt;[[#Turner|Turner (1911)]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hirsch|Hirsch (1950)]], p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; The number of reprints and its wide circulation is attributed in large part to the advent of the [[printing press]] in 1440.&lt;ref name=contents /&gt; Among the many reprints, there is little evidence of textual changes, which is unique for manuscripts published and then transmitted in the fifteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hellinga|Hellinga (1998)]], p. 409.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Liber physiognomiae'' was often bundled with other, topically-similar texts. For instance, some copies of Scot's book were combined with a work by [[Pseudepigrapha|pseudo-]][[Albertus Magnus]] entitled ''De secretis mulierum'' (''Concerning the Secrets of Women''), which, according to the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'', suggests the opinion of the time was that Scot "dealt with forbidden subjects, or at least subjects better left to medical science."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Stephen|Stephen (1897)]], p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Extracts from the ''Liber physiognomiae'' also appear in many early printed versions of Johannes de Ketham's medical treatise ''[[Fasciculus Medicinae]]'' (although this is not the case for all early copies).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Porter|Porter (2005)]], p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in 1515 a compendium titled ''Phisionomia Aristotellis, cum commanto Micaelis Scoti'' was published, which featured the ''Liber physiognomiae'' of Scot, alongside physiognomical works by Aristotle and [[Bartolomeo della Rocca]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Porter|Porter (2005)]], p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==

According to Porter, Scot's ''Liber physiognomiae'' was influential for three main reasons: First, Scot developed a number of physiognomical [[aphorism]]s.&lt;ref name=point1&gt;[[#Porter|Porter (2005)]], pp. 69{{en dash}}70.&lt;/ref&gt; Given the popularity of the ''Liber physiognomiae'', Scot's new formulations and ideas, according to Porter, "introduce[d] some fundamental changes into the structure and nature of the physiognomical aphorism."&lt;ref name=point2/&gt; (Effectively, what Scot did was add new meanings to various physical features, making the physiognomical signs discussed in the ''Liber physiognomiae'' more complex and, as Porter writes, "[[wiktionary:polyvalent|polyvalent]].")&lt;ref name=point1/&gt; Second, Scot developed a "stronger conceptual link between physiognomy, issues of hereditary, embryology, and generation, which he articulated through astrological ideas of conception."&lt;ref name=point2/&gt; Porter argues that this was done because the book was written by Scot to help Frederick II pick a suitable wife (and thus, by extension, produce a suitable heir).&lt;ref name=point2&gt;[[#Porter|Porter (2005)]], p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Third and finally, Scot's ''Liber physiognomiae'' seems to be the first physiognomical work that takes smell into account. According to Porter, this "totalization" of physiognomy{{em dash}}that is, connecting it to a variety of subjects like reproduction and sense perception{{em dash}}was the most dramatic change that occurred in the way that physiognomy was practiced "as it developed in the period between [[classical Athens]] and late fifteenth-century Europe".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Porter|Porter (2005)]], pp. 70{{en dash}}71.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jakarta]] is the capital of [[Indonesia]] and the largest city by population in [[Southeast Asia]]. The city is a blend as well as contrast of [[Central business district|business district]]s with modern skyscrapers and [[kampung]]s with traditional [[Architecture of Indonesia|Indonesian]] style architecture. Jakarta has architecturally significant buildings in a wide range of styles spanning distinct historical and cultural periods. Architectural styles reflect Malay, Javanese, Arabic, Chinese and Dutch influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Jacqueline|last=Knörr|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=Bo0dDAAAQBAJ|title=Creole Identity in Postcolonial Indonesia|date=2014|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-1-78238-268-3|jstor=j.ctt9qcwb1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wide image|Jakarta-Skyline-from-Bund.jpg|1000px|Panoramic view of skyline of [[Golden Triangle of Jakarta]]}}
The first high rise building in the city was [[Sarinah]], which was built in 1963.

Wisma Nusantara International |access-date=June 15, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1983 and 1996, the tallest building in the city was [[Bank Mandiri|Graha Mandiri]]. The first skyscraper above 250 meters height is [[Wisma 46]] (262 m), which was constructed in 1996 and holds the 'unbeatable' record of being the tallest building for nearly 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://metro.news.viva.co.id/news/read/190122-10-gedung-tertinggi-di-jakarta 10 Gedung Tertinggi di Jakarta], VIVA.co.id, November 24, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2017, [[Gama Tower]] is the tallest building in Jakarta, as well as in Indonesia. Most of the tallest skyscrapers are located at main avenues such as [[Jalan M.H. Thamrin]],  [[Jalan Jenderal Sudirman]], [[Jalan Jenderal Gatot Subroto|Jalan Gatot Subroto]] and [[Jalan H.R. Rasuna Said]], within the [[Golden Triangle of Jakarta]]. Clusters of high-rise buildings are located at [[SCBD]], [[Setiabudi, South Jakarta|Mega Kuningan]], [[Puri Indah]], Kuningan Persada and along  T. B. Simatupang Avenue. The [[Golden Triangle of Jakarta]] is one of the fastest evolving [[Central Business District|CBD]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s in the Asia-Pacific region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jllrealviews.com/trends/fastest-evolving-central-business-districts-in-asia-pacific/|title=Where are the fastest evolving Central Business Districts in Asia Pacific?|accessdate=2017-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This '''list of tallest buildings in Jakarta''' ranks skyscrapers in the '''Special Capital Region of Jakarta'''. [[Skyscraper]]s of [[Jabodetabek|Greater Jakarta]] outside [[DKI Jakarta]] are not included in this list.
== Tallest buildings ==
This list ranks only completed and architecturally [[topping out|topped out]] buildings in Jakarta with a minimum height of 150 meters based on standard height measurement. [[Highrise|Highrises]] and [[skyscraper]]s of [[Jabodetabek|Greater Jakarta]] outside [[DKI Jakarta]] are not included in this list. This includes spires and architectural details but does not include antenna masts. The "Year" column indicates the year in which a building was completed.

[[File:Small antenna loading coil.jpg|thumb|A loading coil in a small [[cell phone]] antenna on a car roof.]]
A '''loading coil''' or '''load coil''' is an [[inductor]] that is inserted into an [[electronic circuit]] to increase its [[inductance]]. The term originated in the 19th century for inductors used to prevent signal distortion in long-distance telegraph transmission cables. The term is also used for inductors in [[antenna (radio)|radio antenna]]s, or between the antenna and its [[feedline]], to make an [[electrically short]] antenna [[resonance|resonant]] at its operating frequency.

The concept of loading coils was discovered by [[Oliver Heaviside]] in studying the problem of slow signalling speed of the first [[transatlantic telegraph cable]] in the 1860s. He concluded additional inductance was required to prevent amplitude and time delay distortion of the transmitted signal.  The mathematical condition for distortion-free transmission is known as the [[Heaviside condition]].  Previous telegraph lines were overland or shorter and hence had less delay, and the need for extra inductance was not as great.  [[Submarine communications cable]]s are particularly subject to the problem, but early 20th century installations using [[balanced pair]]s were often continuously loaded with iron wire or tape rather than discretely with loading coils, which avoided the sealing problem.

Loading coils are historically also known as '''Pupin coils''' after [[Mihajlo Idvorski Pupin|Mihajlo Pupin]], especially when used for the Heaviside condition and the process of inserting them is sometimes called ''pupinization''.

==Applications==

[[File:Loaded line schematic.svg|thumb|600px|center|Schematic of a balanced loaded telephone line.  The capacitors are not discrete components but represent the distributed capacitance between the closely spaced wire conductors of the line, this is indicated by the dotted lines.  The loading coils prevent the audio (voice) signal from being distorted by the line capacitance.  The windings of the loading coil are wound such that the magnetic flux induced in the core is in the same direction for both windings.]]

The coils were enclosed in an oil-filled steel tank ''(right)'' on the telephone pole.  The cable required loading coils every 6000 ft (1.83 km).
}}

A common application of loading coils is to improve the [[voice frequency|voice-frequency]] amplitude response characteristics of the [[twisted pair|twisted balanced pairs]] in a telephone cable.  Because twisted pair is a [[balanced line|balanced]] format, half the loading coil must be inserted in each leg of the pair to maintain the balance.  It is common for both these windings to be formed on the same core.  This increases the [[magnetic flux|flux]] linkages, without which the number of turns on the coil would need to be increased. Despite the use of common cores, such loading coils do not comprise [[transformer]]s, as they do not provide [[coupling (electronics)|coupling]] to other circuits.

Loading coils inserted periodically in series with a pair of wires reduce the [[attenuation]] at the higher voice frequencies up to the [[cutoff frequency]] of the [[low-pass filter]] formed by the inductance of the coils (plus the distributed inductance of the wires) and the distributed capacitance between the wires. Above the cutoff frequency, attenuation increases rapidly.  The shorter the distance between the coils, the higher the cut-off frequency.

It should be emphasised that the cutoff effect is an artifact of using [[lumped element model|lumped]] inductors.  With loading methods using continuous [[distributed element model|distributed]] inductance there is no cutoff.

Without loading coils, the line response is dominated by the resistance and capacitance of the line with the attenuation gently increasing with frequency.  With loading coils of exactly the right inductance, neither capacitance nor inductance dominate: the response is flat, [[waveform]]s are undistorted and the [[characteristic impedance]] is resistive up to the cutoff frequency.  The coincidental formation of an [[audio frequency]] filter is also beneficial in that noise is reduced.

====DSL====
When loading coils are in place, signal attenuation remains low for signals within the [[passband]] of the transmission line but increases rapidly for frequencies above the audio cutoff frequency. Thus, if the pair is subsequently reused to support applications that require higher frequencies (such as analog or digital [[carrier system]]s or [[Digital subscriber line|DSL]]), any loading coils that were present on the line must be removed or replaced with ones which are transparent to DSL.  Using coils with parallel capacitors will form a filter with the topology of an [[m-derived filter]] and a band of frequencies above the cut-off will also be passed.

If the coils are not removed, and the subscriber is an extended distance (e.g. over 4 miles or 6.4&amp;nbsp;km) from the Central Office, DSL can not be supported.  This sometimes happens in dense, growing areas such as Southern California in the late 1990s and early 21st century.



====Carrier systems====
American early and middle 20th century telephone cables had load coils at intervals of a mile (1.61&amp;nbsp;km), usually in coil cases holding many.  The coils had to be removed to pass higher frequencies, but the coil cases provided convenient places for repeaters of digital [[T-carrier]] systems, which could then transmit a 1.5 Mbit/s signal that distance.  Due to narrower streets and higher cost of copper, European cables had thinner wires and used closer spacing.  Intervals of a kilometer allowed European systems to carry 2 Mbit/s.

===Radio antenna===
[[File:CB antenna.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|A typical mobile antenna with a center-placed loading coil]]
[[File:Large antenna loading coil.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|An enormous antenna loading coil used in a powerful [[longwave]] [[radiotelegraphy|radiotelegraph]] station in New Jersey in 1912.]]
Another type of loading coil is used in radio [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]s.  [[Monopole antenna|Monopole]] and [[dipole antenna|dipole]] radio antennas are designed to act as [[resonator]]s for radio waves; the power from the transmitter, applied to the antenna through the antenna's [[transmission line]], excites [[standing wave]]s of voltage and current in the antenna element. To be resonant, the antenna must have a physical length of one quarter of the [[wavelength]] of the radio waves used (or a multiple of that length). At resonance the antenna acts electrically as a pure [[electrical resistance|resistance]], absorbing all the power applied to it from the transmitter.

In many cases for practical reasons it is necessary to make the antenna shorter than the resonant length, this is called an [[electrically short]] antenna. An antenna shorter than a quarter wavelength presents [[capacitive reactance]] to the transmission line. Some of the applied power is reflected back into the transmission line and travels back toward the transmitter (called “''backlash current''”). The two currents at the same frequency running in opposite directions causes [[standing wave]]s on the transmission line (measured as a [[standing wave ratio]] (SWR) greater than one) which waste energy, and can even overheat the transmitter.

So to make an [[electrical length|electrically short]] antenna resonant, a loading coil is inserted in series with the antenna. The [[inductive reactance]] of the coil is equal and opposite to, and cancels, the capacitive reactance of the antenna, so the loaded antenna presents a pure resistance to the transmission line, preventing energy from being reflected. The loading coil is often placed at the base of the antenna, between it and the transmission line (''base loading''), but for better efficiency, it is sometimes inserted in the center of the antenna element itself (''center loading'').

Loading coils for powerful transmitters can have challenging design requirements, especially at low frequencies. Since the [[radiation resistance]] of short antennas can be very low, as low a few ohms in the [[low frequency|LF]] or [[very low frequency|VLF]] bands, the coil must have extremely low AC [[electrical resistance|resistance]] at the operating frequency. To reduce [[skin effect]] losses the coil is often made of tubing or [[Litz wire]], with single layer windings with turns spaced apart to reduce [[Proximity effect (electromagnetism)|proximity effect]] and arcing.  They must often handle high voltages. To reduce power lost in [[dielectric loss]]es, the coil is often suspended in air supported on thin ceramic strips.  The capacitively loaded antennas used at low frequencies have extremely narrow bandwidths, and therefore if the frequency is changed the loading coil must be adjustable to tune the antenna to resonance with the new transmitter frequency. [[Inductor|Variometers]] are often used.

==Campbell equation==
The Campbell equation is a relationship due to [[George Ashley Campbell]] for predicting the [[propagation constant]] of a loaded line.  It is stated as;&lt;ref&gt;Brittain, p43&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\cosh (\gamma'd) = \cosh (\gamma d) + \frac{Z}{2Z_0} \sinh (\gamma d)&lt;/math&gt;

:where,

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is the propagation constant of the unloaded line
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma ' \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is the propagation constant of the loaded line
:&lt;math&gt;d \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is the interval between coils on the loaded line
:&lt;math&gt;Z \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is the impedance of a loading coil and
:&lt;math&gt;Z_0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is the characteristic impedance of the unloaded line.

A more engineer friendly rule of thumb is that the approximate requirement for spacing loading coils is ten coils per wavelength of the maximum frequency being transmitted.&lt;ref&gt;Brittain, p42&lt;/ref&gt;  This approximation can be arrived at by treating the loaded line as a [[constant k filter]] and applying [[image impedance|image filter theory]] to it.  From basic image filter theory the angular cutoff frequency and the characteristic impedance of a [[low-pass filter|low-pass]] constant k filter are given by;

:&lt;math&gt;\omega_c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{L_{\frac{1}{2}} C_{\frac{1}{2}}}}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;and,&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;Z_0 = \sqrt{\frac{L_{\frac{1}{2}}}{C_{\frac{1}{2}}}}&lt;/math&gt;

:where &lt;math&gt;L_{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt; are the half section element values.

From these basic equations the necessary loading coil inductance and coil spacing can be found;

:&lt;math&gt; L = \frac{Z_0}{\omega_c}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;and,&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;d = \frac{2}{\omega_c Z_0 C}&lt;/math&gt;

:where C is the capacitance per unit length of the line.

Expressing this in terms of number of coils per cutoff wavelength yields;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\lambda_c}{d} = \pi v Z_0 C&lt;/math&gt;

:where ''v'' is the velocity of propagation of the cable in question.

Since &lt;math&gt;v = {1 \over Z_0 C}&lt;/math&gt; then

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\lambda_c}{d} = \pi&lt;/math&gt;.

Campbell arrived at this expression by analogy with a mechanical line periodically loaded with weights described by Charles Godfrey in 1898 who obtained a similar result.  Mechanical loaded lines of this sort were first studied by [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]] (1736–1813).&lt;ref&gt;Mason, p. 409&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon of cutoff whereby frequencies above the cutoff frequency are not transmitted is an undesirable side effect of loading coils (although it proved highly useful in [[Passive analogue filter development|the development of filters]]).  Cutoff is avoided by the use of continuous loading since it arises from the lumped nature of the loading coils.&lt;ref&gt;Bakshi &amp; Bakshi, p1.56&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Oliver Heaviside===
[[File:Heaviside cropped.png|thumb|Oliver Heaviside]]
The origin of the loading coil can be found in the work of [[Oliver Heaviside]] on the theory of [[transmission line]]s.  Heaviside (1881) represented the line as a network of infinitesimally small circuit elements.  By applying his [[operational calculus]] to the analysis of this network he discovered (1887) what has become known as the [[Heaviside condition]].&lt;ref&gt;Heaviside, O, "Electromagnetic Induction and its propagation", ''The Electrician'', 3 June 1887.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heaviside, O, ''Electrical Papers'', '''vol 1''', pp139-140, Boston, 1925.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is the condition that must be fulfilled in order for a transmission line to be free from [[distortion]].  The Heaviside condition is that the series [[electrical impedance|impedance]], Z, must be proportional to the shunt [[admittance]], Y, at all frequencies.  In terms of the [[primary line coefficients]] the condition is:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{R}{G}=\frac{L}{C}&lt;/math&gt;

:where;

:&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the series resistance of the line per unit length
:&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is the series self-inductance of the line per unit length
:&lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the shunt leakage [[Electrical resistance and conductance|conductance]] of the line insulator per unit length
:&lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is the shunt capacitance between the line conductors per unit length

Heaviside was aware that this condition was not met in the practical telegraph cables in use in his day.  In general, a real cable would have,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{R}{G} \gg \frac{L}{C}&lt;/math&gt;

This is mainly due to the low value of leakage through the cable insulator, which is even more pronounced in modern cables which have better insulators than in Heaviside's day.  In order to meet the condition, the choices are therefore to try to increase G or L or to decrease R or C.  Decreasing R requires larger conductors.  Copper was already in use in telegraph cables and this is the very best conductor available short of using silver.  Decreasing R means using more copper and a more expensive cable.  Decreasing C would also mean a larger cable (although not necessarily more copper).  Increasing G is highly undesirable; while it would reduce distortion, it would at the same time increase the signal loss.  Heaviside considered, but rejected, this possibility which left him with the strategy of increasing L as the way to reduce distortion.&lt;ref&gt;Brittain, pp39-40&lt;/ref&gt;

Heaviside immediately (1887) proposed several methods of increasing the inductance, including spacing the conductors further apart and loading the insulator with iron dust.  Finally, Heaviside made the proposal (1893) to use discrete inductors at intervals along the line.&lt;ref&gt;''The Electrician'', 1887 and reproduced (according to Brittain) in Heaviside, O, ''Electromagnetic Theory'', p.112&lt;/ref&gt;  However, he never succeeded in persuading the British [[General Post Office (United Kingdom)|GPO]] to take up the idea.  Brittain attributes this to Heaviside's failure to provide engineering details on the size and spacing of the coils for particular cable parameters.  Heaviside's eccentric character and setting himself apart from the establishment may also have played a part in their ignoring of him.&lt;ref&gt;Brittain, p40&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Stone===
[[John Stone Stone|John S. Stone]] worked for the [[American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company]] (AT&amp;T) and was the first to attempt to apply Heaviside's ideas to real telecommunications.  Stone's idea (1896) was to use a bimetallic iron-copper cable which he had patented.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, M S, ''Electric Circuit'', US patent 0 578 275, filed 10 September 1896, issued 2 March 1897.&lt;/ref&gt;  This cable of Stone's would increase the line inductance due to the iron content and had the potential to meet the Heaviside condition.  However, Stone left the company in 1899 and the idea was never implemented.&lt;ref&gt;Brittain pp40-41&lt;/ref&gt;  Stone's cable was an example of continuous loading, a principle that was eventually put into practice is other forms, see for instance [[#Krarup cable|Krarup cable]] later in this article.

===George Campbell===
[[George Ashley Campbell|George Campbell]] was another AT&amp;T engineer working in their Boston facility.  Campbell was tasked with continuing the investigation into Stone's bimetallic cable, but soon abandoned it in favour of the loading coil. His was an independent discovery, Campbell was aware of Heaviside's work in discovering the Heaviside condition, but unaware of Heaviside's suggestion of using loading coils to enable a line to meet it.  The motivation for the change of direction was Campbell's limited budget.

Campbell was struggling to set up a practical demonstration over a real telephone route with the budget he had been allocated.  After considering that his artificial line simulators used [[lumped element model|lumped]] components rather than the [[distributed element model|distributed]] quantities found in a real line, he wondered if he could not insert the inductance with lumped components instead of using Stone's distributed line.  When his calculations showed that the manholes on telephone routes were sufficiently close together to be able to insert the loading coils without the expense of either having to dig up the route or lay in new cables he changed to this new plan.&lt;ref&gt;Brittain, pp42-45&lt;/ref&gt;  The very first demonstration of loading coils on a telephone cable was on a 46-mile length of the so-called Pittsburgh cable (the test was actually in Boston, the cable had previously been used for testing in Pittsburgh) on 6 September 1899 carried out by Campbell himself and his assistant.&lt;ref&gt;Brittain, pp. 43-44&lt;/ref&gt;  The first telephone cable using loaded lines put into public service was between Jamaica Plain and West Newton in Boston on 18 May 1900.&lt;ref&gt;Brittain p45&lt;/ref&gt;

Campbell's work on loading coils provided the theoretical basis for his subsequent work on filters which proved to be so important for [[frequency-division multiplexing]].  The cut-off phenomena of loading coils, an undesirable side-effect, can be exploited to produce a desirable filter frequency response.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, G A, "Physical Theory of the Electric Wave-Filter", ''Bell System Tech J'', November 1922, vol 1, no 2, pp 1-32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brittain, p56&lt;/ref&gt;

===Michael Pupin===
[[File:Pupin coil.png|thumb|left|Pupin's design of loading coil]]
[[Mihajlo Idvorski Pupin|Michael Pupin]], inventor and [[Serbia]]n immigrant to the USA, also played a part in the story of loading coils.  Pupin filed a rival patent to the one of Campbell's.&lt;ref&gt;Pupin, M, ''Art of Reducing Attenuation of Electrical Waves and Apparatus Therefor'', US patent 0 652 230, filed 14 December 1899, issued 19 June 1900.&lt;/ref&gt;  This patent of Pupin's dates from 1899.  There is an earlier patent&lt;ref&gt;Pupin, M, ''Apparatus for Telegraphic of Telephonic Transmission'', US patent 0 519 346, filed 14 December 1893, issued 8 May 1894.&lt;/ref&gt; (1894, filed December 1893) which is sometimes cited as Pupin's loading coil patent but is, in fact, something different.  The confusion is easy to understand, Pupin himself claims that he first thought of the idea of loading coils while climbing a mountain in 1894,&lt;ref&gt;Pupin, M I, ''From Immigrant to Inventor'', pp330-331, Charles Schribner &amp; Sons, 1924&lt;/ref&gt; although there is nothing from him published at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Brittain, p46&lt;/ref&gt;

Pupin's 1894 patent "loads" the line with capacitors rather than inductors, a scheme that has been criticised as being theoretically flawed&lt;ref&gt;Britain, p46, quoting a contemporary criticism in ''Electrical Review'' and experiments by the [[General Post Office|GPO]] showing that the scheme does not work&lt;/ref&gt; and never put into practice.  To add to the confusion, one variant of the capacitor scheme proposed by Pupin does indeed have coils.  However, these are not intended to compensate the line in any way.  They are there merely to restore DC continuity to the line so that it may be tested with regular equipment.  Pupin states that the inductance is to be so large that it will block all AC signals above 50&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref&gt;Pupin, 1894, p5 lines 75-83&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently, only the capacitor is adding any significant impedance to the line and "the coils will not exercise any material influence on the results before noted".&lt;ref&gt;Pupin, 1894, p5 lines 123-125&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal battle===
Heaviside never patented his idea; indeed, he took no commercial advantage of any of his work.&lt;ref&gt;Bray, p53&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite the legal disputes surrounding this invention, it is unquestionable that Campbell was the first to actually construct a telephone circuit using loading coils.&lt;ref&gt;Brittain p56&lt;/ref&gt;  There also can be little doubt that Heaviside was the first to publish and many would dispute Pupin's priority.&lt;ref&gt;Brittain, p36, 48-50&lt;br/&gt;Behrend to Searle, in letter quoted by Brittain, p37&lt;br/&gt;Searle to Behrend, 1931, in letter quoted by Brittain, p37&lt;br/&gt;Nahin, p276&lt;/ref&gt;

AT&amp;T fought a legal battle with Pupin over his claim.  Pupin was first to patent but Campbell had already conducted practical demonstrations before Pupin had even filed his patent (December 1899).&lt;ref&gt;Pupin, M I, ''Art of Reducing Attenuation of Electrical Waves and Apparatus Therefore'', US patent 0 652 230,  filed 14 December 1899, issued 19 June 1900.&lt;/ref&gt;  Campbell's delay in filing was due to the slow internal machinations of AT&amp;T.&lt;ref&gt;Brittain, p44&lt;/ref&gt;

However, AT&amp;T foolishly deleted from Campbell's proposed patent application all the tables and graphs detailing the exact value of inductance that would be required before the patent was submitted.&lt;ref&gt;Brittain p44-45&lt;/ref&gt;  Since Pupin's patent contained a (less accurate) formula, AT&amp;T was open to claims of incomplete disclosure.  Fearing that there was a risk that the battle would end with the invention being declared unpatentable due to Heaviside's prior publication, they decided to desist from the challenge and buy an option on Pupin's patent for a yearly fee so that AT&amp;T would control both patents.  By January 1901 Pupin had been paid $200,000 ($13 million in 2011&lt;ref name=Worth&gt;Samuel H. Williamson, "Seven Ways to Compute the Relative Value of a U.S. Dollar Amount, 1774 to present" (Contemporary Standard of Living measure) ''MeasuringWorth'', April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;) and by 1917, when the AT&amp;T monopoly ended and payments ceased, he had received a total of $455,000 ($25 million in 2011&lt;ref name=Worth/&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;Brittain, p54, p55 (footnote), p57&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benefit to AT&amp;T===
The invention was of enormous value to AT&amp;T.  Telephone cables could now be used to twice the distance previously possible, or alternatively, a cable of half the previous quality (and cost) could be used over the same distance.  When considering whether to allow Campbell to go ahead with the demonstration, their engineers had estimated that they stood to save $700,000 in new installation costs in New York and New Jersey alone.&lt;ref&gt;Brittain, p45&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been estimated that AT&amp;T saved $100 million in the first quarter of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Brittain, p36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, T &amp; Fondiller, W, "Developments and Applications of Loading for Telephone Circuits", ''Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers'', '''vol 45''', pp291-292, 1926.&lt;/ref&gt;  Heaviside, who began it all, came away with nothing.  He was offered a token payment but would not accept, wanting the credit for his work.  He remarked ironically that if his prior publication had been admitted it would "interfere ... with the flow of dollars in the proper direction ...".&lt;ref&gt;Brittain quoting Heaviside letter to Behrend, 1918.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Loaded submarine cable}}

===Krarup cable===
Loading coils were not without their problems.  In heavy submarine cables, loading coils were difficult to lay. Discontinuities where the coils were installed caused stresses in the cable during laying.  Without great care, the cable might part and would be difficult to repair. A second problem was that the material science of the time had difficulties sealing the joint between coil and cable against ingress of seawater.  When this occurred the cable was ruined.&lt;ref&gt;Britannica, 1911&lt;/ref&gt;

A Danish engineer, [[Carl Emil Krarup]], invented a form of continuously loaded cable which solved these problems and the cable is named for him.  Krarup cable has iron wires continuously wound around the central copper conductor with adjacent turns in contact with each other.  This cable was the first use of continuous loading on any telecommunication cable.&lt;ref&gt;Kragh, p129&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1902, Krarup both wrote his paper on this subject and saw the installation of the first cable between [[Helsingør]] (Denmark) and [[Helsingborg]] (Sweden).&lt;ref&gt;Huurderman, pp321-322&lt;/ref&gt;

===Permalloy cable===
[[File:Permalloy cable.svg|thumb|right|300px|Permalloy cable construction]]
Even though the Krarup cable added inductance to the line, this was insufficient to meet the Heaviside condition. AT&amp;T searched for a better material with higher [[permeability (electromagnetism)|magnetic permeability]].  In 1914, Gustav Elmen discovered [[permalloy]], a magnetic nickel-iron annealed alloy. In c. 1915, [[Oliver E. Buckley]], H. D. Arnold, and Elmen, all at [[Bell Labs]], greatly improved transmission speeds by suggesting a method of constructing [[submarine communications cable]] using permalloy tape wrapped around the copper conductors.&lt;ref name=Huurd314&gt;Huurdeman, p.314&lt;/ref&gt;

The cable was tested in a trial in Bermuda in 1923. The first permalloy cable placed in service connected [[New York City]] and [[Horta (Azores)]] in September 1924.&lt;ref name=Huurd314/&gt;  Permalloy cable enabled signalling speed on submarine telegraph cables to be increased to 400 words/min at a time when 40 words/min was considered good.&lt;ref&gt;Huurdeman, p.308&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Huurdeman has apparently read 2000 characters per minute as 2000 words per minute --&gt;  The first transatlantic cable achieved only two words/min.&lt;ref&gt;May, pages 947, 950&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mu-metal cable===
[[File:Mu-metal cable.svg|thumb|left|300px|Mu-metal cable construction]]
[[Mu-metal]] has similar magnetic properties to permalloy but the addition of copper to the alloy increases the ductility and allows the metal to be drawn into wire.  Mu-metal cable is easier to construct than permalloy cable, the mu-metal being wound around the core copper conductor in much the same way as the iron wire in Krarup cable.  A further advantage with mu-metal cable is that the construction lends itself to a variable loading profile whereby the loading is tapered towards the ends.

Mu-metal was invented in 1923 by The Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company Ltd., London,&lt;ref&gt;Smith, WS, Garnett, HJ, ''New and improved magnetic alloys, and their application in the manufacture of telegraphic and telephonic cables'', Patent GB224972, filed 25 Aug 1923, issued 25 Nov 1925.  patented in the US as US1582353 and US1552769&lt;/ref&gt; who made the cable, initially, for the [[Western Union|Western Union Telegraph Co]].  Western Union were in competition with AT&amp;T and the [[Western Electric Company]] who were using permalloy.  The patent for permalloy was held by Western Electric which prevented Western Union from using it.&lt;ref&gt;Allan Green, "150 Years Of Industry &amp; Enterprise At [[Enderby's Wharf]]" paper presented at University College, July 2004, for ''History of the Atlantic Cable &amp; Undersea Communications'' [http://atlantic-cable.com/Article/EnderbyAG/index.htm retrieved] 16 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patch loading===
Continuous loading of cables is expensive and hence is only done when absolutely necessary.  Lumped loading with coils is cheaper but has the disadvantages of difficult seals and a definite cutoff frequency.  A compromise scheme is '''patch loading''' whereby the cable is continuously loaded in repeated sections.  The intervening sections are left unloaded.&lt;ref&gt;Bakshi &amp; Bakshi, p1.55&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current practice===
Loaded cable is no longer a useful technology for submarine communication cables, having first been superseded by [[coaxial cable|co-axial cable]] using electrically powered in-line [[repeater]]s and then by [[optical fiber|fibre-optic cable]].  Manufacture of loaded cable declined in the 1930s and was then superseded by other technologies post-war.  Loading coils can still be found in some telephone landlines today but new installations use more modern technology.

'''Sylvie Merzeau''' (commonly called '''Louise Merzeau''', 8 November 1963 – 15 July 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dicen-idf.org/louise-merzeau-nous-a-quittes/|title=Louise Merzeau nous a quittés|publisher=Dicen-IDF|language=French|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[France|French]] academic, university [[professor]] at the [[Paris Nanterre University]] (specializing on [[communication studies]]) and a [[photographer]].

Merzeau was a trustee of [[Wikimedia France]] between 2015 and 2017.

== Biography ==
Louise Merzeau is a former student of the [[École normale supérieure de lettres et sciences humaines|École normale supérieure de Saint-Cloud]] (L1982 promotion) and a qualified teacher of contemporary literature (1985).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cv.archives-ouvertes.fr/louise-merzeau|title=CV HAL : Louise Merzeau|last=HAL|website=cv.archives-ouvertes.fr|language=fr|access-date=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://affordance.typepad.com//mon_weblog/2017/07/salut-louise.html|title=Salut Louise.|website=affordance.info|access-date=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her doctoral thesis "From scriptural to index: text, photography, document" in 1993 was written under supervision of [[Nicole Boulestreau]]. She passed her [[habilitation]] to conduct research in 2011 on the subject of the concept of memory in the age of internet. In 2016, she becomes a university professor at Paris-Nanterre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Décret du 15 décembre 2016 portant nomination, titularisation et affectation (enseignements supérieurs)|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000033624003&amp;categorieLien=id|accessdate=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was a co-director of the Nanterre research laboratory Dicen-IDF and member of the e.laboratory on Human Trace Complex System Digital Campus UNESCO.

Merzeau's research was inspired by the concept of [[mediology]] designed by [[Régis Debray]] and was primarily about the relations between culture and technology, in particular, on the technological, institutional, and sociological aspects of memory. She has designed the concept of hypersphere to extend the list of [[Médiasphère|mediaspheres]] initially proposed by Debray, to characterize sociological and technical ecosystems associated with the development of the internet. She was the chief co-editor of the journal ''[[Les cahiers de médiologie]]'' during several years.

Merzeau also focused on the question of traces - that she developed with researchers like [[Béatrice Galinon-Mélénec]] - and on [[numerical identity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.archimag.com/archives-patrimoine/2016/09/13/louise-merzeau-memoire-pensee-oubli|title=Louise Merzeau : "Il n'y a pas de mémoire sans une pensée de l'oubli"|work=Archimag|access-date=2017-07-27|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; around the idea of an [[identity mediation]] and a presence which cannot be reduced to an accumulation of calculated traces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.franceculture.fr/conferences/bibliotheque-publique-dinformation/facebook-twitter-instagram-fictions-de-soi|title=Facebook, Twitter, Instagram : fictions de soi|website=France Culture|language=fr-FR|access-date=2017-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.franceculture.fr/emissions/du-grain-moudre/reseaux-sociaux-sommes-nous-tous-des-big-brothers|title=Réseaux sociaux : sommes-nous tous des Big Brothers ?|work=France Culture|access-date=2017-07-27|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, her work concentrated on behavior in numerical environments and the conditions of a numerical culture. In a conference on "The User's intelligence" for example, employing the theories of usage and the stakes of digital literacy, she seeks to demonstrate, from the user to the consumer and the content producer, the multiplicity of the user's role. In the article "Copy and paste",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Merzeau|first=Louise|date=|title=Copier-coller.|url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/file/index/docid/727080/filename/Merzeau-Copier-coller.pdf|journal=M ́edium : Transmettre pour Innover, Ed. Babylone, 2012, pp.312-333.|volume=|pages=312–333|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Louise Merzeau proposes a vision that aims at overcoming the simple notions of plagiarism and theft associated to this practice. The notion of paste and copy should not be forbidden: a new learning process of copying as a way of thinking could lead to knowledge, therefore underlying the importance of a pedagogical frame. The copy and paste could be a solution to the commercial logics of the web. This conception is to be put in relation with her engagement in the movement of common goods, to which she participates through the Savoirscom1 collective group, which fights for the user's rights against the risks of informational enclosure,. On this subject, she has opened an axe called "numerical common goods" in the university master's "Cultural industries and numerical environments" at the Paris Nanterre university.

In March 2015, Sylvie directed in collaboration with Lionel Barbe and Valérie Schafer the publication of a collective book on [[Wikipedia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/sciences/article/2016/01/11/wikipedia-un-objet-scientifique-non-identifie_4845331_1650684.html|title=Wikipédia, " un objet scientifique non identifié "|last=par)|first=David Larousserie (propos recueillis|date=2016-01-11|work=Le Monde.fr|access-date=2017-07-26|language=fr|issn=1950-6244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her research switches to the notion of editorialisation, that she developed with researchers like [[Marcello Vitali-Rosati]] of the University of Montréal and [[Gérard Wormser]] of the journal [[Sens Public]]. This notion centers the question of traces on writing processes seen as collective interaction and technical contexts.

Louise Merzeau is also involved in [[web archiving]] through the workshops on methodological research of legal web deposits at [[Institut national de l'audiovisuel|INA]], where she supervised scientifical aspects from 2010 to her death.

She also has an activity of numeric and [[creative photography]]. She became a member of the scientifical council of [[Wikimedia France]] in 2015, and was coopted in as a member of the board of trustees in May 2017. 

Sylvie died on July 15, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/rue89/rue89-nos-vies-connectees/20170718.OBS2248/exclusions-menaces-budget-recale-c-est-la-crise-chez-wikimedia-france.html|title=Exclusions, menaces, budget recalé : c'est la crise chez Wikimédia France|work=L'Obs|access-date=2017-07-26|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Malmquist bias''' is an effect in [[observational astronomy]] which leads to the preferential detection of intrinsically bright objects.  It was first described in 1922 by Swedish astronomer [[Gunnar Malmquist]] (1893–1982), who then greatly elaborated upon this work in 1925.&lt;ref name="Malm_1"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Malmquist| first=Gunnar |year=1922 |title=On some relations in stellar statistics |journal=[[Arkiv för Matematik, Astronomi och Fysik]] |volume=16 |issue=23 |pages=1–52 |bibcode=1922MeLuF.100....1M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Malm_2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Malmquist|first=Gunnar|title=A Contribution to the Problem of Determining the Distribution in Space of the Stars|journal=[[Arkiv för Matematik, Astronomi och Fysik]] |volume=19A |issue=6 |pages=1–12 |date=1925 |bibcode=1925MeLuF.106....1M}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In statistics, this bias is referred to as a [[selection bias]] and affects the survey results in a [[brightness]] limited [[Astronomical survey|survey]], where stars below a certain apparent brightness are not included.  Since observed [[stars]] and [[galaxies]] appear dimmer when farther away, the brightness that is measured will fall off with distance until their brightness falls below the observational threshold.  Objects which are more [[Luminosity|luminous]], or intrinsically brighter, can be observed at a greater distance, creating a false trend of increasing intrinsic brightness, and other related quantities, with distance.  This effect has led to many spurious claims in the field of astronomy.  Properly correcting for these effects has become an area of great focus.

==Understanding the bias==
[[File:inverse square law.svg|thumb|right|middle|300px| As light rays leave the star homogeneously in every direction, they fill a sphere whose radius grows with time. As the sphere grows, the surface area increases, however the number of light rays stays the same. Following a patch on the surface of the sphere with area A, fewer light rays pass through that patch as the light travels further from the star.]]

===Magnitudes and brightness===

In everyday life it is easy to see that light dims as it gets farther away. This can be seen with car headlights, candles, flashlights, and many other lit objects. This dimming follows the [[inverse square law]], which states that the brightness of an object decreases as 1/''d''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''d'' is the distance between the observer and the object.

Starlight also follows the inverse square law. Light rays leave the [[star]] in equal amounts in all directions. The light rays create a sphere of light surrounding the star. As time progresses, the sphere grows as the light rays travel through space away from the star. While the sphere of light grows, the number of light rays stays the same. So, the amount of light per unit of surface area of the sphere (called [[flux]] in astronomy) decreases with distance and therefore time. When observing a star, only the light rays that are in the given area being viewed can be detected. This is why a star appears dimmer the farther away it is.

If there are two stars with the same intrinsic brightness (called [[luminosity]] in astronomy), each at a different distance, the closer star will appear brighter while the further will appear dimmer. In astronomy, the apparent brightness of a star, or any other luminous object, is called the [[apparent magnitude]]. The apparent magnitude depends on the intrinsic brightness (also called [[absolute magnitude]]) of the object and its distance.

If all stars had the same luminosity, the distance from Earth to a particular star could be easily determined. However, stars have a wide range in luminosities. Therefore, it can be difficult to distinguish a very luminous star that is very far away from a less luminous star that is closer. This is why it is so hard to calculate the distance to astronomical objects.

===Source of the Malmquist bias===

[[File:bias2.png|right|thumb|middle|300px|In a volume of space filled with stars, the stars have a range of luminosities and have some average luminosity shown by the dashed blue line. However, the more distant, less luminous stars will not be seen. This lowest luminosity that can be seen at a given distance is depicted by the red curve. Any star below that curve will not be seen. The average luminosity of only the stars that will be seen will be higher, as shown by the dashed red line.]]

Typically, when looking at an area of sky filled with stars, only stars that are brighter than a limiting [[apparent magnitude]] can be seen. As discussed above, the very luminous stars that are farther away will be seen, as well as luminous and faint stars that are closer. There will appear to be more luminous objects within a certain distance from Earth than faint objects. However, there are many more faint stars,&lt;ref name="imf"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Salpeter|first=Edwin|title=The luminosity function and stellar evolution|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=1955|volume=121|pages=161|doi=10.1086/145971 |bibcode = 1955ApJ...121..161S }}&lt;/ref&gt; they simply cannot be seen because they are so dim. The bias towards luminous stars when observing a patch of sky affects calculations of the average [[absolute magnitude]] and average distance to a group of stars. Because of the luminous stars that are at a further distance, it will appear as if our sample of stars is farther away than it actually is, and that each star is intrinsically brighter than it actually is. This effect is known as the Malmquist bias.&lt;ref name=Malm_1 /&gt;

When studying a sample of luminous objects, whether they be stars or [[galaxies]], it is important to correct for the bias towards the more luminous objects. There are many different methods that can be used to correct for the Malmquist bias as discussed below.

The Malmquist bias is not limited to luminosities. It affects any observational quantity whose detectability diminishes with distance.&lt;ref name=W&amp;J&gt;{{cite book

==Correction methods==
The ideal situation is to avoid this [[Bias (statistics)|bias]] from entering a data [[Astronomical survey|survey]].  However, [[Limiting magnitude|magnitude limited]] [[Astronomical survey|surveys]] are the simplest to perform, and other methods are difficult to put together, with their own uncertainties involved, and may be impossible for first observations of objects.  As such, many different methods exist to attempt to correct the data, removing the [[Bias (statistics)|bias]] and allowing the [[Astronomical survey|survey]] to be usable.  The methods are presented in order of increasing difficulty, but also increasing accuracy and effectiveness.

===Limiting the sample===
The simplest method of correction is to only use the non-biased portions of the data set, if any, and throw away the rest of the data.&lt;ref name="Sandage2000"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Sandage|first=Allan |editor-last=Murdin|editor-first=P. |title=Malmquist Bias and Completeness Limits |encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Astronomy and Astrophysics |at=Article 1940 |date=November 2000 |location=Bristol |publisher=[[Institute of Physics Publishing]] |doi=10.1888/0333750888/1940  |bibcode=2000eaa..bookE1940S |isbn=0-333-75088-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Depending on the [[limiting magnitude]] selected, there may be a range of distances in the data set over which all objects of any possible [[absolute magnitude]] could be seen. As such, this small subset of data should be free of the Malmquist bias. This is easily accomplished by cutting off the data at the edge of where the lowest [[absolute magnitude]] objects would be hitting the [[limiting magnitude]]. Unfortunately, this method would waste a great deal of good data, and would limit the analysis to nearby objects only, making it less than desirable. (Looking at the figure to the right, only the first fifth of the data in distance could be kept before a data point is lost to the bias.) Of course, this method assumes that distances are known with relatively good accuracy, which as mentioned before, is a difficult process in astronomy.

===Traditional correction===
The first solution, proposed by Malmquist in his 1922 work, was to correct the calculated average [[absolute magnitude]] (&lt;math&gt;\overline{M}&lt;/math&gt;) of the sample back to the true average [[absolute magnitude]] (''M''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name=Malm_1 /&gt; The correction would be

: &lt;math&gt;\overline{\Delta M} = \overline{M}- M_0 &lt;/math&gt;

To calculate the [[Bias (statistics)|bias]] correction, Malmquist and others following this method follow six main assumptions:&lt;ref name="Butkevich2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Butkevich|first=A. G. |last2=Berdyugin|first2=A. V. |last3=Terrikorpi|first3=P. |title=Statistical biases in stellar astronomy: the Malmquist bias revisited|journal=MNRAS|date=Sep 2005|volume=362|issue=1|pages=321–330|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2005.09306.x |bibcode = 2005MNRAS.362..321B }}&lt;/ref&gt;
#There exists no [[Interstellar medium|interstellar absorption]], or that the stuff in space between stars (like gas and dust) is not affecting the light and absorbing parts of it. This assumes that the [[brightness]] is simply following the [[inverse square law]], mentioned above.
#The [[Luminosity function (astronomy)|luminosity function]] (Φ) is independent of the distance (''r''). This basically just means that the universe is the same everywhere, and that stars will be similarly distributed somewhere else as they are here.
#For a given area on the sky, or more specifically the [[celestial sphere]], the spatial density of stars (''ρ'') depends only on distance. This assumes that there are the same number of stars in each direction, on average.
#There is completeness, meaning the sample is complete and nothing is missed, to an [[Limiting magnitude|apparent magnitude limit]] (''m''&lt;sub&gt;lim&lt;/sub&gt;).
#The [[luminosity function]] can be approximated as a [[Gaussian function]], centered on an intrinsic mean [[absolute magnitude]] ''M''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.
#Stars are of the same [[spectral type]], with intrinsic mean [[absolute magnitude]] ''M''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and dispersion&amp;nbsp;''σ''.

Obviously, this is a very ideal situation, with the final assumption being particularly troubling, but allows for an approximate correction of simple form. By integrating the [[luminosity function]] over all distances and all magnitudes brighter than ''m''&lt;sub&gt;lim&lt;/sub&gt;,

: &lt;math&gt;\overline{\Delta M} = - \sigma^2 \frac{\operatorname{d} \ln A(m_\lim)}{\operatorname{d} m_\lim}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=Malm_1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Butkevich2005 /&gt;

where A(m&lt;sub&gt;lim&lt;/sub&gt;) is the total number of stars brighter than m&lt;sub&gt;lim&lt;/sub&gt;.  If the spatial distribution of stars can be assumed to be homogeneous, this relation is simplified even further, to the generally accepted form of
: &lt;math&gt; \overline{\Delta M} = - 1.382\sigma^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=Malm_1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Butkevich2005 /&gt;

====Multiple-band observation corrections====
The traditional method assumes that the measurements of [[apparent magnitude]] and the measurements from which distance is determined are from the same band, or predefined range, of wavelengths (e.g. the [[H band (infrared)|H band]], a range of [[Infrared astronomy|infrared]] wavelengths from roughly about 1300–2000 [[nanometers]]), and this leads to the correction form of ''cσ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''c'' is some constant.  Unfortunately, this is rarely the case, as many samples of objects are selected from one wavelength band  but the distance is calculated from another.  For example, astronomers frequently select [[galaxies]] from B-band catalogs, which are the most complete, and use these B band magnitudes, but the distances for the galaxies are calculated using the [[Tully–Fisher relation]] and the H band.  When this happens, the square of the variance is replaced by the [[covariance]] between the scatter in the distance measurements and in the galaxy selection property (e.g. magnitude).&lt;ref name="Gould1993"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gould|first=Andrew|title=Selection, Covariance, and Malmquist Bias|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=Aug 1993|volume=412|pages=55–58|doi=10.1086/186939 |bibcode = 1993ApJ...412L..55G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Volume weighting===
Another fairly straightforward correction method is to use a [[weighted mean]] to properly account for the relative contributions at each magnitude.  Since the objects at different [[absolute magnitude]]s can be seen out to different distances, each point's contribution to the average [[absolute magnitude]] or to the [[luminosity function]] can be weighted by 1/V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;, where V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; is the maximum volume over which the objects could have been seen.  Brighter objects (that is, objects with smaller [[absolute magnitude]]s) will have a larger volume over which they could have been detected, before falling under the threshold, and thus will be given less weight through this method since these bright objects will be more fully sampled.&lt;ref name="Blanton2005a"&gt;{{cite journal |display-authors=8|author=Blanton, Michael|author2=Schlegel, D.J.|author3=Strauss, M.A.|author4=Brinkmann, J.|author5=Finkbeiner, D.|author6=Fukugita, M.|author7=Gunn, J.E.|author8=Hogg, D.W.|author9=Ivezic, Z.|author10=Knapp, G.R.|author11=Lupton, R.H.|author12=Munn, J.A.|author13=Schneider, D.P.|author14=Tegmark, M.|author15=Zehavi, I. |title=New York University Value-Added Galaxy Catalog: A Galaxy Catalog Based on New Public Surveys|journal=The Astronomical Journal|date=June 2005|volume=129|issue=6|pages=2562–2578|doi=10.1086/429803 |arxiv = astro-ph/0410166 |bibcode = 2005AJ....129.2562B }}&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum volume can be approximated as a sphere with radius found from the [[distance modulus]], using the object’s [[absolute magnitude]] and the [[Limiting magnitude|limiting apparent magnitude]].

However, there are two major complications to calculating V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;.  First is the completeness of the area covered in the sky, which is the percentage of the sky that the objects were taken from.&lt;ref name=Blanton2005a /&gt; A full sky [[Astronomical survey|survey]] would collect objects from the entire sphere, 4π [[steradians]], of sky but this is usually impractical, both from time constraints and geographical limitations (ground-based telescopes can only see a limited amount of sky due to the Earth being in the way).  Instead, astronomers will generally look at a small patch or area of sky and then infer universal distributions by assuming that space is either [[Isotropy|isotropic]], that it is generally the same in every direction, or is following a known distribution, such as that one will see more stars by looking toward the center of a galaxy than by  looking directly away. Generally, the volume can be simply scaled down by the percentage actually viewed, giving the correct number of objects to volume relation. This effect could potentially be ignored in a single sample, all from the same [[Astronomical survey|survey]], as the objects will basically all be altered by the same numerical factor, but it is incredibly important to account for in order to be able to compare between different surveys with different sky coverage.

The second complication is [[Cosmology|cosmological]] concerns of [[Cosmological redshift|redshift]] and the [[expanding universe]], which must be considered when looking at distant objects. In these cases, the quantity of interest is the [[comoving distance]], which is a constant distance between two objects assuming that they are moving away from each other solely with the expansion of the universe, known as the [[Hubble flow]]. In effect, this [[comoving distance]] is the object's separation if the universe's expansion were neglected, and it can be easily related to the actual distance by accounting for how it would have expanded. The [[comoving distance]] can be used to calculate the respective comoving volume as usual, or a relation between the actual and comoving volumes can also be easily established. If z is the object's [[Cosmological redshift|redshift]], relating to how far emitted light is shifted toward longer wavelengths as a result of the object moving away from us with the universal expansion, D&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; are the actual distance and volume (or what would be measured today) and D&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; are the [[comoving distance]] and volumes of interest, then

: &lt;math&gt; D_C = D_A (1 + z)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; V_C = V_A (1 + z)^3 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Hogg2000"&gt;{{cite arXiv|last=Hogg|first=David W.|title=Distance measures in cosmology |date=Dec 2000|arxiv=astro-ph/9905116 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large downside of the volume weighting method is its sensitivity to [[Observable universe|large-scale structures]], or parts of the universe with more or less objects than average, such as a [[star cluster]] or a [[Void (astronomy)|void]].&lt;ref name="Blanton2005b"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blanton|first=Michael R.|author2=Lupton, R.H. |author3=Schlegel, D.J. |author4=Strauss, M.A. |author5=Brinkmann, J. |author6=Fukugita, M. |author7=Loveday, J. |title=The Properties and Luminosity Function of Extremely Low Luminosity Galaxies|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=Sep 2005|volume=631|issue=1|pages=208–230|doi=10.1086/431416 |arxiv = astro-ph/0410164 |bibcode = 2005ApJ...631..208B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Having very overdense or underdense regions of objects will cause an inferred change in our average [[absolute magnitude]] and [[luminosity function]], according with the structure.  This is a particular issue with the faint objects in calculating a luminosity function, as their smaller maximum volume means that a large-scale structure therein will have a large impact. Brighter objects with large maximum volumes will tend to average out and approach the correct value in spite of some large-scale structures.

===Advanced methods===
Many more methods exist which become increasingly complicated and powerful in application. A few of the most common are summarized here, with more specific information found in the references.

====Stepwise maximum likelihood method====
This method is based on the [[Distribution function (physics)|distribution function]]s of objects (such as stars or galaxies), which is a relation of how many objects are expected with certain intrinsic [[brightness]]es, distances, or other fundamental values. Each of these values have their own [[Distribution function (physics)|distribution function]] which can be combined with a random number generator to create a theoretical sample of stars.  This method takes the [[Distribution function (physics)|distribution function]] of distances as a known, definite quantity, and then allows the [[Distribution function (physics)|distribution function]] of [[absolute magnitude]]s to change. In this way, it can check different [[Distribution function (physics)|distribution function]]s of the [[absolute magnitude]]s against the actual distribution of detected objects, and find the relation that provides the maximum probability of recreating the same set of objects. By starting with the detected, biased distribution of objects and the appropriate limits to detection, this method recreates the true [[Distribution function (physics)|distribution function]].  However, this method requires heavy calculations and generally relies on computer programs.&lt;ref name=Blanton2005b /&gt;&lt;ref name="Efstathiou1988"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Efstathiou|first=George|author2=Frenk, C.S. |author3=White, S.D.M. |author4=Davis, M. |title=Gravitational clustering from scale-free initial conditions|journal=MNRAS|date=Dec 1988|volume=235|pages=715–748 |bibcode = 1988MNRAS.235..715E |doi = 10.1093/mnras/235.3.715 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Schechter estimators====
[[Paul L. Schechter|Paul Schechter]] found a very interesting relation between the logarithm of a [[spectral line|spectral line's]] [[spectral line width|line width]] and its [[apparent magnitude]], when working with [[galaxies]].&lt;ref name=Schecther1980 /&gt; In a perfect, stationary case, [[spectral lines]] should be incredibly narrow bumps, looking like lines, but motions of the object such as rotation or motion in our line of sight will cause shifts and broadening of these lines. The relation is found by starting with the [[Tully–Fisher relation]], wherein the distance to a [[galaxy]] is related to its [[apparent magnitude]] and its velocity width, or the 'maximum' speed of its [[Galaxy rotation curve|rotation curve]].  From macroscopic [[Doppler broadening]], the logarithm of the [[Spectral line width|line width]] of an observed spectral line can be related to the width of the velocity distribution.  If the distances are assumed to be known very well, then the [[absolute magnitude]] and the [[Spectral line width|line width]] are closely related.&lt;ref name="Schecther1980"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schechter|first=P.L.|title=Mass-to-light ratios for elliptical galaxies|journal=Astronomical Journal|date=July 1980|volume=85|pages=801–811|doi=10.1086/112742 |bibcode = 1980AJ.....85..801S }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, working with the commonly used [[Hydrogen line|21cm line]], an important line relating to neutral hydrogen, the relation is generally calibrated with a [[linear regression]] and given the form

: &lt;math&gt; \overline{M} = \alpha P + \beta&lt;/math&gt;

where P is log(line width) and α and β are constants.

The reason that this estimator is useful is that the inverse regression line is actually unaffected by the Malmquist bias, so long as the selection effects are only based on magnitude. As such, the expected value of P given M will be unbiased and will give an unbiased log distance estimator. This estimator has many properties and ramifications which can make it a very useful tool.&lt;ref name="Hendry1993"&gt;{{cite arXiv|last=Hendry|first=M.A.|author2=Simmons, J.F.L. |author3=Newsam, A.M. |title=What Do We Mean by 'Malmquist Bias'? |date=Oct 1993|arxiv=astro-ph/9310028 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Complex mathematical relations====
Advanced versions of the traditional correction mentioned above can be found in the literature, limiting or changing the initial assumptions to suit the appropriate author's needs. Often, these other methods will provide very complicated mathematical expressions with very powerful but specific applications. For example, work by Luri et al. found a relation for the bias for [[stars]] in a [[galaxy]] which relates the correction to the variance of the sample and the [[apparent magnitude]], [[absolute magnitude]], and the height above the [[Disc (galaxy)|galactic disk]].  This gave a much more exact and accurate result, but also required an assumption about the spatial distribution of [[stars]] in the desired [[galaxy]].&lt;ref name="Luri1993"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Luri|first=X.|author2=Mennessier, M.O. |author3=Torra, J. |author4=Figueras, F. |title=A new approach to the Malmquist bias|journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|date=Jan 1993|volume=267|pages=305–307 |bibcode = 1993A&amp;A...267..305L }}&lt;/ref&gt; While useful individually, and there are many examples published, these have very limited scope and are not generally as broadly applicable as the other methods mentioned above.

==Applications==

[[File:lumfunc.png|thumb|right|middle|300px|The dashed red line is an example luminosity function when the Malmquist bias is not corrected for. The more numerous low luminosity objects are underrepresented because of the apparent magnitude limit of the survey. The solid blue line is the properly corrected luminosity function using the volume-weighted correction method.]]

Anytime a magnitude-limited sample is used, one of the methods described above should be used to correct for the Malmquist bias. For instance, when trying to obtain a [[luminosity function]], calibrate the [[Tully–Fisher relation]], or obtain the value of the [[Hubble constant]], the Malmquist bias can strongly change the results.

The luminosity function gives the number of stars or galaxies per luminosity or absolute magnitude bin.  When using a magnitude-limited sample, the number of faint objects is underrepresented as discussed above. This shifts the peak of the luminosity function from the faint end to a brighter luminosity and changes the shape of the luminosity function. Typically, the volume weighting method is used to correct the Malmquist bias so that the survey is equivalent to a distance-limited survey rather than a magnitude-limited survey.&lt;ref name="Binney"&gt;{{cite book|last=Binney|first=James|title=Galactic Astronomy|date=1998|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|pages=111–115|author2=Merrifield, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figure to the right shows two luminosity functions for an example population of stars that is magnitude-limited. The dashed luminosity function shows the effect of the Malmquist bias, while the solid line shows the corrected luminosity function. Malmquist bias drastically changes the shape of the luminosity function.

Another application that is affected by the Malmquist bias is the [[Tully–Fisher relation]], which relates the luminosity of spiral galaxies to their respective velocity width. If a nearby cluster of galaxies is used to calibrate the Tully–Fisher relation, and then that relation is applied to a distant cluster, the distance to the farther cluster will be systematically underestimated.&lt;ref name=Hendry1993 /&gt; By underestimating the distance to clusters, anything found using those clusters will be incorrect; for example, when finding the value of the Hubble constant.

These are just a few examples where the Malmquist bias can strongly affect results. As mentioned above, anytime a magnitude-limited sample is used, the Malmquist bias needs to be corrected for. A correction is not limited to just the examples above.

==Alternatives==
Some alternatives do exist to attempt to avoid the Malmquist bias, or to approach it in a different way, with a few of the more common ones summarized below.

===Distance-limited sampling===
One ideal method to avoid the Malmquist bias is to only select objects within a set distance, and have no [[limiting magnitude]] but instead observe all objects within this volume.&lt;ref name=Sandage2000 /&gt; Clearly, in this case, the Malmquist bias is not an issue as the volume will be fully populated and any [[Distribution function (physics)|distribution]] or [[luminosity function]] will be appropriately sampled.  Unfortunately, this method is not always practical.  Finding distances to astronomical objects is very difficult, and even with the aid of objects with easily determined distances, called [[standard candles]], and similar things, there are great uncertainties.  Further, distances are not generally known for objects until after they have already been observed and analyzed, and so a distance limited [[Astronomical survey|survey]] is usually only an option for a second round of observations, and not initially available.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}  Finally, distance limited [[Astronomical surveys|surveys]] are generally only possible over small volumes where the distances are reliably known, and thus it is not practical for large [[Astronomical surveys|surveys]].

===Homogeneous and inhomogeneous Malmquist correction===
This method attempts to correct the [[Bias (statistics)|bias]] again, but through very different means. Rather than trying to fix the [[absolute magnitude]]s, this method takes the distances to the objects as being the random variables and attempts to rescale those.&lt;ref name=Hendry1993 /&gt;  In effect, rather than giving the stars in the sample the correct distribution of [[absolute magnitude]]s (and average [[absolute magnitude]]), it attempts to 'move' the stars such that they would have a correct distribution of distances. Ideally, this should have the same end result as the magnitude correction methods and should result in a correctly represented sample. In either the homogeneous or inhomogeneous case, the bias is defined in terms of a prior distribution of distances, the distance estimator, and the [[likelihood function]] of these two being the same distribution.  The homogeneous case is much simpler and rescales the raw distance estimates by a constant factor. Unfortunately, this will be very insensitive to [[Observable universe|large scale structures]] such as clustering as well as observational selection effects, and will not give a very accurate result.  The inhomogeneous case attempts to correct this by creating a more complicated prior distribution of objects by taking into account structures seen in the observed distribution. In both cases though, it is assumed that the [[probability density function]] is Gaussian with constant variance and a mean of the true average log distance, which is far from accurate.  However, this method is debated and may not be accurate in any implementation due to uncertainties in calculating the raw, observed distance estimates causing the assumptions to use this method to be invalid.&lt;ref name=Hendry1993 /&gt;

=== Historical alternatives ===
The term 'Malmquist bias' has not always been definitively used to refer to the bias outlined above. As recently as the year 2000, the Malmquist bias has appeared in the literature clearly referring to different types of bias and statistical effect.&lt;ref name="Murdin2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Murdin|first=Paul|chapter=Malmquist, Gunnar (1893–1982)|title=Encyclopedia of Astronomy and Astrophysics|date=2000|doi=10.1888/0333750888/3837|bibcode=2000eaa..bookE3837. |isbn=0-333-75088-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common of these other uses is to refer to an effect that takes place with a [[Limiting magnitude|magnitude limited]] sample, but in this case the low [[absolute magnitude]] objects are overrepresented.  In a sample with a [[Limiting magnitude|magnitude limit]], there will be a margin of error near that boundary where objects that should be bright enough to make the cut are excluded and objects that are slightly below the limit are instead included. Since low [[absolute magnitude]] objects are more common than brighter ones, and since these dimmer galaxies are more likely to be below the cutoff line and scattered up, while the brighter ones are more likely to be above the line and scattered down, an over-representation of the lower [[luminosity]] objects result. However, in modern-day literature and consensus, the Malmquist bias refers to the effect outlined above.

'''Mechanical Engineering Technology''' is the application of engineering principles and technological developments for the creation of useful [[Product (business)|product]]s and production machinery.

==Technologists==
Mechanical engineering technologists are expected to apply current technologies and principles from machine and product design, production and material and manufacturing processes.

Expandable specialties may include aerospace, automotive, energy, nuclear, petroleum, manufacturing, product development, and [[industrial design]]. 

Mechanical engineering technologists can have many different titles, including in the United States: 
* Mechanical Engineering Technologist
* Mechanical Engineer 
* Product Engineering Technologist
* Mechanical Designer
* Product Development Engineering Technologist
* Manufacturing Engineering Technologist 

===Training===
Mechanical Engineering Technology coursework is less theoretical, and more application based than a [[mechanical engineering]] degree.  This is evident through the additional laboratory coursework required for a degree.  The ability to apply concepts from the [[chemical engineering]] and [[electrical engineering]] fields is important. 

Some university Mechanical Engineering Technology degree programs require mathematics through [[differential equation]]s and [[statistics]].  Most courses involve algebra and calculus.

Oftentimes, a MET graduate could get hired as an engineer; job titles may include Mechanical Engineer and Manufacturing Engineer. In the U.S. it is possible to get an associates or bachelor's degree.  Individuals with a bachelor's degree in engineering technology may continue on to complete the E.I.T. (Engineer in Training) examination to eventually become Professional Engineers if the program is [[ABET]] accredited.

==Applications==
Software tools such as [[Finite Element Analysis]] (FEA) and [[Computational Fluid Dynamics]] (CFD) are often used to analyze parts and assemblies. 3D models can be made to represent parts and assemblies with [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) software. 

Through the application of [[computer-aided manufacturing]] (CAM), models may also be used directly by software to create "instructions" for the manufacture of objects represented by the models, through computer numerically controlled (CNC) machining or other automated processes.

'''Micro-sustainability''' focuses on the small [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]al actions that collectively result in a large [[environmental impact]]. Micro-sustainability centers on individual efforts, [[behavior modification]] and creating attitudinal changes, which result in an environmentally conscious individual or community. Micro-sustainability encourages sustainable changes through "change agents", which are individuals that are encouraged; and therefore, foster positive environmental action inside their [[sphere of influence]]. Examples of micro-sustainability include [[recycling]], [[power saving]] by turning off unused lights, programming [[thermostat]]s for efficient [[energy use|use of energy]], reducing [[water usage]], changing [[driving habits]] or patterns in order to use less gasoline or modifying [[buying habits]] to reduce waste and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]]. The focus is on individual actions, rather than organizational practices. These narrow, small ticket, community level actions have immediate local benefits. If widely imitated, they have a cumulative,&lt;ref name=transformative&gt;[http://www.grist.org/article/2010-02-01-how-personal-actions-can-kick-start-a-sustainability-revolution How personal actions can kick-start a sustainability revolution | Grist&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; broader impact.

The remaining large-scale plans for [[sustainability]], categorized under the term ''macro-sustainability'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://jessestallone.com/2009/12/29/micro-vs-macro-sustainability/|title=Micro vs Macro Sustainability|date=2009-12-29|work=Jesse Stallone|access-date=2018-08-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Macro-economics of mineral and water resources.|last = Kisor|first = Kaulir|publisher = Capital Publishing Company|year = 2015|isbn = |location = India|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; are in most cases addressed by governments, multi-national corporations or companies. They combat [[global issue]]s including [[climate change]], and reliance upon [[petroleum]]-based energy sources. Businesses primarily focus on the business case and return on investment of changes such as their source of energy or the way they transport or manufacture products. Governments confront these larger issues through increased regulation, subsidies, and investment in new technologies and energy sources.

'''Museum education''' is a specialized field devoted to developing and strengthening  the education role of non-formal education spaces and institutions such as museums. Its main objective is to engage visitors in learning experiences to enhance their curiosity and interest on their objects and collections. [[File:Dallas Museum of Art 06.jpg|thumb|Educational exhibition on "Materials &amp; Meanings" at the [[Dallas Museum of Art]].]]

In a seminal report called ''Excellence and Equity''&lt;ref name="aam1992"&gt;{{cite book|title=Excellence and Equity|year=1992|publisher=American Association of Museums|isbn=978-0-931201-14-1|url=http://iweb.aam-us.org/Purchase/ProductDetail.aspx?Product_code=I277}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1992 by the American Association of Museums (now the [http://aam-us.org/about-us American Alliance of Museums]), the educational role of museums was identified as the core to museums' service to the public. According to the report, "...the public dimensions of museums leads them to perform the public service of education—a term that in its broadest sense includes exploration, study, observation, critical thinking, contemplation and dialogue". As museum education has developed as a field of study and interest in its own right, efforts have been made to record its history and to establish a research agenda to strengthen its position as a discipline in the wider work of museums.

== History ==

=== Non-formal education ===

In his first report as the first Assistant Secretary of State for Education and Culture during [[John F. Kennedy]]'s administration, in 1968, [[Philip H. Coombs]] emphasized the increment of the educative needs of the world’s population after World War II. In it, he mentions the diversity of non-formal education activities that constitute, or should constitute an important complement to formal education to the total educational efforts of any country.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Pastor Homs, Ma. Inmaculada (2001). «La necesidad de planificación y evaluación educativas en la educación no formal. Algunas propuestas». ''Educació i Cultura'': 14, 87-89.&lt;/ref&gt; To Coombs, non-formal education had the potential to satisfy the learning demands of both, individuals and collectivities, because unlike formal and traditional education, which is rigid with its contents and programs, it is flexible and, when planning and designing educational activities, it takes into consideration local variations of culture, economy and society, which counteracts the tendency of developing countries to just imitate education models of developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;Pastor Homs, Ma. Inmaculada (2011 [2004]). «1». ''Pedagogía museística. Nuevas perspectivas y tendencias actuales''. Ariel. p. 15. {{ISBN|978-84-344-6974-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a work written by Coombs in conjunction with M. Ahmed, non-formal education is defined as "...any organized educational activity outside the established formal system—whether operating separately or as an important feature of some broader activity—that is intended to serve identifiable learning clienteles and learning objective".&lt;ref&gt;Coombs, Phillips H. and H. Ahmed. ''New Paths To Learning: For Rural Children and Youth'' (en inglés). New York, N.Y.: International Council for Educational Development Publications. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  Afterwards, Coombs and Ahmed add the idea that non-formal education is any systematic educative activity, organized outside from the official framework to facilitate educative experiences for all people, regardless of age, genre, nationality, social, economic or health situation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Throughout his career, Coombs encouraged and impulsed the professional development of people responsible of non-formal education, which will be determining to the development and professionalization of the educative areas in institutions devoted to non-formal education.

=== Beginnings in art museums of the United States ===

At the turn of the twentieth century, art museums were very new institutions to the average visitor, who was seen wandering with no clear direction through the galleries, and with no clear idea on how to appreciate and study the exhibitions. In 1906, architect J. Randolph Coolidge Jr. was appointed the temporary director of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. He experimented with a guiding system in the galleries, to help visitors orient themselves throughout their walk across the exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;Burnham, Rika and, Elliot Kai-Kee (2011). «2». ''Teaching in the Art Museum. Interpretation as Experience''(en inglés). J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles. {{ISBN|978-1-60606-058-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An article published in the June bulletin of the museum that same year, features one of the first uses of the term docent and the description of its functions:&lt;blockquote&gt;"It has been proposed to the Trustees to consider the permanent appointment of one or more persons of intelligence and education who could act as intermediaries between Curators and the many who would be glad to avail themselves of trained instruction in our galleries. Through these docents, as it has been proposed to call them, the heads of departments could instruct many more persons than it would be possible for them to accompany through the galleries; and illustrated lectures upon the collections prepared in the departments might be regularly given by these specially qualified aids both in the Museum and in the class rooms of neighboring schools and colleges."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/jstor-4423283/4423283_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "The Educational Work of the Museum.

'''Music theory''' is the study of the practices and possibilities of [[music]]. ''The Oxford Companion to Music'' describes three interrelated uses of the term "music theory":

&lt;blockquote&gt;The first is what is otherwise called '[[Elements of music|rudiments]]', currently taught as the elements of notation, of key signatures, of time signatures, of rhythmic notation, and so on. [...] The second is the study of writings about music from ancient times onwards. [...] The third is an area of current musicological study that seeks to define processes and general principles in music — a sphere of research that can be distinguished from analysis in that it takes as its starting-point not the individual work or performance but the fundamental materials from which it is built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fallows|first1=David|title=Theory|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/opr/t114/e6759.|website=The Oxford Companion to Music|publisher=Oxford Music Online|accessdate=11 September 2016}}{{Dead link|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Music theory is frequently concerned with describing how musicians and composers make music, including tuning systems and composition methods among other topics. Because of the ever-expanding conception of what constitutes music (see [[Definition of music]]), a more inclusive definition could be that music theory is the consideration of any sonic phenomena, including silence, as they relate to music. This is not an absolute guideline; for example, the study of "music" in the ''[[Quadrivium]]'' liberal arts university curriculum that was common in medieval Europe was an abstract system of proportions that was carefully studied at a distance from actual musical practice.&lt;ref&gt;See Boethius's ''De institutione musica'', in which he disdains "musica instrumentalis" as beneath the "true" musician who studies music in the abstract: ''Multo enim est maius atque auctius scire, quod quisque faciat, quam ipsum illud efficere, quod sciat'' ("It is much better to know what one does than to do what one knows").&lt;/ref&gt; However, this medieval discipline became the basis for tuning systems in later centuries, and it is generally included in modern scholarship on the history of music theory.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, chapters 4–7 of Christensen, Thomas (2002). ''The Cambridge History of Western Music Theory''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Music theory as a practical discipline encompasses the methods and concepts [[composers]] and other musicians use in creating music. The development, preservation, and transmission of music theory in this sense may be found in oral and written music-making traditions, musical instruments, and other artifacts. For example, ancient instruments from [[Music of ancient Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia]], [[Chinese Music|China]],{{sfn|Latham|2002|loc=15–17}} and prehistoric sites around the world reveal details about the music they produced and potentially something of the musical theory that might have been used by their makers (see [[History of music]] and [[Musical instrument]]). In ancient and living cultures around the world, the deep and long roots of music theory are clearly visible in instruments, oral traditions, and current music making. Many cultures, at least as far back as ancient Mesopotamia and ancient China, have also considered music theory in more formal ways such as written treatises and music notation. Practical and scholarly traditions overlap, as many practical treatises about music place themselves within a tradition of other treatises, which are cited regularly just as scholarly writing cites earlier research.

In modern academia, music theory is a subfield of [[musicology]], the wider study of musical cultures and history. Etymologically, ''music theory'' is an act of contemplation of music, from the Greek θεωρία, a looking at, viewing, contemplation, speculation, theory, also a sight, a spectacle.{{sfn|OED|2005}} As such, it is often concerned with abstract musical aspects such as tuning and tonal systems, scales, consonance and dissonance, and rhythmic relationships, but there is also a body of theory concerning practical aspects, such as the creation or the performance of music, orchestration, ornamentation, improvisation, and electronic sound production.{{sfn|Palisca and Bent|n.d.|loc=Theory, theorists. 1. Definitions}} A person who researches, teaches, or writes articles about music theory is a music theorist. University study, typically to the [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] or [[Ph.D]] level, is required to teach as a tenure-track music theorist in a US or Canadian university. Methods of analysis include mathematics, graphic analysis, and especially analysis enabled by Western music notation. Comparative, descriptive, statistical, and other methods are also used. Music theory textbooks, especially in the United States of America, often include elements of [[musical acoustics]], considerations of [[musical notation]], and techniques of tonal [[Musical composition|composition]] ([[harmony]] and [[counterpoint]]), among other topics.

==History==

===Prehistory===
{{Main article|Prehistoric music}}

Preserved prehistoric instruments, artifacts, and later depictions of performance in artworks can give clues to the structure of pitch systems in prehistoric cultures. See for instance [[Paleolithic flutes]], [[Gudi (instrument)|Gǔdí]], and [[Anasazi flute]].

===Antiquity===

====Mesopotamia====
{{see also|Music of Mesopotamia}}

Several surviving Sumerian and Akkadian clay tablets include musical information of a theoretical nature, mainly lists of intervals and tunings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mirelman|2010}}; {{harvnb|Mirelman|2013}}; {{harvnb|Wulstan|1968}}; {{harvnb|Kümmel|1970}}; {{harvnb|Kilmer|1971}}; {{harvnb|Kilmer and Mirelman|n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scholar Sam Mirelman reports that the earliest of these texts dates from before 1500&amp;nbsp;BCE, a millennium earlier than surviving evidence from any other culture of comparable musical thought. Further, "All the Mesopotamian texts [about music] are united by the use of a terminology for music that, according to the approximate dating of the texts, was in use for over 1,000 years."{{sfn|Mirelman|2013|loc=43–44}}

====China====
{{see also|Music of China|Chinese musicology}}

Much of Chinese music history and theory remains unclear.&lt;ref name="oxfordmusiconline.com"&gt;Joseph S.C. Lam, "China.", §II, "History and Theory", ''Grove Music Online''. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press, accessed November 15, 2015, http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/43141pg2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest texts about Chinese music theory are inscribed on the stone and bronze bells excavated in 1978 from the tomb of Marquis Yi (died 433&amp;nbsp;BCE) of the Zeng state. They include more than 2800 words describing theories and practices of music pitches of the time. The bells produce two intertwined pentatonic scales three tones apart with additional pitches completing the chromatic scale.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bagley, "The Prehistory of Chinese Music Theory", ''Proceedings of the British Academy'' 131, 2004 (Lectures), pp. 41–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese theory starts from numbers, the main musical numbers being twelve, five and eight. Twelve refers to the number of pitches on which the scales can be constructed. The [[Lüshi chunqiu]] from about 239&amp;nbsp;BCE recalls the legend of Ling Lun. On order of the Yellow Emperor, Ling Lun collected twelve bamboo lengths with thick and even nodes. Blowing on one of these like a pipe, he found its sound agreeable and named it ''huangzhong'', the "Yellow Bell." He then heard phoenixes singing. The male and female phoenix each sang six tones. Ling Lun cut his bamboo pipes to match the pitches of the phoenixes, producing twelve pitch pipes in two sets: six from the male phoenix and six from the female: these were called the ''lülü'' or later the ''shierlü''.{{sfn|Service|2013}}

The ''lülü'' formed the ritual scale to which many instruments were tuned. The name of the lowest sound, ''huangzhong'' also implied 'musical correctness.' Its pitch formed a pitch standard, setting the base pitch of zithers, flutes and singers of imperial court orchestras. Straight-walled pitch pipes without finger holes were made of cast metal, their lengths specified by court regulations.{{sfn|Crease|2011|loc=40–41}} The resulting chromatic scale provided twelve fundamental notes for the construction of the musical scales themselves. The ''lülü'' also has a cosmological value: its notes describe the energetic frequency of the twelve months of the year, the daily rhythm of the twelve bi-hours of the Chinese clock, the twelve main acupuncture meridians, etc.{{sfn|Wu and Wu|2014|loc=41–42}}

The two sets of tones (male and female) dividing the twelve-tone scale were generated by the "Method of Subtracting and Adding Thirds," or ''sanfen sunyi'', which involved alternately rising a fifth and descending a fourth through the subtraction or addition of a third of the length of the preceding pitch pipe. The resulting pitches produced by adding a third (and descending a fourth) were referred to by [[Sima Qian]] in the [[Records of the Grand Historian]] (91&amp;nbsp;BCE) as pitches of "superior generation," that is, the pitches of Ling Lun’s male phoenix; the pitches produced by subtracting a third (and ascending a fifth) were referred to as pitches of "inferior generation," that is, the pitches of Ling Lun’s female phoenix.{{sfn|Service|2013}}

"Apart from technical and structural aspects, ancient Chinese music theory also discusses topics such as the nature and functions of music. The ''Yueji'' ("Record of music", c1st and 2nd centuries BCE), for example, manifests Confucian moral theories of understanding music in its social context. Studied and implemented by Confucian scholar-officials [...], these theories helped form a musical Confucianism that overshadowed but did not erase rival approaches. These include the assertion of Mozi (c468–c376&amp;nbsp;BCE) that music wasted human and material resources, and Laozi’s claim that the greatest music had no sounds. [...] Even the music of the ''qin'' zither, a genre closely affiliated with Confucian scholar-officials, includes many works with Daoist references, such as ''Tianfeng huanpei'' ("Heavenly Breeze and Sounds of Jade Pendants")."&lt;ref name="oxfordmusiconline.com"/&gt;

====India====
The [[Samaveda]] and [[Yajurveda]] (c. 1200 – 1000&amp;nbsp;BCE) are among the earliest testimonies of Indian music, but they contain no theory properly speaking. The [[Natya Shastra]], written between 200&amp;nbsp;BCE to 200&amp;nbsp;CE, discusses intervals (''Śrutis''), scales (''Grāmas''), consonances and dissonances, classes of melodic structure (''Mūrchanās'', modes?), melodic types (''Jātis''), instruments, etc.&lt;ref&gt;''The Nāțyaśāstra, A Treatise on Hindu Dramaturgy and Histrionics, attributed to Bharata-Muni'', translated from the Sanskrit with introduction and notes by Manomohan Ghosh, vol. II, Calcutta, The Asiatic Society, 1961. See particularly pp. 5–19 of the Introduction, ''The Ancient Indian Theory and Practice of Music''.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Greece====
{{see also|Musical system of ancient Greece|List of music theorists#Antiquity}}

Early preserved Greek writings on music theory include two types of works:&lt;ref&gt;Thomas J. Mathiesen, "Greek Music Theory", ''The Cambridge History of Western Music Theory'', Th. Christensen ed., Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2002, pp. 112–113.&lt;/ref&gt;
* technical manuals describing the Greek musical system including notation, scales, consonance and dissonance, rhythm, and types of musical compositions
* treatises on the way in which music reveals universal patterns of order leading to the highest levels of knowledge and understanding.
Several names of theorists are known before these works, including [[Pythagoras]] (c. 570 – c. 495&amp;nbsp;BCE), [[Philolaus]] (c. 470 – c. 385&amp;nbsp;BCE), [[Archytas]] (428–347&amp;nbsp;BCE), and others.

Works of the first type (technical manuals) include
* Anonymous (erroneously attributed to [[Euclid]]) ''Division of the Canon'', Κατατομή κανόνος, 4th–3rd century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;English translation in Andrew Barker, ''Greek Musical Writings'', vol. 2: ''Harmonic and Acoustic Theory'', Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1989, pp. 191–208.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Theon of Smyrna]], ''On Mathematics Useful for the Understanding of Plato'', Τωv κατά τό μαθηματικόν χρησίμων είς τήν Πλάτωνος άνάγνωσις, 115–140&amp;nbsp;CE.
* [[Nicomachus#Manual of Harmonics|Nicomachus of Gerasa]], ''Manual of Harmonics'', Άρμονικόν έγχειρίδιον, 100–150&amp;nbsp;CE
* [[Cleonides]], ''Introduction to Harmonics'', Είσαγωγή άρμονική, 2nd century CE.

* [[Alypius of Alexandria|Alypius]], ''Introduction to Music'', Είσαγωγή μουσική, 4th–5th century CE.

More philosophical treatises of the second type include
* [[Aristoxenus]], ''Harmonic Elements'', Άρμονικά στοιχεία, 375/360 – after 320&amp;nbsp;BCE.
* [[Aristoxenus]], ''Rhythmic Elements'', Ρυθμικά στοιχεία.
* Claudius [[Ptolemy]], ''Harmonics'', Άρμονικά, 127–148&amp;nbsp;CE.
* [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyrius]], ''On Ptolemy's Harmonics'', Είς τά άρμονικά Πτολεμαίον ύπόμνημα, 232/3-c. 305&amp;nbsp;CE.

===Middle Ages===

====China====
Some imported early Chinese instruments became important components of the entertainment music of the [[Sui dynasty|Sui]] (581–618) and [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] (618–907) courts: the bent-neck [[pipa]] (quxiang pipa), the [[Guan (instrument)|bili]], the [[konghou]] and the [[jiegu]]. They generated not only new repertories and performing practices but also new music theories. The pipa, for example, carried with it a theory of musical modes that subsequently led to the Sui and Tang theory of 84 musical modes.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph S.C.

====Europe====
The Latin treatise ''De institutione musica'' by the Roman philosopher [[Boethius]] (written c. 500) was a touchstone for other writings on music in medieval Europe. Boethius represented Classical authority on music during the Middle Ages, as the Greek writings on which he based his work were not read or translated by later Europeans until the 15th century.{{sfn|Palisca and Bent|n.d.|loc=§5 Early Middle Ages}} This treatise carefully maintains distance from the actual practice of music, focusing mostly on the mathematical proportions involved in tuning systems and on the moral character of particular modes. Several centuries later, treatises began to appear which dealt with the actual composition of pieces of music in the [[plainchant]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Palisca and Bent|n.d.|loc=Theory, theorists §5 Early Middle Ages}}: "Boethius could provide a model only for that part of theory which underlies but does not give rules for composition or performance. The first surviving strictly musical treatise of Carolingian times is directed towards musical practice, the Musica disciplina of Aurelian of Réôme (9th century)."&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the ninth century, [[Hucbald]] worked towards more precise pitch notation for the [[neume]]s used to record plainchant.

[[Guido d'Arezzo]]' wrote in 1028 a letter to Michael of Pomposa, entitled ''Epistola de ignoto cantu'',&lt;ref&gt;For a modern edition of the letter, see [http://www.hs-augsburg.de/~harsch/gui_epi.html].&lt;/ref&gt; in which he introduced the practice of using syllables to describe notes and intervals. This was the source of the hexachordal [[solmization]] that was to be used until the end of the Middle Ages. Guido also wrote about emotional qualities of the modes, the phrase structure of plainchant, the temporal meaning of the neumes, etc.; his chapters on polyphony "come closer to describing and illustrating real music than any previous account" in the Western tradition.{{sfn|Palisca and Bent|n.d.|loc=§5 Early Middle Ages}}

During the thirteenth century, a new rhythm system called [[mensural notation]] grew out of an earlier, more limited method of notating rhythms in terms of fixed repetitive patterns, the so-called rhythmic modes, which were developed in France around 1200. An early form of mensural notation was first described and codified in the treatise ''Ars cantus mensurabilis'' ("The art of measured chant") by [[Franco of Cologne]] (c. 1280). Mensural notation used different note shapes to specify different durations, allowing scribes to capture rhythms which varied instead of repeating the same fixed pattern; it is a proportional notation, in the sense that each note value is equal to two or three times the shorter value, or half or a third of the longer value. This same notation, transformed through various extensions and improvements during the Renaissance, forms the basis for rhythmic notation in European classical music today.

As Western musical influence spread throughout the world in the 1800s, musicians adopted Western theory as an international standard—but other theoretical traditions in both textual and oral traditions remain in use. For example, the long and rich musical traditions unique to ancient and current cultures of Africa are primarily oral, but describe specific forms, genres, performance practices, tunings, and other aspects of music theory.{{sfn|Kubik|2010|loc=passim}}{{sfn|Ekwueme|1974|loc=passim}}

[[Sacred Harp]] music uses a different kind of scale and theory in practice. The music focuses around the solfege "fa, sol, la" on the music scale. Sacred Harp also employs a different notation involving "shape notes", or notes that are shaped to correspond to a certain solfege syllable on the music scale. Sacred Harp music and its music theory originated with Reverend Thomas Symmes in 1720, where he developed a system for "singing by note" in order to help his church members with note accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Sacred Harp: A Tradition and Its Music|last=Cobb, Jr.|first=Buell E.|publisher=The University of Georgia Press Athens|year=1978|isbn=0-8203-0426-3|location=United States of America|pages=4–5, 60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fundamentals of music==
{{Main article|Aspect of music}}
Music is composed of [[aural]] phenomena; "music theory" considers how those phenomena apply in music. Music theory considers melody, rhythm, counterpoint, harmony, form, tonal systems, scales, tuning, intervals, consonance, dissonance, durational proportions, the acoustics of pitch systems, composition, performance, orchestration, ornamentation, improvisation, electronic sound production, etc.{{sfn|Palisca and Bent|n.d.}}

===Pitch===
{{Main article|Pitch (music)}}
[[File:Middle C.png|thumb|Middle C (261.626&amp;nbsp;Hz) {{audio|Middle C.mid|Play}}.]]
Pitch is the lowness or highness of a [[Musical tone|tone]], for example the difference between [[middle C]] and a higher C. The frequency of the sound waves producing a pitch can be measured precisely, but the perception of pitch is more complex because single notes from natural sources are usually a complex mix of many frequencies. Accordingly, theorists often describe pitch as a subjective sensation.{{sfn|Hartmann|2005|loc={{Page needed|date=August 2014}}}}

Specific frequencies are often assigned letter names. Today most orchestras assign [[Concert A]] (the A above [[middle C]] on the piano) to the frequency of 440&amp;nbsp;Hz. This assignment is somewhat arbitrary; for example, in 1859 France, the same A was tuned to 435&amp;nbsp;Hz. Such differences can have a noticeable effect on the timbre of instruments and other phenomena. Thus, in [[historically informed performance]] of older music, tuning is often set to match the tuning used in the period when it was written. Additionally, many cultures do not attempt to standardize pitch, often considering that it should be allowed to vary depending on genre, style, mood, etc.

The difference in pitch between two notes is called an [[interval (music)|interval]]. The most basic interval is the [[unison]], which is simply two notes of the same pitch. The [[octave]] interval is two pitches that are either double or half the frequency of one another. The unique characteristics of octaves gave rise to the concept of [[pitch class]]: pitches of the same letter name that occur in different octaves may be grouped into a single "class" by ignoring the difference in octave. For example, a high C and a low C are members of the same pitch class—the class that contains all C's. {{sfn|Bartlette and Laitz|2010|loc={{Page needed|date=October 2014}}}}

[[Musical tuning|Musical tuning systems]], or temperaments, determine the precise size of intervals. Tuning systems vary widely within and between world cultures. In [[Western culture]], there have long been several competing tuning systems, all with different qualities. Internationally, the system known as [[equal temperament]] is most commonly used today because it is considered the most satisfactory compromise that allows instruments of fixed tuning (e.g. the piano) to sound acceptably in tune in all keys.

===Scales and modes===
{{Main article|Musical scale| Musical mode}}
[[File:C major scale.png|thumb|upright=1.3|A pattern of whole and half steps in the Ionian mode or major scale on C {{audio|Ionian mode C.mid|Play}}.]]
Notes can be arranged in a variety of [[scale (music)|scale]]s and [[musical mode|modes]]. Western music theory generally divides the octave into a series of twelve tones, called a [[chromatic scale]], within which the interval between adjacent tones is called a half step or [[semitone]]. Selecting tones from this set of 12 and arranging them in patterns of semitones and whole tones creates other scales.{{sfn|Touma|1996|loc={{Page needed|date=August 2014}}}}

The most commonly encountered scales are the seven-toned [[major scale|major]], the [[harmonic minor]], the [[melodic minor]], and the [[natural minor]]. Other examples of scales are the [[octatonic scale]] and the [[pentatonic]] or five-tone scale, which is common in [[folk music]] and [[blues]]. Non-Western cultures often use scales that do not correspond with an equally divided twelve-tone division of the octave. For example, classical [[Ottoman classical music|Ottoman]], [[Persian classical music|Persian]], [[Indian classical music|Indian]] and [[Arabic music|Arabic]] musical systems often make use of multiples of quarter tones (half the size of a semitone, as the name indicates), for instance in 'neutral' seconds (three quarter tones) or 'neutral' thirds (seven quarter tones)—they do not normally use the quarter tone itself as a direct interval.{{sfn|Touma|1996|loc={{Page needed|date=August 2014}}}}

In traditional Western notation, the scale used for a composition is usually indicated by a [[key signature]] at the beginning to designate the pitches that make up that scale. As the music progresses, the pitches used may change and introduce a different scale. Music can be [[Transposition (music)|transposed]] from one scale to another for various purposes, often to accommodate the range of a vocalist. Such transposition raises or lowers the overall pitch range, but preserves the intervallic relationships of the original scale. For example, transposition from the key of C major to D major raises all pitches of the scale of C major equally by a [[whole tone]]. Since the interval relationships remain unchanged, transposition may be unnoticed by a listener, however other qualities may change noticeably because transposition changes the relationship of the overall pitch [[range (music)|range]] compared to the range of the instruments or voices that perform the music. This often affects the music's overall sound, as well as having technical implications for the performers.{{sfn|Forsyth|1935|loc=73–74}}

The interrelationship of the keys most commonly used in Western tonal music is conveniently shown by the [[circle of fifths]]. Unique key signatures are also sometimes devised for a particular composition. During the Baroque period, emotional associations with specific keys, known as the [[doctrine of the affections]], were an important topic in music theory, but the unique tonal colorings of keys that gave rise to that doctrine were largely erased with the adoption of equal temperament. However, many musicians continue to feel that certain keys are more appropriate to certain emotions than others. [[Indian classical music]] theory continues to strongly associate keys with emotional states, times of day, and other extra-musical concepts and notably, does not employ equal temperament.

===Consonance and dissonance===
{{Main article|Consonance and dissonance}}
{{double image|right|Perfect octave on C.png|175|Minor second on C.png|175|The [[perfect octave]], a consonant interval {{audio|Perfect octave on C.mid|Play}}|The [[minor second]], a dissonant interval {{audio|Minor second on C.mid|Play}}|A consonance|A dissonance}}
[[Consonance and dissonance]] are subjective qualities of the sonority of intervals that vary widely in different cultures and over the ages.
Consonance (or concord) is the quality of an interval or chord that seems stable and complete in itself. Dissonance (or discord) is the opposite in that it feels incomplete and "wants to" resolve to a consonant interval. Dissonant intervals seem to clash. Consonant intervals seem to sound comfortable together. Commonly, perfect fourths, fifths, and octaves and all major and minor thirds and sixths are considered consonant. All others are dissonant to greater or lesser degree.{{sfn|Latham|2002|loc={{Page needed|date=August 2014}}}}

Context and many other aspects can affect apparent dissonance and consonance. For example, in a Debussy prelude, a major second may sound stable and consonant, while the same interval may sound dissonant in a Bach fugue. In the Common Practice era, the perfect fourth is considered dissonant when not supported by a lower third or fifth. Since the early 20th century, [[Arnold Schoenberg]]’s concept of "emancipated" dissonance, in which traditionally dissonant intervals can be treated as "higher," more remote consonances, has become more widely accepted.{{sfn|Latham|2002|loc={{Page needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;!--Better would be the title of the article in this dictionary, added to the entry in the list of references, in which case a page number would be superfluous.--&gt;}}

===Rhythm===
{{Main article|Rhythm}}
[[File:Metric levels.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Metric level]]s: beat level shown in middle with division levels above and multiple levels below.]]
Rhythm is produced by the sequential arrangement of sounds and silences in time. [[Metre (music)|Meter]] measures music in regular pulse groupings, called [[Bar (music)|measures or bars]]. The [[time signature]] or meter signature specifies how many beats are in a measure, and which value of written note is counted or felt as a single beat.

Through increased stress, or variations in duration or articulation, particular tones may be accented. There are conventions in most musical traditions for regular and hierarchical accentuation of beats to reinforce a given meter. [[Syncopation|Syncopated]] rhythms contradict those conventions by accenting unexpected parts of the beat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Syncopation|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/opr/t237/e10023|website=Oxford Dictionary of Music|accessdate=11 August 2017|quote="Syncopation is achieved by accenting a weak instead of a strong beat, by putting rests on strong beats, by holding on over strong beats, and by introducing a sudden change of time‐signature."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Playing simultaneous rhythms in more than one time signature is called [[polyrhythm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Polyrhythm|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/22059|website=Grove Music Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=11 August 2017|quote="The superposition of different rhythms or metres."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, rhythm and meter have become an important area of research among music scholars. The most highly cited of these recent scholars are [[Maury Yeston]],{{sfn|Yeston|1976}} [[Fred Lerdahl]] and [[Ray Jackendoff]],{{sfn|Lerdahl and Jackendoff|1985}} [[Jonathan Kramer]],{{sfn|Kramer|1988}}  and [[Justin London]].{{sfn|London|2004}}

===Melody===

A [[melody]] is a series of tones sounding in succession that typically move toward a climax of tension then resolve to a state of rest. Because melody is such a prominent aspect in so much music, its construction and other qualities are a primary interest of music theory.

The basic elements of melody are pitch, duration, rhythm, and tempo. The tones of a melody are usually drawn from pitch systems such as [[Musical scale|scales]] or [[Musical mode|modes]]. Melody may consist, to increasing degree, of the figure, motive, semi-phrase, antecedent and consequent phrase, and period or sentence. The period may be considered the complete melody, however some examples combine two periods, or use other combinations of constituents to create larger form melodies.{{sfn|Stein|1979|loc=3–47}}

===Chord===
{{Main article|Chord (music)}}
[[File:C triad.svg|thumb|upright=0.5|C Major triad represented in [[staff notation]].&lt;br /&gt;{{Audio|Just major triad on C.mid|Play}} in [[just intonation]]&lt;br /&gt;{{Audio|Major triad on C.mid|Play}} in [[Equal temperament]]&lt;br /&gt;{{Audio|Quarter-comma meantone major chord on C.mid|Play}} in [[Meantone temperament|1/4-comma meantone]]&lt;br /&gt;{{Audio|Young temperament major chord on C.mid|Play}} in [[Young temperament]]&lt;br /&gt;{{Audio|Pythagorean major chord on C.mid|Play}} in [[Pythagorean tuning]] ]]
A chord, in [[music]], is any [[harmony|harmonic]] set of three or more [[Musical note|note]]s that is heard as if sounding [[Simultaneity (music)|simultaneously]].{{sfn|Benward and Saker|2003|loc=67, 359|quote=A ''chord'' is a harmonic unit with at least three different tones sounding simultaneously." "A combination of three or more pitches sounding at the same time.}}{{sfn|Károlyi|1965|loc=63|quote=Two or more notes sounding simultaneously are known as a ''chord''.}} These need not actually be played together: [[arpeggio]]s and broken chords may, for many practical and theoretical purposes, constitute chords. Chords and [[Chord progression|sequences of chords]] are frequently used in modern Western, West African,{{sfn|Mitchell|2008}} and Oceanian{{sfn|Linkels|n.d.|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;!--Specific page citation within this twelve-page article needed.--&gt;}} music, whereas they are absent from the music of many other parts of the world.{{sfn|Malm|1996|loc=15|quote=Indeed this harmonic orientation is one of the major differences between Western and much non-Western music.}}

The most frequently encountered chords are [[Triad (music)|triads]], so called because they consist of three distinct notes: further notes may be added to give [[seventh chord]]s, [[extended chord]]s, or [[added tone chord]]s. The most [[Common chord (music)|common chord]]s are the ''[[major chord|major]]'' and ''[[minor chord|minor]] [[Triad (music)|triads]]'' and then the ''[[augmented triad|augmented]]'' and ''[[diminished triad|diminished]] [[Triad (music)|triads]]''. The descriptions ''major'', ''minor'', ''augmented'', and ''diminished'' are sometimes referred to collectively as chordal ''quality''. Chords are also commonly classed by their [[root (chord)|root]] note—so, for instance, the chord '''C''' major may be described as a triad of major quality built on the note '''C'''. Chords may also be classified by [[Inverted chord|inversion]], the order in which the notes are stacked.

A series of chords is called a [[chord progression]]. Although any chord may in principle be followed by any other chord, certain patterns of chords have been accepted as establishing [[Key (music)|key]] in [[Common practice harmony|common-practice harmony]]. To describe this, chords are numbered, using [[Roman numerals]] (upward from the key-note),{{sfn|Schoenberg|1983|loc=1–2}} per their [[diatonic function]]. Common ways of [[#Notation|notating or representing chords]]{{sfn|Benward and Saker|2003|loc=77}} in western music other than conventional [[staff notation]] include [[Roman numerals#Music theory|Roman numerals]], [[figured bass]] (much used in the [[Baroque music|Baroque era]]), [[Macro analysis|macro symbols]] (sometimes used in modern [[musicology]]), and various systems of [[chord chart]]s typically found in the [[lead sheet]]s used in [[Chord names and symbols (popular music)|popular music]] to lay out the sequence of chords so that the musician may play accompaniment chords or improvise a solo.

===Harmony===
{{Main article|Harmony}}
[[File:US Navy 080615-N-7656R-003 Navy Band Northwest's Barbershop Quartet win the hearts of the audience with a John Philip Sousa rendition of.jpg|thumb|[[Barbershop quartet]]s, such as this US Navy group, sing 4-part pieces, made up of a melody line (normally the second-highest voice, called the "lead") and 3 harmony parts.]]
In [[music]], harmony is the use of simultaneous [[pitch (music)|pitches]] ([[timbre|tones]], [[note (music)|notes]]), or [[chord (music)|chords]].{{sfn|Malm|1996|loc=15|quote=Homophonic texture...is more common in Western music, where tunes are often built on chords (harmonies) that move in progressions. Indeed this harmonic orientation is one of the major differences between Western and much non-Western music.}} The study of harmony involves chords and their construction and [[chord progression]]s and the principles of connection that govern them.{{sfn|Dahlhaus|2009}} Harmony is often said to refer to the "vertical" aspect of music, as distinguished from [[melody|melodic line]], or the "horizontal" aspect.{{sfn|Jamini|2005|loc=147}} [[Counterpoint]], which refers to the interweaving of melodic lines, and [[polyphony]], which refers to the relationship of separate independent voices, are thus sometimes distinguished from harmony.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In [[popular harmony|popular]] and [[jazz harmony]], chords are named by their [[root (chord)|root]] plus various terms and characters indicating their qualities. For example, a [[lead sheet]] may indicate chords such as C major, D minor, and G dominant seventh. In many types of music, notably Baroque, Romantic, modern, and jazz, chords are often augmented with "tensions". A tension is an additional chord member that creates a relatively [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonant interval]] in relation to the bass. Typically, in the classical [[common practice period]] a dissonant chord (chord with tension) "resolves" to a consonant chord. [[Harmonization]] usually sounds pleasant to the ear when there is a balance between the consonant and dissonant sounds. In simple words, that occurs when there is a balance between "tense" and "relaxed" moments.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Timbre===
{{Main article|Timbre}}
[[File:9577 Guitarz1970 Clean E9 Guitar Chord (Mike Tribulas).jpg|thumb|right|[[Spectrogram]] of the first second of an E9 chord played on a Fender Stratocaster guitar with noiseless pickups. Below is the E9 chord audio:
[[File:9577 Guitarz1970 Clean E9 Guitar Chord (Mike Tribulas).ogg]] ]]Timbre, sometimes called "color", or "tone color," is the principal phenomenon that allows us to distinguish one instrument from another when both play at the same pitch and volume, a quality of a voice or instrument often described in terms like bright, dull, shrill, etc. It is of considerable interest in music theory, especially because it is one component of music that has as yet, no standardized nomenclature. It has been called "...the psychoacoustician's multidimensional waste-basket category for everything that cannot be labeled pitch or loudness,"{{sfn|McAdams and Bregman|1979|loc=34}} but can be accurately described and analyzed by [[Fourier analysis]] and other methods{{sfn|Mannell|n.d.}} because it results from the combination of all sound [[Audio frequency|frequencies]], attack and release envelopes, and other qualities that a tone comprises.

[[Timbre]] is principally determined by two things: (1) the relative balance of [[overtones]] produced by a given instrument due its construction (e.g. shape, material), and (2) the [[Envelope (waves)|envelope]] of the sound (including changes in the overtone structure over time). Timbre varies widely between different instruments, voices, and to lesser degree, between instruments of the same type due to variations in their construction, and significantly, the performer's technique. The timbre of most instruments can be changed by employing different techniques while playing. For example, the timbre of a trumpet changes when a mute is inserted into the bell, the player changes their embouchure, or volume.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

A voice can change its timbre by the way the performer manipulates their vocal apparatus, (e.g. the shape of the vocal cavity or mouth). Musical notation frequently specifies alteration in timbre by changes in sounding technique, volume, accent, and other means. These are indicated variously by symbolic and verbal instruction. For example, the word ''dolce'' (sweetly) indicates a non-specific, but commonly understood soft and "sweet" timbre. ''Sul tasto'' instructs a string player to bow near or over the fingerboard to produce a less brilliant sound. ''Cuivre'' instructs a brass player to produce a forced and stridently brassy sound. Accent symbols like ''marcato'' (^) and dynamic indications (''pp'') can also indicate changes in timbre.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

====Dynamics====
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}
{{Relevance inline|section|date=September 2015|reason=What has this entire section to do with theory?}}
{{Main article|Dynamics (music)}}
[[File:Music hairpins.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|An illustration of hairpins in musical notation.]]
In music, "[[dynamics (music)|dynamics]]" normally refers to variations of intensity or volume, as may be measured by physicists and audio engineers in [[decibels]] or [[phon]]s. In music notation, however, dynamics are not treated as absolute values, but as relative ones. Because they are usually measured subjectively, there are factors besides amplitude that affect the performance or perception of intensity, such as timbre, vibrato, and articulation.

The conventional indications of dynamics are abbreviations for Italian words like ''forte'' ('''''f''''') for loud and ''piano'' ('''''p''''') for soft. These two basic notations are modified by indications including ''mezzo piano'' ('''''mp''''') for moderately soft (literally "half soft") and ''mezzo forte'' ('''''mf''''') for moderately loud, ''sforzando'' or ''sforzato'' ('''''sfz''''') for a surging or "pushed" attack, or ''fortepiano'' ('''''fp''''') for a loud attack with a sudden decrease to a soft level. The full span of these markings usually range from a nearly inaudible ''pianissississimo'' ('''''pppp''''') to a loud-as-possible ''fortissississimo'' ('''''ffff''''').

Greater extremes of '''''pppppp''''' and '''''fffff''''' and nuances such as '''''p+''''' or ''più piano'' are sometimes found. Other systems of indicating volume are also used in both notation and analysis: dB (decibels), numerical scales, colored or different sized notes, words in languages other than Italian, and symbols such as those for progressively increasing volume (''crescendo'') or decreasing volume (''decrescendo''), often called "[[Dynamics (music)|hairpins]]" when indicated with diverging or converging lines as shown in the graphic above.

====Articulation====
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}
{{Main article|Articulation (music)}}
[[File:Notation accents1.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Examples of articulation marks. From left to right: [[staccato]], [[staccatissimo]], [[martellato]], [[marcato]],{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}&lt;!--The linked article says there are two symbols commonly used to indicate "marcato": the one so indicated here, and the one that is here described as "martellato". Which authority says the latter is incorrect?--&gt; [[tenuto]].]]
Articulation is the way the performer sounds notes. For example, ''[[staccato]]'' is the shortening of duration compared to the written note value, ''[[legato]]'' performs the notes in a smoothly joined sequence with no separation. Articulation is often described rather than quantified, therefore there is room to interpret how to execute precisely each articulation.

For example, ''staccato'' is often referred to as "separated" or "detached" rather than having a defined or numbered amount by which to reduce the notated duration. Violin players use a variety of techniques to perform different qualities of ''staccato.'' The manner in which a performer decides to execute a given articulation is usually based on the context of the piece or phrase, but many articulation symbols and verbal instructions depend on the instrument and musical period (e.g. viol, wind; classical, baroque; etc.).

There are a set of articulations that most instruments and voices perform in common. They are—from long to short: ''legato'' (smooth, connected); ''[[tenuto]]'' (pressed or played to full notated duration); ''[[marcato]]'' (accented and detached); ''staccato'' ("separated", "detached"); ''[[martelé (bowstroke)|martelé]]'' (heavily accented or "hammered"). Many of these can be combined to create certain "in-between" articulations. For example, ''[[portato]]'' is the combination of ''tenuto'' and ''staccato''. Some instruments have unique methods by which to produce sounds, such as ''[[spicatto]]'' for bowed strings, where the bow bounces off the string.

===Texture===
{{Main article|Musical texture}}
[[File:Sousa - "Washington Post March," m. 1-7.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Introduction to [[John Philip Sousa|Sousa]]'s "[[The Washington Post (march)|Washington Post March]]," mm. 1–7{{audio|Sousa - "Washington Post March," m. 1-7.mid|Play}} features [[octave doubling]] {{sfn|Benward and Saker|2003|p=133}} and a homorhythmic texture.]]
In [[music]], texture is how the [[melody|melodic]], [[rhythm]]ic, and [[harmony|harmonic]] materials are combined in a [[musical composition|composition]], thus determining the overall quality of the sound in a piece. Texture is often described in regard to the density, or thickness, and [[range (music)|range]], or width, between lowest and highest pitches, in relative terms as well as more specifically distinguished according to the number of voices, or parts, and the relationship between these voices. For example, a thick texture contains many "layers" of instruments. One of these layers could be a string section, or another brass.

The thickness also is affected by the amount and the richness of the instruments playing the piece. The thickness varies from light to thick. A lightly textured piece will have light, sparse scoring. A thickly or heavily textured piece will be scored for many instruments. A piece's texture may be affected by the number and character of parts playing at once, the [[timbre]] of the instruments or voices playing these parts and the harmony, [[tempo]], and rhythms used.{{sfn|Benward and Saker|2003|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}}} The types categorized by number and relationship of parts are analyzed and determined through the labeling of primary textural elements: primary melody, secondary melody, parallel supporting melody, static support, harmonic support, rhythmic support, and harmonic and rhythmic support.{{sfn|Isaac and Russell|2003|loc=136}}

Common types included [[monophonic]] texture (a single melodic voice, such as a piece for solo soprano or solo flute), biphonic texture (two melodic voices, such as a duo for bassoon and flute in which the bassoon plays a drone note and the flute plays the melody), [[polyphonic]] texture and [[homophonic]] texture (chords accompanying a melody).{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}&lt;!--Especially for the drone accompaniment, which is usually regarded as a type of monophony.--&gt;

===Form or structure===

{{Main article|Musical form}}
The term musical form (or musical architecture) refers to the overall structure or plan of a piece of music, and it describes the layout of a composition as divided into sections.{{sfn|Brandt|2007}} In the tenth edition of ''[[The Oxford Companion to Music]]'', [[Percy Scholes]] defines musical form as "a series of strategies designed to find a successful mean between the opposite extremes of unrelieved repetition and unrelieved alteration."{{sfn|Scholes|1977}} According to [[Richard Middleton (musicologist)|Richard Middleton]], musical form is "the shape or structure of the work." He describes it through difference: the distance moved from a [[Repetition (music)|repeat]]; the latter being the smallest difference. Difference is quantitative and qualitative: ''how far'', and ''of what type'', different. In many cases, form depends on statement and [[Restatement (music)|restatement]], unity and variety, and [[contrast (music)|contrast]] and connection.{{sfn|Middleton|1999|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}}}

===Expression===
{{Main article|Musical expression}}
[[File:1Francisco20violinista.jpg|thumb|Right|220px|A violinist performing]]
Musical expression is the art of playing or singing music with emotional communication. The elements of music that comprise expression include dynamic indications, such as forte or piano, [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]], differing qualities of timbre and articulation, color, intensity, energy and excitement. All of these devices can be incorporated by the performer. A performer aims to elicit responses of sympathetic feeling in the audience, and to excite, calm or otherwise sway the audience's physical and emotional responses. Musical expression is sometimes thought to be produced by a combination of other parameters, and sometimes described as a transcendent quality that is more than the sum of measurable quantities such as pitch or duration.

Expression on instruments can be closely related to the role of the breath in singing, and the voice's natural ability to express feelings, sentiment and deep emotions.{{clarify|date=July 2015}}&lt;!--Does this mean that keyboard and stringed instruments are essentially inexpressive?--&gt; Whether these can somehow be categorized is perhaps the realm of academics, who view expression as an element of musical performance that embodies a consistently recognizable [[emotion]], ideally causing a [[emotional contagion|sympathetic emotional response]] in its listeners.{{sfn|London|n.d.}} The emotional content of musical expression is distinct from the emotional content of specific sounds (e.g., a startlingly-loud 'bang') and of learned associations (e.g., a [[national anthem]]), but can rarely be completely separated from its context.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

The components of musical expression continue to be the subject of extensive and unresolved dispute.{{sfn|Avison|1752|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;!--Where does Avison say there is a continuing and unresolved dispute?--&gt;}}{{sfn|Christiani|1885|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;!--Where does Christiani say there is a continuing and unresolved dispute?--&gt;}}{{sfn|Lussy|1892|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;!--On what page(s) does Lussy state there is an extensive and unresolved dispute, or indeed that there is any dispute at all?--&gt;}}{{sfn|Darwin|1913|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;!--Where does Darwin state that there is a continuing and unresolved dispute?--&gt;}}{{sfn|Sorantin|1932|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;!--On what page(s) does Sorantin contend that there is an extensive and unresolved dispute on thesubject?--&gt;}}{{sfn|Davies|1994|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;!--On what page does Davies say the components of expression continue to be subject to unresolved dispute?

===Notation===
{{Main article|Musical notation|Sheet music}}
[[File:Tibetanmusicalscore.jpg|thumb|[[Tibet]]an musical score from the 19th century]]
Musical notation is the written or symbolized representation of music. This is most often achieved by the use of commonly understood graphic symbols and written verbal instructions and their abbreviations. There are many systems of music notation from different cultures and different ages. Traditional Western notation evolved during the Middle Ages and remains an area of experimentation and innovation.{{Sfnm|Read|1969|1loc={{Page needed|date=August 2014}}|Stone|1980|2loc={{Page needed|date=August 2014}}}}In the 2000s, computer [[file formats]] have become important as well.{{sfn|Castan|2009}} Spoken language and [[Kodály Method#Hand signs|hand signs]] are also used to symbolically represent music, primarily in teaching.

In standard Western music notation, tones are represented graphically by symbols (notes) placed on a [[Staff (music)|staff]] or staves, the vertical axis corresponding to pitch and the horizontal axis corresponding to time. Note head shapes, stems, flags, ties and dots are used to indicate duration. Additional symbols indicate keys, dynamics, accents, rests, etc. Verbal instructions from the [[Conducting|conductor]] are often used to indicate tempo, technique, and other aspects.

In Western music, a range of different music notation systems are used. In Western [[Classical music]], conductors use printed scores that show all of the instruments' parts and orchestra members read parts with their musical lines written out. In popular styles of music, much less of the music may be notated. A rock band may go into a recording session with just a handwritten [[chord chart]] indicating the song's [[chord progression]] using chord names (e.g., C major, D minor, G7, etc.). All of the chord voicings, rhythms and accompaniment figures are improvised by the band members.

==Music theory as academic discipline==
The scholarly study of music theory in the twentieth century has a number of different subfields, each of which takes a different perspective on what are the primary phenomenon of interest and the most useful methods for investigation.

===Analysis===
{{Main article|Musical analysis|Schenkerian analysis|Transformational theory}}
[[File:Debussy Pelleas et Melisande prelude opening.PNG|thumb|upright=1.3|Typically a given work is analyzed by more than one person and different or divergent analyses are created. For instance, the first two bars of the prelude to [[Claude Debussy]]'s ''[[Pelléas et Mélisande (opera)|Pelléas et Melisande]]''
are analyzed differently by Leibowitz, Laloy, van Appledorn, and Christ. Leibowitz analyses this succession harmonically as D minor:I-VII-V, ignoring melodic motion, Laloy analyses the succession as D:I-V, seeing the G in the second measure as an [[musical ornamentation|ornament]], and both van Appledorn and Christ analyses the succession as D:I-VII.

Musical analysis is the attempt to answer the question ''how does this music work?'' The method employed to answer this question, and indeed exactly what is meant by the question, differs from analyst to analyst, and according to the purpose of the analysis. According to [[Ian Bent]], "analysis, as a pursuit in its own right, came to be established only in the late 19th century; its emergence as an approach and method can be traced back to the 1750s. However, it existed as a scholarly tool, albeit an auxiliary one, from the [[Middle Ages]] onwards."{{sfn|Bent|1987|loc=6}} [[Adolf Bernhard Marx]] was influential in formalising concepts about composition and music understanding towards the second half of the 19th century. The principle of analysis has been variously criticized, especially by composers, such as [[Edgard Varèse]]'s claim that, "to explain by means of [analysis] is to decompose, to mutilate the spirit of a work".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{harvnb|Bernard|1981|loc=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Schenkerian analysis]] is a method of musical analysis of tonal music based on the theories of [[Heinrich Schenker]] (1868–1935). The goal of a Schenkerian analysis is to interpret the underlying structure of a tonal work and to help reading the score according to that structure. The theory's basic tenets can be viewed as a way of defining [[tonality]] in music. A Schenkerian analysis of a passage of music shows hierarchical relationships among its pitches, and draws conclusions about the structure of the passage from this hierarchy. The analysis makes use of a specialized symbolic form of musical notation that Schenker devised to demonstrate various [[Schenkerian analysis#Techniques of prolongation|techniques of elaboration]]. The most fundamental concept of Schenker's theory of tonality may be that of ''tonal space''.&lt;ref&gt;Schenker described the concept in a paper titled ''Erläuterungen'' ("Elucidations"), which he published four times between 1924 and 1926: ''Der Tonwille'' {{Full citation needed|date=August 2015}} vol. 8–9, pp. 49–51, vol. 10, pp. 40–2; ''Das Meisterwerk in der Musik'', {{Full citation needed|date=August 2015}} vol. 1, pp. 201–05; 2, p. 193-97. English translation, ''Der Tonwille'',{{Full citation needed|date=August 2015}} vol. 2, p. 117-18 (the translation, although made from vols. 8–9 of the German original, gives as original pagination that of ''Das Meisterwerk'' {{Full citation needed|date=August 2015}} 1; the text is the same). The concept of tonal space is still present in {{harvtxt|Schenker|n.d.|loc=especially § 13}}, but less clearly than in the earlier presentation.&lt;/ref&gt; The intervals between the notes of the tonic triad form a ''tonal space'' that is filled with passing and neighbour notes, producing new triads and new tonal spaces, open for further elaborations until the surface of the work (the score) is reached.

Although Schenker himself usually presents his analyses in the generative direction, starting from the [[fundamental structure]] (''Ursatz'') to reach the score, the practice of Schenkerian analysis more often is reductive, starting from the score and showing how it can be reduced to its fundamental structure. The graph of the ''Ursatz'' is arrhythmic, as is a strict-counterpoint cantus firmus exercise.{{sfn|Schenker|n.d.|loc=§ 21{{Page needed|date=July 2015}}}} Even at intermediate levels of the reduction, rhythmic notation (open and closed noteheads, beams and flags) shows not rhythm but the hierarchical relationships between the pitch-events. Schenkerian analysis is ''subjective''. There is no mechanical procedure involved and the analysis reflects the musical intuitions of the analyst.{{sfn| Snarrenberg|1997|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}}} The analysis represents a way of hearing (and reading) a piece of music.

Transformational theory is a branch of music theory developed by [[David Lewin]] in the 1980s, and formally introduced in his 1987 work, ''Generalized Musical Intervals and Transformations''. The theory, which models [[Transformation (music)|musical transformations]] as elements of a [[Group theory|mathematical group]], can be used to analyze both [[tonality|tonal]] and [[atonal music]]. The goal of transformational theory is to change the focus from musical objects—such as the "C [[major chord]]" or "G major chord"—to relations between objects. Thus, instead of saying that a C major chord is followed by G major, a transformational theorist might say that the first chord has been "transformed" into the second by the "[[dominant (music)|Dominant]] operation."  (Symbolically, one might write "Dominant(C major) = G major.")  While traditional [[set theory (music)|musical set theory]] focuses on the makeup of musical objects, transformational theory focuses on the [[interval (music)|intervals]] or types of musical motion that can occur. According to Lewin's description of this change in emphasis, "[The transformational] attitude does not ask for some observed measure of extension between reified 'points'; rather it asks: 'If I am ''at'' s and wish to get to t, what characteristic ''gesture'' should I perform in order to arrive there?'"{{sfn|Lewin|1987|loc=159}}

===Music perception and cognition===
[[File:Diana deutsch scale fig3b.jpg|upright=1.3|thumb|[[Deutsch's scale illusion]]: an [[auditory illusion]] in which two scales are presented with successive tones alternating between each ear but are perceived as simultaneous, unbroken scales.{{sfn|Bregman|1994|loc=76}}]]
{{Further information|Music psychology|Fred Lerdahl|Ray Jackendoff}}
Music psychology or the psychology of music may be regarded as a branch of both [[psychology]] and [[musicology]]. It aims to explain and understand [[music]]al [[behavior]] and [[experience]], including the processes through which music is perceived, created, responded to, and incorporated into everyday life.{{sfn|Tan, Peter, and Rom|2010|loc=2}}{{sfn|Thompson|n.d.|loc=320}} Modern music psychology is primarily [[Empirical research|empirical]]; its knowledge tends to advance on the basis of interpretations of data collected by systematic [[observation]] of and interaction with [[Human subject research|human participants]]. Music psychology is a field of research with practical relevance for many areas, including music [[musical technique|performance]], [[music composition|composition]], [[music education|education]], [[music criticism|criticism]], and [[music therapy|therapy]], as well as investigations of human [[aptitude]], [[skill]], [[intelligence]], [[creativity]], and [[social behavior]].

Music psychology can shed light on non-psychological aspects of [[musicology]] and musical practice. For example, it contributes to music theory through investigations of the [[perception]] and [[Cognitive musicology|computational modelling]] of musical structures such as [[melody]], [[harmony]], [[tonality]], [[rhythm]], [[Meter (music)|meter]], and [[Musical form|form]]. Research in [[music history]] can benefit from systematic study of the history of [[musical syntax]], or from psychological analyses of composers and compositions in relation to perceptual, affective, and social responses to their music. [[Ethnomusicology]] can benefit from psychological approaches to the study of [[Culture in music cognition|music cognition in different cultures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=QCfUoD4m7E4C&amp;pg=PA27&amp;lpg=PA27&amp;dq=Ethnomusicology+can+benefit+from+psychological+approaches+to+the+study+of+music+cognition+in+different+cultures.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=S1ffy-zJ_D&amp;sig=MHHfRNiZSsLSqtelThi5cvmrZnQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiezMnRypXZAhUJSY8KHVgoApcQ6AEISDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Ethnomusicology%20can%20benefit%20from%20psychological%20approaches%20to%20the%20study%20of%20music%20cognition%20in%20different%20cultures.&amp;f=false|title=Time in Indian Music: Rhythm, Metre, and Form in North Indian Rag Performance|last=Martin|first=Clayton|last2=Clayton|first2=Martin|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195339680|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===Genre and technique===
{{Main article|Music genre|Musical technique}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F008930-0019, Beethovenhalle Bonn, Kammerkonzert Kölner Trio.jpg|thumb|A Classical [[piano trio]] is a group that plays [[chamber music]], including [[sonata]]s. The term "piano trio" also refers to works composed for such a group.]]
A music genre is a conventional category that identifies some pieces of [[music]] as belonging to a shared tradition or set of conventions.{{sfn|Samson|n.d.}} It is to be distinguished from ''[[musical form]]'' and ''musical style'', although in practice these terms are sometimes used interchangeably.{{sfn|Wong|2011}}{{Failed verification|date=December 2014}}&lt;!--An electronic search of this web article finds only one occurrence of the word "form", as part of the compound expression ; the word "style" does not occur at all. As a result, this citation confirms neither the claim that genre should be distinguished from form and style, nor the claim that they are sometimes used interchangeably in practice.--&gt;

Music can be divided into different [[genres]] in many different ways. The artistic nature of music means that these classifications are often subjective and controversial, and some genres may overlap. There are even varying academic definitions of the term ''genre ''itself. In his book ''Form in Tonal Music'', Douglass M. Green distinguishes between genre and [[Musical form|form]]. He lists [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]], [[motet]], [[canzona]], [[ricercar]], and dance as examples of genres from the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] period. To further clarify the meaning of ''genre'', Green writes, "Beethoven's Op. 61 and Mendelssohn's Op. 64 are identical in genre—both are violin concertos—but different in form. However, Mozart's Rondo for Piano, K. 511, and the ''Agnus Dei'' from his Mass, K. 317 are quite different in genre but happen to be similar in form."{{sfn|Green|1979|loc=1}} Some, like [[Peter van der Merwe (musicologist)|Peter van der Merwe]], treat the terms ''genre'' and ''style'' as the same, saying that ''genre'' should be defined as pieces of music that came from the same style or "basic musical language."{{sfn|van der Merwe|1989|loc=3}}

Others, such as Allan F. Moore, state that ''genre'' and ''style'' are two separate terms, and that secondary characteristics such as subject matter can also differentiate between genres.{{sfn|Moore|2001|loc=432–33}} A music genre or subgenre may also be defined by the [[musical technique]]s, the style, the cultural context, and the content and spirit of the themes. Geographical origin is sometimes used to identify a music genre, though a single geographical category will often include a wide variety of subgenres. Timothy Laurie argues that "since the early 1980s, genre has graduated from being a subset of popular music studies to being an almost ubiquitous framework for constituting and evaluating musical research objects".{{sfn|Laurie|2014|loc=284}}

Musical technique is the ability of [[musical instrument|instrumental]] and [[Human voice|vocal]] musicians to exert optimal control of their instruments or [[vocal cords]] to produce precise musical effects. Improving technique generally entails practicing exercises that improve muscular sensitivity and agility. To improve technique, musicians often practice fundamental patterns of notes such as the [[Natural minor|natural]], [[Minor scale|minor]], [[Major scale|major]], and [[chromatic scale]]s, [[Minor triad|minor]] and [[major triad]]s, [[Dominant seventh chord|dominant]] and [[diminished seventh]]s, formula patterns and [[arpeggio]]s. For example, [[Triad (music)|triads]] and [[Seventh chord|sevenths]] teach how to play chords with accuracy and speed. [[Scale (music)|Scales]] teach how to move quickly and gracefully from one note to another (usually by step). Arpeggios teach how to play [[broken chord]]s over larger intervals. Many of these components of music are found in compositions, for example, a scale is a very common element of [[Classical music|classical]] and [[Romantic music|romantic]] era compositions.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

[[Heinrich Schenker]] argued that musical technique's "most striking and distinctive characteristic" is [[repetition (music)|repetition]].{{sfn|Kivy|1993|loc=327}} Works known as [[étude]]s (meaning "study") are also frequently used for the improvement of technique.

===Mathematics===
{{Main article|Music and mathematics}}
[[Music]] theorists sometimes use [[mathematics]] to understand music, and although music has no [[axiomatic]] foundation in modern mathematics, mathematics is "the basis of sound" and sound itself "in its musical aspects... exhibits a remarkable array of number properties", simply because nature itself "is amazingly mathematical".{{sfn|Smith Brindle|1987|loc=42–43}} The attempt to structure and communicate new ways of composing and hearing music has led to musical applications of [[set theory]], [[abstract algebra]] and [[number theory]]. Some composers have incorporated the [[golden ratio]] and [[Fibonacci numbers]] into their work.{{sfn|Smith Brindle|1987|loc=chapter 6, ''passim''}}{{sfn|Garland and Kahn|1995|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}}} There is a long history of examining the relationships between music and mathematics. Though ancient Chinese, Egyptians and Mesopotamians are known to have studied the mathematical principles of sound,{{sfn|Smith Brindle|1987|loc=42}} the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] (in particular [[Philolaus]] and [[Archytas]]){{sfn|Purwins|2005|loc=22–24}} of ancient Greece were the first researchers known to have investigated the expression of [[musical scale]]s in terms of numerical [[ratio]]s.
[[File:HarmonicIdentities.Names.Frequencies.svg|thumb|right|400px|The first 16 harmonics, their names and frequencies, showing the exponential nature of the octave and the simple fractional nature of non-octave harmonics.]]
In the modern era, musical [[set theory]] uses the language of mathematical set theory in an elementary way to organize musical objects and describe their relationships. To analyze the structure of a piece of (typically atonal) music using musical set theory, one usually starts with a set of tones, which could form motives or chords. By applying simple operations such as [[transposition (music)|transposition]] and [[Melodic inversion|inversion]], one can discover deep structures in the music. Operations such as transposition and inversion are called [[isometries]] because they preserve the intervals between tones in a set. Expanding on the methods of musical set theory, some theorists have used abstract algebra to analyze music. For example, the pitch classes in an equally tempered octave form an [[abelian group]] with 12 elements. It is possible to describe [[just intonation]] in terms of a [[free abelian group]].{{sfn|Wohl|2005}}

===Serial composition and set theory===
[[File:Berg's Lyric Suite Mov. I tone row B-P.PNG|thumb|Tone row from [[Alban Berg]]'s ''[[Lyric Suite (Berg)|Lyric Suite]]'', mov. I. {{audio|Berg's Lyric Suite Mov. I tone row B-P.mid|Play}}]]
{{Further information|serialism|set theory (music)|Arnold Schoenberg|Milton Babbitt|David Lewin|Allen Forte}}
In music theory, serialism is a method or technique of [[Musical composition|composition]] that uses a series of values to manipulate different [[aspect of music|musical elements]]. Serialism began primarily with [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s [[twelve-tone technique]], though his contemporaries were also working to establish serialism as one example of [[atonality|post-tonal]] thinking. Twelve-tone technique orders the twelve notes of the [[chromatic scale]], forming a [[tone row|row]] or series and providing a unifying basis for a composition's [[melody]], [[harmony]], structural progressions, and [[variation (music)|variations]]. Other types of serialism also work with [[set (music)|sets]], collections of objects, but not necessarily with fixed-order series, and extend the technique to other musical dimensions (often called "[[parameter (music)|parameters]]"), such as [[duration (music)|duration]], [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]], and [[timbre]]. The idea of serialism is also applied in various ways in the [[visual arts]], [[design]], and [[architecture]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bandur|2001|loc=5, 12, 74}}; {{harvnb|Gerstner|1964|loc=passim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Integral serialism" or "total serialism" is the use of series for aspects such as duration, dynamics, and register as well as pitch. {{sfn|Whittall|2008|loc=273}} Other terms, used especially in Europe to distinguish post–World War II serial music from twelve-tone music and its American extensions, are "general serialism" and "multiple serialism".{{sfn|Grant|2001|loc=5–6}}

Musical set theory provides concepts for categorizing musical objects and describing their relationships. Many of the notions were first elaborated by [[Howard Hanson]] (1960) in connection with tonal music, and then mostly developed in connection with atonal music by theorists such as [[Allen Forte]] (1973), drawing on the work in twelve-tone theory of Milton Babbitt. The concepts of set theory are very general and can be applied to tonal and atonal styles in any equally tempered tuning system, and to some extent more generally than that.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

One branch of musical set theory deals with collections (sets and permutations) of pitches and pitch classes (pitch-class set theory), which may be ordered or unordered, and can be related by musical operations such as [[Transposition (music)|transposition]], [[Melodic inversion|inversion]], and [[Complement (music)|complementation]]. The methods of musical set theory are sometimes applied to the analysis of rhythm as well.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Musical semiotics===
{{Further information|music semiology|Jean-Jacques Nattiez}}
[[File:Roman Jakobson.jpg|thumb|upright|Semiotician [[Roman Jakobson]]]]
Music semiology ([[semiotics]]) is the study of signs as they pertain to [[music]] on a variety of levels. Following [[Roman Jakobson]], [[Kofi Agawu]] adopts the idea of musical semiosis being introversive or extroversive—that is, musical signs within a text and without.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} "Topics," or various musical conventions (such as horn calls, dance forms, and styles), have been treated suggestively by Agawu, among others.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} The notion of [[Musical Gestures|gesture]] is beginning to play a large role in musico-semiotic enquiry.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

:"There are strong arguments that music inhabits a semiological realm which, on both [[ontogenetic]] and [[phylogenetic]] levels, has developmental priority over verbal language."{{sfn|Middleton|1990|loc=172}}{{sfn|Nattiez|1976}}{{sfn|Nattiez|1990}}{{sfn|Nattiez1989}}{{sfn|Stefani|1973}}{{sfn|Stefani|1976}}{{sfn|Baroni|1983}}{{sfn|''Semiotica''|1987|loc=66:1–3}}{{clarify |date=November 2018|reason=The quotation cannot stem from all these references at once!}}

Writers on music semiology include Kofi Agawu (on topical theory,{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} [[Heinrich Schenker]],{{sfn|Dunsby and Stopford|1981|loc=49-53}}{{sfn|Meeùs|2017|loc=81-96}} Robert Hatten (on topic, gesture){{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}, [[Raymond Monelle]] (on topic, musical meaning){{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}, [[Jean-Jacques Nattiez]] (on introversive taxonomic analysis and ethnomusicological applications){{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}, [[Anthony Newcomb]] (on narrativity){{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}, and [[Eero Tarasti]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} (generally considered the founder of musical semiotics).

[[Roland Barthes]], himself a semiotician and skilled [[amateur]] pianist, wrote about music in ''Image-Music-Text,''{{Full citation needed|date=July 2015}} ''The Responsibilities of Form,''{{Full citation needed|date=July 2015}} and ''Eiffel Tower,''{{Full citation needed|date=July 2015}} though he did not consider music to be a semiotic system{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}.

Signs, meanings in music, happen essentially through the connotations of sounds, and through the social construction, appropriation and amplification of certain meanings associated with these connotations. The work of [[Philip Tagg]] (''Ten Little Tunes'',{{Full citation needed|date=July 2015}} ''Fernando the Flute'',{{Full citation needed|date=July 2015}} ''Music’s Meanings''{{Full citation needed|date=July 2015}}) provides one of the most complete and systematic analysis of the relation between musical structures and connotations in western and especially popular, television and film music. The work of [[Leonard Meyer]] in ''Style and Music''{{Full citation needed|date=July 2015}} theorizes the relationship between ideologies and musical structures and the phenomena of style change, and focuses on romanticism as a case study.

===Education and careers===
[[File:Pat Carpenter picture.JPG|thumb|[[Columbia University]] music theorist Pat Carpenter in a 2013 photo]]
Music theory in the practical sense has been a part of education at conservatories and music schools for centuries, but the status music theory currently has within academic institutions is relatively recent. In the 1970s, few universities had dedicated music theory programs, many music theorists had been trained as composers or historians, and there was a belief among theorists that the teaching of music theory was inadequate and that the subject was not properly recognised as a scholarly discipline in its own right.&lt;ref name=GroveSMT&gt;{{cite web|last=McCreless|first=Patrick|title=Society for Music Theory|work=[[Grove Music Online]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A growing number of scholars began promoting the idea that music theory should be taught by theorists, rather than composers, performers or music historians.&lt;ref name=GroveSMT/&gt; This led to the founding of the [[Society for Music Theory]] in the United States in 1977. In Europe, the French ''[http://www.sfam.org Société d'Analyse musicale]'' was founded in 1985. It called the First European Conference of Music Analysis for 1989, which resulted in the foundation of the ''[http://www.sbam.be/index.html Société belge d'Analyse musicale]'' in Belgium and the ''[http://www.gatm.it Gruppo analisi e teoria musicale]'' in Italy the same year, the ''[http://www.sma.ac.uk Society for Music Analysis]'' in the UK in 1991, the ''[http://verenigingvoormuziektheorie.net Vereniging voor Muziektheorie]'' in the Netherlands in 1999 and the ''[http://www.gmth.de/home.aspx Gesellschaft für Musiktheorie]'' in Germany in 2000.{{sfn|Meeùs|2015|loc=111}} They were later followed by the [http://eng.otmroo.ru Russian Society for Music Theory] in 2013 and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20180328133232/http://ptam.org.pl/ Polish Society for Music Analysis] in 2015, and others are in construction. These societies coordinate the publication of music theory scholarship and support the professional development of music theory researchers.

As part of their initial training, music theorists will typically complete a [[B.Mus]] or a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in music (or a related field) and in many cases an M.A. in music theory. Some individuals apply directly from a bachelor's degree to a Ph.D, and in these cases, they may not receive an M.A. In the 2010s, given the increasingly interdisciplinary nature of university graduate programs, some applicants for music theory Ph.D programs may have academic training both in music and outside of music (e.g., a student may apply with a B.Mus and a Masters in Music Composition or Philosophy of Music).

Most music theorists work as instructors, lecturers or professors in [[college]]s, [[University|universities]] or [[Music school|conservatories]]. The job market for tenure-track professor positions is very competitive.{{Vague|date=August 2015}}&lt;!--How competitive is "very"? As competitive as for, say, a position as an airline pilot?--&gt; Applicants must hold a completed Ph.D or the equivalent degree (or expect to receive one within a year of being hired—called an "ABD", for "[[All But Dissertation]]" stage) and (for more senior positions) have a strong record of publishing in peer-reviewed journals. Some Ph.D-holding music theorists are only able to find insecure positions as [[sessional lecturer]]s. The job tasks of a music theorist are the same as those of a professor in any other humanities discipline: teaching undergraduate and/or graduate classes in this area of specialization and, in many cases some general courses (such as [[Music appreciation|Music Appreciation]] or Introduction to Music Theory), conducting research in this area of expertise, publishing research articles in peer-reviewed journals, authoring book chapters, books or textbooks, traveling to conferences to present papers and learn about research in the field, and, if the program includes a [[graduate school]], supervising M.A. and Ph.D students and giving them guidance on the preparation of their theses and dissertations. Some music theory professors may take on senior administrative positions in their institution, such as [[Dean (education)|Dean]] or [[Chairman|Chair]] of the School of Music.

[[File:Coal mine Wyoming.jpg|thumb|right|325px|A [[coal mining|coal mine]] in [[Wyoming]], [[United States]]. [[Coal]], produced over millions of years, is a finite and non-renewable resource on a human time scale.]]

A '''non-renewable resource''' (also called a '''finite resource''') is a resource that does not renew itself at a sufficient rate for sustainable economic extraction in meaningful human time-frames. An example is carbon-based, organically-derived fuel. The original organic material, with the aid of heat and pressure, becomes a fuel such as oil or gas. [[Earth]] [[mineral]]s and [[metal]] [[ore]]s, [[fossil fuel]]s ([[coal]], [[petroleum]], [[natural gas]]) and [[groundwater]] in certain [[aquifer]]s are all considered non-renewable resources, though individual [[Chemical element|element]]s are almost always conserved.

On the other hand, resources such as [[timber]] (when [[Sustainable forest management|harvested sustainably]]) and wind (used to power energy conversion systems) are considered [[renewable resource]]s, largely because their localized replenishment can occur within time frames meaningful to humans.

== Earth minerals and metal ores ==
{{Main article|Mineral|Ore}}
{{Further information|Mining}}

[[Earth]] minerals and [[metal]] ores are examples of non-renewable resources. The metals themselves are present in vast amounts in Earth's [[crust (geology)|crust]], and their extraction by humans only occurs where they are concentrated by [[Ore genesis|natural geological processes]] (such as heat, pressure, organic activity, weathering and other processes) enough to become economically viable to extract. These processes generally take from tens of thousands to millions of years, through [[plate tectonics]], [[tectonic subsidence]] and [[crustal recycling]].

The localized deposits of metal ores near the surface which can be extracted economically by humans are non-renewable in human time-frames. There are certain [[rare earth mineral]]s and [[rare earth element|elements]] that are more scarce and exhaustible than others. These are in high demand in [[manufacturing]], particularly for the [[electronics industry]].

Most metal ores are considered vastly greater in supply to fossil fuels, because metal ores are formed by crustal-scale processes which make up a much larger portion of the Earth's near-surface environment, than those that form fossil fuels which are limited to areas where carbon-based life forms flourish, die, and are quickly buried.

== Fossil fuels ==
{{Main article|Fossil fuel}}
{{Further information|Oil depletion}}

Natural resources such as [[coal]], [[petroleum]] (crude oil) and [[natural gas]] take thousands of years to form naturally and cannot be replaced as fast as they are being consumed. Eventually it is considered that fossil-based resources will become too costly to harvest and humanity will need to shift its reliance to other sources of energy such as solar or wind power, see [[renewable energy]].

An alternative hypothesis is that carbon based fuel is virtually inexhaustible in human terms, if one includes all sources of carbon-based energy such as methane hydrates on the sea floor, which are vastly greater than all other carbon based fossil fuel resources combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://worldoceanreview.com/en/wor-1/energy/methane-hydrates/ |title=Methane hydrates |website=Worldoceanreview.com |access-date=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sources of carbon are also considered non-renewable, although their rate of formation/replenishment on the sea floor is not known. However their extraction at economically viable costs and rates has yet to be determined.

At present, the main energy source used by humans is non-renewable [[fossil fuels]].  Since the dawn of [[internal combustion engine]] technologies in the 19th century, petroleum and other fossil fuels have remained in continual demand.  As a result, conventional [[infrastructure]] and [[transport]] systems, which are fitted to combustion engines, remain prominent throughout the globe.  The continual use of fossil fuels at the current rate is believed to increase [[global warming]] and cause more severe [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=America's Climate Choices: Panel on Advancing the Science of Climate Change; National Research Council|title=Advancing the Science of Climate Change |year=2010|publisher=The National Academies Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0-309-14588-0|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12782}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nuclear fuels ==
[[File:Arandis Mine quer.jpg|thumb|[[Rössing uranium mine]] is the longest-running and one of the largest [[open pit]] uranium mines in the world, in 2005 it produced eight percent of global uranium oxide needs(3,711 tons).&lt;ref name="infomine"&gt;[http://www.infomine.com/minesite/minesite.asp?site=rossing Rössing] (from infomine.com, status Friday 30 September 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; The most productive mines however are the underground [[McArthur River uranium mine]] in Canada which produces 13% of the world's uranium, and the similarly underground poly-metallic [[Olympic Dam mine]] in Australia, which despite being largely a copper mine, contains the largest known reserve of uranium ore.]]

In 1987, the [[World Commission on Environment and Development]] (WCED) an organization set up by but independent from the [[United Nations]] classified fission reactors that produce more [[fissile]] nuclear fuel than they consume -i.e. [[breeder reactor]]s, and when it is developed, [[fusion power]], among conventional renewable energy sources, such as [[Sun|solar]] and [[Hydropower|falling water]].&lt;ref name="Brundtland"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 7: Energy: Choices for Environment and Development|url=http://www.un-documents.net/ocf-07.htm|work=Our Common Future: Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development|first=Gro Harlem|last=Brundtland|location=Oslo|date=20 March 1987|accessdate=27 March 2013|quote=Today's primary sources of energy are mainly non-renewable: natural gas, oil, coal, peat, and conventional nuclear power. There are also renewable sources, including wood, plants, dung, falling water, geothermal sources, solar, tidal, wind, and wave energy, as well as human and animal muscle-power. Nuclear reactors that produce their own fuel ("breeders") and eventually fusion reactors are also in this category}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Petroleum Institute]] likewise does not consider conventional nuclear fission as renewable, but that [[breeder reactor]] nuclear power fuel is considered renewable and sustainable, before explaining that radioactive waste from used [[spent fuel]] rods remains radioactive, and so has to be very carefully stored for up to a thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.api.org/classroom/curricula/nonrenew-resources.cfm|title=Key Characteristics of Nonrenewable Resources|author=American Petroleum Institute|accessdate=2010-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the careful monitoring of radioactive waste products also being required upon the use of other renewable energy sources, such as [[geothermal energy]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/radiation/tenorm/geothermal.html Geothermal Energy Production Waste.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of [[nuclear technology]] relying on [[Nuclear fission|fission]] requires [[Naturally occurring radioactive material]] as fuel. [[Uranium]], the most common fission fuel, and is present in the ground at relatively low concentrations and [[uranium mining|mined]] in 19 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf23.html|title=World Uranium Mining|publisher=World Nuclear Association|accessdate=2011-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mined uranium is used to fuel energy-generating nuclear reactors with [[Fissile|fissionable]] [[uranium-235]] which generates heat that is ultimately used to power [[turbine]]s to generate electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/education/uran.html|title=What is uranium? How does it work?|publisher=World Nuclear Association|accessdate=2011-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2013 only a few kilograms (picture available) of uranium have been extracted from the ocean in [[pilot program]]s and it is also believed that the uranium extracted on an industrial scale from the seawater would constantly be replenished from uranium [[leaching (metallurgy)|leached]] from the ocean floor, maintaining the seawater concentration at a stable level.&lt;ref name="gepr.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gepr.org/en/contents/20130729-01/ |title= The current state of promising research into extraction of uranium from seawater — Utilization of Japan's plentiful seas}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, with the advances made in the efficiency of seawater uranium extraction, a paper in the journal of ''Marine Science &amp; Engineering'' suggests that with, light water reactors as its target, the process would be [[economy of scale|economically competitive if implemented on a large scale]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mdpi.com/2077-1312/2/1/81 Development of a Kelp-Type Structure Module in a Coastal Ocean Model to Assess the Hydrodynamic Impact of Seawater Uranium Extraction Technology.

Nuclear power provides about 6% of the world's energy and 13–14% of the world's electricity.&lt;ref&gt;[[World Nuclear Association]]. [http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/newsarticle.aspx?id=27665 Another drop in nuclear generation] ''World Nuclear News'', 5 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nuclear energy production is associated with potentially dangerous [[radioactive contamination]] as it relies upon unstable elements.  In particular, nuclear power facilities produce about 200,000 metric tons of [[low and intermediate level waste]] (LILW) and 10,000 metric tons of [[high level waste]] (HLW) (including spent fuel designated as waste) each year worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Factsheets/English/manradwa.html |title=Factsheets &amp; FAQs |publisher=International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) |accessdate=2012-02-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125062648/http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Factsheets/English/manradwa.html |archivedate=25 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Issues entirely separate from the question of the sustainability of nuclear fuel, relate to the use of nuclear fuel and the high-level radioactive waste the nuclear industry generates that if not properly contained, is [[Acute radiation syndrome|highly hazardous]] to people and wildlife.   The United Nations ([[United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation|UNSCEAR]]) estimated in 2008 that average annual human radiation exposure includes 0.01 [[millisievert]] (mSv) from the legacy of past atmospheric nuclear testing plus the [[Chernobyl disaster]] and the nuclear fuel cycle, along with 2.0 mSv from natural radioisotopes and 0.4 mSv from [[cosmic ray]]s; all exposures [[Background radiation|vary by location]].&lt;ref name = UNSCEAR&gt;United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation.

[[Natural resource]]s, known as renewable resources, are replaced by [[Natural phenomenon|natural processes and forces]] persistent in the [[natural environment]]. There are [[Intermittent energy source|intermittent]] and reoccurring renewables, and [[Recycling|recyclable material]]s, which are utilized during a [[Biogeochemical cycle|cycle]] across a certain amount of time, and can be harnessed for any number of cycles.

The production of goods and services by [[manufacturing]] [[Product (business)|product]]s in [[economic system]]s creates many [[List of waste types|types of waste]] during production and after the [[consumer]] has made use of it. The material is then either [[Incineration|incinerated]], buried in a [[landfill]] or [[recycled]] for reuse.  Recycling turns materials of value that would otherwise become waste into valuable resources again.

The natural environment, with [[soil]], [[water]], [[forest]]s, [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s are all renewable resources, as long as they are adequately [[Conservation biology|monitored, protected and conserved]]. [[Sustainable agriculture]] is the cultivation of plant and animal materials in a manner that preserves plant and animal [[ecosystem]]s over the long term. The [[overfishing]] of the oceans is one example of where an industry practice or method can threaten an ecosystem, endanger [[endangered species|species]] and possibly even determine whether or not a [[fishery]] is sustainable for use by humans. An unregulated industry practice or method can lead to a complete [[resource depletion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing In Small-Scale Marine and Inland Capture Fisharies|url=http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/005/Y3274E/y3274e09.htm|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization|accessdate=2012-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Ohotnikovo1.jpg|thumb|[[Okhotnykovo Solar Park]] is one of the world's [[List of photovoltaic power stations|largest photovoltaic power stations]].]] --&gt;

The renewable energy from the [[sun]], [[wind]], [[surface wave|wave]], [[biomass]] and [[Geothermal gradient|geothermal]] energies are based on renewable resources. Renewable resources such as the movement of [[water]] ([[hydropower]], [[tidal power]] and [[wave power]]), [[wind power|wind]] and [[radiant energy]] from geothermal heat (used for [[geothermal power]]) and solar energy (used for [[Solar energy|solar power]]) are practically infinite and cannot be depleted, unlike their non-renewable counterparts, which are likely to run out if not used sparingly.

The potential wave energy on coastlines can provide 1/5 of world demand. Hydroelectric power can supply 1/3 of our total energy global needs. Geothermal energy can provide 1.5 more times the energy we need. There is enough wind to power the planet 30 times over, wind power could power all of humanity's needs alone. Solar currently supplies only 0.1% of our world energy needs, but there is enough out there to power humanity's needs 4,000 times over, the entire global projected energy demand by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;R. Eisenberg and D. Nocera, "Preface: Overview of the Forum on Solar and Renewable Energy," Inorg. Chem. 44, 6799 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. V. Kamat, "Meeting the Clean Energy Demand: Nanostructure Architectures for Solar Energy Conversion," J. Phys. Chem. C 111, 2834 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

Renewable energy and [[Energy conservation|energy efficiency]] are no longer niche [[Economic sector|sector]]s that are promoted only by governments and environmentalists. The increasing levels of investment and that more of the capital is from conventional financial actors, both suggest that sustainable energy has become mainstream and the future of energy production, as non-renewable resources decline. This is reinforced by [[climate change]] concerns, nuclear dangers and accumulating radioactive waste, [[2000s energy crisis|high oil prices]], [[peak oil]] and increasing government support for renewable energy. These factors are [[renewable energy commercialization|commercializing renewable energy]], enlarging the market and growing demand, the adoption of new products to replace obsolete technology and the conversion of existing infrastructure to a renewable standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://energy-base.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/SEFI-Global-Trends-in-Sustainable-Energy-Investment-2007.pdf |title=Global Trends in Sustainable Energy Investment 2007: Analysis of Trends and Issues in the Financing of Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency in OECD and Developing Countries (PDF), p. 3. |publisher=United Nations Environment Programme |accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic models==
In economics, a non-renewable resource is defined as [[Good (economics)|goods]], where greater consumption today implies less consumption tomorrow.&lt;ref&gt;Cremer and Salehi-Isfahani 1991:18&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Ricardo]] in his early works analysed the pricing of exhaustible resources, where he argued that the price of a mineral resource should increase over time. He argued that the spot price is always determined by the mine with the highest cost of extraction, and mine owners with lower extraction costs benefit from a differential rent. The first model is defined by [[Hotelling's rule]], which is a 1931 economic model of non-renewable [[resource management]] by [[Harold Hotelling]]. It shows that efficient exploitation of a nonrenewable and nonaugmentable resource would, under otherwise stable conditions, lead to a [[resource depletion|depletion]] of the resource. The rule states that this would lead to a net price or "[[Hotelling rent]]" for it that rose annually at a rate equal to the [[rate of interest]], reflecting the increasing scarcity of the resources.
The [[Hartwick's rule]] provides an important result about the [[sustainability]] of welfare in an economy that uses non-renewable source.

'''Nucleomorphs''' are small, vestigial eukaryotic nuclei found between the inner and outer pairs of membranes in certain [[plastid]]s. They are thought to be vestiges of primitive red and green algal nuclei that were engulfed by a larger eukaryote. Because the nucleomorph lies between two sets of membranes, nucleomorphs support the [[endosymbiotic theory]] and are evidence that the plastids containing them are [[complex plastids]]. Having two sets of membranes indicate that the plastid, a prokaryote, was engulfed by a eukaryote, an alga, which was then engulfed by another eukaryote, the host cell, making the plastid an example of secondary endosymbiosis.&lt;ref name=archibald1&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Archibald | first1 = J.M. | last2 = Lane | first2 = C.E. | year = 2009 | title = Going, Going, Not Quite Gone: Nucleomorphs as a Case Study in Nuclear Genome Reduction | url = http://jhered.oxfordjournals.org/content/100/5/582.full | journal = Journal of Heredity | volume = 100 | issue = 5| pages = 582–90 | doi=10.1093/jhered/esp055}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=reyes&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reyes-Prieto | first1 = Adrian | last2 = Weber | first2 = Andreas P.M. | last3 = Bhattacharya | first3 = Debashish | year = 2007 | title = The Origin and Establishment of the Plastid in Algae and Plants | url = | journal = Annual Review of Genetics | volume = 41 | issue = 1| pages = 147–68 | pmid = 17600460 | doi=10.1146/annurev.genet.41.110306.130134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In both groups of organisms the plastids originate from engulfed [[photoautotroph]]ic [[eukaryote]]s.

Of the two known plastids that contain nucleomorphs, both have four membranes, the nucleomorph residing in the [[periplastidial compartment]], evidence of being engulfed by a eukaryote through [[phagocytosis]].&lt;ref name=archibald1/&gt;

==Nucleomorph genome==
Nucleomorphs represent some of the smallest genomes ever sequenced. After the red or green alga was engulfed by a [[cryptomonad]] or [[chlorarachniophyte]], respectively, its genome was reduced. The nucleomorph genomes of both cryptomonads and chlorarachniophytes converged upon a similar size from larger genomes.  They retained only three chromosomes and many genes were transferred to the nucleus of the host cell, while others were lost entirely.&lt;ref name=archibald1/&gt; Chlorarachniophytes contain a nucleomorph genome that is diploid and cryptomonads contain a nucleomorph genome that is tetraploid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Polyploidy of Endosymbiotically Derived Genomes in Complex Algae|url = http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/6/4/974|journal = Genome Biology and Evolution|date = 2014-04-01|issn = 1759-6653|pmc = 4007541|pmid = 24709562|pages = 974–980|volume = 6|issue = 4|doi = 10.1093/gbe/evu071|first = Yoshihisa|last = Hirakawa|first2 = Ken-Ichiro|last2 = Ishida}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unique combination of host cell and complex plastid results in cells with four genomes: two [[prokaryotic]] genomes ([[mitochondrion]] and [[plastid]] of the red or green alga) and two [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] genomes (nucleus of host cell and nucleomorph).

The model cryptomonad ''Guillardia theta'' became an important focus for scientists studying nucleomorphs. Its complete nucleomorph sequence was published in 2001, coming in at 551 Kbp. The ''G. theta'' sequence gave insight as to what genes were retained in nucleomorphs. Most of the genes that moved to the host cell involved protein synthesis, leaving behind a compact genome with mostly single-copy “housekeeping” genes (affecting transcription, translation, protein folding and degradation and splicing) and no mobile elements. The genome contains 513 genes, 465 of which code for protein. Thirty genes are considered “plastid” genes, coding for plastid proteins.&lt;ref name=archibald1/&gt;&lt;ref name=archibald2&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Archibald | first1 = John M | year = 2007 | title = Nucleomorph Genomes: Structure, Function, Origin and Evolution | doi = 10.1002/bies.20551 | journal = BioEssays | volume = 29 | issue = 4| pages = 392–402 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another organism, the chlorarachniophyte ''Bigelowiella natans'' also has had its genome sequenced, and provides an interesting comparison to ''G. theta''. Whereas the nucleomorph in ''G. theta'' supposedly came from a red algae, ''B. natans'' nucleomorph is likely the vestigal nucleus of a green algae. The ''B. natans'' genome is smaller than that of ''G. theta'', with about 373 Kbp. The ''B. natans'' genome contains 293 genes that code for proteins as compared to the 465 genes in ''G. theta''. ''B. natans'' also only has 17 genes that code for plastid proteins, again fewer than ''G. theta''. Comparisons between the two organisms have shown that ''B. natans'' contains significantly more introns (852) than ''G. theta'' (17). ''B. natans'' also had smaller introns, ranging from 18-21 bp, whereas ''G. theta''’s introns ranged from 42-52 bp.&lt;ref name=archibald1/&gt;

Both the genomes of ''B. natans'' and ''G. theta'' display evidence of genome reduction besides elimination of genes and tiny size, including elevated composition of adenine (A) and thymine (T), and high substitution rates.&lt;ref name=Gilson2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=archibald2/&gt;&lt;ref name=douglas2&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Douglas | first1 = SE | last2 = Zauner | first2 = S | last3 = Fraunholz | first3 = M | last4 = Beaton | first4 = M | last5 = Penny | first5 = S | display-authors = etal   | year = 2001 | title = The highly reduced genome of an enslaved algal nucleus | bibcode = 2001Natur.410.1091D | doi = 10.1038/35074092| journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 410 | issue = | pages = 1091–1096 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Persistence of nucleomorphs==
There are no recorded instances of vestigial nuclei in any other secondary plastid-containing organisms, yet they have been retained independently in the cryptomonads and chlorarachniophytes. Plastid gene transfer happens frequently in many organisms, and it is unusual that these nucleomorphs have not disappeared entirely. One theory as to why these nucleomorphs have not disappeared as they have in other groups is that [[introns]] present in nucleomorphs are not recognized by host [[spliceosomes]] because they are too small and therefore cannot be cut and later incorporated into host DNA.

Nucleomorphs also often code for many of their own critical functions, like transcription and translation.&lt;ref name=curtis&gt;Curtis, Bruce et al. "[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v492/n7427/full/nature11681.html Algal genomes reveal evolutionary mosaicism and the fate of nucleomorphs]." ''Nature'' 492 :59-65&lt;/ref&gt; Some say that as long as there exists a gene in the nucleomorph that codes for proteins necessary for the plastid’s functioning that are not produced by the host cell, the nucleomorph will persist.&lt;ref name=archibald1/&gt;

Lauer]], then a first year postdoc. At the first meeting of the group held at [[Princeton University]] in June 1985, [[Sandra Faber]] was elected the group leader.

==Members==

The original members of the Nuker Team include [[Alan Dressler]] (OCIW), [[Sandra M. Faber|Sandra Faber]] (UCO/Lick; First PI), [[John Kormendy]] (Texas), [[Tod R. Lauer]] (NOAO), [[Douglas Richstone]] (Michigan; Present PI),  and [[Scott Tremaine]] (IAS).  Later additions to the team include [[Ralf Bender]] (Munchen), [[Alexei Filippenko|Alexei V. Filippenko]] (Berkeley), [[Karl Gebhardt (astronomer)|Karl Gebhardt]] (Texas), [[Richard Green (astronomer)|Richard Green]] (LBTO), [[Kayhan Gultekin]] (Michigan), [[Luis C. Ho]] (OCIW), [[John Magorrian]] (Oxford), [[Jason Pinkney]] (Ohio Northern), and [[Christos Siopis]] (Michigan).&lt;ref name=Lauer /&gt;

==Etymology==

The name "Nuker" began as an informal internal reference by members of the team to each other, because they came together to study the nuclei of galaxies using the space telescope.&lt;ref&gt;Stern, S. Alan, ''Our Universe:  The Thrill of Extragalactic Exploration As Told by Leading Experts'', Cambridge University Press, 2001 {{ISBN|0-521-78330-5}} and {{ISBN|0-521-78907-9}}.  At page 80.&lt;/ref&gt;  The first use of the name was in a 1989 email from [[Sandra M. Faber|Faber]], who addressed her five colleagues as "Dear Nukers".&lt;ref&gt;Email from Faber to team members, sent Jule 13, 1989, which begins, "Dear Nukers:  We got some time on our ST proposal for nuclei . . . ."&lt;/ref&gt;  As the team began to publish its research, the name came into general use in the scientific community.&lt;ref&gt;Alan, ''supra'', at page 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Nuker" is also used in reference to the "[[Nuker law|Nuker Law]]", which is a description of the inner few (~3-10) arcseconds of predominantly nearby (&lt; 30 Mpc) early-type galaxy light-profiles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1995AJ%2E%2E%2E%2E110%2E2622L The Centers of Early-Type Galaxies with HST.I.An Observational Survey]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Nuker Law was described first by members of the Nuker Team, from which it gets its name.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''philosophy of social science''' is the study of the logic, methods, and foundations of social sciences such as psychology, economics, and political science. Philosophers of social science are concerned with the differences and similarities between the social and the [[natural science]]s, causal relationships between social phenomena, the possible existence of social laws, and the [[ontology|ontological]] significance of [[structure and agency]].

== Auguste Comte and positivism ==
{{Main|Auguste Comte|Positivism}}
Comte first described the epistemological perspective of positivism in ''[[The Course in Positive Philosophy]]'', a series of texts published between 1830 and 1842. These texts were followed by the 1848 work, ''[[A General View of Positivism]]'' (published in English in 1865). The first three volumes of the ''Course'' dealt chiefly with the physical sciences already in existence ([[mathematics]], [[astronomy]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]]), whereas the latter two emphasised the inevitable coming of [[social science]]. Observing the circular dependence of theory and observation in science, and classifying the sciences in this way, Comte may be regarded as the first [[philosopher of science]] in the modern sense of the term.&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/comte/ Stanford Encyclopaedia: Auguste Comte&lt;/ref&gt; For him, the physical sciences had necessarily to arrive first, before humanity could adequately channel its efforts into the most challenging and complex "Queen science" of human society itself. His ''View of Positivism'' would therefore set-out to define, in more detail, the empirical goals of sociological method.

Comte offered an [[social evolutionism|account of social evolution]], proposing that society undergoes three phases in its quest for the truth according to a general 'law of three stages'. The idea bears some similarity to [[Karl Marx|Marx's]] view that human society would progress toward a [[communist]] peak. This is perhaps unsurprising as both were profoundly influenced by the early [[Utopian socialist]], [[Henri de Saint-Simon]], who was at one time Comte's teacher and mentor. Both Comte and Marx intended to develop, scientifically, a new secular ideology in the wake of European [[secularisation]].

The early sociology of [[Herbert Spencer]] came about broadly as a reaction to Comte.  Writing after various developments in evolutionary biology, Spencer attempted (in vain) to reformulate the discipline in what we might now describe as [[social Darwinism|socially Darwinistic]] terms (although Spencer was a proponent of [[Lamarckism]] rather than Darwinism).

The modern academic discipline of sociology began with the work of Émile Durkheim (1858–1917). While Durkheim rejected much of the detail of Comte's philosophy, he retained and refined its method, maintaining that the social sciences are a logical continuation of the natural ones into the realm of human activity, and insisting that they may retain the same objectivity, rationalism, and approach to causality.&lt;ref name="Wacquant"&gt;Wacquant, Loic.  1992.  "Positivism." In Bottomore, Tom and William Outhwaite, ed., ''The Blackwell Dictionary of Twentieth-Century Social Thought''&lt;/ref&gt; Durkheim set up the first European department of sociology at the [[University of Bordeaux]] in 1895.  In the same year he argued, in ''[[The Rules of Sociological Method]]'' (1895):&lt;ref name="autogenerated2000"&gt;Gianfranco Poggi (2000). ''Durkheim.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; "[o]ur main goal is to extend scientific rationalism to human conduct... What has been called our positivism is but a consequence of this rationalism."&lt;ref name="DinW"&gt;Durkheim, Emile. 1895.  ''The Rules of Sociological Method''.  Cited in Wacquant (1992).&lt;/ref&gt; Durkheim's seminal monograph ''[[Suicide (book)|Suicide]]'' (1897), a case study of suicide rates amongst [[Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] populations, distinguished sociological analysis from [[psychology]] or philosophy.

The positivist perspective, however, has been associated with '[[scientism]]'; the view that the methods of the natural sciences may be [[absolute (philosophy)|applied to all]] areas of investigation, be it philosophical, social scientific, or otherwise. Among most social scientists and historians, orthodox positivism has long since fallen out of favor. Today, practitioners of both social and physical sciences recognize the distorting effect of [[observer bias]] and structural limitations. This scepticism has been facilitated by a general weakening of deductivist accounts of science by philosophers such as Thomas Kuhn, and new philosophical movements such as [[critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|critical realism]] and [[neopragmatism]]. Positivism has also been espoused by '[[Technocracy|technocrats]]' who believe in the inevitability of [[social progress]] through science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;Schunk, ''Learning Theories: An Educational Perspective, 5th'', 315&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher-sociologist [[Jürgen Habermas]] has critiqued pure [[instrumental rationality]] as meaning that scientific-thinking becomes something akin to [[ideology]] itself.&lt;ref&gt;Outhwaite, William, 1988 ''Habermas: Key Contemporary Thinkers'', Polity Press (Second Edition 2009), {{ISBN|978-0-7456-4328-1}} p.68&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Durkheim]], [[Marx]], and [[Max Weber|Weber]] are more typically cited as the fathers of contemporary social science. In [[psychology]], a positivistic approach has historically been favoured in [[behaviourism]].

==Epistemology==
In any discipline, there will always be a number of underlying philosophical predispositions in the projects of scientists. Some of these predispositions involve the nature of social knowledge itself, the nature of social reality, and the locus of human control in action.&lt;ref&gt;Cote, James E. and Levine, Charles G. (2002). ''Identity formation, Agency, and Culture'', Mahwah, New Jersey: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; Intellectuals have disagreed about the extent to which the social sciences should mimic the methods used in the natural sciences. The founding [[positivism|positivists]] of the social sciences argued that social phenomena can and should be studied through conventional [[scientific methods]]. This position is closely allied with [[scientism]], [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] and [[physicalism]]; the doctrine that all phenomena are ultimately reducible to physical entities and physical laws. Opponents of naturalism, including advocates of the ''[[verstehen]]'' method, contended that there is a need for an interpretive approach to the study of human action, a technique radically different from natural science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy|editor=Robert Audi|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|year=1999|edition=Second|pages=704|isbn=0-521-63722-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fundamental task for the philosophy of social science has thus been to question the extent to which [[positivism]] may be characterized as 'scientific' in relation to fundamental [[epistemological]] foundations. These debates also rage ''within'' contemporary social sciences with regard to [[subjectivity]], [[objectivity (science)|objectivity]], [[intersubjectivity]] and practicality in the conduct of theory and research. Philosophers of social science examine further epistemologies and methodologies, including [[Philosophical realism|realism]], [[critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|critical realism]], [[instrumentalism]], [[structural functionalism|functionalism]], [[structuralism]], [[Antipositivism|interpretivism]], [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], and [[post-structuralism]].

Though essentially all major social scientists since the late 19th century have accepted that the discipline faces challenges that are different from those of the [[natural science]]s, the ability to determine [[causality|causal relationships]] invokes the same discussions held in science [[meta-theory]]. Positivism has sometimes met with caricature as a breed of naive empiricism, yet the word has a rich history of applications stretching from [[Auguste Comte|Comte]] to the work of the [[Vienna Circle]] and beyond. By the same token, if positivism is able to identify causality, then it is open to the same [[critical rationalism|critical rationalist]] non-[[justificationism]] presented by [[Karl Popper]], which may itself be disputed through [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s conception of epistemic [[paradigm shift]].

Early German hermeneuticians such as [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] pioneered the distinction between natural and social science ('[[Geisteswissenschaft]]'). This tradition greatly informed [[Max Weber]] and [[Georg Simmel]]'s [[antipositivism]], and continued with [[critical theory]].&lt;ref name="Outhwaite, William 2009 p.22"&gt;Outhwaite, William, 1988 ''Habermas: Key Contemporary Thinkers'', Polity Press (Second Edition 2009), {{ISBN|978-0-7456-4328-1}} p.22&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1960s, a general weakening of deductivist accounts of science has grown side-by-side with critiques of "[[scientism]]", or 'science ''as ideology'''.&lt;ref&gt;Outhwaite, William, 1988 ''Habermas: Key Contemporary Thinkers'', Polity Press (Second Edition 2009), {{ISBN|978-0-7456-4328-1}} p.19&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jürgen Habermas]] argues, in his ''On the Logic of the Social Sciences'' (1967), that "the positivist thesis of unified science, which assimilates all the sciences to a natural-scientific model, fails because of the intimate relationship between the social sciences and history, and the fact that they are based on a situation-specific understanding of meaning that can be explicated only hermeneutically … access to a symbolically prestructured reality cannot be gained by observation alone." &lt;ref name="Outhwaite, William 2009 p.22"/&gt; ''Verstehende'' social theory has been the concern of phenomenological works, such as [[Alfred Schütz]] ''Phenomenology of the Social World'' (1932) and [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]]'s ''[[Truth and Method]]'' (1960).&lt;ref&gt;Outhwaite, William, 1988 ''Habermas: Key Contemporary Thinkers'', Polity Press (Second Edition 2009), {{ISBN|978-0-7456-4328-1}} p.23&lt;/ref&gt; Phenomenology would later prove influential in the subject-centred theory of the [[post-structuralists]].

The mid-20th-century [[linguistic turn]] led to a rise in highly philosophical sociology, as well as so-called "[[Postmodernism|postmodern]]" perspectives on the social acquisition of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Giddens, A |title=Sociology |publisher=Polity |location=Oxford, UK |pages=714|year=2006|isbn= 0-7456-3379-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; One notable critique of social science is found in [[Peter Winch]]'s Wittgensteinian text ''The Idea of Social Science and its Relation to Philosophy'' (1958). [[Michel Foucault]] provides a potent critique in his [[The Order of Things|archaeology of the human sciences]], though Habermas and [[Richard Rorty]] have both argued that Foucault merely replaces one such system of thought with another.&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Habermas. ''Taking Aim at the Heart of the Present'' in Hoy, D (eds) 'Foucault: A critical reader' Basil Blackwell. Oxford, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Rorty. ''Foucault and Epistemology'' in Hoy, D (eds) 'Foucault: A critical reader' Basil Blackwell. Oxford, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

One underlying problem for the [[social psychology|social psychologist]] is whether studies can or should ultimately be understood in terms of the meaning and consciousness behind social action, as with [[folk psychology]], or whether more objective, natural, materialist, and behavioral facts are [[Eliminative materialism|to be given exclusive study]]. This problem is especially important for those within the social sciences who study qualitative mental phenomena, such as [[consciousness]], associative meanings, and [[mental representation]]s, because a rejection of the study of meanings would lead to the reclassification of such research as non-scientific. Influential traditions like psychodynamic theory and symbolic interactionism may be the first victims of such a paradigm shift. The philosophical issues lying in wait behind these different positions have led to commitments to certain kinds of methodology which have sometimes bordered on the partisan. Still, many researchers have indicated a lack of patience for overly dogmatic proponents of one method or another.&lt;ref&gt;Slife, B.D. and Gantt, E.E. (1999) Methodological pluralism: a framework for psychotherapy research. Journal of Clinical Psychology, 55(12), pp1453–1465.&lt;/ref&gt;

Social research remains extremely common and effective ''in practise'' with respect to political institutions and businesses. [[Michael Burawoy]] has marked the difference between [[public sociology]], which is focused firmly on practical applications (though see e.g. Thibodeaux, 2016&lt;ref&gt;Thibodeaux, Jarrett. 2016. Production as Social Change: Policy Sociology as a Public Good. ''Sociological Spectrum''. 36 (3): 183-190&lt;/ref&gt;), and ''academic'' or ''professional'' sociology, which involves dialogue amongst other social scientists and philosophers.

==Ontology==
[[Structure and agency]] forms an enduring debate in social theory: "Do social structures determine an individual's behaviour or does human agency?" In this context '[[agency (sociology)|agency]]' refers to the capacity of individuals to act independently and make free choices, whereas '[[social structure|structure]]' refers to factors which limit or affect the choices and actions of individuals (such as social class, religion, gender, ethnicity, and so on). Discussions over the primacy of structure or agency relate to the very core of social ontology ("What is the social world made of?", "What is a cause in the social world, and what is an effect?"). One attempt to reconcile postmodern critiques with the overarching project of social science has been the development, particularly in Britain, of [[critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|critical realism]]. For critical realists such as [[Roy Bhaskar]], traditional positivism commits an 'epistemic fallacy' by failing to address the ontological conditions which make science possible: that is, structure and agency itself.

The '''Qatar Computing Research Institute''' (QCRI) in [[Doha]], [[Qatar]], is a nonprofit multidisciplinary computing research institute founded by the [[Qatar Foundation]] (QF) for Education, Science and Community Development in 2010. It is primarily funded by the Qatar Foundation, a private, non-profit organization that is supporting Qatar on its journey from carbon economy to [[knowledge economy]]. 

==Background==
QCRI is one of the three national research institutes under Qatar Foundation and specializes in applied computing research. Its research fall into two main categories: core computing and multidisciplinary computing. Within core computing, QCRI specializes in internet computing (with an emphasis on cloud computing and social networking), data analysis, and advanced computer hardware design. Within multidisciplinary computing, QCRI is focused on Arabic language technologies, high performance computing, and bioinformatics.

QCRI has offices in the [[Hamad Bin Khalifa University|HBKU]] Research Complex, in [[Doha]]'s [[Education City]].  QCRI has a staff of 90+ employees.

==Origins==
QCRI grew out of a series of meetings held by the Qatari Arab Joint Committee (QAJC) analyzing the needs of Qatar.&lt;ref&gt;"Qatar Computing Research Institute looks to 'shake computer science'". Business Intelligence Middle East. 18 August 2010. http://www.bi-me.com/main.php?c=3&amp;cg=3&amp;t=1&amp;id=47875 Retrieved 8 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The group found that Qatar Foundation funded basic computing research at academic institutions worldwide through [[Qatar National Research Fund]] (QNRF) and that it incubated the development of new commercial computing products through Qatar Science and Technology Park (QSTP), but it lacked a research organization focused on computing grand challenges that address national priorities for growth and development.

QCRI was established in 2010 with a mandate to tackle large-scale computing challenges relevant to the needs of Qatari stakeholders.  The stakeholders include Qatari industry, Qatar’s government, and Qatari society.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;"Main Customers and Stakeholders". Qatar Computing Research Institute. 1 March 2011. https://www.qcri.org/about-qcri{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Retrieved 8 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, QCRI’s customers include the petroleum industry, the telecommunications industry, the healthcare industry, and the media industry. The petroleum industry needs advanced computer modeling to assist in the extraction and movement of petroleum products. The telecommunications and datacenter industries need the most advanced research in computing networks, broadband, and other forms of advanced computing infrastructure. The healthcare industry needs efficient and secure management of electronic patient records, clinical information systems, and data interoperability protocols for the exchange and sharing of data. The media industry needs solutions for the cataloging and retrieval of vast amounts of content generated through audio and video, and it needs Arabic language technology solutions to digitize and publish the vast Arabic language corpora.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt; QCRI also works closely with both the basic research institutes in Qatar, including the [[Education City]] Universities on their most promising basic research findings. It also will work closely with [[QSTP]] to identify the most viable commercial applications of QCRI’s research.

==Activities==
{{refimprove|section|date=December 2015}}
Research topics investigated by the QCRI include Arabic language computer technologies, [[computer security]] and [[data analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eecs.umich.edu/eecs/about/articles/2014/QCRI_connection.html|title=Karem Sakallah Continues Commitment to Qatar Computing Research Institute|publisher=Computer Science and Engineering School, University of Michigan|date=3 February 2014|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arabic Language Technology Ecosystem Grand Challenge is to have an Arabic Language Technology research community in the Arab world of 100 specialized researchers, research engineers, and developers. The Arabic Machine Translation Grand Challenge hopes to realize machine translation for translating text or speech for 20 languages to and from Arabic. The Arabic Intelligent Support System Grand Challenge is a campaign to provide seamless multimodal Arabic content access and processing in 25% of newly authored software that handle Arabic in the Middle East. The Arabic Automated Language Tutor Grand Challenge assists in Arabic language learning for 1 million students via an interactive Arabic language tutor that teaches literacy, phonics, and grammar. The Seamless Arabic Dialogue System Grand Challenge is to transform 50% of automated commercial customer facing in Qatar to Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems. The Arabic Content and Search Grand Challenge will try to make Arabic a tier 1 language on the web and in the enterprise in terms content, search, and services.

== Sponsors and partners ==
QCRI's principal sponsor is the Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development. QCRI conducts research and development in collaboration with various organizations, including [[Qatari Diar]], [[Aljazeera| Aljazeera Network]], Microsoft Research, and Yahoo! QCRI also collaborates with other computing research institutes, including [[MIT]], [[Columbia University]], [[University of Waterloo]], and [[Purdue University]].

In [[computer science]], the '''readers-writers problems''' are examples of a common computing problem in [[concurrency (computer science)|concurrency]]. There are at least three variations of the problems, which deal with situations in which many [[thread (computer science)|thread]]s try to access the same shared resource at one time. Some threads may read and some may write, with the constraint that no process may access the shared resource for either reading or writing while another process is in the act of writing to it. (In particular, it ''is'' allowed for two or more readers to access the share at the same time.) A [[readers-writer lock]] is a [[data structure]] that solves one or more of the readers-writers problems.

The basic reader-writers problem was first formulated and solved by Courtois ''et al.''{{r|courtois}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Synchronization Algorithms and Concurrent Programming |first=Gadi |last=Taubenfeld |publisher=Pearson Education |year=2006 |page=301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For ex: Suppose in a class there is one board,where only one person can write at a time, but at the same time many readers can read the board

==First readers-writers problem==
Suppose we have a shared memory area with the basic constraints detailed above. It is possible to protect the shared data behind a mutual exclusion [[mutex]], in which case no two threads can access the data at the same time. However, this solution is suboptimal, because it is possible that a reader ''R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' might have the lock, and then another reader ''R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' requests access. It would be foolish for ''R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' to wait until ''R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' was done before starting its own read operation; instead, ''R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' should be allowed to read the resource alongside ''R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' because reads don't modify data, so concurrent reads are safe. This is the motivation for the '''first readers-writers problem''', in which the constraint is added that ''no reader shall be kept waiting if the share is currently opened for reading.''  This is also called '''readers-preference''', with its solution:
&lt;source lang="C"&gt;
semaphore resource=1;
semaphore rmutex=1;
readcount=0;

/*
   resource.P() is equivalent to wait(resource)
   resource.V() is equivalent to signal(resource)
   rmutex.P() is equivalent to wait(rmutex)
   rmutex.V() is equivalent to signal(rmutex)
*/

writer() {
    resource.P();          //Lock the shared file for a writer

    &lt;CRITICAL Section&gt;
    // Writing is done

    &lt;EXIT Section&gt;
    resource.V();          //Release the shared file for use by other readers. Writers are allowed if there are no readers requesting it.
}

reader() {
    rmutex.P();           //Ensure that no other reader can execute the &lt;Entry&gt; section while you are in it
    &lt;CRITICAL Section&gt;
    readcount++;          //Indicate that you are a reader trying to enter the Critical Section
    if (readcount == 1)   //Checks if you are the first reader trying to enter CS
        resource.P();     //If you are the first reader, lock the resource from writers. Resource stays reserved for subsequent readers
    &lt;EXIT CRITICAL Section&gt;
    rmutex.V();           //Release

    // Do the Reading

    rmutex.P();           //Ensure that no other reader can execute the &lt;Exit&gt; section while you are in it
    &lt;CRITICAL Section&gt;
    readcount--;          //Indicate that you are no longer needing the shared resource. One fewer reader
    if (readcount == 0)   //Checks if you are the last (only) reader who is reading the shared file
        resource.V();     //If you are last reader, then you can unlock the resource. This makes it available to writers.
    &lt;EXIT CRITICAL Section&gt;
    rmutex.V();           //Release
}
&lt;/source&gt;

In this solution of the readers/writers problem, the first reader must lock the resource (shared file) if such is available. Once the file is locked from writers, it may be used by many subsequent readers without having them to re-lock it again.

Before entering the [[critical section]], every new reader must go through the entry section. However, there may only be a single reader in the entry section at a time. This is done to avoid race conditions on the readers (e.g. two readers increment the readcount at the same time, and both try to lock the resource, causing one reader to block). To accomplish this, every reader which enters the &lt;ENTRY Section&gt; will lock the &lt;ENTRY Section&gt; for themselves until they are done with it. At this point the readers are not locking the resource. They are only locking the entry section so no other reader can enter it while they are in it. Once the reader is done executing the entry section, it will unlock it by signalling the mutex. Signalling it is equivalent to: mutex.V() in the above code. Same  is valid for the &lt;EXIT Section&gt;. There can be no more than a single reader in the exit section at a time, therefore, every reader must claim and lock the Exit section for themselves before using it.

Once the first reader is in the entry section, it will lock the resource. Doing this will prevent any writers from accessing it. Subsequent readers can just utilize the locked (from writers) resource. The very last reader (indicated by the readcount variable) must unlock the resource, thus making it available to writers.

In this solution, every writer must claim the resource individually. This means that a stream of readers can subsequently lock all potential writers out and starve them. This is so, because after the first reader locks the resource, no writer can lock it, before it gets released. And it will only be released by the very last reader. Hence, this solution does not satisfy fairness.

==Second readers-writers problem==
The first solution is suboptimal, because it is possible that a reader ''R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' might have the lock, a writer ''W'' be waiting for the lock, and then a reader ''R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' requests access. It would be unfair for ''R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' to jump in immediately, ahead of ''W''; if that happened often enough, ''W'' would [[resource starvation|starve]]. Instead, ''W'' should start as soon as possible. This is the motivation for the '''second readers-writers problem''', in which the constraint is added that ''no writer, once added to the queue, shall be kept waiting longer than absolutely necessary''. This is also called '''writers-preference'''.

A solution to the writers-preference scenario is:&lt;ref name="courtois"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Communications of the ACM |title=Concurrent Control with "Readers" and "Writers" |first1=P. J. |last1=Courtois |first2=F. |last2=Heymans |first3=D. L. |last3=Parnas |year=1971 |url=http://cs.nyu.edu/~lerner/spring10/MCP-S10-Read04-ReadersWriters.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang="C"&gt;
int readcount, writecount;                   //(initial value = 0)
semaphore rmutex, wmutex, readTry, resource; //(initial value = 1)

//READER
reader() {
&lt;ENTRY Section&gt;
  readTry.P();                 //Indicate a reader is trying to enter
  rmutex.P();                  //lock entry section to avoid race condition with other readers
  readcount++;                 //report yourself as a reader
  if (readcount == 1)          //checks if you are first reader
    resource.P();              //if you are first reader, lock  the resource
  rmutex.V();                  //release entry section for other readers
  readTry.V();                 //indicate you are done trying to access the resource

&lt;CRITICAL Section&gt;
//reading is performed

&lt;EXIT Section&gt;
  rmutex.P();                  //reserve exit section - avoids race condition with readers
  readcount--;                 //indicate you're leaving
  if (readcount == 0)          //checks if you are last reader leaving
    resource.V();              //if last, you must release the locked resource
  rmutex.V();                  //release exit section for other readers
}

//WRITER
writer() {
&lt;ENTRY Section&gt;
  wmutex.P();                  //reserve entry section for writers - avoids race conditions
  writecount++;                //report yourself as a writer entering
  if (writecount == 1)         //checks if you're first writer
    readTry.P();               //if you're first, then you must lock the readers out. Prevent them from trying to enter CS
  wmutex.V();                  //release entry section

&lt;CRITICAL Section&gt;
  resource.P();                //reserve the resource for yourself - prevents other writers from simultaneously editing the shared resource
  //writing is performed
  resource.V();                //release file

&lt;EXIT Section&gt;
  wmutex.P();                  //reserve exit section
  writecount--;                //indicate you're leaving
  if (writecount == 0)         //checks if you're the last writer
    readTry.V();               //if you're last writer, you must unlock the readers. Allows them to try enter CS for reading
  wmutex.V();                  //release exit section
}
&lt;/source&gt;

In this solution, preference is given to the writers. This is accomplished by forcing every reader to lock and release the readtry semaphore individually. The writers on the other hand don't need to lock it individually. Only the first writer will lock the readtry and then all subsequent writers can simply use the resource as it gets freed by the previous writer. The very last writer must release the readtry semaphore, thus opening the gate for readers to try reading.

No reader can engage in the entry section if the readtry semaphore has been set by a writer previously. The reader must wait for the last writer to unlock the resource and readtry semaphores. On the other hand, if a particular reader has locked the readtry semaphore, this will indicate to any potential concurrent writer that there is a reader in the entry section. So the writer will wait for the reader to release the readtry and then the writer will immediately lock it for itself and all subsequent writers. However, the writer will not be able to access the resource until the current reader has released the resource, which only occurs after the reader is finished with the resource in the critical section.

The resource semaphore can be locked by both the writer and  the reader in their entry section. They are only able to do so after first locking the readtry semaphore, which can only be done by one of them at a time.

If there are no writers wishing to get to the resource, as indicated to the reader by the status of the readtry semaphore, then the readers will not lock the resource. This is done to allow a writer to immediately take control over the resource as soon as the current reader is finished reading. Otherwise, the writer would need to wait for a queue of readers to be done before the last one can unlock the readtry semaphore. As soon as a writer shows up, it will try to set the readtry and hang up there waiting for the current reader to release the readtry. It will then take control over the resource as soon as the current reader is done reading and lock all future readers out. All subsequent readers will hang up at the readtry semaphore waiting for the writers to be finished with the resource and to open the gate by releasing readtry.

The rmutex and wmutex are used in exactly the same way as in the first solution. Their sole purpose is to avoid race conditions on the readers and writers while they are in their entry or exit sections.

==Third readers-writers problem==
In fact, the solutions implied by both problem statements can result in starvation &amp;mdash; the first one may starve writers in the queue, and the second one may starve readers. Therefore, the '''third readers-writers problem''' is sometimes proposed, which adds the constraint that ''no thread shall be allowed to starve''; that is, the operation of obtaining a lock on the shared data will always terminate in a bounded amount of time.
A solution with fairness for both readers and writers might be as follows:

&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
int readCount;                  // init to 0; number of readers currently accessing resource

// all semaphores initialised to 1
Semaphore resourceAccess;       // controls access (read/write) to the resource
Semaphore readCountAccess;      // for syncing changes to shared variable readCount
Semaphore serviceQueue;         // FAIRNESS: preserves ordering of requests (signaling must be FIFO)

void writer()
{
    serviceQueue.P();           // wait in line to be serviced
    // &lt;ENTER&gt;
    resourceAccess.P();         // request exclusive access to resource
    // &lt;/ENTER&gt;
    serviceQueue.V();           // let next in line be serviced
    
    // &lt;WRITE&gt;
    writeResource();            // writing is performed
    // &lt;/WRITE&gt;
    
    // &lt;EXIT&gt;
    resourceAccess.V();         // release resource access for next reader/writer
    // &lt;/EXIT&gt;
}

void reader()
{
    serviceQueue.P();           // wait in line to be serviced
    readCountAccess.P();        // request exclusive access to readCount
    // &lt;ENTER&gt;
    if (readCount == 0)         // if there are no readers already reading:
        resourceAccess.P();     // request resource access for readers (writers blocked)
    readCount++;                // update count of active readers
    // &lt;/ENTER&gt;
    serviceQueue.V();           // let next in line be serviced
    readCountAccess.V();        // release access to readCount
    
    // &lt;READ&gt;
    readResource();             // reading is performed
    // &lt;/READ&gt;
    
    readCountAccess.P();        // request exclusive access to readCount
    // &lt;EXIT&gt;
    readCount--;                // update count of active readers
    if (readCount == 0)         // if there are no readers left:
        resourceAccess.V();     // release resource access for all
    // &lt;/EXIT&gt;
    readCountAccess.V();        // release access to readCount
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Note also that this solution can only satisfy the condition that "no thread shall be allowed to starve" if and only if semaphores preserve first-in first-out ordering when blocking and releasing threads. Otherwise, a blocked writer, for example, may remain blocked indefinitely with a cycle of other writers decrementing the semaphore before it can.

=== Simplest Reader Writer Problem ===

The simplest reader writer problem which uses only two semaphores and doesn't need an array of readers to read the data in buffer.

Please notice that this solution gets simpler than the general case because it is made equivalent to the [[Producer–consumer problem|Bounded buffer]] problem, and therefore only N readers are allowed to enter in parallel, N being the size of the buffer.

==== Reader ====

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
do {
	wait(read)
	............
	reading data
	............
	signal(write)
} while(TRUE);
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Writer ====

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
do {
	wait(write)
	.............
	writing data
	.............
	signal(read)
} while(TRUE);
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Algorithm ====

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
1. Reader will run after Writer because of read semaphore.
2. Writer will stop writing when the write semaphore has reached 0.
3. Reader will stop reading when the read semaphore has reached 0.

'''RefME''' was a free [[Reference management software|citation management tool]] available on web, [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]]. It offered a functionality that allowed users to scan book and journal [[barcode]]s with a [[mobile device]] and generate citations automatically.&lt;ref&gt;BBC Click{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b06bbm1g/click-05092015|title=BBC Click 5th September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was compatible with other citation management tools such as [[Mendeley]], [[Zotero]], [[RefWorks]], and [[EndNote]] and enables exporting in over 7000 citation styles.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jenniferhicks/2015/04/12/uk-edtech-company-to-simplify-academic-referencing/|title=GUK EdTech Company To Simplify Academic Referencing}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2015, the company released a Chrome plug-in&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Aaron|title=Exam Revision, Dissertations and Deadlines – FIVE of the BEST apps for students|url=http://www.express.co.uk/life-style/science-technology/576634/Productivity-Apps-iPhone-Mac-App-Store-Windows-5-Students-Revision|date=May 12, 2015|publisher=Sunday Express|accessdate=7 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to allow for direct clipping of web sources, which was followed in August 2015 by a similar iOS extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McClellan|first1=Craig|title=RefMe Adds iOS Share Extension|url=http://www.theclassnerd.com/blog/2015/8/25/refme-adds-ios-share-extension|website=The Class Nerd|accessdate=7 February 2016|date=August 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; RefME was shut down on March 7, 2017, after being acquired by the education company [[Chegg, Inc.]].

==History==
RefME was founded 2014 by Tom Hatton,&lt;ref&gt;Startups.co.uk{{cite web|url=http://startups.co.uk/the-highs-and-lows-of-life-as-a-young-entrepreneur/|title=The Highs and Lows of Life as a Young Entrepreneur}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ian Forshew, and Tom Gardiner&lt;ref&gt;The Huffington Post{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/12/18/young-entrepreneur-week-meet-creators-referencing-tool-refme_n_6346784.html|title=Young Entrepreneur Of The Week: Meet The Creators Of The Student Referencing Tool RefME}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was based in London and had over a million registered users. In April 2015, it was announced that [[GEMS Education]] had invested $5 million (£2.7) in the company’s seed investment round.&lt;ref&gt;TechCrunch{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/04/08/refme-seed/|title=Edtech Tool RefME Bags $5M To Take The Tedium Out Of Referencing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Independent{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/student/refme-citation-app-given-27-million-backing-from-gems-education-10173303.html |title=RefME citation app given £2.7 million backing from GEMs Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, RefMe was acquired by [[Chegg, Inc.]] and RefMe user accounts were transferred over to CiteThisForMe, Chegg's own citation service.

==Features==
RefME was a free service that required registration to use. Registration could be performed by [[email]], [[Facebook]] single sign on, or via [[Edmodo]]. It was available on Desktop ([[Windows]], [[macOS]] and [[Linux]]) via the RefME.com web platform, [[iOS]] (for [[iPhones]] and [[iPads]]), [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[Google Chrome]] via the RefME WebClipper browser extension. &lt;ref&gt;The Next Web{{cite web|url= https://thenextweb.com/events/2015/09/10/10-boost-startups-from-the-uk-that-you-should-know-about/
|title= 10 Boost startups from the UK that you should know about}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RefME allowed sharing and collaborating on resources, adding information through both desktop and mobile devices with cloud synchronization between platforms. The tool also allowed for citations to be exported into other tools&lt;ref&gt;FreePint{{cite web|url=http://web.freepint.com/go/sub/report/2554|title=FreePint Report: Product Review of RefME}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as batch-importing using.Ris files.&lt;ref&gt;RefME Blog{{cite web|url=https://www.refme.com/blog/2015/10/30/importing-references-directly-to-refme/|title=Importing References Directly to RefME}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The mobile apps also offered a feature that allowed users to scan books with their smartphones and turn them automatically into citations.&lt;ref&gt;Nature{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/news/eight-ways-to-clean-a-digital-library-1.18695|title=Eight ways to clean a digital library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6306">In astronomy, '''rotational Brownian motion''' is the [[random walk]] in orientation of a [[binary star]]'s orbital plane, induced by gravitational perturbations from passing stars.

==Theory==

Consider a binary that consists of two massive objects (stars, black holes etc.) and that is embedded in a [[stellar system]] containing a large number of stars.  Let &lt;math&gt;M_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M_2&lt;/math&gt; be the masses of the two components of the binary whose total mass is &lt;math&gt;M_{12}=M_1+M_2&lt;/math&gt;.  A field star that approaches the binary with [[impact parameter]] &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and velocity &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; passes a distance &lt;math&gt;r_p&lt;/math&gt; from the binary, where

&lt;math&gt;
p^2=r_p^2\left(1+2GM_{12}/V^2r_p\right) \approx 2GM_{12}r_p/V^2;
&lt;/math&gt;

the latter expression is valid in the limit that [[gravitational focusing]] dominates the encounter rate.  The rate of encounters with stars that interact strongly with the binary, i.e. that satisfy &lt;math&gt;r_p &lt; a&lt;/math&gt;, is approximately &lt;math&gt;n\pi p^2 \sigma =2\pi GM_{12} n a/\sigma &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; are the number density and velocity dispersion of the field stars and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the [[semi-major axis]] of the binary.

As it passes near the binary, the field star experiences a change in velocity of order 

&lt;math&gt;
\Delta V \approx V_{\rm bin} = \sqrt{GM_{12}/a}
&lt;/math&gt;, 

where &lt;math&gt;V_{\rm bin}&lt;/math&gt; is the relative velocity of the two stars in the binary.
The change in the field star's [[specific angular momentum]] with respect to the binary, &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;, is then Δ''l'' ≈ ''a'' ''V''&lt;sub&gt;bin&lt;/sub&gt;.  Conservation of angular momentum implies that the binary's angular momentum changes by Δ''l''&lt;sub&gt;bin&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ -(m/μ&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;)Δ''l'' where ''m'' is the mass of a field star and μ&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; is the binary [[reduced mass]]. Changes in the magnitude of ''l''&lt;sub&gt;bin&lt;/sub&gt; correspond to changes in the binary's orbital eccentricity via the relation ''e'' = 1 - ''l''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/''GM''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;μ&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;''a''.  Changes in the direction of ''l''&lt;sub&gt;bin&lt;/sub&gt; correspond to changes in the orientation of the binary, leading to rotational diffusion. The rotational diffusion coefficient is

&lt;math&gt;
\langle\Delta\xi^2\rangle = \langle\Delta l_{\rm bin}^2\rangle / l_{\rm bin}^2 
\approx \left({m\over M_{12}}\right)^2 \langle\Delta l^2\rangle/GM_{12}a \approx {m\over M_{12}} {G\rho a\over\sigma}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ρ = ''mn'' is the mass density of field stars.

Let ''F''(θ,''t'') be the probability that the rotation axis of the binary is oriented at angle θ at time ''t''.  The evolution equation for ''F'' is &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | author=Debye, P.
 | authorlink = Peter Debye
 | title=Polar Molecules
 | publisher=Dover
 | year=1929}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;

{\partial F\over\partial t} = {1\over\sin\theta} {\partial\over\partial\theta} \left(\sin\theta{\langle\Delta\xi^2\rangle\over 4} {\partial F\over\partial\theta}\right).  

&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;Δξ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&gt;, ''a'', ρ and σ are constant in time, this becomes

&lt;math&gt;

{\partial F\over\partial\tau} = {1\over 2} {\partial\over\partial\mu} \left[(1-\mu^2) {\partial F\over\partial\mu}\right]  

&lt;/math&gt;

where μ = cos θ and τ is the time in units of the relaxation time ''t''&lt;sub&gt;rel&lt;/sub&gt;, where

&lt;math&gt;
t_{\rm rel} \approx {M_{12}\over m} {\sigma\over G\rho a}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The solution to this equation states that the expectation value of μ decays with time as

&lt;math&gt;
\overline\mu = \overline{\mu}_0 e^{-\tau}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, ''t''&lt;sub&gt;rel&lt;/sub&gt; is the time constant for the binary's orientation to be randomized by torques from field stars.

==Applications==

Rotational Brownian motion was first discussed in the context of binary [[supermassive black hole]]s at the centers of galaxies.&lt;ref name=DM&gt;[[David Merritt|Merritt, D.]] (2002), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002ApJ...568..998M  Rotational Brownian Motion of a Massive Binary], ''The Astrophysical Journal'', '''568''', 998-1003.&lt;/ref&gt;  Perturbations from passing stars can alter the orbital plane of such a binary, which in turn alters the direction of the spin axis of the single black hole that forms when the two coalesce.

Rotational Brownian motion is often observed in [[N-body simulation]]s of [[galaxies]] containing binary black holes.&lt;ref&gt;Löckmann, U. and Baumgardt, H. (2008), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008MNRAS.384..323L  Tracing intermediate-mass black holes in the Galactic Centre], ''[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]'', '''384''', 323-330.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;	
Matsubayashi, T., Makino, J. and Ebisuzaki, T. (2007), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007ApJ...656..879M|Orbital Evolution of an IMBH in the Galactic Nucleus with a Massive Central Black Hole], ''The Astrophysical Journal'', '''656''', 879-896&lt;/ref&gt;  The massive binary sinks to the center of the galaxy via [[dynamical friction]] where it interacts with passing stars. The same gravitational perturbations that induce a random walk in the orientation of the binary, also cause the binary to shrink, via the [[gravitational slingshot]].  It can be shown&lt;ref name=DM/&gt;  that the rms change in the binary's orientation, from the time the binary forms until the two black holes collide, is roughly

&lt;math&gt;
\delta\theta\approx \sqrt{20m/M_{12}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

In a real galaxy, the two black holes would eventually coalesce due to emission of [[gravitational wave]]s.  The spin axis of the coalesced hole will be aligned with the angular momentum axis of the orbit of the pre-existing binary. Hence, a mechanism like rotational Brownian motion that affects the orbits of binary black holes can also affect the distribution of black hole spins.  This may explain in part why the spin axes of supermassive black holes appear to be randomly aligned with respect to their host galaxies.&lt;ref&gt;Kinney, A. et al. (2000), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000ApJ...537..152K  Jet Directions in Seyfert Galaxies], ''The Astrophysical Journal'', '''537''', 152-177&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Set-point control.png|thumb|300px|Block diagram of a [[Negative feedback|negative feedback system]] used to maintain a setpoint in the face of a disturbance using error-controlled regulation. Positive error means feedback is too small (controller calls for an increase), and negative error means feedback is too large (controller calls for a decrease).]]
In [[cybernetics]] and [[control theory]], a '''setpoint''' (also '''set point''' or '''set-point''') is the desired or target value for an essential variable, or process value of a system.&lt;ref name=Achterbergh/&gt; Departure of such a variable from its setpoint is one basis for error-controlled regulation using negative [[feedback]] for automatic control. &lt;ref name=Ashby/&gt;.  The set point is usually abbreviated to SP, and the process value is usually abbreviated to PV.&lt;ref name= Bequette/&gt;

==Examples==

'''Cruise control'''

The SP-PV error can be used to return a system to its norm. An everyday example is the [[cruise control]] on a road vehicle; where external influences such as gradients cause speed changes (PV), and the driver also alters the desired set speed (SP). The automatic control algorithm restores the actual speed to the desired speed in the optimum way, without delay or overshoot, by altering the power output of the vehicle's engine.  In this way the SP-PV error is used to control the PV so that it equals the SP. A widespread use of SP-PV error control is the [[PID controller]].

'''Industrial applications'''

Special consideration must be given for engineering applications. In industrial systems, physical or process restraints may limit the determined set point. For example, a reactor which operates more efficiently at higher temperatures may be rated to withstand 500°C. However, for safety reasons, the set point for the reactor temperature control loop would be well below this limit, even if this means the reactor is running less efficiently.

'''Sir [[Peter Blake (sailor)|Peter Blake]] Marine Education &amp; Recreation Centre''' (MERC) is a not for profit charity (Registration Number CC29903) based in [[Long Bay, New Zealand|Long Bay]], [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]]. MERC offers marine-based [[environmental education]] and outdoor recreational experiences to schools, not-for-profit organisations, and business and corporate groups. 

MERC can accommodate up to 85 people at any time for overnight stays and activities, and up to a total of 120 people per day. A day programme consists of 3 activities on the day and instruction is given between 9am and 4pm. There is scope to organise short duration, single day and multi-day courses, and these are specifically developed to meet the needs of each group. MERCs facilities have separate teacher/leader accommodation, multi-purpose hall, wheelchair access and large kitchen &amp; dining facilities.

The Centre's mission statement is ''to provide life-changing marine environmental education and outdoor experiences for young New Zealanders.''

==History==
The Centre has been in operation since 1990. A group of local yachtsmen and teachers (Don St.Clair Brown, Don Burfoot, Laurie Baxter, Ian Sage, Dr. Ross Garrett and John Orams, responded to the vision of fellow yachtsman Dr. David Gray, that a centre be built on the present site which was designated “Conditional Use Reserve” land belonging to Takapuna City Council. In 1980 this site was littered with building debris, scraps of machinery and foundations of early buildings. These basic amenities had serviced the large Long Bay camping population as well as local holiday residents in their numerous beaches. There was a store with petrol pumps – started by Tom Vaughan about 1920 but taken over by Mr and Mrs Aston and demolished about 1950 (?), a butchery owned by Mr Lopes which later became a private beach, a holiday house built above the sea wall (1956) still tenanted in 1989.

In [[astronomy]], a '''syzygy''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɪ|z|ᵻ|dʒ|i}}; from the [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang-grc|σύζυγος|suzugos|yoked together|label=none}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of syzygy |website = Collins English Dictionary |url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/syzygy |accessdate=22 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a (roughly) straight-line configuration of three or more [[celestial bodies]] in a gravitational system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Overview ==
The word is often used in reference to the [[Sun]], [[Earth]], and either the [[Moon]] or a [[planet]], where the latter is in [[astronomical conjunction|conjunction]] or [[astronomical opposition|opposition]]. [[solar eclipse|Solar]] and [[lunar eclipse|lunar]] [[eclipse]]s occur at times of syzygy, as do [[Astronomical transit|transits]] and [[occultation]]s. The term is
often applied when the Sun and Moon are in conjunction ([[new moon]]) or opposition ([[full moon]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Coyle |first=Harold P. |title=Syzygy |url=http://accessscience.com/content/Syzygy/757218 |work=AccessScience |publisher=©McGraw-Hill Companies |year=2008 |accessdate=May 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''syzygy'' is often used to describe interesting configurations of astronomical objects in general. For example, one such case occurred on March 21, 1894, around 23:00 [[GMT]], when [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] transited the Sun as would have been seen from Venus, and Mercury and [[Venus]] both simultaneously transited the Sun as seen from [[Saturn]]. It is also used to describe situations when all the planets are on the same side of the Sun although they are ''not necessarily in a straight line'', such as on March 10, 1982.&lt;ref name="nyt-1982"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/14/weekinreview/ideas-trends-in-summary-it-s-all-right-to-come-out-now.html |title=Ideas &amp; Trends in Summary; It's All Right To Come Out Now |work=New York Times| date=March 14, 1982 |accessdate=May 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 3, 2014, the [[Curiosity (rover)|''Curiosity'' rover]] on Mars observed the planet [[transit of Mercury from Mars|Mercury transiting the Sun]], marking the first time a [[planetary transit]] has been observed from a celestial body besides [[Earth]].&lt;ref name="NASA-20140610" /&gt;

== Occultations, transits, and eclipses ==

Syzygy sometimes results in an [[occultation]], transit, or [[eclipse]].

* An [[occultation]] occurs when an apparently larger body passes in front of an apparently smaller one. 
* A [[transit (astronomy)|transit]] occurs when a smaller body passes in front of a larger one.
** In the combined case where the smaller body regularly transits the larger, an occultation is also termed a secondary eclipse.
* An [[eclipse]] occurs when a body totally or partially disappears from view, either by an occultation, as with a [[solar eclipse]], or by passing into the shadow of another body, as with a [[lunar eclipse]] (thus both are listed on [http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse.html NASA's eclipse page]).

Transits and occultations of the Sun by Earth's Moon are called [[solar eclipse]]s regardless of whether the Sun is completely or partially covered. By extension, transits of the Sun by a [[satellite]] of a planet may also be called eclipses, as with the transits of Phobos and Deimos shown on [http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/target/phobos NASA's JPL photojournal], as may the passage of a satellite into the planet's shadow, as with this [http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA03612 eclipse of Phobos]. The term ''eclipse'' is also used more generally for bodies passing in front of one another. For example, [http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap070316.html a NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day] refers to the Moon eclipsing and occulting Saturn interchangeably.

== Einstein ring ==

As electromagnetic rays are somewhat bent by gravitation, when they pass by a heavy mass they are bent. One says the mass acts as a gravitational lens. If the light source, the diffracting mass and the observer stand in a line, one sees an [[Einstein ring]].

== Tidal variation ==

{{further|Tidal range}}

Syzygy causes the bimonthly phenomena of [[spring tide|spring]] and [[neap tide|neap]] tides. At the new and full moon, the Sun and Moon are in syzygy. Their [[tidal force]]s act to reinforce each other, and the ocean both rises higher and falls lower than the average. Conversely, at the first and third quarter, the Sun and Moon are at right angles, their tidal forces counteract each other, and the tidal range is smaller than average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tides: The Sun and Moon Affect the Oceans |author=Matt Rosenberg |url=http://geography.about.com/od/physicalgeography/a/tides.htm |accessdate=May 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tidal variation can also be measured in the [[earth tide|earth's crust]], and this [[tidal triggering of earthquakes|may affect the frequency of earthquakes]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3487">'''Tacpac''' (Touch and Communication Pac) is a sensory communication resource using touch and music to align the [[sense]]s and develop [[communication skills]]. It helps those who have any kind of [[Sensory processing disorder|sensory impairment]] or communication difficulties. It can also help those who have [[tactile defensiveness]], profound and multiple [[Learning impairment|learning difficulties]], [[autism]], [[Down syndrome]], and [[dementia]].

Tacpac uses specially composed music that matches the texture of the object for each activity so that those who are receiving Tacpac have an aligned experience. Over time, users can employ this to help them communicate. 

Tacpac comes in the form of a subscription which is accessed both on the website and also on the app for phones and tablets. The resources include the full music tracks, instruction videos for each activity, and downloadable/printable records that keep sheets and instruction sheets. The app enables users to play full music tracks without an [[internet connection]].

Through repetition of activities in the Tacpac repertoire, a receiver learns to show responses that can be understood: e.g., those manifesting like/dislike; want/rejection; and know/nescient. Users can begin to move in response to [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]], anticipate activities, and relate to the helper. These primal responses that comprise pre-intentional and [[Affect (psychology)|affectiv]]e communication can be crucial steps toward more clearly defined intentional communication and even [[language acquisition]].

As one researcher writes{{ref|pease}}: "One of the most effective ways of establishing contact with [[Deafblindness|deafblind]] children and so encouraging a communicative response is to share activities with a high levels of [[physical contact]] and pleasant sensations. These include [...] Tacpac, a package where taped music is linked to a range of [[tactile sense|tactile sensations]]."

The number of research projects around Tacpac is growing{{ref|panter}}{{ref|serpa}}{{ref|spevi}}. It has found support from the [[Royal National Institute of Blind People]] in the UK, and has growing followers amongst multi-sensory impairment networks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1613">The '''Undervoltage-Lockout''' or '''UVLO''' is an [[electronic circuit]] used to turn off the power of an electronic device in the event of the [[voltage]] dropping below the operational value. For instance, in [[embedded device]]s, UVLOs can be used to monitor the [[battery (electricity)|battery]] charge or turn off the circuit if the battery voltage drops below a specific threshold, thus protecting the associated equipment. Some variants may also have an upper threshold.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}
Undervoltage lockout is an integral part of many electronic devices. For instance, it is widely used in many [[Electrical ballast]] circuits to switch them off in the event of voltage falling below the operational value.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Undervoltage-lockout should be used for [[Switched-mode power supply|switched-mode power supplies]] when the [[output impedance]] of an electrical network is higher than the input impedance of the [[voltage regulator|regulator]] in order to prevent oscillations and possible malfunctions of the regulator.{{clarify|date=September 2017}}&lt;ref name="SOKA73A"&gt; Sokal, N.
