{{Advanced Placement}}

The '''Advanced Placement Psychology''' ('''AP Psychology''', '''AP Psych''', or '''APPSY''') course and corresponding exam are part of [[College Board|College Board's]] [[Advanced Placement Program]]. This  course is tailored for students interested in the field of [[psychology]] and as an opportunity to earn Advanced Placement credit or exemption from a [[college]]-level psychology course.  It was the shortest AP exam until the [[AP Physics C]] exam was split into two separate exams in 2006.

==Topics covered==
The College Board provides a course of study to help educators prepare their students for the AP Psychology exam. The exam covers the following 14 areas. The percentage indicates the portion of the multiple-choice section of the exam focused on each content area:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AP: Psychology|url=http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/psych/topics.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exam==
[[Image:AP Psych Test.JPG|thumb|left|Free response section booklet]]
The exam includes two sections: a 70-minute [[multiple choice]] section (100 questions) and a 50-minute [[free response]] section (2 prompts). The multiple choice provides two-thirds of the grade and the free-response provides the remaining third.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AP: Psychology|url=http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/psych/exam.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with the May 2011 AP Exam administration, total scores on the multiple-choice section are based only on the number of questions answered correctly. Points are no longer deducted for incorrect answers. Grading (the number of points needed to get a certain score) is slightly more strict as a result.

==Grade distribution==

The exam was first held in 1992. Grade distributions for the Psychology exam scores since 2010 were:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19947">An '''Assistant Language Teacher''' ('''ALT''') is a foreign national serving as an [[assistant teacher]] ([[paraprofessional educator]]) in a Japanese classroom, particularly for English.

The term was created by the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology|Japanese Ministry of Education]] at the time of the creation of the [[JET Programme]] as a translation of the term å¤å½èªæå°å©æ (''gaikokugo shidÅ joshu'') or literally "foreign language instruction assistant". The terms '''AET''' (Assistant English Teacher), '''ELT''' (English Language Teacher) and '''NESA''' (Native English Speaking Assistant) are also in use. The term is used by the Ministry of Education, local Boards of Education ('''BOE'''s) and schools in Japan primarily to refer to [[English language]] speakers who assist with [[Teaching English as a foreign language|teaching of English]] in [[primary school|elementary]], [[middle school|junior high]] and [[secondary school|senior high school]]s. However, some ALTs help teach languages other than English.

ALTs are required to be [[university]] graduates, but they are usually not certified teachers like their Japanese colleagues.

==Being an ALT==

===Requirements===

The JET Programme set the general prerequisites imposed by [[Immigration to Japan|Japanese immigration]] ([[bachelor's degree]], [[health]], [[nationality]]) and the characteristics that can be considered to be sought by the [[Government of Japan|Japanese government]], [[board of education|boards of education]] (BOEs), and schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dpi.wi.gov/cal/wlcjflyer.html |title=Teach English in Japan |publisher=Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction |date=December 11, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100207232329/http://dpi.wi.gov/cal/wlcjflyer.html |archivedate=February 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of ALTs from private language teaching companies, further requirements may include items such as [[Teaching English as a foreign language|TEFL]] [[certification]], [[Japanese language]] ability (at least spoken) at a communicative level, teaching experience (both within Japan and in other countries) and other specialized skills ([[foreign language]]s other than English, IT, etc.)  However, as a basic rule, the standards that are expected of JET Programme are still considered as norms among private language teaching companies that provide ALTs to BOEs, although agreements between BOEs and private companies often allow for a relaxing on some of these rules.

===Recruitment===
At one time, the majority of ALTs were recruited through the JET Programme, but now most are hired by private language teaching companies, also known as "dispatch companies", either within Japan or abroad. Once hired, ALTs are sent to work in junior and senior high-schools and, increasingly, in elementary schools throughout Japan. ALTs are either assigned to one main school, or can work at a number of different schools in their area.  ALTs entering on the JET programme are not required to have any prior teaching experience or ESL training. Many ALTs hired privately have prior experience and/or training.

ALTs hired on the JET Programme typically enter either in July or August, but most private ALTs are usually on a contract which runs from April until at least the end of the third school term in March. Some AETs dispatched to City of Nagoya public schools have contracts that begin in mid-May and end in mid-February. Some ALTs also have set, paid holidays during the spring, summer and winter school vacations, in addition to all Japanese public holidays, but some ALTs are not paid between semesters or for national holidays, and do not receive paid vacation leave. By combining the 23 national holidays with the time off during school holidays, the actual number of working days per year is somewhere near 200 through private companies, which is one of the major attractions of the ALT position, however many schools require you to undertake other tasks when not teaching, so the actual hours worked are similar to other jobs in Japan. Most JET Programme ALTs are required to work through the school holidays, receiving the 23 national holidays plus annual leave as holiday time.

===Payment===

The pay for a private ALT is usually less than a full-time [[Eikaiwa]] teacher and far less than a teacher from the [[JET Programme]] (Â¥3.36 to Â¥3.96 million depending on year in the program&lt;ref name="jetsalary"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://jetprogramusa.org/contract-benefits/ |title=Contract Information |year=2016 |website=[[JET Programme|JET Program]] USA |access-date=April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;), with some of the lowest salaries around Â¥180,000 per month (Â¥2.16 million annually)
The Interac company ALTs/ dispatch staff make approximately Â¥3600 (US $32) per hour, BUT, the ALT receives approximately half of that amount Â¥1800( US$16 ) per hour before tax. Interac deducts approximately half of the monthly earnings with its justification being that it trains ALTs and incurs other administrative costs.In reality most Interac ALT's receive 5days of actual training before being dispatched to teach at schools. It is therefore a lucrative business for such companies, minimal initial investment, but constant monthly cashflow from the 3000+ active ALTs at Interac in Japan alone.If requested to attend 3 monthly briefing meetings,  the pay is Â¥900 per hour( US $7.00).In Japan almost every business which employs a person for 30 hours(or more ), has to pay for the employees monthly health insurance.  Interac dodges having to pay health insurance for workers claiming to the government that its employees work only 29.5 hours per week instead of 30 hours. But in REALITY, employees are actually stuck at a school site or at a desk for 40hours(or more) per week {cn|date=October 16th 2018}}. Benefits and workload also vary.Elementary school ALTs are the most exhausted because they require extra 'Genki' energy to engage students and recently focus has changed with new MEXT ideologies as of March 2018 .  JHS and Highschool are less energy consuming but focus more on grammar and practical use of  English . Some companies pay their ALTs between semesters and some do not. Some provide benefits, such as access to employer subsidized health insurance, paid holidays, paid vacation/sick leave and unemployment insurance, and some do not.

===Job duties===
An ALT's primary duty is to assist Japanese teachers of English to deliver lessons in the classroom, and may be involved in lesson planning and other language teaching tasks.Regarding Elemenary school,  the term ALT is often misleading, in many instances the ALT will solely be responsible for total lesson planning( for the academic year and delivering the lessons). This is mostly the case with Elementary schools outside of the Kanto region. During such lessons, Japanese teachers often act as a support teacher or translator.In those instances the term "Assistant" Language Teacher becomes unsuitable, as the ALT is not "assisting" but actually "leading and facilitating" the entire english class.   However in Junior Highschool and Highschool, the degree to which the Japanese teacher of English actually uses the ALT is usually decided at the discretion of the Japanese teacher. Some allow ALTs to plan and lead language activities in class, sometimes for the entire class period, while others make minimal use of their ALT, such as limiting them to reading new vocabulary words for the students to repeat and having the ALT walk between the rows of students while the students do writing assignments. An ALT also contributes information to teaching advisors on phraseology and pronunciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Positions|url=https://jetprogramusa.org/positions/|website=JET Program USA|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ALTs usually take part in three to five classes per day. The classes are usually 45â50 minutes in length. An ALT participates in about 17 to 20 classes per week. Sometimes ALTs are asked to help teach special education classes, which may include students who have barriers to learning. They may also be asked to take part in after/before school club activities (''bukatsudÅ''), such as sports, calligraphy, music or ikebana, to learn more about the culture alongside their students and to foster international exchange. However, some ALTs choose not to participate, or go from group to group just to visit. The English level of the students varies from school to school, and at some schools the students and teachers are unable to communicate in English in any meaningful way. Higher level high schools sometimes have an English club, which the ALT would attend and assist in the students' planning and preparations for debate contests, speech competitions and English camps.

ALTs may also be asked to perform tasks normally done by Japanese students and teachers, such as cleaning the school, cleaning drainage gutters, and removing snow from parking areas. ALTs at some schools, mostly junior high schools, are expected to eat lunch with the students. These ALTs might not be allowed to leave the school for lunch or to run personal errands during their break. ALTs may be instructed to use non-standard English in front of students.  They are sometimes asked to perform clerical tasks, such as correcting student writing assignments, by the Japanese teachers.

ALTs may be required to read aloud stories about [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombings]] and the lingering deaths of Japanese children to their classes, which omit any mention of [[World War II]] or the Japanese government's [[Japanese war crimes|conduct during the war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[New Horizon (textbook)|New Horizon]] 3|chapter=A Mother's Lullaby|page=36|publisher=Tokyo Shoseki}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://akitajet.com/wiki/A_Mother's_Lullaby| title=A Mother's Lullaby| publisher=Akita JET| accessdate=January 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview of the private ALT system in Japan==
In 1999, Dispatch Law (å´åèæ´¾é£) was deregulated to allow dispatch companies to enter into other fields of work aside from the traditional industry of manufacturing, including education. Since then more and more local boards of education have turned to private language companies to provide ALTs rather than using the JET Programme.

The business of private language teaching companies providing ALTs is increasing and some with hundreds of ALTs are covering all parts of the country.  There is the impression that the private sector in general continues to grow as The JET Programme loses share in the market. Private dispatch companies vary from large corporations to local firms.

===Differences between JET Programme ALTs and private company ALTs===

*'''Application:''' The JET Programme may be very competitive based on the hiring nation (the US, UK, Canada, Australia being examples) or very lax depending on the needs of the Programme for any fiscal year. Private ALT application processes vary, but tend to be highly competitive for smaller companies and very open with larger companies.
*'''Compensation:''' As of 2016, JET Programme ALTs are compensated between Â¥3.36 and Â¥3.96 million annually depending on their year in the program&lt;ref name="jetsalary" /&gt;. JET Programme participants will on average receive a higher initial monthly salary than ALTs from most private companies. However, some private companies require ALTs with TEFL certification who may be compensated at a higher level. This is rare, however, with some dispatched ALTs earning as little as Â¥2.2 million per annum{{cn|date=April 2018}}.
*'''Support:''' The JET Programme has a nationwide support system for ALTs that tends to vary in utility based on the nature of each case. Private language companies that provide ALTs to BOEs vary in their approaches to supporting ALTs, ranging from a very hands-off approach to an experience more professionally invigorating than the JET Programme. Private ALTs tend to be more experienced and better trained to start, many being ex-JETs. Teacher support and professional development vary with company.
*'''Workload:''' The JET Programme typically follows the request of the BOE regarding the workload of each ALT. A frequent issue with JET Programme ALTs is being required to report to a town office or education center when school is not in session, often when they have no other work to do. In general, ALTs provided by private language teaching companies do not require ALTs to report to the local BOE on days when school is not in session, although they may be required to attend training or asked to take other work during working time. Typically workload and salary are related, in that lower pay is accompanied by fewer required working days or hours.
*'''External Work:''' JET Programme ALTs are generally prohibited from working outside the school. Private companies have differing policies that may or may not allow legal work on the side, however, most tend to either provide supplementary work at their own clients, or allow ALTs to seek extra work if they so choose.
*'''Contractual Term Limits''': JET Programme ALTs have a limited number of years to be contracted (to a maximum of 3 or 5 years, with contract renewals happening yearly), while private companies have no such restriction in most cases.

The above list is by no means comprehensive, and some other categories that vary from situation to situation may include: the ability to transfer (both locationally and between positions), evaluation, reward systems, and professional development opportunities.

==Union Activity and ALTs==

===Education law===

Some of the contracts that school boards have signed with private language teaching companies are illegal ''gyomu itaku'' (service contracts). According to the Japanese Ministry of Education, these contracts violate Japan's General Education Law since the principal must be in charge of all staff at their school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alt.150m.com/ |title=Gyomu Itaku Contracts are Illegal |date=February 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707055156/http://alt.150m.com/ |archivedate=2011-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with these contracts, the company is actually in charge - not the principal.

The licensed Japanese teacher is normally in charge of junior high school and high school classes regardless of where the ALT originates; however in the case of elementary school classes, the ALT is normally responsible for the entire class, with the Japanese teacher either providing limited input or in some cases not being present in the classroom, and for that reason the continuity of school management is sometimes maintained with the school principal in compliance with any legal requirements, as the product being contracted itself is an abstract, education, and the contract basis for private language teaching corporations is to provide education and educational services.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

===29.5 hours per week===

It is common for ALTs to be recruited with job contracts with private language companies such as [[W5 (company)|W5]], [[Interac (Japan)|Interac]], [[Borderlink]] and [[WING (company)|WING]] which stipulates ALT working hours as being 29.5 hours per week. In actuality, working hours usually range from 30 to 40 hours due to the fact that transition times between classes and other brief periods of time throughout the working day are scheduled as breaktimes. Employers often have employees sign such contracts in an effort to avoid paying into the employer based Social Insurance program, or [[Social welfare in Japan|Shakai hoken]]. While Social Insurance law states that all regular employees should be enrolled by their employer in Shakai Hoken, companies consistently tell their employees that they are ineligible. Their reasoning is that the 29.5 hours a week working time written into the contracts fall below an erroneous minimum of 3/4 full-time necessary for eligibility. The Social Insurance Agency uses the 3/4 of the hours of a similar full-time as a guideline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/rss/nn20080105f1.html|author=Kanako Takahara|title=Assistant language teachers in trying times|publisher=The Japan Times Online|date=January 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the Japanese government has recent stated that there is, in fact, no minimum legal work time requirement for enrollment in Shakai Hoken. Furthermore, no company would ever be prohibited from enrolling their employees in the Social Insurance program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://interacunion.org/to-interac-info-on-health-insurance/|title=To Interac: Info on Health Insurance|publisher=Nambu Foreign Workers Caucus|date=November 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some AETs dispatched to the City of [[Nagoya]] have a 35-hour work week and are not enrolled in Shakai Hoken, receive no paid sick leave, no paid holidays, no paid vacation leave, and are not enrolled in unemployment insurance. They are only paid for days worked and receive no pay between semesters except for a few training sessions.

===Kanagawa Board of Education===

In 2006, ALTs in [[Kanagawa Prefecture]] who were previously hired directly as part-time workers rejected the privatization of their jobs to [[Interac (Japan)|Interac]], a nationwide language services dispatch company, and took the Kanagawa Prefecture Board of Education to the Labour Relations Board where the case is still on-going.

As in many cases, the likely cause of the dissolution of the direct-hire situation draws back to Prime Minister [[Junichiro Koizumi]] who took a hard-line stance on privatization (e.g. Japan Post) and the idea of allowing local governments more flexibility in deciding how to spend their budgets.

===Other local Boards of Education===

The General Workers Union has been involved with several boards of education in the Kanto area including the Tokyo Board of Education, the Koga Board of Education (in [[Ibaraki Prefecture]]) and the Fukaya Board of Education (in [[Saitama Prefecture]]). In the case versus the Tokyo Board of Education, the General Workers Union won a decision stating that the directly hired ALTs were indeed legally classified as "workers" (''rodosha'') and not simply contractors. Further victories were achieved through the private companies that had contracts with the Koga and Fukaya boards of education.

'''Barry Dean Kernfeld''' (born 11 August 1950, [[San Francisco]]), is a [[musicologist]] and jazz saxophonist who has researched and published extensively about the history of jazz and the biographies of its musicians.&lt;ref&gt;''Contemporary Authors, New Revision Series'', Vol. 135, [[Thomson Gale]] [[Detroit]] (2005) {{OCLC|6921683}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Contemporary Authors'', Vol. 161, [[Gale Research]], [[Detroit]] (1998) {{OCLC|6921683}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Writers Directory,'' [[St. James Press]], [[Detroit]] {{OCLC|1776757}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''International Who's Who in Music and Musicians' Directory; 12th edition, 1990â1991,'' [[International Who's Who in Music]], [[Cambridge, England]] (1990) {{OCLC|632053332}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who in America, 60th edition, 2006,'' [[Marquis Who's Who]], [[New Providence, NJ]] (2005) {{OCLC|62401678}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Editing and writing career ==
Kernfeld was the editor of the first and second editions of ''The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz,'' the largest jazz dictionary ever published. The first edition was published in 1988. ''Volume 1'' had 670 pages and ''Volume 2'' had 690.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Holden]], [https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/23/arts/the-pop-life-205788.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm "The Pop Life: Jazz Facts and Figures",] ''[[New York Times]]'', November 23, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John S. Wilson (music critic)|John S. Wilson]], [https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/30/books/books-of-the-times-updating-the-minutiae-of-a-truly-american-sound.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm "Books of The Times; Updating the Minutiae of a Truly American Sound",] ''New York Times'', December 30, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Kernfeld initiated a long-term project, transcribing and editing the contents of the [http://www.smithsonianjazz.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=22&amp;Itemid=28 Smithsonian Jazz Oral History Program]. A number of lengthy interviews are now available at the institution's website. Also in 2005, Kernfeld became a staff archivist in the [https://archive.is/20121211071535/http://www.libraries.psu.edu/psul/speccolls/hcla.html Historical Collections and Labor Archives within Special Collections] at the [[Pennsylvania State University]] library. In 2012, he taught a writing course at [[Penn State]], "American Jazz Masters in their Own Words."

Kernfeld spent a decade researching pop [[Copyright infringement|song piracy]] which culminated him publishing two books, one about [[fake books]] (2006) and the other a general survey (2011). (see book listings below)

Worchester, MA: Clark University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Watson studied child development, looking specifically at development through conditioning (see [[Little Albert experiment]]). He helped bring a natural science perspective to child psychology by introducing objective research methods based on observable and measurable behavior. [[B.F. Skinner]] then further extended this model to cover [[operant conditioning]] and [[verbal behavior]]. Skinner was then able to focus these research methods on feelings and how those emotions can be shaped by a subjectâs interaction with the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. (1974).

==History==
In 1948, [[Sidney Bijou]] took a   position as associate professor of psychology at the University of Washington and served as director of the universityâs Institute of Child Development. Under his leadership, the Institute added a child development clinic, nursery school classrooms, and a research lab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morris|first=Edward K.|title=Sidney W.

==Research methods==

The methods used to analyze behavior in [[child development]] are based on several types of measurements. [[Single-subject research]] with a [[longitudinal study]] follow-up is a commonly-used approach. Current research is focused on integrating [[single-subject design]]s through meta-analysis to determine the effect sizes of behavioral factors in development. Lag sequential analysis has become popular for tracking the stream of behavior during observations. Group designs are increasingly being used. Model construction research involves [[latent growth modeling]] to determine developmental trajectories and [[structural equation modeling]]. [[Rasch model|Rasch analysis]] is now widely used to show sequentiality within a developmental trajectory.

A recent methodological change in the behavioral analytic theory is the use of observational methods combined with lag sequential analysis can determine [[reinforcement]] in the natural setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Snyder |first=J.J. |last2=Patterson |first2=G.R. |year=1986 |title=The effects of consequences on patterns of social interaction: A quasi-experimental approach to [[reinforcement]] in the natural environment |journal=Child Development |volume=57 |issue=5 |pages=1257â1268 |pmid=3769609 |doi=10.2307/1130448 |jstor=1130448}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quantitative behavioral development===

The [[model of hierarchical complexity]] is a quantitative analytic theory of development. This model offers an explanation for why certain tasks are acquired earlier than others through developmental sequences and gives an explanation of the biological, cultural, organizational, and individual principles of performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Commons|first=M.L.|title=Formal, systematic, and metasystematic operations with a balance-beam task series: A reply to Kallio's claim of no distinct systematic stage|journal=Adult Development|year=1995|volume=2|issue=3|pages=193â199|doi=10.1007/bf02265717|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; It quantifies the order of hierarchical complexity of a task based on explicit and mathematical measurements of behavior.

===Contingencies, uncertainty, and attachment===
The behavioral model of [[Attachment theory|attachment]] recognizes the role of uncertainty in an infant and the childâs limited communication abilities. Contingent relationships are instrumental in the behavior analytic theory, because much emphasis is put on those actions that produce parentsâ responses.&lt;ref name="Cavell02"&gt;Cavell, T.A. &amp; Strand, P.S. (2002). Parent-Based interventions for aggressive, antisocial children: Adapting to a bilateral lens. In L. Kuczynski (Ed.) ''Handbook of dynamics in parent-child relations''. (pp. 395â419). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gewirtz, J.L. 1991 pp. 123"&gt;Gewirtz, J.L. &amp; PelÃ¡ez-Nogueras, M. (1991).

Thoman (Ed.), Origins of the infant's social responsiveness. In E.B. Thoman (Ed.) ''Origins of the infant's social responsiveness''. (pp. 33â64).

Both infants and adults function in their environments by understanding these contingent relationships. Research has shown that contingent relationships lead to emotionally satisfying relationships.&lt;ref name="Dunst 2007"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dunst |first=C.J. |last2=Raab |first2=M. |last3=Trivette |first3=C.M. |last4=Parkey |first4=C. |last5=Gatens |first5=M. |last6=Wilson |first6=L.L.

Since 1961, behavioral research has shown that there is relationship between the parentsâ responses to separation from the infant and outcomes of a âstranger situation.â.&lt;ref&gt;Gewirtz, J.L.

New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; In a study done in 2000, six  infants participated in a classic reversal design (see [[single-subject research]]) study that assessed infant approach rate to a stranger. If attention was based on stranger avoidance, the infant avoided the stranger. If attention was placed on infant approach, the infant approached the stranger.&lt;ref&gt;Gewirtz, J. &amp; Pelaez-Nogueras, M. (2000).

Recent meta-analytic studies of this model of attachment based on contingency found a moderate effect of contingency on attachment, which increased to a large effect size when the quality of reinforcement was considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Kassow |first=D.Z. |last2=Dunst |first2=C.J. |year=2004 |title=Relationship between parental contingent-responsiveness and attachment outcomes |url=http://www.researchtopractice.info/bridges/bridges_vol2_no4.pdf |journal=Bridges |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=1â17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research on contingency highlights its effect on the development of both pro-social and anti-social behavior.&lt;ref name="Cavell02"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Wahler |first=R.G. |last2=Herring |first2=M. |last3=Edwards |first3=M. |year=2001 |title=[[Coregulation]] of balance between children's prosocial approaches and acts of compliance: A pathway to motherâchild cooperation? |journal=Journal of Clinical Child Psychology |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=473â478 |pmid=11708235 |doi=10.1207/S15374424JCCP3004_04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Wahler |first=R.G. |last2=Bellamy |first2=A. |year=1997 |title=Generating reciprocity with conduct problem children and their mothers: The effectiveness of compliance teaching and responsive parenting |journal=Journal of Social and Personal Relationships (Special issue: Reciprocity and Bidirectionality) |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=549â564 |doi=10.1177/0265407597144009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Wahler |first=R.G. |last2=Smith |first2=G.G. |year=1999 |title=Effective parenting as the integration of lessons and dialogue |journal=Journal of Child and Family Studies |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=135â149 |doi=10.1023/A:1022031716547}}&lt;/ref&gt; These effects can also be furthered by training parents to become more sensitive to childrenâs behaviors,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dunst |first=C.J. |last2=Kassow |first2=D.Z. |year=2004 |title=Characteristics of interventions promoting parental sensitivity to child behavior |journal=Bridges |volume=2 |pages=1â17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meta-analytic research supports the notion that attachment is operant-based learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dunst |first=C.J. |last2=Kassow |first2=D.Z. |year=2008 |title=Caregiver Sensitivity, Contingent Social Responsiveness, and Secure Infant Attachment |journal=Journal of Early and Intensive Behavioral Intervention |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=40â56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An infant's sensitivity to contingencies can be affected by biological factors and environment changes. Studies show that being placed in erratic environments with few contingencies may cause a child to have conduct problems and may lead to depression.

===Motor development===
Since Watson developed the theory of behaviorism, behavior analysts have held that [[motor development]] represents a conditioning process. This holds that crawling, climbing, and walking displayed by infants represents conditioning of biologically innate [[reflexes]]. In this case, the reflex of stepping is the respondent behavior and these reflexes are environmentally conditioned through experience and practice. This position was criticized by maturation theorists. They believed that the stepping reflex for infants actually disappeared over time and was not "continuous". By working with a slightly different theoretical model, while still using operant conditioning, [[Esther Thelen]] was  able to show that children's stepping reflex disappears as a function of increased physical weight. However, when infants were placed in water, that same stepping reflex returned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Savelsbergh |first=G.J.P. |year=2005 |title=Discovery Of Motor Development: A Tribute To Esther Thelen |url= |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=243â249}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Thelen |first=E. |last2=Fisher |first2=D.M. |year= 1982 |title=Newborn stepping: An explanation for a 'disappearing reflex{{'-}} |journal=Developmental Psychology |volume=18 |issue=5 |pages=760â775 |doi=10.1037/0012-1649.18.5.760}}&lt;/ref&gt; This offered a model for the continuity of the stepping reflex and the progressive stimulation model for behavior analysts.

Infants [[relative deprivation|deprived]] of physical [[stimulation]] or the opportunity to respond were found to have delayed motor development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dennis |first=W. |year=1960 |title=Causes of retardation among institutional children: Iran |journal=Journal of Genetic Psychology |volume=96 |pages=47â59 |pmid=13815945 |doi=10.1080/00221325.1960.10534274}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dennis |first=W. |last2=Najarian |first2=P. |year=1957 |title=Infant development under environmental handicap |journal=Psychological Monograph |volume=71 |issue=7 |pages=1â13 |doi=10.1037/h0093705}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under conditions of extra stimulation, the motor behavior of these children rapidly improved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Sayegh |first=Y. |last2=Dennis |first2=W. |year=1965 |title=The effects of supplementary experience upon behavioral development of infants in institutions |journal=Child Development |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=81â90 |pmid=14296799 |doi=10.2307/1126782 |jstor=1126782}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some research has shown that the use of a treadmill can be beneficial to children with motor delays including [[Down syndrome]] and cerebral palsy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Masiello |first=T. |last2=Tucker |year=2006 |title=Influences of treadmill training on the motor development of infants with and without disabilities |url=http://www.researchtopractice.info/bridges/bridges_vol4_no5.pdf |journal=Bridges |volume=4 |issue=5 |pages=1â17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research on opportunity to respond and the building of motor development continues today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cautilli |first=J.D. |last2=Dziewolska |first2=H. |year=2005 |title=A Brief Report: Can Contingent Imitation Reinforce Truck Lifting In A Three-Month-Old Infant? |url= |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=229â234}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dziewolska |first=H. |last2= Cautilli |first2=J.D. |year= 2006 |title=The Effects of a Motor Training Package on Minimally Assisted Standing Behavior in a Three-Month-Old Infant |url= |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=111â124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cautilli |first=J.D. |last2=Dziewolska |first2=H. |year=2006 |title=Brief Report: The Use of Opportunity to Respond and Practice to increase efficiency of the stepping reflex in a five-month-old infant |url= |journal=Behavior Analyst Today |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=538â547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The behavioral development model of motor activity has produced a number of techniques, including [[operant]]-based [[biofeedback]] to facilitate development with success.

San Diego: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Skinner, language learning depends on environmental variables, which can be mastered by a child through imitation, practice, and selective [[reinforcement]] including automatic reinforcement.

[[B.F. Skinner]] was one of the first psychologists to take the role of imitation in verbal behavior as a serious mechanism for acquisition.&lt;ref name="Skinner57"/&gt; He identified echoic behavior as one of his basic verbal operants, postulating that verbal behavior was learned by an infant from a verbal community. Skinner's account takes verbal behavior beyond an intra-individual process to an inter-individual process. He defined verbal behavior as "behavior reinforced through the mediation of others".&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. (1957), page 4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Noam Chomsky]] refuted Skinnerâs assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Chomsky |first=N. |last2=Skinner |first2=B.F. |year=1959 |title=Review of Skinner's Verbal Behavior |journal=Language |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=26â58 |doi=10.2307/411334 |jstor= 411334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development of self===
Robert Kohelenberg and Mavis Tsai (1991) created a behavior analytic model accounting for the development of oneâs âselfâ.&lt;ref&gt;Kohlenberg, R. &amp; Tsai, M. (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; Their model proposes that verbal processes can be used to form a stable sense of who we are through behavioral processes such as [[stimulus control]]. Kohlenberg and Tsai developed [[functional analytic psychotherapy]] to treat psychopathological disorders arising from the frequent invalidations of a childâs statements such that âIâ does not emerge.
Other behavior analytic models for personality disorders exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Nelson-Gray |first=R.O. |last2=Mitchell |first2=J.T. |last3=Kimbrel |first3=N.A. |last4=Hurst |first4=R.M. |year=2007 |title=The Development and Maintenance of Personality Disorders: A Behavioral Perspective |url= |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=443â445}}&lt;/ref&gt; They trace out the complex biologicalâenvironmental interaction for the development of avoidant and borderline personality disorders. They focus on [[Reinforcement sensitivity theory]], which states that some individuals are more or less sensitive to reinforcement than others. Nelson-Grey views problematic response classes as being maintained by reinforcing consequences or through rule governance.

===Socialization===
Over the last few decades, studies have supported the idea that contingent use of [[reinforcement]] and [[punishment]] over extended periods of time lead to the development of both pro-social and anti-social behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Eisenberg, N. |author2=Wolchik, S.A. |author3=Goldberg, L. |author4=Engel, I. |year=1992 |title=Parental values, reinforcement, and young children's prosocial behavior: a longitudinal study |journal=J Genet Psychol |volume=153 |issue=1 |pages=19â36 |pmid=1645156 |doi=10.1080/00221325.1992.10753699}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Snyder, J.J.; Patterson, G.R. 1995 371â91"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Snyder, J.J. |author2=Patterson, G.R. |year=1995 |title=Individual differences in social aggression: a test of a reinforcement model of socialization in the natural environment |journal=Behav Ther |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=371â91 |doi=10.1016/S0005-7894(05)80111-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Patterson, G.R. |year=2002 |title=Etiology and treatment of child and adolescent antisocial behavior |journal=Behav Analyst Today |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=133â45 |url=http://behavior-analyst-today.com/VOL-3/BAT-3-2.pdf |type = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; However research has shown that reinforcement is more effective than punishment when teaching behavior to a child. It has also been shown that modeling is more effective than âpreachingâ in developing pro-social behavior in children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bryan |first=J.H. |last2=Walbek |first2=N.H. |year=1970 |title=Impact of words and deeds concerning altruism upon children |journal=Child Development |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=747â759 |doi=10.2307/1127221 |jstor=1127221}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bryan |first=J.H. |last2=Walbek |first2=N. |year=1970 |title=Preaching and practicing generosity: Children's action and reaction |journal=Child Development |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=329â353 |doi=10.2307/1127035 |jstor=1127035}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rewards have also been closely studied in relation to the development of social behaviors in children.

The development of social skills in children is largely affected in that classroom setting by both teachers and peers. Reinforcement and punishment play major roles here as well. Peers frequently reinforce each otherâs behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Charlesworth |first=R. |last2=Hartup |first2=W.W. |year=1967 |title=Positive social reinforcement in the nursery school per group |journal=Child Development |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages= 993â1002 |pmid=5583075 |doi=10.2307/1127097 |jstor=1127097}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Furman |first=W. |last2=Masters |first2=J.C. |year=1980 |title=Affective consequences of social reinforcement, punishment, and neutral behavior |journal=Developmental Psychology |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=100â104 |doi=10.1037/0012-1649.16.2.100}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the major areas that teachers and peers influence is sex-typed behavior, while peers also largely influence modes of initiating interaction, and aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lamb |first=M.E. |last2=Easterbrooks |first2=M.A. |last3=Holden |first3=G.W. |year=1980 |title=Reinforcement and punishment among preschoolers: Characteristics, effects, and correlates |journal=Child Development |volume=51 |issue=4 |pages=1230â1236 |doi=10.2307/1129565 |jstor=1129565}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lamb |first=M.E. |last2=Roopnarine |first2=J.L. |year=1979 |title=Peer influences on sex-role development in preschoolers |journal=Child Development |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=1219â1222 |doi=10.2307/1129353 |jstor=1129353}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Leiter |first=M.P. |year=1977 |title=A study of reciprocity in preschool play groups |journal=Child Development |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=1288â1295 |doi= 10.2307/1128486 |jstor=1128486}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, G.R.; Littman, R.A. &amp; Bricker, W.

Behavioral principles have also been researched in emerging peer groups, focusing on status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Coie |first=J.D. |last2=Kupersmidt |first2=J.B. |year=1983 |title=A Behavioral Analysis of Emerging Social Status in Boys' Groups. |journal=Child Development |volume=54 |issue=6 |pages=1400â1416 |doi=10.2307/1129803 |jstor=1129803}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that it takes different social skills to enter groups than it does to maintain or build oneâs status in groups. Research also suggests that neglected children are the least interactive and aversive, yet remain relatively unknown in groups. 
Children suffering from social problems do see an improvement in social skills after [[behavior therapy]] and [[behavior modification]]  (see [[applied behavior analysis]]). Modeling has been successfully used to increase participation by shy and withdrawn children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Jakibuchuk |first=Z. |last2=Smeriglio |first2=V.L. |year=1976 |title=The influence of symbolic modeling on the social behavior of preschool children with low levels of social responsiveness |journal=Child Development |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=838â841 |doi=10.2307/1128203 |jstor=1128203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shaping of socially desirable behavior through [[positive reinforcement]] seems to have some of the most positive effects in children experiencing social problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/h0033226 |author=O'Connor, R.D. |year=1972 |title=Relative efficacy of modeling, shaping, and the combined procedure for the modification of social withdrawal |journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology |volume=79 |issue=3 |pages=327â334 |pmid=5033375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-social behavior===
In the development of [[anti-social behavior]], [[etiology|etiological models]] for anti-social behavior show considerable correlation with [[negative reinforcement]] and response matching (see [[matching law]]).&lt;ref name= "Patterson02"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Snyder |first=J. |last2=Stoolmiller |first2=M. |last3=Patterson |first3=G.R. |last4=Schrepferman |first4=L. |last5=Oeser |first5=J. |last6=Johnson |first6=K. |last7= Soetaert |first7=D. |year=2003 |title=The Application of Response Allocation Matching to Understanding Risk Mechanisms in Development: The Case of Young Children's Deviant Talk and Play, and Risk for Early-Onset Antisocial Behavior |url= |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=435â453}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aversives|Escape conditioning]], through the use of coercive behavior, has a powerful effect on the development and use of future anti-social tactics. The use of anti-social tactics during conflicts can be negatively reinforced and eventually seen as functional for the child in moment to moment interactions.&lt;ref name="Snyder, J.J.; Patterson, G.R. 1995 371â91"/&gt;
Anti-social behaviors will also develop in children when imitation is reinforced by social approval. If approval is not given by teachers or parents, it can often be given by peers. An example of this is swearing. Imitating a parent, brother, peer, or a character on TV, a child may engage in the anti-social behavior of swearing. Upon saying it they may be reinforced by those around them which will lead to an increase in the anti-social behavior. 
The role of [[stimulus control]] has also been extensively explored in the development of anti-social behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, G.R.; Reid, J.B. &amp; Eddy, J.M. (2002). A brief history of the Oregon model. In J.B. Reid, G.R. Patterson &amp; J. Snyder (Eds.) ''Antisocial behavior in children and adolescents: A developmental analysis and model for interventions''. APA Press&lt;/ref&gt;
Recent behavioral focus in the study of anti-social behavior has been a focus on rule-governed behavior. While correspondence for saying and doing has long been an interest for behavior analysts in normal development and typical socialization, recent conceptualizations have been built around families that actively train children in anti-social rules, as well as children who fail to develop rule control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Osnes |first=P.G. |last2=Adelinis |first2=J. |year=2005 |title=Correspondence Training, Rule Governance, Generalization, and Stimulus Control: Connections or Disconnections? |journal=Behavioral Development Bulletin |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=48â55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bevill-Davis Alicia |author2=Clees Tom J. |author3=Gast David L. |year=2004 |title= Correspondence Training: A Review of the Literature |journal=JEIBI |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=14â27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Peleaz |first=M. |last2=Moreno |first2=R. |year=1998 |title=A taxonomy of rules and their correspondence in rule governed behavior |journal=Mexican Journal of Behavior Analysis |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=197â214}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Snyder |first=J.J. |last2=McEachern |first2=A. |last3=Schrepferman |first3=L. |last4=Zettle |first4=R. |last5=Johnson |first5=K. |last6= Swink |first6=N. |last7=McAlpine |first7=C. |year=2006 |title=Rule-Governance, Correspondence Training, and Discrimination Learning: A Developmental Analysis of Covert Conduct Problems |journal=Slp-Aba |volume= 1 |issue=1 |pages=43â65}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Barry |first=L.M. |last2=Haraway |first2=D.L. |year=2005 |title=Behavioral Self-Control Strategies for Young Children |url= |journal=JEIBI |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=79â89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developmental depression with origins in childhood===
Behavioral theory of [[Depression (mood)|depression]] was outlined by [[Charles Ferster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ferster |first=C.B. |year=1973 |title=A functional analysis of depression |journal=American Psychologist |volume=28 |issue=10 |pages=857â870 |pmid=4753644 |doi=10.1037/h0035605}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later revision was provided by Peter Lewisohn and Hyman Hops. Hops continued the work on the role of [[negative reinforcement]] in maintaining depression with Anthony Biglan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hops |first=H. |year=1992 |title=Parental depression and child behaviour problems: Implications for behavioural family intervention |journal= Behavior Change |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=126â138}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hops |first=H. |last2=Biglan |first2=A. |last3=Sherman |first3=L.

The most recent summary and conceptual revisions of the behavioral model was provided by Johnathan Kanter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Kanter |first=J.W. |last2=Cautilli |first2=J.D. |last3=Busch |first3=A.M. |last4=Baruch |first4=D.E. |year=2005 |title=Toward a Comprehensive Functional Analysis of Depressive Behavior: Five Environmental Factors and a Possible Sixth and Seventh |url= |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=65â74}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard model is that depression has multiple paths to develop. It can be generated by five basic processes, including: lack or loss of [[positive reinforcement]],&lt;ref&gt;In addition to loss of reinforcement, the loss of contingency between behavior and reinforcement can also lead to depression&lt;/ref&gt; direct positive or negative reinforcement for depressive behavior, lack of rule-governed behavior or too much rule-governed behavior, and/or too much environmental [[punishment]]. For children, some of these variables could set the pattern for lifelong problems. For example, a child whose depressive behavior functions for [[negative reinforcement]] by stopping fighting between parents could develop a lifelong pattern of depressive behavior in the case of conflicts. Two paths that are particularly important are (1) lack or loss of reinforcement because of missing necessary skills at a developmental cusp point or (2) the failure to develop adequate rule-governed behavior. For the latter, the child could develop a pattern of always choosing the short-term small immediate reward (i.e., escaping studying for a test) at the expense of the long-term larger reward (passing courses in middle school). The treatment approach that emerged from this research is called [[behavioral activation]].

In addition, use of positive reinforcement has been shown to improve symptoms of depression in children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Rawson |first=H.E. |last2=Tabb |first2=L.C. |year=1993 |title=Effects of therapeutic intervention on childhood depression |journal=Child and Adolesent Social Work Journal |volume=10 |pages=39â53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reinforcement has also been shown to improve the self-concept in children with depression comorbid with learning difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Rawson |first=H.E. |last2=Cassady |first2=J.C. |year=1995 |title=Effects of therapeutic intervention on self-concepts of children with learning disabilities |journal=Child and Adolescent Social Work Journal |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=19â31 |doi=10.1007/BF01876137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rawson and Tabb (1993) used reinforcement with 99 students (90 males and 9 females) aged from 8 to 12 with behavior disorders in a residential treatment program and showed significant reduction in depression symptoms compared to the control group.

===Cognitive behavior===
As children get older, direct control of contingencies is modified by the presence of rule-governed behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Kendler, H. &amp; Kendler, T. (1975).

===Learned units and developmental retardation===
Behavior analysts have spent considerable time measuring learning in both the classroom and at home. In these settings, the role of  a lack of stimulation has often been evidenced in the development of mild and moderate mental retardation.&lt;ref&gt;Bijou, S.W. (1966). A functional analysis of retarded development. In N.R. Ellis (Ed.) ''International Review of Research in Mental Retardation''. NY: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent work has focused on a model of "developmental retardation,".&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood, C.R.; Hart, B.; Walker, D. &amp; Risley, T. (1994). The opportunity to respond and academic performance revisited: A behavioral theory of developmental retardation and its prevention. In R. Gardener, D.M. Sainato, J.O. Cooper, T.E. Heron, W.L.

(pp. 161â171) Pacific Grove, CA: Brookes-Cole&lt;/ref&gt; an area that emphasizes cumulative environmental effects and their role in developmental delays. To measure these developmental delays, subjects are given the opportunity to respond, defined as the instructional antecedent, and success is signified by the appropriate response and/or fluency in responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Greenwood |first=Ward |last2=Luze |year=2003 |title=The Early Communication Indicator (ECI) for Infants and Toddlers: What It Is, Where It's Been, and Where It Needs to Go |url= |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=383â392}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the learned unit is identified by the opportunity to respond in addition to given reinforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Greer |first=D. |last2=Keohane |first2=D. |last3=Healy |year=2002 |title=Quality and Comprehensive Applications of Behavior Analysis to Schooling |url= |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=120â132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study employed this model by comparing students' time of instruction was in affluent schools to time of instruction in lower income schools. Results showed that lower income schools displayed approximately 15 minutes less instruction than more affluent schools due to disruptions in [[classroom management]] and [[behavior management]]. Altogether, these disruptions culminated into two years worth of lost instructional time by grade 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Greenwood |first=C.R. |last2=Carta |first2=J.J. |last3=Hart |first3=B. |last4=Kamps |first4=D. |last5=Terry |first5=D. |last6=Delquardi |first6=J.C. |last7=Walker |first7=D. |last8=Risley |first8=T.R. |last9= Risley |first9=T. |last10=Delquadri |first10=Joseph C. |year=1992 |title=Out of the laboratory and into the community: Twenty-six years of applied behavior analysis at Juniper Gardens Children Center |journal=American Psychologist |volume=47 |issue=11 |pages=1464â1474 |pmid=1482007 |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.47.11.1464|display-authors=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of behavior analytic research is to provide methods for reducing the overall number of children who fall into the retardation range of development by [[behavioral engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;Bijou, S.W.

(pp. 223â241). Baltimore: Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hart and Risely (1995, 1999) have completed extensive research on this topic as well.&lt;ref&gt;Hart, B. &amp; Risley, T.R. (1995). ''Meaningful differences in the everyday experience of young American children''. Baltimore: Brookes&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hart, B. &amp; Risley, T.R. (1999). ''The social world of children learning to talk''. Baltimore: Brookes&lt;/ref&gt; These researchers measured the rates of parent communication with children of the ages of 2â4 years and correlated this information with the IQ scores of the children at age 9. Their analyses revealed that higher parental communication with younger children was positively correlated with higher IQ in older children, even after controlling for race, class, and socio-economic status. Additionally, they concluded a significant change in IQ scores required intervention with at-risk children for approximately 40 hours per week.

Responses are organized based upon the particular form needed to fit the current environmental challenges as well as the functional consequences. An example of large response classes lies in contingency adduction,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Andronis |first=P.T. |last2=Lang |first2=T.V.J. |last3=Goldiamond |first3=I. |year=1997 |title=Contingency adduction of "symbolic aggression" by pigeon |journal=The Analysis of Verbal Behavior |volume=16 |pages=10â23}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is an area that needs much further research, especially with a focus on how large classes of concepts shift. For example, as [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]] observed, individuals have a tendency at the pre-operational stage to have limits in their ability to preserve information(Piaget &amp; Szeminska, 1952). While childrenâs training in the development of conservation skills has been generally successful,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bucher |first=B. |last2=Schneider |first2=R.E. |year=1973 |title=Acquisition and generalization of conservation by pre-schoolers, using operant training |journal=Journal of Experimental Child Psychology |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=187â204 |doi=10.1016/0022-0965(73)90160-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Waghorn |first=L. |last2= Sullivan |first2=E.V. |year=1970 |title=The exploration of transition rules in conservation of quantity (substance) using film mediated modeling |journal=Acta Psychologica |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages= 65â80 |pmid=5497127 |doi=10.1016/0001-6918(70)90091-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; complications have been noted.&lt;ref name=Field1987&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Field |first=D. |year=1987 |title=A review of preschool conservation training: An analysis of analyses |journal=Developmental Review |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=210â251 |doi=10.1016/0273-2297(87)90013-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behavior analysts argue that this is largely due to the number of tool skills that need to be developed and integrated. Contingency adduction offers a process by which such skills can be synthesized and which shows why it deserves further attention, particularly by early childhood interventionists.

===Autism===
Ferster (1961) was the first researcher to posit a behavior analytic theory for [[autism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ferster |first=C.B. |year=1961 |title=Positive reinforcement and the behavioral deficits of autistic children |journal=Child Development |volume=32 |pages=437â456 |pmid=13699189 |doi=10.2307/1126210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ferster's model saw autism as a by-product of social interactions between parent and child. Ferster presented an analysis of how a variety of contingencies of reinforcement between parent and child during early childhood might establish and strengthen a repertoire of behaviors typically seen in children diagnosed with autism. A similar model was proposed by Drash and Tutor (1993), who developed the contingency-shaped or behavioral incompatibility theory of autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Drash |first=P.W. |last2=Tudor |first2=R.M. |year=1993 |title=A functional analysis of verbal delay in preschool children: Implications for prevention and total recovery |journal=The Analysis of Verbal Behavior |volume=11 |pages=19â29|pmid=22477077 |pmc=2748560 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They identified at least six [[reinforcement]] paradigms that may contribute to significant deficiencies in verbal behavior typically characteristic of children diagnosed as austistic. They proposed that each of these paradigms may also create a repertoire of avoidance responses that could contribute to the establishment of a repertoire of behavior that would be incompatible with the acquisition of age-appropriate verbal behavior.
More recent models attribute [[autism]] to neurological and sensory models that are overly worked and subsequently produce the autistic repertoire. Lovaas and Smith (1989) proposed that children with autism have a mismatch between their nervous systems and the environment,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lovaas |first=O.I. |last2=Smith |first2=T. |year=1989 |title=A comprehensive behavior theory of autistic children: Paradigm for research and treatment |journal=Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=17â29 |pmid=2671048 |doi=10.1016/0005-7916(89)90004-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Bijou and Ghezzi (1999) proposed a behavioral interference theory.&lt;ref&gt;Bijou, S.W. &amp; Ghezzi, P.M. (1999). The behavior interference theory of autistic behavior in young children. In P.M. Ghezzi, W.L. Williams &amp; J.E. Carr (Eds.), ''Autism: Behavior analytic perspectives''. (pp. 33â43). Reno, NV: Context Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, both the environmental mismatch model and the inference model were recently reviewed,&lt;ref&gt;Hixson, M.D.; Wilson, J.L.; Doty, S.J. &amp; Vladescu, J.C. (2008). A Review of the Behavioral Theories of Autism and Evidence for an Environmental Etiology. ''Journal of Speech-Language Pathology and Applied Behavior Analysis''. Special Compiled Issue 2.4 - 3.1, 46â59.&lt;/ref&gt; and new evidence shows support for the notion that the development of autistic behaviors are due to escape and avoidance of certain types of sensory stimuli. However, most behavioral models of autism remain largely speculative due to limited research efforts.

==Role in education==
One of the largest impacts of behavior analysis of child development is its role in the field of education. In 1968, Siegfried Englemann used [[operant conditioning]] techniques in a combination with rule learning to produce the [[direct instruction]] curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Engelmann, S. &amp; Carnine, D. (1991). ''Theory of instruction: Principles and applications''. Eugene, OR: ADI Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Englemann |first=S.E. |year=1968 |title=Relating operant techniques to programming and teaching |journal=Journal of School Psychology |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=89â96 |doi=10.1016/0022-4405(68)90002-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Fred S. Keller]] used similar techniques to develop [[programmed instruction]]. [[B.F. Skinner]] developed a programmed instruction curriculum for teaching handwriting. One of Skinner's students, [[Ogden Lindsley]], developed a standardized semilogrithmic chart, the "Standard Behavior Chart," now "Standard Celeration Chart," used to record frequencies of behavior, and to allow direct visual comparisons of both frequencies and changes in those frequencies (termed "celeration"). The use of this charting tool for analysis of instructional effects or other environmental variables through the direct measurement of learner performance has become known as [[precision teaching]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Calkin, A.B. |year=2005 |title=Precision teaching: the standard celeration charts |journal=Behav Analyst Today |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=207â16 |url= |type = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behavior analysts with a focus on behavioral development form the basis of a movement called [[positive behavior support]] (PBS). PBS has focused on building safe schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Scott |first=T.M. Gagnon |last2=Nelson |first2=C.M. |year=2008 |title=School-Wide Systems of Positive Behavior Support: A Framework for Reducing School Crime and Violence |journal=Journal of Behavior Analysis of Offender and Victim: Treatment and Prevention |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=69â80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In education, there are many different kinds of learning that are implemented to improve skills needed for interactions later in life. Examples of this differential learning include social and language skills.&lt;ref&gt;"Child Development" Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory. 2001. 5 February 2008. http://www.nwrel.org/request/june01/child.html&lt;/ref&gt; According to the NWREL (Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory), too much interaction with technology will hinder a child's social interactions with others due to its potential to become an addiction and subsequently lead to anti-social behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Meltz, Barbara F. "Zora and the explorer" ''The Boston Globe'' October 22, 2007 Globe Newspaper Company 5 February 2008 http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2007/10/22/zora_and_the_explorer&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of language development, children will start to learn and know about 5â20 different words by 18 months old.&lt;ref&gt;"Language Development In Children" Child Development Institute, LLC 1998â2007. 5 February 2008. http://www.childdevelopmentinfo.com/development/language_development.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critiques of behavioral approach and new developments==
Behavior analytic theories have been criticized for their focus on the explanation of the acquisition of relatively simple behavior (i.e., the behavior of nonhuman species, of infants, and of individuals who are intellectually disabled or autistic) rather than of complex behavior (see Commons &amp; Miller).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Commons |first=M.L. |last2=Miller |first2=P.M. |year=2001 |title=A Quantitative Behavioral Model of Developmental Stage Based upon the Model of Hierarchical Complexity |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=222â252}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Commons]] continued [[behavior analysis]]'s rejection of [[Mentalism (psychology)|mentalism]] and the substitution of a [[task analysis]] of the particular skills to be learned. In his new model, Commons has created a behavior analytic model of more complex behavior in line with more contemporary quantitative behavior analytic models called the [[model of hierarchical complexity]]. Commons constructed the model of hierarchical complexity of tasks and their corresponding stages of performance using just three main axioms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Commons |first=M.L. |last2=Miller |first2=P.M. |year=1998 |title=A quantitative behavior-analytic theory of development |journal=Mexican Journal of Experimental Analysis of Behavior |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=153â180}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Commons |first=M.L. |last2=Trudeau |first2=E.J. |last3=Stein |first3=S.A. |last4=Richards |first4= F.A. |last5=Krause |first5=S.R. |year=1998 |title=Hierarchical Complexity of Tasks Shows the Existence of Developmental Stages |journal=Developmental Review |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=237â278 |doi=10.1006/drev.1998.0467}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the study of development, recent work has been generated regarding the combination of behavior analytic views with dynamical systems theory.&lt;ref&gt;Novak, G. &amp; Pelaez, M. (2004). ''Child and adolescent development: A behavioral systems approach''. Sage&lt;/ref&gt; The added benefit of this approach is its portrayal of how small patterns of changes in behavior in terms of principles and mechanisms over time can produce substantial changes in development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Novak |first=G. |last2=Pelaez |first2=M. |year=2002 |title=A behavior-analytic developmental model is better |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=25 |pages=466â468 |doi=10.1017/s0140525x02340081}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current research in behavior analysis attempts to extend the patterns learned in childhood and to determine their impact on [[adult development]].

==Professional organizations==
The [[Association for Behavior Analysis]] International has a special interest group for the behavior analysis of child development.

Doctoral level behavior analysts who are psychologists belong to [[American Psychological Association]]'s division 25: [[behavior analysis]].

The World Association for Behavior Analysis has a certification in behavior therapy. The exam draws questions on behavioral theories of child development as well as behavioral theories of child psychopathology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baojournal.com/WCBA/WCBA.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110110222511/http://www.baojournal.com/WCBA/WCBA.html |archivedate=2011-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, Russell led the British "revolt against [[British idealism|idealism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Russell and G.&amp;nbsp;E. Moore broke themselves free from British [[Idealism]] which, for nearly 90 years, had dominated British philosophy. Russell would later recall in "My Mental Development" that "with a sense of escaping from prison, we allowed ourselves to think that grass is green, that the sun and stars would exist if no one was aware of them ..."âRussell B, (1944) "My Mental Development", in Schilpp, Paul Arthur: ''The Philosophy of Bertrand Russell'', New York: Tudor, 1951, pp. 3â20.&lt;/ref&gt; He is considered one of the founders of [[analytic philosophy]] along with his predecessor [[Gottlob Frege]], colleague [[G.&amp;nbsp;E.

Bertrand Russell was born on 18 May 1872 at Ravenscroft, [[Trellech]], [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]], into an influential and liberal family of the [[British aristocracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Sidney Hook, "Lord Russell and the War Crimes Trial", ''Bertrand Russell: critical assessments'', Vol. 1, edited by A. D. Irvine, New York 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;178&lt;/ref&gt; His parents, [[John Russell, Viscount Amberley|Viscount]] and [[Katharine Russell, Viscountess Amberley|Viscountess Amberley]], were radical for their times. Lord Amberley consented to his wife's affair with their children's tutor, the biologist [[Douglas Spalding]]. Both were early advocates of [[birth control]] at a time when this was considered scandalous.&lt;ref name="calicut"&gt;{{cite web|last=Paul|first=Ashley|title=Bertrand Russell: The Man and His Ideas.|url=http://www.geocities.com/vu3ash/index.html|accessdate=28 October 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060501064331/http://www.geocities.com/vu3ash/index.html|archivedate=1 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Amberley was an [[atheist]] and his atheism was evident when he asked the philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]] to act as Russell's secular godfather.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Bertrand and Perkins, Ray (ed.) ''Yours faithfully, Bertrand Russell''. Open Court Publishing, 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;4.&lt;/ref&gt; Mill died the year after Russell's birth, but his writings had a great effect on Russell's life.

His paternal grandfather, the [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Earl Russell]], had been asked twice by [[Queen Victoria]] to form a government, serving her as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] in the 1840s and 1860s.&lt;ref name="John R"&gt;{{cite web| last = Bloy| first = Marjie, PhD| title = Lord John Russell (1792â1878)| url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/pms/russell.html| accessdate =28 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russells had been prominent in England for several centuries before this, coming to power and the [[peerage]] with the rise of the [[Tudor dynasty]] (see: [[Duke of Bedford]]). They established themselves as one of the leading British [[British Whig Party|Whig]] families, and participated in every great political event from the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] in 1536â1540 to the [[Glorious Revolution]] in 1688â1689 and the [[Great Reform Act]] in 1832.&lt;ref name="John R"/&gt;&lt;ref name="peerage"&gt;Cokayne, G.

===Childhood and adolescence===
Russell had two siblings: brother [[Frank Russell, 2nd Earl Russell|Frank]] (nearly seven years older than Bertrand), and sister Rachel (four years older). In June 1874 Russell's mother died of [[diphtheria]], followed shortly by Rachel's death. In January 1876, his father died of [[bronchitis]] following a long period of [[Major depressive disorder|depression]]. Frank and Bertrand were placed in the care of their staunchly [[Victorian morality|Victorian]] paternal grandparents, who lived at [[Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park|Pembroke Lodge]] in [[Richmond Park]]. His grandfather, former Prime Minister [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Earl Russell]], died in 1878, and was remembered by Russell as a kindly old man in a wheelchair. His grandmother, the [[Frances Russell, Countess Russell|Countess Russell]] (nÃ©e Lady Frances Elliot), was the dominant family figure for the rest of Russell's childhood and youth.&lt;ref name="Gallery"/&gt;&lt;ref name="calicut"/&gt;

The countess was from a Scottish [[Presbyterian]] family, and successfully petitioned the [[Court of Chancery]] to set aside a provision in Amberley's will requiring the children to be raised as agnostics. Despite her religious conservatism, she held progressive views in other areas (accepting [[Darwinism]] and supporting [[Home Rule|Irish Home Rule]]), and her influence on Bertrand Russell's outlook on [[social justice]] and standing up for principle remained with him throughout his life. (One could challenge the view that Bertrand stood up for his principles, based on his own well-known quotation: "I would never die for my beliefs because I might be wrong".) Her favourite Bible verse, "Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil" ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 23:2), became his motto. The atmosphere at Pembroke Lodge was one of frequent prayer, emotional repression, and formality; Frank reacted to this with open rebellion, but the young Bertrand learned to hide his feelings.

Russell's adolescence was very lonely, and he often contemplated suicide. He remarked in his autobiography that his keenest interests were in religion and mathematics, and that only his wish to know more mathematics kept him from suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Autobiography|page=38|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|isbn=9780415189859|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SlMrmmrNuEoC|author=Bertrand Russell}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at home by a series of tutors.&lt;ref name="nobel prize"&gt;The Nobel Foundation (1950).

During these formative years he also discovered the works of [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]. In his autobiography, he writes: "I spent all my spare time reading him, and learning him by heart, knowing no one to whom I could speak of what I thought or felt, I used to reflect how wonderful it would have been to know Shelley, and to wonder whether I should meet any live human being with whom I should feel so much sympathy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Autobiography|page=35|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|isbn=9780415189859|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SlMrmmrNuEoC|author=Bertrand Russell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russell claimed that beginning at age 15, he spent considerable time thinking about the validity of [[Dogma#In religion|Christian religious dogma]], which he found very unconvincing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP4FDLegX9s|title=1959 Bertrand Russell CBC interview|year=1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this age, he came to the conclusion that there is no [[free will]] and, two years later, that there is no life after death. Finally, at the age of 18, after reading Mill's ''Autobiography'', he abandoned the "[[First Cause]]" argument and became an [[atheist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Autobiography|chapter=2: Adolescence|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|isbn=9780415189859|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SlMrmmrNuEoC|author=Bertrand Russell}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://richarddawkins.net/articles/4833 |title=Bertrand Russell on God |year=1959 |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] |accessdate=8 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126090302/http://richarddawkins.net/articles/4833 |archivedate=26 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He traveled to the continent in 1890 with an American friend, [[Edward FitzGerald (mountaineer)|Edward FitzGerald]], and with FitzGerald's family he visited the [[Paris Exhibition of 1889]] and was able to climb the [[Eiffel Tower]] soon after it was completed.&lt;ref name=Russell1967a&gt;{{cite book |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |title=The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell: 1872â1914 |year=1967 |edition=2000 |url={{Google books|dVBpAwAAQBAJ|page=39|plainurl=y}} |page=39 |location=New York |publisher=Routledge }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===University and first marriage===
[[File:Portrait of Bertrand Russell in 1893.jpg|thumb|Russell at Trinity College in 1893]]
Russell won a scholarship to read for the [[Mathematical Tripos]] at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], and commenced his studies there in 1890,&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=RSL890BA|name=Russell, the Hon. Bertrand Arthur William}}&lt;/ref&gt; taking as coach [[Robert Rumsey Webb]]. He became acquainted with the younger [[George Edward Moore]] and came under the influence of [[Alfred North Whitehead]], who recommended him to the [[Cambridge Apostles]]. He quickly distinguished himself in mathematics and philosophy, graduating as seventh [[Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|Wrangler]] in the former in 1893 and becoming a Fellow in the latter in 1895.&lt;ref name="Whitehead"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Whitehead.html|title=Alfred North Whitehead|accessdate=8 November 2007|last=O'Connor|first=J.

Russell was 17&amp;nbsp;years old in the summer of 1889 when he met the family of [[Alys Pearsall Smith]], an American [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] five years older, who was a graduate of [[Bryn Mawr College]] near [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref name=Russell1967b&gt;{{cite book |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |title=The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell: 1872â1914 |year=1967 |edition=2000 |url={{Google books|dVBpAwAAQBAJ|page=72|plainurl=y}} |page=72 |location=New York |publisher=Routledge }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Monk1996&gt;{{cite book |last=Monk |first=Ray |title=Bertrand Russell: The Spirit of Solitude, 1872â1921 |url={{Google books|AzssomBIDRIC|page=37|plainurl=y}} |year=1996 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=978-0-684-82802-2 |page=37 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a friend of the Pearsall Smith family &amp;ndash; they knew him primarily as "Lord John's grandson" and enjoyed showing him off.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

He soon fell in love with the puritanical, high-minded Alys, and, contrary to his grandmother's wishes, married her on 13&amp;nbsp;December 1894. Their marriage began to fall apart in 1901 when it occurred to Russell, while he was cycling, that he no longer loved her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote=I went out bicycling one afternoon, and suddenly, as I was riding along a country road, I realised that I no longer loved Alys|title=Autobiography|page=150|isbn=9780415189859|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SlMrmmrNuEoC|author=Bertrand Russell}}&lt;/ref&gt; She asked him if he loved her and he replied that he did not. Russell also disliked Alys's mother, finding her controlling and cruel. It was to be a hollow shell of a marriage. A lengthy period of separation began in 1911 with Russell's affair with [[Lady Ottoline Morrell]],&lt;ref name="the Journal of the Bertrand Russell Archives"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitalcommons.mcmaster.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1353&amp;context=russelljournal&amp;sei-redir=1|title=Bertrand Russell Meets His Muse: The Impact of Lady Ottoline Morrell (1911â12)|accessdate=1 March 2012|last=Moran|first=Margaret|year=1991|publisher=McMaster University Library Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he and Alys finally divorced in 1921 to enable Russell to remarry.&lt;ref name="Russell2002"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Griffin |editor-first=Nicholas |last=Russell |first=Bertrand

During his years of separation from Alys, Russell had passionate (and often simultaneous) affairs with a number of women, including Morrell and the actress [[Lady Constance Malleson]].&lt;ref name="private"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newcriterion.com:81/archive/11/sept92/brussell.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205032455/http://newcriterion.com/archive/11/sept92/brussell.htm |archivedate=5 December 2006 |title=Love, logic &amp; unbearable pity: The private Bertrand Russell |accessdate=15 November 2007 |last=Kimball |first=Roger |work=The New Criterion |volume=11 |issue=1 |date=September 1992 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have suggested that at this point he had an affair with [[Vivienne Haigh-Wood]], the English governess and writer, and first wife of [[T.

===Early career===
[[File:Russell1907-2.jpg|thumb|upright|Russell in 1907]]
Russell began his published work in 1896 with ''German Social Democracy'', a study in politics that was an early indication of a lifelong interest in political and social theory. In 1896 he taught German social democracy at the [[London School of Economics]].&lt;ref name="LSE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/aboutLSE/keyFacts/nobelPrizeWinners/russell.aspx|title=London School of Economics|website=Lse.ac.uk|date=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the [[Coefficients (dining club)|Coefficients dining club]] of social reformers set up in 1902 by the [[Fabian Society|Fabian]] campaigners [[Sidney Webb|Sidney]] and [[Beatrice Webb]].&lt;ref name="LettersPg16"&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|editor=Ray Perkins|title=Yours Faithfully, Bertrand Russell: Letters to the Editor 1904â1969|year=2001|publisher=Open Court Publishing|location=Chicago|isbn=0-8126-9449-X|page=16|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EayyTTpXL-QC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16|accessdate=16 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He now started an intensive study of the [[foundations of mathematics]] at Trinity.
In 1898 he wrote ''An Essay on the Foundations of Geometry'' which discussed the [[CayleyâKlein metric]]s used for [[non-Euclidean geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Bertrand (1898) ''An Essay on the Foundations of Geometry'', p.&amp;nbsp;32, re-issued 1956 by [[Dover Books]]&lt;/ref&gt;
He attended the [[International Congress of Philosophy]] in Paris in 1900 where he met [[Giuseppe Peano]] and [[Alessandro Padoa]].  The Italians had responded to [[Georg Cantor]], making a science of [[set theory]]; they gave Russell their literature including the [[Formulario mathematico]]. Russell was impressed by the precision of Peano's arguments at the Congress, read the literature upon returning to England, and came upon [[Russell's paradox]]. In 1903 he published ''[[The Principles of Mathematics]]'', a work on foundations of mathematics. It advanced a thesis of [[logicism]], that mathematics and logic are one and the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1950/russell-bio.html|title=Bertrand Russell, biography|publisher=Nobelprize.org|accessdate=23 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 29, in February 1901, Russell underwent what he called a "sort of mystic illumination", after witnessing [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]]'s wife's acute suffering in an [[Angina pectoris|angina]] attack. "I found myself filled with semi-mystical feelings about beauty ... and with a desire almost as profound as that of the [[Buddha]] to find some philosophy which should make human life endurable", Russell would later recall. "At the end of those five minutes, I had become a completely different person."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Autobiography|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|chapter=6: Principia Mathematica|isbn=9780415189859|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SlMrmmrNuEoC|author=Bertrand Russell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905 he wrote the essay "[[On Denoting]]", which was published in the philosophical journal ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]''. Russell was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1908|Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1908]].&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gallery"/&gt; The three-volume ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', written with Whitehead, was published between 1910 and 1913. This, along with the earlier ''The Principles of Mathematics'', soon made Russell world-famous in his field.

In 1910 he became a [[University of Cambridge]] lecturer at Trinity College where he studied. He was considered for a Fellowship, which would give him a vote in the college government and protect him from being fired for his opinions, but was passed over because he was "anti-clerical", essentially because he was agnostic. He was approached by the Austrian engineering student [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], who became his PhD student. Russell viewed Wittgenstein as a genius and a successor who would continue his work on logic. He spent hours dealing with Wittgenstein's various [[phobia]]s and his frequent bouts of despair. This was often a drain on Russell's energy, but Russell continued to be fascinated by him and encouraged his academic development, including the publication of Wittgenstein's ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'' in 1922.&lt;ref name="Wittgenstein"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rbjones.com/rbjpub/philos/history/rvw001.htm|title=Russell on Wittgenstein|publisher=Rbjones.com|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russell delivered his lectures on [[Logical Atomism]], his version of these ideas, in 1918, before the end of [[World War I]]. Wittgenstein was, at that time, serving in the Austrian Army and subsequently spent nine months in an Italian [[prisoner of war]] camp at the end of the conflict.

===First World War===
During World War I, Russell was one of the few people to engage in active [[opposition to World War I|pacifist activities]] and in 1916, because of his lack of a Fellowship, he was dismissed from Trinity College following his conviction under the [[Defence of the Realm Act 1914]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last = Hochschild|first = Adam|year = 2011|title = I Tried to Stop the Bloody Thing|periodical = The American Scholar|url = http://www.theamericanscholar.org/i-tried-to-stop-the-bloody-thing/|accessdate =10 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later described this as an illegitimate means the state used to violate freedom of expression, in [[Free Thought and Official Propaganda]]. Russell played a significant part in the ''Leeds Convention'' in June 1917, a historic event which saw well over a thousand "anti-war socialists" gather; many being delegates from the [[Independent Labour Party]] and the Socialist Party, united in their pacifist beliefs and advocating a peace settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Scharfenburger|first=Paul|title=1917|url=http://musicandhistory.com/music-and-history-by-the-year/178-1917.html|publisher=MusicandHistory.com|date=17 October 2012|accessdate=7 January 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117062625/http://musicandhistory.com/music-and-history-by-the-year/178-1917.html|archivedate=17 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The international press reported that Russell appeared with a number of Labour [[Member of Parliament|MPs]], including [[Ramsay MacDonald]] and [[Philip Snowden]], as well as former [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] MP and anti-conscription campaigner, Professor [[Arnold Lupton]].  After the event, Russell told [[Lady Ottoline Morrell]] that, "to my surprise, when I got up to speak, I was given the greatest ovation that was possible to give anybody".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|title=Pacifism and Revolution |page=xxxiv |chapter=A Summer of Hope |year=1995 |publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=British Socialists â Peace Terms Discussed|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article15731745|date=5 June 1917|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Trinity incident resulted in Russell being fined Â£100, which he refused to pay in hope that he would be sent to prison, but his books were sold at auction to raise the money. The books were bought by friends; he later treasured his copy of the [[King James Version|King James Bible]] that was stamped "Confiscated by Cambridge Police".

A later conviction for publicly lecturing against inviting the US to enter the war on the United Kingdom's side resulted in six months' imprisonment in [[Brixton (HM Prison)|Brixton prison]] (see ''[[Bertrand Russell's views on society]]'') in 1918.&lt;ref name="Pacifist"&gt;{{cite book|title=Bertrand Russell and the Pacifists in the First World War|last=Vellacott|first=Jo|isbn=0-85527-454-9|publisher=Harvester Press|location=Brighton|year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later said of his imprisonment:

{{quote|I found prison in many ways quite agreeable. I had no engagements, no difficult decisions to make, no fear of callers, no interruptions to my work. I read enormously; I wrote a book, "Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy"... and began the work for "Analysis of Mind"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Autobiography|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|chapter=8: The First War|isbn=9780415189859|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SlMrmmrNuEoC|author=Bertrand Russell}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Russell was reinstated to Trinity in 1919, resigned in 1920, was Tarner Lecturer 1926 and became a Fellow again in 1944 until 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Trinity College|url=https://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/about/historical-overview/trinity-in-literature/|title=Trinity in Literature|accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924, Bertrand again gained press attention when attending a "banquet" in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] with well-known campaigners, including [[Arnold Lupton]], who had been a [[Members of Parliament|Member of Parliament]] and had also endured imprisonment for "passive resistance to military or naval service".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=M.

===G. H. Hardy on the Trinity controversy and Russell's personal life===
In 1941, [[G. H. Hardy]] wrote a 61-page pamphlet titled ''Bertrand Russell and Trinity'' &amp;ndash; published later as a book by Cambridge University Press with a foreword by [[C. D. Broad]] &amp;ndash; in which he gave an authoritative account about Russell's 1916 dismissal from Trinity College, explaining that a reconciliation between the college and Russell had later taken place and gave details about Russell's personal life. Hardy writes that Russell's dismissal had created a scandal since the vast majority of the Fellows of the College opposed the decision. The ensuing pressure from the Fellows induced the Council to reinstate Russell. In January 1920, it was announced that Russell had accepted the reinstatement offer from Trinity and would begin lecturing from October. In July 1920, Russell applied for a one year leave of absence; this was approved. He spent the year giving lectures in China and Japan. In January 1921, it was announced by Trinity that Russell had resigned and his resignation had been accepted. This resignation, Hardy explains, was completely voluntary and was not the result of another altercation.

The reason for the resignation, according to Hardy, was that Russell was going through a tumultuous time in his personal life with a divorce and subsequent remarriage. Russell contemplated asking Trinity for another one-year leave of absence but decided against it, since this would have been an "unusual application" and the situation had the potential to snowball into another controversy. Although Russell did the right thing, in Hardy's opinion, the reputation of the College suffered due to Russell's resignation since the âworld of learningâ knew about Russell's altercation with Trinity but not that the rift had healed. In 1925, Russell was asked by the Council of Trinity College to give the ''Tarner Lectures'' on the Philosophy of the Sciences; these would later be the basis for one of Russell's best received books according to Hardy: ''The Analysis of Matter'', published in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bertrand Russell and Trinity|author=G. H. Hardy|pages=57â8|year=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the preface to the Trinity pamphlet, Hardy wrote:

{{quote|I wish to make it plain that Russell himself is not responsible, directly or indirectly, for the writing of the pamphlet ... I wrote it without his knowledge and, when I sent him the typescript and asked for his permission to print it, I suggested that, unless it contained misstatement of fact, he should make no comment on it. He agreed to this ... no word has been changed as the result of any suggestion from him.}}

===Between the wars===
In August 1920, Russell travelled to [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russia]] as part of an official delegation sent by the British government to investigate the effects of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]].&lt;ref name="FreeLib"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bertrand Russell (1872â1970)|publisher=Farlex, Inc.|url=http://russell.thefreelibrary.com/|accessdate=11 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote a four-part series of articles, titled "Soviet Russia{{emdash}}1920", for the US magazine ''[[The Nation]]''.&lt;ref name="nation1"&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/Nation-1920jul31-00121 |title=Soviet Russia{{emdash}}1920 |magazine=The Nation |date=31 July 1920 |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |pages=121â125 |accessdate=20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sov1920"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thenation.com/article/lenin-trotzky-and-gorky/ |title=Lenin, Trotzky and Gorky |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |work=The Nation |date=20 February 2008 |orig-year=First published 1920 |accessdate=20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He met [[Vladimir Lenin]] and had an hour-long conversation with him. In his autobiography, he mentions that he found Lenin disappointing, sensing an "impish cruelty" in him and comparing him to "an opinionated professor". He cruised down the [[Volga]] on a steamship. His experiences destroyed his previous tentative support for the revolution. He wrote a book ''The Practice and Theory of Bolshevism''&lt;ref name="Practice &amp;"&gt;Russell, Bertrand [http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17350 The Practice and Theory of Bolshevism by Bertrand Russell], 1920&lt;/ref&gt; about his experiences on this trip, taken with a group of 24 others from the UK, all of whom came home thinking well of the rÃ©gime, despite Russell's attempts to change their minds. For example, he told them that he heard shots fired in the middle of the night and was sure these were clandestine executions, but the others maintained that it was only cars backfiring.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Russell's lover [[Dora Russell|Dora Black]], a British author, [[feminist]] and socialist campaigner, visited Russia independently at the same time; in contrast to his reaction, she was enthusiastic about the revolution.&lt;ref name="Practice &amp;" /&gt;

The following autumn Russell, accompanied by Dora, visited [[Beijing|Peking]] (as it was then known in the West) to lecture on philosophy for a year.&lt;ref name="nobel prize"/&gt; He went with optimism and hope, seeing China as [[History of the Republic of China#Fight against warlordism and the First United Front|then being]] on a new path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Russell|first1=Bertrand|title=The Problem of China|date=1972|publisher=George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd.|location=London|page=252}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars present in China at the time included [[John Dewey]]&lt;ref name="pneumonia"/&gt; and [[Rabindranath Tagore]], the Indian Nobel-laureate poet.&lt;ref name="nobel prize"/&gt; Before leaving China, Russell became gravely ill with [[pneumonia]], and [[List of premature obituaries|incorrect reports]] of his death were published in the Japanese press.&lt;ref name="pneumonia"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bertrand Russell Reported Dead|work=The New York Times|date=21 April 1921|accessdate=11 December 2007|format=PDF|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1921/04/21/107014047.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the couple visited Japan on their return journey, Dora took on the role of spurning the local press by handing out notices reading "Mr. Bertrand Russell, having died according to the Japanese press, is unable to give interviews to Japanese journalists".&lt;ref name="papers"&gt;{{cite book|title=Uncertain Paths to Freedom: Russia and China, 1919â22|work=The Collected Papers of Bertrand Russell|volume=15|publisher=Routledge|year=2000|isbn=0-415-09411-9|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|editor=Richard A.

We don't use irony (fundamentally, because it interferes with consistently clearly stating the verifiable facts).

Dora was six months pregnant when the couple returned to England on 26 August 1921. Russell arranged a hasty divorce from Alys, marrying Dora six days after the divorce was finalised, on 27 September 1921. Russell's children with Dora were [[John Conrad Russell, 4th Earl Russell]], born on 16 November 1921, and [[Lady Katharine Tait|Katharine Jane Russell]] (now Lady Katharine Tait), born on 29 December 1923. Russell supported his family during this time by writing popular books explaining matters of [[physics]], ethics, and education to the layman.

From 1922 to 1927 the Russells divided their time between London and [[Cornwall]], spending summers in [[Porthcurno]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Autobiography|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|page=386|isbn=9780415189859|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SlMrmmrNuEoC|author=Bertrand Russell}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1922|1922]] and [[United Kingdom general election, 1923|1923 general elections]] Russell stood as a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] candidate in the [[Chelsea (UK Parliament constituency)|Chelsea constituency]], but only on the basis that he knew he was extremely unlikely to be elected in such a safe Conservative seat, and he was not on either occasion.

Together with Dora, Russell founded the experimental Beacon Hill School in 1927. The school was run from a succession of different locations, including its original premises at the Russells' residence, Telegraph House, near [[Harting]], West Sussex. On 8 July 1930 Dora gave birth to her third child Harriet Ruth. After he left the school in 1932, Dora continued it until 1943.&lt;ref name="Beacon"&gt;Inside Beacon Hill: Bertrand Russell as Schoolmaster.

On a tour through the US in 1927 Russell met Barry Fox (later [[Barry Stevens (therapist)|Barry Stevens]]) who became a well-known [[Gestalt therapy|Gestalt therapist]] and writer in later years.&lt;ref&gt;Kranz, D. (2011): [http://www.gestalt.de/kranz_stevens_leben.html Barry Stevens: Leben Gestalten]. In: Gestaltkritik, 2/2011, p.&amp;nbsp;4-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Russell and Fox developed an intensive relationship. In Fox's words: "... for three years we were very close."&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, B. (1970): Don't Push the River. Lafayette, Cal. (Real People Press), p.&amp;nbsp;26.&lt;/ref&gt; Fox sent her daughter Judith to Beacon Hill School for some time.&lt;ref&gt;Gorham, D.

(1981): Recent Acquisitions: Correspondence, in: Russell: the Journal of Bertrand Russell Studies, Vol 1, Iss. 1, Article 6,  43 â 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon the death of his elder brother Frank, in 1931, Russell became the 3rd Earl Russell.

Russell's marriage to Dora grew increasingly tenuous, and it reached a breaking point over her having two children with an American journalist, Griffin Barry.&lt;ref name="Dora"/&gt; They separated in 1932 and finally divorced. On 18 January 1936, Russell married his third wife, an [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] undergraduate named [[Patricia Russell (nee Spence)|Patricia ("Peter") Spence]], who had been his children's governess since 1930. Russell and Peter had one son, [[Conrad Russell, 5th Earl Russell|Conrad Sebastian Robert Russell]], 5th Earl Russell, who became a prominent historian and one of the leading figures in the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] party.&lt;ref name="Gallery"/&gt;

Russell returned to the [[London School of Economics]] to lecture on the science of power in 1937.&lt;ref name="LSE" /&gt;

During the 1930s, Russell became a close friend and collaborator of [[V. K. Krishna Menon]], then secretary of the India League, the foremost lobby in the United Kingdom for Indian self-rule.{{vague|date=July 2014|reason= was Menon *at that point* AIML sec'y, or was it BR who *later* became sec'y?}}

===Second World War===
Russell opposed rearmament against [[Nazi Germany]]. In 1937 he wrote in a personal letter: "If the Germans succeed in sending an invading army to England we should do best to treat them as visitors, give them quarters and invite the commander and chief to dine with the prime minister."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2014/02/19/museum-of-tolerance-acquires-bertrand-russells-nazi-appeasement-letter/ |title=Museum Of Tolerance Acquires Bertrand Russellâs Nazi Appeasement Letter |website=Losangeles.cbslocal.com |date=2014-02-19 |accessdate=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940, he changed his view that avoiding a full-scale world war was more important than defeating Hitler. He concluded that Adolf Hitler taking over all of Europe would be a permanent threat to democracy. In 1943, he adopted a stance toward large-scale warfare: "War was always a great evil, but in some particularly extreme circumstances, it may be the lesser of two evils."&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Bertrand, "The Future of Pacifism", The American Scholar, (1943) 13: 7â13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote=I found the Nazis utterly revolting â cruel, bigoted, and stupid.

I found this possibility unbearable, and at last consciously and definitely decided that I must support what was necessary for victory in the Second War, however difficult victory might be to achieve, and however painful in its consequences|title=Autobiography|chapter=12: Later Years of Telegraph House|isbn=9780415189859|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SlMrmmrNuEoC|author=Bertrand Russell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before World War II, Russell taught at the [[University of Chicago]], later moving on to Los Angeles to lecture at the [[UCLA Department of Philosophy]]. He was appointed professor at the [[City College of New York]] (CCNY) in 1940, but after a public outcry the appointment was annulled by a court judgment that pronounced him "morally unfit" to teach at the college due to his opinions, especially those relating to [[sexual morality]], detailed in ''[[Marriage and Morals]]'' (1929). The matter was however taken to the [[New York Supreme Court]] by [[Jean Kay]] who was afraid that her daughter would be harmed by the appointment, though her daughter was not a student at CCNY.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = McCarthy | first = Joseph M. | title = The Russell Case: Academic Freedom vs. Public Hysteria | publisher = Educational Resources Information Center | date = May 1993 | pages = 9 | language = English | url = http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED363185.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many intellectuals, led by [[John Dewey]], protested at his treatment.&lt;ref name="Denied"&gt;{{cite news|title=Appointment Denied: The Inquisition of Bertrand Russell|author=Leberstein, Stephen|url=http://www.omnilogos.com/2015/01/appointment-denied-inquisition-of.html|publisher=Academe|date=NovemberâDecember 2001|accessdate=17 February 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150123221826/http://www.omnilogos.com/2015/01/appointment-denied-inquisition-of.html|archive-date=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albert Einstein]]'s oft-quoted aphorism that "great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds" originated in his open letter, dated 19 March 1940, to [[Morris Raphael Cohen]], a professor emeritus at CCNY, supporting Russell's appointment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asl-associates.com/einsteinquotes.htm Einstein quotations and sources.]. Retrieved 9 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Dewey and [[Horace M. Kallen]] edited a collection of articles on the CCNY affair in ''[[The Bertrand Russell Case]]''. Russell soon joined the [[Barnes Foundation]], lecturing to a varied audience on the history of philosophy; these lectures formed the basis of ''[[A History of Western Philosophy]]''. His relationship with the eccentric [[Albert C. Barnes]] soon soured, and he returned to the UK in 1944 to rejoin the faculty of Trinity College.&lt;ref name="professor"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bertrand Russell |url=http://www.philosophyprofessor.com/philosophers/bertrand-russell.php |year=2006 |accessdate=17 February 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212100048/http://www.philosophyprofessor.com/philosophers/bertrand-russell.php |archivedate=12 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later life===

Russell participated in many broadcasts over the BBC, particularly ''[[The Brains Trust]]'' and the [[BBC Third Programme|Third Programme]], on various topical and philosophical subjects. By this time Russell was world-famous outside academic circles, frequently the subject or author of magazine and newspaper articles, and was called upon to offer opinions on a wide variety of subjects, even mundane ones. En route to one of his lectures in [[Trondheim]], Russell was one of 24 survivors (among a total of 43 passengers) of an [[Bukken Bruse disaster|aeroplane crash in Hommelvik]] in October 1948. He said he owed his life to smoking since the people who drowned were in the non-smoking part of the plane.&lt;ref name="letters"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Selected Letters of Bertrand Russell|page=660|publisher=Routledge|author=Griffin, Nicholas (ed.)|year=2002|isbn=0-415-26012-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Autobiography|page=512|isbn=9780415189859|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SlMrmmrNuEoC|author=Bertrand Russell}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[A History of Western Philosophy]]'' (1945) became a best-seller and provided Russell with a steady income for the remainder of his life.

In 1942 Russell argued in favour of a moderate socialism, capable of overcoming its metaphysical principles, in an inquiry on [[dialectical materialism]], launched by the Austrian artist and philosopher [[Wolfgang Paalen]] in his journal ''[[DYN (magazine)|DYN]]'', saying "I think the metaphysics of both [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] and [[Karl Marx|Marx]] plain nonsense â Marx's claim to be 'science' is no more justified than [[Mary Baker Eddy]]'s. This does not mean that I am opposed to socialism."&lt;ref&gt;Russell to Edward Renouf, assistant of [[Wolfgang Paalen]], 23 March 1942 (Succession Wolfgang Paalen, Berlin); this letter is cited in ''DYN'', No. 2, Mexico, JulyâAugust 1942, p.&amp;nbsp;52&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943, Russell expressed support for [[Zionism]]: "I have come gradually to see that, in a dangerous and largely hostile world, it is essential to [[Jews]] to have some country which is theirs, some region where they are not suspected aliens, some state which embodies what is distinctive in their culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Quote/Russell_On_Zionism.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304040128/https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Quote/Russell_On_Zionism.html |archivedate=4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a speech in 1948, Russell said that if the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]'s aggression continued, it would be morally worse to go to war after the USSR possessed an [[Nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]] than before it possessed one, because if the USSR had no bomb the West's victory would come more swiftly and with fewer casualties than if there were atom bombs on both sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plymouth.edu/department/history-philosophy/files/2012/10/Bertrand-Russell-and-Preventive-War.pdf |title=Bertrand Russell and Preventive War |format=PDF |website=Plymouth.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/books/PrinterFriendly.cfm?Story_ID=699582|work=The Economist|title=A philosopher's letters&amp;nbsp;â Love, Bertie | date=21 July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, only the United States possessed an atomic bomb, and the USSR was pursuing an extremely aggressive policy towards the countries in Eastern Europe which were being absorbed into the Soviet Union's [[sphere of influence]]. Many understood Russell's comments to mean that Russell approved of a [[first strike]] in a war with the USSR, including [[Nigel Lawson]], who was present when Russell spoke of such matters. Others, including Griffin, who obtained a transcript of the speech, have argued that he was merely explaining the usefulness of America's atomic arsenal in deterring the USSR from continuing its domination of Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name="letters" /&gt;
However, just after the atomic bombs exploded over [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]], Russell wrote letters, and published articles in newspapers from 1945 to 1948, stating clearly that it was morally justified and better to go to war against the USSR using atomic bombs while the United States possessed them and before the USSR did. In September 1949, one week after the USSR tested its first A-bomb, but before this became known, Russell wrote that USSR would be unable to develop nuclear weapons because following Stalin's purges only science based on Marxist principles would be practiced in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;He wrote: "There is reason to think Stalin will insist on a new orthodoxy in atomic physics, since there is much in quantum theory that runs contrary to Communist dogma. An atomic bomb' made on Marxist principles would probably not explode because, after all, Marxist science was that of a hundred years ago. For those who fear the military power of Russia there is, therefore, some reason to rejoice in the muzzling of Russian science."

In 1948, Russell was invited by the BBC to deliver the inaugural [[Reith Lectures]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=â06:04|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00729d9|title=Radio 4 Programmes â The Reith Lectures|publisher=BBC|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;âwhat was to become an annual series of lectures, still broadcast by the BBC. His series of six broadcasts, titled ''Authority and the Individual'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=â06:04|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00h9lz3|title=Radio 4 Programmes â The Reith Lectures: Bertrand Russell: Authority and the Individual: 1948|publisher=BBC|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; explored themes such as the role of individual initiative in the development of a community and the role of state control in a progressive society. Russell continued to write about philosophy. He wrote a foreword to ''Words and Things'' by [[Ernest Gellner]], which was highly critical of the later thought of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and of [[ordinary language philosophy]]. [[Gilbert Ryle]] refused to have the book reviewed in the philosophical journal ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'', which caused Russell to respond via ''[[The Times]]''. The result was a month-long correspondence in ''The Times'' between the supporters and detractors of ordinary language philosophy, which was only ended when the paper published an editorial critical of both sides but agreeing with the opponents of ordinary language philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;T. P. Uschanov, [http://www.helsinki.fi/~tuschano/writings/strange/ The Strange Death of Ordinary Language Philosophy]. The controversy has been described by the writer [[Ved Mehta]] in ''Fly and the Fly Bottle'' (1963).&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the [[King's Birthday Honours]] of 9 June 1949, Russell was awarded the [[Order of Merit (Commonwealth)|Order of Merit]],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=38628 |supp=y|page=2796|date=3 June 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the following year he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].&lt;ref name="Gallery"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nobel prize"/&gt; When he was given the Order of Merit, [[George VI]] was affable but slightly embarrassed at decorating a former jailbird, saying, "You have sometimes behaved in a manner that would not do if generally adopted".&lt;ref&gt;Ronald W. Clark, Bertrand Russell and His World, p.&amp;nbsp;94. (1981) {{isbn|0-500-13070-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russell merely smiled, but afterwards claimed that the reply "That's right, just like your [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|brother]]" immediately came to mind. In 1952 Russell was divorced by Spence, with whom he had been very unhappy. Conrad, Russell's son by Spence, did not see his father between the time of the divorce and 1968 (at which time his decision to meet his father caused a permanent breach with his mother).

In 1950, Russell attended the inaugural conference for the [[Congress for Cultural Freedom]], a [[C.I.A.]]-funded anti-communist organization committed to the deployment of culture as a weapon during the [[Cold War]]&lt;ref&gt;Frances Stonor Saunders, "The Cultural Cold War: The CIA and the World of Arts and Letters." New York Press, 1999. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;. Russell was one of the best known patrons of the Congress, until he resigned in 1956&lt;ref&gt; Frances Stonor Saunder, ""The Cultural Cold War: The CIA And the World of Arts and Letters." New York Press, 1999. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Russell married his fourth wife, [[Edith Finch Russell|Edith Finch]], soon after the divorce, on 15 December 1952. They had known each other since 1925, and Edith had taught English at Bryn Mawr College near Philadelphia, sharing a house for 20 years with Russell's old friend [[Lucy Donnelly]]. Edith remained with him until his death, and, by all accounts, their marriage was a happy, close, and loving one. Russell's eldest son John suffered from serious [[mental illness]], which was the source of ongoing disputes between Russell and his former wife Dora.

In September 1961, at the age of 89, Russell was jailed for seven days in [[HM Prison Brixton|Brixton Prison]] for "breach of peace" after taking part in [[Committee of 100 (United Kingdom)#1961|an anti-nuclear demonstration]] in London. The magistrate offered to exempt him from jail if he pledged himself to "good behaviour", to which Russell replied: "No, I won't."&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation, ''Bertrand Russell, 1872â1970'' [1970], p.&amp;nbsp;12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell, Vol. 3|page=157|publisher=Little, Brown|author=Russell, Bertrand|year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962 Russell played a public role in the [[Cuban Missile Crisis#Crisis deepens|Cuban Missile Crisis]]: in an exchange of telegrams with Soviet leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]], Khrushchev assured him that the Soviet government would not be reckless.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|title=World Peace Efforts Since Gandhi|author=Sanderson Beck|accessdate=24 June 2012|url=http://www.san.beck.org/GPJ24-Russell,Muste.html|chapter=Pacifism of Bertrand Russell and A. J. Muste|publisher=Sanderson Beck|year=2003â2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russell sent this telegram to [[John F. Kennedy|President Kennedy]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;YOUR ACTION DESPERATE. THREAT TO HUMAN SURVIVAL. NO CONCEIVABLE JUSTIFICATION. CIVILIZED MAN CONDEMNS IT. WE WILL NOT HAVE MASS MURDER. ULTIMATUM MEANS WAR... END THIS MADNESS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Kennedys: Dynasty and Disaster|author=John H. Davis|publisher=S. P. Books|page=437}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to historian Peter Knight, after JFK's [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassination]], Russell, "prompted by the emerging work of the lawyer [[Mark Lane (author)|Mark Lane]] in the US ... rallied support from other noteworthy and left-leaning compatriots to form a Who Killed Kennedy Committee in June 1964, members of which included [[Michael Foot]] MP, [[Caroline Benn]], the publisher [[Victor Gollancz]], the writers [[John Arden]] and [[J. B. Priestley]], and the Oxford history professor [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]]." Russell published a highly critical article weeks before the [[Warren Commission]] Report was published, setting forth ''16 Questions on the Assassination'' and equating the Oswald case with the [[Dreyfus affair]] of late 19th-century France, in which the state wrongly convicted an innocent man. Russell also criticised the American press for failing to heed any voices critical of the official version.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Knight, ''The Kennedy Assassination'', Edinburgh University Press Ltd., 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;77.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political causes===
[[File:Bertrand Russell leads anti-nuclear march in London, Feb 1961.jpg|thumb|left|Russell (centre) alongside his wife Edith, leading a [[CND]] anti-nuclear march in London, 18 February 1961]]
Bertrand Russell was opposed to war from early on, his opposition to World War I being used as grounds for his dismissal from Trinity College at Cambridge. This incident fused two of his most controversial causes, as he had failed to be granted Fellow status, which would have protected him from firing, because he was not willing to either pretend to be a devout Christian, or at least avoid admitting he was agnostic.

He later described the resolution of these issues as essential to freedom of thought and expression, citing the incident in [[Free Thought and Official Propaganda]], where he explained that the expression of any idea, even the most obviously "bad", must be protected not only from direct State intervention, but also economic leveraging and other means of being silenced:

{{quote|The opinions which are still persecuted strike the majority as so monstrous and immoral that the general principle of toleration cannot be held to apply to them.

But this is exactly the same view as that which made possible the tortures of the Inquisition.&lt;ref name="free"&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/44932/44932-h/44932-h.htm Free Thought and Official Propaganda]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Russell spent the 1950s and 1960s engaged in political causes primarily related to [[nuclear disarmament]] and opposing the [[Vietnam War]]. The 1955 [[RussellâEinstein Manifesto]] was a document calling for nuclear disarmament and was signed by eleven of the most prominent nuclear physicists and intellectuals of the time.&lt;ref name="Manifesto"&gt;{{cite web|title=Russell Einstein Manifesto|url=http://www.ppu.org.uk/learn/texts/doc_russelleinstein_manif.html|author=Russell, Bertrand|author2=[[Albert Einstein]] |date=9 July 1955|accessdate=17 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966â1967, Russell worked with [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and many other intellectual figures to form the [[Russell Tribunal|Russell Vietnam War Crimes Tribunal]] to investigate the conduct of the United States in Vietnam.  He wrote a great many letters to world leaders during this period.

In 1956, immediately before and during the [[Suez Crisis]], Russell expressed his opposition to European imperialism in the Middle East. He viewed the crisis as another reminder of the  pressing need for a more effective mechanism for international governance, and to restrict national sovereignty to places such as the [[Suez Canal]] area "where general interest is involved". At the same time the Suez Crisis was taking place, the world was also captivated by the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]] and the subsequent crushing of the revolt by intervening Soviet forces. Russell attracted criticism for speaking out fervently against the Suez war while ignoring Soviet repression in Hungary, to which he responded that he did not criticise the Soviets "because there was no need. Most of the so-called Western World was fulminating". Although he later feigned a lack of concern, at the time he was disgusted by the brutal Soviet response, and on 16 November 1956, he expressed approval for a declaration of support for Hungarian scholars which [[Michael Polanyi]] had cabled to the Soviet embassy in London twelve days previously, shortly after Soviet troops had already entered Budapest.&lt;ref&gt;''Collected Papers of Bertrand Russell'' (Psychology Press, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1957 Russell wrote an article addressing US President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]], urging a summit to consider "the conditions of co-existence". Khrushchev responded that peace could indeed be served by such a meeting. In January 1958 Russell elaborated his views in ''[[The Observer]]'', proposing a cessation of all nuclear-weapons production, with the UK taking the first step by unilaterally suspending its own nuclear-weapons program if necessary, and with Germany "freed from all alien armed forces and pledged to neutrality in any conflict between East and West". US Secretary of State [[John Foster Dulles]] replied for Eisenhower. The exchange of letters was published as ''The Vital Letters of Russell, Khrushchev, and Dulles''.&lt;ref name=ref1&gt;''Yours Faithfully, Bertrand Russell'' (pp. 212â213)&lt;/ref&gt;

Russell was asked by ''[[The New Republic]]'', a liberal American magazine, to elaborate his views on world peace. He urged that all nuclear-weapons testing and constant flights by planes armed with nuclear weapons be halted immediately, and negotiations be opened for the destruction of all [[Thermonuclear weapon|hydrogen bombs]], with the number of conventional nuclear devices limited to ensure a balance of power. He proposed that Germany be reunified and accept the [[Oder-Neisse line]] as its border, and that a neutral zone be established in Central Europe, consisting at the minimum of Germany, Poland, [[Hungary]], and [[Czechoslovakia]], with each of these countries being free of foreign troops and influence, and prohibited from forming alliances with countries outside the zone. In the Middle East, Russell suggested that the West avoid opposing [[Arab nationalism]], and proposed the creation of a United Nations peacekeeping force to guard Israel's frontiers to ensure that Israel was prevented from committing aggression and protected from it. He also suggested Western recognition of the [[China|People's Republic of China]], and that it be admitted to the UN with a permanent seat on the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]].&lt;ref name=ref1/&gt;

He was in contact with [[Lionel Rogosin]] while the latter was filming his anti-war film ''[[Good Times, Wonderful Times]]'' in the 1960s. He became a hero to many of the youthful members of the [[New Left]]. In early 1963, in particular, Russell became increasingly vocal in his disapproval of the [[Vietnam War]], and felt that the US government's policies there were near-[[genocide|genocidal]]. In 1963 he became the inaugural recipient of the [[Jerusalem Prize]], an award for writers concerned with the freedom of the individual in society.&lt;ref name="jerusalem prize"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jerusalembookfair.com/main.html|title=Jerusalem International Book Fair|publisher=Jerusalembookfair.com|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964 he was one of eleven world figures who issued an appeal to Israel and the [[Arab world|Arab countries]] to accept an [[arms embargo]] and international supervision of nuclear plants and rocket weaponry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/1964/02/26/archive/bertrand-russell-appeals-to-arabs-and-israel-on-rocket-weapons|title=Bertrand Russell Appeals to Arabs and Israel on Rocket Weapons|work=Jewish Telegraphic Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1965 he tore up his [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] card because he suspected [[Harold Wilson]]'s Labour government was going to send troops to support the United States in Vietnam.&lt;ref name="Gallery"/&gt;

===Final years and death===
In June 1955 Russell had leased Plas Penrhyn in [[Penrhyndeudraeth]], Merionethshire, Wales and on 5 July of the following year it became his and Edith's principal residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Andrew G.

[[File:Bust Of Bertrand Russell-Red Lion Square-London.jpg|thumb|Bust of Russell in [[Red Lion Square]]]]
Russell published his three-volume autobiography in 1967, 1968, and 1969. Russell made a [[cameo appearance]] playing himself in the anti-war [[Hindi]] film [[Aman (film)|''Aman'']], by [[Mohan Kumar]], which was released in India in 1967. This was Russell's only appearance in a feature film.&lt;ref name="Bertrand Russell in Bollywood"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0233193/|title=Aman (1967)|publisher=Internet Movie Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 November 1969 he wrote to ''The Times'' newspaper saying that the preparation for show trials in [[Czechoslovakia]] was "highly alarming". The same month, he appealed to Secretary General [[U Thant]] of the United Nations to support an international war crimes commission to investigate alleged torture and genocide by the United States in [[South Vietnam]] during the [[Vietnam War]]. The following month, he protested to [[Alexei Kosygin]] over the expulsion of [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] from the [[Soviet Union of Writers]].

On 31 January 1970 Russell issued a statement condemning "Israel's aggression in the Middle East", and in particular, Israeli bombing raids being carried out deep in Egyptian territory as part of the [[War of Attrition]]. He called for an Israeli withdrawal to the pre-[[Six-Day War]] borders. This was Russell's final political statement or act. It was read out at the International Conference of Parliamentarians in [[Cairo]] on 3 February 1970, the day after his death.&lt;ref name="Last Message"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.connexions.org/CxLibrary/Docs/CX5576-RussellMidEast.htm |title=Bertrand Russell's Last Message |website=Connexions.org |date=1970-01-31 |accessdate=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russell died of [[influenza]] on 2 February 1970 at his home in Penrhyndeudraeth. His body was cremated in [[Colwyn Bay]] on 5 February 1970. In accordance with his will, there was no religious ceremony; his ashes were scattered over the Welsh mountains later that year. He left an estate valued at Â£69,423 (Â£1.09 million or US$1.4 million in 2018 money).&lt;ref&gt;[https://probatesearch.service.gov.uk/Calendar?surname=Russell&amp;yearOfDeath=1970&amp;page=3#calendar Russell, 1970, p.&amp;nbsp;3] at probatesearch.service.gov.uk. Retrieved 29 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1980 a memorial to Russell was commissioned by a committee including the philosopher [[A. J. Ayer]]. It consists of a bust of Russell in [[Red Lion Square]] in London sculpted by Marcelle Quinton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Bertrand Russell Memorial|journal=Mind|year=1980|volume=353|page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views==
{{Infobox Bertrand Russell}}

===Philosophy===
{{Main|Bertrand Russell's philosophical views}}
Russell is generally credited with being one of the founders of [[analytic philosophy]]. He was deeply impressed by [[Gottfried Leibniz]] (1646â1716), and wrote on every major area of philosophy except [[aesthetics]]. He was particularly prolific in the field of [[metaphysics]], the [[Bertrand Russell's views on philosophy#Logic and philosophy of mathematics|logic and the philosophy of mathematics]], the [[Bertrand Russell's views on philosophy#Philosophy of language|philosophy of language]], [[Bertrand Russell's views on philosophy#Ethics|ethics]] and [[Bertrand Russell's views on philosophy#Epistemology|epistemology]]. When [[Brand Blanshard]] asked Russell why he did not write on aesthetics, Russell replied that he did not know anything about it, "but that is not a very good excuse, for my friends tell me it has not deterred me from writing on other subjects".&lt;ref&gt;Blanshard, in [[Paul Arthur Schilpp]], ed., ''The Philosophy of Brand Blanshard'', Open Court, 1980, p.&amp;nbsp;88, quoting a private letter from Russell.&lt;/ref&gt;

On ethics, Russell considered himself a [[utilitarian]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell'', London: Routledge, 2000 [London: Allen and Unwin, 1969, Vol. 1], p.&amp;nbsp;39 ("It appeared to me obvious that the happiness of mankind should be the aim of all action, and I discovered to my surprise that there were those who thought otherwise. Belief in happiness, I found, was called Utilitarianism, and was merely one among a number of ethical theories. I adhered to it after this discovery.").&lt;/ref&gt;

For the advancement of science ''and'' protection of the right to freedom of expression, Russell advocated [[The Will to Doubt]], the recognition that all human knowledge is at most a best guess, that one should always remember:

{{quote|''None of our beliefs are quite true; all have at least a penumbra of vagueness and error''. The methods of increasing the degree of truth in our beliefs are well known; they consist in hearing all sides, trying to ascertain all the relevant facts, controlling our own bias by discussion with people who have the opposite bias, and cultivating a readiness to discard any hypothesis which has proved inadequate. These methods are practised in science, and have built up the body of scientific knowledge.

''Every man of science whose outlook is truly scientific is ready to admit that what passes for scientific knowledge at the moment is sure to require correction with the progress of discovery; nevertheless, it is near enough to the truth to serve for most practical purposes, though not for all. In science, where alone something approximating to genuine knowledge is to be found, menâs attitude is tentative and full of doubt''.}}

===Religion===
Russell described himself in 1947 as an [[Agnosticism|agnostic]], saying: "Therefore, in regard to the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympic gods]], speaking to a purely philosophical audience, I would say that I am an Agnostic. But speaking popularly, I think that all of us would say in regard to those gods that we were Atheists. In regard to the [[God in Christianity|Christian God]], I should, I think, take exactly the same line."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/russell8.htm |title=Am I An Atheist or an Agnostic? |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |year=1947 |work=Encyclopedia of Things |accessdate=6 July 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050622001026/http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/russell8.htm |archivedate=22 June 2005 |df=dmy }}: "I never know whether I should say "Agnostic" or whether I should say "Atheist"... As a philosopher, if I were speaking to a purely philosophic audience I should say that I ought to describe myself as an Agnostic, because I do not think that there is a conclusive argument by which one prove (sic) that there is not a God. On the other hand, if I am to convey the right impression to the ordinary man in the street I think I ought to say that I am an Atheist..."&lt;/ref&gt; For most of his adult life, Russell maintained religion to be little more than [[superstition]] and, in spite of any positive effects, largely harmful to people. He believed that religion and the religious outlook serve to impede knowledge and foster fear and dependency, and to be responsible for much of our world's wars, oppression, and misery. He was a member of the Advisory Council of the [[British Humanist Association]] and President of Cardiff Humanists until his death.&lt;ref&gt;'Humanist News', March 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

===Society===
{{Main|Bertrand Russell's views on society}}
Political and social activism occupied much of Russell's time for most of his life. Russell remained politically active almost to the end of his life, writing to and exhorting world leaders and lending his name to various causes.

Russell argued for a "scientific society", where war would be abolished, population growth would be limited, and prosperity would be shared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Impact of Science on Society|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|chapter=Conclusions|year=1952}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested the establishment of a "single supreme world government" able to enforce peace,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Which Way to Peace? ''(Part 12)''|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|page=173|publisher=M. Joseph Ltd.|year=1936}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that "the only thing that will redeem mankind is co-operation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Human Society in Ethics and Politics|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|page=212|publisher=London: G. Allen &amp; Unwin|year=1954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russell was an active supporter of the [[Homosexual Law Reform Society]], being one of the signatories of [[A. E. Dyson]]'s 1958 letter to ''The Times'' calling for a change in the law regarding male homosexual practices, which were partly legalised in 1967, when Russell was still alive.&lt;ref name="GALHA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lesbian and Gay Rights: The Humanist and Religious Stances|url=http://www.galha.org/briefing/lgb_rights.html|author=Gay and Lesbian Humanist Association|date=2 November 1997|accessdate=17 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Reflections on My Eightieth Birthday" ("Postscript" in his ''Autobiography''), Russell wrote: "I have lived in the pursuit of a vision, both personal and social. Personal: to care for what is noble, for what is beautiful, for what is gentle; to allow moments of insight to give wisdom at more mundane times. Social: to see in imagination the society that is to be created, where individuals grow freely, and where hate and greed and envy die because there is nothing to nourish them. These things I believe, and the world, for all its horrors, has left me unshaken".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell: 1944â1969|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|page=330|publisher=Little, Brown|year=1968}} Published separately as 'Reflections on My Eightieth Birthday' in ''Portraits from Memory''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Russell was the author of more than sixty books and over two thousand articles.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Pigden in Bertrand Russell, ''Russell on Ethics: Selections from the Writings of Bertrand Russell'', Routledge (2013), p.&amp;nbsp;14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James C. Klagge, ''Wittgenstein: Biography and Philosophy'', Cambridge University Press (2001), p.&amp;nbsp;12&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, he wrote many pamphlets, introductions, and letters to the editor. One pamphlet titled, '''I Appeal unto Caesar': The Case of the Conscientious Objectors'', ghostwritten for Margaret Hobhouse, the mother of imprisoned peace activist [[Stephen Hobhouse]], allegedly helped secure the release from prison of hundreds of [[conscientious objector]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hochschild |first=Adam |title=To end all wars: a story of loyalty and rebellion, 1914â1918 |pages=270â272 |location=Boston |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |year=2011 |isbn=0-618-75828-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His works can be found in anthologies and collections, including ''The Collected Papers of Bertrand Russell'', which [[McMaster University]] began publishing in 1983. By March 2017 this collection of his shorter and previously unpublished works included 18 volumes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://russell.mcmaster.ca/brworks.htm |title=McMaster University: The Bertrand Russell Research Centre |website=Russell.mcmaster.ca |date=2017-03-06 |accessdate=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several more are in progress. A bibliography in three additional volumes catalogues his publications. The Russell Archives held by McMaster's [[William Ready Division of Archives and Research Collections]] possess over 40,000 of his letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bertrand Russell Archives Catalogue Entry and Research System|url=https://bracers.mcmaster.ca/|website=McMaster University Library|publisher=The William Ready Division of Archives and Research Collections|accessdate=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Black Girls Code at GEM-TECH 2015 awards.jpg|thumb|right|A Black Girls Code booth at the 2015 GEM-TECH awards organized by [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]].]]

'''Black Girls Code''' ('''BGC''') is a not-for-profit organization that focuses on providing technology education for [[African-American]] girls. [[Kimberly Bryant (technologist)|Kimberly Bryant]], an [[electrical engineer]] who had worked in [[biotech]] for over 20 years, founded Black Girls Code in 2011 to rectify the underrepresentation of female African-Americans in the technology industry.&lt;ref name="Robehmed"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/natalierobehmed/2013/08/30/black-girls-code-tackles-tech-inclusion/|title=Black Girls Code Tackles Tech Inclusion|last=Robehmed|first=Natalie|date=August 30, 2013|work=[[Forbes]]|accessdate=April 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilpin" /&gt; The organization offers programs in computer programming, coding, as well as website, robot, and mobile application-building, with the goal of providing African-American youth with the skills to occupy some of the 1.4 million computing job openings expected to be available in the U.S. in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncwit.org/sites/default/files/resources/btn_02272013web.pdf |title=By the Numbers |website=www.ncwit.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding==
Bryant was inspired to start BGC after her [[gamer]] daughter, Kai, attended a computing summer camp and was disappointed in the experience.&lt;ref name="Gilpin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techrepublic.com/article/black-girls-code-founder-kimberly-bryant-engineer-entrepreneur-mother/#.|title=Black Girls Code founder Kimberly Bryant: Engineer.

She also noted that the boys at the camp were given much more attention from the counselors than the few girls there.&lt;ref name="Gilpin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SFNews" /&gt; In an interview with [[Ebony (magazine)|''Ebony'']], Bryant stated, "I wanted to find a way to engage and interest my daughter in becoming a [[digital creative]] instead of just a consumer, and I did not find other programs that were targeted to girls like her from underrepresented communities."&lt;ref name="Phanor-Faury"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebony.com/life/black-girls-code-founder-kim-bryant-talks-333#axzz2z0qE3OOB|title=Black Girls Codeâs Kim Bryant Talks Bits and Bytes|last=Phanor-Faury|first=Alexandra|date=March 19, 2014|work=[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]|accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
BGC has become a rapidly growing phenomenon, quickly expanding in the USA and abroad. Headquartered in [[Bayview-Hunters Point, San Francisco]], the organization grew to 2,000 students by August 2013 within the 7 established institutions &lt;ref name="Robehmed" /&gt; operating in 7 States across the US, as well as in [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name="Ntim"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lottie-ntim/when-black-girls-code_b_4427516.html|title=When Black Girls Code|last=Ntim|first=Lottie|date=December 12, 2013|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=April 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; BGC seeks to double their reach by adding chapters in the US and Africa over the next two years.&lt;ref name="D'Ignazio"&gt;{{cite web | last=D'Ignazio |first=Catherine |title=Kimberly Bryant and Black Girls Code | date=November 18, 2013|work=MIT Center for Civic Media| accessdate=November 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; BGC also hosts bilingual workshops in partnership with Latino Startup Alliance.&lt;ref name="Gilpin" /&gt; BGC's ultimate goal is "to grow to train 1 million girls by 2050 and become the 'girl scouts' of technology." &lt;ref name="D'Ignazio" /&gt; 

BGC depends on a vast body of [[volunteering|volunteers]] to design and conduct workshop classes. Professionals from the IT sector share their expertise with the young students, helping them get acquainted with the fundamentals of software design in languages such as [[Scratch (programming language)|Scratch]] or [[Ruby on Rails]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackgirlscode.com/what-we-do.html|title=What We Do|website=Black Girls CodeÂ Â  imagine. build. create.}}&lt;/ref&gt; After school activities are alternated with day-long workshops; an extended course is held during the summer. 

BGC primarily relies on donations to fund its activities; 75% students are currently on scholarships.&lt;ref name="Robehmed" /&gt; 

The motto of the Black Girls Code is: "Imagine. Build. Create. â Imagine a world where everyone is given the tools to succeed, and then help us build ways for everyone to access information and create a new age of women of color in technology".&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;

==Awards and grants==
Black Girls Code received a $50,000 grant from [[Microsoft Azure|Microsoft's Azure development]] (AzureDev) community campaign in January 2014.&lt;ref name="Frank"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geekwire.com/2014/black-girls-code-code-org-among-named-azuredev-grant-winners/|title=Black Girls Code, Code.org win Microsoft AzureDev grants|last=Frank|first=Blair Hanley|date=January 15, 2014|work=[[Geekwire]]|accessdate=April 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Black Girls Code founder Kimberly Bryant also received a "Standing O-vation" presented by [[Oprah Winfrey]] and Toyota in November 2014.&lt;ref name="SFNews"&gt;{{cite news| last=Shumaker | first=Laura|title=Oprah gives San Franciscoâs Kimberly Bryant a Standing O-vation| journal=SFGate| year=2014|url=http://blog.sfgate.com/lshumaker/2014/11/17/oprah-gives-san-franciscos-kimberly-bryant-a-standing-o-vation/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''casebook''' is a type of [[textbook]] used primarily by students in [[law school]]s.&lt;ref name="ah83"&gt;Wayne L. Anderson and Marilyn J. Headrick, ''The Legal Profession: Is it for you?'' (Cincinnati: Thomson Executive Press, 1996), 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than simply laying out the [[legal doctrine]] in a particular area of study, a casebook contains excerpts from [[legal case]]s in which the law of that area was applied.&lt;ref name="ah83" /&gt; It is then up to the student to analyze the language of the case in order to determine what rule was applied and how the [[court]] applied it.&lt;ref name="ah83" /&gt;  Casebooks sometimes also contain excerpts from [[law review]] articles and [[legal treatise]]s,  historical notes, editorial commentary, and other related materials to provide background for the cases.

The teaching style based on casebooks is known as the [[casebook method]] and is supposed to instill in law students how to "think like a [[lawyer]]."&lt;ref name="ah83" /&gt; The casebook method is most often used in law schools in countries with [[common law]] [[legal systems of the world|legal systems]], where [[case law]] is a major [[source of law]].

Most casebooks are authored by law [[professors]], usually with two, three, or four authors, at least one of whom will be a professor at the top of his or her field in the area under discussion. New editions of casebooks often retain the names of famous professors on their covers decades after those professors have died. Updating of the books, then, falls on the shoulders of a younger generation of their colleagues. Such casebooks are often known by the names of the leading professor authors, such as [[William Prosser (academic)|Prosser]], Wade, &amp; Schwartz's, ''[[Torts]]: Cases &amp; Materials'' (now in a 13th edition).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The leading publishers of casebooks in the United States are [[Thomson West]] (publisher of the Foundation Press and American Casebook Series imprints), [[Aspen Publishing]], and [[LexisNexis]]. Each of these publishers uses a quickly identifiable color and pattern for their book covers across all subjects.  Traditionally, the covers of casebooks come in the colors red, blue, or brown,&lt;ref name="ah83" /&gt; although West's American Casebook Series has switched to faded black cloth as an environmental move.

The prevalence of the casebook method in American law schools has given rise to a market for commercial study aids "keyed" to a particular casebook edition.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, 84.&lt;/ref&gt; These study aids are generally summaries ("[[Brief (law)|briefs]]") of the cases from the casebook to which it is "keyed," presenting them in the same order as the casebook. Often written by the same author who wrote the associated casebook, and published by the same company, "keyed" study aids are useful in distilling cases down to [[Black letter law|black-letter law]]. Popular study aid product lines include Legalines, High Court Case Summaries, and Gilbert Law Summaries published by West Thomson Reuters, Casenotes Legal Briefs by Aspen, and the Understanding series and Q&amp;A series by LexisNexis.

'''Chironomia''' is the art of using gesticulations or hand gestures to good effect in traditional [[rhetoric]] or [[Eloquence|oratory]].   Effective use of the hands, with or without the use of the voice, is a practice of great antiquity, which was developed and systematized by the Greeks and the Romans.  Various gestures had conventionalized meanings which were commonly understood, either within certain class or professional groups, or broadly among dramatic and oratorical audiences.

[[Gilbert Austin]] was a well-known author on chironomia. The article about him contains a summary of theories in chironomia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2621">'''Christian comedy''' is a subgenre of [[comedy]] where the material presented is aimed towards a Christian audience. The performances are typically held on church grounds or at off-site, church-sponsored venues.

The material often contains Christian references, although this is not a requirement. Recently, notable performers like [[Victoria Jackson]], [[Tim Conway]], [[Sinbad (entertainer)|Sinbad]] and [[Patricia Heaton]] have appeared on a DVD series for the Christian market entitled, "Thou Shalt Laugh"&lt;ref&gt;[http://thoushaltlaugh.com/ Thou Shalt Laugh] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223151828/http://www.thoushaltlaugh.com/ |date=2007-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian comedy is increasingly being used as an [[outreach]], with the idea that a comedy show is a great way to bring people into church who may have never thought about coming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.larryweaver.com/entertainment/christian-comedians.asp Christian Comedians]&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian comedy is also used as a method to renew and refresh the spirit of church members, based on the Bible passage that says laughter does a heart good, like medicine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christiancomedyacts.com Christian Comedy Acts]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2851">A '''comeback''', in terms of [[publicity]], is a return by a well-known person to the activity in which they initially obtained their fame. Comebacks can occur in all walks of life, and have been noted to occur in entertainment, sports, and politics.

A comeback may occur after a public figure has been forced to withdraw from the public eye due to a real or perceived scandal.

==Entertainment==
An entertainer may make a comeback after having been absent from their area of entertainment for a time.

In South Korea, [[Comeback (K-pop)]], talent agencies stage-manage the debut of new acts in order to create anticipation for the new act, which will often officially debut live on one of the main television music programs with a "debut stage". For the debut [[Single (music)|single]], acts will have an overall "[[gimmick|concept]]", a marketing hook, which influences the name of the act, clothes, choreography, catch phrases and how they are presented; within bands individual members will have a personal concept, this being a role that they will play within the band, e.g. leader, visual, maknae, rapper e.t.c. Once a rookie act's debut cycle has ended they enter their second promotional cycle with a "comeback", called as such even when the musician or group in question did not go on hiatus.&lt;ref name="ramstadwsj"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ramstad|first=Evan|title=Korea Counts Down Not Just To New Year, But to New Girls' Album|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2012/12/31/korea-counts-down-not-just-to-new-year-but-to-new-girls-album/|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=5 January 2013|quote=One of the unique things about album releases by K-pop artists is that they are routinely called 'comebacks' even when there's been no evidence that the musician or group went away or, in the conventional sports usage of the term, experienced a setback or loss.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each promotional cycle will be presented with its own concept.

==Sports==
{{distinguish|Comeback (sports)}}
In sports, a comeback occurs where an athlete or a team returns to success after a period of poor performance or inactivity. "The comeback may be the most compelling phenomenon in sports. ... Comebacks in individual sports like tennis, boxing, or golf occur more commonly than in team sports, as athletes in these games have more control over their destiny".&lt;ref&gt;Rick Swaine, ''Baseball's Comeback Players: Forty Major Leaguers Who Fell and Rose Again'' (2014), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
A politician may make a comeback after having left public life, either voluntarily or through loss of an election.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Shlomit Barnea, "Chronicles of the Comeback that Was and the One that Almost Was", in Asher Arian, Michal Shamir, ''The Elections in Israel 2009'' (2011), p. 146-147.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Computational aeroacoustics''' is a branch of [[aeroacoustics]] that aims to analyze the generation of [[noise]] by [[turbulence|turbulent]] flows through numerical methods.

==History==
The origin of '''Computational Aeroacoustics''' can only very likely be dated back to the middle of the 1980s, with a publication of Hardin and Lamkin&lt;ref&gt;Hardin, J.C. and Lamkin, S. L., "Aeroacoustic Computation of Cylinder Wake Flow," AIAA Journal, 22(1):51-57, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; who claimed, that &lt;blockquote&gt;
"''[...] the field of computational fluid mechanics has been advancing rapidly in the past few years and now offers the hope that "computational aeroacoustics," where noise is computed directly from a first principles determination of continuous velocity and vorticity fields, might be possible, [...]''"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Later in a publication 1986&lt;ref&gt;Hardin, J. C. and Lamkin, S. L., "Computational aeroacoustics - Present status and future promise," IN: Aero- and hydro-acoustics; Proceedings of the Symposium, Ecully, France, July 3â6, 1985 (A87-13585 03-71). Berlin and New York, Springer-Verlag, 1986, p. 253-259.&lt;/ref&gt; the same authors introduced the abbreviation CAA. The term was initially used for a low Mach number approach (Expansion of the acoustic perturbation field about an incompressible flow) as it is described under [[Computational Aeroacoustics#EIF|EIF]]. Later in the beginning 1990s the growing CAA community picked up the term and extensively used it for any kind of numerical method describing the noise radiation from an aeroacoustic source or the propagation of sound waves in an inhomogeneous flow field. Such numerical methods can be far field integration methods (e.g. FW-H&lt;ref&gt;Ffowcs Williams, "The Noise from Turbulence Convected at High Speed", ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society'', Vol. A255, 1963, pp. 496-503&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ffowcs Williams, J. E., and Hawkings, D. L., "Sound Generated by Turbulence and Surfaces in Arbitrary Motion", ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society'', Vol. A264, 1969, pp. 321-342&lt;/ref&gt;)  as well as direct numerical methods optimized for the solutions (e.g.&lt;ref&gt;C. K. W. Tam, and J. C. Webb, "Dispersion-Relation-Preserving Finite Difference Schemes for Computational Acoustics", ''Journal of Computational Physics'', Vol. 107, 1993, pp. 262-281&lt;/ref&gt;) of a mathematical model describing the aerodynamic noise generation and/or propagation. With the rapid development of the computational resources this field has undergone spectacular progress during the last three decades.

==Methods==
===Direct numerical simulation (DNS) Approach to CAA===
The compressible [[Navier-Stokes equation]] describes both the flow field, and the aerodynamically generated acoustic field. Thus both may be solved for directly. This requires very high numerical resolution due to the large differences in the length scale present between the acoustic variables and the flow variables. It is computationally very demanding and unsuitable for any commercial use.

===Hybrid Approach===
In this approach the computational domain is split into different regions, such that the governing acoustic or flow field can be solved with different equations and numerical techniques. This would involve using two different numerical solvers, first a dedicated [[Computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD) tool and secondly an acoustic solver. The flow field is then used to calculate the acoustical sources. Both steady state (RANS, SNGR (Stochastic Noise Generation and Radiation), ...) and transient (DNS, LES, DES, URANS, ...) fluid field solutions can be used. These acoustical sources are provided to the second solver which calculates the acoustical propagation. Acoustic propagation can be calculated using one of the following methods :
# Integral Methods
## Lighthill's analogy
## Kirchhoff integral
## FW-H
# LEE
# Pseudospectral
# EIF
# APE

====Integral methods====
There are multiple methods, which are based on a known solution of the acoustic wave equation to compute the acoustic far field of a sound source. Because a general solution for wave propagation in the free space can be written as an integral over all sources, these solutions are summarized as integral methods. The acoustic sources have to be known from some different source (e.g. a Finite Element simulation of a moving mechanical system or a fluid dynamic CFD simulation of the sources in a moving medium). The integral is taken over all sources at the retarded time (source time), which is the time at that the source is sent out the signal, which arrives now at a given observer position. Common to all integral methods is, that they cannot account for changes in the speed of sound or the average flow speed between source and observer position as they use a theoretical solution of the wave equation. When applying Lighthill's theory &lt;ref name="Lighthill1952"&gt;Lighthill, M. J., "On Sound Generated Aerodynamically, i", ''Proc. Roy. Soc. A'', Vol. 211, 1952, pp 564-587&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lighthill1954"&gt;Lighthill, M. J., "On Sound Generated Aerodynamically, ii", ''Proc. Roy. Soc. A'', Vol. 222, 1954, pp 1-32&lt;/ref&gt; to the Navier Stokes equations of Fluid mechanics, one obtains volumetric sources, whereas the other two analogies provide the far field information based on a surface integral. Acoustic analogies can be very efficient and fast, as the known solution of the wave equation is used. One far away observer takes as long as one very close observer. Common for the application of all analogies is the integration over a large number of contributions, which can lead to additional numerical problems (addition/subtraction of many large numbers with result close to zero.) Furthermore, when applying an integral method, usually the source domain is limited somehow. While in theory the sources outside have to be zero, the application can not always fulfill this condition. Especially in connection with CFD simulations, this leads to large cut-off errors. By damping the source gradually to zero at the exit of  the domain or adding some additional terms to correct this end-effect, these cut-off errors can be minimized.

=====Lighthill's analogy=====
Also called '[[Acoustic analogy|Acoustic Analogy]]'. To obtain Lighthill's aeroacoustic analogy the governing Navier-Stokes equations are rearranged. The left hand side is a wave operator, which is applied to the density perturbation or pressure perturbation respectively. The right hand side is identified as the acoustic sources in a fluid flow, then. As Lighthill's analogy follows directly from the Navier-Stokes equations without simplification, all sources are present. Some of the sources are then identified as turbulent or laminar noise. The far-field sound pressure is then given in terms of a volume integral over the domain containing the sound source. The source term always includes physical sources and such sources, which describe the propagation in an inhomogeneous medium.

The wave operator of Lighthill's analogy is limited to constant flow conditions outside the source zone. No variation of density, speed of sound and Mach number is allowed. Different mean flow conditions are identified as strong sources with opposite sign by the analogy, once an acoustic wave passes it. Part of the acoustic wave is removed by one source and a new wave is radiated to fix the different wave speed. This often leads very large volumes with strong sources. Several modifications to Lighthill's original theory have been proposed to account for the sound-flow interaction or other effects. To improve Lighthill's analogy different quantities inside the wave operator as well as different wave operators are considered by following analogies. All of them obtain modified source terms, which sometimes allow a more clear sight on the "real" sources. The acoustic analogies of Lilley,&lt;ref&gt;Lilley, G. M., "On the noise from air jets",AGARD CP 131, 13.1-13.12&lt;/ref&gt; Pierce,&lt;ref&gt;Pierce, A. D., "Wave equation for the sound in fluids with unsteady inhomogeneous flow", J. Acoust. Soc. Am., 87:2292-2299, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Howe&lt;ref&gt;Howe, M. S., "Contributions to the theory of aerodynamic sound, with application to excess jet noise and the theory of the flute", J. Fluid Mech., 71:625-673, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; and MÃ¶hring&lt;ref&gt;Mohring, W. A well posed acoustic analogy based on a moving acoustic medium. 2010, arXiv preprint arXiv:1009.3766.&lt;/ref&gt; are only some examples for aeroacoustic analogies based on Lighthill's ideas. All acoustic analogies require a volume integration over a source term.

The major difficulty with the acoustic analogy, however, is that the sound source is not compact in supersonic flow. Errors could be encountered in calculating the sound field, unless the computational domain could be extended in the downstream direction beyond the location where the sound source has completely decayed. Furthermore, an accurate account of the retarded time-effect requires keeping a long record of the time-history of the converged solutions of the sound source, which again represents a storage problem. For realistic problems, the required storage can reach the order of 1 [[terabyte]] of data.

=====Kirchhoff integral=====

[[Gustav Kirchhoff|Kirchhoff]] and [[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz]] showed, that the radiation of sound from a limited source region can be described by enclosing this source region by a control surface - the so-called Kichhoff surface. Then the sound field inside or outside the surface, where no sources are allowed and the wave operator on the left hand side applies, can be produced as a superposition of monopoles and dipoles on the surface. The theory follows directly from the wave equation. The source strength of monopoles and dipoles on the surface can be calculated if the normal velocity (for monopoles) and the pressure (for dipoles) on the surface are known respectively. A modification of the method allows even to calculate the pressure on the surface based on the normal velocity only. The normal velocity could be given by a FE-simulation of a moving structure for instance. However, the modification to avid the acoustic pressure on the surface to be known leads to problems, when considering an enclosed volume at its resonant frequencies, which is a major issue of the implementations of their method. The Kirchhoff integral method finds for instance application in [[Boundary element method]]s (BEM). A non-zero flow velocity is accounted by considering a moving frame of reference with the outer flow speed, in which the acoustic wave propagation takes place. Repetitive applications of the method can account for obstacles. First the sound field on the surface of the obstacle is calculated and then the obstacle is introduced by adding sources on its surface to cancel the normal velocity on the surface of the obstacle. Variations of the average flow field (speed of sound, density and velocity) can be taken into account by a similar method (e.g. dual reciprocity BEM).

=====FW-H=====
The integration method of [[John Ffowcs Williams|Ffowcs Williams]] and Hawkings is based on Lighthill's acoustic analogy. However, by some mathematical modifications under the assumption of a limited source region, which is enclosed by a control surface (FW-H surface), the volume integral is avoided. Surface integrals over monopole and dipole sources remain. Different from the Kirchhoff method, these sources follow directly from the Navier-Stokes equations through Lighthill's analogy. Sources outside the FW-H surface can be accounted by an additional volume integral over quadrupole sources following from the Lighthill Tensor. However, when considering the same assumptions as Kirchhoffs linear theory, the FW-H method equals the Kirchhoff method.

====Linearized Euler Equations====

Considering small disturbances superimposed on a uniform mean flow of density &lt;math&gt;\rho_0&lt;/math&gt;, pressure &lt;math&gt;p_0&lt;/math&gt; and velocity on x-axis &lt;math&gt;u_0&lt;/math&gt;, the Euler equations for a two dimensional model is presented as:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial\mathbf{U}}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial\mathbf{F}}{\partial x} +
\frac{\partial\mathbf{G}}{\partial y} = \mathbf{S}&lt;/math&gt;,

where

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{U} = 
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \rho \\
    u    \\
    v    \\
    p \\
  \end{bmatrix} \ , \ \mathbf{F} =
  \begin{bmatrix} 
    \rho_0 u + \rho u_0\\
    u_0 u + p/\rho_0  \\
    u_0 v  \\
    u_0 p + \gamma p_0 u  \\
  \end{bmatrix} \ , \ \mathbf{G} =
  \begin{bmatrix} 
    \rho_0 v\\
    0  \\
    p/\rho_0  \\
    \gamma p_0 v \\
  \end{bmatrix},
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; are the acoustic field variables, &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; the ratio of specific heats &lt;math&gt;c_p/c_v&lt;/math&gt;, for air at 20&amp;nbsp;Â°C &lt;math&gt;c_p/c_v = 1.4&lt;/math&gt;, and the source term &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S}&lt;/math&gt; on the right-side represents distributed unsteady sources. 
The application of LEE can be found in engine noise studies.&lt;ref&gt;X. X. Chen, X. Huang and X. Zhang, "Sound Radiation from a Bypass Duct with Bifurcations", AIAA Journal, Vol. 47, No. 2, 2009. pp.429-436.&lt;/ref&gt;

For high [[Mach number]] flows in compressible regimes, the acoustic propagation may be influenced by non-linearities and the LEE may no longer be the appropriate mathematical model.

====Pseudospectral====
A Fourier pseudospectral time-domain method can be applied to wave propagation problems pertinent to computational aeroacoustics. The original algorithm of the Fourier pseudo spectral time domain method works for periodical problems without the interaction with physical boundaries. A slip wall boundary condition, combined with buffer zone technique to solve some non-periodical aeroacoustic problems has been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;X. Huang and X. Zhang, "A Fourier Pseudospectral Method for Some Computational Aeroacoustics Problems", International Journal of Aeroacoustics, Vol 5, No 3, 2006. pp.279-294.&lt;/ref&gt;  Compared to other computational methods, pseudospectral method is preferred for its high-order accuracy.

{{linguistics}}
'''Computational linguistics''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] field concerned with the statistical or rule-based modeling of [[natural language]] from a computational perspective, as well as the study of appropriate computational approaches to linguistic questions.

Traditionally, computational linguistics was performed by [[computer scientist]]s who had specialized in the application of computers to the processing of a [[natural language]]. Today, computational linguists often work as members of interdisciplinary teams, which can include regular linguists, experts in the target language, and computer scientists. In general, computational linguistics draws upon the involvement of [[linguistics|linguists]], [[computer science|computer scientists]], experts in [[artificial intelligence]], [[mathematicians]], [[logic]]ians, [[philosophy|philosophers]], [[cognitive science|cognitive scientists]], [[cognitive psychology|cognitive psychologists]], [[psycholinguistics|psycholinguists]], [[anthropology|anthropologists]] and [[neuroscience|neuroscientists]], among others.

Computational linguistics has theoretical and applied components. Theoretical computational linguistics focuses on issues in [[theoretical linguistics]] and cognitive science, and applied computational linguistics focuses on the practical outcome of modeling human language use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Hans |last=Uszkoreit |title=What Is Computational Linguistics? |url=http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/~hansu/what_is_cl.html |publisher=Department of Computational Linguistics and Phonetics of Saarland University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Association for Computational Linguistics]] defines computational linguistics as:
{{quote|...the scientific study of [[language]] from a computational perspective. Computational linguists are interested in providing [[computational model]]s of various kinds of linguistic phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=The Association for Computational Linguistics |url=http://www.aclweb.org/archive/misc/what.html |title=What is Computational Linguistics? |date=February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Origins==
Computational linguistics is often grouped within the field of artificial intelligence, but actually was present before the development of artificial intelligence. Computational linguistics originated with efforts in the United States in the 1950s to use computers to automatically translate texts from foreign languages, particularly Russian scientific journals, into English.&lt;ref&gt;John Hutchins: [http://www.hutchinsweb.me.uk/MTS-1999.pdf Retrospect and prospect in computer-based translation.] Proceedings of MT Summit VII, 1999, pp. 30â44.&lt;/ref&gt; Since computers can make [[arithmetic]] calculations much faster and more accurately than humans, it was thought to be only a short matter of time before they could also begin to process language.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold B. Barach: [https://www.flickr.com/photos/bostworld/2152048032/in/set-72157603898383698/ Translating Machine] 1975: And the Changes To Come.&lt;/ref&gt; Computational and quantitative methods are also used historically in attempted reconstruction of earlier forms of modern languages and subgrouping modern languages into language families. Earlier methods such as [[lexicostatistics]] and [[glottochronology]] have been proven to be premature and inaccurate. However, recent interdisciplinary studies which borrow concepts from biological studies, especially [[gene mapping]], have proved to produce more sophisticated analytical tools and more trustworthy results.&lt;ref&gt;T. Crowley., C. Bowern. An Introduction to Historical Linguistics. Auckland, N.Z.: Oxford UP, 1992. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[machine translation]] (also known as mechanical translation) failed to yield accurate translations right away, automated processing of human languages was recognized as far more complex than had originally been assumed. Computational linguistics was born as the name of the new field of study devoted to developing [[algorithm]]s and software for intelligently processing language data. The term "computational linguistics" itself was first coined by [[David G. Hays|David Hays]], founding member of both the [[Association for Computational Linguistics]] and the [[International Committee on Computational Linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nlp.shef.ac.uk/iccl/committee.html#deceased|title=Deceased members|website=ICCL members|accessdate=15 November 2017|ref=ICCLmembers}}&lt;/ref&gt; When artificial intelligence came into existence in the 1960s, the field of computational linguistics became that sub-division of artificial intelligence dealing with human-level comprehension and production of natural languages.{{citation needed|date=July 2008}}

In order to translate one language into another, it was observed that one had to understand the [[grammar]] of both languages, including both [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (the grammar of word forms) and [[syntax]] (the grammar of sentence structure). In order to understand syntax, one had to also understand the [[semantics]] and the [[lexicon]] (or 'vocabulary'), and even something of the [[pragmatics]] of language use. Thus, what started as an effort to translate between languages evolved into an entire discipline devoted to understanding how to represent and process natural languages using computers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-nlpir.nist.gov/MINDS/FINAL/NLP.web.pdf Natural Language Processing by Liz Liddy, Eduard Hovy, Jimmy Lin, John Prager, Dragomir Radev, Lucy Vanderwende, Ralph Weischedel]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays research within the scope of computational linguistics is done at computational linguistics departments,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de "Computational Linguistics and Phonetics"].&lt;/ref&gt; computational linguistics laboratories,&lt;ref&gt;[http://yatsko.zohosites.com/home.html "Yatsko's Computational Linguistics Laboratory"].&lt;/ref&gt; [[computer science]] departments,&lt;ref&gt;[https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/clip/index.php/Main_Page "CLIP"].&lt;/ref&gt; and linguistics departments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://linguistics.georgetown.edu/programs/graduate/computational/ Computational Linguistics&amp;nbsp;â Department of Linguistics&amp;nbsp;â Georgetown College&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ling.upenn.edu/research/computational.html "UPenn Linguistics: Computational Linguistics"].&lt;/ref&gt; 
Some research in the field of computational linguistics aims to create working speech or text processing systems while others aim to create a system allowing human-machine interaction. Programs meant for human-machine communication are called [[Embodied agent|conversational agents]].&lt;ref&gt;Jurafsky, D., &amp; Martin, J. H. (2009).

==Approaches==

Just as computational linguistics can be performed by experts in a variety of fields and through a wide assortment of departments, so too can the research fields broach a diverse range of topics.  The following sections discuss some of the literature available across the entire field broken into four main area of discourse: developmental linguistics, structural linguistics, linguistic production, and linguistic comprehension.

===Developmental approaches===

Language is a cognitive skill which develops throughout the life of an individual. This developmental process has been examined using a number of techniques, and a computational approach is one of them.  Human [[language development]] does provide some constraints which make it harder to apply a computational method to understanding it. For instance, during [[language acquisition]], human children are largely only exposed to positive evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Bowerman, M. (1988). [http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:468143:4/component/escidoc:532427/bowerman_1988_The-No.pdf The "no negative evidence" problem: How do children avoid constructing an overly general grammar. Explaining language universals].&lt;/ref&gt; This means that during the linguistic development of an individual, only evidence for what is a correct form is provided, and not evidence for what is not correct.  This is insufficient information for a simple hypothesis testing procedure for information as complex as language,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1971"&gt;Braine, M.D.S. (1971). On two types of models of the internalization of grammars. In D.I. Slobin (Ed.), The ontogenesis of grammar: A theoretical perspective. New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and so provides certain boundaries for a computational approach to modeling language development and acquisition in an individual.

Attempts have been made to model the developmental process of language acquisition in children from a computational angle, leading to both [[stochastic grammar|statistical grammars]] and [[connectionism|connectionist models]].&lt;ref name="powers1989"&gt;Powers, D.M.W. &amp; Turk, C.C.R. (1989). ''Machine Learning of Natural Language''. Springer-Verlag. {{ISBN|978-0-387-19557-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Work in this realm has also been proposed as a method to explain the [[evolution of language]] through history.  Using models, it has been shown that languages can be learned with a combination of simple input presented incrementally as the child develops better memory and longer attention span.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1993"&gt;Elman, J. (1993). [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0010027793900584 Learning and development in neural networks: The importance of starting small]. Cognition, 71-99.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was simultaneously posed as a reason for the long developmental period of human children.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1993"/&gt; Both conclusions were drawn because of the strength of the [[artificial neural network]] which the project created.

The ability of infants to develop language has also been modeled using robots&lt;ref&gt;Salvi, G., Montesano, L., Bernardino, A., &amp; Santos-Victor, J. (2012). Language bootstrapping: learning word meanings from perception-action association. IEEE transactions on systems, man, and cybernetics. Part B, Cybernetics : a publication of the IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society, 42(3), 660-71. {{DOI|10.1109/TSMCB.2011.2172420}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to test linguistic theories.  Enabled to learn as children might, a model was created based on an [[affordance]] model in which mappings between actions, perceptions, and effects were created and linked to spoken words.  Crucially, these robots were able to acquire functioning word-to-meaning mappings without needing grammatical structure, vastly simplifying the learning process and shedding light on information which furthers the current understanding of linguistic development.  It is important to note that this information could only have been empirically tested using a computational approach.

As our understanding of the linguistic development of an individual within a lifetime is continually improved using neural networks and [[Robot_learning|learning robotic systems]], it is also important to keep in mind that languages themselves change and develop through time.  Computational approaches to understanding this phenomenon have unearthed very interesting information.  Using the [[Price Equation]] and [[PÃ³lya urn]] dynamics, researchers have created a system which not only predicts future linguistic evolution, but also gives insight into the evolutionary history of modern-day languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Gong, T.|author2=Shuai, L.|author3=Tamariz, M.|author4=JÃ¤ger, G.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2012|title=Studying Language Change Using Price Equation and PÃ³lya-urn Dynamics|editor=E. Scalas|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=7|issue=3|page=e33171|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0033171|pmid=22427981|pmc=3299756}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This modeling effort achieved, through computational linguistics, what would otherwise have been impossible.

It is clear that the understanding of linguistic development in humans as well as throughout evolutionary time has been fantastically improved because of advances in computational linguistics. The ability to model and modify systems at will affords science an ethical method of testing hypotheses that would otherwise be intractable.

===Structural approaches===

In order to create better computational models of language, an understanding of languageâs structure is crucial. To this end, the [[English language]] has been meticulously studied using computational approaches to better understand how the language works on a structural level.  One of the most important pieces of being able to study linguistic structure is the availability of large linguistic corpora, or samples.  This grants computational linguists the raw data necessary to run their models and gain a better understanding of the underlying structures present in the vast amount of data which is contained in any single language.  One of the most cited English linguistic corpora is the Penn [[Treebank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Marcus, M.|author2=Marcinkiewicz, M.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1993|url=https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/J/J93/J93-2004.pdf|title=Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank|journal=Computational Linguistics|volume=19|issue=2|pages=313â330}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Derived from widely-different sources, such as IBM computer manuals and transcribed telephone conversations, this corpus contains over 4.5 million words of American English. This corpus has been primarily annotated using [[part-of-speech]] tagging and syntactic bracketing and has yielded substantial empirical observations related to language structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=Ann|title=Treebanks|date=2003|publisher=Spring Netherlands|pages=5â22|chapter=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theoretical approaches to the structure of languages have also been developed.  These works allow computational linguistics to have a framework within which to work out hypotheses that will further the understanding of the language in a myriad of ways.  One of the original theoretical theses on internalization of [[grammar]] and structure of language proposed two types of models.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1971" /&gt;  In these models, rules or patterns learned increase in strength with the frequency of their encounter.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1971" /&gt; The work also created a question for computational linguists to answer: how does an infant learn a specific and non-normal grammar ([[Chomsky Normal Form]]) without learning an overgeneralized version and getting stuck?&lt;ref name="autogenerated1971" /&gt; Theoretical efforts like these set the direction for research to go early in the lifetime of a field of study, and are crucial to the growth of the field.

Structural information about languages allows for the discovery and implementation of similarity recognition between pairs of text utterances.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Angus, D.|author2=Smith, A.|author3=Wiles, J.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2012|title=Conceptual recurrence plots: revealing patterns in human discourse|journal=IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics|volume=18|issue=6|pages=988â97|doi=10.1109/TVCG.2011.100|pmid=22499664}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, it has recently been proven that based on the structural information present in patterns of human discourse, conceptual [[recurrence plots]] can be used to model and visualize trends in data and create reliable measures of similarity between natural textual utterances.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;  This technique is a strong tool for further probing the structure of human [[discourse]].  Without the computational approach to this question, the vastly complex information present in discourse data would have remained inaccessible to scientists.

Information regarding the structural data of a language is available for [[English language|English]] as well as other languages, such as [[Japanese language|Japanese]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Furuhashi, S.|author2=Hayakawa, Y. |lastauthoramp=y|year=2012|title=Lognormality of the Distribution of Japanese Sentence Lengths|journal=Journal of the Physical Society of Japan|volume=81|issue=3|page=034004|doi=10.1143/JPSJ.81.034004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using computational methods, Japanese sentence corpora were analyzed and a pattern of [[log-normality]] was found in relation to sentence length.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;  Though the exact cause of this lognormality remains unknown, it is precisely this sort of intriguing information which computational linguistics is designed to uncover.  This information could lead to further important discoveries regarding the underlying structure of Japanese, and could have any number of effects on the understanding of Japanese as a language.  Computational linguistics allows for very exciting additions to the scientific knowledge base to happen quickly and with very little room for doubt.

Without a computational approach to the structure of linguistic data, much of the information that is available now would still be hidden under the vastness of data within any single language.  Computational linguistics allows scientists to parse huge amounts of data reliably and efficiently, creating the possibility for discoveries unlike any seen in most other approaches.

===Production approaches===
{{Original research section|date=October 2015}}

The production of language is equally as complex in the information it provides and the necessary skills which a fluent producer must have.  That is to say, comprehension is only half the problem of communication.  The other half is how a system produces language, and computational linguistics has made some very interesting discoveries in this area.
[[File:Alan Turing Aged 16.jpg|thumb|Alan Turing: computer scientist and namesake developer of the [[Turing test|Turing Test]] as a method of measuring the intelligence of a machine.]]
In a now famous paper published in 1950 [[Alan Turing]] proposed the possibility that machines might one day have the ability to "think". As a thought experiment for what might define the concept of thought in machines, he proposed an "imitation test" in which a human subject has two text-only conversations, one with a fellow human and another with a machine attempting to respond like a human. Turing proposes that if the subject cannot tell the difference between the human and the machine, it may be concluded that the machine is capable of thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Turing, A. M.|year=1950|jstor=10.2307/2251299|title=Computing machinery and intelligence|journal=Mind|volume=59|issue=236|pages=433â460|doi=10.1093/mind/lix.236.433}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today this test is known as the [[Turing test]] and it remains an influential idea in the area of artificial intelligence.

[[File:Joseph Weizenbaum.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Weizenbaum]]: former MIT professor and computer scientist who developed [[ELIZA]], a primitive computer program utilizing [[natural language processing]].]] One of the earliest and best known examples of a computer program designed to converse naturally with humans is the [[ELIZA]] program developed by [[Joseph Weizenbaum]] at [[MIT]] in 1966. The program emulated a [[Rogerian psychotherapy|Rogerian]] [[psychotherapist]] when responding to written statements and questions posed by a user. It appeared capable of understanding what was said to it and responding intelligently, but in truth it simply followed a pattern matching routine that relied on only understanding a few keywords in each sentence. Its responses were generated by recombining the unknown parts of the sentence around properly translated versions of the known words. For example, in the phrase "It seems that you hate me" ELIZA understands "you" and "me" which matches the general pattern "you [some words] me", allowing ELIZA to update the words "you" and "me" to "I" and "you" and replying "What makes you think I hate you?". In this example ELIZA has no understanding of the word "hate", but it is not required for a logical response in the context of this type of psychotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Weizenbaum, J.|year=1966|title=ELIZAâa computer program for the study of natural language communication between man and machine|journal=Communications of the ACM|volume=9|issue=1|pages=36â45|doi=10.1145/365153.365168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some projects are still trying to solve the problem which first started computational linguistics off as its own field in the first place. However, the methods have become more refined and clever, and consequently the results generated by computational linguists have become more enlightening.  In an effort to improve computer translation, several models have been compared, including [[hidden Markov models]], smoothing techniques, and the specific refinements of those to apply them to verb translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Och, F. J.|author2=Ney, H.|year=2003|title=A Systematic Comparison of Various Statistical Alignment Models|journal=Computational Linguistics|volume=29|issue=1|pages=19â51|doi=10.1162/089120103321337421}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The model which was found to produce the most natural translations of [[German language|German]] and [[French language|French]] words was a refined alignment model with a first-order dependence and a fertility model[16].  They also provide efficient training algorithms for the models presented, which can give other scientists the ability to improve further on their results. This type of work is specific to computational linguistics, and has applications which could vastly improve understanding of how language is produced and comprehended by computers.

Work has also been done in making computers produce language in a more naturalistic manner.  Using linguistic input from humans, algorithms have been constructed which are able to modify a system's style of production based on a factor such as linguistic input from a human, or more abstract factors like politeness or any of the [[Big Five personality traits|five main dimensions of personality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mairesse, F.|year=2011|title=Controlling user perceptions of linguistic style: Trainable generation of personality traits|journal=Computational Linguistics|doi=10.1162/COLI_a_00063|volume=37|issue=3|pages=455â488}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This work takes a computational approach via [[parameter estimation]] models to categorize the vast array of linguistic styles we see across individuals and simplify it for a computer to work in the same way, making [[human-computer interaction]] much more natural.

==== Text-based interactive approach ====

Many of the earliest and simplest models of human-computer interaction, such as ELIZA for example, involve a text-based input from the user to generate a response from the computer. By this method, words typed by a user trigger the computer to recognize specific patterns and reply accordingly, through a process known as [[keyword spotting]].

==== Speech-based interactive approach ====

Recent technologies have placed more of an emphasis on speech-based interactive systems. These systems, such as [[Siri]] of the [[iOS]] operating system, operate on a similar pattern-recognizing technique as that of text-based systems, but with the former, the user input is conducted through [[speech recognition]]. This branch of linguistics involves the processing of the user's speech as sound waves and the interpreting of the acoustics and language patterns in order for the computer to recognize the input.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Language Files|last = |first = |publisher = The Ohio State University Department of Linguistics|year = 2011|isbn = 9780814251799|location = |pages = 624â634}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comprehension approaches===

Much of the focus of modern computational linguistics is on comprehension. With the proliferation of the internet and the abundance of easily accessible written human language, the ability to create a program capable of [[natural language understanding|understanding human language]] would have many broad and exciting possibilities, including improved search engines, automated customer service, and online education.

Early work in comprehension included applying Bayesian statistics to the task of optical character recognition, as illustrated by Bledsoe and Browing in 1959 in which a large dictionary of possible letters were generated by "learning" from example letters and then the probability that any one of those learned examples matched the new input was combined to make a final decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author1=Bledsoe, W. W.|author2=Browning, I.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1959|title=Pattern recognition and reading by machine|conference=''Papers presented at the December 1â3, 1959, eastern joint IRE-AIEE-ACM computer conference on - IRE-AIEE-ACM  â59 (Eastern)''|pages=225â232|location=New York, New York, USA|publisher=ACM Press|doi=10.1145/1460299.1460326}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other attempts at applying Bayesian statistics to language analysis included the work of Mosteller and Wallace (1963) in which an analysis of the words used in ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'' was used to attempt to determine their authorship (concluding that Madison most likely authored the majority of the papers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mosteller, F.|year=1963|jstor=10.2307/2283270|title=Inference in an authorship problem|journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association|volume=58|issue=302|pages=275â309|doi=10.2307/2283270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971 [[Terry Winograd]] developed an early [[natural language processing]] engine capable of interpreting naturally written commands within a simple rule governed environment. The primary language parsing program in this project was called [[SHRDLU]], which was capable of carrying out a somewhat natural conversation with the user giving it commands, but only within the scope of the toy environment designed for the task. This environment consisted of different shaped and colored blocks, and SHRDLU was capable of interpreting commands such as "Find a block which is taller than the one you are holding and put it into the box." and asking questions such as "I don't understand which pyramid you mean." in response to the user's input.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Winograd, T.|year=1971|url=http://www.dtic.mil/docs/citations/AD0721399|title=Procedures as a Representation for Data in a Computer Program for Understanding Natural Language|type=Report}}&lt;/ref&gt; While impressive, this kind of [[natural language processing]] has proven much more difficult outside the limited scope of the toy environment. Similarly a project developed by [[NASA]] called [[LUNAR]] was designed to provide answers to naturally written questions about the geological analysis of lunar rocks returned by the Apollo missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Woods, W.|author2=Kaplan, R.|author3=Nash-Webber, B.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1972|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247926251|title=The lunar sciences natural language information system|type=Report}}&lt;/ref&gt; These kinds of problems are referred to as [[question answering]].

Initial attempts at understanding spoken language were based on work done in the 1960s and 1970s in signal modeling where an unknown signal is analyzed to look for patterns and to make predictions based on its history. An initial and somewhat successful approach to applying this kind of signal modeling to language was achieved with the use of hidden Markov models as detailed by Rabiner in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Rabiner, L.|year=1989|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=18626|title=A tutorial on hidden Markov models and selected applications in speech recognition|journal=Proceedings of the IEEE|volume=77|issue=2|pages=257â286|doi=10.1109/5.18626|citeseerx=10.1.1.381.3454}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach attempts to determine probabilities for the arbitrary number of models that could be being used in generating speech as well as modeling the probabilities for various words generated from each of these possible models. Similar approaches were employed in early [[speech recognition]] attempts starting in the late 70s at IBM using word/part-of-speech pair probabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bahl, L.|author2=Baker, J.|author3=Cohen, P.|author4=Jelinek, F.|year=1978|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=1170402|title=Recognition of continuously read natural corpus|journal=Acoustics, Speech, and Signal|volume=3|pages=422â424|doi=10.1109/ICASSP.1978.1170402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently these kinds of statistical approaches have been applied to more difficult tasks such as topic identification using Bayesian parameter estimation to infer topic probabilities in text documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Blei, D.|author2=Ng, A. |lastauthoramp=y|year=2003|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=944937|title=Latent dirichlet allocation|journal=The Journal of Machine Learning|volume=3|pages=993â1022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
Modern computational linguistics is often a combination of studies in computer science and programming, math, particularly statistics, language structures, and natural language processing. Combined, these fields most often lead to the development of systems that can recognize speech and perform some task based on that speech. Examples include speech recognition software, such as Apple's Siri feature, spellcheck tools, [[speech synthesis]] programs, which are often used to demonstrate pronunciation or help the disabled, and machine translation programs and websites, such as Google Translate.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cla.csulb.edu/departments/linguistics/careers-computational-linguistics/|title=Careers in Computational Linguistics|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=California State University|access-date=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Computational linguistics can be especially helpful in situations involving [[social media]] and the [[Internet]]. For example, filters in chatrooms or on website searches require computational linguistics. Chat operators often use filters to identify certain words or phrases and deem them inappropriate so that users cannot submit them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another example of using filters is on websites. Schools use filters so that websites with certain keywords are blocked from children to view. There are also many programs in which parents use [[Parental controls]] to put content filters in place. Computational linguists can also develop programs that group and organize content through [[Social media mining]]. An example of this is Twitter, in which programs can group tweets by subject or keywords.&lt;ref&gt;Marujo, Lu&lt;math&gt;\acute{i}&lt;/math&gt;s et al. "Automatic Keyword Extraction on Twitter." Language Technologies Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, n.d. Web. 19 Sept. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Computational linguistics is also used for document retrieval and clustering. When you do an online search, documents and websites are retrieved based on the frequency of unique labels related to what you typed into a search engine. For instance, if you search "red, large, four-wheeled vehicle," with the intention of finding pictures of a red truck, the search engine will still find the information desired by matching words such as "four-wheeled" with "car".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computational-linguistics/#DocRetCluApp|title=Computational Linguistics|last=|first=|date=Feb 26, 2014|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Apr 19, 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subfields==
Computational linguistics can be divided into major areas depending upon the medium of the language being processed, whether spoken or textual; and upon the task being performed, whether analyzing language (recognition) or [[natural language generation|synthesizing language (generation)]].

[[Speech recognition]] and [[speech synthesis]] deal with how spoken language can be understood or created using computers. Parsing and generation are sub-divisions of computational linguistics dealing respectively with taking language apart and putting it together. Machine translation remains the sub-division of computational linguistics dealing with having computers translate between languages. The possibility of automatic language translation, however, has yet to be realized and remains a notoriously hard branch of computational linguistics.&lt;ref&gt;Oettinger, A. G. (1965). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2313322 Computational Linguistics]. The American Mathematical Monthly, Vol. 72, No. 2, Part 2: Computers and Computing, pp. 147-150.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the areas of research that are studied by computational linguistics include:
* [[Analysis of algorithms|Computational complexity]] of natural language, largely modeled on [[automata theory]], with the application of [[context-sensitive grammar]] and [[Linear bounded automaton|linearly bounded]] [[Turing machine]]s.
* [[Computational semantics]] comprises defining suitable logics for [[linguistic meaning]] representation, automatically constructing them and reasoning with them
* Computer-aided [[corpus linguistics]], which has been used since the 1970s as a way to make detailed advances in the field of discourse analysis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McEnery|first=Thomas|title=Corpus Linguistics: An Introduction|year=1996|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh|isbn=978-0748611652|page=114|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nwmgdvN_akAC&amp;pg=PA114&amp;lpg=PA114&amp;dq=%22computer+aided+corpus+linguistics%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22computer%20aided%20corpus%20linguistics%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Design of [[parser]]s or [[phrase chunking|chunkers]] for [[natural language]]s
* Design of taggers like [[Part-of-speech tagging|POS-taggers (part-of-speech taggers)]]
* [[Machine translation]] as one of the earliest and most difficult applications of computational linguistics draws on many subfields.
* Simulation and study of language evolution in [[historical linguistics]]/[[glottochronology]].

The subject of computational linguistics has had a recurring impact on popular culture:
* The 1983 film ''[[WarGames]]'' features a young computer hacker who interacts with an artificially intelligent supercomputer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title = WarGames|url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086567/|date = 1983-06-03|accessdate = 2016-02-22|first = John|last = Badham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Computational science''' (also '''scientific computing''' or '''scientific computation''' ('''SC''')) is a rapidly growing multidisciplinary field that uses advanced computing capabilities to understand and solve complex problems. It is an area of science which spans many disciplines, but at its core it involves the development of models and simulations to understand natural systems.

*  [[Algorithm]]s ([[Numerical analysis|numerical]] and non-numerical): [[Mathematical model|mathematical models]], [[Computational model|computational models]], and [[Computer simulation|computer simulations]] developed to solve [[science]] (e.g., [[Computational biology|biological]], [[Computational physics|physical]], and [[Computational sociology|social]]), [[engineering]], and [[humanities]] problems
* [[Computer and information science]] that develops and optimizes the advanced system [[Computer hardware|hardware]], [[software]], [[Computer network|networking]], and [[data management]] components needed to solve computationally demanding problems
* The computing infrastructure that supports both the science and engineering problem solving and the developmental computer and information science 
In practical use, it is typically the application of [[computer simulation]] and other forms of [[computation]] from [[numerical analysis]] and [[theoretical computer science]] to solve problems in various scientific disciplines. The field is different from theory and laboratory experiment which are the traditional forms of science and [[engineering]]. The scientific computing approach is to gain understanding, mainly through the analysis of mathematical models implemented on [[computer]]s. Scientists and engineers develop [[computer programs]], [[application software]], that model systems being studied and run these programs with various sets of input parameters. The essence of computational science is the application of numerical algorithms&lt;ref&gt;Nonweiler T. R., 1986. Computational Mathematics: An Introduction to Numerical Approximation, John Wiley and Sons&lt;/ref&gt; and/or [[computational mathematics]]. In some cases, these models require massive amounts of calculations (usually [[floating-point]]) and are often executed on [[supercomputer]]s or [[distributed computing]] platforms.

== The computational scientist ==
[[File:Ways to study a system.png|thumb|Ways to study a system]]
The term [[computational scientist]] is used to describe someone skilled in scientific computing. This person is usually a scientist, an engineer or an applied mathematician who applies [[high-performance computing]] in different ways to advance the state-of-the-art in their respective applied disciplines in physics, chemistry or engineering.

Computational science is now commonly considered a third mode of [[science]], complementing and adding to [[experimentation]]/[[observation]] and [[theory]] (see image on the right).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siam.org/students/resources/report.php Graduate Education for Computational Science and Engineering].Siam.org, [[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics]] (SIAM) website; accessed Feb 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Here, we define a [[system]] as a potential source of data,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theory of Modeling and Simulation|last=Siegler|first=Bernard|publisher=|year=1976|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[experiment]] as a process of extracting data from a system by exerting it through its inputs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Continuous System Modelling|last=Cellier|first=FranÃ§ois|publisher=|year=1990|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Computer model|model]] (''M'') for a system (''S'') and an experiment (''E'') as anything to which E can be applied in order to answer questions about S.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Models,Minds, Machines|last=Minski|first=Marvin|publisher=|year=1965|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A computational scientist should be capable of:
* recognizing '''complex problems'''
* adequately '''conceptualise''' the system containing these problems
* design a framework of algorithms suitable for studying this system: the '''simulation'''
* choose a suitable '''computing infrastructure''' ([[parallel computing]]/[[grid computing]]/[[supercomputer]]s)
* hereby, maximising the '''computational power''' of the simulation
* assessing to what level the output of the simulation resembles the systems: the model is '''validated'''
* adjust the conceptualisation of the system accordingly
* repeat cycle until a suitable level of validation is obtained: the computational scientists trusts that the simulation generates adequately realistic results for the system, under the studied conditions
In fact, substantial effort in computational sciences has been devoted to the development of algorithms, the efficient implementation in programming languages, and validation of computational results. A collection of problems and solutions in computational science can be found in Steeb, Hardy, Hardy and Stoop (2004).&lt;ref&gt;Steeb W.-H., Hardy Y., Hardy A. and Stoop R., 2004. Problems and Solutions in Scientific Computing with C++ and Java Simulations, World Scientific Publishing. {{ISBN|981-256-112-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophers of science addressed the question to what degree computational science qualifies as science, among them Humphreys&lt;ref&gt;Humphreys, Paul. ''Extending ourselves: Computational science, empiricism, and scientific method.'' Oxford University Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; and Gelfert&lt;ref&gt;Gelfert, Axel. 2016. ''How to do science with models: A philosophical primer.'' Cham: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; They address the general question of epistemology: how do we gain insight from such computational science approaches. Tolk&lt;ref&gt;Tolk, Andreas. "Learning Something Right from Models That Are Wrong: Epistemology of Simulation." In ''Concepts and Methodologies for Modeling and Simulation,'' edited by L. Yilmaz, pp. 87-106, Cham: Springer International Publishing, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; uses these insights to show the epistemological constraints of computer-based simulation research. As computational science uses mathematical models representing the underlying theory in executable form, in essence they apply modeling (theory building) and simulation (implementation and execution). While simulation and computational science are our most sophisticated way to express our knowledge and understanding, they also come with all constraints and limits already known for computational solutions.

== Applications of computational science ==
Problem domains for computational science/scientific computing include:

=== Urban complex systems ===
In 2015, over half the worlds population live in cities. By the middle of the 21st century, it is estimated that 75% of the worldâs population will be [[Urban area|urban]]. This urban growth is focused in the urban populations of developing countries where cities dwellers will more than double, increasing from 2.5 billion in 2009 to almost 5.2 billion in 2050. Cities are massive complex systems created by humans, made up of humans and governed by humans. Trying to predict, understand and somehow shape the development of cities in the future requires complexity thinking, and requires computational models and simulations to help mitigate challenges and possible disasters. The focus of research in urban complex systems is, through modelling and simulation, to build greater understanding of city dynamics and help prepare for the coming [[Urbanization|urbanisation]].

=== Computational finance ===
{{main|Computational finance}}
In todayâs [[financial market]]s huge volumes of interdependent assets are traded by a large number of interacting market participants in different locations and time zones. Their behavior is of unprecedented complexity and the characterization and measurement of the risk inherent to these highly diverse set of instruments is typically based on complicated [[Mathematical model|mathematical]] and [[computational model]]s. Solving these models exactly in closed form, even at a single instrument level, is typically not possible, and therefore we have to look for efficient [[numerical algorithm]]s. This has become even more urgent and complex recently, as the credit crisis has clearly demonstrated the role of cascading effects going from single instruments through portfolios of single institutions to even the interconnected trading network. Understanding this requires a multi-scale and holistic approach where interdependent risk factors such as market, credit and liquidity risk are modelled simultaneously and at different interconnected scales.

=== Computational biology ===
{{main|Computational biology}}
Exciting new developments in [[biotechnology]] are now revolutionizing biology and [[biomedical research]]. Examples of these techniques are [[DNA sequencing|high-throughput sequencing]], high-throughput [[Real-time polymerase chain reaction|quantitative PCR]], intra-cellular imaging, [[In situ hybridization|in-situ hybridization]] of gene expression, three-dimensional imaging techniques like [[Light sheet fluorescence microscopy|Light Sheet Fluorescence Microscopy]] and [[Optical projection tomography|Optical Projection]], (micro)-[[CT scan|Computer Tomography]]. Given the massive amounts of complicated data that is generated by these techniques, their meaningful interpretation, and even their storage, form major challenges calling for new approaches. Going beyond current bioinformatics approaches, computational biology needs to develop new methods to discover meaningful patterns in these large data sets. Model-based reconstruction of [[Gene regulatory network|gene networks]] can be used to organize the gene expression data in systematic way and to guide future data collection. A major challenge here is to understand how gene regulation is controlling fundamental biological processes like [[Biomineralization|biomineralisation]] and [[embryogenesis]]. The sub-processes like [[gene regulation]], [[Organic compound|organic molecules]] interacting with the mineral deposition process, [[Cell (biology)|cellular processes]], [[physiology]] and other processes at the tissue and environmental levels are linked. Rather than being directed by a central control mechanism, biomineralisation and embryogenesis can be viewed as an emergent behavior resulting from a complex system in which several sub-processes on very different [[Temporal scales|temporal]] and [[spatial scale]]s (ranging from nanometer and nanoseconds to meters and years) are connected into a multi-scale system. One of the few available options to understand such systems is by developing a [[Multiscale modeling|multi-scale model]] of the system.

=== Complex systems theory ===
{{main|Complex systems}}
Using [[information theory]], [[Non-equilibrium thermodynamics|non-equilibrium dynamics]] and explicit simulations computational systems theory tries to uncover the true nature of [[complex adaptive system]]s.

=== Computational science in engineering ===
{{main|Computational engineering}}

Computational science and engineering (CSE) is a relatively new discipline that deals with the development and application of computational models and simulations, often coupled with [[high-performance computing]], to solve complex physical problems arising in engineering analysis and design (computational engineering) as well as natural phenomena (computational science). CSE has been described as the "third mode of discovery" (next to theory and experimentation).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cseprograms.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/CSEHandbook-Students-v11.pdf |title=Computational Science and Engineering Program: Graduate Student Handbook | website=cseprograms.gatech.edu |date=September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many fields, computer simulation is integral and therefore essential to business and research. Computer simulation provides the capability to enter fields that are either inaccessible to traditional experimentation or where carrying out traditional empirical inquiries is prohibitively expensive. CSE should neither be confused with pure [[computer science]], nor with [[computer engineering]], although a wide domain in the former is used in CSE (e.g., certain algorithms, data structures, parallel programming, high performance computing) and some problems in the latter can be modeled and solved with CSE methods (as an application area).

==Methods and algorithms==
Algorithms and mathematical methods used in computational science are varied. Commonly applied methods include:

{{div col|colwidth=30em}}

Both historically and today, [[Fortran]] remains popular for most applications of scientific computing.&lt;ref name="ars"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2014/05/scientific-computings-future-can-any-coding-language-top-a-1950s-behemoth/ |title=Scientific computingâs future: Can any coding language top a 1950s behemoth? |last=Phillips |first=Lee |publisher=[[Ars Technica]] |date=2014-05-07 |accessdate=2016-03-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="princeton"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://press.princeton.edu/landau_firstCourse/FortranCD/AllFort.pdf |format=PDF |title=A First Course in Scientific Computing |last=Landau |first=Rubin |publisher=[[Princeton University]] |date=2014-05-07 |accessdate=2016-03-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[programming language]]s and [[computer algebra systems]] commonly used for the more mathematical aspects of scientific computing applications include [[GNU Octave]], [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]],&lt;ref name="ars" /&gt; [[Julia (programming language)|Julia]],&lt;ref name="ars" /&gt; [[Maple (software)|Maple]],&lt;ref name="princeton" /&gt; [[Mathematica]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientific-computing.com/products/review_details.php?review_id=17 Mathematica 6] Scientific Computing World, May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[MATLAB]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]] (with third-party [[SciPy]] library), [[Perl]] (with third-party [[Perl Data Language|PDL]] library),{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} [[R (programming language)|R]], [[SciLab]], and [[TK Solver]]. The more computationally intensive aspects of scientific computing will often use some variation of [[C (programming language)|C]] or [[Fortran]] and optimized algebra libraries such as [[BLAS]] or [[LAPACK]].

Computational science application programs often model real-world changing conditions, such as weather, air flow around a plane, automobile body distortions in a crash, the motion of stars in a galaxy, an explosive device, etc. Such programs might create a 'logical mesh' in computer memory where each item corresponds to an area in space and contains information about that space relevant to the model. For example, in weather models, each item might be a square kilometer; with land elevation, current wind direction, humidity, temperature, pressure, etc. The program would calculate the likely next state based on the current state, in simulated time steps, solving equations that describe how the system operates; and then repeat the process to calculate the next state.

==Conferences and journals==

In the year 2001, the [http://www.iccs-meeting.org/ ''International Conference on Computational Science (ICCS)''] was first organised. Since then it has been organised yearly. ICCS is an '''A-rank''' conference in CORE classification.

==Education==
At some institutions a specialization in scientific computation can be earned as a "minor" within another program (which may be at varying levels). However, there are increasingly many [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor's]], [[Master's degree|master's]] and [[doctoral degree|doctoral]] programs in computational science. The joint degree programme [http://www.uva.nl/en/shared-content/subsites/graduate-school-of-sciences/en/masters/computational-science/computational-science.html?origin=5BOaRAofTjCccATraJp2XA master program computational science] at the [[University of Amsterdam]] and the [[Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam|Vrije Universiteit]] in computational science was first offered in 2004. In this programme, students:
* learn to build computational models from real-life observations;
* develop skills in turning these models into computational structures and in performing large-scale simulations;
* learn theory that will give a firm basis for the analysis of complex systems;
* learn to analyse the results of simulations in a virtual laboratory using advanced numerical algorithms.

[[George Mason University]] was one of the early pioneers first offering a multidisciplinary doctorate Ph.D program in Computational Sciences and Informatics in 1992 that focused on a number of specialty areas including [[Bioinformatics|bioinformatics]], [[Computational chemistry|computational chemistry]], earth systems and global changes, [[Computational mathematics|computational mathematics]], [[Computational physics|computational physics]], space sciences, and [[Computational statistics|computational statistics]]

The [[hypothesis]] of '''effective evolutionary time'''&lt;ref name="Latitudinal gradients(1992)"&gt;K. Rohde: Latitudinal gradients in species diversity: the search for the primary cause, Oikos, 65, 514-527,1992.&lt;/ref&gt; attempts to explain gradients, in particular latitudinal gradients, in species diversity. It was originally named "time hypothesis".&lt;ref name="Latitudinal gradients(1978a)"&gt;K. Rohde: Latitudinal gradients in species diversity and their causes. I. A review of the hypotheses explaining the gradients. Biologisches Zentralblatt 97, 393-403, 1978a.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Latitudinal gradients(1978b)"&gt;K. Rohde: Latitudinal gradients in species diversity and their causes. II. Marine parasitological evidence for a time hypothesis. Biologisches Zentralblatt 97, 405-418, 1978b.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Low (warm) latitudes contain significantly more species than high (cold) latitudes. This has been shown for many animal and plant groups, although exceptions exist (see [[latitudinal gradients in species diversity]]). An example of an exception is [[helminths]] of marine mammals, which have the greatest diversity in northern temperate seas, possibly because of small population densities of hosts in tropical seas that prevented the evolution of a rich helminth fauna, or because they originated in temperate seas and had more time for speciations there. It has become more and more apparent that species diversity is best correlated with environmental temperature and more generally environmental energy. These findings are the basis of the hypothesis of effective evolutionary time. Species have accumulated fastest in areas where temperatures are highest. [[Mutation rates]] and [[speed of selection]] due to faster physiological rates are highest, and generation times which also determine speed of selection, are smallest at high temperatures. This leads to a faster accumulation of species, which are absorbed into the abundantly available [[vacant niches]], in the tropics. Vacant niches are available at all latitudes, and differences in the number of such niches can therefore not be the limiting factor for species richness. The hypothesis also incorporates a time factor: habitats with a long undisturbed evolutionary history will have greater diversity than habitats exposed to disturbances in evolutionary history.

The hypothesis of effective evolutionary time offers a causal explanation of diversity gradients, although it is recognized that many other factors can also contribute to and modulate them.

==Historical aspects==

Some aspects of the hypothesis are based on earlier studies. [[Bernhard Rensch]],&lt;ref&gt;B. Rensch: Neuere Probleme der Abstammungslehre. Die transspezifische Evolution. Encke, Stuttgart, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; for example, stated that evolutionary rates also depend on temperature: numbers of generation in [[poikilotherm]]s, but sometimes also in homoiotherms ([[homoiothermic]]), are greater at higher temperatures and the effectiveness of selection is therefore greater. Ricklefs refers to this hypothesis as "hypothesis of evolutionary speed" or "higher speciation rates".&lt;ref&gt;R.E. Ricklefs: Ecology. Nelson and Sons, London, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; Genera of Foraminifera in the Cretaceous and families of Brachiopoda in the Permian have greater evolutionary rates at low than at high latitudes.&lt;ref&gt;F.G. Stehli, E.G. Douglas and N.D. Newell:  Generation and maintenance of gradients in taxonomic diversity. Science 164, 947-949, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; That mutation rates are greater at high temperatures has been known since the classical investigations of [[Nikolay Timofeev-Ressovsky|Timofeev-Ressovsky]] et al. (1935),&lt;ref&gt;N.W. [[Timofeeff-Ressovsky]], K.G. Zimmer und M. DelbrÃ¼ck: Ãber die Natur der Genmutation und der Genstruktur. Nachrichten aus der Biologie der Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften GÃ¶ttingen I, 189-245, 1935.&lt;/ref&gt; although few later studies have been conducted. Also, these findings were not applied to evolutionary problems.

The hypothesis of effective evolutionary time differs from these earlier approaches as follows. It proposes that species diversity is a direct consequence of temperature-dependent processes and the time ecosystems have existed under more or less equal conditions. Since vacant niches into which new species can be absorbed are available at all latitudes, the consequence is accumulation of more species at low latitudes.&lt;ref name ="Latitudinal gradients(1992)"/&gt; All earlier approaches remained without basis without the assumption of vacant niches, as there is no evidence that niches are generally narrower in the tropics, i.e., an accumulation of species cannot be explained by subdivision of previously utilized niches (see also [[Rapoport's rule]]). The hypothesis, in contrast to most other hypotheses attempting to explain latitudinal or other gradients in diversity, does not rely on the assumption that different latitudes or habitats generally have different "ceilings" for species numbers, which are higher in the tropics than in cold environments.  Such different ceilings are thought to be, for example, determined by heterogeneity or area of the habitat. But  such factors, although not setting ceilings, may well modulate the gradients.

==Recent studies==

A considerable number of recent studies support the hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Nonequilibrium Ecology(1992)"&gt;K. Rohde: ''[http://www.cambridge.org/9780521674553 Nonequilibrium Ecology]'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2005b, 223 pp. {{ISBN|0-521-67455-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, diversity of marine [[benthos]], interrupted by some collapses and plateaus, has risen from the Cambrian to the Recent, and  there is no evidence that saturation has been reached.&lt;ref&gt;D.Jablonski: The future of the fossil record, Science 284, 2114-2116, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Rates of diversification per time unit for birds and butterflies increase towards the tropics.&lt;ref&gt;M. Cardillo: Latitude and rates of diversification in birds and butterflies. Proceedings of the Royal Society London 266, 1221-1225,1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Allen et al. found a general correlation between environmental temperature and species richness for North and Central American trees, for amphibians, fish, Prosobranchia and fish parasites. They showed that species richness can be predicted from the biochemical kinetics of metabolism, and concluded that evolutionary rates are determined by generation times and mutation rates both correlated with metabolic rates which have the same Boltzmann relation with temperature. They further concluded that these findings support the mechanisms for latitudinal gradients proposed by Rohde.&lt;ref&gt;A.P. Allen, J.H. Brown, and J.F. Gillooly: Global biodiversity, biochemical kinetics, and the energetic-equivalence rule. Science, 297, 1545-1548, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Gillooly et al. (2002) described a general model also based on first principles of allometry and biochemical kinetics which makes predictions about generation times as a function of body size and temperature.&lt;ref&gt;J.F. Gillooly, E.L. Charnov, G.B. West,  M.Van Savage, and J.H. Brown: Effects of size and temperature on developmental time. Nature 417, 70â73, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Empirical findings support the predictions: in all cases that were investigated (birds, fish, amphibians, aquatic insects, zooplankton) generation times are negatively correlated with temperature. Brown et al.(2004) further developed these findings to a general metabolic theory of ecology.&lt;ref&gt;J.H. Brown, J.F. Gillooly, A.P. Allen, M. Van Savage, and G.. West,. (2004). [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1890/03-9000 Toward a metabolic theory of ecology]. Ecology 85, 1771-1789.&lt;/ref&gt; Indirect evidence points to increased mutation rates at higher temperatures,&lt;ref&gt;C. Bazin, P. Capy, D. Higuet, and T. Langin, T.: SÃ©quences dâAND mobiles et Ã©volution du gÃ©nome. Pour Sci., Hors. SÃ©r. Janvier 97, 106-109., 1997 (zitiert in. Harmelin-Vivien 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M.L. Harmelin-Vivien: Energetics and fish diversity on coral reefs. In: Sale, P.F. Hrsg. Coral reef fishes. Dynamics and diversity in a complex ecosystem.

Ward and M.Yuan: Energy gradients and the geographical distribution of local ant diversity. [[Oecologia]] 140, 407-413, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, computer simulations using the Chowdhury eosystem model have shown that results correspond most closely to empirical data when the number of vacant niches is kept large.&lt;ref&gt;K. Rohde and D. Stauffer: "Simulation of geographical trends in Chowdhury ecosystem model", Advances in Complex Systems 8, 451-464, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Rohde gives detailed discussions of these and other examples.&lt;ref name="Nonequilibrium Ecology(1992)"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K. Rohde: Eine neue Ãkologie. Aktuelle Probleme der evolutionÃ¤ren Ãkologie". Naturwissenschaftliche Rundschau, 58, 420-426, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular importance is the study by Wright et al. (2006) which was specifically designed to test the hypothesis. It showed that molecular substitution rates of tropical woody plants are more than twice as large as those of temperate species, and that more effective [[genetic drift]] in smaller tropical populations cannot be responsible for the differences, leaving only direct temperature effects on mutation rates as an explanation.&lt;ref&gt;S. Wright, J.  Keeling  and L. Gillman 2006.  The road from Santa Rosalia: a faster tempo of evolution in tropical climates. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 103, 7718 â7722.&lt;/ref&gt; Gillman et al. (2009) examined 260 mammal species of 10 orders and 29 families and found that substitution rates in the cytochrome B gene were substantially faster in species at warm latitudes and elevations, compared with those from cold latitudes and elevations. A critical examination of the data showed that this cannot be attributed to gene drift or body mass differentials. The only possibilities left are a Red Queen effect or direct effects of thermal gradients (including possibly an effect of torpor/hibernation differentials). Rohde (1992, 1978) had already pointed out that âit may well be that mammalian diversity is entirely determined by the diversity of plants and poikilothermic animals further down in the hierarchyâ, i.e., by a Red Queen effect. He also pointed out that exposure to irradiation including light is known to cause mutations in mammals, and that some homoiothermic animals have shorter generation times in the tropics, which - either separately or jointly - may explain the effect found by Gillman et al.&lt;ref&gt;Gillman, L.N., Keeling, D.J., Ross,H.A. and Wright, S.D. 2009. Latitude, elevation and the tempo of molecular evolution in mammals. Proceedings of the Royal Society B 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Gillman et al. (2010) extended their earlier study on plants &lt;ref&gt;S. Wright, J.  Keeling  and L. Gillman. 2006.  The road from Santa Rosalia: a faster tempo of evolution in tropical climates. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 103, 7718 â7722.&lt;/ref&gt; by determining whether the effect is also found within highly conserved DNA. They examined the 18S ribosomal gene in the same 45 pairs of plants. And indeed, the rate of evolution was 51% faster in the tropical than their temperate sister species. Furthermore, the substitution rate in 18S correlated positively with that in the more variable ITS. These result lend further very strong support to the hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;Gillman L.N., Keeling D.J., Gardner R.C., Wright S.D. Faster evolution of highly conserved DNA in tropical plants. Journal of evolutionary Biology 23, 1327-1330,2010&lt;/ref&gt; Wright et al. (2010) tested the hypothesis on 188 species of amphibians belonging to 18 families, using mitochondrial RNA genes 12S and 16S, and found substantially faster substitution rates for species living in warmer habitats at both lower latitudes and lower elevations.&lt;ref&gt;Wright S.D., Gillman L.N., Ross H.A. and Keeling D.J. Energy and tempo of evolution in amphibians. Global Ecology and Biogeography 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the hypothesis has now been confirmed for several genes and for plants and animals.

VÃ¡zquez, D.P. and Stevens, R.D. (2004) conducted a metaanalysis of previous studies and found no  evidence that niches are generally narrower in the tropics than at high latitudes.&lt;ref&gt;VÃ¡zquez, D.P. and Stevens, R.D. The latitudinal gradient in niche breadth: concepts and evidence. American Naturalist 164, E1- E19, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be explained only by the assumption that niche space was not and is not saturated, having the capacity to absorb new species without affecting the niche width of species already present, as predicted by the hypothesis.

==Depth gradients==

Species diversity in the deepsea has been largely underestimated until recently (e.g., Briggs 1994: total marine diversity less than 200,000 species).&lt;ref&gt;J. C.Briggs. Species diversity: land and sea compared. Systematic Biology 43, 130-135, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Although our knowledge is still very fragmentary, some recent studies appear to suggest much greater species numbers (e.g., Grassle and Maciolek 1992: 10 million macroinvertebrates in soft bottom sediments of the deepsea).&lt;ref&gt;J F. Grassle and N .J. Maciolek: Deepsea species richness: regional and local diversity estimates from, quantitative bottom samples. American Naturalist 139, 313-341, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Further studies must show whether this can be verified.&lt;ref&gt;K. Rohde: Ecology and biogeography of marine parasites. Advances in marine biology 43,1-86, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; A rich diversity in the deepsea can be explained by the hypothesis of effective evolutionary time: although temperatures are low, conditions have been more or less equal over large time spans, certainly much larger than in most or all surface waters.

'''NCF-Envirothon''' is an annual [[environmental movement|environmentally themed]] [[academic]] competition for high school aged students organized by the NCF-Envirothon a program of the National Conservation Foundation. The competition is held by the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] on a regional, state, and bi-national level. Envirothon combines in-class and hands-on environmental education&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canadian Forestry Association New Brunswick|url=http://www.cfanb.ca/the_envirothon_experience|publisher=CFANB|accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in a competition setting which involves a problem-solving presentation as well as written field tests. The competition tests students on five core subjects- [[aquatic ecology]], [[forestry]], [[soils|soils and land use]], [[wildlife]]- along with a fifth annually-changing subtopic which focuses on relevant environmental issues. Currently, roughly 500,000 students from forty-five U.S. states and nine Canadian provinces/territories participate in the competition.&lt;ref name = "canon enviro"&gt;{{Citation

  | year = 2008
  | url = http://envirothon.vologon.com/index.php }}&lt;/ref&gt;

States and provinces across the United States and Canada each have their own local competitions from which the winning high school team earns the privilege of representing their state/province at the NCF-Envirothon competition, held each summer in a different U.S. state or Canadian province. In areas with a considerable number of teams, subdivisions such as county, regional, or district competitions are also held.  Teams must win these intermediary competitions in order to move on to the state/province levels.

==Organizers and Sponsors==
The NCF-Envirothon is a [[501(c) organization|501(c)3]] [[Nonprofit organization]] headquartered in Washington,D.C. Coordinating the delivery of the North American competition, the organization also relies heavily on volunteers across North America to advise individual teams from each participating state and province.&lt;ref name="Envirothon: About Us"&gt;{{cite web|title=North American Envirothon: About Us|url=http://www.envirothon.org/about-us.html|publisher=North American Envirothon|accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governing the program is the National Conservation Foundation (NCF) Executive, along with a NCF-Evirothon Operating Committee which is made up of representatives from participating states and provinces.&lt;ref name="History of Envirothon" /&gt;

Envirothon is sponsored by the [[National Natural Resources Conservation Foundation|National Conservation Foundation]], the [[Conservation district|National Association of Conservation Districts]], the [[United States Forest Service]], and the [[Natural Resources Conservation Service]].&lt;ref name="Envirothon: Sponsors"&gt;{{cite web|title=North American Envirothon: Sponsors|url=http://www.envirothon.org/sponsors.html|publisher=North American Envirothon|accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Individual teams are often sponsored by school clubs or classes, local businesses and governments, or [[4H]] and other such non-scholastic organizations.&lt;ref name="canon enviro" /&gt;

==Competition==

Competition participants are generally teams of five students with one to two team advisers. Home-schoolers can also take part as their own team.
[[File:Envirothon Training 2012.jpg|thumb|Training Session During the 2012 Envirothon Competition.&lt;ref name="canon enviro" /&gt;]]

States and provinces across the United States and Canada each have their own local competitions from which the winning high school team earns the privilege of representing their state/province at the North American Envirothon Competition, held each summer in a different U.S. state or Canadian province. In regions with a considerable number of teams, competitions on subdivision, county, regional, or district levels are also held.  Teams must win these intermediary competitions in order to move on to the state/province levels. At the North American Competition, teams that rank first through tenth receive prizes and scholarships of various values.&lt;ref name="canon enviro" /&gt;

Competition week at the NCF-Envirothon level includes various workshops, field trips, and seminars led by professionals and educators for both the students and their advisors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canadian Forestry Association|url=http://www.canadianforestry.com/html/education/envirothon_e.html|publisher=CFA|accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these outings are linked to the current issue topic and provide information on the area in which the competition is being held.

During the competition, each team must complete five written field tests, each dealing with a different topic. These tests consist of various question types, including identifications and hands-on assessments. Each team must also prepare an oral presentation on the current issue topic, which the team presents to a panel of judges. An important element of the competition is the understanding that each topic is interrelated, and understanding human effects on the environment and how human activities connect with ecosystem functions. Each test is scored out of 100 points, with the presentation being scored out of 200 points. The team with the highest cumulative total of points at the end of the scoring is the winning team. Recognition is also given to teams with the highest scoring in each of the five categories.&lt;ref name="canon enviro" /&gt;

===Competition locations===
The location of the North American competition is determined based on a regional map that separates North America into five general regions: Far West, Mid-West, Southeast, Northeast, and Far North. The host college or university is usually located in a different region than that of the year preceding it.&lt;ref name="Future Competitions"&gt;{{cite web|title=Envirothon: Future Competitions|url=http://www.envirothon.org/the-competition/future-competitions.html|publisher=North American Envirothon|accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, a competition (2013) was held in at [[Montana State University]] in [[Bozeman, Montana]] in the Far West.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=MSU picked as site for 2014 NCF-Envirothon competition|url=http://www.bozemandailychronicle.com/news/montana_state_university/article_1e391598-11ce-11e2-a7f7-0019bb2963f4.html|publisher=Bozeman Daily Chronicle|accessdate=20 November 2012|date=October 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2015 Competition===
The 2015 NCF-Envirothon competition will be held July 27-August 7, and hosted at [[Missouri State University]] in [[Springfield, Missouri]]. 45 states and 9 Canadian provinces and Territories will registered for the competition. The current Issue Topic for that year's competition is Urban/Community Forestry. This will be the second time that the state of [[Missouri]] Missouri Envirothon hosts the NCF-Envirothon Competition.&lt;ref name="Present Competition"&gt;{{cite web|title=Montana to Host North Americaâs Largest High School Natural Resource Competition|url=http://www.roundupweb.com/story/2012/09/26/news/montana-to-host-north-americas-largest-high-school-natural-resource-competition/1316.html|publisher=Roundup Web|accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competition Topics==
{{More references|section|date=January 2015}}

Each field test dealing with one of five competition topics requires both theoretical understandings and hand-on skills such as identification and chemical testing. Each topic also has a degree of relatedness to one another, which is sometimes considered in theoretical-based test questions.&lt;ref name="canon enviro" /&gt;

===Aquatic Ecology===
[[File:Envirothon Aquatic Ecology Test.jpg|thumb|Aquatic Ecology Testing at the 2011 Envirothon Competition.&lt;ref name="canon enviro" /&gt;]]

==History==
In 1979 the Pennsylvania Soil and Water Conservation Districts set up the Environmental Olympics, later renamed Enviro-Olympics, to encourage interest in environmental issues through hands-on competition.&lt;ref name="History of Envirothon"&gt;{{cite web|title=History Of Envirothon|url=http://www.envirothon.org/pdf/history.pdf|publisher=North American Envirothon|accessdate=8 November 2012|author=April Smith|date=2 November 2010|year=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Expanding rapidly to include forty conservation districts by 1987, it gained attention from other states, and in 1988, the program became the National Envirothon, with participation from Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and Ohio. In 1992 Nova Scotia became the first Canadian province to join the competition. The competition was sponsored by various state, local, and provincial conservation programs and associations until 1997 when [[Canon (company)|Canon Inc.]] began its support of the program, with local sponsors still supporting lower level competitions.&lt;ref name="canon enviro" /&gt; In 1999 Canon became the title sponsor of the competition between the U.S. states and Canadian provinces, with the competition being renamed the "Canon Envirothon." It is currently referred to as the "NCF-Envirothon."&lt;ref name="canon enviro" /&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''''Extermination of Evil'''''|è¾éªçµµ|Hekija-E}} is a set of five paintings depicting [[List of Asian mythologies|traditional Asian deities]] banishing evil. The paintings are collectively listed as a [[List of National Treasures of Japan (paintings)|National Treasure of Japan]] and held at the [[Nara National Museum]].

==Overview==
The paintings are thought to have been created during the 12th century, during the reign of [[Emperor Go-Shirakawa]] in the [[Heian period]];{{sfn|e-Museum, Extermination of Evil}} they may have also been produced during the Kamakura period.{{sfn|Bunka.nii.ac.jp, ç´æ¬èè²è¾éªçµµ}} The [[Japanese calligraphy|calligrapher]] is thought to be the same on the five scrolls as on the [[Hell Scroll (Tokyo National Museum)|Hell Scroll]] and the Demon of Punishment,{{sfn|e-Museum, Extermination of Evil}} which were produced at roughly the same time.{{sfn|Bunka.nii.ac.jp, ç´æ¬èè²è¾éªçµµ}} They are thought to have originally been a single handscroll,{{sfn|e-Museum, Extermination of Evil}}{{sfn|Bunka.nii.ac.jp, ç´æ¬èè²è¾éªçµµ}} known as the "second edition of the Masuda family Hell Scroll", that was stored in the RengeÅ-in Temple (now [[SanjÅ«sangen-dÅ]]). The paintings depict five benevolent deities in combat against evil, as represented by demons; the deities come from several cultures, including contemporary [[Japanese culture|Japanese]], [[Chinese culture|Chinese]], and [[Indian culture|Indian]]. They are thought to be associated with the Hell Transformation Screens then used in [[Nara Prefecture|Nara]] for repentance ceremonies at the end of each year, where the devout recited the names of the buddhas at [[HeijÅ Palace]].{{sfn|e-Museum, Extermination of Evil}}

A "'''flip-flop'''" (used mostly in the United States), '''U-turn''' (used in the [[politics of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Pakistan]]), or '''backflip''' (used in Australia and New Zealand) is a sudden real or apparent change of policy or opinion by a public official, sometimes while trying to claim that both positions are consistent with each other. Often it will occur during the period prior to or following an election in order to maximize the candidate's popularity.

==History==

In his "On Language" column in ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[William Safire]] wrote in 1988 that "flip-flop" has a long history as a synonym for "somersault". (He cited George Lorimer in 1902: "...when a fellow's turning flip-flops up among the clouds, he's naturally going to have the farmers gaping at him.") In the late 19th century, a US politician was called "the Florida flopper" by an opponent, Safire noted. The "fl" sound appearing twice is an indication of ridicule, he wrote. Citing grammarian Randolph Quirk, Safire pointed out that the doubling of the sound is also a feature in other two-word phrases used to disparage the actions or words of others, including "[[mumbo jumbo (phrase)|mumbo jumbo]]", "wishy-washy", and higgledy-piggledy".&lt;ref name="wsonnyt"&gt;Saffire, William, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE3D6113DF930A25750C0A96E948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all "Phantom of the Phrases "], "On Language" column, ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'', March 13, 1988 (comment from Wicker is as quoted by Safire), retrieved June 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In the archives of ''The New York Times'', which go back to 1851, the earliest unequivocal mention of "flip-flop" as a change in someone's opinion, is in an October 23, 1890, report of a campaign speech in New York City. John W. Goff, candidate for district attorney, said of one of his opponents: "I would like to hear Mr. Nicoll explain his great flip-flop, for three years ago, you know, as the Republican candidate for District Attorney, he bitterly denounced [[Tammany Hall|Tammany]] as a party run by bosses and in the interest of bossism.... Nicoll, who three years ago was denouncing Tammany, is its candidate to-day."&lt;ref&gt;No byline, [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1890/10/23/103273441.pdf "Mighty cheers for Scott / A great meeting in Cooper Union last night."], news article, ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 23, 1890, retrieved from ''Times'' subscription archives June 23, 2008 (sometimes accessible without subscription)&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was also used in 1967, when a ''New York Times'' editorial and ''Times'' columnist [[Tom Wicker]] used it in commenting on different events. It was also in the [[U.S. Presidential election, 1976|1976 election]], when President [[Gerald Ford]] used the phrase against his opponent [[Jimmy Carter]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/search/query?query=flip-flop&amp;srchst=p Search results for "flip-flop"], ''[[New York Times]]'' archives, 1850â1981, retrieved June 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988 U.S. presidential election]], [[Michael Dukakis]] used the term against opponent [[Richard Gephardt]], saying, "There's a flip-flopper over here" about Gephardt.&lt;ref name="wsonnyt" /&gt;

The term also was used extensively in the [[2004 U.S. presidential election]] campaign. It was used by critics as a catch-phrase attack on [[John Kerry]], claiming he was "flip-flopping" his stance on several issues, including the ongoing war in Iraq. Famously, on March 16, 2004, during an appearance at [[Marshall University]] Kerry tried to explain his vote for an $87 billion supplemental appropriation for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan by telling the crowd, "I actually did vote for the $87 billion, before I voted against it." After the remark became controversial, he explained that he had supported an earlier Democratic measure that would have paid for the $87 billion in war funding by reducing Bush's tax cuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kerry discusses $87 billion comment |url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/09/30/kerry.comment/ |publisher=CNN |id= |date=September 30, 2004 |accessdate=November 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[FactCheck]] stated that "Kerry has never wavered from his support for giving Bush authority to use force in Iraq, nor has he changed his position that he, as President, would not have gone to war without greater international support."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.factcheck.org/bush_ad_twists_kerrys_words_on_iraq.html FactCheck.org: Bush Ad Twists Kerry's Words on Iraq] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209150357/http://www.factcheck.org/bush_ad_twists_kerrys_words_on_iraq.html |date=February 9, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "U-turn" in the United Kingdom was famously applied to [[Edward Heath]], the [[prime minister of the United Kingdom]] from 1970 to 1974. Prior to the [[United Kingdom general election, 1970|1970 general election]], the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] compiled a [[manifesto]] that highlighted [[free-market]] economic policies. Heath abandoned such policies when his government nationalised [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] (hence the actual "U-turn"). The Conservative government was later attacked for such a move because [[nationalisation]] was seen (by the [[Thatcherism|Thatcher era]]) as antithetical to Conservative beliefs. This later led to one of [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s most famous phrases: "[[The lady's not for turning|you turn [U-turn] if you want to. The lady's not for turning]]". The Conservatives would adopt the free market under her.

==Exculpatory, ameliorating and aggravating circumstances affecting public reaction==

The circumstances surrounding the flip-flop and its larger context can be crucial factors in whether or not a politician is hurt or helped more by a change in position. "Long hailed as a conservative champion, [[Ronald Reagan]] could shrug off his support of a tax increase in 1982 to curb the budget deficits his 1981 tax cut had exacerbated," according to an analysis of flip-flopping in ''The New York Times''. "Long suspect on the Republican right, [[George H. W. Bush|George [H. W.] Bush]] faced a crippling 1992 primary challenge after abandoning his 'no new taxes' campaign pledge in the White House."&lt;ref name="jhnyt"&gt;Harwood, John, [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/23/us/politics/23caucus.html "Flip-Flops Are Looking Like a Hot Summer Trend"], "The Caucus" feature, ''The New York Times'', June 23, 2008, retrieved same day&lt;/ref&gt;

Kerry's perceived equivocation on the Iraq war damaged his 2004 campaign, according to both Democratic and Republican political operatives. "It spoke to a pattern of calculation and indecisiveness that make him look like a weak commander in chief compared to [George W.] Bush", said Jonathan Prince, a strategist for 2008 presidential candidate [[John Edwards]], Kerry's running mate in 2004. In the 2008 primary season, Edwards simply stated that "I was wrong" when he had voted in the U.S. Senate to authorize the Iraq War. "Progressives loved it because it was taking responsibility, not abdicating it," according to Prince.&lt;ref name="jhnyt" /&gt;

United States commentator [[Jim Geraghty]] has written that politicians need to be allowed some leeway in changing their minds as the result of changing conditions. "I actually think that a candidate can even change his position in response to a changing political environment, as long as they're honest about it. 'The votes just aren't there, public support isn't there, so I have to put this proposal on the back burner for a while,' is a perfectly legitimate response to a difficult position."&lt;ref&gt;Geraghty, Jim, [http://campaignspot.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MmVmYzM2NTEwZWI5MTI1ODgyNmUyZGMzMDU0ZTgyNzU= "Measuring the Flip-Flops"]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} post at "The Campaign Spot" blog at the "National Review Online" website, June 23, 2008, 12:32&amp;nbsp;pm post, accessed same day{{Dead link|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same general point was made in 1988 by ''New York Times'' editorial columnist [[Tom Wicker]], writing shortly after Dukakis' charge against Gephardt. Wicker commented that the accusation was not necessarily fair: "What's wrong with a Presidential candidate changing his position â though his opponents call it 'flip-flopping' â in order to improve his chances of winning? Nothing's wrong with it [...] unless the flipper [...] denies having done it," Wicker added that the charge can be "a tortured or dishonest interpretation of an opponent's record".&lt;ref name="wsonnyt" /&gt;

"[T]here's a difference between changing your policy position and breaking a promise," [[John Dickerson (journalist)|John Dickerson]], wrote in ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' online magazine. "Breaking a promise is a problem of a higher order than changing a policy position. Our mothers told us not to break promises [...]"&lt;ref&gt;Dickerson, John, [http://www.slate.com/id/2194083?nav=wp "The Flip-Flop Brothers: Both McCain and Obama wobbled. Who will pay the price?"], ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine, June 20, 2008, 6:32&amp;nbsp;pm Eastern Time, retrieved June 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

James Pethokoukis, the "money and politics blogger" for ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' online, referring to 2008 presidential candidate [[John McCain]], noted that in changing a position a candidate can "trot out that famous [[John Maynard Keynes]] line, 'When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?'"&lt;ref&gt;Pethoukoukis, James, [https://www.usnews.com/blogs/capital-commerce/2008/6/16/7-ways-mccain-can-use-energy-to-beat-obama.html "7 Ways McCain Can Use Energy to Beat Obama"], "Capital Commerce" blog, ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' online, June 16, 2008, 01:02&amp;nbsp;pm ET, retrieved June 23, 2008{{Dead link|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Keynes quote also has been mentioned by other commentators with regard to flip-flops, including James Broder, in a 2007 article in the ''[[International Herald-Tribune]]''.&lt;ref name="jbiht"&gt;Broder, John M., [http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=140971 "In past, clues to way Fed chief met mortgage crisis"], ''[[The International Herald-Tribune]]'', August 19, 2007, retrieved June 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-political use==
Outside politics the use of the term is not as pejorative. A scientist or mathematician can often obtain some experimental results or logical proofs which causes one to flip flop on a previously held belief. Example: "I always assumed that there was an infinity, that all infinite numbers were equal, but I have flip flopped on that since I saw Georg Cantor's proof." Lewis Eigen, in his essay on the cultural difference between politics and scientists, observes, "To the scientist, failure to flip-flop in the face of contradictory evidence is irrational and dangerous behavior. And scientists will often flip-flop at almost light speed. Often it takes only a single observation to flip-flop thousands of scientifically learned people."&lt;ref&gt;Lewis D. Eigen, "Flip-Flop: Political ViceâScientific Virtue". ''Scriptamus'', 2009, http://scriptamus.wordpress.com/2009/10/23/flip-flop-political-vice-scientific-virtue/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''GESIS â Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences''' headquartered in [[Mannheim]] with a location in [[Cologne]] is the largest German infrastructure institute for the [[social sciences]]. With basic research-based services and consulting covering all levels of the scientific process, GESIS supports researchers in the social sciences. As of 2017, the president of GESIS is Christof Wolf.

GESIS is part of the [[Leibniz Association]] and receives federal and state funding.

== History ==
Established in 1986 as ''German Social Science Infrastructure Services'' (German: "Gesellschaft Sozialwissenschaftlicher Infrastruktureinrichtungen"), GESIS originally consisted of the three independent institutes Social Science Information Centre (IZ) in Bonn, Central Archive for Empirical Social Research in Cologne (ZA), and Centre for Survey Research and Methodology (ZUMA) in Mannheim.

In 2007 the three GESIS institutes merged into one. In November 2008 GESIS added "Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences" to its name in order to emphasize its membership in the Leibniz Association.

In November 2011, GESIS Bonn and Cologne were merged into one location in Cologne.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14408">[[Rugby league]] is a full contact football code and spectator sport played in various countries around the world and governed by the [[Rugby League International Federation]]. As of 2010 there are currently 27 nations fielding domestic leagues that meet the World Cup eligibility requirements. Further to this there are over 30 others that are playing at an emerging level status at varying degrees of international competition and are in the process of developing the game in their nations. The global player pool is estimated to be in the millions.

Although one of the last football codes to be developed, since the modern 1990's professional era the game has expanded outside of its traditionals heartlands in [[Australia]], [[England]], [[France]] and [[New Zealand]]. As a result, many players of European, American and Pacific Islander background have risen to the top professional level in the two major domestic leagues, the [[National Rugby League]] and [[Super League]].

Whilst individual international test matches between nations have been staged regularly since the sport's inception in 1908, the first multi-national tournament was held in France in [[1954 Rugby League World Cup|1954]], making it the first World Cup of either [[rugby football|rugby code]] and the first to be officially known as the "Rugby World Cup".&lt;ref name="Folkard03-337"&gt;[[#Folkard2003|Folkard, 2003]]: 337&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SPARC-2009-p28"&gt;[[#SPARC-2009|SPARC, 2009]]: 28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Africa==
{{main|Rugby league in Africa}}
Rugby league is a growing sport in Africa, with the game first introduced to the continent in the early 2017. The vast distance of teams from the game's heartlands has at times affected the development of the sport but new advances in the 21st century have seen a major increase in the number of internationals scheduled. Many high calibre players from the continent have progressed to the top club leagues, including [[Younes Khattabi]], [[Jamal Fakir]], [[Tom van Vollenhoven]], [[Fred Griffiths (rugby league)|Fred Griffiths]] and [[Jarrod Saffy]]. The large ex-patriate Moroccan population in the south of France has resulted in a growing interchange of players between the two countries. Rugby league in Africa is played in [[South Africa]], [[Gambia]],&lt;ref&gt;https://warringtonwolves.com/rfl-news/the-full-blood-project/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Morocco]], [[Burundi]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Ghana]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rlef.eu.com/south_africa/introduction&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rlef.eu.com/morocco_xiii/introduction&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rlef.eu.com/news/article/564/ghana-rugby-league-takes-to&lt;/ref&gt;

==Americas==
{{main|Rugby league in the Americas}}
[[Rugby league]] is a growing sport in the Americas, having first started with All Star exhibition matches in the 1950s. It has been played at an organised semi-professional level in North America since it was first introduced as a competition sport in the 1990s. There are currently domestic leagues operating in [[Jamaica]], [[Canada]] and the [[United States]]. Many players of Caribbean heritage live and play in the European [[Super League]] and have brought their skills back to the islands to foster the development of thousands of new players. The game is also played at a lower amateur level across the Americas by ex-patriates although only recognised national organisations are listed here for brevity.

Canada currently has two domesitic competitions, Ontario and British Columbia, with British Columbia being the premier competition with also the most teams.  British Columbia Rugby League (BCRL) also has a provincial team known as the BC Bulldogs.  In 2012, the BC Bulldogs competed against Utah Avalanche from Salt Lake who currently play in the AMNRL.  The game was contested over two legs, home and away, with BC taking both games.  The BC Bulldogs also made an appearance at the Las Vegas Remembrance Cup and come third. Coogee Bay Dolphins from [[Australia]] took out the competition for the second time in a row.

In 2013, BCRL will be made up of 6 teams, namely Bayside Sharks, Kelowna Crows, Richmond Bears, Sea to Sky Eagles, Surrey Beavers and Vancouver Dragons.

Brazil has also taken up the sport in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.portaldorugby.com.br/noticia/25-brasil/7138-rugby-league-reina-em-baixo-guandu |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627210112/http://www.portaldorugby.com.br/noticia/25-brasil/7138-rugby-league-reina-em-baixo-guandu |archivedate=2013-06-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2013 the [[Latin Heat Rugby League]] has had moderate success in introducing rugby League to players with Latin American heritage living in Australia. In 2014 the Latin Heat opened a U.S chapter.

==Asia and the Middle East==
Rugby league is a growing sport in Asia and the Middle East, with a large growth in players since the 1990s, some of which have played at the game's elite levels in the [[National Rugby League]] and [[Super League]]. The game in the Middle East is one of the fastest growing sports with regular internationals played against European and Mediterranean teams.

The '''Group of Seven''', also sometimes known as '''the Algonquin School''', was a group of Canadian landscape painters from 1920 to 1933, originally consisting of [[Franklin Carmichael]] (1890â1945), [[Lawren Harris]] (1885â1970), [[A.&amp;nbsp;Y. Jackson]] (1882â1974), [[Frank Johnston (artist)|Frank Johnston]] (1888â1949), [[Arthur Lismer]] (1885â1969), [[J.&amp;nbsp;E.&amp;nbsp;H. MacDonald]] (1873â1932), and [[Frederick Varley]] (1881â1969). Later, [[A.&amp;nbsp;J. Casson]] (1898â1992) was invited to join in 1926, [[Edwin Holgate]] (1892â1977) became a member in 1930, and [[LeMoine FitzGerald]] (1890â1956) joined in 1932.

Two artists commonly associated with the group are [[Tom Thomson]] (1877â1917) and [[Emily Carr]] (1871â1945). Although he died before its official formation, Thomson had a significant influence on the group.  In his essay "The Story of the Group of Seven", Harris wrote that Thomson was "a part of the movement before we pinned a label on it"; Thomson's paintings ''[[The West Wind (painting)|The West Wind]]'' and ''[[The Jack Pine]]'' are two of the group's most iconic pieces.&lt;ref name="Silcox"&gt;{{Citation|last=Silcox|first=David|title=The Group of Seven and Tom Thomson|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rm5yQgAACAAJ&amp;dq=silcox+the+group+of+seven+and+tom+thomson|publisher=Firefly Books, 2003|accessdate=19 October 2011|isbn=9781552976050|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emily Carr]] was also closely associated with the Group of Seven, though never an official member.

Believing that a distinct Canadian art could be developed through direct contact with nature,&lt;ref name='Housser'&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Housser | first1 = F. B. | title = A Canadian Art Movement | year = 1926 | location = Toronto, Ontario | page = 24}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Group of Seven is best known for its paintings inspired by the Canadian landscape, and initiated the first major Canadian national art movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Chilvers, Ian|first=Glaves-Smith, John|title=Group of Seven|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t5.e1084|work=A Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=18 October 2011|postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Group was succeeded by the [[Canadian Group of Painters]] in 1933, which included members from the [[Beaver Hall Group]] who had a history of showing with the Group of Seven internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meadowcroft|first1=Barbara|title=Painting friends: the Beaver Hall women painters|date=1999|publisher=VÃ©hicule Press|location=Montreal, Quebec, Canada|isbn=1-55065-125-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Harris, Lawren;|first=Murray, Joan|title=The Best of the Group of Seven|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O96YPpkHUGEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=the+best+of+the+group+of+seven+joan+murray#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=McClelland &amp; Stewart, 1993|accessdate=19 October 2011|isbn=9780771066740|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections==
Large collections of work from the Group of Seven can be found at the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]] in Toronto, the [[National Gallery of Canada]] in Ottawa as well as the [[Ottawa Art Gallery]] (home to The [[Firestone Collection of Canadian Art]]) and the [[McMichael Canadian Art Collection]] in [[Kleinburg, Ontario]]. The National Gallery, under the directorship of Eric Brown, was an early institutional supporter of artists associated with the Group, purchasing art from some of their early exhibitions before they had identified themselves officially as the Group of Seven.&lt;ref name="Varley"&gt;{{Citation|last=Varley|first=Christopher|title=Group of Seven|url=http://thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0003476|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|publisher=Historica Foundation|accessdate=18 October 2011|postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Art Gallery of Ontario, in its earlier incarnation as the Art Gallery of Toronto, was the site of their first exhibition as the Group of Seven.&lt;ref name="Silcox"/&gt; The McMichael gallery was founded by Robert and Signe McMichael, who began collecting paintings by the Group of Seven and their contemporaries in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/artdesign/story/2007/07/05/mcmichael-signe-obit.html |title=McMichael gallery co-founder dies |publisher=CBC Arts |date=5 July 2007 |accessdate=2014-03-24 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113134551/http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/artdesign/story/2007/07/05/mcmichael-signe-obit.html |archivedate=13 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Red Maple (A. Y. Jackson).jpg|right|thumb|''Red Maple'', 1914, by [[A. Y. Jackson]], [[National Gallery of Canada]], [[Ottawa]]]]
Tom Thomson, J. E. H. MacDonald, Arthur Lismer, Frederick Varley, Frank Johnston and Franklin Carmichael met as employees of the [[design firm]] [[Grip Ltd.]] in Toronto. In 1913, they were joined by A. Y. (Alexander Young) Jackson and Lawren Harris. They often met at [[the Arts and Letters Club of Toronto]] to discuss their opinions and share their art.&lt;ref name="Silcox"/&gt;

This group received monetary support from Harris (heir to the Massey-Harris farm machinery fortune) and Dr. [[James MacCallum]]. Harris and MacCallum jointly built the [[Studio Building (Toronto)|Studio Building]] in 1914 in the Rosedale ravine to serve as a meeting and working place for the new Canadian art movement. MacCallum owned land on [[Georgian Bay]] and Thomson worked as a guide in nearby [[Algonquin Park]], both places where he and the other artists often travelled for inspiration.&lt;ref name="Hill"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hill|first=Charles C.|title=Group of Seven|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t148.e692|work=The Oxford Companion to Canadian History|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The informal group was temporarily split up during [[World War I]], during which Jackson&lt;ref name="brandon46"&gt;Brandon, Laura. (2008). {{Google books|kwg9g5vc4jUC|''Art and War,'' p. 46.|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Varley&lt;ref name="davis30"&gt;Davis, Ann.

Jackson enlisted in June 1915 and served in France from November 1915 to 1917, at which point he was seriously injured.&lt;ref name="Mellen 70"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mellen|first1=Peter|title=The Group of Seven.|date=1970|publisher=McClelland and Stewart|location=Toronto|isbn=978-0771058158|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harris enlisted in 1916 and taught [[Musket|musketry]] at [[CFB Borden|Camp Borden]].&lt;ref name="Roza"&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Roza|first=Alexandra M.|date=1997|title=Towards a Modern Canadian Art 1910-1936: The Group of Seven, A.J.M.

He appeared to have suffered a blow to the head and showed no signs of drowning. The circumstances of his death remain mysterious.&lt;ref name="Silcox"/&gt;

The seven who formed the original group reunited after the war. They continued to travel throughout [[Ontario]], especially the [[Muskoka District Municipality, Ontario|Muskoka]] and [[Algoma District, Ontario|Algoma]] regions, sketching the landscape and developing techniques to represent it in art. In 1919, they decided to make themselves into a group devoted to a distinct Canadian form of art which didn't exist yet, and began to call themselves the Group of Seven.&lt;ref name="Hill"/&gt; It is unknown who specifically chose these seven men, but it is believed to have been Harris.&lt;ref name='Silcox Pg 17'&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Silcox | first1 = David P. | title = The Group of Seven and Tom Thomson | chapter = Introduction | publisher = Firefly Books Ltd. | year = 2003 | location = Toronto, Ontario | page = 17 | isbn = 1-55297-605-X | quote = Someone decided whom to invite to that historic meeting, and probably Harris, or Harris after conferring with MacDonald, was responsible.}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1920, they were ready for their first exhibition thanks to the constant support and encouragement of Eric Brown, the director of the National Gallery at that time. Prior to this, many artists{{who?|date=May 2016}} believed the Canadian landscape was not worthy of being painted.  Reviews for the 1920 exhibition were mixed,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|last=Varley|first=Christopher|title=Group of Seven|url=http://thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0003476|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|publisher=Historica Foundation|accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but as the decade progressed the Group came to be recognized as pioneers of a new, Canadian, [[Art school|school of art]].

After Frank Johnston left the group in 1920 to move to Winnipeg, [[A. J. Casson]] was invited to join in 1926.&lt;ref name="Hill"/&gt; Franklin Carmichael had taken a liking to him and had encouraged Casson to sketch and paint for many years beforehand.

[[File:The Jack Pine, by Tom Thomson.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Jack Pine (painting)|The Jack Pine]]'', 1916â17, by [[Tom Thomson]], National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa]]
The Group's champions during its early years included [[Barker Fairley]], a co-founder of ''Canadian Forum magazine'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Symington|first=Rodney|title=Fairley, Barker|url=http://thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0002703|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|publisher=Historica Foundation|accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the warden of [[Hart House (University of Toronto)|Hart House]] at the [[University of Toronto]], J. Burgon Bickersteth.

The members of the Group began to travel elsewhere in Canada for inspiration, including [[British Columbia]], [[Quebec]], [[Nova Scotia]], and the [[Arctic]]. After [[Samuel Gurney Cresswell]] and other painters on Royal Navy expeditions, these were the first artists of European descent who depicted the Arctic. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} Soon, the Group made the decision that to be called a "national school of painters" there should be members from outside Toronto. As a result, in 1930 [[Edwin Holgate]] from Montreal, Quebec became a member, followed by [[LeMoine FitzGerald]] from Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1932.&lt;ref name="Varley"/&gt;

The Group's influence was so widespread by the end of 1931, and after J. E. H. MacDonald's death in 1932, they no longer found it necessary to continue as a group of painters. They announced that the Group had been disbanded and that a new association of painters would be formed, known as the Canadian Group of Painters. The Canadian Groupâwhich eventually consisted of the majority of Canada's leading artistsâheld its first exhibition in 1933, and continued to hold exhibitions almost every year as a successful society until 1967.

==Legacy==
In 1995, the [[National Gallery of Canada]] compiled a Group of Seven retrospective show, for which they commissioned the Canadian rock band [[Rheostatics]] to write a [[Sheet music|musical score]]. That score was released on album as ''[[Music Inspired by the Group of Seven]]''.

Six members of the group, A.Y. Jackson,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcmichael.com/collection/seven/jackson.cfm A.Y.

Contemporary painter Rae Johnson has derived much of her style from the Group of Seven.&lt;ref name="HellerHeller2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jules Heller|author2=Nancy G. Heller|title=North American Women Artists of the Twentieth Century: A Biographical Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AYxmAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR11|date=19 December 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-63882-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Group of Seven has received criticism for its reinforcement of [[terra nullius]] presenting the region as pristine and untouched by humans when in fact the areas depicted have been lived in for many centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Mitchell|first=Thomas W.J.|title=Landscape and Power|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8E3yVlUUK9AC|publisher=University of Chicago Press, 2002|accessdate=19 October 2011|isbn=9780226532059|date=15 April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sentiment was expressed by Jackson, who in his 1958 autobiography wrote,

{{quote|After painting in Europe where everything was mellowed by time and human associations, I found it a problem to paint a country in outward appearance pretty much as it had been when [[Samuel de Champlain|Champlain]] passed through its thousands of rock islands three hundred years before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jackson|first1=A.Y.|title=A Painter's Country|date=1958|publisher=Clarke Irwin|location=Toronto|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Recognition==
On 18 September 1970 Canada Post issued 'The Group of Seven', designed by [[Allan Fleming|Allan Robb Fleming]] and based on a painting, "Isles of Spruce" (1922), by Arthur Lismer and held in the Hart House Permanent Collection, University of Toronto. The 6Â¢ stamps are [[perforated 11]], and were printed by [[Ashton-Potter Limited]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data4.collectionscanada.gc.ca/netacgi/nph-brs?s1=(artist.A790,C790.)+Or+(null.B742.)&amp;l=50&amp;d=STMP&amp;p=1&amp;u=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/archivianet/02011702_e.html&amp;r=27&amp;f=G&amp;Sect1=STMP |title=Canada Post stamp |publisher=Data4.collectionscanada.gc.ca |date=18 September 1970 |accessdate=2014-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gustav Bergmann''' (May 4, 1906&amp;nbsp;â April 21, 1987) was an Austrian-born American philosopher. He studied at the [[University of Vienna]] and was a member of the [[Vienna Circle]]. Bergmann was influenced by the philosophers [[Moritz Schlick]], [[Friedrich Waismann]], and [[Rudolf Carnap]] who were members of the Circle.&lt;ref&gt;[https://clas.uiowa.edu/philosophy/resources/gustav-bergmann "Gustav Bergmann" (clas.uiowa.edu)]&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States]], he was a professor of [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]] at the [[University of Iowa]].

== Biography ==
Bergmann was born in [[Vienna]], [[Austria-Hungary]]. He earned his Ph.D. in mathematics at the [[University of Vienna]] in 1928. His dissertation, directed by [[Walther Mayer]], was titled ''Zwei BeitrÃ¤ge zur mehrdimensionalen Differentialgeometrie''. While studying for his [[doctorate]], he was invited to join the [[Vienna Circle]], a group of philosophers, mathematicians, scientists, and others committed to a scientific worldview under the name of [[logical positivism]]. In 1930â31, he worked with [[Albert Einstein]] in Berlin. Unable as a Jew to find academic employment, Bergmann obtained a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] degree from the University of Vienna in 1935, and practiced [[corporate law]] until he and his family fled to the United States in 1938. Settling at the [[University of Iowa]] in [[Iowa City]] in 1939, Bergmann eventually became professor of both philosophy and psychology.

He died in Iowa City.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4659">The '''H-Prize program''' is a series of [[inducement prize contest|inducement prizes]] intended to encourage research into the use of [[hydrogen]] as an [[energy carrier]] in a [[hydrogen economy]]. The program is sponsored by the [[United States Department of Energy]] and administered by the Hydrogen Education Foundation. In 2014, an H-Prize competition was launched to develop a small-scale hydrogen generation and refueling station for hydrogen [[fuel cell electric vehicle]]s. The prize, named the H2 Refuel H-Prize and worth $1 million, was awarded in January 2017, to the consortium "SimpleFuel". 

==Creation==
Legislation for the prize, introduced by Rep. [[Bob Inglis]], passed the [[United States House of Representatives]] in May 2006 as {{USBill|109|H.R.|5143}},&lt;ref&gt;[[United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20060602094041/http://www.house.gov/science/press/109/109-257.htm "House Overwhelmingly Passes Inglis H-Prize Bill"]&lt;/ref&gt; but did not receive a vote in the [[United States Senate]]. After being reintroduced by Rep. [[Dan Lipinski]] at the beginning of a new term in January 2007, it was eventually folded into the [[Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007]], which passed both the House of Representatives and the Senate and was then signed into law in December 2007.

The bill [[authorization bill|authorized]] $50 million in prize money, for the period from fiscal year 2008 to fiscal year 2017. However, in order to be spent, these funds must also be included in Congress's annual [[appropriation bill]]s. The law provides for three categories of prizes:

*Four prizes of up to $1 million, awarded every two years for advances in hydrogen production, storage, distribution and utilization;
*One prize of up to $4 million, awarded two years to working prototypes of hydrogen vehicles which meet ambitious performance goals; and
*A $10 million grand prize, awarded only once during the program for a major technological breakthrough.

In October 2008, the [[Hydrogen Education Foundation]] of Washington, D.C. was selected to administer the H-Prize along with [[South Carolina Research Authority|SCRA]], a South Carolina research foundation.

== Prizes ==
In August 2009, the [[Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy]] (EERE) of the U.S. Department of Energy announced a $1 million prize for innovative [[hydrogen storage]] materials which would be awarded in February 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2009/08/26/E9-20552/initial-h-prize-competition-for-breakthrough-advances-in-materials-for-hydrogen-storage|title=Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 164 / Wednesday, August 26, 2009 / Notices|date=August 26, 2009|accessdate=21 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the prize was never awarded as no competitor met the competition requirements.

In March 2014, EERE announced plans for a $1 million H2 Refuel H-Prize, and the Prize competition was launched in October 2014. The competition focused on developing small hydrogen refueling stations that can generate hydrogen from electricity or natural gas and dispense it to vehicles at least 1 kg at a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://energy.gov/eere/articles/interested-hydrogen-and-fuel-cell-technologies-help-shape-h2-refuel-h-prize | title=Interested in Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technologies?

SimpleFuel was a consortium of three companies, PDC Machines, Ivys, Inc, and McPhy Energy North America. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/articles/energy-department-announces-simplefuel-winner-1-million-h2-refuel-h-prize | title=Energy Department Announces SimpleFuel Winner of the $1 Million H2 Refuel H-Prize | publisher=[[Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy]] | date=19 January 2017 | accessdate=23 January 2018 | author=Sunita Satyapal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ancient Near East ==
{{see also|Sacred prostitution}}
The [[Ancient Near East]] was home to many shrines, temples or "houses of heaven," which were dedicated to various deities. These shrines and temples were documented by the Greek historian [[Herodotus]] in ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]], ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Aabo%3Atlg%2C0016%2C001&amp;query=book%3D1%3Achapter%3D199%3Asection%3D1 1.199], tr A.D. Godley (1920)&lt;/ref&gt; where [[sacred prostitution]] was a common practice.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example,  [[James Frazer]] (1922), ''[[The Golden Bough]]'', 3e, [[s:The Golden Bough/Adonis in Cyprus|Chapter 31: Adonis in Cyprus]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sumeria]]n records dating back to ca. 2400 [[Common Era|BCE]] are the earliest recorded mention of prostitution as an occupation. These describe a [[temple]]-[[brothel]] operated by Sumerian priests in the city of [[Uruk]]. This ''kakum'' or temple was dedicated to the goddess [[Ishtar]] and was the home to three grades of women. The first grade of women were only permitted to perform sexual rituals in the temple, the second group had access to the grounds and catered to visitors, and the third and lowest class lived on the temple grounds. The third class was also free to find customers in the streets.

During the region of [[Canaan]], a significant portion of temple prostitutes were male. This was also widely practiced in [[Sardinia]] and in some of the [[Phoenicia]]n cultures, usually in honor of the goddess [[`Ashtart|Ashtart]]. Presumably under the influence of the Phoenicians,{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} this practice was developed in other ports of the [[Mediterranean Sea]], such as [[Erice]] ([[Sicily]]), [[Locri|Locri Epizephiri]], [[Crotone|Croton]], Rossano Vaglio and Sicca Veneria. Other hypotheses include [[Asia Minor]], [[Lydia]], [[Syria]] and the Etruscans.

In later years sacred prostitution and similar classifications for females were known to have existed in Greece, Rome, India, China, and Japan.{{sfn|Murphy|1983|}} Such practices came to an end when the emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] in the fourth century AD destroyed the [[goddess]] temples and replaced the religious practices with [[Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Eusebius]], ''Life of Constantine'', [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf201.iv.vi.iii.lv.html 3.55] and [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf201.iv.vi.iii.lviii.html 3.58]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biblical references ==
Prostitution was commonplace in [[ancient Israel]]. There are a number of references to prostitution in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. The Biblical story of [[Judah (Bible)|Judah]] and [[Tamar (Genesis)|Tamar]] ({{bibleverse||Genesis|38:14-26|HE}}) provides a depiction of prostitution being practiced in that time period. In this story the prostitute waits at the side of a highway where she waits for travelers. She covers her face in order to identify herself as a prostitute. Instead of being paid in money she asks for a kid goat. This would have been the equivalent of a high price, showing that only the wealthy owner of numerous herds could have afforded to pay for a single sexual encounter. Under this system if the traveller does not have his cattle with him he must give valuables to the woman as a deposit until a kid goat is delivered to her. The woman in the story was not a legitimate prostitute but actually was Judah's widowed daughter-in-law, who sought to trick Judah into impregnating her. However, since she succeeded in impersonating a prostitute her conduct can be assumed to accurately represent the behaviour of a prostitute in society during that time period.

In a later Biblical story, found in the [[Book of Joshua]], a prostitute in [[Jericho]] named [[Rahab]] assisted Israelite spies by providing them with information regarding the current socio-cultural and military situation. [[Rahab]] was knowledgeable in these matters because of her popularity with the high-ranking nobles. The Israelite spies, in return for this information, promised to save her and her family during the planned military invasion, only if she kept the details of her contact with them a secret. She would leave a sign on her residence that indicated to the advancing soldiers not to attack the people within. When the people of Israel conquered Canaan, she converted to Judaism and married a prominent member of the people.

In the [[Book of Revelation]], the [[Whore of Babylon]] is named "Babylon the Great, the Mother of Prostitutes and Abominations of the Earth". However the word "whore" could also be translated as "Idolatress". The first Babylonian prostitute was in a place called Hinchinopolises, which arose from the appraised Hinchin family. At the time Hinchinapolis was the center of attraction for all travelers who came to rest in the company of the family's women, who perfected the art of satisfaction. Some ancient scrolls could tell us that the meaning of Hinchin came from the Hebrew ''Hinam'', meaning free, because the males of the family would offer themselves for free.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?strongs=G4204 ÏÏÏÎ½Î·]: From Greek.

==Aztecs and Incas==
Among the [[Aztecs]], the [[Cihuacalli]] was the name given to the controlled buildings where prostitution was permitted by political and religious authorities.  Cihuacalli is a Nahuatl word which means House of Women. The Cihuacalli was a closed compound with rooms, all looking over a central patio. At the center of the patio was a statue of [[Tlazolteotl]], the goddess of purification, steam baths, midwives, filth and a patroness of adulterers. Religious authorities believed women should work as prostitutes, if they wish, only at such premises guarded by Tlazolteotl. It was believed that Tlazolteotl had the power to incite sexual activity, while cleansing the spirit of such acts. Bernal DÃ­az described numerous male prostitutes among the Aztecs, as well as unmarried temple priests engaging in sodomy.{{sfn|Neill|2011|p=26}}

Inca prostitutes were segregated from other people and lived under the supervision of a government agent.{{sfn|Bruhns|Stothert|1999|p=156}}

==Greece==
{{see also|Prostitution in ancient Greece}}
[[File:Griechen31.png|thumb|Customer and a prostitute illustrated on an [[ancient Greek]] [[Kylix (drinking cup)|wine cup]]]]
In ancient Greece, both women and boys engaged in prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/love-sex/culture-of-love/a-brief-cultural-history-of-sex-938527.html |title=A brief cultural history of sex |publisher=Independent.co.uk |date=2008-09-23 |accessdate=2012-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek word for prostitute is ''porne'' (Gr: ÏÏÏÎ½Î·), derived from the verb ''pernemi'' (to sell). The English word ''[[pornography]]'', and its corollaries in other languages, are directly derivative of the Greek word ''pornÄ'' (Gr: ÏÏÏÎ½Î·).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/resolveform?type=start&amp;lookup=porn&amp;lang=greek List of Greek words starting with ÏÎ¿ÏÎ½- (''porn-'')], on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; Female prostitutes could be independent and sometimes influential women. They were required to wear distinctive dresses and had to pay taxes. Some similarities have been found between the Greek ''[[hetaera]]'' and the Japanese ''[[oiran]]'', complex figures that are perhaps in an intermediate position between prostitution and [[courtisanerie]]. (See also the Indian [[tawaif]].) Some prostitutes in ancient Greece, such as [[Lais of Corinth|Lais]] were as famous for their company as their [[beauty]], and some of these women charged extraordinary sums for their services.

[[Solon]] instituted the first of Athens' brothels (''oik'iskoi'') in the sixth century BC, and with the earnings of this business he built a temple dedicated to [[Aphrodite Pandemos]], goddess of sexual pleasure. Procuring, however, was severely forbidden. In [[Cyprus]] (Paphus) and in [[Corinth, Greece|Corinth]], a type of [[religious prostitution]] was practiced where the temple counted more than a thousand prostitutes (''hierodules'', Gr: Î¹ÎµÏÏÎ´Î¿ÏÎ»ÎµÏ), according to [[Strabo]].

Each specialized category had its proper name, so there were the ''chamaitypa'i'', working outdoor (lie-down), the ''perepatetikes'' who met their customers while walking (and then worked in their houses), and the ''gephyrides'', who worked near the bridges. In the fifth century, Ateneo informs us that the price was 1 ''obole'', a sixth of a drachma and the equivalent of an ordinary worker's day salary. The rare pictures describe that [[Sexual intercourse|sex]] was performed on beds with covers and pillows, while [[triclinia]] usually didn't have these accessories.

Male prostitution was also common in Greece. Adolescent boys usually practiced it, a reflection of the [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|pederastic]] custom of the time. Slave boys worked the male brothels in Athens, while free boys who sold their favours risked losing their political rights as adults.

==Ancient Rome==

&lt;span id="RomeTV"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
{{see also|Prostitution in ancient Rome}}
Prostitution in ancient Rome was legal, public and widespread. Even [[Social class in ancient Rome|Roman men of the highest social status]] were free to engage prostitutes of either sex without incurring moral disapproval,{{sfn|Dillon|Garland|2005|p=382}} as long as they demonstrated self-control and moderation in the frequency and enjoyment of sex. [[Latin literature]] also often refers to prostitutes. Real-world practices are documented by provisions of [[Roman law]] that regulate prostitution. [[epigraphy|Inscriptions]], especially graffiti from [[Pompeii]], uncover the practice of prostitution in Ancient Rome. Some large brothels in the fourth century, when Rome was becoming Christianized, seem to have been counted as tourist attractions and were possibly state-owned.{{sfn|McGinn|2004|pp=167â168}} Prostitutes played a role in several [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religious observances]], mainly in the month of April, over which the love and fertility goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] presided. While prostitution was so widely accepted, prostitutes were often considered shameful. Most were [[Slavery in ancient Rome|slaves]] or former slaves, or if free by birth relegated to the ''[[infamia|infames]]'', people lacking in social standing and deprived of the protections that most [[Roman citizenship|citizens]] under Roman law received.{{sfn|Edwards|1997|p=66 ''et passim''}} Prostitution thus reflects the ambivalent attitudes of Romans toward [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Pleasure and infamy|pleasure]] and [[Sexuality in ancient Rome|sexuality]].{{sfn|Edwards|1997|pp=67, 83}}

A registered prostitute was called a [[meretrix]] while the unregistered one fell under the broad category ''prostibulae''. There were some similarities between the Ancient Roman and Greek system, but as the Empire grew, prostitutes were often foreign [[slavery|slaves]], captured, purchased or raised for the purpose of prostitution. This was sometimes done by large-scale "prostitute farmers" where  [[child abandonment|abandoned children]] were raised, and almost always raised to become prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Justin Martyr |authorlink1=First Apology |title=CHURCH FATHERS: The First Apology (St. Justin Martyr) |url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0126.htm |website=www.newadvent.org |accessdate=28 August 2018 |quote="But as for us, we have been taught that to expose newly-born children is the part of wicked men; and this we have been taught lest we should do any one an injury, and lest we should sin against God, first, because we see that almost all so exposed (not only the girls, but also the males) are brought up to prostitution."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enslavement into prostitution was sometimes used as a legal punishment against criminal free women. Buyers were allowed to inspect naked men and women for sale in private and there was no stigma attached to the purchase of males by a male aristocrat.

Scholars have studied the history of prostitution in India from ancient times to the present.{{sfn|Simha|Bose|2003| }}

A [[tawaif]] was a [[courtesan]] who catered to the nobility of [[South Asia]], particularly during the era of the [[Mughal Empire]]. These courtesans would dance, sing, recite poetry and entertain their suitors at [[mehfil]]s. Like the [[geisha]] tradition in Japan, their main purpose was to professionally entertain their guests. While sex was often incidental, it was not assured contractually. The most popular or highest-class tawaifs could often pick and choose between the best of their suitors. They contributed to music, dance, theatre, film and the [[Urdu]] literary tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2004/08/11/stories/2004081101090100.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Mapping cultures | date=August 11, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term [[devadasi]] originally described a [[Hindu]] religious practice in which girls were married and dedicated to a deity ([[deva (Hinduism)|deva]] or [[devi]]). They were in charge of taking care of the temple, performing rituals they learned and practicing [[Bharatanatyam]] and other classical Indian arts traditions. This status allowed them to enjoy a high social status. The popularity of devadasis seems to have reached its pinnacle around the 10th and 11th centuries. The rise and fall in the status of devadasis can be seen to be running parallel to the rise and fall of Hindu temples. Due to the destruction of temples by Islamic invaders, the status of the temples fell very quickly in [[North India]] and slowly in [[South India]]. As the temples became poorer and lost their patron kings, and in some cases were destroyed, the devadasis were forced into a life of poverty and prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;Kalpana Kannabiran,  "Judiciary, Social Reform and Debate on'Religious Prostitution'in Colonial India." ''Economic and political weekly'' (1995): WS59-WS69. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4403368 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the British [[East India Company]]'s [[Company rule in India|rule in India]] in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, it was initially fairly common for British soldiers to engage in inter-ethnic [[prostitution in India]], where they would frequently visit local Indian ''[[nautch]]'' dancers.&lt;ref name=Fisher-2007&gt;{{citation|title=Excluding and Including "Natives of India": Early-Nineteenth-Century British-Indian Race Relations in Britain|first=Michael H.|last=Fisher|journal=Comparative Studies of South Asia, Africa and the Middle East|volume=27|issue=2|year=2007|pages=303â314 [304â05]|doi=10.1215/1089201x-2007-007|postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; As British females began arriving in British India in large numbers from the early to mid-19th century, it became increasingly uncommon for British soldiers to visit Indian prostitutes, and [[miscegenation]] was despised altogether after the events of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]].{{sfn|Beckman|2003|pp=31â33}}

===Muslims===
In the seventh century, the prophet [[Muhammad]] declared that prostitution is forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Center for Muslim-Jewish Engagement|url=http://cmje.usc.edu/religious-texts/hadith/abudawud/012-sat.php#012.2304|website=cmje.usc.edu|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Islam]], prostitution is considered a sin, and Abu Mas'ud Al-Ansari is attributed with saying, "Allah's Apostle forbade taking the price of a dog, money earned by prostitution and the earnings of a soothsayer." ({{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|3|34|439}}) However, [[sexual slavery]] was not considered prostitution and was very common during the [[Arab slave trade]] during the Middle Ages and [[early modern period]]. Women and girls from the [[Caucasus]], [[Africa]], [[Central Asia]] and [[Europe]] were captured and served as [[concubine]]s in the [[harem]]s of the [[Arab World]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/history/slavery_7.shtml|title=BBC - Religions - Islam: Slavery in Islam|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibn Battuta]] said several times that he was given or purchased female slaves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/Ibn_Battuta/Slavery.html Insights into the concept of Slavery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122171200/http://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/ibn_battuta/Slavery.html |date=2009-11-22 }}. San Francisco Unified School District.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Shia]] Muslims, the prophet Muhammad sanctioned [[Nikah mutâah|fixed-term marriage]], called ''muta'a'' in [[Iraq]] and ''[[sigheh]]'' in [[Iran]], which according to some Western writers, has allegedly been used as a legitimizing cover for sex workers, in a culture where prostitution is otherwise forbidden.{{sfn|Ä°lkkaracan|2008|p=36}} [[Sunni]] Muslims, who make up the majority of Muslims worldwide, believe the practice of nikah mutâah was revoked and ultimately forbidden by second Sunni caliph, [[Umar]]. However, Sunnis have fixed-term marriages, such as [[nikah urfi]], [[nikah Misyar]], and [[nikah halala]]. Fundamentalist Sunnis called for [[jihad al nikah|sexual jihad]]. Shias deem all sexual relations outside of proper marriage (the only being nikah or nikah mutah) as illegal, forbidden and against the sunnah. Like the Shia, Sunnis regard prostitution as sinful and forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Olaniyan|first1=Olayinka|title=Prostitution is the business or practice of engaging in sexual relations in exchange for payment|url=https://www.academia.edu/33506440/Prostitution_is_the_business_or_practice_of_engaging_in_sexual_relations_in_exchange_for_payment|website=Academia|accessdate=31 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 16th and 17th centuries, Portuguese visitors and their South Asian (and sometimes African) crew members often engaged in [[slavery in Japan]], where they brought or captured young Japanese women and girls, who were either used as [[Sexual slavery|sexual slaves]] on their ships or taken to [[Macau]] and other Portuguese colonies in [[Southeast Asia]], [[Portuguese colonization of the Americas|the Americas]]{{sfn|Leupp|2003|p=49}} and [[India]].{{sfn|Leupp|2003|p=52}} For example, in [[Goa]], a [[Portuguese India|Portuguese colony in India]], there was a community of Japanese slaves and traders during the late 16th and 17th centuries.{{sfn|Leupp|2003|pp=49, 52}} Later European [[Portuguese East India Company|East India companies]], including those of the [[Dutch East India Company|Dutch]] and [[East India Company|British]], also engaged in [[prostitution in Japan]].{{sfn|Leupp|2003|p=50}}

===China===

Prostitution in [[China]] was due to a weak familial economy among the [[Rural China|rural]] families of the country.{{sfn|Warren|2008|p=293â294}} Although China was a nation of wealth, the poverty stricken families were due to the over population of rural areas. These lives of borderline starvation drove many women out of the rural countryside to the port side cities of China. Many of the women who took part in the prostitution of China were either sold into the industry or willingly joined. Due to their lack of economic stability, parents were unable to feed all the mouths of the house and often sold their daughters into the industry. The popularity of this industry stemmed from the [[Human overpopulation|over population]] in rural villages, and an overall life of poverty for the majority of Chinese families.{{sfn|Warren|2008|p=293â294}} However, the increase of the [[Colonialism|colonial powers]]' presence in China added to the demand for these ladies of the night.

===Southeast Asia===
In Southeast Asia, prostitution was mostly prevalent in [[Singapore]], due to its active ports. Certain districts of Singapore were dedicated [[brothel]] districts sanctioned by the colonial governments.{{sfn|Warren|2008|p=293â294}} As colonial powers entered the Asian countries, there was an increase in number of sailors at ports. Merchant ships carried large crews of men, who lacked the company of women for days on end. As these ships docked in Asian ports, like Singapore, they were drawn to the market of prostitution. This higher demand for the company of a woman created the need for these brothel districts.{{sfn|Warren|2008|p=293â294}}

===Japan===
[[File:Suzuki Haronubu oiran ukiyo-e.jpg|thumb|250px|An oiran preparing herself for a client, [[ukiyo-e]] print by Suzuki Haronubu (1765)]]
From the 15th century, [[China|Chinese]], [[Korea]]n and other [[Far East]]ern visitors began frequenting [[brothel]]s in Japan.{{sfn|Leupp|2003|p=48}} This practice continued among visitors from the [[Western Regions]], mainly [[Europe]]an traders, beginning with the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] in the 16th century who often came with their [[South Asia]]n ''[[lascar]]'' crew, along with [[Africa]]n crewmembers in some cases.{{sfn|Leupp|2003|p=49}} In the 16th century, the local [[Japanese people]] initially assumed that the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] were from ''[[Names of India#Tianzhu|Tenjiku]]'' ("Heavenly Abode"), the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] name for the [[Indian subcontinent]] due to its importance as the birthplace of [[Buddhism]], and that [[Christianity]] was a new [[Indian religions|Indian faith]]. These mistaken assumptions were due to the [[India]]n city of [[Goa]] being a central base for the [[Portuguese East India Company]] and also due to a significant portion of the crew on Portuguese ships being [[Christianity in India|Indian Christians]].{{sfn|Leupp|2003|p=35}}

In the early 17th century, there was widespread male and female prostitution throughout the cities of [[Kyoto]], [[Edo]] and [[Osaka]], [[Japan]]. [[Oiran]] were [[courtesans]] in Japan during the [[Edo period]]. The [[oiran]] were considered a type of {{Nihongo|''yÅ«jo''|éå¥³}} also known as a "woman of pleasure" or prostitute. Among the oiran, the tayÅ« (å¤ªå¤«) was considered the highest rank of courtesan available only to the wealthiest and highest ranking men. To entertain their clients, oiran practiced the arts of dance, music, poetry and calligraphy as well as sexual services, and education was considered essential for sophisticated conversation. Many became celebrities of their times outside the pleasure districts. Their art and fashions often set trends among wealthy women. The last recorded oiran was in 1761.&lt;ref&gt;Teruoka Yasutaka,  "The pleasure quarters and Tokugawa culture." ''Eighteenth Century Japan: Culture and Society'' (1989): 3-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, the problem of regulating prostitution according to modern European models was widely debated in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Sheldon Garon, "The World's Oldest Debate? Prostitution cactus and the State in Imperial Japan, 1900-1945," ''American Historical Review'' 98#3 (1993), pp. 710â732 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2167547 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Middle Ages==
During the [[Middle Ages]] prostitution was commonly found in urban contexts. Although all forms of sexual activity outside of marriage were regarded as sinful by the [[Roman Catholic Church]], prostitution was tolerated because it helped prevent the greater [[evil]]s of [[rape]], [[sodomy]] and [[masturbation]].{{sfn|McCall|1979| }} [[Augustine of Hippo]] is quoted saying, "if you expel prostitution from society, you will unsettle everything on account of lusts." The general tolerance of prostitution was for the most part reluctant, and many people from the church urged prostitutes to reform.

After the decline of organized prostitution of the Roman empire, many prostitutes were slaves. However, religious campaigns against slavery and the growing marketisation of the economy turned prostitution back into a business. By the [[High Middle Ages]] it was common to find town governments ruling that prostitutes were not to ply their trade within the [[town wall]]s, but they were tolerated outside, only because these areas were beyond the jurisdiction of the authorities. In many areas of France and Germany town governments came to set aside certain streets as areas where prostitution could be tolerated.&lt;ref name="BaardaSikora2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baarda|first1=Benjamin I.|last2=Sikora|first2=Aleksandra E.|title=Proteomics of Neisseria gonorrhoeae: the treasure hunt for countermeasures against an old disease|journal=Frontiers in Microbiology|volume=6|year=2015|issn=1664-302X|doi=10.3389/fmicb.2015.01190|postscript=; Access provided by the [[University of Pittsburgh]].}}&lt;/ref&gt; In London the brothels of [[Southwark]] were owned by the [[Bishop of Winchester]].{{sfn|McCall|1979| }} After this, it became common in the major towns and cities of [[Southern Europe]] to establish civic brothels. This allowed the government to outlaw any prostitution taking place outside these brothels. In much of [[Northern Europe]] a more tolerant attitude could be found towards prostitution.{{sfn|Davies|1996|p=413}} Prostitutes also found a fruitful market in the Crusades.

[[File:Ãtienne Jeaurat 001.jpg|thumb|French prostitutes being taken to the police station; painting by [[Ãtienne Jeaurat]]]]

By the end of the 15th century attitudes began to harden against prostitution. An outbreak of [[syphilis]] in [[Naples]] during 1494, which later swept across Europe, may have originated from the [[Columbian Exchange|Colombian Exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.livescience.com/history/080114-syphilis-columbus.html Columbus May Have Brought Syphilis to Europe]". [[LiveScience]]. January 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The prevalence of other [[Sexually transmitted infection|sexually transmitted diseases]] during the earlier 16th century may have caused this change in attitude. By the early 16th century the association between prostitutes, plague and contagion emerged, causing brothels and prostitution to be outlawed by secular authority.{{sfn|Otis|1985|p=41}} Furthermore, outlawing brothels and prostitution was used to  "strengthen the criminal law" system of the 16th-century secular rulers.{{sfn|Otis|1985|p=44}} [[Canon law]] defined a prostitute as "a promiscuous woman, regardless of financial elements."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=London Commissary Court Act Books|year=1470â1473|publisher=Department of Manuscripts|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prostitute was considered a "whore â¦ who [was] available for the lust of many men," and was most closely associated with promiscuity.{{sfn|Bennett|1989|p=81}}

The Church's stance on prostitution was three-fold. It included the "acceptance of prostitution as an inevitable social fact, condemnation of those profiting from this commerce, and encouragement for the prostitute to [[repent]].{{sfn|Otis|1985|p=13}} The Church was forced to recognize its inability to remove prostitution from the worldly society, and in the 14th century "began to tolerate prostitution as a lesser evil."{{sfnm|Rossiaud|1996|1p=160|Otis|1985|2p=12}} However, prostitutes were excluded from the Church as long as they continued with their lifestyle.{{sfn|Bullough|Brundage|1982|p=36}} Around the 12th century, the idea of prostitute saints took hold, with [[Mary Magdalene]] being one of the most popular saints of the era. The Church used Mary Magdalene's biblical history of being a reformed harlot to encourage prostitutes to repent and mend their ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Karras|first=Ruth|title=Holy Harlots: Prostitute Saints in Medieval Legend|journal=Journal of the History of Sexuality|date=July 1990|volume=1|issue=1|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, religious houses were established with the purpose of providing asylum and encouraging the reformation of prostitution. Magdalene Homes were particularly popular and peaked in the early 14th century.{{sfnm|1a1=Bullough|1a2=Brundage|1y=1982|1p=41|2a1=Roberts|2y=1992|2pp=73â74}}  Over the course of the Middle Ages, [[popes]] and [[religious communities]] made various attempts to remove prostitution or reform prostitutes with varying success.{{sfn|Bullough|Brundage|1982|pp=41â42}}

With the advent of the [[Protestant Reformation]], numbers of Southern German towns closed their brothels in an attempt to eradicate prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Roper |first1=Lyndal |title=Luther: Sex, Marriage and Motherhood |url=https://www.historytoday.com/lyndal-roper/luther-sex-marriage-and-motherhood |website=History Today |accessdate=28 August 2018 |date=12 December 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some periods prostitutes had to distinguish themselves from other with particular signs. They sometimes wore very short hair or no hair at all, and sometimes they wore [[veil]]s in societies where other women did not wear them. Ancient codes regulated the crime of a prostitute that dissimulated her profession.

==18th century==
[[File:Christian Krohg-Albertine i politilÃ¦gens ventevÃ¦relse.jpg|200px|thumb|''Albertine at the Police Doctor's Waiting Room'', 1885â87 painting by the [[Norway|Norwegian]] writer and painter [[Christian Krohg]] illustrating his then very controversial novel ''Albertine'' about the life of a prostitute]]
According to [[Dervish]] Ismail Agha, in the ''DellÃ¢kname-i DilkÃ¼ÅÃ¢'', the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] archives,{{sfnm|Gazali|2001|1p=106|SÄ±lay|1994|2p= }} in the [[Turkish bath]]s, the masseurs were traditionally [[Pederasty#The Middle East|young men]] who helped wash clients by soaping and scrubbing their bodies. They also were as [[sex workers]].{{sfn|Toledano|2003|p=242  "[Flaubert, January 1850:] Be informed, furthermore, that all of the bath-boys are bardashes [male homosexuals]."}} The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] texts describe who they were, their prices, how many times they could bring their customers to [[orgasm]] and the details of their sexual practices.

In the 18th century, presumably in [[Venice]], prostitutes started using [[condom]]s made with catgut or cow bowel.

==19th century==
In America, prostitution was seen as a "necessary evil" that aided in marital fidelity, especially as a system that would allow men to obtain sex when their wives did not desire it.{{sfn|D'Emilio|Freedman|2012| }} D'Emilio and Freedman document that prostitution was not a crime in the early part of the 19th century, and thus brothels (or bawdy houses) were tolerated in American cities and the laws against individual prostitutes were enforced only occasionally.

In the 1830s, prostitution was becoming more visible in American cities, and with the professionalization of police forces, visible prostitutes such as streetwalkers risked arrest.{{sfn|D'Emilio|Freedman|2012| }} But D'Emilio and Freedman note that raids on brothels were comparatively rare, and prostitution was tolerated in mining towns, cattle towns, and urban centers in the American east. In 1870, prostitution was legalized and regulated in the city of St. Louis Missouri.{{sfn|D'Emilio|Freedman|2012| }} Prostitutes were licensed by public health officials, and were required to maintain weekly inspections for sexually transmitted diseases. However, due to protests and demonstrations organized by women and members of the clergy, Missouri legislators repealed the legislation allowing regulated prostitution.{{sfn|D'Emilio|Freedman|2012| }}

The [[Page Act of 1875]] was passed by the US Congress and forbid any importation of women for the purpose of prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 141.-An act supplementary to the acts in relation to immigration|url=http://prostitution.procon.org/sourcefiles/PageAct.pdf|date=3 March 1875|website=www.procon.org|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The national move to criminalize prostitution was led by Protestant middle class men and women who participated in the revivalism movement of the 19th century.{{sfn|D'Emilio|Freedman|2012| }} 

Many of the women who posed in 19th- and early-20th-century [[vintage erotica]] were prostitutes. The most famous were the [[New Orleans]] women who posed for [[E. J. Bellocq]]. In the 19th century legalized prostitution became a public controversy as [[France]] and then the [[United Kingdom]] passed the [[Contagious Diseases Acts]]. This legislation mandated pelvic examinations for suspected prostitutes. It applied not only to the United Kingdom and France, but also to their overseas colonies. Many early [[feminists]] fought to repeal these laws, either on the grounds that prostitution should be illegal and therefore not government regulated or because it forced degrading medical examinations upon women. A similar situation existed in the [[Russian Empire]]. This included prostitutes operating out of government-sanctioned brothels given yellow internal passports signifying their status and were subjected to weekly physical exams. [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s novel ''[[Resurrection (novel)|Resurrection]]'' describes legal prostitution in 19th-century Russia.

During the 19th century the British in [[British Raj|India]] began to adopt the policy of social segregation, but they continued to keep their brothels full of Indian women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2004/20040905/spectrum/book1.htm How carnal desire put England on top].

===Mining camps===
The houses of prostitution found in every mining camp worldwide were famous, especially in the 19th century when long distance imports of prostitutes became common.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Ann Laite, "Historical Perspectives on Industrial Development, Mining, and Prostitution," ''Historical Journal'', (2009) 53#3 pp.&amp;nbsp;739â761 {{DOI|10.1017/S0018246X09990100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entrepreneurs set up shops and businesses to cater to the miners, and brothels were largely tolerated in mining towns.{{sfn|D'Emilio|Freedman|2012| }} [[Prostitution in the United States|Prostitution in the American West]] was a growth industry that attracted sex workers from around the globe where they were pulled in by the money, despite the harsh and dangerous working conditions and low prestige. Chinese women were frequently sold by their families and taken to the camps as prostitutes, and were often forced to send their earnings back to the family in China.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucie Cheng|Lucie Cheng Hirata]], "Free, Indentured, Enslaved: Chinese Prostitutes in Nineteenth-Century America," ''Signs'' (1979) 5f1 pp.&amp;nbsp;3â29 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3173531 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; In Virginia City, Nevada, a prostitute, [[Julia Bulette]], was one of the few who achieved "respectable" status. She nursed victims of an influenza epidemic, earning her acceptance in the community and the support of the sheriff. The townspeople were shocked when she was murdered in 1867 and they honoured her with a lavish funeral and hanging of her assailant.{{sfn|Goldman|1981|pp=1â4, 118}}

Until the 1890s, madams predominately ran the businesses, after which male pimps took over. This led to the generally declined treatment of women. It was not uncommon for brothels in Western towns to operate openly, without the stigma that was beginning to emerge in East Coast cities as a result of anti-prostitution activism.{{sfn|D'Emilio|Freedman|2012| }} Gambling and prostitution were central to life in these western towns, and only later, as the female population increased, reformers moved in and other civilizing influences arrived, did prostitution become less blatant and less common.{{sfn|Butler|1987| }} After a decade or so the mining towns attracted respectable women who ran boarding houses, organized church societies, and worked as laundresses and seamstresses, all while striving for independent status.{{sfn|Jeffrey|1998|p=164}}

Australia mining camps had a well-developed system of prostitution.{{sfn|McKewon|2005| }} City fathers sometimes tried to confine the practice to red light districts.&lt;ref&gt;Elaine McKewon, "The historical geography of prostitution in Perth, Western Australia." ''[[Australian Geographer]]'' 34.3 (2003): 297â310 .&lt;/ref&gt; The precise role prostitution played in various camps depended on the sex ratio in specific population groups of colonial society as well as racial attitudes toward non-whites. In the early 19th century British authorities decided it was best to have lower-class white, Asian, Middle Eastern and Aboriginal women service the prisoners and thereby keep peace while maintaining strong class lines that isolated British gentlemen and ladies from the lower elements. Prostitution was so profitable that it was easy to circumvent the legal boundaries. When Australians took control by 1900 they wanted a "white Australia" and tried to exclude or expel non-white women who might become prostitutes. However, feminist activists fought against Australia's discriminatory laws that led to varying levels of rights for women, races and classes. By 1939 new attitudes toward racial harmony began to surface. These were inspired by white Australians to rethink their racist policies and adopt more liberal residency laws that did not focus on sexual or racial issues.&lt;ref&gt;Raelene Frances, "Sex Workers or Citizens? Prostitution and the Shaping of" Settler" Society in Australia." ''International Review of Social History'' 44 (1999): 101â122.&lt;/ref&gt;

Latin American mining camps also had well-developed systems of prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;Roseann Cohen, "Extractive Desires: The Moral Control of Female Sexuality at Colombia's Gold Mining Frontier." ''Journal of Latin American and Caribbean Anthropology'' 19.2 (2014): 260â279.&lt;/ref&gt; In Mexico the government tried to protect and idealize middle class women, but made little effort to protect prostitutes in the mining camps.&lt;ref&gt;William E. French, "Prostitutes and guardian angels: women, work, and the family in Porfirian Mexico." ''Hispanic American Historical Review'' 72#4 (1992): 529â553. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2516659 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 20th-century African mining camps prostitution followed the historical patterns developed in the 19th century. They added the theme of casual temporary marriages.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Fahy Bryceson, Jesper Bosse JÃ¸nsson, and Hannelore Verbrugge. "Prostitution or partnership? Wifestyles in Tanzanian artisanal gold-mining settlements."

==20th century==
During World War I, in colonial Philippines, US armed forces developed a prostitute management program called the "American Plan" which enabled the military to arrest any woman within five miles of a military cantonment. If found infected, a woman could be sentenced to a hospital or a farm colony until cured.{{sfn|Rosen|1982|p=35}}

Beginning in the 1910s and continuing in some places into the 1950s, the American Plan operated in the United States. Women were told to report to a health officer where they were coerced to submit to an invasive examination. Immigrants, minorities and the poor were primarily targeted.{{sfn|Stern|2018| }}

In 1921, the [[International Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Women and Children]] was signed. In this convention some nations declared reservations towards prostitution.

The leading theorists of [[communism]] opposed prostitution. [[Karl Marx]] thought of it as "only a specific expression of the general prostitution of the laborer," and considered its abolition to be necessary to overcome capitalism. [[Friedrich Engels]] considered even marriage a form of prostitution, and [[Vladimir Lenin]] found sex work distasteful. Communist governments often took wide-ranging steps to repress prostitution immediately after obtaining power, although the practice always persisted. In the countries that remained nominally communist after the end of the Cold War, especially China, prostitution remained illegal but was nonetheless common. In many current or former communist countries the economic depression brought about by the collapse of the Soviet Union led to an increase in prostitution.&lt;ref name="Slate Explainer"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wickman|first=Forrest|title="Socialist Whores": What did Karl Marx think of prostitutes?|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2011/11/socialist_whores_what_did_karl_marx_think_of_prostitution_.html|accessdate=5 November 2011|newspaper=[[Slate Magazine]]|date=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] soldiers engaged in [[forced prostitution]] during their invasions across [[East Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. The term "[[comfort women]]" became a [[euphemism]] for the estimated 200,000 mostly [[Korean people|Korean]] and [[China|Chinese]] women who were forced into prostitution in [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese military]] brothels during the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200703/200703190023.html|title=Comfort Women Were 'Raped': U.S. Ambassador to Japan|date=19 March 2007|work=The Chosun Ilbo (English Edition)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627070105/http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200703/200703190023.html|archive-date=27 June 2009|accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sex tourism]] emerged in the late 20th century as a controversial aspect of Western tourism and [[globalization]]. Sex tourism was typically undertaken internationally by tourists from wealthier countries. Author [[Nils Johan Ringdal|Nils Ringdal]] alleged that three out of four men between the ages of 20 and 50 who have visited [[Asia]] or [[Africa]] have paid for sex.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/love-for-sale-a-global-history-of-prostitution-by-nils-ringdal-trans-richard-daly-751462.html Love for Sale: a global history of prostitution by Nils Ringdal, trans Richard Daly]. By Sarah Burton. ''The Independent.'' November 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

A new legal approach to prostitution emerged at the end of the 20th century, termed ''the Swedish model''. This included the prohibition of buying, but not selling, of sexual services. This means that only the client commits a crime in engaging in paid sex, not the prostitute. Such laws were enacted in Sweden (1999), Norway (2009), Iceland (2009), Canada (2014), Northern Ireland (2015), France (2016), and the Republic of Ireland (2017), and are also being considered in other jurisdictions. These laws are an attempt to protect the worker and embrace the fallout of the [[sexual revolution]], meaning sex will happen, and for it to happen safely and respectfully, there must be "free-form" regulation.

==United Kingdom==
The United Kingdom introduced the [[Sexual Offences Act 1956|Sexual Offences Act of 1956]] which would partly be repealed and altered by the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]]. While this law did not criminalise the act of prostitution itself, it did prohibit such activities as running a brothel and soliciting for paid sex.

Concerns were voiced over [[white British]] adolescent girls being used as prostitutes by [[British Pakistanis|Pakistani]] immigrants in the 1960s. These girls were wanted by several police departments in the early 1960s and were described as "good-looking and attractive, not of common appearance ... will almost certainly earn her living by prostitution and with Pakistanis."{{sfn|Jackson|2006|p=154}}

==United States==
In the United States prostitution was originally widely legal. Prostitution was made illegal in almost all states between 1910 and 1915 largely due to the influence of the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]], which was influential in the banning of [[Recreational drug use|drug use]] and was a major force in the [[prohibition]] of alcohol. In 1917 the prostitution district [[Storyville, New Orleans|Storyville]] in New Orleans was closed down by the Federal government over local objections. In Deadwood, South Dakota prostitution, while technically illegal, was tolerated by local residents and officials for decades until the last madam was brought down by state and federal authorities for tax evasion in 1980. Prostitution remained legal in [[Alaska]] until 1953, and is still legal in some rural counties of [[Nevada]], including areas outside of Las Vegas. For more, see [[Prostitution in Nevada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.gwu.edu/~soc/docs/Weitzer/Prostitution_Facts.pdf | title=prostitution:facts and fictions | publisher=www.gwu.edu | accessdate=2013-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the late 1980s many states increased the penalties for prostitution in cases where the prostitute is knowingly [[HIV]]-positive. These laws, often known as felony prostitution laws, require anyone arrested for prostitution to be tested for HIV. If the test comes back positive the suspect is informed that any future arrest for prostitution will be a [[felony]] instead of a [[misdemeanor]]. Penalties for felony prostitution vary in the states that have such laws, with maximum sentences of typically 10 to 15 years in prison. An episode of ''[[Cops (TV series)|COPS]]'' which aired in the early 1990s detailed the impact of [[HIV/AIDS]] among prostitutes; this episode contributed to HIV/AIDS awareness.

'''India Pride Project''' ('''IPP''') is a group of art enthusiasts who uses social media to identify stolen religious artefacts from Indian temples and secure their return. Co-founded in 2014 by two Singapore-based art enthusiasts, S. Vijay Kumar and Anuraag Saxena, it now has activists from all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anuraag Saxena: Returning stolen art to India|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uq6b07Ln0Pc}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Facebook sleuths bring home India's stolen idols|url=http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/life-culture/facebook-sleuths-bring-home-indias-stolen-idols|website=[[Business Times (Singapore)|The Business Times]]|accessdate=2017-01-05|date=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=S Vijay|last=Kumar|title=India Pride Project - How Smuggled Indian Art Is Brought Back Home|url=http://swarajyamag.com/culture/how-smuggled-indian-art-brought-home|website=swarajyamag.com|accessdate=2017-01-05|date=7 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Nirmala|last=Ganapathy|title=Recovering India's stolen art pieces|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/recovering-indias-stolen-art-pieces|website=[[The Straits Times]]|accessdate=11 November 2018|date=10 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recoveries==

'''[[Sripuranthan Natarajan Idol|Dancing Shiva]]''': In 2014, it helped to secure the return of a US$5 million bronze statue of the Hindu god Shiva from the [[National Gallery of Australia]]. Named ''[[Sripuranthan Natarajan Idol|Dancing Shiva]]'', the statue was stolen from a Tamil Nadu temple and trafficked by [[Subhash Kapoor (art dealer)|Subhash Kapoor]], a former Manhattan art dealer who was later under the United States federal investigation known as Operation Hidden Idol. When the gallery denied the statue was stolen, IPP used the social media to publicize and compare the images of the stolen idol with the one on gallery's display. Since the arrest of Kapoor in 2012, United States has returned to India many artefacts recovered under Operation Hidden Idol.

Ms Donna Yates, a lecturer on antiquities trafficking at the [[University of Glasgow]], believes "the grassroots work of the IPP in documenting cases of theft and bringing them to public attention is crucial - and unmatched anywhere in the world."

'''[[Nalanda]]'s 12th century Buddha''': This  six-and-a-half-inch bronze (with traces of silver inlay) of the Buddha seated in the bhumisparsha mudra,  was stolen along with  13 other  statues  1961 from the [[Archaeological Survey of India]] (ASI) site museum in Nalanda.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.livemint.com/Politics/CQMHtZkX51woQKhGLHlmEO/On-Independence-Day-India-gets-back-its-12th-century-stolen.html On Independence Day, India gets back its 12th century stolen Buddha statue, Aditi Khanna, PTI, LiveMint, Aug 15 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;  It was noticed at a at a London auction. Fortunately a photographic record of the statue was saved by Sachindra S. Biswas, a retired director general of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). Kumar, is attempting  to pursue Indiaâs claim on another Buddha statue, suspected to be from the 1961 theft, currently  at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in the US.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.livemint.com/Leisure/MitejLdBdImh1v8DIM3VWN/How-the-mystery-of-the-Missing-Buddha-statue-was-solved.html  How the mystery of the Missing Buddha statue was solved, Bibek Bhattacharya, Aug 21 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3196">'''Jacob Isaacson''' (May 5, 1911 â September 8, 1980) was an American [[composer]] and [[musician]].
Isaacson was most noted for his own Colortone musical notation and his early works within this system. His association with the [[Fluxus]] movement was played down by Isaacson, who held European classical tradition in high regard, although his experimental and [[minimalist]] compositions drew inevitable comparison.

==Life==
Isaacson was born on May 5, 1911 in [[Midlothian, Virginia]] to Alfred and Martha Isaacson who relocated to nearby Chesterfield four years later. Isaacson developed a keen interest in music and a   proficiency at a number of instruments. He attended [[James River High School (Chesterfield County, Virginia)|James River High School]] in Chesterfield and returned in 1937 to teach Art and Music there.&lt;br&gt;
It was at James River High that Isaacson began a study of his [[synesthesia]], a mild case of which he had correctly diagnosed, and his own emotional response to color. His private, experimental, compositions, "doodled" pieces consisting of finely inked lines on a conventional stave, took on a more powerful and expressive form and, in 1950, by now a lecturer at [[Virginia State University]], he produced the first of his "Colortone" series.&lt;br&gt;
----
Isaacson's Colortone notation, in its purest form, demanded nothing more from the musician than an emotional, response to color and shape. Ability and proficiency were secondary to sensitivity and subtlety in "reading" both the score and one's musical partners. These compositions quickly became part of his classes at Virginia State.
----
A move to [[Mannes College]], New York, in 1951 encouraged fresh creativity, and by 1958 Isaacson had produced a further 8 Colortone pieces, the first of his four "Abstractions", and "For [[Diego Rivera]]", a tribute to the Mexican artist, who had died in November the previous year. Isaacson had put aside sheet music, favoring  slides, projections and abstract painting, and would not use printed scores again until his "Chromatics No. 1" in 1965.

==List of significant works==
The "Colortone" and "Abstractions" series can be performed by as many or as few musicians as conditions for performance allow and Isaacson refused to prescribe personnel for these pieces.

*''Colortone''  series 1 to 9 (1950â1957)
*''Abstractions''  series 1 to 4 (1955â1963)
*''For Diego Rivera''  (1958)  piano, brass septet, string quartet, orchestra.
*''Chromatics''  series 1 to 4 (1965â1974)  piano, 4 brass, recorder, violin, viola, cello, contrabass, orchestra, percussion,
*''Lucent Harmonic Color''  (1975)  magnetic tape, atlas marimba, percussion

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7203">A '''Jihad satire''' is a [[political satire]] that satirizes the idea of violent [[jihad]].

==As art==

The musical comedy ''[[Jihad! The Musical]]'' and the film ''[[Four Lions]]'' are works of art that satirise jihadis.&lt;ref name="Gardham"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/7594722/We-should-laugh-at-al-Qaeda-says-report.html|title=We should laugh at al-Qaeda, says report|last=Gardham|first=Duncan|date=April 16, 2010|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=21 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/wannabe-suicide-bombers-beware-chris-morris-movie-gets-goahead-1228152.html |title=Wannabe suicide bombers beware: Chris Morris movie gets go-ahead |first=GeneviÃ¨ve |last=Roberts |date=6 January 2009 |accessdate=20 May 2009 | work=The Independent | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WSJstaff&gt;[https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2010/03/17/trailer-for-jihad-satire-four-lions-debuts/  "'Four Lions' Jihad Satire Trailer Debuts,"] March 17, 2010, Wall Street Journal.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IHTrib&gt;[http://tribune.com.pk/story/7266/counter-terrorism-comedy/ "Counter-terrorism comedy,"] International Herald Tribune.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The Australian]]'' describes ''Four Lions'' as "a satire on Islamic jihadism and its murderous ambitions."&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/arts/jokes-on-jihad/story-e6frg8n6-1225906260351 "Jokes on jihad,"] Evan Williams, August 21, 2010, The Australian.&lt;/ref&gt;   The satirical ''Jihad! The Musical'' featured a hero who cheerfully sang, "I wanna be like Osama, I wanna bomb a path to fame across the Earth.  People may abhor me but by God, they won't ignore me, When the CIA determines what I'm worth."&lt;ref name=Gifford&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=13923077 "Fringe Fest 'Jihad' Musical Touches Explosive Topics,"] Rob Gifford, Aug, 24, 2007, National Public Radio.&lt;/ref&gt;

Comedian [[Jeff Dunham]]'s puppet character "Achmed the dead [[Islamic terrorism|terrorist]]" is a popular example of jihad satire in the United States.&lt;ref name=Time&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1901490,00.html Belinda Luscombe. "The Puppet Master" ''[[Time magazine|Time]]'' magazine; June 8, 2009].&lt;/ref&gt;  Achmed is a puppet who shouts, "Silence, I kill you!" whenever the audience laughs at something that offends his sensibilities.&lt;ref name=Purcell&gt;Achmed the dead terrorist and humor in popular geopolitics, Darren Purcell, Melissa Scott Brown and Mahmut Gokmen, GeoJournal, 31 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Dunham explains that he portrays Achmed as incompetent so that when the audience realise that the character is "a bumbling idiot with problems in life", they appreciate that he is human.&lt;ref name=Purcell/&gt;

==As healing==

Mental health professionals argue that humor and satire can alleviate the mental health impact of terror attacks, helping to heal the survivors of terror attacks and rescue personnel suffering the consequences of exposure to the horrors of deliberate mass murder.&lt;ref name=Purcell/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elaine Anne Pasquali, "Humor; An Antidote for Terrorism", ''[[Journal of Holistic Nursing]]'', Vol. 21, No. 4, 398-414 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Michael Bongar, ''Psychology of Terrorism'', Oxford University Press, 2007, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Mental health's role in combating terror,â" Derrick Hamaoka, Jun Shigemura, Molly Hall, Robert Ursano, ''Journal of Mental Health,'' 2004, Vol. 13, No. 6 : Pages 531-535.&lt;/ref&gt;

==As political strategy==

Arab-American comedian [[Ray Hanania]] has written, "If there were a bit of humor in the Middle East, I think that there might not be so much fanaticism. Humor can be a counter to the environment that breeds fanaticism and terrorism."&lt;ref name=Hanania&gt;Ray Hanania, ''I'm Glad I Look Like a Terrorist: Growing up Arab in America,'' U. S. G. Publishing, 1996, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[Psychology Today]]'',  humor is the most powerful tool to prevent individuals from becoming  Islamic suicide bombers, however, to be effective, the humor has to come from within the Muslim community and it has to be "aimed at the culture's sacred values."&lt;ref name=Fong&gt;[http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-me-in-we/201001/comedy-counter-terrorism  âComedy as Counter-Terrorism; Comedy as a Strategy of Counter-Terrorism,â] Molly Castelloe Fong, Ph.D. , Jan 26, 2010, Psychology Today.&lt;/ref&gt; According to psychologist Molly Castelloe Fong, "Humor has the potential to gradually, over time, alter what it means to be a heroic martyr in the mind of extremist groups."&lt;ref name=Fong/&gt;

[[Agence France-Presse]] has reported that "Satire and ridicule can help win the fight against Al-Qaeda by stripping it of its glamour and mystique."&lt;ref name=Moutot&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jtBqws_tP_7eOFEw0cdih33DNN_A "Fight Al-Qaeda with satire, ridicule: researchers"], Michel Moutot (AFP) â Apr 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Holden&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE63E6JT20100415 âDefeat al Qaeda by removing its "cool" image; The way to beat al Qaeda and stop Islamist groups gaining recruits to violent causes is to remove their "cool" image and make fun of terrorists instead, according to a major international study published on Friday,â] Michael Holden, April 15, 2010, Reuters.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Demos (UK think tank)|Demos]] group, a think tank in the United Kingdom, is among the academic institutions that have suggested that satire can be an effective tool in undermining support for  violent jihad.&lt;ref name=Gardham/&gt;  According to some terrorism experts, successful recruitment for violent jihad depends upon convincing potential recruits that jihadis are "pious warriors of God". They postulate that by "highlighting their incompetence, their moral failings, and their embarrassing antics", it may be possible to "undermine" support for violent jihadi organizations including [[Al Qaeda]] and the [[Taliban]].&lt;ref name="Byman"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/07/the-case-for-calling-them-nitwits/8130/|title=The Case for Calling Them Nitwits|last=Fair|first=Christine|date=JulyâAugust 2010|publisher=The Atlantic |accessdate=20 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers for Demos recommend satire as a means of undermining the popularity of violent jihad, noting that "satire has long been recognised as a powerful tool to undermine the popularity of social movements: both the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and the [[British Union of Fascists|British Fascist party]] in the 1930s were seriously harmed by sustained satire."&lt;ref name=Bartlett&gt;[http://www.demos.co.uk/publications/theedgeofviolence  ââThe Edge of Violence, A Radical Approach to Extremism,ââ] Jamie Bartlett, Jonathan Birdwell, April 16, 2010, Demos, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44469">'''Musical memory''' refers to the ability to remember music-related information, such as melodic content and other progressions of tones or pitches. The differences found between linguistic memory and musical memory have led researchers to theorize that musical memory is encoded differently from language and may constitute an independent part of the [[phonological loop]]. The use of this term is problematic, however, since it implies input from a verbal system, whereas music is in principle nonverbal.&lt;ref name="phil-496"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Deutsch, D. | title=The processing of pitch combinations In D. Deutsch (Ed.) | journal=The psychology of music, 3rd Edition | volume= | pages=249â325 | year=2013 |doi = 10.1016/B978-0-12-381460-9.00007-9}}  [http://philomel.com/pdf/PsyMus_3_Ch7_Pitch_Combinations.pdf PDF Document]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neurological bases==
Consistent with [[hemispheric lateralization]], there is evidence to suggest that the left and right hemispheres of the brain are responsible for different components of musical memory. By studying the learning curves of patients who have had damage to either their left or right medial [[temporal lobes]], Wilson &amp; Saling (2008) found hemispheric differences in the contributions of the left and right medial temporal lobes in melodic memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1525/mp.2008.25.4.303 |author1=Wilson S.J. |author2=Saling M.M. | year = 2008 | title = Contributions of the right and left medial temporal lobes to music memory: evidence from melodic learning difficulties | url = | journal = Music Perception | volume = 25 | issue = 4| pages = 303â314 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ayotte, Peretz, Rousseau, Bard &amp; Bojanowski (2000) found that those patients who had their left [[middle cerebral artery]] cut in response to an aneurysm suffered greater impairments when performing tasks of musical long-term memory, than those patients who had their right middle cerebral artery cut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1093/brain/123.9.1926 |author1=Ayotte J. |author2=Peretz I. |author3=Rousseau I. |author4=Bard C. |author5=Bojanowski M. | year = 2000 | title = Patterns of music [[agnosia]] associated with middle cerebral artery [[infract]]s | url = | journal = Brain | volume = 123 | issue = 9| pages = 1926â1938 | pmid = 10960056 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, they concluded that the left hemisphere is mainly important for musical representation in long-term memory, whereas the right is needed primarily to mediate access to this memory. Sampson and Zatorre (1991) studied patients with severe epilepsy who underwent surgery for relief as well as control subjects. They found deficits in memory recognition for text regardless of whether it was sung or spoken after a left, but not right temporal lobectomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0278-7393.17.4.793 |author1=Samson S. |author2=Zatorre R.J. | year = 1991 | title = Recognition memory for text and melody of songs after unilateral temporal lobe lesion: evidence for dual encoding | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition | volume = 17 | issue = 4| pages = 793â804 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, melody recognition when a tune was sung with new words (as compared to encoding) was impaired after either right ''or'' left temporal lobectomy. Finally, after a right but not left temporal lobectomy, impairments of melody recognition occurred in the absence of lyrics. This suggests dual memory codes for musical memory, with the verbal code utilizing the left temporal lobe structures and the melodic relying on the encoding involved.

==Semantic vs. episodic==
Platel (2005) defined musical semantic memory as memory for pieces without memory for the temporal or spatial elements; and musical episodic memory as memory for pieces and the context in which they were learned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1196/annals.1360.010 | author = Platel H | year = 2005 | title = Functional neuroimiging of semantic and episodic memory | url = | journal = New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1060 | issue = | pages = 136â147 |bibcode = 2005NYASA1060..136P }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found that two distinct patterns of neural activations existed when comparing semantic and episodic components of musical memory. Controlling for processes of early auditory analysis, working memory and mental imagery, Platel found that retrieval of semantic musical memory involved activation in the right inferior and middle frontal gyri, the superior and inferior right temporal gyri, the right anterior cingulate gyrus and [[parietal lobe]] region. There was also some activation in the middle and inferior frontal gyri in the left hemisphere. Retrieval of episodic musical memory resulted in activation bilaterally in the middle and superior frontal gyri and the precuneus. Although bilateral activation was found there was dominance in the right hemisphere. This research suggests independence of episodic and semantic musical memory. The [[Levitin Effect]] demonstrates accurate semantic memory for musical pitch and tempo among listeners, even without musical training, and without episodic memory of the original learning context.

==Individual differences==

===Sex===
Gaab, Keenan &amp; Schlaug (2003) found a difference between males and females in the processing and subsequent memory for pitch using fMRI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1162/089892903322370735 |author1=Gaab N. |author2=Keenan J.P. |author3=Schlaug G. | year = 2003 | title = The effects of sex on the neural substrates of pitch memory | url = | journal = Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience | volume = 15 | issue = 6| pages = 810â820 | pmid = 14511534 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, males showed more lateralized activity in the anterior and posterior perisylvin regions with greater activation in the left. Males also had more cerebellar activation than females did. However, females showed more posterior cingulate and [[retrosplenial cortex]] activation than did males. Nevertheless, it was demonstrated that the behavioural performance did not differ between males and females.

===Handedness===
It has been found by Deutsch&lt;ref name="phil-4"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1126/science.622558 | author=Deutsch, D. | title=Pitch memory: An advantage for the lefthanded. | journal=Science | volume=199 | issue=4328 | pages=559â560 | year=1978 | pmid=622558 |url=-http://philomel.com/pdf/Science-1978_199_559-560.pdf | format=PDF|bibcode = 1978Sci...199..559D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="phil-25"&gt;{{cite book | author=Deutsch, D. | isbn=978-0-12-343150-9 | editor=J. Herron | chapter=Handedness and Memory for Tonal Pitch |chapterurl=http://philomel.com/pdf/Ch-Handedness-1980.pdf | title=Neuropsychology of Lefthandedness | publisher= Academic Press| format=PDF| pages=263â271 | year=1980 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that lefthanders with mixed hand preference  outperform righthanders in tests of short-term memory for pitch.  This may be due to more storage of information on both sides of the brain by the mixed lefthanded group.

==Atypical cases==

===Expertise===
Experts have tremendous experience through practice and education in a particular field. Musical experts use some of the same strategies as do many experts in fields that require large amounts of memorization: chunking, organization and practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Noice H. |author2=Jeffrey J. |author3=Noice T. |author4=Chaffin R. | year = 2008 | title = Memorization by a jazz musician: a case study | url = | journal = Psychology of Music | volume = 36 | issue = 1| pages = 63â79 | doi = 10.1177/0305735607080834 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, musical experts may organize [[Musical note|note]]s into [[musical scale|scales]] or create a hierarchical retrieval scheme to facilitate retrieval from long-term memory. In a case study on an expert pianist, researchers Chaffin &amp; Imreh (2002) found that a retrieval scheme was developed to guarantee that the music was recalled with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.0956-7976.2002.00462.x |author1=Chaffin R. |author2=Imreh G. | year = 2002 | title = Practicing perfection: piano performance as expert memory | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 13 | issue = 4| pages = 342â349 | pmid = 12137137 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This expert used auditory and [[motor memory]] along with conceptual memory. Together the auditory and motor representations allow for automaticity during performance, whereas the conceptual memory is mainly used to mediate when the piece is getting off track. When studying concert soloists, Chaffin and Logan (2006) reiterate that a hierarchical organization exists in memory, but also take this a step further suggesting that they actually use a mental map of the piece allowing them to keep track of the progression of the piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.2478/v10053-008-0050-z |author1=Chaffin R. |author2=Logan T. | year = 2006 | title = Practicing perfection: how concert soloists prepare for performance | url = | journal = Advances in Cognitive Psychology | volume = 2 | issue = 2-3| pages = 113â130 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chaffin and Logan (2006) also demonstrate that there are performance cues that monitor the automatic aspects of performance and adjust them accordingly. They distinguish between basic performance cues, interpretive performance cues, and expressive performance cues. Basic cues monitor technical features, interpretive cues monitor changes made in different aspects of the piece, and expressive cues monitor the feelings of the music. These cues are developed when experts pay attention to a particular aspect during practice.

===Savantism===
A [[savant syndrome]] is described as a person with a low IQ but who has superior performance in one particular field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sloboda J. |author2=Hermelin B. |author3=O'Connor N. | year = 1985 | title = An exceptional musical memory | url = | journal = Music perception | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 155â170 | jstor=40285330 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sloboda, Hermelin and O'Connor (1985) discussed a patient, NP, who was able to memorize very complex musical pieces after hearing them three or four times. NP's performance exceeded that of experts with very high IQs. However, his performance on other memory tasks was average for a person with an IQ in his range. They used NP to suggest that high IQ is not needed for the skill of musical memorization and in fact, other factors must be influencing this performance. Miller (1987) also studied a 7 year old child who was said to be a musical savant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1177/0305735687151006 | author = Miller L.K. | year = 1987 | title = Determinants of melody span in a developmentally disabled musical savant | url = | journal = Psychology of Music | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 76â89 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This child had superior short-term memory for music that was found to be influenced by the attention given to the complexity of the music, the key signature, and repeated configurations within a string. Miller (1987) suggests that a savant's ability is due to encoding the information into already existing meaningful structures in long-term memory.

===Child prodigies===
Ruthsatz &amp; Detterman (2003) define a [[child prodigy|prodigy]] as a child (younger than 10) who is able to excel at "culturally relevant" tasks to an extent that even isn't seen often in professionals in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0160-2896(03)00050-3 |author1=Ruthsatz J. |author2=Detterman K. | year = 2003 | title = An extraordinary memory: The case study of a musical prodigy | url = | journal = Intelligence | volume = 31 | issue = 6| pages = 509â518 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They describe a case of one particular boy who had already released two CDs (on which he sings in 2 different languages) and was able to play several instruments by the age of 6.

Other observations that were made of this young child were that he had:
* performed numerous concerts
* appeared twice on national TV
* appeared in two movies
* played highly expressive music
* come from a family with no particular abilities in music
* never had lessons, he had just listened to others' pieces used improvisation
* an IQ of 132 (two [[standard deviation]]s above the average)
* an extraordinary memory in all domains

==Amusia==
[[Amusia]] is also known as tone deafness. Amusics primarily have deficits in processing pitch. They also have problems with musical memory, singing and timing. Amusics also cannot tell melodies apart from their rhythm or beat. However, amusics can recognize other sounds at a normal level (i.e. lyrics, voices, and sounds from the environment), therefore demonstrating that amusia is not due to deficits in exposure, hearing or cognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1159/000089606 | author = Pearce J.M.S. | year = 2005 | title = Selected observations on amusia | url = | journal = European Neurology | volume = 54 | issue = 3| pages = 145â158 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on non-musical memory==
Music has been shown to improve memory in several situations. In one study of musical effects on memory, visual cues (filmed events) were paired with background music. Later, participants who could not recall details of the scene were presented with the background music as a cue and recovered the inaccessible scene information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.3758/BF03197154 |author1=Boltz M. |author2=Schulkind M. |author3=Kantra S. | year = 1991 | title = Effects of background music on the remembering of filmed events | url = | journal = Memory and Cognition | volume = 19 | issue = 6| pages = 593â606 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other research provides support for memory of text being improved by musical training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wallace W. T. | author2 = Siddiqua, N. | year = 1994 | author3 = Harun-ar-Rashid, A. K. M. | title = Memory for Music: Effects of Melody on Recall of Text | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition | volume = 20 | issue = 6| pages = 1471â1485 | doi = 10.1088/0954-3899/20/9/016 | bibcode = 1994JPhG...20.1471I }}&lt;/ref&gt; Words presented by song were remembered significantly better than when presented by speech. Earlier research has supported for this finding, that advertising jingles that pair words with music are remembered better than words alone or spoken words with music in the background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0021-9010.76.2.268 | author = Yalch R | year = 1991 | title = Memory in a Jingle Jungle: Music as a Mnemonic Device in Communicating Advertising Slogans | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Psychology | volume = 76 | issue = 2| pages = 268â275 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Memory was also enhanced for pairing brands with their proper slogans if the advertising incorporated lyrics and music rather than spoken words and music in the background.

Training in music has also been shown to improve verbal memory in children and adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0894-4105.17.3.439 |author1=Ho Y. |author2=Cheung M. |author3=Chan Agnes | year = 2003 | title = Music training improves verbal but not visual memory: Cross-sectional and longitudinal explorations in children | url = | journal = Neuropsychology | volume = 17 | issue = 3| pages = 439â450 | pmid = 12959510 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants trained in music and participants without a musical background were tested for immediate recall of words and recall of words after 15 minute delays. Word lists were presented orally to each participant 3 times and then participants recalled as many words as they could. Even when matched for intelligence, the musically trained participants tested better than non-musically trained participants. The authors of this research suggest that musical training enhances verbal memory processing due to [[neuroanatomical]] changes in the left temporal lobe, (responsible for verbal memory) which is supported by previous research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Chan A. |author2=Ho Y. |author3=Cheung M. | year = 1998 | title = Music training improves verbal memory | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 396 | issue = 6707| page = 128 | doi = 10.1038/24075 | bibcode = 1998Natur.396..128C }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[MRI]] has been used to show that this region of the brain is larger in musicians than non-musicians, which may be due to changes in cortical organization contributing to improved cognitive function.

Anecdotal evidence, from an amnesic patient named CH who suffered from declarative memory deficits, was obtained supporting a preserved memory capacity for song titles. CH's unique knowledge of accordion music allowed for experimenters to test verbal and musical associations. When presented with song titles CH was able to successfully play the correct song 100% of the time, and when presented with the melody she chose the appropriate title from several distractors with a 90% success rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/13554790008402712 |author1=Baur B. |author2=Uttner I. |author3=Ilmberger J. |author4=Fesl G. |author5=Mai N. | year = 2000 | title = Music Memory Provides Access to Verbal Knowledge in a Patient with Global Amnesia | url = | journal = Neurocase | volume = 6 | issue = 5| pages = 415â421 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interference==
Interference occurs when information in short-term memory interferes with or obstructs the retrieval of other information. Some researchers believe that interference in memory for pitch is due to a general limited capacity of the short-term memory system, regardless of the type of information that it retains. However, Deutsch has shown that memory for pitch is subject to interference based on the presentation of other pitches but not by the presentation of spoken numbers.&lt;ref name="phil-14"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1126/science.168.3939.1604 | author=Deutsch, D. | title=Tones and numbers: Specificity of interference in immediate memory. | journal=Science | volume=168 | issue=3939 | pages=1604â1605 | year=1970 | pmid=5420547 |url=http://philomel.com/pdf/Science-1970_168_1604-1605.pdf | format=PDF |bibcode = 1970Sci...168.1604D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further work
has shown that short-term memory for the pitch of a tone is subject to highly specific effects produced by other tones, which depend on the pitch relationship between the interfering tones and the tone to be remembered.&lt;ref name="phil-31"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1126/science.175.4025.1020 | author=Deutsch, D. | title=Mapping of Interactions in the Pitch Memory Store. | journal=Science | volume=175 | issue=4025 | pages=1020â1022 | year=1972 | pmid=5009395 |bibcode = 1972Sci...175.1020D }} [http://philomel.com/pdf/Science-1972_175_1020-1022.pdf PDF Document]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="phil-34"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Deutsch, D. | title=The organization of short term memory for a single acoustic attribute.

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="phil-32"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.3758/BF03203217 |author1=Deutsch, D.  |author2=Feroe, J.  |lastauthoramp=yes | title=Disinhibition in pitch memory. | journal=Perception &amp; Psychophysics | volume=17 | issue=3 | pages=320â324 | year=1975 }} [http://philomel.com/pdf/PandP-1975_17_320-324.pdf PDF Document]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="phil-23"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Deutsch, D. | title=Processing of pitch combinations.

Any additional information present at the time of comprehension has the ability to displace the target information from short-term memory. Therefore, there is potential that one's ability to understand and remember will be compromised if one studies with the television or radio on.&lt;ref&gt;Radvansky, G. (2006). ''Human Memory''. Pearson / Allyn and Bacon&lt;/ref&gt;

While studies have reported inconsistent results with regards to music's effect on memory, it has been demonstrated that music is able to interfere with various memory tasks. It has been demonstrated that new situations require new combinations of cognitive processing. This subsequently results in conscious attention being drawn to novel aspects of situations.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, B.(2000) ''Music and memory: An introduction''. The MIT Press. Cambridge 291.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the loudness of music presentation along with other musical elements can assist in distracting one from normal responses by encouraging attentiveness to the musical information.&lt;ref name="wolfe1983"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.2307/3345172 | author = Wolfe D.E. | year = 1983 | title = Effects of Music Loudness on Task Performance and Self-Report of College-Aged Students | url = | journal = Journal of Research in Music Education | volume = 31 | issue = 3| pages = 191â201 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Attention and recall have been shown to be negatively affected by the presence of a distraction.&lt;ref name="Furnham"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1099-0720(199710)11:5&lt;445::AID-ACP472&gt;3.0.CO;2-R |author1=Furnham A. |author2=Bradley A. | year = 1997 | title = Music While You Work: The Differential Distraction of Background Music on the Cognitive Test Performance of Introverts and Extraverts | url = | journal = Applied Cognitive Psychology | volume = 11 | issue = 5| pages = 445â455 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wolfe (1983) cautions that educators and therapists should be made aware of the potential for environments with sounds occurring simultaneously from many sources (musical and non-musical) to distract and interfere with student learning.&lt;ref name="wolfe1983" /&gt;

===Introversion and extroversion===
Researchers Campbell and Hawley (1982) provided evidence of the regulation of arousal differences between introverts and extroverts. They found that when studying in a library, extroverts were more likely to choose to work in areas with bustle and activity, while introverts were more likely to choose a quiet, secluded area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/00140130210121932 |author1=Furnham A. |author2=Strbac L. | year = 2002 | title = Music is as distracting as noise: the diVerential distraction of background music and noise on the cognitive test performance of introverts and extroverts | url = | journal = Ergonomics | volume = 45 | issue = 3| pages = 203â217 | pmid = 11964204 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, [[Adrian Furnham]] and Anna Bradley discovered that introverts presented with music at the time of two cognitive tasks (prose recall and reading comprehension) performed significantly worse on a test of memory recall than extroverts who were also presented with music at the time of the tasks. However, if music was not present at the time of the tasks, introverts and extroverts performed at the same level.&lt;ref name="Furnham"/&gt;

===Hemispheric interference===
Recent research has demonstrated that the normal right hemisphere of the brain responds to melody holistically, consistent with [[Gestalt Psychology]], whereas the left hemisphere of the brain evaluates melodic passages in a more analytic fashion, similar to the feature-detecting capacity of the left hemisphere's visual field.&lt;ref name="regalski1977"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.2307/3395266 | author = Regelski T.A. | year = 1977 | title = Who Knows Where Music Lurks in the Mind of Man? New Brain Research Has the Answer | journal = Music Educators Journal | volume = 63 | issue = 9| pages = 30â38 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Regalski (1977) demonstrated that while listening to the melody of the popular carol "Silent Night", the right hemisphere thinks, "Ah, yes, Silent Night", while the left hemisphere thinks, "two sequences: the first a literal repetition, the second a repetition at different pitch levelsâah, yes, Silent Night by Franz Gruber, typical pastorate folk style." The brain for the most part works well when each hemisphere performs its own function while solving a task or problem; the two hemispheres are quite complementary. However, situations arise when the two modes are in conflict, resulting in one hemisphere interfering with the operation of the other hemisphere.&lt;ref name="regalski1977" /&gt;

==Testing==

===Absolute pitch===
[[Absolute pitch]] (AP) is the ability to produce or recognize specific pitches without reference to an external standard.&lt;ref name="Levitin"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.3758/BF03206733 | author = Levitin D. J. | year = 1994 | title = Absolute memory for musical pitch: Evidence from the production of learned melodies | url = | journal = Perception &amp; Psychophysics | volume = 56 | issue = 4| pages = 414â423 | pmid=7984397}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="phil-494"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Deutsch, D. | title=Absolute pitch In D. Deutsch (Ed.) | journal=The psychology of music, 3rd Edition | volume= | pages=141â182 | year=2013 |doi = 10.1016/B978-0-12-381460-9.00005-5 }} [http://philomel.com/pdf/PsyMus_3_Ch5_Absolute_Pitch.pdf PDF Document]&lt;/ref&gt; People boasting AP have internalized pitch references, and thus are able to maintain stable representations of pitch in long-term memory. AP is regarded as a rare and somewhat mysterious ability, occurring in as few as 1 in 10,000 people. A method commonly used to test for AP is as follows: subjects are first asked to close their eyes and imagine that a specific song is playing in their heads. Encouraged to start anywhere in the tune they like, subjects are then instructed to try to reproduce the tones of that song by singing, humming, or whistling. Productions made by the subject are then recorded on digital audio tape, which accurately preserves the pitches they sing avoiding the potential pitch and speed fluctuations of analog recording. Lastly, the subjects' productions are compared to the actual tones sung by the artists on the CDs. Errors are measured in semitone deviations from the correct pitch.&lt;ref name= "Levitin"/&gt; This test, however, does not determine whether or not the subject has true absolute pitch, but rather is a test of implicit absolute pitch. Where true absolute pitch is concerned, Deutsch and colleagues have shown that music conservatory students who are speakers of tone languages  have a far higher prevalence of absolute pitch than do speakers of nontone languages such as English.&lt;ref name="phil-388"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Deutsch, D., Dooley, K., Henthorn, T. and Head, B. | title=Absolute pitch among students in an American music conservatory: Association with tone language fluency | journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America | volume=125 | issue=4 | pages=2398â2403 | year=2009 | doi=10.1121/1.3081389 | pmid=19354413|bibcode = 2009ASAJ..125.2398D }} [http://scitation.aip.org/vsearch/servlet/VerityServlet?KEY=ASADL&amp;smode=strresults&amp;sort=rel&amp;maxdisp=25&amp;threshold=0&amp;pjournals=ARLOFJ%2CJASMAN%2CNOCOAN%2CSOUCAU%2CPMARCW%2CATCODK%2CASASTR&amp;possible1=Absolute+pitch+among+students+in+an+American+music+conservatory&amp;possible1zone=article&amp;OUTLOG=NO&amp;viewabs=JASMAN&amp;key=DISPLAY&amp;docID=2&amp;page=0&amp;chapter=0 Weblink] [http://philomel.com/pdf/JASA-2009_125_2398-2403.pdf PDF Document]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="phil-43"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Deutsch, D., Henthorn, T., Marvin, E., &amp; Xu H-S | title=Absolute pitch among American and Chinese conservatory students: Prevalence differences, and evidence for a speech-related critical period. | journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America | volume=119 | issue=2 | pages=719â722 | year=2006 | doi=10.1121/1.2151799 | pmid=16521731|bibcode = 2006ASAJ..119..719D }} [http://philomel.com/pdf/JASA-2006_119_719-722.pdf PDF Document]

===Testing===
The ability to recognize incorrect pitch (musical) is most often tested by using the Distorted Tunes Test (DTT). The DTT was originally developed in the 1940s and was used in large studies in the British population. The DTT measures musical pitch recognition ability on an ordinal scale, scored as the number of correctly classified tunes. More specifically the DTT is used to evaluate subjects on how well they judge whether simple popular melodies contain notes with incorrect pitch. Researchers have used this method to investigate genetic correlates of musical pitch recognition in both monozygotic and dizygotic twins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Drayna D. |author2=Manichaikul A. |author3=Lange M. |author4=Snieder H. |author5=Spector T. | year = 2001 | title = Genetic correlates of musical pitch recognition in humans | url = | journal = Science | volume = 291 | issue = 5510| pages = 1969â1972 | pmid = 11239158 | doi = 10.1126/science.291.5510.1969 | bibcode = 2001Sci...291.1969D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Drayna, Manichaikul, Lange, Snieder and Spector (2001) determined that the variation in musical pitch recognition is primarily due to highly heritable differences in auditory functions not tested by conventional audiologic methods. Therefore, the DTT method may provide a benefit to advancing research studies similar to this one.

===In infants===
The following testing procedure has been used to assess infants' ability to recall familiar, yet complex pieces of music,&lt;ref name="Ilari" /&gt; and also their preference for timbre and tempo.&lt;ref name="trainor"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2004.00348.x |author1=Trainor L.J. |author2=Wu L. |author3=Tsang C.D. | year = 2004 | title = Long-term memory for music: infants remember tempo and timbre | url = | journal = Developmental Science | volume = 7 | issue = 3| pages = 289â296 | pmid = 15595370 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following procedure has demonstrated not only that infants attend longer to familiar than to unfamiliar pieces of music but also that infants remember the tempo and timbre of the familiarized melodies over long periods of time. This has been demonstrated by the fact that by changing the tempo or timbre at test, one eliminates an infant's preference for the novel melody. Thus, indicating that infants' long-term memory representations are not simply of the abstract musical structure, but contain surface or performance features as well. This testing procedure contains three phases:
#Familiarization: The selected musical piece is given to parents/caretakers on a CD. Parents and caretakers are instructed to listen to the musical piece three times a day, when the infant is in a quiet and alert state and the home environment is calm and peaceful.
#Retention: CDs are collected from the parents/caretakers immediately after the familiarization phase to ensure that no listening of the familiar piece occurs during the two-week retention phase.
#Test: Finally, infants are tested in the lab using the Headturn-preference procedure, a behavioral data-collection tool that measures preferences for one kind of auditory stimulus over another. The Headturn-preference procedure maintains that an infant will turn its head towards a stimulus it prefers. This procedure is conducted in a testing booth, with the infant sitting on the lap of his or her mother. A light is located on either side of the infant. The trial begins when the infant is looking straight ahead. Mother and experimenter are required to wear tight-fitting earphones which deliver masking music for the duration of the entire procedure. This is done to guarantee that neither mother, nor experimenter bias the infant's response. During each trial, one sidelight flashes, urging the infant to look at it. Once the infant turns his or her head and looks at the light, the sound stimulus is played. The stimulus continues to play until the sound finishes or the infant looks away. When the infant turns away from the source for at least two seconds, sound and light turn off and the trial ends. A new trial begins when the infant looks at the center panel again.&lt;ref name="Ilari"&gt;Ilari, B. S. (July 2002).

==Lyrical vs. instrumental memory==
Many students listen to music while they study. Many of these students maintain that the reasons why they listen to music are to prevent drowsiness and to maintain their arousal for study. Some even believe that background music facilitates better work performance.&lt;ref name="Iwanaga"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Iwanaga M. |author2=Ito T. | year = 2002 | title = Disturbance effect of music on processing of verbal and spatial memories | url = | journal = Perceptual and Motor Skills | volume = 94 | issue = 3 Pt 2| pages = 1251â1258 | pmid = 12186247 | doi=10.2466/pms.2002.94.3c.1251}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Salame and Baddeley (1989) showed that both vocal and instrumental music interfered with performance of linguistic memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Salame P. |author2=Baddeley A. D. | year = 1989 | title = Effects of background music on phonological short-term memory | url = | journal = Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 41A | issue = 4| pages = 107â122 |doi = 10.1080/14640748908402355 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They explained that disturbance in performance was caused by task-irrelevant phonological information using resources in the working memory system.&lt;ref name="Iwanaga" /&gt; This disturbance can be explained by the fact that the linguistic component of music can occupy the phonological loop, similar to the way speech does.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.3758/BF03196503 |vauthors=Hanley JR, Bakopoulou E | year = 2003 | title = Irrelevant speech, articulatory suppression, and phonological similarity: A test of the phonological loop model and the feature model | url = | journal = Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review | volume = 10 | issue = 2| pages = 435â444 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is further demonstrated by the fact that vocal music has been perceived to interfere more with memory than instrumental music and nature sound music.&lt;ref name= "Iwanaga"/&gt; Rolla (1993) explains that lyrics, being language, develop images that allow for the interpretation of experience in the communicative process.&lt;ref name="Rolla"&gt;Rolla, G. M. (1993) Your inner music: Creative Analysis and Music Memory. Workbook/Journal. Chiron Publications. Wilmette, Illinois.&lt;/ref&gt; Current research coincides with this idea and maintains that the sharing of experience by language in song may communicate feeling and mood much more directly than either language itself or instrumental music alone. Vocal music also affects emotion and mood much more swiftly than instrumental music.&lt;ref name="Rolla"/&gt; However, Fogelson (1973) reported instrumental music interfered with children's performance on a reading comprehension test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fogelson S | year = 1973 | title = Music as a distractor on reading-test performance of eighth grade students | url = | journal = Perceptual &amp; Motor Skills | volume = 36 | issue = | pages = 1265â1266 | doi=10.2466/pms.1973.36.3c.1265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
Neural structures form and become more sophisticated as a result of experience. For example, the preference for consonance, the harmony or agreement of components, over dissonance, an unstable tone combination, is found early in development. Research suggests that this is due to both the experiencing of structured sounds and the fact they stem from development of the basilar membrane and auditory nerve, two early developing structures in the brain.&lt;ref name="Hannon"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hannon Erin E. |author2=Trainor Laurel J. | year = 2007 | title = Music acquisition: effects of enculturation and formal training on development | url =http://www.stefan-koelsch.de/papers4guidel/Hannon+_TICS2007_music-acquisition-training-enculturation-development.pdf | format=PDF | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 11 | issue = 11| pages = 466â472 | doi=10.1016/j.tics.2007.08.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An incoming auditory stimulus evokes responses measured in the form of an [[Event-related potential]] (ERP), measured brain responses resulting directly from a thought or perception. There is a difference in ERP measures for normally developing infants ranging from 2â6 months in age. Measures in infants 4 months and older demonstrate faster, more negative ERPs. In contrast, newborns and infants up to 4 months of age show slow, unsynchronized, positive ERPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0167-8760(03)00148-X |vauthors=Trainor L, McFadden M, Hodgson L, Darragh L, Barlow J, Matsos L, Sonnadara R | year = 2003 | title = Changes in auditory cortex and the development of mismatch negativity between 2 and 6 months of age | url = | journal = International Journal of Psychophysiology | volume = 51 | issue = 1| pages = 5â15 | pmid = 14629918 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Trainor, et al. (2003) hypothesized that these results indicated that responses from infants less than four months of age are produced by subcortical auditory structures, whereas with older infants responses tend to originate in the higher cortical structures.

===Relative and absolute pitch===
There are two methods of encoding/remembering music. The first process is known as ''relative pitch'', which refers to a person's ability to identify the intervals between given tones. Therefore, the song is learned as a continuous succession of intervals. Some people can also use ''absolute pitch'' in the process; this is ability to name or replicate a tone without reference to an external standard. Relative pitch has also been credited by some with being the more sophisticated of the two processes as it allows for quick recognition regardless of pitch, timbre or quality, as well as having the ability to produce physiological responses, for example, if the melody violates the learned relative pitch.&lt;ref name="Hannon"/&gt; Relative pitch has been shown to develop at varying rates dependent on culture. Trehub and Schellenberg (2008) found that 5- and 6-year-old Japanese children performed significantly better at a task requiring the utilization of relative pitch than same-aged Canadian children. They hypothesized that this could be because the Japanese children have more exposure to pitch accent via Japanese language and culture than the predominantly stressed environment Canadian children experience.

===Plasticity of musical development===
Early acquisition of relative pitch allows for accelerated learning of scales and intervals. Musical training assists with the attentional and executive functioning necessary to interpret and efficiently encode music. In conjunction with [[neuroplasticity|brain plasticity]], these processes become more and more stable. However, this process expresses a degree of [[circular logic]] in that the more learning that takes place, the greater the stability of the processes, ultimately decreasing overall brain plasticity.&lt;ref name="Hannon"/&gt; This could possibly explain the discrepancy in amount of effort both children and adults have to put into mastering new tasks.

==Models==

===Modal model===
Atkinson and Shiffrin's 1968 model consists of separate components for short and long term memory storage. It states that short-term memory is limited by its capacity and duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Atkinson R. C. |author2=Shiffrin R. M. |year=1968 |title= Human Memory: A proposed system and its control processes | url=http://www.rca.ucsd.edu/selected_papers/2_Human%20memory_A%20proposed%20system%20and%20its%20control%20processes.pdf | format=PDF | journal=Psychology of learning and motivation | volume=2 | pages=89â195 | doi = 10.1016/S0079-7421(08)60422-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that musical short-term memory is stored differently from verbal short-term memory. Berz (1995) found dissimilar results for the correlation between modality and recency effects in language versus music, suggesting that different encoding processes are engaged.&lt;ref name="Berz"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Berz W. L. | year = 1995 | title = Working Memory in Music; A Theoretical Model | doi = 10.2307/40286188 | journal = Music Perception | volume = 12 | issue = 3| pages = 353â364 | jstor=40286188}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berz also demonstrated different levels of interference on tasks as a result of language stimulus vs. musical stimulus. Finally Berz provided evidence for a separate store theory through the "Unattended Music Effect", stating "If there was a singular acoustic store, unattended instrumental music would cause the same disruptions on verbal performance as would unattended vocal music or unattended vocal speech; this, however, [is] not the case".&lt;ref name="Berz"/&gt;

===Baddeley and Hitch's model of working memory===
Baddeley and Hitch's 1974 Model consists of three components; one main component, the [[central executive]] and two sub components, the [[phonological loop]] and the [[visuospatial sketchpad]].&lt;ref&gt;Baddeley, A. (1990) Human Memory: Theory and practice, Boston: Allyn and Bacon&lt;/ref&gt; The central executive's primary role is to mediate between the two sub-systems. The visuospatial sketchpad holds information about what we see. The phonological loop can be further divided into: the Articulatory control system, the "inner voice" responsible for verbal rehearsal; and the Phonological store, the "inner ear" responsible for speech-based storage. Major criticisms of this model include a lack of musical processing/encoding and an ignorance towards other sensory inputs regarding the encoding and storage of olfactory, gustatory, and tactile inputs.&lt;ref name="Berz"/&gt;

===Theoretical model of memory===
This theoretical model proposed by William Berz (1995) is based on the Baddeley and Hitch model.&lt;ref name="Berz"/&gt; However, Berz modified the model to include a musical memory loop as a loose addition (meaning, almost a separate loop altogether) to the phonological loop. This new musical perceptual loop contains musical inner speech in addition to the verbal inner speech provided by the original phonological loop. He also proposed another loop to include other sensory inputs that were disregarded in the Baddeley and Hitch model.&lt;ref name="Berz"/&gt;

===Koelsch's model===
In a model outlined by Stefan Koelsch and Walter Siebel, music stimuli are perceived in a successive timeline, breaking down the auditory input into different characteristics and meaning. He maintained that upon perception the sound reaches the auditory nerve, brainstem and thalamus. At this point features involving pitch height, chroma, timbre, intensity and roughness are extracted. This occurs about at about 10â100[[millisecond|ms]]. Next, melodic and rhythmic grouping occurs, which is then perceived by auditory sensory memory. After this, an analysis is made of intervals and chord progressions. A harmony is then built upon the structure of metre, rhythm and timbre. This occurs from about 180â400ms after the initial perception. Following this, structural reanalysis and repair occur, at about 600â900ms. Finally, the autonomic nervous system and multimodal association cortices are activated. Koelsch and Siebel proposed that from about 250â500ms, based on the sound's meaning, interpretation and emotion occurs continuously throughout this process. This is indicated by [[N400 (neuroscience)|N400]], a negative spike at 400ms, as measured by an "event related potential".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Koelsch S. |author2=Siebel W.

The term '''mutual shaping''' was developed through [[Science and Technology Studies]] (STS) in an attempt to explain the detailed process of technological design.&lt;ref&gt;Quan-Haase, A. (2013). Technology and society: Social networks, power, and inequality. Oxford University Press. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Mutual shaping is a combination of [[social determinism]] and [[technological determinism]], suggesting that society and technology are not mutually exclusive to one another and, instead, influence and shape each other.&lt;ref&gt;Quan-Haase, A. (2013). Technology and society: Social networks, power, and inequality. Oxford University Press. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison of TD and SD ==
[[Technological determinism]] (TD), coined by [[Thorstein Veblen]], suggests that technology is the primary catalyst for change in society. Following this theory, the development and implementation of technology is beyond the control of society as it is pervasive in all elements of our lives. Once a technology has been created its influence on society is an inevitable, predetermined path. An example that supports technological determinism is the development of the [[printing press]] that accelerated the [[Protestant Reformation]].&lt;ref&gt;Humphreys, L. (2010). Technological determinism. In S. Priest (Ed.), Encyclopedia of science and technology communication. (pp. 870-873). Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, Inc. {{DOI|10.4135/9781412959216.n293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, social determinism (SD), popularized by social theorists [[Karl Marx]] and [[Emile Durkheim]], purports that social structure is the driving factor towards change in society.&lt;ref&gt;Determinism. (2001). In World of sociology, Gale. Retrieved from http://esearch.credoreference.com/content/entry/worldsocs/determinism/0&lt;/ref&gt; Following this view, society is the governing force that determines social behaviour, and technology is created and adapted based on societyâs wants and needs.&lt;ref&gt;Mahood, Aurelea. (2008). Social and technological determinism. CultureNet @ CapilanoU. Retrieved from http://culturenet.wordpress.com/2008/03/07/social-and-technological-determinism/&lt;/ref&gt;

Both TD and SD are cause-and-effect theories suggesting that technology and society are mutually exclusive. The theory of mutual shaping suggests that technology design is a result of a synthesis of TD and SD. It sees technology and society working together to facilitate change. Society changes as a direct result of the implementation of technology that has been created based on societyâs wants and needs. They function collectively to shape one another.&lt;ref&gt;Quan-Haase, A. (2013). Technology and society: Social networks, power, and inequality. Oxford University Press. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In social networks ==
Mutual shaping is exemplified through the integration of online [[Social networking|social networking platforms]] into daily life. They are a [[communications technology]] designed to complement pre-existing methods of communication, such as the phone or in-person conversations, that have become more convenient and/or affordable than their predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wellman | first1 = B. | last2 = Quan-Haase | first2 = A. | last3 = Witte | first3 = J. | last4 = Hampton | first4 = K. | year = 2013 | title = Does the internet increase, decrease, or supplement social capital?: Social networks, participation, and community commitment | url = | journal = American Behavioral Scientist| volume =  45| issue = | pages =  436â455 [440] | doi = 10.1177/00027640121957286 }}&lt;/ref&gt; TD would argue that these communication technologies have directly influenced our networking capabilities due to their accessibility. Without them we would not be able to conduct business or maintain friendships over long distances. SD would argue that these platforms were created as a result of a need to facilitate communication over long distances.&lt;ref&gt;Quan-Haase, A. (2013). Technology and society: Social networks, power, and inequality. Oxford University Press. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Mutual shaping supports both of these arguments, believing that the two cannot be separated. Social networking platforms display how technology and society are inextricably linked as they work together towards the advancement of one another, exemplifying the theory of mutual shaping.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4349">{{Refimprove|date=May 2017}}'''Notional [[election]] results''' are calculations made, usually following boundary changes of electoral districts brought about by population shifts, to determine what election results would have been in previous elections had the newly created boundaries then been in place.  Such calculations are used by psephologists and media for the purposes of detecting changing voting patterns and swings from one party to another from one election to the next, which is easier to calculate when no boundary changes have been implemented.

==Use in United Kingdom elections==
Boundary reviews can favour a particular political party, as notional election calculations have found.  In the case of the [[United Kingdom]], the Conservative Party usually benefits slightly due to population shifts away from inner cities towards suburban areas, where the Conservative Party has a stronger vote base.  Consequently, representation in inner city areas - usually areas where the Labour Party has its strongest voter base - declines as its population declines.

Notional election result calculations are of particular importance in the United Kingdom because the country is unusual in not releasing official breakdowns in voting data, which enables such data to be applied to electoral areas which are subject to boundary changes.  Parliamentary constituencies are based on smaller local government wards, and it is the results from local government elections that are the primary source used to calculate notional results at a constituency level.

Professors [[Colin Rallings]] and [[Michael Thrasher]] of [[Plymouth University]] have been involved in calculating notional results for general elections since 1992 where periodic boundary changes have taken place.  The data compiled from their work has been used by several prominent media companies including television channels for the purposes of comparing one general election result to the last.

Notional results have their limitations in that voting patterns may well have been different had new boundaries been in force at previous elections, because some voters who vote tactically may have chosen to vote differently under different boundaries, depending on which political parties or candidates were most competitive under old boundaries.

Other problems with making notional calculations is that people vote differently between national and local elections, particularly as many councilors enjoy a cross-party personal vote.  Local factors can also have a great effect on voting patterns.  In addition, a large number of wards are not contested by all the major political parties, some of them electing independent candidates or candidates from residents' associations.  Sometimes wards themselves are subject to boundary changes.

On a national level, notional general election results by constituency have been calculated in the UK on numerous occasions in the past by academics and election experts such as Rallings and Thrasher, when boundary changes have been implemented. 

In the February 1974 general election, notional results from the previous general election in 1970 were calculated on behalf of the [[BBC]] in constituencies where major boundary changes took effect.
In 1983, extensive boundary changes led to notional general election results being jointly calculated by the BBC and ITN for the previous general election in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0261-3794(83)80028-6 |title=The 1983 boundary commission: Policies and effects |journal=Electoral Studies |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=195â206 |year=1983 |last1=Waller |first1=Robert J. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further notional results were created for the 1997 general election (to compare with the 1992 general election), in 2005 (to take into account the reduction in the number of Scottish constituencies brought about by the establishment of the [[Scottish Parliament]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Gerry |last1=Hassan |first2=Douglas |last2=Fraser |year=2004 |title=The political guide to modern Scotland: people, places and power |location=London |publisher=Politico's |isbn=978-1-84275-047-6 }}{{pn|date=May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 2010 general election (to compare with the 2005 general election).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4938">'''Out from Under: Disability, History and Things to Remember''' is a [[traveling exhibition]] that explores the [[history]] of [[disability]] within the lives of Canadians.

The exhibition was produced in collaboration with students, scholars and [[alumni]] from the School of Disability Studies at [[Ryerson University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ofu.ryerson.ca/about/index.html |title=Out from Under: Disability, History and Things to Remember |publisher=Ryerson University |accessdate=2011-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition originated from a special topic seminar designed to uncover the hidden history of disability in Canada. Each student identified an [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]] to explore that represented a particular moment in Canadian disability history. Thirteen objects were then selected for the exhibition, revealing [[narratives]] that pay homage to the resilience, creativity, and the civic and cultural contributions of Canadians with disabilities. Accompanying interpretive texts help confront [[stereotypical]] representations of disability such as [[pity]], [[wikt:inspiration|inspiration]] or [[freak]], helping to illustrate the complexity of disability struggles for social and political acknowledgement, [[Identity (social science)|identity]], survival and remembrance.

Out from Under is curated by three [[Faculty (teaching staff)|faculty]] members from Ryerson Universityâs School of [[Disability Studies]].

==Exhibition components==
Each objectsâ history is represented by a single word title: Digging, Labouring, Dressing, Fixing, Measuring, Naming, Breathing, Remembering, Packing, Trailblazing, Struggling, Leading and Aspiring.

==Accessibility features==
'''[[American Sign Language]]'''
[[Video]] [[podcast]] of all exhibit text in American Sign Language.

'''[[Audio description]] and [[Touch]] Stations'''

'''The Pirbright Institute''' (formerly the '''Institute for Animal Health''') is a [[research institute]] in [[Surrey]], England, dedicated to the study of [[infectious disease]]s of [[livestock|farm animals]]. It forms part of the [[Her Majesty's Government|UK government's]] [[Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council]] (BBSRC). The Institute employs scientists, vets, PhD students and operations staff.

==History==
It began in 1914 to test cows for [[tuberculosis]]. More buildings were added in 1925. Compton was established by the [[Agricultural Research Council]] in 1937. Pirbright became a research institute in 1939 and Compton in 1942. The Houghton Poultry Research Station at [[Houghton, Cambridgeshire]] was established in 1948. In 1963 Pirbright became the Animal Virus Research Institute and Compton became the Institute for Research on Animal Diseases. The Neuropathogenesis Unit (NPU) was established in Edinburgh in 1981. This became part of the [[Roslin Institute]] in 2007.

In 1987, Compton, Houghton and Pirbright became the Institute for Animal Health, being funded by BBSRC. Houghton closed in 1992, operations at Compton are being rapidly wound down with the site due to close in 2015.

The [[Edward Jenner Institute for Vaccine Research]] was sited at Compton until October 2005.

Significant investment (over Â£170 million) is taking place at Pirbright with the development of new world class laboratory and animal facilities. The Institute has been known as "The Pirbright Institute" since October 2012.

==Directors of note==

*Dr [[John Burns Brooksby]] 1964 until 1980&lt;ref&gt;http://rsbm.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/roybiogmem/53/77.full.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The work previously carried out at Compton has either moved out to the university sector, ended or has been transferred to the Pirbright Site. The Compton site currently carries out work on [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] (commonplace) animal diseases including some Avian Viruses and a small amount of Bovine Immunology whilst Pirbright works on exotic (unusual) [[animal diseases]] (usually caused by virus outbreaks). Pirbright has National and International Reference Laboratories of diseases.

===Funding===
25% of its income comes from a core grant from the BBSRC of around Â£11m.  Around 50% comes from research grants from related government organisations, such as DEFRA, or industry and charities (such as the [[Wellcome Trust]]). The remaining 25% comes from direct payments for work carried out.

==Function==
The Pirbright Institute carries out research, diagnostics and surveillance [[Animal virology|viruses]] carried by animals, such as foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), African swine fever, bluetongue, lumpy skin disease and avian and swine flu  [[Livestock|farm animal]]s.  Understanding of viruses comes from [[molecular biology]].

It carries out surveillance activities on farm animal health and disease movement in the UK.

== Location ==
The Institute had two sites at:
* [[Compton, Berkshire|Compton]] in [[Berkshire]] - This was closed in early 2016 and services relocated to Pirbright where new facilities had been constructed.
* [[Pirbright]] in [[Surrey]] â shared with commercial company [[Merial]]

'''Plant anatomy''' or '''phytotomy''' is the general term for the study of the internal [[Anatomy|structure]] of [[plant]]s.

== History ==
{{Main article|History of botany}}
About 300 BC [[Theophrastus]] wrote a number of plant treatises, only two of which survive, ''[[Historia Plantarum (Theophrastus)|Enquiry into Plants]]'' (Î ÎµÏá½¶ ÏÏÏá¿¶Î½ á¼±ÏÏÎ¿ÏÎ¯Î±), and ''On the Causes of Plants'' (Î ÎµÏá½¶ ÏÏÏá¿¶Î½ Î±á¼°ÏÎ¹á¿¶Î½). He developed concepts of plant morphology and classification, which did not withstand the scientific scrutiny of the [[Renaissance]].

A Swiss physician and botanist, [[Gaspard Bauhin]], introduced [[binomial nomenclature]] into plant [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]]. He published ''Pinax theatri botanici'' in 1596, which was the first to use this convention for naming of species. His criteria for classification included natural relationships, or 'affinities', which in many cases were structural.

It was in the late 1600s that plant anatomy became refined into a modern science. Italian doctor and microscopist, [[Marcello Malpighi]], was one of the two founders of plant anatomy. In 1671 he published his ''Anatomia Plantarum'', the first major advance in plant physiogamy since [[Aristotle]]. The other founder was the British doctor [[Nehemiah Grew]]. He published ''An Idea of a Philosophical History of Plants'' in 1672 and ''The Anatomy of Plants'' in 1682. Grew is credited with the recognition of plant cells, although he called them 'vesicles' and 'bladders'. He correctly identified and described the sexual organs of plants (flowers) and their parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Bolam, J. |year=1973|title= The botanical works of Nehemiah Grew, FRS (1641-1712)|journal= Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London|volume=27|issue=2|pages=219â231|jstor=530999|doi=10.1098/rsnr.1973.0017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the eighteenth century, [[Carl Linnaeus]] established taxonomy based on structure, and his early work was with plant anatomy. While the exact structural level which is to be considered to be scientifically valid for comparison and differentiation has changed with the growth of knowledge, the basic principles were established by Linnaeus. He published his master work, ''Species Plantarum'' in 1753.

In 1802, French botanist [[Charles-FranÃ§ois Brisseau de Mirbel]], published ''TraitÃ© d'anatomie et de physiologie vÃ©gÃ©tale'' (''Treatise on Plant Anatomy and Physiology'') establishing the beginnings of the science of plant [[Cell biology|cytology]].

In 1812, [[Johann Jacob Paul Moldenhawer]] published ''BeytrÃ¤ge zur Anatomie der Pflanzen'', describing microscopic studies of plant tissues.

In 1813 a Swiss botanist, [[A. P. de Candolle|Augustin Pyrame de Candolle]], published ''ThÃ©orie Ã©lÃ©mentaire de la botanique'', in which he argued that plant anatomy, not physiology, ought to be the sole basis for plant classification. Using a scientific basis, he established structural criteria for defining and separating plant genera.

In 1830, [[Franz Meyen]] published ''Phytotomie'', the first comprehensive review of plant anatomy.

In 1838 German botanist [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden]], published ''Contributions to Phytogenesis'', stating, "the lower plants all consist of one cell, while the higher plants are composed of (many) individual cells" thus confirming and continuing Mirbel's work.

A German-Polish botanist, [[Eduard Strasburger]], described the mitotic process in plant cells and further demonstrated that new cell nuclei can only arise from the division of other pre-existing nuclei. His ''Studien Ã¼ber Protoplasma'' was published in 1876.

[[Gottlieb Haberlandt]], a German botanist, studied plant physiology and classified plant tissue based upon function. On this basis, in 1884 he published ''Physiologische Pflanzenanatomie'' (''Physiological Plant Anatomy'') in which he described twelve types of tissue systems (absorptive, mechanical, photosynthetic, etc.).

British paleobotanists [[Dunkinfield Henry Scott]] and [[William Crawford Williamson]] described the structures of fossilized plants at the end of the nineteenth century. Scott's ''Studies in Fossil Botany'' was published in 1900.

Following [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''Origin of Species'' a Canadian botanist, [[E. C. Jeffrey|Edward Charles Jeffrey]], who was studying the comparative anatomy and phylogeny of different [[vascular plant]] groups, applied the theory to plants using the form and structure of plants to establish a number of evolutionary lines. He published his ''The Anatomy of Woody Plants'' in 1917.

The growth of comparative plant anatomy was spearheaded by British botanist [[Agnes Arber]]. She published ''Water Plants: A Study of Aquatic Angiosperms'' in 1920, ''Monocotyledons: A Morphological Study'' in 1925, and ''The Gramineae: A Study of Cereal, Bamboo and Grass'' in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Thomas, Hanshaw H.|year=1960|title=Agnes Arber, 1879â1960|journal=Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society|volume=6| pages=1&amp;ndash;11|doi=10.1098/rsbm.1960.0021|jstor=769330}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following [[World War II]], [[Katherine Esau]] published, ''Plant Anatomy'' (1953), which became the definitive textbook on plant structure in North American universities and elsewhere, it was still in print as of 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chaffey|first=N.|title=(Book Review) Esau's Plant Anatomy, Meristems, Cells, and Tissues of the Plant Body: their Structure, Function, and Development. 3rd edn.|journal=Annals of Botany|year=2006|volume=99|issue=4|pages=785â786|doi=10.1093/aob/mcm015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She followed up with her ''Anatomy of seed plants'' in 1960.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2400">In the [[social science|social sciences]] and [[philosophy]], a '''positive''' or '''descriptive statement''' concerns what "is", "was", or "will be", and contains no indication of approval or disapproval (what should be). Positive statements are thus the opposite of [[normative statement|normative statements]]. Positive statement is based on empirical evidence. For examples, "An increase in taxation will result in less consumption" and "A fall in supply of petrol will lead to an increase in its price". However, positive statement can be factually incorrect: "The moon is made of green cheese" is empirically false, but is still a positive statement, as it is a statement about what is, not what should be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Positive and normative economics|website=http://www.soas.ac.uk/cedep-demos/000_P570_IEEP_K3736-Demo/unit1/page_16.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Positive statements and normative  statements ==
Positive statements are distinct from normative statements. Positive statements are based on empirical evidence, can be tested, and involve no value judgements. Positive statements refer to '''what is''' and contain no indication of approval or disapproval. When values or opinions come into the analysis, then it is in the realm of normative economics. A '''normative''' statement expresses a judgment about whether a situation is desirable or undesirable, which can carry value judgements. These refer to '''what ought to be.'''

== Use of positive statement ==
Positive statements are widely used to describe something measurable, like the rate of  inflation in an economy. They are mainly used in explanations of theories and concepts. Using a positive statement does not mean you can't have your own opinions on issues. However, when you are writing academic essays it's important to use positive statements to support an argument, since it can be verified by evidence.

{{Bertrand Russell}}

'''Russell's teapot''' is an [[analogy]], formulated by the philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] (1872â1970), to illustrate that the [[philosophic burden of proof]] lies upon a person making [[Falsifiability|unfalsifiable]] claims, rather than shifting the burden of ''disproof'' to others.  

Russell specifically applied his analogy in the context of religion.&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Allhoff, Scott C. Lowe. ''The Philosophical Case Against Literal Truth: Russell's Teapot // Christmas - Philosophy for Everyone: Better Than a Lump of Coal''. â John Wiley and Sons, 2010. â Ð¢. 5. â P. 65-66. â 256 p. â (Philosophy for Everyone). â {{ISBN|9781444330908}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that if he were to assert, without offering proof, that a [[teapot]], too small to be seen by telescopes, orbits the Sun somewhere in space between the Earth and Mars, he could not expect anyone to believe him solely because his assertion could not be proven wrong. 

Russell's teapot is still invoked in discussions concerning the [[existence of God]], and has had influence in various fields and media.

== Description ==
In an article titled "Is There a God?" commissioned, but never published, by ''Illustrated'' magazine in 1952, Russell wrote:

{{quote|Many orthodox people speak as though it were the business of sceptics to disprove received dogmas rather than of dogmatists to prove them. This is, of course, a mistake. If I were to suggest that between the Earth and Mars there is a china teapot revolving about the sun in an elliptical orbit, nobody would be able to disprove my assertion provided I were careful to add that the teapot is too small to be revealed even by our most powerful telescopes. But if I were to go on to say that, since my assertion cannot be disproved, it is intolerable presumption on the part of human reason to doubt it, I should rightly be thought to be talking nonsense. If, however, the existence of such a teapot were affirmed in ancient books, taught as the sacred truth every Sunday, and instilled into the minds of children at school, hesitation to believe in its existence would become a mark of eccentricity and entitle the doubter to the attentions of the psychiatrist in an enlightened age or of the Inquisitor in an earlier time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Is There a God? [1952]|editor-first=John G.|editor-last=Slater|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|authorlink=Bertrand Russell|title=The Collected Papers of Bertrand Russell, Vol. 11: Last Philosophical Testament, 1943â68|year=1952|url=http://russell.mcmaster.ca/cpbr11p69.pdf|publisher=[[Routledge]]|pages=542â548|isbn=9780415094092}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

In 1958, Russell elaborated on the analogy:

{{quote|I ought to call myself an agnostic; but, for all practical purposes, I am an atheist. I do not think the existence of the Christian God any more probable than the existence of the [[Ancient Greek religion|Gods of Olympus]] or [[Norse religion|Valhalla]]. To take another illustration: nobody can prove that there is not between the Earth and Mars a china teapot revolving in an elliptical orbit, but nobody thinks this sufficiently likely to be taken into account in practice. I think the Christian God just as unlikely.&lt;ref name="garvey"&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Brian |last=Garvey |title=Absence of Evidence, Evidence of Absence, and the Atheist's Teapot |journal=[[Ars Disputandi]] |year=2010 |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=9â22 |doi=10.1080/15665399.2010.10820011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

== Analysis ==
Chemist [[Peter Atkins]] said that the point of Russell's teapot is that there is no burden on anyone to disprove assertions. [[Occam's razor]] suggests that the simpler theory with fewer assertions (e.g., a universe with no supernatural beings) should be the starting point in the discussion rather than the more complex theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=The Oxford Handbook of Religion and Science|editor=Clayton, Philip|editor2=Simpson, Zachary R.|first=Peter|last=Atkins|authorlink=Peter Atkins|contribution=Atheism and science|pages=129â130 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-WhGyYy0SIoC|accessdate=2016-03-03|isbn=9780199279272|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, philosopher [[Paul Chamberlain]] says it is logically erroneous to assert that positive truth claims bear a burden of proof while negative truth claims do not.&lt;ref name="chamberlain"&gt;{{cite book |first=Paul |last=Chamberlain|title=Why People Don't Believe: Confronting Six Challenges to Christian Faith|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2AdNgqzawLAC&amp;pg=PA82 |year=2011|publisher=Baker Books|isbn=978-1-4412-3209-0|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; He says that all truth claims bear a burden of proof, and that like [[Mother Goose]] and the [[tooth fairy]], the teapot bears the greater burden not because of its negativity, but because of its triviality, arguing that "When we substitute normal, serious characters such as Plato, Nero, Winston Churchill, or George Washington in place of these fictional characters, it becomes clear that anyone denying the existence of these figures has a burden of proof equal to, or in some cases greater than, the person claiming they do exist."&lt;ref name="chamberlain"/&gt;

In his books ''[[A Devil's Chaplain]]'' (2003) and ''[[The God Delusion]]'' (2006), geneticist [[Richard Dawkins]] used the teapot as an analogy of an argument against what he termed "agnostic conciliation", a policy of intellectual appeasement that allows for philosophical domains that concern exclusively religious matters.&lt;ref name="devchap"&gt;{{cite book | title = A Devil's Chaplain: Reflections on Hope, Lies, Science, and Love | authorlink = Richard Dawkins | first = Richard | last = Dawkins | publisher = [[Houghton Mifflin]] | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-0-618-33540-4 | title-link = A Devil's Chaplain | chapter = The Great Convergence | pages = 146-151 | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nBRYZtOuqZcC&amp;pg=PA146 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Science has no way of establishing the existence or non-existence of a god. Therefore, according to the agnostic conciliator, because it is a matter of individual taste, belief and disbelief in a supreme being are deserving of equal respect and attention. Dawkins presents the teapot as a ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' of this position: if agnosticism demands giving equal respect to the belief and disbelief in a supreme being, then it must also give equal respect to belief in an orbiting teapot, since the existence of an orbiting teapot is just as plausible scientifically as the existence of a supreme being.&lt;ref name = "goddel"&gt;{{cite book | title = The God Delusion | first = Richard | last = Dawkins | authorlink = Richard Dawkins | publisher = [[Random House]] | year = 2016 | edition = 10th Anniversary | isbn = 9781784161934 | title-link = The God Delusion | chapter = The Poverty of Agnosticism | pages = 69-77 | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=emE7DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher Brian Garvey argues that the teapot analogy fails with regard to religion because, with the teapot, the believer and non-believer are simply disagreeing about one item in the universe and may hold in common all other beliefs about the universe, which is not true of an atheist and a theist.&lt;ref name="garvey"/&gt; Garvey argues that it is not a matter of the theist propounding existence of a thing and the atheist simply denying it â each is asserting an alternative explanation of why the cosmos exists and is the way it is: "the atheist is not just denying an existence that the theist affirms â the atheist is in addition committed to the view that the universe is not the way it is because of God. It is either the way it is because of something other than God, or there is no reason it is the way it is."&lt;ref name="garvey"/&gt;

Philosopher [[Peter van Inwagen]] argues that while Russell's teapot is a fine piece of rhetoric, its logical argument form is less than clear, and attempting to make it clear reveals that the Teapot Argument is very far from cogent.&lt;ref name = "Epistemology"&gt;{{cite book | title = The Right to Believe: Perspectives in Religious Epistemology | editor1-first = Dariusz | editor1-last = Åukasiewicz | editor2-first = Roger | editor2-last = Pouivet | first = Peter | last = van Inwagen | authorlink = Peter van Inwagen | chapter = Russell's China Teapot | pages = 11-26 | publisher = [[Ontos Verlag]] | location = Frankfurt | year = 2012 | isbn = 9783110320169 | url = https://books.google.com.au/books?id=bmyK32rqKf0C&amp;pg=PA11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another philosopher, [[Alvin Plantinga]] states that a falsehood lies at the heart of Russell's argument. Russell's argument assumes that there is no evidence against the teapot, but Plantinga disagrees:

{{quote|Clearly we have a great deal of evidence against teapotism. For example, as far as we know, the only way a teapot could have gotten into orbit around the sun would be if some country with sufficiently developed space-shot capabilities had shot this pot into orbit. No country with such capabilities is sufficiently frivolous to waste its resources by trying to send a teapot into orbit. Furthermore, if some country had done so, it would have been all over the news; we would certainly have heard about it. But we haven't. And so on. There is plenty of evidence against teapotism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last = Gutting|first = Gary|authorlink = Gary Gutting|date = February 9, 2014|newspaper = [[The New York Times]]|url = http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/is-atheism-irrational/|title = Is Atheism Irrational?|accessdate = July 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Philosopher [[Gary Gutting]] rejects Russell's teapot for similar reasons, arguing that Russell's argument accords theism far less support than it actually has. Gutting points out that numerous sensible, competent people appeal to personal experience and arguments in support of God's existence. Thus, to simply reject the existence of God, out of hand, seems unjustified, according to Gutting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/11/on-dawkinss-atheism-a-response|date = August 11, 2010|accessdate = November 27, 2018|newspaper = [[The New York Times]]|title = On Dawkins's Atheism: A Response|first = Gary|last = Gutting|authorlink = Gary Gutting}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The literary critic [[James Wood (critic)|James Wood]], without believing in God, says that belief in God "is a good deal more reasonable than belief in a teapot" because God is a "grand and big idea" which "is not analogically disproved by reference to celestial teapots or vacuum cleaners, which lack the necessary bigness and grandeur" and "because God cannot be [[Reification (fallacy)|reified]], cannot be turned into a mere thing".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=James|last=Wood|authorlink=James Wood (critic)|title=The Celestial Teapot|journal=[[The New Republic]]|date=18 December 2006|issue=27|url=http://www.tnr.com/article/the-celestial-teapot|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One counter-argument, advanced by philosopher Eric Reitan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first = Eric |last=Reitan |title=Contributors |publisher=Religion Dispatches |url=http://www.religiondispatches.org/contributors/ericreitan/}}&lt;/ref&gt; is that belief in God is different from belief in a teapot because teapots are physical and therefore in principle verifiable, and that given what we know about the physical world we have no good reason to think that belief in Russell's teapot is justified and at least some reason to think it not.&lt;ref name=Reitan&gt;{{cite book | title = Is God a Delusion? |first = Eric |last=Reitan|publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | date = 2008 | media_type = | pages = 78â80 | isbn = 978-1-4051-8361-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Similar analogies ==
Other thinkers have posited non-disprovable analogies, such as [[J. B. Bury]] in his 1913 book, ''History of Freedom of Thought'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Some people speak as if we were not justified in rejecting a theological doctrine unless we can prove it false. But the burden of proof does not lie upon the rejecter.... If you were told that in a certain planet revolving around Sirius there is a race of donkeys who speak the English language and spend their time in discussing eugenics, you could not disprove the statement, but would it, on that account, have any claim to be believed? Some minds would be prepared to accept it, if it were reiterated often enough, through the potent force of suggestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= History of Freedom of Thought|edition= Illustrated Edition, published 2014 by [[Lulu Press, Inc.]]|isbn= 9781304988607 |last= Bury|first= John Bagnall|authorlink= J. B. Bury|page= 20|year= 1913|publisher= [[Williams &amp; Norgate]] |location= London|chapter=Freedom of Thought and the Forces Against it|url=https://books.google.com/?id=n2FUCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT11&amp;lpg=PT11&amp;dq=Some+people+speak+as+if+we+were+not+justified+in+rejecting+a+theological+doctrine+unless+we+can+prove+it+false.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Astronomer]] [[Carl Sagan]] in his 1995 book ''[[The Demon-Haunted World]]'' offered a similar non-disprovable analogy called the Dragon in the Garage as an example of skeptical thinking. If Sagan claimed there was a dragon in his garage, you would wish to verify it for yourself but if Sagan's dragon was impossible to detect:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Now, what's the difference between an invisible, incorporeal, floating dragon who spits heatless fire and no dragon at all? If there's no way to disprove my contention, no conceivable experiment that would count against it, what does it mean to say that my dragon exists?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sagan|first1=Carl|authorlink=Carl Sagan|title=The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark|date=1995|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=9780394535128|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ybvaAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=editions:r7NWYii6Wt0C|accessdate=23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Influence in religious parodies ==
The concept of Russell's teapot has influenced more explicitly [[Parody religion|religion-parodying]] concepts such as the [[Invisible Pink Unicorn]]&lt;ref name = "goddel"/&gt; and the [[Flying Spaghetti Monster]].&lt;ref name="Wolf2006"&gt;{{cite news | title=The Church of the Non-Believers | first=Gary | last=Wolf | date=14 November 2006 | publisher=[[Wired News]] | url=https://www.wired.com/2006/11/atheism/}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1960s musician and psychedelic poet [[Daevid Allen]] of the band [[Gong (band)|Gong]] employed the image of a flying teapot in his [[Gong (band)#Mythology|Planet Gong Universe]] and the ''[[Flying Teapot (album)|Flying Teapot]]'' album trilogy, and refers to Russell's teapot in his book ''Gong Dreaming 2: The Histories &amp; Mysteries of Gong from 1969-1975''.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22811">The '''science wars''' is a series of [[intellectual]] exchanges, between [[Scientific realism|scientific realists]] and [[Postmodernism|postmodernist]] critics, about the nature of scientific theory and intellectual inquiry. They took place principally in the [[United States]] in the 1990s in the academic and mainstream press. Scientific realists (such as [[Norman Levitt]], [[Paul R. Gross]], [[Jean Bricmont]] and [[Alan Sokal]]) argued that scientific knowledge is real, and accused the postmodernists of having effectively rejected scientific [[Objectivity (science)|objectivity]],  the [[scientific method]], [[Empiricism]], and scientific knowledge.  Postmodernists interpreted [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s ideas about [[scientific paradigm]]s to mean that scientific theories are [[social constructs]], and philosophers like [[Paul Feyerabend]] argued that other, non-realist forms of knowledge production were better suited to serve people's personal and spiritual needs.

Though much of the theory associated with 'postmodernism' (see [[poststructuralism]]) did not make any interventions into the [[natural sciences]], the scientific realists took aim at its general influence. The scientific realists argued that large swaths of scholarship, amounting to a rejection of objectivity and realism, had been influenced by major 20th Century [[poststructuralist]] philosophers (such as [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Jean-FranÃ§ois Lyotard]] and others), whose work they declare to be incomprehensible or meaningless. They implicate a broad range of fields in this trend, including  [[cultural studies]], [[cultural anthropology]], [[feminist studies]], [[comparative literature]], [[media studies]], and [[science and technology studies]]. They accuse those postmodernist critics who did actually discuss science of having a limited understanding of it.

==Historical background==
Until the mid-20th century, the [[philosophy of science]] had concentrated on the viability of scientific method and knowledge, proposing justifications for the truth of scientific theories and observations and attempting to discover at a philosophical level why science worked. 
[[Karl Popper]], an early opponent of [[logical positivism]] in the 20th century, repudiated the classical observationalist/[[Inductivism|inductivist]] form of [[scientific method]] in favour of [[Falsifiability|empirical falsification]]. He is also known for his opposition to the classical [[justificationism|justificationist]] account of knowledge which he replaced with [[critical rationalism]], "the first ''non justificational philosophy of criticism'' in the history of philosophy".&lt;ref&gt;[[William W. Bartley|Bartley, William W.]] (1964). [http://www.the-rathouse.com/2008/Bartley1964CCR.html "Rationality versus the Theory of Rationality".] In Mario Bunge: ''The Critical Approach to Science and Philosophy''. The Free Press of Glencoe, section IX.&lt;/ref&gt;
His criticisms of scientific method were adopted by several postmodernist critiques.&lt;ref&gt;
[[David Stove|Stove, David Charles]] (1982). ''[[Popper and After]]: [http://ontology.buffalo.edu/stove/500-600.htm Four Modern Irrationalists]'', Oxford: [[Pergamon Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of 20th-century philosophers maintained that logical models of pure science do not apply to actual scientific practice. It was the publication of [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' in 1962, however, which fully opened the study of science to new disciplines by suggesting that the evolution of science was in part sociologically determined and that it did not operate under the simple logical laws put forward by the logical positivist school of philosophy.

Kuhn described the development of scientific knowledge not as a linear increase in truth and understanding, but as a series of periodic revolutions which overturned the old scientific order and replaced it with new orders (what he called "[[paradigm]]s"). Kuhn attributed much of this process to the interactions and strategies of the human participants in science rather than its own innate logical structure. (See [[sociology of scientific knowledge]]).

Some interpreted Kuhn's ideas to mean that scientific theories were, either wholly or in part, ''[[social construction|social constructs]]'', which many interpreted as diminishing the claim of science to representing objective reality (though many social constructivists do not put forward this claim), and that reality had a lesser or potentially irrelevant role in the formation of scientific theories. In 1971,  [[Jerome Ravetz]] published ''[[Scientific knowledge and its social problems|Scientific Knowledge and its Social Problems]]'', a book describing the role that the scientific community, as a social construct, plays in accepting or rejecting objective scientific knowledge.&lt;ref name="isbn0195197216 "&gt;{{cite book |author=Ravetz, Jerome R. |title=Scientific knowledge and its social problems |publisher=Oxford Univ. Press |location=Oxford |year=1979 |pages= |isbn=978-0-19-519721-1 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Postmodernism ===
{{refimprove section|date=July 2012}}
{{Further information|New Left|Critical theory}}
A number of different philosophical and historical schools, often grouped together as "[[postmodernism]]", began reinterpreting scientific achievements of the past through the lens of the practitioners, often positing the influence of politics and economics in the development of scientific theories in addition to scientific observations. Rather than being presented as working entirely from positivistic observations, many scientists of the past were scrutinized for their connection to issues of gender, sexual orientation, race, and class. Some more radical philosophers, such as [[Paul Feyerabend]], argued that scientific theories were themselves incoherent and that other forms of knowledge production (such as those used in [[religion]]) served the material and spiritual needs of their practitioners with equal validity as did scientific explanations.

[[Imre Lakatos]] advanced a midway view between the "postmodernist" and "realist" camps. For Lakatos, scientific knowledge is progressive; however, it progresses not by a strict linear path where every new element builds upon and incorporates every other, but by an approach where a "core" of a "research program" is established by auxiliary theories which can themselves be falsified or replaced without compromising the core. Social conditions and attitudes affect how strongly one attempts to resist falsification for the core of a program, but the program has an objective status based on its relative explanatory power. Resisting falsification only becomes ''ad-hoc'' and damaging to knowledge when an alternate program with greater explanatory power is rejected in favor of another with less. But because it is changing a theoretical core, which has broad ramifications for other areas of study, accepting a new program is also revolutionary as well as progressive. Thus, for Lakatos the character of science is that of being both revolutionary and progressive; both socially informed and objectively justified.

==The science wars==
In ''[[Higher Superstition: The Academic Left and Its Quarrels With Science]]'' (1994), the scientists [[Paul R. Gross]] and [[Norman Levitt]] accused postmodernists of [[anti-intellectualism]], presented the shortcomings of [[relativism]], and suggested that postmodernists knew little about the scientific theories they criticized and practiced poor [[scholarly method|scholarship]] for political reasons. 
The authors insist that the "science critics" misunderstood the theoretical approaches they criticized, given their "caricature, misreading, and condescension, [rather] than argument".&lt;ref&gt;Flower, Michael J.  (1995). "Review of ''Higher Superstition'' ", ''Contemporary Sociology'', Vol. 24, No. 1, pp. 113â14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Isis (journal)|Isis]]'' (Vol. 87, No. 2, 1996), ''[[American Anthropologist]]'' (Vol. 98, No. 2, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Social Studies of Science]]'' (Vol. 26, No. 1, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The review in ''[[The Journal of Higher Education]]'' (Vol. 66, No. 5, 1995) snidely suggested that book's final sentence proved that politics, the epistemology, philosophy, and science are inter-related.&lt;/ref&gt; The book sparked the so-called science wars. ''Higher Superstition'' inspired a [[New York Academy of Sciences]] conference titled ''The Flight from Science and Reason'', organized by Gross, Levitt, and [[Gerald Holton]].&lt;ref&gt;Gross, Levitt, and Martin W. Lewis. (1997). ''The Flight from Science and Reason'' (New York: New York Academy of Science.)&lt;/ref&gt; Attendees of the conference were critical of the [[Polemics|polemical]] approach of Gross and Levitt, yet agreed upon the intellectual inconsistency of how laymen, non-scientist, and social studies intellectuals dealt with science.&lt;ref&gt;[http://picpal.com/sciart.html Kramer, Jennifer. "Who's Flying â And In What Direction?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060510055127/http://picpal.com/sciart.html |date=2006-05-10 }} Coverage of the NYAS Flight from Science and Reason conference.  Accessed 15 may 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science wars in ''Social Text''===
In 1996, ''[[Social Text]]'', a [[Duke University]] publication of [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] [[critical theory]], compiled a "Science Wars" issue containing brief articles by postmodernist academics in the [[social sciences]] and the [[humanities]], that emphasized the roles of society and politics in science. In the introduction to the issue, the ''Social Text'' editor, [[Andrew Ross (academic)|Andrew Ross]], said that the attack upon [[science studies]] was a [[Conservatism|conservative]] [[Reactionary|reaction]] to reduced funding for scientific research, characterizing the ''Flight from Science and Reason'' conference as an attempted "linking together a host of dangerous threats: [[scientific creationism]], [[New Age]] alternatives and cults, [[astrology]], [[Ufology|UFO-ism]], the radical science movement, postmodernism, and critical science studies, alongside the ready-made historical specters of [[Deutsche Physik|Aryan-Nazi science]] and the Soviet error of [[Lysenkoism]]" that "degenerated into name-calling".&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Andrew.  (1996). "Introduction" ''[[Social Text]] 46/47'', Vol. 14, Nos. 1 &amp; 2, pp. 1â13, esp. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian [[Dorothy Nelkin]] characterised Gross and Levitt's vigorous response as a "call to arms in response to the failed marriage of Science and the State"&amp;mdash;in contrast to the scientists' historical tendency to avoid participating in perceived political threats, such as [[creation science]], the [[animal rights movement]], and anti-abortionists' attempts to curb fetal research.{{clarify|date=April 2013}} At the end of the SovietâAmerican [[Cold War]] (1945â91), [[military funding of science]] declined, while funding agencies demanded accountability, and research became directed by private interests. Nelkin suggested that postmodernist critics were "convenient scapegoats" who diverted attention from problems in science.&lt;ref&gt;Nelkin, Dorothy.  (1996). "The Science Wars: Responses to a Marriage Failed" ''Social Text'' 46/47, Vol. 14, Nos. 1 &amp; 2, pp. 93â100., p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1996, physicist [[Alan Sokal]] had submitted an article to ''Social Text'' titled "[[Sokal affair|Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity]]", which proposed that [[quantum gravity]] is a [[Linguistics|linguistic]] and [[social construct]] and that [[quantum physics]] supports postmodernist criticisms of scientific [[Objectivity (science)|objectivity]]. After holding the article back from earlier issues due to Sokal's refusal to consider revisions, the staff published it in the "Science Wars" issue as a relevant contribution.&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Bruce and Ross, Andrew. [http://physics.nyu.edu/sokal/SocialText_reply_LF.pdf Editorial Response to the hoax, explaining Social Text's decision to publish]&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in the May 1996 issue of ''[[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]'', in the article "A Physicist Experiments With Cultural Studies", Sokal exposed his [[parody]]-article, "Transgressing the Boundaries" as an experiment testing the [[intellectual rigor]] of an [[academic journal]] that would "publish an article liberally salted with nonsense if (a) it sounded good and (b) it flattered the editors' ideological preconceptions".&lt;ref&gt;Sokal, Alan. (1996).  "[http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/transgress_v2/transgress_v2_singlefile.html Transgressing the Boundaries: Toward a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity]" ''[[Social Text]] 46/47'', Vol. 14, Nos. 1 &amp; 2, pp 217â252.&lt;/ref&gt; The matter became known as the "[[Sokal Affair]]" and brought greater public attention to the wider conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Sokal, Alan. (1996).  "[http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/lingua_franca_v4/lingua_franca_v4.html A Physicist Experiments with Cultural Studies]," ''Lingua Franca'', May/June, pp 62â64.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Derrida]], a frequent target of "anti-relativist" criticism in the wake of Sokal's article, responded to the hoax in "Sokal and Bricmont Aren't Serious", first published in ''[[Le Monde]]''. He called Sokal's action sad (''triste'') for having overshadowed Sokal's mathematical work and ruined the chance to sort out controversies of scientific objectivity in a careful way. Derrida went on to fault him and co-author Jean Bricmont for what he considered an act of intellectual bad faith: they had accused him of scientific incompetence in the English edition of a follow-up book (an accusation several English reviewers noted), but deleted the accusation from the French edition and denied that it had ever existed. He concluded, as the title indicates, that Sokal was not serious in his approach, but had used the spectacle of a "quick practical joke" to displace the scholarship Derrida believed the public deserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Derrida |first=Jacques |authorlink=Jacques Derrida |title=Paper Machine |origyear=1994 |year=2005 |publisher=Stanford University Press |location=Stanford |page=70 |nopp=true |isbn=978-0-8047-4619-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continued conflict===
In the first few years after the 'Science Wars' edition of ''Social Text'', the seriousness and volume of discussion increased significantly, much of it focused on reconciling the 'warring' camps of postmodernists and scientists.  One significant event was the 'Science and Its Critics' conference in early 1997; it brought together scientists and scholars who study science, and featured Alan Sokal and [[Steve Fuller (sociologist)|Steve Fuller]] as keynote speakers.  The conference generated the final wave of substantial press coverage (in both news media and scientific journals), though by no means resolved the fundamental issues of [[social construction]] and [[Objectivity (science)|objectivity]] in science.&lt;ref&gt;Baringer, Philip S. (2001). "Introduction: 'the science wars'", from ''After the Science Wars'', eds. Keith M. Ashman and Philip S. Baringer. New York: Routlege, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other attempts have been made to reconcile the two camps. Mike Nauenberg, a physicist at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], organized a small conference in May 1997 that was attended by scientists and sociologists of science alike, among them [[Alan Sokal]], [[N. David Mermin]] and [[Harry Collins]]. In the same year, Collins organized the Southampton Peace Workshop, which again brought together a broad range of scientists and sociologists. The Peace Workshop gave rise to the idea of a book that intended to map out some of the arguments between the disputing parties. ''The One Culture?:  A Conversation about Science'', edited by chemist Jay A. Labinger and sociologist Harry Collins, was eventually published in 2001. The book, the title of which is a reference to [[C.P. Snow]]'s ''[[The Two Cultures]]'', contains contributions from authors such as Alan Sokal, Jean Bricmont, [[Steven Weinberg]] and [[Steven Shapin]].&lt;ref&gt;Labinger, Jay A. and [[Harry Collins]]. (2001). "Preface", in: ''The One Culture?:  A Conversation about Science'', eds. Labinger, Jay A and [[Harry Collins]]. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, pp. ixâxi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other important publications related to the science wars include ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]'' by Sokal and [[Jean Bricmont]] (1998), ''The Social Construction of What?'' by [[Ian Hacking]] (1999) and ''Who Rules in Science'' by [[James Robert Brown]].

To [[John C. Baez]], the [[Bogdanov Affair]] in 2002&lt;ref name=Chronicle&gt;{{cite web | last = Monastersky | first = Richard | title = French TV Stars Rock the World of Theoretical Physics | work = [[Chronicle of Higher Education]] | date = November 2, 2002 | url = http://chronicle.com/free/2002/11/2002110501n.htm | accessdate = 2008-03-20 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080207103228/http://chronicle.com/free/2002/11/2002110501n.htm |archivedate = 2008-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; served as the bookend to the Sokal controversy: the review, acceptance, and publication of papers, later alleged to be nonsense, in peer-reviewed physics journals. [[Cornell University|Cornell]] physics professor [[Paul Ginsparg]], argued that the cases are not at all similar, and that the fact that some journals and scientific institutions have low standards is "hardly a revelation".&lt;ref name="ginsparg"&gt;[[Ginsparg, Paul]]. (2002, November 12). "'Is It Art?'  Is Not a Question for Physics".  ''[[New York Times]]'', section A, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; The new editor in chief of the journal ''[[Annals of Physics]]'', who was appointed after the controversy along with a new editorial staff, had said that the standards of the journal had been poor leading up to the publication since the previous editor had become sick and died.&lt;ref name=Chronicle /&gt;

Interest in the science wars has waned considerably in recent years.  Though the events of the science wars are still occasionally mentioned in mainstream press, they have had little effect on either the scientific community or the community of critical theorists.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Both sides continue to maintain that the other does not understand their theories, or mistakes constructive criticisms and scholarly investigations for attacks. As [[Bruno Latour]] recently put it, "Scientists always stomp around meetings talking about 'bridging the two-culture gap', but when scores of people from outside the sciences begin to build just that bridge, they recoil in horror and want to impose the strangest of all gags on free speech since [[Socrates]]: only scientists should speak about science!"&lt;ref&gt;Latour, B. (1999). ''[http://www.bruno-latour.fr/livres/vii_tdm.html  Pandora's Hope.  Essays on the Reality of Science Studies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070904092247/http://www.bruno-latour.fr/livres/vii_tdm.html |date=2007-09-04 }}'', [[Harvard University Press]], USA.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Latour has suggested a re-evaluation of sociology's epistemology based on lessons learnt from the Science Wars: "...&amp;nbsp;scientists made us realize that there was not the slightest chance that the type of social forces we use as a cause could have objective facts as their effects".&lt;ref&gt;Latour, B. (2005). ''Reassembling the Social.  An Introduction to Actor-Network-Theory'', Oxford University Press, USA, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, more recently some of the leading critical theorists have recognized that their critiques have at times been counter-productive, and are providing intellectual ammunition for reactionary interests.

Writing about these developments in the context of [[global warming]], [[Bruno Latour]] noted that "dangerous extremists are using the very same argument of social construction to destroy hard-won evidence that could save our lives.  Was I wrong to participate in the invention of this field known as science studies? Is it enough to say that we did not really mean what we said?"&lt;ref&gt;Latour, B. (2004). ''[http://www.bruno-latour.fr/sites/default/files/89-CRITICAL-INQUIRY-GB.pdf Why Has Critique Run Out of Steam? From Matters of Fact to Matters of Concern]'', ''[[Critical Inquiry]]'' 30, pp. 225â48.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kendrick Frazier]] notes that Latour is interested in helping to rebuild trust in science and that Latour has said that some of the authority of science needs to be regained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frazier |first1=Kendrick |authorlink=Kendrick Frazier|title='Science Wars' Veteran Latour Now Wants to Help Rebuild Trust in Science |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=1 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
One of Davies's first journal publications was 'The Expression of Emotion in Music', published in ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'' in 1980 (Vol. 89, pp.&amp;nbsp;67â86). In this article Davies first outlined his theory that music is expressive of emotions in virtue of resembling the way that emotions appear. This theory is similar to one outlined by [[Peter Kivy]] in his book ''The Corded Shell'', also published in 1980. However, Davies developed his view independently as an undergraduate in the 1970s, and the theory was part of his PhD thesis awarded in 1976 from the University of London.&lt;ref&gt;Davies 2003: p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to Kivy, Davies also places a greater emphasis on the resemblance between music and physical gesture, where Kivy tends to emphasize the resemblance to the expressive vocalisations. Davies was inspired when seeing an advertisement for [[Hush Puppies]] shoes, with the thought that we recognize sadness in the face of [[Basset Hound|Basset hounds]], despite knowing that they do not feel sad.&lt;ref&gt;Davies 2003: p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Davies also maintains a research interest in ethnomusicology, which he studied as an undergraduate,&lt;ref&gt;Davies 2003: p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; particularly the aesthetics of [[Music of Bali|Balinese music]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., his article [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-594X.2007.00234.x/abstract;jsessionid=BB7C33A7CCC63E4294B8FD7B672294D6.d03t01 'Balinese Aesthetics']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Synthetic ecosystems''' are [[System-on-a-chip|on-chip integrated devices]] where cellular cultures (individuals) and [[ecosystem services]] - such as the renewal of growth, delivery of  regulatory signals as well as removal of waste - are patterned into an integrated [[fluidic]] device using principles of [[landscape ecology]], [[physiology]] and [[cell signaling]].

'''''Theatrum Artis Scribendi''''' is a book about [[calligraphy]] by [[Jodocus Hondius]]. The first edition was published in [[Amsterdam]] in 1594; a second edition was published in 1614 by his son, Johannes Janssonius. A facsimile, limited to 300 copies, was published in 1969 by Midland Publishers of the Netherlands. The facsimile was printed by N. Miedma and Co. of Leeuwarden and bound by Van Rijmenam N.V. in The Hague.

Translated from [[Latin]], the title of the book is ''Theatre of the Art of Writing''. It is an anthology of handwriting specimens by Solomon Henrix, van den Velde, Felix Van Sambix, Curione, M.

'''Thomas Weihs''' (born 30 April 1914 [[Vienna]] (then the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]), died 19 June 1983 [[Aberdeen]], Scotland) was a doctor, farmer and special needs educator, one of the founders and leading co-workers of the [[Camphill Movement]] and a pioneer of Anthroposophical curative education.&lt;ref&gt;ââThe Builders of Camphill: Lives and Destinies of the Foundersââ Edited by Friedwart Bock, Article by Christine Polyblank, Floris Books, 2004 {{ISBN|9780863154423}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Thomas Johannes Weihs was the second child of Gertrude and Richard Weiss (spelling later changed), who had settled in Vienna from [[Brody]] in the [[Ukraine]]. During his studies in Medicine at the [[University of Vienna]], he met Dr [[Karl KÃ¶nig]] and became part of a youth group whose members formed the core of what was to become [[Camphill Movement|Camphill]] in Scotland.

Being of Jewish origin, he fled Austria together with his first wife, Helene Stoll, completed his doctor's degree in [[Basel]], after which, at the outbreak of [[World War II]] he joined Dr KÃ¶nig and the others in Scotland. Near Aberdeen, on Camphill estate, they founded the work in curative education for those they called "children in need of special care," which was to occupy him for the rest of his life. He had a number of children with Helene, one of whom, Christine Polyblank, founded the [[Ringwood Waldorf School]].

As Camphill grew, so his responsibilities increased, ranging from farming and general handyman to doctor, educator, lecturer and writer. In 1957 he was appointed Superintendent of the Camphill work by Dr KÃ¶nig. He had, by this time, also established a thriving practice as a doctor, including working at Dr. KÃ¶nig's own London practice. At the same time he travelled widely, lecturing at Camphill centres throughout the world as well as to the general public. It was in this manner that he met [[BBC]] film director [[Jonathan Stedall]], then 28 and taking a year off to study at [[Emerson College UK|Emerson College]]. Their collaboration led to the numerous films for British television that Stedall made on Camphill such as "Candle on the Hill".

Weihsâ best-known work, the book ''Children in Need of Special Care'', was published in 1971 and has since been reprinted on several occasions and translated into 14 languages.

His final work,  "Embryogenesis in Myth and Science", was completed on his deathbed and published posthumously.

Besides this, his work as sculptor led to a considerable number of pieces set up all over the various farms and public buildings of Camphill.

{{Conservation status}}
'''Threatened species''' are any species (including [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, [[fungus|fungi]], etc.) which are vulnerable to [[Species endangerment|endangerment]] in the near future.  Species that are threatened are sometimes characterised by the [[population dynamics]] measure of ''[[critical depensation]]'', a mathematical measure of [[biomass]] related to [[population growth rate]]. This quantitative metric is one method of evaluating the degree of endangerment.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liermann|first=Martin|year=2001|title=Depensation: evidence, models and implications|url=http://www.seaturtle.org/PDF/LiermannM_2001_FishFish.pdf|journal=Fish and Fisheries|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==IUCN definition==
The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) is the foremost authority on threatened species, and treats threatened species not as a single category, but as a group of three categories, depending on the degree to which they are threatened:

*[[Vulnerable species]]
*[[Endangered species]]
*[[Critically endangered species]]

Less-than-threatened categories are [[near threatened]], [[least concern]], and the no longer assigned category of [[conservation dependent]]. Species which have not been evaluated (NE), or do not have sufficient data ([[data deficient]]) also are not considered "threatened" by the IUCN.

[[File:Status iucn3.1 threatened.svg|thumb|left|The three categories of the threatened species [[IUCN Red List]].]]

Although ''threatened'' and ''vulnerable'' may be used interchangeably when discussing IUCN categories, the term ''threatened'' is generally used to refer to the three categories (critically endangered, endangered and vulnerable), while ''vulnerable'' is used to refer to the least at risk of those three categories. They may be used interchangeably in most contexts however, as all vulnerable species are threatened species (''vulnerable'' is a category of ''threatened species''); and, as the more at-risk categories of threatened species (namely ''endangered'' and ''critically endangered'') must, by definition, also qualify as vulnerable species, all threatened species may also be considered vulnerable.

Threatened species are also referred to as a [[red-listed]] species, as they are listed in the [[IUCN Red List|IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]].

[[Subspecies]], populations and stocks may also be classified as threatened.

==United States definition==
[[File:Status ESA LT.svg|left|thumb|"Threatened" in relation to "endangered" under the [[Endangered Species Act|ESA]].]]

Under the [[Endangered Species Act]] in the United States, "threatened" is defined as "any species which is likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/endangered/laws-policies/section-3.html|title=Endangered Species Program - Laws &amp; Policies - Endangered Species Act - Section 3 Definitions|first=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service/Endangered Species|last=Program|date=|website=www.fws.gov|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170429155642/https://www.fws.gov/endangered/laws-policies/section-3.html|archivedate=29 April 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the less protected of the two protected categories. The [[Bay checkerspot butterfly]] (''Euphydryas editha bayensis'') is an example of a threatened subspecies protected under the ESA.

Within the U.S., state wildlife agencies have the authority under the ESA to manage species which are considered endangered or threatened within their state but not within all states, and which therefore are not included on the national list of endangered and threatened species.  For example, the [[trumpeter swan]] (''Cygnus buccinator'') is threatened in the state of [[Minnesota]], while large populations still remain in [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://files.dnr.state.mn.us/natural_resources/ets/endlist.pdf|title=Minnesota Endangered &amp; Threatened Species List|author=|date=|website=state.mn.us|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519114000/http://files.dnr.state.mn.us/natural_resources/ets/endlist.pdf|archivedate=19 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{clear}}

==Australian definition==
The Commonwealth of Australia has legislation for categorising and protecting endangered species, namely the [[Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999]], which is known in short as the EPBC Act.  This act has six categories;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened/species.html#categories Threatened species under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221072705/http://environment.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened/species.html |date=2009-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; extinct, extinct in the wild, critically endangered, endangered, vulnerable, and conservation dependent, defined in Section 179 of the act, and could be summarised as;
*"Extinct" - "no reasonable doubt that the last member of the species has died",
*"Extinct in the wild" - "known only to survive in cultivation" and "despite exhaustive surveys" has not been seen in the wild,
*"Critically endangered" - "extremely high risk of extinction in the wild in the immediate future",
*"Endangered" - "very high risk of extinction in the wild in the near future",
*"Vulnerable" - "high risk of extinction in the wild in medium-term future", and
*"Conservation dependent" - "focus of a specific conservation program" without which the species would enter one of the above categories.

The EPBC Act also recognises and protects threatened ecosystems such as plant communities, and [[Ramsar Convention]] wetlands used by migratory birds.

Individual states and territories of Australia are bound under the EPBC Act, but may also have legislation which gives further protection to certain species, for example Western Australia's [[Wildlife Conservation Act 1950]].  Some species, such as [[Lewin's rail]] (''Lewinia pectoralis''), are not listed as threatened species under the EPBC Act, but they may be recognised as threatened by individual states or territories.
===NSW Definition===
====Threatening Processes====
Pests and weeds, climate change and habitat loss are some of the key threatening processes facing native plants and animals [http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/topics/animals-and-plants/threatened-species/about-threatened-species/key-threatening-processes listed by the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage.]

The '''Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution''' ('''WHOI''', acronym pronounced {{IPAc-en|Ë|h|uË|i}} {{respell|HOO|ee}}) is a private, [[nonprofit]] research and higher education facility dedicated to the study of [[marine science]] and [[engineering]]. Its agenda includes: geological activity deep within the earth; plant, animal, and microbial populations and their interactions in the ocean; coastal erosion; ocean circulation; ocean pollution; and global climate change.

Established in 1930 in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, it is the largest independent oceanographic research institution in the U.S., with staff and students numbering about 1,000.

==Constitution==
The Institution is organized into six departments,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.whoi.edu/main/departments-centers-labs|title=Departments, Centers, and Labs|work=whoi.edu|publisher=Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution|accessdate=15 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Cooperative Institute for Climate and Ocean Research, and a marine policy center. Its shore-based facilities are located in the village of [[Woods Hole, Massachusetts|Woods Hole]], [[Massachusetts]], United States and a mile and a half away on the Quissett Campus. The bulk of the Institution's funding comes from grants and contracts from the [[National Science Foundation]] and other government agencies, augmented by foundations and private donations.

WHOI scientists, engineers, and students collaborate to develop theories, test ideas, build seagoing instruments, and collect data in diverse marine environments. Ships operated by WHOI carry research scientists throughout the worldâs oceans. The WHOI fleet includes two large research vessels (''[[RV Atlantis (AGOR-25)|Atlantis]]'') and ''[[RV Neil Armstrong (AGOR-27)|Neil Armstrong]]'' , the coastal craft ''[[R/V Tioga|Tioga]]'', small research craft such as the dive-operation work boat Echo, the deep-diving human-occupied submersible ''[[DSV Alvin|Alvin]]'', the tethered, remotely operated vehicle [[Jason (ROV)|Jason/Medea]], and autonomous underwater vehicles such as the [[REMUS (AUV)|REMUS]] and [[SeaBED]]. 

WHOI offers graduate and post-graduate studies in marine science. There are several fellowship and trainee-ship programs, and graduate degrees are awarded through a joint program with the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) or by the Institution itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

|accessdate=15 December 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt; WHOI also offers other outreach programs and informal public education through its Exhibit Center and summer tours. The Institution has a volunteer program and a membership program, WHOI Associate.

On October 1, 2015, Mark Abbott became the institution's tenth president and director.&lt;ref name="president"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whoi.edu/main/president-director|title=President and Director|website=whoi.edu|publisher=Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution|accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:RVAtlantis.jpg|thumb|[[RV Atlantis|R/V ''Atlantis'']], the first [[research vessel]] operated by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.]]
In 1927, a [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] committee concluded that it was time to "consider the share of the United States of America in a worldwide program of oceanographic research." The committee's recommendation for establishing a permanent independent research laboratory on the East Coast to "prosecute oceanography in all its branches" led to the founding in 1930 of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.&lt;ref name="whoi_history"&gt;{{Cite web
|url=http://www.whoi.edu/main/history-legacy
|title=History and Legacy
|work=whoi.edu
|publisher=Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution
|accessdate=15 December 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A $2.5 million grant from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] supported the summer work of a dozen scientists, construction of a laboratory building and commissioning of a research vessel, the {{convert|142|ft|m|adj=on}} ketch ''Atlantis'', whose profile still forms the Institution's logo.&lt;ref name="whoi_history"/&gt;

WHOI grew substantially to support significant defense-related research during World War II, and later began a steady growth in staff, research fleet, and scientific stature. Over the years, WHOI scientists have made seminal discoveries about the ocean that have contributed to improving US commerce, health, national security, and quality of life.

In 1977 the institute appointed the influential oceanographer [[John Steele (oceanographer)|John Steele]] as director, and he served until his retirement in 1989.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/10599939/John-Steele-obituary.html | title=John Steele â obituary | work=The Telegraph | date=27 January 2014 | accessdate=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 September 1985, a joint French-American expedition led by [[Jean-Louis Michel (oceanographer)|Jean-Louis Michel]] of [[IFREMER]] and [[Robert Ballard]] of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution identified the location of the wreck of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] which sank off the coast of [[Newfoundland]] 15 April 1912.

On 3 April 2011, within a week of resuming of the search operation for [[Air France Flight 447]], a team led by WHOI, operating full ocean depth [[autonomous underwater vehicle]]s (AUVs) owned by the Waitt Institute discovered, by means of [[sidescan sonar]], a large portion of debris field from flight AF447.&lt;ref name=stone&gt;[http://www.informs.org/ORMS-Today/Public-Articles/August-Volume-38-Number-4/In-Search-of-Air-France-Flight-447 In search of Air France Flight 447] Lawrence D. Stone Institute of Operations Research and the Management Sciences 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017 the institution effected an [[open-access policy]] to make its research [[open access|publicly accessible]] online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://roarmap.eprints.org/1333/ |title= Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution |work=[[ROARMAP]]: Registry of Open Access Repository Mandates and Policies |publisher=[[University of Southampton]] |location=UK |accessdate= July 24, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institution has maintained a long and controversial business collaboration with the treasure hunter company Odyssey Marine &lt;ref&gt;https://www.abc.es/cultura/abci-trama-financiera-cazatesoros-detras-rescate-galeon-san-jose-201807090244_noticia.html&lt;/ref&gt;. Likewise, WHOI has participated in the location of the San JosÃ© galleon in Colombia for the commercial exploitation of the shipwreck by the Government of President Santos and a private company.

* [[R/V Atlantis (AGOR-25)|R/V ''Atlantis'' (AGOR-25)]] â 274 feet long, mothership of the ''Alvin'' submarine
* [[R/V Tioga|R/V ''Tioga'']] (WHOI-owned) â 60 feet long
* [[RV Neil Armstrong (AGOR-27)|RV ''Neil Armstrong'' (AGOR-27)]] â 238 feet long

===Small boat fleet===
WHOI operates many small boats used in inland harbors, ponds, rivers, and coastal bays. All are owned by the Institution itself.
* Motorboat ''Echo'' â 29 feet long (mainly used as a work boat to support dive operations, also the newest small research craft at WHOI)
* Motorboat ''Mytilus'' â 24 feet long (mainly used in water too shallow for larger craft and is a versatile coastal research boat)
* Motorboat ''Calanus'' â 21 feet long (mainly used in local water bodies such as Great Harbor, Vineyard Sound and Buzzards Bay)
* Motorboat ''Limulus'' â 13 feet long (mainly used to shuttle equipment to larger craft and as a work platform for near-shore research tasks)
* Rowboat ''Orzrus'' â 12 feet long (mainly used in harbors and ponds where motor craft are not permitted)

===Underwater vehicles===
