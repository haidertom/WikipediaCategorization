== Background ==

In 2012, the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) launched a new programme on the development of adverse outcome pathways. A guidance document describes in detail how AOPs are to be developed, reviewed, agreed and published at the OECD level.&lt;ref name="THE DEVELOPMENT OF AOPs"&gt;{{cite web|title=THE DEVELOPMENT OF AOPs|url=http://www.oecd.org/env/ehs/testing/AOP%20process_10%20June%202013.pdf|website=oecd.org |publisher=OECD}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AOP development and reviewing workflow is intended to take place via a web-based IT management tool: the Adverse Outcome Pathway Knowledge Base (AOP-KB)&lt;ref name=AOP-KB&gt;{{cite web|title=Adverse Outcome Pathway Knowledge Base (AOP-KB)|url=https://aopkb.oecd.org/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; which  is currently still under development. It is the wiki-based, user-friendly tool providing open-source interface for collaborative sharing of established AOPs and building new AOPs. 
The AOP-KB gives the scientific community the possibility to enter, share and discuss their AOP-related knowledge at one central point of information.
The AOP-KB allows for building AOPs by entering and then linking information about MIEs, KEs, AOs and ''' Chemical Initiators'''.
Knowing that pathway elements are not necessarily unique to a single AOP, value is added to existing knowledge by facilitating the re-use of MIE, KE and AO information in multiple AOPs, which prevents redundancy and make the collective knowledge about those entities available in all AOPs in which they appear.

The AOP-KB is a combination of individually developed applications, synchronised and orchestrated in a way that gives users the possibility to capture, review, browse and comment on AOPs shared by the AOP stakeholder community.

The AOP-KB project is an [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]]  initiative, which is executed as close collaboration between the [[Joint Research Centre]] of [[European Commission]], the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] and the  [[Engineer Research and Development Center]] of [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] for the purpose of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]]'s programme on the development of AOPs &lt;ref name="Adverse Outcome Pathways, Molecular Screening and Toxicogenomics"&gt;{{cite web|title=Adverse Outcome Pathways, Molecular Screening and Toxicogenomics|url=http://www.oecd.org/chemicalsafety/testing/adverse-outcome-pathways-molecular-screening-and-toxicogenomics.htm|publisher=OECD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The electrons are transported over [[ferredoxin]]s.&lt;ref name="PedenBoehm2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peden|first1=E. A.|last2=Boehm|first2=M.|last3=Mulder|first3=D.

==Truncated antenna==
The [[chlorophyll]] (Chl) antenna size in green algae is minimized, or truncated, to maximize photobiological solar conversion efficiency and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production. The truncated Chl antenna size minimizes absorption and wasteful dissipation of sunlight by individual cells, resulting in better light utilization efficiency and greater photosynthetic productivity by the green alga mass culture.&lt;ref name="KirstGarcia-Cerdan2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kirst|first1=H.|last2=Garcia-Cerdan|first2=J.

==History==
In 1939  [[Hans Gaffron]] observed that the algae he was studying, ''[[Chlamydomonas reinhardtii]]'' (a green-algae), would sometimes switch from the production of oxygen to the production of hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,54456,00.html Algae: Power Plant of the Future?]&lt;/ref&gt; He never discovered the cause of this change and for many years other scientists failed in their attempts to discover it. In the late 1990s, [[Anastasios Melis]] discovered that if the algae culture medium is deprived of sulfur it will switch from the production of oxygen (normal photosynthesis), to the production of hydrogen. He found that the [[enzyme]] responsible for this reaction is [[hydrogenase]], but that the hydrogenase lost this function in the presence of oxygen. Melis found that depleting the amount of sulfur available to the algae interrupted its internal oxygen flow, allowing the hydrogenase an environment in which it can react, causing the algae to produce hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/10.04/mustread.html?pg=5 Reengineering Algae To Fuel The Hydrogen Economy]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Chlamydomonas moewusii]]'' is also a good strain for the production of hydrogen.&lt;ref name="YangGuarnieri2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yang|first1=Shihui|last2=Guarnieri|first2=Michael T|last3=Smolinski|first3=Sharon|last4=Ghirardi|first4=Maria|last5=Pienkos|first5=Philip T|title=De novo transcriptomic analysis of hydrogen production in the green alga Chlamydomonas moewusii through RNA-Seq|journal=Biotechnology for Biofuels|volume=6|issue=1|year=2013|pages=118|issn=1754-6834|doi=10.1186/1754-6834-6-118|pmid=23971877|pmc=3846465}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics==
It would take about 25,000 square kilometre algal farming to produce biohydrogen equivalent to the energy provided by gasoline in the US alone.  This area represents approximately 10% of the area devoted to growing soya in the US.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/channel/earth/energy-fuels/mg18925401.600-growing-hydrogen-for-the-cars-of-tomorrow.html Growing hydrogen for the cars of tomorrow]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bioreactor design issues==
* Restriction of photosynthetic hydrogen production by accumulation of a [[proton gradient]].
* Competitive inhibition of photosynthetic hydrogen production by carbon dioxide.
* Requirement for bicarbonate binding at [[photosystem II]] (PSII) for [[Photosynthetic efficiency|efficient photosynthetic activity]].
* Competitive drainage of electrons by oxygen in algal hydrogen production.
* Economics must reach competitive price to other sources of energy and the economics are dependent on several parameters.
* A major technical obstacle is the efficiency in converting solar energy into chemical energy stored in molecular hydrogen.

Attempts are in progress to solve these problems via [[bioengineering]].

PCB, polychorinated biphenyls, are a type of chemical that was widely used in the 1960s and 1970s, and which is a contamination source of soil and water. They are fairly stable and therefore persistent in the environment. '''Bioremediation of PCBs''' is the use of microorganisms to degrade PCBs from contaminated sites, which can be either a soil or aqueous environment. It is a process relying on multiple microorganisms' co-metabolism. [[Anaerobic microorganism]]s dechlorinate PCBs first, and other microorganisms that are capable of doing [[BH pathway]] can break down the dechlorinated PCBs to usable intermediates like [[acyl-CoA]] or [[carbon dioxide]]. If no BH pathway-caple microorganisms are present, dechlorinated PCBs can be mineralized with help of fungi and plants. However, there are multiple limiting factors for this co-metabolism.

== Overview ==

=== PCBs ===
[[File:PCB_general_structure.svg|right|254x254px]]
[[Polychlorinated biphenyl]]s (PCBs) are various [[biphenyl]] based artificial products that are widely used as a [[dielectric]] fluid, industrial [[coolant]], and [[lubricant]]s in the 1960s and 1970s. There is no evidence its synthesis occurs naturally.  They are classified as persistent organic pollutants. PCBs share the basic chemical structure of biphenyl and one or more of the hydrogen atoms on the [[aromatic ring]]s are replaced by chlorine atoms.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Passatore|first=Laura|last2=Rossetti|first2=Simona|last3=Juwarkar|first3=Asha A.|last4=Massacci|first4=Angelo|date=2014-08-15|title=Phytoremediation and bioremediation of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs): State of knowledge and research perspectives|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389414003963|journal=Journal of Hazardous Materials|volume=278|pages=189–202|doi=10.1016/j.jhazmat.2014.05.051}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PCBs is in viscous liquid form at normal temperature and has a poor solubility in water. The aromatic hydrocarbon structure gives PCBs relatively high molecular stability. The chlorine substitution further reinforces its insolubility and chemical stability. Hence, the degradation of PCBs in the natural environment is very slow, which can range from 3 to 37 years depending on the number of chloride substitutions and their positions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Bioremediation ===
[[Bioremediation]] is a waste removal method that uses microorganisms to degrade or remove wastes like organic waste and heavy metal from contaminated sites including both soil and water. The advantages of bioremediation are that it is environment-friendly, inexpensive and can remove multiple wastes simultaneously comparing with traditional chemical and physical processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/805006965|title=Bioremediation methods and protocols|last=P.,|first=Cummings, Stephen|date=2010-01-01|publisher=Humana Press|isbn=9781607614395|oclc=805006965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Degradation Process ==
Various microorganisms are involved in a two-stage process of degradation of PCBs, which happens in aerobic and anaerobic environments. Degrading PCBs is similar to the degradation of biphenyl.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, the chlorines on PCBs prevent them from being utilized as a substrate of biphenyl degradation. Due to high chemical stability, PCBs cannot be used as energy sources.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ohtsubo|first=Yoshiyuki|last2=Kudo|first2=Toshiaki|last3=Tsuda|first3=Masataka|last4=Nagata|first4=Yuji|date=2004-08-01|title=Strategies for bioremediation of polychlorinated biphenyls|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00253-004-1654-y|journal=Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology|language=en|volume=65|issue=3|pages=250–258|doi=10.1007/s00253-004-1654-y|issn=0175-7598}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the chlorination, PCBs can be used as electron acceptors in anaerobic respiration to store energy, which is also the first stage of the degradation pathway, reductive dechlorination.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Once the PCBs are dechlorinated to a certain degree, usually lower than five chlorines presenting in the structure and one aromatic ring has no chlorine,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; they can undergo the biphenyl degradation pathway (BP pathway) to be degraded to accessible carbon or CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the aerobic environment. BP pathway is a pathway that utilizes series of enzymes ([[BphA]], B, C, D, E, F, G) to convert biphenyl to [[TCA Cycle|TCA cycle]] intermediates ([[pyruvate]] and [[Acyl-CoA]]) and [[benzoate]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, there are few microorganisms that can dechlorinate substrate under natural conditions. Even with selective media, the accumulation of PCB dechlorinating microorganisms is still slow, which is one reason for the slow degradation rate. As a result, PCBs usually go through a co-metabolism pathway that involving different microorganism species.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vasilyeva|first=G. K.|last2=Strijakova|first2=E. R.|date=2007-12-01|title=Bioremediation of soils and sediments contaminated by polychlorinated biphenyls|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S002626170706001X|journal=Microbiology|language=en|volume=76|issue=6|pages=639–653|doi=10.1134/S002626170706001X|issn=0026-2617}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally speaking, there are four steps in this process:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
# In order for PCBs to enter the cell, they firstly need to be solubilized.
# PCBs are dechlorinated by anaerobic bacteria, then transport the metabolites to [[aerobic bacteria]] or fungi through a [[biofilm]].
# The presence of PCBs metabolites triggers the expression of enzymes in BP pathway.
# PCBs are broken down to Acetyl-CoA and then can be utilized or carbon dioxide.
The Figure below shows the complete degradation pathway.  [[File:PCBs' Degradation Pathway.jpg|thumb|495x495px]]

== Limiting Factors ==

=== PCBs entering the cells ===
PCBs have low water solubility, so they adhere tightly to soil and cannot be easily accessed by bacteria. Especially, if the contaminations site has been exposed to PCBs for long period, PCBs can be integrated into soil or sediment matrices, then further decrease their bioavailability. Some surfactants can help solubilize but cannot increase the rate of PCBs degrading. However, if PCBs are linked to surfactants tightly too, then this process cannot promote the absorption of PCBs and even lower it. Also, many surfactants have been proven to be toxic to cells and the high cost of surfactants is another issues.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== PCBs properties ===
PCBs are toxic to bacterial communities above 1000&amp;nbsp;mg/kg. However, if the concentration is too low (lower than 50&amp;nbsp;mg/kg), the degradation slows down significantly, for there is not enough material to stimulate the expression of required genes and support the growth of competent microorganisms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; PCBs includes various different compounds with slightly different structures. Those slight differences make big differences in metabolic rate. Generally speaking, the more chlorines in a PCB molecule, the harder for it to be degraded. In particular,  microorganisms cannot degrade di- and tetra-ortho substituted well. It is possible that those structures prevent enzymes from accessing reaction sites.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Soil and sediment characteristics ===
First, the soil and [[sediment]] structures will determine how tightly PCBs are adhered to them and affect the absorption of PCBs into cells. The PCBs’ availability suffers from increasing organic carbon and clay content, for they promote the absorption of PCBs into soil or sediment matrices.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Second, the soil contains necessary nutrition for the growth of microbes and anaerobic and aerobic environments.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Finally, the local microbial population has significant impacts on the rate of degradation of PCBs, which varies based on the microbial strains and their activities. Then, if there is no history of exposure to PCBs, it may take months for microbes to activates their ability to dechlorinate PCBs and break them down.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Gene expression and bottleneck effect of metabolites ===
PCBs or biphenyl cannot provide energy for microbes, so they are primary energy and carbon sources. As stated before it takes months sometimes for microorganisms to activate their gene for dichlorine after the first exposure to PCBs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It has been proposed to use analogs to promote the activation of genes. However, even after the metabolic pathway is activated, the intermediates of the pathway create a bottleneck effect due to their toxicity. Also, there is the possibility that BP pathway leads to [[protoanemonin]] which is a dead-end metabolite that cannot be utilized by cells. Due to the high energy cost of this pathway, if no preferred energy source present in the system, cells will not activate this pathway.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''''Buddhist Studies Review''''' is a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] published by [[Equinox Publishing (London)|Equinox]] on behalf of the [[UK Association for Buddhist Studies]]. It was founded in 1983 by [[Russell Webb (academic)|Russell Webb]] and [[Sara Boin-Webb]]. The UK Association for Buddhist Studies was established in 1996 and took over publication of ''Buddhist Studies Review'' two years later. The journal publishes articles on any aspect of [[Buddhism]]. It covers the different cultural areas where Buddhism exists or has existed (in Central, East, South, and Southeast [[Asia]]), historical and contemporary aspects (including developments in "Western" Buddhism), theoretical, practical and methodological issues, textual, linguistic, archaeological and art-historical studies, and different disciplinary approaches to the subject (e.g. [[archaeology]], [[art history]], [[anthropology]], [[Asian studies]], [[comparative religion]], [[law]], [[oriental studies]], [[philosophy]], [[philology]], [[psychology]], [[religious studies]], and [[theology]]).

The '''Canadian Association for Irish Studies''' (L'association canadienne d'études irlandaises)  or CAIS was founded in 1973. Its objective is to promote the study of Irish culture in [[Canada]], and its particular aim is to attract young scholars to the field. It uses conferences, publications and online resources to promote discussion of current ideas relating to Irish studies and culture.

CAIS has members throughout Canada. Others can be found in [[Ireland]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], the [[United States]], Europe, Asia and Australasia.

Among the Association's activities are an annual conference at a university in Canada. These conferences are attended by students, scholars and members of the public.

The Association also publishes the semi-annual ''Canadian Journal of Irish Studies'' and a newsletter.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9015">'''Catchiness''' is how easy it is for one to remember a song, tune or phrase. It is often taken into account when writing songs, [[catchphrases]], [[advertising slogan]]s, [[jingle]]s etc.  Alternatively, it can be defined as how difficult it is for one to forget it. Songs that embody high levels of remembrance or catchiness are literally known as "catchy songs" or "[[earworms]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| work = Dictionary | title=Earworm | type = definition | edition = online|url = http://east.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/earworm | publisher= Merriam-Webster| accessdate= 6 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it is hard to scientifically explain what makes a song catchy, there are many documented techniques that recur throughout catchy music, such as [[Repetition (music)|repetition]], [[hook (music)|hooks]] and [[alliteration]]. ''Selling Sounds: The Commercial Revolution in American Music'' says that "although there was no definition for what made a song catchy, all the [[songwriting]] guides agreed that simplicity and familiarity were vital".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=BVCLq8-X_dAC&amp;pg=PA49 | title = Selling Sounds: The Commercial Revolution in American Music | first = David | last = Suisman | publisher = Google Books | page = 49}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The physical symptoms of [[listening]] to a catchy song include "running [it] over in our heads or [[Entrainment (biomusicology)|tapping a foot]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=oqUXrBcaQjoC&amp;pg=PA133&amp;lpg=PA133 | title = How to Do Things with Videogames | accessdate= September 23, 2012 | last = Bogost | first = Ian | page = 133}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Todd Tremlin, catchy music "spread[s] because [it] resonates similarly from one mind to the next".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mU1MeyjBSggC&amp;pg=PA195&amp;lpg=PA195 | title=Minds and Gods:The Cognitive Foundations of Religion | accessdate= September 23, 2012 | last =Tremlin | first = Todd | page = 195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
In an article written by psychologist Tom Stafford for [[BBC]], the psychology of "earworms" (catchy songs) is discussed.  These songs are referred to as earworms due to their parasitic characteristics; their entrance and exit from our mind cannot be controlled and despite our best efforts they may refuse to leave. In that aspect, catchiness, depending on how digestible the music is to the listener, has a level of annoyance unlike anything else. In this article Stafford reviews the work of neurologist [[Oliver Sacks]] and the conclusion by Sacks that this catchiness is due to the inherent repetitiveness of popular music, which can affect our ability to remember a song. It is concluded that since memory is powerfully affected by repetition that this could be a significant contributing factor to catchiness, though certainly not the only aspect. A song's catchiness may also be due to the auditory "slave system" of our inner ear, much like the visual slave system of our "mind's eye." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120411-why-do-songs-stick-in-our-heads | title= Earworms: Why catchy tunes get trapped in our heads | publisher=BBC News | date=April 11, 2012 | accessdate=May 10, 2013 | last =Stafford | first = Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, a song with few qualities can still become immensely popular due to its catchiness. According to T.C.W. Blanning: "I would sacrifice everything – rhyme, reason, sense, and sentiment to catchiness. There is... a very great art in making rubbish acceptable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=6RptffQRvEEC&amp;pg=PA164&amp;lpg=PA164 | title=The Triumph of Music: The Rise of Composers, Musicians and Their Art | accessdate=September 23, 2012 | last = Blanning | first = TCW | page = 164}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] review explains that "any lack of originality (in the album ''[[The Remote Part]]'') is more than made up for by the... catchiness of the musical arrangement"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=VQ8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA37&amp;lpg=PA37 | title=Billboard | date=April 5, 2003 | accessdate=September 23, 2012 | page = 37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the 2011 song "[[Call Me Maybe]]", which has been identified as a very catchy song, an article by [[ABC News]] listed some of its "catchiness factors." The article explains that it has a chorus which is "melodically easy on the ear, simple enough to stay in your head all day, and is topically appealing to [[Carly Rae Jepsen|Jepsen]]’s target pop demographic." It also briefly describes the concept of musical incongruity and its use within the song. In music, incongruity refers to the inclusion of varied or irregular musical and lyrical features, such as mispronounced words or unexpected syllable accentuation. These incongruities are intended to capture the listener's attention and to preserve their level of interest throughout the song, regardless of the simple and otherwise repetitive [[lyrics|lyrical content]]. [[Songwriter]]/[[Record producer|producer]] Eve Nelson was quoted saying, "a five-year-old could probably sing this, because it’s just so easy." As well as having lyrical hooks, the music itself can also be considered a hook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/entertainment/2012/06/why-call-me-maybe-is-so-catchy/ | title=Why ‘Call Me Maybe’ Is So Catchy | publisher=ABC News | date=June 22, 2012 | accessdate=September 23, 2012 | last = Sher | first = Lauren}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Musicologist Dr. Alison Pawley and psychologist Dr. Daniel Mullensiefen identified the following as factors of a song being catchy:

# Longer and detailed [[Phrase (music)|musical phrases]].
# Higher number of [[pitch (music)|pitches]] in the chorus hook.
# Male vocalists
# Higher male [[voice]]s with noticeable vocal effort

Based on these factors, the researchers listed British rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s "[[We Are The Champions]]" as the number one "sing-along song" in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.zmescience.com/research/studies/what-makes-a-song-catchy-science-explains/ |title=What makes a song ‘catchy’ – science explains |work=ZME Science |date= 3 October 2011 | accessdate=13 February 2015 | last =Puiu | first = Tibi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 study by the [[University of Amsterdam]] and the [[Museum of Science and Industry (Manchester)|Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester]] found "[[Wannabe]]" by the [[Spice Girls]] to be the catchiest pop song of the last 60 years in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/3554568/wannabe-spice-girls-catchiest-song/|title='Wannabe' by the Spice Girls Is the Catchiest Song, Study Says|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=3 November 2014|accessdate=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that having a simple and relentless melody was the key to a song being "catchy". "We found, much to our surprise, that writing a very surprising and unusual hook is not the recipe for long term memorability,” musicologist Dr John Ashley Burgoyne explained. “Actually, the more conventional your melody in terms of the interval patterns that you use; in terms of the rhythms that you use, the easier the song is to remember over the long term. What makes Wannabe work so well is that it isn’t a difficult song to sing, it has a conventional melody that repeats itself a lot, and it’s just relentless.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160708-why-spice-girls-wannabe-is-the-catchiest-song-of-all-time|title=Why Spice Girls' Wannabe is the catchiest song of all time|work=BBC |date=8 July 2016|accessdate=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System''' (CSDMS) deals with the [[Earth]]'s surface and the observable and projected changes constantly taking place – the ever-changing dynamic interface between lithosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere and atmosphere.

CSDMS supports the development, integration, dissemination and archiving of community open-source software, that reflects and predicts earth-surface processes over a broad range of temporal and spatial scales.

Over 500 research institutions from more than 65 countries comprise the community effort. CSDMS distributes hundreds of [[open-source model]]s and modeling tools, provides access to high performance computing clusters in support of developing and running earth surface models, and offers a suite of products for education and knowledge transfer.

The CSDMS architecture employs frameworks and services that convert stand-alone models into flexible "plug-and-play" components to be assembled into larger applications.   CSDMS focuses on the movement of fluids and the sediment and solutes they transport through landscapes, seascapes and sedimentary basins.  Began in 2007 under the leadership of [[James Syvitski]], formerly the director of the [[Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research]] (INSTAAR), Boulder, CO, CSDMS operates under continuing funding from the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) to coordinate this national effort related to surface dynamic modeling.

Conservation of [[cultural heritage]] involves protection and restoration using "any methods that prove effective in keeping that property in as close to its original condition as possible for as long as possible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Walston, S.|year=1978|page=9 |title=The Preservation and Conservation of Aboriginal and Pacific Cultural Material in Australian Museums|journal= ICCM Bulletin |volume=4 |issue= 1|url=http://www.aiccm.org.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=319:the-preservation-and-conservation-of-aboriginal-and-pacific-cultural-material-in-australian-museums&amp;catid=79:1978-iccm-bulletin-volume-4-no-4&amp;Itemid=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservation of cultural heritage is often associated with [[Collection (artwork)|art collections]] and [[museum]]s and involves collection care and management through tracking, examination, documentation, exhibition, storage, preventative conservation, and restoration.&lt;ref name = Szczepanowska2013&gt;Szczepanowska, Hanna M.. 2013. Conservation of cultural heritage: key principles and approaches. Routledge. {{ISBN|978-0415674744}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The scope has widened from art conservation, involving protection and care of artwork and architecture, to conservation of cultural heritage, also including protection and care of a broad set of other cultural and historical works. Conservation of cultural heritage can be described as a type of ethical [[stewardship]].

Conservation of cultural heritage applies simple ethical guidelines:
* Minimal intervention;
* Appropriate materials and reversible methods;
* Full documentation of all work undertaken.

Often there are compromises between preserving appearance, maintaining original design and material properties, and ability to reverse changes. Reversibility is now emphasized so as to reduce problems with future treatment, investigation, and use.

In order for conservators to decide upon an appropriate conservation strategy and apply their professional expertise accordingly, they must take into account views of the [[Project stakeholder|stakeholder]], the [[Values (heritage)|values]] and [[Preservation of meaning|meaning]] of the work, and the physical needs of the material.

Cesare Brandi in his ''Theory of Restoration'', describes restoration as "the methodological moment in which the work of art is appreciated in its material form and in its historical and aesthetic duality, with a view to transmitting it to the future".&lt;ref&gt;[Cesare Brandi, ''Teoria del restauro''; Rome: Edizioni di Storia e Letteratura, 1963: reprint, Turin: G. Einaudi, 1977]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Key dates===
{{main article|List of dates in the history of art conservation}}

Some consider the tradition of conservation of cultural heritage in Europe to have begun in 1565 with the [[restoration of the Sistine Chapel frescoes]], but more ancient examples include the work of [[Cassiodorus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pergoli Campanelli|first=Alessandro|title=Cassiodoro alle origini dell'idea di restauro|year=2013|publisher=Jaca book|location=Milano|isbn=978-88-16-41207-1|page=140|url=https://www.academia.edu/3522730/Cassiodoro_alle_origini_dellidea_di_restauro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cloître Saint-Trophime Arles Conservation.jpg|thumb|A temporary windowed partition along restoration work area in the cloister of the [[Church of St. Trophime, Arles]]]]
The care of cultural heritage has a long history, one that was primarily aimed at fixing and mending objects for their continued use and aesthetic enjoyment.&lt;ref&gt;Pye, E, 2001. Caring for the Past: Issues in Conservation for Archaeology and Museums. London: James and James&lt;/ref&gt; Until the early 20th century, artists were normally the ones called upon to repair damaged artworks. During the 19th century, however, the fields of science and art became increasingly intertwined as scientists such as [[Michael Faraday]] began to study the damaging effects of the environment to works of art. [[Louis Pasteur]] carried out scientific analysis on paint as well.&lt;ref&gt;Stoner, Joyce Hill. 2005. p. 41. [http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11413&amp;page=41 “Changing Approaches in Art Conservation: 1925 to the present”] in (Sackler NAS Colloquium) Scientific Examination of Art: Modern Techniques in Conservation and Analysis. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.&lt;/ref&gt; However, perhaps the first organized attempt to apply a theoretical framework to the conservation of cultural heritage came with the founding in the [[United Kingdom]] of the [[Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings]] in 1877. The society was founded by [[William Morris]] and [[Philip Webb]], both of whom were deeply influenced by the writings of [[John Ruskin]]. During the same period, a French movement with similar aims was being developed under the direction of [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]], an architect and theorist, famous for his restorations of medieval buildings.

[[File:Bixi stele (wrapped), Harvard University, Cambridge, MA - IMG 4607.JPG|thumb|Since 1998, [[Harvard University]] wraps some of the valuable statues on its campus, such as this "[[Harvard Bixi|Chinese stele]]", with waterproof covers every winter, in order to protect them from erosion caused by [[acid rain]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://harvardmagazine.com/2000/03/art-under-wraps.html Art Under Wraps]", Harvard Magazine, March–April 2000&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Conservation of cultural heritage as a distinct field of study initially developed in Germany, where in 1888 [[Friedrich Rathgen]] became the first [[chemist]] to be employed by a [[Museum]], the Koniglichen Museen, Berlin ([[Royal Museum (Berlin)|Royal Museums of Berlin]]). He not only developed a scientific approach to the care of objects in the collections, but disseminated this approach by publishing a Handbook of Conservation in 1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gilberg, Mark.|year=1987|title= Friedrich Rathgen: The Father of Modern Archaeological Conservation|journal= Journal of the American Institute for Conservation|volume=26|issue= 2|pages=105–120 |url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/jaic/articles/jaic26-02-004_2.html|doi=10.2307/3179459}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early development of conservation of cultural heritage in any area of the world is usually linked to the creation of positions for chemists within museums. In the United Kingdom, pioneering research into painting materials and conservation, ceramics, and stone conservation was conducted by [[Arthur Pillans Laurie]], academic chemist and Principal of [[Heriot-Watt University]] from 1900. Laurie's interests were fostered by [[William Holman Hunt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nahste.ac.uk/isaar/GB_0237_NAHSTE_P1161.html |title=Brief biography of Professor AP Laurie |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714201324/http://www.nahste.ac.uk/isaar/GB_0237_NAHSTE_P1161.html |archivedate=2012-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924 the chemist [[Dr Harold Plenderleith]] began to work at the [[British Museum]] with Dr. Alexander Scott in the recently created Research Laboratory, although he was actually employed by the [[Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (United Kingdom)|Department of Scientific and Industrial Research]] in the early years. Plenderleith's appointment may be said to have given birth to the conservation ''profession'' in the UK, although there had been craftsmen in many museums and in the commercial art world for generations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/conservation_and_science/history.aspx History]. British Museum (2012-06-14). Retrieved on 2012-06-29.&lt;/ref&gt; This department was created by the museum to address the deteriorating condition of objects in the collection, damages which were a result of their being stored in the [[London Underground]] tunnels during the [[First World War]]. The creation of this department moved the focus for the development of conservation theory and practice from Germany to Britain, and made the latter a prime force in this fledgling field. In 1956 Plenderleith wrote a significant handbook called The Conservation of Antiquities and Works of Art, which supplanted Rathgen's earlier tome and set new standards for the development of art and [[Conservation science (cultural heritage)|conservation science]].

In the [[United States]], the development of conservation of cultural heritage can be traced to the [[Fogg Art Museum]], and Edward Waldo Forbes, its director from 1909 to 1944. He encouraged technical investigation, and was Chairman of the Advisory Committee for the first technical journal, Technical Studies in the Field of the Fine Arts, published by the Fogg from 1932 to 1942. Importantly he also brought onto the museum staff chemists. [[Rutherford John Gettens]] was the first of usch in the US to be permanently employed by an art museum. He worked with [[George L. Stout]], the founder and first editor of Technical Studies. Gettens and Stout co-authored Painting Materials: A Short Encyclopaedia in 1942, reprinted in 1966. This compendium is still cited regularly. Only a few dates and descriptions in Gettens' and Stout's book are now outdated.&lt;ref name="Stoner, Joyce Hill 2003"&gt;Stoner, Joyce Hill. "Changing Approaches in Art Conservation: 1925 to the present". The publication exists in two editions. The earlier one is "Scientific Examination of Art: Modern Techniques on Conservation and Analysis" and was published by the National Academy of Sciences in 2003. The later edition of the publication is "Arthur M. Sackler Colloquia: Scientific Examination of Art: Modern Techniques in Conservation and Analysis". It was published by the National Academies Press in 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

George T. Oliver, of [[Oliver Brothers Fine Art Restoration|Oliver Brothers Art Restoration and Art Conservation-Boston]]
(Est. 1850 in New York City) invented the vacuum hot table for [[lining of paintings|relining]] paintings in 1920s; he filed a patent for the table in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Patent# 2,073,802 [http://patft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PALL&amp;s1=Oliver-George-T.INNM.&amp;OS=IN/Oliver-George-T&amp;RS=IN/Oliver-George-T U.S. "Art of Oil Painting Restoration"], March 16, 1937. Patft1.uspto.gov. Retrieved on 2012-06-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor's prototype table, which he designed and constructed, is still in operation. Oliver Brothers is believed to be the first and the oldest continuously operating art restoration company in the United States.

The focus of conservation development then accelerated in Britain and America, and it was in Britain that the first International Conservation Organisations developed. [[International Institute for Conservation|The International Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (IIC)]] was incorporated under British law in 1950 as "a permanent organization to co-ordinate and improve the knowledge, methods, and working standards needed to protect and preserve precious materials of all kinds."&lt;ref name="Stoner, Joyce Hill 2003"/&gt; The rapid growth of conservation professional organizations, publications, journals, newsletters, both internationally and in localities, has spearheaded the development of the conservation profession, both practically and theoretically. Art historians and theorists such as [[Cesare Brandi]] have also played a significant role in developing conservation science theory. In recent years ethical concerns have been at the forefront of developments in conservation. Most significantly has been the idea of [[preventive conservation]]. This concept is based in part on the pioneering work by [[Garry Thomson]] [[CBE]], and his book the Museum Environment, first published in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Museum Environment (2nd Edition), 1986, by Garry Thomson CBE {{ISBN|978-0-7506-2041-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomson was associated with the [[National Gallery (London)|National Gallery]] in London; it was here that he established a set of guidelines or environmental controls for the best conditions in which objects could be stored and displayed within the museum environment. Although his exact guidelines are no longer rigidly followed, they did inspire this field of conservation.

==Ethics==
The conservator's work is guided by ethical standards. These take the form of [[applied ethics]]. Ethical standards have been established across the world, and national and international ethical guidelines have been written. One such example is:

* [[American Institute for Conservation]] Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practice &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conservation-us.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.viewpage&amp;pageid=858 AIC – Code of Ethics]. Conservation-us.org. Retrieved on 2012-06-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrieved 2017-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt; including examples of codes of ethics and guidelines for professional conduct in conservation and allied fields; and charters and treaties pertaining to ethical issues involving the preservation of cultural property.

As well as standards of practice conservators deal with wider ethical concerns, such as the debates as to whether all art is worth preserving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weil|first=Stephen E.|date=October 1989|title=Too much Art?|journal=[[ArtNews]]|page=232|issn=0004-3273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Caring for cultural heritage==

===Collections care===
{{Main article|Collections care}}
Many cultural works are sensitive to environmental conditions such as [[temperature]], [[humidity]] and exposure to [[light|visible light]] and [[ultraviolet|ultraviolet radiation]]. These works must be protected in controlled environments where such variables are maintained within a range of damage-limiting levels. For example, [[watercolour painting|watercolour paintings]] usually require shielding from sunlight to prevent fading of [[pigment]]s.

Collections care is an important element of museum policy. It is an essential responsibility of members of the museum profession to create and maintain a protective environment for the collections in their care, whether in store, on display, or in transit. A museum should carefully monitor the condition of collections to determine when an artifact requires conservation work and the services of a qualified conservator.

[[Image:Preventive Conservation - Serra da Capivara.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Work of preventive conservation in a rock wall with prehistoric paintings at the [[Serra da Capivara National Park]]. The work consists of filling the cracks to prevent the fragmentation of the wall.]]

===Interventive conservation===
[[File:FurnitureConservation2.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Furniture conservation – Re-glueing loose element of solid nut marriage chest (probably Italy, 19th century)]]
A principal aim of a cultural conservator is to reduce the rate of deterioration of an object. Both non-interventive and interventive methodologies may be employed in pursuit of this goal. Interventive conservation refers to any direct interaction between the conservator and the material fabric of the object. Interventive actions are carried out for a variety of reasons, including aesthetic choices, stabilization needs for structural integrity, or cultural requirements for intangible continuity. Examples of interventive treatments include the removal of discolored varnish from a painting, the application of wax to a sculpture, and the washing and rebinding of a book. Ethical standards within the field require that the conservator fully justify interventive actions and carry out documentation before, during, and after the treatment.

One of the guiding principles of conservation of cultural heritage has traditionally been the idea of reversibility, that all interventions with the object should be fully reversible and that the object should be able to be returned to the state in which it was prior to the conservator's intervention. Although this concept remains a guiding principle of the profession, it has been widely critiqued within the conservation profession&lt;ref&gt;[[William Andrew Oddy|Andrew Oddy]] and Sara Carroll (eds). 1999. Reversibility – Does it Exist? British Museum Occasional Paper Number 135. London: British Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; and is now considered by many to be "a fuzzy concept."&lt;ref&gt;p. 185. Muñoz-Viñas, Salvador. 2005. Contemporary Theory of Conservation. London: Elsevier/Butterworth Heinemann.&lt;/ref&gt; Another important principle of conservation is that all alterations should be well documented and should be clearly distinguishable from the original object.&lt;ref&gt;[http://icom-cc.icom.museum/Start/ ICOM-CC] International Council of Museums Committee for Conservation]&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a highly publicized interventive conservation effort would be the conservation work conducted on the [[restoration of the Sistine Chapel frescoes|Sistine Chapel]].

==Conservation laboratories==
[[Image:The Lunder Conservation Center Laboratory.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The Lunder Conservation Center. Conservation staff for both the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] and the [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]] are visible to the public through floor-to-ceiling glass walls that allow visitors to see firsthand all the techniques that [[Conservator (museum)|conservators]] use to examine, treat and preserve artworks within a functioning conservation Laboratory.]]
Conservators routinely use chemical and scientific analysis for the examination and treatment of cultural works. The modern conservation laboratory uses equipment such as [[microscope]]s, [[spectrometer]]s, and various [[x-ray]] regime instruments to better understand objects and their components. The data thus collected helps in deciding the conservation treatments to be provided to the object.

==Country by country look==

===United States===
Heritage Preservation, in partnership with the [[Institute of Museum and Library Services]], a U.S. federal agency, produced The Heritage Health Index. The results of this work was the report [http://www.heritagepreservation.org/HHI/summary.html A Public Trust at Risk: The Heritage Health Index Report on the State of America's Collections], which was published in December 2005 and concluded that immediate action is needed to prevent the loss of 190 million artifacts that are in need of conservation treatment. The report made four recommendations:
* Institutions must give priority to providing safe conditions for the collections they hold in trust.
* Every collecting institution must develop an emergency plan to protect its collections and train staff to carry it out.
* Every institution must assign responsibility for caring for collections to members of its staff.
* Individuals at all levels of government and in the private sector must assume responsibility for providing the support that will allow these collections to survive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritagepreservation.org/HHI/ Heritage Health Index].

===United Kingdom===
[[File:Victoria and Albert conservation.jpg|thumb|Conservation in Progress note, [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] (2014)]]
In October 2006, the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]], a governmental department, authored a document: "Understanding the Future: Priorities for England's Museums".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gov.uk/images/consultations/cons_uf_prioritiesforenglandsmuseums.pdf Understanding the Future: Priorities for England’s Museums]. Department for Culture, Media and Sport. culture.gov.uk. October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; This document was based on several years of consultation aimed to lay out the government's priorities for museums in the 21st century.

The document listed the following as priorities for the next decade:

# Museums will fulfil their potential as learning resources (pp 7–10).
#* Museums will be embedded into the delivery of education in every school in the country.
#* Understanding of the effectiveness of museum education will be improved further and best practice built into education programmes.
#* The value of museums' collections as a research resource will be well understood and better links built between the academic community and museums.
# Museums will embrace their role in fostering, exploring, celebrating and questioning the identities of diverse communities (pp 11–14).
#* The sector needs to work with partners in academia and beyond to create an intellectual framework supporting museums' capacity to tackle issues of identity.
#* The museum sector must continue to develop improved practical techniques for engaging communities of all sorts.
# Museums' collections will be more dynamic and better used (pp 15–18).
#* Government and the sector will find new ways to encourage museums to collect actively and strategically, especially the record of contemporary society.
#* The sector will develop new collaborative approaches to sharing and developing collections and related expertise.
# Museums' workforces will be dynamic, highly skilled and representative (pp 17–22).
#* Museums' governing bodies and workforces will be representative of the communities they serve.
#* Find more varied ways for a broader range of skills to come into museums.
#* Improve continuing professional development.
# Museums will work more closely with each other and partners outside the sector (pp 23–26).
#* A consistent evidence base of the contribution of all kinds of museums to the full range of public service agendas will be developed.
#* There will be deeper and longer lasting partnerships between the national museums and a broader range of regional partners.
#* Museums' international roles will be strengthened to improve museum programmes in this country and Britain's image, reputation and relationships abroad.

The conservation profession response to this report was on the whole less than favourable, the [[Institute of Conservation]] (ICON) published their response under the title "A Failure of Vision".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icon.org.uk/images/stories/icon_understanding_the_future.pdf Understanding the Future: Priorities for England’s Museums]. The Institute of Conservation. icon.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt; It had the following to say:

{{quote| "No sector can look with confidence to the future if its key asset is worked harder and harder across an ever broadening range of objectives while the inputs required to sustain it are neglected." }}

{{quote|"It is of major concern to us that the only part of this section which makes any acknowledgement of the need for greater resourcing is the part which refers to acquisitions. The original consultation paper made quite extensive reference to the importance of collections, the role of new technologies, and cultural property issues, but this appears to have been whittled away in the present document." }}

Concluding: {{quote| "When asked by the Commons Culture Media and Sport elect Committee CMS committee what he would like to see as a priority in the DCMS document arising from the 'Understanding the Future' consultation, Mr MacGregor responded 'I would like to see added there the need to conserve and research the collections, so that the collections can really play the role across the whole of the United Kingdom that they should.'
So would we."}}

* A national survey to find out what the public want from museums, what motivates them to visit them and what makes for a rewarding visit.
* A review of survey results and prioritisation of the various intrinsic, instrumental and institutional values to provide a clear basis for a 10-year strategy
* HR consultants to be brought in from the commercial sector to review recruitment, career development and working practices in the national and regional museums.
* A commitment to examine the potential for using Museum Accreditation as a more effective driver for improving recruitment, diversity, and career development across the sector.
* DCMS to take full account of the eventual findings of the current Commons Select Committee enquiry into Care of Collections in the final version of this document
* The adoption of those recommendations of the recent House of Lords enquiry into [[Heritage Science#Development of ‘Heritage Science’|Science and Heritage]] which have a potential impact on the future of museums.

In November 2008, the UK-based [[think tank]] [[Demos (UK think tank)|Demos]] published an influential pamphlet entitled ''It's a material world: caring for the public realm'',&lt;ref&gt;
Holden, John. and Samuel Jones. 2008. [http://demos.co.uk/files/Material%20World%20-%20web.pdf It's A Material World: Caring for the public realm]. London: Demos.&lt;/ref&gt; in which they argue for integrating the public directly into efforts to conserve material culture, particularly that which is in the public, their argument, as stated on page 16, demonstrates their belief that society can benefit from conservation as a paradigm as well as a profession:

{{quote|"conservators provide a paradigm not just for fixing things when they are broken, but for a wider social ethos of care, where we individually and collectively take responsibility and action"}}

==Training==
{{main article|Art conservation training}}
Training in conservation of cultural heritage for many years took the form of an [[apprenticeship]], whereby an apprentice slowly developed the necessary skills to undertake their job. For some specializations within conservation this is still the case. However, it is more common in the field of conservation today that the training required to become a practicing conservator comes from a recognized university course in conservation of cultural heritage.&lt;ref name="AIC training" &gt;[http://www.conservation-us.org/training AIC – Becoming a Conservator]. Conservation-us.org. Retrieved on 2012-06-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The University can rarely provide all the necessary training in first hand experience that an apprenticeship can, and therefore in addition to graduate level training the profession also tends towards encouraging conservation students to spend time as an [[intern]].

Conservation of cultural heritage is an [[interdisciplinary]] field as conservators have backgrounds in the [[fine arts]], sciences (including [[chemistry]], [[biology]], and [[materials science]]), and closely related disciplines, such as [[art history]], [[archaeology]], [[studio art]], and [[anthropology]]. They also have design, fabrication, artistic, and other special skills necessary for the practical application of that knowledge.

Within the various schools that teach conservation of cultural heritage, the approach differs according to the educational and vocational system within the country, and the focus of the school itself. This is acknowledged by the [[American Institute for Conservation]] who advise "Specific admission requirements differ and potential candidates are encouraged to contact the programs directly for details on prerequisites, application procedures, and program curriculum".&lt;ref name="AIC training" /&gt;

In France, training for heritage conservation is taught by the [[Institut national du patrimoine]] (The National Institute of Cultural Heritage). 

==Associations and professional organizations==
{{main article|Conservation associations and professional organizations}}
Societies devoted to the care of cultural heritage have been in existence around the world for many years. One early example is the founding in 1877 of the [[Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings]] in Britain to protect the built heritage, this society continues to be active today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spab.org.uk/html/what-is-spab/history-of-the-spab/ History of the SPAB]. Retrieved on 2012-06-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The built heritage was at the forefront of the growth of member based organizations in the [[United States]]. [[Preservation Virginia]], founded in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] in 1889 as the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities, was the United States' first statewide historic preservation group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apva.org/ APVA Preservation Virginia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613122322/http://www.apva.org/ |date=2008-06-13 }}. Apva.org. Retrieved on 2012-06-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, professional conservators join and take part in the activities of numerous conservation associations and professional organizations with the wider field, and within their area of specialization.

These organizations exist to "support the conservation professionals who preserve our cultural heritage".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conservation-us.org/about About AIC – Overview]. Conservation-us.org. Retrieved on 2012-06-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

This involves upholding professional standards, promoting research and publications, providing educational opportunities, and fostering the exchange of knowledge among cultural conservators, allied professionals, and the public.

'''Dancing Dots Braille Music Technology''', L.P., is an American company based in [[Philadelphia]] that was founded in 1992 to develop and adapt music technology for the blind. Its founder, Bill McCann, is a blind musician. Among the products it offers are several programs that produce a musical version of [[Braille]] by converting print [[musical notation]], allowing blind musicians access to the [[Sheet music|scores]] used by their sighted counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rudolph | first = Thomas E. | title = Teaching Music With Technology | publisher = GIA Publications | year = 2004 | isbn = 1-57999-313-3 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OnPnMsWOkVAC&amp;pg=PA188&amp;dq=%22Dancing+Dots%22&amp;client=firefox-a | page = 188}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company also offers programs that aid blind musicians in [[Transcription (music)|transcribing]] their compositions to Braille.&lt;ref name=BW&gt;{{cite news|last=Williams |first=John M. |title=Blind musicians get a techno boost |work=[[Business Week]] |date=2000-11-19 |accessdate=2008-10-27 |url=http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/nov2000/nf20001129_316.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523214017/http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/nov2000/nf20001129_316.htm |archivedate=2011-05-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dancing Dots created the latter products to help speed the process of Braille transcription for blind composers, who might otherwise have to wait between two weeks and six months to have their compositions transcribed by one of the less than one hundred certified Braille music transcribers in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Solomon | first = Karen | date = 2000-02-24 | title = You gotta feel the music | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | accessdate = 2008-10-26 | url = https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2000/02/34495}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dancing Dots has developed more products to help blind musicians in the areas of [[MIDI]] and [[digital audio]] production and musical instruction.

==History==
The company was founded in 1992 by Bill McCann, a blind [[trumpeter]]. It struggled financially in its early years in the long lead between developing technology and releasing its first product in 1997, a difficult period assisted by federal contracts beginning in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Byrd | first = Jerry W. | title = U.S. says customer is king | work = [[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] | url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PI&amp;s_site=philly&amp;p_multi=PI&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB2A64F8AAB5388&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM | date = 1994-09-21 | accessdate = 2008-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, the company released its GOODFEEL Braille Music Translator to positive reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Brown | first = Jennifer | date = 1997-06-15 | title = Software Hits Right Note for Blind Musicians; Technology: GOODFEEL program translates music into Braille.

==Products and services==
Dancing Dots maintains a website at which it markets its products, as well as related and complementary products by other companies. Dancing Dots has customers throughout the U.S. and twenty-six other countries.

With GOODFEEL combined with a few mainstream products, sighted musicians can prepare a Braille score with no knowledge of braille. Music scanning software can be used to speed data entry. Blind users can make sound recordings and print and Braille editions of their compositions. The company provides customers who may not need to purchase their own copy of GOODFEEL a transcription service for individual scores.

Dancing Dots is also the publisher of several courses to assist blind musicians, including ''An Introduction to Music for the Blind Student: A Course in Braille Music Reading'' and ''An Introduction to the Piano for the Blind Student''.

'''Depression glass''' is clear or colored translucent machine made glassware that was distributed free, or at low cost, in the United States and Canada around the time of the [[Great Depression]]. 

==History==
Much depression glass is [[uranium glass]]. The [[Quaker Oats Company]], and other food manufacturers and distributors, put a piece of glassware in boxes of food, as an incentive to purchase. Some movie theaters and businesses handed out pieces to patrons.

Most of this glassware was made in the Ohio River Valley of the United States, where access to raw materials and power made manufacturing inexpensive in the first half of the twentieth century. More than twenty manufacturers made more than 100 patterns, and entire dinner sets were made in some patterns. Common colors are clear (crystal), pink, pale blue, green, and amber. Less common colors include yellow (canary), ultramarine, [[Jadeite (kitchenware)|jadeite]] (opaque pale green), delphite (opaque pale blue), cobalt blue, red (ruby and royal ruby), black, amethyst, monax, and white (milk glass).

Although of marginal quality, Depression glass has been highly collectible since the 1960s. Due to its popularity as a [[collectible]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/east-jefferson/index.ssf/2011/03/crescent_city_depression_glass.html|title=Crescent City Depression glass show to be held in Kenner|publisher=The Times-Picayune |date=March 17, 2011|accessdate=March 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is becoming more scarce on the open market. Rare pieces may sell for several hundred dollars. Some manufacturers continued to make popular patterns after World War II, or introduced similar patterns, which are also collectible. Popular and expensive patterns and pieces have been reproduced, and reproductions are still being made.

==Elegant glass==
Often confused with Depression glass is [[Elegant glass]], which is of much better quality. It was distributed through jewelry and department stores from the 1920s through the 1950s, and was an alternative to fine china. Most of the Elegant glassware manufacturers had closed by the end of the 1950s, when cheap glassware and imported china replaced Elegant glass. 

[[Image:Fostoriaplate.jpg|right|thumb|Fostoria plate]]

Some Elegant glass manufacturers were:
*[[Cambridge Glass Company]]
*[[Consolidated Lamp and Glass Company]]
*[[Duncan Miller Glass Company]]
*[[Fenton Art Glass Company]]
*[[Fostoria Glass Company]]
*[[Heisey Glass Company]]
*[[Imperial Glass Company]]

'''Desakota''' is a term used in [[urban geography]] used to describe areas in the extended surroundings of large cities, in which urban and agricultural forms of land use and settlement coexist and are intensively intermingled.

The term was coined by the urban researcher Terry McGee of the [[University of British Columbia]] around 1990. It comes from [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] ''desa'' "[[village]]" and kota "[[city]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Stephen |last=Cairns |title=Troubling Real-estate: Reflecting on Urban Form in Southeast Asia |work=Critical Reflections on Cities in Southeast Asia |year=2002 |page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Desakota areas typically occur in Asia, especially [[South East Asia]]. Examples can be found in the urbanised regions of [[Java]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Terry G. |last=McGee |title=Reconstructing ›The Southeast Asian City‹ in an Era of Volatile Globalization |work=Critical Reflections on Cities in Southeast Asia |year=2002 |pages=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; the densely populated, delta-shaped areas on the peripheries of the [[Jakarta]] agglomeration ("[[Jabodetabek]]"), but also the extended metropolitan regions of [[Bangkok]] or [[Manila]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=McGee |title=Reconstructing ›The Southeast Asian City‹ |year=2002 |pages=47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Desakota areas are situated outside the periurban zones, from which daily commuting is easily possible, i.e. more than 30 or 50&amp;nbsp;km off the city centre. They often sprawl alongside arterial and communication roads, sometimes from one agglomeration to the next. They are characterised by high population density and intensive agricultural use (especially [[Paddy field|wet-rice cultivation]]), but differ from densely populated rural areas by more urban-like characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=McGee |title=The Emergence of ''Desakota'' Regions in Asia. |year=1991 |pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; These criteria are: developed transport networks, high population mobility, increasing activity outside the agricultural sector, the coexistence of many different forms of land use, more female participation in paid labour, and unregulated land use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Chia |first1=Lin Sien |first2=Martin |last2=Perry |title=Introduction |work=Southeast Asia Transformed: A Geography of Change |publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies |place=Singapur |year=2003 |isbn=981-230-119-4 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given their rambling extent and indistinct boundaries, the emergence of Desakota regions brings difficulties for the administration, as uniform plans, regulations or designs are hardly viable. Desakota regions are characterised by high mobility of goods and services and rapid change in patterns of settlement. They usually elude the division in functually specialised zones that is conventionally applied in urban geography. Completely different forms of use, as e.g. traditional agriculture, large scale and cottage industry, amusement parks and golf courses, shopping centres and retail parks, and forms of settlement from [[shanty town]]s to [[gated community]] coexist in them close to each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Cairns |title=Troubling Real-estate |year=2002 |page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Duke Islamic Studies Center''', also known as '''DISC''', is an inter-departmental, cross-cultural center at [[Duke University]] dedicated to the study of [[Islam]] and [[Muslims]]. DISC is one of the leading institutions in North America for Islamic studies, approaching Islam as a global religion with many distinctive historical and cultural expressions. Duke’s tradition of strong humanistic approaches to the study of Islam and Muslims scholarship is complimented by emerging strength in social science approaches to Islamic Studies.

Established in 2006 as a sequel to the Center for the Study of Muslim Networks, the Duke Islamic Studies Center (DISC) continues to foreground Muslim networks, especially educational networks, as essential instruments for advancing cross-cultural understanding.

==Faculty Leadership==
Duke Islamic Studies Center is led by Professor [[Omid Safi]], a prominent Islamic studies professor who received his bachelor of arts, master's and doctorate degrees from Duke. Prior to accepting this position, he was a professor of Islamic studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Safi has also been a frequent speaker on Islam in popular media, including in The New York Times, Al Jazeera, The Washington Post, BBC, NPR, NBC and international media. He also is active on social media and as a blogger, is a lead Islam writer for the Huffington Post, and his column “What Would Muhammad Do?” (http://omidsafi.religionnews.com) has been a regular Religion News Service feature.

Other prominent faculty leadership include Abdullah Antepli (Chief Representative for Muslim Affairs), and Jen'nan Read (Assistant Director of Special Initiatives).

Other core faculty include:

==Projects and Initiatives==
In addition to putting on a full slate of programs and events each semester, the Duke Islamic Studies Center sponsors special initiatives that reflect emerging leadership priorities and faculty interests.

Our most recent and most ambitious initiative is the Transcultural Islam Project. This multi-year project was launched in July 2011 with funding support from the Carnegie Corporation. This initiative has two overarching goals: 1) to inform public discourse and policy by publicizing and promoting scholarly and research-based information about Islam and Muslims; 2) to support scholarship and scholarly collaborations to advance research about Islam and Muslims across the globe.

Both of these initiatives were funded by the Social Science Research Council.

The '''Earth Summits''' are [[decennial]] meetings of world leaders, organized since 1972 with help of the [[United Nations]], to help defining ways to stimulate sustainable development at the global level.  The aim is to bring together the best individuals and organisations humanity can bring forward from all kind of categories of life, to identify and update what are humanity's most pressing challenges, to quantify them, identify solutions and develop a plan of action not to run into a wall.  This plan of action is called [[Agenda 21]] and implemented by many local governments under the name [[Local Agenda 21]].  The plan of action is designed as a TQM - [[Total Quality Manual]], designed smartly and open enough, so that also organisations, companies and individuals can use it as a basis for their own [[plan of action]] and guidance not to miss out on important issue; it helps speed up understanding and identifying partners by e.g. using similar wordings and symbols.  The 2000-2015 [[Millennium Development Goals]] and the 2015-2030 [[Global Goals]] are results from these Earth Summits.  The first summit took place in [[Stockholm]] ([Sweden]) in 1972, the second in [[Nairobi]] ([[Kenya]]) in 1982, the third in [[Rio de Janeiro]] ([[Brazil]]) in 1992 and the fourth in [[Johannesburg]] ([[South Africa]]) in 2002. Last Earth Summit, called [[Rio+20]], also took place in Rio de Janeiro in 2012.

Evidence of the development of a global culture of respect for the environment, the Earth Summits are symbolically very important as - together with the [[United Nations Observances]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un.org/en/sections/observances/united-nations-observances/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;[[Calendar]] - they aim to demonstrate the collective capacity to manage, address and bring attention to humanities most pressing challenges, global problems and affirm the need to respect ecological constraints.  The 1972 summit gave birth to the United Nations Environment Program ([[UNEP]]), while the 1992 Summit launched the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ([[UNFCCC]]), whose signatory countries have met annually since 1995.

== Procedure == 
The entry into force of an [[international treaty]] usually takes several years. This is a complex process as each country needs to complete two steps to join: signing the treaty, and then ratifying it formally. The treaty enters into force only when a sufficient number of countries have ratified it (the number varies from one treaty to another).

The signatory countries of this type of treaty organize, roughly once a year, a [[conference of the parties]] (COP). Before each conference there is a preparatory meeting called the Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTTA) where governments negotiate the technical details of the treaty. The process is similar for the Earth Summit, which includes a series of preparatory pre-conferences.

== List of Earth Summits ==
# 1972 - The United Nations Conference on the Human Environment ([[UNCHS]]) in [[Stockholm]]
# 1982 - The 1982 Earth Summit in [[Nairobi]] ([[Kenya]]). An Earth Summit was held in Nairobi, Kenya, from 10 to 18 May 1982. The events of the time (Cold War) and the disinterest of US President Ronald Reagan (who appointed his delegated daughter Of the United States) made this summit a failure. It is not even mentioned as an official Earth Summit.
# 1992 - The [[Earth Summit|United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] ([[UNCED]]) in [[Rio de Janeiro]] ([[Brazil]]) 
# 2002 - The World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in [[Johannesburg]] ([[South Africa]]) 
# 2012 - The United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development ([[UNCSD]]) or [[Rio+20]], also took place in  [[Rio de Janeiro]] ([[Brazil]])

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4973">The '''European Design Awards''', also known as the ED-Awards, are annual awards presented to European designers for outstanding work in the communication design field. The ED-Awards is a joint initiative of design magazines from across Europe and endorsed by&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ico-d.org/connect/events/events/836.php ico-D endorsed events]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Icograda|International Council of Design]].
The ED-Awards are judged by a panel of representatives (journalists and design critics) from fifteen European design magazines, while the winning submissions are featured in the ED-Awards Catalogue.

==Model==
The ED-Awards is different than other design awards schemes in the way that the jury comprises not of peers (designers), but of design journalists and critics – people who see and judge work for a living.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eyemagazine.com/blog/post/european-design-still-exploring Eye Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;
Further more, since the ED-Awards organisation is made up of design magazines, it provides an opportunity for everyone submitting work, to have it featured in a number of these media. A lot of stories and articles are being created through the submitted work every year.&lt;ref&gt;Pool, #21 March 2012, {{ISSN|0976-1659}}, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jury==

The jury consists of fifteen representatives from high-profile European design magazines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europeandesign.org/ed-awards/jury/ Jury]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European Software Institute''' (ESI) is a division of [[Tecnalia]] with its headquarters in Spain.

One of the early "products" of the institute was a methodology for analyzing and improving processes in software-producing organisations which then became a standard [[ISO/IEC 15504]] with the popular name "SPICE". This standard was the European "answer" to the [[Capability Maturity Model Integration]] (CMMI)  methodology having been developed at the [[Software Engineering Institute]] at Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, US, which today is an institute being in "co-optition" with ESI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sei.cmu.edu/partners/esi/ | title=European Software Institute | publisher=SEI | accessdate=August 4, 2012}}

'''Feminist epistemology''' is an examination of the subject matter of [[epistemology]] from a [[feminist]] standpoint. [[Elizabeth S. Anderson|Elizabeth Anderson]] describes feminist epistemology as being concerned with the way in which [[gender]] influences our concept of knowledge and "practices of inquiry and justification".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Anderson | first = Elizabeth S. | author-link = Elizabeth S. Anderson | contribution = Feminist epistemology and philosophy of science | editor-last = Zalta | editor-first = Edward N. | editor-link = Edward N. Zalta |title = The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2004 Edition) | year = 2004 | url = http://stanford.library.usyd.edu.au/archives/sum2004/entries/feminism-epistemology/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally regarded as falling under the umbrella of [[social epistemology]].

==Overview==
Feminist epistemology emphasizes how important ethical and political values are in shaping epistemic practices, and interpretations of evidence. Feminist epistemology studies how gender influences our understanding of knowledge, justification and theory of knowledge; it describes how knowledge and justification disadvantage women. Scientists of feminist epistemology claim that knowledge discriminate women by: preventing them from inquiry and presenting women as an inferior, because these theories of knowledge satisfy only male interests, which strengthen gender hierarchies.&lt;ref name="Young 1990"&gt;{{Citation | last = Young | first = I. M. | contribution = Throwing like a girl and other essays in feminist political theory. |title = Bloomington: Indiana University Press  | year = 1990 | url = https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-epistemology/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The central idea of feminist epistemology is that knowledge reflects the particular perspectives of the theory. The main interest of feminist philosophers is how gender stereotypes situate knowing subjects. They approach this interest from three different perspectives: feminist standpoint theory, feminist postmodernism, and feminist empiricism. Standpoint theory defines a specific social perspective as epistemically privileged. Feminist postmodernism emphasizes the instability of the social identity explorers and therefore their representations. Empiricism focuses on combining the main ideas of feminism and their observations to prove feministic theories through evidence.&lt;ref name="Young 1990"/&gt;

Elizabeth Anderson argues that the concept of [[situated knowledge]] is central to feminist epistemology. [[Donna Haraway]] asserts that most knowledge (in particular academic knowledge) is always situated and "produced by positioned actors working in/between all kinds of locations, working up/on/through all kinds of research relation(ships)" (Cook, ''et al.''),&lt;ref&gt;Ian Cook, 'Positionality/Situated Knowledge'  for David Sibley ''et al.'' (eds)''Critical Concepts in Cultural Geography''. London, IB: Taurus http://www.gees.bham.ac.uk/downloads/gesdraftpapers/iancook-situatedknowledge.pdf  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925160741/http://www.gees.bham.ac.uk/downloads/gesdraftpapers/iancook-situatedknowledge.pdf |date=September 25, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus what is known and the ways in which this knowledge can be known is subject to the position—the situation and perspective—of the knower.

The English feminist philosopher [[Miranda Fricker]] has argued that in addition to social or political injustices, there can be [[epistemic injustice|''epistemic'' injustices]] in two forms: testimonial injustice and hermeneutical injustice. ''Testimonial injustice'' consists in prejudices that cause one to "give a deflated level of credibility to a speaker's word":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Miranda Fricker|title=Epistemic Injustice: Power and the Ethics of Knowing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gztTPgAACAAJ|accessdate=8 March 2011|date=August 2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-957052-2|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fricker gives the example of a woman who due to her gender is not believed in a business meeting. She may make a good case, but prejudice causes the listeners to believe her arguments to be less competent or sincere and thus less believable. In this kind of case, Fricker argues that as well as there being an injustice caused by possible outcomes (such as the speaker missing a promotion at work), there is a testimonial injustice: "a kind of injustice in which someone is ''wronged specifically in her capacity as a knower''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Miranda Fricker|title=Epistemic Injustice: Power and the Ethics of Knowing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gztTPgAACAAJ|accessdate=8 March 2011|date=August 2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-957052-2|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of ''hermeneutical injustice'', "speakers' knowledge claims fall into lacunae in the available conceptual resources, thus blocking their capacity to interpret, and thence to understand or claim a hearing for their experiences."&lt;ref&gt;Lorraine Code, 2008. [https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/23398-epistemic-injustice-power-and-the-ethics-of-knowing/ Review of Epistemic Injustice.]&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, when the language of '[[sexual harassment]]' or '[[homophobia]]' were not generally available, those who experienced these wrongs lacked the resources to make a claim to being wronged in morally relevant ways.

The philosopher [[Susan Haack]] is a notable critic of feminist epistemology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Susan |last=Haack|authorlink=Susan Haack|title=Manifesto of a Passionate Moderate: Unfashionable Essays |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2ezeTXOlQngC |year=2000 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-31137-1 |origyear=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Lynn Hankinson Nelson|title=The Very Idea of Feminist Epistemology|jstor=3810236|journal=Hypatia|volume=10|number=3|pages=31–49|year=1995|doi=10.1111/j.1527-2001.1995.tb00736.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sandra Harding]] organized feminist epistemology into three categories: feminist empiricism, standpoint epistemology, and post-modern epistemology.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Doucet, A., &amp; Mauthner, N. (2006). Feminist methodologies and epistemology. ''Handbook of 21st Century Sociology. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage'', 36-45.
&lt;/ref&gt; While potentially a limited set of categories, post-modern feminism was a transitional ideology that denounced absolute objectivity and asserted the death of the meta-narrative.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While these three categories of feminist epistemology have their place in history (see [[feminist empiricism]], [[standpoint feminism]], [[postmodern feminism]]), as ideological frameworks they hold epistemic insights in contemporary feminist method. Feminist theorist [[Nina Lykke]], has expanded upon these three categories to include "''postmodern feminist (anti-)epistemology''...[and]...''postconstructionist feminist epistemology''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=j7THBQAAQBAJ&amp;dq=nina+lykke+feminist+epistemology&amp;lr=|title=Feminist Studies: A Guide to Intersectional Theory, Methodology and Writing|last=Lykke|first=Nina|date=2010-04-05|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781136978982|location=|pages=126|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Feminist empiricism ==
Feminist empiricism emerged from a feminist critique that gave attention to male bias in positivistic practices of science.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 2nd Wave feminist researchers identified how quantification and objectivity, as facets of positivism, have been held as the “gold standard” for social and political science research.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hughes | first1 = C. | last2 = Cohen | first2 = R. L. | year = 2010 | title = Feminists really do count: The complexity of feminist methodologies | url = | journal = International Journal of Social Research Methodology | volume = 13 | issue = 3| pages = 189–196 | doi = 10.1080/13645579.2010.482249 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Quantification, and its political relationships to notions of objectivity, maintains methodological dominance and preference primarily in the United States.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This is perpetuated by how funding authorities tend to prioritize quantitative research with positivist frameworks.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Feminist empiricists believe in the concept of positivism; that all knowledge can be understood objectively and can be accessed through empirical research.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Hesse-Biber, S. N. &amp; Leavy, P. L. (2007). Feminist empiricism: challenging gender bias and “setting the record straight”. In Hesse-Biber, S. N. &amp; Leavy, P. L. ''Feminist research practice'' (pp. 26-52). : SAGE Publications Ltd doi: 10.4135/9781412984270.n2
&lt;/ref&gt; They assert that pre-feminist positivism was actually not objective at all, since traditional positivism’s ‘androcentric bias’ led to only partial or ‘subjective’ knowledge of the world.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In essence, all empirical inquiry is inherently skewed by value judgments and biased interpretation of evidence by male-biased authorities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For instance, it was not until retrieving statistical data on the prevalence of women in the workplace experiencing (what is now known to be) ‘sexual harassment’ through surveys in the 1970s that sexual harassment became identified by political authorities as a commonality.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Without this intervention of feminists in an empirical field, this commonality would never have been identified as an issue, since males had no reason to pursue this phenomenon.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Londa Schiebinger further asserts that empirical research “embodies many core feminist values”, in that feminist empiricists are actively seeking out and eliminating exploitative research whilst resisting strategic, oppressive explanations of data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schiebinger | first1 = L | year = 2003 | title = Introduction: Feminism inside the sciences | url = | journal = Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society | volume = 28 | issue = 3| pages = 859–886 | doi=10.1086/345319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist empiricism is critiqued for its belief that “objectivity” is best achieved through quantification, whether or not viewed through a feminist lens or utilized for feminist ideals.  The division between quantitative and qualitative data has historically reinforced gendered dichotomies of “hard/soft, emotional/rational, worthy/worthless”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Many assert that ‘objective truth’ is a false concept, and thus feminist empiricists may overestimate the extent to which they can increase objectivity.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Bart, J. (1998, January 19). Feminist Theories of Knowledge: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. Retrieved October, from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.dean.sbc.edu/bart.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, positivism and quantitative research has been critiqued as a “detached” philosophical framework that inherently objectifies its research subjects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Feminist empiricists respond to the problem of value-neutrality by lengthening Quine's argument: theory is not determined by evidence. Any observation counts as proof for
particular thesis only if connected with certain background presumptions, because similar observation might support different hypotheses. In daily life, scientists face some restrictions in selecting the background assumptions, that are based on cognitive values like simplicity and conservatism, which a political and social philosophy that is based on retaining traditional social establishments. Feminist empiricists state that no logical or methodological principle categorically prohibits scientists from choosing their background assumptions as their political and social values or other interests. Therefore, feminist scientists may select their background presumptions on account of their opinions on some feminist values.&lt;ref name="Young 1990"/&gt;

=== Two paradoxes ===
There are two central paradoxes with feminist empiricism

'''The paradoxes of bias''' 
The first paradox is that many feminist empiricists advocate for exposing the androcentric and sexist biases in scientific research, namely that people have a bias towards gender difference and sexuality.  However, while feminist empiricists would claim that the feminist inquiry helps the development of science, their own perspective adopts certain bias about gender and science.&lt;ref name="Young 1990"/&gt;

'''The paradox of social construction'''
The second paradox is about many science criticisms expose that the scientific inquiry is influenced by both social and political factors.The theories of androcentric and sexist are influenced by the most society are what they advocate, which can be understood as in order to eliminate the bias, the term like “ individualist epistemology” would be used.  However, they want scientific to be open to different social influences, which the bias of female is also a part of social influence.&lt;ref name="Young 1990"/&gt;

'''Criticism of empiricism theory:''' It is the most criticized theory by others, for its assumptions that transhistorical subject of knowledge exists outside of social determination ([[Sandra Harding|Harding]] 1990). Also feminist empiricism theory states that science will correct all the biases and errors in theories about women and other groups by itself.&lt;ref name="Young 1990"/&gt;

== Standpoint epistemology ==
At a basic level, standpoint epistemology asserts that marginalized groups such as women are bestowed with an “epistemic privilege”, where there exists the potential for less distorted understandings of the world than dominant groups, such as men.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This methodology presents many new ideas to the Feminist Empiricist notion that androcentric dominance and bias presents an incomplete understanding of the world.  A “standpoint” is not so much about a subject’s biased perspective, but instead the ‘realities’ that structure social relationships of power.

Standpoint theories portray the universe from a concrete situated perspective. Every standpoint theory must specify: the  social location from the  feminist perspective, the  scope of its privileges, the social role and the identity that generates knowledge and the justification of these privileges. Feminist standpoint theory states a privilege in gender relations, various feminist standpoint theories are based on the statement about the epistemic privilege in different feministic situations. Feminist standpoint theory is one of the types of critical theory, their main intention is to improve their situation. In order to achieve this critical aim, social theories must represent the understanding of feministic problems and try to improve their condition. Critical theory is theory of, by, and for the subjects of study. Feminism and feminist epistemology is all about inquiry, assumptions, and theories. Through these methods feminist epistemology overcomes the tension between bias on which feminist empiricism is based on.&lt;ref name="Young 1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Harding, S. (1996). Borderlands Epistemologies. In A. Ross (ed.), ''Science wars''. Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press 331-340.  &lt;nowiki&gt;https://femmethodsuwyo.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/hardingborderlandsepist.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; It presents an elaborate map or method for maximizing “strong objectivity” in natural and social science,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; yet does not necessarily focus on encouraging positivistic scientific practices, like is central to Feminist Empiricism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Although standpoint epistemology has been critiqued for focusing too closely on a distinctive women’s perspective which may render invisible concepts of historically and sociologically variable knowledge,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Harding strongly asserts that standpoint epistemology does not essentialize any particular marginalized identity.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Harding further argues that the methodology does not subscribe to notions of “maximizing neutrality” between groups in an effort to maximize objectivity, but instead recognizes that the power relations between groups are what complicate these relationships.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This is in some ways contrary to Doucet’s assertion&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; that the controversy of ''how'' power influenced knowledge production is a post-standpoint, more contemporary debate. Standpoint epistemology also poses a necessity to ask critical questions about the lives and social institutions created by dominant groups; where the field becomes a sociology ''for'' women and not solely ''about'' women.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In practicality, standpoint theory has widespread use as "a philosophy of knowledge, a philosophy of science, a sociology of knowledge, a moral/political advocacy of the expansion of democratic rights".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Although it has been asserted that “epistemic privilege” is inherent to marginalized groups,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Harding poses standpoint theory as an explanatory means for both marginalized and dominant group individuals to be able to achieve liberatory perspectives.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In building her standpoint epistemology, Sandra Harding used and built on the work of philosophers of science [[Thomas Kuhn]] and [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Willard Quine]]. Harding's standpoint theory is also grounded in Marxism, although she largely rejected Marxism for it's portrayal of women in merely class terms.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pinnick|first=Cassandra L.|date=1994|title=Feminist Epistemology: Implications for Philosophy of Science|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/188340|journal=Philosophy of Science|volume=61|issue=4|pages=646–657}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'', Kuhn argued that scientific progress does not occur through gradual accumulation of correct ideas. Rather, he believed that there were occasionally large revolutions that completely overturned the previous scientific theories. When a crisis occurs within the prevailing theory of a time, revolutionary scientists will challenge them and build new scientific theories. For example, in his view, the transition from the geocentrism of Ptolemy to the heliocentric theory of Copernicus did not occur through a gradual series of challenges and improvements to the previous model. Rather, it was a sudden and complete revolution because it is impossible to conceptualize the theory of heliocentrism within the dominant geocentric theory. Kuhn argued that together, the ideas of Newton, Galileo, and Kepler completed the revolution that Copernicus started. However, most students of science do not learn of the many failed and alternative scientific paradigms. They are taught a version of the history of science where progress is guaranteed and linear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, 4th Edition|last=Kuhn|first=Thomas|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2012|isbn=9780226458120|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Harding’s view, Kuhn’s theories showed that all science was situated within its historical context, and that any theory could remain accepted if its believers held power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=HARDING|first=SANDRA|date=1992|title=After the Neutrality Ideal: Science, Politics, and "Strong Objectivity"|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/40970706|journal=Social Research|volume=59|issue=3|pages=567–587}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Criticism of standpoint theory:''' Philosopher [[Helen Longino]] is against standpoint theory, because she claims that standpoint theory can not provide the knowledge of which standpoints have the most privilege. Bar On (1993) said that if feminine ethics of care provides privileged perspective on morality, then our moral knowledge is convinced only by existence of gender relations. Bar On also claims that theory which explains structural relationship between advanced and less developed, which dictates epistemic privilege can not be applied to women. [[Marx]] claimed that class conflict derives other conflicts such as racism, sexism, national and religious conflicts.

Feminist epistemology is criticized by different philosophers. Feminist postmodernists blame feminist empiricists for assuming the existence of an individual and for admitting an uncritical concept of experience. Naturalized Quine epistemology of some feminist empiricists perceives knowers as socially situated; Hundleby, a standpoint theorist, criticizes feminist empiricism for disregarding the key role of women in political activities.&lt;ref name="Young 1990"/&gt;

Standpoint theory is often criticized for the lack of evidence available to support it and the ideas underlying it, such as the lack of justification for the [[underdetermination]] theory Harding uses. Pinnick, to illustrate her point about Harding's poor evidence, points to standpoint theory’s claim that science is more objective if it is politically motivated, which Pinnick claims runs contrary to what has happened in the past when scientists deliberately injected politics into their theories (she cites eugenics and intelligence test designs as examples of politicized science). She also criticizes Harding for claiming that marginalized groups produce better, less biased scientific results because, according to Pinnick, Harding fails to provide any empirical evidence for this idea.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Post-modernism ==
Post-modern thought marks a feminist group shift away from dominant, positivistic ideals of objectivity and universal understanding.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Instead, it acknowledges a diversity of unique human perspectives, none of which can claim absolute knowledge authority.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Post-Modern feminism has thus been critiqued for having a relativist-stance, where ongoing power relations between key identities have been often neglected attention.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It is possible to see this political stance in direct opposition to the “emancipatory aspirations” of women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, [[Saba Mahmood]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mahmood | first1 = S | year = 2001 | title = Feminist Theory, Embodiment, and the Docile Agent: Some Reflections on the Egyptian Islamic Revival | url = | journal = Cultural Anthropology | volume = 16 | issue = 2| pages = 202–236 | doi = 10.1525/can.2001.16.2.202 }}&lt;/ref&gt; would argue this critique is in some ways oppositional to global understandings of female desire, where the idea of ‘freedom’ is an essential, conditionally oppressive component to western feminism which may wrongly assume that women of eastern countries dominated by male power are victims needing to be liberated.

[[Donna Haraway]], a post-modern feminist, shows how post-modern feminism recognizes positivism as an inherently oppressive ideology, where science’s rhetoric of truth was used to undermine marginalized people’s agency and delegitimize ‘embodied’ accounts of truth.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Haraway | first1 = D | year = September–October 1988 | title = Situated Knowledges: The Science Question in Feminism and the Privilege of Partial Perspective | url = https://philpapers.org/rec/HARSKT| journal = Feminist Studies | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 575–599 | doi = 10.2307/3178066 | jstor = 3178066 | format = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, they argue that ‘objectivity’ is an external, disembodied point of view left only to privileged (unmarked bodies), because marginalized (marked bodies) cannot have perspectives dissociated from ‘who they are’.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Despite post-modern relativist criticism,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; this theory resists relativism in firmly recognizing power relations in that objectivity is a privilege of unmarked bodies. Haraway’s theory of “situated knowledges” holds true to post-modern ideology, where knowledge should be placed in context; this creates a more limited range of knowledge than theoretical “objectivity”, but is richer in allowing for exchange of understanding between individual experiences.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Positivism inherently gives way to authoritarian positions of knowledge which hinder discussion and render limited understanding of the world.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Both positivist science and relativism have been recognized as contrary to post-modern feminist thought, since both minimize the significance of context (geographic, demographic, power) on knowledge claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Collins | first1 = P. H. | year = 1990 | title = Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness, and the Politics of Empowerment | url = | journal = Contemporary Sociology | volume = 21 | issue = 1| pages = 221–238 | doi = 10.2307/2074808 | jstor = 2074808 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Criticism of postmodernism:''' Key features of postmodernism: “Women” not the category of analysis and contains of perspectives which are controversial with feminist theory. The fact that women are in different social position can experience sexism differently, does not mean that they do not suffer from it ([[MacKinnon]] 2000). The postmodernism theory dissolves all groups, and supports the ideas that knowledge from any source is  better than no knowledge at all ([[Susan Bordo|Bordo]] 1990).&lt;ref name="Young 1990"/&gt;

=== Theory in the flesh ===
Post-modern feminism’s assertion of “situated knowledges”,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; plays well into [[Cherríe Moraga|Cherrie Moraga]]’s piece “Theory in the Flesh”, where the ‘physical realities’ of indigenous peoples’ lives are said to be the means of creating a decolonial politic against oppressive, inaccessible, Eurowestern academic methods of knowledge production.&lt;ref&gt;Moraga, C., &amp; Anzaldúa, G. (1983). Theory in the Flesh. In ''This bridge called my back: Writings by radical women of color''. New York: Kitchen Table, Women of Color Press. 23.
&lt;/ref&gt; This epistemological framework has been utilized by feminists like [[bell hooks]], who claims that theorizing is often tied to a process of self-recovery and collective liberation; it is not thus limited to those in the western academic realm, nor does it require ‘scientific’ research.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Hooks, B. (1994). Theory as a Liberatory Practice. In ''Teaching to transgress: Education as the practice of freedom''. New York: Routledge.
&lt;/ref&gt; Hooks asserts that theory and practical application of emancipatory politics can, and often do, exist simultaneously and reciprocally.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Post-Modern feminism has given way to the question of whether or not there should be any particular feminist ways of knowing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A 'theory in the flesh' seems to suggest that prioritizing or normalizing any specific feminist epistemology would in itself be, and has been, oppressive.

=== Feminist epistemic virtue theory ===
This theory focuses on how power and gender relations behave in terms of value theory and epistemology. [[Susan Bordo|Bordo]]’s (1990) and [[Genevieve Lloyd|Lloyd]]’s (1984) examined how “maleness” and “femaleness” are used in philosophical theories and discussions about relationship such as, reason/unreason, reason/emotion and objectivity/subjectivity. [[Lorraine Code]]’s (1987, 1991, 1995, 1996) with other feminist co-workers determined in which ways political and social routine shapes our identities and perspectives of our world and especially gender, how it leads to understanding of epistemic responsibility. Code’s works also have been influential in epistemological fields, which can be described as version of naturalism takes and reinvents simple and uncontroversial empirical beliefs, for example the belief like “I know that I am seeing a bird”, deforms the epistemic animal nature. Feminist epistemic virtue theorists rejects almost all the assumptions. Skeptical problems can not get any connections with it, so it is ignored and considered as a pseudo-problem.&lt;ref&gt;Feminist Epistemology. (n.d.). Retrieved February 9, 2017 from Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy: http://www.iep.utm.edu/fem-epis/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feminist science criticism and feminist science==

=== Feminist science criticism: bias as error ===
Feminist science criticism mainly has five different kinds of research about gender and science to address five identified biases.  These are studies of how:
* Exclusion or marginalization of women scientists impair scientific progress.
* Applications of science and technology disadvantage women and other vulnerable groups and treat their interests as less important.
* Science has ignored women and gender, and how turning attention to these issues may require revisions of accepted theories.
* Biases toward working with “masculine” cognitive styles (and in some cases even the words related to them) that may — through limiting, partial, or incomplete perspective — lead to errors of omission or unjustified conclusions.
* Research into sex differences that reinforces sex stereotypes and sexist practices fail to live up to standards of good science.&lt;ref name="Young 1990"/&gt;

=== Feminist science: bias as resource ===

Feminist science argues that the inquiry of science which informed by feminist epistemology is based on legalizing and produce the limiting partial bias.
Pluralist feminist scientists and philosophers of science define feminist science as preferred content and “feminine” method.&lt;ref name="Young 1990"/&gt;

==History==
The Institute was founded in 1986 by author [[Christine Peterson]],&lt;ref name="oliver" /&gt; who still serves on the Board of Directors. Other founding members include [[molecular nanotechnology]] proponent [[K. Eric Drexler]] as president, and space entrepreneur [[James C. Bennett]]. Drexler's book, [[Engines of Creation]], was one of the institute's founding documents. Many of its initial members came from the [[L5 Society]]. It was first intended as a smaller, more focused group than L5, but grew rapidly and reached a few thousand members shortly afterwards.&lt;ref name="McCray"&gt;{{cite book|last1=McCray|first1=W. Patrick|title=The visioneers: how a group of elite scientists pursued space colonies, nanotechnologies, and a limitless future|date=2012|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|location=Princeton|isbn=0691139830}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its early days, it was largely responsible for promoting the concept of nanotechnology, before the idea became widespread among researchers.

==Workshops==

The Institute carries out yearly workshops, attended primarily by scientists, engineers, and students. The subject matter matches molecular nanotechnology and its close relative, [[atomically precise manufacturing]] with other transformative technologies, such as energy efficiency, artificial intelligence, programmable matter, and medical applications. In 2016, the Institute initiated the first of a promised series of “Great Debates” on various technical, existential and ethical subjects related to impending outcomes of [[transformative research]] and technologies.

The '''''Foundation'' series''' is a [[science fiction]] book series written by American author [[Isaac Asimov]]. For nearly thirty years, the series was a trilogy: ''[[Foundation (Asimov novel)|Foundation]]'', ''[[Foundation and Empire]]'', and ''[[Second Foundation]]''. It won the one-time [[Hugo Award]] for "Best All-Time Series" in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1966-hugo-awards/| title=1966 Hugo Awards| publisher=[[Hugo Award]]| website=thehugoawards.org| accessdate=July 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nesfa.org/data/LL/Hugos/hugos1966.html| title=The Long List of Hugo Awards, 1966| accessdate=July 28, 2017| publisher=[[New England Science Fiction Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asimov began adding to the series in 1981, with two sequels: ''[[Foundation's Edge]]'', ''[[Foundation and Earth]]'', and two prequels: ''[[Prelude to Foundation]]'', ''[[Forward the Foundation]]''. The additions made reference to events in Asimov's [[Robot series (Asimov)|''Robot'']] and [[Galactic Empire (series)|''Empire'' series]], indicating that they were also set in the same fictional universe.

The premise of the series is that the mathematician [[Hari Seldon]] spent his life developing a branch of mathematics known as [[psychohistory (fictional)|psychohistory]], a concept of [[mathematical sociology]]. Using the laws of [[mass action (sociology)|mass action]], it can predict the future, but only on a large scale. Seldon foresees the imminent fall of the [[Galactic Empire (Isaac Asimov)|Galactic Empire]], which encompasses the entire [[Milky Way]], and a [[Dark Ages (historiography)|dark age]] lasting 30,000 years before a second great empire arises. Seldon's calculations also show there is a way to limit this interregnum to just one thousand years. To ensure the more favorable outcome and reduce human misery during the intervening period, Seldon creates the Foundation – a group of talented artisans and engineers positioned at the twinned extreme ends of the galaxy – to preserve and expand on humanity's collective knowledge, and thus become the foundation for the accelerated resurgence of this new galactic empire.

==Publication history==

===Original stories===
The original trilogy of novels were originally a series of eight short stories published in ''[[Astounding Magazine]]'' between May 1942 and January 1950. According to Asimov, the premise was based on ideas set forth in [[Edward Gibbon]]'s ''[[History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'', and was invented spontaneously on his way to meet with editor [[John W. Campbell]], with whom he developed the concepts of the collapse of the [[Galactic Empire (Asimov)|Galactic Empire]], the civilization-preserving Foundations, and psychohistory.&lt;ref&gt;Asimov, Isaac. La edad de oro II. Plaza &amp; Janes. 1987. P 252–253 (Spanish language translation of [[The Early Asimov]]) See afterword for the "Legal Rites" story.&lt;/ref&gt; Asimov wrote these early stories in his [[West Philadelphia]] apartment when he worked at the [[Philadelphia Naval Yard]].

===''Foundation'' trilogy===
The first four stories were collected, along with a new story taking place before the others, as a [[fixup]] published by [[Gnome Press]] in 1951 as ''[[Foundation (Isaac Asimov novel)|Foundation]]''. The remainder of the stories were published in pairs by Gnome as ''[[Foundation and Empire]]'' (1952) and ''[[Second Foundation]]'' (1953), resulting in the "Foundation Trilogy", as the series is still known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=ISAAC ASIMOV |title=Foundation's Edge |publisher=Spectra |location=Halmstad |year=1982 |page=1 |isbn=0-553-29338-9 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later sequels and prequels===
In 1981, Asimov was persuaded by his publishers to write a fourth book, which became ''[[Foundation's Edge]]'' (1982).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=ISAAC ASIMOV |title=Foundation and Earth |publisher=Spectra |location=Halmstad |year= |pages= |isbn=0-553-58757-9 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four years later, Asimov followed up with yet another sequel, ''[[Foundation and Earth]]'' (1986), which was followed by the prequels ''[[Prelude to Foundation]]'' (1988) and ''[[Forward the Foundation]]'' (1993), published after his death in 1992. During the two-year lapse between writing the sequels and prequels, Asimov had tied in his ''Foundation'' series with his various other series, creating a single unified universe. The basic link is mentioned in ''Foundation's Edge'': an obscure tradition about a first wave of space settlements with robots and then a second without. The idea is the one developed in ''[[Robots of Dawn]]'', which, in addition to showing the way that the second wave of settlements were to be allowed, illustrates the benefits and shortcomings of the first wave of settlements and their so-called ''[[carbon|C]]/[[iron|Fe]]'' (carbon/iron, signifying humans and robots together) culture. In this same book, the word ''psychohistory'' is used to describe the nascent idea of Seldon's work. Some of the drawbacks to this style of colonization, also called ''Spacer'' culture, are also exemplified by the events described in ''[[The Naked Sun]]''.

==Plot==

''Note: This plot is listed in the fictional chronological order of the stories in the series, which is not the order of publication. The series itself was left as a trilogy for many years, comprising "Foundation", "Foundation and Empire" and "Second Foundation". The two novels set chronologically earlier than the original trilogy, and the two which follow it, were later added to the series.''

===''Prelude to Foundation''===
{{main|Prelude to Foundation}}
''Prelude to Foundation'' opens on the planet [[Trantor]], the empire's capital planet, the day after [[Hari Seldon]] has given a speech at a mathematics conference. Several parties become aware of the content of his speech (that using mathematical formulas, it may be possible to predict the future course of human history). Seldon is hounded by the Emperor and various employed thugs who are working surreptitiously, which forces him into exile. Over the course of the book, Seldon and [[Dors Venabili]], a female companion and professor of history, are taken from location to location by [[Chetter Hummin]] who, under the guise of a reporter, introduces them to various Trantorian walks of life in his attempts to keep Seldon hidden from the Emperor.
Throughout their adventures all over Trantor, Seldon continuously denies that psychohistory is a realistic science. Even if feasible, it may take several decades to develop. Hummin, however, is convinced that Seldon knows something, so he continuously presses him to work out a starting point to develop psychohistory.
Eventually, after much traveling and introductions to various, diverse cultures on Trantor, Seldon realizes that using the entire known galaxy as a starting point is too overwhelming; he then decides to use Trantor as a model to work out the science, with a goal of later using the applied knowledge on the rest of the galaxy.

===''Forward the Foundation''===
{{main|Forward the Foundation}}
Eight years after the events of ''Prelude'', Seldon has worked out the science of psychohistory and has applied it on a galactic scale. His notability and fame increase and he is eventually promoted to First Minister to the Emperor. As the book progresses, Seldon loses those closest to him, including his wife, Dors Venabili, as his own health deteriorates into old age. Having worked his entire adult life to understand psychohistory, Seldon instructs his granddaughter, Wanda, to set up the Second Foundation.

===''Foundation''===
{{main|Foundation (Isaac Asimov novel)}}
Called forth to stand trial on Trantor for allegations of treason (for foreshadowing the decline of the Galactic Empire), Seldon explains that his science of psychohistory foresees many alternatives, all of which result in the Galactic Empire eventually falling. If humanity follows its current path, the Empire will fall and 30,000 years of turmoil will overcome humanity before a second Empire arises. However, an alternative path allows for the intervening years to be only one thousand, if Seldon is allowed to collect the most intelligent minds and create a compendium of all human knowledge, entitled ''[[Encyclopedia Galactica]]''. The board is still wary but allows Seldon to assemble whomever he needs, provided he and the "Encyclopedists" be exiled to a remote planet, [[Terminus (planet)|Terminus]]. Seldon agrees to these terms – and also secretly establishes a second Foundation of which almost nothing is known, which he says is at the "opposite end" of the galaxy.

After fifty years on Terminus, and with Seldon now deceased, the inhabitants find themselves in a crisis. With four powerful planets surrounding their own, the Encyclopedists have no defenses but their own intelligence. At the same time, a vault left by Seldon is due to automatically open. The vault reveals a pre-recorded [[hologram]] of Seldon, who informs the Encyclopedists that their entire reason for being on Terminus is a fraud, insofar as Seldon did not actually care whether or not an encyclopedia was created, only that the population was placed on Terminus and the events needed by his calculations were set in motion. In reality, the recording discloses, Terminus was set up to reduce the dark ages from 30,000 years to just one millennium, based on following his calculations. It will develop by facing intermittent and extreme "crises" – known as "Seldon Crises" – which the laws governing psychohistory show will inevitably be overcome, simply because human nature will cause events to fall in particular ways which lead to the intended goal. The recording reveals that the present events are the first such crisis, reminds them that a second foundation was also formed at the "opposite end" of the galaxy, and then falls silent.

The Mayor of Terminus City, [[Salvor Hardin]], proposes to play the planets against each other. His plan is a success; the Foundation remains untouched, and he is promoted to Mayor of Terminus (the planet). Meanwhile, the minds of the Foundation continue to develop newer and greater technologies which are smaller and more powerful than the Empire's equivalents. Using its scientific advantage, Terminus develops trade routes with nearby planets, eventually taking them over when its technology becomes a much-needed commodity. The interplanetary traders effectively become the new diplomats to other planets. One such trader, [[Hober Mallow]], becomes powerful enough to challenge and win the seat of Mayor and, by cutting off supplies to a nearby region, also succeeds in adding more planets to the Foundation's reach.

===''Foundation and Empire''===
{{main|Foundation and Empire}}
An ambitious general of the current Emperor of the Galaxy perceives the Foundation as a growing threat and orders an attack on it, using the Empire's still-mighty fleet of war vessels. The Emperor, initially supportive, becomes suspicious of his general's long-term motive for the attack, and recalls the fleet despite being close to victory. In spite of its undoubted inferiority in purely military terms, the Foundation emerges as the victor and the Empire itself is defeated. Seldon's hologram reappears in the vault on Terminus, and explains to the Foundation that this opening of the vault follows a conflict whose result was inevitable whatever might have been done – a weak Imperial navy could not have attacked them, while a strong navy would have shown itself by its successes to be a direct threat to the Emperor himself and been recalled.

A century later, an unknown outsider called the Mule has begun taking over planets belonging to the Foundation at a rapid pace. The Foundation comes to realize the Mule is a [[mutant]], unforeseen in Seldon's plan, and that the plan cannot have predicted any certainty of defeating him. [[Toran and Bayta Darell]], accompanied by [[Ebling Mis]] – the galaxy's current greatest psychologist – and a court jester familiar with the Mule named Magnifico (whom they agree to protect, as his life is under threat from the Mule himself), set out to find the Second Foundation, hoping to bring an end to the Mule's reign. Mis studies furiously in the Great Library of Trantor to decipher the Second Foundation's location in order to visit it and seek their help.  He is successful and also deduces that the Mule's success stems from his mutation; he is able to change the emotions of others, a power he used to first instill fear in the inhabitants of his conquered planets, then to make his enemies devoutly loyal to him. Mis is killed by Bayta Darell before he can reveal the location, having realised that Magnifico is in fact the Mule and has been using his gifts to drive Mis forward in his research, so that he can learn the location himself and subjugate the Second Foundation also. Dismayed at having made a mistake which allowed Bayta to see through his disguise, the Mule leaves Trantor to rule over his conquered planets while continuing his search.

===''Second Foundation''===
{{main|Second Foundation}}
As the Mule comes closer to finding it, the mysterious Second Foundation comes briefly out of hiding to face the threat directly. It consists of the descendants of Seldon's psychohistorians. While the first Foundation has developed the physical sciences, the Second Foundation has been developing Seldon's mathematics and the Seldon Plan, along with their own use of mental sciences. The Second Foundation ultimately wears down the Mule, who returns to rule over his kingdom peacefully for the rest of his life, without any further thought of conquering the Second Foundation.

However, as a result, the first Foundation has learned something of the Second Foundation beyond the simple fact that it exists, and has some understanding of its role. This means their behavior will now be chosen in light of that knowledge, and not based on uninformed natural human behavior, which means their behavior will no longer be the natural responses required by the mathematics of the Seldon Plan. This places the Plan itself at great risk. Additionally, the first Foundation instead starts to resentfully consider the other as a rival, and begins to develop equipment related to detecting and blocking mental influence, in order to detect members of the Second Foundation. After many attempts to unravel the Second Foundation's whereabouts from the minimal clues available, the Foundation is led to believe the Second Foundation is located on Terminus (being the "opposite end" of a galaxy, for a galaxy with a circular shape). The Foundation uncovers and destroys a group of fifty members of the Second Foundation and is left believing they have destroyed the Second Foundation. No longer concerned at the perceived threat, their behaviors as a society will tend to be those anticipated by the Plan.

In fact the group of fifty were volunteers on Terminus whose role was to be captured and give the impression that they composed the whole of the Second Foundation, so that the Seldon Plan would be able to continue unimpeded. The Second Foundation, itself, is finally revealed to be located on the former Imperial Homeworld of Trantor. The clue "at Star's End" was not a physical clue, but was instead based on an old saying, "All roads lead to Trantor, and that is where all stars end." Seldon, being a social scientist and not a physical one, placed the two Foundations at "opposite ends" of the galaxy, but in a sociological rather than physical sense. The first Foundation was located on the Periphery of the galaxy, where the Empire's influence was minimal; the Second Foundation was on Trantor, where, even in its dying days, the Empire's power and culture was strongest.

===''Foundation's Edge''===
{{main|Foundation's Edge}}
Believing the Second Foundation still exists (despite the common belief that it has been extinguished), young politician [[Golan Trevize]] is sent into [[exile]] by the current Mayor of the Foundation, [[List of minor Foundation series characters#Harla Branno|Harla Branno]], to uncover the Second Foundation; [[Golan Trevize|Trevize]] is accompanied by a scholar named [[Janov Pelorat]]. The reason for their belief is that, despite the unforeseeable impact of the Mule, the Seldon Plan still appears to be proceeding in accordance with the statements of Seldon's hologram, suggesting that the Second Foundation still exists and is secretly intervening to bring the plan back on course. After a few conversations with Pelorat, Trevize comes to believe that a mythical planet called [[Earth (Foundation universe)|Earth]] may hold the secret to the location. No such planet exists in any database, yet several myths and legends all refer to it, and it is Trevize's belief that the planet is deliberately being kept hidden. Unknown to Trevize and Pelorat, Branno is tracking their ship so that, in the event they find the Second Foundation, the first Foundation can take military or other action.

Meanwhile, [[Stor Gendibal]], a prominent member of the Second Foundation, discovers a simple local on Trantor who has had a very subtle alteration made to her mind, far more delicate than anything the Second Foundation can do. He concludes that a greater force of Mentalics must be active in the Galaxy. Following the events on Terminus, Gendibal endeavors to follow Trevize, reasoning that by doing so, he may find out who has altered the mind of the Trantor native.

Using the few scraps of reliable information within the various myths, Trevize and Pelorat discover a planet called Gaia which is inhabited solely by Mentalics, to such an extent that every organism and inanimate object on the planet shares a common mind. Both Branno and Gendibal, who have separately followed Trevize, also reach Gaia at the same time. Gaia reveals that it has engineered this situation because it wishes to do what is best for humanity but cannot be sure what is best. Trevize's purpose, faced with the leaders of both the First and Second Foundations and Gaia itself, is to be trusted to make the best decision among the three main alternatives for the future of the human race: the First Foundation's path, based on mastery of the physical world and its traditional political organization (i.e., Empire); the Second Foundation's path, based on mentalics and probable rule by an elite using mind control; or Gaia's path of absorption of the entire Galaxy into one shared, harmonious living entity in which all beings, and the galaxy itself, would be a part.

After Trevize makes his decision for Gaia's path, the intellect of Gaia adjusts both Branno's and Gendibal's minds so that each believes he or she has succeeded in a significant task. (Branno believes she has successfully negotiated a treaty tying Sayshell to the Foundation, and Gendibal – now leader (and First Speaker) of the Second Foundation – believes that the Second Foundation is victorious and should continue as normal.) Trevize remains, but is uncertain as to why he has intuited (is "sure") that Gaia is the correct outcome for the future.

Still uncertain about his decision, Trevize continues on with the search for Earth along with Pelorat and a local of Gaia, advanced in Mentalics, known as Blissenobiarella (usually referred to simply as Bliss). Eventually, Trevize finds three sets of coordinates which are very old. Adjusting them for time, he realizes that his ship's computer does not list any planet in the vicinity of the coordinates. When he physically visits the locations, he rediscovers the forgotten worlds of [[Aurora (planet)|Aurora]], [[Solaria]], and finally [[Melpomenia]]. After searching and facing different dilemmas on each planet, Trevize still has not discovered any answers.

Aurora and Melpomenia are long deserted, but Solaria contains a small population which is extremely advanced in the field of Mentalics. When the lives of the group are threatened, Bliss uses her abilities (and the shared intellect of Gaia) to destroy the Solarian who is about to kill them. This leaves behind a small child who will be put to death if left alone, so Bliss makes the decision to keep the child as they quickly escape the planet.

Eventually, Trevize discovers Earth, but it, again, contains no satisfactory answers for him (it is also long-since deserted). However, it dawns on Trevize that the answer may not be on Earth, but on Earth's satellite – the Moon. Upon approaching the planet, they are drawn inside the Moon's core, where they meet a robot named [[R. Daneel Olivaw]].

Olivaw explains that he has been instrumental in guiding human history for thousands of years, having provided the impetus for Seldon to create psychohistory and also the creation of Gaia, but is now close to the end of his ability to maintain himself and will cease to function. Despite replacing his [[positronic]] brain (which contain 20,000 years of memories), he is going to die shortly. He explains that no further robotic brain can be devised to replace his current one, or which will let him continue assisting for the benefit of humanity. However, some additional time can be won to ensure the long term benefit of humanity by merging [[R. Daneel Olivaw|R. Daniel Olivaw's]] mind with the organic intellect of a human – in this case, the intellect of the child that the group rescued on Solaria.

Once again, Trevize is put in the position of deciding if having Olivaw meld with the child's superior intellect would be in the best interests of the galaxy. The decision is left ambiguous (though likely a "yes") as it is implied that the melding of the minds may be to the child's benefit, but that she may have sinister intentions about it.

==Development and themes==
The early stories were inspired by [[Edward Gibbon]]'s ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]''. The plot of the series focuses on the growth and reach of the Foundation, against a backdrop of the "decline and fall of the Galactic Empire." The themes of Asimov's stories were also influenced by the political tendency in SF fandom, associated with the [[Futurians]], known as [[John Michel (science fiction)|Michelism]].

The focus of the books is the trends through which a civilization might progress, specifically seeking to analyze their progress, using history as a precedent. Although many science fiction novels such as ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' or ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'' do this, their focus is upon how current trends in society might come to fruition, and act as a moral allegory on the modern world. The ''Foundation'' series, on the other hand, looks at the trends in a wider scope, dealing with societal evolution and adaptation rather than the human and cultural qualities at one point in time.

Furthermore, the concept of psychohistory, which gives the events in the story a sense of rational fatalism, leaves little room for moralization. Hari Seldon himself hopes that his Plan will "reduce 30,000 years of Dark Ages and barbarism to a single millennium," a goal of exceptional moral gravity. Yet events within it are often treated as inevitable and necessary, rather than deviations from the greater good. For example, the Foundation slides gradually into oligarchy and dictatorship prior to the appearance of the galactic conqueror, known as the [[Mule (Foundation)|Mule]], who was able to succeed through the random chance of a telepathic mutation. But, for the most part, the book treats the purpose of [[Seldon Plan|Seldon's plan]] as unquestionable, and that slide as being necessary in it, rather than mulling over whether the slide is, on the whole, positive or negative.

The books also wrestle with the idea of individualism. Hari Seldon's plan is often treated as an inevitable mechanism of society, a vast mindless [[mob mentality]] of quadrillions of humans across the galaxy. Many in the series struggle against it, only to fail. However, the plan itself is reliant upon the cunning of individuals such as [[Salvor Hardin]] and [[Hober Mallow]] to make wise decisions that capitalize on the trends. On the other hand, the Mule, a single individual with mental powers, topples the Foundation and nearly destroys the Seldon plan with his special, unforeseen abilities. To repair the damage the Mule inflicts, the Second Foundation deploys a plan which turns upon individual reactions. Psychohistory is based on group trends and cannot predict with sufficient accuracy the effects of extraordinary, unforeseeable individuals, and as originally presented, the Second Foundation's purpose was to counter this flaw. Later novels would identify the Plan's uncertainties that remained at Seldon's death as the primary reason for the existence of the Second Foundation, which (unlike the First) had retained the capacity to research and further develop psychohistory.

Asimov tried unsuccessfully to end the series with ''[[Second Foundation]]''. However, because of the predicted thousand years until the rise of the next Empire (of which only a few hundred had elapsed), the series lacked a sense of closure. For decades, fans pressured him to write a sequel. In 1982, after a 30-year hiatus, Asimov gave in and wrote what was at the time a fourth volume: ''[[Foundation's Edge]]''. This was followed shortly thereafter by ''[[Foundation and Earth]]''. The story of this volume (which takes place some 500 years after Seldon) ties up all the loose ends and brings together all of his Robot, Empire, and Foundation novels into a single story. He also opens a brand new line of thought in the last dozen pages regarding [[Gaia (Foundation universe)#Galaxia|Galaxia]], a galaxy inhabited by a single collective mind. This concept was never explored further. According to his widow [[Janet Asimov]] (in her biography of Isaac, ''[[It's Been a Good Life]]''), he had no idea how to continue after ''Foundation and Earth'', so he started writing the prequels.

==The Foundation series==

===Merging with other series===
The series is set in the same universe as Asimov's first published novel, ''[[Pebble in the Sky]]'', although ''Foundation'' takes place about 10,000 years later. ''Pebble in the Sky'' became the basis for the [[Galactic Empire (series)|''Empire'' series]]. Then, at some unknown date (prior to writing ''Foundation's Edge'') Asimov decided to merge the ''Foundation''/''Empire'' series with his [[Robot series (Asimov)|''Robot'' series]]. Thus, all three series are set in the same universe, giving them a combined length of 15 novels, and a total of about 1,500,000 words (see the [[#Asimov's books within the Foundation series|List of books]] below). The merge also created a time-span of the series of around 20,000 years.

The stand-alone story ''[[Nemesis (Asimov novel)|Nemesis]]'' is also in the same continuity; being referenced in ''[[Forward the Foundation]]'', where [[Hari Seldon]] refers to a twenty-thousand-year-old story of "a young woman that could communicate with an entire planet that circled a sun named Nemesis." Commentators noted that ''Nemesis'' contains barely disguised references to the Spacers and their calendar system, the Galactic Empire and even to Hari Seldon which seem to have been deliberately placed for the purpose of later integration into the ''Foundation'' universe.&lt;ref name="From Robots to Foundations" &gt;{{cite book|last1=Codex|first1=Regius|title=From Robots to Foundations|date=2014|location=Wiesbaden/Ljubljana|isbn=1499569823}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Timeline inconsistencies===
Early on during Asimov's original world-building of the ''Foundation'' universe, he established within the first published stories a chronology placing the tales about 50,000 years into the future from the time they were written (''circa'' 1940). This precept was maintained in the pages of his first novel ''Pebble in the Sky'', wherein Imperial archaeologist [[Bel Arvardan]] refers to ancient human strata discovered in the Sirius sector dating back "some 50,000 years". However, when Asimov decided decades later to retroactively integrate the universe of his ''Foundation'' and ''Galactic Empire'' novels with that of his ''Robot'' stories, a number of changes and minor discrepancies surfaced – the character [[R. Daneel Olivaw]] was established as having existed for some 20,000 years, with the original ''Robot'' novels featuring the character occurring not more than a couple of millennia after the early-21st century [[Susan Calvin]] short stories. Also, in ''Foundation's Edge'', mankind was referred to as having possessed interstellar space travel for only 22,000 years, a far cry from the 50 millennia of earlier works.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

In the spring of 1955, Asimov published an early timeline in the pages of ''[[Thrilling Wonder Stories]]'' magazine based upon his thought processes concerning the ''Foundation'' universe's history at that point in his life, which vastly differs from its modern-era counterpart. Many included stories would later be either jettisoned from the later chronology or temporally relocated by the author. Also, the aforementioned lengthier scope of time was changed. For example, in the original 1950s timeline, humanity does not discover the hyperspatial drive until around 5000 AD, whereas in the reincorporated ''Robot'' universe chronology, the first interstellar jump occurs in 2029 AD, during the events of ''[[I, Robot]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asimovreviews.net/Timeline.html |title=An Early Asimov Timeline |publisher=Asimovreviews.net |date=2006-02-14 |accessdate=2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other authors==
Asimov's novels covered only 500 of the expected 1,000 years it would take for the Foundation to become a galactic empire. The novels written after Asimov did not continue the timeline but rather sought to fill in gaps in the earlier stories. The ''Foundation'' universe was once again revisited in 1989's ''[[Foundation's Friends]]'', a collection of short stories written by many prominent science fiction authors of that time. [[Orson Scott Card]]'s "[[The Originist]]" clarifies the founding of the Second Foundation shortly after Seldon's death; [[Harry Turtledove]]'s "Trantor Falls" tells of the efforts by the Second Foundation to survive during the sacking of Trantor, the imperial capital and Second Foundation's home; and [[George Zebrowski]]'s "Foundation's Conscience" is about the efforts of a historian to document Seldon's work following the rise of the Second Galactic Empire.

Also, shortly before his death in 1992, Asimov approved an outline for three novels, known as the Caliban trilogy by [[Roger MacBride Allen]], set between ''[[Robots and Empire]]'' and the Empire series. The Caliban trilogy describes the terraforming of the [[Spacer (Asimov)|Spacer]] world Inferno, a planet where an ecological crisis forces the Spacers to abandon many long-cherished parts of their culture. Allen's novels echo the uncertainties that Asimov's later books express about the [[Three Laws of Robotics]], and in particular the way a thoroughly roboticized culture can degrade human initiative.

After Asimov's death and at the request of Janet Asimov and the Asimov estate's representative, Ralph Vicinanza approached [[Gregory Benford]], and asked him to write another ''Foundation'' story. He eventually agreed, and with Vicinanza and after speaking "to several authors about [the] project", formed a plan for a trilogy with "two hard SF writers broadly influenced by Asimov and of unchallenged technical ability: [[Greg Bear]] and [[David Brin]]."&lt;ref&gt;Quotes from the Author's afterword in Foundation's Fear (Benford)&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Foundation's Fear]]'' (1997) takes place chronologically between part one and part two of Asimov's second prequel novel, ''[[Forward the Foundation]]''; ''[[Foundation and Chaos]]'' (1998) is set at the same time as the first chapter of ''Foundation'', filling in background; ''[[Foundation's Triumph]]'' (1999) covers ground following the recording of the holographic messages to the Foundation, and ties together a number of loose ends. These books are now claimed by some&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sikander.org/foundation.php|title=TimeLine for the Robots &amp; Foundations Universe|first=|last=sikander|website=www.sikander.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kaedrin.com/fun/asimov/newfound.html|title=The Second Foundation Series - Kaedrin's Guide to Isaac Asimov|website=kaedrin.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; to collectively be a "''Second Foundation'' trilogy", although they are inserts into pre-existing prequels and some of the earlier Foundation storylines and not generally recognized as a new Trilogy.

In an epilogue to ''Foundation's Triumph'', Brin noted he could imagine himself or a different author writing another sequel to add to ''Foundation's Triumph'', feeling that Hari Seldon's story was not yet necessarily finished. He later published a possible start of such a book on his website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidbrin.com/foundationdenouement1.html|title=worlds of DAVID BRIN|first=David Brin, Runaway|last=Serfer|website=www.davidbrin.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, the Asimov estate authorized publication of another trilogy of robot mysteries by [[Mark W. Tiedemann]]. These novels, which take place several years before Asimov's ''Robots and Empire'', are ''Mirage'' (2000), ''Chimera'' (2001), and ''Aurora'' (2002). These were followed by yet another robot mystery, [[Alexander C. Irvine]]'s ''Have Robot, Will Travel'' (2004), set five years after the Tiedemann trilogy.

In 2001, Donald Kingsbury published the novel ''[[Psychohistorical Crisis]]'', set in the Foundation universe after the start of the Second Empire.

Novels by various authors (''Isaac Asimov's'' ''[[Isaac Asimov's Robot City|Robot City]]'', ''[[Isaac Asimov's Robots and Aliens|Robots and Aliens]]'' and ''[[Isaac Asimov's Robots in Time|Robots in Time]]'' series) are loosely connected to the ''Robot'' series, but contain many inconsistencies with Asimov's books, and are not generally considered part of the ''Foundation'' series.

In November 2009, the Isaac Asimov estate announced the upcoming publication of'' Robots and Chaos'', the first volume in a trilogy featuring Susan Calvin by fantasy author [[Mickey Zucker Reichert]]. The book was published in November 2011 under the title ''I, Robot: To Protect''.

==Cultural impact==

===Impact in nonfiction===
In ''Learned Optimism'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Seligman|Seligman, Martin]]. ''Learned Optimism'' ((c) 1998 by Alfred A. Knopf, Inc.), 185ff.&lt;/ref&gt; psychologist [[Martin Seligman]] identifies the ''Foundation'' series as one of the most important influences in his professional life, because of the possibility of predictive sociology based on psychological principles. He also lays claim to the first successful prediction of a major historical (sociological) event, in the [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988 US elections]], and he specifically attributes this to a psychological principle.&lt;ref&gt;Seligman discusses the successful prediction of the Presidential and 33 Senatorial elections based on an evaluation of the candidates' optimism as expressed in their speeches, and the principle that American voters systematically favor optimistic candidates.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1996 book ''To Renew America'', [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|U. S. House Speaker]] [[Newt Gingrich]] wrote how he was influenced by reading the ''Foundation'' trilogy in high school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://historynewsnetwork.org/article/143446 "Newt Gingrich the Galactic Historian"]. [[Ray Smock]], [[History News Network]], 08 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Krugman]], winner of the 2008 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]], credits the ''Foundation'' series with turning his mind to economics, as the closest existing science to psychohistory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/dec/04/paul-krugman-asimov-economics|title=Paul Krugman: Asimov's Foundation novels grounded my economics|first=Paul|last=Krugman|date=4 December 2012|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/business/july-dec08/nobelkrugman_10-13.html|title=U.S. Economist Krugman Wins Nobel Prize in Economics|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the nonfiction PBS series ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage]]'', [[Carl Sagan]] referred to an ''Encyclopedia Galactica'' in the episodes "Encyclopaedia Galactica" and "Who Speaks for Earth".

===Awards===
In 1966, the ''Foundation'' trilogy beat several other science fiction and fantasy series to receive a special [[Hugo Award]] for "Best All-Time Series". The runners-up for the award were ''[[Barsoom series]]'' by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], ''[[Future History (Heinlein)|Future History series]]'' by [[Robert A. Heinlein]], ''[[Lensman series]]'' by [[Edward E. Smith]] and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]].&lt;ref name=Hugo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1966-hugo-awards/|title=1966 Hugo Awards|date=26 July 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation series is still the only series so honored. Asimov himself wrote that he assumed the one-time award had been created to honor ''The Lord of the Rings'', and he was amazed when his work won.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= In Joy Still Felt: The Autobiography of Isaac Asimov, 1954–1978|last= Asimov|first= Isaac|date= 1980|publisher=Doubleday|location= Garden City, New York|isbn= 0-385-15544-1|at= chapter 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series has won three other Hugo Awards. ''Foundation's Edge'' won Best Novel in 1983, and was a bestseller for almost a year. Retrospective Hugo Awards were given in 1996 and 2018 for, respectively, "The Mule" (the major part of ''Foundation and Empire'') for Best Novel (1946) and "Foundation" (the first story written for the series, and second chapter of the first novel) for Best Short Story (1943).

===Impact in fiction and entertainment===
Science fiction parodies, such as [[Douglas Adams]]' ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' and [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]]'s ''[[Bill, the Galactic Hero]]'', often display clear ''Foundation'' influences. For instance, "The Guide" of the former is a spoof of the ''[[Encyclopedia Galactica]]'', and the series actually mentions the encyclopedia by name, remarking that it is rather "dry", and consequently sells fewer copies than the guide; the latter also features the ultra-urbanized Imperial planet Helior, often parodying the logistics such a planet-city would require, but that Asimov's novel downplays when describing Trantor.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

In 1995, [[Donald Kingsbury]] wrote "Historical Crisis", which he later expanded into a novel, ''[[Psychohistorical Crisis]]''. It takes place about 2,000 years after ''Foundation'', after the founding of the Second Galactic Empire. It is set in the same fictional universe as the Foundation series, in considerable detail, but with virtually all ''Foundation''-specific names either changed (e.g., Kalgan becomes Lakgan), or avoided (psychohistory is created by an unnamed, but often-referenced Founder). The novel explores the ideas of psychohistory in a number of new directions, inspired by more recent developments in mathematics and [[computer science]], as well as by new ideas in science fiction itself.

In 1998, the novel [[Spectre (Star Trek)]] (part of the [[Shatnerverse]] series) by [[William Shatner]] and [[Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens]] states that the [[Mirror Universe]] divergent path has been studied by the ''Seldon Psychohistory Institute''.

The [[oboe]]-like holophonor in [[Matt Groening]]'s animated television series ''[[Futurama]]'' is based directly upon the "Visi-Sonor" which [[Mule (Foundation)|Magnifico]] plays in ''Foundation and Empire.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people=Cohen, David X.|date=2003|title=Futurama season 4 DVD commentary for the episode "The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings"|medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox|quote=Of course, you'll remember the holophonor [...] as we've said [...] is inspired by an instrument in [...] Foundation, one of the Foundation books, Isaac Asimov, the Mule plays an instrument much like that, except that it controls peoples minds.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Visi-Sonor" is also mirrored in an episode of ''[[Special Unit 2]]'', where a child's television character plays an instrument that induces mind control over children.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

During the 2006–2007 [[Marvel Comics]] [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] storyline, in [[Fantastic Four]] #542 [[Mister Fantastic]] revealed his own attempt to develop psychohistory, saying he was inspired after reading the Foundation series.

According to lead singer [[Ian Gillan]], the hard rock band [[Deep Purple]]'s song ''The Mule'' is based on the Foundation character: "Yes, The Mule was inspired by Asimov. It's been a while but I'm sure you've made the right connection...Asimov was required reading in the 60's."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gillan.com/qa-62.html|title=Caramba - Q&amp;a|website=www.gillan.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio adaptation===
An eight-part [[The Foundation Trilogy (BBC Radio)|radio adaptation]] of the original trilogy, with sound design by the [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]], was broadcast on [[BBC Radio 3]] in 1973 – one of the first BBC radio drama serials to be made in [[stereophonic sound|stereo]]. A [[BBC 7]] [[rerun]] commenced in July 2003.

Adapted by [[Patrick Tull]] (episodes 1 to 4) and Mike Stott (episodes 5 to 8), the dramatisation was directed by [[David Cain (composer)|David Cain]] and starred William Eedle as Hari Seldon, with [[Geoffrey Beevers]] as Gaal Dornick, [[Lee Montague]] as Salvor Hardin, [[Julian Glover]] as Hober Mallow, [[Dinsdale Landen]] as Bel Riose, [[Maurice Denham]] as Ebling Mis and [[Prunella Scales]] as Lady Callia.

===Film adaptation===
By 1998, [[New Line Cinema]] had spent $1.5&amp;nbsp;million developing a film version of the ''Foundation Trilogy''. The failure to develop a new franchise was partly a reason the studio signed on to produce [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sibley | first = Brian | authorlink = Brian Sibley | title = Peter Jackson: A Film-maker's Journey | publisher =Harpercollins | year =2006 | location =London | page =403 | isbn = 0-00-717558-2 |chapter=Three-Ring Circus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 29, 2008, [[New Line Cinema]] co-founders [[Bob Shaye]] and [[Michael Lynne]] were reported to have been signed on to produce an adaptation of the trilogy by their company Unique Pictures for Warner Brothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Rich Drees| title = FOUNDATION Heading To Big Screen| publisher = Film Buff OnLine | date = 2008-07-29 | url = http://www.filmbuffonline.com/FBOLNewsreel/wordpress/?p=842/ | accessdate=2008-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, [[Columbia Pictures]] (Sony) successfully bid for the screen rights on January 15, 2009, and then contracted [[Roland Emmerich]] to direct and produce. Michael Wimer was named as co-producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|0000386|Roland Emmerich}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Two years later, the studio hired [[Dante Harper]] to adapt the books. This project failed to materialize and [[HBO]] acquired the rights when they became available in 2014.&lt;ref name="Sneider"&gt;{{cite web |last1 = Sneider |first1 = Jeff |title = 'Interstellar's' Jonah Nolan Developing 'Foundation' Series for HBO, WBTV (Exclusive) |website = [[TheWrap]] |url = http://www.thewrap.com/interstellars-jonah-nolan-developing-foundation-series-for-hbo-wbtv-exclusive/ |date = 10 November 2014 |accessdate = 11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books within the ''Foundation'' series==
===Overview===
The "Author's Note" of ''[[Prelude to Foundation]]'' contains the chronological ordering of Asimov's science fiction books, in which he also said, "they were not written in the order in which (perhaps) they should be read".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Asimov|first=Isaac|title=Prelude to Foundation|year=1988|publisher=Bantam Dell|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-553-90095-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Forward the Foundation'' does not appear in Asimov's list, as it was not yet published at the time, and the order of the Empire novels in Asimov's list is not entirely consistent with other lists. For example, the 1983 [[Ballantine Books]] printing of ''[[The Robots of Dawn]]'' lists the Empire novels as: ''[[The Stars, Like Dust]], [[The Currents of Space]]'', and ''[[Pebble in the Sky]]''. Given that ''The Currents of Space'' includes Trantor and that ''The Stars, Like Dust'' does not, these two books possibly were accidentally reversed in Asimov's list.

===Asimov's books within the ''Foundation'' series===
# ''[[The Complete Robot]]'' (1982) and/or ''[[I, Robot]]'' (1950)
# ''[[The Caves of Steel]]'' (1954)
# ''[[The Naked Sun]]'' (1957)
# ''[[The Robots of Dawn]]'' (1983)
# ''[[Robots and Empire]]'' (1985)
# ''[[The Currents of Space]]'' (1952)

Another alternative is to read the books in their original order of publication, since reading the ''Foundation'' prequels prior to reading the ''Foundation Trilogy'' fundamentally alters the original narrative structure of the trilogy by spoiling what were originally presented as plot surprises.{{original research inline|date=May 2011}} In that same ''Author's Note'', Asimov noted that there is room for a book between ''Robots and Empire (5)'' and ''The Currents of Space (6)'', and that he could follow ''Foundation and Earth (15)'' with additional volumes.

===Tangential books===
While not mentioned in the above list, the books ''[[The End of Eternity]]'' (1955) and ''[[Nemesis (Asimov)|Nemesis]]'' (1989) are also referenced in the series.

''The End of Eternity'' is vaguely referenced in ''Foundation's Edge'', where a character mentions the Eternals, whose "task it was to choose a [[reality]] that would be most suitable to Humanity". (''The End of Eternity'' also refers to a "Galactic Empire" within its story.) In ''Forward the Foundation'', Hari Seldon refers to a 20-thousand-year-old story of "a young woman that could communicate with an entire planet that circled a sun named Nemesis", a reference to ''Nemesis''. In ''Nemesis'', the main colony is one of the Fifty Settlements, a collection of orbital colonies that form a state. The Fifty Settlements possibly were the basis for the fifty Spacer worlds in the ''Robot'' stories. The implication at the end of ''Nemesis'' that the inhabitants of the off-Earth colonies are splitting off from Earthbound humans could also be connected to a similar implication about the Spacers in [[Mark W. Tiedemann]]'s ''Robot'' books.

On the other hand, these references might be just jokes by Asimov, and the stories mentioned could be just those really written by himself (as seen in ''The Robots of Dawn'', where Fastolfe makes a reference to Asimov's ''Liar!'') and still being read twenty thousand years later. Furthermore, Asimov himself did not mention ''The End of Eternity'' in the series listing from ''Prelude to Foundation''. As for ''Nemesis'', it was written after ''Prelude to Foundation'', but in the author's note Asimov explicitly states that the book is not part of the ''Foundation'' or ''Empire'' series, but that some day he might tie it to the others.

== [[Geert Hofstede]] ==

Hofstede has performed research for several decades that continues to impact research in global and international arenas of global leadership.  Hofstede’s research is primarily focused on how values in the workplace are influenced by culture. According to him, all behaviors are determined by culture. In his definition; culture is ‘the collective programming of the mind distinguishing the members of one group or category of people from others.’ To conduct his research, he analyzed a large database of employee value scores collected within IBM between years 1967 and 1973. There is over 70 countries in the data. Hofstede’s primary tenants of culture differentiation are summed up through his research more elaborately, but primarily consist of:&lt;ref&gt;Hofstede, G., &amp; Hofstede, G. J. (1967-2009). itim international Retrieved November 3, 2010, from http://www.geert-hofstede.com/&lt;/ref&gt; In his model, he identified six dimensions of national culture based on his research. Those dimensions are also used to differentiate countries from each other, based on how countries score on the six dimensions. The scale of scores range from 0 – 100. If a score is below 50 it is considered as Low and if it is higher than 50 it is considered as High in that dimension. Here, although countries are represented with a score, the scores are relative and cannot represent unique individuals. In other words, ‘culture can be only used meaningfully by comparison.’ The relevant scores are proven to be stable over time. Forces that cause cultures to shift are global and therefore is there is something effecting the culture in a country, it actually effects many countries at the same time in the world. The model consists of six dimensions; which are Power Distance, Individualism, Masculinity vs Femininity, Uncertainty Avoidance, Long Term Orientation vs Short Term Normative Orientation and Indulgence vs Restraint. Furthermore, he has published several books and academic articles on the subject in order to light the way for global business leaders as well as academic researchers.

=== Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions ===
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
* '''Power Distance Index (PDI)-''' that is an index which measures the less powerful members of organizations and institutions and how they accept and expect that power is distributed unequally. Power distance indicates how society handles inequalities among people. Countries that have high power distance accept the hierarchical order in which people are in different levels / places and there is no further justification. Therefore, inequalities of power and wealth distribution are allowed in the society. On the other hand, countries having low power distance are supported equality and demand justification for inequalities of power. In these societies, equality and opportunity for everyone is highly reinforced.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.geert-hofstede.com/&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Individualism (ADV)-''' as it is juxtaposed to its opposite, collectivism, that is the measure to which individuals are comfortably integrated into groups. The society’s point of view on this dimension is reflected in whether people’s self-image is defined in terms of ‘I’ or ‘We’. Or similarly, it is the difference between individual above the society vs society above the individual. In individualistic countries there is high valuation of people’s time, their need for independence and their privacy. On the other hand, collectivist countries are more supportive for harmony in the society.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.geert-hofstede.com/&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''Femininity (FEM)-''' versus its opposite, masculinity, refers to the distribution of roles between the genders which is another fundamental issue for any society to which a range of solutions are found. Femininity represents cooperation, modesty, caring for the weak, and quality of life. Masculinity represents competitiveness, achievements, heroism, assertiveness and material rewards for success. In the business world, femininity and masculinity is seen as being "tender or tough."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hofstede-insights.com/models/national-culture/&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''Uncertainty Avoidance Index (UAI)-''' deals with a society's tolerance for uncertainty and ambiguity; it ultimately refers to man's search for Truth. Countries having high uncertainty avoidance have very strict rules of belief and behavior and they are intolerant for ideas or behavior otherwise. Countries having low uncertainty avoidance have more relaxed attitudes.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.geert-hofstede.com/&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''Long-Term Orientation (LTO)-''' values associated with Long Term Orientation are thrift and perseverance; values associated with Short Term Orientation are respect for tradition, fulfilling social obligations, and protecting one's 'face'. This dimension is created to understand the long term orientation of mainly Asian cultures and their respect for tradition. In the business world, long-term orientation and shot term orientation are referred as being pragmatic and normative.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.geert-hofstede.com/&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Indulgence (IVR)-''' versus restraint refers to the extent to which members of a society try to control their desires and impulses. Whereas indulgent societies have a tendency to allow relatively free gratification of basic and natural human desires related to enjoying life and having fun, restrained societies have a conviction that such gratification needs to be curbed and regulated by strict norms.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.geert-hofstede.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Project GLOBE ==

The GLOBE (Global Leadership and Organizational Behavior Effectiveness Research) project took Hofstede’s original 1980 research findings (Hofstede, 1980) and dedicated an entire academic effort into exploring the differences of cultures (Hofstede, 1980). “Conceived in 1991 by Robert J. House of the [[Wharton School]] of the [[University of Pennsylvania]], and led by Professor House, the GLOBE Project directly involved 170 “country co-investigators” based in 62 of the world’s [[cultures]] as well as a 14-member group of coordinators and research associates. This international team collected data from 17,300 [[middle manager]]s in 951 organizations. They used qualitative methods to assist their development of quantitative [[Survey methodology|instruments]].&lt;ref&gt;Grove, C. (2005). Introduction to the GLOBE Research Project on Leadership Worldwide from http://www.grovewell.com/pub-GLOBE-intro.html&lt;/ref&gt;”  The research identified nine cultural competencies and grouped the 62 countries into ten [[convenient]] societal clusters (Javidan &amp; Dastmalchian, 2009).

=== Globe cultural clusters ===

The GLOBE researchers used acquired data to put nations into cultural clusters that are grouped based upon cultural similarities due to shared geography and climate conditions, which all influence perceptions and behavior:

'''Anglo Cultures'''
[[England]], [[Australia]], [[South Africa]] (white sample), [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], [[Ireland]], [[United States]]

'''Arab Cultures'''
[[Algeria]], [[Qatar]], [[Morocco]], [[Egypt]], [[Kuwait]], [[Libya]], [[Tunisia]], [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]], [[Yemen]], [[Jordan]], [[Iraq]], [[UAE]], [[Bahrain]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Oman]]

'''Confucian Asia'''
[[Taiwan]], [[Singapore]], [[Hong Kong]], [[South Korea]], [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Vietnam]]

'''Eastern Europe'''
[[Hungary]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Romania]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], [[Poland]], [[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]], [[Estonia]], [[Serbia]], [[Greece]], [[Slovenia]], [[Albania]], [[Russia]]

'''Germanic Europe'''
''Dutch-speaking'' ([[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]] and [[French Flanders|Dutch-speaking France]])
''German-speaking'' ([[Austria]], German-speaking [[Switzerland]], [[Germany]], [[South Tyrol]], [[Liechtenstein]])

'''Latin America'''
[[Costa Rica]], [[Venezuela]], [[Ecuador]], [[Mexico]], [[El Salvador]], [[Colombia]], [[Guatemala]], [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]]

'''Latin Europe'''
[[Italy]], [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], [[France]], [[Switzerland]] (French and Italian speaking)

'''Nordic Europe'''
[[Finland]], [[Sweden]], [[Denmark]]

'''Southern Asia'''
[[Pakistan]], [[India]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Thailand]], [[Iran]], [[Philippines]], [[Turkey]]

'''Sub-Sahara Africa'''
[[Namibia]], [[Zambia]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[South Africa]] (Black Sample), [[Nigeria]]

=== GLOBE cultural competencies ===
The nine GLOBE cultural competencies are:
# '''Performance [[Orientation (mental)|orientation]] -''' refers to the extent to which an organization or [[society]] encourages and rewards group members for [[performance improvement]] and excellence.
# '''Assertiveness orientation -''' is the degree to which individuals in organizations or societies are assertive, confrontational, and aggressive in social relationships.
# '''Future orientation -''' is the degree to which individuals in [[organizations]] or societies engage in future-oriented behaviors such as planning, investing in the future, and delaying [[gratification]].
# '''Humane orientation -''' is the degree to which individuals in organizations or societies encourage and reward individuals for being fair, [[altruistic]], friendly, generous, caring, and kind to others.
# '''[[Collectivism]] I:  Institutional collectivism -''' reflects the degree to which organizational and societal institutional practices encourage and reward collective distribution of resources and collective action.
# '''[[Collectivism]] II: In-group collectivism -''' reflects the degree to which individuals express pride, loyalty and cohesiveness in their organizations or families.
# '''[[Gender]] [[egalitarianism]] -''' is the extent to which an organization or a [[society]] minimizes gender role differences and gender discrimination.
# '''Power distance -''' is defined as the degree to which members of an organization or society expect and agree that power should be unequally shared.
# '''Uncertainty avoidance -''' is defined as the extent to which members of an organization or society strive to avoid uncertainty by reliance on social norms, [[rituals]], and [[bureaucratic]] practices to alleviate the [[unpredictability]] of future events.

After extensive review of the research the GLOBE strategically grouped over 21 primary leadership [[dimensions]] into six encompassing dimensions of global leadership and made recommendation about how the dimensions of culture and leadership could distinguish influences of one country from another.

=== Culturally endorsed implicit leadership (CLT) ===
The six Globe dimensions of culturally endorsed implicit leadership (CLT) are:
# '''Charismatic/value based –''' characterized by demonstrating integrity, decisiveness, and performance oriented by appearing visionary, inspirational and self-sacrificing, but can also be toxic and allow for autocratic commanding.
# '''Team oriented –''' characterized by [[diplomacy|diplomatic]], administratively competent, team collaboration and integration.  A [[Toxic leader|Toxic]] leader would be malevolent alienating the team, but driving cohesion
# '''Self-protective –''' characterized by self-centered, face saving, procedural behavior capable of inducing conflict when necessary while being conscious of status
# '''Participative –''' characterized by (non-autocratic) participative behavior that is supportive of those who are being led
# '''Human orientation –''' characterized by modesty and compassion for others in an altruistic fashion
# '''Autonomous –''' being able to function without constant consultation

As [[globalization]] continues to thrive and change, the concept of global leadership will adapt to serve the best interest of a world being made incrementally smaller.

In [[development studies]], the concept of a [[value chain]] has been used to analyse [[international trade]] in global value chains which comprises “the full range of activities that are required to bring a product from its conception, through its design, its sourced raw materials and intermediate inputs, its marketing, its distribution and its support to the final consumer”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://globalvaluechains.org/concept-tools|title=Concept &amp; Tools - Global Value Chains|website=Globalvaluechains.org|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, when activities must be coordinated across geographies, the term '''global value chain''' ('''GVC''') is used in the development literature. Simply put, the global value chain includes all of the people and activities involved in the production of a good or service and its global level supply, distribution and post sales activities (also known as the [[supply chain]]). GVC is similar to [[Value_chain#Industry-level|Industry Level Value Chain]] but encompasses operations at the global level.

== In development ==
The first references to the GVC concept date from the mid-1990s and were enthusiastic about the upgrading prospects for [[Developing country|developing countries]] that joined them. In his early work based on research on East Asian garment firms, the pioneer in value chain analysis, [[Gary Gereffi]], describes a process of almost ‘natural’ learning and upgrading for the firms that joined GVCs.&lt;ref&gt;Gereffi, G., (1994). The Organisation of Buyer-Driven Global Commodity Chains: How US Retailers Shape Overseas Production Networks. In G. Gereffi, and M. Korzeniewicz (Eds), Commodity Chains and Global Capitalism. Westport, CT: Praeger.&lt;/ref&gt; This echoed the ‘export-led’ discourse of the [[World Bank]] in the ‘[[East Asian Miracle]]’ report based on the East Asian ‘[[Four Asian Tigers|Tigers]]’ success.

This encouraged the World Bank and other leading institutions to encourage developing firms to develop their indigenous capabilities through a process of upgrading technical capabilities to meet global standards with leading multinational enterprises ([[Multinational corporation|MNE]]) playing a key role in helping local firms through transfer of new technology, skills and knowledge.

Wider adoption of [[open source hardware]] technology used for [[digital fabrication]] such as [[3D printers]] like the [[RepRap]] has the potential to partially reverse the trend towards global specialization of production systems into elements that may be geographically dispersed and closer to the end users (localization) and thus disrupt global value chains.&lt;ref&gt; André O. Laplume, Bent Petersen, Joshua M. Pearce, [https://www.academia.edu/27224636/Global_Value_Chains_from_a_3D_Printing_Perspective  Global value chains from a 3D printing perspective],  ''Journal of International Business Studies'' 47(5), 595–609 (2016). doi:10.1057/jibs.2015.47 &lt;/ref&gt;

GVC analysis views “upgrading” as a continuum starting with “process upgrading” (e.g. a producer adopts better technology to improve efficiency), then moves on to “product upgrading” where the quality or functionality of the product is upgraded by using higher quality material or a better quality management system ([[Quality management system|QMS]]), and then on to “functional upgrading” in which the firm begins to design its own product and develops marketing and branding capabilities and begins to supply to end markets/customers directly - often by targeting geographies or customers which are not served by its existing multinational clients). Subsequently, the process of upgrading might also cover inter-sectoral upgrading.&lt;ref name="Humphrey and Schmitz (2004)"&gt;Humphrey, J., and H. Schmitz. 2004. "Chain Governance and Upgrading: Taking Stock". in ''Local Enterprises in the Global Economy'', edited by H. Schmitz, 349–82. Cheltenham: Edward Elgar.&lt;/ref&gt;

This upgrading process in GVCs has been challenged by other researchers – some of whom argue that insertion in global value chains does not always lead to upgrading. Some authors&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey, J. and Schmitz, H. (2000). Governance and Upgrading: Linking Industrial Cluster and Global Value Chain. IDS Working Paper 120, Institute of Development Studies, University of Sussex, Brighton.&lt;/ref&gt; argue that the expected upgrading process might not hold for all types of upgrading. Specifically they argue upgrading into design, marketing and branding might be hindered by exporting under certain conditions because MNEs have no interest in transferring these core skills to their suppliers thus preventing them from accessing global markets (except as a supplier) for first world customer.

=== Current research on governance and its impact from a development perspective ===
There are motivations behind renewed interest in global value chains and the opportunities that they may present for countries in [[South Asia]]. A 2013 report found that looking at the production chain, rather than the individual stages of production, is more helpful. Individual donors with their own priorities and expertise cannot be expected to provide comprehensive response to the needs identified, not to mention the legal responsibilities of many specialist agencies. The research suggests they adjust their priorities and modalities to the way production chains operate, and to coordinate with other donors to cover all trade needs. It calls for donors and governments to work together to assess how aid flows may affect power relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jodie Keane|date=2014|title=''Aid for trade and Global Value Chains: Issues for South Asia''|url=http://www.sawtee.org/publications/Policy-Brief-26.pdf|format=PDF|website=Sawtee.org|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1994 paper, Gereffi identified two major types of [[governance]]. The first were buyer-driven chains, where the lead firms are final buyers such as retail chains and branded product producers such as non-durable final consumer products (e.g., clothing, footwear and food). The second governance type identified by Gereffi were producer-driven chains. Here the technological competences of the lead firms (generally upstream in the chain) defined the chain’s competitiveness.

Current research suggests that GVCs exhibit a variety of characteristics and impact communities in a variety of ways. In a paper that emerged from the deliberations of the GVC Initiative,&lt;ref&gt;Gary Gereffi, John Humphrey, and Timothy Sturgeon, “The governance of global value chains,” ''Review of International Political Economy'', vol. 12, no. 1, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; five GVC governance patterns were identified:
* '''Hierarchical''' chains represent the fully internalised operations of [[Vertical integration|vertically integrated]] firms.
* '''Quasi-hierarchical''' (or '''captive''' chains) involve suppliers or intermediate customers with low levels of capabilities, who require high levels of support and are the subject of well-developed supply chain management from lead firms (often called the chain governor).
* '''Relational''' and '''modular''' chain governance exhibit durable relations between lead firms and their suppliers and customers in the chain, but with low levels of chain governance often because the main suppliers in the chain possess their own unique competences (and/or infrastructure) and can operate independently of the lead firm.
* '''Market''' chains represent the classic arms length relationships found in many [[Commodity market|commodity markets]].

As capabilities in many low- and middle-income economies have grown, chain governance has tended to move away from quasi-hierarchical models toward modular type as this form of governance reduces the costs of supply chain management and allows chain governors to maintain a healthy level of competition in their supply chains. However, whilst it maintains short-term competition in the supply chain, it has allowed some leading intermediaries to develop considerable functional competences (e.g., design and branding). In the long term these have the potential to emerge as competitors to their original chain governor (Kaplinski, 2010).&lt;ref&gt;Kaplinsky, R. (2010), The Role of Standards in Global Value Chains and their Impact on Economic and Social Upgrading, Policy Research Paper 5396, World Bank&lt;/ref&gt;

The theoretical concepts often considered firms as operating in a single value chain (with a single customer). Whilst this was often the case in quasi-hierarchical chains (with considerable customer power) it has become apparent that some firms operate in multiple value chains (subject to multiple forms of governance) and serve both national and international markets and that this plays a role in the development of firm capabilities (Navas-Aleman, 2011;&lt;ref&gt;Navas - Aleman, L. (2011) “The Impact of Operating in Multiple Value Chains for Upgrading: The Case of the Brazilian Furniture and Footwear Industries” World Development Vol. 39(8), pp. 1386 – 1397&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNCTAD]], 2013).&lt;ref name="unctad.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/wir2013_en.pdf|format=PDF|title=World Investment Report 2013: Global Value Chains: Investment and Trade for Development|website=Unctad.org|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Summary of Unctad report: global value chains and development ===
In 2013, [[UNCTAD]] published two reports on GVCs and their contribution to development. They concluded &lt;ref name="unctad.org"/&gt; that:
* GVCs make a significant contribution to international development. Value-added trade contributes about 30% to the [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] of developing countries, significantly more than it does in developed countries (18%) furthermore the level of participation in GVCs is associated with stronger levels of [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|GDP per capita growth]]. GVCs thus have a direct impact on the economy, employment and income and create opportunities for development. They can also be an important mechanism for [[Developing country|developing countries]] to enhance productive capacity, by increasing the rate of adoption of technology and through workforce skill development, thus building the foundations for long-term industrial upgrading.
* However, there are limitations to the GVC approach. Their contribution to the growth may be limited if the work done in-country is relatively low value adding (i.e. contributes only a small part of the total value added for the product or service). In addition there is no automatic process that guarantees diffusion of technology, skill-building and upgrading. Developing countries thus face the risk of operating in permanently low value-added activities. Finally, there are potential negative impacts on the environment and social conditions, including: poor workplace conditions, occupational safety and health, and job security. The relative ease with which the Value Chain Governors can relocate their production (often to lower cost countries) also create additional risks.
* Countries need to carefully assess the pros and cons of GVC participation and the costs and benefits of proactive policies to promote GVCs or GVC-led development strategies. Promoting GVC participation implies targeting specific GVC segments and GVC participation can only form one part of a country’s overall development strategy.
* Before promoting GVC participation, policymakers should evaluate their countries’ trade profiles and industrial capabilities in order to select strategic GVC development paths. Achieving upgrading opportunities through CVCs requires a structured approach that includes:
** embedding GVCs in industrial development policies (e.g. targeting GVC tasks and activities);  
** enabling GVC growth by providing the right framework conditions for trade and FDI and by putting in place the needed infrastructure; and 
** developing firm capabilities and training the local workforce.

==Gender and global value chains==
Gender plays a prominent role in global value chains, because it influences consumption patterns within the United States, and thus affects production on a larger scale. In turn, specific roles within the value chain are also determined by gender, making gender a key component in the process as well. Far more women than men are found in the informal sector, as self-employed workers or subcontractors, while specific jobs and broader fields of work differ between men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carr|first1=Marilyn|last2=Chen|first2=Martha Alter|last3=Tate|first3=Jane|title=Globalization and Home-Based  Workers|journal=Feminist Economics|date=200|volume=6|issue=3|pages=123–42|doi=10.1080/135457000750020164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women in global value chains===
Within the global value chains, it is often women who work in the weakest or most disadvantaged chains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Watson|first1=Bruce|title=Economic Inequality for Women Costs $9tn Globally, study finds|work=The Guardian|date=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sassen|first1=Saskia|title=Globalization and Its Discontents|date=1998|publisher=New Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Natsuda|first1=Kaoru|last2=Goto|first2=Kenta|last3=Thoburn|first3=John|title=Challenges To The Cambodian Garment  Industry In The Global Garment Value Chain|journal=European Journal of Development Research|date=2010|volume=22|issue=4|pages=469–493|doi=10.1057/ejdr.2010.21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barrientos|first1=Stephanie|title=Gender, Flexibility and Global Value Chain|journal=IDS Bulletin|date=22 May 2009|issue=32|pages=83–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carr et al. argue that “the vast majority of subcontract workers or industrial homeworkers, who earn some of the lowest wages worldwide, are women.”

A '''Guide to information sources''' (or a '''bibliographic guide''', a '''literature guide''', a '''guide to reference materials''', a '''subject gateway''', etc.) is a kind of '''[[metabibliography]]'''. Ideally it is not just a listing of [[bibliographies]], [[reference work]]s  and other [[information source]]s, but more like a [[textbook]] introducing users to the information sources in a given field (in general).

Such guides may have many different forms: Comprehensive or highly selective, printed or electronic sources, annoteted listings or written chapters etc.

==Functions==
Often used as curriculum tools for [[bibliographic instruction]], the guides help library users find materials or help those unfamiliar with a discipline understand the key sources.

[[Roller coaster]] amusement rides have origins back to ice slides constructed in 18th-century [[Russia]]. Early technology featured sleds or wheeled carts that were sent down hills of snow reinforced by wooden supports. The technology evolved in the 19th century to feature [[Track (rail transport)|railroad track]] using wheeled cars that were securely locked to the track. Newer innovations emerged in the early 20th century with side friction and underfriction technologies to allow for greater speeds and sharper turns. By the mid-to-late 20th century, these elements intensified with the introduction of steel roller coaster designs and the ability for them to invert riders.

==History==

===Beginnings===
The world's oldest roller coasters descended from the "[[Russian Mountains]]," which were specially constructed hills of snow &lt;ref&gt;Coker, Robert (2002). ''Roller Coasters: A Thrill Seeker's Guide to the Ultimate Scream Machines'', Metrobooks, New York. {{ISBN|1586631721}}. pg 14&lt;/ref&gt; located in the gardens of  palaces around the Russian capital, [[Saint Petersburg]], in the 18th century. This attraction  was called a ''Katalnaya Gorka'' or "sliding mountain" in Russian.  The slides were built to a height of between {{convert|70|ft|m|0}} and {{convert|80|ft|m|0}}, had  a 50 degree drop, and were reinforced by wooden supports.  Sometimes wheeled carts were used instead of sleds.  These slides became popular with the Russian upper class, and with  [[Catherine II of Russia]] herself, who had such mountains built in the gardens of the [[Oranienbaum Palace]] near St. Petersburg, with a pavilion next to it for drinking tea after the sliding.  "Russian mountains" remains the term for roller coasters in many languages, such as Spanish (''[[:es:Montaña rusa|la montaña rusa]]''), Italian (''[[:it:Montagne russe|montagne russe]]''), and French (''[[:fr:Montagnes russes|les montagnes russes]]''). Ironically, the Russian term for roller coaster, ''[[:ru:американские горки|американские горки]]'' (amerikanskie gorki), translates literally as "American mountains."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rambler.ru/dict/new-enru/00/12/99.shtml  Rambler New English-Russian Dictionary: "American"]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Promenades Aeriennes Jardin Baujon.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Promenades-Aeriennes in Paris (1817).]]
Russian soldiers occupying Paris from 1815 through 1816, after the defeat of [[Napoleon]] at Waterloo, may have introduced the Russian amusement of sledding down steep hills.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Valérie RANSON-ENGUIALE, « Promenades aériennes », Histoire par l'image [en ligne], consulté le 28 Mai 2017. URL : http://www.histoire-image.org/etudes/promenades-aeriennes &lt;/ref&gt; In July 1817, a French banker named Nicolas Beaujon opened the Parc Beaujon, an amusement park on the [[Champs Elysees]]. Its most famous feature was the ''Promenades Aériennes'' or "Aerial Strolls." &lt;ref&gt;Fierro, Alfred, ''Histoire et Dictionnaire de Paris'', (1996). Robert Laffont, page 1051. &lt;/ref&gt; It featured wheeled cars securely locked to the track, guide rails to keep them on course, and higher speeds. &lt;ref name=Bennett&gt;David Bennett (1998). ''Roller Coaster: Wooden and Steel Coasters, Twisters and Corkscrews''.  Edison, New Jersey: Chartwell Books. 9. {{ISBN|0-7865-0885-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The three-wheel carts were towed to the top of a tower,  and then released to descend two curving tracks on either side.  King [[Louis XVIII of France]] came to see the park, but it is not recorded if he tried the ride. Before long there were seven similar rides in Paris: ''Les Montagnes françaises'' (The French Mountains), ''le Delta'', ''les Montagnes de Belleville'' (The Mountains of Belleville),  ''les Montagnes américaines'' (the American Mountains), ''Les Montages lilliputiennes'', (The miniature mountains), ''Les Montagnes susses'' (The Swiss mountains)  and ''Les Montagnes égyptiennes'' (The Egyptian mountains).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In the beginning, these attractions were primarily for the upper classes. In 1845 a new amusement park opened in Copenhagen, [[Tivoli Gardens|Tivoli]], which was designed for the middle class. These new parks featured roller coasters as permanent attractions. The first permanent loop track was probably also built in Paris from an English design in 1846, with a single-person wheeled sled running through a 13-foot (4 m) diameter vertical loop. These early single loop designs were called Centrifugal Railways.  In 1887, a French entrepreneur, [[Joseph Oller]], the owner of the [[Moulin Rouge]] music  hall,  built ''Les Montagnes Russes à Belleville'' (''The Russian Mountains of Belleville'')  a permanent  roller coaster with a length of two hundred meters in the form of a double-eight, later enlarged to four figure-eight-shaped loops.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

[[Image:Mount Pisgah plane looking up.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Mount Pisgah with the [[Mauch Chunk Switchback Railway]].]]

===Scenic railways===
In the 1850s, a mining company in [[Summit Hill, Pennsylvania]], constructed the [[Mauch Chunk Switchback Railway|Mauch Chunk]] [[gravity railroad]], a brakeman-controlled, 8.7-mile (14&amp;nbsp;km) downhill track used to deliver coal to Mauch Chunk (now known as [[Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania|Jim Thorpe]]), [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ultimaterollercoaster.com/coasters/history/start/america.shtml Roller Coaster History: Early Years In America]. Retrieved 26 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; By 1872, the "Gravity Road" (as it became known) was selling rides to thrill seekers. Railway companies used similar tracks to provide amusement on days when ridership was low.
[[Image:Thompsons Switchback Railway 1884.jpg|thumb|150px|Thompson's [[Switchback Railway]], 1884.]] 

Using this idea as a basis, [[LaMarcus Adna Thompson]] began work on a gravity [[Switchback Railway]] that opened at [[Coney Island]] in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]] in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Sheedy |title= Icons&amp;nbsp;— In the Beginning...

Urbanowicz (2002). ''The Roller Coaster Lover's Companion''.  Kensington, New York: Citadel Press. 4. {{ISBN|0-8065-2309-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1885, Phillip Hinkle introduced the first complete-circuit coaster with a [[lift hill]], the ''Gravity Pleasure Road'', which became the most popular attraction at Coney Island.&lt;ref name="Urbanowicz"/&gt; Not to be outdone, in 1886 LaMarcus Adna Thompson patented his design for a roller coaster that included dark tunnels with painted scenery. "Scenic Railways" were soon found in amusement parks across the county,&lt;ref name="Urbanowicz"/&gt; with [[Frederick Ingersoll]]'s construction company building many of them in the first two decades of the 20th century.

===Growing popularity and innovations===
[[File:Coneyisland1906.jpg|thumb|[[Loop the Loop (Coney Island)|Loop the Loop]], an early looping roller coaster at Coney Island, 1906]]
As it grew in popularity, experimentation in coaster dynamics took off. In the 1880s the concept of a vertical loop was again explored by [[Lina Beecher]], and in 1895 the concept came into fruition with the ''[[Flip Flap Railway]]'', located at [[Sea Lion Park]] in Brooklyn, and shortly afterward with ''[[Loop the Loop (Olentangy Park)|Loop the Loop]]'' at [[Olentangy Park]] near [[Columbus, Ohio]] as well as similar coasters in [[Loop the Loop (Young's Million Dollar Pier)|Atlantic City]] and [[Loop the Loop (Coney Island)|Coney Island]]. The rides were incredibly dangerous, and many passengers suffered [[Whiplash (medicine)|whiplash]]. Both were soon dismantled, and looping coasters had to wait for over a half century before making a reappearance.

By 1919, the first [[underfriction]] roller coaster had been developed by [[John Miller (entrepreneur)|John Miller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patimg2.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=01319888&amp;PageNum=&amp;Rtype=&amp;SectionNum=&amp;idkey=NONE&amp;Input=View+first+page|title=Patent Images|website=patimg2.uspto.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, roller coasters spread to amusement parks all around the world. Perhaps the best known historical roller coaster, ''[[Coney Island Cyclone|The Cyclone]]'', was opened at [[Coney Island]] in 1927. Like ''The Cyclone'', all early roller coasters were made of wood. Many old [[wooden roller coaster]]s are still operational, at parks such as [[Kennywood]] near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and [[Pleasure Beach Blackpool]], England. The oldest operating roller coaster is ''[[Leap-The-Dips]]'' at [[Lakemont Park]] in Pennsylvania, a [[side friction roller coaster]] built in 1902. The oldest wooden roller coaster in the [[United Kingdom]] is the ''Scenic Railway'' at [[Dreamland Margate|Dreamland]] Amusement Park in [[Margate]], [[Kent]] and features a system where the brakeman rides the car with wheels. It was severely damaged by fire on April 7, 2008, but was subsequently restored and reopened to the public in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/7335519.stm Retrieved on 8th April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; ''Scenic Railway'' at [[Melbourne's Luna Park]] built in 1912, is the world's oldest continually-operating roller coaster, and it also still features a system where the brakeman rides the car with wheels. One of only 13 remaining examples of John Miller's work worldwide is the wooden roller coaster at Lagoon in Utah.  The coaster opened in 1921 and is the 6th oldest coaster in the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aceonline.org/CoasterAwards/details.aspx?id=46&lt;/ref&gt;

The Great Depression marked the end of the golden age of roller coasters, as amusement parks generally went into a decline that resulted in less demand for new coasters. This lasted until 1972, when ''[[Racer (Kings Island)|The Racer]]'' opened at [[Kings Island]] amusement park located in what was then a part of [[Deerfield Township, Warren County, Ohio|Deerfield Township]] in [[Warren County, Ohio]]. Designed by [[John C. Allen]], the instant success of ''The Racer'' helped to ignite a renaissance for roller coasters, reviving worldwide interest throughout the industry.

===The rise of steel===
[[Image:MatterhornBobsled2000 wb.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Matterhorn Bobsleds]], the world's first tubular [[steel roller coaster]].]]
In 1959, the [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]] theme park introduced a new design breakthrough in roller coasters with the ''[[Matterhorn Bobsleds]]''. This was the first roller coaster to use a tubular [[Steel roller coaster|steel track]]. Unlike conventional wooden rails, which are generally formed using steel strips mounted on laminated wood, tubular steel can be bent in any direction, which allows designers to incorporate loops, corkscrews, and many other maneuvers into their designs. Most modern roller coasters are made of steel, although wooden roller coasters are still being built along with hybrids of steel and wood.

In 1975 the first modern-day roller coaster to perform an inverting element opened: [[Corkscrew (Silverwood)|Corkscrew]], located at [[Knott's Berry Farm]] in [[Buena Park, California|Buena Park]], [[California]]. In 1976 the vertical loop made a permanent comeback with the [[The New Revolution (roller coaster)|Great American Revolution]] at [[Six Flags Magic Mountain|Magic Mountain]] in [[Valencia, California|Valencia]], California.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1860">'''Institute de Nanotechnologie de Lyon''' (INL) or the '''Lyon Institute of Nanotechnology''' is a fundamental and applied research laboratory in the field of micro- and nano-technology based in [[Lyon, France]]. Its mission is to conduct research towards the development of full-fledged technologies for a broad range of application sectors ([[semiconductors]] and [[micro-electronics]], [[telecommunication]], [[energy]], health, biology, industrial control, defence, environment). 

The research programs draw on the resources of the Lyon-based Nanolyon technology platform.

A transversal research operation is specifically dedicated to the development of Nanocharacterization tools and techniques. 

The laboratory is situated on the campuses of Ecole Centrale de Lyon, INSA Lyon, University of Lyon 1 and CPE. It comprises 120 permanent staff and approximately 95 non-permanent staff. The annual budget excluding salaries is about 3M€.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inl.cnrs.fr// |title=INL Lyon |publisher=inl.cnrs.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The management team is made up of Guy Hollinger (director), G. Guillot (vice-director for the INSA site), P. Morin (vice-director for the UL1 site) and Ian O'Connor (vice-director for the ECL site). 

Under the auspices of the CNRS, INL is actively seeking excellent quality "CR2"- and "CR1"-level candidates to contribute or lead scientific and technological research in the following high-priority fields:
* Integration of new electronic and photonic functions on Silicon (material, devices and systems issues).
* [[Sensors]], Microsystems and [[Sensor networks]] for health
* 3rd generation [[Photovoltaics]]
* Bottom up [[nanotechnologies]] and nanobiotechnologies.

Ward received her A.B. from [[Bryn Mawr College]] in 1923 and her Ph.D from Bryn Mawr College in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.brynmawr.edu/cs/history|title=History {{!}} Bryn Mawr College|website=www.brynmawr.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== [[World War II]] ==
Dr. Ward joined the cryptologic service during WWII and worked for the Signal Security Agency (the Army's cryptologic organization). She also worked as a librarian and eventually built a collection of classified and unclassified materials for use by analysts. In 1945 she became the deputy chief of the reference section. Within a few years, she turned the section into one that was known as poorly organized, into a section that was widely recognized and highly respected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vFYRDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT430&amp;lpg=PT430&amp;dq=Julia+Ward+NSA&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5XAGS2slBJ&amp;sig=kKUze03HNpORwObn2MZbXMAUbls&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjyxI6w3evcAhWPFXwKHa06BP84ChDoATAEegQIBhAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Julia%20Ward%20&amp;f=false|title=Code Girls: The Untold Story of the American Women Code Breakers of World War II|last=Mundy|first=Liza|date=2017-10-10|publisher=Hachette Books|isbn=9780316352550|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1949, Dr. Ward was named head of the Collateral Branch, thereby becoming the only female branch head in the Office of Operations. 

Later, in 1955 Dr. Ward, was promoted to deputy chief of NSA's Liaison and Foreign Operations Section.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Korea Institute for Advanced Study''' (KIAS) is an advanced research institute in [[Korea]]. It is located on a {{convert|30|acre|m2|sing=on}} campus in [[Dongdaemun-gu]], [[Seoul]].&lt;ref&gt;Contact,"Visitor Information,  KIAS"[http://www.kias.re.kr/sub06/sub06_08.jsp], KIAS,2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

KIAS was founded in 1996, aiming to become a world's leading research institute where international elite scholars gather and dedicate to fundamental research in [[basic research|basic sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;Mission Statement,"About KIAS,  KIAS"[http://www.kias.re.kr/sub01/sub01_02.jsp], KIAS,2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, there are three schools in the institute: mathematics, physics, and computational sciences. As of 2016, the institute has 3 distinguished professors, 26 professors, and 133 research fellows. &lt;ref&gt;About the Institute,"About KIAS, KIAS"[http://www.kias.re.kr/sub01/sub01_01.jsp], KIAS,2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

As its name suggests, this institute was founded modeled on [[Institute for Advanced Study|IAS]] in Princeton, New Jersey (USA), although unlike its original, KIAS is funded by the government. KIAS is a subordinate institute of [[KAIST]] (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology).&lt;ref name=kaiskaist&gt;[http://naver.nanet.go.kr:8080/dl/CommonView.php?u=gQSBdJFUDv86YDEBTZWJYjn%2F3zVCSr1MxWk5WDi7%2BmnBFnskt%2BMHMJYtG68GMRC3d0QDUcaGIGPw7Yl11smJnw%3D%3D 고등과학원 설립 및 운영계획 수립을 위한 조사 연구, 1996(최종보고서), 과학기술처, 국회전자도서관 DB 자료] {{ko icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Looking Backward: 2000–1887''''' is a [[utopia]]n [[science fiction]] novel by [[Edward Bellamy]], a journalist and writer from [[Chicopee Falls, Massachusetts]]; it was first published in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/bellamy_edward Edward Bellamy in [[Encyclopedia of science fiction]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the third-largest bestseller of its time, after ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' and ''[[Ben-Hur (novel)|Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ]]''.&lt;ref name = "qlfjpt"&gt;Edward Bellamy, ''Looking Backward 2000-1887'', with a Foreword by [[Erich Fromm]], Signet, 1960. {{ISBN|0-451-52412-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It influenced a large number of intellectuals, and appears by title in many [[socialism|socialist]] writings of the day. "It is one of the few books ever published that created almost immediately on its appearance a political mass movement".&lt;ref&gt;See Fromm's Foreword to ''Looking Backward'', p. vi.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States alone, over 162 [[Nationalist Clubs|"Bellamy Clubs"]] sprang up&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.academia.edu/5280831/Utopian_Dreamers_-_Edward_Bellamy_And_The_Canadian_Context |title=Utopian Dreamers - Edward Bellamy And The Canadian Context |first=Matthew |last=Vasilev |type=Undergraduate research paper |publisher=McGill University |date=2012 |accessdate=26 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to discuss and propagate the book's ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bellamy|first=Edward|title=Looking backward: 2000-1887|year=2000|publisher=Signet|page=Introduction}} Walter James Miller confirms "more than 162 Bellamy Clubs".&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to its commitment to the [[nationalization]] of private property and the desire to avoid use of the term "socialism", this political movement came to be known as Nationalism — not to be confused with the political concept of [[nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Edward Bellamy.

''The Eclectic Magazine of Foreign Literature (1844–1898)''; Vol. 52, No. 3 (September 1890); p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt; The novel also inspired several [[Commune (intentional community)|utopian communities]].

==Publication history==

The decades of the 1870s and the 1880s were marked by economic and social turmoil, including the [[Long Depression]] of 1873–1879, a series of [[recession]]s during the 1880s, the rise of [[trade union|organized labor]] and [[strike action|strikes]], and the 1886 [[Haymarket affair]] and its controversial aftermath.&lt;ref name=Bowman87&gt;Sylvia E. Bowman, ''The Year 2000: A Critical Biography of Edward Bellamy.'' New York: Bookman Associates, 1958; pp. 87–89.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, American capitalism's tendency towards concentration into ever larger and less competitive forms—[[monopoly|monopolies]], [[oligopoly|oligopolies]], and [[trust (business)|trusts]]—began to make itself evident, while emigration from Europe expanded the labor pool and caused wages to stagnate.&lt;ref name=Bowman87 /&gt; The time was ripe for new ideas about economic development which might ameliorate the current social disorder.

[[Edward Bellamy]] (1850–1898), a relatively unknown [[New England]]-born novelist with a history of concern with social issues,&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, ''The Year 2000,'' pg. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; began to conceive of writing an impactful work of visionary fiction shaping the outlines of a [[utopian socialism|utopian]] future, in which production and society were ordered for the smooth production and distribution of commodities to a regimented labor force. In this he was not alone — between 1860 and 1887, no fewer than 11 such works of fiction were produced in the United States by various authors dealing fundamentally with the questions of economic and social organization.&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, ''The Year 2000,'' pg. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bellamy's book, gradually planned throughout the 1880s, was completed in 1887 and taken to [[Boston]] publisher Benjamin Ticknor, who published a first edition of the novel in January 1888.&lt;ref name=Bowman115&gt;Bowman, ''The Year 2000,'' pg. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Initial sales of the book were modest and uninspiring, but the book did find a readership in the Boston area, including enthusiastic reviews by future Bellamyites [[Cyrus Field Willard]] of the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' and [[Sylvester Baxter]] of the ''Boston Herald.''

Shortly after publication, Ticknor's publishing enterprise, Ticknor and Company, was purchased by the larger Boston publisher, [[Houghton, Mifflin &amp; Co.]], and new publishing plates were created for the book.&lt;ref name=Bowman115 /&gt; Certain "slight emendations" were made to the text by Bellamy for this second edition, released by Houghton Mifflin in September 1889.&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, ''The Year 2000,'' pp. 115–116.&lt;/ref&gt;

In its second release, Bellamy's futuristic novel met with enormous popular success, with more than 400,000 copies sold in the United States alone by the time Bellamy's follow-up novel, ''Equality,'' was published in 1897.&lt;ref name=Bowman121&gt;Bowman, ''The Year 2000,'' pg. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Sales topped 532,000 in the USA by the middle of 1939.&lt;ref name=Bowman121 /&gt; The book gained an extensive readership in [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]], as well, with more than 235,000 copies sold there between its first release in 1890 and 1935.&lt;ref name=Bowman121 /&gt;

&lt;!--Andolfatto has all of the Chinese characters for the Chinese names--&gt;
The first version of the novel published in China, heavily edited for the tastes of Chinese readers, was titled ''Huitou kan jilüe'' (回頭看記略). This text was later retitled ''Bainian Yi Jiao'' (百年一覺 ), or "A Sleep of 100 Years" and in 1891–1892 this version was serialized in ''[[Wanguo gongbao]]'';&lt;ref name=Andolfatto&gt;Andolfatto, Lorenzo.

The book remains in print in multiple editions, with one publisher alone having reissued the title in a printing of 100,000 copies in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Schiffman, "Introduction" to Edward Bellamy: ''Selected Writings on Religion and Society.'' New York: Liberal Arts Press, 1955; pg. xxxviii.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==

Bellamy's novel tells the story of a hero figure named Julian West, a young American, who towards the end of the 19th century, falls into a deep, hypnosis-induced sleep and wakes up 113 years later. He finds himself in the same location ([[Boston, Massachusetts]]), but in a totally changed world: It is the year 2000, and while he was sleeping, the United States has been transformed into a [[socialist]] utopia. The remainder of the book outlines Bellamy's thoughts about improving the future. The major themes include problems associated with capitalism, a proposed socialist solution of a nationalization of all industry, and the use of an "industrial army" to organize production and distribution, as well as how to ensure free cultural production under such conditions.

The young man readily finds a guide, Doctor Leete, who shows him around and explains all the advances of this new age, including drastically reduced working hours for people performing menial jobs and almost instantaneous, Internet-like delivery of goods. Everyone retires with full benefits at age 45, and may eat in any of the public kitchens. The productive capacity of the United States is nationally owned, and the goods of society are equally distributed to its citizens. A considerable portion of the book is dialogue between Leete and West wherein West expresses his confusion about how the future society works and Leete explains the answers using various methods, such as metaphors or direct comparisons with 19th-century society.

Although Bellamy's novel did not discuss technology or the economy in detail, commentators frequently compare ''Looking Backward'' with actual economic and technological developments. For example, Julian West is taken to a store which (with its descriptions of cutting out the middleman to cut down on waste in a similar way to the [[consumers' cooperative]]s of his own day based on the ''[[Rochdale Principles]]'' of 1844) somewhat resembles a modern [[warehouse club]] like BJ's, Costco, or Sam's Club. He additionally introduces a concept of "credit" cards in chapters 9, 10, 11, 13, 25, and 26, but these actually function like modern [[debit card]]s. All citizens receive an equal amount of "credit". Those with more difficult, specialized, dangerous, or unpleasant jobs work fewer hours (in contrast to the real-world practice of paying them more for their efforts of, presumably, the same hours). Bellamy also predicts both sermons and music being available in the home through [[cable radio|cable "telephone"]] (already demonstrated but commercialized only in 1890 as [[Théâtrophone]] in France).

Despite the "ethical" character of his socialism (though he was initially reluctant to use the term "socialism"), Bellamy's ideas somewhat reflect classical [[Marxism]]. In chapter 19, for example, he has the new legal system explained. Most civil suits have ended in socialism, while crime has become a medical issue. The idea of [[atavism]], then current, is employed to explain crimes not related to inequality (which Bellamy thinks will vanish with socialism). Remaining criminals are medically treated. One professional judge presides, appointing two colleagues to state the prosecution and defense cases. If all do not agree on the verdict, then it must be tried over. Chapters 15 and 16 have an explanation of how free, independent public art and news outlets could be provided in a more [[libertarian socialist]] system. In one case, Bellamy even writes, "the nation is the sole employer and capitalist".

== Precursors ==

Though Bellamy tended to stress the independence of his work, ''Looking Backward'' shares relationships and resemblances with several earlier works—most notably the anonymous ''[[The Great Romance]]'' (1881), [[John Macnie]]'s ''[[The Diothas]]'' (1883),&lt;ref&gt;Arthur E. Morgan, ''Edward Bellamy'', New York, Columbia University Press, 1944.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Laurence Gronlund]]'s ''The Co-operative Commonwealth'' (1884), and [[August Bebel]]'s ''Woman in the Past, Present, and Future'' (1886).&lt;ref&gt;Arthur E. Morgan, ''Plagiarism in Utopia: A Study of the Continuity of the Utopian Tradition With Special Reference to Edward Bellamy's "Looking Backward"'', Yellow Springs, Ohio, privately printed, 1944.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in ''The True Author of Looking Backward'' (1890) J. B. Shipley argued that Bellamy's novel was a repeat of Bebel's arguments, while literary critic R. L. Shurter went so far as to argue that "''Looking Backward'' is actually a fictionalized version of ''The Co-operative Commonwealth'' and little more".&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Shurter, ''The Utopian Novel in America, 1865–1900'', New York, AMS Press, 1975; p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Bellamy's book also bears resemblances to the early socialist theorists or 'utopian socialists' [[Étienne Cabet|Etienne Cabet]], [[Charles Fourier]], [[Robert Owen]], and [[Henri Saint-Simon]], as well as to the 'Associationism' of [[Albert Brisbane]] whom Bellamy had met in the 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Guarneri, ''The Utopian Alternative, Fourierism in Nineteenth-Century America'', (Cornell University Press, Ithaca, 1991), p. 368, p. 401&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reaction and sequels ==
{{main|List of sequels to Looking Backward}}

On publication, ''Looking Backward'' was praised by both the [[American Federation of Labor]] and the [[Knights of Labor]].&lt;ref name="rew"&gt;Robert E. Weir, ''Workers in America: A Historical Encyclopedia''.Santa Barbara, Calif. : ABC-CLIO, ©2013 {{ISBN|1598847198}} (p. 68-70).&lt;/ref&gt; Many members of the Knights read ''Looking Backward'' and also joined Bellamy's Nationalist clubs.&lt;ref name="rew" /&gt; ''Looking Backward'' was also praised by [[Daniel De Leon]], [[Elizabeth Gurley Flynn]] and [[Upton Sinclair]].&lt;ref name="rew" /&gt;

In 1897, Bellamy wrote a sequel, ''[[Equality (book)|Equality]]'', dealing with women's rights, education, and many other issues. Bellamy wrote the sequel to elaborate and clarify many of the ideas merely touched upon in ''Looking Backward''.

The success of ''Looking Backward'' provoked a spate of sequels, parodies, satires, dystopian, and 'anti-utopian' responses.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Pfaelzer,''The Utopian Novel in America, 1886–1896: The Politics of Form'', Pittsburgh, University of Pittsburgh Press; pp. 78–94 and 170–3.&lt;/ref&gt; A partial list of these follows.&lt;ref&gt;This list was derived from G. Claeys ''Late Victorian Utopias: A Prospective'', (Pickering and Chatto, London, 2008), J. Pfaelzer, ''The Utopian Novel in America 1886–1896: The Politics of Form'', (University of Pittsburgh Press, Pittsburgh, 1984), K.

The result was a "battle of the books" that lasted through the rest of the 19th century and into the 20th. The back-and-forth nature of the debate is illustrated by the subtitle of Geissler's 1891 ''Looking Beyond'', which is "A Sequel to 'Looking Backward' by Edward Bellamy and an Answer to 'Looking Forward' by Richard Michaelis".

The book was translated into [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] in 1892. In 1900 Bellamy personally approved a request by Bulgarian author [[Iliya Yovchev]] to make an "adapted translation" based on the realities of [[Bulgaria]]n social order. The resulting work, titled ''The Present as Seen by Our Descendants And a Glimpse at the Progress of the Future'' ("Настоящето, разгледано от потомството ни и надничане в напредъка на бъдещето"), generally followed the same plot. The events in Yovchev's version take place in an [[environmentally friendly]] [[Sofia]] and describe the country's unique path of adapting to the new social order. It is considered by local critics to be the first Bulgarian utopian work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chitanka.info/text/20938-nachaloto|title=The Beginning|author=Ivaylo Runchev|publisher=Narodna Mladezh|year=1985|accessdate=1 July 2013|quote=Фактически налице е произведение, отличаващо се от оригинала дотолкова, че следва да се говори за нов роман, първия ни български утопичен роман. ("Basically this work differs from the original to such an extent, that we can consider it a new novel, the first Bulgarian Utopian novel.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Morris]]'s [[1890 in literature|1890]] utopia ''[[News from Nowhere]]'' was partly written in reaction to Bellamy's utopia, which Morris did not find congenial.

Beyond the purely literary sphere, Bellamy's descriptions of utopian [[urban planning]] had a practical influence on [[Ebenezer Howard]]'s founding of the [[garden city movement]] in England, and on the design of the [[Bradbury Building]] in [[Los Angeles]].
[[Image:Edward Bellamy 2000 1887.jpg|thumb|German Reclam edition 1919]]
During the [[Great railroad strike of 1877|Great Strikes of 1877]], [[Eugene V. Debs]] opposed the strikes and argued that there was no essential necessity for the conflict between capital and labor. Debs was influenced by Bellamy's book to turn to a more [[socialist]] direction. He soon helped to form the [[American Railway Union]]. With supporters from the [[Knights of Labor]] and from the immediate vicinity of Chicago, workers at the Pullman Palace Car Company went on strike in June 1894. This came to be known as the [[Pullman Strike]].

The book had a specific and intense reception in Wilhelminian Germany including various parodies and sequels, from [[Eduard Loewenthal]], [[Ernst Müller]] and [[Philipp Wasserburg]], [[Konrad Wilbrandt]] and [[Richard Michaelis]].&lt;ref&gt;(Edward Bellamy, ''Ein Rückblick aus dem Jahre 2000 auf das Jahr 1887'', Translation Georg von Gizycki, editor Wolfgang Biesterfeld. Philipp Reclam jun., Stuttgart 1983 {{ISBN|3-15-002660-1}} (Universal-Bibliothek 2660 [4]), Afterword of Biesterfeld, p.301f.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s, there was a revival of interest in ''Looking Backward''. Several groups were formed to promote the book's ideas. The largest was Edward Bellamy Association of New York; its honorary members included [[John Dewey]], [[Heywood Broun]] and [[Roger N. Baldwin]]. &lt;ref name="aem"&gt; Aaron D. Purcell, ''Arthur Morgan: A Progressive Vision for American Reform''. University of Tennessee Press, 2014 {{ISBN|9781621900580}} (p. 214-9)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur Ernest Morgan]], chairman of the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]], also admired the book and wrote the first biography of Bellamy.&lt;ref name="aem" /&gt;

''Looking Backward'' influenced the novel ''[[Future of a New China]]'' by [[Liang Qichao]].&lt;ref name=DDWangTranslatingp309&gt;[[David Der-wei Wang|Wang, David D. W.]] "Translating Modernity."

''Looking Backward'' was rewritten in 1974 by American science fiction writer [[Mack Reynolds]] as ''Looking Backward from the Year 2000''. [[Matthew Kapell]], a historian and anthropologist, examined this re-writing in his essay, "Mack Reynolds' Avoidance of his own [[18 Brumaire|Eighteenth Brumaire]]: A Note of Caution for Would-Be Utopians".

In 1984, Herbert Knapp and Mary Knapp's ''[[Red, White and Blue Paradise|Red, White and Blue Paradise: The American Canal Zone in Panama]]'' appeared. The book was in part a memoir of their careers teaching at fabled [[Balboa High School (Panama)|Balboa High School]], but also a re-interpretation of the [[Panama Canal Zone|Canal Zone]] as a creature of turn-of-the-century Progressivism, a workers' paradise. The Knapps used Bellamy's ''Looking Backward'' as their heuristic model for understanding Progressive ideology as it shaped the Canal Zone.

A one-act play, ''Bellamy's Musical Telephone,'' was written by Roger Lee Hall and premiered at Emerson College in Boston in 1988 on the centennial year of the novel's publication.  It was released as a DVD titled, "The Musical Telephone."

The '''Maria reactor''' is [[Poland]]'s second [[nuclear research reactor]] and the only one still in use. It is located at Świerk-[[Otwock]], near Warsaw and named in honor of [[Maria Skłodowska-Curie]]. It is the only reactor of Polish design.

Maria is a multifunctional research tool, with a notable application in production of [[radioisotope]]s, research with utilization of neutron beams, [[neutron therapy]], and [[neutron activation analysis]]. It operates about 4000 hours annually, usually in blocks of 100 hours.

==Technical description==
The technical details of the reactor are given in the references.&lt;ref&gt;"Reaktor Maria" at the website of the Polish Institute of Atomic Energy  (pl:Instytut Energii Atomowej) "POLATOM" [https://web.archive.org/web/20110228013041/http://www.cyf.gov.pl/reaktor_ang.html (English)] [http://www.iea.cyf.gov.pl/reaktor.html (Polish)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091221134737/http://www.iea.cyf.gov.pl/reaktor.html |date=2009-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=krzysztoszek-2007&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-pub.iaea.org/mtcd/meetings/PDFplus/2007/cn156/cn156presentations/cn156_Krzysztoszek.pdf |title=Maria research reactor conversion to LEU fuel |first=Grzegorz |last=Krzysztoszek |publisher=IAEA |work=Institute of Atomic Energy |year=2007 |accessdate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.cyf.gov.pl/nowa/annual_report_pdf/2008/Chapter_1.pdf |title=Operation of Maria Research Reactor |author1=G.

Maria is a [[pool reactor|pool type reactor]] with a power of 20 to 30 MW (thermal). Despite it being a pool reactor, it contains channels (aluminum tubes) individually connected to the primary coolant. The water pool provides cooling for elements (e.g., fuel elements) that are not otherwise cooled, and also acts as radiation shielding. Maria uses [[enriched uranium]] as fuel (80% enrichment in [[U-235|&lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U]] till year 1999; 36% since). The fuel elements and channels are vertical but arranged conically. Water and [[beryllium]] blocks serve as the moderator (70% and 30% of the moderation, respectively). Elements of [[boron carbide]] sheathed in aluminum are utilized for control, compensation, and safety. The use of beryllium blocks results in a comparatively large fuel lattice pitch, and consequently large volume for payload targets. There is also a [[graphite]] [[neutron reflector|reflector]] (aluminum sheathed). Maria supplies a [[neutron flux]] of 4x10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; n/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;s ([[thermal neutrons]]) and 2x10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; n/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;s ([[fast neutrons]]). There are six horizontal channels for controlled use of neutron beams. There is also a window of lead-containing glass through which the core can be viewed. The reactor is housed in a [[Containment building|sealed containment]].

Following preparation which started in 2004, Maria was converted to use [[Uranium enrichment#Low-enriched uranium (LEU)|low-enriched uranium]] (LEU) fuel by 2012.&lt;ref name=krzysztoszek-2007/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://nnsa.energy.gov/mediaroom/pressreleases/mariareactor092512 |title=NNSA Helps Poland Convert Reactor, Remove Highly Enriched Uranium |publisher=NNSA |date=25 September 2012 |accessdate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Construction began on June 16, 1970 and the reactor was activated on December 18, 1974. With the shutdown of the [[Ewa reactor]] in 1995 it became Poland's only research nuclear reactor.

==Production of medical radioisotopes==
In February 2010, it was announced that Maria will start producing [[medical isotopes]] in cooperation with [[Covidien]], to help ease the isotope shortages due to shutdowns of the Canadian [[National Research Universal Reactor|NRU reactor]] and the Dutch [[Petten nuclear reactor]].&lt;ref&gt;Adam Wawrzyński, "Reaktor Maria ratuje świat", "Gazeta Wyborcza", 2010-02-17 [http://wyborcza.pl/1,75476,7572615,Reaktor_Maria_ratuje_swiat.html (in Polish)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Wald, "Poland emerges as new source of rare medical isotope", [[International Herald Tribune]], 2010-02-18, p.2 [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/17/health/17isotope.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Marine Institute (Foras na Mara)''' is the national agency responsible to the Irish government for advice on and implementation of marine research, technology, development and innovation policy, and marine research services.  Its official vision is of &lt;br /&gt;''“A thriving maritime economy in harmony with the ecosystem and supported by the delivery of excellence in our services."''{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

==Locations==
The institute is headquartered at Rinville, near [[Oranmore]], [[County Galway]] while its [http://www.imdo.ie/imdo/, ''Irish Maritime Development Office (IMDO)''] is located in Harcourt Street, Dublin. The Marine Institute also operates an [[aquaculture]] and catchment management laboratory and office facility at Furnace, near [[Newport, County Mayo|Newport]], [[County Mayo]], as well as offices and laboratories in a number of Ireland's fishing ports.

==Vessels==
The Marine Institute oversees the operation of Ireland's two purpose-built research vessels, the [[RV Celtic Explorer]] and [http://www.marine.ie/home/services/researchvessels/explorer/ RV ''Celtic Explorer''] and the [http://www.marine.ie/home/services/researchvessels/ROV.htm Remotely Operated Vehicle, ''Holland 1''] as well as co-ordinating Sea Change – a seven-year Marine Knowledge, Research &amp; Innovation Strategy for Ireland 2007 – 2013.

==History==
[[Image:Marine Institute Headquarters Galway.jpg|thumb|The Marine Institute Headquarters [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfo6 jx5LZ0], Rinville, Oranmore, Galway, Ireland]]
Following the recommendation of the 1974 National Science Council report ''Ireland, Science and the Sea'', the Marine Institute was established by the Irish government under the Marine Institute Act of 1991
''to undertake, to co-ordinate, to promote and to assist in marine research and development and to provide such services that, in the opinion of the Institute will promote economic development and create employment and protect the marine environment''.

Starting with the appointment of its chief executive officer – Dr Peter Heffernan – followed by four Programme Managers in Marine Environment, Marine Food, Marine Technology and Marine Leisure and Tourism in 1995, the Marine Institute grew rapidly, to include the Irish Marine Data Centre and existing marine research facilities at Abbotstown, County Dublin and the Salmon Research Agency at Newport.

1998 saw the arrival of Ireland's first purpose-built research vessel, the 31-metre long [http://www.marine.ie/home/services/researchvessels/voyager/ RV ''Celtic Voyager'']. This was followed in 2000 by the announcement that the Institute would be moving from Dublin to new premises in Galway, and the arrival of the larger 65-metre deepwater research vessel [http://www.marine.ie/home/services/researchvessels/explorer/ RV ''Celtic Explorer''] in 2002. The [http://www.marine.ie/home/services/researchvessels/ROV.htm Deepwater Remotely Operated Vehicle, ''Holland 1''], was delivered in 2008.

2006 saw the Marine Institute move into its purpose-built headquarters and laboratory complex at Rinville, Oranmore, Galway. This building, which has won several architectural awards, houses 54 dedicated research laboratories, an auditorium capable of seating 150 people, a marine science library and an office crescent.

In 2006 the Institute also embarked on the planning and execution of Sea Change-A Marine Knowledge, Research &amp; Innovation Strategy for Ireland 2007–2013, aimed at applying state-of-the-art technology and innovation to the sustainable economic development of Ireland's oceans and seas in such a way as to increase their economic return from an annual €3 billion in 2007 to €4.5 billion by the end of the programme.

==Staff and structure==
The Marine Institute employs approximately 180 staff including specialists in fisheries, marine environment, technology, aquaculture, catchment management, ocean energy, functional foods and marine climate change, as well as experts in information technology, communications and logistical support.

The [http://www.marine.ie/home/aboutus/organisationstaff/OfficeoftheCEO.htm Office of the CEO] provides overall direction and co-ordination of foresight, strategic and research planning activities at national and international level. It works in association with the Marine Institute's five service areas and other national and international organisations.  The service areas are:

===Marine Environment and Food Safety Services (MEFS)===
[[Image:Environmental Food Symbol.jpg|thumb|Marine Environment and Food Safety Services(MEFS)Logo]]

Marine Environment &amp; Food Safety Services (MEFS) provides essential scientific advice and a range of marine [[environmental monitoring]] services to help ensure Irish [[seafood products]] meet approved standards. It also provides expert integrated advice to, and on behalf of, government departments and agencies, including the [http://www.agriculture.gov.ie/ Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine], [http://www.environ.ie/en/ Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government], and [http://www.dcenr.gov.ie/ the Department of Communications, Energy &amp; Natural Resources].

The [http://www.marine.ie/home/services/operational/fishhealth/ '''Fish Health Team'''] works with the marine food industry to protect the health status of Irish farmed salmon, trout and shellfish. The Fish Health Unit is the Irish National Reference Laboratory for finfish, mollusc and crustacean diseases. The team tests aquatic animal samples, as required under EU and national legislation, and supports the aquaculture industry and the inland fisheries sector in maintaining Ireland's superior fish and shellfish health status. The Fish Health Unit is also the National Competent Authority for the implementation of aquatic animal health legislation under EU and national legislation and monitors the movement of finfish and shellfish into and within Ireland.

[http://www.marine.ie/home/services/operational/seafood/ '''Food Safety Monitoring'''] ensures that Irish marine fish, shellfish and seafood products remain safe from elevated levels of residues and contaminants. The programmes in this area include monitoring of Irish fish, shellfish and seafood products to assure that they are safe from elevated levels of residues and contaminants. This complies with a range of EU Directives as well as with national requirements. The programme monitors naturally occurring species of plankton and the toxins they produce which can be concentrated in filter-feeding shellfish. This information is provided directly to the seafood industry to allow harvesting. Research is also carried out on developing new methods of testing for identifying emerging phytoplankton species and ensuring that they can be identified and analysed effectively, and also monitoring of microbiological contaminants in shellfish.

The Marine Institute runs a national [http://www.marine.ie/home/publicationsdata/data/Habs+Search+Database/ '''Harmful Algal Bloom (HABS)]''' monitoring service that warns producers and consumers of concentrations of toxic plankton in Irish coastal waters that could contaminate shellfish or cause fish deaths.

'''Environmental Monitoring''' is designed to assess levels, distribution and trends of man-made contaminants and naturally occurring biotoxins. Pollution may adversely affect the health of the seas and ultimately limit man's ability, or that of future generations, to use the seas as a sustainable resource.

The '''Aquaculture &amp; Rearing''' teams located in Galway and Newport provide research, monitoring, analyses and advice on finfish aquaculture, salmonid rearing and freshwater catchment studies. The team also implements the National Sea Lice Monitoring programme on behalf of the [http://www.agriculture.gov.ie/ Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine].

===Fisheries Ecosystems Advisory Services (FEAS)===
[[Image:Fisheries Symbol.jpg|thumb|Fisheries Science Services (FSS) Logo]]

The Fisheries Ecosystems Advisory Services unit researches, assesses and advises on the sustainable exploitation of the marine fisheries resources in the waters around Ireland, and on the impacts of fisheries on the ecosystem. Irish waters contain some of the most productive fishing grounds in the world. These waters are important fish spawning and nursery grounds and their [http://www.marine.ie/home/services/operational/fishstock/Biologically+Sensitive+Area.htm ‘Biological Sensitivity ’] is recognised internationally. To ensure the sustainable exploitation of this valuable fisheries resource and to protect the sensitive habitats in which they live, fisheries science is becoming a more 'broader based' science that will link into the concept of 'ocean management' and not just 'fisheries management'.

Linking fisheries data with '''oceanographic''', '''sea bed mapping''' and '''climate change data''', examining predator prey relationships, and interacting with stakeholders are all important components of a new form of 'ocean management advice' which comes under the umbrella of the 'ecosystem approach'. This approach considers all marine related activities such as fishing, gravel extraction and leisure use in a specific area (e.g. [[Irish Sea|the Irish Sea]]) and provides advice in this context. Much of the work of the unit in this area is also used as input to the Marine Strategy Framework Directive which seeks to ensure Ireland's marine area achieves a good environmental status by 2020.

Fisheries Ecosystems Advisory Services are charged with meeting Ireland's obligations under the EU Data Collection Framework. The Framework supports the scientific advice needed to underpin the Common Fisheries Policy. As such, the unit carries out [http://www.marine.ie/home/services/surveys/fisheries/ '''fisheries surveys'''] in the waters around Ireland using the research vessels [http://www.marine.ie/home/services/researchvessels/explorer/ RV ''Celtic Explorer''] &lt;br /&gt; and [http://www.marine.ie/home/services/researchvessels/voyager/ RV ''Celtic Voyager'']. These surveys collect extensive data for both national and international stock assessments of the main commercial species of fish and shellfish. Survey work is also conducted aboard commercial fishing vessels and unit staff collect data on the age and length profile of landings and examine fleet activity and fishing patterns. This information is used to produce the annual [http://www.marine.ie/home/publicationsdata/publications/The+Stock+Book/ '''‘Stock Book’'''] which is the primary source of scientific advice on marine fisheries to the Irish Government and the Industry and is used to support fisheries negotiations with the [[European Union]].

Participation in '''applied research projects''' is critical to the evolution of scientific advice. The unit's flagship research project is the Beaufort Ecosystem Project, that links the third level sector on a broad range of ecosystem projects including fisheries seal interactions, marine birds, cetaceans, size based modelling and stakeholder engagement. Unit staff are also co-supervising a range of PhD projects and are active partners in many EU funded research projects.

===Ocean Science and Information Services (OSIS)===
[[Image:Ocean Science Services Symbol.jpg|thumb|The Ocean Science Services (OSS) Logo]]

The Ocean Science and Information Services (OSIS) team provide support for national and international marine research programmes in a number of areas.

'''Research Vessel Operations''' manage the Marine Institute's research fleet, the ''RV Celtic Explorer'' and the ''RV Celtic Voyager'', and also manage the foreign research vessel notification process.&lt;br /&gt; The 65m long [http://www.marine.ie/home/services/researchvessels/explorer/''RV Celtic Explorer''] is a highly sophisticated low-noise multipurpose research vessel designed for undertaking a wide array of offshore and deep-sea survey operations. The [http://www.marine.ie/home/services/researchvessels/voyager/ ''RV Celtic Voyager''] is a 31.4m multipurpose vessel suited to coastal research and off shore survey operations. Both vessels are fully fitted with state-of-the-art scientific instrumentation, laboratories and IT equipment and are used for a variety of applications including fisheries research, environmental monitoring, seabed mapping, oceanology, seismic surveys, student training and meteorological investigations.

'''Advanced Mapping Service Group''' carries out routine hydrographic and geophysical mapping for the Irish National Seabed Survey, the Integrated Mapping for the Sustainable Development of Irelands Marine Resource [http://www.marine.ie/home/services/surveys/seabed/ (INFOMAR)] and benthic fisheries projects. The team has considerable expertise in Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and resource mapping, including aspects of aggregates exploration and marine pelagic and benthic habitat mapping.&lt;br /&gt; The Advanced Mapping Section also mobilises and carries out rig site geo hazard surveys, pipeline investigations and are an active partners in the Mapping of European Seabed Habitats Project [http://www.marine.ie/home/services/surveys/seabed/Mesh.htm (MESH)]; concentrating on development of habitat mapping tools. This section also has the tools and infrastructure that permits acquisition, processing and interpretation of large survey data sets.

[http://www.marine.ie/home/services/operational/oceanography/ '''Oceanography and Ocean Modelling'''] provide comprehensive oceanographic services, including the [http://www.marine.ie/home/publicationsdata/data/buoys/ National Weather Buoy Network] of five buoys around the Irish coast. The team is also involved in the establishment of an [http://www.marine.ie/home/services/operational/oceanography/TideGauge.htm Irish tide gauge network], ocean modelling, satellite remote sensing and oceanographic support of diverse seagoing research programmes related to marine fisheries and environment.

The '''Information Services &amp; Development''' team are responsible for the co-ordination of Marine Institute [http://www.marine.ie/home/publicationsdata/ data activities] and the provision of Information Technology infrastructure and information management for the Marine Institute.

The '''Advanced Marine Technology Programme''' is part of [https://web.archive.org/web/20080416014140/http://www.marine.ie/home/SeaChange.htm Sea Change], Ireland's marine research and innovation strategy. It seeks to create a critical mass, multi-disciplinary and industry-oriented research grouping in the area of advanced sensing, communications and informatics.

===The Irish Maritime Development Office (IMDO)===
[[Image:Marine Strategic Development Symbol.jpg|thumb|The Irish Maritime Development Office (IMDO) Logo]]

The [http://www.imdo.ie Irish Maritime Development Office (IMDO)] of the Marine Institute is Ireland's first dedicated development, promotional and marketing agency for the shipping services sector. The IMDO's statutory mandate is to promote and develop growth in the [http://www.marine.ie/home/Shipping.htm Irish Shipping industry], and to attract to Ireland additional marine related service sector operations along with key players in International Shipping and ancillary services.

The shipping services sector is the largest segment of the Irish Marine industrial base, employing over 8,000 people while also generating over €1.5 billion within the economy annually. As an island-based economy, maritime transport carries 99% by volume of all Irish trade, making this a strategically important industry.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

IMDO provides assistance to the Irish maritime industry and its consumers in its effort to maintain competitiveness in the International market place. The formulation and delivery of expert advice to Government is amongst the office's principal roles. The office also markets Ireland overseas as a dynamic European location for International shipping services to locate their operations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6767">In [[Social Science]], '''Methodological Nationalism''' is a term used to describe  an intellectual orientation and pattern in scholarly research that conceives of the nation-state as the sole unit of analysis or as a container for social processes. This term has been greatly developed by Andreas Wimmer and Nina Glick Schiller, who specifically define '''methodological nationalism''' as "understood as the assumption that the nation/state/society is the natural social and political form of the modern world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wimmer|first1=Andreas|last2=Schiller|first2=Nina Glick|title=Methodological nationalism and beyond: nation-state building, migration and the social sciences|journal=Global Networks 2|volume=2|issue=4|pages=301–334|url=http://www.suz.uzh.ch/dam/jcr:1296e4ec-3ca6-4efe-b083-163b9b649bab/Text_13.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methodological Nationalism has been identified in many social science subfields, such as [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], and the interdisciplinary field of [[migration studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wimmer|first1=Andreas|last2=Schiller|first2=Nina Glick|title=Methodological Nationalism, the Social Sciences, and the Study of Migration: An Essay in Historical Epistemology|journal=The International Migration Review|date=2003|volume=37|issue=2|pages=576–610|jstor=30037750}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methodological Nationalism, as a practice within Social Science, has been further critiqued by scholars such as [[Saskia Sassen]], who contends that the nation-state and its borders are an insufficient unit of analysis and that the national is at times the "terrains of the global".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sassen|first1=Saskia|title=The global inside the national A research agenda for sociology|url=http://www.saskiasassen.com/pdfs/publications/the-global-inside-the-national.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Three types of methodological nationalism ==

Per Andreas Wimmer and Nina Glick Schiller, there are three types of methodological nationalism in social science scholarship: ignoring or disregarding the importance of nationalism for modern societies, naturalization, and confining studies to geopolitical boundaries of a particular nation-state. These types may co-occur or occur separately. When they co-occur, they may reinforce each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wimmer|first1=Andreas|last2=Schiller|first2=Nina Glick|title=Methodological Nationalism, the Social Sciences, and the Study of Migration: An Essay in Historical Epistemology|journal=The International Migration Review|date=2003|volume=37|issue=2|pages=576–610|jstor=30037750}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodological Nationalism and Migration Studies ==

'''Methodological Nationalism''' and its conception of nation-states has been a component of both contemporary and historical methodologies in migration studies, insofar as certain studies have adhered to it or diverged from its theoretical foundations. This adherence has been acknowledged or otherwise criticized  in numerous studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mayall|first1=James|title=Nationalism and international society|date=1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge [England]|isbn=978-0521389617|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Anthony D.|title=Nationalism and modernism : a critical survey of recent theories of nations and nationalism|date=2001|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780415063418|edition=Reprinted.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the historical prevalence of '''methodological nationalism''' within social science has been explored by scholarship which argues that many turn-of-the-century writings on globalization have  "conflated the necessary
conceptual critique of methodological nationalism with the empirical claim of the

On the other hand, research on  [[transnationalism]] and [[transmigrants]] has contemporary examples of divergence and criticism of '''methodological nationalism''' as an enduring practice in scholarship. Recent studies in transnationalism have conceived of the nation-state as one agent in a complex relationship with many global actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Quayson|first1=Ato|last2=Daswani|first2=Girish|title=A Companion to Diaspora and Transnationalism|date=September 2013|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1-4051-8826-5|pages=600|url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-140518826X.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Migration Studies that conceive of society as extending beyond national boundaries, then, sever this link between nation-state and society.

Research on transnational Latina motherhood has negotiated issues of the nation-state as well as transnationalism. The conceptual frameworks of power geometries, social location, and geographic scales is positiojed to counteract the analytical tendency to fall back on methodological nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pessar |first= Patricia |title= Transnational Migration: Bringing Gender in |date=June 1971 |publisher= Center for Migration Studies of New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Boehm |first=Deborah |title="For My Children:" Constructing Family and Navigating the State in the U.S.-MexicoTransnation |date=Fall 2003 |publisher= George Washington University for Ethnographic Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholarly research has combined transnational migration studies and conceptual frameworks such as [[coloniality of power]] to avoid '''methodological nationalism''' and better account for the intersecting transnational phenomena that constitutes the experiences of [[transmigrants]] and better explains the processes of transnational migration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor= Cervantes-Rodríguez, Margarita |last2=Grosfoguel,|first2=Ramón |last=Mielants |first=Eric |title=Caribbean migration to Western Europe and the United States essays on incorporation, identity, and citizenship|date=2009|publisher=Temple University Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9781592139569}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Patel|first1=Sujata|title=Colonial Modernity and Methodological Nationalism in Sociology of India |website= vimeo.com/34815428}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Society for the History of Technology''', or '''SHOT''', is the primary professional society for historians of technology. SHOT was founded in 1958 in the United States, and it has since become an international society with members "from some thirty-five countries throughout the Americas, Europe, Asia, and Africa."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyoftechnology.org "Home," ''Society for the History of Technology (SHOT)'']&lt;/ref&gt; SHOT owes its existence largely to the efforts of Professor [[Melvin Kranzberg]] (1917-1995). SHOT co-founders include John B. Rae, [[Carl W. Condit]], [[Thomas P. Hughes]], and [[Eugene S. Ferguson]]. SHOT's flagship publication is the journal ''[[Technology and Culture]]'', published by the Johns Hopkins University Press. Kranzberg served as editor of ''Technology and Culture'' until 1981, and was succeeded as editor by Robert C. Post until 1995, and John M. Staudenmaier from 1996 until 2010. The current editor of ''Technology and Culture'' is Suzanne Moon at the University of Oklahoma. SHOT is an affiliate of the [[American Council of Learned Societies]] and the [[American Historical Association]] and publishes a joint booklet series with the AHA, "Historical Perspectives on Technology, Society, and Culture," under the co-editorship of [[Pamela O. Long]], Robert C. Post, and [[Asif Azam Siddiqi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyoftechnology.org/publications/booklets.html "Historical Perspectives," ''Society for the History of Technology (SHOT)'']&lt;/ref&gt; Pamela O. Long is the recipient of a [[MacArthur Fellows Program|MacArthur Foundation "Genius Grant"]] for 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/17/arts/macarthur-awards-go-to-21-diverse-fellows.html Felicia R. Lee, "MacArthur Awards Go to 21 Diverse Fellows," ''New York Times'', September 17, 2014,]&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of technology was traditionally linked to economic history and history of science, but its interactions are now equally strong with environmental history, gender history, business history, and labor history. SHOT annually awards two book prizes, the Edelstein Prize and the [https://www.historyoftechnology.org/about-us/awards-prizes-and-grants/the-sally-hacker-prize/ Sally Hacker Prize], as well as the Kranzberg Dissertation Fellowship and the Brooke Hindle Postdoctoral Fellowship.  Its highest award is the [[Leonardo da Vinci Medal]]. Recipients of the medal include Kranzberg, Ferguson, Post, Staudenmaier, Bart Hacker, and Brooke Hindle. In 1968 Kranzberg was also instrumental in the founding of a sister society, the International Committee for the History of Technology ([[ICOHTEC]]) in 1968. The two societies complement each other.

The Society for the History of Technology is dedicated to the historical study of technology and its relations with politics, economic, labor, business, the environment, public policy, science, and the arts. The society now numbers around 1500 members, and holds its meeting at a non-North-American venue every third year. SHOT also sponsors smaller conferences focused on specialized topics, often jointly with other scholarly societies and organizations.

The '''sociology of health and illness''', alternatively the '''sociology of health and wellness''' (or simply '''health sociology'''), examines the interaction between [[society]] and [[health]]. The objective of this topic is to see how social life affects [[morbidity]] and [[mortality rate]], and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;Timmermans, Stefan &amp; Steven Haas. Towards a sociology of disease. ''Sociology of Health and Illness'', Vol. 30, No. 5, pp. 659-676: 2008&lt;/ref&gt; This aspect of sociology differs from [[medical sociology]] in that this branch of sociology discusses [[health]] and [[illness]] in relation to social institutions such as [[family]], [[employment]], and [[school]]. The sociology of [[medicine]] limits its concern to the patient-practitioner relationship and the role of health professionals in society.&lt;ref name="Conrad"&gt;{{cite book| last = Conrad| first = Peter| title = The Sociology of Health and Illness Critical Perspectives| url = https://books.google.com/?id=wYKWr2N19CgC| year = 2008| publisher = [[Macmillan Publishers]]| isbn = 978-1-4292-0558-0| pages = 1–55 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sociology of health and illness covers sociological pathology (causes of disease and illness), reasons for seeking particular types of medical aid, and patient compliance or noncompliance with medical regimes.&lt;ref name=Conrad/&gt;

Health, or lack of health, was once merely attributed to biological or natural conditions. Sociologists have demonstrated that the spread of diseases is heavily influenced by the socioeconomic status of individuals, ethnic traditions or beliefs, and other cultural factors.&lt;ref name=White/&gt; Where medical research might gather statistics on a disease, a sociological perspective on an illness would provide insight on what external factors caused the demographics who contracted the disease to become ill.&lt;ref name="White"&gt;{{cite book| last = White| first = Kevin| title = An introduction to the sociology of health and illness| url = https://books.google.com/?id=eZSmngEACAAJ| year = 2002| publisher = SAGE Publishing| isbn = 978-0-7619-6400-1| pages = 4–5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This topic requires a global approach of analysis because the influence of societal factors varies throughout the world. This will be demonstrated through discussion of the major diseases of each continent. These diseases are sociologically examined and compared based on the [[traditional medicine]], [[economics]], [[religion]], and [[culture]] that is specific to each region. [[HIV/AIDS]] serves as a common basis of comparison among regions. While it is extremely problematic in certain areas, in others it has affected a relatively small percentage of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://data.unaids.org/pub/GlobalReport/2008/jc1510_2008_global_report_pp211_234_en.pdf |title=HIV and AIDS estimates and data |year=2007 |publisher=World Health Organization |pages=214–233 |accessdate=Dec 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociological factors can help to explain why these discrepancies exist.

There are obvious differences in patterns of health and illness across societies, over time, and within particular society types. There has historically been a long-term decline in mortality within [[industrialized]] societies, and on average, life-expectancies are considerably higher in [[developed]], rather than developing or [[undeveloped]], societies.&lt;ref name= Marshall/&gt; Patterns of global change in health care systems make it more imperative than ever to [[research]] and comprehend the sociology of health and illness. Continuous changes in economy, [[therapy]], [[technology]] and [[insurance]] can affect the way individual communities view and respond to the medical care available. These rapid fluctuations cause the issue of health and illness within social life to be very dynamic in definition&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018.

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.11.037 &lt;/ref&gt;. Advancing information is vital because as patterns evolve, the study of the sociology of health and illness constantly needs to be updated.&lt;ref name=Conrad/&gt;

==Historical background==
[[File:Akmanthor.jpg|thumb|Wall painting found in the tomb of an Egyptian official known as the physicians tomb]]
Humans have long sought advice from those with knowledge or skill in [[healing]]. [[Paleopathology]] and other historical records, allow an examination of how ancient societies dealt with illness and [[outbreak]]. Rulers in Ancient Egypt sponsored physicians that were specialists in specific diseases.&lt;ref name=Porter/&gt; [[Imhotep]] was the first medical doctor known by name. An Egyptian who lived around 2650&amp;nbsp;B.C., he was an adviser to King Zoser at a time when Egyptians were making progress in medicine. Among his contributions to medicine was a textbook on the treatment of wounds, broken bones, and even [[tumors]].&lt;ref&gt;Saari, Peggy. "Medicine And Disease - Who Was The First Doctor In History?." History Fact Finder. Ed. Julie L. Carnagie. UXL-GALE, 2001. eNotes.com. 2006. 2 Nov, 2009 [http://www.enotes.com/history-fact-finder/medicine-disease/who-was-first-doctor-history eNotes]&lt;/ref&gt;

Stopping the spread of infectious disease was of utmost importance for maintaining a healthy society.&lt;ref name="Porter"&gt;{{cite book| last = Porter| first = Dorothy| title = Health, Civilization, and the state a history of public health from ancient to modern times| year = 1999| publisher = Routledge| location = New York NY| isbn = 978-0-415-12244-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The outbreak of [[disease]] during the [[Peloponnesian War]] was recorded by [[Thucydides]] who survived the [[epidemic]]. From his account it is shown how factors outside the disease itself can affect society. The Athenians were under siege and concentrated within the city. Major city centers were the hardest hit.&lt;ref name="Littman"&gt;{{cite journal|title= The Plague of Athens: Epidemiology and Paleopathology|last= Littman|first= Robert J.|year= 2009|publisher= Mount Sinai Journal of Medicine, Vol. 76, pp. 456-467.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This made the outbreak even more deadly and with probable food shortages the fate of [[Athens]] was inevitable.&lt;ref name=Littman/&gt; Approximately 25% of the population died of the [[disease]].&lt;ref name=Littman/&gt; Thucydides stated that the [[epidemic]] "carried away all alike". The [[disease]] attacked people of different ages, sexes and nationalities.&lt;ref name=Littman/&gt;
[[File:Medicine aryballos Louvre CA1989-2183.jpg|thumb|Physician in [[Ancient Greece]] treating a patient 480–470 BC]]

Ancient medical systems stressed the importance of reducing illness through [[divination]] and ritual.&lt;ref name=Porter/&gt; Other codes of behavior and dietary protocols were widespread in the ancient world.&lt;ref name=Porter/&gt; During the [[Zhou Dynasty]] in China, doctors suggested exercise, meditation and [[temperance (virtue)|temperance]] to preserve one's health.&lt;ref name=Porter/&gt; The Chinese closely link health with spiritual well-being. Health regimes in ancient [[India]] focused on oral health as the best method for a healthy life.&lt;ref name=Porter/&gt; The  [[Talmud|Talmudic code]] created rules for health which stressed ritual cleanliness, connected disease with certain animals and created diets.&lt;ref name=Porter/&gt; Other examples include the [[Mosaic Code]] and [[Roman baths]] and [[Roman aqueduct|aqueducts]].&lt;ref name=Porter/&gt;

Those that were most concerned with health, sanitation and illness in the ancient world were those in the elite class.&lt;ref name=Porter/&gt; Good health was thought to reduce the risk of spiritual defilement and therefore enhanced the social status of the ruling class who saw themselves as the beacon of civilization.&lt;ref name=Porter/&gt; During the late Roman Period, sanitation for the lower classes was a concern for the leisured class.&lt;ref name=Porter/&gt; Those that had the means would donate to charities that focused on the health of non-elites.&lt;ref name=Porter/&gt; After the decline of the [[Roman Empire]], physicians and concern with public health disappeared except in the largest cities.&lt;ref name=Porter/&gt; Health and public doctors remained in the [[Byzantine Empire]].&lt;ref name=Porter/&gt; Focusing on preventing the spread of diseases such as [[small pox]] lead to a smaller mortality rate in much of the western world.&lt;ref name=Porter/&gt; Other factors that allowed the modern rise in population include: better nutrition and environmental reforms (such as getting clean water supplies).&lt;ref name=Porter/&gt;

The present day sense of health being a public concern for the state began in the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name="Lindemann"&gt;{{cite book| last = Lindemann| first = Mary| title = Medicine and Society in Early Modern Europe| year = 1999| publisher = Cambridge University Press| location = Cambridge| isbn = 978-0-521-41254-4| pages = 155–159 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A few state interventions include maintaining clean towns, enforcing quarantines during [[epidemics]] and supervising sewer systems.&lt;ref name=Lindemann/&gt; Private corporations also played a role in public health. The funding for research and the institutions for them to work were funded by governments and private firms.&lt;ref name=Lindemann/&gt; Epidemics were the cause of most government interventions. The early goal of public health was [[reactionary]] whereas the modern goal is to prevent disease before it becomes a problem.&lt;ref name=Lindemann/&gt; Despite the overall improvement of world health, there still has not been any decrease in the health gap between the affluent and the impoverished.&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;{{cite book| author3 = David Field| last1 = Taylor| first1 = Steve| last2 = Field| first2 = David| title = Sociology of Health and Health Care| url = https://books.google.com/?id=0OPjngEACAAJ| year = 2007| publisher = Wiley-Blackwell| location = Oxford, England| isbn = 978-1-4051-5172-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, society is more likely to blame health issues on the individual rather than society as a whole. This was the prevailing view in the late 20th century.&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; In the 1980s the [[Black Report]], published in the United Kingdom, went against this view and argued that the true root of the problem was material deprivation.&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; This report proposed a comprehensive anti-poverty strategy to address these issues.&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; Since this did not parallel the views of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government, it did not go into action immediately.&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; The Conservative government was criticized by the Labour Party for not implementing the suggestions that the Black Report listed.&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; This criticism gave the Black Report the exposure it needed and its arguments were considered a valid explanation for health inequality.&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; There is also a debate over whether [[poverty]] causes ill-health or if ill-health causes poverty.&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; Arguments by the [[National Health Service]] gave considerable emphasis to poverty and lack of access to health care. It has also been found that [[heredity]] has more of a bearing on health than social environment, but research has also proved that there is indeed a positive correlation between socioeconomic inequalities and illness.&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt;

==Methodology==
The Sociology of Health and Illness looks at three areas: the conceptualization, the study of measurement and social distribution, and the justification of patterns in health and illness. By looking at these things researchers can look at different diseases through a sociological lens. The prevalence and response to different diseases varies by [[culture]].&lt;ref name= Marshall/&gt; By looking at bad health, researchers can see if health affects different social regulations or controls. When measuring the distribution of health and illness, it is useful to look at official [[statistics]] and community surveys. Official statistics make it possible to look at people who have been treated. It shows that they are both willing and able to use health services. It also sheds light on the infected person's view of their [[illness]]. On the other hand, community surveys look at people's rating of their health. Then looking at the relation of clinically defined illness and self reports and find that there is often a discrepancy.

A great deal of the time, mortality statistics take the place of the morbidity statistics because in many developed societies where people typically die from degenerative conditions, the age in which they die sheds more light on their life-time health. This produces many [[wikt:limitation|limitations]] when looking at the pattern of sickness, but sociologists try to look at various data to analyze the distribution better. Normally, developing societies have lower life expectancies in comparison to developed countries. They have also found correlations between mortality and sex and age. Very young and old people are more susceptible to sickness and [[death]]. On average women typically live longer than men, although women are more likely to have bad health.&lt;ref name="Marshall"&gt;Marshall, Gordon. "Health and illness, sociology of." A Dictionary of Sociology. 1998. Encyclopedia.com. 30 Nov. 2009 &lt;http://www.encyclopedia.com&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Disparities in health were also found between people in different social classes and ethnicities within the same society, even though in the medical profession they put more importance in “health related behaviors” such as alcohol consumption, smoking, diet, and exercise. There is a great deal of data supporting the conclusion that these behaviors affect health more significantly than other factors.&lt;ref name= Marshall/&gt; Sociologists think that it is more helpful to look at health and illness through a broad lens. Sociologists agree that [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] consumption, smoking, diet, and exercise are important issues, but they also see the importance of analyzing the cultural factors that affect these patterns. Sociologists also look at the effects that the productive process has on health and illness. While also looking at things such as industrial [[pollution]], environmental pollution, accidents at work, and stress-related diseases.&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt;

Social factors play a significant role in developing health and illness. Studies of [[epidemiology]] show that autonomy and control in the workplace are vital factors in the etiology of heart disease. One cause is an effort-reward imbalance. Decreasing career advancement opportunities and major imbalances in control over work have been coupled with various negative health costs. Various studies have shown that pension rights may shed light on mortality differences between retired men and women of different socioeconomic statuses. These studies show that there are outside factors that influence health and illness.&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt;

[[File:Map-of-HIV-Prevalance-in-Africa.png|thumb|Estimation of the number of adults in Africa who are infected with HIV or AIDS. Note that levels of infection are much higher in sub-Saharan Africa.]]

HIV/AIDS is the leading epidemic that affects the social welfare of Africa.&lt;ref name="Fredrickson"&gt;Fredrickson J, &amp; Kanabus, A. Impact of HIV/AIDS on Africa. retrieved Nov. 2009 from http://www.avert.org/aids-impact-africa.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can cause AIDS which is an acronym for Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), a condition in humans in which the [[immune system]] begins to fail, leading to life-threatening infections. Two-thirds of the worlds HIV population is located in Sub-Saharan Africa. Since the epidemic started more than 15 million Africans have died by complications with HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name=Fredrickson/&gt;

People apart of religious sub-groups of Sub-Saharan [[Africa]] and those who actively and frequently participate in religious activities are more likely to be at a lower risk of contracting HIV/AIDS. On the opposite end, there are many beliefs that an infected male can be cured of the [[infection]] by having sex with a virgin. These beliefs increase the number of people with the [[virus]] and also increase the number of rapes against women.&lt;ref name="Babb, DA. 2007"&gt;Babb, DA. (2007) Use of traditional medicine by HIV infected individuals. Psycho Health Med. 12, 314-320.&lt;/ref&gt;

Herbal treatment is one of the primary medicines used to treat HIV in Africa. It is used more than standard treatment because it is more affordable.&lt;ref name=Fredrickson/&gt; Herbal treatment is more affordable but is not researched and is poorly regulated . This lack of research on whether the herbal medicines work and what the medicines consist of is a major flaw in the healing cycle of HIV in Africa.&lt;ref name="Babb, DA. 2007"/&gt;

Economically, HIV has a significant negative effect. The labor force in Africa is slowly diminishing, due to HIV-related deaths and illness. In response, government income declines and so does tax revenue. The government has to spend more money than it is making, in order to care for those affected with HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name=Fredrickson/&gt;

A major social problem in Africa in regards to HIV is the orphan epidemic. The orphan epidemic in Africa is a regional problem. In most cases, both of the parents are affected with HIV. Due to this, the children are usually raised by their grandmothers and in extreme cases they are raised by themselves. In order to care for the sick parents, the children have to take on more responsibility by working to produce an income. Not only do the children lose their parents but they also lose their childhood as well. Having to provide care for their parents, the children also miss out on an education which increases the risk of teen pregnancy and people affected with HIV. The most efficient way to diminish the orphan epidemic is prevention: preventing children from acquiring HIV from their mothers at birth, as well as educating them on the disease as they grow older. Also, educating adults about HIV and caring for the infected people adequately will lower the orphan population.&lt;ref&gt;Epidemics: Malaria, AIDS, Other Disease: Post-colonial Africa. (2004).

The HIV/AIDS epidemic is reducing the average [[life expectancy]] of people in Africa by twenty years. The age range with the highest death rates, due to HIV, are those between the ages of 20 and 49 years. The fact that this age range is when adults acquire most of their [[income]] they cannot afford to send their children to school, due to the high medication costs. It also removes the people who could help aid in responding to the epidemic.&lt;ref name=Fredrickson/&gt;

===Asia===
Asian countries have wide variations of population, wealth, technology and health care, causing attitudes towards health and illness to differ. [[Japan]], for example, has the third highest life expectancy (82 years old), while [[Afghanistan]] has the 11th worst (44 years old).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2102rank.html |title=Country Comparison:: Life Expectancy at Birth |work= CIA- the World Factbook |year=2009 |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency |accessdate= Nov 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Key issues in Asian health include childbirth and maternal health, HIV and AIDS, mental health, and aging and the elderly. These problems are influenced by the sociological factors of religion or belief systems, attempts to reconcile traditional medicinal practices with modern professionalism, and the economic status of the inhabitants of Asia.

Like the rest of the world, Asia is threatened by a possible pandemic of HIV and AIDS. [[Vietnam]] is a good example of how society is shaping Asian HIV/AIDS awareness and attitudes towards this disease. Vietnam is a country with feudal, traditional roots, which, due to invasion, wars, technology and travel is becoming increasingly globalized. [[Globalization]] has altered traditional viewpoints and values. It is also responsible for the spread of HIV and AIDS in Vietnam. Even early globalization has added to this problem – Chinese influence made Vietnam a [[Confucianism|Confucian society]], in which women are of less importance than men. Men in their superiority have no need to be sexually responsible, and women, generally not well educated, are often unaware of the risk, perpetuating the spread of HIV and AIDS as well as other STIs.&lt;ref name="Micollier"&gt;{{cite book| last = Micollier| first = Evelyne| title = Sexual cultures in East Asia the social construction of sexuality and sexual risk in a time of AIDS| url = https://books.google.com/?id=LMk5ngEACAAJ| year = 2004| publisher = Routledge| location = London| isbn = 978-0-415-30871-7| pages = 98–101 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Confucianism has had a strong influence on the belief system in Asia for centuries, particularly in China, Japan, and Korea, and its influence can be seen in the way people chose to seek, or not seek, medical care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/9703/Humanity-Asian-Thought-Spread-Confucianism.html |title=The Spread of Confucianism |author=Powers, John |accessdate= Dec 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An important issue in Asia is societal effect on the ability of disabled individuals to adjust to a disability. Cultural beliefs shape attitudes towards physical and mental disabilities. China exemplifies this problem. According to Chinese Confucian tradition (which is also applicable in other countries where [[Confucianism]] has been spread), people should always pursue good health in their lives, with an emphasis on health promotion and disease prevention.&lt;ref name=Yang/&gt; To the Chinese, having a disability signifies that one has not led a proper lifestyle and therefore there is a lack of opportunities for disabled individuals to explore better ways to accept or adapt to their disability.&lt;ref name=Yang/&gt;

Indigenous healing practices are extremely diverse throughout Asia but often follow certain patterns and are still prevalent today. Many traditional healing practices include [[shamanism]] and [[herbalism|herbal medicines]], and may have been passed down orally in small groups or even institutionalized and professionalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author3 = Geoffrey Samuel| last1 = Connor| first1 = Linda| last2 = Samuel| first2 = Geoffrey| title = Healing powers and modernity traditional medicine, shamanism, and science in Asian societies| url = https://books.google.com/?id=e0Zx44BOiDoC| year = 2001| publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group| location = Westport, Connecticut| isbn = 978-0-89789-715-0| pages = 3–4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In many developing countries the only health care available until a few decades ago were those based on traditional medicine and spiritual healing. Now governments must be careful to create health policies that strike a balance between modernity and tradition. Organizations, like the [[World Health Organization]], try to create policies that respect tradition without trying to replace it with modern science, instead regulating it to ensure safety but keeping it accessible.&lt;ref name="Packer"&gt;{{cite book| author4 = Choon Nam Ong | author5= Barry Halliwell|lastauthoramp=y| last1 = Packer| first1 = Lester| last2 = Ong| first2 = Choon Nam| last3 = Halliwell| first3 = Barry| title = Herbal and traditional medicine molecular aspects of health| url = https://books.google.com/?id=xzj6ngEACAAJ| year = 2004| publisher = CRC Press| isbn = 978-0-8247-5436-5| pages = 2–5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; India in particular tries to make traditional medicines safe but still available to as many people as possible, adapting tradition to match modernization while still considering the economic positions and culture of its citizens.&lt;ref name=Packer/&gt;
[[File:Flag of WHO.svg|thumb|Flag of World Health Organization]]

Mental health issues are gaining an increasing amount of attention in the Asian countries.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Many of these countries have a preoccupation with modernizing and developing their economies, resulting in cultural changes. In order to reconcile modern techniques with traditional practices, [[social psychology|social psychologists]] in India are in the process of “[[indigenization|indigenizing]] psychology”. Indigenous psychology is that which is derived from the laws, theories, principals, and ideas of a culture and unique to each society.&lt;ref name="Yang"&gt;{{cite book| last = Yang| first = Guoshu| title = Progress in Asian social psychology conceptual and empirical contributions| url = https://books.google.com/?id=o4itQDGGvYgC| year = 2003| publisher = [[Greenwood Publishing Group]]| location = Westport, Connecticut| isbn = 978-0-313-32463-5| pages = 11–12, 294–295 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many Asian countries, childbirth is still treated by traditional means and is thought of with regional attitudes. For example, in [[Pakistan]], decisions concerning pregnancy and [[obstetrics|antenatal care]] (ANC) are usually made by older women, often the pregnant woman's mother-in-law, while the mother and father to be are distanced from the process. They may or may not receive professional ANC depending on their education, class, and financial situation.&lt;ref&gt;Mumtaz and Salway. Gender, pregnancy and the uptake of antenatal care services in Pakistan. ''Sociology of Health and Illness,'' Vol. 29, No. 1 pp. 1-26: 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally in Asia, childbirth is still a woman's area and male obstetricians are rare. Female midwives and healers are still the norm in most places. Western methods are overtaking the traditional in an attempt to improve maternal health and increase the number of live births.&lt;ref name="Rozario"&gt;{{cite book| author3 = Geoffrey Samuel| last1 = Rozario| first1 = Santi| last2 = Samuel| first2 = Geoffrey| title = the Daughters of Hariti childbirth and female healers in South and Southeast Asia| url = https://books.google.com/?id=ge-JngEACAAJ| year = 2002| publisher = Routledge| location = London| isbn = 978-0-415-27792-1| pages = 1–2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asian countries, which are mostly developing nations, are [[population ageing|aging rapidly]] even as they are attempting to build their economies. Even wealthy Asian nations, such as Japan, [[Singapore]], and [[Taiwan]], also have very elderly populations and thus have to try to sustain their economies and society with small younger generations while caring for their elderly citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Phillips| first = David| title = Ageing in the Asia-Pacific region issues, policies, and future trends| url = https://books.google.com/?id=fS4YngEACAAJ| year = 2000| publisher = Routledge| location = London| isbn = 978-0-415-22018-7| pages = xiv-xv }}&lt;/ref&gt; The elderly have been traditionally well respected and well cared for in most Asian cultures; experts predict that younger generations in the future are less likely to be concerned and involved in the health care of their older relatives due to various factors such as women joining the workforce more, the separation of families because of urbanization or migration, and the proliferation of [[Westernisation|Western ideals]] such as individualism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Hermalin| first = Albert| title = the Well-being of the elderly in Asia a four-country comparative study| url = https://books.google.com/?id=OzXqngEACAAJ| year = 2002| publisher = [[University of Michigan Press]]| isbn = 978-0-472-11280-7| pages = 1–3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
The health patterns found on the continent of [[Australia (continent)|Australia]] which includes the [[Pacific Islands]], have been very much influenced by [[European colonization]]. While indigenous medicinal beliefs are not significantly prevalent in Australia, traditional ideas are still influential in the health care problems in many of the islands of the Pacific.&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;{{cite book| author3 = Kerrie L. Macpherson| last1 = Lewis| first1 = Milton James| last2 = Macpherson| first2 = Kerrie L.| title = Public health in Asia and the Pacific historical and comparative perspectives| url = https://books.google.com/?id=pR14OqopGe8C| year = 2007| publisher = Routledge| location = London| isbn = 978-0-415-35962-7| pages = 222–235 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rapid [[urbanization]] of Australia led to epidemics of [[typhoid fever]] and the [[Bubonic plague]]. Because of this, public health was professionalized beginning in the late 1870s in an effort to control these and other diseases. Since then Australia's health system has evolved similarly to Western countries and the main cultural influence affecting health care are the political ideologies of the parties in control of the government.&lt;ref name=Lewis/&gt;
[[File:Bayer Heroin bottle.jpg|thumb|upright|Old heroin bottle]]
Australia has had treatment facilities for 'problem drinkers' since the 1870s. In the 1960s and 1970s it was recognized that Australia had several hundred thousand alcoholics and prevention became a priority over cures, as there was a societal consensus that treatments are generally ineffective.&lt;ref name= Lewis/&gt; The government began passing laws attempting to curb alcohol consumption but consistently met opposition from the [[Australian wine|wine-making regions of southern Australia]]. The government has also waged a war on illegal drugs, particularly [[heroin]], which in the 1950s became widely used as a pain reliever.&lt;ref name=Lewis/&gt;

Experts believe that many of the health problems in the Pacific Islands can be traced back to European colonization and the subsequent globalization and modernization of island communities.&lt;ref name="Otsuka"&gt;{{cite book| author3 = Stanley J. Ulijaszek| last1 = Ohtsuka| first1 = Ryutaro| last2 = Ulijaszek| first2 = Stanley J.| title = Health change in the Asia-Pacific region biocultural and epidemiological approaches| url = https://books.google.com/?id=T5M1nwEACAAJ| year = 2007| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-83792-7| pages = 4, 7–9, 136 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[History of the Pacific Islands]].) European colonization and late independence meant modernization but also slow economic growth, which had an enormous effect on health care, particularly on [[nutrition]] in the Pacific Islands. The end of colonization meant a loss of medical resources, and the fledgling independent governments could not afford to continue the health policies put in place by the colonial governments.&lt;ref name= Otsuka/&gt; Nutrition was changed radically, contributing to various other health problems. While more prosperous, urban areas could afford food, they chose poor diets, causing 'overnourishment', and leading to extremely high levels of [[obesity]], [[type 2 diabetes]], and cardiovascular diseases. Poorer rural communities, on the other hand, continue to suffer from [[malnutrition]] and [[malaria]].&lt;ref name= Otsuka/&gt;

Traditional diets in the Pacific are very low in fat, but since World War II there has been a significant increase in [[fat]] and [[protein]] in Pacific diets. Native attitudes towards weight contribute to the obesity problem. [[Tonga]]n natives see obesity as a positive thing, especially in men. They also believe that women should do as little physical work as possible while the men provide for them, meaning they get very little exercise.&lt;ref name= Otsuka/&gt;

===Europe===
The largest endeavors to improve health across Europe is the [[World Health Organization]] European Region.&lt;ref name="Nosikov"&gt;{{cite report|title= The European Health Report 2002|last= Nosikov|first= Anatoliy|year= 2002|publisher= World Health Organization Regional Office Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal is to improve the health of poor and disadvantaged populations by promoting healthy lifestyles including environmental, economic, social and providing [[health care]].&lt;ref name=Nosikov/&gt; Overall health in Europe is very high compared to the rest of the world.&lt;ref name=Nosikov/&gt; The average life expectancy is around 78 in [[European Union|EU]] countries but there is a wide gap between Western and Eastern Europe. It is as low as 67 in Russia and 73 in the [[Balkan]] states.&lt;ref name=Nosikov/&gt; Europe is seeing an increase in the spread of [[HIV/AIDS]] in Eastern Europe because of a worsening socioeconomic situation.&lt;ref name=Nosikov/&gt; [[Cardiovascular disease]], cancer and [[diabetes mellitus]] are more prevalent is Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name=Nosikov/&gt; The [[WHO]] claims that poverty is the most important factor bringing on ill health across Europe.&lt;ref name=Nosikov/&gt; Those at low [[socioeconomic status]] levels and many young people are also at risk because of their increased tobacco, alcohol and drug abuse.&lt;ref name=Nosikov/&gt; Health and illness prevention in Europe is largely funded by the governmental services including: regulating health care, insurance and social programs.&lt;ref name=Nosikov/&gt; The role of religion and traditional medicine, however, is often left unexamined in such reports.

The study of [[hypertension]] within the [[United Kingdom]] has turned to examining the role that beliefs play in its diagnosis and treatment. Hypertension is an essential topic for study since it is linked to increased risk of [[stroke]] and [[coronary heart disease]]. The most common treatment for hypertension is medication but compliance for this treatment plan is low.&lt;ref name="Morgan"&gt;{{cite journal|title= Managing hypertension: beliefs and responses to medication among cultural groups|last= Morgan|first= Myfanwy|year= 1988|publisher= Sociology of Health &amp; Illness, Vol. 10, No. 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted in the UK examined the differences between 'white' patients and first generation immigrants from the West Indies. There were differing reasons for non-compliance that involve the patients' perception and beliefs about the [[diagnosis]]. Patients commonly believe that high levels of [[anxiety]] when first diagnosed are the major cause and think that when stress levels decline so too will their hypertension. Other respondents in this UK based study had varying beliefs concerning the necessity of medication while others still argued that it was the [[side effects]] of medication that made them end their prescribed regimen.&lt;ref name=Morgan/&gt; West Indian respondents whose lay [[culture]] teaches them to reject long-term drug therapy opted instead for folk remedies in higher numbers than the 'white' respondents. What can be seen here is that some people will choose to ignore a doctor's expert advice and will employ 'lay consultation' instead.&lt;ref name=Morgan/&gt;
[[File:World Health Organisation regional offices.svg|thumb| Regions of the [[WHO]]]]

Before people seek medical help they try to interpret the symptoms themselves and often consult people in their lives or use 'self-help' measures.&lt;ref name="Punamaki"&gt;{{cite journal|title= Reasons for consultation and explanations of illness among Finnish primary-care patients|last= Punamaki|first= Raija-Leena|year= 1995|publisher= Sociology of Health &amp; Illness, Vol. 17, No. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of 'everyday illness' in [[Finland]] including: [[influenza]], [[infections]] and [[musculo-skeletal]] problems focused on reasons for consulting medical experts and explanations of illness. These common illness were examined not because of their seriousness but because of their frequency. The researchers explain five possible triggers that people seek medical aid: 1- the occurrence of an interpersonal crisis 2- perceived interference with social and personal relations 3- perceived interference with vocational &amp; [[physical activity]] 4- sanctioning by other people 5- sufferers ideas about how long certain complaints should last. These kind of explanatory models are part of the process that people use to construct medical culture.&lt;ref name=Punamaki/&gt; They give meaning to illness and health, answer questions about personal responsibility about health and most importantly are part of the dialogue between patients' and professionals' illness explanations. It can help explore why some patients will follow a doctors instructions to the letter and others ignore them completely. A patient's explanation or understanding of their illness can be much broader than a physician's and this dynamic has become a major criticism of modern medical practice since it normally excludes the "social, psychological and experiential dimensions of illness."&lt;ref name=Punamaki/&gt;

The Finnish study examined 127 patients and the results have been different from findings in other countries where there is more 'lay consultation'. Half of the respondents did not have any lay consultation before coming to the doctors office. One-third did not try any self-treatment and three-quarters of the sample consulted the doctor within three days of symptoms developing.&lt;ref name=Punamaki/&gt; Possible explanations are that in [[Finland]] there is an aspect "over-protectiveness" within their health care system. Many{{Who|date=May 2011}} might conclude that the Finnish people are dependent and helpless but the researchers of this study found that people chose to consult professionals because they trusted them over some lay explanation. These results echo similar studies in Ireland that explain this phenomenon as being based in a strong work ethic. Illness in these countries will affect their work and Finnish people will quickly get treatment so they can return to work. This research out of Finland also describes that this relationship between patient and doctor is based on:
# national and municipal administrative bureaucracies that demand more output and more satisfied patients
# the public demanding better care
# nurses criticizing physicians for not taking a holistic view of patients
# hospital specialists wanting better/earlier screening for serious illnesses (e.g. cancer).&lt;ref name=Punamaki/&gt;

The conflict between medical and lay worlds is prominent. On one hand many patients believe they are the expert of their own body and view the [[Doctor-patient relationship]] as [[authoritarian]]. These people will often use knowledge outside the medical field to deal with health and illness. Others see the doctor as the expert and are shy about describing their symptoms and therefore rely on the doctor for diagnosis and treatment.&lt;ref name=Punamaki/&gt;

===North America===
[[File:Obesity country comparison - path.svg|thumb|Compares figures in the population of [[OECD]] countries and the percentage of total population (aged 15 and above) with a [[body mass index]] greater than 30. Data was collected between 1996 and 2003.]]

North America is a fairly recent settled continent, made up of the United States, Canada, Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean. It was built by an amalgamation of wealth, ideas, culture, and practices. North America is highly advanced intellectually, technologically, and traditionally. This advantageous character of North American nations has caused a high average [[life expectancy]] of 75 years for males and 80 years for females. This leads to the conclusion that North America has cultivated a comparatively healthy society. As North America contains several core nations, the growing economies in those nations are able to maintain and develop medical institutions. This subsequently provides more access to health care for American citizens but health care is not universal. North America is known for being a leading nation in regards to [[industrialization]] and modernization, but the United States lacks federal laws regarding health care as a basic human right. This lag of health care security causes subsequent issues with pharmaceutical competition, lack of care for the elderly, and little attention to alternative medicine.&lt;ref name=Conrad/&gt; Health care and education are plentiful at a price and illness still persists for many reasons.&lt;ref name="WHO World Health Statistics 2008"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/whosis/whostat/2008/en/index.html |title=WHO World Health Statistics 2008 |year=2008 |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=Dec 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A main reason is that a lower- and middle-class population still exists in plentiful numbers, maintaining a group that is highly vulnerable to physical ailment.
[[File:Alcohol by country.svg|thumb|World map showing alcohol consumption around the world]]

North America's primary [[risk factors]] for illness are currently{{When|date=May 2011}} alcohol abuse, [[malnutrition]], [[obesity]], [[tobacco]] use, and water sanitation.&lt;ref name="WHO World Health Statistics 2008"/&gt; [[Obesity]] is a recent epidemic in North America. The 1990s brought a rise in the average [[Body Mass Index]], or BMI. From the beginning and to the end of the decade, the median percent of adults who were obese rose from 12% to 20%.&lt;ref name="WHO World Health Statistics 2008"/&gt; [[Alcoholism]] is the addiction of over-consumption of alcohol and is highly prevalent in the US. There are high incidence rates in many other world regions. Roughly 61% of American adults drank in 2007, and 21% of current drinkers consumed five or more drinks at one point in the last year. There have also been 22,073 alcohol induced deaths in the United States in the past year, about 13,000 of which were related to liver disease.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Disease Control and Prevention: FastStats. Alcohol Use. https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/alcohol.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Alcoholism has many risk factors ingrained in North American culture, such as heredity, stress from competition or availability.

The [[Swine Flu]] (also known as (H1N1) epidemic is a recent disease emerging in the early 21st century. In April 2009, during the early days of the outbreak, a molecular biologist named Dr. Henry Miller wrote in the ''Wall Street Journal'' about [[New York City]] high-school students. These students apparently brought the virus back from [[Mexico]] and infected their classmates.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;Miller, Henry I. Wall Street Journal: Understanding Swine Flu, April 28, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; All six cases so far reported in [[Canada]] were connected directly or indirectly with travel to Mexico as well. Flu viruses can be directly transmitted (via droplets from sneezing or coughing) from pigs to people, and vice versa. These cross-species infections occur most commonly when people are close to large numbers of pigs, such as in barns, livestock exhibits at fairs, and slaughterhouses. The flu is transmissible from human to human, either directly or via contaminated surfaces."&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt;

===South America===
There are many [[disease]]s that affect [[South America]], but two major conditions are [[malaria]] and [[Hepatitis]] D.
Malaria affects every country in South America except [[Uruguay]], [[Chile]], and The [[Falkland Islands]]. [[Elevation]] is a major factor in the areas where malaria is found. The disease is spread from person to person via [[mosquito]] bites. People are typically bitten by mosquitoes at dusk and dawn. [[Symptoms]] of this disorder are: high fever, chills, sweating, headaches, body aches, weakness, vomiting and [[diarrhea]]. If left untreated, new symptoms can occur; people that are infected may experience [[seizures]], delirium and [[coma]]. Severe cases may end in [[death]]. Malaria can be cured, but the symptoms may not become noticeable until months later. There are three forms of medication that can cure Malaria. An infected person's accessibility to these drugs is dependent upon their access to medical care and their financial situation. Literature about Malaria treatment typically is focused toward people who are tourists. Most sources are not written with the native in mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Palmerlee| first1 = Danny| last2 = Bao| first2 = Sandra| last3 = Beech| first3 = Charlotte| title = South America on a shoestring| year = 2004| isbn = 978-1-74104-163-7| page = 1056 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Malaria map.PNG|thumb|Malaria]]

The first sign of [[Hepatitis]] D was detected in 1978 when a strange and unrecognizable internuclear [[antigen]] was discovered during a [[liver]] [[biopsy]] of several Italians who suffered HBV infection. Scientists initially thought that it was an antigenic specificity of HBV, but they soon found that it was a [[protein]] from another disease altogether. They called it "Hepatitis Delta Virus" (HDV). This new virus was found to be defective. HDV needed HBV to act as a helper function in order for it to be detected. Normally Hepatitis B is transmitted through [[blood]] or any type of blood product. In [[South America]] Hepatitis D was found to be fatal. [[Scientist]]s are still unsure in what way this disease was being transmitted throughout certain South American countries. Sexual contact and [[Recreational drug use|drug use]] are the most common means of transmission. HDV is still considered an unusual form of hepatitis. Agents of this virus resemble that of plant viroids. It is still hard to tell how many stereotypes exist because HDV is under the umbrella of HBV. HDV causes very high titers in the blood of people who are infected. Incubation of Hepatitis D typically lasts for thirty five days. Most often Hepatitis D is a co-infection with Hepatitis B or a super-infection with chronic hepatitis. In terms of super infections there are high mortality rates, ranging seventy to eighty percent; in contrast with co-infections which have a one to three percent mortality rate. There is little information with the ecology of Hepatitis D. Epidemics have been found in Venezuela, Peru, Columbia, and Brazil. People who are treated for Hepatitis B have been able to control Hepatitis D. People who have chronic HDB will continue to get HDV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = for the National Academy of Sciences| title = Infectious Diseases in an Age of Change The Impact of Human Ecology and Behavior on Disease Transmission| year = 1995| publisher = National Academies Press| isbn = 0-309-05136-3| pages = 67–68 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another disease that affects South America is HIV and AIDS. In 2008 roughly two million people had HIV and AIDS. By the end of 2008 one hundred and seventy thousand people were infected with AIDS and HIV. Seventy seven thousand people died from this disease by the end of that year. Brazil has the most people that are affected with AIDS and HIV in South America. Forty-three percent of people in Brazil have HIV.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} In Brazil sixty percent of the inhabitants use drugs, are HIV positive, and are HIV positive because of their drug use. Usually this disease is transmitted by either drug use involving needles or unprotected sex. Sharing needles and being infected with HIV and AIDS is most common in Paraguay and Uruguay. South America is trying to get treatment to the thousands of people infected by this disease. Brazil is offering generic AIDS prescriptions that are much less expensive than the name brand drugs. One hundred and eighty-one thousand inhabitants in Brazil who were infected are being treated. That accounts for eighty percent of those who needed immediate help. This aid from the government has had positive results. Statistics show that there was a fifty percent decrease in mortality rates, approximately sixty to eighty percent decrease in morbidity rates and a seventy percent decrease in hospitalization of infected people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Willcox| first1 = Merlin| last2 = Bodeker| first2 = Gerard| last3 = Rasoanaivo| first3 = Philippe| title = Traditional Medicinal Plants and Malaria| year = 2004| publisher = CRC Press| isbn = 978-0-415-30112-1| page = 173 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7303">The '''Space Situational Awareness''' ('''SSA''') '''Programme''' is the [[European Space Agency]]'s initiative designed to support [[Space policy of the European Union|Europe's independent space access and utilization]] through the timely and accurate information delivery regarding the space environment, and particularly hazards to both in orbit and ground infrastructure.&lt;ref name=ssa-about&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Operations/Space_Situational_Awareness/About_SSA|title=About SSA|access-date=2015-05-03|publisher=ESA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SSA programme is split into three main segments:&lt;ref name=ssa-overview&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Operations/Space_Situational_Awareness/SSA_Programme_overview|title=SSA Programme overview|access-date=2015-05-03|publisher=ESA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Space Weather]] (SWE) segment: monitoring the [[Sun]], the [[solar wind]], and in Earth’s [[magnetosphere]], [[ionosphere]] and [[thermosphere]], that can affect spaceborne and ground-based infrastructure or endanger human life or health
* [[Near-Earth Objects]] (NEO) segment: detecting natural objects, such as [[asteroids]] and [[comets]], which can potentially [[Impact event|impact Earth]]
* [[Space surveillance|Space Surveillance and Tracking]] (SST) segment: Tracking active and inactive [[satellite]]s and [[space debris]] (collectively these items are referred to as [[Resident Space Object | Resident Space Objects]] (RSOs)).

The SSA programme is being implemented as an optional ESA programme with financial participation by 14 Member States. The programme started in 2009 and its mandate was extended until 2019. The second phase of the programme received €46.5 million for the 2013-2016 period.&lt;ref name=ssa-overview /&gt;

==Space Weather Segment==
The main objective of the Space Weather Segment (SWE) is to detect and forecast of [[space weather]] events, avoid adverse effect on European space assets and ground-based infrastructure. To achieve that, the segment will focus on delivery of real-time space weather information, forecasts and warnings, supported by a data archive, applications and services. Assets currently available for the segment consist of multiple ground-based and spaceborne sensors monitoring the Sun, [[solar wind]] and Earth's [[magnetosphere]], [[ionosphere]] and [[thermosphere]]. These include the [[PROBA2]] satellite and the [[Kanzelhoehe Solar Observatory]]. The segment is jointly coordinated by the SWE Data Centre located at the [[ESTRACK]] [[Redu Station]] and the SSA Space Weather Coordination Centre (SSCC), both in [[Belgium]].&lt;ref name=swe&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Operations/Space_Situational_Awareness/Space_Weather_-_SWE_Segment|title=SWE Segment|access-date=2015-05-03|publisher=ESA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Near-Earth Object Segment==
The [[near-Earth object]] segment aims to deliver monitoring and warning of potential [[Impact event|Earth impactors]] and tracking of newly discovered objects. The segment's current assets consist of a mixture of professional and amateur telescopes, including the [[OGS Telescope]], that are supported by tracking databases. The plans are to create a fully integrated system supporting alerts for civil authorities. The segment is operated by the SSA NEO Coordination Centre located at the [[ESA Centre for Earth Observation]], [[Italy]].&lt;ref name=neo&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Operations/Space_Situational_Awareness/Near-Earth_Objects_-_NEO_Segment |title=NEO Segment| access-date=2015-05-03| publisher=ESA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Space Surveillance and Tracking Segment==
The SST segment's primary goal is the detection, cataloguing and orbit prediction of objects orbiting the Earth. It is part of an effort to avoid collisions between orbiting satellites and debris, provide safe reentries, detect on-orbit explosions, assist missions at launch, deployment and end-of-life and overall reduce cost of space access. The segment currently relies on existing European radar and optical systems. Some of its assets are existing [[radio telescope|radio]] and [[optical telescopes]], with now serving a secondary role for tracking space debris.&lt;ref name=sst&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Operations/Space_Situational_Awareness/Space_Surveillance_and_Tracking_-_SST_Segment| title=SST Segment| access-date=2015-05-03| publisher=ESA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The radar-based SST assets are split into two categories: surveillance and tracking systems. SSA SST radar systems include:&lt;ref name=sst-radars&gt;{{cite web|url = https://sst.ssa.esa.int/cwbi/general/radar_sens.xhtml| title=Europe’s Radar Space Surveillance and Tracking Sensors| access-date=2015-05-03| publisher=ESA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Special education''' (also known as '''special needs education''', '''aided education''', '''exceptional education''' or '''Special Ed''') is the practice of educating students in a way that addresses their [[individual differences]] and needs. Ideally, this process involves the individually planned and systematically monitored arrangement of teaching procedures, adapted equipment and materials, and accessible settings. These interventions are designed to help individuals with special needs achieve a higher level of personal self-sufficiency and success in school and in their community which may not be available if the student were only given access to a typical classroom education.

Common special needs include [[learning disability|learning disabilities]] (such as [[dyslexia]]), [[communication disorder]]s, [[emotional and behavioral disorders]] (such as [[ADHD]]), [[physical disabilities]] (such as [[osteogenesis imperfecta]], [[cerebral palsy]], [[muscular dystrophy]], [[spina bifida]], and [[Friedreich's ataxia]]), and [[developmental disabilities]] (such as [[autism spectrum disorders]] and [[intellectual disability]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minedu.govt.nz/educationSectors/SpecialEducation/AboutSpecialEducation/WhatIsSpecialEducation/WhatIsSpecialEducation.aspx What is special education?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512043236/http://www.minedu.govt.nz/educationSectors/SpecialEducation/AboutSpecialEducation/WhatIsSpecialEducation/WhatIsSpecialEducation.aspx |date=12 May 2009 }} from New Zealand's Ministry of Education&lt;/ref&gt; Students with these kinds of special needs are likely to benefit from additional educational services such as different approaches to teaching, the use of technology, a specifically adapted teaching area, or a [[resource room]].

[[Intellectual giftedness]] is a difference in learning and can also benefit from specialised teaching techniques or different educational programs, but the term "special education" is generally used to specifically indicate instruction of students with disabilities. [[Gifted education]] is handled separately.

Whereas special education is designed specifically for students with special needs, [[remedial education]] can be designed for any students, with or without special needs; the defining trait is simply that they have reached a point of unpreparedness, regardless of why. For example, even people of high [[intelligence]] can be under-prepared if their education was disrupted, for example, by [[internally displaced person|internal displacement]] during [[civil disorder]] or a [[war]].

In most developed countries, educators modify teaching methods and environments so that the maximum number of students are served in general education environments. Therefore, special education in developed countries is often regarded as a service rather than a place.&lt;ref&gt;National Council on Disability. (1994).

The opposite of special education is ''general education''. General education is the standard [[curriculum]] presented without special teaching methods or supports. Students receiving special education services can enroll in a General education setting to learn along with students without disabilities.

==Identifying students or learners with special needs==
[[File:Skolegutt.jpg|alt=A boy wearing a jacket and a backpack|thumb|A six-year-old boy with [[Down syndrome]] is ready for his first day of school.]]
Some children are easily identified as candidates for special needs due to their medical history. They may have been diagnosed with a genetic condition that is associated with [[intellectual disability]], may have various forms of [[brain damage]], may have a [[developmental disorder]], may have visual or hearing disabilities, or other disabilities.

For students with less obvious disabilities, such as those who have learning difficulties, two primary methods have been used for identifying them: the ''discrepancy model'' and the ''response to intervention model''. The discrepancy model depends on the teacher noticing that the students' achievements are noticeably below what is expected. At which the teacher may make the decision for the student to receive support from a special education specialist. Before doing so, the teacher must show documentation of low academic achievement. The [[response to intervention]] model advocates earlier intervention.

In the discrepancy model, a student receives special education services for a specific learning difficulty (SLD) if the student has at least normal intelligence and the student's academic achievement is below what is expected of a student with his or her [[IQ]]. Although the discrepancy model has dominated the school system for many years, there has been substantial criticism of this approach (e.g., Aaron, 1995, Flanagan and Mascolo, 2005) among researchers. One reason for criticism is that diagnosing SLDs on the basis of the discrepancy between achievement and IQ does not predict the effectiveness of treatment. Low academic achievers who also have low IQ appear to benefit from treatment just as much as low academic achievers who have normal or high intelligence.

The alternative approach, [[response to intervention]], identifies children who are having difficulties in school in their first or second year after starting school. They then receive additional assistance such as participating in a [[Reading for special needs|reading remediation]] program. The response of the children to this intervention then determines whether they are designated as having a learning disability. Those few who still have trouble may then receive designation and further assistance. Sternberg (1999) has argued that early remediation can greatly reduce the number of children meeting diagnostic criteria for learning disabilities. He has also suggested that the focus on learning disabilities and the provision of accommodations in school fails to acknowledge that people have a range of strengths and weaknesses and places undue emphasis on academics by insisting that students should be supported in this arena and not in music or sports.

==Individual needs==
A special education program should be customised to address each individual student's unique needs. Special educators provide a continuum of services, in which students with special needs receives varying degrees of support based on their individual needs. Special education programs need to be individualised so that they address the unique combination of needs in a given student.&lt;ref name=Goodman&gt;{{cite book |author=Goodman, Libby |title=Time and learning in the special education classroom |publisher=State University of New York Press |location=Albany, N.Y. |year=1990 |page= 122 |isbn=0-7914-0371-8 |oclc=20635959}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, Canada, and the UK, educational professionals use a student's [[Individualized Education Program]] (IEP). Another name for a student's Individualized Education Plan is a student's [[Individual Learning Plan]] (ILP).

"The IEP is meant to address each child’s unique learning issues and include specific educational goals. It is a legally binding document. The school must provide everything it promises in the IEP."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.understood.org/en/school-learning/special-services/ieps/understanding-individualized-education-programs|title=Understanding Individualized Education Programs|website=Understood.org|access-date=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For children who are not yet 3, an [[Individual Family Service Plan]] (IFSP) contains information on the child's present level of development in all areas; outcomes for the child and family; and services the child and family will receive to help them achieve the outcomes.

In the United States, the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA) is a federal law that requires that every school system in the nation must provide a free and appropriate public education for every child, ages 3 to 22, regardless of how or how seriously that child may be disabled.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Exceptional Learners|last=Hallahan |first=Daniel |publisher=Pearson Education|year=2012|isbn=978-0-13-703370-6|location=Boston|pages=16–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; To ensure that this federal law is obeyed, the government requires every school system provide this type of education to each student in order to receive federal funding.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Special Education Process.jpg|thumb|Procedure that a person must follow in order to receive special education accommodations]]
Students with special needs are assessed to determine their specific strengths and weaknesses.&lt;ref name=Goodman /&gt; The earlier these students with special needs are assessed, the better it is for them to get the accommodations that they need in order for them to get the most out of their education. Placement, resources, and goals are determined on the basis of the student's needs. Accommodations and Modifications to the regular program may include changes in the curriculum, supplementary aides or equipment, and the provision of specialized physical adaptations that allow students to participate in the educational environment as much as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weac.org/Issues_Advocacy/Resource_Pages_On_Issues_one/Special_Education/special_education_inclusion.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107145830/http://www.weac.org/Issues_Advocacy/Resource_Pages_On_Issues_One/Special_Education/special_education_inclusion.aspx |archivedate=7 January 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Students may need this help to access subject matter, physically gain access to the school, or meet their emotional needs. For example, if the assessment determines that the student cannot write by hand because of a physical disability, then the school might provide a computer for typing assignments, or allow the student to answer questions verbally instead. If the school determines that the student is severely distracted by the normal activities in a large, busy classroom, then the student might be placed in a smaller classroom such as a [[resource room]].

Parent of students with a learning disability must know what type of disability their child has, so they can get accommodations such as speech therapy, occupational therapy and adaptive physical education.For example, if a student takes an academic test and it indicates that the student struggles with reading comprehension, parents can request speech and language support or classroom accommodations, such as extra time to complete reading and writing tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Special Education Process Explained|url=http://www.specialeducationguide.com/pre-k-12/what-is-special-education/the-special-education-process-explained/|website=Special Education Guide|accessdate=22 March 2016|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schools use different approaches to providing special education services to students. These approaches can be broadly grouped into four categories, according to how much contact the student with special needs has with non-disabled students (using North American terminology):

* ''[[Inclusion (education)|Inclusion]]:'' In this approach, students with special needs spend all, or most of the school day with students who do not have special needs. Because inclusion can require substantial modification of the general curriculum, most schools use it only for selected students with mild to moderate special needs, which is accepted as a [[best practice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Smith P |title=Have we made any progress?

Students may occasionally leave the regular classroom to attend smaller, more intensive instructional sessions in a [[resource room]], or to receive other related services that might require specialised equipment or might be disruptive to the rest of the class, such as [[speech and language therapy]], [[occupational therapy]], [[physical therapy]], [[rehabilitation counseling]]. They might also leave the regular classroom for services that require privacy, such as counseling sessions with a [[social worker]].&lt;ref name=Bowe&gt;{{cite book |author=Bowe, Frank |title=Making Inclusion Work |publisher=Prentice Hall |location=Upper Saddle River, N.J |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=0-13-017603-6 |oclc=54374653}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Mainstreaming (education)|Mainstreaming]]'' refers to the practice of educating students with [[special needs]] in classes with non-disabled students during specific time periods based on their skills. Students with special needs are segregated in separate classes exclusively for students with special needs for the rest of the school day.&lt;ref name="Teachers, Schools, and Society"&gt;{{cite book

* ''Segregation'' in a separate classroom or special school for students with special needs: In this model, students with special needs do not attend classes with non-disabled students. Segregated students may attend the same school where regular classes are provided, but spend all instructional time exclusively in a separate classroom for students with special needs. If their special class is located in an ordinary school, they may be provided opportunities for social integration outside the classroom, such as by eating meals with non-disabled students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.educationengland.org.uk/documents/warnock/warnock07.html Warnock Report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130111230317/http://www.educationengland.org.uk/documents/warnock/warnock07.html |date=11 January 2013 }} (1978).

(20 December 2010) [https://archive.is/20130105014730/http://www.theoaklandpress.com/articles/2010/12/20/news/doc4d0fc3a6b0867472513928.txt?viewmode=fullstory What the law requires for disabled students] ''The Oakland Press''.&lt;/ref&gt; Such exclusion still affects about 23 million disabled children worldwide, particularly in poor, rural areas of developing countries.&lt;ref name=Hicks&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-15183284|title=Disabled children excluded from education|last=Hicks|first=Bill|date=18 November 2011|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may also occur when a student is in hospital, housebound, or detained by the criminal justice system. These students may receive one-on-one instruction or group instruction. Students who have been [[suspension (punishment)|suspended]] or [[expulsion (academia)|expelled]] are not considered excluded in this sense.
* ‘’[[Co-Teaching]]:’’ In this setting, students with disabilities are placed in a General education classroom to learn along with their disabled peers and non-disabled peers. A General Education teacher and a Special Education teacher work as partners in instruction.

===Effective Instruction for students with disabilities===

* ''Goal Directed'': Each child must have an individualised Education Program (IEP) that distinguishes his/her particular needs. The child must get the services that are designed for him/her. These services will allow him/her to reach his/her annual goals which will be assessed at the end of each term along with short-term goals that will be assessed every few months.
* ''Research-Based Methods''- There has been a lot of research done about students with disabilities and the best way to teach them. Testing, IQs, interviews, the discrepancy model, etc. should all be used to determine where to place the child. Once that is determined, the next step is the best way for the child to learn. There are plenty of different programs such as the Wilson Reading Program and Direct Instruction
* ''Guided by student performance''- While the IEP goals may be assessed every few months to a year, constant informal assessments must take place. These assessments will guide instruction for the teacher. The teacher will be able to determine if the material is too difficult or to easy.&lt;ref name="Bos, C. S. 2005"&gt;Bos, C. S. &amp; Vaughn, S. (2005). Strategies for teaching students with learning and behavior problems. (6th ed.). Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special schools===
A ''special school'' is a school catering for students who have special educational needs due to [[learning disabilities|learning difficulties]], physical [[disabilities]] or behavioural problems. Special schools may be specifically designed, staffed and resourced to provide appropriate special education for children with additional needs. Students attending special schools generally do not attend any classes in mainstream schools.

Special schools provide individualised education, addressing specific needs. Student to teacher ratios are kept low, often 6:1 or lower depending upon the needs of the children. Special schools will also have other facilities for children with special needs, such as soft play areas, [[Sensory perception|sensory]] rooms, or [[swimming pool]]s, which are necessary for treating students with certain conditions.

In recent times, places available in special schools are declining as more children with special needs are educated in [[Inclusion (education)|mainstream schools]]. However, there will always be some children, whose learning needs cannot be appropriately met in a regular classroom setting and will require specialised education and resources to provide the level of support they require. An example of a disability that may require a student to attend a special school is intellectual disability. However, this practice is often frowned upon by school districts in the US in the light of Least Restrictive Environment as mandated in the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]].&lt;ref&gt;Turnbull, Ron (2002). "Exceptional Lives: Special Education in Today's Schools (3rd ed.)Merrill Prentice Hall. New Jersey.&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative is a '''special unit''' or '''special classroom''', also called a '''self-contained classroom''', which is a separate room or rooms dedicated solely to the education of students with special needs within a larger school that also provides general education. These classrooms are typically staffed by specially trained teachers, who provide specific, individualised instruction to individuals and small groups of students with special needs. Self-contained classrooms, because they are located in a general education school, may have students who remain in the self-contained classroom full-time, or students who are [[mainstreaming (education)|included]] in certain general education classes. In the United States a part-time alternative that is appropriate for some students is sometimes called a [[resource room]].

====History of special schools====
One of the first special schools in the world was the [[Institut National des Jeunes Aveugles]] in Paris, which was founded in 1784. It was the first school in the world to teach [[Blindness|blind]] students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inja.fr/inja/htmgen/SimHTMLGen.asp?FORM=0&amp;STYLE=2&amp;URL=/pages-infos/pages/informations_generales/presentation_de_l_inja/histoire-inja/histoirinja_sommaire.xhtml&amp;CSS=1 History of the INJA]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720233247/http://www.inja.fr/inja/htmgen/SimHTMLGen.asp?FORM=0&amp;STYLE=2&amp;URL=%2Fpages-infos%2Fpages%2Finformations_generales%2Fpresentation_de_l_inja%2Fhistoire-inja%2Fhistoirinja_sommaire.xhtml&amp;CSS=1 |date=20 July 2011 }} {{Fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first school in U.K, for the Deaf was established 1760 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bris.ac.uk/Depts/DeafStudiesTeaching/deafed/Session%202A.htm |title=Session 2A |publisher=Bris.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.connerprairie.org/Learn-And-Do/Indiana-History/America-1800-1860/Education-Of-The-Deaf.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922095519/http://www.connerprairie.org/Learn-And-Do/Indiana-History/America-1800-1860/Education-Of-The-Deaf.aspx |archivedate=22 September 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Edinburgh by [[Thomas Braidwood]], with education for [[Blindness and education|visually impaired]] people beginning in the Edinburgh and Bristol in 1765.

In the 19th century, people with disabilities and the inhumane conditions where they were supposedly housed and educated were addressed in the literature of [[Charles Dickens]]. Dickens characterized people with severe disabilities as having the same, if not more, compassion and insight in [[Bleak House]] and [[Little Dorrit]].&lt;ref&gt;''The history of special education: From isolation to integration''. MA Winzer&lt;/ref&gt;

Such attention to the downtrodden conditions of people with disabilities brought resulted in reforms in Europe including the re-evaluation of special schools. In the United States reform came more slowly. Throughout the mid half of the 20th century, special schools, termed institutions, were not only accepted, but encouraged. Students with disabilities were housed with people with [[mental illness]]es, and they were not educated much, if at all.&lt;ref&gt;Inventing the feeble mind: A history of mental retardation in the United States. S McCuen – ''Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law'', 1997 – Duke Univ Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Deinstitutionalization proceeded in the US beginning in the 1970s following the exposes of the institutions, and it has taken sometime before the Education for All Handicapped Children's Act of 1974, to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and then Individuals with Disabilities Educational Improvement Act (IDEIA) have come into fruition.&lt;ref&gt;Turnbull, H. R., Beegle, R. &amp; Stowe, M.J. (2007). Public policy and developmental disabilities: A 35-year retrospective and a 5-year prospective on the core concepts in disability. In: S. Odom, R.H. Horner, M.E. Snell, &amp; J. Blacher, ''Handbook on Developmental Disabilities'', 15-34. London: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; School integration was supported as early as the 1970s, and teacher preparation programs in higher education have carefully taught and instructed graduates on inclusion at the classroom, individual, school, and district levels for decades resulting in dual certification of "regular teachers".

With the Amendments to the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 1997]], school districts in the United States began to slowly integrate students with moderate and severe special needs into regular school systems. This changed the form and function of special education services in many school districts and special schools subsequently saw a steady decrease in enrollment as districts weighed the cost per student. It also posed general funding dilemmas to certain local schools and districts, changed how schools view assessments, and formally introduced the concept of [[Inclusion (education)|inclusion]] to many educators, students and parents.&lt;ref&gt;Jorgensen, C.M. (1998). ''Restructuring high school for all students: Taking inclusion to the next level''. Baltimore: Paul H. Brooks Publishing co.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instructional strategies==
{{Anchor|Modifications|Accommodations}}
&lt;!--  This section does not discuss *where* the student is taught.  Please discuss *how* the student is taught.  --&gt;

The student can be taught in either a classroom or outside environment. Both environments can be interactive for the student to engage better with the subject.&lt;ref&gt;http://rse.sagepub.com/content/9/6/29.full.pdf+html&lt;/ref&gt;

Different instructional techniques are used for some students with special educational needs. Instructional strategies are classified as being either ''accommodations'' or ''modifications''.

An ''accommodation'' is a reasonable adjustment to teaching practices so that the student learns the same material, but in a format that is more accessible to the student. Accommodations may be classified by whether they change the presentation, response, setting, or scheduling of lessons.&lt;ref name=Ofqual&gt;{{cite report

&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the school may modify a reading assignment for a student with reading difficulties by substituting a shorter, easier book. A student may receive both accommodations and modifications.

;Examples of modifications:
* Skipping subjects: Students may be taught less information than typical students, skipping over material that the school deems inappropriate for the student's abilities or less important than other subjects. For example, students with poor fine motor skills may be taught to print [[block letters]], but not [[cursive]] handwriting.
* Simplified assignments: Students may read the same literature as their peers but have a simpler version, such as Shakespeare with both the original text and a modern paraphrase available.&lt;ref&gt;Thorson, Sue.  "Macbeth in the Resource Room: Students with Learning Disabilities Study Shakespeare."  ''Journal of Learning Disabilities'', v28 n9 p575-81 Nov 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Shorter assignments: Students may do shorter homework assignments or take shorter, more concentrated tests.
* Extra aids: If students have deficiencies in working memory, a list of vocabulary words, called a ''word bank'', can be provided during tests, to reduce lack of recall and increase chances of comprehension. Students might use a calculator when other students do not.
* Extended time: Students with a slower processing speed may benefit from extended time for assignments and/or tests in order to have more time to comprehend questions, recall information, and synthesize knowledge.
* Students can be offered a flexible setting in which to take tests. These settings can be a new location to provide for minimal distractions.

;Examples of accommodations:
* Response accommodations:&lt;ref name=Ofqual/&gt; Typing homework assignments rather than hand-writing them (considered a modification if the subject is [[penmanship|learning to write by hand]]). Having someone else write down answers given verbally.
* Presentation accommodations:&lt;ref name=Ofqual/&gt; Examples include listening to [[audiobook]]s rather than reading printed books. These may be used as substitutes for the text, or as supplements intended to improve the students' reading fluency and phonetic skills. Similar options include designating a person to read to the student, or providing [[text to speech]] software. This is considered a modification if the purpose of the assignment is [[Learning to read|reading skills acquisition]]. Other presentation accommodations may include designating a person to take notes during lectures or using a talking [[calculator]] rather than one with only a visual display.
* Setting accommodations:&lt;ref name=Ofqual/&gt; Taking a test in a quieter room. Moving the class to a room that is physically accessible, e.g., on the first floor of a building or near an [[elevator]]. Arranging seating assignments to benefit the student, e.g., by sitting at the front of the classroom.
* Scheduling accommodations:&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt; Students may be given rest breaks or extended time on tests (may be considered a modification, if speed is a factor in the test). Use a timer to help with time management.

All developed countries permit or require some degree of accommodation for students with special needs, and special provisions are usually made in examinations which take place at the end of formal schooling.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

In addition to how the student is taught the academic curriculum, schools may provide non-academic services to the student. These are intended ultimately to increase the student's personal and academic abilities. Related services include developmental, corrective, and other supportive services as are required to assist a student with special needs and includes [[speech and language pathology]], [[audiology]], psychological services, [[physical therapy]], [[occupational therapy]], counseling services, including [[rehabilitation counseling]], orientation and mobility services, medical services as defined by regulations, parent counseling and training, school health services, school social work, assistive technology services, other appropriate developmental or corrective support services, appropriate access to recreation and other appropriate support services.&lt;ref name="Related Services"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, most related services are provided by the schools; in others, they are provided by the normal healthcare and social services systems.

As an example, students who have [[autistic spectrum disorder]]s, poor impulse control, or other behavioral challenges may learn self-management techniques, be kept closely on a comfortingly predictable schedule, or given extra cues to signal activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Simpson, Richard L. |author2=Sonja R. de Boer |title=Successful inclusion for students with autism: creating a complete, effective ASD inclusion program |publisher=Jossey-Bass |location=San Francisco |year=2009 |pages=38–42 |isbn=0-470-23080-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A university field, termed ''severe disabilities'', also is taught throughout the US university sector in schools of education. Advanced instruction is based upon community-referenced instruction, and alignment with transition to adulthood and progressive community practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Snell, M.E. |author2=Brown, F. |year=2011 |title=Instruction of Students with Severe Disabilities |edition=7th |publisher=Pearson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rehabilitation counseling personnel are often association with [[supported employment]] services, and typically with "transition to adulthood" &lt;ref&gt;Rusch, F.R., DeStefano, L., Chadsey-Rusch, J., Phelps, L.A., &amp; Szymanski, E. (1992). ''Transition from School to Adult Life: Models, Linkages and Policies''. Sycamore, IL:Sycamore Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, D. &amp; Ferguson, P. (1987/2011). The promise of adulthood. In: M. Snell &amp; F. Brown, ''Instruction of Students with Severe Disabilities''. Madrid: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt; in which multi-decade recommendations for better coordination between the school and the community service sectors have been made at the federal and university levels.

==Issues==
At-risk students (those with educational needs that are not associated with a disability) are often placed in classes with students who have disabilities. Critics assert that placing at-risk students in the same classes as students with disabilities may impede the educational progress of people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Greenwood CR |title=Longitudinal analysis of time, engagement, and achievement in at-risk versus non-risk students |journal=Except Child |volume=57 |issue=6 |pages=521–35 |date=May 1991  |pmid=2070811 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some special education classes have been criticized for a watered-down curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ldonline.org/article/Watering_Up_the_Curriculum_for_Adolescents_with_Learning_Disabilities,_Part_I:_Goals_of_the_Knowledge_Dimension |title=Watering Up the Curriculum for Adolescents with Learning Disabilities, Part I: Goals of the Knowledge Dimension |accessdate=2010-04-21 |last=Ellis |first=Edwin |year=2002 |publisher=WETA }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of inclusion (in mainstream classrooms) has been criticized by advocates and some parents of children with special needs because some of these students require instructional methods that differ dramatically from typical classroom methods. Critics assert that it is not possible to deliver effectively two or more very different instructional methods in the same classroom. As a result, the educational progress of students who depend on different instructional methods to learn often fall even further behind their peers.&lt;ref name=Breckenridge&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://publicculture.dukejournals.org/cgi/content/citation/13/3/349 |title=The Critical Limits of Embodiment: Disability's Criticism |author=Carol A.

Parents of typically developing children sometimes fear that the special needs of a single "fully included" student will take critical levels of attention and energy away from the rest of the class and thereby impair the academic achievements of all students.&lt;ref name=Breckenridge/&gt;

Linked to this, there is debate about the extent to which students with special needs, whether in mainstream or special settings, should have a specific pedagogy, based on the scientific study of particular diagnostic categories, or whether general instructional techniques are relevant to all students including those with special needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lews|first1=Ann|last2=Norwich|first2=Brahm|title=Special Teaching for Special Children?|date=2005|publisher=Open University Press|location=Milton Keynes, UK|isbn=0335214053}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mintz|first1=Joseph|title=Professional Uncertainty, Knowledge and Relationship in the Classroom: A Psycho-social Perspective|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780415822961|url=http://routledge-ny.com/books/details/9780415822961/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some parents, advocates, and students have concerns about the eligibility criteria and their application. In some cases, parents and students protest the students' placement into special education programs. For example, a student may be placed into the special education programs due to a mental health condition such as [[obsessive compulsive disorder]], [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], [[anxiety]], [[panic attack]]s or [[ADHD]], while the student and his parents believe that the condition is adequately managed through medication and outside therapy. In other cases, students whose parents believe they require the additional support of special education services are denied participation in the program based on the eligibility criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst?docId=5001996968|title=Development And Validation Of A Process For Screening Referrals To Special Education |author=Amanda M. Vanderheyden |author2=Joseph C Witt |author3=Gale Naquin  |year=2003 |journal=School Psychology Review|volume=32 |publisher=Research and Read Books, Journals, Articles at Questia Online Library }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether it is useful and appropriate to attempt to educate the most severely disabled children, such as children who are in a [[persistent vegetative state]], is debated. While many severely disabled children can learn simple tasks, such as pushing a buzzer when they want attention, some children may be incapable of learning. Some parents and advocates say that these children would be better served by substituting improved physical care for any academic program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/20/education/20donovan.html?pagewanted=all
|title = A Struggle to Educate the Severely Disabled
|newspaper = The New York Times
|author = Otterman, Sharon
|date = 19 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, they question whether teaching such non-academic subjects, such as pushing a buzzer, is properly the job of the school system, rather than the health care system.

Another large issue is the lack of resources enabling individuals with special needs to receive an education in the developing world. As a consequence, 98 percent of children with [[Disability and Poverty|special needs in developing countries]] do not have access to education.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. (1995). Review of the present situation in special education. Webaccessed: http://www.unesco.org/pv_obj_cache/pv_obj_id_C133AD0AF05E62AC54C2DE8EE1C026DABFAF3000/filename/281_79.pdf{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another issue would be budget cuts. Cuts can affect special education students who don't have access to proper equipment or education. The National Coalition for Personal Shortages did a survey and almost 100% of the teachers said that they are not able to give the proper rights to children with disabilities. Teachers are getting cut off from work due to the budget cuts.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=f8ad9957-dcd5-4bd6-9000-d2db068bc640@sessionmgr4009&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=4201{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}{{full citation needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a financial debate that covers the use and allotment of special education government funding. The three views on this topic are that we spend too much money on it, there is not enough money put into it or that the money that is given isn't being spent properly. The argument for the first is that the amount of money spent on one special needs child is enough to cover a large group of general education students, and sometimes even causes several students to suffer budget cuts on general programs to support one child. The evidence for special education not having enough money is the lack of teachers, burnt out teachers and a limited variety of teaching tools for each student. The argument to spend the money differently states that there is a lot of money set aside, but that it is being wasted by spending too much time on paperwork, inefficient IEP meetings or spending money on things that don't actually benefit the child.&lt;ref&gt;https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED427399&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global issues ===
Children with disabilities are often denied their right to education. However, little is known about their school attendance patterns. The collection of data on children with disabilities is not straightforward, but data are vital to ensure that policies are in place to address the constraints these children face.&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002325/232555e.pdf|title=Rethinking Education: Towards a global common good?|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100088-1|location= |pages=44, Box 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=UNESCO|first=|year=2014|title=Teaching and Learning: Achieving quality for all|url=|journal=EFA Global Monitoring Report 2013-2014|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By one estimate, 93 million children under age 14, or 5.1% of the world's children, were living with a ‘moderate or severe disability’ in 2004. According to the World Health Survey, in 14 of 15 low and middle income countries, people of working age with disabilities were about one-third less likely to have completed primary school. For example, in [[Bangladesh]], 30% of people with disabilities had completed primary school, compared with 48% of those with no disabilities. The corresponding shares were 43% and 57% in [[Zambia]]; 56% and 72% in [[Paraguay]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UNESCO" /&gt;

It has been shown that children with a higher risk of disability are far more likely to be denied a chance to go to school. In Bangladesh, [[Bhutan]] and [[Iraq]], children with mental impairments were most likely to be denied this right. In Iraq, for instance, 10% of 6- to 9-year-olds with no risk of disability had never been to school in 2006, but 19% of those at risk of having a hearing impairment and 51% of those who were at higher risk of mental disability had never been to school. In [[Thailand]], almost all 6- to 9-year-olds who had no disability had been to school in 2005/06, and yet 34% of those with walking or moving impairments had never been to school.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UNESCO" /&gt;

Children with disabilities require access to services that can support them throughout their time in school, such as more individual attention from instructors. According to the United Nations Centre for Human Rights, about 2% of children with disabilities have access to these services. Those without access to these services are excluded from education and unable to attend school.

;South Africa

Both modifications and accommodations are recommended, depending on the student's individual needs.

;Japan
{{Main|Education in Japan}}

Japanese students with special needs are placed in one of four different school arrangements: [[special school]]s, special classrooms with another school, in [[resource rooms]] (which are called ''tsukyu''), or in regular classrooms.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

Special schools are reserved for students whose severe disabilities cannot be accommodated in the local school.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt; They do not use the same grading or marking systems as mainstream schools, but instead assess students according to their individualized plans.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

Special classes are similar, and may vary the national curriculum as the teachers see fit. ''Tsukyu'' are [[resource room]]s that students with milder problems use part-time for specialized instruction individually in small groups. These students spend the rest of the day in the mainstream classroom. Some students with special needs are fully included in the mainstream classroom, with accommodations or modifications as needed.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

Training of disabled students, particularly at the upper-secondary level, emphasizes vocational education to enable students to be as independent as possible within society. Vocational training varies considerably depending on the student's disability, but the options are limited for some. It is clear that the government is aware of the necessity of broadening the range of possibilities for these students. Advancement to higher education is also a goal of the government, and it struggles to have institutions of higher learning accept more disabled students.

;Pakistan
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}
After independence (1947), Pakistan had to face some serious challenges, due to which no proper emphasis was given to special education and even education. Among other reasons, lack of resources, financial as well as human, was the major one in this context. The need and importance of special education was felt in different educational policies of Pakistan in different times. At the first time, in its report, the Commission on National Education (1959) highlighted the importance of special education. After that the Education Policy (1972) and the National Policy and Implementation Programme (1979) gave some importance to this sector. The same was also reflected in different medium-term (five-year) plans. This was felt more seriously when the Directorate General of Special Education, Islamabad formulated a draft National Policy for Special Education in 1986 and revised it in 1988 to bring it in line with the emerging needs of special/disabled population. After that a special education policy was launched in 1999. Recently, Government of Pakistan has launched a new National Policy for Persons with Disabilities 2002, which is dynamically being implemented.

Special education is regulated centrally by the Singapore Ministry of Education.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt; Both [[special school]]s and integration into mainstream schools are options for students with special educational needs, but most students with disabilities are placed in special schools.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

Students with special education who wish accommodations on national exams must provide appropriate documentation to prove that they are disabled.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt; Accommodations, but not modifications (e.g., simpler questions) are normally approved if they are similar to the accommodations already being used in everyday schoolwork, with the goal of maintaining the exam's integrity while not having students unfairly disadvantaged by factors that are unrelated to what is being tested. The accommodations are listed on the Primary School Leaving Exam.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

With respect to standardized tests, special consideration procedures are in place in all states for students who are disabled.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt; Students must provide documentation Not all desired forms of accommodations are available. For example, students who cannot read, even if the inability to read is due to a disability, cannot have the exam read to them, because the exam results should accurately show that the student is unable to read. Reports on matriculation exams do not mention whether the student received any accommodations in taking the test.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

[[File:Kötitz Rathaus.JPG|thumb|A special school for children with special emotional needs in Kötitz, Germany]]

Most students with special needs in Germany attend a [[special school]] that serves only children with special needs. These include:
* ''Förderschule für Lernbehinderte'' (special school for learning disabilities): for children who have challenges that impair learning
* ''Förderschule mit dem Förderschwerpunkt Geistige Entwicklung'' (school for cognitive development): for children with very severe learning challenges
* ''Förderschule Schwerpunkt emotionale und soziale Entwicklung'' (school for emotional and social development): for children who have special emotional needs
* ''Förderschule für Blinde'' (school for the blind): for blind children
* ''Förderschule für Sehbehinderte'' (school for the visually impaired): for children who are visually challenged
* ''Förderschule für Gehörlose'' (school for the deaf): for deaf children
* ''Förderschule für Schwerhörige'' (school for the hearing impaired): for children who are hearing impaired
* ''Förderschule für Körperbehinderte'' (school for children with physical disabilities): for children with physical disabilities
* ''Förderschule für Sprachbehinderte'' (school for children with language disorders): for children with language disorders
* ''Förderschule für Taubblinde'' (school for the deafblind): for children who are deafblind
* ''Schule für Kranke'' (school for ill children): for children who are too ill to attend school or are hospitalized for a longer period of time.
* ''Förderschule für schwer mehrfach Behinderte'' (school for children with severe and multiple disabilities): for children with severe and multiple disabilities who need very special care and attention. Sometimes these children are only susceptible for very basic emotional and sensory stimulation. Thus teachers at these school (as well as at schools for the deafblind) are highly specialized professionals.

One in 21 German students attends a special school. Teachers at those schools are specially trained professionals who have specialized in special needs education while in university. Special schools often have a very favorable student-teacher ratio and facilities other schools do not have.

Some special needs children in Germany do not attend a special school, but are educated in a mainstream school such as a [[Hauptschule]] or [[Gesamtschule]] (comprehensive school).

Students with special educational needs may be exempted from standardized tests or given modified tests.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

;Greece

Greek students with special needs may attend either mainstream schools or special schools.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

Students whose disabilities have been certified may be exempted from some standardized tests or given alternative tests.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt; Accommodations are responsive to students' needs; for example, students with visual impairments may take oral tests, and students with hearing impairments take written tests. Accommodations and modifications are noted on the certificate of achievement.

As a general rule, students with special educational needs are integrated into their regular, mainstream schools with appropriate support, under the "Going to School Together" policy (''Weer Samen Naar School'').&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt; Four types of disability-specific special schools exist. The national policy is moving towards "suitable education" (''passend onderwijs''), based on the individual's strengths and weaknesses.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

'''Norway'''

The National Support System for Special Needs Education (Statped) is managed by the [[Norwegian Directorate for Education and Training]]. The general objective for Statped is to give guidance and support to those in charge of the education in municipalities and county administrations to ensure that children, young people and adults with major and special educational needs are secured well-advised educational and developmental provisions. The institutions affiliated with Statped offer a broad spectrum of services. Statped consists of 13 resource centres owned by the State, and 4 units for special education, where Statped buys services. These centres offer special educational guidance and support for local authorities and county administrations.

Students with disabilities have a "guaranteed right" to appropriate accommodations on assessments.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt; Schools are generally considered autonomous.

;Slovenia

On national tests, the National Examination Center normally grants most requests for accommodations that are supported by the local school's examination committee. Legislation opposes the use of modifications that would be unfair to non-disabled students.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

;Spain

Schools are required to provide services and resources to students with special educational needs so that they make progress and participate in school.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt; If the local school is unable to provide appropriately for an individual student, then the student may be transferred to a special school.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

Spanish non-governmental organizations like [[ONCE]] have traditionally provided significant services to students with disabilities.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

;Sweden

Local schools have significant autonomy, based on national guidelines. Schools are expected to help students meet the goals that are set for them.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

There are special schools (Swedish:Särskola) for students with low abilities to attend normal education. There has in 2012-2013 been media criticism on the fact that students with light problems such as [[dyslexia]] have been placed in special schools, seriously hampering their chances on the labour market.

;Switzerland

Education is controlled by the 26 cantons, and so special education programs vary from place to place.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt; However, integration is typical.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt; Students are assessed according to their individual learning goals.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

'''United Kingdom'''

In [[England and Wales]] the [[acronym]] ''SEN'' for [[Special Educational Needs]] denotes the condition of having special educational needs, the services which provide the support and the programmes and staff which implement the education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/wholeschool/sen/ |title=Special education needs, Special needs education |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306171514/http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/wholeschool/sen/ |archivedate=6 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In England ''SEN PPS'' refers to the Special Educational Needs Parent Partnership Service. ''SENAS'' is the special educational needs assessment service, which is part of the Local Authority. ''SENCO'' refers to a special educational needs coordinator, who usually works with schools and the children within schools who have special educational needs. The Special Educational Needs Parent Partnership Services help parents with the planning and delivery of their child's educational provision. The [[Department for Education]] oversees special education in England.

Most students have an individual educational plan, but students may have a group plan in addition to, or instead of, an individual plan. Group plans are used when a group of students all have similar goals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/5vhVPZoIG?url=http://education.staffordshire.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/6C2C3FF2-43F1-40A4-AB6F-77E4CC4602F6/22865/SENCOResourceCentreCompletedocument2.pdf Management of Inclusion].  The SENCO Resource Centre, part 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Scotland]] the [[Additional Support Needs Act]] places an obligation on education authorities to meet the needs of all students in consultation with other agencies and parents. In [[Scotland]] the term Special Educational Needs (SEN), and its variants are not official terminology although the very recent implementation of the [[Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004|Additional Support for Learning Act]] means that both ''SEN'' and ''ASN'' (Additional Support Needs) are used interchangeably in current common practice.

;Turkey

At a young age students who have special needs in Turkey are provided special education from [[Ministry of National Education (Turkey)|The Ministry of Education]], who are responsible in giving them the education that they need.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.angloinfo.com/how-to/turkey/family/schooling-education/special-needs-education|title=Special Needs Education in Turkey - Turkey - Angloinfo|work=Angloinfo|access-date=2017-04-17|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170417154851/https://www.angloinfo.com/how-to/turkey/family/schooling-education/special-needs-education|archive-date=17 April 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to get special education you are required certain things:
* "Residency certificate&amp;nbsp;
* Written application by the parents to the school administration&amp;nbsp;
* Personal development report of the child (if already registered)&amp;nbsp;
* Child's health report from the hospital." &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  
All special-needs students receive an [[Individualized Education Program]] (BEP) that outlines how the school will meet the student's individual needs. The [[Özel Eğitim Kurumları Yönetmeliği]] (ÖEKY) requires that students with special needs be provided with a [[Free Appropriate Public Education]] in the [[Least Restrictive Environment]] that is appropriate to the student's needs. Government-run schools provide special education in varying degrees from the least restrictive settings, such as full inclusion, to the most restrictive settings, such as segregation in a [[special school]].

The education offered by the school must be appropriate to the student's individual needs. Schools are not required to maximize the student's potential or to provide the best possible services. Unlike most of the developed world, American schools are also required to provide many medical services, such as [[speech therapy]], if the student needs these services.

According to the Department of Education, approximately 10 percent of all school-aged children) currently receive some type of special education services.

As with most countries in the world, students who are poor, ethnic minorities, or do not speak the dominant language fluently are disproportionately identified as needing special education services.

Before 1978, little action was taken to educate children with disabilities in Columbia. Children would be left home without much interaction with the outside world. In 1985, special education was researched across the country and education programs were created.

The history of special education in Colombia can be categorized into three time periods: the period of neglect, the period of diagnosis and planning, and the emergence of special education. The period of planning ran from the years 1978 to the year 1990. The Ministry of Colombia in 1995 implemented a national plan for the development of special education called "Plan Nacional para el Desarrollo de la Education Especial". The purposes of the plan was to create a national diagnosis of special education and to initiate programs for individuals with disabilities. In 1994, the Ministry of education put the first law into action to introduce special classes in public schools that include students with disabilities, called Law 115. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cuadros|first=Jose|date=May 2005|title=The Status of Disability in Colombia and the Importance of Parental Perceptions on the Development of Special Education|url=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ966524.pdf|journal=Teaching Exceptional Children Plus|volume=1|pages=8|via=google scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt;In 2011, Colombia entered into the Convention of Rights of Persons with Disabilities&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kamenopoulou|first=Leda|date=2018|title=Inclusive Education in the global South?

The most recent development of special education in Colombia was Article 11 of Law 1618, which was passed in 2013. The law states that "the Ministry of Education will define the policy and regulate the scheme of education for persons with special educational needs, promoting educational access and quality under a system based on inclusion in the educational services".

All special-needs students receive an [[Individualized Education Program]] (IEP) that outlines how the school will meet the student's individual needs. The [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA) requires that students with special needs be provided with a [[Free Appropriate Public Education]] in the [[Least Restrictive Environment]] that is appropriate to the student's needs.

Unlike most of the developed world, American schools are also required to provide many medical services, such as [[speech therapy]], if the student needs these services.

According to the Department of Education, approximately 6 million children (roughly 10 percent of all school-aged children) currently receive some type of special education services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.rethinkingschools.org/restrict.asp?path=archive/16_03/Hist163.shtml |title=The History of Special Education|author=Priscilla Pardini |year= 2002 |journal=Rethinking Schools |volume=16 |issue=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As with most countries in the world, students who are poor, ethnic minorities, or do not speak the dominant language fluently are disproportionately identified as needing special education services.&lt;ref name=Blanchett /&gt; Poor, black and Latino urban schools are more likely to have limited resources and to employ inexperienced teachers that do not cope well with student behavior problems, "thereby increasing the number of students they referred to special education."&lt;ref&gt;Tejeda-Delgado, M.

During the 1960s, in some part due to the [[civil rights movement]], some researchers began to study the disparity of education amongst people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ladson-Billings, Gloria |title=The dreamkeepers: successful teachers of African American children |publisher=Jossey-Bass Publishers |location=San Francisco |year=1994 |pages= |isbn=1-55542-668-9 |oclc=30072651}}&lt;/ref&gt; The landmark [[Brown v. Board of Education]] decision, which declared unconstitutional the "[[separate but equal]]" arrangements in public schools for students of different races, paved the way for [[PARC v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]] and [[Mills vs. Board of Education of District of Columbia]], which challenged the segregation of students with special needs. Courts ruled that unnecessary and inappropriate segregation of students with disabilities was unconstitutional.&lt;ref name=Blanchett&gt;Blanchett, W. J. (2009). A retrospective examination of urban education: From "brown" to the resegregation of African Americans in special education—it is time to "go for broke". Urban Education, 44(4), 370–388.&lt;/ref&gt; Congress responded to these court rulings with the federal [[Education for All Handicapped Children Act]] in 1975 (since renamed the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)). This law required schools to provide services to students previously denied access to an appropriate education.

In US government-run schools, the dominant model is [[inclusion (education)|inclusion]]. In the United States, three out of five students with academic learning challenges spend the overwhelming majority of their time in the regular classroom.&lt;ref&gt;Cortiella, C. (2009).

== Integrating technology in special ed. classrooms ==

=== Autism ===
Autism, or Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), refers to a range of conditions. These conditions involve challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, speech and nonverbal communication. They also involve unique strengths and differences. 

[[Autism]] is known as a disability that impairs the social interactions and communication skills of a person. People who are autistic tend to think and act differently than others. Many children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) find themselves comfortable with a device in their hands.&amp;nbsp;For students with autism, there are apps called "visual scene displays" that are most helpful for children who are having difficulty with verbal skills, according to Jules Csillag, a speech-language pathologist who focuses on special ed tech. Apps such as SceneSpeak and Speech with Milo help autistic children develop storytelling skills with text-to-speech voice and interactive storybooks. Using apps like these in a classroom can improve autistic student's verbal skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/20/teaching-technology-autism_n_6865030.html|title=The Technology That's Giving Students With Autism a Greater Voice|date=2015-04-20|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2017-04-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several controversies surrounding the diagnoses and causes of autism. It's now believed that there's no single cause of autism. Research seems to suggest that autism is normally the result of both genetic and environmental influences.

=== Down syndrome ===
If a student has [[down syndrome]], [[assistive technology]] can help with their learning experience. Author of&amp;nbsp;''Down Syndrome: A Promising Future, Together,''&amp;nbsp;Terry Hassold, who got his PhD in human genetics, explains that students with Down syndrome have delays with cognitive ability. Their brains have a late reaction when their neurological system sends a message for any task. Because of this late reaction, they tend to take longer to complete a task than an average students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Down_Syndrome.html?id=wuh9OlwsWaQC|title=Down Syndrome: A Promising Future, Together|last=Hassold|first=Terry J.|last2=Patterson|first2=David|date=1999|publisher=Wiley|isbn=9780471296867|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assistive technology is crucial in helping Down's students with their writing ability. Down syndrome children tend to have shorter, stubbier fingers and a lowered thumb making their ability to write more difficult. Also, some of the usual wrist bones are not formed, making it difficult to hold objects. Slanted desks are one type of assisted technology that can aid in the successful ability to write. A three-ring binder can be used to create a slanted desk by turning the binder sideways. Also, students with Down's often try to hold their pencils by anchoring them against the thumb rather than using the tip of their thumb. Shortened pencils or triangular-shaped pencils encourage students to hold them correctly. Using any of these assistive technologies can help down syndrome students during their educational process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://downsyndromepossibilities.blogspot.com/p/assisstive-technology.html|title=Down Syndrome: Assisstive Technology|website=Down Syndrome|access-date=2017-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Benefits ===
Today many people with disabilities are breaking barriers through the use of technology. For some individuals with disabilities, assistive technology is a necessary tool that enables them to engage in or perform many tasks. Integrating technology will allow students to increase their self-confidence, self-motivation, independence and they will also be able to engage in different activities within the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csun.edu/~hfdss006/conf/2002/proceedings/16.htm|title=2002 Conference Proceedings|website=www.csun.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9211">[[File:Two Teotihuacan Stick-ball players Tepantitla 1.svg|right|thumb|250px|A [[Teotihuacan]] stick-ball player with a bi-color speech scroll.  Note the "tabs" along the outer edge of the speech scroll.]]

In art history, '''speech scroll''' (also called a '''banderole''' or '''phylactery''')&lt;ref name="Petersen2011"&gt;{{harvnb|Petersen|2011|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is an illustrative device denoting speech, song, or, in rarer cases, other types of sound.

Developed independently on two continents, the device was in use by artists within [[Mesoamerica]]n cultures from as early as 650 BC until after the [[Spanish conquest of Mexico|Spanish conquest]] in the 16th century, as well as by European painters during the [[Medieval]] and [[Renaissance]] periods.

While European speech scrolls were drawn as if they were an actual unfurled scroll or strip of [[parchment]], Mesoamerican speech scrolls are merely scroll-''shaped'', looking much like a [[question mark]].

==Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica==
[[File:San Andres Cylinder Seal print 1.svg|right|thumb|300px|A rollout of the [[San Andrés (Mesoamerican site)|San Andrés]] [[cylinder seal]], showing a bird "speaking" the name "3 Ajaw".]]
Speech scrolls are found throughout Mesoamerica.  One of the earliest examples of a Mesoamerican speech scroll was found on an [[Olmec]] [[ceramic]] [[cylinder seal]] dated to approximately 650 BC.  Here two lines issue from a bird's mouth followed by [[glyph (archaeology)|glyphs]] proposed to be "''3 Ajaw''," a ruler's name.&lt;ref&gt;Pohl, Pope, Nagy 2002, pp. 1984–1987&lt;/ref&gt;

The murals of the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Classic era]] site of [[Teotihuacan]] are filled with speech scrolls, in particular the lively (and unexplained) tableaus found within the [[Tepantitla]] compound -- [[:Image:Tepantitla Mountain Stream mural Teotihuacan (Luis Tello).jpg|this mural]], for example, shows no fewer than 20 speech scrolls.

In Mesoamerica, the speech-scroll is usually oriented with the longest outer edge upward, so that the central element (or "tongue") curves downward as it spirals.  Some Mesoamerican speech scrolls are divided lengthwise with each side a different shade.

[[Glyph (archaeology)|Glyphs]] or similar markings rarely appear on the Mesoamerican speech scroll, although "tabs"—small, triangular or square blocks—are sometimes seen along the outer edge.  If the speech scroll represents a tongue, then the tabs may represent teeth, but their meaning or message, if any, is not known.&lt;ref&gt;Holt, ''Endangered Language Fund''.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Selden Codex pg 07, panel 3.jpg|center|thumb|600px|The two figures on the right show the red and white "[[:Image:Tecpatl.jpg|flint knife]]" icon attached to their small speech scrolls, indicating that they are verbally attacking the travellers on the left.  From page 7 of the [[Codex Selden]].{{sfn|famsi}}]]
At times, speech scrolls are decorated with devices that describe the tone of the speech:

*In an engraving at the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] site of [[Chichen Itza]], a ruler's speech scroll takes the form of a serpent.&lt;ref&gt;Coggins 1992, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;
*A Spaniard's speech scroll in a 16th-century [[Aztec codex]] is decorated with feathers to denote "soft, smooth words".&lt;ref&gt;Wishart p.300&lt;/ref&gt;
*In another 16th-century [[codex]], the [[Selden Codex]], two [[Mixtec]] rulers (photo above) are shown insulting two ambassadors through the use of "[[:Image:Tecpatl.jpg|flint knife]]" icons attached to the speech scrolls.&lt;ref&gt;Boone 1994, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

As with many native traditions, use of the speech scroll died out in the decades following the Spanish Conquest.

==European banderoles==
[[File:Strigel 1506-detail.jpg|thumb|300px|A 1506 painting by [[Bernhard Strigel]] with banderole.]]
[[File:Evangeliar heinrich des loewen.jpg|thumb|300px|Scenes of the [[Resurrection]], an [[illuminated manuscript]], 1188.]]

In contrast to the abstract nature of Mesoamerican speech scrolls, Medieval European speech scrolls or '''banderoles''' appear as actual scrolls, floating in apparent three-dimensional space (or in actual space in sculpture). They first become common at the start of the [[Gothic art#Painting|Gothic period]].  Previously, as in [[Byzantine art]], spoken words, if they appeared at all, were usually painted alongside a figure; these are called [[titulus (inscription)|tituli]].  However, earlier works using banderoles are the [[Liuthar Gospels|Aachen Gospels]] of Otto III (c. 975) and the 12th-century English [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] [[Cloisters Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kantorowicz|1997|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter work demonstrates the use of banderoles as attributes for [[Old Testament]] [[prophet]]s, to distinguish them from the book-carrying [[Four Evangelists]] of the [[New Testament]] and other Christian saints, a convention appearing in Italy in the 13th century. It may be seen in the ''[[Santa Trinita Maestà]]'' by [[Cimabue]], ([[Uffizi]], 1280–90), [[Duccio]]'s ''[[Maestà (Duccio)|Maestà]]'' (1308–11), and other works.  The convention had a historical appropriateness, as the Old Testament was originally written on [[scroll]]s, whereas nearly all surviving New Testament manuscripts are [[codices]] (like modern books).  They may also be used for the words of angels, especially [[Gabriel]]'s greeting to Mary in [[Annunciation]] scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Ladis &amp; Maginnis 1997, pp. 155-156&lt;/ref&gt;  During the 14th century, quotations in banderoles increasingly allowed artists to include more complex ideas in their works, though for the moment usually in Latin, thus greatly restricting the audience that could follow them.&lt;ref&gt;Ladis &amp; Maginnis 1997, pp. 156-161&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike Mesoamerican speech scrolls, European speech scrolls usually contain the spoken words, much like a modern-day [[speech balloon]].  The majority of these are in religious works and contain Biblical quotations from the figure depicted – Old Testament prophets for example, were often shown with an appropriate quotation from their work.  Because the words are usually religious in nature, the speech scroll is often written in Latin even when appearing in [[woodcut]] illustrations for books written in the [[vernacular]].&lt;ref&gt;Hilmo 2004, p. xxiv.&lt;/ref&gt;  This would also enable the illustration to be used in editions in other languages.

European speech scrolls may at times be seen in secular works as well and may also contain the name of a person to identify them.  On carved figures the words would usually be painted on the scroll and have since worn away.  In some Late Gothic and Renaissance works, and in architectural decoration, very elaborate empty banderoles seem to be for decorative purposes only.

The European speech scroll fell out of favor largely due to an increasing interest in [[realism (visual arts)|realism]] in painting; the [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]] had a similar decline.

'''''Stealing the Mystic Lamb''''' is the title of a non-fiction book by art historian [[Noah Charney]].  The full title of the book is '''''Stealing the Mystic Lamb: The True Story of the World’s Most Coveted Masterpiece'''''.  The book was published in 2010 by PublicAffairs.  It tells the story of The ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]'' (also known as ''The Adoration of the Mystic Lamb,'' or simply ''The Mystic Lamb''), a monumental oil painting by the Flemish master [[Jan van Eyck]], currently on display in the cathedral of [[Saint Bavo]], in the city of [[Ghent]].  The work is arguably the most influential painting in history, and it is also the most frequently stolen artwork of all-time.  Charney’s book tells the story of the artwork and the many crimes and mysteries of which it was the victim since its completion in 1432.

==Critical Reaction==
Charney’s book received much critical praise, including the following review from [[Kirkus Reviews]] (15 July 2010):

"Charney (Art History/American Univ. of Rome; The Art Thief, 2007, etc.) unsnarls the tangled history of Jan van Eyck’s 15th-century ''The Ghent Altarpiece (aka The Mystic Lamb)'', “the most desired and victimized object of all time.”
With a novelist’s sense of structure and tension, the author adds an easy familiarity with the techniques of oil painting and with the intertwining vines of art and political and religious history. He begins near the end of World War II. As the Reich’s military fortunes crumbled, the Allies scrambled to find where the Nazis concealed their tens of thousands of stolen artworks, many slated for Hitler’s proposed “super museum.” Among them was the Altarpiece. Charney pauses to describe the large work, which comprises 20 individual painted panels, hinged together. Art historians admire it not just for its supreme craftsmanship—described clearly by the author—but also for its historical significance as the world’s first major oil painting. Charney also lists a number of “firsts” that the work represents (e.g., the first to use directed spotlighting) and sketches the biography of van Eyck, which makes Shakespeare’s seem richly detailed by comparison. Commissioned to create the altarpiece for the Saint Bavo Cathedral in Ghent, Belgium, van Eyck took some six years to complete it. As religious and political strife waxed and waned, the painting was always in danger. The Calvinists didn’t like it (the Catholics promptly hid it); Napoleon, perhaps history’s greatest art thief, craved it; a cathedral fire threatened it; the Germans came for it in World War I and again in World War II. Even now, one panel remains at large, though some argue that the replacement copy is actually the original.
A brisk tale of true-life heroism, villainy, artistry and passion."

'''The Author'''

Noah Charney holds advanced degrees in art history from [[The Courtauld Institute]] and [[Cambridge University]].  He is the founding director of [[ARCA, the Association for Research into Crimes against Art]], a non-profit think tank and consultancy group on issues in art crime (www.artcrime.info).  His work in the field of art crime has been praised in such forums as The New York Times Magazine, Time Magazine, The Wall Street Journal, BBC Radio, National Public Radio, El Pais, Vogue, Vanity Fair, and Tatler among others.  He has appeared on radio and television, including ITV, CNBC, and MSNBC and he is in constant demand as a lecturer.  Having recently taught at [[Yale University]], Charney is now Adjunct Professor of Art History at the [[American University of Rome]].  Charney is the author of numerous articles and a novel, [[The Art Thief]] (Atria 2007), which is currently translated into fourteen languages and is a best-seller in four countries.  He is the editor of an academic essay collection entitled [[Art &amp; Crime: Exploring the Dark Side of the Art World]], published by Praeger in 2009 and the [[Museum Time]] series of guides to museums in Spain, published by geoPlaneta in 2010.  He lives in Italy and lectures internationally in the subjects of art history and art crime.

"We are the first generation with the insight of the new global risks facing humanity, that people and societies are the biggest drivers of global change. The basic analysis is not in question: we cannot continue on our current path and need to take action quickly. Science can guide us in identifying the pathway to global sustainability, provided that it also engages in an open dialogue with society," says [[Professor]] [[Mario Molina]], who acted as judge and received the Nobel Prize in [[Chemistry]] in 1995.

==Conclusions==
Key conclusion of the Stockholm Memorandum include:
* that environmental sustainability is a precondition for poverty eradication, economic development, and social justice; 
* that achieving the [[Millennium Development Goals]] is a top priority, since almost a third of the world scrapes by on less than $2 per day;
* that the [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP) is insufficient as an economic indicator and that, therefore, new human welfare indicators must be developed; 
* that global warming must be kept below 2 degrees Celsius, which, in turn, requires a global [[carbon dioxide]] emissions peak no later than 2015;
* that a new agricultural revolution must be fostered so as to produce more food in a sustainable way on agricultural land currently used.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stockholm Resilience Centre]], [[Stockholm University]], 31 
May 2011, http://www.stockholmresilience.org/newsandvideos/generalnews/thestockholmmemorandum.5.4bb0052912fd16044aa800011821.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10489">'''Strategic sustainable investing''' ('''SSI''') is an [[investment strategy]] that recognizes and rewards leading companies that are moving society towards [[sustainability]]. SSI relies on a consensus-based scientific definition of [[sustainability]], and the assumption that ‘''[[Backcasting]] from Principles of Sustainability''’,&lt;ref&gt;Holmberg, J and Robèrt, K-H “Backcasting from non-overlapping sustainability principles – a framework for strategic planning”, International .Journal of Sustainable Development and World Ecology, 7:1–18. 2000&lt;/ref&gt; whereby a vision of a sustainable future is set as the reference point for developing strategic actions, is the preferred approach to strategically move a company towards sustainability. It was developed by researchers at the [[Blekinge Institute of Technology]] in Sweden.

==The strategic sustainable investment system==
SSI outlines that the financial investment will offer a competitive risk-adjusted return, while providing investment capital to companies that are actively attempting to become more sustainable. It implies lower exposure to sustainability-related risks and it considers financial metrics together with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) aspects, as well as strategy analyses to educate investment decision-making.&lt;ref name="SSI"&gt;[http://www.bth.se/fou/cuppsats.nsf/535439ccd73cc824c1256608004f0529/a6dcb300241ca812c125746000500631!OpenDocument Blandford, Nick, Timothy Nash and André Winter “Strategic Sustainable Investing: Recognizing Value in Transitional Leadership.” Master's thesis, Blekinge Institute of Technology, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

Characteristics of SSI:&lt;br /&gt;
•	Lower sustainability risk exposure &lt;br /&gt;
•	A definition of sustainability based on scientific consensus&lt;ref name= "tools and concepts"&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VFX-44KVV9J-1&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=214b19c668891d8b85307af38cb9017c Robèrt, K.-H. “Tools and concepts for sustainable development, how do they relate to a framework for sustainable development, and to each other?” Journal of Cleaner Production 8: 243–254. 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
•	Primarily driven by movement towards sustainability&lt;br /&gt;
•	Considers financial, ESG, and strategy analysis

SSI operates by prioritizing investment capital allocation to companies that are taking the lead in shifting away from unsustainable behaviour towards new ways of doing business. This capital allocation will provide an incentive for companies to move forward in a sustainable direction. This movement is reported in [[corporate social responsibility]] (CSR) and other extra-financial reports, but is also recorded in traditional areas of a firm’s financial [[balance sheets]].

By incorporating sustainability investment and returns into traditional financial reporting, a clearer picture of the bottom-line impact of a company’s actions towards sustainability is made available. In this positive reinforcing loop, greater investor returns and [http://plilend.com/ increased movement towards sustainability] are generated with every cycle.

[[Image:Economic analysis chart of movement towards sustainability.jpg|350px]]&lt;br /&gt;''[[Causal loop diagram]] illustrating the strategic sustainable investment''&lt;ref name="SSI"/&gt;

[[Institutional investor]]s, such as mutual and pension funds, take a longer-term position on investments and are thus ideally suited to incorporate SSI strategies.

==Theory background==
The theoretical foundation of SSI is strongly linked to ''strategic sustainable development'', made popular by [[The Natural Step]] and its founder Dr. [[Karl-Henrik Robèrt]].

This strategy resembles [[socially responsible investing]] (SRI), a growing practice amongst ethical investors. Nevertheless, SSI recognizes the gaps&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.responsibleinvesting.org/database/dokuman/SRI%20Report%2010-04_word.pdf Hawken, P. “How the SRI industry has failed to respond to people who want to invest with conscience and what can be done to change it.” Natural Capital Institute. 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; of SRI pointed by several academics and practitioners and presents some alternatives.

==SSI analysis tool==
In order to evolve current SRI and traditional investment practices into Strategic Sustainable Investment, two gaps must be considered:

a.	The recognition of companies with true leading strategies for a sustainable future&lt;br /&gt;
b.	A robust and well defined link must be made between movement towards sustainability and higher investment returns

The SSI analysis tool addresses the first gap by measuring a company’s strategy for addressing sustainability. It allows investors to recognize which companies are leading the transition in a new direction, and which are most likely to be strong performers in tomorrow’s market.

This tool is divided in two main parts: the emerging sustainability issue (esi) chart and the strategy analysis component:

===ESI chart===
[[Image:ESI Chart.jpg|right|thumb|250px|ESI Chart Sample&lt;ref name="SSI"/&gt;]]
The Sectoral Emerging Sustainability Issue (ESI) chart is used to identify which aspects of a determined market sector will become a socio-environmental problem. In the common sense, an issue is called ‘emergent’ when it gets media exposure. Instead, the Tool relies on scientific [[The_Natural_Step#System_conditions_of_sustainability|Principles of sustainability]]&lt;ref&gt;Holmberg, J., and K.-H. Robèrt “The Rationale behind the System Conditions”. Department of Physical Resource Theory, Chalmers University of Technology, Goteborg, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holmberg, J., K-H. Robèrt, and K-E. Eriksson “Socio-ecological principles for sustainability”. Getting down to earth — Practical applications of ecological economics. Washington, DC: Island Press, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; to identify what is emergent.

It exposes which Sustainability Issues present high risks for companies within that sector in the short-term; as well as which Issues will be emerging in the medium and long-terms. Due to differences within a sector, the Sectoral ESI Chart should be made as specific as needed, being flexible to account for various geographical locations and sub-sector subtleties.

The process of composing an ESI chart follows:

Once a sector is selected for an ESI analysis, a list of relevant sustainability issues is assembled. This baseline analysis will result in a list of issues outlining the subject sector’s strengths and concerns that impact society and the environment. Next, prioritization colours are assigned to each sustainability issue: red for very high priority; orange for high priority; yellow for medium priority, and green for low priority according to its assessment in each of three categories: urgency, severity, and systematic contribution.

''Urgency'' assesses the time frame pressing each Issue. The ''severity'' assesses the seriousness of the Issue, in terms of its potential consequences for the environment, society, and companies within that sector. The ''systematic contribution'' is used to gauge the sector’s contribution to the overall Issue.

[[Image:ESI WF.jpg|none|350px]]&lt;br /&gt;''To fill out the Chart, Researchers follow this process flow.''&lt;ref name="SSI"/&gt;

===Strategy analysis component===
====Strategic plan====
The Strategic Plan element assesses the subject company’s planned goals in relation to the emerging sustainability issue (ESI). The qualitative description includes, but is not limited to, information regarding:  public commitments planned operational and business initiatives, political action/ lobbying, and third party partnerships (with NGOs, consultative firms etc.). There is also a comment on the subject company’s core business in relation to the ESI; as this will assist in determining the subject company’s exposure to the emerging risk.

====Strategic actions====
The strategic actions element looks at assessing the subject company’s recent actions taken in relation to the emerging sustainability issue (ESI), thus determining whether the subject company is ‘walking the talk’ in comparison to the vision and goals outlined.
The subject company’s actions are seen through the lens of [[strategic sustainable development]], and thus three questions are emphasized as a mental guideline:

a.	Does this action provide a competitive return on investment (ROI)?&lt;br /&gt;
b.	Is this action taking the subject company in the right direction?&lt;br /&gt;
c.	Is this action a versatile platform?

====Strategy analysis graph====
The strategy analysis graph shows the subject company’s planned path for dealing with the ESI, tangible progress made, and if existent, government regulations. The trajectory of the subject company’s planned path reveals the extent of their future risk exposure. This graph is placed in the center of the strategy analysis page.

[[Image:Strategy Analysis Graph.jpg|none|thumb|300px|Sample of strategy analysis graph&lt;ref name="SSI"/&gt;]]

====Assurance assessment====
The assurance assessment provides an overall impression of the validity of the information gathered. This assessment may be applied if the data is verified by an external third party, or if discrepancy is evident between different sources of information used on the report.

'''''The Birth of Biopolitics''''' is a part of [[Foucault's lectures at the Collège de France|a lecture series]] by French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] at the [[Collège de France]] between 1978 and 1979 and published posthumously based on audio recordings. In it, Foucault develops further the notion of [[biopolitics]] introduced in a previous lecture series, ''Security, Territory, Population'', by tracing the ways in which the eighteenth-century political economy marked the birth of a new governmental [[rationality]]. Foucault uses the term [[Governmentality]] and raising questions of [[Political science]], [[political philosophy]] and [[social policy]] concerning the role and status of the [[State (polity)|State]] and [[neo-liberalism]] in twentieth century politics.

== New rationality ==

For Foucault, [[biopolitics]] is political power exercised on whole populations in every aspect of human life.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' p. 363 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault discusses the basic definition of the practices of the neoliberal art of government. Foucault then tries to redefine the boundaries set by liberal thought on this matter. Foucault concentrates on the monetary aspect of government as a point of concern, frugal government, the art of maximum and a minimum and between the total opposite minimum and maximum.&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth of Biopolitics'' pp. 27-29 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Foucault looks at the early institutional practices of this method of frugal government, which starts from the early Middle Ages down to the early 16th and 17th centuries. The market appears from the early Middle Ages where the function of interest on money lending was strictly prohibited; one of the reasons being that the church was the main institution lending money at interest on church property where rental income was charged on church property a primary source of income for the church and it would have brought down the price of the church rental income if faced with rival competitors. Justification, according to Foucault, for the market was justice which was why the market existed in the first place. But, what was meant by justice? Foucault offers this explanation; it was a site of justice in the sense that the sale price fixed in the market was seen, both by theorist and in practice, as a just price, or at any rate a price that should be the just price, which meant to the theorists of the day a price that was to have a certain relationship with work performed, with the needs of the merchants, and of course, with the consumers needs and possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth of Biopolitics'' pp. 27-53 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

The next general theme Foucault introduces is the German [[Ordoliberalism]], the [[Freiburg School]] which produced general problems among themselves, namely the state apparatus and its reconstruction after the Second World War. This general theme led to neo-liberalism heavy reliances on the law obviously, but it too, had to produce a new kind of consensus and a rearrangement consensus between the general populace; the working population, those engaged in production. This general or collective consensus produced 'economic partners' in this so-called 'economic game',&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth of Biopolitics'' pp. 51-73 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; such as; investors, employers, government officials, work force, and trade union officials. Foucault then offers some explanation on what was the reasoning behind this consensus between all these so-called different economic partners. According to Foucault this produced another kind of consensus, which was political power of the electoral community, not the political power of the right to vote, but the right of the political community to exchange seats, a rearrangement of the very relations of the so-called change of 'government' which gives and protects legitimacy. Which becomes political consensus, inasmuch as the 'economic partners 'accept the economic game of freedom. This is very much on neo-liberalism agenda, which according to Foucault was exactly the agenda that neo-liberalism required.

A strong Deutschmark, a satisfactory rate of economic growth, increased wages, an expanding purchasing power, and a favorable balance of payments which became a by product of the effects of good government. Foucault reads into this that in contemporary German which was in reality a founding consensus of the state. Foucault notices that this formation of a liberal type of governmentality had general shifts within this circle which can be traced back to the 18th century old or classical liberalism programmed by the [[Physiocrats]], [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Turgot]], and the other economists, for whom the problem was the exact opposite. The problem that neo-liberalism had to resolve was the following: given the existence of a legitimate state, which is fully functional under the police state with all its administration form of police state, how can this be limited within the existing state and, above all, allow for the necessary economic freedom within it.

For Foucault, this was the exact opposite because after the [[Second World War]], the war machine that was unleashed was due to the fact that the system of economic rationality had broken down and the organisational network of world trade and its accompanied trade settlement system had completely become untenable, in which trust in the final payment settlement system had completely vanished, therefore initiating the military machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=The network of world trade : a companion volume to "Europe's trade" |publisher=League of Nations |year=1942 |oclc=2835669 |pages=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The World Trade Network |first1=Luca |last1=De Benedicts |first2=Luca |last2=Tajoli |date=2010-09-15 |url=http://www.eief.it/files/2010/10/luca-de-benedictis.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Policy of society ==
Another theme Foucault concentrates on is the neo-liberalism conception of social effects, ''[[Gesellschaftspolitik]]'', known in English, from the German, as the ''policy of society'',&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth of Biopolitics'' pp. 129-157 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth of Biopolitics'' pp. 101-128 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth of Biopolitics'' pp. 159-184 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; this policy of society addresses the whole consensus of society. But this ''Gesellschaftspolitik'' had a two sided inconsistency, it had to produce the willing actors who take part in the economic process to accept the reality of their economic position and therefore their fate. The working population or labor force, the ones involved in production, madness, disease, medicine, delinquency, sexuality, but somehow, none of these faults/errors never existed before practices were involved and invented to become part of collective consciousness within practices. Foucault deals with this problem as necessary intrinsic operations of government which inextribably can produce ''regimes of truth'' (Foucault means regimes of truth as necessary social practices which become necessary objects of knowledge).

The ability to extrapolate a collective of co-ordinate errors becoming co-ordinated practices which become something that did not exist in the first place, but now becomes established systems of knowledge objects.&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth of Biopolitics'' pp. 1-25 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth of Biopolitics'' pp. 27-51 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; The political regimes of truth (political power upon every aspect of human social life), the battle between legitimacy, submitting to a fabricated division between true and false. Foucault begins to try to trace back through time how this was at all possible, Foucault manages this task by reading into the set of practices interwoven into the policy of society, this was accomplished from the 16th until the 18th century where there was a whole set of practices of tax levies, customs, charges, manufacture regulations, regulations of grain prices, the protection and codification of market practices, etc.

This was well conceived by the exercise of sovereign rights, feudal rights, as the maintenance of customs, as effective procedure of enrichment for the financial administration of the general sovereign or the tax authorities, or as techniques for preventing urban revolt due to the discontent of this or that group of subjects.&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth of Biopolitics'' pp. 129-150 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault takes a look at these general practices through looking at the economic practices involved from the 18th century (where [[Mercantilism]] was at its peak) where a coherence strategy established an intelligible mechanism which provided a coherent link, together these different practices and their effects, and consequently allows one to judge all these practices as good or bad, not in terms of a law or moral principle, but in terms of propositions subject to the false dichotomy between true and false. Governments, Foucault noticed, were compelled to enter this competitive environment, by doing so entering into new regimes of truth with the fundamental effect of reconfiguring all the questions formally beset by the art of government.

Foucault turns his attention to [[ordoliberalism]]'s view on social policy and how this can be woven into society's political power which differentates from [[Adam Smith]]'s liberalism two centuries earlier. This problem was faced head on by ordoliberalism; how can the overall exercise of political power be modeled on the principles of a market economy? To accomplish this the old version of classic liberalism had to be subjected to a whole series of modifications. The first set of transformations was the dissociation of the market economy from the political principle of [[laissez-faire]], this uncoupling of the market and laissez-faire was replaced with, not abandon by a theory of pure competition which produced a formal structure and formal properties which could lay the fundamental principle of the compective structure that assured economic regulation through the price mechanism. This is a break from traditional liberalism principles.Founded by traditional liberals such as [[Walter Lippmann]] and expressed by many other traditional liberals such as [[Jacques Rueff]], [[Wilhelm Röpke]], [[Alexander Rüstow]], [[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Robert Marjolin]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], and their intermediaries and a non-economist, but however, was highly influential, according to Foucault [[Raymond Aron]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth Of Biopolitics'' pp.133-157 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth Of Biopolitics'' p.152 see note 12 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

How would neo-liberalism define the new governmental action? Foucault traces three examples which neo-liberalism call a conformable economic action; firstly the question of monopolies which they claimed differed somewhat from classic liberalism. The classic conception of the economy as the monopoly seen as somehow semi-neutral, semi-necessary consequence of the competition in a [[capitalist]] system. The neo-liberal dream of competition cannot be left to develop without monopolistic phenomena appearing at the same time. This would eventually have the effect, of suppressing the operation of mechanism that facilitate, bring with them, and hopefully determine its eventual destiny. However, Foucault notices specific problems began to emerge for neo-liberalism, not only specific to neo-liberalism was how to incorporate civil society, political power; and [[Homo oeconomicus]] into a non-substitutable, irreducible atom of interest. Foucault makes the starting point of his investigations into this process from the 18th century where ''Homo oeconomicus'' has to be integrated into the system of which he is a part.&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth of Biopolitics'' pp. 215-237 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Civil society ==
The concept ''[[Homo economicus]]'' had specific problems being interwoven into the new-found economic process of the 18th century. Foucault manages to trace this anomaly through the subject of right (known as [[consent of the governed]] the theory of right of that legal theorists of the 18th century tried to establish during their legal discourse) which did receive a great deal of attention because of what was perceived at the time of problems regarding the sovereign's power. The subject of right had to perform slight modifications because of the implication of him (the subject of right) limiting the sovereign's power. Which certainly differed from classical liberalism's conception of the sovereign power, which from the 16th century was conceived of as impenetrable to any rational discourse. The sovereign was conceived of as absolute, but the discovery of the people, subject of rights, homo oeconomicus, changed all that because of the arrival of market practices (the market system of capitalism) from the 18th century. Even the Physiocrats insisted that the market, the sovereign had to really respect the market.

How could this new problematic of liberalism, the sovereign, the market, and the new-found political power, homo oeconomicus which economic activity had at least specific patterns of correlation could be moulded into one tight unit? Foucault seeks the answer to this with a new field of reference, [[civil society]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth of Biopolitics'' pp. 290-316 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth of Biopolitics'' pp. 267-289 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault answers this question on the process of how to govern through governmental technology, the new neo-liberals, economic liberals sought to have a heterogeneity of the economic and the judicial which must be pegged to an economy understood as process of production and exchange. [[Civil society]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth of Biopolitics'' pp. 291-316 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; according to Foucault's analysis, must place particular attention to its correlation of technology of government, the rational measure of which must be judicially pegged to an economy understood as the process of production and exchange.&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth of Biopolitics'' pp. 267-290 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

What made this version of civil society tick? Foucault makes the amalgamation of civil society into society, which at the end of the 18th century became known as the nation (now known to us as the [[nation state]]).&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth of Biopolitics'' pp. 291-316 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; This became omnipresent, nothing was allowed to escape, which was to conform to the rules of right, and a government which nevertheless respects the specificity of the economy, will be a government that manages civil society, the nation, society, and the social. Foucault continues the theme on Homo oeconomicus which became part and parcel to this feature, ''Homo oeconomicus'' and civil society were two inseparable features and belonged to the same ensemble of the technology of liberal governmentality. For Foucault this was no mere coincidence, since the 19th century, civil society has always been referred to in [[political philosophy]] discourse as a fixed reality, which according to this theory, was outside of government or the state or state apparatuses or institutions. This omnipresent has many characteristics and one its main features are a primary and immediate reality which forms part of modern governmental technology.

Foucault views this governmental characteristic as simply the direct correlation of modern society's direct association with madness, disease, sexuality, criminal recidivism and criminal delinquency which he calls transactional realities. Although civil society, along with its associated governmental technologies haven't always existed they are nonetheless real, by real he simply means the power dynamic and their interplay with the rest of society in which all those involved, everything within it constantly eludes them. It is in Foucault's analysis where he makes four important points on this governmental modern technology of biopolitics; an absolute correlative to the form of governmental technology which liberalism associated itself with, and it is pegged, tied to the specificity of economic process.

How were all three incorporated into rational liberalism philosophical discourse? Foucault cites the well-known texts of [[Adam Ferguson]]: ''Essay on the History of Civil Society''; from the 18th century to show how liberalism approached this problem from different angles and [[Adam Smith]] and his ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' which complement one another with regards civil society. First: there is a political and social correlate in terms of civil society. Second, civil society as principle of spontaneous synthesis; third, civil society as permanent matrix of political power; and fourth, civil society as the motor element that drives human history.&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth of Biopolitics'' pp. 267-290 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth of Biopolitics'' pp. 291-316 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

TJM has been at the centre of a number of political controversies including the use of the "Australien" logo that is at the heart of a Bill to change the Australian Criminal Code Act as well as the divisive Australia Day piracy video.

== History ==

TJM was founded by [[Giordano Nanni]], an Australian [[historian]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/display/person194914|title=DR GIORDANO NANNI - The University of Melbourne|date=2012-09-11|access-date=2018-06-11|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911052814/https://www.findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/display/person194914|archivedate=11 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[author]], [[Satire|satirist]] and [[Video production|video producer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://logancij.com/speaker/giordano/|title=Giordano Nanni|work=The Logan CIJ Symposium|access-date=2018-06-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; TJM started publishing on [[YouTube|YouTube]] in May 2008 with the first episode of [[Juice Rap News]] premiering on 4 October 2009.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKRw8GAAtm27q4R3Q0kst_g|title=thejuicemedia|website=YouTube|language=en|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 May 2016 Juice Media launched the Honest Government ad series with Visit Australia.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thejuicemedia.com/about/|title=About - The Juice Media|work=The Juice Media|access-date=2018-06-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 January 2017 TJM released the controversial ''Australia Day'' (Piracy parody).

== Controversy ==

=== Australien Coat of Harms ===
[[File:Australien Govt - Coat of Harms - by THEJUICEMEDIA.png|thumb|Australien Coat of Harms as created by The Juice Media]]The Australien Coat of Harms was created as the backdrop to the fictitious Department of Genuine Satire for the Honest Government Adverts. There are a number of notable differences between the fictitious Coat of Harms and the [[Coat of arms of Australia|Commonwealth Coat of Arms]] that it lampoons including:

* A stylised alien head replacing the Commonwealth star
* The heads of the emu and kangaroo have been replaced with surveillance cameras
* The bar under the star has been replaced with a buffering bar
* The 6 state emblems on the shield have been replaced with a pirate ship
* The "Australia" wording under the shield has been replaced with "Not the Real Logo"

In September 2017 TJM received an e-mail from the Australian National Symbols Officer requesting that the use of the satirical logo no longer be used as they had received complaints from the members of the public about the logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/thejuicemedia/status/906104236789841920/photo/1|title=theJuice on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=2018-06-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coincidentally 5 days later a Bill was proposed to [[Parliament of Australia|Australian parliament]] to amend the [[Criminal law of Australia|Criminal Code Act 1995]].

The summary for the Bill was stated as:&lt;blockquote&gt;Amends the Criminal Code Act 1995 to: introduce new offences for a person recklessly or intentionally representing themselves to be, or to be acting on behalf of, or with the authority of, a Commonwealth entity or service; and introduce a new injunction power to allow authorised persons to seek injunctive relief to prevent a person from engaging in conduct in contravention of the new offences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_LEGislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r5973|title=Criminal Code Amendment (Impersonating a Commonwealth Body) Bill 2017|last=corporateName=Commonwealth Parliament; address=Parliament House|first=Canberra|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The case for the amendments to the Bill were presented in the Senate by the [[Attorney general|Attorney-General]] [[The Honourable|Hon.]] [[George Brandis]] [[Queen's Counsel|QC]]&lt;ref name="thejuicemedia"&gt;{{Citation|last=thejuicemedia|title=George Brandis on Genuine Satire|date=2017-11-12|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLzPuNL0BKU|accessdate=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were a number of public submissions to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee overseeing the proposed amendments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Legal_and_Constitutional_Affairs/ImpersonatingaCommBody/Submissions|title=Submissions|last=7111;|first=corporateName=Commonwealth Parliament; address=Parliament House, Canberra, ACT, 2600; contact=+61 2 6277|website=www.aph.gov.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the submissions were pieces from [[Australian Lawyers for Human Rights]] and [[Electronic Frontiers Australia]] both of which expressed concerns with the Bill with regards to freedom of speech and lack of safeguards and ambiguous wording in the Bill that could result in legal action being taken against critics and satirists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/DocumentStore.ashx?id=310dc8e6-72ba-4760-9f6e-4ac8ae2a2147&amp;subId=561090|title=Australian Lawyers for Human Rights|last=|first=|date=|website=Parliament of Australia|access-date=10 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/10/australian-government-wants-give-satire-boot|title=Australian Government Wants to Give Satire The Boot|last=Nazer|first=Daniel|date=2017-10-20|work=Electronic Frontier Foundation|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://alhr.org.au/2017-alhr-human-rights-report-card/|title=2017 ALHR Human Rights Report Card - ALHR|date=2018-01-11|work=ALHR|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''It is unfortunate that the Australian government cannot distinguish between impersonation and satire. But it is especially worrying because the government has proposed legislation that would impose jail terms for impersonation of a government agency. Some laws against impersonating government officials can be appropriate (Australia, like the U.S., is seeing telephone scams from fraudsters claiming to be tax officials). But the proposed legislation in Australia lacks sufficient safeguards. Moreover, the recent letter to Juice Media shows that the government may lack the judgment needed to apply the law fairly.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20171023/07223238458/australian-lawmakers-propose-outlawing-parody-having-sense-humor.shtml|title=Australian Lawmakers Propose Outlawing Parody, Having A Sense Of Humor|work=Techdirt.|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This was a sentiment echoed by [[Adam Bandt|Adam Bandt]] [[Member of parliament|MP]] in a speech to parliament in which he addressed the topics of freedom of speech and the rights to "mercilessly troll government".&lt;ref name="thejuicemedia"/&gt;

[[Nick McKim|Senator Nick McKim]] is on record as saying: &lt;blockquote&gt;"''Where does this leave satire in Australia? Does it mean that figures such as [[Shaun Micallef]], The Juice Media and [[The Chaser]] team, as well as upcoming comedians, will have to think twice before they crack jokes lest they find themselves on the stand or in the slammer? As the government's then Attorney-General put it, 'The test of what genuine satire is will be, as I said, up to the [[court]]s.' [[Law of Australia|Australian common law]] has never previously had to deal with defining genuine satire, meaning that satirists will be in the dark as to the potential limits of their jokes until a body of common law has been established''."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.openaustralia.org.au/senate/?id=2018-05-10.187.1|title=Criminal Code Amendment...: 10 May 2018: Senate debates (OpenAustralia.org)|website=www.openaustralia.org.au|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;If successfully passed those found to be in breach of the new amendment can face 2–5 years imprisonment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:%22legislation/billsdgs/5767580%22|title=ParlInfo - Criminal Code Amendment (Impersonating a Commonwealth Body) Bill 2017|website=parlinfo.aph.gov.au|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australia Day (Piracy Parody) ===
On 24 January 2017 TJM released a [[parody]] of a well known [[Copy protection|anti-piracy]] ad, colloquially dubbed "[[You Wouldn't Steal a Car]]", called Australia Day (Piracy parody).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=thejuicemedia|title=Australia Day (Piracy parody)|date=2017-01-24|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UytdM-x3cv4|accessdate=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video compared the celebration of [[Australia Day]] (Jan 26), which marks the arrival of the [[First Fleet]],  to a number of infamous events in history. The events depicted include [[Nazism|Nazi's]] "[[Final Solution]]", dropping of the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bomb on Hiroshima]] and [[September 11 attacks|Sep 11 attacks on the Twin Towers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4158072/Ad-compares-Australia-Day-September-11.html?ito=social-twitter_DailyMailAU|title=Ad compares Australia Day to celebrating September 11|last=|first=|date=|work=UK Daily Mail|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/lanesainty/this-video-compares-the-settling-of-australia-to-911-hiroshi|title=This Video Compares Australian Settlement To 9/11, Hiroshima And The Holocaust|work=BuzzFeed|access-date=2018-06-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The video was released as part of the Change the Date campaign (#[[changethedate]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://quadrant.org.au/magazine/2018/01-02/australia-dystopia/|title=Australia Dystopia|access-date=2018-06-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; which calls for changing the date of Australia Day by [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]], [[Torres Strait Islands|Torres Straight]] Islander and wider community groups.&lt;blockquote&gt;''Many believe celebrating on January 26 is insensitive as the arrival of the First Fleet marked the beginning of a brutal history which saw mass killings of Indigenous Australians.''&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-01-25/invasion-day-video-compares-australia-day-to-september-11/8211630?pfmredir=sm|title='You wouldn't celebrate September 11': Ad compares Australia Day to tragic world events|date=2017-01-25|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This video incited a great deal of debate, especially in social media, with a lot of negative sentiments expressed especially at the comparison of Jan 26 to other historical dates:&lt;blockquote&gt;"I understand the sentiment, but these are really poor examples. Not one of these events resulted in the creation of a sustainable society/civilisation," Shaun Fielding said.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The [[National Australia Day Council]] said in response:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Though 26 January marks this specific event, today Australia Day celebrations reflect contemporary Australia: our diverse society and landscape, our remarkable achievements and our bright future. It also is an opportunity to reflect on our nation's history, and to consider how we can make Australia an even better place in future," &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In 2017 the Australia Day celebrations in [[Fremantle]], [[Western Australia]] were cancelled and replaced with more culturally inclusive celebrations 2 days later on Jan 28. This was seen as a litmus test for the #changethedate movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-01-24/fremantle-divided-over-cancellation-of-australia-day-festivities/8207954|title='An act of betrayal': City divided over Australia Day cancellation|date=2017-01-24|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Juice Rap News ==
{{Main|Juice Rap News}}
An internet based Australian satirical news show consisting of a rapped "news report" with [[social commentary]] using comical [[Rapping|rap lyrics]].

== Honest Government Ads ==
[[File:Honest Government Ads - Behind The Scenes.jpg|thumb|Behind the scenes with voice-actor Lucy Cahill at The Juice Media]]
The Honest Government Ads are filmed in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. They are written by Giordano Nanni who creates the series in collaboration with Lucy Cahill. Actors appearing in the series are credited as Ellen Burbidge, Zoë Amanda Wilson and Matylda Buczko-Koren with Lucy Cahill also being credited with the voice overs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

These videos are a satirical take on [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]] advertising. Each video targets a current social or political issue and highlights potential consequences of the Government's position and policy on that issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.themandarin.com.au/86230-new-crimes-impersonating-federal-agencies-poorly-drafted/|title=Critics say new crimes of 'impersonating' federal agencies are poorly drafted {{!}} The Mandarin|date=2017-11-22|work=The Mandarin|access-date=2018-06-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''"And an increasingly popular way of sharing the ‘honest truth' about political events is through satirical videos, something that The Juice Media does brilliantly. They bring attention to the ridiculousness of political and worldwide events, not only by making people laugh but by being blunt about what is going on and how people are being taken advantage of. Not everyone agrees with their left wing politics, but it gets people talking."''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.magnetofilms.co.uk/charity-video-with-bite/|title=Charity video with bite - using satire to provoke action|date=2018-01-10|work=Magneto Films|access-date=2018-06-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[File:The Juice Media filming of Honest Government Ads.jpg|thumb|Filming Honest Government Ads with Ellen Burbidge]]In an [[Al Jazeera English]] article looking at Satire in the [[Donald Trump|Trump]] era Giordano Nanni was included in the discussion talking about the use of satire to help keep governments honest. 

As part of the Honest Government ad series TJM has published three ads which are mock tourism ads highlighting the history and ongoing effects of [[Colonialism|colonial rule]] in certain countries. These have been produced for [[Australia]], [[Hawaii]] and [[Puerto Rico]].

[[File:3pillars originofpoliticalorder.gif|thumb|The three components/pillars of a stable state according to Fukuyama]]
'''''The Origins of Political Order''''' is a 2011 book by [[Political economy|political economist]] [[Francis Fukuyama]] about what makes a state stable. It uses a comparative [[political history]] to develop a theory of the stability of a [[political system]]. According to Fukuyama, a stable state needs to be modern and strong, to obey the rule of law governing the state and be accountable.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=312,420}}

{{toclimit|2}}

==Series of books==
The book is the first of two books on the development of [[Political system|political order]]. This book goes from its origins to the [[French Revolution]]. The next book ''[[Political Order and Political Decay: From the Industrial Revolution to the Present Day]]'', published in September 2014, starts with the French Revolution and carries the analysis to the present day.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=furedi/&gt;&lt;ref name=hutton/&gt;&lt;ref name=hewson&gt;{{cite web|title=''Review'' review|url=http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/1261 |work=Reviews in History|accessdate=March 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=degroot&gt;{{cite web|title= Francis Fukuyama's "The Origins of Political Order" |url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2011-04-08/entertainment/35231561_1_central-authority-francis-fukuyama-democracy |work=Washington Post|accessdate=20 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Francis Fukuyama, ''[[Political Order and Political Decay: From the Industrial Revolution to the Globalization of Democracy]]''. Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Why states and institutions fail==
The book is an attempt to understand why modern statebuilding and the building of institutions in countries like Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, Haiti, Timor-Leste, Sierra Leone and Liberia have failed to live up to expectations.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|loc=Preface}}

In the aftermath of its 2003 invasion of Iraq, the US administration seemed genuinely surprised when the Iraqi state itself collapsed in an orgy of looting and civil conflict.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=13}}

The book is about "getting to Denmark," in other words creating stable, peaceful, prosperous, inclusive, and honest societies.&lt;ref name=morris&gt;{{cite web|title=''How To Get to the End of History or "getting to Denmark"'' review|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/books/2011/05/how_to_get_to_the_end_of_history.html |work=Slate|accessdate=March 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fukuyama points out that at the time of writing ninety contemporary 'primitive' societies had been engaged in war,{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=73}} suggesting that political order is preferable to primitive social structures if stability is to be achieved. The author describes how attempts at shaping countries outside the western world into western type democracies failed, and that this book was an attempt to find out why, by trying to find the true origins of political order, by tracing the histories of China, India, Europe and some Muslim countries from the point of view of three components.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=312}}

==Aims==
Since the aim of the book is to understand how institutions and states develop in different countries, it is also a book on [[comparative historical research]].

It is an extension of [[Samuel P. Huntington]]'s ''[[Political Order in Changing Societies]]'' and similar in scope to [[Jared Diamond]]’s ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]''.&lt;ref name=sailer&gt;{{cite web|title= Fukuyama's World  |url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/fukuyamas-world/ |work=The American Conservative|accessdate=20 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fukuyama develops his argument with respect to the history of China, India and the Middle East before focusing on the way European countries developed in a variety of directions.&lt;ref name=blackburn&gt;{{cite web|last=Blackburn|first=Robert|title=''The Origins of Political Order'' review|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-origins-of-political-order-from-prehuman-times-to-the-french-revolution-by-francis-fukuyama-2283020.html |work=The Independent|accessdate=March 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==From pre-human origins to states==

===From chimpanzee hunting groups to tribes===
In his quest for the origins of political order, he first looks at the social order among chimpanzees, notes that the war-like hunting group, rather than the family, was the primary social group, and claims the same for humans. Humans went further: to survive they formed tribes, whose armies were superior to hunting groups by their sheer size.&lt;ref name= hewson &gt;{{cite web|title=''Review'' review|url=http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/1261 |work=Reviews in History|accessdate=March 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=degroot&gt;{{cite web|title= Francis Fukuyama's "The Origins of Political Order" |url=

He uses recent work in sociobiology and other sources to show that sociability built on kin selection and reciprocal altruism is the original default social state of man and not any isolated, presocial human as suggested by [[Hobbes]] and [[Rousseau]].&lt;ref name=lind&gt;{{cite web|last=Lind|first=Michael|title=''Francis Fukuyama's Theory of the State'' review|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/17/books/review/book-review-the-origins-of-political-order-by-francis-fukuyama.html?pagewanted=all |work=New York Times|accessdate=March 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=439}} He suggests that Hobbes and Locke present a fallacy when they argue humans developed cooperative ability only as a result of the invention of the state. This is because chimps, the genetic ancestors to humans, engage in kin relations based on cooperation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=De Waal|first1=Frans|title=Chimpanzee Politics|date=2007|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-8656-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so Hobbes and Locke must be suggesting humans were once sociable, lost this instinct and then regained it due to the state.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=34}}

===Challenge of tribes on the road towards the state===
The next step was to escape beyond tribalism and the "tyranny of cousins", to join tribes into larger coalitions&lt;ref name=blackburn/&gt; towards states, again due to the advantage of larger armies. This was done with the aid of religion.&lt;ref name=burl/&gt; This was because as groups grew in size, maintaining cooperation became more difficult as face-to-face interactions with much of society became difficult. Religion offered a way of providing a combining social force to hold society together .{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=37}} For example, Fukuyama cites [[Mohammed]] as an example of what Weber labels a "[[charismatic leader]]" because he used the idea of an '[[umma]]' (community of believers) to bind together the territory that he ruled over .{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=87}} This challenge to transcend tribalism partly remains today in many parts of the world that is outside Western civilization, for example in Afghanistan and in Somalia.&lt;ref name=burl/&gt;

====Restrictions on marriage and inheritance as a strategy against corruption====
Loyalty to the tribe or the family, rather than to the state, leads to corruption and weakening of the state. Various strategies were used to overcome the corruption. One such strategy was restrictions against marriage among the ruling official class to make sure that loyalties would not lie with family or tribe.&lt;ref&gt;Fukuyama 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Mandarins or [[Scholar-official]]s, who were the ruling class of China, were not allowed to pass on the lands given to them by the emperor to their own children and were restricted as to whom they were allowed to marry.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=116,367}}

[[Mamluk]] slaves, the ruling class of Egypt and the Ottoman Empire, were told which slaves to marry while their children could not inherit from them.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=198}}[[Jannissary|Jannisarries]] were originally forced into celibacy or and prohibited from having a family.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=219}}{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=225}}

[[Pope Gregory VII]] forced Catholic priests in Europe to become celibate and they were prohibited from having a family for the same reason.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=264}}

Spanish administrators in South America were restricted from to marrying local women and from establishing family ties in the territories they were sent to.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=367}}

==Three components of political order==
The books develops the idea of the development of the three components of a modern political order, which are,{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=312,420}}
# '''[[State (polity)#The modern state|State building]]'''
# '''[[Rule of law]]'''
# '''Accountable government'''

[[China]], [[India]], the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]] and Europe each developed these three components of political organization in different order, in different ways and to different degrees. Denmark and the United Kingdom arrived first at a modern balance of the three components in a single package, follow by others by the nineteenth century, as the Netherlands and Sweden.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=421}}

[[File:Fukuyama article2.png|thumb|Origins of Political Order depend on three components, according to Fukuyama. States with all three components, are more stable, and are shown in the middle.]]

===China===
China is described as having the first modern state,&lt;ref name=econom1&gt;{{cite web|title=''The good, the great and the gelded'' review|url=http://www.economist.com/node/18483257 |work=The Economist|accessdate=March 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the definition given, since it established an educated Mandarin bureaucracy, although Hewson objects to this conclusion since the Mandarin bureaucracy was not modern.&lt;ref name=hewson/&gt; China used extreme violence on its population (especially during the influence of [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|legalism]]{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=120}}), but had a weak rule of law and the emperor had no accountability to anyone.&lt;ref name=morris/&gt;

===India===
India is contrasted with China. India could not use extreme force on its population due to the traditional power of the [[brahmin]] [[priestly caste]], who protested violence against the populace and war against neighboring states, by refusing to perform ancestral rituals for the [[Raja]] leaders. The power of the Brahmins weakening the state's power over its people, and effectively forced a strong accountability on its leaders to the population of India via its priestly class.&lt;ref name=morris/&gt;{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=158-167}} An example Fukuyama gives of the influence religion had on early Indian rulers is [[Ashoka]] (304–232 BCE) of the [[Maurya Dynasty]], who under the influence of Buddhism (rather than Brahmanism) came to regret his conquests in the Kalinga War. He vowed to end his empire, and eventually the entire political system collapsed.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=182}}

===Muslim states===
Certain Muslim states developed the practice of making imported slaves as the ruling class, as with the [[Mamluk]]s of Egypt and the Janissaries of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] empire, a process which started around the 8th century. Since these ruling class slaves were neither beholden to family nor to any tribe, but dependent only on the state, it ensured their loyalty towards the state.&lt;ref name=blackburn/&gt;{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=218-219}} A later example would be the 16th-century Ottoman Empire practice of seeking out intelligent Christian children for high civil service or military positions, who were cut off from their family for their training.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=190}}

===Europe===
In 11th-century Europe, instead of the state having the upper hand as in China, or the Brahmins having the upper hand as in India, there was a power conflict between state and church, the [[Investiture Controversy]] between [[Pope Gregory VII]] and [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor]].{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|pp=266}}

The papal party started to search for sources of law to strengthen its case for the universal jurisdiction of the church. They rediscovered the Justinian Code, the [[Corpus Iuris Civilis]], in a library near Bologna in northern Italy in 1072, leading later to the student body called a "universitas", first in Bologna, and soon after in Paris, Oxford, Heidelberg, Cracow, and Copenhagen studying the code and displacing particularistic Salic law.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|pp=268-269}} The laws gave the Gregory the authority to [[excommunicate]] Henry IV, who was forced to [[walk to Canossa]] from Germany to Italy, stand barefoot{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|pp=168}} in the snow for three days{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|pp=265}} outside Canossa and to ask forgiveness from the pope on his knees.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=268}} The [[Concordat of Worms]] ended the struggle between popes and emperors in 1122. It created balance between royal power and religious tradition not seen anywhere else before.&lt;ref name=morris/&gt;

Catholic leaders became accountable to the clergy and to the pope, who historically frequently objected to violence and wars, just as their counterparts in India had done, but in Europe the clergy did not weaken the states as much as Brahmins had done in India. The papal intercessions against wars between Catholic countries also led to the survival of small states in Europe, similar to India, but in contrast to what had happened in China. The existence of small states who were restricted by the church from recruiting mass armies waging wars costly in casualties, as had been the case in China, combined with the existence of independent university scholars, led to military innovations on land and sea to empower fewer soldiers to wield wars effectively and later gave these relatively small countries a military advantage large enough to conquer colonies in the rest of the world. Western Europe began getting the best of both worlds. In England, the rise of common law also strengthened the rule of law. With the reformation, the Lutheran priest N.F.S. Grundtvig in Denmark advocated general literacy since they believed that every Christian should read the bible and established schools throughout the country, leading to voting rights 1849.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|pp=266&amp;ndash;434}} In Denmark this led to the state gradually being more accountable to the general population, since they could now vote and read. In England and Denmark a balance was finally struck between the three components of political order.&lt;ref name=morris/&gt;{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|pp=266&amp;ndash;269}}

==Balance between the components==
A successful modern liberal democracy balances all three components to achieve stability.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=6,188}}

In China a strong modern state came to power first and the state subjugated any potential agents that might have demanded the other two components. In China, the priestly class did not develop into an organized independent religion, as the priests were in the service of the Emperor. Numerous times, therefore, imperial dynasties collapsed.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=151}}&lt;ref name=morris/&gt;

In India, the Brahmins became organised into a strong upper caste of India and the warrior/state caste was held to account by a rule of law as interpreted by the Brahmins. Because of the state was weakened by this limitation, attempts at unifying India under one rule did not last very long.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=183}}&lt;ref name=morris/&gt;

In Europe, there was a long period when the emperors and popes were in conflict, creating a balance of power between them,&lt;ref name=morris/&gt; and ultimately leading to a situation where some small states developed a stable balance between the three components in the United Kingdom, Denmark and Sweden.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=421}}&lt;ref name=morris/&gt;

A '''triskelion''' or '''triskele''' is a [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]] consisting of a '''triple spiral''' exhibiting   [[rotational symmetry]].
The spiral design can be based on interlocking [[Archimedean spiral]]s,  or represent three bent human legs.

Both terms are from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{Lang|el|"τρισκέλιον"}} (''triskelion'') or {{lang|grc|"τρισκελής"}} (''triskeles''), "three-legged",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dtriskelh%2Fs τρισκελής],
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on [[Perseus Digital Library]]&lt;/ref&gt; from prefix "τρι-" (''tri-''), "three times"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0058%3Aentry%3Dtri- τρι-], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; + "σκέλος" (''skelos''), "leg".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dske%2Flos σκέλος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek–English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt;

A triskelion is a traditional symbol of [[Sicily]], where it is called ''trinacria'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Angelo &amp; Mario Grifasi |url=http://www.grifasi-sicilia.com/trinacria.htm |title=Sicilia: Il Perchè del nome Trinacria |publisher=Grifasi-sicilia.com |date=1999-01-28 |accessdate=2010-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Isle of Man]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.im/isleofman/facts.xml#flag |title=Isle of Man Government |accessdate=2012-04-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070510212828/http://www.gov.im/isleofman/facts.xml#flag |archivedate=2007-05-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; where it is known in Manx as ''Tree Cassyn Vannin'', and [[Brittany]] where it is known as ''Triskèle''. [[Ingushetia]] also has a (stylised) triskelion in its flag.

The triskelion symbol appears in many early cultures, the first in [[Malta]] (4400–3600 BCE) and in the astronomical calendar at the famous megalithic tomb of [[Newgrange]] in Ireland built around 3200 BCE,&lt;ref name="knowth.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://knowth.com/newgrange.htm |title=Newgrange Ireland - Megalithic Passage Tomb - World Heritage Site |publisher=Knowth.com |date=2007-12-21 |accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] vessels, on coinage in [[Lycia]], and on [[stater]]s of [[Pamphylia]] (at [[Aspendos]], 370–333 BCE) and [[Pisidia]]. It appears as a [[heraldic]] emblem on warriors' shields depicted on Greek pottery.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the trislele on [[Achilles]]' round shield on an Attic late 6th century BCE ''[[hydria]]'' at the [[Boston Museum of Fine Arts]], illustrated in John Boardman, Jasper Griffin and Oswyn Murray, ''Greece and the Hellenistic World'' (Oxford History of the Classical World) vol. I (1988), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

The triskelion is an ancient symbol of [[Sicily]], with the head of the [[Gorgon]], with snakes as hair, from which radiate three legs bent at the knee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.weddinginsicily.co.uk/wedding_sicily_trinacria.htm|title=Weddings in Sicily Taormina|website=www.weddinginsicily.co.uk|access-date=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The symbol dates back to when Sicily was part of [[Magna Graecia]], the colonial extension of [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] beyond the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]].&lt;ref name="naples"&gt;Matthews, Jeff (2005) [http://faculty.ed.umuc.edu/~jmatthew/naples/symbols.htm Symbols of Naples] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030202145/http://faculty.ed.umuc.edu/~jmatthew/naples/symbols.htm |date=2009-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pliny the Elder]] attributes the origin of the triskelion of Sicily to the [[triangle|triangular]] form of the island, the ancient ''[[Kingdom of Sicily|Trinacria]]'' (from the Greek ''tri-'' (three) and ἄκρα ''akra'' (end, peak, citadel), which consists of three large capes equidistant{{fact|date=July 2018}} from each other, pointing in their respective directions, the names of which were [[Punta del Faro|Pelorus]], [[Capo Passero|Pachynus]], and [[Marsala|Lilybæum]].{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

The [[Celtic art|Celtic]] symbol of [[triple spiral|three conjoined spirals]] may have had triple significance similar to the imagery that lies behind the triskelion. The triple spiral motif is a [[Neolithic]] symbol in Western Europe. Though popularly considered a "Celtic" symbol, it is in fact a pre-Celtic symbol.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Murphy and Richard Moore, ''Island of the Setting Sun: In Search of Ireland's Ancient Astronomers,'' 2nd ed., Dublin: The Liffey Press, 2008, pp. 168–169&lt;/ref&gt; It is carved into the rock of a stone lozenge near the main entrance of the prehistoric [[Newgrange]] monument in [[County Meath]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. Newgrange, which was built around 3200 BCE,&lt;ref name="knowth.com"/&gt; predates the Celtic arrival in Ireland, but has long since been incorporated into Celtic culture. The symbol is also found [[petroglyph|carved in rock]] in [[Castro Culture]] settlement in modern-day [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and [[Northern Portugal]]. In Ireland before the 5th century, in [[Celtic Christianity]] the triskele took on new meaning, as a symbol of the [[Trinity]] (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit), and therefore also a symbol of eternity. Its popularity continues today as a decorative symbol of faith for Christians of Celtic descent around the world.

==Asian usage==
Traditional Asian versions of the triskelion include the Japanese [[Mitsudomoe]], the Tibetan Buddhist [[Gankyil]], and the Korean [[Taegeuk#Tricolored Taegeuk|Sam Taegeuk]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}
{{clear-left}}

==Modern usage==
A triskelion is featured on the seal of the [[United States Department of Transportation]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

A triskelion shape is the basis for the [[roundel]] of the [[Irish Air Corps]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Aircraft Encyclopedia'' by Roy Braybrook, {{ISBN|0-671-55337-2}}, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; and the logo for the [[Trisquel]] [[Linux distribution]].

A triskelion shape was used in the design of RCA's "Spider" [[45 rpm adapter]], a popular plastic adapter for vinyl records, which allows larger center-holed 45 rpm records (commonly used on 7" singles and EPs) to spin on players designed for smaller center-holed 33-1/3 rpm records (the standard for 10" and 12" LPs). The design was practical, the three curved arms providing equal spring and thus keeping the hole centred. The iconic design of the Spider has led to its adoption as a popular symbol for record and music enthusiasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.welove-music.com/blog/index.php/technology/45-rpm-adapters/ |title=We Love Life: Music - 45 RPM Adapters |publisher=Welove-music.com |date=2009-11-26 |accessdate=2013-08-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091202110840/http://www.welove-music.com/blog/index.php/technology/45-rpm-adapters/ |archivedate=2009-12-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gadgets.boingboing.net/2008/12/05/twenty-45-adapters.html |title=Boing Boing: Gadgets - Twenty 45 adapters |publisher=Gadgets.boingboing.net|date=2008-12-05 |accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most commonly used symbols of the [[BDSM#Symbols|BDSM]] community is a derivation of a triskelion shape within a circle.&lt;ref name=Luminais&gt;{{cite book|last1=Luminais|first1=Misty|title=In the Habit of Being Kinky: Practice and Resistance in a BDSM Community, Texas, USA|date=May 2012|publisher=Washington State University|page=121|url=https://research.wsulibs.wsu.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/2376/4093/Luminais_wsu_0251E_10404.pdf?sequence=1|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[South Africa|South African]] [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] [[White supremacy|White supremacist]] [[White nationalism|White nationalist]] organization and political party [[Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging]] uses a Triskele composed of three sevens as its symbol in place of the [[Swastika|Nazi Swastika]].

The [[Flag of the Isle of Man]] bears 3 legs based on the Triskele.

The crest of the Breton [[association football|football]] club [[En Avant de Guingamp]] combines the [[Flag of Brittany]], the team colours and the triple spiral triskelion.

"[[The Gamesters of Triskelion]]" is a second-season episode of the American science fiction television series ''[[Star Trek]]''.

In the [[Marvel Universe]], the intelligence agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] uses the [[Triskelion (comics)|Triskelion]] as its headquarters {{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}.

The Triskele is also used as a prominent symbol in MTV's "[[Teen Wolf (2011 TV Series)]]" which draws heavily from Celtic mythology. A Triskele was used by some younger betas to keep from shifting &amp; maintain calm. This happens by the beta repeating "Alpha, Beta, Omega" or "The Sun, The Moon, The Truth" over and over again until the beta is calm.

In [[Merlin (2008 TV series)]] it was used as symbol of druids.

==Reconstructionists and neopagans==
The triskele, usually consisting of spirals, but also the "horned triskelion", is used by some [[Polytheistic reconstructionism|polytheistic reconstructionist]] and [[Neopaganism|neopagan]] groups. As a Celtic symbol, it is used primarily by groups with a Celtic cultural orientation and, less frequently, can also be found in use by various eclectic or syncretic traditions such as [[Neopaganism]]. The spiral triskele is one of the primary symbols of [[Celtic Reconstructionist Paganism]].&lt;ref name="Bonewits"&gt;Bonewits, Isaac (2006) ''Bonewits's Essential Guide to Druidism''. New York, [[Kensington Books|Kensington]] Publishing Group {{ISBN|0-8065-2710-2}}. p. 132: [Among Celtic Reconstructionists] "...''An Thríbhís Mhòr'' (the great triple spiral) came into common use to refer to the three realms." Also p. 134: [On CRs] "Using Celtic symbols such as triskeles and [[triple spiral|spirals]]"&lt;/ref&gt; Celtic Reconstructionists use the symbol to represent a variety of triplicities in their cosmology and theology; it is also a favored symbol due to its association with the god [[Manannán mac Lir]].&lt;ref name="Bonewits"/&gt;

==Occurrence in nature==
The endocytic protein, [[clathrin]], is triskelion-shaped.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/potm/2007_4/Page1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
The Ediacaran fossil [[Tribrachidium]] is also triskelion shaped.

The '''Vienna Institute of Demography (VID)''' (until 2002: Institut für Demographie/IfD) is a research institute of the division for humanities and social sciences within the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]] (ÖAW)&lt;ref&gt;[http://wissenschaft.bmwfw.gv.at/fileadmin/user_upload/forschung/OEAW-Forschungsinstitute_Feb._2015.pdf List of Academy institutes published by the Austrian Federal Ministry of Science, Research and Economy]&lt;/ref&gt; and part of the three "''pillar institutions''" of the [[Wittgenstein Centre for Demography and Global Human Capital]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://derstandard.at/1295571237693/Ehrgeizig-Wiener-Wittgenstein-Center-will-an-Spitze-der-Demographie-Institute ''Der Standard'', 31. January 2011: "Vienna Wittgenstein Centre aims for top position among demography institutes worldwide" (in German)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

After some groundwork by researchers interested in having a population studies institute in Austria, among them [[Wilhelm Winkler]] and Gustav Feichtinger, the ''Institut für Demographie'' was established in November 1975 as a non-university research institute of the Austrian Academy of Sciences in close cooperation with the Austrian Statistical Central Office (now [[Statistik Austria]]). Founding director was Lothar Bosse (1914–1996), a German-born philosopher, mathematician and economist who remained at the head of IfD for twelve years. In the first few years, research activities were limited by budget restrictions and focussed on ''theory and basic research'' as well as ''applied demography''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/29734814 ''European Demographic Information Bulletin'' (December 1979), Volume 10, Issue 4, pp. 163–164]&lt;/ref&gt; From the beginning, there was an emphasis on informing the public about population issues and research results, by publications such as "''Demographische Informationen''" (since 1981, in German with English abstracts).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaea.org/inis/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/16/035/16035469.pdf Activity Report of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, chapter on IfD on p.222ff. (published in the IAEA archive)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bosse was succeeded by [[Richard Gisser]] who headed the institute 1987–1989 and again 1993–2001 (interim directorship was taken by social scientist Rainer Münz) and continues to be the institute’s deputy director and a leader of the research group on ''Demography of Austria''.

In the period of 1985 to 2000, the institute and the research topic of demography received increasing attention, though there was some competition for scientific staff with the newly founded [[Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research]] in Rostock, Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/23026758 "Twenty Years Institute of Demography: Activities 1987–1996", in: ''Demographische Informationen'' (1995/96), pp. 5-8 (JSTOR quotation)]&lt;/ref&gt;

After positive independent evaluations and the commitment of special funds, the ÖAW decided to substantially expand and internationalise the institute in 2001. Under the designated new director [[Wolfgang Lutz]], the IfD changed its name and working language, employed more scientific and administrative staff, expanded its research agenda as well as its publication efforts and moved to new and successively larger premises in the 4th district (2002–2007 at Prinz-Eugen-Strasse 8-10, then 2007–2015 at Wohllebengasse 12-14).

Research activity at VID continued to expand and received favourable attention by policy-makers and scientific peers, which showed in VID members participating in or coordinating major research projects, for instance within the European Union’s [[Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development|Framework Programmes]], and obtaining recognition by being awarded sizeable grants from the [[European Research Council]] (ERC). Director Wolfgang Lutz received the [[Wittgenstein Award]] in 2010 and, with the 1.5 million euro prize money, established the ''Wittgenstein Centre for Demography and Global Human Capital''.

At its 40th anniversary in 2015, VID moved to the [[Vienna University of Economics and Business|WU]] campus in Vienna’s 2nd district,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wu.ac.at/en/press/press-releases/press-releases-details/detail/wu-welcomes-the-austrian-academy-of-sciences-to-its-new-department-building-5/|title=WU welcomes the Austrian Academy of Sciences to its new Department Building 5|work=WU (Vienna University of Economics and Business)|access-date=2018-01-24|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; celebrating this and other occasions with a symposium on "Demography that Matters".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tt.com/home/10463868-91/multiple-jubil%C3%A4en-f%C3%BCr-wiener-demographie.csp ''Tiroler Tageszeitung'' of 4 September 2015: "Multiple anniversaries for Vienna’s Demography"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dstatg.de/en/home/aktuelle-news/article/40-years-vienna-institute-of-demography-symposium-demography-that-matters/ Announcement by the German Statistical Society (DStatG)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 Alexia Fürnkranz-Prskawetz, head of the Institute of Mathematical Methods in Economics at the [[Vienna University of Technology]] and long-time leader of the VID research group on ''Population Economics'' became executive director.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oeaw.ac.at/vid/people/staff/#c11970 Academy entry about VID, giving the current directorships]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="40years"&gt;[http://www.oeaw.ac.at/fileadmin/NEWS/2015/PDF/VID_40years.pdf Details on the VID history taken from the anniversary brochure ''40 years of the Vienna Institute of Demography 1975–2015'', Vienna, 2015, Wittgenstein Centre, VID, ÖAW]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research activities ==

VID employs about 40 researchers, most of them from the fields of [[economics]], [[mathematics]]/[[statistics]], [[geography]], health studies and [[sociology]], to cover the major research topics of [[demography]] or population science: [[fertility]], [[mortality rate|mortality]] and [[human migration|migration]] as well as a number of other fields of interest. Over time, the institute’s research focus has expanded from its core competences in Austrian and later European demography to a global perspective on the relevant issues of population and human capital development.&lt;ref name="40years" /&gt;

There are seven main areas of research, assigned to different research groups though there is considerable permeability and cooperation:

* Demography of Austria (led by Richard Gisser and Isabella Buber-Ennser)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ggp-austria.at/fileadmin/ggp-austria/Publikationen/ggp_brochure_austria_2013_english.pdf ''Families in Austria'', results of the Generations and Gender Survey 2009–2013]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Comparative European Demography (Tomáš Sobotka)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A demographic explanation for the recent rise in European fertility. |journal=[[Population and Development Review]] |volume=38 | issue = 1  |pages=83–120 |year=2012 |doi=10.1111/j.1728-4457.2012.00473.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1728-4457.2012.00473.x/abstract |author=Bongaarts, John |last2=Sobotka |first2=Tomáš}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Population Economics (Michael Kuhn and Gustav Feichtinger)
* Health and Longevity (Marc Luy)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cloisterstudy.eu ''The Cloister Study'', a longitudinal study on longevity among monks and nuns]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Migration and Education (Jesús Crespo Cuaresma)
* Human Capital Data Lab (Anne Goujon)

== Publications ==

In addition to the individual contributions of VID researchers to a number of scientific journals,&lt;ref&gt;e.g., {{cite journal|title=Universal education is key to enhanced climate adaptation.|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=346 |issue=6213 |pages=1061–1062 |year=2014  |doi=10.1126/science.1257975  |url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/346/6213/1061|author=Lutz, W.|last2=Muttarak|first2=R.| last3=Striessnig|first3=W. |pmid=25430758}}, {{cite journal|title=Average remaining lifetimes can increase as human populations age. |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=435 |pages=811–813 |year=2005 |doi=10.1038/nature03593 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v435/n7043/abs/nature03593.html |author=Sanderson, W.C. |last2=Scherbov |first2=S. |pmid=15944703}}&lt;/ref&gt; the institute issues the following regular publications:

* ''Vienna Yearbook of Population Research'' (VYPR)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/journal/vienyearpopurese JSTOR entry for VYPR]&lt;/ref&gt;—since 2003, the "Yearbook" features peer-reviewed research articles (in English) addressing population trends as well as a broad range of theoretical and methodological issues in population research, usually taking the form of the [[proceedings]] of last year’s VID/Wittgenstein conference, which is always dedicated to a particular demographic topic. Besides that, the VYPR also publishes Demographic Debates with invited contributions on topics related to the ongoing scientific arguments in the field. Finally, contributions on Data &amp; Trends map long-term developments as well as recent trends in various components of population change in Austria and in Europe.
* ''Demografische Forschung aus erster Hand''—a newsletter in German language (in cooperation with the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research), for information of journalists and policymakers in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, approx. four times a year&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.demogr.mpg.de/en/news_press/press_releases_1916/research_strengthens_public_dialogue_the_max_planck_institute_for_demographic_research_rostock_and_1059.htm Press release by MPDR, 26 March 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''VID Working Papers''—occasional articles in English, mostly by VID researchers
* ''Forschungsberichte'' (Research Reports)—occasional articles, mostly in German and also usually by VID researchers
* ''European Demographic Data Sheet''—every other year, VID presents the relevant data on a selected topic (such as ageing, migration, fertility etc.) on an A1-size poster with maps and figures&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/research/researchPrograms/WorldPopulation/News/160831-EDS.html|title=European Demographic Data Sheet 2016 - News 2016 - IIASA|website=www.iiasa.ac.at|access-date=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Workplace listening''' is a type of [[active listening]] that is generally employed in a professional environment. Listening skills are imperative for career success, [[organizational effectiveness]], and worker satisfaction. Workplace listening includes understanding the listening process (i.e. perception, interpretation, evaluation, and action) and its barriers that hamper the flow of that process. Like other skills, there are specific techniques for improving workplace listening effectiveness. Moreover, it is imperative to become aware of the role of [[nonverbal communication]] in communicating in the workplace, as understanding messages wholly entails more than simple verbal messages.
