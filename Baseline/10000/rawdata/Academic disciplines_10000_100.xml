      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2534">'''Anthropology of food''' is a sub-discipline of [[anthropology]] that connects an [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] and historical perspective with contemporary social issues in food production and consumption systems. 

Although early anthropological accounts often dealt with cooking and eating as part of ritual or daily life, food was rarely regarded as the central point of academic focus. This changed in the later half of the 20th century, when foundational work by [[Mary Douglas]], [[Marvin Harris]], [[Arjun Appadurai]], [[Jack Goody]], and [[Sidney Mintz]] cemented the study of food as a key insight into modern social life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Handbook of Food and Anthropology|last=Klein and Watson|first=|publisher=]Bloomsbury Academic|year=2016|isbn=9780857855947|location=|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mintz is known as the "Father of food anthropology"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/30/us/sidney-mintz-father-of-food-anthropology-dies-at-93.html|title=Sidney Mintz, Father of Food Anthropology, dies at 93|last=Roberts|first=Sam|date=|work=The New York Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for his work ''Sweetness and Power (1985),''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sweetness and Power: The Place of Sugar in Modern History|last=Mintz|first=Sidney|publisher=|year=1985|isbn=0140092331|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which linked British demand for sugar with the creation of empire and exploitative industrial labor conditions. 

Research has traced the material and symbolic importance of food, as well as how they intersect&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Handbook of Food History|last=Pilcher|first=Jeremy|publisher=|year=2012|isbn=9780199729937|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Several related and interdisciplinary academic programs exist in the US and UK&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.food-culture.org/food-studies-programs/|title=Food Studies Programs|last=|first=|date=|website=food-culture.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (listed under [[Food studies]] institutions).

'''Applied behavior analysis''' ('''ABA''') is a scientific discipline concerned with applying techniques based upon the principles of learning to change behavior of social significance.&lt;ref name=JABA3&gt;{{cite journal|author=Baer, D.M.|author2=Wolf, M.M.|author3=Risley, T.R.|lastauthoramp=y|title=Some current dimensions of applied behavior analysis|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|date=1968|volume=1|pages=91–97|pmid=16795165|pmc=1310980|issue=1|doi=10.1901/jaba.1968.1-91}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="applied_behavioral_strategies"&gt;See also footnote number "(1)" of [and the whole "What is ABA?" section of] «{{cite web

The name "applied behavior analysis" has replaced [[behavior modification]] because the latter approach suggested attempting to change behavior without clarifying the relevant behavior-environment interactions. In contrast, ABA tries to change behavior by first [[Functional analysis (psychology)|assessing the functional relationship between a targeted behavior and the environment]].&lt;ref name=JABA/&gt; Further, the approach often seeks to develop socially acceptable alternatives for aberrant behaviors.&lt;ref name=JABA&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mace, F.C.|title=The significance and future of functional analysis methodologies|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|date=1994|volume=27|pages=385–392|doi=10.1901/jaba.1994.27-385|pmc=1297814|issue=2|pmid=16795830}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JABA2&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Baer, D.M.|author2= Wolf, M.M.|author3= Risley, T.R.|lastauthoramp=y|title=Some still-current dimensions of applied behavior analysis|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|date=1987|volume=20|issue=4|pages=313–327|doi=10.1901/jaba.1987.20-313|pmc=1286071|pmid=16795703}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JEAB&gt;{{cite journal|author1=F.C.

==Definition==
ABA is an applied science devoted to developing procedures which will produce observable changes in behavior.&lt;ref name=JABA3/&gt; It is to be distinguished from the [[experimental analysis of behavior]], which focuses on basic experimental research,&lt;ref name=As-in-ABA&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dillenburger, K. |author2=Keenan, M. |title=None of the As in ABA stand for autism: dispelling the myths |journal=J Intellect Dev Disabil |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=193–95 |year=2009 |pmid=19404840 |doi=10.1080/13668250902845244}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it uses principles developed by such research, in particular [[operant conditioning]] and [[classical conditioning]]. Behavior analysis adopts the viewpoint of [[radical behaviorism]], treating thoughts, emotions, and other covert activity as behavior that is subject to the same rules as overt responses. This represents a shift away from methodological behaviorism, which restricts behavior-change procedures to behaviors that are overt, and was the conceptual underpinning of [[behavior modification]].

Behavior analysts also emphasize that the science of behavior must be a ''natural'' science as opposed to a ''social'' science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marr |first1=M |title=The natural selection: behavior analysis as a natural science |journal=European Journal of Behavior Analysis |date=2009 |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=103–118 |url=http://www.ejoba.org/PDF/2009_2/Marr_2009.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129034739/http://www.ejoba.org/PDF/2009_2/Marr_2009.pdf |archivedate=29 November 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, behavior analysts focus on the observable relationship of behavior with the environment, including [[antecedent (behavioral psychology)|antecedents]] and consequences, without resort to [[Subfields of psychology|"hypothetical constructs"]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Thompson, T. |doi=10.1901/jeab.1984.41-211 |pmc=1348034 |year=1984 |title=The examining magistrate for nature: a retrospective review of Claude Bernard's An Introduction to the Study of Experimental Medicine |journal=Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior |volume=2 |issue=41 |pages=212–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The beginnings of ABA can be traced back to the research of Teodoro Ayllon and [[Jack Michael]] with their study "The psychiatric nurse as a behavioral engineer" (1959) that they submitted to the ''[[Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior]]'' (JEAB) as part of their doctoral dissertation at the [[University of Houston]]. The researchers were training the staff and nurses at a [[psychiatric hospital]] how to use a [[token economy]] based on the principles of [[operant conditioning]] and [[behavioral engineering]]&amp;mdash;a synonym for ABA,&lt;ref name=behavioranalysislearning&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; This paper later led to the founding of the ''[[Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis]]'' (JABA), which publishes research in the application of behavior analysis to a wide array of socially relevant behavior,&lt;ref name=lovaas&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3089401/|vauthors=Larsson EV, Wright S|title=O.

&lt;/ref&gt; such as autism, pediatric feeding therapy, substance-use disorders, and classroom instruction with typically developing students.

A group of faculty and researchers at the [[University of Washington]], including [[Donald M. Baer|Donald Baer]], [[Sidney W. Bijou]], Bill Hopkins, Jay Birnbrauer, Todd Risley, and [[Montrose Wolf]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lovitt|first1=Thomas C.|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|date=1993|volume=26|issue=4|pages=563–567|doi=10.1901/jaba.1993.26-563|pmid=16795814|pmc=1297893|title=A brief history of applied behavior analysis at the University of Washington}}&lt;/ref&gt; applied the principles of behavior analysis to instruct developmentally disabled children, provide behavior management strategies in juvenile detention centers, and [[organizational behavior management|organize employees who required proper structure and management in businesses]], among other situations. In 1968, Baer, Bijou, Risley, Birnbrauer, Wolf, and James Sherman joined the Department of Human Development and Family Life at the [[University of Kansas]], where they founded the ''Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis''.&lt;ref name=HistoryofJABAResearchFaculty&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baer|first1=Donald M.|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|date=1993|volume=26|issue=4|pages=569–570|doi=10.1901/jaba.1993.26-569|pmid=16795815|pmc=1297894|title=A brief, selective history of the Department of Human Development and Family Life at the University of Kansas: The early years}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable graduate students from the University of Washington include Robert Wahler, James Sherman, and [[Ivar Lovaas]].&lt;ref name=lovaas/&gt;&lt;ref name=HistoryofJABAResearchFaculty/&gt; Lovaas established the UCLA Young Autism Project while teaching at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], and devoted nearly half a century to groundbreaking research and practice aimed at improving the lives of children with autism and their families. In 1965, Lovaas published a series of articles that outlined his system for coding observed behaviors, described a pioneering investigation of the antecedents and consequences that maintained a problem behavior,&lt;ref name="Lovaas"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=T|author2=Eikseth|title=S|journal=Journal of Autism &amp; Developmental Disorders|date=14 December 2010|volume=41|issue=3|pages=375–378|doi=10.1007/s10803-010-1162-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and relied upon the methods of [[errorless learning]] that was initially devised by [[Charles Ferster]] to teach nonverbal children to speak. Lovaas also described how to use social (secondary) reinforcers, teach children to imitate, and what interventions (including electric shocks) may be used to reduce aggression and life-threatening self-injury.&lt;ref name="Lovaas"/&gt; 

In 1987, Lovaas published the landmark study, "Behavioral Treatment and Normal Educational and Intellectual Functioning in Young Autistic Children".&lt;ref name=lovaas/&gt; The experimental group in this study received up to 40-hours per week in a 1:1 teaching setting using errorless [[discrete trial training]] (DTT). The treatment is done at home with parents involved in every aspect of treatment, and the curriculum is highly individualized with a heavy emphasis on teaching eye contact and language. ABA principles are used to motivate learning and reduce non-desired behaviors. The outcome of this study indicated 47% of the experimental group (9/19) went on to lose their autism diagnosis and were described as indistinguishable from their typical adolescent peers. This included passing regular education without assistance, making and maintaining friends, and becoming self-sufficient as adults. These gains were maintained as reported in the 1993 study, "Long-Term Outcome for Children With Autism Who Received Early Intensive Behavioral Treatment". Lovaas’ work went on to be recognized by the US Surgeon General in 1999, and his research outcomes were replicated in university and private settings. The "Lovaas Method" went on to become known as early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI), or DTT for 30 to 40 hours per week. 

In addition to being a major contributor of ABA, Lovaas taught now prominent behaviorists, such as [[Robert Koegel]], Laura Schreibman, Tristram Smith, John McEachin, Ron Leaf, [[Doreen Granpeesheh]], Jacquie Wynn, and over 20,000 UCLA students who took his "Behavior Modification" course during his 50 years of teaching. He even cofounded what is today the [[Autism Society of America]] (ASA), published hundreds of research articles and books, received state and national awards, and forced school districts to adopt evidenced based teaching programs. His work influenced how autism was treated, and improved the lives of parents and children stricken with the autism diagnosis worldwide.

Over the years, "behavior analysis" gradually superseded "behavior modification";  that is, from simply trying to alter problematic behavior, behavior analysts sought to understand the function of that behavior, what antecedents promote and maintain it, and how it can be replaced by successful behavior.&lt;ref name=JEAB/&gt; This analysis is based on careful initial assessment of a behavior's function and a testing of methods that produce changes in behavior.

While ABA seems to be intrinsically linked to autism intervention, it is also used for [[applied animal behavior]] and [[clinical behavior analysis]], in [[behavioral medicine]], [[behavioral neuroscience]], and [[criminology]], to [[Organizational behavior management|increase job safety and performance]], [[Systematic desensitization|counteract phobias]], and [[Positive behavior support|improve classroom management]].&lt;ref name=PBSExpansion&gt;{{cite journal|title=Positive behavior support: Expanding the application of applied behavior analysis.|last1=Anderson|first1=CM|last2=Freeman|first2=KA|journal=The Behavior Analyst|volume=23|issue=1|pages=85–94|pmc=2731369|date=Spring 2000|pmid=22478340}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=abapbsschoolviolence&gt;{{cite journal|title=Applying behavior analysis to school violence and discipline problems|last1=Anderson|first1=CM|last2=Kincald|first2=D|journal=The Behavior Analyst|volume=28|issue=1|pages=49–63|pmc=2755344|year=2005|pmid=22478439}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SWPBIS&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=schoolwide+positive+behavioral+interventions+%26+supports|title=The impact of schoolwide positive behavioral interventions and supports on bullying and peer rejection: a randomized controlled effectiveness trial|last1=Waasdorp|first1=TE|last2=Bradshaw|first2=CP|last3=Leaf|first3=PJ|journal=Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine|volume=166|issue=2|pages=149–56|date=Winter 2012|doi=10.1001/archpediatrics.2011.755|pmid=22312173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

Baer, Wolf, and Risley's 1968 article&lt;ref name=BWR/&gt; is still used as the standard description of ABA.&lt;ref name=CooperHeron2007&gt;{{cite book |ref = harvnb |author1=Cooper, J.O. |author2=Heron, T.E. |author3=Heward, W.L. |title=Applied Behavior Analysis |url =http://wps.prenhall.com/chet_cooper_appliedbeh_2 |edition=2nd |year=2007 |publisher=Prentice Hall |isbn=0-13-142113-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cooper|Heron|Heward|1987|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It lists the following the seven characteristics of ABA.
* '''Applied''':  ABA focuses on the social significance of the behavior studied. For example, a non-applied researcher may study eating behavior because this research helps to clarify metabolic processes, whereas the applied researcher may study eating behavior in individuals who eat too little or too much, trying to change such behavior so that it is more acceptable to the persons involved.
* '''Behavioral''':  ABA is pragmatic; it asks how it is possible to get an individual to do something effectively. To answer this question, the behavior itself must be objectively measured. Verbal descriptions are treated as behavior in themselves, and not as substitutes for the behavior described.
* '''Analytic''':  Behavior analysis is successful when the analyst understands and can manipulate the events that control a target behavior. This may be relatively easy to do in the lab, where a researcher is able to arrange the relevant events, but it is not always easy, or ethical, in an applied situation.&lt;ref name=BWR&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Baer, D.M. |author2=Wolf, M.M. |author3=Risley, T.R. |year=1968 |title=Some current dimensions of applied behavior analysis |journal=J Appl Behav Anal |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages= 91–97 |doi=10.1901/jaba.1968.1-91 |pmc=1310980 |pmid=16795165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baer et al. outline two methods that may be used in applied settings to demonstrate control while maintaining ethical standards. These are the reversal design and the multiple baseline design. In the reversal design, the experimenter first measures the behavior of choice, introduces an intervention, and then measures the behavior again. Then, the intervention is removed, or reduced, and the behavior is measured yet again. The intervention is effective to the extent that the behavior changes and then changes back in response to these manipulations.  The multiple baseline method may be used for behaviors that seem irreversible. Here, several behaviors are measured and then the intervention is applied to each in turn. The effectiveness of the intervention is revealed by changes in just the behavior to which the intervention is being applied. 
* '''Technological''':  The description of analytic research must be clear and detailed, so that any competent researcher can repeat it accurately.&lt;ref name=BWR/&gt;  Cooper et al. describe a good way to check this: Have a person trained in applied behavior analysis read the description and then act out the procedure in detail. If the person makes any mistakes or has to ask any questions then the description needs improvement.&lt;ref name=CooperHeron2007/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cooper|Heron|Heward|1987|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Conceptually Systematic''':  Behavior analysis should not simply produce a list of effective interventions.  Rather, to the extent possible, these methods should be grounded in behavioral principles. This is aided by the use of theoretically meaningful terms, such as "secondary reinforcement" or "errorless discrimination" where appropriate.
* '''Effective''':  Though analytic methods should be theoretically grounded, they must be effective. If an intervention does not produce a large enough effect for practical use, then the analysis has failed
* '''General''':  Behavior analysts should aim for interventions that are generally applicable; the methods should work in different environments, apply to more than one specific behavior, and have long-lasting effects.

===Other proposed characteristics===

In 2005, Heward et al. suggested that the following five characteristics should be added:&lt;ref name=Heward&gt;{{cite book |editor=Heward, W.L. |year=2005 |title=Focus on behavior analysis in education: Achievements, challenges, and opportunities |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ |publisher=Prentice Hall/Merrill |isbn=0-13-111339-9|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Accountable''': To be accountable means that ABA must be able to demonstrate that its methods are effective. This requires the repeatedly measuring the success of interventions, and, if necessary, making changes that improve their effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Stokes, Trevor |author2=Budd, Karen S. |title=A small matter of proof: the legacy of Donald M. Baer |publisher=Context Press |location=Reno, NV |year=2003 |isbn=1-878978-43-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Public''': The methods, results, and theoretical analyses of ABA must be published and open to scrutiny. There are no hidden treatments or mystical, metaphysical explanations.
* '''Doable''': To be generally useful, interventions should be available to a variety of individuals, who might be teachers, parents, therapists, or even those who wish to modify their own behavior. With proper planning and training, many interventions can be applied by almost anyone willing to invest the effort.&lt;ref name=Heward1&gt;Heward, 205 p. 322&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Empowering''': ABA provides tools that give the practitioner feedback on the results of interventions. These allow clinicians to assess their skill level and build confidence in their effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cooper|Heron|Heward|1987|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Optimistic''': According to several leading authors, behavior analysts have cause to be optimistic that their efforts are socially worthwhile, for the following reasons:
** The behaviors impacted by behavior analysis are largely determined by learning and controlled by manipulable aspects of the environment.
** Practitioners can improve performance by direct and continuous measurements.
** As a practitioner uses behavioral techniques with positive outcomes, they become more confident of future success.
** The literature provides many examples of success in teaching individuals considered previously unteachable.

==Concepts==

===Behavior===
{{Main article|Behavior}}

Behavior refers to the movement of some part of an organism that changes some aspect of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Johnston |first=James M. |lastauthoramp=y |last2=Pennypacker |first2=H.S. |year=1993a |title=Strategies and tactics of behavioral research |location=Hillsdale, NJ |publisher=Erlbaum Associates |page=23 |isbn=0-8058-0905-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, the term behavior refers to a class of responses that share physical dimensions or functions, and in that case a ''response'' is a single instance of that behavior.&lt;ref name=CooperHeron2007/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cooper|Heron|Heward|1987|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a group of responses have the same function, this group may be called a response class. "Repertoire" refers to the various responses available to an individual; the term may refer to responses that are relevant to a particular situation, or it may refer to everything a person can do.

====Operant conditioning====
{{Main article|Operant conditioning}}

Operant behavior is the so-called "voluntary" behavior that is sensitive to, or controlled by its consequences. Specifically, operant conditioning refers to the [[three-term contingency]] that uses [[stimulus control]], in particular an antecedent contingency called the discriminative stimulus (SD) that influences the strengthening or weakening of behavior through such consequences as [[reinforcement]] or [[punishment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cooper|Heron|Heward|1987|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used quite generally, from reaching for a candy bar, to turning up the heat to escape an aversive chill, to studying for an exam to get good grades.

====Respondent (classical) conditioning====
{{Main article|Classical conditioning}}

Respondent (classical) conditioning is based on innate stimulus-response relationships called reflexes. In his famous experiments with dogs, Pavlov usually used the salivary reflex, namely salivation (unconditioned response) following the taste of food (unconditioned stimulus). Pairing a neutral stimulus, for example a bell (conditioned stimulus) with food caused the bell to elicit salivation (conditioned response). Thus, in classical conditioning, the conditioned stimulus becomes a signal for a biologically significant consequence. Note that in respondent conditioning, unlike operant conditioning, the response does not ''produce'' a reinforcer or punisher (e.g. the dog does not get food ''because'' it salivates).

===Environment===

The environment is the entire constellation of stimuli in which an organism exists.&lt;ref name="Michael, J. 2004"&gt;Michael, J. (2004). ''Concepts and principles of behavior analysis'' (rev. ed.) Kalamazoo, MI: Society for the Advancement of Behavior Analysis.&lt;/ref&gt; This includes events both inside and outside of an organism, but only real physical events are included.  A stimulus is an "energy change that affects an organism through its receptor cells".&lt;ref name="Michael, J. 2004"/&gt;

'''A stimulus can be described''':
* '''Topographically''' by its physical features.
* '''Temporally''' by when it occurs.
* '''Functionally''' by its effect on behavior.

===Reinforcement===
{{Main article|Reinforcement}}

Reinforcement is the key element in operant conditioning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Flora, S.R. |title=The power of reinforcement |publisher=State University of New York Press |location=Albany |year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in most behavior change programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1901/jaba.1993.26-527 |author1=Northup, J. |author2=Vollmer, T.R. |author3=Serret, K. |year=1993 |title=Publication trends in 25 years of the Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis |journal= Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=527–37 |pmid=16795803 |pmc=1297882}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the process by which behavior is strengthened. If a behavior is followed closely in time by a stimulus and this results in an increase in the future frequency of that behavior, then the stimulus is a positive reinforcer. If the removal of an event serves as a reinforcer, this is termed negative reinforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cooper|Heron|Heward|1987|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are multiple [[schedules of reinforcement]] that affect the future probability of behavior.

===Punishment===
{{Main article|Punishment (psychology)}}

Punishment is a process by which a consequence immediately follows a behavior which decreases the future frequency of that behavior. As with reinforcement, a stimulus can be added ([[positive punishment]]) or removed ([[negative punishment]]). Broadly, there are three types of punishment: presentation of aversive stimuli (e.g., pain), response cost (removal of desirable stimuli as in monetary fines), and restriction of freedom (as in a 'time out').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cooper|Heron|Heward|1987|p=355}}&lt;/ref&gt; Punishment in practice can often result in unwanted side effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Reese E.P. |title=The analysis of human operant behavior |publisher=Brown |location=Dubuque IA |year=1966 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some other potential unwanted effects include resentment over being punished, attempts to escape the punishment, expression of pain and negative emotions associated with it, and recognition by the punished individual between the punishment and the person delivering it.

===Extinction===
{{Main article|Extinction (psychology)}}

Extinction is the technical term to describe the procedure of withholding/discontinuing reinforcement of a previously reinforced behavior, resulting in the decrease of that behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Miltenberger, R. G. "Behavioral Modification: Principles and Procedures". [[Thomson/Wadsworth]], 2008. p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; The behavior is then set to be extinguished (Cooper et al.). Extinction procedures are often preferred over punishment procedures, as many punishment procedures are deemed unethical and in many states prohibited. Nonetheless, extinction procedures must be implemented with utmost care by professionals, as they are generally associated with extinction bursts. An extinction burst is the temporary increase in the frequency, intensity, and/or duration of the behavior targeted for extinction.&lt;ref&gt;Miltenberger, R. G. "Behavioral Modification: Principles and Procedures". [[Thomson/Wadsworth]], 2008. p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; Other characteristics of an extinction burst include an extinction-produced aggression—the occurrence of an emotional response to an extinction procedure often manifested as aggression; and b) extinction-induced response variability—the occurrence of novel behaviors that did not typically occur prior to the extinction procedure. These novel behaviors are a core component of [[shaping (psychology)|shaping]] procedures.

===Discriminated operant and three-term contingency===

In addition to a relation being made between behavior and its consequences, operant conditioning also establishes relations between antecedent conditions and behaviors. This differs from the S–R formulations (If-A-then-B), and replaces it with an AB-because-of-C formulation. In other words, the relation between a behavior (B) and its context (A) is because of consequences (C), more specifically, this relationship between AB because of C indicates that the relationship is established by prior consequences that have occurred in similar contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Moxley, R.A. |year=2004 |title=Pragmatic selectionism. The philosophy of behavior analysis |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6884/is_1_5/ai_n28246897/ |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=5 |pages=108–25 |doi=10.1037/h0100137}}&lt;/ref&gt; This antecedent–behavior–consequence contingency is termed the three-term contingency. A behavior which occurs more frequently in the presence of an antecedent condition than in its absence is called a discriminated operant. The antecedent stimulus is called a discriminative stimulus (S&lt;sup&gt;D&lt;/sup&gt;). The fact that the discriminated operant occurs only in the presence of the discriminative stimulus is an illustration of [[stimulus control]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cooper|Heron|Heward|1987|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently behavior analysts have been focusing on conditions that occur prior to the circumstances for the current behavior of concern that increased the likelihood of the behavior occurring or not occurring. These conditions have been referred to variously as "Setting Event", "Establishing Operations", and "Motivating Operations" by various researchers in their publications.

===Verbal behavior===
{{Main article|Verbal Behavior}}

[[B.F. Skinner|B.F. Skinner's]] classification system of behavior analysis has been applied to treatment of a host of communication disorders.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, P. (2007). Promoting generalization and maintenance of skills learned via natural language teaching. ''SPL-ABA'' 1(4)–2(1), 97–138&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner's system includes:
* [[Tact (psychology)]] – a verbal response evoked by a non-verbal antecedent and maintained by generalized conditioned reinforcement.
* [[Mand (psychology)]] – behavior under control of motivating operations maintained by a characteristic reinforcer.
* Intraverbals – verbal behavior for which the relevant antecedent stimulus was other verbal behavior, but which does not share the response topography of that prior verbal stimulus (e.g., responding to another speaker's question).
* [[Autoclitic]] – secondary verbal behavior which alters the effect of primary verbal behavior on the listener. Examples involve quantification, grammar, and qualifying statements (e.g., the differential effects of "I think..." vs. "I know...")

For assessment of verbal behavior from Skinner's system see [[Assessment of Basic Language and Learning Skills]].

==Measuring behavior==

When measuring behavior, there are both dimensions of behavior and quantifiable measures of behavior. In applied behavior analysis, the quantifiable measures are a derivative of the dimensions. These dimensions are repeatability, temporal extent, and temporal locus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Johnston |first=J.M. |lastauthoramp=y |last2=Pennypacker |first2=H.S. |year=1993b |title=Readings for Strategies and tactics of behavioral research |edition=2nd |location=Hillsdale, HF |publisher=Erlbaum |isbn=0-8058-0906-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Repeatability===

Response classes occur repeatedly throughout time—i.e., how many times the behavior occurs.
* '''Count''' is the number of occurrences in behavior.
* '''Rate/frequency''' is the number of instances of behavior per unit of time.
* '''Celeration''' is the measure of how the rate changes over time.

===Temporal extent===

This dimension indicates that each instance of behavior occupies some amount of time—i.e., how long the behavior occurs.
* '''Duration''' is the amount of time in which the behavior occurs.

===Temporal locus===

Each instance of behavior occurs at a specific point in time—i.e., when the behavior occurs.
* '''Response latency''' is the measure of elapsed time between the onset of a stimulus and the initiation of the response.
* '''Interresponse time''' is the amount of time that occurs between two consecutive instances of a response class.

===Derivative measures===

Derivative measures are unrelated to specific dimensions:
* '''Percentage''' is the ratio formed by combining the same dimensional quantities.
* '''Trials-to-criterion''' are the number of response opportunities needed to achieve a predetermined level of performance.

==Analyzing behavior change==

===Experimental control===

In applied behavior analysis, all experiments should include the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cooper|Heron|Heward|1987|p=422}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* At least one participant
* At least one behavior (dependent variable)
* At least one setting
* A system for measuring the behavior and ongoing visual analysis of data
* At least one treatment or intervention condition
* Manipulations of the independent variable so that its effects on the dependent variable may be quantitatively or qualitatively analyzed
* An intervention that will benefit the participant in some way&lt;ref&gt;[[Behavioral Cusp]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functional analysis (psychology)==
{{main article|Functional analysis (psychology)}}

===History of functional analysis===

Prior to the seminal article on functional analytic methodology for aberrant behaviors, behaviorists used the behavioral technology available to them at the time. Instead of treating the function of the disruptive behavior, behavioral psychologists would instead ''pre-assume'' consequences to alter disruptive behaviors. For example, in the past to decrease self-injurious behavior in an individual, behaviorists may have delivered an aversive stimulus contingent on the response, or assume a reinforcer without identifying the reinforcer that would be most motivating to the client (Iwata, 1988). This type of intervention was successful to the individual, but it was not uncommon to see other variations of aberrant behavior begin to appear. When applied behavior analysts let clients choose from a wide array of reinforcers (often determined through data collection and reinforcement assessments) in the mid-1980s, reinforcement was shown to be more effective than punishment contingencies. In general, applied behavior analysis as a field favors reinforcement based interventions over aversive contingencies, but at the time the behavioral technology was not advanced enough and the individuals needing intervention had a right to an effective treatment (Van Houten et al., 1988). Nevertheless, not all behavioral therapies involved the use of aversives prior to the mid-1980s. Some behaviorists (for instance, [[B.F. Skinner]]) always preferred reinforcement and extinction contingencies over punishment even during that time.

In 1977, Edward Carr published a paper on potential hypotheses for the occurrence and maintenance of self-injurious behaviors. This paper laid out the initial groundwork for a functional analysis of aberrant behaviors. In the paper, Carr described five potential causes for self-injurious behaviors that included (1) positive social reinforcement contingent on the response, (2) [[negative reinforcement]] in the form of removal of an aversive stimulus contingent on the response, (3) the response produced stimuli possessed reinforcing qualities (automatic reinforcement), (4) the behavior was a byproduct of an underlying psychological condition, and (5) psychodynamic hypothesis in which the behavior was an attempt to reduce guilt. Throughout the paper, Carr cited recent research to support the first three hypotheses, and disprove the latter two hypotheses, but no formal experiment was conducted to determine the controlling variables of the problem behavior.

In 1982, Iwata and colleagues conducted the first experimental analysis of the maintaining variables for self-injurious behavior. In the paper, the researchers alternated between specific conditions to examine whether or not the behavior occurred under specific environmental conditions. Through direct manipulation of the environment, the researchers could accurately identify the controlling variables of the aberrant behavior, and provide interventions that targeted the functional relationship between the behavior and the environment. Since this seminal article was published, a wide range of research has been published in the area of functional analyses of aberrant behaviors. The methodology has since become the gold standard in assessment and treatment of aberrant behaviors.

===Functional behavior assessment (FBA)===
Functional assessment of behavior provides hypotheses about the relationships between specific environmental events and behaviors. Decades of research have established that both desirable and undesirable behaviors are learned and maintained through interactions with the social and physical environment. Functional behavior assessments are used to identify controlling variables for challenging behaviors as the basis for intervention efforts designed to decrease the occurrence of these behaviors.

===Functions of behavior===

Behavior serves two major functions for an individual: (1) to obtain desired events, or (2) to escape/avoid undesired events. Put another way, individuals engage in behavior to get something or to get out of something.  When trying to identify the function of a behavior, it is often helpful to think, "What purpose is this behavior serving the individual?" Described below are the common functions of behavior.

==== Obtain socially mediated events ====

''Access to attention (positive reinforcement: social)'':
The individual engages in the behavior to obtain attention from another person. For example, a child throws a toy because it characteristically results in mom's attention. (If this behavior results in mom looking at child and giving him lots of attention—even if she's saying "NO"—he will be more likely to engage in the same behavior in the future to get mom's attention.) Common forms of attention include, but are not limited to, hugs, kisses, reprimands, frowns, smiles, etc.

''Access to tangibles (positive reinforcement: tangible/activity)'':
The individual engages in the behavior to obtain a specific item or engage in a specific activity from another person. For example, a child hits mom because s/he wants the toy mom is holding. (If this behavior results in mom giving the child the toy, s/he will be more likely to engage in the same behavior in the future to get mom's attention.) Common forms of tangible items include, but are not limited to, food, toys, movies, video games, etc.

''Automatic positive reinforcement'':
The individual engages in the behavior because the response-produced stimulation possesses reinforcing characteristics. In other words, engaging in the behavior produces reinforcing stimulation unique to the specific context. For example, a child hits his/her eyes because it produces the specific stimulation of various colors and effects. Another example includes a child spinning a bowl on a table to produce the specific auditory stimulation unique to that object. Common forms of automatic stimulation include, but are not limited to, auditory stimulation, visual stimulation, endorphin release, etc.

==== Escape/avoid undesirable events (negative reinforcement) ====

===== Escape/avoid socially mediated events =====

''Escape/removal of attention'':
The individual engages in the behavior to escape aversive socially mediated attention. Put another way, social situations that are aversive to the child are removed contingent on the behavior occurring. For example, a child hits the teacher to avoid talking in front of the class. Common forms of aversive social situations include, but are not limited to, smiles, hugs, frowns, corrections, group settings, etc.

''Escape/removal of tasks or activities'':
The individual engages in the behavior to escape aversive tasks or demands. For example, when a child is told to take a bath he begins to cry, and his mother tells him he no longer has to take a bath. Another example includes a teacher telling a student to complete a set of worksheets, to which the student flips the desk and is sent to the principal's office. Being sent to the principal's office reinforced the behavior of flipping the desk because it allowed the child to escape the aversive activity of completing the worksheets. Common forms of aversive demands/activities include, but are not limited to, difficult tasks, changes in routines, unpredictability, etc.

===== Escape/avoid specific stimulation =====

''Automatic negative reinforcement'':
The individual engages in the behavior because it produces a decrease in aversive stimulation. Put another way, something aversive is occurring in some location on the organism's body, and engaging in the behavior decreases the level of discomfort. For example, a child bangs his head against the wall to decrease the pain experienced from a toothache. Another example includes a child scratching his arm to decrease the level of itchiness experienced from a bug bite. Common forms of aversive stimulation abated by engaging in specific behaviors include sinus pain, itching, hunger, etc.

=== Function versus topography ===

As previously stated function refers to the effect the behavior produces on the environment. The actual form of the behavior is referred to the topography. Different behaviors may serve the same function, thus describing one limitation of treating behaviors based on form alone. For example, a child may scream, hit, and cry to obtain attention from his mother. What the behavior looks like often reveals little useful information about the conditions that account for it. However, identifying the conditions that account for a behavior, suggests what conditions need to be altered to change the behavior. Therefore, assessment of function of a behavior can yield useful information with respect to intervention strategies that are likely to be effective.

=== Method of identifying functions of behavior ===

'''FBA methods can be classified into three types''':
* Indirect assessment
* Descriptive assessment
* Functional (experimental) analysis

==== Indirect FBA ====

This method uses structured interviews, checklists, rating scales, or questionnaires to obtain information from persons who are familiar with the person exhibiting the behavior to identify possible conditions or events in the natural environment that correlate with the problem behavior. They are referred to as "indirect" because they do not involve direct observation of the behavior, but rather they solicit information based on others' recollections of the behavior. This form of assessment typically yields the least reliable information about the function of behavior, but can provide insight as to possible functions of the behavior to be tested in the future, the form of the behaviors (e.g. screaming, hitting, etc.), and environments in which the behavior typically occurs (e.g. school, home, etc.). This type of assessment should be performed as the initial step of any functional behavior assessment to gather relevant information to complete more direct assessments.

==== Descriptive FBA ====

Unlike the indirect methods of FBAs, descriptive functional behavior assessment employs direct observation of behavior. These observations occur in the environment in which the behavior naturally occurs (e.g. school, home, etc.) therefore there is no direct manipulation of the environment.
The most common form of descriptive assessment involves recording the antecedents and consequences that naturally occur when the individual emits the behavior. This is referred to as ABC data collection, in which (A) represents the common antecedent, (B) represents the behavior of interest, and (C) represents the immediate consequences that occur following the behavior. ABC data collection is used to identify the naturally occurring consequences delivered in the environment in which the behavior occurs. ABC data collection can be conducted by a wide array of individuals who have received appropriate training on how to record the data.
Another form of descriptive FBA is called a scatterplot. In this assessment, staff record the time and setting in which the behavior of interest occurs over a series of days. The data are plotted on a visual scale to indicate whether there are any patterns in the behavior (for example, if the behavior occurs more frequently during math instruction than it does during lunchtime). Although this assessment does not indicate the consequences maintaining the behavior, it can be used to identify some of the antecedent conditions that typically precede the behavior of interest.

==== Functional (experimental) analysis ====

A functional analysis is the most direct form of functional behavior assessment, in which specific antecedents and consequences are systematically manipulated to test their separate effects on the behavior of interest. Each manipulation of the antecedent and consequence in a particular situation is referred to a condition. In a functional analysis, conditions are typically alternated between quite rapidly independent of responding to test the different functions of behavior. When data paths are elevated above the control condition (described below) it can be said that there is a functional relation between that condition and the behavior of interest. Complexity, time restraints, and setting restraints, are a few limitations to this particular method. When deciding to use this method, it should be noted that there is a chance of high-risk behavior and the possibility of low-rate behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://autism.outreach.psu.edu/sites/omcphplive.outreach.psu.edu.drpms.autismconference/files/42%20and%2055%20Presentation.pdf | title=Functional Analysis of Problem Behavior: the Basics | date=2010 | author=Brian A.

Below, common examples of experimental conditions are described.
A standard functional analysis normally has four conditions (three test conditions and one control).

===== Attention =====

In this condition, the experimenter gives the individual moderately preferred items and instructs them to go play. After that initial instruction, the experimenter pretends to act busy and ignores all bids for attention from the individual. If the individual engages in the behavior of interest, the experimenter provides the individual with attention (commonly in the form of a reprimand). Behaviors that occur more frequently in this condition can be said to be attention maintained.

===== Escape =====

In this condition, the experimenter instructs the individual that it is time to work. After the initial instruction, the experimenter delivers a series of demands that the individual is typically required to complete (e.g. math problems, cleaning up, etc.). If the individual engages in the behavior of interest, the demand is removed and the child is allowed to take a break. Behaviors that occur more frequently in this condition can be said to be escape maintained.

===== Alone =====
In this condition, the child is left alone with a variety of items to engage with. If the child engages in the behavior of interest, no programmed consequences are delivered. Behaviors that occur more frequently in this condition can be said to be automatically maintained.

===== Control (play) =====

In this condition, the child is allowed to engage with a variety of items during the session. No demands are placed on the child throughout the duration of the session. The experimenter provides attention to the individual throughout the session on any behavior that is not the target behavior. If the target behavior occurs, the experimenter removes attention until the behavior has subsided. This session is meant to act as a control condition, meaning that the environment is enriched for the purpose of the behavior not occurring. Said another way, by meeting environmental needs for all possible functions, the individual is not likely to engage in the behavior of interest. This condition is used as a comparison to the other conditions. Any condition that is elevated to a large degree form the control condition, shows a higher degree experimental control indicating the functional relationship between the specific environmental conditions and the behavior of interest.

===Conducting a functional behavior assessment===

Functional behavior assessments are rarely limited to only one of the methods described above. The most common, and most preferred, method for identifying the function of behavior can be seen as a four-part processes.
# The gathering of information via indirect and descriptive assessment.
# Interpretation of information from indirect and descriptive assessment and formulation of a hypothesis about the purpose of problem behavior.
# Testing of a hypothesis using a functional analysis.
# Developing intervention options based on the function of problem behavior.

===Task analysis===

[[Task analysis]] is a process in which a task is analyzed into its component parts so that those parts can be taught through the use of chaining: [[forward chaining]], [[Backward chaining (applied behavior analysis)|backward chaining]] and total task presentation. Task analysis has been used in organizational behavior management, a behavior analytic approach to changing the behaviors of members of an organization (e.g., factories, offices, or hospitals).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Crowell, C.R. |author2=Anderson, D.C. |author3=Abel, D.M. |author4=Sergio, J.P. |year=1988 |title=Task clarification, performance feedback, and social praise: procedures for improving the customer service of bank tellers |journal=[[J Appl Behav Anal]] |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages= 65–71 |doi=10.1901/jaba.1988.21-65 |pmid=16795713 |pmc=1286094}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Behavioral script]]s often emerge from a task analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1901/jaba.1993.26-89 |author1=MacDuff, G.S. |author2=Krantz, P.J. |author3=McClannahan, L.E. |year=1993 |title=Teaching children with autism to use photographic activity schedules: Maintenance and generalization of complex response chains |journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=89–97 |pmid=8473261 |pmc=1297722}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1901/jaba.1993.26-121 |author1=Krantz, P.J. |author2=McClannahan, L.E. |year=1993 |title=Teaching children with autism to initiate to peers: Effects of a script-fading procedure |journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=121–32 |pmid=8473251 |pmc=1297725}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bergan conducted a task analysis of the behavioral consultation relationship&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bergan, J.R. |year=1977 |title=Behavioral Consultation |publisher=Merrill |isbn=0-675-08488-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Thomas Kratochwill developed a training program based on teaching Bergan's skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kratochwill, T.R. |author2=Van Someren, K.R. |author3=Sheridan, S.M. |year=1989 |title=Training behavioral consultants: a competency-based model to teach interview skills |journal=Professional School Psychology |volume=4 |pages=41–58 |doi=10.1037/h0090570}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar approach was used for the development of microskills training for counselors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ivey, A.E. |author2=Normington, C.J. |author3=Miller, C.D. |author4=Morrill, W.H. |author5=Haase, R.F. |year=1968 |title=Microcounseling and attending behavior: an approach to prepracticum counselor training |journal=[[J Couns Psychol]] |volume=15 |issue=5, pt. 2 |pages=1–12 |doi=10.1037/h0026129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Ivey, A.E. |author2=Ivey, M.B. |year=1998 |title=Intentional Interviewing and Counseling: Facilitating Client Development in a Multicultural Society |edition=4th |publisher=Brooks/Cole |isbn=0-534-35756-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Iwata, B.A. |author2=Wong, S.E. |author3=Riordan, M.M. |author4=Dorsey, M.F. |author5=Lau, M.M. |year=1982 |title=Assessment and training of clinical interviewing skills: Analogue analysis and field replication |journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis |pmid=7118753 |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=191–203 |doi=10.1901/jaba.1982.15-191 |pmc=1308264}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ivey would later call this "behaviorist" phase a very productive one&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=J Couns Dev |year=2001 |volume=79 |issue=1 |pages=105–18 |title=Allen E.

===Chaining===
{{Main article|Chaining}}

The skill to be learned is broken down into small units for easy learning. For example, a person learning to brush teeth independently may start with learning to unscrew the toothpaste cap. Once they have learned this, the next step may be squeezing the tube, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cooper|Heron|Heward|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Weiss, K.M. |year=1978 |title=A comparison of forward and backward procedures for the acquisition of response chains in humans |journal=J Exp Anal Behav |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=255–59 |doi=10.1901/jeab.1978.29-255 |pmid=16812053 |pmc=1332753}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For problem behavior, chains can also be analyzed and the chain can be disrupted to prevent the problem behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Walker, H.M. |year=1995 |title=The Acting-Out Child: Coping With Classroom Disruption |edition=2nd |publisher=Sopris West |isbn=1-57035-047-7}}{{page needed|date=August 2011}}&lt;!-- Please add chapter= or pages= for this citation. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Some behavior therapies, such as [[dialectical behavior therapy]], make extensive use of behavior chain analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Linehan, M.M. |year=1993 |title=Skills Training Manual for Treating Borderline Personality Disorder |publisher=The Guilford Press |isbn=0-89862-034-1}}{{page needed|date=August 2011}}&lt;!-- Please add chapter= or pages= for this citation. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prompting===

A [[Response Prompting Procedures|prompt]] is a cue that is used to encourage a desired response from an individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ontario Ministry of Education |year=2007 |title=Effective Educational Practices for Students with ASD |publisher=Queen's Printer for Ontario}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prompts are often categorized into a prompt hierarchy from most intrusive to least intrusive, although there is some controversy about what is considered most intrusive, those that are physically intrusive or those that are hardest prompt to fade (e.g.,verbal).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Barnett, D.W. |year=2006 |title=Preschool Intervention Scripts: Lessons from 20 years of Research and Practice |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6888/is_2_2/ai_n28461339/ |journal=Journal of Speech Language Pathology and Applied Behavior Analysis |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=158–81 |doi=10.1037/h0100216|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to minimize errors and ensure a high level of success during learning, prompts are given in a most-to-least sequence and faded systematically.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Pear 2003"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Martin |last2=Pear |year=2003 |title=Behavior Modification: What is it and how to do it? |edition=7th |location=Upper Saddle River NJ |publisher=Pearson Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this process, prompts are faded quickly as possible so that the learner does not come to depend on them and eventually behaves appropriately without prompting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=VanDerHeyden, A.M. |author2=Snyder, P. |author3=DiCarlo, C.F. |author4=Stricklin, S.B. |author5=Vagianos, L.A. |year=2002 |title=Comparison of within-stimulus and extra-stimulus prompts to increase targeted play behaviors in an inclusive early intervention program |journal=Behav Analyst Today |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6884/is_2_3/ai_n28132946/ |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=188–97 |doi=10.1037/h0099967}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Chesnut, M. |author2=Williamson, P.N. |author3=Morrow, J.E. |year=2003 |title=The use of visual cues to teach receptive skills to children with severe auditory discrimination deficits |journal=Behav Analyst Today |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6884/is_2_4/ai_n28173253/ |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=212–24 |doi=10.1037/h0100120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Types of prompts'''
Prompters might use any or all of the following to suggest the desired response:
* Vocal prompts: Words or other vocalizations
* Visual prompts: A visual cue or picture
* Gestural prompts: A physical gesture
* Positional prompt: e.g., the target item is placed close to the individual.
* Modeling: Modeling the desired response. This type of prompt is best suited for individuals who learn through imitation and can attend to a model.
* Physical prompts: Physically manipulating the individual to produce the desired response. There are many degrees of physical prompts, from quite intrusive (e.g. the teacher places a hand on the learner's hand) to minimally intrusive (e.g. a slight tap).&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Pear 2003"/&gt;

This is not an exhaustive list of prompts; the nature, number, and order of prompts are chosen to be the most effective for a particular individual.

===Fading===

The overall goal is for an individual to eventually not need prompts. As an individual gains mastery of a skill at a particular prompt level, the prompt is faded to a less intrusive prompt. This ensures that the individual does not become overly dependent on a particular prompt when learning a new behavior or skill.

===Thinning a reinforcement schedule===

Thinning is often confused with fading. Fading refers to a prompt being removed, where thinning refers to an increase in the time or number of responses required between reinforcements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=LeBlanc, L.A. |author2=Hagoplan, L.P. |author3=Maglieri, K.A. |author4=Poling, A. |year=2002 |title=Decreasing the intensity of reinforcement-based interventions for reducing behavior: conceptual issues and a proposed model for clinical practice |journal=Behav Analyst Today |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6884/is_3_3/ai_n28132960/ |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=289–300 |doi=10.1037/h0099991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Periodic thinning that produces a 30% decrease in reinforcement has been suggested as an efficient way to thin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cautilli, J. |year=2005 |title=Brief report: application of proposed model of decreasing reinforcement intensity |journal=Int J Behav Consult Ther |url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6886/is_1_1/ai_n28321102/ |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=21–36 |doi=10.1037/h0100731}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schedule thinning is often an important and neglected issue in [[contingency management]] and [[token economy]] systems, especially when these are developed by unqualified practitioners (see [[professional practice of behavior analysis]]).&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, J.S. &amp; Burch, M.R. (2005). ''Ethics for behavior analysts.'' LEA&lt;/ref&gt;

===Generalization===

Generalization is the expansion of a student's performance ability beyond the initial conditions set for acquisition of a skill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Alberto  |last2=Troutman |year=2006 |title=Applied behavior analysis for teachers |edition=7th  |location=Upper Saddle River NJ |publisher=Pearson Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generalization can occur across people, places, and materials used for teaching. For example, once a skill is learned in one setting, with a particular instructor, and with specific materials, the skill is taught in more general settings with more variation from the initial acquisition phase. For example, if a student has successfully mastered learning colors at the table, the teacher may take the student around the house or his school and then ''generalize'' the skill in these more natural environments with other materials. Behavior analysts have spent considerable amount of time studying factors that lead to generalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Osnes, P.G. |author2=Lieblein, T. |year=2003 |title=An explicit technology of generalization |journal=Behav Analyst Today |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6884/is_4_3/ai_n28132927/ |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=364–74 |doi=10.1037/h0099994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shaping===
{{Main article|Shaping (psychology)}}

Shaping involves gradually modifying the existing behavior into the desired behavior. If the student engages with a dog by hitting it, then he or she could have their behavior shaped by reinforcing interactions in which he or she touches the dog more gently. Over many interactions, successful shaping would replace the hitting behavior with patting or other gentler behavior. Shaping is based on a behavior analyst's thorough knowledge of [[operant conditioning]] principles and [[extinction (psychology)|extinction]]. Recent efforts to teach shaping have used simulated computer tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kemp, S.M. |author2=Eckerman, D.A. |year=2002 |title=Simulating a shaping task |journal=Behav Analyst Today |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6884/is_2_3/ai_n28132944/ |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=166–78 |doi=10.1037/h0099975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One teaching technique found to be effective with some students, particularly children, is the use of video modeling (the use of taped sequences as exemplars of behavior). It can be used by therapists to assist in the acquisition of both verbal and [[voluntary action|motor]] responses, in some cases for long [[chaining|chains]] of behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=D'Ateno, P. |author2=Mangiapanello, K. |author3=Taylor, B.A. |year= 2002 |title=Using video modeling to teach complex play sequences to a preschooler with autism |journal=J Posit Behav Interv |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=5–11 |doi=10.1177/10983007030050010801}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Corbett, B.A. |author2=Abdullah, M. |year=2005 |title=Video modeling: why does it work for children with autism? |journal=J Early Intensive Behav Interv |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=2–8 |doi=10.1037/h0100294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interventions based on an FBA===

Critical to behavior analytic interventions is the concept of a systematic behavioral [[case formulation]] with a functional behavioral assessment or analysis at the core.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tryon, W.W. |year=1976 |title=A system of behavioral diagnosis |journal=[[Prof Psychol]] |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=495–506 |doi=10.1037/0735-7028.7.4.495}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Kanfer, F.H. |author2=Saslow, G. |year=1969 |chapter=Behavioral diagnosis |editor=Franks CM |title=Behavior Therapy: Appraisal and Status |publisher=McGraw-Hill |pages=417–44 |oclc=24223}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach should apply a behavior analytic [[theory of change]] (see [[Behavioral change theories]]). This formulation should include a thorough functional assessment, a skills assessment, a sequential analysis (behavior chain analysis), an ecological assessment, a look at existing evidenced-based behavioral models for the problem behavior (such as Fordyce's model of chronic pain)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Romano, J.M. |author2=Jensen, M.P. |author3=Turner, J.A. |author4=Good, A.B. |author5=Hops, H. |year=2000 |title=Chronic pain patient-partner interactions: further support for a behavioral model of chronic pain |journal=Behav Ther |volume=31 |issue=3 |doi=10.1016/S0005-7894(00)80023-4 |pages=415–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then a treatment plan based on how environmental factors influence behavior.

ABA-based techniques are often used to change behaviors associated with [[autism]], so much so that ABA itself is often mistakenly considered to be synonymous with [[therapy for autism]].&lt;ref name=As-in-ABA/&gt; ABA for autism may be limited by diagnostic severity and IQ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Shreck, K.A. |author2=Metz, B. |author3=Mulick, J.A. |author4=Smith, A. |year=2000 |title=Making it fit: A Provocative Look at Models of Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention for Children with Autism |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6884/is_3_1/ai_n28820046/ |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=27–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Mary Jane Weiss |author2=Delmolino Lara |year=2006 |title=The Relationship Between Early Learning Rates and Treatment Outcome For Children With Autism Receiving Intensive Home-Based Applied Behavior Analysis |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6884/is_1_7/ai_n28460870/ |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=96–105 |doi=10.1037/h0100140}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most influential and widely cited review of the literature regarding efficacy of treatments for autism is the National Research Council's book ''Educating Children with Autism'' (2001) which concluded that ABA was the best research supported and most effective treatment for the main characteristics of autism. Some critics{{who|date=September 2016}} claimed that the NRC's report was an inside job by behavior analysts  but there were no board certified behavior analysts on the panel (which did include physicians, speech pathologists, educators, psychologists, and others). Other criticisms raised include the small sample sizes used in the published research to date. Medications have not been proven to correct the core deficits of ASDs and are not the primary treatment.  ABA is the primary treatment according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Management of Children With Autism Spectrum Disorders|url = http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/120/5/1162|journal = Pediatrics|date = 1 November 2007|issn = 0031-4005|pmid = 17967921|pages = 1162–1182|volume = 120|issue = 5|doi = 10.1542/peds.2007-2362|first = Scott M.|last = Myers|first2 = Chris Plauché|last2 = Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent reviews of the [[Efficacy#Healthcare|efficacy]] of ABA-based techniques in autism include:
* A 2007 clinical report of the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] concluded that the benefit of ABA-based interventions in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) "has been well documented" and that "children who receive early intensive behavioral treatment have been shown to make substantial, sustained gains in IQ, language, academic performance, and [[adaptive behavior]] as well as some measures of social behavior".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Pediatrics |year=2007 |volume=120 |issue=5 |pages=1162–82 |title=Management of children with autism spectrum disorders |author1=Myers, S.M. |author2=Johnson, C.P. |author3=Council on Children with Disabilities |doi=10.1542/peds.2007-2362 |pmid=17967921 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/120/5/1162 |laysummary=http://aap.org/advocacy/releases/oct07autism.htm |laysource=AAP |laydate=2007-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Researchers from the [[MIND Institute]] published an evidence-based review of comprehensive treatment approaches in 2008. On the basis of "the strength of the findings from the four best-designed, controlled studies", they were of the opinion that one ABA-based approach (the [[Lovaas technique]] created by [[Ole Ivar Løvaas]]) is "well-established" for improving intellectual performance of young children with ASD.&lt;ref name=Rogers2008&gt;{{cite journal |journal=J Clin Child Adolesc Psychol |year=2008 |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=8–38 |title=Evidence-based comprehensive treatments for early autism |author1=Rogers, S.J. |author2=Vismara, L.A. |doi=10.1080/15374410701817808 |pmc=2943764 |pmid=18444052}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A 2009 review of psycho-educational interventions for children with autism whose mean age was six years or less at intake found that five high-quality ("Level 1" or "Level 2") studies assessed ABA-based treatments. On the basis of these and other studies, the author concluded that ABA is "well-established" and is "demonstrated effective in enhancing global functioning in pre-school children with autism when treatment is intensive and carried out by trained therapists".&lt;ref name=Eikeseth2009&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Res Dev Disabil |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=158–78 |year=2009 |title=Outcome of comprehensive psycho-educational interventions for young children with autism |author=Eikeseth, S. |doi=10.1016/j.ridd.2008.02.003 |pmid=18385012|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5467678_Outcome_of_comprehensive_psycho-educational_interventions_for_young_children_with_autism}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the review committee also concluded that "there is a great need for more knowledge about which interventions are most effective".
* A 2009 paper included a descriptive analysis, an effect size analysis, and a [[meta-analysis]] of 13 reports published from 1987 to 2007 of early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI, a form of ABA-based treatment with origins in the Lovaas technique) for autism. It determined that EIBI's effect sizes were "generally positive" for IQ, adaptive behavior, expressive language, and receptive language. The paper did note limitations of its findings including the lack of published comparisons between EIBI and other "empirically validated treatment programs".&lt;ref name=Reichow2009&gt;{{cite journal |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=23–41 |year=2009 |title=Comprehensive synthesis of early intensive behavioral interventions for young children with autism based on the UCLA Young Autism Project model |author1=Reichow, B. |author2=Wolery, M. |doi=10.1007/s10803-008-0596-0 |pmid=18535894}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In a 2009 [[systematic review]] of 11 studies published from 1987 to 2007, the researchers wrote "there is strong evidence that EIBI is effective for some, but not all, children with autism spectrum disorders, and there is wide variability in response to treatment". Furthermore, any improvements are likely to be greatest in the first year of intervention.&lt;ref name=Howlin2009&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Howlin, P. |author2=Magiati, I. |author3=Charman, T. |editor=MacLean, Jr. |editor2=William E. |title=Systematic review of early intensive behavioral interventions for children with autism |journal=Am J Intellect Dev Disabil |volume=114 |issue=1 |pages=23–41 |year=2009 |pmid=19143460 |doi=10.1352/2009.114:23-41}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A 2009 meta-analysis of nine studies published from 1987 to 2007 concluded that EIBI has a "large" effect on full-scale intelligence and a "moderate" effect on adaptive behavior in autistic children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Eldevik, S. |author2=Hastings, R.P. |author3=Hughes, J.C. |author4=Jahr, E. |author5=Eikeseth, S. |author6=Cross, S. |title=Meta-analysis of Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention for children with autism |journal=J Clin Child Adolesc Psychol |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=439–50 |year=2009 |pmid=19437303 |doi=10.1080/15374410902851739}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2011, investigators from [[Vanderbilt University]] under contract with the [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]] performed a comprehensive review of the scientific literature on ABA-based and other therapies for autism spectrum disorders; the ABA-based therapies included the [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]/Lovaas method and the Early Start Denver Model (the latter developed by Sally Rogers and [[Geraldine Dawson]]).&lt;ref name=VanderbiltAHRQ2011&gt;{{cite book |author1=Warren, Z. |author2=Veenstra-VanderWeele, J. |author3=Stone, W. |author4=Bruzek, J.L. |author5=Nahmias, A.S. |author6=Foss-Feig, J.H. |author7=Jerome, R.N. |author8=Krishnaswami, S. |author9=Sathe, N.A. |author10=Glasser, A.M. |author11=Surawicz, T. |author12=McPheeters, M.L. |title=Therapies for children with autism spectrum disorders |year=2011 |url=http://www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/ehc/products/106/656/CER26_Autism_Report_04-14-2011.pdf |series=AHRQ Publication No. 11-EHC029-EF, Comparative Effectiveness Review No. 26 |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |location=Rockville, MD |access-date=15 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002035802/http://www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/ehc/products/106/656/CER26_Autism_Report_04-14-2011.pdf |archive-date=2 October 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; They concluded that "both approaches were associated with ... improvements in cognitive performance, language skills, and adaptive behavior skills".&lt;ref name=VanderbiltAHRQ2011/&gt;{{rp|ES-9}} However, they also concluded that "the strength of evidence ... is low", "many children continue to display prominent areas of impairment", "subgroups may account for a majority of the change", there is "little evidence of practical effectiveness or feasibility beyond research studies", and the published studies "used small samples, different treatment approaches and duration, and different outcome measurements".&lt;ref name=VanderbiltAHRQ2011/&gt;{{rp|ES-10}}

A 2009 systematic review and meta-analysis by Spreckley and Boyd of four small-n 2000–2007 studies (involving a total of 76 children) came to different conclusions than the aforementioned reviews.&lt;ref name= Spreckley2009&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Spreckley, M. |author2=Boyd, R. |title=Efficacy of applied behavioral intervention in preschool children with autism for improving cognitive, language, and adaptive behavior: a systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=J Pediatr |volume=154 |issue=3 |pages=338–44 |year=2009 |pmid=18950798 |doi=10.1016/j.jpeds.2008.09.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spreckley and Boyd reported that applied behavior intervention (ABI), another name for EIBI, did not significantly improve outcomes compared with standard care of preschool children with ASD in the areas of cognitive outcome, expressive language, receptive language, and adaptive behavior.&lt;ref name=Spreckley2009/&gt; In a letter to the editor, however, authors of the four studies meta-analyzed claimed that Spreckley and Boyd had misinterpreted one study comparing two forms of ABI with each other as a comparison of ABI with standard care, which erroneously decreased the observed efficacy of ABI.&lt;ref name=Smith2009&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Smith, T. |author2=Eikeseth, S. |author3=Sallows, G.O. |author4=Graupner, T.D. |title=Efficacy of applied behavior analysis in autism |journal=J Pediatr |volume=155 |issue=1 |pages=151–52; author reply 152–53 |year=2009 |pmid=19559310 |doi=10.1016/j.jpeds.2009.01.065}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the four studies' authors raised the possibility that Spreckley and Boyd had excluded some other studies unnecessarily, and that including such studies could have led to a more favorable evaluation of ABI.&lt;ref name=Smith2009/&gt; Spreckley, Boyd, and the four studies' authors did agree that large multi-site [[randomized trial]]s are needed to improve the understanding of ABA's efficacy in autism.&lt;ref name=Smith2009/&gt; Some initial, theoretical work has been initiated to use applied behavioral analysis (ABA) as a foundation for agent-mediated, AI-based instructions for children with autism spectrum disorder.&lt;ref name="Begoli, PRS-ABA, ABA Ontology"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Begoli|first1=Edmon|title=Procedural-Reasoning Architecture for Applied Behavior Analysis-based Instructions|date=May 2014|publisher=University of Tennessee, Knoxville|location=Knoxville, Tennessee, USA|pages=44–79|url=http://trace.tennessee.edu/utk_graddiss/2749|accessdate=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A United States District Court Judge ruled withholding ABA from children (0–21) with autism causes irreparable harm, finding Elizabeth Dudek of Florida's Agency for Healthcare Administration's position suggesting ABA was experimental was arbitrary and capricious, ordering AHCA enjoined from withholding ABA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://autism-u.com/helpdoc/Order-Case-No-11-20684-CIV.PDF Permanent Injunction Order]&lt;/ref&gt;  Thereafter, CMS ordered its guidance that all states to cover ABA via [[Head Start (program)|Head Start]] and [[Early Head Start]] EPSDT programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.medicaid.gov/Federal-Policy-Guidance/Downloads/CIB-07-07-14.pdf | title=CMCS Informational Bulletin: Clarification of Medicaid Coverage of Services to Children with Autism | publisher=Department of Health &amp; Human Services | date=July 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further research is clearly required, specifically to include larger and thus more representative samples.

===Criticism===
Conversely, various major figures within the autistic community have written biographies detailing harm caused by the provision of ABA. Several of these people have since been diagnosed with [[PTSD]] and [[Major depressive disorder|depression]]. Less scholarly reviews were provided by [[Elizabeth DeVita-Raeburn|Elizabeth Devita-Raeburn]] in ''[[The Atlantic]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/08/aba-autism-controversy/495272/|title=Is the Most Common Therapy for Autism Cruel?|first=Elizabeth|last=DeVita-Raeburn|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; magazine and by an ex-practitioner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sociallyanxiousadvocate.wordpress.com/2015/05/22/why-i-left-aba/|title=Why I Left ABA|first= Anxious |last=Advocate |website=sociallyanxiousadvocate.wordpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversy regarding ABA persists in the autism community. A 2017 study, based on a survey of 'post-traumatic stress symptoms' completed by individuals with presumed, self-reported diagnosis of ASD and their caregivers, found that 46% of the individuals who also reported receiving ABA treatment met the author's "diagnostic threshold for PTSD" via their survey score, versus 28% of respondents not reporting receipt of ABA treatment. Individuals reported as receiving ABA were 86% more likely on average (41% for adults, 130% for children) to meet the author's "diagnostic threshold".&lt;ref&gt;Henny Kupferstein. Evidence of increased PTSD symptoms in autism exposed to applied behavior analysis . "Advances in Autism". 4 (1), pp. 19-29, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the 2017 study was heavily criticized by peer reviewers who noted, among other things, that her methods for recruiting participants were faulty, she did not use appropriate operative definitions for PTSS versus PTSD, and there was detected bias baked into the hypothesis of the study.&lt;ref&gt;Justin Barrett Leaf.

The '''Atomic Energy Research Establishment''', known as '''AERE''' or colloquially '''Harwell Laboratory''', near [[Harwell, Oxfordshire]], was the main [[Headquarters|centre]] for [[nuclear power|atomic energy]] [[research and development]] in the [[United Kingdom]] from the 1940s to the 1990s.

==Founding==
In 1945 [[John Cockcroft]] was asked to set up a research laboratory to further the use of [[nuclear fission]] for both [[military]] purposes and generating energy. The criteria for selection involved finding somewhere remote with a good water supply, but within reach of good transport links and a university with a [[nuclear physics]] laboratory. This more or less limited the choice to the areas around [[Oxford]] or [[Cambridge]]. It had been decided that an RAF airfield would be chosen, the aircraft hangars being ideal to house the large atomic piles that would need to be built. Although Cambridge University had the better [[nuclear physics]] facility (the [[Cavendish Laboratory]]), the RAF did not want to abandon any of its eastern airfields because of its potential involvement in the [[Cold War]], therefore Harwell was chosen when the RAF made the airfield available. [[RAF Harwell]] was sixteen miles south of [[Oxford]] near [[Didcot]] and [[Harwell, Oxfordshire|Harwell]] (at this time in Berkshire), and on 1 January 1946 the Atomic Energy Research Establishment was formed, coming under the [[Ministry of Supply]]. The scientists mostly took over both accommodations and work buildings from the departing [[Royal Air Force|RAF]].

The early laboratory had several specialist divisions: Chemistry (initially headed by [[Egon Bretscher]], later by Robert Spence), General Physics (H.W.B. Skinner), Nuclear Physics (initially headed by [[Otto Frisch]], later E. Bretscher), Reactor Physics (John Dunworth), Theoretical Physics ([[Klaus Fuchs]], later [[Brian Flowers]] and [[Walter_Marshall,_Baron_Marshall_of_Goring|Walter Marshall]], Isotopes (Henry Seligmann), Engineering (Harold Tongue, later Robert Jackson), Chemical Engineering (A.S. White), and Metallurgy (Bruce Chalmers, later [[Monty Finniston]], FRS). Finniston was later to become chairman of the British Steel Corporation. Directors after Cockcroft included [[Basil Schonland]], Sir [[Arthur Vick]] and [[Walter Marshall, Baron Marshall of Goring|Walter Marshall]].

[[File:Aere harwell main gate.jpg|thumb|AERE main gate]]
The decision to site AERE at Harwell had huge implications for a rural area which had depended mainly on agriculture for employment before World War II. The site (which quickly became known colloquially amongst the local population as 'The Atomic') became one of the main employers in the post-war period. It also led to an influx of labour from outside the area, putting pressure on already scarce housing stocks. In response to the problem, hostels and temporary housing were established around the site. The hostels were named Icknield Way House ('B' mess, the RAF sergeants' mess), Portway House ('C' Mess, the RAF airmans' mess) and Ridgeway House ('A' Mess, the officers' mess) provided either single or double room accommodation for staff and were adopted from existing RAF structures on the site. The class distinction was maintained by the UKAEA. A-Mess housed visiting scientists, B-Mess scientific support staff and some post-graduate scientists, and C-Mess industrial support staff. The temporary housing stock consisted of several hundred '[[Prefabricated building|Prefabs]]', single storey structures manufactured in parts for quick erection, which were designed originally to help alleviate chronic housing shortages in the immediate post-war period in Britain. Two estates of 'Prefabs' were built to the north and south of the site perimeter, along with a road system and parade of shops. In later years, conventional housing was provided on estates built in [[Abingdon, Oxfordshire|Abingdon]], [[Grove, Oxfordshire|Grove]] (near [[Wantage]]) and [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]] for employees. A modern hostel (Rush Common House) was built in Abingdon. The houses were later sold (mainly to their occupants) in the 1980s and the hostels were demolished or adapted for other uses. The 'Prefab' estates lasted until the early 1990s when the residents were transferred to local authority housing. The RAF prewar NCO married quarter housing at Harwell together other UKAEA housing in Abingdon, Grove, Wantage and Newbury totaling 129 houses were sold in their entirety to the Welbeck Estate Group in 1995 and following extensive refurbishment were sold to local buyers.

Workers were bussed to the site from as far away as Reading in utilitarian grey buses marked 'AERE'.

==Early reactors==
{{main|DIDO (nuclear reactor)|GLEEP|PLUTO reactor}}
Such was the interest in nuclear power and the priority devoted to it in those days that the first reactor, [[GLEEP]], was operating by 15 August 1947. GLEEP (Graphite Low Energy Experimental Pile) was a low-power (3 [[kilowatt]]) graphite-moderated air-cooled reactor. The first reactor in Western Europe, it operated until 1990. The engineers at Harwell eventually decided that this small reactor should be put to some use, so the air that flowed over it was directed through an underground trench, where there were some pipes filled with water that connected to a secondary group of water-filled pipes that were used by the nearby establishments to heat offices.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kNwDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA78&amp;lpg=PA65&amp;dq=true#v=onepage&amp;q=true&amp;f=true "Atomic Pile Heat Warms Buildings"] ''Popular Mechanics'', May 1952, pp. 78-79&lt;/ref&gt;

A successor to GLEEP, called [[BEPO]] (British Experimental Pile 0) was constructed based on the experience with GLEEP, and commenced operation in 1948. BEPO was shut down in 1968.

[[LIDO reactor|LIDO]] was an [[enriched uranium]] thermal swimming pool reactor which operated from 1956 to 1972 and was mainly used for shielding and nuclear physics experiments. It was fully dismantled and returned to a green field site in 1995. In the same building as LIDO, DAPHNE (Dido And Pluto Handmaiden for Nuclear Experiments) was constructed to test equipment used in experiments on the two larger reactors.

A pair of larger 26 [[megawatt|MW]] reactors, [[DIDO (nuclear reactor)|DIDO]] and [[PLUTO reactor|PLUTO]], which used enriched [[uranium]] with a [[heavy water]] [[neutron moderator|moderator]] came online in 1956 and 1957 respectively. These reactors were used primarily for testing the behaviour of different materials under intense [[neutron]] irradiation to help decide what materials to build reactor components out of.   A sample could be irradiated for a few months to simulate the radiation dose that it would receive over the lifetime of a power reactor. Both reactors were also used for neutron scattering crystallography. They took over commercial [[isotope]] production from BEPO after that was shut down.  DIDO and PLUTO themselves were shut down in 1990 and the fuel, moderator and some ancillary buildings removed.  The GLEEP reactor and the hangar it was situated in were decommissioned 2005. The current plans are to decommission the BEPO, DIDO and PLUTO reactors by 2020.

==Zeta==
One of the most significant experiments to occur at AERE was the [[ZETA (fusion reactor)|ZETA]] [[fusion power]] experiment. An early attempt to build a large-scale nuclear fusion reactor, the project was started in 1954, and the first successes were achieved in 1957. In 1968 the project was shut down, as it was believed that no further progress could be made with the kind of design that ZETA represented (see [[Timeline of nuclear fusion]]).

==Organisational history==
In 1954 AERE was incorporated into the newly formed [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority]] (UKAEA). Harwell and other laboratories were to assume responsibility for atomic energy research and development. It was part of the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] (DTI).

During the 1970s the slowdown of the British nuclear energy program resulted in a greatly reduced demand for the kind of work being done by the UKAEA. Pressures on government spending also reduced the funding available. Reluctant to merely disband a quality scientific research organisation, UKAEA was required to divert its research effort to the solving of scientific problems for industry by providing paid consultancy or services. For example, an Operations Research Group was set up at Harwell, and developed shipping fleet scheduling software that was used to provide a service to British and overseas shipping companies&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BAIlXPgcsHwC&amp;lpg=PA268&amp;ots=1aT_-RwA1c&amp;dq=%22Route%20program%20sends%20profits%20sailing%20ahead%22&amp;pg=PA268#v=onepage&amp;f=false "Route program sends profits sailing ahead"], New Scientist 3 Feb 1972 p268&lt;/ref&gt; and oil reservoir   simulation software to help in the development of the UK's North Sea oil interests&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aNRaAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=harwell+oil+reservoir+simulator&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Atomic+Energy+Authority+Research "Winning More Oil: Increasing Importance for Enhanced Oil Recovery"] auth. Ray Dafter, pub. Financial Times Business Information Limited, 1981, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;. UKAEA was ordered to operate on a [[Trading Fund]] basis, i.e. to account for itself financially as though it was a private corporation, while remaining fully government owned. After several years of transition, UKAEA was divided in the early 1990s. UKAEA retained ownership of all land and infrastructure and of all nuclear facilities, and of businesses directly related to nuclear power. The remainder was privatised as [[AEA Technology]] and floated on the [[London Stock Exchange]]. Harwell Laboratory contained elements of both organisations, though the land and infrastructure was owned by UKAEA.

[[File:Aere harwell national chemical landmark.jpg|thumb|right|Harwell Laboratory blue plaque]]
The name Atomic Energy Research Establishment was dropped at the same time, and the site became known as the ''Harwell International Business Centre''. The site incorporates the [[Rutherford Appleton Laboratory]] which is home to the Science and Technology Facilities Council (including the [[ISIS neutron source]] and [[Diamond Light Source]]). In 2006, the name [[Harwell Science and Innovation Campus]] was introduced and management of the campus was passed to a Public / Private 50:50 Joint Venture partnership to take forward the management and redevelopment of the campus which has been re-branded as Harwell Oxford. In February 2009, part of the campus, the remaining nuclear licensed site, passed to the [[Nuclear Decommissioning Authority]] and is being decommissioned by Research Sites Restoration Limited (RSRL, from 2015 part of [[Magnox Ltd]]), on their behalf.

A '''bigraph''' (often used in the plural '''bigraphs''') can be modelled as the superposition of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] (the ''link graph'') and a set of [[Tree (mathematics)|trees]] (the ''place graph'').&lt;ref name="intro"&gt;''[http://www.itu.dk/research/pls/wiki/index.php/A_Brief_Introduction_To_Bigraphs A Brief Introduction To Bigraphs]'', [[IT University of Copenhagen]], Denmark.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="milner"&gt;Milner, Robin. ''[http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/archive/rm135/uam-theme.html The Bigraphical Model]'', [[University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory]], UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each [[Node (mathematics)|node]] of the bigraph is part of a graph and also part of some tree that describes how the nodes are nested. Bigraphs can be conveniently and formally displayed as [[diagram]]s.&lt;ref name="intro" /&gt; They have applications in the modelling of distributed systems for [[ubiquitous computing]] and can be used to describe [[Mobile agent|mobile]] interactions. They have also been used by [[Robin Milner]] in an attempt to subsume [[Calculus of Communicating Systems]] (CCS) and [[Pi calculus|π-calculus]].&lt;ref name="milner" /&gt; They have been studied in the context of [[category theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Anatomy of a bigraph==

Aside from nodes and ([[hyperedge|hyper-]])[[Edge (graph theory)|edges]], a bigraph may have associated with it one or more ''regions'' which are roots in the place forest, and zero or more  ''holes'' in the place graph, into which other bigraph regions may be inserted.  Similarly, to nodes we may assign ''controls'' that define identities and an arity (the number of ''ports'' for a given node to which link-graph edges may connect).  These controls are drawn from a bigraph ''signature''.  In the link graph we define ''inner'' and ''outer'' names, which define the connection points at which coincident names may be fused to form a single link.

==Foundations==

A bigraph is a 5-tuple:

&lt;math&gt;(V,E,ctrl,prnt,link) : \langle k,X \rangle \to \langle m,Y \rangle,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is a set of nodes, &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is a set of edges, &lt;math&gt;ctrl&lt;/math&gt; is the ''control map'' that assigns controls to nodes, &lt;math&gt;prnt&lt;/math&gt; is the ''parent map'' that defines the nesting of nodes, and &lt;math&gt;link&lt;/math&gt; is the ''link map'' that defines the link structure.

The notation &lt;math&gt;\langle k,X \rangle \to \langle m,Y \rangle&lt;/math&gt; indicates that the bigraph has &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; ''holes'' (sites) and a set of inner names &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; ''regions'', with a set of ''outer names'' &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;.  These are respectively known as the ''inner'' and ''outer'' interfaces of the bigraph.

Formally speaking, each bigraph is an arrow in a symmetric partial [[monoidal category]] (usually abbreviated ''spm-category'') in which the objects are these interfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-04081-8_3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, the composition of bigraphs is definable in terms of the composition of arrows in the category.

==Extensions and variants==

===Bigraphs with sharing===
[[File:Bigraphs-sharing-example.svg|alt=Example bigraph with sharing|thumb|230x230px|Example bigraph with sharing in which the node of control M is shared by the two nodes of control S. This is represented by M being in the intersection of the two S-nodes.]]

In bigraphs with sharing, the place graph is defined as a [[directed acyclic graph |directed acyclic graph (DAG)]], i.e. &lt;math&gt;prnt&lt;/math&gt; is a [[binary relation]] instead of a [[Function (mathematics)|map]]. The definition of link graph is unaffected by the introduction of sharing. Note that standard bigraphs are a sub-class of bigraphs with sharing.

A '''biometric device''' is a security identification and authentication device.  Such devices use automated methods of verifying or recognising the identity of a living person based on a physiological  or behavioral characteristic. These characteristics include fingerprints, facial images, iris and voice recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Wayman| first = James |author2=Jain, Anil. |author3= Maltonie, Davide. |author4= Maio, Dario| title =An Introduction to Biometric Authentication Systems| publisher = Springer London| date = 2005| location = Boston, MA| pages = 1–20| isbn =978-1-85233-596-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Biometric devices have been used by man over a long period of time. Non-automated biometric devices have used us since 500 BC &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mayhew|first1=Stephen|url=http://www.biometricupdate.com/201501/history-of-biometrics|website=biometricupdate.com|accessdate=24 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it was seen that Babylonian business transactions were recorded on clay tablets that included fingerprints. Automation in Biometric devices was first seen in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zhang|first1=David|title=Automated Biometrics: Technologies and Systems|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9781461545194|page=7}}&lt;!--|accessdate=24 October 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI in the 1960s, introduced the Indentimat, which started checking for fingerprints to maintain criminal records. The first systems measured the shape of the hand and the length of the fingers. Although discontinued in the 1980s, the system set a precedent for future Biometric Devices.

== Subgroups ==

The characteristic of the human body are used to access information by the users. According to these characteristics, the sub-divided groups are:
* Chemical biometric devices: Analyses the segments of the DNA to grant access to the users.
*Visual biometric devices: Analyses the visual features of the humans to grant access which includes IRIS recognition,  Face recognition, Finger recognition and Retina Recognition.
* Behavioural biometric devices: Analyses the Walking Ability and Signatures (velocity of sign, width of sign, pressure of sign) distinct to every human.
*Olfactory biometric devices: Analyses the odour to distinguish between varied users.
*Auditory biometric devices: Analyses the voice to determine the identity of a speaker for accessing control.

== Uses ==

=== Workplace ===
[[File:Heathrow Terminal 4 ePassport gates.jpg|thumb|IRIS and Fingerprint recognition at Heathrow Terminal 4]]
Biometrics are being used to establish better and accessible records of the hours employee's work. With the increase in "Buddy Punching"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=R|first1=Josphineleela|last2=Ramakrishnan|first2=Dr.M.|title=An Efficient Automatic Attendance System Using Fingerprint Reconstruction Technique|journal=International Journal of Computer Science and Information Security|date=March 2012|volume=10|issue=3|page=1|arxiv=1208.1672|bibcode=2012arXiv1208.1672R}}&lt;/ref&gt;( a case where employees clocked out coworkers and fraudulently inflated their work hours) employers have looked towards new technology like fingerprint recognition to reduce such fraud. Additionally, employers are also faced with the task of proper collection of data such as entry and exit times. Biometric devices make for largely foul proof  and reliable ways of enabling to collect data as employees have to be present to enter biometric details which are unique to them.

=== Immigration ===
As the demand for air travel grows and more people travel, modern day airports have to implement technology in such  a way that there are no long queues. Biometrics are being implemented in more and more airports as they enable quick recognition of passengers and hence lead to lower volume of people standing in queue's. One such example is of the [[Dubai International Airport]] which plans to make immigration counters a relic of the past as they implement   IRIS on the move technology (IOM) which should help the seamless departures and arrivals of passengers at the airport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Basit|first1=Abdul|title=Dubai Airport without immigration counters?|url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/business/aviation/dubai-airport-to-offer-contactless-departure-next-year|accessdate=28 October 2015|agency=Khaleej Times|date=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Handheld and personal devices ===

Fingerprint sensors can be found on mobile devices. The fingerprint sensor is used to unlock the device and authorize actions, like money and file transfers, for example. It can be used to prevent a device from being used by an unauthorized person.

== Present day biometric devices ==

[[File:Online signture.jpg|thumbnail|right|The signature is authenticated by the spaces taken in each square]]

=== Personal signature verification systems ===
This is one of the most highly recognised&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=M.M Fahmy|first1=Maged|title=Online handwritten signature verification system based on DWT features extraction and neural network classification|journal=Ain Shams Engineering Journal|date=5 November 2010|volume=1|issue=1|pages=59–70|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/S2090447910000080/1-s2.0-S2090447910000080-main.pdf?_tid=7ee6502a-82de-11e5-84fc-00000aacb361&amp;acdnat=1446632962_81a79aabec4be6f995a00eba48fe714f|accessdate=4 November 2015|doi=10.1016/j.asej.2010.09.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and acceptable biometrics in corporate surroundings. This verification has been taken one step further by capturing the signature while taking into account many parameters revolving around this like the pressure applied while signing, the speed of the hand movement and the angle made between the surface and the pen used to make the signature. This system also has the ability to learn from users as signature styles vary for the same user. Hence by taking a sample of data, this system is able to increase its own accuracy.

=== Iris recognition system ===
Iris recognition involves the device scanning the retina of the subject and then cross referencing that to data stored on the database. It is one of the most secure forms of authentication, as while fingerprints can be left behind on surfaces, iris prints are extremely hard to be stolen. Iris recognition is widely applied by organisations dealing with the masses, one being the Aadhar identification carried out by the Indian government to keep records of its population. The reason for this is that iris recognition makes use of iris prints of humans, which hardly evolve during one's lifetime and are extremely stable.

== Problems with present day biometric devices ==

=== Biometric spoofing ===
[[File:Dacty poederen.JPG|thumb|Using fine powder and a brush to reveal and copy fingerprints]]

Biometric spoofing is a method of fooling&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Trader|first1=John|title=Liveness Detection to Fight Biometric Spoofing|url=http://blog.m2sys.com/scanning-and-efficiency/liveness-detection-fight-biometric-spoofing/|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a biometric identification management system, where a counterfeit mold is presented in front of the biometric scanner. This counterfeit mold emulates the unique biometric attributes of an individual so as to confuse the system between the artifact and the real biological target and gain access to sensitive data/materials.

One such high-profile case of Biometric spoofing came to the limelight when it was found that German Defence Minister, Ursula von der Leyen's fingerprint had been successfully replicated &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=German minister fingered as hacker 'steals' her thumbprint from a PHOTO|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/12/29/german_minister_fingered_as_hackers_steal_her_thumbprint_from_a_photo/|accessdate=21 October 2015|agency=The Register|date=29 Dec 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the Chaos Computer Club Group. The group used high quality camera lenses and shot images from 6 feet away. They used a professional finger software and mapped the contours of the Ministers thumbprint. Although progress has been made to stop spoofing. Using the principle of  pulse oximetry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reddy|first1=P.V|last2=Kumar|first2=A|last3=Rahman|first3=S|last4=Mundra|first4=T.S|title=A New Antispoofing Approach for Biometric Devices|journal=EEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS|volume=2|issue=4|pages=328–337|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=4669626|accessdate=23 October 2015|doi=10.1109/tbcas.2008.2003432}}&lt;/ref&gt;- the liveliness of the test subject is taken into account by measure of blood oxygenation and the heart rate. This reduces attacks like the ones mentioned above, although these methods arent commercially applicable as costs of implementation are high. This reduces their real world application and hence makes biometrics insecure until these methods are commercially viable.

=== Accuracy ===
Accuracy is a major issue with biometric recognition. [[Password]]s are still extremely popular, because a password is static in nature, while biometric data can be subject to change (such as one's voice becoming heavier due to puberty, or an accident to the face, which could lead to improper reading of facial scan data). When testing voice recognition as a substitute to [[Personal identification number|PIN]]-based systems, [[Barclays]] reported&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Say goodbye to the pin: voice recognition takes over at Barclays Wealth|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/10044493/Say-goodbye-to-the-pin-voice-recognition-takes-over-at-Barclays-Wealth.html|website=The Telegraph|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that their voice recognition system is 95 percent accurate. This statistic means that many of its customers' voices might still not be recognised even when correct. This uncertanity revolving around the system could lead to slower adoption of biometric devices, continuing the reliance of traditional password-based methods.

== Benefits of biometric devices over traditional methods of authentication ==

* Biometric data cannot be lent and hacking of Biometric data is complicated &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O’Gorman|first1=Lawrence|title=Comparing Passwords, Tokens, and Biometrics for User Authentication|journal=Proceedings of the IEEE|volume=91|issue=12|pages=2021–2040|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=1246384|accessdate=30 October 2015|doi=10.1109/jproc.2003.819611}}&lt;/ref&gt; hence it makes it safer to use than traditional methods of authentication like passwords which can be lent and shared. Passwords don't have the ability to judge the user but rely only on the data provided by the user, which can easily be stolen while Biometrics work on the uniqueness of each individual.
* Passwords can be forgotten and recovering them can take time, whereas Biometric devices rely on biometric data which tends to be unique to a person, hence there is no risk of forgetting the authentication data. A study conducted among Yahoo users found that at least 1.5 percent &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Florencio|first1=Dinei|last2=Herley|first2=Cormac|title=A Large-Scale Study of Web Password Habits|journal=WWW 2007 / Track: Security, Privacy, Reliability, and Ethics|page=657| doi = 10.1145/1242572.1242661 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of Yahoo users forgot their passwords every month, hence this makes accessing services more lengthy for consumers as the process of recovering passwords is lengthy. These shortcomings make Biometric devices more efficient and reduces effort for the end user.

== Future ==
Researchers are targeting the drawbacks of present-day biometric devices and developing to reduce problems like biometric spoofing and inaccurate intake of data. Technologies which are being developed are-
* The United States Military academy are developing  an algorithm &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Funk|first1=Wolfgang|last2=Arnold|first2=Michael|last3=Busch|first3=Christoph|last4=Munde|first4=Axel|title=Evaluation of Image Compression Algorithms for Fingerprint and Face Recognition Systems|journal=2005 IEEE Information Assurance Workshop}}&lt;/ref&gt; that allows identification through the ways each individual interacts with their own  computers; this algorithm considers unique traits like typing speed, rhythm of writing and common spelling mistakes. This data allows the algorithm to create a unique profile for each user by combining their multiple behavioural and stylometric information. This can be very difficult to replicate collectively.
* A recent innovation by Kenneth Okereafor &lt;ref&gt; K. U. Okereafor, C. Onime and O. E. Osuagwu, "Multi-biometric Liveness Detection - A New Perspective," West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research, vol. 16, no. 1, pp. 26 - 37, 2016 (https://www.ajol.info/index.php/wajiar/article/view/145878)&lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;ref&gt;	K. U. Okereafor, C. Onime and O. E. Osuagwu, "Enhancing Biometric Liveness Detection Using Trait Randomization Technique," 2017 UKSim-AMSS 19th International Conference on Modelling &amp; Simulation, University of Cambridge, Conference Proceedings, pp. 28 – 33, 2017 (http://uksim.info/uksim2017/CD/data/2735a028.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;, presented an optimized and secure design  of applying biometric liveness detection technique using a trait randomization approach. This novel concept potentially opens up new ways of mitigating biometric spoofing more accurately, and making impostor predictions intractable or very difficult in future biometric devices. A simulation of Kenneth Okereafor's biometric liveness detection algorithm using a 3D multi-biometric framework consisting of 15 liveness parameters from facial print, finger print and iris pattern traits resulted in a system efficiency of the 99.2% over a cardinality of 125 distinct randomization combinations. The uniqueness of Okereafor's innovation lies in the application of uncorrelated biometric trait parameters including intrinsic and involuntary biomedical properties from eye blinking pattern, pulse oxymetry, finger spectroscopy, electrocardiogram, perspiration, etc.  
*A group of Japanese Researchers have created a system  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Malenkovich|first1=Serge|title=10 Biometric Security Codes of the Future|url=https://blog.kaspersky.com/10-biometric-security-codes-of-the-future/724/|website=kaspersky.com|accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which uses 400 sensors in a chair to identify the contours and unique pressure points of a person. This derrière authenticator, still undergoing massive improvements and modifications, is claimed to be 98 percent accurate and is seen to have application in anti theft device mechanisms in cars.
*Inventor Lawrence F. Glaser has developed and patented technology which appears at first to be a high definition display.  However, unlike displays with 2 dimensional pixel arrays, this technology incorporates pixel stacks, accomplishing a series of goals leading to the capture of a multi-biometric.  It is believed to be the first man-made device which can capture 2 or more distinct biometrics from the same region of pixel stacks (forming a surface) at the same instant, allowing for the data to form a third biometric, which is a more complex pattern inclusive as to how the data aligns.  An example would be to capture the finger print and the capillary pattern at precisely the same moment.  Other opportunities exist with this technology, such as to capture kirlean data which assures the finger was alive during an event, or capture of bone details forming another biometric used with the others previously mentioned. The concept of stacking pixels to achieve increased functionality from less surface area is combined with the ability to emit any color from a single pixel, eliminating the need for RGB (RED GREEN BLUE) surface emissions.  Lastly, the technology was tested with high power cadmium magnetics to check for distortion or other anomalies, as the inventor wanted to also embed magnetic emission and magnetic collection with this same surface technology, but without exhibiting any magnetic stripes on the surface.  Devices, such as smart cards, can pass magnetic data from any orientation by automatically sensing what the user has done, and using data about where the card is when "swiped" or inserted into a reader. This technology can detect touch or read gestures at distance, without a user side camera and with no active electronics on its surface.  Reference material and drawings are available at the US Patent Office, US Patent #s 9065893, 9122966 and published specification 20150356285.  The use of Multibiometrics hardens automated identity acquisition by a factor of 800,000,000 and will prove to be very difficult to hack or emulate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4334">'''Bouin solution''', or '''Bouin's solution''', is a compound [[Fixation (histology)|fixative]] used in [[histology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Histotechnology: A Self-Instructional Text |edition=3 |last1=Carson |first1=Freida L. |last2=Hladik |first2=Christa |year=2009 |publisher=[[American Society for Clinical Pathology]] Press |location=Hong Kong |isbn=978-0-89189-581-7 |page=19 |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was invented by French biologist [[Pol Bouin]] and is composed of [[picric acid]], [[acetic acid]] and [[formaldehyde]] in an aqueous solution. It is especially good for [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract]] biopsies because this fixative allows crisper and better [[Cell nucleus|nuclear]] [[staining]] than 10% neutral-buffered formalin. It is not a good fixative when tissue [[ultrastructure]] must be preserved for [[Electron microscope|electron microscopy]]. However, it is a good fixative when tissue structure with a soft and delicate texture must be preserved. Formalin-fixed tissue is normally [[mordant]]ed with Bouin solution for better staining results in the [[trichrome stain]]s. The acetic acid in this fixative [[Lysis|lyses]] [[red blood cell]]s and dissolves small iron and calcium deposits in tissue. A variant in which the acetic acid is replaced with [[formic acid]] can be used for both fixation of tissue and decalcification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Theory and Practice of Histology Techniques |editor1-first=John D. |editor1-last=Bancroft |editor2-first=Marilyn |editor2-last=Gamble |edition=6 |year=2008 |publisher=Churchill Livingstone Elsevier |location=China |isbn=978-0-443-10279-0 |page=72 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects of the three chemicals in Bouin solution balance each other. Formalin causes cytoplasm to become basophilic but this effect is balanced by the effect of the picric acid. This results in excellent nuclear and cytoplasmic [[H&amp;E stain]]ing. The tissue hardening effect of formalin is balanced by the soft tissue fixation of picric acid. The tissue swelling effect of acetic acid is balanced by the tissue shrinking effect of picric acid.

When using Bouin solution, several potential problems can arise. Due to the formalin in the solution, formalin pigment may be present when viewing tissue sections under the microscope. Wet tissue should be fixed in Bouin solution for less than 24 hours. Excess picric acid should be washed out of tissue using several alcohol and water solutions or staining quality may deteriorate over time. Wet tissue fixed in Bouin solution should be stored in an alcohol and water solution rather than Bouin solution. Since Bouin solution contains formaldehyde, picric acid and acetic acid, appropriate safety precautions for these substances should be taken and regulations followed.  In particular, noting that picric acid can be explosive, sensitive to friction and shock when dry and in contact with some metals can form unstable metal picrates.

Under the name "Bouin's fluid" this fixative is also widely used for marine invertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Invertebrate Animals - Collection and Preservation |editor1-first=Roger J. |editor1-last=Lincoln |editor2-first=John Gordon |editor2-last=Sheals |edition=1 |year=1979 |publisher=British Museum (Natural History) |location=UK |isbn=0 521 296773 |page=128 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is prepared as follows: picric acid, saturated aqueous solution – 75 ml; formalin, 40% aqueous solution – 25 ml; acetic acid, glacial – 5 ml.

==Variations==

===Gendre solution===
Gendre solution is an alcoholic version of Bouin solution. An alcoholic solution saturated with picric acid is used instead of an aqueous solution saturated with picric acid when making this solution. This solution is useful when [[glycogen]] and other [[carbohydrate]]s must be preserved in tissue.

===Hollande solution===
Hollande solution is a version of Bouin solution that contains [[Copper(II) acetate|copper acetate]]. The copper acetate stabilizes red blood cell membranes and the [[Granule (cell biology)|granules]] of [[Eosinophil granulocyte|eosinophil]]s and [[Endocrine system|endocrine]] cells so that there is less lysis of these cell components than occurs in regular Bouin solution.

'''Brain painting''' is a non-invasive [[P300 (neuroscience)|P300]]-based [[brain-computer interface]] (BCI)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fazel-Rezai|first1=Reza|last2=Allison|first2=Brendan Z.|last3=Guger|first3=Christoph|last4=Sellers|first4=Eric W.|last5=Kleih|first5=Sonja C.|last6=Kübler|first6=Andrea|title=P300 brain computer interface: current challenges and emerging trends|journal=Frontiers in Neuroengineering|volume=5|doi=10.3389/fneng.2012.00014}}&lt;/ref&gt; that allows painting without the use of muscular activity. The technology combines [[electroencephalography]], signal processing algorithms and visual stimulation on a monitor to detect where the user focuses his attention, allowing him to voluntarily trigger commands to a painting software. The research project aims at assisting people afflicted with the [[Locked-in syndrome]] due to neurological or neuromuscular disease (e.g. [[Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis]] ALS), who are severely restricted in communication with their environment, and therefore cut off from the possibility of creative expression.

==History==
Brain painting was co-developed by Andrea Kübler from the University of Würzburg (Germany) and Adi Hoesle. After development and testing, Brain Painting first appeared in 2010 to general press&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Isabelle|first1=Bareither|title=Malen mit Gedanken: Hirn an Rechner, bitte mehr Blau!|url=http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/mensch/malen-mit-gedanken-hirn-an-rechner-bitte-mehr-blau-a-726767-2.html|website=Spiegel Online|date=18 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to scientific press with a report of evaluation on healthy and locked-in participants&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Münßinger|first1=Jana I.|last2=Halder|first2=Sebastian|last3=Kleih|first3=Sonja C.|last4=Furdea|first4=Adrian|last5=Raco|first5=Valerio|last6=Hösle|first6=Adi|last7=Kübler|first7=Andrea|title=Brain Painting: First Evaluation of a New Brain–Computer Interface Application with ALS-Patients and Healthy Volunteers|journal=Frontiers in Neuroscience|volume=4|doi=10.3389/fnins.2010.00182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17484">[[File:Bynesian decay efflorescence.tif|thumb|Crystallized salt clusters ([[efflorescence]]) produced by Byne's disease on a gastropod shell's surface]]

'''Byne's disease''', more accurately known as '''Bynesian decay''', is a peculiar and permanently damaging condition (resulting from an ongoing [[chemical reaction]]) which often attacks [[mollusk shell]]s that are in storage or on [[Display case|display]] for long periods of time.&lt;ref name="Sally2"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shelton |first=S. |year=1996 |title=The Shell Game: Mollusks Shell Deterioration in Collections and its Prevention |journal=The Festivus |volume=28 |issue=7 |pages=74–80 |url=http://s190418054.onlinehome.us/portal/1999/9908mon.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124152217/http://s190418054.onlinehome.us/portal/1999/9908mon.pdf |archivedate=2009-01-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bynesian decay is a form of [[efflorescence]] of [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] formed by the reaction of [[acid]]ic vapors with the [[base (chemistry)|basic]] shell surface. The efflorescence can sometimes superficially resemble a growth of [[mold]]. Although first described in the early 19th century, Bynesian decay was not well understood until almost a hundred years later. The condition is named after the man (L. Byne) who is best known for describing it in the late 19th century, even though he was not the first person to describe it in print. In addition, Byne mistakenly assumed that the condition was caused by [[bacteria]], and thus the condition came to be referred to as a "disease".

In addition to mollusk shells, various other [[natural history]] [[Biological specimen|specimen]]s are susceptible to this form of decay, including [[eggshell]]s&lt;ref name="RS2001"&gt;Ryhl-Svendsen, M. (2001). [http://iaq.dk/image/eggshell.htm "Bynes efflorescence on an egg shell"]. (IAQ): ''Museums and Archives''.&lt;/ref&gt; and some [[fossil]]s and [[mineral]] samples that are composed of [[calcium carbonate]]. This condition is of concern for [[museum]] scientists, and also for anyone who has a private collection of specimens of these kinds. In order to avoid Bynesian decay, the use of metal, non-reactive polymers and acid-free materials of archival quality are preferred over common paper, wood-based materials, ordinary glues and varnishes in collection environments. Management of affected specimens includes washing and thorough drying, with a subsequent reallocation to an archival setting.

==Appearance==

[[File:Bynesian Decay 001.JPG|thumb|Some affected mollusk shells. The efflorescence is clearly visible in both specimens. This decay was deliberately produced under extreme conditions.]]

Byne's disease can appear as a powdery white coating on a shell. It also often looks as if a shell has been "infected" with [[mold]]; however, under magnification the mold-like appearance is revealed to be a crystalline growth of salts.&lt;ref name="Tennent"/&gt;

==History==
In 1839, the [[British people|British]] [[naturalist]] and [[malacologist]] [[Thomas Brown (naturalist)|Thomas Brown]] (1785–1862) briefly mentioned this form of deterioration in his book ''A Conchologist's Text-Book''.&lt;ref name="Sally2"/&gt; Agnes Kenyon also described the condition in 1896, suggesting that "saline particles in the [[atmosphere]] [were] evidently exerting a [[corrosive]] effect".&lt;ref name="Sally2"/&gt;

;Origin of the name

In 1899, the British amateur [[conchology|conchologist]] and [[naturalist]] Loftus St. George Byne (1872–1947)&lt;ref name="Salisbury"&gt;Salisbury A. E. (1951). "Obituaries: Ronald Winckworth, 1884–1950".

Byne was convinced that [[butyric acid]] was present together with [[calcium acetate]] in the affected shells, although he never really described the methods he used in the so-called "extensive chemical tests" he claimed to  have applied to these [[Biological specimen|specimen]]s. Among other conclusions, he assumed that the butyric acid originated from [[bacteria]]l activity. He also concluded that the decaying effect 'travelled from shell to shell and drawer to drawer',&lt;ref name="Byne"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Byne|first=L. St G.|year=1899|title=The corrosion of shells in cabinets|journal=Journal of Conchology|volume=9|issue=6|pages=172–178}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus the condition came to be called a "disease".&lt;ref name=Sally2 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sally Byne's" /&gt;

;Clarification and resolution

The true nature of the "disease" was partially clarified in 1934, when the [[British government]] [[chemist]] John Ralph Nicholls explained that oak cabinets at the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] in London were giving off acetic acid fumes, which were attacking the shells stored in them.&lt;ref name="Sally2"/&gt;

In 1985, almost 150 years after the Byne's disease was first mentioned in the literature, Norman H. Tennent and Thomas Baird published an extensive study on the subject. Their deep analysis, involving many complex and sophisticated techniques such as [[X-Ray diffraction]], [[infrared spectroscopy]], [[thermogravimetric analysis]] and [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]], finally revealed the true nature of the decaying process. They identified the substances involved (the [[calcium]] salts), as well as the [[chemical reaction]]s that originated them. They concluded that Byne's disease is not actually a disease, and is in fact caused by simple chemical reactions which occur in the presence of acidic vapors originating from the immediate environment in which the specimens are stored.&lt;ref name="Tennent"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/1506091|last=Tennent|first=N. H.|author2=Baird, T.|year=1985|title=The Deterioration of Mollusca Collections: Identification of Shell Efflorescence|journal=Studies in Conservation|publisher=International Institute For Conservation Of Historic And Artistic Works (IIC)|volume=30|pages=73–85|issn=0039-3630|jstor=1506091|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemistry==

Bynesian decay usually starts when specimens are stored or displayed for considerable periods of time in an enclosed space. The storage method itself usually causes this problem, when containers, cabinets or [[display case]]s are entirely or partially made of [[wood]], [[plywood]] or other wood products such as [[Masonite]], or when the specimens are surrounded by, or in contact with, various other kinds of materials that are [[cellulose]]-based and can turn water vapor [[acid]]ic.&lt;ref name="Sally Byne's"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sturm"/&gt;

Other potentially damaging materials include non-archival quality [[Paperboard|cardboard]], card, [[paper]], [[cotton]] and [[Cork material|cork]], all of which give off acidic vapors over time. [[PVC]] and [[polyurethane]] plastics are also a problem, as they also degrade and give off acidic vapors with time.&lt;ref name="Sturm"/&gt; High [[humidity]] of the air is a significant contributing factor, as is lack of ventilation of the specimens. High ambient temperatures can increase the rapidity of the decay.&lt;ref name="Sally Byne's"/&gt;

Generally, in cabinets or display cases that are entirely or partially made of wood, the [[hydrolysis]] of [[acetyl]] groups in the wood [[hemicellulose]]s creates [[acetic acid]]. The rate at which the acetic acid is produced is proportional to the concentration of [[esters]] in the wood, the humidity, the temperature, and the overall acidity of the environment.&lt;ref name="Berndt"&gt;Berndt, H. (1987). [http://www.wag-aic.org/1987/berndt87.pdf "Assessing the Detrimental Effects of Wood and Wood Products on the Environment Inside Display Cases"]. AIC, Vancouver, BC.&lt;/ref&gt; Acidic fumes can also be released from [[formaldehyde]] which can occur in wood as a degradation product of [[lignin]]. Acidic fumes can also be given off from ubiquitous [[formaldehyde]] [[resins]] (commonly [[urea-formaldehyde resins]]).&lt;ref name="Berndt"/&gt;

In the first case, acetic acid reacts with the calcium carbonate (one of the main components of freshwater, marine and land shells, birds' eggs and other such specimens) producing [[calcium acetate]], a salt. [[Formaldehyde]] can be oxidized by the oxygen in air to create [[formic acid]], which then has basically the same effects as [[acetic acid]], reacting with calcium carbonate to produce a salt. The salts ([[calcium acetate]] and [[calcium formate]]) crystallize through the specimen's outer surface, destroying its fine detail and exposing more areas for further reaction. As the condition progresses, the salt crystals build up over the specimen's surface, which becomes increasingly eroded.&lt;ref name="Sally Byne's"&gt;Shelton, S.Y. (2008).

National Park Service USA.&lt;/ref&gt;

The calcium carbonate and acetic acid chemical reaction occurs as follows:&lt;ref name="Brokerhof"&gt;Brokerhof, A. (1999).

Calcium carbonate and formic acid chemical reaction occurs as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Baltrusaitis, J., Usher, C. and Grassian, V. (2006). "Reactivity of Formic Acid on Calcium Carbonate Single Particle and Single Crystal Surfaces: Effect of Adsorbed Water". ''Microscopy and Microanalysis'' (Cambridge University Press) '''12'''(Suppl 2): 796-797.&lt;/ref&gt;

:[[Calcium carbonate|CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] + 2[[Formic acid|CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] → [[Calcium formate|Ca(HCOO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] + [[Water|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]] + [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]

Calcium carbonate and sulfuric acid chemical reaction occurs as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Casiday, R. and Frey, R.
[http://www.chemistry.wustl.edu/~edudev/LabTutorials/Water/FreshWater/acidrain.html'''Acid Rain Inorganic Reactions Experiment''']. Department of Chemistry, Washington University.&lt;/ref&gt;

:[[Calcium carbonate|CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] + [[Sulfuric Acid|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] → [[Calcium sulfate|CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] + [[Water|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]] + [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]

In this last reaction, calcium carbonate reacts with [[sulfuric acid]] and produce calcium sulfate, water and carbon dioxide.

==Prevention==
When specimens are to be placed in any size of container for long-term storage or display, the consistent use of only archival-quality materials prevents the development of Byne's disease. Thus, materials such as metal cabinets and display cases, archival quality paper labels and card trays are used in museum collections of specimens that might be vulnerable to this reaction.&lt;ref name="Sally Byne's"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sturm"/&gt;

It is also worth mentioning that sea shells, after collecting, need to be washed thoroughly in freshwater to remove the salt that is on and in the shell, and then dried thoroughly before they are stored. Salt attracts moisture and makes shells more vulnerable to Bynesian decay.&lt;ref name=Sally2 /&gt;

The following is a chart that shows non-archival materials and their archival equivalents:&lt;ref name=Sturm /&gt;

|}

If possible, the use of wood and [[cellulose]] derivatives should be avoided entirely. Many [[varnish]]es and [[paint]]s are well known emitters of [[volatile organic compounds]] (VOCs),&lt;ref name="Tétreault"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/1506710|last=Tétreault|first=J.|author2=Stamatopoulou, E.|year=1997|title=Determination of Concentrations of Acetic Acid Emitted from Wood Coatings in Enclosures|jstor=1506710|journal=Studies in Conservation|volume=42|issue=3|pages=141–156}}&lt;/ref&gt; some of which may be acidic, and thus have the potential to damage calcium carbonate specimens. Because of this, these [[coating]]s should also be avoided; water-based varnishes and paints are considered less harmful, and should be preferred.&lt;ref name="Sturm"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sturm|first=C. F. |author2=Pearce, T.A. |author3=Valdés, A.|title=The Mollusks: A Guide to their Study, Collection, and Preservation|publisher=Universal Publishers|year=2006|pages=45–57|chapter=Archival and Curatorial Methods|isbn=1-58112-930-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the reactions involved in Bynesian decay require a certain quantity of [[moisture]] in the air in order for them to take place, keeping the air somewhat dry, i.e. keeping the environmental [[relative humidity]] under control is beneficial. This is achieved by careful monitoring of the relative humidity (using instruments such as a [[hygrometer]]), and applying [[dehumidifiers]] when necessary; sometimes, simple [[air conditioning]] systems may suffice. Extremely low humidity can damage some specimens, so caution is recommended. Usually, a relative humidity maintained around 50% is considered to be adequate.&lt;ref name="Sally Byne's"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sturm"/&gt; Applying [[sorbent]]s containing a [[strong base]], such as [[potassium hydroxide]], inside the storage environment to protect the specimens against degradation is also possible. Copy paper or KOH-impregnated [[filter paper]] are some low cost examples of sorbents which can be used. These strong bases have a preference to react with acid, thus they compete successfully with the calcium carbonate specimens for any acidic vapors that may be present. The bases also help reduce the overall acid [[concentration]] inside the enclosed space.&lt;ref name="Brokerhof"/&gt;

==Management==
The damage to specimens is unfortunately not reversible; however, the decay can be arrested by washing or soaking the specimens in water, followed by a very thorough drying. The specimens must then be placed in an environment that consists of only archival materials, in a completely archival setting.&lt;ref name=Sally2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sturm /&gt;

==Pyrite disease==
In collections which contain [[fossils]], high humidity can also affect [[pyrite]] (or its more reactive polymorph [[marcasite]]) (iron sulphide) fossils in a somewhat similar condition, which is known as [[marcasite#Pyrite Decay|pyrite disease]]. The [[iron sulfide]] can react with water and oxygen to form [[iron sulfate]]s and [[sulfuric acid]], which then can produce Bynesian decay.&lt;ref name="Sturm"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cavallari&amp;Salvador&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cavallari|first1=D.C.|last2=Salvador|first2=R.B.|last3=Cunha|first3=B.R.|title=Dangers to malacological collections: Bynesian decay and Pyrite decay|journal=Collection Forum|date=2014|volume=28|issue=1-2|pages=35–46|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Daniel_Cavallari/publication/269112497_Dangers_to_malacological_collections_Bynesian_decay_and_pyrite_decay/links/549b14ca0cf2d6581ab2e158.pdf?origin=publication_detail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13104">'''Channel 37''' is a purposefully unused [[UHF television broadcasting|ultra-high frequency (UHF) television broadcasting]] television channel in the United States, Canada and Mexico. The frequency range allocated to this channel is important for [[radio astronomy]], so broadcasting is not licensed.

==History==
Channel 37 in System M and N{{clarify|date=September 2018}} countries occupies a [[band (radio)|band]] of [[UHF]] frequencies from 608 to 614 [[Hertz|MHz]]. This band is particularly important to [[radio astronomy]] because it allows observation in a region of the spectrum in between the dedicated frequency allocations near 410&amp;nbsp;MHz and 1.4&amp;nbsp;GHz. The area reserved or unused differs from nation to nation and region to region (as for example the EU and British Isles have slightly different reserved frequency areas).

One radio astronomy application in this band is for [[very-long-baseline interferometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sites.nationalacademies.org/xpedio/groups/bpasite/documents/webpage/bpa_048869.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310090720/http://sites.nationalacademies.org/xpedio/groups/bpasite/documents/webpage/bpa_048869.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When UHF channels were being allocated in the United States in 1952, channel 37 was assigned to 18 communities across the country. One of them, [[Valdosta, Georgia]], featured the only [[construction permit]] ever issued for channel 37: WGOV-TV, owned by Eurith Dickenson "Dee" Rivers Jr., son of the [[Eurith D. Rivers|former governor of Georgia]] (hence the call letters). Rivers received the CP on February 26, 1953, but WGOV-TV never made it to the air; on October 28, 1955 they requested an allocation on channel 8, but the petition was denied.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uhftelevision.com/articles/channel37.html History of UHF television: Why Is There No Channel 37?]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) adopted a 10-year moratorium on any allocation of stations to Channel 37. A new ban on such stations took effect at the beginning of 1974, and was made permanent by a number of later FCC actions. As a result of this, and similar actions by the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]], Channel 37 has never been used by any [[terrestrial television|over-the-air]] [[television station]] in Canada or the United States.

== Allocation issues ==
Reservations and use outside the US have a non-exclusive legal status
* The [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) enacted such a ban on Channel 37, but Radio Astronomy has no Exclusive Status on this channel.
* [[Mexico]] observes a similar ban on the use of this TV channel, but the allocation, like Canada's, is not exclusive. 
* Guatemala has a ban on Channel 37.
* Most [[NTSC]] System-M countries have an informal ban on Channel 37 as well, but don't give radio astronomy exclusive use of the channel.

Since July 2000, Channel 37 may be used in the US for medical [[telemetry]] equipment on a co-primary basis.{{clarify|date=September 2018}} This equipment must emit no more than one [[watt]] of [[effective radiated power]], and is for use in hospitals and other such facilities.
* The power level permitted by the FCC is many times more than the amount allowed for [[Title 47 CFR Part 15|Part 15]] [[Low-power broadcasting|unlicensed broadcasting]].
* In US areas set aside for radio-frequency silence, this equipment is banned by statute and regulation. 
* This seemingly low power level can be troublesome for radio astronomy equipment, which depends on detecting extraordinarily low [[signal strength]]s. Any use of the same frequencies raises the [[noise floor]], thereby decreasing the [[signal-to-noise ratio]], and making the work more difficult.

[[Channel 1 (NTSC-M)|Channel 1]] was also removed from the TV [[bandplan]] in the late 1940s, [[channel 70|channels 70]] to [[channel 83|83]] (800&amp;nbsp;MHz band) by the 1980s mainly for [[Advanced Mobile Phone System|AMPS]] [[mobile phone]]s and, in June 2009, channels 52 to 69 (700&amp;nbsp;MHz band) for [[mobile phone]]s, [[emergency service]]s and [[mobile TV]] services such as [[Qualcomm]]'s now-defunct [[MediaFLO]] (channel 55).  Additional channels from 38 to 51 (600&amp;nbsp;MHz band) are being taken away from TV broadcasters after [[FCC auction 1000]] ended in early 2017, which will leave channel 37 as a [[guard band]] between repacked TV stations and more mobile networks, for which [[T-Mobile USA]] won most of the licenses.

Certain channels, 14 through 20, are used for land mobile communications in some large metropolitan areas in the U.S.  However, facilities using this decades-old co-allocation are just treated as another station to avoid interference to in their local area.

The channels displayed by [[cable converter box]]es under these numbers are not on the same frequencies as their over-the-air counterparts; there are also [[virtual channel]] numbering schemes in use in [[digital television]] which do not map directly to fixed frequency channel assignments. As such, a "cable 37" channel may (and most often does) exist, but on a much lower frequency.

== Fictional usage ==
Channel 37 is sometimes seen in fiction, the same way [[telephone number]]s with the "[[555 (telephone number)|555]]" [[telephone exchange]] [[Telephone prefix|prefix]] are used.

Channel 37 has been used as a hypothetical example in instruction manuals, where it serves a role analogous to the fictitious [[example.com|example.org]] and [[example.com|example.net]] [[Internet domain]]s and the [[Reserved IP addresses|{{IPaddr|2001:db8}} IP address]].

== Outside North America ==

===In NTSC-M countries===
Outside North America, channel 37 is actively used in these countries where NTSC-M is used:
*In the [[Philippines]], Channel 37 was used by [[DWAO-TV|UNTV-37]] in Metro Manila as [[Progressive Broadcasting Corporation]]'s analog channel. However, its digital broadcast assignment is on Channel 38 (ISDB-T). It is used by [[DYCB-TV|ABS-CBN TV-3]] in Cebu City, Cebu as [[ABS-CBN]]'s digital channel (ISDB-T). However, its analog broadcasts primarily on Channel 3. It is used by [[DYAF-TV|ABS-CBN TV-10]] in Iloilo City, Iloilo as [[ABS-CBN]]'s digital channel (ISDB-T). However, its analog broadcasts primarily on Channel 10. Also used by [[DXMJ-TV|GMA TV-5]] in Davao as [[GMA Network]]'s digital channel (ISDB-T). However, its analog broadcasts primarily on Channel 5. 
* in [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[WIN TV (Trinidad and Tobago)|WIN-TV]] is broadcast on Channels 37 and 39, using [[NTSC]]
* In the [[Dominican Republic]] channel 37 is also used for the ''CDN'' news channel
* In [[South Korea]] [[KBS2|KBS 2TV]]'s Analog channel on gwanak-san Transmission station.(01.Jan.2012 04:00 closed.)

===In other countries===
In these other countries, the [[frequency allocation]] for these TV channels is different:
* in the UK (many [[transmitter]]s used by the [[Five (TV channel)|Five]] network actually broadcast on channel 37)
* in Western Europe, Channel 37 is used fairly widely as a relay transmitter frequency.
* In Malaysia, NTV7 broadcasts in PAL on CCIR Channel 37 (599.25&amp;nbsp;MHz)

Channel 37 is not the same frequency as it is in the countries using the System-M/N standard. At least in the UK, 606–614&amp;nbsp;MHz is reserved for radio astronomy.

The UK's namesake "Channel 37", while different in frequency, was formerly part of a small group of channels reserved for non-broadcast purposes such as [[RF modulator]]s in video players.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tinsleyviaduct.com/phil/channel5.html five analogue reception issues] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406124750/http://www.tinsleyviaduct.com/phil/channel5.html |date=April 6, 2008 }}, tinsleyviaduct.com&lt;/ref&gt; The UK-named 34-37 channel range is no longer reserved in this manner.

In Japan, [[Television channel frequencies#Japan 2|UHF television channel frequencies]] are offset by one channel compared to North American channel naming convention. Japan's channel 36 is in use by [[TV Asahi]] in some regions.

== Global UHF TV allocation table (605–615 MHz) ==
This Radio Astronomy Allocation is between the following wavelengths:
* 605&amp;nbsp;MHz = 0.49552 m = 49.55&amp;nbsp;cm
* 615&amp;nbsp;MHz = 0.48747 m = 48.75&amp;nbsp;cm
* Assume either a 100&amp;nbsp;kHz or a 250&amp;nbsp;kHz guardband with respect to this allocation.

* ''No Allocation'' and ''Primary Status'' could be considered equivalent legal status. Very often the lack of allocation implies an internal regulatory coherence with ITU-R regulations freeing up this band for Astronomy.
* ''Assignment'' and ''Primary Status'' could be considered equivalent legal statuses as well.

'''Circuit Scribe''' is a ball-point pen containing silver [[conductive ink]] one can use to draw [[Electrical circuit|circuit]]s instantly on flexible [[substrate (materials science)|substrate]]s like paper. Circuit Scribe made its way onto [[Kickstarter]] (an online site where people can fund projects) on November 19, 2013 with its goal of raising $85,000 for the manufacturing of the first batch of pens. By December 31, 2013, Circuit Scribe was able to raise a total of $674,425 with 12,277 'backers' or donors.&lt;ref name=kickstarter&gt;{{cite web|title=Circuit Scribe: Draw Circuits Instantly|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/electroninks/circuit-scribe-draw-circuits-instantly|website=Kickstarter|publisher=Kickstarter|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to drawing a picture, users can use a Circuit Scribe pen to draw lines on a simple piece of paper. They can then attach special electrical components on the drawn lines which allows the electrical currents to run through the components. This replaces the use of breadboards and wires.

== Development ==
A team of researchers in [[Electroninks Incorporated]], a startup company located at [[Research Park]] of the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], created a water-based, non-toxic conductive ink that was noted as the Invention of the Month by [[Popular Science]].&lt;ref name=popsci&gt;{{cite web|title=Invention of the Month: Conductive Ink|url=http://www.popsci.com/diy/article/2012-03/invention-month-conductive-ink|website=Popular Science|publisher=Bonnier Corporation Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team began by developing a prototype using pens from a different company and replacing the ink with their special silver ink. Once completed, they started a Kickstarter campaign to earn funding for a mass production of the final form of the pens.

=== Team ===
The researching team consists of S. Brett Walker, [[Jennifer A. Lewis]], Michael Bell, Analisa Russo, and Nancy Beardsly.&lt;ref name=team&gt;{{cite web|title=The Team|url=http://www.electroninks.com/about/|website=Electroninks|publisher=Electroninks}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walker is the CEO of Electroninks and the co-founder along with Lewis, Bell, and the director of product development, Russo. Bell is also the chief operating officer while Beardsley is the technical support and user experience.

=== Prototype ===
The prototype pens are hand-cleaned [[Sakura Color Products Corporation|Sakura]] [[Gel pen|Gelly Roll Metallic]] pens. The ink is replaced with the researchers' silver conductive ink. In order to have the right amount of ink flow to make smooth lines, the ink is precisely tuned.

=== Ink ===
The ink is created by placing an aqueous solution of silver nitrate into a flask of water combined with [[polyacrylic acid]] (PAA) and [[diethanolamine]] (DEA), the capping agent and reducing agent, respectively. After about twenty hours, the silver nitrate is dissolved, forming particles with a diameter of about 5 nanometers. In order to enlarge the size of the particle to an average diameter of about 400 nanometers, the flask is placed on a heated [[sonicator]], a device that produces high-intensity ultrasound. Once cooled, the solution is poured into a larger flask and the thick [[precipitate]], an insoluble solid which is formed is scraped out. From there, [[ethanol]] is added to [[coagulate]] the particles, or change the particles to a solid state. Most of the [[supernatant]], the liquid lying above a layer of the precipitate, is then poured out so the remaining liquid can be [[centrifuged]], or separated. After the process of centrifugation, the particles are placed back in water and forced through a syringe filter to remove unnecessary particles in the solution. Next, [[hydroxyethyl cellulose]] (HEC) is added as a [[binder (material)|binder]] and the entire mixture is [[homogenized]]. The solvents are allowed to evaporate until the ink has a desired viscosity or thickness.&lt;ref name=popsci/&gt;

Once the ink is created, a roller ball pen is dismantled and cleaned so the ink can be placed inside using a flat tip [[spatula]]. After replacing the roller ball tip, a couple blasts of compressed air is shot from the back end to force the ink into the tip. The outer cover of the pen is replaced and the prototype of the Circuit Scribe is created. From there, the team launched its Kickstarter campaign.

=== Kickstarter Campaign ===
Circuit Scribe launched its campaign on Kickstarter to receive funding and included a list of pledges which people could donate a certain amount and get a corresponding gift:&lt;ref name=kickstarter/&gt;

== Modules ==
Circuit Scribe can be used to draw circuits that connect different types of modules, or individual components, such as:&lt;ref name=modules&gt;{{cite web|title=Circuit Scribe|url=https://123d.circuits.io/shop/circuitscribe#modules|website=123D Circuits|publisher=Autodesk, Inc|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Power ===
* USB Power Adapter: Allows user to power the drawn circuits with either a USB port or a wall outlet.
* [[9V Battery]] Adapter: Supplies a nine-volt power to the circuits.

=== Input ===
* [[Switch|SPST Switch]]: An on/off switch that allows users to control the electrical circuit.
* [[Switch|DPDT Switch]]: Two switches that direct the flow of current through the circuit.
* [[Light Sensor]]: Shines light on the phototransistor to control an output.
* [[Potentiometer]] 10k Ohm: A knob that controls the dimness, volume, and speed of circuit.

=== Connect ===
* 2-Pin Adapter: Allows user to connect resistors, capacitors, or sensors to circuits.
* [[Bipolar junction transistor|NPN Transistor]]: An electrical amplifier that converts small signals into large currents.
* Blinker: Blinks output components on and off at adjustable rates.
* DIY Boards: Allows user to solder 2, 4, 6, or 8 pin components to the board.
* [[Electrical connector|Connector Cables]]: Connects the paper circuit to DIY hardware platform.

=== Output ===
* [[Light-emitting diode|Bi-LED]]: Two LEDs in one that can flip directions to change the color. 
* Buzzer: Vibrates in response to the voltage.
* [[Electric motor|Motor]]: Rotates with an applied voltage.
* [[RGB LED]]: A red, blue, and green LED.

== Uses ==
The Circuit Scribe allows the user to draw electrical circuits in any shape with its silver ink. With this aspect and its ability to connect different types of modules, it is possible to produce simple designs like an [[Arduino]], an open-source electronic platform based on hardware and software.

=== Arduino ===
Circuit Scribe allows users to create a paper Arduino (or a ‘paperduino’), which is demonstrated by the research team. The team first found the schematics on the Arduino website and modified them so that they would work on a [[pen plotter]].&lt;ref name=arduino&gt;{{cite web|title=Paperduino 2.0 with Circuit Scribe|url=http://www.instructables.com/id/Paperduino-20-with-Circuit-Scribe/|website=Instructables|publisher=Autodesk, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a few modifications, they arranged the components and traces so that the board could be printed in a single layer. The alignments are set to 0.6 millimeters to match the width of the pen traces with a minimum distance of 0.1 millimeters. The pen plotter only prints lines and does not fill the patterns, so they designed large pads out of concentric circles and built up the pads for the components with some extra line features. This allows for a stronger conductivity. It is important to put chips close together to minimize the line resistance between them, but not so close that it's difficult to place the components. They used components from the 1206 package which are a bit larger than the original components from the Arduino. Before exporting the layout, they deselected every layer of the file except the top layer of traces. After exporting the file in .dxf format, both the wire width and the fill area options were deselected and the files were saved. Finally, the team measured the size of the board layout and dragged it onto a new sheet on [[Silhouette Studio]]. From there, the vertical height was adjusted to 2.945 inches and the speed was set to 1 in order to lay down the most amount of ink when printed. The team went on to place components like resistors, capacitors, and LEDs on the printed silver ink. Components can be attached using tweezers and super glue, but can be reinforced using conductive epoxy.

== Extras ==

=== Resistor Pen ===
As posted on their Kickstarter campaign, the creators of Circuit Scribe planned to develop resistor pens one can use to draw [[resistors]] the way one can use the Circuit Scribe to draw circuits. Although their stretch goal of $1,000,000 was not met by the deadline on the campaign, the team still managed to create them.

[[File:Thomas Eakins, American - Portrait of Dr. Samuel D. Gross (The Gross Clinic) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''The Gross Clinic'' (1875), 240 cm × 200 cm (8 ft × 6.5 ft), oil on canvas]]

The '''conservation-restoration of Thomas Eakins' ''The Gross Clinic''''' refers to the on-going [[conservation-restoration]] treatments of American painter [[Thomas Eakins]]' 1875 painting ''[[The Gross Clinic]]'' throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. These treatments are a testament to the changing methodologies undertaken in the field of [[Conservation and restoration of paintings|paintings conservation]].

The painting portrays surgeon Dr. [[Samuel D. Gross]] performing a surgical debridement on a boy with [[osteomyelitis]] of the [[femur]] for an audience of students in his clinic at [[Jefferson Medical College]].

The painting was subject to several conservation-restoration treatments both prior to Eakins' death and in the decades following, which altered both the structural integrity of the painting as well as its surface composition. Emergency treatment was undertaken in 1960 and 1961 by Theodor Siegel, [[Paintings conservator|conservator]] at the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]], to correct damage from previous restorations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Siegl|first=Theodor|date=Winter 1962|title=The Conservation of the "Gross Clinic"|url=|journal=Philadelphia Museum of Art Bulletin|volume= 57|pages=39–62|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent treatment was performed in 2010 by conservators at the Philadelphia Museum of Art to correct problems resulting from the 1961 restoration as well as the previous restorations.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=An Eakins masterpiece restored : seeing The Gross Clinic anew|last=Foster|first=Kathleen A.|date=|publisher=Philadelphia Museum of Art in association with Yale University Press|others=Tucker, Mark S.|year=2012|isbn=9780300179798|location=Philadelphia, PA|pages=|oclc=830662602}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
''[[The Gross Clinic]]'' portrays surgeon [[Samuel D. Gross|Dr. Samuel D. Gross]], the first chief of surgery at [[Jefferson Medical College]], performing surgery on a young man for [[osteomyelitis]] of the [[femur]] in the surgical amphitheater on the top floor of Jefferson's Ely Building in the company of multiple doctors and medical students. Chief of Clinic Dr. James M. Barton can be seen standing over the patient, probing the [[Surgical incision|incision]]. Junior assistant Dr. Charles S. Briggs, seen below Gross, is holding the patient's legs while Dr. Daniel M. Appel, seen bottom right, uses a retractor to hold open the incision. The anesthetist, Dr. W. Joseph Hearn, sits at the head of the operating table, holding a chloroform soaked rag over the patient's face. The clinic's clerk, Dr. Franklin West, records the surgery at a desk behind Gross. Gross' son Dr. Samuel W. Gross and orderly Hughey O'Donnell can be seen standing in the hall leading out of the amphitheater. A woman, possibly the patient's mother, can be seen recoiling at the bottom right. A self-portrait of [[Thomas Eakins|Eakins]] himself can be seen on the right side of the painting, in the front of the theater, taking notes.

== History ==
Work on the painting likely began sometime in April 1875, as evidenced by a letter from Eakins to his friend [[Earl Shinn]] in which he declares, "What elates me more is that I have just got a new picture blocked in and it is very far better than anything I have ever done."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Work on the painting continued throughout summer of 1875, with Eakins holding multiple sessions with Dr. Gross at his home at 1729 Mount Vernon St. to produce studies for the final work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The work was likely finished by Christmas of 1875, evidenced by the gift of a portrait sketch of author and friend Robert C.V. Meyers, who modeled for the painting.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Eakins submitted the painting for display at Memorial Hall during the 1876 [[Centennial Exhibition]] in [[Philadelphia]], but was rejected by Selecting Committee, who claimed there was inadequate space to display the painting. However, it was suggested by a correspondent of New York's ''Medical Record'' and by William Clark in the ''Philadelphia Evening Telegraph'' that the painting's graphic nature caused several members of the jury to feel faint.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doyle|first=Jennifer|date=1999-10-01|title=Sex, Scandal, and Thomas Eakins's The Gross Clinic|url=http://rep.ucpress.edu/content/68/1|journal=Representations|language=en|volume=68|pages=1–33|doi=10.2307/2902953|issn=0734-6018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was instead displayed at the model ward of the U.S. Army Post Hospital, a replica created for the Centennial.

In February 1878 the painting was purchased by Alumni Association of Jefferson Medical College for $200.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Acquisition by The Philadelphia Museum of Art and Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts ===
On November 11, 2006 it was announced that the board of [[Thomas Jefferson University]] (formerly Jefferson Medical College) voted to sell the painting to the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, D.C. and to [[Walmart|Wal-Mart]] heiress [[Alice Walton|Alice Walton's]] planned [[Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art]] in Bentonville, Arkansas for a record $68 million.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Due to the painting's connections to [[Philadelphia]], portraying Philadelphians painted in a Philadelphia college by a Philadelphia painter, the announcement of the impending sale caused an uproar.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/11/arts/design/11pain.html|title=Eakins Masterwork Is to Be Sold to Museums|last=Vogel|first=Carol|date=2006-11-11|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-08|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anne d'Harnoncourt|Anne d’Harnoncourt]], director of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, remarked that “It’s a painting that really belongs in Philadelphia — his presence still resonates here.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Protests against the sale held in November and December 2006 were organized by Philadelphia artists Stanley Bielen, Charles Cushing, and Patrick Connors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Philadelphia mayor [[John F.

== Conservation-restoration treatments ==

=== 1915 ===
The first recorded conservation-restoration treatment to ''[[The Gross Clinic]]'' took place sometime in 1915 by restorer T. H. Stevenson at the behest of [[Jefferson Medical College]]. The canvas on which ''[[The Gross Clinic]]'' was painted had become weak and brittle and was lined with a new piece of linen. A 1916 issue of ''The Jeffersonian'' noted that Stevenson cleaned and treated the painting.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== 1917-1925 ===
At some point between 1917 and 1925 a treatment of the painting took place that dramatically altered the composition of the painting.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is not known who worked on the painting or when. A comparison of a photograph of the painting taken in October 1917 for the ''Loan Exhibition of the Works of Thomas Eakins'' at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] and a reproduction of the painting that appeared as the frontispiece of Jefferson Medical College's 1925 yearbook show major differences in the relative tones of the painting, indicating a major restoration in which paint was removed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The hall leading out of the amphitheater was considerably lighter; Dr. Samuel W. Gross and orderly Hughey O'Donnell originally appeared lighter than the background.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The majority of the painting now had a considerably redder tone.

Thomas Eakins' widow, [[Susan Macdowell Eakins]], upon seeing the 1925 reproduction and thinking the changes had been made for the reproduction rather than to the painting itself, strongly objected to its release. A letter from Eakins to Jefferson Medical College Dean Ross V. Patterson details her frustrations:&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.philamuseum.org/conservation/14.html|title=Philadelphia Museum of Art - Research:Conservation: Thomas Eakins's The Gross Clinic|last=Philadelphia Museum of Art|first=|date=2010|website=www.philamuseum.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1940 ===
The next recorded treatment of the painting took place in 1940 was by Philadelphia restorer Hannah Mee Horner, at the behest of Jefferson Medical College. Hearing of the college's plans for restoring the painting, Eakins' student [[Charles Bregler]],who frequently treated multiple Eakins paintings at [[Susan Macdowell Eakins|Susan Eakins]] request, attempted to intervene but was rebuffed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Horner removed the linen lining attached by Stevenson in 1915 and replaced it with two, 4 by 6 1/2 foot pieces of [[plywood]] which were butted in the center and nailed to a wooden framework. The painting was then attached using carpenter's glue.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Records also indicate that Horner also cleaned and restored the painting.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== 1960-1961 ===
The results of the 1940 treatment proved to be disastrous and put the painting in serious need of new treatment. In the spring of 1960 conservator Theodor Siegl of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the first with professional training and credentials to treat the painting, cleaned and restored the painting at Jefferson's request. Varnish, applied by Horner, had become yellowed and darkened while a significant accumulations of grime also built up on the surface. Siegl used a combination of solvents to remove the grime and varnish, removed build up of filling putty used by previous restorers, and retouched areas that had been torn or distorted.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Siegl finally applied a layer of varnish and made minor retouchings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1961 Jefferson again requested Siegl examine the painting prior to its inclusion in an Eakins retrospective that would travel from the [[National Gallery of Art]] to the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] and finally end in [[Philadelphia Museum of Art|Philadelphia]]. Siegl realized that the structure of the painting was in extreme danger from Horner's 1940 treatment. The plywood attached to the back of the painting had begun to warp, creating a crease in the middle of the painting which could have torn it in half. The nails in the plywood also began to move forward, creating bumps in the painting.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Siegl's conservation-restoration of the painting moved forward in the summer of 1961. Due to the paintings large size, no table in the conservation department could accommodate the painting, thus a custom working platform with a built in thermostat was created.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; To protect the painting in the course of removing the plywood the surface of the painting was covered with tissue paper and strips of [[muslin]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The framework was the first part of the 1940 treatment to be removed, revealing over 500 nails which had been causing a large portion of the damage to the painting's surface. A [[Plane (tool)|planer]], attached to an electric power saw, was used to remove most of the plywood, with the remainder being removed by hand.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The carpenter's glue used in the 1940 was then removed. A new linen lining was attached to the canvas, which was then attached to a new stretcher framework. A new, easily removable varnish was used on the painting's surface.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== 2010 ===
[[File:Gross clinic bw.jpg|thumb|1875-1876 India ink and watercolor reproduction by Thomas Eakins.]]
Following the purchase of ''The Gross Clinic'' by the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 2007 and after considerable research and discussion, the decision was made to conserve and restore the painting once more. The ultimate goal of the treatment was to both correct damage done by earlier treatments and restore the tones of the paint to reflect Eakins original intentions, which was made possible my extensive research on Eakins technique not available to earlier conservators.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This treatment was performed by [[Conservator-restorer|conservators]] Mark Tucker, Allen Kosanovich, and Terry Lignelli.

The first step concerned the removal of the varnish applied by Siegl in 1961, a [[synthetic resin]] called poly(n-butyl methacrylate), which was prone to discoloration and loss of [[solubility]], making it more difficult to remove as time went on. Taking place over the course of several weeks, the removal of this varnish allowed conservators to view what was left of Eakins original paint and what had been retouched by earlier treatments.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A new, [[Synthetic resin|synthetic resin varnish]], MS2A, was applied to the surface which both evenly saturated the colors of the painting while isolating the original paint from the retouching, should it need to be removed in the future.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A 1875-1876 [[india ink]] and [[Watercolor painting|watercolor]] reproduction created by Eakins, the 1917 photograph, and 1925 reproduction were used as a guide for conservators to retouch the painting. The conservators used paints made of lightfast pigments ground in a colorless synthetic resin to retouch the painting.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Smaller areas where paint had been flaked away were the first priority, followed by areas where large swaths of colors and tones had been altered. The area of the amphitheater's opening, in which a dark glaze had been removed, was restored to more closely resemble the small amounts of dark paint that remained as well as the 1917 photograph. Details of the many characters in the painting had been obscured due to earlier aggressive cleanings.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The faces of orderly Hughey O'Donnell, Dr. Gross' son Dr. Samuel W. Gross, and Eakins were all restored to their original detail seen in the 1917 photograph.

Following the completion of the treatment an exhibition, ''An Eakins Masterpiece Restored: Seeing The Gross Clinic Anew'', was held between July 23, 2010 and January 9, 2011 at the Philadelphia Museum of Art.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128721065|title=Eakins' Classic 'Gross Clinic' Gets Another Look|last=Rose|first=Joel|date=July 25, 2010|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-03-30|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/19/arts/design/19eakins.html|title=A Restored ‘Gross Clinic’ at Philadelphia Museum|last=Kennedy|first=Randy|date=2010-07-18|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discoveries ==
The use of [[Radiography of cultural objects|x-radiography]] and [[infrared reflectography]] prior to the 2010 treatment revealed a wealth of information about Eakins' technique and the creation of ''The Gross Clinic''.

=== Eakins' Technique ===
An x-radiograph of the painting revealed a heavy build-up of paint behind the heads of the principal characters. Rather than building upon dark areas with light paint, as was the convention at the time of the paintings creation, the x-radiograph revealed that Eakins instead built on light areas with dark paint.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The characters featured in the periphery of the painting were not significantly built up in this fashion and were instead painted thinly.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Thomas Eakins|last=Sewell|first=Darrel|date=|publisher=Philadelphia Museum of Art|others=Foster, Kathleen A.|year=2001|isbn=9780300091113|location=Philadelphia, PA|pages=353–365|oclc=47785680}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Composition of ''The Gross Clinic'' ===
[[File:Composition study for the portrait of professor gross thomas eakins.jpeg|left|thumb|Sketch for ''The Gross Clinic'']]
Significant changes in the composition of the painting before the final image were revealed using [[Radiography of cultural objects|x-radiography]]. The probe in the hands of Dr. James Barton was initially longer but shortened in the final composition. The clinic's clerk, Dr. Franklin West, was initially seen taking his notes at a lower position but was moved up for the final composition. Dr. Daniel M. Appel, seen bottom right, is shown in the sketch looking more to the right but in the final composition looking more to the left, showing more of his profile. In the final composition his arm was also moved slightly down, showing the patient's buttocks. X-radiography also revealed an initial stripe across the bottom of the painting, likely intended to serve as the wall circling the seats of the amphitheater, which was replaced with a view under the surgeon's table in the final composition.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== An Eakins Masterpiece Restored: Seeing ''The Gross Clinic'' Anew ==
Following the completion of the 2010 conservation treatment, the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] opened the exhibition "An Eakins Masterpiece Restored: Seeing ''The Gross Clinic'' Anew", which ran from July 3, 2010 to January 9, 2011. The theme of the exhibition was "Then and Now", an homage to the famed and nearly two hour long lecture by [[Samuel D. Gross|Dr. Samuel D. Gross]], ''Then and Now: Advances in Medical Science in the Past Forty Years: a Discourse Introductory to the Forty-third Course of Lectures in the Jefferson Medical College of Philadelphia''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Autobiography of Samuel D.

The communicative constitution of organizations (CCO) perspective is broadly characterized by the claim that communication is not something that happens within organizations or between organizational members; instead, communication is the process whereby organizations are constituted. Specifically, this view contends: “organization is an effect of communication not its predecessor." &lt;ref name="Blaschke2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lou.econ.uni-hamburg.de/tag/communication-as-constitutive/|title=Building Blocks of Postmodern Organizational Communication|last=Blaschke|first=Steffen|date=13 November 2009|publisher=Universitat Hamburg|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112042548/http://lou.econ.uni-hamburg.de/tag/communication-as-constitutive/|archivedate=12 January 2015|deadurl=yes|accessdate=19 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This perspective is part of a broader constitutive view of communication arguing, "elements of communication, rather than being fixed in advance, are reflexively constituted within the act of communication itself".&lt;ref name="Craig"&gt;{{cite web|last=Craig|first=Robert T.|title=Communication|url=http://spot.colorado.edu/~craigr/Communication.htm|work=Encyclopedia of Rhetoric|date=3 September 2000|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111220030311/http://spot.colorado.edu/~craigr/Communication.htm|archivedate=20 December 2011|deadurl=yes|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=21 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background of the perspective==

The model of communication as constitutive of organizations has origins in the linguistic approach to organizational communication taken in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Blaschke"&gt;{{cite web|last=Blaschke|first=Steffen|url=http://lou.econ.uni-hamburg.de/tag/communication-as-constitutive/|title=Building Blocks of Postmodern Organizational Communication|publisher=Universitat Hamburg|date=13 November 2009|accessdate=19 March 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112042548/http://lou.econ.uni-hamburg.de/tag/communication-as-constitutive/|archivedate=12 January 2015|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theorists such as [[Karl E. Weick]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weick|first=Karl|title=The social psychology of organizing|year=1979|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Reading, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt; were among the first to posit that organizations were not static but inherently comprised by a dynamic process of communicating.

The notion of a communicative constitution of organization comprises three schools of thought:&lt;ref name="Schools"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schoeneborn|first=Dennis|author2=Steffen Blaschke|title=The Three Schools of CCO Thinking:Interactive Dialogue and Systematic Comparison.|journal=Management Communication Quarterly|volume=28|issue=2|year=2014|pages=285–316|url=http://mcq.sagepub.com/content/28/2/285.abstract|doi=10.1177/0893318914527000}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1) The Montréal School, (2) the McPhee's Four Flows based on Gidden's [[Structuration theory|Structuration Theory]], and (3), Luhmann's Theory of [[Social system|Social Systems]].

==McPhee &amp; Zaug's Four Flows==

In their seminal 2000 article, which was republished in 2009 &lt;ref name="McPheeZaug-21-45"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McPhee|first=Robert D|author2=Pamela Zaug|title=The communicative constitution of organizations: A framework for explanation|journal=Building Theories of Organization: The Constitutive Role of Communication.|year=2000|pages=21–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Communicative Constitution of Organizations: A Framework for Explanation'', Robert D. McPhee and Pamela Zaug distinguish four types of communicative flows generate a social structure through interaction. The flows, though distinct, can affect one another in the model and lead to multi-way conversation or texts typically involving reproduction of as well as resistance to the rules and resources of the organization.

[[File:ConstitutiveRoleofComm.jpg|thumb|Model of the four flows or interaction processes which constitute an organization.]]

=== Organizational self-structuring ===

Reflexive self-structuring separates organizations from other groupings such as a [[crowd]] or mob. The self-structuring process is deliberately carried out through communication among role-holders and groups. Communication regarding self-structuring is recursive and [[dialogic]] in nature. It concerns the control, design, and documentation of an organization's relations, [[Norm (social)|norms]], processes, and entities. Communication of formal structure predetermines work routines rather than allowing them to emerge and controls the collaboration and membership-negotiation processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McPhee|first=Robert|title=Organizational communication: Traditional themes and new directions|year=1985|publisher=Sage|location=Beverly Hills, CA|pages=149–178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physical examples of organizational self-structuring include a [[charter]], [[organizational chart]], and policy [[Business and company operating manual|manual]].

Organizational self-structuring is a political, subjective process that can be affected by systems, individuals, interests, and traditions in which it takes place.&lt;ref name="McPheeZaug-1-16"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McPhee|first=Robert D|author2=Pamela Zaug|year=2000|title=The communicative constitution of organizations: A framework for explanation|url=http://www.cios.org/EJCPUBLIC/010/1/01017.html|journal=Electronic Journal of Communication/La Revue Electronique de Communication.|volume=10|issue=1-2|pages=1–16}} Reprinted in: {{cite book|title=Building Theories of Organization: The Constitutive Role of Communication.|last=Putnam|first=Linda L|author2=Anne M Nicotera|publisher=Routledge|year=2009|isbn=978-0805847109|location=New York|pages=21–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not necessarily free of error or ambiguity. To constitute an organization, the communication must imply the formation and governance of a differentiated whole with its own reflexive response cycle and mechanisms.

=== Membership negotiation ===

Organizations are necessarily composed of, yet are distinct from, individual members. Because humans are not inherently members of organizations, negotiatory communication must occur to incorporate them. Membership negotiation links an [[organization]] to its members by establishing and maintaining relationships. Practices in membership negotiation include job [[recruitment]] and socialization.&lt;ref name="McPheeZaug-1-16" /&gt; In recruitment, potential members are evaluated, both parties must agree to a relationship, and the member must be incorporated into the structure of the organization. The negotiation process can be influenced by powers including prior existence and supervision, and all parties involved may redefine themselves to fit expectations. Among higher status members, power-claiming and spokesmanship are examples of negotiation processes to gain resources of an organization.

=== Activity coordination ===

Activity coordination is a result of the fact that organizations inherently have at least one purpose to which the members' activity is contributing. Often an organization's self-structuring defines the division of labor, work flow sequences, policies, etc. that set the course for activity coordination. The structure is reflexively changing and may not be complete, relevant, fully understood, or free of problems. Therefore, a necessity of communication arises among members to amend and adjust the work process. Activity coordination can include adjusting the work process and resolving immediate or unforeseen practical problems.

Activity coordination operates on the assumption that members are working in an interdependent social unit beyond the work tasks themselves. It incorporates any processes and attitudes and therefore includes coordination for members to not complete work or to seek power over one another. The work of [[Henry Mintzberg|Dr. Henry Mintzberg]] exemplifies activity coordination in the mechanism of mutual adjustment in his theory of organizational forms. In this example, co-workers informally coordinate work arounds for issues on the job.

=== Institutional positioning ===

Institutional positioning links the organization to the environment outside the organization at a macro level. Examples of entities outside the organization include suppliers, customers, and competitors. Communication outside the organization negotiates terms of recognition of the organization’s existence and place in what is called "identity negotiation" or "positioning".&lt;ref name="McPheeZaug-1-16" /&gt; Often the communicators of this message are individuals who concurrently negotiate their own relationships but messages can come from the greater organization as a whole.

Though there is not one configuration that an organization must embody, in order to be considered by peer institutions, the minimum process involves negotiating inclusion in the environment. Organizations must establish and maintain a presence, image, status, and a two-way communication channel with partners. Objects such as organizational charts can assert a particular image and demonstrate legitimacy. Organizations which are marginalized due to their lack of institutional positioning include [[startup companies]] and illegal groups such as [[the Mafia]]. Generally, the more secure an organization, the stronger relationships and control over uncertainty and resources it has in its environment. Pre-existing institutional ([[corporations]], agencies), political, legal, cultural, etc. structures allow for easier constitution of complex organizations.

== The Montréal School ==
One of the most distinctive stances of the Montreal School approach, birthed in the Universite de Montreal by James Taylor, Francois Cooren (see particularly Cooren, 2004), and Bruno Latour amongst others, is that texts have agency. Texts do something to humans that is not reducible to certain human interactions and human actions.&lt;ref&gt;Cooren, F. (2004). Textual Agency: How Texts Do Tings in Organizational Settings. Organization, 11, pp. 373-393. DOI 10.1177/1350508404041998&lt;/ref&gt;

The Montreal flavor of CCO is exemplified by Taylor et al. (1996) &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Taylor, J. R., Cooren, F., Giroux, N., &amp; Robichaud, D. (1996). The communicational basis of organization: Between the conversation and the text. Communication theory, 6(1), 1-39.&lt;/ref&gt; and the volume edited by Cooren, Taylor, and Van Emery (2006).&lt;ref&gt;Cooren F., Taylor J. R., Van Emery E. J. (2006). Communication as organizing: Empirical and theoretical exploration in the dynamic of text and conversation. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; The Montréal school foregrounds process of coorientation, or the orientation of two individuals to one another, and the object of conversation. Cooren, Kuhn, Cornelissen, and Clark (2011) &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Cooren F., Kuhn T., Cornelissen J. P., Clark T. (2011). Communication, organizing, and organization: An overview and introduction to the special issue. Organization Studies, 32, 1149-1170.&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that coorientation occurs when individuals focus on each other and the multitudes of agencies within the organizational environment. Cooren et al. (2011), the current leading voice in the Montréal school, suggests that Greimas language theory (described by Cooren &amp; Taylor, 2006 as almost incomprehensible) and Latour’s (1995, 2005) Actor Network Theory are the basis of the Montréal school’s thinking. Taylor and Van Every (2001) rely on Austin’s (1962) and Searle’s (1975) Speech Act Theory.

Two central terms to the Montréal school are derived from Austin’s work on language: text and conversation. The text represents big ‘D’ Discourse in the organization, or the way people talk, while conversation represents the messages exchanged between two parties that solidify into text. In this way, Taylor et al. (1996) claim that organizations are not real in the material sense; instead, organizations are a culmination of conversations and texts. Further, Taylor et al. (1996) suggest that organizations always speak through an agent. Over the course of time, distanciation, or solidification of various texts lead to what laypeople refer to as the organization, occurs.

Taylor et al. (1996) propose several degrees of separation between text and conversation. First, text is translated into action through the ability of communication to carry intention. Second, conversation turns into a narrative representation as interlocutors agree on meaning. Third, text is translating into (semi)permanent medium; for example, we write down regulations in an employee handbook. Such medium permits storage of texts to help them become conversation. Fourth, these media specialize the language as professionalism. Fifth, physical and material structures are created by the organization to perpetuate conversation. Finally, publication, dissemination, diffusion, and other forms of broadcast are employed to convey the message created by members of the organization. Through this CCO process, the social arrangements of the workplace become codified. The Montréal school’s proponents contend that the essence of organizing is captured in the submission, imbrication, and embeddedness of text and conversation (Schoeneborn et al., 2014).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Schoeneborn, D., Blaschke, S., Cooren, F., McPhee, R. D., Seidl, D., &amp; Taylor, J. R. (2014). The three schools of CCO thinking: Interactive dialogue and systematic comparison. Management Communication Quarterly, 28(2), 285-316.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other key terms are related with the Montréal school: coorientation (Taylor, 2009),&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, James R.

Coorientation, as described above is an A-B-X relationship between two actors and an object; the object can be psychological, physical, or social. A plenum of agencies refers to the potential of both human and non-human actants (a term borrowed from Actor Network Theory; Latour, 1995) to interact within the organizational environment. Closure is the punctuation of conversations to provide deeper understanding by interlocutors. Hybridity refers to human and nonhuman actants working together to co-orient a claim. Imbrication refers to the emerging structures created by discourse in the organization over time that become an unquestioned part of what we call the organization. Finally, ventriloquism is the study of how interacts (both human and non-human) position and are positioned by the need to act via different values, principles, interests, norms, experiences, and other structures.

== Luhmann's Social Systems ==
Luhmann's systems theory focuses on three topics, which are interconnected in his entire work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schoeneborn|first=Dennis|date=2011-05-19|title=Organization as Communication|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0893318911405622|journal=Management Communication Quarterly|language=en|volume=25|issue=4|pages=663–689|doi=10.1177/0893318911405622|issn=0893-3189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Systems theory as societal theory
# Communication theory and
# Evolution theory
 
The core element of Luhmann's theory is communication. Social systems are systems of communication, and society is the most encompassing social system. Being the social system that comprises all (and only) communication, today's society is a world society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A system is defined by a boundary between itself and its environment, dividing it from an infinitely complex, or (colloquially) chaotic, exterior. The interior of the system is thus a zone of reduced complexity: Communication within a system operates by selecting only a limited amount of all information available outside. This process is also called "reduction of complexity". The criterion according to which information is selected and processed is meaning (in German, Sinn). Both social systems and psychical or personal systems (see below for an explanation of this distinction) operate by processing meaning.

The third strand of CCO was first acknowledged by Taylor (1995)&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, L. L., Phillips, N., &amp; Chapman, P. (1996). Metaphors of communication and organizations. In S. R. Clegg, &amp; W. R. Nord (Eds''.'')'', Handbook of organization studies'' (pp. 375-408). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage. &lt;/ref&gt; but has only recently been included as a strand of CCO theorizing&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. Luhmann (1995)&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann, N. (1995). ''Social systems''. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press. &lt;/ref&gt; claims that individuals do not create meaning, instead all meaning comes from social systems. Perhaps this is why Luhmann’s general system perspective has only recently been considered a part of the CCO body of scholarship.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Luhmann takes care to define communication as a tripartite conceptualization of interactive forces. Specifically, Seidl (2014)&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; explains that Luhmann suggests communication is an amalgam of information, utterance, and understanding. Whereas information is what is contained in a message, utterance is how the communication is conducted, and understanding “refers to the distinction between information and utterance” (p.&amp;nbsp;290). Luhmann’s perspective is a radical departure from traditional communication scholarship. Putnam and Fairhurst (2015)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Putnam|first=Linda L.|last2=Fairhurst|first2=Gail T.|date=2015-10-21|title=Revisiting “Organizations as Discursive Constructions”: 10 Years Later|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/comt.12074|journal=Communication Theory|language=en|volume=25|issue=4|pages=375–392|doi=10.1111/comt.12074|issn=1050-3293}}&lt;/ref&gt; explain that the Luhmannian perspective is wholly communicative; that is, meaning is complete up to utterances in a given communicative interaction.

Luhmann’s perspective gives less value to human agency in favor of a social agentic perspective. For this reason, Seidl claims that CCO research using Luhmann’s version should focus on communication not on actors.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Human agency is minimized by this perspective. Psychic systems (i.e., the mind) interact with social systems (i.e., an organic conglomerate of multiple psychic systems) and human actors are not relevant to the constitution of organizations.&lt;ref name="Schools" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13931">[[Epigenetics]] is a broad term that refers to changes in [[gene expression]] that occur via mechanisms such as [[DNA methylation]], [[histone acetylation]], and [[microRNA]] modification. When these epigenetics changes are [[Heritability|heritable]], they can influence [[evolution]].  Current research indicates that epigenetics has influenced evolution in a number of [[organism]]s, including [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Suter CM, Boffelli D, Martin DIK. 2013 [http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/280/1771/20130903.full A role for epigenetic inheritance in modern evolutionary theory? A comment in response to Dickins and Rahman]. Proc R Soc B 280: 20130903. doi: 10.1098/rspb.2013.0903&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Plants ==
=== Overview ===
DNA methylation and histone modification are two mechanisms used to regulate gene expression in plants. DNA methylation can be mitotically and meiotically stable, allowing for methylation states to be passed to other orthologous genes in a genome. DNA methylation can be reversed via the use of enzymes known as DNA de-methylases, while histone modiciations can be reversed via removing histone acetyl groups with deacetylases. Interspecific differences due to environmental factors are shown to be associated with the difference between [[annual plant|annual]] and [[perennial]] life cycles. There can be varying adaptive responses based on this.&lt;ref&gt;Turck F, Coupland G.: [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/evo.12286/abstract Natural variation in epigenetic gene regulation and its effects on plant developmental traits]. ''[[Evolution (journal)|Evolution]]''. 2013 Oct 7. {{doi|10.1111/evo.12286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arabidopsis thaliana ===
Forms of [[histone methylation]] cause repression of certain genes that are stably inherited through mitosis but that can also be erased during meiosis or with the progression of time. The induction of [[flowering]] by exposure to low winter temperatures in [[Arabidopsis thaliana]] shows this effect. Histone methylation participates in repression of expression of an inhibitor of flowering during cold. In annual, [[semelparous]] species such as Arabidopsis thaliana, this histone methylation is stably inherited through mitosis after return from cold to warm temperatures giving the plant the opportunity to flower continuously during spring and summer until it senesces. However, in perennial, [[iteroparous]] relatives the histone modification rapidly disappears when temperatures rise, allowing expression of the floral inhibitor to increase and limiting flowering to a short interval. Epigenetic histone modifications control a key adaptive trait in Arabidopsis thaliana, and their pattern changes rapidly during evolution associated with reproductive strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Turck F, Coupland G.: [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/evo.12286/abstract Natural variation in epigenetic gene regulation and its effects on plant developmental traits]. Evolution. 2013 Oct 7. doi: 10.1111/evo.12286&lt;/ref&gt;
Another study tested several epigenetic recombinant inbred lines (epiRILs) of Arabidopsis thaliana - lines with similar genomes but varying levels of DNA methylation - for their drought sensitivity and their sensitivity to nutritional stress. It was found that there was a significant amount of heritable variation in the lines in regards to traits important for survival of drought and nutrient stress. This study proved that variation in DNA methylation can result in heritable variation of ecologically important plant traits, such as root allocation, [[drought tolerance]], and nutrient [[Phenotypic plasticity|plasticity]]. It also hinted that epigenetic variation alone could result in rapid evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, Y.-Y., Fischer, M., Colot, V. and Bossdorf, O. (2013), [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.12010/abstract Epigenetic variation creates potential for evolution of plant phenotypic plasticity]. New Phytologist, 197: 314–322. doi: 10.1111/nph.12010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dandelions ===

Scientists found that changes in DNA methylation induced by stress was inherited in [[asexual reproduction|asexual]] [[dandelions]]. Genetically similar plants were exposed to different ecological stresses, and their offspring were raised in an unstressed environment. Amplified fragment-length polymorphism markers that were methylation-sensitive were used to test for methylation on a genome-wide scale. It was found that many of the environmental stresses caused induction of pathogen and herbivore defenses, which caused methylation in the genome. These modifications were then genetically transmitted to the offspring dandelions. The transgenerational inheritance of a stress response can contribute to the heritable plasticity of the organism, allowing it to better survive environmental stresses. It also helps add to the [[genetic variation]] of specific lineages with little variability, giving a greater chance of [[reproductive success]].&lt;ref&gt;Koen J. F. Verhoeven, Jeroen J. Jansen, Peter J. van Dijk and Arjen Biere.

New Phytologist(2010) 185: 1108–1118. doi: 10.1111/j.1469-8137.2009.03121.x&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Animals ==

=== Primates ===

A comparative analysis of [[CpG site|CpG]] methylation patterns between humans and primates found that there were more than 800 genes that varied in their methylation patterns among orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, and bonobos. Despite these apes having the same genes, methylation differences are what account for their [[phenotypic variation]]. The genes in question are involved in development. It is not the protein sequences that account for the differences in physical characteristics between humans and apes; rather, it is the epigenetic changes to the genes. Since humans and the great apes share 99% of their DNA, it is thought that the differences in methylation patterns account for their distinction. So far, there are known to be 171 genes that are uniquely methylated in humans, 101 genes that are uniquely methylated in chimpanzees and bonobos, 101 genes that are uniquely methylated in gorillas, and 450 genes that are uniquely methylated in orangutans. For example, genes involved in blood pressure regulation and the development of the inner ear’s semicircular canal are highly methylated in humans, but not in the apes. There are also 184 genes that are conserved at the protein level between human and chimpanzees, but have epigenetic differences. Enrichments in multiple independent gene categories show that regulatory changes to these genes have given humans their specific traits. This research shows that epigenetics plays an important role in evolution in primates.&lt;ref&gt;Hernando-Herraez I, Prado-Martinez J, Garg P, Fernandez-Callejo M, Heyn H, et al. (2013) [http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1003763 Dynamics of DNA Methylation in Recent Human and Great Ape Evolution]. PLoS Genet 9(9): e1003763. doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1003763&lt;/ref&gt;
It has also been shown that cis-regulatory elements changes affect the transcription start sites (TSS) of genes. 471 DNA sequences are found to be enriched or depleted in regards to histone trimethylation at the H3K4 histone in chimpanzee, human, and macaque prefrontal cortexes. Among these sequences, 33 are selectively methylated in neuronal [[chromatin]] from children and adults, but not from non-neuronal chromatin. One [[Locus (genetics)|locus]] that was selectively methylated was [[DPP10]], a [[regulatory sequence]] that showed evidence of hominid adaptation, such as higher [[nucleotide substitution]] rates and certain regulatory sequences that were missing in other primates. Epigenetic regulation of TSS chromatin has been identified as an important development in the evolution of gene expression networks in the human brain. These networks are thought to play a role in [[cognitive processes]] and [[neurological disorders]].&lt;ref&gt;Shulha HP, Crisci JL, Reshetov D, Tushir JS, Cheung I, et al. (2012) [http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001427 Human-Specific Histone Methylation Signatures at Transcription Start Sites in Prefrontal Neurons]. PLoS Biol 10(11): e1001427. doi: 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001427&lt;/ref&gt;
An analysis of methylation profiles of humans and primate [[sperm cells]] reveals epigenetic regulation plays an important role here as well. Since mammalian cells undergo reprogramming of DNA methylation patterns during [[germ cell]] development, the methylomes of human and chimp sperm can be compared to methylation in [[embryonic stem cells]] (ESCs). There were many hypomethylated regions in both sperms cells and ESCs that showed structural differences. Also, many of the [[promoter (genetics)|promoter]]s in human and chimp sperm cells had different amounts of methylation. In essence, DNA methylation patterns differ between germ cells and [[somatic cells]] as well as between the human and chimpanzee sperm cells. Meaning, differences in promoter methylation could possible account for the phenotypic differences between humans and primates.&lt;ref&gt;Molaro A, Hodges E, Fang F, Song Q, McCombie WR, et al. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867411009421 Sperm methylation profiles reveal features of epigenetic inheritance and evolution in primates]. Cell. 2011;146:1029–41. doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2011.08.016&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chickens ===

Red Junglefowl, ancestor of domestic chickens, show that gene expression and methylation profiles in the [[thalamus]] and [[hypothalamus]] differed significantly from that of a domesticated egg laying breed. Methylation differences and gene expression were maintained in the offspring, depicting that epigenetic variation is inherited. Some of the inherited methylation differences were specific to certain tissues, and the differential methylation at specific loci were not altered much after intercrossing between Red Junglefowl and domesticated laying hens for eight generations.The results hint that domestication has led to epigenetic changes, as domesticated chickens maintained a higher level of methylation for more than 70% of the genes.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Natt, Carl-Johan Rubin, Dominic Wright, Martin Johnsson, Johan Belteky, Leif Andersson, Per Jensen. [http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/13/59 Heritable genome-wide variation of gene expression and promoter methylation between wild and domesticated chickens]. BMC Genomics, 2012; 13 (1): 59 DOI: 10.1186/1471-2164-13-59&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role in Evolution ==

The role of epigenetics in evolution is clearly linked to the selective pressures that regulate that process. As organisms leave offspring that are best suited to their environment, environmental stresses change DNA gene expression that are further passed down to their offspring, allowing for them also to better thrive in their environment. The classic case study of the rats who experience licking and grooming from their mothers pass this trait to their offspring shows that a [[mutation]] in the DNA sequence is not required for a heritable change.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas E. Dickins and Qazi Rahman. [http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2012/05/10/rspb.2012.0273 The extended evolutionary synthesis and the role of soft inheritance in evolution]. Proc. R. Soc. B 2012 279, doi: 10.1098/rspb.2012.0273&lt;/ref&gt; Basically, a high degree of maternal nurturing makes the offspring of that mother more likely to nurture their own children with a high degree of care as well. Rats with a lower degree of maternal nurturing are less likely to nurture their own offspring with so much care. Also, rates of epigenetic mutations, such as DNA methylation, are much higher than rates of mutations transmitted genetically&lt;ref&gt;Rando OJ, Verstrepen KJ (February 2007). [http://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(07)00121-3 Timescales of genetic and epigenetic inheritance]. Cell 128 (4): 655–68. doi:10.1016/j.cell.2007.01.023&lt;/ref&gt; and are easily reversed.&lt;ref&gt;Lancaster, Alex K.; [[Joanna Masel|Masel, Joanna]] (1 September 2009). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2770902/ The evolution of reversible switches in the presence of irreversible mimics]. Evolution 63 (9): 2350–2362. doi:10.1111/j.1558-5646.2009.00729.x&lt;/ref&gt; This provides a way for variation within a species to rapidly increase, in times of stress, providing opportunity for adaptation to newly arising selection pressures.

== Controversy ==

[[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] proposed that species experience certain obstacles in their lifetimes which they must overcome. They acquire certain characteristics to deal with these challenges, and such accumulations are then passed to their offspring. In modern terms, this transmission from parent to offspring would be considered a method of epigenetic inheritance. Scientists are now questioning the framework of the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]], as epigenetics has shown to be in direct contrast with the core of [[Darwinism]] while being in agreement with [[Lamarckism]]. While some evolutionary biologists have dismissed epigenetics' impact on evolution entirely, others have begun to discover that a fusion of both epigenetic and traditional genetic inheritance may contribute to the variations seen in species today.&lt;ref&gt;Pennisi E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9340">[[File:Bagsv2.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Jørn Utzon, Bagsvaerd Church (1973–6), Denmark; combinations of local culture and universal civilization.]]
'''Critical regionalism''' is an approach to [[architecture]] that strives to counter the placelessness and lack of identity of the [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]], but also rejects the whimsical individualism and ornamentation of [[Postmodern architecture]]. The stylings of critical regionalism seek to provide an architecture rooted in the modern tradition, but tied to geographical and cultural context. Critical regionalism is not simply [[Regionalism (politics)|regionalism]] in the sense of [[vernacular architecture]]. It is a progressive approach to design that seeks to mediate between the global and the local languages of architecture.

The phrase "critical regionalism" was first used by the architectural theorists [[Alexander Tzonis]] and Liane Lefaivre and, with a slightly different meaning, by the historian-theorist [[Kenneth Frampton]].

Critical Regionalists thus hold that both modern and post-modern architecture are "deeply problematic".&lt;ref&gt;Hal Foster, "Postmodernism: A Preface", in ''"Anti-Aesthetic. Essays on Postmodern Culture."'' Seattle: Bay Press, 1983. {{ISBN|0-941920-01-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kenneth Frampton ==
In "Towards a Critical Regionalism: Six points for an architecture of resistance", Frampton recalls [[Paul Ricoeur]]'s "how to become modern and to return to sources; how to revive an old, dormant civilization and take part in universal civilization". According to Frampton's proposal, critical regionalism should adopt modern architecture, critically, for its universal progressive qualities but at the same time value should be placed on the geographical context of the building. Emphasis, Frampton says, should be on topography, climate, light; on tectonic form rather than on scenography (i.e. painting theatrical scenery) and should be on the sense of touch rather than visual sense. Frampton draws on [[Phenomenology (architecture)|phenomenology]] for his argument.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Frampton, "Towards a Critical Regionalism: Six points for an architecture of resistance", in ''"Anti-Aesthetic. Essays on Postmodern Culture."'' Seattle: Bay Press, 1983. {{ISBN|0-941920-01-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:SaynatsaloTownHall.jpg|thumb|150px|Alvar Aalto, Saynatsalo Town Hall (1952), Finland: the grass steps appeal to the tactile sense.]]

Two examples Frampton briefly discusses are [[Jørn Utzon]] and [[Alvar Aalto]]. In Frampton's view, Utzon's [[Bagsværd Church]] (1973–6), near Copenhagen is a self-conscious synthesis between universal civilization and world culture. This is revealed by the rational, modular, neutral and economic, partly prefabricated concrete outer shell (i.e. universal civilization) versus the specially-designed, 'uneconomic', organic, reinforced concrete shell of the interior, signifying with its manipulation of light sacred space and 'multiple cross-cultural references', which Frampton sees no precedent for in Western culture, but rather in the Chinese [[pagoda]] roof (i.e. world culture). In the case of Aalto, Frampton discusses the red brick [[Säynätsalo Town Hall]] (1952), where, he argues, there is a resistance to universal technology and vision, affected by using the tactile qualities of the building's materials.  He notes, for instance, feeling the contrast between the friction of the brick surface of the stairs and the springy wooden floor of the council chamber.

== William J. R. Curtis and Suha Ozkan ==
There have been two different perceptions of Regionalism in architecture. One of which is of Western writers, like [[William J. R. Curtis|Curtis]], whose definitions are not encompassing enough to analyse architectural styles especially in the last two centuries in the Islamic countries, like Iran. However, Ozkan's definition of Regionalism is more objective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Theoretical Inapplicability of Regionalism to Analysing Architectural Aspects of Islamic Shrines in Iran in the Last Two Centuries|journal=The Collection of articles of the International Congress of Imam's Descendants (Imamzadegan)|year=2013|volume=4|pages=16–32|url=http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/18145|publisher=The Charity Organisation|location=Esfahan, Iran|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alexander Tzonis and Liane Lefaivre ==
According to [[Alexander Tzonis]] and [[Liane Lefaivre]], critical regionalism need not directly draw from the context; rather elements can be stripped of context but used in unfamiliar ways. Here the aim is to make evident a disruption and loss of place, that is already a ''[[fait accompli]]'', through reflection and self-evaluation.

== Critical regionalist architects ==
In addition to Aalto and Utzon, the following architects have used Critical Regionalism (in the Frampton sense) in their work: [[Studio Granda]], [[Mario Botta]], [[Eduardo Souto de Moura]], Mahesh Naik, Sahil Ahmed, [[Mazharul Islam]], [[B. V. Doshi]], [[Charles Correa]], [[Christopher Benninger]], [[Alvaro Siza]], [[Jorge Ferreira Chaves]], [[Rafael Moneo]], [[Geoffrey Bawa]], [[Raj Rewal]], Dharmesh Vadavala, [[Ashok "Bihari" Lall]] Neelkanth Chhaya (Kaka), Soumitro Ghosh, Nisha Mathew Ghosh, [[Ngô Viết Thụ]], [[Tadao Ando]], Mack Scogin / Merrill Elam, [[Glenn Murcutt]], [[Johnsen Schmaling Architects]], [[Ken Yeang]], Philippe Madec, [[William S.W. Lim]], Tay Kheng Soon, [[WOHA]] Architects (Singapore), [[Juhani Pallasmaa]], [[Wang Shu]], [[Juha Leiviskä]], [[Peter Zumthor]], [[Carlo Scarpa]], Tan Hock Beng. Peter Stutchbury, Lake Flato, Rick Joy, Tom Kundig, and Sverre Fehn. Dimitris &amp; Suzana Antonakakis are the two Greek architects for whom the term was first used by [[Tzonis]] and Lefaivre.&lt;ref&gt;Giamarelos, S. (2016). Intersecting Itineraries Beyond the Strada Novissima: The Converging Authorship of Critical Regionalism. Architectural Histories, 4(1), 11. DOI: http://doi.org/10.5334/ah.192&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical regionalism has developed into unique sub-styles across the world. [[Glenn Murcutt]]'s simple vernacular architectural style is representative of an Australian variant to critical regionalism. In [[Architecture_of_Singapore|Singapore]], [[WOHA]] has developed a unique architectural vocabulary based on an appreciation of the local climate and culture.

== In cultural studies ==
Subsequently, the phrase "critical regionalism" has also been used in cultural studies, literary studies, and political theory, specifically in the work of [[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak]]. In her 2007 work "Who Sings the Nation-State?", co-authored with [[Judith Butler]], Spivak proposes a deconstructive alternative to nationalism that is predicated on the [[deconstruction]] of borders and rigid national identity.&lt;ref name="Spivak on Regionalism"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crassh.cam.ac.uk/page/252/spivaks-abstracts.htm|title=Spivak on Regionalism|accessdate=2009-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas Reichert Powell's book ''Critical Regionalism: Connecting Politics and Culture in the American Landscape'' (2007) traces the trajectory of the term critical regionalism from its original use in architectural theory to its inclusion in literary, cultural, and political studies and proposes a methodology based on the intersection of those fields.

[[File:Wiki-dthroat.png|thumb|Illustration of a woman deep-throating a man]]

'''Deep-throating''' is a [[Human sexual activity|sexual act]] in which a person takes a partner's entire erect [[Human penis|penis]] deep into the [[Human mouth|mouth]] and throat. The practice is a type of [[fellatio]] where the receptive partner (the one whose mouth receives the penis) is in control, while deep throat penetration by an actively thrusting partner is called [[irrumatio]]; both are a form of [[oral sex]].&lt;ref name="Grandma's Sex Handbook 161"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZxVCHdCqOKYC&amp;pg=PA161 | title=Grandma's Sex Handbook | publisher=Intimate Press, USA | accessdate=January 7, 2012 | author=Wright, Anne | year=2009 | pages=161 | isbn=978-0-578-02075-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X3QJAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA39 | title=Leonardo da Vinci: A PSYCHOSEXUAL STUDY OF AN INFANTILE REMINISCENCE | publisher=MOFFAT YARD &amp; COMPANY | author=Freud, Sigmund | year=1916 | location=New York | pages=39 | quote=The situation contained in the phantasy, that a vulture opened the mouth of the child and forcefully belabored it with its tail, corresponds to the idea of fellatio, a sexual act in which the member is placed into the mouth of the woman. | accessdate=January 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For deep-throating, the penis has to be long enough so that it can reach the back of the recipient's throat.&lt;ref name="Grandma's Sex Handbook 161"/&gt;

The technique and term were popularized by the 1972 [[pornographic]] film [[Deep Throat (film)|''Deep Throat'']].

Deep-throating can be difficult, due to the natural [[Pharyngeal reflex|gag reflex]] triggered when the [[soft palate]] is touched.&lt;ref name="urlMedical Neurosciences"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neuroanatomy.wisc.edu/virtualbrain/BrainStem/09NA.html|title=Medical Neurosciences|last=McDougal|first=David|last2=Van Lieshout|first2=Dave|date=|website=|publisher=UW-Madison Medical school.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306024508/http://www.neuroanatomy.wisc.edu/virtualbrain/BrainStem/09NA.html|archive-date=March 6, 2012|dead-url=yes|last3=Harting|first3=John|accessdate=January 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://wordnet.princeton.edu/ | title=About WordNet - WordNet - About WordNet | publisher=Princeton University. | date=2010 | accessdate=January 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different people have different sensitivities to the reflex, and with practice, some people learn to suppress it. Deep-throating leads to an entirely different kind of oral stimulation in comparison to regular [[fellatio]]: the tongue is immobilized during deep-throating and sucking becomes impossible;&lt;ref name="Gentry"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=q8qtd61hoB8C&amp;pg=PA260 | title=The Bedside Orgasm Book: 365 Days of Sexual Ecstasy | publisher=Fair Winds Press | accessdate=January 7, 2012 | author=Gentry, Cynthia W. | year=2005 | location=Gloucester, Massachusetts USA | pages=260 | isbn=1-59233-101-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[glans penis]] can be intensely stimulated by the tightness of the [[pharynx]].

== Sex positions ==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}
There are several [[Sex positions|positions]] that are well suited for performing deep throat. Relaxation of the throat muscles is the most important aspect of positioning. 

One common position is to align the mouth and throat into a straight line (like a [[sword swallower]]), but many different positions are possible. 

"Over-the-edge" is a common position for deep-throating. In this position, the receptive partner lies back and hangs his or her head off the edge of a bed or similar piece of furniture, and the insertive partner stands or kneels in front of the face, lining up his penis at mouth level. 

Another common position used for deep-throating involves the insertive partner sitting on the receptive partner's chest, with his penis in front of the face.

[[Image:E-test Ngono.jpg|thumb|Etest]]

'''Etest''', (previously known as '''Epsilometer test''') manufactured by bioMérieux, is a manual ''in vitro'' diagnostic device used by laboratories to determine the [[Minimum inhibitory concentration|MIC]] (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration) and whether or not a specific strain of [[bacterium]] or [[fungus]] is susceptible to the action of a specific antimicrobial. This type of test is most commonly used in healthcare settings to help guiding physicians in treatment of patients by indicating what concentration of antimicrobial would successfully treat an infection.

==History==

The Etest strip was first described in 1988 and was introduced commercially in 1991 by AB BIODISK. bioMérieux acquired AB BIODISK in 2008 and continues to manufacture and market this product range under the mark Etest.

During the 1950s, Hans Ericsson (Professor of microbiology at the Karolinska Hospital and Karolinska Institute, Stockholm), the scientific founder of AB BIODISK, developed a method to standardize the disc diffusion method and to improve its reproducibility and reliability for clinical susceptibility predictions.  The inhibition zone sizes from disc test results were compared to [[Minimum inhibitory concentration|Minimum Inhibitory Concentration]] (MIC) values based on the reference [[agar dilution]] procedure.  The correlation between zone sizes and MIC values was then assessed using regression analysis and regression lines were used for extrapolating zone interpretive limits that corresponded to the MIC breakpoint values that defined susceptible, intermediate and resistant categorical results.

Etest was first presented at the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (ICAAC) in Los Angeles in 1988 as a novel gradient concept for MIC determinations. In September 1991, Etest was launched globally as a MIC product after receiving the USA Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance.

Etest  applications include many groups of fastidious organisms, fungi (yeast and mould) and mycobacteria as well as detecting various mechanisms of resistance and MIC testing of key antibiotics with critical specimens e.g. blood and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF).

==Intended use==

Etest is a quantitative technique for determining the antimicrobial susceptibility (AST) and MIC (in µg/mL) of Gram-negative and Gram-positive aerobic bacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae, ''Pseudomonas'', ''Staphylococcus'', and ''Enterococcus'' species and fastidious bacteria, such as anaerobes, ''N. gonorrhoeae'', ''S. pneumoniae'', ''Streptococcus'' and ''Haemophilius'' species.

==Principle==

Etest is a ‘ready-to-use’ , inert and non poreus plastic reagent strip with a predefined gradient of antibiotic, covering a continuous concentration range, for the determination of precise MIC values of a wide range of antimicrobial agents against different organism groups.

When Etest is applied to the surface of an agar plate inoculated with the test strain, there is an instantaneous release of the antimicrobial gradient from the plastic carrier to the agar to form a stable and continuous gradient beneath and in the immediate vicinity of the strip.

Etest incubation and reading times have been determined based on the intrinsic growth characteristics of the organism, and the specific incubation conditions.  Therefore, for reliable and reproducible results, the stability of the gradient must be maintained for many hours. The predefined Etest gradient remains stable for at least 18 to 24 hours; that is, a period that covers the critical times of many species of fastidious and non-fastidious organisms.

When the Etest strip is placed on an agar surface, the antibiotic gradient on the strip is simply transferred to the agar matrix creating an imprint of the gradient on the strip in the agar.   The bacterial growth becomes visible after incubation and a symmetrical inhibition ellipse centered along the strip is seen. The MIC value is read from the scale in terms of µg/mL where the ellipse edge intersects the strip.

==Choice of agar medium==

Etest can be used with many different kinds of AST agar medium as long as the medium supports good growth of the test organism and does not interfere with the activity of the antimicrobial agent. However, to maximise reproducibility, the medium chosen should fulfil the basic requirements for a susceptibility test medium.  The following AST mediums are recommended for use with Etest:

* Aerobes: Mueller Hinton agar such as MHE (bioMérieux)
* Anaerobes:  Brucella blood agar with appropriate supplements

These media may require supplemental nutrients to obtain enhanced growth of nutritionally fastidious organisms such as pneumococci, streptococci, Abiotrophia, Haemophilus, gonococci, meningococci and Campylobacter. In general, media recommendations from the [[Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute|CLSI]] (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute) and the EUCAST (European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing) are considered appropriate for Etest.

==Result interpretation==

After the required incubation period, and only when an even lawn of growth is distinctly visible, the MIC value can be read where the edge of the inhibition ellipse intersects the side of the strip.  The plate should not be read if the culture appears mixed or if the lawn of growth is too light or too heavy.
Etest MIC endpoints are usually clear-cut although different growth/inhibition patterns may be seen.

==Availability==

Etest products for more than 100 antimicrobial agents, including antibiotics, antifungal agents and antimycobacterial agents are available. In addition, specific Etest products are available for the detection of specific resistance mechanisms [e.g. ESBL (Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamase), MBL (Metallo Beta-Lactamase), AmpC Beta-Lactamase and VISA/h VISA].

Etest has been FDA cleared and CE marked for many organisms by comparing to conventional broth/agar dilution reference methods and shown to have excellent correlation.  This is a partial list of organisms and antibiotics for which the test has been FDA cleared and CE marked.

==Etest equipment==

The Etest family of instruments is designed to simplify the daily use of Etest. Simplex C76, Nema C88, and Retro C80 are easy to use, reducing operator fatigue, saving time and improving the quality of results by increasing reproducibility. Etest and related instruments offer one of the most efficient methods for generating on-scale MIC values across 15 doubling dilutions for susceptibility testing of a wide range of drug-bug combinations, including fastidious organisms.
* '''Simplex C76''' automates the placement of 1 to 6 different Etest strips to simplify the setup of MIC panels.  Application of up to 6 strips for large agar plates or up to 2 strips on small plates takes &lt;12 seconds.
* '''Retro C80''' is a rota-plater that simplifies and standardizes the inoculation of small and large agar plates making Etest® easier to read when compared to manual streaking.
* '''Nema C88''' is a vacuum pen that simplifies the application of Etest® strips. The applicator is held like a pen and the evacuation hole is covered with the fingertip to create suction.  The suction cup is placed on the strip to lift it up and then position onto the agar surface. The strip is released by removing the finger tip from the evacuation hole.

'''Fault-tolerant computer systems''' are systems designed around the concepts of [[fault tolerance]]. In essence, they must be able to continue working to a level of satisfaction in the presence of errors or breakdowns.

Fault tolerance is not just a property of individual machines; it may also characterise the rules by which they interact. For example, the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) is designed to allow reliable two-way communication in a [[packet-switched network]], even in the presence of communications links which are imperfect or overloaded. It does this by requiring the endpoints of the communication to ''expect'' packet loss, duplication, reordering and corruption, so that these conditions do not damage data integrity, and only reduce throughput by a proportional amount.

Recovery from errors in fault-tolerant systems can be characterised as either 'roll-forward' or 'roll-back'. When the system detects that it has made an error, roll-forward recovery takes the system state at that time and corrects it, to be able to move forward. Roll-back recovery reverts the system state back to some earlier, correct version, for example using [[checkpointing]], and moves forward from there. Roll-back recovery requires that the operations between the checkpoint and the detected erroneous state can be made [[Idempotence (computer science)|idempotent]]. Some systems make use of both roll-forward and roll-back recovery for different errors or different parts of one error.

== Types of fault tolerance ==
Most fault-tolerant [[computer systems]] are designed to handle several possible failures, including hardware-related faults such as [[hard disk]] failures, [[Input device|input]] or [[output device]] failures, or other temporary or permanent failures; [[software bug]]s and errors; interface errors between the hardware and software, including [[Device driver|driver]] failures; operator errors, such as erroneous keystrokes, bad command sequences or installing unexpected software and physical damage or other flaws introduced to the system from an outside source.&lt;ref&gt;Fault-tolerant computer system design  book contents. Dhiraj K. Pradhan, Pages: 135 – 138 1996 {{ISBN|0-13-057887-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hardware fault-tolerance is the most common application of these systems, designed to prevent failures due to hardware components. Most basically, this is provided by [[Redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]], particularly [[dual modular redundancy]]. Typically, components have multiple backups and are separated into smaller "segments" that act to contain a fault, and extra redundancy is built into all physical connectors, power supplies, fans, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Formal Techniques in Real-Time and Fault-Tolerant Systems: Second International Symposium, Nijmegen, the Netherlands, January 8–10, 1992, Proceedings

Contributor Jan Vytopil, Published by Springer, 1991, {{ISBN|3-540-55092-5}}, 978-3-540-55092-1
&lt;/ref&gt; There are special software and instrumentation packages designed to detect failures, such as fault masking, which is a way to ignore faults by seamlessly preparing a backup component to execute something as soon as the instruction is sent, using a sort of voting protocol where if the main and backups don't give the same results, the flawed output is ignored.

Software fault-tolerance is based more around nullifying programming errors using real-time redundancy, or static "emergency" subprograms to fill in for programs that crash. There are many ways to conduct such fault-regulation, depending on the application and the available hardware.&lt;ref&gt;Fault-tolerant computer system design  book contents. Dhiraj K. Pradhan, Pages: 221 – 235 1996 {{ISBN|0-13-057887-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The first known fault-tolerant computer was [[SAPO (computer)|SAPO]], built in 1951 in [[Czechoslovakia]] by [[Antonín Svoboda (computer scientist)|Antonín Svoboda]].&lt;ref name="computer-structures"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/bell_gordon/bell.computer_structures_principles_and_examples.1982.102630397.pdf|title=Computer Structures: Principles and Examples|author1=Daniel P. Siewiorek|author2=C. Gordon Bell|author3=Allen Newell|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]]|year=1982|isbn=0-07-057302-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|155}} Its basic design was [[Drum memory|magnetic drums]] connected via relays, with a voting method of [[RAM parity|memory error]] detection ([[triple modular redundancy]]). Several other machines were developed along this line, mostly for military use. Eventually, they separated into three distinct categories: machines that would last a long time without any maintenance, such as the ones used on [[NASA]] [[space probe]]s and [[satellites]]; computers that were very dependable but required constant monitoring, such as those used to monitor and control [[nuclear power plants]] or [[Collider|supercollider]] experiments; and finally, computers with a high amount of runtime which would be under heavy use, such as many of the supercomputers used by [[insurance companies]] for their [[probability]] monitoring.

Most of the development in the so-called LLNM (Long Life, No Maintenance) computing was done by NASA during the 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings/ftcsh/1995/7150/00/00532604.pdf|title=The STAR (Self-Testing And Repairing) Computer: An Investigation Of the Theory and Practice Of Fault-tolerant Computer Design|author1=Algirdas Avižienis|author2=George C. Gilley|author3=Francis P. Mathur|author4=David A. Rennels|author5=John A. Rohr|author6=David K. Rubin}}&lt;/ref&gt; in preparation for [[Project Apollo]] and other research aspects. NASA's first machine went into a [[space observatory]], and their second attempt, the JSTAR computer, was used in [[Voyager program|Voyager]]. This computer had a backup of memory arrays to use memory recovery methods and thus it was called the JPL Self-Testing-And-Repairing computer. It could detect its own errors and fix them or bring up redundant modules as needed. The computer is still working today{{when?|date=February 2017}}.

Hyper-dependable computers were pioneered mostly by [[aircraft]] manufacturers,&lt;ref name="computer-structures"/&gt;{{rp|210}} [[nuclear power]] companies, and the [[rail transport in the United States|railroad industry]] in the USA. These needed computers with massive amounts of uptime that would [[Graceful failure|fail gracefully]] enough with a fault to allow continued operation, while relying on the fact that the computer output would be constantly monitored by humans to detect faults. Again, IBM developed the first computer of this kind for NASA for guidance of [[Saturn V]] rockets, but later on [[BNSF]], [[Unisys]], and [[General Electric]] built their own.&lt;ref name="computer-structures"/&gt;{{rp|223}}

The 1970 [[F14 CADC]] had [[built-in self-test]] and redundancy.&lt;ref&gt;
Ray Holt.
[http://www.firstmicroprocessor.com/documents/lsistate-97.pdf "The F14A Central Air Data Computer, and the LSI Technology State-of-the-Art in 1968"].
&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, the early efforts at fault-tolerant designs were focused mainly on internal diagnosis, where a fault would indicate something was failing and a worker could replace it. SAPO, for instance, had a method by which faulty memory drums would emit a noise before failure.&lt;ref&gt;Fault tolerant computing in computer design
Neilforoshan, M.R
Journal of Computing Sciences in Colleges archive
Volume 18 ,  Issue 4  (April 2003) Pages: 213 – 220, {{ISSN|1937-4771}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later efforts showed that, to be fully effective, the system had to be self-repairing and diagnosing – isolating a fault and then implementing a redundant backup while alerting a need for repair. This is known as N-model redundancy, where faults cause automatic fail safes and a warning to the operator, and it is still the most common form of level one fault-tolerant design in use today.

Voting was another initial method, as discussed above, with multiple redundant backups operating constantly and checking each other's results, with the outcome that if, for example, four components reported an answer of 5 and one component reported an answer of 6, the other four would "vote" that the fifth component was faulty and have it taken out of service. This is called M out of N majority voting.

Historically, motion has always been to move further from N-model and more to M out of N due to the fact that the complexity of systems and the difficulty of ensuring the transitive state from fault-negative to fault-positive did not disrupt operations.

[[Tandem Computers|Tandem]] and [[Stratus Technologies|Stratus]] were among the first companies specializing in the design of fault-tolerant computer systems for [[online transaction processing]].

==Fault tolerance verification and validation==
The most important requirement of design in a [[Fault-tolerant design|fault tolerant]] computer system is making sure it actually meets its requirements for reliability. This is done by using various failure models to simulate various failures, and analyzing how well the system reacts. These [[statistical models]] are very complex, involving probability curves and specific fault rates, [[latency (engineering)|latency]] curves, error rates, and the like. The most commonly used models are HARP, SAVE, and SHARPE in the USA, and SURF or LASS in Europe.

== Fault tolerance research ==
Research into the kinds of tolerances needed for critical systems involves a large amount of interdisciplinary work. The more complex the system, the more carefully all possible interactions have to be considered and prepared for. Considering the importance of high-value systems in transport, [[public utilities]] and the military, the field of topics that touch on research is very wide: it can include such obvious subjects as [[software modeling]] and reliability, or [[hardware design]], to arcane elements such as [[stochastic]] models, [[graph theory]], formal or exclusionary logic, [[Parallel computing|parallel processing]], remote [[data transmission]], and more.&lt;ref&gt;

===Failure-oblivious computing===
''Failure-oblivious computing'' is a technique that enables [[computer programs]] to continue executing despite [[computer memory|memory]] [[data loss|errors]].  The technique handles attempts to read invalid memory by returning a manufactured value to the program, which in turn, makes use of the manufactured value and ignores the former [[computer memory|memory]] value it tried to access.  This is a great contrast to [[RAM parity|typical memory checkers]], which inform the program of the error or abort the program.  In failure-oblivious computing, no attempt is made to inform the program that an error occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===Recovery shepherding===
Recovery shepherding is a lightweight technique to enable software programs to recover from otherwise fatal errors such as null pointer dereference and divide by zero.&lt;ref name=rcv&gt;{{cite book

|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparing to the failure oblivious computing technique, recovery shepherding works on the compiled program binary directly and does not need to recompile to program. 
It uses the [[Just-in-time compilation|just-in-time]] [[instrumentation (computer programming)|binary instrumentation]] framework [[Pin (computer program)|Pin]]. It attaches to the application process when an error occurs, repairs the execution, 
tracks the repair effects as the execution continues, contains the repair effects within the application process, and detaches from the process after all repair effects are flushed 
from the process state. It does not interfere with the normal execution of the program and therefore incurs negligible overhead.&lt;ref name=rcv/&gt; For 17 of 18 systematically collected real world null-dereference and divide-by-zero errors, a prototype implementation enables the application to continue to execute to provide acceptable output and service to its users on the error-triggering inputs.&lt;ref name=rcv/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1706">Monsignor '''Felix Newton Pitt''' was born in 1894. He was born in [[Fairfield, Kentucky]]. He attended the [[St. Meinrad]] Seminary in Indiana from 1911 to 1915. He held a Swiss academic doctorate. One of his achievements was founding and organizing the Catholic school office in [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. In 1928 and 1929 while Secretary of the Catholic School Board he formed the Catholic Recreation Commission.  He was a pioneer on WHAS radio in ecumenical broadcast. He has also served on the post-World War II international committee. In 1949 when he was 55 years old he founded Pitt Academy a school for special kids. It was the first facility in Louisville for developmentally disabled students. Msgr. Pitt is also an [[author]] who in 1951 wrote the book "Catholic Education Today and Tomorrow". He died in 1971 at the age of 77. 

A biography was published in 2016 by his nephew on his sister's side, Pitt G. Thome:  Journey of a Country Soul:  The Life and Ministry of Monsignor Felix N. Pitt, Kentucky's Preeminent Catholic Educator of the 20th Century.  While it contains personal anecdotes, much of the book focuses on researched historical information placed in the context of events as they occurred.

The '''galactic plane''' is the [[plane (geometry)|plane]] on which the majority of a disk-shaped [[galaxy]]'s [[mass]] lies. The directions [[perpendicular]] to the galactic plane point to the '''galactic poles'''. In actual usage, the terms ''galactic plane'' and ''galactic poles'' usually refer specifically to the plane and poles of the [[Milky Way]], in which Planet [[Earth]] is located.

Some [[irregular galaxy|galaxies are irregular]] and do not have any well-defined disk. Even in the case of a [[barred spiral galaxy]] like the Milky Way, defining the galactic plane is slightly imprecise and arbitrary since the stars are not perfectly [[coplanar]]. In 1959, the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] defined the position of the Milky Way's north galactic pole as exactly [[right ascension|RA]] = {{RA|12|49}}, [[declination|Dec]] = {{DEC|27|24}} in the then-used [[B1950]] [[epoch (astronomy)|epoch]]; in the currently-used [[J2000]] epoch, after [[precession]] is taken into account, its position is RA {{RA|12|51|26.282}}, Dec {{DEC|27|07|42.01}}. This position is in [[Coma Berenices]], near the bright [[star]] [[Arcturus]]; likewise, the south galactic pole lies in the [[constellation]] [[Sculptor (constellation)|Sculptor]].

The "zero of longitude" of [[Galactic coordinate system|galactic coordinates]] was also defined in 1959 to be at position angle 123° from the north [[celestial pole]]. Thus the zero longitude point on the galactic equator was at {{RA|17|42|26.603}}, {{DEC|−28|55|00.445}} (B1950) or {{RA|17|45|37.224}}, {{DEC|−28|56|10.23}} (J2000), and its J2000 position angle is 122.932°. The [[galactic center]] is located at position angle 31.72° (B1950) or 31.40° (J2000) east of north.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6334">'''Humanities in the United States''' refers to the study of [[humanities]] disciplines, such as literature, history, language, performing and visual arts or philosophy, in the [[United States|United States of America]].

Many American colleges and universities seek to provide a broad "[[liberal arts education]]", in which all [[college]] students to study the humanities in addition to their specific area of study. Prominent proponents of liberal arts in the United States have included [[Mortimer J. Adler]]&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Mortimer J.; "A Guidebook to Learning: For the Lifelong Pursuit of Wisdom"&lt;/ref&gt; and [[E.D. Hirsch]].  A liberal arts focus is often coupled with curricular requirements; colleges including [[Saint Anselm College]] and [[Providence College]] have mandatory two-year [[core curricula]] in the humanities for their students.

The 1980 United States Rockefeller Commission on the Humanities described the humanities in its report, ''The Humanities in American Life'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;Through the humanities we reflect on the fundamental question: What does it mean to be human? The humanities offer clues but never a complete answer. They reveal how people have tried to make moral, spiritual, and intellectual sense of a world in which irrationality, despair, loneliness, and death are as conspicuous as birth, friendship, hope, and reason.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Conceptual validity==
The very concept of the ‘humanities’ as a  class or kind, distinct from the ’sciences’, has come under repeated attack in the twentieth century. [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|T.S. Kuhn]]’s ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Kuhn, Thomas]], ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'', The [[University of Chicago Press]], 1962&lt;/ref&gt; argued that the forces driving scientific progress often have less to do with objective inference from unbiased observation than with much more value-laden sociological and cultural factors. More recently, [[Richard Rorty]] has argued that the distinction between the sciences and the humanities is harmful to both pursuits, placing the former on an undeserved pedestal and condemning the latter to irrationality. Rorty’s position requires a wholesale rejection of such traditional philosophical distinctions as those between appearance and reality, subjective and objective, replacing them with what he endorses as a new ‘fuzziness’. This leads to a kind of pragmatism where "the oppositions between the humanities, the arts, and the sciences, might gradually fade away... In this situation, ‘the humanities’ would no longer think of themselves as such...."&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Rorty|Rorty, Richard]], ''Science as Solidarity'', in ''Objectivity, Relativism and Truth: Philosophical Papers Volume I'', [[Cambridge University Press]], 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modernism and postmodernism==
In the United States, the late 20th century saw a challenge to the "elitism" of the humanities, which [[Edward Said]] has characterized as a "conservative philosophy of gentlemanly refinement, or sensibility." Such [[postmodernism|postmodernists]] argued that the humanities should go beyond the study of "[[dead white males]]" to include work by women and people of color, and without religious bias. The French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] has been a very influential part of this movement, stating in ''The Order of Things'' that "we can study only individuals, not human nature."  However some in the humanities believed that such changes could be detrimental; the result is said to be what [[E. D. Hirsch Jr.]] refers to as declining [[cultural literacy]].&lt;ref&gt;Kernan, Alvin, editor; ''What's Happened to the Humanities?'', [[Princeton University Press]], Princeton, New Jersey, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==National institutions==
President [[Lyndon Johnson]] signed the [[National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act]] in 1965,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/overview.html www.neh.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; creating the National Council on the Humanities, and funded the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] (NEH) in 1969. NEH is an independent grant-making agency of the United States government dedicated to supporting research, education, preservation, and public programs in the humanities (see [[Public humanities]]).

NEH facilitated the creation of State Humanities Councils&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/statecouncils.html www.neh.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; in the 56 [[U.S. state]]s and [[Territories of the United States|territories]]. Each council operates independently, defining the "humanities" in relationship to the disciplines, subjects, and values valued in the regions they serve. Councils give grant funds to individuals, scholars, and nonprofit organizations dedicated to the humanities in their region. Councils also offer diverse programs and services that respond to the needs of their communities and according to their own definitions of the humanities.

==Career prospects==
Criticism of the traditional humanities/liberal arts degree program has been leveled by critics who see them as both expensive and relatively "useless" in the modern American job market, where several years of specialized study is required in most job fields. According to a 2018 report by the [[Humanities Indicators]], unemployment rates for humanities majors were slightly higher and their earnings were slightly lower than the averages for college degree recipients with similar degree levels (though both were still substantially better than for those without a college degree). Their overall levels of satisfaction with their jobs and their lives, however, were essentially the same as graduates from other fields, with more than 85% of humanities graduates reporting they were satisfied with their jobs. As of 2015, approximately five million people employed in management and professional jobs had bachelor’s degrees in the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The State of the Humanities 2018: Graduates in the Workforce &amp; Beyond|last=|first=|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|year=2018|isbn=|location=Cambridge, Mass.|pages=5-6, 12, 19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7211">{{Fiqh |hygiene}}

'''Islamic hygienical jurisprudence''' includes a number of regulations involving cleanliness during [[Salah|''salat'']] (obligatory prayer) through [[Wudu]] and [[Ghusl]], as well as [[Islamic dietary laws|dietary laws]] and [[Islamic toilet etiquette|toilet etiquette]] for [[Islam|Muslims]]. The ''fiqh'' is based on admonitions in the [[Qur'an]] for Muslims to be ritually clean whenever possible, as well as in [[Hadith|hadith]] (words, actions, or habits of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]]). 

Cleanliness is an important part of Islam, including Qur'anic verses that teach how to achieve [[Ritual purification|ritual cleanliness]]. Keeping [[oral hygiene]] through cleaning the [[Tooth|teeth]] with the use of a form of [[toothbrush]] called [[miswak]] is considered [[sunnah]], the way of Prophet [[Muhammad]]. Ritual [[Ritual purification|ablution]] is also very important, as observed by the practices of [[wudu]] (partial ablution), [[ghusl]] (full ablution), and [[tayammum]] (water-free alternative using any natural surface such as rock, sand, or dust). 

In Muslim countries, bathrooms are often equipped with a [[Muslim shower]] situated next to the toilet, so that individuals may wash themselves properly. This [[Ritual purification|ablution]] is required in order to maintain ritual cleanliness.  The common Muslims practice of taking off shoes when entering mosques and homes is also based on ritual cleanliness.

==Islamic cleanliness and hygiene==
[[Sunni Islam]] has its own hygienical jurisprudence. It is preferable for a Sunni Muslim to remove the hair directly below the navel and under the arms also as trimming the nails once a week. Leaving hair and nails is permissible after 15 days and disliked after 40 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sunnah.com/urn/204970|title=Hadith - The Book of Purification  - Sahih Muslim - Sunnah.com - Sayings and Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.sunnah.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best day for removing needless hair and cutting nails is Friday. It is permissible to use shaving cream to remove needless hair. Needless hair and nails should be buried to prevent illnesses from spreading. Cutting [[eyebrow]]s is permissible if they are too long. Sunni women should put their nails and hair removed from the head, below the navel and under the arms in a place where no non-permissible man can see it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sunnah of Trimming Hair / Nails - ZIKR|url = http://www.zikr.co.uk/content/view/69/110/|website = www.zikr.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Personal grooming]] is also a matter of focus in Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islamqa.info/en/9037|title=Ruling on trimming hair|work=Islam QA|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allowing a [[beard]] to grow while trimming the moustache is emphasized with it being seen as [[Fard|mandatory]] by all respected Sunni scholars from the four major Sunni [[Madh'hab]].

==Islamic dietary laws==
{{Main|Islamic dietary laws}}
'''Islamic dietary laws''' provide a set of rules as to what Muslims eat in their diet. These rules specify the food that is '''[[halal|halāl]]''', meaning lawful. They are found in Qur'an, the holy book of [[Islam]], usually detailing what is unlawful, or '''[[haraam|harām]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.icv.org.au/about/about-islam-overview/what-is-halal-a-guide-for-non-muslims/|title=What is Halal? A Guide for Non-Muslims {{!}} Islamic Council of Victoria (ICV)|work=Islamic Council of Victoria (ICV)|access-date=2018-01-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islamic genitalia hygiene==
Urine is forbidden to be on a Muslim during prayer times, as it is considered dirty. The [[foreskin]] is a possible spot where urine can accumulate. [[Circumcision]] is used to prevent this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sunnah.com/muslim/2/65|title=Hadith - The Book of Purification - Sahih Muslim - Sunnah.com - Sayings and Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)|last=|first=|date=|website=sunnah.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/malecircumcision.shtml|title=BBC - Religions - Islam: Circumcision of boys|access-date=2018-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islamic toilet etiquette==
{{Main|Islamic toilet etiquette}}
The [[Islam]]ic faith has particular rules regarding personal [[hygiene]] when going to the [[toilet]]. This code is known as ''Qadaahul Haajah''.&lt;ref name="MSA"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Compendium of Muslim Texts |last=Shu'aib |first=Tajuddin B. |work=The Prescribed Prayer Made Simple |title=Qadaahul Haajah (Relieving Oneself) |accessdate=2009-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IT&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/surgeons-perform-delicate-operation-for-muslims-124083.html|publisher=[[Irish Independent]]|title=Surgeons perform delicate operation for Muslims|date=April 8, 2007|author=Niamh Horan|postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Issues of laterality, such as whether one uses the left or right hand and the foot used to step into or out of toilet areas, are derived from [[hadith]] sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xRqDv90bAqsC|year=1992|title=The Tao of Islam|author=Sachiko Murata|isbn=978-0-7914-0913-8|chapter=ch. 3 The Two Hands of God|postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only issue which the [[Qur'an]] mentions is the one of washing one's hands especially after using the toilet which is mentioned in verse 5:6.

Examples of these rules include, but are not limited to:

* It is strongly forbidden to make the toilet close to the flowing waters, or to be by flowing water whilst relieving yourself.
* It is more preferable to step into the bathroom area with the left leg and step outside the bathroom area with the right leg.
* One should remain silent whilst on the toilet. Talking, answering greetings or greeting others is heavily disliked.&lt;ref name="MSA"/&gt;
* One should not face nor turn one's back on [[Qibla]] (the direction Muslims face to pray) whilst relieving oneself.&lt;ref name="MSA"/&gt;
* When leaving the toilet one should also say a prayer, "O Allah! Bestow your forgiveness upon me."&lt;ref name="MSA"/&gt;
* Use of [[toilet paper]] is acceptable, but [[Anal cleansing|washing with water]] is still needed for purity and to minimize germs present in feces from touching the skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Israr Hasan |year=2006 |title=Muslims in America |url=https://books.google.com/?id=k5J493fDF38C&amp;pg=PA144&amp;vq=odd |isbn=978-1-4259-4243-4 |page=144 |postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These ratios are often reported using the value calculated for the [[Sun]] as a baseline ratio which is a constant &lt;math&gt;\Upsilon_\odot&lt;/math&gt; = 5133 [[kilogram|kg]]/[[Watt|W]] equal to a [[solar mass]] ({{Solar mass|link=y}}) divided by a [[solar luminosity]] ({{Solar luminosity|link=y}}), ({{Solar mass}}/{{Solar luminosity}}). The mass to light ratios of galaxies and clusters are all much greater than &lt;math&gt;\Upsilon_\odot&lt;/math&gt; due in part to the fact that most of the [[matter]] in these objects does not reside within stars and observations suggest that a large fraction is present in the form of [[dark matter]].

Luminosities are obtained from [[photometry (astronomy)|photometric]] observations, correcting the observed [[brightness]] of the object for the [[cosmic distance ladder|distance dimming]] and [[interstellar extinction|extinction]] effects. In general, unless a complete [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]] of the [[Electromagnetic radiation|radiation]] emitted by the object is obtained, a model must be extrapolated through either [[power law]] or [[blackbody]] fits. The luminosity thus obtained is known as the [[bolometric luminosity]].

Masses are often calculated from the dynamics of the [[virial theorem|virialized system]] or from [[gravitational lens]]ing. Typical mass to light ratios for galaxies range from 2 to 10 &lt;math&gt;\Upsilon_\odot&lt;/math&gt; while on the largest scales, the mass to light ratio of the [[observable universe]] is approximately 100 &lt;math&gt;\Upsilon_\odot&lt;/math&gt;, in concordance with the [[Lambda-CDM model|current best fit cosmological model]].

{{morefootnotes|date=April 2018}}
The '''Mierzanowice culture''' appeared in the area of the upper and middle basin of the Vistula, during the Early Bronze Age. It evolved from the so-called Protomierzanowice cultural unit.  The name of the culture comes from an eponymous site in [[Mierzanowice]], where the cemetery was located. This entity was part of the precarpathian sphere epicorded cultures and it has been divided into three local groups: samborzecka, iwanowicka and pleszowska.&lt;ref name="lce.lublin.pl"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lce.lublin.pl/archeo/eneolit/eneo_2.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115215143/http://www.lce.lublin.pl/archeo/eneolit/eneo_2.html |title=Kultura mierzanowicka |archivedate=15 January 2012 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial phases of functioning of the mentioned culture are characterized by a small number of burials, seasonal settlements and single artifacts. The area of the Mierzanowice culture spread over from western Slovakia, through south - eastern Poland, reaching in the east the areas of the Volhynian Upland.&lt;ref name="kaczanowski 142"&gt;Kaczanowski and Kozłowski, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chronology ==
Based on relative dating, Mierzanowice culture appeared in the Early Bronze Age. According to the archaeologist Jan Machnik, we distinguish the older and younger phase of this cultural unit. The discovery in Szarbia Zwierzyniecka allowed for a certain "rejuvenation" of the Mierzanowice culture as a result of the distinction of its late phase called ''szarbiańska''.&lt;ref name="kaczanowski 142"/&gt; The younger phase of the Mierzanowice culture was expended at the end of bronze A1 and the beginning of bronze A2 according to Paul Reinecke chronology. 

== Burial ==
Cemeteries of the Mierzanowice cultural population were established near the settlements. The largest cemeteries were from 150 to 300 burials.&lt;ref name="lce.lublin.pl"/&gt; The burial occurred mainly in skeletal form. Human remains were put into oval or rectangular burial pits or in coffins made of wooden logs. There were two systems for arranging human corpses: in the shrunken position and in straight position. The bodies of men were buried on the right side while corpses of women on the left side. The results of investigations conducted at the cemeteries of the Mierzanowice culture, showed a little advantage of men's graves over women's graves,&lt;ref name="kaczanowski 144"/&gt; which had slightly poorer grave inventory. 




== Settlement ==
Settlements of the Mierzanowice culture in most cases are represented by small and seasonal camps. Settlements with a larger area were founded on the hills with a naturally defensive character, near water reservoirs. A relatively large part of the archaeological sites of this culture are found on loess uplands. The best – known settlement of the Mierzanowice culture is archaeological site called Iwanowice. In the classical phase of the Mierzanowice culture, the settlements were mostly accompanied by cemeteries. 

== Artifacts ==
One of the most common objects discovered in archaeological sites in the Mierzanowice culture are axes and sickles.&lt;ref name="kaczanowski 144"&gt;Kaczanowski and Kozłowski, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; Another type of artifacts are neklaces made of faience and bones. The Mierzanowice culture is well known for its earrings in the shape of a willow leaf, often produced in local workshops. Military objects discovered in the settlements are primarily arrowheads on the shape of leaves. The faience beads are an extremely common element of the funeral inventory. The next category is pottery. In vascular ceramics the influences of the Corded Ware culture are visible. Pottery of the late phase of Mierzanowice culture is characterized by a huge variety of forms and ornamentation

'''Mongol elements in Western medieval art''' can be seen in European works of art ranging from the 13th to the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;The subject has been especially described by Rosamond E. Mack, in ''Bazaar to Piazza: Islamic Trade and Italian Art, 1300–1600''.&lt;/ref&gt; They encompass artistic areas such as painting and textile manufacture, and mainly consist in the European use of [[Mongol]] [['Phags-pa script]] in Medieval European art, as well as the representation of "Tartar" cloth and Mongol soldiers in a number of contemporary European paintings.

==Mongol script in medieval art==
[[File:Master Of The Isaac Stories - The Doctors of the Church (detail) - WGA14568.jpg|thumb|left|220px|[[Saint Jerome]] reading a pseudo-Mongol script, consisting of an imitation of blocks of [['Phags-pa script|'Phags-pa letters]], written horizontally rather than vertically. 1296–1300, Church of San Francesco Assisi.&lt;ref&gt;"Texts of Jerome (Fig.43; destroyed in the 1997 earthquake), Augustine, and Pope gregory I are written in squared units of vertical, horizontal, and curved strokes that can be called pseudo-Mongol. Though the artist has aligned the units horizontally on the page in Western style, the script itself imitates 'Phags Pa, which is written vertically", [https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA52 Mack, p.52]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
During the period of interaction between the Mongols and the West, from the late 13th century to early 14th century, some Italian painters incorporated Mongol script (particularly the 'Phags-pa script) into their religious painting.&lt;ref name="Mack 51"&gt;"During the Pax Mongolica a few Italian painters imitated a Mongol script called 'Phags Pa", in [https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA51 Mack p.51]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kann 94"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2dt9WrHyed4C&amp;pg=PA94 ''The art, science, and technology of medieval travel'' by Andrea Kann p.94]&lt;/ref&gt; Examples can be seen especially in the frescos of the Upper Church of San Francesco at [[Assisi]], or in the paintings of [[Giotto]] and related painters.&lt;ref name="Kann 94"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Assisi painters, and Giotto as is shown below, were imitating a Mongol script before 1307, when reports of Friar [[John of Montecorvino]]'s success in Beijing arrived in the West, precipitating major missionary efforts in central Asia and China" [https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA51 Mack, p.51]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Liu Yigong 1324.jpg|thumb|Christian tombstone from [[Quanzhou]] with Mongol [['Phags-pa script|'Phags-pa]] inscriptions, 1324.&lt;ref name="Johnson 73"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kWTDfRythVkC&amp;pg=PA73 ''Jesus on the Silk Road'' by Dale A. Johnson p.73]&lt;/ref&gt;]] 
These inscriptions often imitated the Mongol 'Phags-pa, probably discovered by the artists through Mongol paper money or ''[[paiza]]'' (travel passes) such as those [[Marco Polo]] was issued with during his travels.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA52 Mack, p.52]&lt;/ref&gt; Frescos of [[Saint Jerome]], [[Augustine]] and [[Pope Gregory I]] in the [[Basilica of San Francesco d'Assisi|Church of San Francesco]] in [[Assisi]] (1296–1300) are known where they study books written in pseudo-Mongol.&lt;ref&gt;"The texts of Jerome (Fig.43, destroyed in the 1997 earthquake), Augustine and Pope Gregory I are written in squared units of vertical, horizontal, and curved strokes that can be called pseudo-Mongol. Though the artist has aligned the units horizontally on the page in Western style, the script itself imitates 'Pags Pa, which is written vertically" in [https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA52 Mack, p.52]&lt;/ref&gt; The famous Renaissance painter Giotto and his pupils often combined Arabic and 'Phags-pa script in their paintings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA54 Mack, p.54]&lt;/ref&gt; In Giotto's ''The Crucifixion'' (1304-1312/1313), soldiers wear tunics inscribed with pseudo-Mongol bands.&lt;ref name="Mack 61"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA61 Mack, p.61]&lt;/ref&gt; In Giotto's ''Madonna and Child'' (1320–1330), the [[Virgin Mary]]'s robe is decorated with a hem in a mix of Arabic and Mongol script.&lt;ref name="Mack 61"/&gt; Giotto again used the Mongolian script in the [[Scrovegni Chapel]].&lt;ref name="Kann 94"/&gt;

Besides the influence of exchanges between the Western and Mongol realms during the period, the exact reason for the incorporation of Mongol script in early Renaissance painting is unclear. It seems that Westerners believed 13–14th century Middle-Eastern scripts (such as Mongol and Arabic) to be the same as the scripts current during [[Jesus]]'s time, and thus found it natural to represent early Christians in association with them.  This may have been partly because some objects from the Islamic era with inscriptions were treated as relics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA52 Mack, p.52], [https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA69 Mack, p.69]&lt;/ref&gt; Another reason might be that artist wished to express a cultural universality for the Christian faith, by blending together various written languages, at a time when the church had strong international ambitions.&lt;ref&gt;"Because the Arabic and 'Pag Pa were associated with the Holy Land and the Early Christian Era, the frames could emphasize the origin and age of the images they surround. Perhaps they marked the imagery of a universal faith, an artistic intention consistent with the Church's contemporary international program." [https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA69 Mack, p.69]&lt;/ref&gt; Possibly, the usage of Mongol cultural markers was also a way to express the eastern links of European religious orders such as the Franciscans.&lt;ref name="Kann 94"/&gt;

In the East, a certain degree of cultural and artistic interaction is known due to the development of [[Christianity among the Mongols]]. The use of the Mongol script in association with representations of Christianity can be seen for example in [[Nestorian Christian]] steles, such as those found in [[Quanzhou]] which are dated to the 14th century.&lt;ref name="Johnson 73"/&gt;

The use of [['Phags-pa script|Phags-pa]] Mongol script in Medieval European painting had remained unnoticed however, until it was first identified in the 1980s by the Japanese scholar Hidemichi Tanaka.&lt;ref&gt;"Hidemichi Tanaka in a brilliant insight has persuasively established that Giotto was exposed to Mongol ''Phags-pa'' script, and that he used it as a decorative motif at [[Padua]] and elsewhere." in [https://books.google.com/books?id=IRunTSqY7msC&amp;pg=PA124 Arnold, p.124]&lt;/ref&gt; His findings were published in his 1983 paper ''The Mongolian Script in Giotto Paintings at the Scrovegni Chapel at Padova''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Mongolian Script in Giotto Paintings at the Scrovegni Chapel at Padova'' in Europäische Kunst um 1300, Akten des XXV. Internationalen Kongresses für Kunstgechichte, 1983 [https://books.google.com/books?id=f1HJjUB8FhIC&amp;pg=PA96 ''The oliphant: Islamic objects in historical context'' Avinoam Shalem p.96 Note 56]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kufic]] Arabic script is even more often used in a similar way, known as [[Pseudo-Kufic]].

==Mongol Empire "Tatar" textiles in medieval art==
[[File:Simone Martini 078.jpg|thumb|'''Fig. 23''': Small-patterned Tartar-style textiles are worn by [[Gabriel|Angel Gabriel]] in the ''[[Annunciation with St Margaret and St Ansanus|Annunciation]]'' by [[Simone Martini]] (1333).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA35 Mack, p.35-36]: "A well-documented example of a delayed but creative Italian response to the new Tatar cloths is that of the tiny-pattern design, in which small leaves or plants and animals rhythmically organized in dense, allover composition. (...) During the early fourteenth century, the Angevins of Naples donated numerous Tatar cloths, including velvets, to San Franceso at Assisi. Since Simone executed the painting in Naples, the Tatar cloths, as well as Oriental carpets -also the earliest in Italian painting- and a particular crozier in Figure 65 probably represent prized artifacts at king Robert's court. Later Simone brillantly captured the vibrant shimmering effect of the tiny pattern on a white ground in the archangel Gabriel's robe in the ''Annunciation'' painted for the cathedral of Sienna in 1333 (Fig. 23)" – [https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA35 Mack, p.35]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arnold 121"&gt;"Simone Martini (...) depicted this angel wearing a robe of Mongol ''nasij'' cloth -a gold working of leaves on a white background- usually described in western inventories as ''panno tartarico albo ad floria aurea''" in [https://books.google.com/books?id=IRunTSqY7msC&amp;pg=PA121 ''Princely gifts and papal treasures'' by Lauren Arnold p.121]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Around 1300, an influx of Mongol Empire textiles found their way to Italy, and were to prove quite influential in Italian art.&lt;ref&gt;"The Pax Mongolica brought an influx of influential "Tatar" textiles into Italy about 1300 (see for example Fig. 22, 25, 32) and left its mark on fourteenth-century Italian art in Mongol figures, costumes (see Fig. 160), and script (see Fig. 43, 49) in paintings and in references to monuments along the caravan routes on the facades of the Doge's Palace in Venice (see Fig. 10)" in [https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA18 Mack, p.18]&lt;/ref&gt; These textiles even revolutionized Italian textile designs.&lt;ref&gt;"The fabrics that revolutionized Italian textile design beginning about the 1330s were the Tatar cloths arriving from Central Asia and Syria during the Pax Mongolica. Though they were foremost among imports in the Papal collections, probably thanks to [[diplomatic gift]]s from the [[Il-Khanate|Il-Khanids]] of Persia, the new imports attracted no attention from Italian painters for two more decades and from local designers for three.", in [https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA35 Mack, p.35]&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1265 and 1308, communications between Western and [[Il-Khanate|Il-Khanid]] rulers led to numerous exchanges of people and presents, as when about 100 Mongols in Mongol dress visited Rome for the [[Papal Jubilee]] of [[Pope Boniface VIII]] in 1300.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA18 Mack, p.18]&lt;/ref&gt; Large quantities of ''panni tartarici'' ([[Tatar]] cloth) were recorded in the Papal inventory of 1295, and must have been diplomatic gifts from the Il-Khanate.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA18 Mack, p.18], [https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA35 Mack, p.35]&lt;/ref&gt; Later on Western merchants were also able to purchase such textiles from [[Tabriz]], and the Mongol capital of [[Sultaniya]], established by [[Öljaitü]] between 1305 and 1313, and until the capture of the [[Cilician Armenia]] harbour of [[Ayas, Adana|Ayas]] by the [[Mamluk]]s in 1347.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA16 Mack, p.16-17]&lt;/ref&gt; The Tatar cloths were a produce of transcultural exchange under Mongol rule.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA35 Mack p.35]: "Tatars cloths were themselves products of transcultural exchange. As the nomadic Mongol warriors became imperial rulers, they adopted many aspects of the sophisticated textile cultures in conquered Islamic lands and developed a preference for silk lavishly ornamented with gold threads. Customarily, the Mongols spared skilled weavers -both Muslim and Chinese- from the sword, distributed them as booty, and transported them to new workshops scattered across the empire. Captive artisans served royal courts, the military and government officials, who were often recruited from the conquered. For example, it is known that [[Herat]]i and Chinese craftsmen worked together, and some Herati were sent back to their homes in eastern Persia (now Afghanistan). The cultural mix among the imperial elite and the craftsmen working for them resulted in a rich and distinctive blend of Islamic and Chinese techniques and patterns."&lt;/ref&gt; They are described as Mongol ''nasij'' cloth, coming from Mongol, by author Lauren Arnold.&lt;ref name="Arnold 121"/&gt;

[[File:Boniface VIII with Tartar cloth.jpg|thumb|[[Pope Boniface VIII]] at the 1300 jubilee with a "Tartar cloth" in front of him, with a "rhythmic Sino-Mongolian pattern".&lt;ref&gt;"In this fragment of the fresco, attributed to Giotto, Pope [[Boniface VIII]] proclaims the jubilee year of 1300. Over the balcony is a "Tartar cloth", one of the many silks presented by the Persian [[Mongol]] ruler, and distinguished by its rhythmic '''Sino-Mongolian''' pattern" "Silk" p.41 [https://books.google.com/books?id=LpVdUddNkGUC&amp;pg=PA41].&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Mongol Empire textiles had a strong impact on Italian textile design from around 1330.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA35 Mack, p.35]&lt;/ref&gt; A type of Tartar cloth that was adopted in the West consisted in small-pattern designs in dense composition. This sort of textile is represented in the clothing of the angel Gabriel in the ''[[The Annunciation (Simone Martini)|Annunciation]]'' by [[Simone Martini]] (1333).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA35 Mack, p.35-36]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other designs involved naturally flowing compositions of flowers and vines with fantastic animals.&lt;ref name="Mack, p.37"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA37 Mack, p.37]&lt;/ref&gt; Such a textile is depicted as the background curtain in [[Giotto]]'s ''Coronation of the Virgin'' (circa 1330), the earliest such depiction of a Tartar cloth.&lt;ref name="Mack, p.37"/&gt; Chinese types of floral designs were also adopted, as visible in the mantles of Christ and Mary in ''Coronation of the Virgin'' by [[Paolo Veneziano]] (circa 1350).&lt;ref name="Mack, p.38"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA38 Mack, p.38]&lt;/ref&gt;

Transmission of Chinese textile designs from the Mongol [[Yuan Dynasty]] also occurred: Textiles of [[Iran]] and [[Iraq]] in the 14th century incorporated Chinese [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] designs in silk and gold thread, and Italian weavers adopted such designs from the second half of the 14th century, complete with phoenix designs and silk and gold thread. These designs are of Chinese origin, and reached Europe via the Mongol realm.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA35 Rosamond E.Mack], {{ISBN|0-520-22131-1}} p.27-49&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mongols in European painting==
[[File:Mongol tumen commander.jpg|thumb|200px|Mongol commander of a thousand troops, in [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti]]'s ''Martyrdom of the Franciscans'', 1330.]]
Mongols are visible in a variety of European paintings from the 13–14th century. They suggest that Italian artists had been in direct contact with people from [[Tartary]].&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, p.124&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Legnica.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Battle of Legnica|battle of Liegnitz]], 1241, between the Mongols (left) and European knights (right). 14th century.]]
[[File:Kublai giving support to the Venetians.JPG|thumb|left|[[Kubilai Khan]] giving financial support to the Polo family]]
As early as 1253, during the initial encounters of the Mongols with the West following the [[Mongol invasion of Europe]], [[Matthew Paris]] represented Mongol soldiers with their characteristic conical hat as [[cannibals]] in his ''[[Chronica Majora]]''.&lt;ref name="Kann 94"/&gt;

Later, the Mongols would appear in much less caricatural portrayals. The travels of [[Marco Polo]] to the [[Mongol Empire]] gave rise to opulent descriptions of the Mongol ruler [[Kublai Khan]] and his court.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KuLCCXVebuEC&amp;pg=PA36 ''America views China: American images of China then and now'' by Jonathan Goldstein,Jerry Israel,Hilary Conroy p.36]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mongols were then occasionally incorporated in the work of European painters, particularly illustrations of events in Asia or the [[Holy Land]]. Among other works, Mongol horsemen appear in the ''Crucifixion of Saint Peter'', [[Giotto]], circa 1299, probably following the visit of Mongol visitors from the East, such as the Mongol delegation who is known to have participated to the 1300 [[Papal Jubilee]] in Rome.&lt;ref name="Arnold 54"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IRunTSqY7msC&amp;pg=PA54 Arnold, p.54]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mongol archers are also shown shooting at [[Saint Sebastian|Sebastian]] in ''Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian'', [[Giovanni del Biondo]], circa 1370,&lt;ref name="Arnold, p.113"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IRunTSqY7msC&amp;pg=PA113 Arnold, p.113]&lt;/ref&gt; and Mongol commanders in uniform appear in [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti]]'s ''Martyrdom of the Franciscans'' (1285–1348) with their characteristic conical hat decorated with a feather.&lt;ref name="Kann 94"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosamond E. Mack p. 151"&gt;Rosamond E.

This hat with a neck-covered flap and feather on top accurately depicts the headgear of commanders of one thousand men in the Mongol army. Such headgear might even have been seen in [[Siena]]: perhaps [[Tommaso Ugi di Siena|Tommaso Ugi]], a Sienese who had taken the name Tumen, had visited Siena when he accompanied the Il-Khanid emissaries in 1301."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mack, p.18"&gt;Mack notes the "Mongol figures and costumes" in the painting: "Mongol figures, costumes (see Fig. 160)", [https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA18 Mack, p.18]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics''', or '''Nordita''' ({{lang-da|Nordisk Institut for Teoretisk (Atom)fysik}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaea.org/inis/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/46/032/46032026.pdf Around the Laboratories], IAEA.org.&lt;/ref&gt;), is an international organisation for research in [[theoretical physics]]. It was established in 1957 by [[Niels Bohr]] and the Swedish physicist [[Torsten Gustafson]]. Nordita was originally located at the [[Niels Bohr Institute]] in [[Copenhagen]] ([[Denmark]]), but moved to the [[AlbaNova]] University Centre in [[Stockholm]] ([[Sweden]]) on 1 January 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main research areas at Nordita are [[astrophysics]], hard and soft [[condensed matter physics]], and [[high-energy physics]].

== Research ==
 
Since Nordita's establishment in 1957 the original focus on research in atomic and nuclear physics has been broadened. 
Research carried out by Nordita's academic staff presently includes [[astrophysics]], [[biological physics]], hard [[condensed matter physics]] and [[materials physics]], soft [[condensed matter physics]], [[cosmology]], [[statistical physics]] and [[complex systems]], [[high-energy physics]], and [[gravitational physics]] and [[cosmology]]. The in-house research forms the backbone of Nordita activities and complements the more service oriented functions. By mission, Nordita has the task of facilitating interactions between physicists in the Nordic countries as well as with the international community; therefore the comparably small institute has a large number of visitors, conferences and scientific programs that last several weeks. 

Notable former or present researchers at Nordita include [[Alexander V. Balatsky]], [[Holger Bech Nielsen]], Axel Brandenburg, [[Gerald E. Brown]], [[Paolo Di Vecchia]], [[James Hamilton (physicist)|James Hamilton]], John Hertz, Alan Luther, [[Ben Roy Mottelson]], Christopher J. Pethick, [[Leon Rosenfeld]], Kim Sneppen, John Wettlaufer, and Konstantin Zarembo.

== Organization ==

[[File:Nordita_Main_Building_Stockholm.png|thumb|right|The Nordita East building in Stockholm]] Nordita is governed by a board consisting of one representative and one alternate member from each Nordic country, headed by a chair person. The board appoints a number of research committees which evaluate proposals and advice the board on scientific and educational matters. 

The Nordita board nominates a director who is appointed by the president of [[Royal Institute of Technology|KTH Royal Institute of Technology]] and the vice-chancellor of [[Stockholm University]]. The director, currently [[Thors Hans Hansson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|

}}&lt;/ref&gt;, is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the institute and provides scientific leadership.

== Funding ==

Nordita is funded jointly by the [[Nordic countries]] via the [[Nordic Council of Ministers]], the [[Swedish Research Council]], and the host universities [[Royal Institute of Technology|KTH Royal Institute of Technology]], [[Stockholm University]] and [[Uppsala University]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3043">'''Phoslock''' is the commercial name for a [[bentonite]] clay in which the sodium and/or calcium ions are exchanged for [[lanthanum]]. The addition of this element allows it to bind with phosphates to form rhabdophane (&lt;chem&gt;LaPO4.\mathit{n}H2O&lt;/chem&gt;) and thereby remove them from the water column. It is used in lake restoration projects as a tool to manage [[eutrophication]] and manage [[algal blooms]] (specifically [[cyanobacteria]] or blue green algae) by reducing [[phosphorus]], one of the major contributing factors to algal growth.

It was developed in Australia by the [[CSIRO]] in the late 1990s by Dr Grant Douglas (US Patent 6350383) as a way of utilising the ability of lanthanum to bind phosphate in freshwater natural aquatic systems. The first large-scale trial took place in January 2000 in the [[Canning River]], Western Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phoslock.com.au/irm/ShowStaticCategory.aspx?CategoryID=172&amp;masterpage=5 About Phoslock], Phoslock Water Solutions&lt;/ref&gt; More recent [[CSIRO]] research has involved the development of a nanoclay hybrid with a demonstrated ability to remove dissolved phosphorus from both natural and wastewaters.  
  
During its development, patenting and commercialisation by CSIRO and subsequent commercial production, Phoslock has been a subject in academic research (,&lt;ref&gt;Egemose et al, Chemical lake restoration products: sediment stability and phosphorus dynamics, Environment Science &amp; Technology 44 (3), 985-991 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lurling et al, Effects of lanthanum and lanthanum-modified clay on growth, survival and reproduction of Daphnia magna, Water Research 44 (3), 309-319 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robb et al, Application of Phoslock™, an innovative phosphorus binding clay, to two Western Australian waterways - preliminary findings, Hydrological Processes, 494, 237-243 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, et al, Phoslock™ - A new technique to reduce internal phosphorus loads in aquatic systems.

The largest number of whole lake applications and the most comprehensive pre and post-application monitoring has taken place in Europe, primarily Germany (where it is sold under the tradename Bentophos), the Netherlands and the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phoslock.eu|title=Home : Phoslock|website=Phoslock.eu|accessdate=27 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

'''Psychohistory''' is the study of the psychological motivations of historical events.&lt;ref&gt;http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119612862/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0&lt;/ref&gt; It attempts to combine the insights of [[psychoanalysis]] with the research methodology of the [[social sciences]] to understand the emotional origin of the social and [[political]] behavior of groups and nations, past and present. Its subject matter is childhood and the [[family]], and psychological studies of [[anthropology]] and [[ethnology]].

==Description==
[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn 035.jpg|thumb|right|Rembrandt's painting of the sacrifice of Isaac ([[Book of Genesis|Gen]].22). Psychohistory holds that ritual child sacrifice  once  occurred  in most cultures.]]

Psychohistory derives many of its concepts from areas that are perceived to be ignored by conventional historians and anthropologists as shaping factors of human history, in particular, the effects of [[parenting]] practice and child abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Alice|title=For Your Own Good: Hidden Cruelty in Child-Rearing and the roots of violence|year=1980|publisher=Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780374522698}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to conventional historians "the science of culture is independent of the laws of [[biology]] and [[psychology]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Psychohistorians, on the other hand, suggest that social behavior such as [[crime]] and [[war]] may be a self-destructive re-enactment of earlier abuse and neglect; that unconscious flashbacks to early fears and destructive parenting could dominate individual and  social behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Psychohistory relies heavily on historical biography. Notable examples of [[psychobiography|psychobiographies]] are those of [[Lewis Bernstein Namier|Lewis Namier]], who wrote about the [[British House of Commons]], and [[Fawn Brodie]], who wrote about [[Thomas Jefferson]].

===Areas of study===
There are three inter-related areas of psychohistorical study.&lt;ref name="Primalpages"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://primal-page.com/psyhis.htm |title=Lloyd deMause and Psychohistory |accessdate=2008-03-11 |work= |publisher=Primal Psychotherapy WebPages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:1. The history of childhood – which looks at such questions as:
::*How have children been raised throughout history
::*How has the family been constituted
::*How and why have practices changed over time
::*The changing place and value of children in society over time
::*How and why our views of child abuse and neglect have changed
:2. [[Psychobiography]] – which  seeks to understand individual historical people and their motivations in history.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}
:3. Group psychohistory – which  seeks to understand the motivations of large groups, including nations, in history and current affairs.  In doing so, psychohistory advances the use of group-fantasy analysis of political speeches, political cartoons and media headlines since the [[Loaded language|loaded terms]], [[metaphor]]s and repetitive words therein offer clues to unconscious thinking and behaviors.&lt;ref name="Primalpages"/&gt;

===Emergence as a discipline===
{{OR-section|date=August 2016}}&lt;!-- Only one of the people Wikipedia articles linked in this section makes any use of the word "psychohistory" in its body. That is the last person listed, and that sentence itself has been tagged as needing a citation for six and a half years. This smacks of the kind of stuff encountered at the "Tanka prose" article, where the inventor of the concept had in a number of self-published essays listed himself as the latest in a long line of "practitioners" stretching back more than a thousand years and Wikipedia mirrored this false characterization. Sources need to be added that specifically, and reliably, discuss the "history" of the "discipline" of "psychohistory" in these exact terms as beginning with Freud and Reich, Fromm, Adorno, Erikson and then deMause. ~Hijiri88, August 2016. --&gt;
[[Sigmund Freud]]'s well known work, ''[[Civilization and Its Discontents]]'' (1929), included an analysis of history based on his theory of psychoanalysis. Yet, Freud's text is in no way a psycho-historical work since the focus of the study is to examine and explain the level of individual psyche which may arise from the influence of the structures of civilization. It is in fact the opposite of psycho-history in that it claims that the unconscious and the individual psyche are both structural effects of different social forces, i.e., civilization.

[[Wilhelm Reich]] combined his psychoanalytic and political theories in his book ''[[The Mass Psychology of Fascism]]'' in 1933.

The psychologist and philosopher [[Erich Fromm]] wrote about the psychological motivation behind political ideology, starting with ''[[The Fear of Freedom]]'' in 1941.

Another member of the Frankfurt school, [[Theodor Adorno]], published ''[[The Authoritarian Personality]]'', in 1950, which was an influential sociological book which could be taken as something of a proto-psychohistorical book.

Its first academic use appeared in [[Erik Erikson]]'s book ''Young Man Luther'' (1958), where the author called for a discipline of "psycho-history" to examine the impact of human character on history.

[[Lloyd deMause]] developed a formal psychohistorical approach from 1974 onwards, and continues to be an influential theorist in this field.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

===Independence as a discipline===

Psychohistorians have argued that psychohistory is a separate field of scholarly inquiry with its own particular methods, objectives and theories, which set it apart from conventional historical analysis and anthropology. Some historians, social scientists and anthropologists have, however, argued that their disciplines already describe psychological motivation and that psychohistory is not, therefore, a separate subject. Others regard it as an undisciplined field of study, due to its emphasis given to speculation on the psychological motivations of people in history. Doubt has also been cast on the viability of the application of post-mortem psychoanalysis by Freud's followers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/reviews/shrinking-history/] Review of ''Shrinking History on Freud and the Failure of Psychohistory'' - Reviewed in 1980 by Cosma Shalizi
:'''Note:''' The book under review criticizes the Freudian approach to psychohistory. It makes no mention of modern psychohistorical research, which uses different methods.&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychohistorians maintain that the difference is one of emphasis and that, in conventional study, narrative and description are central, while psychological motivation is hardly touched on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Psychogenic mode==
[[Lloyd deMause]] has described a system of psychogenic modes (see below) which describe the range of styles of parenting he has observed historically and across cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Joseph F.|year=2009|title=Psychohistory: Creating a New Discipline|url=|journal=Journal of Psychohistory|volume=37|issue=1|pages=2–26|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychohistorians have written much about changes in the human psyche through history; changes that they believe were produced by parents, and especially the mothers' increasing capacity to empathize with their children. Due to these changes in the course of history, different ''psychoclasses'' (or ''psychogenic modes'') emerged. A psychoclass is a type of mentality that results from, and is associated with, a particular childrearing style, and in its turn influences the method of childrearing of the next generations. According to psychohistory theory, regardless of the changes in the environment, it is only when changes in childhood occur and new psychoclasses evolve that societies begin to progress.

The major psychogenic modes described by deMause are:&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091026212029/http://www.geocities.com/kidhistory/modesw.htm ''The Evolution of Childrearing Modes'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PsFoundations"&gt;{{cite book |last=deMause |first=Lloyd  |authorlink=Lloyd deMause|title=Foundations of Psychohistory |url= |edition= |series= |date= January 1982  |publisher=Creative Roots Publishing  |location= |isbn=0-940508-01-X |oclc= |doi=  |pages=61 &amp; 132–146}}{{cite web |url=http://www.psychohistory.com/htm/p132x146.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-07-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060703011204/http://www.psychohistory.com/htm/p132x146.htm |archivedate=2006-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

! Mode
! Childrearing characteristics
! Historical manifestations
|-
| rowspan="2" valign="top" | Infanticidal
| valign="top" | ''[[Early infanticidal childrearing]]:''&lt;br /&gt;Ritual sacrifice. High infanticide rates, incest, body mutilation, child rape and tortures.
| rowspan="2" | [[Child sacrifice]] and [[infanticide]] among tribal societies, [[Child sacrifice in pre-Columbian cultures|Mesoamerica and the Incas]]; in [[Assyria]]n and [[Canaan]]ite religions. [[Human sacrifice#Phoenicia|Phoenicians, Carthaginians]] and other early states also sacrificed infants to their gods.

On the other hand, the relatively more enlightened Greeks and Romans exposed some of their babies ("late" infanticidal childrearing).
|-
| valign="top" | ''Late infanticidal childrearing:''&lt;br /&gt;While the young child is not overly rejected by the mother, many newborn babies, especially girls, are [[Infant exposure|exposed]] to death.
|-
| valign="top" | Abandoning
| valign="top" | Early Christians considered a child as having a soul at birth, although possessed by evil tendencies. Routine infanticide was replaced by joining in the group fantasy of the sacrifice of Christ, who was sent by his father to be killed for the sins of others.&lt;ref name="PsFoundations" /&gt; Routine pederasty of boys continued in monasteries and elsewhere, and the rape of girls was commonplace.&lt;ref name="EMOL" /&gt;
| valign="top" | Infanticide replaced by abandonment. Those children who survived the experience did not internalize a completely murderous superego. Longer [[swaddling]], [[fosterage]], outside [[Wet nurse|wetnursing]], oblation of children to monasteries and nunneries, and [[apprenticeship]].
|-
| valign="top" | Ambivalent
| valign="top" | The 12th century saw the first child instruction manuals and rudimentary child protection laws, although most mothers still emotionally rejected their children.&lt;ref name="PsFoundations" /&gt;  Children were often treated as erotic objects by adults.
| valign="top" | The later Middle Ages ended abandonment of children to monasteries.  early beating, shorter swaddling, mourning for deceased children, a precursor to [[empathy]].
|-
| valign="top" | Intrusive
| valign="top" | During the 16th century, particularly in England, parents shifted from trying to stop children's growth to trying to control them and make them obedient. Parents were prepared to give them attention as long as they controlled their minds, their insides, their anger and the lives they led.&lt;ref name="PsFoundations" /&gt;
| valign="top" | The intrusive parent began to unswaddle the infant. Early toilet training, [[Psychological repression|repression]] of child's sexuality. [[Hell]] threats turned into the Puritan child so familiar from early modern childrearing literature. On the other hand, the end of swaddling and wet-nursing made possible the explosive modern takeoff in scientific advance.
|-
| valign="top" | Socializing
| valign="top" | Beginning in the 18th century, mothers began to enjoy child care, and fathers began to participate in younger children's development.&lt;ref name="PsFoundations" /&gt; The aim remained instilling parental goals rather than encouraging individuation. [[Psychological manipulation|Manipulation]] and [[spanking]] were used to make children obedient. Hellfire and the harsher physical disciplinary actions using objects to beat the child disappeared.&lt;ref name="PsFoundations" /&gt;  The Socializing Mode remains the most popular model of parenting in North America and Western Europe to the present day.
| valign="top" | Use of guilt, "mental discipline", [[humiliation]], [[Time-out (parenting)|time-out]], rise of [[Compulsory education|compulsory schooling]], delegation of parental unconscious wishes. As parental injections continued to diminish, the rearing of the child became less a process of conquering its will than of training it. The socializing psychoclass built the modern world.&lt;ref name="PsFoundations" /&gt;
|-
| valign="top" | Helping
| valign="top" | Beginning in the mid-20th century, some parents adopted the role of helping children reach their own goals in life, rather than "[[socialize]]" them into fulfilling parental wishes. Less manipulation, more unconditional love. Children raised in this way are far more empathic towards others in society than earlier generations.&lt;ref name="PsFoundations" /&gt;
| valign="top" | [[Children's rights movement]], [[natural childbirth]], the abandonment of [[circumcision]], [[attachment parenting]], [[Taking Children Seriously]], unconditional parenting, [[Parent Effectiveness Training]], [[deschooling]] and [[Anarchistic free school|free schooling]].

Psychohistorians maintain that the five modes of abusive childrearing (excluding the "helping mode") are [[Trauma model of mental disorders#Psychohistory table|related to psychiatric disorders]] from psychoses to neuroses.

The chart below shows the dates at which these modes are believed to have evolved in the most advanced nations, based on contemporary accounts from historical records. A black-and-white version of the chart appears in ''Foundations of Psychohistory''.&lt;ref name="PsFoundations" /&gt;&lt;!-- p. 61 --&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
[[File:Image-Evolution of psychogenic modes.png|centre]]

The Y-Axis on the above chart serves as an indicator of the new stage and not a measurement of the stage's size or relation to the x-axis.

The timeline doesn't apply to [[hunter-gatherer]] societies. It doesn't apply either to the [[Greece|Greek]] and [[Rome|Roman]] world, where there was a wide variation in childrearing practices. It is notable that the arrival of the ''Ambivalent'' mode of child-rearing preceded the start of the [[Renaissance]] (mid 14th century) by only one or two generations, and the arrival of the ''Socializing'' mode coincided with the [[Age of Enlightenment]], which began in the late 18th century.

Earlier forms of childrearing coexist with later modes, even in the most advanced countries.  An example of this are reports of [[Sex-selective abortion|selective abortion]] (and sometimes [[Sex-selective abortion and infanticide|exposure of baby girls]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gendercide.org/case_infanticide.html Female Infanticide]&lt;/ref&gt; especially in [[China]], [[Korea]], [[Taiwan]], [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], [[India]], [[Pakistan]], New Guinea, and many other developing countries in [[Asia]] and [[North Africa]],&lt;ref&gt;A. Gettis, J. Getis, and J. D. Fellmann (2004). ''Introduction to Geography, Ninth Edition''. New York:  McGraw-Hill, pp. 200f.&lt;/ref&gt;  regions in which  millions of women are "missing".&lt;ref&gt;Goodkind, Daniel. (1999). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2584811 Should Prenatal Sex Selection be Restricted?: Ethical Questions and Their Implications for Research and Policy]. ''Population Studies, 53 (1),'' 49-61.&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict of new and old psychoclasses is also highlighted in psychohistorians' thought. This is reflected in political contrasts – for instance, in the clash between [[Democratic party (United States)|Blue State]] and [[Republican party (United States)|Red State]] voters in the contemporary United States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dervin | first = Dan | title = George W. Bush's Second Term: Saving the World, Saving the Country | journal = [[Journal of Psychohistory]] | volume = 33 | pages = 117–124 | year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = deMause | first = Lloyd | title = [Book review of] Jonathan Schell's ''The Seventh Decade'' | journal = Journal of Psychohistory | volume = 35 | pages = 308–309 | year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; – and in civil wars.

Another key psychohistorical concept is that of ''group fantasy'', which deMause regards as a mediating force between a psychoclass's collective childhood experiences (and the psychic conflicts emerging therefrom), and the psychoclass's behavior in politics, religion and other aspects of social life.&lt;ref name="EMOL"&gt;{{cite book

===A psychoclass for postmodern times===

According to the psychogenic theory, since [[Neanderthal man]] most tribes and families practiced infanticide, child mutilation, incest and beating of their children throughout prehistory and history.  Presently the Western socializing mode of childrearing is considered much less abusive in the field, though this mode is not yet entirely free of abuse. In the opening paragraph of his seminal essay "The Evolution of Childhood" (first article in ''The History of Childhood''), DeMause states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The history of childhood is a nightmare from which we have only recently begun to awaken.  The further back in history one goes, the lower the level of childcare, and the more likely children are to be killed, abandoned, beaten, terrorized and sexually abused.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is notwithstanding an optimistic trait in the field. In a world of "helping mode" parents, deMause believes, violence of any other sort will disappear as well, along with [[magical thinking]], mental disorders, wars and other inhumanities of man against man. Although, the criticism has been made that this itself is a form of magical thinking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://primal-page.com/ps4.htm The evolution of psyche and society] – deMause's explanatory chapter of ''The Emotional Life of Nations'' (op. cit.).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
There are no departments dedicated to "psychohistory" in any institution of higher learning, although some history departments have run courses in it. Psychohistory remains a [[Controversy|controversial]] field of study, facing criticism in the academic community,&lt;ref name="OnWriting"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Stannard, David E. |title=Shrinking History: On Freud and the Failure of Psychohistory |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |location= |year=1982 |pages= |isbn=0-19-503044-3 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pomper |first=Philip  |year=1973 |title=Problems of a Naturalistic Psychohistory  |journal=History and Theory |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=367–388 |doi=10.2307/2504699|jstor=2504699}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Paul  | first = Robert A.  | title = Review of Lloyd deMause's Foundations of Psychohistory  | journal = Journal of Psychoanalytic Anthropology  | volume = 5  | pages = 469  | year = 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; with critics referring to it as a [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hunt |first=Lynn |editor=Kramer Lloyd S. and Maza, Sarah C.|title=A Companion to Western Historical Thought |url=https://books.google.com/?id=E2eKDjo4B_IC&amp;pg=PA339&amp;lpg=PA339&amp;dq=psychohistory+is+a+pseudoscience |year=2002 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |isbn=0-631-21714-2 |pages=337–357 |chapter=Psychology, Pschoanalysis and Historical Thought -The Misfortunes of Psychohistory }}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychohistory uses a plurality of methodologies, and it is difficult to determine which is appropriate to use in each circumstance.

DeMause has received criticism on several levels. His formulations have been criticized for being insufficiently supported by credible research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Demos  | first = John  | title = "Child Abuse in Context: An Historian's Perspective". In ''Past, Present and Personal: The Family and The Life Course in American History''  | publisher = Oxford University Press  | year = 1986  | location = NY  | pages = 68–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also received criticism for being a strong proponent of the "black legend" view of childhood history (i.e. that the history of childhood was above all a history of progress, with children being far more often badly mistreated in the past).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Aries  | first = Philippe  | title = De l'enfant roi a l'enfant martyr  | journal = Revue Psychologie  | volume = 68  | pages = 6  | year = 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, his work has been called a history of child abuse, not childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Heywood  | first = Colin  | title = A History of Childhood  | publisher = Polity Press  | year = 2001  | location = Cambridge  | pages = 41}}&lt;/ref&gt; The grim perspective of childhood history is known from other sources, e.g. Edward Shorter's ''The Making of the Modern Family'' and [[Lawrence Stone]]'s ''The Family, Sex and Marriage in England 1500-1800''. However, deMause received criticism for his repeated, detailed descriptions on childhood atrocities:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The reader is doubtless already familiar with examples of these psychohistorical "abuses." There is a significant difference, however, between the well-meaning and serious, if perhaps simplistic and reductionistic, attempt to understand the psychological in history and the psychohistorical expose that can at times verge on historical pornography. For examples of the more frivolous and distasteful sort of psychohistory, see ''[[Journal of Psychohistory]]''. For more serious and scholarly attempts to understand the psychological dimension of the past, see ''The Psychohistory Review''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Kohut  | first = Thomas A.  | title = Psychohistory as History  | jstor = 1858137  | journal = The American Historical Review  | volume = 91  | issue = 2  | pages = 336–354  | year = 1986  | doi = 10.2307/1858137  | pmid = 11611943}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Recent psychohistory has also been criticized for being overly-entangled with DeMause, whose theories are not representative of the entire field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://users.ids.net/~marcom/historint/hi-methodnotes.html   |title=Historical Sources On Line - A weblography  of  Historical Sources on the Internet |author=Marc Comtois | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312061651/http://users.ids.net/~marcom/historint/hi-methodnotes.html|archivedate=March 12, 2008|deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Institute for Psychohistory'' was founded by [[Lloyd deMause]]. It has 19 branches around the globe and has for over 30 years published the ''[[Journal of Psychohistory]]''. Also the ''International Psychohistorical Association'' was founded by Lloyd deMause (in 1977) as a professional organization for the field of psychohistory. It publishes ''Psychohistory News'' and has a psychohistorical mail order lending library. The association hosts an annual convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website |title= Conference and Membership |url= http://www.psychohistory.us/conference-and-membership.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Psychohistory Forum'', publishes the quarterly journal ''Clio’s Psyche''.  It was founded in 1983 by historian and psychoanalyst Paul H. Elovitz. This organization of academics, therapists, and laypeople holds regular scholarly meetings in New York City and at international conventions. It also sponsors an [http://groups.google.com/group/cliospsyche online discussion group].

In Germany, scientists taking an interest in psychohistory met annually since 1987. In 1992, the ''Gesellschaft für Psychohistorie und politische Psychologie e.V'' (“Society for Psychohistory and Political Psychology”) was founded. This society issues the ''Jahrbuch für Psychohistorische Forschung'' (“Annual of Psychohistorical Research”)

The team's composition is a reflection of the [[History of South Africa (1994–present)|New South Africa]] racial integration policies]]
'''Racial integration''', or simply '''integration''', includes [[desegregation]] (the process of ending systematic [[racial segregation]]). In addition to desegregation, integration includes goals such as leveling barriers to association, creating [[equal opportunity]] regardless of [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], and the development of a [[culture]] that draws on diverse traditions, rather than merely bringing a racial [[minority group|minority]] into the [[majority]] culture. Desegregation is largely a legal matter, integration largely a social one.

==Distinguishing ''integration'' from ''desegregation''==
[[File:Nch children parade.jpg|thumb|right|200px| A white child and black child together at a parade in [[North College Hill, Ohio]], USA]]
Morris J. MacGregor, Jr. in his paper "Integration of the Armed Forces 1940-1969" writes concerning the words ''integration'' and ''desegregation'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;...In recent years many historians have come to distinguish between these like-sounding words.. The movement toward desegregation, breaking down the nation's [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] system, became increasingly popular in the decade after [[World War II]]. Integration, on the other hand, Professor [[Oscar Handlin]] maintains, implies several things not yet necessarily accepted in all areas of American society. In one sense it refers to the "levelling of all barriers to association other than those based on ability, taste, and personal preference";&lt;ref name="MacGregor"&gt;Morris J. MacGregor, Jr. [http://www.history.army.mil/books/integration/IAF-FM.htm Integration of the Armed Forces 1940-1965] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100721102246/http://www.history.army.mil/books/integration/iaf-fm.htm |date=2010-07-21 }}, [[United States Army Center of Military History]], Washington D.C. (1985).  The linked copy is on the Army's official site. The Handlin quote is footnoted within the MacGregor piece as Oscar Handlin, "The Goals of Integration", Daedalus 95 (Winter 1966): 270.&lt;/ref&gt; in other words, providing equal opportunity. But in another sense integration calls for the random distribution of a minority throughout society. Here, according to Handlin, the emphasis is on racial balance in areas of occupation, education, residency, and the like.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;From the beginning the military establishment rightly understood that the breakup of the all-black unit would in a closed society necessarily mean more than mere desegregation. It constantly used the terms integration and equal treatment and opportunity to describe its racial goals. Rarely, if ever, does one find the word desegregation in military files that include much correspondence.&lt;ref name="MacGregor"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Similarly, Keith M. Woods writing on the need for precision in [[journalism|journalistic]] language writes, "''Integration'' happens when a monolith is changed, like when a black family moves into an all-white neighborhood. Integration happens even without a mandate from the law. ''Desegregation''," on the other hand, "was the legal remedy to segregation."&lt;ref&gt;Keith M. Woods,  [http://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=58&amp;aid=60326 Disentangling Desegregation Discourse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041009204314/http://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=58&amp;aid=60326 |date=2004-10-09 }}, Poynter Online, February 3, 2004. Accessed March 26, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Making almost the same point, Henry Organ, identifying himself as " a participant in the Civil Rights Movement on the ([[San Francisco Peninsula|San Francisco]]) Peninsula in the '60s... and ... an African American," wrote in 1997, " The term 'desegregation' is normally reserved to the legal/legislative domain, and it was the legalization of discrimination in public institutions based on race that many fought against in the 1960s. The term 'integration,' on the other hand, pertains to a social domain; it does and should refer to individuals of different background who opt to interact."&lt;ref&gt;Henry Organ, [http://www.paloaltoonline.com/weekly/morgue/spectrum/1997_Aug_13.GUEST130.html The true definition of integration], ''Palo Alto Weekly'', August 13, 1997. Accessed March 26, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In their book ''By the Color of Our Skin'' (1999) [[Leonard Steinhorn]] and Barbara Diggs-Brown - who also make a similar distinction between ''desegregation'' and ''integration'' - write "... television has... give[n] white Americans the sensation of having meaningful, repeated contact with blacks without actually having it. We call this phenomenon virtual integration, and it is the primary reason why the integration illusion - the belief that we are moving toward a colorblind nation - has such a powerful influence on race relations in America today." Reviewing this book in the [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] magazine ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'', Michael W. Lynch sums up some of their conclusions as, "Blacks and whites live, learn, work, pray, play, and entertain separately." He cites Stephan and Abigail Themstrom's ''America in Black and White'' as making the case to the contrary, gives anecdotal evidence on both sides of the question, and writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The problem, as I see it, is that access to the public spheres, specifically the commercial sphere, often depends on being comfortable with the norms of white society. If a significant number of black children aren't comfortable with them, it isn't by choice: It's because they were isolated from those norms. It's one thing for members of the black elite and upper middle class to choose to retire to predominantly black neighborhoods after a lucrative day's work in white America.

===Distinction not universally accepted===
{{Discrimination sidebar}}
Although widespread, this distinction between ''integration'' and ''desegregation'' is not universally accepted. For example, it is possible to find references to "court-ordered integration"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.comGFHJUKJMHVCNGHNJGJ6EYT5Y56 7Y65NU87 5XZS/search?q=%22court-ordered+integration%22&amp;num=20&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;safe=off] Google search for "court-ordered integration".&lt;/ref&gt; from sources such as the ''[[Detroit News]]'',&lt;ref name="Detroit"&gt;Ron French, Brad Heath, and Christine MacDonald, [http://www.detnews.com/2004/specialreport/0405/16/a01-153972.htm Metro classrooms remain separate, often unequal], ''[[Detroit News]]'', May 16, 2002. Accessed March 26, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/wallace/timeline/index_2.html Timeline of George Wallace's Life], [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]. Accessed March 26, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; or even [[Encarta]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761554032_4/Eisenhower.html Eisenhower] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060514175216/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761554032_4/Eisenhower.html |date=2006-05-14 }} (part 4), MSN [[Encarta]]. 0_0Accessed March 26, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
These same sources also use the phrase "court-ordered desegregation", apparently with exactly the same meaning;&lt;ref&gt;
[https://www.pbs.org/beyondbrown/history/factsheet_history.html The Evolution of Brown v. Board of Education], part of ''Beyond Brown'', PBS. Accessed March 26, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://encarta.msn.com/sidebar_761594304/President_Kennedy_Expresses_Outrage_at_Alabama_Deaths.html President Kennedy Expresses Outrage at Alabama Deaths] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040926053701/http://encarta.msn.com/sidebar_761594304/President_Kennedy_Expresses_Outrage_at_Alabama_Deaths.html |date=2004-09-26 }} (sidebar), MSN Encarta. (Premium content.) Accessed March 26, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Detroit News'' uses both expressions interchangeably in the same article.&lt;ref name="Detroit"/&gt;

When the two terms are confused, it is almost always to use ''integration'' in the narrower, more legalistic sense of ''desegregation''; one rarely, if ever, sees ''desegregation'' used in the broader cultural sense.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1885">The '''Religious Experience Research Centre''' was founded by the distinguished marine biologist Professor [[Alister Hardy]] FRS in 1969 as The Religious Experience Research Unit. He and his co-researchers began to gather a unique archive of accounts of [[religious experience]] and to publish research into the area. The maintenance of both the archives and the research and publications have continued. The Centre organises conferences and produces both books and a series of Occasional Papers on religious experience and spirituality.

Sir Alister was awarded the ''[[Templeton Prize]] for Progress In Religion'' in 1985 and the Centre has since received a grant from the Templeton Foundation for the computerisation of the archives. The Centre was located at [[Manchester College, Oxford]] from 1969-1989 and from 1989–1999 at [[Westminster College, Oxford]]. In 2000 the Centre moved to the [[University of Wales, Lampeter]]
(presently University of Wales, Trinity Saint David). 

The directors of the Centre are currently Greg Barker, Bettina Schmidt and Sally Wilkinson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tsd.ac.uk/en/lrc/librariesandcentres/alisterhardyreligiousexperienceresearchcentre/contacts/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328113909/http://www.tsd.ac.uk/en/lrc/librariesandcentres/alisterhardyreligiousexperienceresearchcentre/contacts/ |archivedate=2012-03-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4499">'''Resource justice''' (also referred to as "'''resource equity'''" or "'''resource governance'''") is a term in [[environmentalism]] and in [[environmental ethics]]. It combines elements of [[distributive justice]] and [[climate justice]] and is based on the observation that many countries rich in [[natural resource]]s such as [[mineral]]s and other [[raw material]]s nevertheless experience high levels of poverty. This [[resource curse]] is one of the main ethical reasons to demand resource justice, that is, a globally fair distribution of all natural resources.

== Factors leading to resource injustice ==

[[File:2014 Gini Index World Map, income inequality distribution by country per World Bank.svg|thumb|500px| Countries' income inequality according to their [[Gini coefficient]] – red = high, green = low inequality (World Bank, 2014)]]
The term resource justice as a subcategory of distributive justice was first developed following the repeated observation that natural resources that, supposedly, are a blessing for local populations, turn out to be a curse. This can manifest itself in a number of ways – and for a number of reasons, some of which occur in isolation but more often arise together. Some examples are:
* [[Surface mining|Mining]] or [[Oil well|oil drilling]] result in severe damage to the environment, for example through [[oil spill]]s, [[environmental degradation]], or [[Pollution|contamination]].
* The extraction of resources leads to extreme forms of [[exploitation of labour]] and / or creates very [[Work accident|hazardous working conditions]].
* Resources are being controlled by a small elite that makes or embezzles all the profits. This often goes along with [[corruption]].
* People are forced off their land to make place for resource extraction or for large [[Monoculture|monocultural]] plantations.
* Resources in the developing world are being extracted by companies from industrialised countries, with most of the profits going to the latter.
* Companies extract genetic material, which is then commercially farmed or bred – and often [[Biological patent|patented]].

== Approaches towards greater resource justice ==

[[Capacity building]] and external support in order to empower "communities affected by oil, gas, and mining operations" so that they themselves  are able to determine how local resources are being used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfamamerica.org/take-action/campaign/natural-resource-justice/ Natural Resource Justice], [[Oxfam]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://namati.org/lawyers-for-resource-justice/ Lawyers for Resource Justice]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, mechanisms have to be developed to make sure that finite resources are distributed in an equitable way so that poor nations' right to development is not denied.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books/about/Fair_Future.html?id=_l9U7olOSA0C Wolfgang Sachs, Tilman Santarius, Fair Future: Limited Resources and Global Justice]&lt;/ref&gt; 
The memorandum Resource Politics for a Fair Future, published by the [[Heinrich Böll Foundation]] lists three criteria for a "fair and sustainable Resource Politics", namely:
* to "secure the rights of people and nature over markets and profits" and empower them to demand their rights;
* to return the "control over natural resources, financial capital and technologies (...) into the hands of the people;
* to "transform production, consumption and livelihoods" in ways that enable people to live in a world of glbal equity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.boell.de/sites/default/files/resource-politics_for-a-fair_future.pdf Resource Politics for a Fair Future, p.12-13], PDF, Berlin 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11119">{{short description|The area of sea ice relative to the total area at a given point in the ocean}}
'''Sea ice concentration''' is a useful variable for [[climatology|climate]]
scientists and nautical [[navigators]].  It is defined as the area of
[[sea ice]] relative to the total at a given point in the [[ocean]].
This article will deal primarily with its determination from [[remote sensing]] measurements.

==Significance==

Sea ice concentration helps determine a number of other important climate
variables.  Since the [[albedo]] of ice is much higher than that of water,
ice concentration will regulate [[insolation]] in the polar oceans.
When combined with [[sea ice thickness|ice thickness]], it determines
several other important [[flux]]es between the air and sea,
such as salt and fresh-water fluxes between the polar oceans
(see for instance [[bottom water]]) as well as
[[heat flux|heat transfer]] between the atmosphere.
Maps of sea ice concentration can be used to determine
[[Measurement of sea ice#ice area|ice area]] and
[[Measurement of sea ice#ice extent|ice extent]], both of which are important
markers of [[climate change]].

Ice concentration charts are also used by navigators to determine
potentially passable regions—see [[icebreaker]].

==Methods==

===In situ===

Measurements from ships and aircraft are based on simply calculating
the relative area of ice versus water visible within the scene.
This can be done using photographs or by eye.
In situ measurements are used to validate remote sensing
measurements.

===SAR and visible===

Both [[synthetic aperture radar]] and visible sensors (such as [[Landsat]])
are normally high enough resolution that each pixel is simply classified
as a distinct surface type, i.e. water versus ice.  The concentration can then be
determined by counting the number of ice pixels in a given area which
is useful for validating concentration estimates from lower resolution
instruments such as microwave radiometers.  Since SAR images are normally
monochrome and the [[backscatter]] of ice can vary quite considerably,
classification is normally done based on texture using groups of
pixels—see [[pattern recognition]].

Visible sensors have the disadvantage of being quite weather sensitive—images are obscured by clouds—while SAR sensors, especially in the
higher resolution modes, have a limited coverage and must be pointed.
This is why the tool of choice for determining ice concentration is
often a passive microwave sensor.

===Microwave radiometry===
[[File:Oldest Arctic Sea Ice is Disappearing.png|left|thumb|Arctic sea ice coverage in 1980 (bottom) and 2012 (top), as observed by passive microwave sensors on NASA’s Nimbus-7 satellite and by the Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS) from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP). Multi-year ice is shown in bright white, while average sea ice cover is shown in light blue to milky white. The data shows the ice cover for the period of 1 November through 31 January in their respective years.]]
All warm bodies emit electro-magnetic radiation: see [[thermal radiation]].
Since different objects will emit differently at different frequencies,
we can often determine what type of object we are looking at based on its emitted
radiation—see [[spectroscopy]].  This principle underlies all ''passive''
microwave sensors and most passive infrared sensors.  Passive is used in the
sense that the sensor only measures radiation that has been emitted by other
objects but does not emit any of its own.
(A SAR sensor, by contrast, is ''active''.) [[SSMR]] and [[SSMI]] radiometers were flown on the [[Nimbus program]] and [[Defense Meteorological Satellite Program|DMSP]] series of satellites.

Because clouds are translucent in the microwave regime, especially
at lower frequencies, microwave radiometers are quite weather insensitive.
Since most microwave radiometers operate along a [[polar orbit]] with
a broad, sweeping scan, full ice maps of the polar regions where
the swaths are largely overlapping can usually be obtained within one day.
This frequency and reliability comes at the cost of a poor resolution:
the angular [[field of view]] of an [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] is directly
[[proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the [[wavelength]]
and inversely proportional to the effective [[aperture]] area.
Thus we need a large deflector dish to compensate for a low frequency
.&lt;ref name="Ulaby_etal1986"/&gt;

Most ice concentration algorithms based on microwave radiometry
are predicated on the dual observation that: 1. different surface types
have different, strongly clustered, microwave signatures and
2. the radiometric signature at the instrument head is a linear
combination of that of the different surface types, with the weights
taking on the values of the relative concentrations.
If we form a vector space from each of the instrument channels
in which all but one of the signatures of the different surface types
are linearly independent, then it is straightforward to solve for
the relative concentrations:

:&lt;math&gt;
\vec T_b = \vec T_{b0} + \sum_{i=1}^n(\vec T_{bi} - \vec T_{b0})C_i
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\vec T_b&lt;/math&gt; is the radiometric signature at the
instrument head (normally measured as a [[brightness temperature]]),
&lt;math&gt;\vec T_{b0}&lt;/math&gt; is the signature of the nominal
background surface type (normally water),
&lt;math&gt;\vec T_{bi}&lt;/math&gt; is the signature of the ''i''th
surface type while ''C&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the relative
concentrations.

Every operational ice concentration algorithm is predicated on this
principle or a slight variation.
The NASA team algorithm, for instance, works by taking the
difference of two channels and dividing by their sum.
This makes the retrieval slightly [[nonlinear]], but with
the advantage that the influence of temperature is mitigated.
This is because brightness temperature varies roughly linearly
with physical temperature when all other things are equal—see [[emissivity]]—and because the sea ice emissivity at different microwave
channels is strongly correlated.&lt;ref name="Rothrock_etal1988"/&gt;
As the equation suggests, concentrations of multiple ice
types can potentially be detected, with NASA team distinguishing between
first-year and multi-year ice (see image above).

Accuracies of sea ice concentration derived from passive microwave sensors may be expected to be on the order of 5\% (absolute).

A number of factors act to reduce the accuracy of the retrievals, the most obvious being variations in the microwave signatures produced by a given surface type.
For sea ice, the presence of snow, variations in salt and moisture content, the presence of melt ponds as well as variations in surface temperature will all produce strong variations in the microwave signature of a given ice type.  New and thin ice in particular will often have a microwave signature closer to that of open water.  This is normally because of its high salt content, not because of radiation being transmitted from the water through the ice—see [[sea ice emissivity modelling]].
The presence of waves and surface roughness will change the signature over open water.  Adverse weather conditions, [[clouds]] and [[humidity]] in particular, will also tend to reduce the accuracy of retrievals.&lt;ref name="smos_final"/&gt;

{{Computer hacking}}
A '''security hacker''' is someone who seeks to breach defenses and [[Exploit (computer security)|exploit]] weaknesses in a [[Computer|computer system]] or [[computer network|network]]. Hackers may be motivated by a multitude of reasons, such as profit, protest, information gathering,&lt;ref&gt;Winkler, Ira. ''Spies Among Us: How to Stop the Spies, Terrorists, Hackers, and Criminals You Don't Even Know You Encounter Every Day.''

The subculture that has evolved around hackers is often referred to as the computer underground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Blomquist|first=Brian|date=May 29, 1999|url=http://archive.nypost.com/a/475198|title=FBI's Web Site Socked as Hackers Target Feds|newspaper=New York Post}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- historical precedent, takes precedence --&gt;

There is a longstanding [[Hacker|controversy]] about the term's true meaning. In this controversy, the term ''hacker'' is reclaimed by [[Hacker (programmer subculture)|computer programmers]] who argue that it refers simply to someone with an advanced understanding of computers and computer networks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jargon-file.org/archive/jargon-1.5.0.dos.txt|title= The Hacker's Dictionary|accessdate=23 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and that '''''cracker''''' is the more appropriate term for those who break into computers, whether computer criminal ([[#Black hat|black hats]]) or computer security expert ([[White hat (computer security)|white hats]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://stallman.org/archives/2012-sep-dec.html#06_December_2012_%28Ecuadorian_white_hat_cracker_freed%29 Political notes from 2012: September–December]. stallman.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://catb.org/jargon/html/C/cracker.html |title=Jargon File: Cracker |first=Eric S. |last=Raymond |quote=Coined ca. 1985 by hackers in defense against journalistic misuse of hacker }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 article concluded that "... the black-hat meaning still prevails among the general public".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Yagoda |first1=Ben |title=A Short History of "Hack"|url=http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/a-short-history-of-hack |work=The New Yorker |date=6 March 2014 |accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{tone inline|date=August 2016}}

==History==
{{Further|Timeline of computer security hacker history}}
[[File:Stering.jpg|thumb|[[Bruce Sterling]], author of ''[[The Hacker Crackdown]]'']]
In computer security, a hacker is someone who focuses on security mechanisms of computer and network systems. While including those who endeavor to strengthen such mechanisms, it is more often used by the [[mass media]] and popular culture to refer to those who seek access despite these security measures. That is, the media portrays the 'hacker' as a villain. Nevertheless, parts of the subculture see their aim in correcting security problems and use the word in a positive sense. White hat is the name given to ethical computer hackers, who utilize hacking in a helpful way. White hats are becoming a necessary part of the information security field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Caldwell|first=Tracey|title=Ethical hackers: putting on the white hat|journal=Network Security|date=22 July 2011|volume=2011|issue=7|pages=10–13|doi=10.1016/s1353-4858(11)70075-7}}&lt;!--|accessdate=29 March 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They operate under a code, which acknowledges that breaking into other people's computers is bad, but that discovering and exploiting security mechanisms and breaking into computers is still an interesting activity that can be done ethically and legally. Accordingly, the term bears strong connotations that are favorable or pejorative, depending on the context.

The subculture around such hackers is termed network hacker subculture, hacker scene, or computer underground. It initially developed in the context of [[phreaking]] during the 1960s and the microcomputer [[Bulletin board system|BBS scene]] of the 1980s. It is implicated with ''[[2600: The Hacker Quarterly]]'' and the ''[[alt.2600]]'' newsgroup.

In 1980, an article in the August issue of ''[[Psychology Today]]'' (with commentary by [[Philip Zimbardo]]) used the term "hacker" in its title: "The Hacker Papers". It was an excerpt from a Stanford Bulletin Board discussion on the addictive nature of computer use. In the 1982 film ''[[Tron]]'', Kevin Flynn ([[Jeff Bridges]]) describes his intentions to break into ENCOM's computer system, saying "I've been doing a little hacking here". CLU is the [[software]] he uses for this. By 1983, hacking in the sense of breaking computer security had already been in use as computer jargon,&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://www.catb.org/jargon/oldversions/jarg1-81-MM-DD.txt 1981 version of the ''Jargon File''], entry "hacker", last meaning.&lt;/ref&gt; but there was no public awareness about such activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Computer hacking: Where did it begin and how did it grow?|publisher=WindowSecurity.com|date=October 16, 2002|url=http://www.windowsecurity.com/whitepapers/Computer_hacking_Where_did_it_begin_and_how_did_it_grow_.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the release of the film ''[[WarGames]]'' that year, featuring a computer intrusion into [[NORAD]], raised the public belief that computer security hackers (especially teenagers) could be a threat to national security. This concern became real when, in the same year, a gang of teenage hackers in [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], known as [[The 414s]], broke into computer systems throughout the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], including those of [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], [[Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center|Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center]] and [[Security Pacific Bank]].&lt;ref name = "drzmzu"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Elmer-DeWitt|first=Philip|title=The 414 Gang Strikes Again|newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|page=75|date=August 29, 1983|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,949797,00.html|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case quickly grew media attention,&lt;ref name = "drzmzu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|newspaper=[[Detroit Free Press]]|date=September 27, 1983|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 17-year-old Neal Patrick emerged as the spokesman for the gang, including a cover story in ''[[Newsweek]]'' entitled "Beware: Hackers at play", with Patrick's photograph on the cover.&lt;ref name = "iophas"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Beware: Hackers at play|newspaper=Newsweek|pages=42–46, 48|date=September 5, 1983|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Newsweek'' article appears to be the first use of the word ''hacker'' by the mainstream media in the pejorative sense.

Pressured by media coverage, congressman [[Dan Glickman]] called for an investigation and began work on new laws against computer hacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A50606-2002Jun26.html|accessdate=2006-04-14|title=Timeline: The U.S. Government and Cybersecurity | date=2003-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated180"&gt;David Bailey, "Attacks on Computers: Congressional Hearings and Pending Legislation," sp, p. 180, 1984 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;
Neal Patrick testified before the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] on September 26, 1983, about the dangers of computer hacking, and six bills concerning computer crime were introduced in the House that year.&lt;ref name="autogenerated180"/&gt; As a result of these laws against computer criminality, white hat, [[grey hat]] and black hat hackers try to distinguish themselves from each other, depending on the legality of their activities. These moral conflicts are expressed in [[Loyd Blankenship|The Mentor]]'s "[[The Hacker Manifesto]]", published 1986 in ''[[Phrack]]''.

Use of the term hacker meaning computer criminal was also advanced by the title "Stalking the Wily Hacker", an article by [[Clifford Stoll]] in the May 1988 issue of the ''[[Communications of the ACM]]''. Later that year, the release by [[Robert Tappan Morris, Jr.]] of the so-called [[Morris worm]] provoked the popular media to spread this usage. The popularity of Stoll's book ''[[The Cuckoo's Egg]]'', published one year later, further entrenched the term in the public's consciousness.

==Classifications==
Several subgroups of the computer underground with different attitudes use different terms to demarcate themselves from each other, or try to exclude some specific group with whom they do not agree.

[[Eric S. Raymond]], author of ''[[Jargon File|The New Hacker's Dictionary]]'', advocates that members of the computer underground should be called crackers. Yet, those people see themselves as hackers and even try to include the views of Raymond in what they see as a wider hacker culture, a view that Raymond has harshly rejected. Instead of a hacker/cracker dichotomy, they emphasize a spectrum of different categories, such as [[white hat (computer security)|white hat]], [[grey hat]], [[#Black hat|black hat]] and [[script kiddie]]. In contrast to Raymond, they usually reserve the term ''cracker'' for more malicious activity.

According to Ralph D. Clifford, a ''cracker'' or ''cracking'' is to "gain unauthorized access to a computer in order to commit another crime such as destroying information contained in that system".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These subgroups may also be defined by the legal status of their activities.&lt;ref name="hacker hats" /&gt;

===White hat===
{{Main article|White_hat_(computer_security)|l1=White hat}}
A [[white hat (computer security)|white hat hacker]] breaks security for non-malicious reasons, either to test their own security system, perform [[penetration test]]s, or [[vulnerability assessment]]s for a client - or while working for a security company which makes security software. The term is generally synonymous with [[Hacker ethic|ethical hacker]], and the EC-Council,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eccouncil.org/ EC-Council]. eccouncil.org&lt;/ref&gt; among others, have developed certifications, courseware, classes, and online training covering the diverse arena of ethical hacking.&lt;ref name="hacker hats"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilhelm |first=Douglas |title=Professional Penetration Testing |year=2010 |publisher=Syngress Press |isbn=978-1-59749-425-0 |page=503 |chapter=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Black hat===
{{Main article|Black hat}}
A "black hat" hacker is a hacker who "violates computer security for little reason beyond maliciousness or for personal gain" (Moore, 2005).&lt;ref name="Moore2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Robert|title=Cybercrime: Investigating High Technology Computer Crime|year=2005|publisher=Matthew Bender &amp; Company|isbn=1-59345-303-5|page=258}}Robert Moore&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by [[Richard Stallman]], to contrast the maliciousness of a criminal hacker versus the spirit of playfulness and exploration in [[hacker culture]], or the ethos of the [[white hat hacker]] who performs hacking duties to identify places to repair or as a means of legitimate employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Brien, Marakas|first=James, George|title=Management Information Systems |year=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill/ Irwin|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-07-752217-9|pages=536–537}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black hat hackers form the stereotypical, illegal hacking groups often portrayed in popular culture, and are "the epitome of all that the public fears in a computer criminal".&lt;ref name="moore2006"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grey hat===
{{Main article|Grey hat}}
A grey hat hacker lies between a black hat and a white hat hacker. A grey hat hacker may surf the Internet and hack into a computer system for the sole purpose of notifying the administrator that their system has a security defect, for example. They may then offer to correct the defect for a fee.&lt;ref name="moore2006" /&gt; Grey hat hackers sometimes find the defect of a system and publish the facts to the world instead of a group of people. Even though grey hat hackers may not necessarily perform hacking for their personal gain, unauthorized access to a system can be considered illegal and unethical.

===Elite hacker===
A [[achieved status|social status]] among hackers, ''elite'' is used to describe the most skilled.&lt;!--p. 117--&gt; Newly discovered [[exploit (computer security)|exploits]] circulate among these hackers.&lt;!--p. 86 --&gt; Elite [[hacker group|groups]] such as [[Masters of Deception]] conferred a kind of credibility on their members.&lt;!-- p. 90 --&gt;&lt;ref name="thomas2002"&gt;{{cite book

===Script kiddie===
A [[script kiddie]] (also known as a ''skid'' or ''skiddie'') is an unskilled hacker who breaks into computer systems by using automated tools written by others (usually by other black hat hackers), hence the term script (i.e. a prearranged plan or set of activities) kiddie (i.e. kid, child—an individual lacking knowledge and experience, immature),&lt;ref name="Andress 10"&gt;{{cite book |title=CIW Security Professional |last=Andress |first=Mandy |author2=Cox, Phil |author3=Tittel, Ed  |year=2001 |publisher=Wiley|location=New York, NY |isbn=0-7645-4822-0 |page=638}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually with little understanding of the underlying concept.

===Hacktivist===
A hacktivist is a hacker who utilizes technology to publicize a social, ideological, religious or political message.

[[Hacktivism]] can be divided into two main groups:
* [[Cyberterrorism]]&amp;nbsp;— Activities involving [[website defacement]] or [[denial-of-service attack]]s; and,
* [[Freedom of information]]&amp;nbsp;— Making information that is not public, or is public in non-machine-readable formats, accessible to the public.

==Attacks==
{{Main article|Computer security}}
{{Computer security}}

A typical approach in an attack on Internet-connected system is:
# [[Network enumeration]]: Discovering information about the intended target.
# [[Vulnerability (computing)|Vulnerability analysis]]: Identifying potential ways of attack.
# [[Exploit (computer security)|Exploitation]]: Attempting to compromise the system by employing the vulnerabilities found through the vulnerability analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Gupta, Ajay; Klavinsky, Thomas and Laliberte, Scott
(March 15, 2002) [http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=25916 Security Through Penetration Testing: Internet Penetration]. informit.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to do so, there are several recurring tools of the trade and techniques used by computer criminals and security experts.

===Security exploits===
{{Main article|Exploit (computer security)}}

A security exploit is a prepared application that takes advantage of a known weakness.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.htbridge.com/publication/the_growing_hacking_threat_to_websites.pdf |title=The Growing Hacking Threat to Websites: An Ongoing Commitment to Web Application Security |last1=Rodriguez |first1=Chris |last2=Martinez |first2=Richard |publisher=Frost &amp; Sullivan |accessdate=13 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common examples of security exploits are [[SQL injection]], [[cross-site scripting]] and [[cross-site request forgery]] which abuse security holes that may result from substandard programming practice. Other exploits would be able to be used through [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP), [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP), [[PHP]], [[Secure Shell|SSH]], [[Telnet]] and some Web pages. These are very common in Web site and Web domain hacking.

===Techniques===
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2011}}
;Vulnerability scanner
:A [[vulnerability scanner]] is a tool used to quickly check computers on a network for known weaknesses. Hackers also commonly use [[port scanner]]s. These check to see which ports on a specified computer are "open" or available to access the computer, and sometimes will detect what program or service is listening on that port, and its version number. ([[Firewall (computing)|Firewalls]] defend computers from intruders by limiting access to ports and machines, but they can still be circumvented.)

;Finding vulnerabilities
:Hackers may also attempt to find vulnerabilities manually. A common approach is to search for possible vulnerabilities in the code of the computer system then test them, sometimes [[reverse engineering]] the software if the code is not provided.

;Brute-force attack
:Password guessing. This method is very fast when used to check all short passwords, but for longer passwords other methods such as the dictionary attack are used, because of the time a brute-force search takes.&lt;ref&gt;Kerner, Sean Michael. "Sentry MBA Uses Credential Stuffing To Hack Sites." ''Eweek'' (2016): 8. ''Academic Search Complete''. Web. 7 Feb. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Password cracking
:[[Password cracking]] is the process of recovering passwords from data that has been stored in or transmitted by a computer system. Common approaches include repeatedly trying guesses for the password, trying the most common passwords by hand, and repeatedly trying passwords from a "dictionary", or a text file with many passwords.

;Packet analyzer
:A [[packet analyzer]] ("packet sniffer") is an application that captures data packets, which can be used to capture passwords and other [[data in transit]] over the network.

;Spoofing attack (phishing)
:A [[spoofing attack]] involves one program, system or website that successfully masquerades as another by falsifying data and is thereby treated as a trusted system by a user or another program&amp;nbsp;— usually to fool programs, systems or users into revealing confidential information, such as user names and passwords.

;Rootkit
:A [[rootkit]] is a program that uses low-level, hard-to-detect methods to subvert control of an operating system from its legitimate operators. Rootkits usually obscure their installation and attempt to prevent their removal through a subversion of standard system security. They may include replacements for system binaries, making it virtually impossible for them to be detected by checking [[Process (computing)|process tables]].

;Social engineering
:In the second stage of the targeting process, hackers often use [[Social engineering (security)|Social engineering]] tactics to get enough information to access the network. They may contact the system administrator and pose as a user who cannot get access to his or her system. This technique is portrayed in the 1995 film ''Hackers'', when protagonist Dade "Zero Cool" Murphy calls a somewhat clueless employee in charge of security at a television network. Posing as an accountant working for the same company, Dade tricks the employee into giving him the phone number of a modem so he can gain access to the company's computer system.

:Hackers who use this technique must have cool personalities, and be familiar with their target's security practices, in order to trick the system administrator into giving them information. In some cases, a help-desk employee with limited security experience will answer the phone and be relatively easy to trick. Another approach is for the hacker to pose as an angry supervisor, and when his/her authority is questioned, threaten to fire the help-desk worker. Social engineering is very effective, because users are the most vulnerable part of an organization. No security devices or programs can keep an organization safe if an employee reveals a password to an unauthorized person.

:Social engineering can be broken down into four sub-groups:
:* '''''Intimidation''''' As in the "angry supervisor" technique above, the hacker convinces the person who answers the phone that their job is in danger unless they help them. At this point, many people accept that the hacker is a supervisor and give them the information they seek.
:* '''''Helpfulness'''''  The opposite of intimidation, helpfulness exploits many people's natural instinct to help others solve problems. Rather than acting angry, the hacker acts distressed and concerned. The help desk is the most vulnerable to this type of social engineering, as (a.) its general purpose is to help people; and (b.) it usually has the authority to change or reset passwords, which is exactly what the hacker wants.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Samuel T. C. "Helping The Hacker? Library Information, Security, And Social Engineering." ''Information Technology &amp; Libraries'' 25.4 (2006): 222-225. ''Academic Search Complete''. Web. 7 Feb. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
:* '''''Name-dropping''''' The hacker uses names of authorized users to convince the person who answers the phone that the hacker is a legitimate user him or herself. Some of these names, such as those of webpage owners or company officers, can easily be obtained online. Hackers have also been known to obtain names by examining discarded documents ([[garbage picking|"dumpster diving"]]).
:* '''''Technical'''''  Using technology is also a way to get information. A hacker can send a fax or email to a legitimate user, seeking a response that contains vital information. The hacker may claim that he or she is involved in law enforcement and needs certain data for an investigation, or for record-keeping purposes.

;Trojan horses
:A [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan horse]] is a program that seems to be doing one thing but is actually doing another. It can be used to set up a [[Backdoor (computing)|back door]] in a computer system, enabling the intruder to gain access later. (The name refers to the [[Trojan Horse|horse]] from the [[Trojan War]], with the conceptually similar function of deceiving defenders into bringing an intruder into a protected area.)

;Computer virus
:A [[computer virus|virus]] is a self-replicating program that spreads by inserting copies of itself into other executable code or documents. By doing this, it behaves similarly to a [[Virus|biological virus]], which spreads by inserting itself into living cells. While some viruses are harmless or mere hoaxes, most are considered malicious.

;Computer worm
:Like a virus, a [[computer worm|worm]] is also a self-replicating program. It differs from a virus in that (a.) it propagates through computer networks without user intervention; and (b.) does not need to attach itself to an existing program. Nonetheless, many people use the terms "virus" and "worm" interchangeably to describe any self-propagating program.

;Keystroke logging
:A [[Keystroke logging|keylogger]] is a tool designed to record ("log") every keystroke on an affected machine for later retrieval, usually to allow the user of this tool to gain access to confidential information typed on the affected machine. Some keyloggers use virus-, trojan-, and rootkit-like methods to conceal themselves. However, some of them are used for legitimate purposes, even to enhance computer security. For example, a business may maintain a keylogger on a computer used at a [[point of sale]] to detect evidence of employee fraud.

;Attack patterns
:[[Attack patterns]] are defined as series of repeatable steps that can be applied to simulate an attack against the security of a system. They can be used for testing purposes or locating potential vulnerabilities. They also provide, either physically or in reference, a common solution pattern for preventing a given attack.

'''Tools and Procedures'''
:A thorough examination of hacker tools and procedures may be found in Cengage Learning's E|CSA certification workbook.&lt;ref name="E|CSA"&gt;{{cite book |title=Penetration Testing: Procedures &amp; Methodologies |last=Press |first=EC-Council |year=2011 |publisher=CENGAGE Learning|location=Clifton, NY |isbn=1435483677}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hacker groups and conventions===
{{Main article|Hacker conference|Hacker group}}

The computer underground is supported by regular real-world gatherings called [[hacker convention]]s or "hacker cons". These events include [[SummerCon]] (Summer), [[DEF CON]], [[HoHoCon]] (Christmas), [[ShmooCon]] (February), [[Black Hat Conference|BlackHat]], [[Chaos Communication Congress]], AthCon, Hacker Halted, and HOPE.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Local Hackfest groups organize and compete to develop their skills to send a team to a prominent convention to compete in group pentesting, exploit and forensics on a larger scale. Hacker groups became popular in the early 1980s, providing access to hacking information and resources and a place to learn from other members. Computer [[bulletin board systems]] (BBSs), such as the Utopias, provided platforms for information-sharing via dial-up modem. Hackers could also gain credibility by being affiliated with elite groups.&lt;ref name="thomas"/&gt;

'''Serosorting''', also known as "serodiscrimination", is the practice of using HIV status as a decision-making point in choosing [[Human sexual activity|sexual behavior]]. Frequently the term is used to describe the behavior of a person who chooses a sexual partner assumed to be of the same HIV [[serostatus]] in order to engage in [[Safe sex|unprotected sex]] with them for a reduced risk of acquiring or transmitting [[HIV/AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/topics/research/resources/other/serosorting.htm |title=Meeting Summary: "Consultation on Serosorting Practices among Men who Have Sex with Men" |date=31 March 2009 |work=cdc.gov |publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] |accessdate=2010-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knowledge of [[HIV status]] is based on the result of a person's [[HIV test]], with a positive result indicating that a person has HIV, and can potentially transmit the disease to others during any sexual contact involving an exchange of bodily fluids (e.g., unprotected anal or vaginal sex). There are many situations where determining their partner's serostatus outside of clinical settings cannot be done ''with complete certainty'', limiting the efficacy in mitigating the transmission of [[HIV/AIDS]] (or other [[Sexually transmitted disease|STDs]]). As people do not typically engage in sex practices with the expectation of contracting or transmitting HIV, failed attempts at serosorting are a leading cause of the contraction of HIV among partners.

==Terms and etymology==
The word '''''serosorting''''' comes from the Latin word ''serum'', which refers to [[blood serum]]. Sorting refers to choosing partners based on HIV status, which can be determined from blood tests, among other methods. '''[[Serodiscordant]] sex''' refers to sex between an HIV-positive person and an HIV-negative person; typically partners practicing serosorting make an attempt to find someone with a matching HIV test result, otherwise known as a '''seroconcordant''' partner.

==Risks associated with serosorting==

===Failure to accurately determine HIV status===
Failure to accurately determine HIV status may stem from people not being sure of their true HIV status (or not admitting to having [[HIV]])—even a recent negative result from an [[HIV test]] may not be definitive of a person's serostatus, because if they are still within the [[window period]] following a recent infection, the [[antibodies]] that the blood tests measure will not be present yet. In addition, testing negative for [[HIV]] does not guarantee that they are free of other [[sexually transmitted disease]]s (STDs) such as [[Human Papillomavirus|HPV]] or [[hepatitis B]].

However, the largest experiment with serosorting has been conducted in the [[adult film]] industry by the Adult Industry Medical Healthcare Foundation. The Adult Industry Medical testing program, or AIM, eliminates virtually all possibility of lying{{how|date=November 2013}} and enforces a high frequency of testing for a variety of STDs that can make the transmission of [[HIV]] more likely. All actors in legitimate adult films are tested twice a year for [[herpes]], [[gonorrhea]], [[chlamydia infection|chlamydia]], [[syphilis]], hepatitis types [[Hepatitis A|A]],&amp;nbsp;[[Hepatitis B|B]]&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;[[Hepatitis C|C]], and HIV—as well as monthly for HIV, gonorrhea, and chlamydia. Before this program of testing, adult film actors had a very high rate of STDs, but now have only a 20% higher rate of STDs than the general public.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===As a substitution for condom use===
Dr. Matthew Golden of King County Public Health, in Washington, conducted a study with sexually active West Coast men and concluded that the patient population did demonstrate limited protection from HIV by serosorting. In his study, 3.5% of the men that used neither condoms nor serosorting became HIV-positive, as compared to 2.6% of the men that practiced serosorting alone, and 1.5% of the men who reported consistent [[condom]] use without serosorting.

Golden's population differs from AIM's in that [[anal sex]] made up a high proportion of the subjects' sexual habits, their testing intervals were typically longer and less regular, there were no tests for STDs other than HIV, such as [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]] (an important factor considering other STDs may hasten the spread of the virus), and there were no protections against falsely reporting any of the results. Golden's study did not cover the use of serosorting combined with [[condoms]]—which, theoretically, would be more effective than either precaution used separately.&lt;ref name="Goldenstudy"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Golden, MR |author2=Stekler, J |author3=Hughes, JP |author4=Wood, RW |year=2008 |title=HIV serosorting in men who have sex with men: is it safe? |journal=[[Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes]] |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=212–8 |doi=10.1097/QAI.0b013e31818455e8 |pmid=18769346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disease exchange between seroconcordant people===
Serosorting does not fully protect against all STDs during [[unprotected sex]] between two people infected with HIV. Infection with ''one'' strain of HIV does not preclude later infection with ''another'' strain. There is a great deal of genetic variability within individual HIV populations, because this variability is shuffled and [[mutated]] every time the virus (numbering in the millions) reproduces inside the infected person's body. Modern drug cocktails keep virus and mutation levels low but eventually [[drug resistance]] will develop. Unprotected sex between two individuals positive for HIV still presents the risk of one of them—with a relatively less aggressive strain of the virus—exchanging genetic sequences with their partner's more drug-resistant cousin, and becoming harder to treat.&lt;ref name='pmid 16052079'&gt;{{cite journal

==Motivation for serosorting==

===Lower rates of changing each other's serostatus===
Studies have shown that serosorting provides some limited decrease in risk of contracting [[HIV]] among [[Men who have sex with men]] (MSMs) who use it as an HIV risk reduction technique.&lt;ref name="Goldenstudy"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://journals.lww.com/aidsonline/Abstract/2005/04001/Sexual_harm_reduction_practices_of.2.aspx | title=Sexual harm reduction practices of HIV-seropositive gay and bisexual men: serosorting, strategic positioning, and withdrawal before ejaculation | publisher=[[AIDS (journal)|AIDS]] |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=S13–S25 | date=April 2005 | accessdate=2010-12-23 |author1=Parsons, Jeffrey T |author2=Schrimshaw, Eric W |author3=Wolitski, Richard J |author4=Halkitis, Perry N |author5=Purcell, David W |author6=Hoff, Colleen C |author7=Gómez, Cynthia A }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aidsmap.com/en/news/E198EB3E-2EE3-48D6-BAC2-0C5EF17CE24A.asp |title=Is serosorting working, or even possible? |author=Gus Cairns |date=22 August 2006 |accessdate=2008-06-02 |publisher=[[aidsmap]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been seen as controversial in being used to engage in [[Human sexual activity|sexual activities]] without regard to [[safer sex]] practices, as either participants were free of HIV or were already [[asymptomatic carrier|carrier]]s. Although the practice has occurred informally since the [[AIDS pandemic]] began,&lt;ref name="serosortingintro"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thebody.com/content/art40765.html | title=Serosorting | publisher=[[San Francisco AIDS Foundation]] | date=Winter 2007 | accessdate=2010-12-23 |author1=Siconolfi, Daniel E |author2=Moeller, Robert W }}&lt;/ref&gt; serosorting has become more prevalent with online [[social networking]] sites now facilitating interactions, and even some health professionals citing [[harm reduction]] concepts for [[gay]] men as a measure to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Race |first=Kane |year=2010 |title=Click Here for HIV Status: Shifting Templates of Sexual Negotiation |journal=Emotion Space &amp; Society |pages=7–14 |volume=3 |issue=1 |doi=10.1016/j.emospa.2010.01.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New developments===
There has been further evolution on the idea of serosorting since the introduction of home-based rapid result tests. Prior to engaging in unprotected sex the two partners get tested together. If the immediate results are concordant they choose to have unprotected sex; while if the result is discordant condoms are used.

===The appeal of bareback sex===
'''[[Bareback (sex)|Barebacking]]''', or having male-to-male anal sex without using a [[condom]], first became articulated in magazines such as [[POZ (magazine)|POZ]] in 1995–96 as a practice taking place among HIV-positive men, and may be seen as an early articulation of serosorting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Race |first=Kane |year=2010 |title=Engaging in a Culture of Barebacking: Gay Men and the Risk of HIV Prevention |journal=HIV Treatment and Prevention Technologies in International Perspective |isbn=978-0-230-23819-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tippelzone amsterdam.jpg|thumb|300px|View of sex drive-in facility in Amsterdam (where panels do not reach to the ground), which is now closed]]

A '''sex drive-in''' or '''sex box''' is a car garage (or similarly shielded location) that is designed to allow [[prostitution]] to take place using cars, and can be found in a few countries in Europe. Generally the facilities are created by local authorities to put some control on where prostitution occurs and to provide increased safety.

==Background==

The concept started in the Netherlands where such facilities are called ''afwerkplek'' (literally meaning "a place to finish the work"; more to the point, "a sheltered area, provided by the authorities, where prostitutes provide their services"&lt;ref name="Ammon2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Swaan|first=Abram de|editor=Ulrich Ammon|title=The Dominance of English As a Language of Science: Effects on Other Languages and Language Communities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NEulLJm9dqQC&amp;pg=PA76|date=2001|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=9783110166477|page=76|chapter=English in the Social Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and was first used in [[Utrecht]] starting in 1986.&lt;ref name="first"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ARBTTMC4cF8C&amp;pg=PA225&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false AIDS: Prevention Through Education : a World View], p. 225 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1986-one"&gt;(18 August 2008). [http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/1039/Utrecht/article/detail/2180195/2008/11/18/Onderzoek-naar-ruimere-afwerkplek.dhtml Onderzoek naar ruimere afwerkplek], ''[[Algemeen Dagblad]]'' (in Dutch) (article states prostitutes are reporting that the stalls in the Utrecht facility are too small for some luxury cars and SUVs, as the facility has remained mostly unchanged since its construction in 1986)&lt;/ref&gt; It was later adopted in Germany (''verrichtungsbox'' in German, which translates as "performance box"), where the Utrecht model was first used in [[Cologne]] in 2001. There, a football field-sized, fenced-in space of a former industrial area (typically the kind of area where there are no residents to complain about the location), with a gated entry, security cameras, and alarm buttons in each stall.&lt;ref name="ref3"&gt;(7 July 2005). [http://www.dw.de/cologne-leads-the-way-in-safe-prostitution/a-1641575-1 Cologne Leads the Way in Safe Prostitution], ''dw-world.de''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="koln10"&gt;(16 Sep 2010). [http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/zuerich/stadt/In-Koeln-bewaehren-sich-die-Sexboxen/story/11982755 In Köln bewähren sich die Sexboxen], ''[[Tages-Anzeiger]]'' (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally facilities are designed so that the driver cannot exit the vehicle after pulling into the structure, but the prostitute can.&lt;ref name="nzz1"&gt;(20 September 2010). [http://www.nzz.ch/aktuell/startseite/der-strassenstrich-auf-der-gruenen-wiese-1.7614942 Der Strassenstrich auf der grünen Wiese], ''[[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]]'' (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, this design width was reported to be a problem in the Utrecht sex drive-in because the growing sizes of [[sports utility vehicle|SUV]] and [[luxury car]]s meant they were having difficulties fitting into the slots.&lt;ref name="1986-one"/&gt;

==Expansion to Switzerland==

In 2013, the first facility in [[Switzerland]] opened in [[Zurich]]. In addition to security, the stalls are equipped with alarm buttons.&lt;ref name="art1"&gt;(26 August 2013). [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-23839358 Zurich introduces 'drive-in' sex], ''BBC''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="German1"&gt;(25 February 2005).

[[File:Microphone and cover.JPG|thumb|Microphone covers are occasionally used to improve sound quality by reducing noise from wind.]]
'''Sound quality''' is typically an assessment of the accuracy, enjoyability, or intelligibility of [[sound|audio]] output from an electronic device. Quality can be measured objectively, such as when tools are used to gauge the accuracy with which the device reproduces an original sound;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.teamaudionutz.com/tutorial/27/What_is_Sound_Quality_and_How_is_it_Judged|title=What is Sound Quality and How is it Judged {{!}} Tutorials {{!}} Team Audionutz|website=www.teamaudionutz.com|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; or it can be measured subjectively, such as when human listeners respond to the sound or gauge its ''perceived'' similarity to another sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Sound/timbre.html|title=Sound Quality or Timbre|website=hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sound quality of a reproduction or recording depends on a number of factors, including the equipment used to make it,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/131462-quality-of-sound-and-the-tech-behind-it-what-to-look-for-when-choosing-a-speaker|title=Quality of sound and the tech behind it: What to look for when choosing a speaker - Pocket-lint|website=www.pocket-lint.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; processing and mastering done to the recording, the equipment used to reproduce it, as well as the listening environment used to reproduce it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.passmyexams.co.uk/GCSE/physics/pitch-loudness-quality-of-musical-notes.html|title=Pitch, Loudness and Quality of Musical Notes - Pass My Exams: Easy exam revision notes for GSCE Physics|website=www.passmyexams.co.uk|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some cases, processing such as [[Equalization (audio)|equalization]], [[dynamic range compression]] or [[3D audio effect|stereo processing]] may be applied to a recording to create audio that is significantly different from the original but may be perceived as more agreeable to a listener.  In other cases, the goal may be to reproduce audio as closely as possible to the original.

When applied to specific electronic devices, such as [[loudspeakers]], [[microphones]], [[amplifiers]] or [[headphones]] sound quality usually refers to accuracy, with higher quality devices providing higher accuracy reproduction.  When applied to processing steps such as [[Audio mastering|mastering]] recordings, absolute accuracy may be secondary to artistic or aesthetic concerns.  In still other situations, such as recording a live musical performance, audio quality may refer to proper placement of microphones around a room to optimally use [[room acoustics]].

==Digital Audio==
{{see also|Digital audio|Audio codec}}

Digital audio is stored in many formats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nch.com.au/acm/formats.html|title=File Formats|website=www.nch.com.au|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The simplest form is [[Pulse-code modulation|uncompressed PCM]], where audio is stored as a series of [[Quantization (signal processing)|quantized]] audio samples spaced at regular intervals in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/pulse-code-modulation-PCM|title=What is pulse code modulation (PCM)? - Definition from WhatIs.com|work=SearchNetworking|access-date=2017-04-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As samples are placed closer together in time, higher frequencies can be reproduced.  According to the [[Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem|sampling theorem]], any bandwidth-limited signal (that does not contain a  pure sinusoidal component), [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] B, can be perfectly described by more than 2B samples per second, allowing [http://www.xiph.org/video/vid2.shtml perfect reconstruction] of the bandwidth-limited analog signal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dspguide.com/ch3/2.htm|title=The Sampling Theorem|website=www.dspguide.com|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, for human hearing bandwidth between 0 and 20&amp;nbsp;kHz, audio must be sampled at above 40&amp;nbsp;kHz. Due to the need for filtering out ultrasonic frequencies resulting from the conversion to an analog signal, in practice slightly higher sample rates are used: 44.1&amp;nbsp;kHz ([[Compact Disc|CD audio]]) or 48&amp;nbsp;kHz ([[DVD-Video|DVD]]).

In PCM, each audio sample describes the sound pressure at an instant in time with a limited precision.  The limited accuracy results in [[quantization error]], a form of noise that is added to the recording.  To reduce quantization error, more precision can be used in each measurement at the expense of larger samples (see [[audio bit depth]]).  With each additional [[bit]] added to a sample, quantization error is reduced by approximately 6 [[Decibels|dB]].  For example, CD audio uses 16 bits per sample, and therefore will have quantization noise approximately 96 dB below the maximum possible sound pressure level (when summed over the full bandwidth)

The amount of space required to store PCM depends on the number of bits per sample, the number of samples per second, and the number of channels.  For CD audio, this is 44,100 samples per second, 16 bits per sample, and 2 channels for stereo audio leading to 1,411,200 bits per second.  However, this space can be greatly reduced using [[Audio compression (data)#Audio|audio compression]].  In audio compression, audio samples are processed using an [[audio codec]].  In a [[lossless codec]] audio samples are processed without discarding information by packing repetitive or redundant samples into a more efficiently stored form.  A lossless decoder then reproduces the original PCM with no change in quality.  Lossless audio compression typically achieves a 30-50% reduction in file size.  Common lossless audio codecs include [[FLAC]], [[Apple Lossless|ALAC]], [[Monkey's Audio]] and others.

If additional compression is required, [[Lossy audio compression#Lossy audio compression|lossy audio compression]] such as [[MP3]], [[Ogg Vorbis]] or [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] can be used.  In these techniques, lossless compression techniques are enhanced by processing audio to reduce the precision of details that are unlikely or impossible for human hearing to perceive using principles from [[Psychoacoustics]].  After the removal of these details, [[lossy compression]] can be applied to the remainder to greatly reduce the file size.  Lossy audio compression therefore allows a 75-95% reduction in file size, but runs the risk of potentially reducing audio quality if important information is mistakenly discarded

[[File:Swivel (2).JPG|thumb|A swivel in a link]]

A '''swivel''' is a connection that allows the connected object, such as a [[swivel gun|gun]] or [[swivel chair|chair]], to [[rotate]] horizontally or vertically. A common design for a swivel is a [[cylindrical]] [[Rod (geometry)|rod]] that can turn freely within a support structure. The rod is usually prevented from slipping out by a [[nut (hardware)|nut]], [[washer (mechanical)|washer]] or thickening of the rod. The device can be attached to the ends of the rod or the center. Another common design is a [[sphere]] that is able to rotate within a support structure. The device is attached to the sphere. A third design is a hollow cylindrical rod that has a rod that is slightly smaller than its inside diameter inside of it. They are prevented from coming apart by [[flange]]s. The device may be attached to either end.

A swivel joint for a [[pipe (material)|pipe]] is often a [[screw thread|threaded]] connection in between which at least one of the pipes is curved, often at an angle of 45 or 90 degrees. The connection is tightened enough to be water- or air-tight and then tightened further so that it is in the correct position.

[[File:Stylised atom with three Bohr model orbits and stylised nucleus.png|thumb|200px|&lt;center&gt;Stylised atom as an emblem of [[science]].&lt;/center&gt;]]
[[File:Emb logo.png|thumb|250px|&lt;center&gt;An emblem of the [[Theosophical Society]].&lt;/center&gt;]]
Immediately after formation the [[Theosophical Society]] in 1875, the founders of modern '''[[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]]''' were aimed to show that their ideas can be confirmed by '''[[science]]'''. According to professor [[Olav Hammer]], at the end of the 19th century the Theosophical doctrine has acquired in Europe and America wide popularity, thanking to numerous publications, which contained its simplified exposition and, in particular, asserted that Theosophy "includes" both science and religion, thus, positioning itself as "a scientific religion," or "a religious science."{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=222}}{{refn|group=note|[[Helena Blavatsky]] argued that ancient civilizations owned wisdom based on "unity of science and religion."{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=10}}}} Professor [[Joscelyn Godwin]] wrote that the Theosophical Society was formed at the "crucial historical moment when it seemed possible to unite science and [[occultism]], West and East" in modern Theosophy, adding into western civilization the [[esoteric]] eastern wisdom.{{sfn|Godwin|1994|p=xv}}

== Scientism of Theosophy ==
For the modern Theosophy, which Hammer considered as a standard of the esoteric tradition, conventional science is called upon to play "two diametrically opposite roles." On the one hand, Theosophy has always expressed its clearly negative attitude towards it. On the other hand, in the process of building the occult doctrine, it gave to certain fragments of scientific discourse the status of valued elements. In this case, science was not used as an object of criticism, but as "a basis of legitimacy and source of doctrinal elements." Thus, in Hammer's opinion, the main goal was achieved: the doctrine acquired a "scientistic" appearance.{{sfnm|Hammer|2003|1pp=203, 204|Asprem|2013|2p=408}}{{refn|group=note|Lydia Fesenkova wrote: "Modern esotericism show itself usually in a scientistic wear... It appeals to science, proclaiming the principle of the unity of science, religion, and philosophy."{{sfn|Фесенкова|2003|pp=84–85}} However, in opinion of professor [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]], the "scientistic aspect of modem esotericism is much more than mere terminology; it reflects an ongoing effort to bridge the worlds of [[spirit]] and physical matter."{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=235}}}}

The Theosophical Society proclaimed its third main task, "To investigate the unexplained laws of nature and the powers latent in man."{{sfnm|Kuhn|1992|1p=113|Hammer|2003|2p=218}} Thus, it set itself one of its goals to investigate phenomena whose existence itself is highly controversial, that is, the very premises of Theosophy have become "fertile ground" for the search for "scientistic formulations." Scientism and the ambivalence relation to science were already evident in the first Theosophical publications. It can be seen in both [[Helena Blavatsky|Blavatsky's]] early articles, and in ''[[Isis Unveiled]],'' the book that became the "first full-scale attempt" to create the Theosophical doctrine, where she stated that Theosophy does not contradict science, but is, in fact, a "higher form of science", in comparison with what is usually understood by this term.{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=219}} This statement by Blavatsky is quoted in Hammer's thesis:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The exercise of ''[[Magic (paranormal)|magical]]'' power is the exercise of ''natural'' powers, but superior to the ordinary functions of Nature. A miracle is not a violation of the laws of Nature, except for ignorant people. Magic is but a ''science,'' a profound knowledge of the Occult forces in Nature, and of the laws governing the visible or the invisible world... A powerful [[mesmerism|mesmerizer]], profoundly learned in his science, such as [[Baron du Potet]], Regazzoni, Pietro d'Amicis of Bologna, are ''magicians,'' for they have become the [[adept]]s, the [[Initiation (Theosophy)|initiated]] ones, into the great mystery of our Mother Nature."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1966|1p=137|Hammer|2003|2p=220}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A dual relation of Blavatsky to science remained unchanged, in Hammer's opinion, throughout her theosophical career. It was manifested also in the [[The Mahatma Letters to A.P. Sinnett|mahatma letters]] and later continued in ''[[The Secret Doctrine]].''{{refn|group=note|Hammer, apparently, considered Blavatsky the author, including the letters of the mahatmas. However, according to [[Charles Leadbeater|Leadbeater]], the letters were not written or dictated directly by the mahatmas, as the Theosophists supposed, "but were the work of pupils carrying out general directions given to them by the Masters."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=807}}}} In one of the letters, terms and theories of the conventional science are characterized with words such as "misleading", "vacillating", "uncertain" and "incomplete".{{sfnm|Barker|1924|1p=62|Hammer|2003|2p=220}} It is this last word that is most important, that is, "science is a half-truth." The Theosophical doctrine "not so much" denies the truth of science, how much condemns its inability to explain an essence of the [[spirit]]ual processes that "are supposedly the real causes" of the physical and chemical phenomena.{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=221}} According to Hammer, "The Secret Doctrine" is completely "imbued with the rhetoric of scientism". Although the "basic cosmological" concept in this work ultimately derives "from ancient wisdom" that was received by Blavatsky, as she claimed, from her "Masters," many of the details of this declassified cosmology are accompanied by references to archaeological discoveries, modern biological theories such as evolutionary theory of [[Ernst Haeckel|Haeckel]], etc. She believed that the positioning of Theosophy in relation to science is of great importance, and the third parts of both the 1st and 2nd volumes of her book have the common heading ''Science and the Secret Doctrine Contrasted.'' These sections are devoted both to the refutation of the conventional science, and to the search in it the support of occult teachings.{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=221}} Blavatsky repeatedly returned to the assertion that modern physical sciences point to the same reality as the esoteric doctrines:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"If there is anything on earth like progress, Science will some day have to give up, ''nolens volens,'' such monstrous ideas as her physical, self-guiding ''laws''—void of soul and [[Spirit]],—and then turn to the occult teachings. It has done so already, however altered are the title-page and revised editions of the Scientific Catechism."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1888a|1pp=506–507|Hammer|2003|2p=262}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Blavatsky generally did not reject science, suggesting the possibility of "reconciliation" of science and Theosophy.{{refn|group=note|[[Nikolai Berdyaev]] wrote, "Contemporary popular theosophy is very deferential towards science... From the natural sciences it borrows a naive realism."{{sfn|Berdyaev}}}} She believed that they have "important common grounds", and that the "weaknesses" of the traditional science are only its "temporary shortcomings." The main point of contact, which unites science and "occultism" against the common enemy, a dogmatic religion, was the refusal to recognize "unknowable, absolutely transcendent causes." Theosophical cosmos appears and disappears in an infinite sequence of "cycles of evolution and involution." This is [[pantheism| pantheistic]] position, because the beginning of this process does not require "transcendent God."{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=265}} Hammer has cited:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Well may a man of science ask himself, 'What power is it that directs each atom?' &lt;...&gt; [[Theism|Theists]] would solve the question by answering 'God'; and would solve nothing philosophically. Occultism answers on its own pantheistic grounds."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1888a|1p=549|Hammer|2003|2p=265}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Theosophical criticism ==
In his thesis Arnold Kalnitsky wrote that, criticizing science of the 19th century, the Theosophists claimed on the "futility" its attempts to adequately explain "the greatest enigmas" of Universe. They evaluated the "occult based" hypotheses as more accurate than those presented by science.{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|p=312}}

Hammer wrote Blavatsky defined her position regarding science "from the beginning of her theosophical career." Thus, the ''Mahatma Letters'' contain, in his opinion, the "rather unsystematic" accusations the modern science and the fragments of the occult doctrine, supposedly "far superior" the scientific ideas of the day. The essence of Blavatsky's "later argument" is anticipated in the next passage from letter No. 11: "Modern science is our best ally. Yet it is generally that same science which is made the enemy to break our heads with."{{sfnm|Barker|1924|1p=63|Hammer|2003|2p=261|Asprem|2013|3p=405}} She constantly condemned the traditional science as "limited, [[materialism|materialistic]] and prejudiced" and blamed in this the famous thinkers and scholars.{{refn|group=note|A Russian Indologist [[Alexander Senkevich]] wrote that in the 19th century, an idea of the omnipotence of science became the main one, and "men believed in steam's force more than in virtue of preaching."{{sfn|Сенкевич|2012|p=157}}}} [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]] was the first among the culprits "due to the materialism of his method, 'the general tenor' of his writing and, more specifically, his misunderstanding of spiritual evolution." [[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] materialist error allegedly consisted in the fact that in his [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|law of gravitation]] the primary was the power, not the influence of the "spiritual causes." In addition, she repeated the baseless, according to Hammer, assertion that Newton came to his ideas after reading [[Jakob Böhme|Böhme]].{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1888a|1pp=481, 490|Hammer|2003|2p=267}}{{refn|group=note|In the third chapter of ''Isis'' (Vol. 1) named by its author ''The blind leaders of the blind'' she particularly sharply criticized the two "high priests" of the scientific materialism [[John Tyndall|Tyndall]] and [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Huxley]].{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1877|1pp=73–98|Lachman|2012|2p=174|Asprem|2013|3p=409}}}}

An American author Joseph Tyson wrote that, according to Blavatsky, the mechanistic science's adepts of her time were the "animate corpses." She wrote that "they have no spiritual sight because their spirits have left them." She called their hypotheses "the [[sophism]]s suggested by cold reason," which future generations would banish to the "limbo of exploded myths."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1877|1pp=306, 318, 621|Tyson|2006|2p=388}} Also [[Henry Olcott]] proclaimed that the Theosophists must break "the walls of incredulous and despotic Western science."{{sfnm|Olcott|2011|1p=100|Tyson|2006|2p=387}}{{refn|group=note|[[Vladimir Trefilov]] wrote, "The main difference between the Theosophical science and the usual modern science is seen in the fact that the latter has to do only with scraps of a whole—with the physical phenomena of this and other worlds, with that that can be performed through the physical brain of man and his feeling."{{sfn|Трефилов|1994|p=234}}}}{{refn|group=note|Adhering to a line of the initial theosophical criticism, [[#Theosophists-scientists|Edi Bilimoria]]{{sfn|Theowiki}} suggested to those modern scientists who claim that they investigate and unravel "the 'mind of God' would do better to probe into their own minds to discover the arrogance and philosophic naivete of such 'investigations'."{{sfn|Bilimoria|1997|p=159}}}}

Some scientists, according to Blavatsky, were more prone to spiritual, and she "selectively approved" them. "The positive side of [[René Descartes|Descartes']] work" was supposedly his faith in the "magnetic doctrine" and [[alchemy]], although he was a "worshipper of matter." She was admired by [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler's]] method, "combining scientific and esoteric thought."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1877|1pp=206, 207|Hammer|2003|2p=267}} She gave also some excerpts from Newton's most "speculative" works, where he supports a "spiritualized" approach to gravity. Thus, according to her words, these "greatest scientists" rediscovered the esoteric knowledge already available to "Western occultists including [[Paracelsus]]... [[Kabbalah|kabbalists]] and alchemists."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1888a|1p=490|Hammer|2003|2p=267}}{{refn|group=note|Bilimoria classified Newton as a "greatest mystic and Occultist" of England.{{sfn|Bilimoria|1997|p=150}}}}

A religious studies scholar [[Alvin Boyd Kuhn|Alvin Kuhn]] wrote Blavatsky claimed in ''The Secret Doctrine'' that occultism does not combat with conventional science, when "the conclusions of the latter are grounded on a substratum of unassailable fact." But when its opponents try "to wrench the formation of [[Kosmos]]...  from Spirit, and attribute all to blind matter, that the Occultists claim the right to dispute and call in question their theories." She stated that "science is limited" to researching one aspect of human life that relates to the sphere of material nature. "There are other aspects" of this life—[[Metaphysics|metaphysical]], supersensory, for the knowledge of which science has no tools. Science devotes its strength to the study of vital forces, which are expressed in a phenomenal or sensual area. Consequently, it sees nothing but the residual effects of such forces. "These are but the shadow of reality," Blavatsky claimed. Thus, science deals "only with appearances" and hints of life, and that is all that it is capable of until the postulates of the occult are recognized. Science is tied to "the plane of effects", but occultism is take to "the plane of causes." Science "studies the expression of life", esotericism sees life itself. So that the scientist can learn "the elements of real causality", he will have to develop in himself such [[siddhi|abilities]] which today almost all Europeans and Americans absolutely lack. There is no other way to get enough facts to substantiate his conclusions.{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1888a|1pp=477–78|Kuhn|1992|2p=258}}

Tim Rudbøg wrote in his thesis: "A large part of Blavatsky's critique of modern science consisted in the critical view that many of these so-called new discoveries and theories were actually known to the ancients, but lost to the moderns due to their arrogance. In other words, any 'new' discovery was, to a large extent, simply 'old wine in new bottles'."{{sfn|Rudbøg|2012|p=276}}

== Theosophical evolutionism ==
Modern Theosophy, as professor [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]] stated, "adapting contemporary scientific ideas," raised the concept of "[[spiritual evolution]] through countless worlds and eras."{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=211}} According to professor [[Donald S. Lopez Jr.|Donald Lopez]], the occult "system of spiritual evolution" was more profound and advanced than that proposed by [[Charles Darwin]]. Theosophists accepted his theory but rejected the assertion that life originated from matter, and not from spirit.{{sfn|Lopez|2009|p=11}}{{refn|group=note|In 1963 a British chemist [[#Theosophists-scientists|Lester Smith]]{{sfn|Theosopedia}} said, "There is a tendency to believe that the whole secret of life is wrapped up in this [[genetic code]], so that  when it has been completely unravelled it will be possible to create life... We should proclaim firmly  that the biochemists are not studying Life itself, but its mechanisms, the almost unbelievably intricate and delicate tools it uses for its purposes."{{sfn|Smith|1963|p=18}} An [[:ru:Действительные члены РАН|academician]] [[Erik M. Galimov|Galimov]] stated that [[Darwinism]] proved unproductive "in reference to the problem of the origin of life."{{sfn|Галимов|2001|p=212}} Lydia Fesenkova noted that from the positions of the natural sciences, Darwinism now looks like a "hypothesis that greatly simplifies the real state of things," so his conclusions find "constantly-increasing objections."{{sfn|Фесенкова|2007|p=128}}}}

Kuhn wrote that, according to Blavatsky, between the spiritual evolution of man and his physical development "there is an abyss which will not be easily crossed by any man in the full possession of his intellectual faculties." [[Evolution|Physical development]], "as modern Science teaches it, is a subject for open controversy; spiritual and moral development on the same lines is the insane dream of a crass materialism."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1888b|1p=650|Kuhn|1992|2p=255}} Darwinian theory and the materialistic science suggest that the development of matter in an organic form leads to the emergence of the psyche and intelligence as the products of two elements: matter and energy. Occultism claims that such a process can lead to the creation of physical forms only. Instead of considering intellect and consciousness as properties of evolved organisms, Theosophy speaks of a "spiritual evolution" as a concomitant biological one and associated with it. "Evolution in its higher aspect" can't be explained if its factors are reduced to blind material forces arising under the impact of the "mechanical influences of environment."{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|pp=253, 254}}{{refn|group=note|According to Indian philosophy, there are "other worlds than that which our senses reveal to us, other senses than those which we share with the lower animals, other forces than those of material nature."{{sfn|Radhakrishnan|1948b|p=373}}}}

An American author [[Gary Lachman]] wrote that, according to Blavatsky, the "scientific" theory of evolution reflects only that part of it that takes place in our present physical world. [[Darwinism]] does not take into account what happens before and after. In her opinion, Darwin "begins his evolution of species at the lowest point and traces upward. His only mistake may be that he applies his system at the wrong end." After passing through the period of necessary separation, the spirit returns to itself enriched during its journey. Consequently, the biological evolution is not a "random" event that could "occur" due to some "rare" combination of chemical matters and then continued driven by the need for survival and suitable [[mutation]]s. Blavatsky claimed that, not spirit is in matter, but on the contrary, ''matter'' "clings temporarily to spirit."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1877|1pp=428, 429|Lachman|2012|2p=171}}{{refn|group=note|Senkevich wrote that, according to Darwin, the three main factors: [[Genetic variability|variability]], [[heredity]], and [[natural selection]] were responsible for evolution; thus, "the pragmatic West" with its mundane approach to life simply lacked "common sense, to gain faith in the evolution of [[soul]] or consciousness."{{sfn|Сенкевич|2012|p=435}}}} Thus, the spirit (or consciousness) is primary, and matter is a temporary means used in its "work." According to Theosophy, evolution is the basic phenomenon of the Universe that does not coincide with the materialistic vision, which, in Blavatsky's opinion, is "a hideous, ceaseless procession of sparks of cosmic matter created by ''no one''... floating onward from ''nowhence''... and it rushes ''nowhither''."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1877|1p=xviii|Lachman|2012|2p=171}} She proposed the kabalistic scheme of evolution: "A stone becomes a plant; a plant a beast; a beast a ''man''; a man a ''spirit''; and the spirit a god." In this scheme: "Each perfected species in the physical evolution only affords more scope to the directing intelligence to act within the improved nervous system."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1877|1pp=301, 425|Lachman|2012|2p=171}}

According to words of Dimitry Drujinin, Olcott claimed, "Theosophy shows the student that evolution is a fact, but that it has not been partial and incomplete as Darwin's theory makes it."{{sfnm|Olcott|1885|1p=250|Дружинин|2012|2p=79}} Professor [[I. K. Taimni|Iqbal Taimni]]{{sfn|Harris, Swarup}} wrote that, it is not known to science that the main goal "of the evolution of forms" is to obtain more effective means for the development of the mind and "unfolding consciousness." This barbarism is quite standard because the ordinary scientists decline to view everything that is "invisible" and can't be investigated "by purely physical means." Occultism allows one to obtain the "missing knowledge" and makes the concept of the evolution of forms not only more complete, but also explains the cause of the entire process, without which it seems completely meaningless.{{sfn|Taimni|1969|p=384}}

== Orientalists and Theosophists ==
In 1888, the president of the Theosophical Society Henry Olcott met in [[Oxford]] with [[Max Müller]], "the father of the '[[Science of religion]]'," as Lopez named his.{{sfn|Lopez|2009|pp=154, 158}} Olcott wrote later in his diary that professor Müller, in a conversation with him, highly appreciated the work of Theosophists in translating and re-publishing the sacred books of the East. "But as for our more cherished activities," Olcott wrote, "the discovery and spread of ancient views on the existence of [[Siddha]]s{{sfn|Eliade|1958|p=303}} and of the ''[[siddhi]]s'' in man,{{sfnm|Radhakrishnan|1948b|1pp=366–7|Трефилов|2005|2p=379}} he was utterly incredulous." In Müller's opinion, nor in the [[Vedas]], nor in the [[Upanishads]] there are any esoteric overtones announced by the Theosophists, and they only sacrifice their reputation, pandering "to the superstitious belief of the Hindus in such follies." In response to Olcott's attempt to argue his point of view by references to the [[Gupta-Vidya]]{{refn|group=note|"'''Gupta-vidya''' (Sanskrit) ''Gupta-vidyā'' [from ''gupta'' from the verbal root ''gup'' to conceal, preserve + ''vidyā'' knowledge, wisdom] Secret knowledge, secret wisdom; the source of all religions and philosophies known to the world: theosophy, the ancient wisdom-religion, the esoteric philosophy."{{sfn|Purucker|1999}}}} and [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|Patanjali]] the professor said, "We had better change the subject." The president has remembered well not only this conversation, but also "two marble statuettes of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] sitting in [[meditation]], placed to the right and left of the fireplace." He noted this fact, having written in his diary in brackets: "[[Buddhist]]s take notice."{{sfnm|Olcott|1910|1p=61|Lopez|2009|2p=157}}

Professor Lopez claimed that this was a significant meeting, because both, Buddhist Olcott, and the [[Buddhist studies]] scholar Müller, although both were directly related to Buddhism, nevertheless took different positions and lived in different worlds. The world of Olcott, an American emigre and convinced Theosophist "no formal training in the classical languages of Buddhism", but who was knowing well both the Buddhist world, and many reputable monks, collided with the world of Müller, a German emigre and outstanding [[sanskrit]]ologist, who was reading "Buddhist manuscripts in the original Sanskrit and [[Pali]]," and however failed to recognize theirs esoteric meaning and "never traveled beyond Europe." In Asia, Olcott faced with Buddhist superstition, which is why he argued with some of the leading monks of Sri Lanka. But he deeply revered the Buddhist mores. After his travels through the countries of Asia, he knew that for Buddhists it was absolutely unacceptable and offensive to place anything connected with [[dharma]] on the floor [or even on a chair]. Moreover, he knew that Buddhists "would never place a statue of the Buddha on the floor."{{sfn|Lopez|2009|p=158}}{{refn|group=note|"As a representation of an exalted being, the image of the Buddha must also be exalted."{{sfn|Lopez|2009|p=159}}}} {{See also|Buddhism and Theosophy#The Founders of the Theosophical Society}}

Olcott asked all the same of the origin of these statuettes and inquired about their placement. Müller answered that "the statues of the Buddha" standing on the floor near his fireplace were taken out of "the great temple of [[Rangoon]] (presumably the [[Shwedagon Pagoda|Shwedagon]])."{{refn|group=note|"It is unclear whether they were pillaged during the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]]", Lopez wrote, "when British troops captured and held the temple for two years, or during the [[Second Anglo-Burmese War|Second]], when British troops captured the temple in 1852; it then remained under the control of the military until 1929."{{sfn|Lopez|2009|p=159}}}} The professor was so imbued with the British imperialism, as Lopez noted, that he was not at all embarrassed to use the military trophies captured in the Buddhist temple. The "more interesting" was Müller's answer to the question why he put the Buddha statues on the floor: "Because with the Greeks the hearth was the most sacred spot." According to Lopez, the answer "sounds slightly disingenuous, but its implication is important." For Müller, the image of the Buddha, captured in Asia and taken to England, has ceased to be Asian, and therefore its owner was not obliged allegedly to follow the "Asian custom." For him, the Buddha became part "of European culture, like a Greek god," and therefore he should follow the customs of Western civilization.{{sfn|Lopez|2009|p=159}}

Five years after the meeting with Olcott, professor Müller published an article ''Esoteric Buddhism,'' in which he tried again, in a different form, to prove that there is no esotericism in Buddhism and never was. All his indignation the professor directed against Blavatsky, believing that the Buddhist esotericism is only her invention. "I love Buddha and admire Buddhist morality", Müller wrote, "that I cannot remain silent when I see his noble figure lowered to the level of religious charlatans, or his teaching misrepresented as esoteric twaddle."{{sfnm|Müller|1893|1p=784|Lopez|2009|2p=179}}{{refn|group=note|Also a prominent Buddhist studies scholar [[Thomas Rhys Davids|Rhys Davids]] believed that "the original Buddhism was the very contrary of esoteric."{{sfn|Davids|1896|p=210}}}} Theosophists often disagreed with the European [[Oriental studies|Orientalists]] and ridiculed their limitation. In 1882, in his letter to [[Alfred Percy Sinnett|Alfred Sinnett]] [[mahatma]] [[Kuthumi]] offered, "Since those gentlemen—the Orientalists—presume to give to the world their ''soi-disant'' translations and commentaries on our sacred books, let the theosophists show the great ignorance of those 'world' [[pandit|pundits]], by giving the public the right doctrines and explanations of what they would regard as an absurd, fancy theory."{{sfnm|Barker|1924|1p=185|Lopez|2009|2pp=184–185}}

== Occultists and sceptics ==
For Hindus, the [[Siddhi|supernatural powers]] of a [[yogi|person, who was specially trained]], aren't something special. Professor [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan|Radhakrishnan]] noted that in Indian psychology "the psychic experiences, such as [[telepathy]] and [[clairvoyance]], were considered to be neither abnormal nor miraculous."{{sfn|Radhakrishnan|1948a|p=28}}

Kuhn wrote that, in Blavatsky's opinion, to consider [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] as a deception is to offend humanity: "To believe that for so many thousands of years, one-half of mankind practiced deception and fraud on the other half, is equivalent to saying that the human race was composed only of knaves and incurable idiots."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1877|1p=18|Kuhn|1992|2p=132}} However, according to the Theosophical [[mahatma|Masters]], the "recent persecutions" for alleged [[witchcraft]], magic, [[mediumship]] convincingly show that the "only salvation" of the genuine occultists lies in the public skepticism, because the attribution to the "charlatans and the jugglers" securely protects them.{{sfn|Barker|1924|p=4}}

A member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] [[Eugene Alexandrov]] argued that the [[paranormal]] phenomena don't exist. He wrote, "There is no telepathy (a transmission and reading of thoughts), there is no clairvoyance, [[Levitation (paranormal)|levitation]] is impossible, there is no '[[dowsing]]', there is no phenomena of a '[[poltergeist]]', there is no [[psychokinesis]]."{{sfn|Александров|2015|p=21}}{{refn|group=note|See also arguments of [[Robert Todd Carroll|Robert Carroll]]:{{sfn|Carroll|2003}}}} As Edi Bilimoria{{sfn|Theowiki}} wrote, a typical western scientist don't distinguish (or can't distinguish) two things: a "map" (the scientific model of the world) and "territory" (Nature).{{sfn|Bilimoria|1997|p=71}}{{refn|group=note|Thus, if he didn't want to mark any "ravines" or "swamps" (the paranormal phenomena) on his "map," this don't mean that he will never "find himself" there. For participants in a hypothetical dialogue the [[Initiation (Theosophy)|initiated]] occultist and a typical scientist, Bilimoria chose the appropriate abbreviations: OWL (''Occultist,'' ''Wise,'' and ''Learned,'' or ''an owl'') and ASS (''Archetypal Sceptical Scientist,'' or ''an ass'').{{sfn|Bilimoria|1997|p=99}}}} {{See also|Map–territory relation}}

=== "Occult or Exact Science?" ===
{{Fringe section|date=September 2018}}
A religious studies scholar Arnold Kalnitsky wrote that in this work Blavatsky outlines her "typical" views about science.{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|p=155}}{{refn|group=note|This article was first published in 1886 in the Theosophical magazine ''[[The Theosophist]].'' Later it was included in the 7th volume of the ''Blavatsky Collected Writings.''{{sfn|Blavatsky|1956}}}}

;Statement on impotence of science
Kalnitsky wrote that at the beginning of her article, Blavatsky distinguishes "modern science" from "esoteric science", and argues that the methodology of the latter is preferable because it ultimately has a more practical, solid basis.{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|p=155}}{{refn|group=note|A religious studies scholar [[Vladimir Trefilov]] stated, "Without denying the positive role of science, the Theosophical theorists emphasize its limitations."{{sfn|Трефилов|1994|p=234}}}} He cited the passage from hers article:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Every new discovery made by modern science vindicates the truths of the archaic philosophy. The true [[occult]]ist is acquainted with no single problem that esoteric science is unable to solve, if approached in the right direction."{{Sfnm|Blavatsky|1956|1p=55|Kalnitsky|2003|2p=155}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
He concluded Blavatsky considers modern science to be a form of the "archaic philosophy", which, as a synthesized worldview, includes the "esoteric science." According to her, this is the position of the "true occultist," who can solve any problem by the proper use of esoteric methodology.{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|p=155}}{{refn|group=note|A religious studies scholar [[Alvin Boyd Kuhn|Alvin Kuhn]] stated, "Madame Blavatsky declared that occultism had no quarrel with so-called exact science where 'the conclusions of the latter are grounded on a substratum of unassailable fact'."{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|p=258}}}}

Blavatsky criticizes, Kalnitsky noted, the perspective of modern science, by disagreeing with the idea that the manipulation of matter presents a real scientific challenge. She asserts that replacing the word "[[matter]]" with the term "[[spirit]]" would result in a greater goal. She tries to show that knowledge of mere matter is not enough to provide the answers sought by science, because such knowledge does not adequately explain even the simplest phenomena of nature. Blavatsky notes that [[Spiritualism|spiritualistic phenomena]], with which she claims her audience would be well familiar, show the need for revising the prevailing scientific consensus. She argues that there is another form of "proof" of the existence of [[Extrasensory perception|extrasensory abilities]], citing the example of the use of narcotics, which allegedly had facilitated the demonstration of such abilities.{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|p=156}}{{refn|group=note|Radhakrishnan claimed that, according to Indian philosophy's teachings, "The perfections ([[siddhi]]s) are attained through birth, drugs (oadhi), spells ([[mantra]]s), austerity (tapas), or concentration ([[samadhi]])."{{sfn|Radhakrishnan|1948b|p=339}}}} Blavatsky's statement on "natural phenomena" is quoted in Kalnitsky thesis:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"No doubt the powers of human fancy are great; no doubt delusion and hallucination may be generated for a shorter or a longer period in the healthiest human brain either naturally or artificially. But natural phenomena that are not included in that 'abnormal' class do exist; and they have at last taken forcible possession even of scientific minds."{{Sfnm|Blavatsky|1956|1p=59|Kalnitsky|2003|2p=156}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Recognizing the potential errors inherent in relying upon imagination, and the unreliability of "delusion and hallucination," Blavatsky is still trying to gain the "stamp of legitimation" from reputable scientific judgement that could confirm that supersensory abilities "do exist." It was a constant aim of Theosophy, though implicit, and it was accompanied always by a distrust to the scientific approach. On the one hand, Blavatsky gives occasion for a reconciliation with the scientists, on the other—continues to denounce them.{{refn|group=note|Hammer claimed that Blavatsky often demonstrated how it is possible to combine the negative attitude to science with a positive.{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=221}}}} In Kalnitsky's opinion, she demonstrates a desire to show that the scientific evidence of the extrasensory perception is quite possible:{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|pp=156–7}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The phenomena of [[Hypnosis|hypnotism]], of [[telepathy|thought-transference]], of sense-provoking, merging as they do into one another and manifesting their occult existence in our phenomenal world, succeeded finally in arresting the attention of some eminent scientists."{{Sfnm|Blavatsky|1956|1p=59|Kalnitsky|2003|2p=157}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Kalnitsky stated Blavatsky shows a dualistic approach in her interpretation of these phenomena, distinguishing between "their occult existence" and their manifestation "in our phenomenal world." Apparently, this means that there is [[Noumenon|noumenal]] "sphere of reality," which is the basis of the phenomenal world. Furthermore, the assertion that "some eminent scientists" had shown interest in various forms of ESP, obviously, indicates that most scientists are not interested in it, and that widely recognizing of their paranormal nature did not happen. In particular, she criticizes the findings of the doctor [[Jean-Martin Charcot|Charcot]] and some other scientists in France, England, Russia, Germany and Italy, who "have been investigating, experimenting and theorising for over fifteen years."{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|p=157}} This is quoted in work by Kalnitsky:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The sole explanation given to the public, to those who thirst to become acquainted with the real, the intimate nature of the [[Paranormal|phenomena]], with their productive cause and genesis—is that the sensitives who manifest them are all '''hysterical!''' They are psychopates, and neurosists—we are told—no other cause underlying the endless variety of manifestations than that of a purely physiological character."{{Sfnm|Blavatsky|1956|1p=59|Kalnitsky|2003|2p=157}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

;Scientific method's limitation
Kalnitsky wrote that, in Blavatsky's opinion, the scientists, who are trying to explore the controversial [[Paranormal|paranormal phenomena]], find themselves in a situation of utter helplessness, but it is not their fault. They simply do not have an appropriate set of conceptual "tools" for the right approach to these phenomena. Without an elementary familiarization with occult principles and the adoption, at least as a working hypothesis, the notion of the [[Plane (esotericism)|subtle worlds]] of nature, the science is not able to reveal the true depth and scope of the universal laws that underlie all cosmic processes. The orthodox [[Materialism|scientists-materialists]] are constrained by the limitations of their sciences, and so they need a new orientation based on the attraction of occult knowledge. However, according to Blavatsky, even admitting the legitimacy of the occult hypothesis, they will not be able to bring their research to the end:{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|pp=158–9}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Therefore, having conducted their experiments to a certain boundary, they would desist and declare their task accomplished. Then the phenomena might be passed on to [[transcendental philosophy|transcendentalists]] and philosophers to speculate upon."{{Sfnm|Blavatsky|1956|1p=71|Kalnitsky|2003|2p=159}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Turning to the consideration of conflicting opinions about the paranormal experience, Blavatsky says that the scientific recognition of the hypothesis about the nature of the [[Parapsychology|psychic]] phenomena is not excluded, but it requires a discussion in relation to their underlying causes. She also claims that to defend the Theosophical position harder than spiritualistic, because the Theosophists categorically reject as a materialist theory so and a belief in spirits, presented in a traditional spiritualistic approach. Blavatsky classifies the spiritualists as the "idealists" and the scientists—as the "materialists," who both fully convinced that modern science can, respectively, or to confirm, or to deny the authenticity of the kingdom of the spirits. But those who believe in the ability of a science to accept the occult presentation will be disappointed, because its modern methodology simply does not allow it.{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|p=160}} Kalnitsky has quoted:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Science, unless remodelled entirely, can have no hand in occult teachings. Whenever investigated on the plan of the modern scientific methods, occult phenomena will prove ten times more difficult to explain than those of the spiritualists pure and simple."{{Sfnm|Blavatsky|1956|1p=77|Kalnitsky|2003|2p=160}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
He wrote that Blavatsky believes that modern scientific methods need to be rethought and remodeled to make it possible to study phenomena that can not be adequately explained from the materialistic standpoint. She expresses her disappointment with the existing state of affairs, doubting in achieving any progress. After ten years of a careful monitoring of the debate, she does not believe in the possibility of an objective and impartial investigation of the paranormal phenomena, not to mention the real revision of the well-established scientific views and the adoption of more adequate occult theory. The few scientists who could believe in the authenticity of such phenomena do not accept the hypothesis beyond the spiritualistic representations. Even in the midst of doubt of the truth of the materialist worldview, they are unable to move from spiritualism to the occult theory. In the study of [[Paranormal|unexplained]] side of the nature their respect for the traditional scientific orthodoxy always prevails over their personal views. Thus, according to Blavatsky, a necessary condition of objectivity is the impartiality and a change of the opinions.{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|pp=160–1}}

In Kalnitsky's opinion, considering the methodology of science, Blavatsky understood that the [[inductive reasoning]], based on data supplied by the physical senses, can not adequately provide a reliable way to study the abnormal phenomena.{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|p=162}} He has quoted:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Science—I mean Western Science—has to proceed on strictly defined lines. She glories in her powers of observation, induction, analysis and inference. Whenever a phenomenon of an abnormal nature comes before her for investigation, she has to sift it to its very bottom, or let it go. And this she has to do, and she cannot, as we have shown, proceed on any other than the inductive methods based entirely on the evidence of physical senses."{{Sfnm|Blavatsky|1956|1p=78|Kalnitsky|2003|2p=162}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

;Against ethical materialism
Kalnitsky wrote Blavatsky argues that the fruits of materialistic scientific worldview, reaching the sphere of practical interests of the people, shape their [[ethics]]. She sees a direct logical connection between a faith in the soulless mechanistic universe and by the fact that is for her as a purely egoistic attitude to life.{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|p=162}} He has quoted:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The theoretical materialistic science recognizes nought but [[Matter|'''substance''']]. Substance is its deity, its only God." We are told that practical materialism, on the other hand, concerns itself with nothing that does not lead directly or indirectly to personal benefit. "Gold is its idol," justly observes Professor [[Alexander Butlerov|Butleroff]] (a spiritualist, yet one who could never accept even the elementary truths of occultism, for he "cannot understand them"). – "A lump of matter," he adds, "the beloved substance of the theoretical materialists, is transformed into a lump of mud in the unclean hands of ethical materialism. And if the former gives but little importance to inner (psychic) states that are not perfectly demonstrated by their exterior states, the latter disregards entirely the inner states of life... The spiritual aspect of life has no meaning for practical materialism, everything being summed up for it in the external. The adoration of this external finds its principal and basic justification in the dogma of materialism, which has legalized it."{{Sfnm|Blavatsky|1956|1pp=79–80|Kalnitsky|2003|2pp=162–3}}{{refn|group=note|In 1871, Butlerov organized, "to the consternation of many of his fellow scientists," the first scientific commission for the investigation of the [[Mediumship|mediumistic]] phenomena.{{sfn|Сенкевич|2012|p=171}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Kalnitsky wrote Blavatsky clearly expresses her utter contempt for the values of "practical materialists." She accuses the ideological foundations of theoretical materialism for its an ignoring of the spiritual dimension of reality. This aversion to the complete unspirituality of the materialism reflects her "implicit [[Gnosticism|gnostic]] ethical stance." A materialistic-physical and selfish interests are not compatible with the idealised world of the spirit and the transcendental purpose of [[Mysticism|mystical]] enlightenment. The practical materialists, even professing adherence to a moral code, do not cease to be by ethical materialists. According to Kalnitsky, "Blavatsky's radical gnostic dualism is allowing no room for compromise or alternative options." Thus, she considers the esoteric vision of reality the only viable alternative.{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|pp=163–4}}

Kalnitsky wrote that science was seen in the West as the dominant category of knowledge and for the Theosophists it was not so an enemy, as a potential ally. However, the stereotypes of the materialistic thinking were one of the main obstacles to the esoteric representation of reality. Thus, at every opportunity Blavatsky tries to dispel what was for Theosophy, as she considered, alien and wrong. It is meant to challenge to many of the basic principles that supported the materialistic basis of science. However, a neutral and objective approach of the science to the analysis of the facts seemed, for the Theosophists, trustworthy. Blavatsky's striving to apply this approach to the consideration of the paranormal and mystical phenomena pursued a goal: to achieve the legitimacy and public acceptance of Theosophy. A skeptical position, which was taken by Blavatsky in respect of the materialistic science, was motivated by her outrage over the ignore by the scientists the spiritual dimension of reality. On the other hand, the assertion that spiritual truths can be proven from a scientific point of view, was a constant theme of Blavatsky's claims. The efforts of the Theosophists were focused on the legitimation of all forms of extrasensory and mystical experience.{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|p=165}}

== Theosophical psychophysiology ==
{{Main article|Thought-Forms (book)}}
A few years after Blavatsky's death, the "second generation" of the Theosophists came to the leadership of the [[Theosophical Society Adyar|Theosophical Society]].{{sfn|Wessinger|2013}} As Hammer wrote, during this period, the "foci" of the Theosophical scientism shifted from the theory of evolution to other areas of science.{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=222}} [[Charles Leadbeater]], who became "the chief ideologist" of the Society, had involved with [[Annie Besant]] in the study of a functioning of the human mind. A religious studies scholar Gregory Tillett wrote that, according their claim, the functioning of mind "extrudes into the external world" the thought-forms which can be observed using clairvoyance methods.{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=224}} In 1901 Besant and Leadbeater published a book named ''[[Thought-Forms (book)|Thought-Forms: A Record of Clairvoyant Investigation]]'' contained a lot of color illustrations of forms, "created," according to its authors, by thoughts, emotions, and senses of men, as well by music. They argued that main source of the forms is the [[Aura (paranormal)|aura of man]], the outer part of the cloud-like substance of his "[[Subtle body|subtle bodies]]," interpenetrating each other, and extending beyond the confines of his physical body.{{sfnm|Hammer|2003|1p=55|Wessinger|2013|2p=36}}{{refn|group=note|In Hammer's opinion, "Leadbeater proposed a theory of the human aura" based on some Blavatsky's ideas.{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=223}} Truly, according to Blavatsky, "Every person emits a magnetic exhalation or aura."{{sfn|Blavatsky|1877a}} Goodrick-Clarke noted that a Japanese scientist [[Hiroshi Motoyama]] has expanded Leadbeater's concepts "through [[Electrophysiology|electrophysiological]] experimental work concerning the subtle network of [[chakra]]s and [[Nadi (yoga)|nadis]] as conductors of [[prana|energy]] in the [[Subtle body|subtle bodies]]."{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=235}}}}

== Theosophical chemistry ==
{{Main article|Occult Chemistry}}
According to Hammer and other scholars, in parallel with the "[[psychophysiology|psychophysiological]]" researches, the Theosophists were busy an occult chemistry based on a "greatly modified" atomic theory. Leadbeater began "the occult investigation" of chemical elements as early as 1895, and Besant soon joined him. They argued that, using clairvoyance, can describe the intra-atomic structure of any element. In their words, each element composed of atoms containing a certain number of "smaller particles." They published "these and other results" in 1908 in a book ''[[Occult Chemistry|Occult Chemistry: Clairvoyant Observations on the Chemical Elements]].'' Hammer wrote, "Although Leadbeater was the principal clairvoyant, the enduring interest in... chemistry is probably due to Annie Besant's fascination with science, especially chemistry."{{sfnm|Hammer|2003|1pp=222–23|Wessinger|2013|2p=36|DeGracia|2006|3pp=131–148}}{{refn|group=note|[[René Guénon]] wrote that the "detailed description of different kinds of atoms" by Besant and Leadbeater can be termed as "pseudo-scientific fantasies."{{sfn|Guénon|2004|p=101}}}}

== Theosophy and physics ==
A historian of religion Egil Asprem informed that in 1923, an astronomer and Theosophist G. E. Sutcliffe published a book ''Studies in Occult Chemistry and Physics'' which was a "critical analysis" of the [[theory of relativity]]. The author has pursued the goal: to equalize the meaning of "Eastern" and "Western science," describing their "as two complementary 'schools'." In this book, the theory of relativity is regarded as the highest achievement of "Western science," whereas the results of the Theosophical study "of atoms and etheric structures" known as "occult chemistry" are presented as the achievement of "the 'Eastern' school".{{sfnm|Sutcliffe|1923|1pp=v–vi|Asprem|2013|2p=415}} In an effort to show that the results of occult research can be compared with the theory of relativity, Sutcliffe "proposes a wholly new theory of gravity," based on physics of [[Luminiferous aether|ether]]. From his reasoning it can be seen that he is thoroughly erudite in the Theosophical literature, while also having a background in "conventional physics from Britain" in the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century. Sutcliffe tries to reinterpret the theory of [[Albert Einstein]] in "a tradition of British anti-relativism",  operating with the liberal "concept of ether."{{refn|group=note|"Ether physics was a crucial component of physics in Britain, and was part of the curriculum at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], as late as
1910."{{sfn|Asprem|2013|p=416}}}} The concept of Sutcliffe is based on "contraction and expansion of the accompanying ether of bodies," so, according to him, gravitation "is one of the effects of an expanding sphere of ether," and the electrical phenomena are a function of the "contracting sphere."{{sfnm|Sutcliffe|1923|1p=xv|Asprem|2013|2p=416}}

Professor Taimni wrote that the theory of relativity apparently gave "a new direction to our civilization" and created problems that "are a challenge" to our current worldview and ways of thinking. In the "scientific circles" it is considered that if mathematics is used to prove something, then the question "is finally settled", and it can't be discussed. However, most such conclusions are not always based on proven assumptions, and this makes possible a mistake in "the final conclusion." Often one does not take into account the fact that mathematical inference can then be correct if he accepts into account "all factors" concerning this issue, and if it is not, the conclusion may be incorrect "or only partially correct." This should be borne in mind when considering the nature of space and time, as well as the Einstein's method used to solve this problem. He based his theory "only on facts of the physical world" and if there are other, more [[Plane (esotericism)|subtle worlds]] "besides the physical",{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=936}}{{sfn|Трефилов|1994|p=237}} and they exist in accordance with the occult, then his theory has no authority "with respect to those worlds." Since his theory is based only on physical facts, it can be true, at best, "only for purely physical phenomena." It can't be assumed that it reveals the nature of space and time "in general", because it is presented "to the human mind" functioning within the boundaries of "the physical brain." "The very fact that the concept of the [[Spacetime|time-space continuum]]" given in his theory is too difficult for the human mind, indicates its limitations. In fact, its author simply tried to interpret "imperfectly the shadows of some realities cast on the screen in a shadow play of the mind."{{sfn|Taimni|1969|pp=226–227, 334}}

Taimni wrote that anyone who closely studied the nature of space and time could be convinced that the human mind is "also a very important factor in this problem", therefore, to understand the space and time, it is necessary to take into account this factor. And since the human mind is not only what is manifested through its physical brain, but has "many degrees of subtlety and modes of expression," the entire human nature is "really involved in the problem" of space and time. And therefore only the one who "dived" into his consciousness and has "unraveled" his deepest secrets, having reached the source from which space and time come,{{refn|group=note|According to the occult science, space and time are the result of the manifestation of their archetypal principles, called "Mahakasha" and "[[Mahakala]]" respectively.{{sfn|Bilimoria|1997|p=146}}}} is really capable of saying what the true nature "of these basic realities of the universe is." "Who is more competent to pronounce a correct opinion about the nature of an orange," Taimni is asking, "he who has merely scratched the rind or he who has peeled the orange and eaten it?"{{sfn|Taimni|1969|pp=334–335}}{{refn|group=note|In Taimni's opinion, Einstein's theory does not imply the existence "of super-physical worlds," ignores "the existence of mind and consciousness as principles independent of the physical world," suggests that there are "only three dimensions of space and one of time" and does not take into account "many other facts" of reality that are "part of the Occult Doctrine" and were repeatedly tested "by [[clairvoyance|seers]], occultists and [[mysticism|mystics]] of all ages."{{sfn|Taimni|1974|pp=6–7}}}}{{refn|group=note|Lopez claimed, "To understand the nature of reality, one must achieve [[buddhahood]]."{{sfn|Lopez|2009|p=19}}}}

According to words of Kuhn, Blavatsky claimed, "It is on the doctrine of the illusive nature of matter, and the infinite divisibility of the atom, that the whole science of Occultism is built."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1888a|1p=520|Kuhn|1992|2p=261}} The researchers in esotericism Emily B. Sellon and Renée Weber have written: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Anticipating the conclusions of Einsteinian relativity and [[Field (physics)|field]] theory, as well as [[quantum mechanics]], Blavatsky proposed a universe in which billiard-ball atoms and push-pull forces were replaced by space, time, motion, and energy, yielding a picture of a dynamic universe far in advance of her time."{{sfn|Sellon, Weber|1992|p=326}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== New paradigm ==
According to a philosopher and religious studies scholar [[Vladimir Trefilov]], the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|modern Theosophists]] were among the first who attempted to create "a new paradigm of thinking through the synthesis of scientific and non-scientific knowledge."{{sfn|Трефилов|1994|p=234}} As professor of Buddhist studies and Buddhist [[Evgeny Torchinov]] said, "Discussion between physicists, philosophers, psychologists, and scholars of religious studies in order to find the solutions of a problem of the [[Paradigm shift|general scientific paradigm change]], the isomorphism of consciousness and physical world,{{refn|group=note|According to Indian occultists, the manifested Universe is the product of interaction of two primary Principles: "'''[[Shiva]]''', or '''Consciousness''' and '''[[Shakti]]''', or '''Power'''."{{sfnm|Woodroffe|1973|1p=23|Bilimoria|1997|2p=133}}}} and even the [[ontology]] of consciousness in general could well take place, if don't resort to sticking labels like 'mysticism'."{{sfn|Торчинов|2007|loc=Заключение}} Professor [[Stanislav Grof]], psychologist, wrote that Western science has raised matter to a status of the prime cause of Universe, reducing life, consciousness, and mind to the forms of its accidental products. Dominance in Western science a [[Mechanistic Materialism|paradigm of Newton-Descartes]] became one of the causes of the emergence and development of the "planetary crisis."{{sfn|Grof|1998|loc=Ch. 6}}

An Ukrainian philosopher [[#Theosophists-scientists|Julia Shabanova]] has believed that "the post-materialist scientific paradigm and the worldview idealism" should become a conceptual basis of the future civilization.{{sfn|Шабанова|2016|p=197}} The Russian cyberneticist [[Sergei P. Kurdyumov|Sergei Kurdyumov]] and [[Doktor nauk|philosopher]] Helena Knyazeva, in a book ''Laws of Evolution and Self-organization of Complex Systems,'' suggested that the "paradigm of self-organization and non-linearity" would become the basis of the new scientific paradigm, taking from the West "the positive aspects of the tradition of analysis", and from the East—ideas of the [[Holism|integrity]], cyclicity, and the one law for Universe and man.{{sfn|Князева, Курдюмов|1994|pp=73, 223}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Eastern ideas about the universal coherence, the unity of everything in the world, and the cyclic flowing into each other of Non-Being and [[Being]] (unmanifested and manifested) can resonate with the [[Synergetics (Haken)|synergetic]] models... We can assume that there is a kind of an origin environment, in which all other observable and studied environments have grown. Then all the environments, with which we are dealing in life and scientific experiment, appear as some fluctuations (disturbances), the visible to us manifestations (modifications) of this one substrate—the origin environment."{{sfn|Князева, Курдюмов|1994|p=57}}{{refn|group=note|[[Fritjof Capra]] wrote in 1982, "The parallels to [[Eastern mysticism]] are appearing not only in physics but also in biology, psychology and other sciences...

According to a historian of religion Egil Asprem, an Indian scientist and engineer Edi Bilimoria{{sfn|Theowiki}} was one of the most significant characters "in the Theosophical discourse on science of the last decade and a half." In his work ''Mirages in Western Science Resolved by Occult Science'' he confirms the division into "Western" and "occult" science which took place already at the time of the formation of the Theosophical Society, and also "conceptually" updates the discussion of "modern physics and cosmology." Playing back the well-known Theosophical "rhetoric," Bilimoria suggests to move forward to "a reconciliation and reuniting of the wise old parent, Occult Science, with its adolescent prodigal son, Western science."{{sfnm|Bilimoria|1997|1p=v|Asprem|2013|2p=424}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Occult science is not bent on toppling, but rather on uplifting Western science to an even nobler position, by using examples from Western science itself to show how it is rooted in the deeper substratum of Occult Science and Philosophy."{{sfnm|Bilimoria|1997|1p=196|Asprem|2013|2p=425}}{{refn|group=note|Speaking of the ancient occult science, mahatma Kuthumi wrote, "Our laws are as immutable as those of Nature, and they were known to man and eternity before this strutting game cock, modern science, was hatched."{{sfn|Barker|1924|p=144}} Thus, according to Bilimoria, the fact of the "expanding Universe was well known" to occultists else in antiquity, "only in greater" detail in comparison with the concept of the "modern cosmologists."{{sfn|Bilimoria|1997|p=142}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Criticism of Theosophy ==
{{See also|Theosophical mysticism#Criticism}}
A Russian philosopher [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]] wrote that modern Theosophy is a doctrine not only "anti-religious" and "antiphilosophic", but also "anti-scientific."{{sfn|Соловьёв|1911|p=397}} A religious philosopher [[Sergius Bulgakov]] stated that [Blavatskian] Theosophy, trying to replace religion with itself, turns into a "vulgar pseudoscientific mythology."{{sfn|Bulgakov|2012|p=37}} In [[Nikolai Berdyaev|Berdyaev's]] opinion, modern Theosophy does not represent a synthesis of religion, philosophy and science, as its adherents say, but there is a "mixture" of them, in which there is no real religion, no real philosophy, no real science.{{sfn|Berdyaev|1972|p=299}}

The ambiguous attitude of the Theosophists towards science was especially abruptly criticized by the servants of the Christian church.{{refn|group=note|See also: [[Christianity and Theosophy#Confrontations]].}} In 1912, John Driscoll, an author of ''[[The Catholic Encyclopedia]],'' has described [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy's]] attitude to science as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Modern theosophy claims to be a definite science. Its teachings are the product of thought, and its source is consciousness, not any Divine revelation. &lt;...&gt; Judging it as presented by its own exponents, it appears to be a strange mixture of mysticism, charlatanism, and thaumaturgic pretension combined with an eager effort to express its teaching in words which reflect the atmosphere of Christian ethics and modern scientific truths."{{sfn|Driscoll|1912|pp=627–8}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A Russian theologian, [[Andrey Kuraev]], accused the Theosophists of violation of the principles of scientific aethics, arguing they do not react to the opponents' objections, do not bring "a scientific arguments in support of their position", and also put themselves "beyond all criticism from side of science." In support of his words, Kurayev quoted Blavatsky's statement on the need to fight with "every modern scholar's" pretension to evaluate "of ancient Esotericism", when he is not "a Mystic" or "a Kabalist".{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1897|1p=13|Кураев|2000|2p=129}} In connection with the special attention of the Theosophists to the theory of evolution, a Russian Orthodox cleric and theologian Dimitry Drujinin wrote that "Theosophy began to parasitize on the central tendencies of thought and science of its time." And also: "The rough and cheeky Blavatsky's criticism of Darwinism turned into personal insults to scholars." According to Drujinin, "the statements of Theosophy are an absurd nonsense."{{sfn|Дружинин|2012|pp=79–81}} Lydia Fesenkova, an employee of the [[Institute of Philosophy, Russian Academy of Sciences|Institute of philosophy]], also severely criticized the occult statements of Blavatsky, which described anthropogenesis: "From the point of view of science, such beliefs are an explicit profanity and don't have the right to exist in the serious literature."{{sfn|Фесенкова|2004|p=93}}

An [[:ru:Действительные члены РАН|academician]] [[:ru:Вячеслав Стёпин|Viacheslav Stepin]] answering the question about [[pseudoscience]] said, "The dominant value of the scientific rationality begins to influence other spheres of culture—and religion, the myth are modernized often under this influence.

'''Thomas Stephens Konknni Kendr''' (TSKK) is a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] research-institute working on issues related to the [[Konkani language]], literature, culture and education. It is based in Alto [[Porvorim]], on the outskirts of the state capital of [[Goa]], India.

==Aim==

The TSKK says it "is devoted to the promotion of education and research in the Konknni language, literature and culture". It was registered under the Societies Registration Act in 1982 and first functioned from 1986 at the locality of [[Miramar, Panaji|Miramar]], before its current premises was built. It is located alongside the also Jesuit [[Xavier Centre of Historical Research]].

==Current status, and name==

TSKK is a Society registered under the Indian [[Societies Registration Act]] of  1860. From June 1999, it has been recognized by the [[Goa University]] as a  Konknni research institute.

This institution gets its name from the sixteenth-century English Jesuit priest, [[Thomas Stephens (missionary)|Thomas Stephens]] (1549–1619), a linguist and Marathi poet. Stephens came to Goa, then a Portuguese colony, on 24 October 1579. According to the institution, Stephens learned the Konknni and Marathi languages and wrote in them. He produced the first grammar to be produced in an Indian language, in Konknni  printed in 1622. Stephens died in Goa in 1619.

==Research bulletin==
[[File:India Goa TSKKBulletin.jpg|thumb|TSKK's Sod research bulletin]]

One of the activities of the TSKK is the publication of a research bulletin called ''Sod''. This journal is edited, produced and published as part of TSKK's "research efforts ... devoted to the promotion of education and research in (the) Konknni language, literature and culture". Its articles are a mix of Konknni written in Devanagari-script, [[Konkani in the Roman script|the Roman (Romi) script]], and occasionally in English too.

Issue No 10 April 2006 contains the following articles: 

* Konkani Myths: Pratap Naik SJ
* Social damage done by Goa's language controversy and (the) conspiracy behind it. Ramnath G Naik
* Roman script, the soul of Konknni. Nelson Lopes.
* Socio-economic growth of the Goan community through the Konkani language. Tomazinho Cardozo
* Roman script for Konkani, a must: now or never. Godfrey Gonsalves.
* Script controversy. Eduardo Faleiro.
* A response to "Konknni Myths". Alito Siqueira.
* Scripting controversy: debating the war of the Konknnis. Jason Keith Fernandes.
* An attempt to understand Konknni language assertion movement. Sammit Khandeparkar.
* Mother tongue blues. Madhavi Sardesai.
* Konkani versus scripts. Matthew Almeida, SJ
* The African, Portuguese, Kannada, Marathi, Malvani, Hindi and English influences on the hybridized Siddi-Konkani dialect. Geralda de Lima Angenot
* English medium primary education for better future. Cypriano Lopes.
* Response to "English medium primary education for better future" Joe F Vaz.

Generally ''Sod'' issues are priced at Rs 50 each (in Goa).

==Courses in Konkani, etc==

TSKK also offers courses in the [[Konknni]] language, and on project methodology for researchers, and study methodology for students. Currently (September 2006), the TSKK is working on language-teaching books for adults and children to learn Konkani (in the '''Romi''' or '''Roman''' script).

==Management and location==
[[File:India Goa TSKK PratapNaik.jpg|thumb|Pratap Naik, sj, director of TSKK]]
Earlier, this institute was headed by [[Fr Mathew Almeida, sj]] who has been succeeded by [[Fr Pratap Naik sj]].

Thomas Stephens Konknni Kendr is located at B.B.Borkar Road, Alto Porvorim, Goa (India) 403 521.

==Publications==

TSKK has come out with a number of publications in the [[Konknni]] language, or in languages like English introducing themes related to [[Konknni]], which is India's smallest language, spoken mainly along the west coast of this country.  

Some of its publication include a 1988 guide to writing [[Devanagari]] script [[Konknni]] (20 pp, then priced at Rs 3, now out of print), ''A Description of Konknni'' by [[Matthew Almeida, sj]] (1989), ''Teacher's and Parent's Manual'' (1996, pp 150)by Pratap Naik,S.J., ''TSKK Konknni Basic Course'' (Matthew Almeida, SJ, 1991), ''Tisvaddeacheo Igorzo'' ([[Moreno de Souza]], SJ, 1994, on the churches of the sub-district of [[Tiswadi]] in Goa), ''TSKK Romi Lipi'' (TSKK's orthography for Roman-script Konknni by Pratap Naik, SJ 2005 pp 52).

In addition it has also brought out five cassettes and CDs, of Konknni music containing devotional songs and nursery rhymes and children's songs.

==TSKK's plant collection==
[[File:India Goa TSKKgarden.jpg|thumb|TSKK's botanical garden]]

[[Jesuit]] priest [[Pratap Naik sj]], director of the TSKK currently, has been building a collection of over 328 trees and plants, all in the yard of a research institution studying the local [[Konknni]] language. Naik  argues that the culture of a place is reflected "not only" in its language, but also in its flora—apart from its fauna, architecture, food habits and dress.

He has been quoted saying that he wants to grow one of every fruit-bearing tree that grows in [[Goa]] which is rich in plant diversity. This richness is thanks in significant part to plant exchanges by the former rulers who centuries back controlled international seaways and had an empire straddling the continents.

Many months of hard work has seen Naik piece together a well-maintained and neatly labelled botanical garden. Visible are the local names in Konknni, the botanical names, their [[English language|English]] names. Elsewhere, he keeps a list of the original native countries of these [[Goa]]-adopted plants.

Among the collection are the '''ainno madd''' (the Fan Palm in [[English language|English]], or [[Livistona rotundifolia]] as it's known by its botanical name). It comes from tropical [[United States|America]].  There's the '''ambaddo''', dismissively perhaps called the [[Spondias|hog-plum]] that traces its origins to [[India]] itself. The '''ambor''' ([[mulberry]], or [[Morus alba]]) has [[China|Chinese]] origins. '''Kalljirem''' (black cumin, [[Nigella sativa]]) is again of [[India]]n origin. 

'''Kiraitem''' ([[canscora]] in English, or [[Canscora decussata]]) is from [[India]], but the '''zaifoll''' ([[nutmeg]], [[Mystica fragans]]) comes from the [[Moluccas]], the so-called [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]] of past centuries, in the [[Far East]]. '''Gozgo''' (the [[fever nut]] or [[Caesalpinia bonduc]]) is, again, of [[India]]n origin.

Naik says he has already found the names of 325 species from among the 329 he planted. "Some don't have names in Konknni (the local language)," he is quoted as saying, obviously because of their exotic origins.

'''Universidad San Francisco de Quito USFQ''' (informally '''Universidad San Francisco''', or simply '''USFQ''') is a [[liberal-arts]], [[non-profit]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}, [[private university]] located in [[Quito]], [[Ecuador]]. It was the first totally private self-financed university in Ecuador and the first liberal-arts institution in the [[Andes|Andean region]].&lt;ref name="sobrelausfq"&gt;Sobre la USFQ {{cite web |url=http://www.usfq.edu.ec/Paginas/SobreUSFQ.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501123205/http://www.usfq.edu.ec/Paginas/SobreUSFQ.aspx |archivedate=2012-05-01 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="qstopuniversities"&gt;Universidad San Francisco de Quito @QSTopUniversities {{cite web |url=http://www.topuniversities.com/institution/universidad-de-san-francisco-de-quito |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011160235/http://www.topuniversities.com/institution/universidad-de-san-francisco-de-quito |archivedate=2011-10-11 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Academically, USFQ ranks as one of the three-top universities (category A) in the ranking of Ecuadorian universities (being the only totally private university to qualify for the highest category), issued by the Ecuadorian Council of Evaluation and Accreditation of High Education ([[:es:Consejo Nacional de Evaluación y Acreditación de la Educación Superior del Ecuador|Consejo Nacional de Evaluación y Acreditación de la Educación Superior CONEA]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vistazo.com/webpages/pais/?id=7926 |title=Calificación de las universidades según el CONEA |publisher=Vistazo.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511085200/http://www.vistazo.com/webpages/pais/?id=7926 |archivedate=2012-05-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CONEA: sólo 11 Universidades tienen calificación "A" y 9 calificación "B" [http://www.eldiario.com.ec/noticias-manabi-ecuador/136020-conea-solo-11-universidades-tienen-calificacion-a-y-9-calificacion-b/]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, it was ranked first in Ecuador in relation to the number of [[peer-reviewed]] [[scientific publication]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Orbe, T. 2009. Ecuador produce pocas publicaciones científicas. Scidev.Net [http://www.scidev.net/es/news/ecuador-produce-pocas-publicaciones-cient-ficas.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

The university now enrolls 5,500 students, 4,500 of whom are undergraduates. The university each year has about 100 indigenous students and 1,000 international students participate in USFQ academic programs. USFQ has developed a scholarship program for indigenous students, offering full scholarships to the best students of public high schools throughout Ecuador.&lt;ref&gt;David E. Weaver. 2008. Transforming universities: The expediency of interculturality for indigenous superior education in Ecuador. MS Thesis, Tulane University. https://books.google.com.ec/books?id=e6dkwYIabIYC&lt;/ref&gt; Although USFQ receives no funding from the government of Ecuador, its faculty comprises one-half of all the people in that nation who hold a doctorate.&lt;ref name="sobrelausfq" /&gt;

The main campus of USFQ is located in Cumbayá, outside of [[Quito]] (capital city of [[Ecuador]]), where students use a library, education and research laboratories, classrooms, and seven restaurants. USFQ is the only university in the world that owns a campus in the [[Galapagos Islands]], and a campus in the [[Yasuni National Park|Yasuni]] [[Biosphere Reserve]] ([[Tiputini Biodiversity Station]]), one of Earth's most biodiverse areas.&lt;ref name="sobrelausfq" /&gt;&lt;ref name="qstopuniversities" /&gt;

==History==
Universidad San Francisco de Quito USFQ was founded in 1988&lt;ref name="sobrelausfq" /&gt; by the ''Corporación de Promoción Universitaria'', its umbrella non-profit foundation. It was the first totally private self-financed university in Ecuador. It was named after the city of [[Quito]]: San Francisco de Quito (not after the saint), in response to the need of a private [[higher education|higher-education]] institution in Ecuador. It was recognized by the [[Ministry of Education and Culture of Ecuador]] in October 1995 and accredited by [http://www.conesup.net CONESUP] in May 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conesup.net/info_universidades.php?id_univ=1038]. conesup.net.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Establishment of the ''Corporación de Promoción Universitaria''===
In 1980, a group of Ecuadorian and international intellectuals and businesspeople, under the leadership of Santiago Gangotena González, established the non-profit ''Corporación de Promoción Universitaria'', with the mission to create a private Ecuadorian university. The corporation was legalized by the [[Ministry of Education and Culture of Ecuador]] in June 1985 (published in the Official Registry of the Ecuadorian Government in 28 de June 1985).

===Foundation of the University===
After eight years of planning and promotion, the first class of USFQ students started on September 1, 1988, in a manor located on the 12 de Octubre Ave. 1983 and Salazar St.,in the northern area of [[Quito]], with 130 students. The university was recognized by the Ecuadorian government on October 18, 1995, under Executive Decree 3166, published in the Official Registry 809 on October 25, 1995. The statutes of the university were approved by the National Council of High Education [http://www.conesup.net CONESUP] on May 18, 2001.

===Creation of the colleges===
USFQ is divided among academic colleges ([[Faculty (division)|faculties]]). In 1988, students were distributed among three academic colleges: ''Colegio de Administración para el Desarrollo'' for business studies, ''Colegio de Ciencias Aplicadas'' for applied sciences, and ''Colegio de Comunicación y Cultura'' for communication, arts and cultural studies. In 1990, USFQ started the ''Colegio de Ciencias Ambientales'' for environmental sciences.

In 1992, six colleges were established: ''Colegio de Administración para el Desarrollo'', ''Colegio de Comunicación y Artes'', ''Colegio de Ciencias Ambientales'', ''Colegio de Ciencias Aplicadas'', ''Colegio de Ciencias Sociales y Humanidades'', y ''Colegio de Lenguas''. Subsequently, in 1993, the ''Colegio de Arquitectura'' started, followed in 1994 by the ''Colegio de Agricultura'' and the ''Colegio de Ciencias de la Salud''. In 1997, the ''Colegio de Ciencias Sociales y Humanidades'' changed its name to ''Colegio de Artes Liberales''.

===Colleges of the university===
By 2017, USFQ is divided in 15 academic colleges and institutes spread across three campuses across [[Ecuador]] ([[Quito|Cumbayá-Quito]], [[Tiputini Biodiversity Station]], and the [[Galápagos Islands]]&lt;ref name="sobrelausfq" /&gt;):

'''Virilization''' or '''masculinization'''&lt;!-- NOTE: The term "masculinization" redirects here. Because of this, and WP:Alternative title, the term should be bolded and mentioned in the lead. --&gt; is the biological development of [[sex differences]], changes that make a [[male]] body different from a [[female]] body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/virilization|title=Virilization definition and meaning {{!}} Collins English Dictionary|website=www.collinsdictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the changes of virilization are produced by [[androgen]]s. Virilization is most commonly used in three medical and [[biology of gender]] contexts: prenatal [[sexual differentiation]], the postnatal changes of normal male [[puberty]], and excessive androgen effects in females.

==Prenatal virilization==
In the prenatal period, virilization refers to closure of the [[perineum]], thinning and wrinkling (rugation) of the [[scrotum]], growth of the [[phallus]], and closure of the [[urethral groove]] to the tip of the [[penis]]. In this context, ''masculinization'' is synonymous with ''virilization.''

Prenatal virilization of genetic females and undervirilization of genetic males are common causes of [[ambiguous genitalia]] and [[intersex]] conditions.

===High===
Prenatal virilization of a genetically female fetus can occur when an excessive amount of androgen is produced by the fetal [[adrenal gland]]s or is present in maternal blood. In the severest form of [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]], complete masculinization of a genetically female fetus results in an apparently normal male anatomy with no palpable [[testes]]. More often, the virilization is partial and the genitalia are ambiguous.

It can also be associated with [[progestin-induced virilisation]].

===Low===
''Undervirilization'' can occur if a genetic male cannot produce enough androgen or the body tissues cannot respond to it. Extreme undervirilization occurs when no significant androgen hormones can be produced or the body is completely insensitive to androgens. Both result in a female body. Partial undervirilization produces ambiguous genitalia part-way between male and female. The mildest degree of undervirilization may be a slightly small penis. Examples of undervirilization are [[androgen insensitivity syndrome]], [[5 alpha reductase deficiency]], and some forms of [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]].

==Normal virilization==
{{See also|Puberty#Changes in males}}
In common as well as medical usage, virilization often refers to the process of normal male [[puberty]]. These effects include growth of the penis and testes, accelerated growth, [[Pubarche|development of pubic hair]], and other androgenic hair of face, torso, and limbs, [[Voice change|deepening of the voice]], increased musculature, thickening of the jaw, prominence of the neck cartilage, and broadening of the shoulders.

==Abnormal childhood virilization==
Virilization can occur in childhood in both males and females due to excessive amounts of androgens. Typical effects of virilization in children are [[pubic hair]], accelerated growth and bone maturation, increased [[muscle strength]], [[Acne vulgaris|acne]], and adult body odor. In males, virilization may signal [[precocious puberty]], while [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] and androgen producing tumors (usually) of the [[gonad]]s or adrenals are occasional causes in both sexes.

==In adolescent or adult females==
Virilization in females can manifest as [[clitoris|clitoral]] enlargement, increased muscle strength, acne, [[hirsutism]], frontal hair thinning, deepening of the voice, and [[menstrual period|menstrual]] disruption due to [[anovulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women's Gynecologic Health|first1=Kerri Durnell |last1=Schuiling|first2= Frances E.|last2= Likis|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers|year= 2005|isbn=0-7637-4717-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some of the possible causes of virilization in females are:

* [[Androgen]]-producing tumors of the
** [[ovary|ovaries]]
** [[adrenal gland]]s (see [[adrenal tumor]])
** [[pituitary gland]] (see [[pituitary adenoma]])
* [[Hyperthecosis]]
* [[Hypothyroidism]]
* [[Anabolic steroid]] exposure
* [[Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency]] (late-onset)
* [[Conn's syndrome]]

== Medically induced virilization in transgender people ==
{{See also|Hormone replacement therapy (female-to-male)}}Transgender people who were [[Sex assignment|medically assigned female at birth]] sometimes elect to take [[Hormone replacement therapy (female-to-male)|hormone replacement therapy]]. This process causes virilization by inducing many of the effects of a typically male puberty. Many of these effects are permanent, but some effects can be reversed if the transgender individual stops or pauses their medical treatment.

=== Permanent virilization effects ===
* Deepening of the voice
* Growth of facial and body hair
* Male-pattern [[baldness]]
* Enlargement of the [[clitoris]]
* [[Breast atrophy]] – possible shrinking and/or softening of breasts

=== Reversible virilization effects ===
* Further muscle development (especially upper body)
* Increased sweat and changes in body odor
* Prominence of veins and coarser skin
* Alterations in blood lipids ([[cholesterol]] and [[triglycerides]])
* Increased red blood cell count

==Demasculinization==
Demasculinization refers to the reversal of virilization. Some but not all aspects of virilization are reversible. Demasculinization occurs naturally with [[andropause]], pathologically with [[hypogonadism]], and artificially or medically with [[antiandrogen]]s, [[estrogen (medication)|estrogen]]s, and [[orchiectomy]].

'''Women's empowerment'' is the procedure in which women elaborate and recreate what is that they can be, do, and accomplish in a circumstance that they previously were denied.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Kabeer, Naila. "Gender equality and women's empowerment: A critical analysis of the third millennium development goal 1." ''Gender &amp; Development'' 13.1 (2005): 13-24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mosedale|first=Sarah|date=2005-03-01|title=Assessing women's empowerment: towards a conceptual framework|journal=Journal of International Development|language=en|volume=17|issue=2|pages=243–257|doi=10.1002/jid.1212|issn=1099-1328}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, it is the process for women to redefine gender roles that allows for them to acquire the ability to choose between known alternatives whom have otherwise been restricted from such an ability.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; There are several principles defining women's empowerment such as, for one to be empowered, they must come from a position of disempowerment. Furthermore, one must acquire empowerment themselves rather than have it given to them by an external party. Other studies have found that empowerment definitions entail people having the capability to make important decisions in their lives while also being able to act on them. Lastly, empowerment and disempowerment is relative to other  at a previous time; therefore, empowerment is a process, not a product.&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt;

Women empowerment has become a significant topic of discussion in [[Human development (humanity)|development]] and [[economics]]. It can also point to the approaches regarding other trivialized [[gender]]s in a particular political or social context.

Women's [[economic empowerment]] refers to the ability for women to enjoy their right to control and benefit from the 
resources, [[asset]]s, [[income]] and their own time, as well as the ability to [[Risk management|manage risk]] and improve their economic status and well being.&lt;ref name="Women's Economic Empowerment Conceptual Framework"&gt;Oxfam (Forthcoming), "Women's Economic Empowerment Conceptual Framework"&lt;/ref&gt;

While often interchangeably used, the more comprehensive concept of [[gender empowerment]] refers to people of any gender, stressing the [[Sex and gender distinction|distinction]] between biological  and [[Gender role|gender as a role]]. It thereby also refers to other marginalized genders in a

== Importance of women's empowerment in societies ==
Entire nations, businesses, communities and groups can benefit from the implementation of programs and policies that adopt the notion of women empowerment.&lt;ref name="Deneulin, Séverine 2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://idl-bnc.idrc.ca/dspace/bitstream/10625/40248/1/IDL-40248.pdf|title=An Introduction to the Human Development and Capability Approach: Freedom and Agency|year=2009|editor2=Lila Shahani|publisher=Earthscan|location=Sterling, VA|editor1=Deneulin, Séverine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empowerment of women is a necessity for the very development of a society, since it enhances both the quality and the quantity of human resources available for development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gupta|first=Kamla|last2=Yesudian|first2=P. Princy|date=2006|title=Evidence of women's empowerment in India: a study of socio-spatial disparities|url=|journal=GeoJournal|volume=65|issue=4|pages=365–380|doi=10.1007/s10708-006-7556-z|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Empowerment]] is one of the main procedural concerns when addressing [[human rights and development]].

== Methods ==
Scholars have identified two forms of empowerment, economic empowerment and political empowerment.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Kabeer, Naila. "Contextualising the Economic Pathways of Women's Empowerment: Findings from a Multi-Country Research Programme." (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/librarypage/democratic-governance/inclusive-political-institutions/regional-organizations--gender-equality-and-the-political-empowe.html|title=Regional Organizations, Gender Equality and the Political Empowerment of Women|website=UNDP|language=en|access-date=2018-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic empowerment ===
Economic empowerment increases women's agency, access to formal government programs, mobility outside the home, economic independence, and purchasing power. Policy makers are suggested to support job training to aid in entrance in the formal markets.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; One recommendation is to provide more formal education opportunities for women that would allow for higher bargaining power in the home. They would have more access to higher wages outside the home; and as a result, make it easier for women to get a job in the market.&lt;ref name=":82"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duflo|first=Esther|date=2012|title=Women Empowerment and Economic Development|jstor=23644911|journal=Journal of Economic Literature|volume=50|issue=4|pages=1051–1079}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strengthening women's access to property inheritance and land rights is another method used to economically empower women. This would allow them better means of asset accumulation, capital, and [[bargaining power]] needed to address [[gender inequalities]]. Often, women in developing and underdeveloped nations are legally restricted from their land on the sole basis of gender.&lt;ref name=":82" /&gt; Having a right to their land gives women a sort of bargaining power that they wouldn't normally have; in turn, they gain more opportunities for economic independence and formal financial institutions.

Another popular methodology for women's economic empowerment also includes [[microcredit]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated22"&gt;{{cite report|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/public/WorldSurvey2009.pdf|title=Women's Control over Economic Resources and Access to Financial Resources, including Microfinance|publisher=United Nations|location=New York|section=World Survey on the Role of Women In Development|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microfinance institutions aim to empower women in their community by giving them access to loans that have low interest rates without the requirement of collateral.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Geleta, Esayas Bekele. "Microfinance and the politics of empowerment: a critical cultural perspective." ''Journal of Asian and African Studies'' 49.4 (2014): 413-425.&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, they aim to give microcredit to women who want to be entrepreneurs.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The success and efficiency of microcredit and microloans is controversial and constantly debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Parmar, A.|year=2003|title=Microcredit, Empowerment, and Agency: Re-evaluating the Discourse|journal=Canadian Journal of Development Studies|volume=24|issue=3|pages=461–76|doi=10.1080/02255189.2003.9668932}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critiques claim that microcredit alone doesn't guarantee women have control over the way it is used. Microfinance institutions don't address cultural barriers that allow men to still control household finances; as a result, microcredit may simply be transferred to the husband. Microcredit doesn't relieve women of household obligations, and even if women have credit, they don't have the time to be as active in the market as men.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Ellis, Amanda. ''Gender and economic growth in Kenya: Unleashing the power of women''. World Bank Publications, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political empowerment ===
Political empowerment supports creating policies that would best support gender equality and agency for women in both the public and private spheres. Popular methods that have been suggested are to create affirmative action policies that have a quota for the number of women in policy making and parliament positions.&lt;ref name=":82" /&gt; As of 2017, the global average of women whom hold lower and single house parliament positions is 23.6 percent.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Further recommendations have been to increase women's rights to [[vote]], voice opinions, and the ability to run for office with a fair chance of being elected.&lt;ref name="Deneulin, Séverine 2009" /&gt; Because women are typically associated with child care and domestic responsibilities in the home, they have less time dedicated to entering the labour market and running their business. Policies that increase their [[bargaining power]] in the household would include policies that account for cases of divorce, policies for better welfare for women, and policies that give women control over resources (such as property rights).&lt;ref name=":82" /&gt; However, participation is not limited to the realm of politics. It can include participation in the [[household]], in schools, and the ability to make choices for oneself. Some theorists believe that bargaining power and agency in the household must to be achieved before one can move onto broader political participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women and Human Development: The Capabilities to Approach|author=Nussbaum, Martha C.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=9781139459358|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=1–33|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measurement and assessment ==
Women empowerment can be measured through the [[Gender Empowerment Measure]] (GEM), which shows women's participation in a given nation, both politically and economically. GEM is calculated by tracking "the share of seats in [[parliament]] held by women; of female legislators, senior officials and managers; and of female profession and technical workers; and the [[gender disparity]] in earned income, reflecting economic independence".&lt;ref name="Deneulin, Séverine 2009" /&gt; It then ranks countries given this information. Other measures that take into account the importance of female participation and equality include: the [[Gender Parity Index]] and the [[Gender-related Development Index]] (GDI).&lt;ref name="Deneulin, Séverine 2009" /&gt;

Some critiques of GEM is that it is not concerned with factors regarding society, such as gender, religion, cultural context, legal context, and violations of women's rights.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;Charmes, Jacques, and Saskia Wieringa. "Measuring women's empowerment: an assessment of the gender-related development index and the gender empowerment measure." ''Journal of Human Development'' 4.3 (2003): 419-435.&lt;/ref&gt; Gender empowerment measure attempts to makes a consistent standardized approach to measure women's empowerment; in doing so, it has been critiqued that the GEM doesn't account for variation in historical factors, female autonomy, gender segregation, and women's right to vote.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pillarisetti|first=J.|last2=McGillivray|first2=Mark|date=1998-06-01|title=Human Development and Gender Empowerment: Methodological and Measurement Issues|journal=Development Policy Review|language=en|volume=16|issue=2|pages=197–203|doi=10.1111/1467-7679.00059|issn=1467-7679}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gender-related Development Index (GDI) is a way in which the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) measures the inequality between genders within a country. Some critique of this measurement is that, because GDI calculations rely solely on the achievement distribution between males and females of a population, GDI doesn't measure gender inequality; rather, it measures absolute levels on income, education and health&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

A more qualitative form of assessing women's empowerment is to identify constraints to action. This allows for the identification of power relations between genders. Because this is a participatory process, it facilitates conversation on gender discrimination.&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt; Comparing constraints on women at a later time also allows for any changes or expansion to be better identified. The evaluation of the development of women's agency allows for an evaluation of actions taken. These assessments must also be based on the action taken by women, and not external groups. External groups can help facilitate women's empowerment, but cannot bestow it on them.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt;

== Barriers ==

Many of the barriers to women's empowerment and equity lie ingrained in cultural norms. Many women feel these pressures, while others have become accustomed to being treated inferior to men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women, Culture, and Development: A Study of Human Capabilities|author=Nussbaum, Martha C.|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1995|isbn=9780198289647|editor1=Martha C. Nussbaum|location=Oxford|pages=1–15|chapter=Introduction|editor2=Jonathan Glover|lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if [[legislators]], [[NGOs]], etc. are aware of the benefits women's empowerment and participation can have, many are scared of disrupting the status of the women and continue to let [[societal norms]] get in the way of development.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite report|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/public/WorldSurvey2009.pdf|title=Women's Control over Economic Resources and Access to Financial Resources, including Microfinance|publisher=United Nations|location=New York|section=World Survey on the Role of Women In Development|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research shows that the increasing access to the internet can also result in an increased exploitation of women.&lt;ref name="Sutton, J. 2000" /&gt; Releasing personal information on websites has put some women's personal safety at risk. In 2010, Working to Halt Online Abuse stated that 73% of women were victimized through such sites. Types of victimization include [[cyber stalking]], harassment, [[online pornography]], and [[flaming (Internet)|flaming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Morahan-Martin, J.|year=2000|title=Women and the Internet: Promise and Perils|journal=Cyber Psychology &amp; Behavior|volume=3|issue=5|pages=683–691|doi=10.1089/10949310050191683}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sexual harassment]] in particular is a large barrier for women in the workplace. It appears in almost all industries, but is most notable in the following: business, trade, banking and finance, sales and marketing, hospitality, civil service, and education, lecturing and teaching.&lt;ref name="Statistics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aware.org.sg/training/wsh-site/14-statistics/|title=Statistics|date=22 April 2010|work=AWARE RSS|publisher=AWARE|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the International Labour Organisation (ILO), sexual harassment is a clear form of gender discrimination based on sex, a manifestation of unequal power relations between men and women. Furthermore, the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) is urging for increased measures of protection for women against sexual harassment and violence in the workplace. 54% (272) had experienced some form of workplace sexual harassment. 79% of the victims are women; 21% were men.&lt;ref name="Statistics" /&gt;

Recent studies also show that women face more barriers in the workplace than do men. Gender-related barriers involve sexual harassment, unfair hiring practices, career progression, and unequal pay where women are paid less than men are for performing the same job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stein, A.I.|year=2009|title=Women Lawyers Blog for Workplace Equality: Blogging as a Feminist Legal Method|url=http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1287&amp;context=yjlf|journal=Yale Journal of Law and Feminism|volume=20|issue=2|pages=357–408}}&lt;/ref&gt; When taking the median earnings of men and women who worked full-time, year-round, government data from 2014 showed that women made $0.79 for every dollar a man earned. The average earnings for working mothers came out to even less—$0.71 for every dollar a father made, according to a 2014 study conducted by the National Partnership for Women and Children. While much of the public discussion of the "[[Gender pay gap|wage gap]]" has focused around women getting equal pay for the same work as their male peers, many women struggle with what is called the "pregnancy penalty". The main problem is that it is difficult to measure, but some experts say that the possibility of having a baby can be enough for employers to push women back from their line.&lt;ref name="NBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/business/careers/motherhood-penalty-can-affect-women-who-never-even-have-child-n548511|title='Motherhood Penalty' Can Affect Women Who Never Even Have a Child|author=Safia Samee Ali|date=April 11, 2016|work=NBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, women are put in a position where they need to make the decision of whether to maintain in the workforce or have children. This problem has sparked the debate over maternity leave in the United States.

However, despite the struggle for equal pay in the United States, the tech industry{{clarify|date=June 2017}} has made progress in helping to encourage equal pay across gender. In March 2016, tech career website Dice released a study of more than 16,000 tech professionals that found that when you compare equivalent education, experience and position, there is no pay gap—and hasn't been for the last six years.&lt;ref name="NBC" /&gt; This new industry is paving a way for other companies to do the same. However, this industry also struggles to employ women in executive positions. This is partially due to the barrier of sexual harassment and pregnancy that was aforementioned.

Such barriers make it difficult for women to advance in their workplace or receive fair compensation for the work they provide.

== Role of education ==
It is said that education increases "people's self-confidence and also enables them to find better jobs and they can work shoulder to shoulder with men".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marniemi|first=J.|last2=Parkki|first2=M. G.|date=1975-09-01|title=Radiochemical assay of glutathione S-epoxide transferase and its enhancement by phenobarbital in rat liver in vivo|journal=Biochemical Pharmacology|volume=24|issue=17|pages=1569–1572|issn=0006-2952|pmid=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; They engage in public debate and make demands on government for health care, social security and other entitlements".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;UNDP. 2013. Human Development Report. The Rise of the South. Human Progress in a Diverse World; New York, UNDP.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, education empowers women to make choices that improve their children's health, their well-being, and chances of survival.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2014. EFA Global Monitoring Report 2013/2014: Teaching and Learning, Paris, UNESCO.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Education informs others of preventing and containing the disease, and it is an essential element of efforts to reduce malnutrition. Furthermore, it empowers women to make choices that can improve their welfare, including marrying beyond childhood and having fewer children. Crucially, education can increase women's awareness of their rights, boost their self-esteem, and provide them the opportunity to assert their rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002343/234325E.pdf|title=Mobile phones and literacy: Empowerment in Women's Hands; A Cross-Case Analysis of Nine Experiences|last=UNESCO|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100123-9|location=33|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite significant improvements in recent decades, education is not universally available and gender inequalities persist. A major concern in many countries is not only the limited numbers of girls going to school but also the limited educational pathways for those that step into the classroom. More specifically, there should be more efforts to address the lower participation and learning achievement of [[Female education in STEM|girls in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cracking the code: girls' and women's education in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=9789231002335|location=Paris|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Internet as a tool of empowerment ==

The growing access of the web in the late 20th century has allowed women to empower themselves by using various tools on the Internet. With the introduction of the [[World Wide Web]], women have begun to use social networking sites like [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] for [[online activism]].&lt;ref name="Sutton, J. 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sutton, J.|author2=Pollock, S.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2000|title=Online Activism for Women's Rights|journal=Cyber Psychology &amp; Behavior|volume=3|issue=5|pages=699–706|doi=10.1089/10949310050191700}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through online activism, women are able to empower themselves by organizing campaigns and voicing their opinions for equality rights without feeling oppressed by members of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Churchyard, N.|year=2009|title=The Question of Empowerment: Women's Perspective on Their Internet Use|journal=[[Gender, Technology and Development]]|volume=13|issue=3|pages=341–363|doi=10.1177/097185241001300302}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, on May 29, 2013, an online campaign started by 100 female advocates forced the leading social networking website, Facebook, to take down various pages that spread hatred about women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=McVeigh, T.|date=June 6, 2013|title=Online Feminist activists of the digital age|work=Taipei Times|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2013/06/06/2003564076}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, [[blogging]] has also become a powerful tool for the educational empowerment of women. According to a study done by the University of California, Los Angeles, medical patients who read and write about their disease are often in a much happier mood and more knowledgeable than those who do not.&lt;ref name="breastcancer.about.com"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stephan, P.|date=August 13, 2013|title=Breast cancer patients blog their blues away|url=http://breastcancer.about.com/b/2013/08/13/blog-the-blues-away.htm|journal=Breastcancer.about.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; By reading others' experiences, patients can better educate themselves and apply strategies that their fellow bloggers suggest.&lt;ref name="breastcancer.about.com"/&gt;

With the easy accessibility and affordability of [[e-learning]] (electronic learning), women can now study from the comfort of their homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Radovic-Markovic, M.|author2=Nelson-Porter, B.|author3=Omolaja, M.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2012|title=The new alternative women's entrepreneurship education: E-learning and virtual universities|journal=International Women Online Journal of Distance Education|volume=1|issue=2|pages=46–54|url=http://wojde.org/FileUpload/bs295854/File/06a.markovic.pdf|issn=2147-0367}}&lt;/ref&gt; By empowering themselves educationally through new technologies like e-learning, women are also learning new skills that will come in handy in today's advancing globalized world.

Often times, the internet is very useful as source of empowerment for women through its creation, dispersion, and utilization of hashtags on social media. One prime example of hashtags supporting women empowerment was in 2017 when the #AintNoCinderella hashtag came into existence. This hashtag spread like wildfire on social media after Varnika Kundu (a 29-year-old woman in India) was driving home past midnight on August 4 when she was followed and harassed by two men in a SUV{{cn|date=October 2018}}. Kundu was blamed for being out late at night, particularly by the BJP government Vice-President Ramveer Bhatti. This lead to women all across India and the world posting pictures of themselves out late at night with the hashtag "#AintNoCinderella" to show that women do not have a particular curfew to which they have to adhere to (like Cinderella did). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/ain-t-no-cinderella-women-hit-out-bjp-leader-blaming-chandigarh-stalking-victim-66456|title=Ain’t no Cinderella: Women hit out at BJP leader for blaming Chandigarh stalking victim|date=2017-08-08|work=The News Minute|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ongoing projects ==
The UN came out with a set of goals called the Sustainable Development Goals, or SDGs, to help make the world a better place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/|title=Sustainable development goals - United Nations|work=United Nations Sustainable Development|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 17, the fourth goal works to allow access to education for all people alike. A large effort has been made to include women in schools to better their education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/education/|title=Education - United Nations Sustainable Development|work=United Nations Sustainable Development|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the fifth goal focuses on empowering women and girls to achieve gender equality through equal access to various types of opportunities (health care, education, work, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/gender-equality/|title=United Nations: Gender equality and women's empowerment|work=United Nations Sustainable Development|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also some prominent non-profits that help empower women:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thepowerofpurpose.com/10-amazing-nonprofits-empowering-women-2017/|title=10 Amazing Nonprofits Empowering Women in 2017 - The Power of Purpose|date=2017-01-26|work=The Power of Purpose|access-date=2018-03-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== U.S. involvement ===

Domestically, the U.S. empowered women through passings of laws such as allowing women to vote in 1920, banning discrimination based on gender in 1964, banning discrimination against pregnant women in 1978, etc. Additionally, the inclusion of women in politics allowed for more gender equality. The first female speaker of House, the first First Lady to run for president, and first women to serve on the Supreme Court were monumental events that proved socially the acceptance of "subservient" women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nwhp.org/resources/womens-rights-movement/detailed-timeline/|title=Detailed Timeline {{!}} National Women's History Project|website=www.nwhp.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. provides foreign aid to third world countries in various forms, one of which is by providing education programs. There are currently bills in Congress that work to ensure education to girls, one of which is the Protecting Girls' Access to Education Act. These are enacted with the belief that proper education will pull them out of poverty and reduce exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/2408|title=H.R.2408 - 115th Congress (2017-2018): Protecting Girls' Access to Education Act|last=Steve|first=Chabot|date=2017-10-04|website=www.congress.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another action taken on by the U.S is the [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief|PEPFAR]] program, initiated by the Bush administration in 2003. The U.S. spent more than $1.4 billion in funding sub-Saharan Africa during the duration of the program.

The '''Överkalix study''' ({{lang-sv|Överkalixstudien}}) was a study conducted on the physiological  effects of various environmental factors on [[Transgenerational epigenetics|transgenerational epigenetic]] inheritance. The study was conducted utilizing historical records, including [[harvests]] and food prices, in [[Överkalix]],  a small isolated [[municipality]] in northeast [[Sweden]]. The study was of 303 [[probands]], 164 men and 139 women, born in 1890, 1905, or 1920, and their 1,818 children and grandchildren. 44 were still alive in 1995 when mortality follow-up stopped. [[Mortality rate|Mortality]] risk ratios (RR) on children and grandchildren were determined based on available [[Food security|food supply]], as indicated by historical data.

Among the sex-specific effects noted; a greater [[body mass index]] (BMI) at 9 years in sons, but not daughters, of fathers who began smoking early. The paternal grandfather's food supply was only linked to the mortality RR of grandsons and not granddaughters. The paternal grandmother's  food supply was only associated with the granddaughters' mortality risk ratio. The grandmother having a good food supply was associated with a twofold higher mortality (RR). 
This transgenerational inheritance was observed with exposure during the [[slow growth period]] (SGP). The SGP is the time before the start of [[puberty]], when environmental factors have a larger impact on the body. The ancestors' SGP in this study, was set between the ages of 9-12 for boys and 8–10 years for girls. This occurred in the SGP of both grandparents, or during the [[gestation]] period/infant life of the grandmothers, but not during either grandparent's puberty. The father's poor food supply and the mother's good food supply were associated with a lower risk of [[cardiovascular]] death.&lt;ref name="Lalande-1996"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Lalande | first1 = M. | title = Parental imprinting and human disease. | journal = Annu Rev Genet | volume = 30 | issue =  | pages = 173–95 | month =  | year = 1996 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genet.30.1.173 | PMID = 8982453 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only the female probands experienced a twofold higher mortality RR when the paternal grandmother had good food availability during her SGP, compared to the mortality risk of those whose paternal grandmothers had poor food supply during the SGP.

Using the same data, another investigation highlighted that a sharp change in food availability in paternal grandmothers' resulted in an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality in granddaughters adults' life.&lt;ref name="Bygren-2014"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Bygren | first1 = LO. | last2 = Tinghög | first2 = P. | last3 = Carstensen | first3 = J.  | last4 = Edvinsson | first4 = S.  | last5 = Kaati | first5 = G.  | last6 = Pembrey | first6 = ME.  | last7 = Sjöström | first7 = M.   | title = Change in paternal grandmothers' early food supply influenced cardiovascular mortality of the female grandchildren. | journal = BMC Genetics | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 12 |date=Feb 2014 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2156-15-12 | PMID = 24552514 | pmc=3929550}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such an effect was not observed in other grandparents. The grandparents were considered exposed if they experienced drastic change in their early life ranging from embryo to 13 years old.

Sex-specific effects can be due to parental imprinting a process that results in allele-specific differences in transcription, [[DNA methylation]], and [[DNA]] [[replication timing]]. Imprinting is an important process in human development, and its deregulation can cause certain defined disease states of other imprinted human disease loci. The establishment of parental imprints occurs  during [[gametogenesis]] as [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] [[DNA]] passes through [[sperm]] or [[Ovum|egg]]; subsequently during [[embryogenesis]] and into adulthood, [[alleles]] of imprinted genes are maintained in two "conformational"/epigenetic states: [[paternal]] or [[maternal]]. Thus, genomic imprints template their own replication, are heritable, can be identified by molecular analysis, and serve as markers of the parental origin of genomic regions.

The estimation of percentage of human genes subject to parental imprinting is approximately one to two percent, currently parental imprinting has been identified in fewer than 100 distinct named genes.&lt;ref name="Kaati-2002"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Kaati | first1 = G. | last2 = Bygren | first2 = LO. | last3 = Edvinsson | first3 = S. | title = Cardiovascular and diabetes mortality determined by nutrition during parents' and grandparents' slow growth period. | journal = Eur J Hum Genet | volume = 10 | issue = 11 | pages = 682–8 |date=Nov 2002 | doi = 10.1038/sj.ejhg.5200859 | PMID = 12404098 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
