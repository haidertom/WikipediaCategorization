'''''A Book of Wisdom and Lies''''' ({{lang-ka|წიგნი სიბრძნე სიცრუისა}}) is a collection of fables and tales written by  [[Sulkhan-Saba Orbeliani]] between 1686 and 1695.

Sulkhan-Saba Orbeliani was 20–25 years old he wrote a collection of fables and tales “Sibrdzne Sitsruisa” (“A Book of Wisdom and Lies”), which is a fruit of his observation over life. The reader feels how ably, deliberately and naturally the great creator interlaces some idea, intelligence and results of living observations in humans and animals. He knows the human nature, all its strong and weak points well. He describes various sides of human actions; he gives answers to many questions and you realize that a human should create kindness in his life.

One of the most famous works by the 17th-18th Century Georgian man of letters, containing Sufic and other narratives, tales and anecdotes. "Racy, clear and humorous--though the serious parts also read convincingly."&lt;ref&gt;http://jrumblr.com/2435469.A_Book_of_Wisdom_and_Lies.html&lt;/ref&gt;—Professor [[David Marshall Lang|David Lang]].

'''Alternative formats''' include [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]], [[braille]], [[E-text|electronic]] or [[large print]] versions of standard print such as educational material, textbooks, information leaflets, and even people's personal bills and letters. Alternative formats are created to help people who are blind or visual impaired to gain assess to their personal and leisure information either by sight (large print), by ear (audio) or by touch (braille).

== Audio ==
Audio information is beneficial for many people and can be used by anyone who owns a CD player, a [[DAISY Digital Talking Book|DAISY player]] or a computer. Audio enables people who are blind or visual impaired to access information through hearing, in the sense that print readers would understand it. 

=== Choosing audio ===
Different people are likely to have their own preferences about the way they access audio, depending on their experiences, how comfortable are they with technology, and the equipment they to access the audio content.

=== CD as a medium for accessing information ===
[[File:Interference-colors.jpg|thumb|Interference-colors]]
[[Compact Discs]] (CDs) were first produced  in the 1980s to store and playback sound recordings exclusively, and became superior to [[cassette tapes]] (AC) offering better sound and size. Standard CDs have a diameter of 120 millimetres (4.7 in) and can hold up to 80 minutes of uncompressed audio (or 700 Megabytes of data). CDs offer some navigation from the beginning of one track to another, rather than having to fast forward or rewind and guess where the tracks started and finished.[[File:Cassette-tape 8192.jpg|thumb|Cassette-tape 8192]]

Over time, CDs have progressed from being solely for music, to being a format for all kinds of data storage, such as text, images, photos and videos. Educators can use CDs to store educational materials including taped lectures, presentations, and handouts into one compact disc for the student to access on CD players or computers.

== Braille ==
Braille is a tactile system of raised dots that enables people who are visual impaired or blind to access information by touch. The pattern of raised dots is arranged in cells of up to six dots, creating a total of 63 different combinations possible. Each cell represents an alphabet letter, numeral or punctuation mark. Some frequently used words and letter combinations also have their own single cell patterns.

[[File:A person reading a braille book.jpg|thumb|A person reading a braille book]]
Braille can be the building block for language skills and a way to teach spelling, grammar, and punctuations to people with vision loss or who are deaf-blind. Not only do Braille codes represent alphabets, they also denote numbers, symbols, music and mathematical notations, enabling people to learn about different subjects in a different way from most of us. Braille books are available in all subject areas, ranging from modern fiction to mathematics, music and law. As with printed text, Braille makes it possible for people to access information in this format.

== Electronic (e-text) ==
For many of us, having access to computer equipment and appropriate software makes written information accessible. Today’s technology allows people to do majority of their research online, share documents via email, and download lecture notes from school websites. With written text converted into a format that is readable on the computer, it can be accessed visually with screen magnification software, or through auditory means with text-to-speech technology.

== Large print ==
Large print is essential for people who have visual or learning difficulties and have trouble reading fine print or deciphering crowded text at one time. Large print usually ranges from 16 to 22 point, while giant print uses fonts that are bigger than 24 point.

Having one single size will not meet everyone’s needs; therefore, it is important to find out which is a comfortable reading size for each individual. Research has demonstrated the positive impacts of providing enlarged font size for people with mild to moderate visual impairments, resulting in an increased reading fluency and speed.

'''''An American Dream: The Life of an African American Soldier and POW Who Spent Twelve Years in Communist China''''' is a memoir by Corporal [[Clarence Adams (Korean War)|Clarence Adams]] [[List of works published posthumously|posthumously]] published by the [[University of Massachusetts Press]] and edited by Della Adams and [[Louis H. Carlson]].

== Summary ==
Adams was one of [[List of American and British defectors in the Korean War|21 Americans]] who refused repatriation to the United States in favor of going to China after being a [[POW]] during the [[Korean War]].  The book follows Adams's youth in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Tennessee]] through his time in the Korean War as a POW and his return to Memphis with his Chinese wife and children.  It deals heavily with [[race relations]] in the [[Southern United States|South]] in both the 1930s and 1940s of Adams's youth and following his return to the US in 1966 during the [[Civil Rights Movement]] as well as the [[red scare]] of the [[Cold War]].  Throughout the book, Adams cites racism, lack of opportunity, and curiosity as his main reasons for defecting and maintained his right to do so despite investigations into and questioning of his activities in China by the [[FBI]].

== Related books ==
Adams's autobiography is one of three books dedicated to the 21 Americans who chose to go to China rather than repatriate to the United States.  The first book, ''21 Stayed: The Story of the American GIs Who Chose Communist China'', by Virginia Pasley is a largely unsympathetic account of the twenty published not long after they first went over to China.  The book is divided into chapters by the soldier discussed and based on interviews with the family of the soldiers and those who knew them and prefaced by information provided by the [[US military]] on the soldiers and accounts of their activities in POW camps.  The second book written was [[List of American defectors in the Korean War|Morris Wills]]'s memoir, ''[[Turncoat: An American's 12 Years in Communist China]]''.  Written during the [[Vietnam War]], Wills's biography is more sympathetic to the twenty one than Pasley's account but somewhat apologetic and still provides a rather negative in regards to the Chinese Communists.  Adams's book is far less apologetic than Wills's and provides a less negative portrait of the Chinese.

'''Brazilian painting''', or '''visual arts''', emerged in the late 16th century, influenced by the [[Baroque]] style imported from [[Portugal]]. Until the beginning of the 19th century, that style was the dominant school of [[painting]] in [[Brazil]], flourishing across the whole of the settled territories, mainly along the coast but also in important inland centers like [[Minas Gerais]]. Major painters in this period were [[Ricardo do Pilar]], [[José Joaquim da Rocha]], [[José Teófilo de Jesus]], [[Joaquim José da Natividade]], [[José Eloy]], [[Manuel de Jesus Pinto]], [[João de Deus Sepúlveda]], [[Manuel da Cunha]], but chief among them was [[Manuel da Costa Ataíde]], working towards the end of the 18th century, head of the first original school of painting in the country, with a delicate and somewhat personal interpretation of [[Rococo]] style in which he first depicted angels and saints with [[mulatto#Brazil|mulato]] features.

A sudden break with the Baroque tradition was imposed on the art of the nation by the arrival of the Portuguese court in 1808, fleeing the French invasion of Portugal. However, Baroque painting still survived in many places until the end of the 19th century. In 1816, the king, [[John VI of Portugal|John VI]], supported the project of creating a national Academy at the suggestion of some French artists led by [[Joachim Lebreton]], a group later known as the [[Missão Artística Francesa|French Artistic Mission]]. They were instrumental in introducing the [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] style and a new concept of artistic education mirroring the European academies, being the first teachers at the newly founded school of art. Through the following 70 years, the ''Royal School of Sciences, Arts and Crafts'', later renamed the [[Imperial Academy of Fine Arts (Brazil)|Imperial Academy of Fine Arts]], would dictate the standards in art, a mixed trend of Neoclassicism, [[Romanticism]], and [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] with nationalist inclinations which would be the basis for the production of a large amount of canvases depicting the nation's history, battle scenes, landscapes, portraits, genre painting, and still lifes, and featuring national characters like black people and Indians. [[Victor Meirelles]], [[Pedro Américo]], and [[Almeida Junior]] were the leaders of such academic art, but this period also received important contributions from foreigners like [[Georg Grimm]], [[Augusto Müller]], and [[Nicola Antonio Facchinetti]].

In 1889 the monarchy was abolished, and the republican government renamed the Imperial Academy the [[National School of the Fine Arts]], which would be short-lived, absorbed in 1931 by the [[Federal University of Rio de Janeiro]]. Meanwhile, [[Modernism]] was already being cultivated in [[São Paulo]] and by some academic painters, and the new movement superseded [[Academicism]]. In 1922 the event called ''[[Week of Modern Art]]'' broke definitely with academic tradition and started a nationalist trend which was, however, influenced by [[Primitivism]] and by European [[Expressionism]], [[Surrealism]] and [[Cubism]]. [[Anita Malfatti]], [[Ismael Nery]], [[Lasar Segall]], [[Emiliano di Cavalcanti]], [[Vicente do Rego Monteiro]], and [[Tarsila do Amaral]] wrought major changes in painting, while groups like [[Grupo Santa Helena|Santa Helena]] and [[Núcleo Bernardelli]] evolved toward a moderate interpretation of Modernism, with important artists such as [[Aldo Bonadei]] and [[José Pancetti]]. [[Cândido Portinari]] is the best example of this last tendency. Under government patronage he dominated Brazilian painting in the mid-20th century until [[Abstractionism]] showed up in the 1950s.

The period between 1950 and 1970 witnessed the emergence of many new styles. [[Action painting]], [[Lyrical Abstraction]], [[Neoconcretism]], [[Neoexpressionism]], [[Pop art]], [[Neorealism (art)|Neorealism]] — all contributed to some extent to the creation of huge diversity in Brazilian painting and to the updating of Brazilian art. After a period of relative decline in the conceptualist 1970s, national art revived in the 1980s under the influence of the world's renewed interest in traditional painting. Then Brazilian painting showed a new strength, spread across the whole country, and started being appreciated in international forums.

==Before the Portuguese discovery==
[[File:Serra da Capivara - Several Paintings 2.jpg|thumb|left|Prehistoric paintings at [[Serra da Capivara National Park]].]]

Relatively little is known in respect to the pictorial art practiced in Brazil before the Portuguese discovery of the territory. The [[indigenous people]] the colonizers encountered did not practice painting as it was known in Europe, using paint for bodily decoration and the decoration of ceramic artifacts. Among the indigenous relics that survived this era, a good collection of pieces from the [[Marajoara]], [[Tapajós]] and [[Santarém, Pará|Santarém]] cultures stand out, but the ceramic tradition as much as that of body painting have been preserved by the indigenous that still reside in Brazil, the elements among them being some of the most distinctive of their cultures. There also exist diverse painted panels of hunting scenes and other figures created by [[pre-historic peoples]] in caves and on rock walls in certain [[archeological sites]]. These paintings probably had ritual functions and would have been seen as endowed with magical powers, capable of capturing the souls of depicted animals and therefore allowing for successful hunts. The most ancient complex of sites known is that of the [[Serra da Capivara]], at [[Piauí]], which exhibits painted remains dated 32&amp;nbsp;thousand years ago. None of these traditions, however, was incorporated into the artistic current introduced by the Portuguese colonizers, which became predominant. As [[Roberto Burle Marx]] put it, the art of [[colonial Brazil]] is, in every sense, art of the Portuguese mother country, although on Brazilian soil various imposed adaptations have occurred through the specific local circumstances of the colonial process.

==Precursors==
[[File:Belchior-reismagos.jpg|thumb|Belchior Paulo: ''Adoration of the Magi'', Church of the Magi, [[Nova Almeida]], [[Espírito Santo]].]]

Among the first explorers of the newly discovered land came artists and naturalists, charged with making a visual register of the flora, fauna, geography and native peoples, working only with [[watercolor]] and [[engraving]]. One can cite the Frenchman, [[Jean Gardien]], who produced illustrations of animals for the book, ''Histoire d'un Voyage faict en la terre du Brésil, autrement dite Amerique'', published in 1578 by [[Jean de Lery]], and the priest [[André Thevet]], who declared to have naturally produced all of the illustrations for his three scientific books edited in 1557, 1575, and 1584, where a portrait of the Indian [[Cunhambebe]]&lt;ref&gt;Louzada, Maria Alice &amp; Louzada, Julio. [http://www.juliolouzada.com.br/primeirosmomentos.asp ''Os Primeiros Momentos da Arte Brasileira''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706153216/http://www.juliolouzada.com.br/primeirosmomentos.asp |date=July 6, 2011 }}. Júlio Louzada Artes Plásticas Brasil. Acesso 5 out 2010&lt;/ref&gt; was included.

Such output from the travelers still displayed features of late [[renaissance]] art, also known as [[Mannerism]], and became increasingly part of the European artistic atmosphere, for whose public it was produced, than the Brazilian, even though of larger interest were the landscape portraits and those of people from the early colonial period. The first known European painter that left work in Brazil was the [[Jesuit]] priest Manuel Sanches (or Manuel Alves), who passed through [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]] in 1560 en route to the [[West Indies]] but left at least one painted panel at the [[Jesuit Society]] school in that city. Even more noteworthy was the frier [[Belchior Paulo]], who docked here in 1587 together with other Jesuits, and left decorative works spread out among many of the major Jesuit Society schools until his trail was abruptly lost in 1619. With Belchior, the history of Brazilian painting had effectively begun.&lt;ref&gt;Leite, José Roberto Teixeira &amp; Lemos, Carlos A.C. ''Os Primeiros Cem Anos'', in Civita, Victor.

==Pernambuco and the Dutch==

The first Brazilian cultural nucleus that resembled a European court was founded in [[Recife]] in 1637 by the Dutch administrator, count [[Maurício de Nassau]]. Heir of the [[Renaissance]] spirit, as described by Gouvêa, Nassau implemented a series of administrative and infrastructural reforms in what was known as, ''[[Dutch Brazil]]''. Furthermore, he brought in his entourage a plethora of scientists, humanists and artists, who brought about a brilliant outside culture to the locale, and although they weren't able to reach all of their higher objectives, their presence resulted in the preparation, by white men in the tropics, of an unparalleled cultural work for the time and something considerably superior to what was being carried out by the Portuguese in other parts of the territory. Two painters stood out in their circle, [[Frans Post]] and [[Albert Eckhout]], producing works that allied a detailed documentary character to a superlative aesthetic quality, and up to today they stand as one of the primary sources of the study of landscape, nature and life of [[indigenous peoples]] and [[slaves]] of that region. This work, though it was returned to Europe upon the departure of the count in 1644, represented, in painting, the last echo of the Renaissance aesthetic on Brazilian soil.&lt;ref&gt;Gouvêa, Fernando da Cruz. [https://books.google.com/books?id=VH_CS3ef9KgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=pt-BR#v=onepage&amp;q=a%20corte%20nassoviana%20no%20brasil&amp;f=false ''Maurício de Nassau e o Brasil Holandês'']. Editora Universitária UFPE, 1998. pp. 143-149; 186-188&lt;/ref&gt;

==The flourishing Baroque==

Between the 17th and 18th Centuries the Brazilian painting style was the [[Baroque]], a reaction against the [[classicism]] of the Renaissance, originating through the asymmetry, the excessive, the expressive, and the irregular. Far from representing a purely [[aesthetic]] tendency, these features constituted a true way of life and gave tone to the whole culture of the period, a culture that emphasized contrast, the conflict, the dynamic, the dramatic, the grandiloquent, the dissolution of limits, together with an accentuated taste for opulence of forms and materials, transforming into a perfect vehicle for the [[Catholic Church]] of the [[counter reform]] and the ascending [[absolute monarchies]] to express their ideas visually. The monumental structures raised during the Baroque, such as the [[palaces]] and the great [[theaters]] and [[church (building)|church]]es, sought to create a spectacular and exuberant natural impact, offering an integration between the various artistic languages and catching the observer in a [[cathartic]] and impassioned atmosphere. For Sevcenko, no piece of Baroque artwork can be adequately analyzed divested from its context, since its nature is synthetic, binding, and compelling. This aesthetic had great approval in the [[Iberian Peninsula]], especially in [[Portugal]], whose culture, beyond being essentially catholic and monarchic, was filled with [[millenarianism]] and [[mysticism]] inherited from the [[Arabs]] and [[Jews]], favoring a religiousness characterized by emotional intensity. And from Portugal the movement passed to their colony in [[Americas|America]], where the cultural context of the [[indigenous peoples]], marked by ritualism and festivity, supplied a receptive backdrop.&lt;ref&gt;Costa, Maria Cristina Castilho. A imagem da mulher: um estudo de arte brasileira. Senac, 2002. pp. 55-56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sevcenko, Nicolau. Pindorama revisitada: cultura e sociedade em tempos de virada. Série Brasil cidadão. Editora Peirópolis, 2000. pp. 39-47&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Brazilian Baroque]] was formed through a complex fabric of European and local influences, although generally colored by the Portuguese interpretation of the style. The context in which the Baroque developed in the colony was completely different from its European origins. Here, the environment was one of poverty and scarcity, with everything yet to be done,&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=A imagem da mulher: um estudo de arte brasileira|author=Costa, M.C.C.|date=2002|publisher=SENAC São Paulo Editora|isbn=9788587864222|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7g61g4sk0cgC&amp;pg=PA53|page=53|accessdate=2015-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contrary to Europe, within the immense colony of Brazil, there was no court, the local administration was inefficient and sluggish, opening a vast performance space for the Church and its missionary battalions, who administered in addition to divine services, a series of civil services such as issuance of birth and death certificates. They were on the vanguard of conquest of the interior of the territory, serving as evangelists and pacifiers to indigenous populations, founding

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10424">The '''British War Memorials Committee''' was a British Government body that throughout 1918 was responsible for the commissioning of artworks to create a memorial to the [[First World War]].&lt;ref name="BEEBtolson"&gt;{{cite web |author=Roger Tolson|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/galleries/collections/imperial-war-museum-690/foreword|title=More about IWM |date=|accessdate=7 October 2014|work=BBC/Your Paintings}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee was formed in February 1918 when the Department of Information, which had been responsible for war-time propaganda and also operated a war artists scheme, became the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]] with [[Max Aitken, Lord Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]] as its Minister. Beaverbrook had been running, from London, the Canadian Government's scheme to commission contemporary art during the First World War and believed Britain would benefit from a similar project. Beaverbrook wanted the British War Memorials Committee to change the direction of Government-sponsored art away from propaganda of short-term value only during the conflict to a collection with a much longer lasting national value. [[Arnold Bennett]], alongside Beaverbrook, was the driving force behind the BWMC and was instrumental in ensuring young artists, including those seen as [[Modernism|modernist]] or [[avant-garde]], were commissioned by the Committee over older British artists, many of whom were associated with the [[Royal Academy]].&lt;ref name="Gough"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Gough|publisher=Sansom and Company|year=2010|title=A Terrible Beauty: British Artists in the First World War |ISBN=978-1-906593-00-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
The original members of the Committee were,
:::* [[Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe|Lord Rothermere]], Chair of the BWMC,
:::* Alfred Yockney, former editor of [[The Art Journal]] and Secretary of the BWMC,
:::* [[Max Aitken, Lord Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]],
:::* [[Arnold Bennett]],
:::* Paul G Konody, art critic,
:::* [[Charles Masterman]], 
:::* [[Muirhead Bone]], artist member,
:::* [[Robbie Ross]], art advisor,
:::* [[Campbell Dodgson]], art advisor,
:::* [[Thomas Derrick (artist)|Thomas Derrick]], art advisor,

Also [[William Orpen]] and [[Henry Tonks]] also acted as advisors to the Committee.&lt;ref name="Harries"/&gt;

==Operations==
[[Robbie Ross|Robert Ross]] suggested that by ensuring the artists worked to a set of standard size canvases they would produce pictures with a unified identity that would be appropriate for a national memorial. Ross suggested two sizes, 120 by 144 inches based on [[The Surrender of Breda]] by [[Velasquez]] and 72 by 125 inches, the size of [[The Battle of San Romano]] by [[Paolo Uccello]]. Smaller pictures would also be commissioned and an alternative large size, of 72 by 86 inches would be acceptable. In addition, four 'super-pictures' of 20 feet long by 7 feet high were to be commissioned on the theme of cooperation between Britain and its allies.&lt;ref name="Harries"/&gt; The paintings were to be housed in a national [[Hall of Remembrance]] which would be built in London.&lt;ref name="USmalley"&gt;{{cite web |author=Ulrike Smalley|url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/history/how-the-british-government-sponsored-the-arts-in-the-first-world-war |title=How The British Government Sponsored The Arts In The First World War |date=|accessdate=5 April 2017|work=Imperial War Museums}}&lt;/ref&gt; The architect [[Charles Holden]] was recalled from France, where he was working for the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission|Imperial War Graves Commission]], to design the building. Muirhead Bone described the structure, which was never built, as a "kind of Pavilion", surrounded by a garden, with a main gallery leading to an oratory with a dedication to the "coming Brotherhood of Man for which we all pray."&lt;ref name="BTruth"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Cork|publisher=Yale University Press &amp; The Barbican Art Gallery|year=1994|title=A Bitter Truth - Avant Garde Art and the Great War|ISBN=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BWMC operated three separate schemes, with different terms and conditions, for artists depending on the scale and quantity of work they were expected to produce.

*Scheme One, or the Memorial scheme, was for the production of a single large piece for the central gallery of the Hall of Remembrance for which the artist would be paid £600 for a 20 foot by 7 foot 'super-picture' or £300 for a 72 by 125 or 72 by 86 inch canvas. Smaller works would be bought for £150. Artists on Scheme One contracts included [[John Singer Sargent]], [[Augustus John]], [[Charles Holmes]], [[Walter Bayes]], [[Philip Wilson Steer]], [[George Clausen]] and [[Henry Tonks]].&lt;ref name="Harries"/&gt; 
*Scheme Two was designed for younger artists who would be paid £300 per annum, plus any military pay they were receiving, in return for which they would turn over their entire output for six months. During this time they would be allowed no outside work at all, including teaching, but were expected to include one piece in the 'memorial' sizes. Artists on Scheme Two included [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]], [[John Nash (artist)|John Nash]], [[Colin Gill]], [[Bernard Meninsky]], [[William Roberts (painter)|William Roberts]] and [[Henry Rushbury]]. The artists who had previously been working for the Department of Information war artist scheme, such as [[James McBey]], [[Muirhead Bone]] and [[William Orpen]], were also accommodated under this arrangement. The most prolific of the Scheme Two artists was [[John Laviers Wheatley]] who produced some 40 images of Naval subjects. [[Christopher Nevinson]], was offered a Scheme Two contract but refused and eventually agreed to terms closer to that of Scheme One.&lt;ref name="Harries"/&gt;
*Scheme Three gave the BWMC the first option to purchase work in return for facilities and access and was used by [[JD Fergusson]], [[Frank Dobson (sculptor)|Frank Dobson]] and [[William Rothenstein]].

In March 1918 the BWMC submitted a request to the [[War Office]] seeking the release from front-line service of 16 artists. The War Office refused permission for [[Eric Gill]] and [[Jacob Epstein]] to be released, and by the time the Army had processed the requests for [[Stanley Spencer]] and [[Darsie Japp]] the war was almost over. Although Muirhead Bone suggested nineteen well-known, modern women artists, including [[Dora Carrington]] and [[Orovida Pissarro]] for commissions, the BWMC ignored his advice and only recruited three women artists, [[Anna Airy]], [[Dorothy Coke]] and [[Flora Lion]] but did not acquire any paintings from them.&lt;ref name="Beyond"&gt;{{cite book|author=Catherine Speck|publisher=Reaktion Books|year=2014|title=Beyond the Battlefield, Women Artists of Two World Wars|ISBN=978 178023 374 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of pacifists and [[conscientious objector]]s were approached. Both [[Duncan Grant]] and [[Mark Gertler (artist)|Mark Gertler]] agreed to work for the Committee but the latter was refused permission by the body supervising conscientious objectors. [[Harold Knight]] refused to do any work that could be used as propaganda.&lt;ref name="Harries"/&gt;

==Demise==
The BWMC was not without its opponents; many in the Treasury believed that the Government should not be acting as a patron of the arts and the newly formed [[Imperial War Museum]] considered much of what the Committee was doing as part of their remitt. As a peer and a newspaper owner, Beaverbrook himself attracted controversy. Beaverbrook's rival newspapers attacked the workings of the Committee and [[Robbie Ross]] in particular.&lt;ref name="Gough"/&gt; Towards the end of the war the British government gave permission for the proceeds from any BWMC exhibitions to be donated to war charities. Beaverbrook had already, without informing the Government, registered the title "British War Memorials Fund" as just such a private charity. The Acting Secretary of the Ministry of Information, R W Needham, objected that Beaverbrook had no right to generate income for a private charity by exhibiting Government funded artworks and that the artists involved had all worked for reduced fees in the national interest. If Beaverbrook wanted the BWMC to continue beyond the war as a private charity then it would have to become independent of the Ministry and then appeal directly to the public for funds.&lt;ref name="Harries"&gt;{{cite book|author=Merion Harries &amp; Susie Harries|publisher=Michael Joseph, The Imperial War Museum &amp; the Tate Gallery|year=1983|title=The War Artists, British Official War Art of the Twentieth Century |ISBN=0 7181 2314 X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beaverbrook abandoned the scheme and the war art collection was brought under the direct control of a new "Pictorial Propaganda Committee" within the Ministry. The Pictorial Propaganda Committee first met on the 24 July 1918 and quickly decided to abandon both the sculpture commissions and the Hall of Remembrance but to maintain the existing painting commissions and to designate the Imperial War Museum, IWM,  as the future, permanent, home of the collection. In January 1919, the Secretary of the BWMC, Alfred Yockney joined the IWM to oversee the transition.&lt;ref name="Harries"/&gt;

==Legacy==
The BWMC left an artistic legacy that included some of the best art to be produced during World War I. This included the seventeen large paintings intended for the Hall of Remembrance, which included [[Gassed (painting)|''Gassed'']] by [[John Singer Sargent]] and ''[[The Menin Road (painting)|The Menin Road]]'' by [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]], plus two large sculpture reliefs by [[Charles Sargeant Jagger]] and [[Gilbert Ledward]] and smaller canvases produced by a total of thirty-one artists.&lt;ref name="Gough"/&gt; The structure and methods used by the BWMC provided the model on which [[Kenneth Clark]] based the, much larger, [[War Artists' Advisory Committee]] during the Second World War.&lt;ref name="Gough"/&gt;

==History==

===Early development===
[[File:Chelsea mansion house crop.jpg|thumb|left|"Chelsea", drawn by a daughter of [[Clement Clarke Moore]]]]

Chelsea takes its name from the estate and [[Georgian architecture|Georgian-style]] house of retired British Major Thomas Clarke, who obtained the property when he bought the farm of Jacob Somerindyck on August 16, 1750. The land was bounded by what would become 21st and 24th Streets, from the Hudson River to Eighth Avenue.&lt;ref name=encnyc /&gt; Clarke chose the name "Chelsea" after the [[Royal Hospital Chelsea]], a retirement home for soldiers in [[London, England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Janvier|first1=Thomas Allibone|author-link1=Thomas Allibone Janvier|title=In Old New York|date=1894|publisher=[[Harper &amp; Brothers]]|pages=167–9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QzEdAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA167}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/clement-clarke-moore-park/history Clement Clarke Moore Park], [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]]. Accessed September 20, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Clarke passed the estate on to his daughter, Charity, who, with her husband [[Benjamin Moore (bishop)|Benjamin Moore]], added land on the south of the estate, extending it to 19th Street.&lt;ref name=encnyc /&gt; The house was the birthplace of their son, [[Clement Clarke Moore]], who in turn inherited the property.  Moore is generally credited with writing "[[A Visit From St. Nicholas]]" and was the author of the first Greek and Hebrew lexicons printed in the United States.

In 1827, Moore gave the land of his apple orchard to the [[Episcopal Diocese of New York]] for the [[General Theological Seminary]], which built its brownstone Gothic, tree-shaded campus south of the manor house.  Despite his objections to the [[Commissioner's Plan of 1811]], which ran the new [[Ninth Avenue (Manhattan)|Ninth Avenue]] through the middle of his estate, Moore began the development of Chelsea with the help of [[James N. Wells]], dividing it up into lots along Ninth Avenue and selling them to well-heeled New Yorkers.&lt;ref&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace, p.447&lt;/ref&gt; [[Covenant (law)|Covenants]] in the deeds of sale specified what could be built on the land&amp;nbsp;– stables, manufacturing and commercial uses were forbidden&amp;nbsp;– as well as architectural details of the buildings.&lt;ref name=encnyc /&gt;

===Industrialization===
The new neighborhood thrived for three decades, with many single family homes and rowhouses, in the process expanding past the original boundaries of Clarke's estate, but an industrial zone also began to develop along the Hudson.&lt;ref name=encnyc /&gt;  In 1847 the [[West Side Line|Hudson River Railroad]] laid its freight tracks up a [[right-of-way (railroad)|right-of-way]] between Tenth and [[Eleventh Avenue (Manhattan)|Eleventh Avenue]]s, separating Chelsea from the [[Hudson River]] waterfront.  By the time of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the area west of Ninth Avenue and below 20th Street was the location of numerous distilleries making [[turpentine]] and [[camphene]], a lamp fuel.  In addition, the huge Manhattan Gas Works complex, which converted [[bituminous coal]] into [[town gas|gas]], was located at Ninth and 18th Street.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Clint. "A Vast and Fiendish Plot" ''New York Archive'' (Winter 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

The industrialization of western Chelsea brought immigrant populations from many countries to work in the factories,&lt;ref name=fednyc /&gt; including a large number of [[Irish-Americans|Irish]] immigrants, who dominated work on the Hudson River piers that lined the nearby waterfront and the truck terminals integrated with the freight railroad spur.{{efn|The film ''[[On the Waterfront]]'' (1954) recreates this tough world, dramatized in [[Richard Rodgers]]' 1936 jazz ballet ''[[Slaughter on Tenth Avenue]]''.}}  As well as the piers, warehouses and factories, the industrial area west of Tenth Avenue also included lumberyards and breweries, and tenements built to house the workers. With the immigrant population came the political domination of the neighborhood by the [[Tammany Hall]] [[political machine|machine]],&lt;ref name=fednyc /&gt; as well as festering ethnic tensions: around 67 people died in a [[Orange Riots|riot between Irish Catholics and Irish Protestants on July 12, 1871]], which took place around 24th Street and Eighth Avenue.&lt;ref name=encnyc /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace, pp.1003-1008&lt;/ref&gt; The social problems of the area's workers provoked [[John Lovejoy Elliot]] to form the [[Hudson Guild]] in 1897, one of the first [[settlement house]]s&amp;nbsp;– private organizations designed to provide social services.

===Recent history===
[[File:London_Terrace_from_High_Line,_New_York_City_(2014)_-_10.jpg|thumb|[[London Terrace]] and the intersection of 10th Avenue and West 23rd Street.]]
A theater district had formed in the area by 1869,&lt;ref name=encnyc /&gt; and soon West [[23rd Street (Manhattan)|23rd Street]] was the center of American theater, led by [[Pike's Opera House]] (1868, demolished 1960), on the northwest corner of Eighth Avenue. Chelsea was an early center for the motion picture industry before World War I.  Some of [[Mary Pickford]]'s first pictures were made on the top floors of an armory building at 221 [[26th Street (Manhattan)|West 26th Street]], while other studios were located on 23rd and 21st Streets.&lt;ref name=fednyc&gt;{{cite fednyc}}, pp. 151-155&lt;/ref&gt;

[[London Terrace]] was one of the world's largest apartment blocks when it opened in 1930, with a swimming pool, [[wikt:solarium|solarium]], gymnasium, and doormen dressed as London bobbies. Other major housing complexes in the Chelsea area are [[Penn South]], a 1962 [[cooperative apartment|cooperative housing development]] sponsored by the [[International Ladies Garment Workers' Union]], and the [[New York City Housing Authority]]-built and -operated [[Fulton Houses]] and [[Chelsea-Elliot Houses]].

The massive 23-story [[Art Deco]] Walker Building, which spans the block between 17th and 18th Streets just off of [[Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)|Seventh Avenue]], was built in the early 1930s.  It typifies the real estate activity of the district, as it has been converted in 2012 to residential apartments on the top 16 floors, with Verizon retaining the lower seven floors.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, C.

Verizon owns Floors 2 through 7, which contain offices for about a dozen employees who will come to work through a West 17th Street entryway. Mr. Stern owns the condo that encompasses Floors 8 through 23."&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1940s, tons of [[uranium]] for the [[Manhattan Project]] were stored in the Baker &amp; Williams Warehouse at 513-519 West 20th Street.  The uranium was removed and a decontamination project at the site was completed early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Broad, William J.

The stores of Chelsea reflect the ethnic and social diversity of the area's population. Ethnic restaurants, [[Delicatessen|deli]]s, and clothing boutiques are plentiful.

Above 23rd Street, by the [[Hudson River]], the neighborhood is post-industrial, featuring the elevated [[High Line]] viaduct, which follows the river all through Chelsea. The elevated rail line was the successor to the street-level freight line original built through Chelsea in 1847, which was the cause of numerous fatal accidents, so it was elevated in the early 1930s by the [[New York Central Railroad]]. It fell out of use in the 1960s through 1980 and was originally slated to be torn down, but in the early 2000s, it was redesigned and converted into a highly used aerial [[greenway (landscape)|greenway]] and [[rail trail|rails-to-trails]] park.

The neighborhood was quickly gentrifying, with small businesses being replaced by big-box retailers and technology and fashion stores.&lt;ref name=NYT2015/&gt; With this development, more wealthy residents moved in, further widening an already-existing income gap with public-housing residents. In 2015, the average yearly household income in most of Chelsea was about $140,000. On the other hand, in the area's two public-housing developments&amp;nbsp;– the Chelsea-Elliot Houses, between 25th Street, Ninth Avenue, 28th Street, and Tenth Avenue; and Fulton Houses, between 16th Street, Ninth Avenue, 19th Street, and Tenth Avenue&amp;nbsp;– the average income was less than $30,000.&lt;ref name=NYT2015/&gt; At the same time, the area's [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] enclaves and rent-subsidized housing, especially in [[Penn South]], was being replaced by high-rent studios. This resulted in large income disparities across the neighborhood; one block in particular&amp;nbsp;– 25th Street between 9th and 10th Avenues&amp;nbsp;– had the Elliot Houses on its north side and two million-dollar residences on its south side.&lt;ref name=NYT2015/&gt;

===Residential===
[[Hotel Chelsea]], built 1883–1885 and designed by Hubert, Pirsson &amp; Co., was New York's first cooperative apartment complex&lt;ref name=nycland /&gt; and was the tallest building in the city until 1902.  After the theater district migrated uptown and the neighborhood became commercialized, the residential building folded and in 1905 it was turned into a hotel.&lt;ref&gt;Leffel, C. and Lehman, J. ''The Best Things to Do in New York''.  New York: Universal Publishing 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  The hotel attracted attention as the place where [[Dylan Thomas]] had been staying when he died in 1953 at [[Saint Vincent's Catholic Medical Center|St. Vincent's Hospital]] in [[Greenwich Village]], and for the 1978 slaying of [[Nancy Spungen]] for which [[Sid Vicious]] was accused. The Hotel has been the home of numerous celebrities, including [[Brendan Behan]], [[Thomas Wolfe]], [[Mark Twain]], [[Tennessee Williams]] and [[Virgil Thomson]],&lt;ref name=nycland /&gt;  and the subject of books, films (''[[Chelsea Girls]]'', 1966) and music.

The [[London Terrace]] apartment complex on West 23rd was one of the world's largest apartment blocks when it opened in 1930, with a swimming pool, [[wikt:Solarium|solarium]], gymnasium, and doormen dressed as London bobbies. It was designed by Farrar and Watmough.  It takes its name from the fashionable mid-19th century cottages which were once located there.&lt;ref name=fednyc /&gt;

"Founded by a labor union in 1962, Penn South has 2,820 units scattered over six blocks, still charges rock-bottom prices and once was so left-leaning that resident Communists pilloried resident Socialists.... The complex, which was sponsored by the International Ladies' Garment Workers Union and is formally known as the Mutual Redevelopment Houses, is one of the last of a breed of New York co-ops built for the working class.... Some 6,000 people are on the now-closed waiting list, and if history is any indication, many will die before getting in."&lt;/ref&gt; Under the terms of agreements reached with the City of New York in 1986 and 2002, and separately with the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]], Penn South's eligibility for tax abatements offered by the [[Mitchell-Lama Housing Program]] has been extended to 2052.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pennsouth.coop/penn-south-history.html History], [[Penn South]]. Accessed September 1, 2017. "In April 2011 Penn South cooperators again voted in an advisory referendum to extend the contract with the City for an additional 8 years of tax abatement to 2030. In exchange, the City agreed to a package of over $25 million in financial aid to Penn South to help fund the replacement of the heating, ventilating, and air cooling system (HVAC). Most recently, to secure a $189 million refinance with HUD, Penn South shareholders voted to extend our contract for 22 additional years, through 2052."&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Culture of Kosovo}}
Cinematography in [[Kosovo]]{{efn|name=status}} in the [[Albanian language]] began its activities after the foundation of ''[[Kosovafilm]]'', which produced short movies, documentaries, cartoons and later feature movies. Since 2008, the central authority for cinematography in Kosovo is [http://www.qkk-rks.com/?id=1 Kosova’s Cinematography Center (KCC)] though there are numerous independent film companies active in Kosovo. Before Kosovafilm, there were no fully Kosovan movies for Kosovo. 

==History==

===Early beginning===
By 1937 on the territory of modern-day Kosovo (then within the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]), there were seven operating cinemas. There was one per town, located in [[Pristina]], [[Prizren]], [[Kosovska Mitrovica]], [[Gnjilane]], [[Uroševac]], [[Đakovica]], and [[Peć]]. Cinematography in the former Yugoslavia after World War II was developed in accordance with the criteria of the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]]. Every republic in [[SFR Yugoslavia]] had centres of cinematography, so Kosovo not being a republic had access to these centres only through Belgrade to participate in documentary film production, artistic play and education framework for cinematography. With the formation of the cultural centre began Albanian-language cinematography in Kosovo. The first artistic film was realised in 1955, ''Esalon doktora M.'' but the first movie in Albanian was ''Uka i Bjeshkeve te Nemura''.

===Kosovafilm industry===

[[File:Picture made by Shukri Kacaniku.jpg|thumb|Filming "When Spring Comes Late"-1979, Kosovo]]

'''The Kosovo film industry''' dates from the 1970s. On 20 February 1969, the parliament of Kosovo established ''Kosovafilm'', a state institution for the production, distribution and showing of films. Its initial director was the actor Abdurrahman Shala, followed by writer and noted poet Azem Shkreli, under whose direction the most successful films were produced. Subsequent directors of Kosovafilm were Xhevar Qorraj, Ekrem Kryeziu and Gani Mehmetaj. After producing seventeen feature films, numerous short films and documentaries, the institution was taken over by the Serbian authorities in 1990 and dissolved. Kosovafilm was reestablished after [[FR Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] withdrawal from the region in June 1999 and has since been endeavoring to revive the film industry in Kosovo.

Kosovafilm produced eight feature films in BCS, mostly partisan war films, many of which were in collaboration with Filmske Novosti and Avala Film of Belgrade. Its first Albanian-language production was the film ''Kur pranvera vonohet'' (When Spring Comes Late), premiered on 12 July 1979 and was directed by Ekrem Kryeziu and was based on Fadil Hoxha's partisan diary. Perhaps the best known, and last of the nine Albanian-language feature films of the period, was ''Rojet e mjegulles'' (''The Keepers of the Fog''), premiered on 15 June 1988. It was also directed by lsa Qosja and starred Xhevat Qorraj, [[Enver Petrovci]], Florie Siarina and Cun Lajçi.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Fnbw1wsacSAC&amp;pg=PA60&amp;lpg=PA60&amp;dq=kosovafilm&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vzJ-ksIhX2&amp;sig=WBJW_XQL3O9YPGBeJ1GCCJATEMg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Y5EjUc3fNNDptQb9wIGYCw&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=kosovafilm&amp;f=false Robert Elsie, Historical Dictionary of Kosovo] p60&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Photo made by Shukri Kacaniku.jpg|thumb|The famous Kosovan actor Bekim Fehmiu. Kosovo, 1978.]]

[[Bekim Fehmiu]] was born on 1 June 1936 in [[Sarajevo]]. He was an ethnic Albanian and his family moved to the Kosovo region, where, as a 20-year-old amateur boxer and manual worker. His big break was the 1967 film [[I Even Met Happy Gypsies]], a subtle portrayal of Roma life which won two awards in Cannes and was nominated for an Oscar. In 1974 Fehmiu appeared in the title role The Adventures of Ulysses, with [[Irene Papas]] as Penelope, and in [[John Frankenheimer| John Frankenheimer's]] [[Black Sunday (1977 film)|Black Sunday]] (1977) he played a Palestinian terrorist alongside [[Robert Shaw (British actor)|Robert Shaw]] and [[Marthe Keller]].

The New York Times dubbed him the "Yugoslav heart-throb" for his youthful conquests and acquaintances with the likes of [[Brigitte Bardot]] and [[Ava Gardner]]. Decades after his last appearance on the screen, readers of a leading Italian women's magazine voted him one of the ten most attractive men of the 20th century. He committed suicide in his Belgrade apartment on 15 June 2010. According to his last wish, [[Bekim Fehmiu]]'s ashes were scattered across the river [[Prizren Bistrica|Bistrica]] near his hometown of [[Prizren]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/film-obituaries/7877965/Bekim-Fehmiu.html The Telegraph, UK], Bekim Fehmiu&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Faruk Begolli]] was the most famous Kosovo Albanian actor and director in Yugoslavia (along with Bekim Fehmiu). He attended high school in Pristina and completed the academy of film in Belgrade (1966). Begolli played in more than 60 films, starting with [[Veljko Bulajić]]'s [[Looking Into the Eyes of the Sun|Pogled u zenicu Sunca]] (1966). He cooperated with director [[Puriša Đorđević]] in his films ''Podne'' (Noon), ''Jutro'' (The Morning), and ''San'' (The Dream). In the late 1980s, Begolli returned from Belgrade to Kosovo, where he worked at the University of Pristina as a professor at the Faculty of Drama. His last lead role was in Ekrem Kryeziu's ''Dashuria e Bjeshkeve te Nemuna'' (Love in the Damned Mountain), and his last piece was Etjet e Kosoves (Kosovo: Desperate Search), where he was also a co-scenarist. He died in 2007, after a long battle with cancer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0066800/bio IMDb], Faruk Begolli-biography&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arta Dobroshi]] is famous with her role in the screen drama Lorna’s Silence (winner of Best Screenplay at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival). This young actress achieved her international breakthrough and a nomination for the 2008 [[European Film Awards]].

'''''Come Back, Africa''''' (1959) is the second feature-length film written, produced, and directed by American independent filmmaker [[Lionel Rogosin]].

The film had a profound effect on [[African Cinema]], and remains of great historical and cultural importance as a document preserving the heritage of the townships in South Africa in the 1950s. It may be classified as [[reportage]], documentary, [[historical movie]] or [[political cinema]], since it portrays real events and people. On the other hand, it reveals an interpretation of meaningful social facts and a strong ethical assumption towards human behaviours like racism.

Like Rogosin's feature debut ''[[On the Bowery]]'', ''Come Back, Africa'' is a scripted film based on fictional narrative, in which actors play invented roles. However, unlike mainstream films and against Hollywood traditions, its actors are street people, improvising lived experiences: they play their own lives or those of people like them. That is why ''Come Back, Africa'' is a fiction / non-fiction, a [[hybrid genre|hybrid]] of [[fictional film]] and documentary: a [[docufiction]]. Additionally, it is a rare combination in film history of docufiction and [[political film]].

Both Lionel Rogosin in America and [[Jean Rouch]] in France, at the same time, considered themselves as [[Robert Flaherty]]'s heirs for similar reasons. Both used amateur actors, "street people" playing their own roles in search of [[truth]] or to unveil some hidden mystery beyond crude reality: Rogosin, contrary to Flaherty, sustained by strong [[ideological]] beliefs, Rouch, beyond Flaherty, inspired by [[surrealism]], which he believed to be a useful means to reveal the '’truth of cinema'’ (the [[cinéma-vérité]]) and also an important tool to be used by an [[ethnographer]] for scientific research. Following different paths to reach similar results, both converged in [[ethnofiction]] with surprising results (See: Glossary).

==Synopsis==
''Come Back, Africa'' comprises a storyline acted out by black South Africans, from whose own experiences the film's events are drawn.

Desperate to feed his household, Zachariah, a young [[Zulu people|Zulu]], departs his famine-stricken [[kraal]] to work in the [[Johannesburg]] gold mines. He eventually settles in one of the squalid [[apartheid]]-era [[Township (South Africa)|township]]s, only to find himself confronted with a barrage of South Africa's infamous [[pass laws]] restricting his every move. Zachariah learns that he cannot seek employment without a pass; paradoxially, he cannot obtain a pass without employment. Meanwhile, his family is consistently threatened with exile or imprisonment if they fail to comply with these draconian regulations.

Zachariah subsequently drifts through a succession of odd jobs as vadalect, garage attendant, waiter, and public labourer – ridiculed, insulted, and ostracised by unfeeling [[Afrikaner]] superintendents. As they struggle to support their home, even Zachariah's spouse Vinah is forced to take up domestic service; she lives on the property of a white landowner, away from her husband. When the latter visits her one lonely evening, he is arrested by the [[South African Police|SAP]] on [[trespassing]] charges.

Upon his release from detention, Zachariah discovers that Vinah has been murdered by Marumu, an infamous [[Sophiatown]] hoodlum, after resisting several unwanted sexual advances. His overwhelming sense of torment, helplessness, and frustration is intended to capture the resentment of South Africa's indigenous population. Denied basic [[civil rights]], many must weave a treacherous path of survival through the myriad of legal and unofficial racial codes, while their families disintegrate on the townships' violent streets. Some – like Zachariah –  are utterly defenceless in this struggle, impossibly torn between apartheid's calculated suppression and the wanton atrocities of [[organised crime]].

==Reception==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}
{{POV | section|date=May 2013}}
* "...a timely and remarkable piece of cinema journalism: a matter-of-fact, horrifying study of life in the black depths of South African society. Filmed in secret..in constant danger of arrest and deportation, Come Back Africa..looks deep into the private nightmare and social desperation of a man and his people.” (''Time'' magazine)
* “Burning with integrity; it is the most damning indictment of apartheid and the pass system that I have ever seen..In a climax of almost unbearable anger and frustration it beats out a question which, though unspoken, must be in the mind of everyone who sees it: How long are we going to allow these appalling conditions to exist?” – Nina Hibbin – Daily Worker (London)
* “If you want to see and understand South Africa, there is no better way than this picture of Johannesburg: the bitterness of the whites, the growing anger of the Negroes and the horror of the shacks and tin shelters of Sophiatown..Extraordinary timeliness.” – Archer Winsten, New York Post
* “Highest Recommendation! Extraordinary film, powerfully dramatic, brilliantly photographed, splendidly played against the background of explosive South Africa.” – Jesse Zunser, Cue Magazine
* “The very spontaneity of the scenes gives his story illumination, shock, and intense poignancy.” – Hollis Alpert, Saturday Review
* “...I have just seen a film that makes me ashamed of being white – ashamed of belonging to a race which can oppress and terrorize people of other colors. It shows how colored men are so hedged about by restrictions and brutal laws that their lives are little better than the lives of animals in a cage. " – Anthony Carthew,  Daily Herald
* “...a film which is not so much a work of art but is of vast importance as a contribution to awareness of the gigantic problem of racial conflict existing in South Africa today..It is a fine film, entertaining in many ways, and quite authentic in its presentation..the musical background..is superb...and interspersed among the story scenes are excellent shots of Johannesburg streets, filled with constantly moving tides of Africans, restless, surging forward, overwhelming in their numbers.” – Christian Science Monitor	
* "Come Back Africa" has been restored by the '''Cineteca di Bologna''' and the laboratory''' L’Imagine Ritrovata''' with the collaboration of '''Rogosin Heritage''' in 2005.

==Awards==
The film was premiered at the 1960 Venice Film Festival. Rogosin financed and backed Bloke Modisane’s escape from South Africa and his transition period in London, where he wrote his book ''Blame me on History''. Rogosin at the same time bribed officials in South Africa and managed to get [[Miriam Makeba]] out of the country against the payment of a bond so that she could present the film with him at the Venice Film Festival. The film along with Makeba's singing and "afro" hair-style created a sensation and the film won the prestigious "Italian Critics Award". It was almost impossible to get black artists out of South Africa at the time, and impossible for these artists to make a career outside of the country. Rogosin engaged Makeba under contract, and financed her travels and living expenses in England and the United States. He also hired a publicity agent, and arranged her appearance at the Village Vanguard in New York City and her debut on ''[[The Steve Allen Show]]''.
	
* [[Italian Critics Award]], [[Venice Film Festival]], 1959
* Winner of the award for "the film showing the most significant advance in content means of expression and technique." – The Canadian Federation of Film Societies, Vancouver Film Festival, 1959
* Selected by ''Time'' magazine as one of the "Ten Best Pictures of 1960”
* Selected by Chevalier de la Barre, Paris, as "Most Worthy Picture of 1960”

==Filming==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}
After the [[World War II|Second World War]], Rogosin wanted to make a film that would expose the [[apartheid]] system to the world. He made his first film ''[[On the Bowery]]'' (1956) as a way to prepare for making ''Come Back, Africa''.

Rogosin and his wife Elinor arrived in South Africa in May 1957, and spent six months preparing and getting to know the people and country. He secretly met Myrtle and Marty Berman (organizers in the anti-apartheid movement) who introduced him to the groups fighting against apartheid and to [[Bloke Modisane]], a writer and journalist working for ''[[Drum (South African magazine)|Drum]]'' magazine. Modisane then introduced Rogosin to [[Lewis Nkosi]], another young ''Drum'' journalist, and other journalists, musicians and writers.

Rogosin, Modisane and Nkosis worked out a simple script with which Rogosin improvised and worked with non-professional actors. The filming was done under the danger of being discovered by the apartheid regime. Rogosin carefully made up different stories for different people so that he was able to film and get the materials out of the country safely. The tiny film crew shot on location in the streets of Johannesburg, Sophiatown and in restricted areas prohibited to whites, where 50,000 African homes were being annihilated to make room for a white suburb called Triumph. Filming finished in October 1959, and Rogosin left South Africa. The editing was done in New York by Carl Lerner, who was receiving the rushes from South Africa.

===Context===
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2013}}
Rogosin's crew worked in secret, disguised as a commercial film unit making a musical, and in constant fear of confiscation and deportation. It was one of the first non-musical films, if not the first to document the lives of black people in Africa using native languages.
	
The South African government attacked ''Come Back, Africa'' and banned it from being shown in South Africa.

Beside the Critics' award at the Venice Film Festival, the film won many awards and was a critical success in Europe. It had its biggest impact in France where Madame Yvonne Decaris who ran the legendary [[:fr:La Pagode|Pagode cinema]], in Paris, opened the film. It was reviewed by many great French intellectuals such as [[Roland Barthes]]. It then went on to be taken up and screened through the French [[Cinéclubs]] system; it is estimated that over a million people saw the film in France.

Rogosin opened the [[Bleecker Street Cinema]] in New York in the spring of 1960&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lionelrogosin.org/bleeker_street_LR.html|title=The Official Lionel Rogosin Website :: Biography|website=www.lionelrogosin.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and premiered ''Come Back, Africa'' one week before the [[Sharpeville massacre]].

[[Fanakalo]] is used for the mine scenes (it is the mining lingua franca), [[Afrikaans]] is used by the policeman who arrests Zacharia for a pass offence, [[Zulu language|Zulu]] is Zacharia's home language and English is used by the intellectuals in the [[shebeen]] scene.

===Music===
Rogosin wanted to expose the ordeal of the people but also wanted to capture the culture of the streets. He was passionate about the music and dancing he observed in the townships, so he also had a "story" for the authorities that he was making a street musical / travelogue, which he used to obtain permission to film outdoors. There are scenes with gumboot dancers, [[Kwela|penny-whistle musicians]], a group singing [[Elvis Presley]]'s hit Teddy Bear, and a young Miriam Makeba singing in the shebeen scene.

===Related content===
Lionel Rogosin's diaries of this period are collected in the book ''A Man Possessed'', edited by Peter Davis.

==="Making of" documentary===
In 2007, Rogosin's sons Michael and Daniel co-produced a 55-minute "Making of" documentary entitled ''An American in Sophiatown''. The film was directed by Lloyd Ross.

==Home media==
[[Milestone Films]] released a restored ''Come Back, Africa'' on DVD and Blu-ray in 2012.

The image was published in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cosgrove|first=Ben|title=Behind the Picture: The Photo That Changed the Face of AIDS|url=http://life.time.com/history/behind-the-picture-the-photo-that-changed-the-face-of-aids/#1|work=Life|accessdate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which called it the "picture that changed the face of AIDS".

The image shows Kirby, near death, a vacant look in his face, and his father holding his son's head in a moment of grief.  Other members of Kirby's immediate family are seated next to him. ''Life'' featured the image in its November 1990 issue, after which it gained first national and then international attention. The picture was later used by [[Benetton Group|United Colors of Benetton]] in an advertising campaign, with the permission of Kirby's family, who felt that its use would show the devastating effects of AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://theinspirationroom.com/daily/2007/benetton-pieta-in-aids-campaign/|title=Benetton Pieta in AIDS campaign - The Inspiration Room|date=2007-04-07|work=The Inspiration Room|access-date=2017-04-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Therese Frare's relationship to David Kirby==
While a patient at Pater Noster, Kirby established a relationship with Therese Frare, a college student from Ohio University. Frare was at Pater Noster for college project credit shadowing a caregiver, named Peta, who was providing care to Kirby. Peta was also HIV positive and formed a strong bond of trust with Kirby and Kirby's family. Because of the relationship between Peta and Frare, Kirby became familiar with Frare. He said that Frare could photograph him in his declining condition, as long as the pictures would not be used for profit.

Frare was with Peta when co-workers contacted Peta with the news that Kirby's condition was growing worse and that his impending death was expected. Kirby's family invited Frare into the room to record the final moments of his life and their grief at his death. The family said that they hoped some good would come of the images Frare took of the final moments of their son's life.

When published by ''Life'', the image shocked the national conscience in the United States with its graphic imagery. While the public knew that AIDS killed, many only knew of its effects in the abstract. AIDS was still thought to be a "gay" disease and much of populace was relatively uninformed about the disease. The image also helped the greater public to connect to the family's grief at losing their son. ''Life'' received complaints about the graphic nature of the image, but felt that it was in line with the magazine's mission of telling a story of life and death through visual imagery.

Frare's image also won the 2nd prize in 1990, for General News from [[World Press Photo]].&lt;ref name=WorldPressPhoto&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archive.worldpressphoto.org/search/layout/result/indeling/detailwpp/form/wpp/start/17/q/ishoofdafbeelding/true/trefwoord/year/1990 |title=1990 2nd Prize General News |publisher=World Press Photo |accessdate=December 1, 2012 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1992 Benetton advertising campaign==
Following the ''Life'' publication, the Kirby family allowed the clothing company [[Benetton Group|United Colors of Benetton]] to use the image in a 1992 advertising campaign, feeling that its story would reach a worldwide audience. Fallout from the campaign came from many sources, including the [[Catholic Church]] which felt that the image was an inappropriate allusion to the historical imagery of the [[Pieta|Virgin Mary cradling Jesus Christ]] after the crucifixion.

In 2012, Frare told ''Life'' that David's father Bill Kirby expressed the family's feelings on the use of the picture by United Colors of Benetton when he told her "Listen, Therese. Benetton didn’t use us, or exploit us. We used them. Because of them, your photo was seen all over the world, and that’s exactly what David wanted."

'''Displair''' is a [[Stereo display|3D]] interactive [[Raster graphics|raster]] display technology developed by a Russian company of the same name. The Displair projects images onto sheets of water droplets suspended in air, giving the illusion of a [[hologram]]. Unlike other [[Fog display|cold fog]] projecting technologies, the images projected by the Displair can also respond rapidly to [[multi-touch]] manipulation, as well as allowing taste and aroma to be incorporated.

[[File:Displair 3D fog display device.jpg|thumb|Russian-made Displair screenless 3D multi-touch display being demonstrated at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2013, Las Vegas]]

== History ==
Developer Maxim Kamanin introduced the Displair at Seliger 2010. In July of that year he chose the "Displair" name for both the product and the company as a [[portmanteau]] of the English words “display” and “air”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-magazine.ru/ideas/tech/pub342855 |title=Русский гаджет: Максим Каманин (The Russkiy gadget: Maxim Kamanin)|author=Василий Романцов |date=2012-02-07 |publisher=Бизнес-журнал |accessdate=2012-06-10|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622002450/http://www.business-magazine.ru/ideas/tech/pub342855|archivedate=2012-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company subsequently obtained investment for further development of the prototype, technology licensing, and small-scale commercial production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://lenta.ru/news/2012/05/24/displair/ |title=Russian air screen was invested with $1M |date=2012-05-24 |publisher=Lenta.ru |accessdate=2012-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applications to date have included displays for in-store advertising and kiosks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=CNN|title=In thin air: Could touch display projected on mist replace physical screens?|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/12/24/tech/touch-display-projected-on-mist/|accessdate=27 December 2013|date=2013-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==

The Displair device projects still and moving images onto a "[[screenless]]" display consisting of cold stable air flow containing particles of water produced by a [[cavitation]] method. These particles are small enough not to leave traces of moisture, and their surface tension high enough to maintain stability after contact with physical objects and wind.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kiosks.ru/content/rus/993/9933-article.asp |title=Displair company from Astrakhan demonstrated  interactive screenless display|date=2012-04-17 |publisher=kiosks.ru |accessdate=2012-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Displair uses third party computerised multi-touch technologies to allow control of images with fingers or with other objects. The display can work with up to 1500 touch points simultaneously with a delay time of less than 0.2 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=TechCrunch|title=Move over Kinect — Displair from Russia is a gesture interface in thin air|url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/11/23/move-over-kinect-displair-from-russia-is-a-gesture-interface-in-thin-air-2|accessdate=27 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This makes it possible to allow manipulation by more than one user, and also to identify more complex gestures than similar 3D display systems. The company is working on incorporating flavoring and taste interaction with projected images in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Astrakhan company Displair showed interactive multi-touch screen|url=http://www.cyberstyle.ru/newsline/12474-displair-interface-interfeis.html|accessdate=27 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:'Dying Slave' Michelangelo JBU001.jpg|thumb|''Dying Slave'']]
The '''''Dying Slave''''' is a sculpture by the [[Italian Renaissance]] artist [[Michelangelo]]. Created between 1513 and 1516, it was to serve with another figure, the ''[[Rebellious Slave]]'', at the [[tomb of Pope Julius II]].&lt;ref&gt;Panofsky, Erwin. "The First Two Projects of Michelangelo's Tomb of Julius II". ''The Art Bulletin'', Volume 19, No. 4, December 1937. pp. 561–579.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[marble]] figure 2.15 metres (7' 4") in height, and is held at the [[Musée du Louvre|Louvre]], Paris.

In 1976 the art historian Richard Fly wrote that it "suggests that moment when life capitulates before the relentless force of dead matter".&lt;ref&gt;Fly, Richard. ''Shakespeare's Mediated World''. Amherst, MA: [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 1976. p.30.&lt;/ref&gt;
However, in a recent scholarly volume entitled ''The Slave in European Art'', Charles Robertson discusses the ''Dying Slave'' in the context of real [[slavery]] in [[Italy]] during the time of the [[Italian Renaissance|Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Robertson, "Allegory and Ambiguity in Michelangelo's Slave", in ''The Slave in European Art: From Renaissance Trophy to Abolitionist Emblem'', ed. [[Elizabeth McGrath (art historian)|Elizabeth McGrath]] and Jean Michel Massing, London (The Warburg Institute) 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirteen reproductions of the ''Dying Slave'' adorn the top storey of the [[12th arrondissement of Paris|12th arrondissement]] police station in [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://breves-histoire.fr/vestiges/esclave-mourant-hotel-police/|title= « L’esclave mourant » de l’Hôtel de Police du 12ème|access-date=August 4, 2018| website=Brèves d'histoire|publisher=WordPress|language=French |trans-title=The Dying Slave on the police station of the 12th arrondissement}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Art Deco]] in style, the building was designed in 1991 by architects {{ill|Manuel Núñez Yanowsky|es}} and [[Miriam Teitelbaum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://parisisinvisible.blogspot.com/2012/01/challenge-7-curious-figures-on-avenue.html Challenge 7: Curious figures on the Avenue Daumesnil] Retrieved 4 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paris-walking-tours.com/promenadeplantee.html Promenade Plantee] Retrieved 4 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3017">{{for|the 19th-century art movement known as eclecticism|academic art}}
'''Eclecticism''' is a kind of mixed style in the [[fine arts]]: "the borrowing of a variety of [[Art movement|style]]s from different sources and combining them" {{harv|Hume|1998|loc=5}}. Significantly, Eclecticism hardly ever constituted a specific style in [[art]]: it is characterized by the fact that it was not a particular style. In general, the term describes the combination in a single work of a variety of influences—mainly of elements from different historical styles in [[architecture]], [[painting]], and the [[graphic arts|graphic]] and [[decorative arts]]. In [[music]] the term used may be either [[Eclecticism in music|eclecticism]] or [[polystylism]].

==In the visual arts==
The term '''eclectic''' was first used by [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] to characterize the art of the [[The Carracci|Carracci]], who incorporated in their paintings elements from the [[Renaissance]] and [[Art in ancient Greece#Classical|classic]]al traditions. Indeed, [[Agostino Carracci|Agostino]], [[Annibale Carracci|Annibale]] and [[Lodovico Carracci]] had tried to combine in their art [[Michelangelo]]'s line, [[Titian]]'s [[color]], [[Antonio da Correggio|Correggio]]'s [[chiaroscuro]], and [[Raffaello Santi|Raphael]]'s [[symmetry]] and [[wiktionary:grace|grace]]. 

In the 18th century, [[Sir Joshua Reynolds]], head of the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in [[London]], was one of the most influential advocates of eclecticism. In the sixth of his famous academical ''Discourses'' (1774), he wrote that the painter may use the work of the ancients as a "magazine of common property, always open to the public, whence every man has a right to take what materials he pleases" {{harv|Reynolds|1775|loc=26}}.

==Western architecture==
{{see also|Victorian architecture|Revivalism (architecture)}}
Early examples of eclectic architecture were built in the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]], particularly in the [[Palazzina Cinese]] in [[Palermo]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}.
[[File:Palazzina cinese 0004.JPG|thumb|[[Palazzina Cinese]] in [[Palermo]]|alt=Palazzina cinese 0004.JPG]]

Eclecticism "was an important concept in Western architecture during the mid- and late 19th century, and it reappeared in a new guise in the latter part of the 20th century" {{harv|Muthesius|n.d.}}.

'''Endre Szemerédi''' ({{IPA-hu|ˈɛndrɛ ˈsɛmɛreːdi|lang}}; born August 21, 1940) is a [[Hungary|Hungarian]]-[[United States|American]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nepszava.hu/articles/article.php?id=532617|title=Magyar tudós kapta a matematika Nobel-díját|publisher=[[Népszava]]|date=March 21, 2012|accessdate=April 19, 2012|language=Hungarian}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[mathematician]] and [[computer scientist]], working in the field of [[combinatorics]] and [[theoretical computer science]]. He has been the State of New Jersey Professor of computer science at [[Rutgers University]] since 1986. He also holds a professor emeritus status at the [[Alfréd Rényi Institute of Mathematics]] of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]].

Szemerédi has won prizes in mathematics and science, including the [[Abel Prize]] in 2012. He has made a number of discoveries in combinatorics and computer science, including [[Szemerédi's theorem]], the [[Szemerédi regularity lemma]], the [[Erdős–Szemerédi theorem]], the [[Hajnal–Szemerédi theorem]] and the [[Szemerédi–Trotter theorem]].

==Early life==
Szemerédi was born in [[Budapest]]. Since his parents wished him to become a doctor, Szemerédi enrolled at a college of medicine, but he dropped out after six months (in an interview&lt;ref&gt;By Gabor Stockert&lt;/ref&gt; he explained it: "I was not sure I could do work bearing such responsibility.").&lt;ref name="ams"&gt;{{citation|first1=Martin|last1=Raussen|first2=Christian|last2=Skau|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/201302/rnoti-p221.pdf|journal=[[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]]|title=Interview with Endre Szemerédi|volume=60|year=2013|issue=2|pages=221–231|doi=10.1090/noti948}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heidelberg-laureate-forum.org/blog/laureate/endre-szemeredi/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nopr.niscair.res.in/bitstream/123456789/16108/1/SR%2050%282%29%2016-18.pdf Sunita Chand; Ramesh Chandra Parida . ''Science Reporter'', February 2013, p. 17]&lt;/ref&gt; He studied in [[Eötvös Loránd University]] in Budapest and received his PhD from [[Moscow State University]]. His adviser was [[Israel Gelfand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{mathgenealogy|id=70200}}&lt;/ref&gt; This stemmed from a misspelling, as Szemerédi originally wanted to study with [[Alexander Gelfond]].&lt;ref name="ams"/&gt;

==Academic career==
Szemerédi has been the State of New Jersey Professor of computer science at [[Rutgers University]] since 1986. He has held visiting positions at [[Stanford University]] (1974), [[McGill University]] (1980), the [[University of South Carolina]] (1981–1983) and the [[University of Chicago]] (1985–1986).

==Work==
Endre Szemerédi has published over 200 scientific articles in the fields of discrete mathematics, theoretical computer science, arithmetic combinatorics and discrete geometry. He is best known for his proof from 1975 of an old conjecture of [[Paul Erdős]] and [[Pál Turán]]: if a sequence of natural numbers has positive [[upper density]] then it contains arbitrarily long [[arithmetic progression]]s. This is now known as [[Szemerédi's theorem]]. One of the lemmas introduced in his proof is now known as the [[Szemerédi regularity lemma]], which has become an important lemma in [[combinatorics]], being used for instance in [[property testing]] for graphs and in the theory of [[graph limit]]s.

He is also known for the [[Szemerédi–Trotter theorem]] in [[Incidence geometry (structure)|incidence geometry]] and the [[Hajnal–Szemerédi theorem]] in [[graph theory]]. [[Miklós Ajtai]] and Szemerédi proved the [[corners theorem]], an important step toward higher-dimensional generalizations of the [[Szemerédi's theorem|Szemerédi theorem]]. With Ajtai and [[János Komlós (mathematician)|János Komlós]] he proved the ''ct''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/log ''t'' upper bound for the [[Ramsey number]] ''R''(3,''t''), and constructed a [[sorting network]] of optimal depth. With Ajtai, [[Václav Chvátal]], and [[Monty Newborn|Monroe M. Newborn]], Szemerédi proved the famous Crossing Lemma, that a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] with ''n'' vertices and ''m'' edges, where {{nowrap|''m'' &gt; 4''n''}} has at least {{nowrap|''m''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; / 64''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} [[Crossing lemma|crossings]].  With [[Paul Erdős]], he proved the [[Erdős–Szemerédi theorem]] on the number of sums and products in a finite set. With Wolfgang Paul, [[Nick Pippenger]], and [[William T. Trotter|William Trotter]], he established a separation between [[Non-deterministic Turing machine|nondeterministic]] [[linear time]] and [[Deterministic computation|deterministic]] linear time, in the spirit of the infamous [[P versus NP problem]].

==Awards and honors==
Szemerédi has won numerous awards and honors for his contribution to mathematics and computer science. A few of them are listed here:
* Grünwald Prize (1967)
* Grünwald Prize (1968)
* [[Alfréd Rényi Prize|Rényi Prize]] (1973)
* [[George Pólya Prize]] for Achievement in Applied Mathematics (SIAM), (1975)
* Prize of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (1979)
* State of New Jersey Professorship (1986)
* The [[Leroy P. Steele Prize]] for Seminal Contribution to Research (AMS), (2008)
* The Rolf Schock Prize in Mathematics for deep and pioneering work from 1975 on arithmetic progressions in subsets of the integers (2008)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mta.hu/index.php?id=858&amp;tt_news=7654 Major US Maths Prize Given to HAS Full Member]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, January 9, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Széchenyi Prize]] of the Hungarian Republic for his many fundamental contributions to mathematics and computer science (2012)

Szemerédi is a corresponding member (1982), and member (1987) of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] and a member (2010) of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]]. He is also a member of the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]] and a permanent research fellow at the [[Alfréd Rényi Institute of Mathematics]] in Budapest.  He was the Fairchild Distinguished Scholar at the [[California Institute of Technology]] in 1987–88.
He is an honorary doctor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://kam.mff.cuni.cz/conferences/endrehc/|title=Doctor honoris causa Endre Szemerédi|date=June 15–16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Charles University]] in [[Prague]].
He was the lecturer in the Forty-Seventh Annual DeLong Lecture Series&lt;ref name=delong&gt;[http://math.colorado.edu/~rmg/delong/ DeLong Lecture Series]. Math.colorado.edu. Retrieved on March 22, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[University of Colorado]].  He is also a recipient of the Aisenstadt Chair at CRM,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crm.umontreal.ca/Chaires/chairesPrec_an.shtml Aisenstadt Chair Recipients]. Crm.umontreal.ca. Retrieved on March 22, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Montreal]]. In 2008 he was the Eisenbud Professor at the [[Mathematical Sciences Research Institute]] in [[Berkeley, California]].

In 2012, Szemerédi was awarded the [[Abel Prize]] “for his fundamental contributions to discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science, and in recognition of the profound and lasting impact of these contributions on [[additive number theory]] and [[ergodic theory]]”&lt;ref name=abel&gt;{{cite web|title=Hungarian-American Endre Szemerédi named Abel Prize winner|url=http://www.abelprize.no/nyheter/vis.html?tid=54138|publisher=The Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters|accessdate=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Abel Prize citation also credited Szemerédi with bringing combinatorics to the centre-stage of mathematics and noted his place in the tradition of Hungarian mathematicians such as [[George Pólya]] who emphasized a problem-solving approach to mathematics.&lt;ref name=hindu&gt;{{cite news|last=Ramachandran|first=R.|title=Hungarian mathematician Endre Szemerédi gets 2012 Abel Prize|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/article3025783.ece?homepage=true|accessdate=22 March 2012|newspaper=The Hindu|date=March 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Szemerédi reacted to the announcement by saying that "It is not my own personal achievement, but recognition for this field of mathematics and Hungarian mathematicians," that gave him the most pleasure.&lt;ref name=nj.com&gt;{{cite news|last=Ellis-Nutt|first=Amy|title=Rutgers math professor's discovery earns prestigious award, $1M prize|url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/03/rutgers_math_professors_discov.html|accessdate=22 March 2012|newspaper=NJ.com|date=March 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European Science Fiction Society''' is an international organisation of professionals and fans who are committed to promoting [[science fiction]] in [[Europe]] and European science fiction worldwide.

The organisation was founded at the first [[Eurocon]] (European Science Fiction Convention), which was held in 1972 in [[Trieste]], [[Italy]]. Since that time, the organisation has organized Eurocons at least every two years. The organisation also administrates the [[European SF Awards]].

The society's officers (as re-elected in 2013 in [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]]) are:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esfs.info//].  European Science Fiction Society.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Chairman: Carolina Gómez Lagerlöf, ([[Sweden]])
*Secretary: Gareth Kavanagh ([[Ireland]])
*Treasurer: Vanja Kranjcevic ([[Croatia]])
*Vice Chairman: Saija Kyllönen ([[Finland]])
*Award Administrator: Bridget Wilkinson ([[United Kingdom]])

Bridget Wilkinson served as a society officer for 25 years before standing down at the 2016 [[Eurocon]], held in [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]]. Before that, she ran Fans Across The World co-ordinating science fiction fans from the former [[Eastern Europe]] with their counterparts in the West.

'''Good Books International''' is an online bookstore based in [[New Zealand]]. Since its foundation, the company has operated as a [[non-profit]], donating all its proceeds to [[Oxfam]].

The profits donated to [[Oxfam]] are then invested in projects throughout the world to reduce [[poverty]]. Dr. Jane Cherrington setup Good Books NZ in early 2006. She worked as Chief Executive of the Mental Health Foundation in [[New Zealand]]. She currently works in advertising as head of brand strategy for String Theory.

The initial offering was an online bookstore, which donated all its profits to charity. Good Books International signed a partnership with [[Oxfam]] recently, to donate the company's profits from book sales to joint venture projects with the charitable foundation.&lt;ref name=oxfam&gt;{{cite web|title=A new chapter in the fight against inequality with Good Books|url=https://www.oxfam.org.nz/what-we-do/issues/good-books|publisher=[[Oxfam]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company received critical acclaim in 2012 for their viral online video, promoting the Good Books ethos.&lt;ref name=inspiration&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maclaed|first1=Duncan|title=Good Books Great Writers|url=http://theinspirationroom.com/daily/2012/good-books-great-writers/|publisher=The Inspiration Room|date=November 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hotnheavy&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fahy|first1=Ben|title=Getting hot'n'heavy with Good Books|url=http://idealog.co.nz/venture/2012/11/getting-hotnheavy-good-books|publisher=Idealog|date=November 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Good Books by String Theory|url=http://www.luerzersarchive.com/en/features/campaigns/good-books-by-string-theory-224.html|publisher=Lurzer's Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; It compared how other large online booksellers often made huge profits on book sales while other parts of the world struggled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Collazo|first1=Angelo|title=Interview with Buck: Good Books “Metamorphosis”|url=http://motionographer.com/2012/03/26/interview-buck-good-books-metamorphosis/|publisher=Motionographer|date=March 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advertisement went on to win a gold and bronze award at the [[London International Awards]] later that year, as well as many others including the coveted D&amp;AD Yellow Pencil for Film Advertising Craft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=D&amp;AD Awards Winners 2013|url=http://www.creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2013/june/dad-awards-winners-2013/|publisher=Creative review|date=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=D&amp;AD hands out three Kiwi pencils as Axis winners keep winning|url=http://stoppress.co.nz/news/dad|publisher=StopPress|date=June 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacLeod|first1=Duncan|title=D&amp;AD Awards 2013|url=http://theinspirationroom.com/daily/2013/dad-nominations-2013/|publisher=Inspiration Room|date=April 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Colenso BBDO wins one D&amp;AD Yellow Pencil for 'Donation Glasses'; DraftFCB NZ wins one Yellow Pencil for 'Call Girl' campaign and String Theory wins one Yellow Pencil for 'Metamorphosis' work|url=http://www.campaignbrief.com/nz/2013/06/colenso-bbdo-nz-wins-one-dad-y.html|publisher=Campaign Brief|date=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The digital campaign known as "Good Books Great Writers Series", where each short film attempts to creatively tell the Good Books story in the style of the world's most famous literary talents, and hand-picked directors donate their skill and time, free of charge, to create films for the charity.&lt;ref name=hotnheavy /&gt;&lt;ref name=inspiration /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Good Books launches 2nd installment 'Havana Heat' in Great Writers series via String Theory|url=http://www.campaignbrief.com/2012/11/good-books-launches-2nd-instal.html|publisher=Campaign Brief|date=November 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series had a follow-up advertisement in late 2012. Named ‘Havana Heat’, it was written as a steamy love letter to Good Books, in the bodice-ripping language made famous by Mills &amp; Boon books.&lt;ref name=hotnheavy /&gt;

In 2014, it was announced that the [[non-profit]] had begun to work on a similar project with [[Oxfam|Oxfam Canada]], as well as Oxfam New Zealand. During an interview, it was stated that it had taken over five years for the deal to be reached. The reason for the project's delay was due to the innovative nature of the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fahy|first1=Ben|title=Horse's mouth: Dr Jane Cherrington|url=http://stoppress.co.nz/news/horses-mouth-dr-jane-cherrington|publisher=StopPress|date=July 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Good Books again received attention in 2015 for a for the third installment of the Good Books Great Writers Series, We Need to Talk About Alice, an ethereal rendition of [[Alice in Wonderland]], which was a finalist in the 2016 AXIS Awards For Good category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bagge|first1=Holly|title=String Theory and Plenty go on an adventure to wonderland for Good Books|url=http://stoppress.co.nz/news/good-books-story|publisher=StopPress|date=October 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2016 Axis Awards - Winners|url=http://caanz.co.nz/awards/axis/2016-axis-awards-winners/|publisher=Caanz|date=March 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oxfam partnership==
Good Books have run a number of schemes with [[Oxfam]] to provide charitable donations to fund projects in partnership with [[Oxfam]]. Each time a book is purchased from Good Books, a percentage is given to [[Oxfam]] to fund these projects. Much of the work carried out by the projects has been based in the [[Oceania|Oceanic]] regions of [[Asia]] including, [[East Timor]], [[Fiji]] and [[Papua New Guinea]]. Their work varies dependent on the region, but includes clean water, [[sanitation]], agriculture development and access to [[education]].&lt;ref name=oxfam /&gt;

As part of the scheme, Good Books International also suggests that customers sign up to [[Oxfam]]'s donation service.&lt;ref name=oxfam /&gt;

The [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style arrived in [[Poland]] in the first half of the 13th century with the arrival of members of the Dominican and Franciscan orders. The first elements of the new style are evident in the foundation of the Dominican Trinity church in [[Kraków]] (1226–1250),&lt;ref name="Strzala-2"&gt;Marek Strzala, [https://web.archive.org/web/20120308154924/http://www.krakow-info.com/Kaz_walk.htm Stroll through the historic Kazimierz area.] ''Krakow Info.com'' (Internet Archive). Retrieved {{nobreak|February 13, 2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt; built by Bishop [[Iwo Odrowąż]]. Another of the earliest manifestations of the Gothic in Poland was the rebuilding of the [[Wrocław Cathedral]] which started in 1244. The earliest building was completely covered in Poland, built in Gothic style chapel is considered [[Sanctuary of St. Jadwiga in Trzebnica|St. Hedwig in Trzebnica]] (1268–1269) in the monastery of Cistercian. 

In the north and west of the country, there are some scarce [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] predecessors (see [[Brick Romanesque#Poland|here]]). Most Gothic buildings in Poland are made of [[brick]], and belong to the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] [[Brick Gothic]], especially in northern Poland (see [[List of Brick Gothic buildings#Poland|Significant Brick Gothic buildings in Poland]]). Nonetheless, not all Gothic buildings in Poland are made of brick. For example, the [[Wawel]] Cathedral in Kraków is mostly stone-built. Poland also has some Gothic [[fieldstone church]]es, mostly of relatively small size. The centers of Polish Gothic are Kraków, [[Gdańsk]], [[Toruń]] and [[Wrocław]].

The reign of the king [[Casimir the Great]] was the time of the greatest flowering of gothic architecture in Poland. For the second time a similar development took place in the late Gothic phase, during the reign of [[Casimir the Jagiellonian]].

In the region of [[Lesser Poland]] (on the south) buildings were built of brick with stone blocks to the implementation details. Churches built in the area are often two-nave. Are also found very high basilica of the aisles. Silesia resembles gothic solution of Malopolska with influences from the Czech. Here, too, in addition to the blows of stone bricks were used. One of the characteristics is the location of the tower – at the intersection of the transept of the church choir, on the south-east. The architecture of the northern lands strongly influenced patterns inspired by the [[Teutonic Order]] state buildings and other cities of [[Hanseatic League|Hansa]]. Brick churches are mainly [[Pomerania]] halls of mighty towers, usually situated in the main axis. Much less common is the basilica. In [[Mazovia]] not developed different forms of Gothic. Occurring on this earth buildings are characterized by rather simplified forms already known.

== Castles ==
From the 13th century began to modernize the seat of royal and princely expanding existing buildings functional program (such as [[Wawel Castle]], [[Legnica]]), and building castles, which initially could be built only with the consent of the ruler. For this reason, the oldest castles have public character of the building. Initially, in the 13th century, the characteristic elements of the locks were placed in a role within the wood-earth castles, so the first castles were irregular in shape (e.g., in [[Opole]]). After the mid-13th century abandoned the construction palatiów to be connected rather with the earlier epoch. Regular shape of castles spread throughout the Polish Kingdom in the reign of Casimir the Great, and built them into this shape, even in areas of previous castles (Rawa, Łęczyca, Koło). Castles and monasteries built by Joannites (Stare Drawsko, [[Łagów, Świebodzin County|Łagów]], [[Swobnica]], [[Pęzino]]) and the Teutonic Order, in the state created by them in Prussia (Malbork, [[Radzyń Chełmiński]], [[Niedzica]]) and bishops (in Lipowiec). The castles were built or final defense towers (known as stołp) and residential towers (donżon). 

The best preserved Gothic castles are:
* in [[Lesser Poland]]: [[Chęciny]], [[Odrzykoń]], [[Czorsztyn]], [[Niedzica]], Kazimierz Dolny, [[Bobolice]], [[Będzin]], Lipowiec, [[Ogrodzieniec]] and others on [[Trail of the Eagles' Nests]]
* in northern Poland: built by the Teutonic Order in [[Malbork]], [[Nidzica]], Golub, Radzyń Chełmiński, [[Gniew]]; or on their strongholds modeled (usually built on the estates of bishops) in [[Kwidzyn]], Lidzbark Warmiński, [[Olsztyn]], [[Reszel]].
* in [[Mazovia]]: Castle in [[Ciechanów]], [[Czersk, Masovian Voivodeship|Czersk]], [[Liw, Poland|Liw]].
* in [[Greater Poland]]: Castle in the [[Koło]], [[Szamotuły]], [[Gołańcz]], [[Łęczyca]].
* in [[Lower Silesia]]: [[Siedlęcin Tower]], [[Bolków]], [[Chojnik]], [[Żmigród]], [[Świny, Lower Silesian Voivodeship|Świny]]

== Town halls ==
A town hall called [[Ratusz]] was a symbol of a city's power in the Middle Ages.  Around the town hall were other buildings associated with the function of the urban organism: hall, municipal building, weight, merchant stalls and pillory.  Examples of unconverted later Gothic town halls include the [[Wrocław Town Hall]], the Old Town Hall in Toruń and town halls in Chojna, Gdańsk and Szczecin.&lt;ref name="jaktrafic"&gt;[http://www.jaktrafic.org/ratusze/regulamin_ratusze.pdf Szlakiem Rynków i Ratuszy w Polsce] [[PTTK]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gosciniec"&gt;Elżbieta Zagłoba-Zygler, [http://gosciniec.pttk.pl/16_2004/index.php?co=061 20 lat rajdu motorowego PTTK "Ratusze w Polsce"] "Gosciniec" Polskiego Towarzystwa Turystyczno-Krajoznawczego, PTTK&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosikon"&gt;Janusz Rosikoń, [http://www.rosikonpress.com/dzial_48/towar_karta_4/Ratusze_w_Polsce.html Ratusze w Polsce] Rosikon Press&lt;/ref&gt;  Only [[Town Hall Tower, Kraków|the Gothic tower]] of [[Kraków Town Hall|the Ratusz town hall]] in [[Kraków]] has survived.&lt;ref&gt;Kamil Janicki, [http://ciekawostkihistoryczne.pl/2012/01/19/co-sie-stalo-z-krakowskim-ratuszem/ Co się stało z krakowskim ratuszem?] Ciekawostki turystyczne.&lt;/ref&gt; The gothic town hall on the Old Town Market Square in Warsaw was demolished in 1820.

== Houses ==
Existing settlements received in the 13th and 14th centuries tracking new laws (usually based on [[Magdeburg Law]]). Urban area is usually divided grid of streets perpendicular to the plot by creating a chessboard layout. Residential buildings, in the upper reaches is still built of wood or timber-framed art. In order to prevent the transmission of fire during the fire, often the wall was increased at the border of two adjacent parcels and tracts of gable roof receives addressed to the agent. Facades of houses stepped or triangular peaks. Houses of rich burghers sometimes received in the form of a richer decor. More often it was a topic mimicking polychrome wall, and wimpergi tracery. An example of building in the Gothic style is the house of Copernicus in Torun, in Sandomierz Długosz House, oldest building of Jagiellonian University – Collegium Maius, building on ul. Łazienna 22 in Toruń.

== Town walls and town gates ==
The city walls surrounded, sometimes in place of the earlier shafts and such investment is carried out for many years, making frequent upgrades. Older consolidation often was increased. The sequence is often interrupted by walls tower. Cities sometimes receive a new, second belt walls (e.g., Wrocław, Toruń). Leading to the ornate gates of cities often preceded the late Gothic period barbakanami connected with them neck. First this form of defense on Polish soil was established in Toruń – Barbican Starotoruński of 1426, the best preserved in Poland barbican Barbican in Kraków. To this day preserved fragments of walls, of which most survived the gate, for example, in [[Szydłów]], [[Sandomierz]], Kraków [[St. Florian's Gate]] and the [[Kraków barbican]]. Significant parts of the walls have been preserved in [[Stargard Szczeciński|Stargard]], [[Pyrzyce]], [[Byczyna]], Toruń. In [[Chełmno]] and [[Paczków]] city walls are preserved almost in its entirety.

The '''Gẹlẹdẹ''' spectacle of the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] is a public display by colorful masks which combines art and ritual dance to amuse, educate and inspire worship.&lt;ref name=Lawal&gt;{{cite book|last=Lawal|first=Babatunde|title=The Gèlèdé spectacle : art, gender, and social harmony in an African culture|year=1996|publisher=University of Washington press|location=Seattle|isbn=978-0-295-97599-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gelede celebrates “Mothers” (''awon iya wa''), a group that includes female ancestors and deities as well as the elderly women of the community, and the power and spiritual capacity these women have in society.

==Gelede in the context of Yoruba belief==
The Gelede social agenda rests on the Yoruba maxim ''Eso l'aye'' (The world is fragile). In other words, life is delicate and should be lived with caution and with an emphasis on diplomacy, consideration, respect and harmony.&lt;ref name=Lawal /&gt;

==The origins of Gelede==
Most Yoruba myths of origin can be found in the divination narratives knows at [[Odu Ifa]]. There are approximately 256 Odu Ifa, each of which contains a number of poems called [[ese Ifa]]. A typical ese Ifa is a narrative about a person or animal with a problem and the steps to resolve that problem. An ese Ifa explains the origins of Gelede as beginning with [[Yemoja]], "The Mother of all the orisa and all living things." Yemoja could not have children and consulted an Ifa oracle, who advised her to offer sacrifices and to dance with wooden images on her head and metal anklets on her feet. After performing this ritual, she became pregnant. Her first child was a boy, nicknamed "Efe" (the humorist); the Efe mask emphasizes song and jests because of the personality of its namesake. Yemoja's second child was a girl, nicknamed "Gelede" because she was obese like her mother. Also like her mother, Gelede loved dancing.

After getting married themselves, neither Gelede or Efe's partner could have children. The Ifa oracle suggested they try the same ritual that had worked for their mother. No sooner than Efe and Gelede performed these rituals- dancing with wooden images on their heads and metal anklets on their feet- they started having children. These rituals developed into the Gelede masked dance and was perpetuated by the descendants of Efe and Gelede.&lt;ref name=Lawal /&gt;

This narrative is one of many stories that explains the origin of Gelebe. An outdated theory states that the beginning of Gelede might be associated with the change from a [[matriarchal]] to a [[patriarchal]] society.&lt;ref name=Lawal /&gt;

==Gelede spectacle==
Although Gelede ceremony may be staged at any time of the year (to better the lot of an individual, to cleanse the society of pestilence, to induce rain, to enrich human fertility, to enlist the support of supernatural forces and the "powerful mothers" in wartime, and to honor the dead), the most elaborate performance occurs during the annual festival.

Once the exact dates of the festival are fixed, usually through divination, the Iyalase notifies the head of the community and the important chiefs. Messages then go out to all members of the Gelede society outside the town or working far away to return home for the celebration.

The festival begins with an all-night concert called efe, which features the Efe male mask, who uses satire to entertain and educate. Given the concern of the Gelede society with peace and social stability, it is not surprising that didactic themes recur in ''efe'' songs.

After the efe dance, most of the attendees spend the morning sleeping in preparation for the afternoon dance, which takes place in the marketplace and features pairs of male dancers who perform to fast-paced music with a vigorous beat.

The Gelede ceremony involves carefully choreographed dance, singing and music, and especially drumming. The performances are given by men, wearing masks that feature sculpted images of scenes including animals and people or sewing machines and drums. The pairs of men masquerade as women to amuse, please and placate the mothers who are considered very powerful, and who may use their powers for good or destructive purposes. These powers are especially linked to childbirth. The abilities they possess may be activated either consciously or unconsciously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Birmingham Museum of Art | title = Birmingham Museum of Art: A Guide to the Collection | publisher = Giles | year = 2010 | location = London | page = 71 | url = http://www.birminghammuseumstore.org/bmapu.html | accessdate = 2011-07-01 | isbn = 978-1-904832-77-5 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110910171150/http://www.birminghammuseumstore.org/bmapu.html | archivedate = 2011-09-10 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gelede costume and headdress==

Gelede masks are worn with a costume consisting of layers of elaborate, colorful cloth.

The Gelede "mask" is more accurately a headdress, since it rests on top of the head and the wearer's face is covered by a cloth veil. The headdress takes the form of a human head, on top of which are motifs that are intended to entertain onlookers but, in addition, usually address social concerns that may also be expressed in songs that are part of the masquerade. The headdresses are usually brightly painted.&lt;ref name=Siegmann /&gt;

Individuals or families will usually go to any length to make their headdresses as attractive and humorous as possible. The endless variety of the motifs and their combinations makes it difficult to attempt to construct a typology of Gelede headdresses.&lt;ref name=Lawal /&gt;

Most of the headdresses have facial adornments, ranging from lineage marks to decorative tattoos, which are either incised or painted.

[[Babatunde Lawal]] writes: "The headdress is to the costume what the [[Ase (Yoruba)#The head as the site of ase|head (ori)]] is to the human body. It is an index of identification and the essence of the masker's personality as long as he is inside the mask. In spite of the comical representations that often appear on the headdress, the face below the superstructure remains serene, as if stressing the paradox that is life-and the need to live life with special care."&lt;ref name=Lawal /&gt;

The '''''Kakinomoto no Ason Hitomaro Kashū''''' (柿本朝臣人麿歌集, "Collection of Poems/Songs by [[Kakinomoto no Ason Hitomaro]]") or '''''Hitomaro Kashū''''' (人麿歌集) is a [[lost work|lost]] collection of ''[[waka (poetry)|waka]]'' poems that served as a source for the compilers of the ''[[Man'yōshū]]''. There is some disagreement among scholars as to which poems included in the surviving ''Man'yōshū'' originally came from the ''Hitomaro Kashū'', but it is between 364 and 370. Scholars have speculated on the nature of the original ''Hitomaro Kashū'' based on the surviving fragmentary and disjointed evidence.

The compiler of the ''Kakinomoto no Ason Hitomaro Kashū'',{{sfnm|1a1=Aso|1y=1983|1p=684}} (hereafter the ''Hitomaro Kashū''{{sfnm|1a1=Aso|1y=1983|1p=685}}) as well as its date{{sfnm|1a1=Aso|1y=1983|1p=684}} and number of books are all unknown.{{sfnm|1a1=Aso|1y=1983|1p=684}} While the text itself does not survive,{{sfnm|1a1=Aso|1y=1983|1p=685}} scholars have been able to guess as to the form the work probably took based on the portions of the late eighth-century ''[[Man'yōshū]]'' that incorporate a large number of its poems.{{sfnm|1a1=Aso|1y=1983|1p=685}} Poems attributed to it were incorporated into books 2, 3, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 of the later anthology.{{sfnm|1a1=Aso|1y=1983|1pp=684-685}}

== Contents ==
Depending on whether the ''Man'yōshū'' poems numbered 146 (book 2), 1715, 1716, 1717, 1718 and 1718 (all book 9) were originally taken from the ''Hitomaro Kashū'', the number of poems varies from 364 to 370.{{sfnm|1a1=Aso|1y=1983|1p=685}} {{illm|Mizue Aso|ja|阿蘇瑞枝}}, in her article on the work for the ''[[Nihon Koten Bungaku Daijiten]]'', gave the figure of 365.{{sfnm|1a1=Aso|1y=1983|1p=685}} These consist of two ''[[chōka]]'', 35 ''[[sedōka]]'', and 328 ''[[tanka]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Aso|1y=1983|1p=685}} (All the disputed poems are ''tanka'', so this figure would vary between 327 and 333.{{sfnm|1a1=Aso|1y=1983|1p=685}}) [[Susumu Nakanishi]], in his ''[[Man'yōshū Jiten]]'', gave a figure of 369.{{sfnm|1a1=Nakanishi|1y=1985|1p=221}}

=== Script format of ''tanka'' ===
The ''tanka'' attributed by the compiler(s) of the ''Man'yōshū'' to the ''Hitomaro Kashū'' are divided into two categories based on how distinctly particles and auxiliary words are represented therein.{{sfnm|1a1=Aso|1y=1983|1p=585}} The poems that carefully indicate these words are called ''hi-ryakutai-ka'' (非略体歌),{{sfnm|1a1=Aso|1y=1983|1p=585}} and those that do not are called''ryakutai-ka'' (略体歌).{{sfnm|1a1=Aso|1y=1983|1p=585}} Roughly 127 poems fall into the former group, with roughly 196 in the latter,{{sfnm|1a1=Aso|1y=1983|1p=585}} though opinions on which poems are which group differ between various scholars.{{sfnm|1a1=Aso|1y=1983|1p=585}}

'''Khmer sculpture''' refers to the stone sculpture of the [[Khmer Empire]], which ruled a territory based on modern [[Cambodia]], but rather larger, from the 9th to the 13th century. The most celebrated examples are found in [[Angkor]], which served as the seat of the empire. 

==Styles==
There are several recognisable specific art styles of the Angkorian period:&lt;ref name = "National Museum"&gt;{{cite web |title = Khmer Art History |publisher = [[National Museum of Cambodia]] | url= http://www.cambodiamuseum.info/en_khmer_art_history.html | accessdate = 13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Phnom Kulen|Kulen]] style (c.825-75)
# [[Koh Ker]] style (941-944)
# [[Baphuon]] style (1010-1080)
# [[Angkor Wat]] style (1100-1175)
# [[Bayon]] style (late 12th to early 13th century)

==Movement away from Indian models==
[[File:005 Apsaras at Angkor Wat, Cambodia.jpg|thumb|left|[[Apsara]] carving at [[Angkor Wat]].]]
Earlier Khmer art were influenced by Indian influences of Hindu themes. By the 7th century, Khmer sculpture begins to drift away from its Hindu influences – pre-Gupta for the Buddhist figures, Pallava for the Hindu figures – and through constant stylistic evolution, it comes to develop its own originality, which by the 10th century can be considered complete and absolute. An example of Khmer style that totally departed from Indian sculpture tradition is the wholeness of its figure, which bears similarities to the ancient Egyptian sculpture. Unlike almost all of Indian and Javanese Hindu-Buddhist stone sculptures, which were carved in [[high relief]]s, slabs or supported by [[stelae]] on the figure's back, Khmer sculpture is carved wholly in the round. Khmer stone sculpture did not employ any stelae on the back of the figure to support it, as the result broken arms, hands or ankles vividly attested to the vulnerability of this format. Nevertheless, Khmer sculptors seems to wish their works to be seen from all sides in the garbagriha in the center of the temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Gardner's Art through the Ages: Backpack Edition, Book C: Non-Western Art to 1300 | first =Fred | last =Kleiner |publisher = Cengage Learning, 2015 | page = 456 | url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=P4fCBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=id#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | isbn = 9781305544918 | accessdate = 13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khmers attempted to make free-standing statues, supported by an arch or by an attribute of the divinity such as a piece of clothing or a hand-held object.

Khmer sculpture soon goes beyond religious representation, which becomes almost a pretext in order to portray court figures in the guise of gods and goddesses. But furthermore, it also comes to constitute a means and end in itself for the execution of stylistic refinement, like a kind of testing ground. We have already seen how the social context of the Khmer kingdom provides a second key to understanding this art. But we can also imagine that on a more exclusive level, small groups of intellectuals and artists were at work, competing among themselves in mastery and refinement as they pursued a hypothetical perfection of style.

The gods we find in Khmer sculpture are those of the two great religions of India, [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]]. Priests supervised the execution of the works, attested to in the high iconographic precision of the sculptures. Nonetheless, unlike those Hindu images which repeat an idealized stereotype, these images are treated with great realism and originality because they depict living models: the king and his court. The true social function of Khmer art was, in fact, the glorification of the [[aristocracy]] through these images of the gods embodied in the princes. In fact, the cult of the “deva-raja” required the development of an eminently aristocratic art in which the people were supposed to see the tangible proof of the sovereign’s divinity, while the aristocracy took pleasure in seeing itself – if, it’s true, in idealized form – immortalized in the splendour of intricate adornments, elegant dresses and extravagant jewelry.
[[File:Fronton Cambodge Musée Guimet 9971.jpg|thumb|Relief from Angkor]]

The sculptures are images of gods, royal and imposing presences with feminine sensuality, giving impressions of figures at the courts with considerable power.  The sculptures represent the chosen divinity in the orthodox manner and succeeds in portraying, with great skill and expertise, high figures of the courts in all of their splendour, in the attire, adornments and jewelry of a sophisticated beauty.

But if we go beyond this initial impression, we can pause to observe some of the details of the sculptures, such as the double arc drawn by the eyebrows on the foreheads, evoked below by the wisely sketched curve of the noses and further down, by the double arc which masterfully outlines the lips and the double chin. Following a hypothetical vertical line down still further, we find another double arc outlining the breasts, and then, continuing down from the waist all along the skirts and ending in the ankles, we find almost at the bottom, a twisted double arc intended to represent the other side of the skirts. This detail serves, above all, to eliminate a certain hieratic fixedness, which was relatively common in the Khmer statues of lesser quality.

Ever since 1864, when [[France]] established a Protectorate in Cambodia, Western travellers have been amazed by the impressive ruins of Angkor. Not long after, once the [[École française d'Extrême-Orient]] began to study and catalogue the findings made at the excavations, the growing number of scholars from all around the world, art lovers and admirers of this [[sculpture]], became fervent proponents of Khmer Art.

“Khmer Art, captivating in its civility, refinement and delight, open to all forms of life, is made in the image of the country and its inhabitants. Nevertheless, among the arts of the Far East, few are as accessible to the Western temperament. Its profound beauty impresses itself upon the spirit and sensibility without requiring prior study. Its sobriety, its horror of excess and its sense of balance and harmony allow it to attain universal value.” Thus wrote [[Madeleine Giteau]], the distinguished member of the École française d’Extrême-Orient, in the introduction to her book Les Khmers in 1965. 

Currently, the largest museums of the West dedicate entire halls to Khmer sculpture, not to mention the enormous exhibition which took place first at the Galeries Nationales du [[Grand Palais]] in Paris and later at the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington in 1997.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="403">'''Lapidary style''' is prose that is appropriate for memorials, mausoleums, stelae, and other commemorations in which words are "etched in stone"; it is concise, pithy, elegant, and sententious.  The meaning extends to text in that style which is printed on paper rather than carved into monuments.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20127">This is a '''list of books in [[computational geometry]].'''
There are two major, largely nonoverlapping categories:
*Combinatorial computational geometry, which deals with collections of discrete objects or defined in discrete terms: points, lines, polygons, polytopes, etc., and algorithms of discrete/combinatorial character are used
*Numerical computational geometry, also known as [[geometric modeling]] and [[computer-aided geometric design]] (CAGD), which deals with modelling of shapes of real-life objects in terms of curves and surfaces with algebraic representation.

==Combinatorial computational geometry==

===General-purpose textbooks===
* {{cite book
|authors = [[Franco P. Preparata]] and [[Michael Ian Shamos]] | title = Computational Geometry - An Introduction | publisher = [[Springer-Verlag]]| year = 1985 | id = 1st edition: {{ISBN|0-387-96131-3}}; 2nd printing, corrected and expanded, 1988: {{ISBN|3-540-96131-3}}; Russian translation, 1989: {{ISBN|5-03-001041-6}}}}
*:The book is the first comprehensive monograph on the level of a graduate textbook to systematically cover the fundamental aspects of the emerging discipline of computational geometry. It is written by founders of the field and the first edition covered all major developments in the preceding 10 years. In the aspect of comprehensiveness it was preceded only by the 1984 survey paper, Lee, D, T., Preparata, F. P. : "Computational geometry - a survey". ''[[IEEE Trans. on Computers]]''. Vol. 33, No. 12, pp.&amp;nbsp;1072–1101 (1984). It is focused on two-dimensional problems, but also has digressions into higher dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{MR|0805539}}, {{MR|1004870}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Zbl|0575.68037}}, {{Zbl|0575.68059}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*:The initial core of the book was M.I.Shamos' doctoral dissertation, which was suggested to turn into a book by a yet another pioneer in the field, [[Ronald Graham]].
*:The introduction covers the history of the field, basic data structures, and necessary notions from the [[theory of computation]] and geometry.
*:The subsequent sections cover [[geometric searching]] ([[point location]], [[range searching]]), [[convex hull]] computation, proximity-related problems ([[closest points]], computation and applications of the [[Voronoi diagram]], [[Euclidean minimum spanning tree]], [[triangulation]]s, etc.), [[geometric intersection problems]], algorithms for sets of [[isothetic rectangle]]s
* {{cite book
|author = [[Herbert Edelsbrunner]] |year = 1987 | title = Algorithms in Combinatorial Geometry | publisher = [[Springer-Verlag]] | isbn = 0-89791-517-8}}
*:The monograph is a rather advanced exposition of problems and approaches in computational geometry focused on the role of [[hyperplane arrangement]]s, which are shown to constitute a basic underlying combinatorial-geometric structure in certain areas of the field. The primary target audience are active theoretical researchers in the field, rather than application developers. Unlike most of books in computational geometry focused on 2- and 3-dimensional problems (where most applications of computational geometry are), the book aims to treat its subject in the general multi-dimensional setting.&lt;ref&gt;A review of Edelsbrunner's book in {{Zbl|0634.52001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{cite book
|authors = [[Mark de Berg]], [[Otfried Cheong]], [[Marc van Kreveld]], and [[Mark Overmars]] | year = 2008 | title = Computational Geometry | publisher = [[Springer-Verlag]] | edition = 3rd revised | isbn = 3-540-77973-6 | id= 1st edition (1997): {{ISBN|3-540-61270-X}}}}
*:The textbook provides an introduction to computation geometry from the point of view of practical applications. Starting with an introduction chapter, each of the 15 remaining ones formulates a real application problem, formulates an underlying geometrical problem, and discusses techniques of computational geometry useful for its solution, with algorithms provided in pseudocode. The book treats mostly 2- and 3-dimensional geometry. The goal of the book is to provide a comprehensive introduction into methods and approached, rather than the cutting edge of the research in the field: the presented algorithms provide transparent and reasonably efficient solutions based on fundamental "building blocks" of computational geometry.&lt;ref&gt;Reviews in {{Zbl|0877.68001}} (1st ed.), {{Zbl|0939.68134}} (2nd ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.uu.nl/geobook/ About the book by de Berg, van Kreveld, Overmars, and Schwarzkopf]&lt;/ref&gt;
*:The book consists of the following chapters (which provide both solutions for the topic of the title and its applications): "Computational Geometry (Introduction)" "Line Segment Intersection", "Polygon Triangulation", "Linear Programming", "Orthogonal Range Searching", "Point Location", "Voronoi Diagrams", "Arrangements and Duality", "Delaunay Triangulations", "More Geometric Data Structures", "Convex Hulls", "Binary Space Partitions", "Robot Motion Planning", "Quadtrees", "Visibility Graphs", "Simplex Range Searching".

It was also retitled ''[[Gai-Luron]]'' and now Jujube became Gai-Luron's sidekick. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.lambiek.net/artists/g/gotlib.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lovejoy Columns''', located in [[Portland, Oregon]], United States, supported the Lovejoy Ramp, a viaduct that from 1927 to 1999 carried the western approach to the [[Broadway Bridge (Portland)|Broadway Bridge]] over the freight tracks in what is now the [[Pearl District, Portland, Oregon|Pearl District]]. The columns were painted by Greek immigrant Tom Stefopoulos between 1948 and 1952. In 1999, the viaduct was demolished but the columns were spared due to the efforts of the architectural group [[Rigga]]. For the next five years, attempts to restore the columns were unsuccessful and they remained in storage beneath the [[Fremont Bridge (Portland)|Fremont Bridge]].

In 2005, two of the original columns were resited at Northwest 10th Avenue between Everett and Flanders Streets. The [[Regional Arts &amp; Culture Council]] was searching for photographs showing the murals in their original location for an ongoing restoration project. In 2006, Randy Shelton reconstructed the artworks on the columns using the photographs for reference.

In the late 1990s, developer Homer Williams persuaded the city to demolish the viaduct to open up dozens of blocks in the redeveloping Pearl District.&lt;ref name=Speer /&gt; Preservation efforts began immediately. In 1998, Georgiana Nehl completed a painting of the columns called ''Guardians: Under the Lovejoy Ramp'' to "catch a small flavor of these 'guardians,' while they were still in place in their surprising location—before they were lost in the name of progress".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Art Search: Guardians: Under the Lovejoy Ramp|url=http://racc.org/public-art/search/?recid=1580.146|publisher=Regional Arts &amp; Culture Council|accessdate=December 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, James Henderson took a series of photographs of the remaining pigments of the original paintings; he recorded the murals using cross-polarized lighting and used digital enhancement to restore the colors.&lt;ref name=RACC1&gt;Regional Arts &amp; Culture Council:

===Demolition===
The viaduct was removed in 1999,&lt;ref name="eulogy for ramp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ramping down"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ramping down [photograph and caption only]|work=The Oregonian|date=November 2, 1999|location=Portland, Oregon|quote=The last pieces of the 73-year-old Northwest Lovejoy Street viaduct and the 10th Avenue ramp to the Broadway Bridge are being removed this week.}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the architectural group Rigga persuaded the city to preserve the paintings and the columns. Rigga said that if the murals had been removed from the columns, "much of their magic would be lost".&lt;ref name=Harrison /&gt; The City of Portland's Office of Transportation earmarked funds to remove ten columns; an ad hoc committee called Friends of the Columns was formed to raise money for their storage, restoration and public display, which was estimated to cost $460,000.&lt;ref name=DJC&gt;{{cite journal|title=Tumblin' down: Lovejoy Viaduct a casualty of progress|journal=[[Daily Journal of Commerce]]|date=August 19, 1999|url=http://djcoregon.com/news/1999/08/19/tumblin-down-lovejoy-viaduct-a-casualty-of-progress/|accessdate=December 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; City Commissioner [[Charlie Hales]] said, "Saving the Lovejoy columns and the artwork provides a real bridge between the rich history of this industrial area and its future as a residential neighborhood. I am pleased that we are able to save these columns and look forward to them being placed on some of the park spaces in the River District."&lt;ref name=DJC/&gt; According to the James M. Harrison Art and Design Studio, "Extracting the columns both captured the space created by Tom and preserved a ruin that would continue to tell a story. The fragile paintings preserved the mighty concrete."&lt;ref name=Harrison /&gt; During the next five years, attempts by the city, and non-profit and entrepreneurial groups to restore the columns were unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=Speer /&gt; [[Boora Architects]]' Northwest Marshall Street Pedestrian Bridge Feasibility Study (2001), funded by the [[Portland Development Commission]], proposed installing the columns at the intersection of Northwest 9th Avenue and Naito Parkway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NW Marshall Street Pedestrian Bridge Feasibility Study|url=http://www.pdc.us/Libraries/Document_Library/NW_Marshall_Pedestrian_Bridge_Feasibility_Study_pdf.sflb.ashx|publisher=Boora Architects, Inc.|accessdate=December 24, 2014|date=October 31, 2001|format=PDF|pages=10, 13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224202817/http://www.pdc.us/Libraries/Document_Library/NW_Marshall_Pedestrian_Bridge_Feasibility_Study_pdf.sflb.ashx|archivedate=December 24, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The columns were featured in a 2003 article by the [[Getty Conservation Institute]] called "The Conservation of Outdoor Contemporary Murals", which described best practices for preserving murals and included photographs of the columns during the demolition phase, with conservator J. Claire Dean assessing one of them.&lt;ref name=Rainer&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rainer|first1=Lesie|title=The Conservation of Outdoor Contemporary Murals|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/newsletters/18_2/feature.html|publisher=[[Getty Conservation Institute]]|accessdate=December 24, 2014|date=Summer 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; From August 10 to September 4, 2004, Portland-based artist and filmmaker [[Vanessa Renwick]] exhibited a paper and video installation called ''Lovejoy Lost'', featuring camera work by her and [[Gus Van Sant]], for the PDX Window Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lovejoy Lost: August 10, 2004 to September 4, 2004|url=http://www.pdxcontemporaryart.com/lovejoy-lost|publisher=PDX Contemporary Art|accessdate=December 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ODKA&gt;{{cite web|title=Lovejoy Lost|url=http://www.odoka.org/the_work/lovejoy_lost/|publisher=Oregon Department of Kick Ass: The Work of Vanessa Renwick|accessdate=December 7, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140513031227/http://www.odoka.org/the_work/lovejoy_lost/|archivedate=May 13, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2004, ''[[Willamette Week]]'' reported that the columns were being held at a storage yard at Northwest 14th Avenue and Savier Street, beneath the [[Fremont Bridge (Portland)|Fremont Bridge]]. The paper said, "[h]alf-covered in blue tarps, their rusted steel girders sticking out of concrete like veins from a freshly amputated arm, they await the political momentum to rescue them from rot".&lt;ref name=Speer /&gt; Real estate developer John Carroll hoped to site the columns at the Elizabeth Lofts, but former Rigga member James Harrison said he was reluctant to believe it would happen, given their history. Harrison told ''Willamette Week'', "[t]hese things can turn on a dime".&lt;ref name=Speer /&gt;

===Resiting===
Carroll's and Harrison's efforts were realized in 2005 when two of the ten original columns were resited at Northwest 10th Avenue between Everett and Flanders streets. The {{Convert|29000|lb|kg|abbr=on|adj=on}} columns featured a majority of Stefopoulos' paintings.&lt;ref name=ArtWalk /&gt;&lt;ref name=Harrison /&gt; Harrison reportedly watched with "something like fatherly joy" during the installation and said, "[w]e're installing a ruin".&lt;ref name=WW2005&gt;{{cite news|title=Who's coming to town and who's leaving.|url=http://www.wweek.com/portland/article-4896-whos_coming_to_town_and_whos_leaving.html|accessdate=December 7, 2014|work=Willamette Week|date=October 12, 2005 |publisher=City of Roses Newspapers |location=Portland, Oregon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carroll said displaying the columns as public art "will preserve an element of the city’s past for current and future generations" and acknowledged support from the neighborhood, Friends of the Columns and the Portland Development Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Kennedy|title=Columns adorned with Greek art relocate to Elizabeth Lofts|journal=[[Daily Journal of Commerce]]|date=October 6, 2005|url=http://djcoregon.com/news/2005/10/06/columns-adorned-with-greek-art-relocate-to-elizabeth-lofts/|accessdate=February 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Regional Arts &amp; Culture Council was searching for photographs showing the murals in their original location for a restoration project, which would be completed the following summer.&lt;ref name=WW2005 /&gt; In 2006, the columns were reconstructed from the photographs by Randy Shelton.&lt;ref name=ArtWalk/&gt;&lt;ref name=Harrison /&gt; The City of Portland's Bureau of Planning said the resited columns "[celebrate] a period in the district’s history, showcasing the art for a broader audience".&lt;ref name=Guidelines&gt;{{cite web|title=River District Design Guidelines|url=https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bps/article/58869|year=2008||page=33|publisher=City of Portland Bureau of Planning|accessdate=December 9, 2014}} Note: Adopted by the Portland City Council 1996.

An event called "Public Space Invasion" was held in the plaza containing the columns in 2011, inviting guests to "explore the legal limits of Portland's more peculiar public spaces". It advertised "crafts among the condos" and the opportunity to "picnic beside a freeway".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lovejoy Columns|url=http://www.portlandmercury.com/portland/lovejoy-columns/Location?oid=4041594|accessdate=December 23, 2014|work=The Portland Mercury}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Public Space Invasion|url=http://www.portlandmercury.com/portland/public-space-invasion/Event?oid=4067609|accessdate=December 23, 2014|work=The Portland Mercury|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224064120/http://www.portlandmercury.com/portland/public-space-invasion/Event?oid=4067609|archivedate=December 24, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, a bicycle tour called "Lovejoy Columns and Tom" focused on the conservation of the columns, the "almost forgotten history" of Stefopoulos and the rise of the Pearl District. The tour was narrated by Harrison on behalf of Friends of the Columns and guided by "Portland's Museum Lady" Carye Bye; it raised money for a gravestone for Stefopoulos' unmarked grave at [[Rose City Cemetery]]. It included a guided tour at the Hellenic-American Cultural Center and Museum, which was exhibiting ''Master Penworks of Tom Stefopoulos'' to view pen-and-ink art by Stefopoulos. It also included a viewing of Renwick’s unfinished film ''Lovejoy'' and an optional visit to Stefopoulos' grave.&lt;ref name=Penworks/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Lovejoy Columns and Tom Bike Ride":

==Depictions and reception==
[[File:Lovejoy Columns, 2016.jpg|thumb|right|The columns in 2016]]

The ''[[Daily Journal of Commerce]]'' called the columns a Portland "urban legend".&lt;ref name=DJC/&gt; According to [[Richard Speer]] of ''Willamette Week'', "generations of Portlanders grew up counting the Lovejoy columns as one of the city's most unique attractions". Speer also said the columns were once "postcard favorites and seemed as much a part of the city's landscape as the Hawthorne Bridge" and have an "endearing, perspectiveless style".&lt;ref name=Speer /&gt; The murals appeared in Van Sant's film ''[[Drugstore Cowboy]]'' (1989), ''[[Foxfire (1996 film)|Foxfire]]'' (1996) and a music video by [[Elliott Smith]].&lt;ref name=ODKA /&gt;

The resited columns have been included in published walking tours of Portland.&lt;ref name=Ohlsen /&gt;&lt;ref name=Foster /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cook&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cook|first1=Sybilla Avery|title=Walking Portland, Oregon|date=April 2, 2013|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|pages=60–61|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wvPWSWqzCT0C&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=December 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her 2006 book ''Walking Portland: 30 Tours of Stumptown's Funky Neighborhoods, Historic Landmarks, Park Trails, Farmers Markets, and Brewpubs'', Becky Ohlsen said, "Whatever you make of the artwork, the inspired effort that went into preserving it—not to mention the awesome spectacle of those massive columns ripped free, their rebar guts exposed to the air—is damned impressive".&lt;ref name=Ohlsen /&gt;

[[File:CreamBrownCeramicsHidalgo.jpg|thumb|Contemporary pottery by Nicolas Vita Hernandez of Chililco, Huejutla de Reyes, in the [[Hidalgo (state)|State of Hidalgo]], Mexico, at a temporary exhibit on Hidalgo crafts at the [[Museo de Arte Popular]], [[Mexico City]].]]
'''Ceramics in Mexico''' date back thousands of years before the [[Pre-Columbian]] period, when [[ceramic art]]s and [[pottery]] crafts developed with the first advanced civilizations and cultures of [[Mesoamerica]].  With one exception, pre-Hispanic wares were not glazed, but rather [[Burnishing (pottery)|burnish]]ed and painted with colored [[slip (ceramics)|fine clay slips]]. The [[potter's wheel]] was unknown as well; pieces were shaped by molding, coiling and other methods.

After the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Spanish Invasion and Conquest]], European techniques and designs were introduced, nearly wiping out the native traditions. Indigenous traditions survive in a few pottery items such as [[Comal (cookware)|comal]]s, and the addition of indigenous design elements into mostly European motifs. Today, ceramics are still produced from traditional items such as dishes, kitchen utensils to new items such as sculptures and [[Mexican handcrafts and folk art|folk art]]. Despite the fame of the prior, the bulk of ceramic items produced in the country are floor and wall tiles along with bathroom fixtures. Mexico has a number of well-known artisan ceramic traditions, most of which are in the center and south of the country. Examples are the [[Talavera (pottery)|Talavera]] of [[Puebla]], the [[Maiolica|majolica]] of [[Guanajuato]], the various wares of the [[Guadalajara, Mexico|Guadalajara]] area, and [[barro negro pottery|barro negro]] of Oaxaca. A more recent addition is the production of [[Mata Ortiz pottery|Mata Ortiz or Pakimé]] wares in [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]]. While the number of artisans has been dropping due to competition from mass-produced items, the production of folk art and fine ware still has an important role in the [[Economy of Mexico|Mexican economy]] and the production of pottery in general is still important to [[culture of Mexico|Mexican culture]].

==History==
{{see also|Western Mexico shaft tomb tradition}}
[[File:CeramicsDisplay12Anahuacalli.JPG|thumb|Pre-Hispanic ceramic vessel on display at the [[Anahuacalli Museum]] in Mexico City]]
The making of earthenware began to replace stone utensils in Mexico began around the Purrón period (2300-1500 BCE). Many of these first ceramics were [[gourd]] or squash shaped, a carry over from when these vegetables were used to carry liquids.&lt;ref name="welles5"&gt;Hopkins and Muller 5&lt;/ref&gt; This earthenware developed into a pottery tradition that mostly used clay thinly coated with a fine clay slip. Most clays in Mexico need [[Temper (archaeology)|temper]] to regulate water absorption, with one significant exception being the clay used in the Fine Orangeware of the [[Gulf Coast of Mexico|Gulf Coast]].&lt;ref name="welles6"&gt;Hopkins and Muller 6&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:CarlomagnoWorkshop20.JPG|thumb|left|Example of a "proto" potters wheel at the [[Carlomagno Pedro Martinez]] workshop in [[San Bartolo Coyotepec]], [[Oaxaca]] ]]
Pre-Hispanic vessels were shaped by modeling, coiling or molding. Except for a proto wheel used by the [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotecs]], the potter's wheel was unknown until the Spanish Conquest. Simple [[pinch pot]]s or [[coiling (pottery)|coiled pots]] were usually made by the family, with larger molded pieces made by craftsmen.&lt;ref name="welles7"&gt;Hopkins and Muller 7&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest molded pieces were simply clay pressed against a pre-existing bowl, but double molds and slip casting came to be used to make bowls with relief decorations. Famous examples of this type exist in [[Tlaxcala]] and Puebla states.&lt;ref name="welles5353"&gt;Hopkins and Muller 53&lt;/ref&gt; Many figurines were also made using molds. Sometimes vessels were made with several molded pieces with the upper part finished by coiling.&lt;ref name="welles5353"/&gt;

With one exception, pre-Hispanic pieces were not [[ceramic glaze|glazed]], but rather the finish was made with a slip made of extremely fine clay. This slip often had mineral pigments added for color, which could be added before and/or after firing.&lt;ref name="welles910"&gt;Hopkins and Muller 9–10&lt;/ref&gt; Firing was done in an open fire or in a pit. Figurines were often done in the family hearth. Pots were fired in a heap placed on the ground or in a pit and covered with wood.&lt;ref name="welles5353"/&gt; The use of this method for firing most often led to incompletely fired pots, with the notable exception of Fine Orangeware.&lt;ref name="welles5353"/&gt;

The only glazed ware from Mesoamerica is called Plumbate. It was glazed with a fine slip mixed with lead and fired by a special technique. It was produced only for a short time and its appearance marks the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Early Post Classic period]] at many archeological sites.&lt;ref name="welles12"&gt;Hopkins and Muller 12&lt;/ref&gt;

There are over thirty known methods to have been used decorate pre-Hispanic pottery including pressing designs into the clay with textiles, use of rocker stamps, or pressing items such as shells and the use of pointed sticks. Various manners of putting and preserving colors both during and after firing were also employed.&lt;ref name="welles13"&gt;Hopkins and Muller 13&lt;/ref&gt; Designs generally fall into four categories: geometric, realistic or naturalistic (generally stylized animals and people), symbolic and pictographic. Most designs are related to designs on other crafts and on artistic works such as murals.&lt;ref name="welles13"/&gt;  All of these pottery styles and methods can still be found in modern Mexico.&lt;ref name="welles3545"&gt;Hopkins and Muller 35–45&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BluePlatePueblaMAPDF.JPG|thumb|17th or 18th century plate from Puebla]]
The Spanish Conquest introduced European traditions of pottery and had severe effects upon native traditions. Some pottery forms survived intact, such as comals, grinders ([[molcajete]]s), basic cooking bowls/utensils and [[censer]]s. This was mostly done in plain orangeware and some were colored red and black. All pre-Hispanic figurines, since they were almost always related to religion, disappeared and replaced by images of the [[Virgin Mary]], angels, [[friar]]s, soldiers, devils and European farm animals such as dogs, cattle and sheep. The major effect on production was the introduction of the potter's wheel, the enclosed [[kiln]], lead glazes and new forms such as candlesticks and olive jars. The importation of European and Asian ceramics mostly affected decoration styles of native produced wares. The impact of these was felt earliest and strongest in the central highlands on Mexico, in and around Mexico City. While some traditional pre-Hispanic style ware was still produced in the early colonial, its quality and aesthetics declined dramatically until it nearly disappeared entirely.&lt;ref name="welles4849"&gt;Hopkins and Muller 48–49&lt;/ref&gt;

European style ware, especially glazed ware, produced by native craftsmen, began early in the colonial period but was poorly done with only two colors, green and amber. Most decorative elements were stamped on with mixed Spanish and indigenous designs. The most common forms were jugs, pitchers and bowls, all for everyday use.&lt;ref name="welles49"&gt;Hopkins and Muller 49&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, the production of majolica glazed ware, which was expensive to import from Europe, developed and regulated by the mid-17th century. The best was being produced in Puebla, although it was being also produced in [[Mexico City]], Guadalajara, [[Aguascalientes]] and other places. These pieces were primarily had a white or cream colored background with designs painted on them in one or more colors.&lt;ref name="welles4952"&gt;Hopkins and Muller 49–52&lt;/ref&gt;  For the rest of the colonial period, indigenous styles continued to deteriorate all over New Spain, while foreign influences from Europe, Asia and the Middle East produced changes in decorations.&lt;ref name="welles5353"/&gt;  By the time of the [[Mexican War of Independence]], Mexican majolica was exported throughout the [[New World]] and drove the Spanish version from the market. However, this dominance would not last long before cheaper [[Delftware]] from England and Asian wares put pressure on the industry in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="welles5455"&gt;Hopkins and Muller 54–55&lt;/ref&gt; Mexico continued to import and copy styles from France and England through the 20th century; however, there have been native innovations during the past century and a half as well.&lt;ref name="welles5556"&gt;Hopkins and Muller 55–56&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MezcaleroMEAPO.JPG|thumb|Barro negro [[cantaro]] jug at the Museo Estatal de Arte Popular de Oaxaca]]
Most pottery produced in central Mexico is fired at low temperatures (low-fire) and covered with a glaze made with [[lead]] and other minerals.&lt;ref name="welles123"&gt;Hopkins and Muller 123&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="concern"&gt;{{cite news |title= Lead in Mexican Products Raises Concern |newspaper=New York Times  |date=Sep 19, 2000 |page=14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because lead will fuse and produce a shine at a firing temperature of less than 800C, while alternatives require temperatures twice as high.&lt;ref name="cleanplate"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Anonymous |date=February 21, 2009 |title= The Americas: A clean plate; Mexico's ceramics industry |journal=The Economist |location=London |volume=390 |issue=8619 |pages=42 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of lead in these wares has produced health warning in both Mexico and the United States,&lt;ref name="concern"/&gt; with the risks being known as early as the late 19th century. Lead from the glaze tends to leach into foods after repeated use. Use of this type of ware has been linked to elevated blood levels in children in Mexico City, [[Oaxaca]] and other places and severely high levels in children of potters. The lead content is highest in Oaxacan pottery.&lt;ref name="azcona"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Azcona-Cruz |first=Maria Isabel |author2=Stephen J Rothenberg |author3=Lourdes Schnaas |author4=Jose S Zamora-Munoz |author5=Manuel Romero-PLaceres  |date=May–June 2000 |title= Lead-glazed ceramic ware and blood lead levels of children in the City of Oaxaca, Mexico |journal=Archives of Environmental Health |volume=55 |issue=3 |pages=217–223 |location=Washington, D.C. |doi= 10.1080/00039890009603409 |pmid=10908106}}&lt;/ref&gt; This lead content has blocked most rurally produced ceramics from the United States market, where they could fetch much higher prices.&lt;ref name="cleanplate"/&gt;

In the 1990s, [[FONART]], a government entity that promotes handcrafts and several [[non-governmental organization]]s worked to produce an alternative lead-free glaze what works with low-fire ceramics. This glaze is based on [[boron]]. They have also worked to get artisans to install $40USD fans in their kilns to make combustion more efficient. This has allowed a significant portion of low-fire ceramics to be stamped "lead free" and allows them to be exported.&lt;ref name="welles123"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cleanplate"/&gt;

However, researchers have found lead content in wares stamped "sin plomo" (without lead).&lt;ref name="concern"/&gt; Even though the boron glaze costs less than the traditional lead glaze, many potters refused to change tradition. In all, only half of Mexico's potters have switched.&lt;ref name="cleanplate"/&gt; In some places the problem is the lack of information about the glazes and in some places, artisans claim that they need government financial support, especially for options that warrant a gas-fired kiln. Another problem is that many do not trust the government and ignore warnings.&lt;ref name="oficio"&gt;{{cite news |title= Alfareria un oficio que mina la vida |first= Ivan |last=Rendon |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=September 6, 1999 |page=26 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Pottery making is a called with mines life}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pottery production==
[[File:PottersTexcoco.JPG|thumb|left|Potters at work at the crafts section of the Feria de Texcoco]]
[[File:Demostración barro 15.JPG|thumb|Mixing of cat-tail fluff, used as temper, into clay in Morelos]]
Ceramics is the most practiced craft in Mexico. Shapes and function of the pieces vary from simple flat comals, used for making tortillas to elaborate sculptures called [[Tree of Life (craft)|Trees of Life]].&lt;ref name="giordano"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/4024-Manos-mexicanas |title=Manos mexicanas |first=Carlos |last=Romero Giordano |date=September 1997 |publisher=Mexico Desconocido magazine |location=Magazine |language=Spanish |trans-title=Mexican Hands |accessdate=May 2, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427065129/http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/4024-Manos-mexicanas |archivedate=April 27, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The most basic forms, such as comals, cazuelas (a type of stew pot), simple bowls and other cooking and storage ware are still based on native designs and forms. Decorative ceramics and figures are almost completely dominated by European traditions, especially in central Mexico. In some cases, there is a blending of traditions, mostly in decorative designs where indigenous elements are combined with European elements.&lt;ref name="welles57"&gt;Hopkins and Muller 57&lt;/ref&gt;

A relatively new tradition in ceramics is called "folk art". These pieces are mostly decorative, such as figures, tiles; and fine wares such as casseroles, teacups, and dishes. These are produced for the Mexican upper class, the international market, and to some extent, tourists. Folk art production is encouraged by government at all levels, with a large number of artisans now signing at least their best pieces. While this segment of the market keeps ties with the past, it is also sensitive to fashion trends as well. This leads to experimentation with new decorative elements and the disappearance of those that do not sell.&lt;ref name="welles59"&gt;Hopkins and Muller 59&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Elaboración del barro negro27 inakiherrasti.JPG|thumb|Making of a [[barro negro pottery]] piece in San Bartolo Coyotepec, Oaxaca]]
Imperfections in pieces are less tolerated in local Mexican markets than in some foreign markets. The reason for this is that mechanized production of near perfect copies is still a relatively new phenomenon, so the imperfections that show something was made by hand do not have the "charm" they might in more industrialized countries.&lt;ref name="welles62"&gt;Hopkins and Muller 62&lt;/ref&gt;

Most potters work in family workshops, with everyone participating in the process. Pottery making families tend to be secretive about their practices and rarely cooperate with anyone outside the family for any aspect of the pottery making process. Superstition may surround the process, especially firing, with potters taking care to avoid "the evil eye" of neighbors and building small shrines and performing Christian and indigenous blessings. Both men and women mold pieces, but men generally do the largest pieces (due to weight) and do the firing. Children begin to work with clay when they are about six, molding decorative elements. They usually begin molding pieces when they are about fourteen, mastering it by about eighteen. The male head of a family workshop is often of retirement age, whose primary purpose is instruction and supervision. However, many of these workshops are disappearing as elders stop working entirely and children seek other, more profitable careers.&lt;ref name="welles6062"&gt;Hopkins and Muller 60–62&lt;/ref&gt;

Mexican potters generally use local clays, digging it up themselves or paying someone to bring it by donkey or truck. The kind of temper used varies on location, from [[cattail]] fluff in [[Metepec, State of Mexico|Metepec]], to sand in [[Acatlán de Osorio|Acatlán]] or [[Ceiba pentandra|kapok]] in Ameyaltepec to give the clay the right consistency and it keep the final product from cracking. In some cases [[feldspar]] is used. The clay comes in chunks, which must be dried and then crushed, using a rolling stone or [[flail]]. Some potters in Metepec put the chunks on the street in front of their house and let the cars drive over them. Another way to remove impurities and use the finest is to disperse the clay in water, with impurities and rougher sediment falling to the bottom.&lt;ref name="welles6869"&gt;Hopkins and Muller 68–69&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:DRosaHorno5.JPG|thumb|Looking into the kiln used at the Doña Rosa workshop in San Bartolo Coyotepec, Oaxaca]]

All of the methods used in pre-Hispanic times, along with the potter's wheel, are still used to make pieces. Coiling is usually limited to finishing a piece that has first been pressed into a mold. Molding is the most common way of forming enclosed vessels. Most of these molds are concave or convex, with the clay pressed against the inside or outside of the mold. Sometimes liquid clay is poured into plaster molds. Potters wheels are most commonly used in some workshops, and often to rapidly make a succession of small vessels. Their use is more common in Guanajuato and Jalisco than other parts of the country. In many places, the wheel is powered by foot, using a kickwheel, rather than by electricity. Hand turned wheels are also used. In Oaxaca, a type of proto-wheel has been used by the Zapotecs since pre-Hispanic times. This is a saucer balanced over an inverted saucer that is turned to help shape the piece. It is most often used for the barro negro pottery made in [[San Bartolo Coyotepec]].&lt;ref name="welles7071"&gt;Hopkins and Muller 70–71&lt;/ref&gt;

Both glazed and burnished pieces are made in modern Mexico, with both leaded and nonleaded glazes used. If the piece is to be burnished, it is usually covered in a slip, then polished with a stone or a piece of metal. Both indigenous and European pottery traditions employ decoration, which can vary from simple color changes to elaborate images and designs painted on and/or pressed into the piece. Coloring agents used to be made by the potters themselves, but today most use purchased chemicals.&lt;ref name="welles8182"&gt;Hopkins and Muller 81–82&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, pieces have been fired in wood-fueled kilns or simple in a pile with wood. This is low-fire method as the temperatures achieved do not exceed 800&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="concern"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cleanplate"/&gt; Better wood kilns and gas kilns can reach temperatures of between 900 and 1000C, which is not quite yet high-fire, but allows the use of more types of low lead or lead free glazes.  Another reason for the higher temperatures is that wood is becoming scarce in parts of Mexico and gas kilns easily achieve these temperatures, which produce better pieces.&lt;ref name="welles118120"&gt;Hopkins and Muller 118–120&lt;/ref&gt;

Bodies requiring higher firing temperatures, such as [[stoneware]] were introduced in the late 1950s even though it had existed elsewhere for centuries. These wares are considered to be much finer than what can be achieved at lower temperatures. A pioneer in the making of stoneware in Mexico is [[Jorge Wilmot]], who began with [[Ken Edwards (potter)|Ken Edwards]] in the 1950s and 1960s. Later, a group in Mexico City began to experiment with stoneware, calling themselves Cono 10. While the group no longer exists, their work, both as a group and later as individuals has had a significant effect in the development of stoneware in Mexico. Ceramics fired at higher temperatures came to the interest of the government, especially FONART, in the 1970s. This agency installed suitable facilities in various parts of the country and trained potters in the techniques. Many of these later started their own workshops. Stoneware is still relatively rare and unlike other forms of pottery, it is usually made by professionals with education rather than people in rural areas. Some of the best known stoneware workshops include those of Hugo Velazquez in [[Cuernavaca]], Taller Tecpatl in [[Guanajuato, Guanajuato|Guanajuato]], Alberto Diaz de Cossio, Graziella Diaz de Leon and Francisco Javier Servin M., all of Mexico City.&lt;ref name="welles118-121"&gt;Hopkins and Muller 118–121&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major pottery traditions in Mexico==

===Oaxaca===
[[File:GreenJarMEAPO.JPG|thumb|Example of the green glazed ware of Santa María Atzompa]]
In many parts of Oaxaca state, both functional and decorative pottery and ceramic pieces are produced. Most potters live in the central valleys region of Oaxaca, where some of the best known traditions are. The most traditional potters live in small rural villages such as [[San Marcos Tlapazola]] and [[Vista Hermosa Tonaltepec]]. The latter is a Zapotec village of about a dozen families, who make very simple, yet light, earth colored cookware and utensils. Most of this pottery is sold to other local villages, but a small regional and international market for this type of pottery has appeared as well.&lt;ref name="avazquez"&gt;{{cite news |title= Women in Oaxaca, Mexico, Find Strength through Pottery |first=A. |last=Vazquez |author2= Dai Huynh |newspaper=Knight Ridder Tribune Business New |location= Washington, D.C. |date=December 2, 2002 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many Oaxacan villages, like San Marcos Tlapazola, are nearly devoid of working age men, as most have left to work in the United States. Many of the women have begun to make pottery to supplement what their husbands send. Much of the work is sold in the larger towns or cities either by the potters individually or together as a cooperative. The cooperative at Tlapazola sells and exhibits their ware in markets and contests in various parts of Mexico. Most clay is from a local source and generally that source is kept secret.&lt;ref name="burnham"&gt;{{cite news |title= Zapotec Women Commute from Mexico to Los Angeles, Making Art Their Business |first= Philip  |last=Burnham |newspaper=Knight Ridder Tribune Business News |date=May 12, 2004 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite their price, as low as thirty pesos for a pot, much of traditional indigenous cookware is being replaced by mass-produced pots and pans in the rural areas. Fewer young people are taking up the trade, mostly because many want to live in the city. Much of pottery making in Oaxaca has switched from functional ware to decorative wares that appeal to foreign markets and tourists.&lt;ref name="avazquez"/&gt;

Some Oaxacan artisans draw on the native use of bright colors and [[magic realism]] present in modern works such as those by [[Rufino Tamayo]] and [[Francisco Toledo]]. Others show a world view that mixes native beliefs and traditions with the Catholic faith. Most potters cannot compete with cheap, mass-produced items so many have turned to upper scale folk art and one-of-a-kind pieces. Others have been inspired to look at their own ancient cultures and use them to help create sellable works. Cooperatives such as these have attracted the attention of Japanese ceramists and billionaire financier [[Alfredo Harp Helú]], who have provided seed money, business advice and outlets to show their wares internationally. Despite this, becoming profitable is still not easy.&lt;ref name="mandel"&gt;{{cite news |title= How pottery is putting people back into Mexico's ghost towns: Andrea Mandel-Campbell on a project giving young women a reason not to head for the US; [London edition] |first= Andrea |last= Mandel-Campbell |newspaper=Financial Times |date=Jan 19, 2002 |page=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Zapotec potters still use the "Zapotec wheel" to give shape to their pieces. It is not a potter's wheel per se. It is a disc or plate balanced over another inverted one. The piece is given its basic shape by coiling or molding and then it is finished while turned on the disc. The disc with the vessel in progress is turned only with the hands, which requires a certain amount of balance and skill.&lt;ref name="avazquez"/&gt;

One common way to decorate the simplest of ceramic pieces in Oaxaca is called "chorreada" (runny). The pieces are first fired with a clear glaze. Then a second glaze with oxides for color are dabbed on and allowed to run where it may.&lt;ref name="avazquez"/&gt;&lt;ref name="welles97"&gt;Hopkins and Muller 97&lt;/ref&gt; This double glazing is similar to the production of 19th century Majolica, a pottery form more prominent in central Mexico.&lt;ref name="welles97"/&gt;  The use of raised images on clay items has also been adapted to more traditional vessels, often with the image colored differently from the background.&lt;ref name="welles96"&gt;Hopkins and Muller 96&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, a potter named Doña Rosa devised a way to put a black metallic like sheen onto the pottery by polishing it. This look has made the pottery far more popular.&lt;ref name="once"&gt;{{cite news |title= El proceso de elaboración de artesanías de barro negro de Oaxaca |url= http://oncetv-ipn.net/noticias/index.php?modulo=despliegue&amp;dt_fecha=2007-10-08&amp;numnota=46 |agency= Redacción Once Noticias |newspaper=Once Noticias |location=Mexico City |date=2007-10-08 |accessdate=2010-03-08 |language=Spanish |trans-title=The process of crafting barro negro crafts of Oaxaca}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aboy"&gt;{{cite news |title= El arte y la magia de Dona Rosa |first=Alicia |last=Boy |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date= 2000-08-27 |page=2 |language=Spanish |trans-title=The arte and magic of Doña Rosa}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the Doña Rosa's techniques and designs are now widely copied in Oaxaca, the original workshop still exists, with her son Valente Nieto Real still making pieces at seventy years of age.&lt;ref name="giordano"/&gt;  From the 1980s to the present, an artisan named [[Carlomagno Pedro Martinez]] has promoted items made this way with barro negro sculptures, which have been exhibited in a number of countries.&lt;ref name="hermano"&gt;{{cite news|title=En vida Hermano En Vida Carlomagno Pedro Martinez |first=Luis |last=Soria Castillo |url=http://www.imparcialenlinea.com/index.php?mod=leer&amp;id=112416&amp;sec=capital&amp;titulo=EN_VIDA_HERMANO_EN_VIDA_CARLOMAGNO_PEDRO_MART%CDNEZ |newspaper=El Imparcial |location=Oaxaca |date=2010-02-13 |accessdate=2010-03-08 |language=Spanish }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The town of [[Santa María Atzompa]] is known for its jade green-glazed pottery, which has been made the same way for generations. The color comes from the [[lead monoxide]] glaze that is applied to it.&lt;ref name="colorverde"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/4014-Arte-color-verde-%28Oaxaca%29 |title=Arte color verde (Oaxaca) |first=Fabiola |last=González Ramírez |date=February 1999 |publisher=Mexico Desconocido magazine |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title=Art color green |accessdate=March 18, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090722014648/http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/4014-Arte-color-verde-(Oaxaca) |archivedate=July 22, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Atzompa's pottery tradition prior to the Conquest is similar to other settlements in the area,&lt;ref name="pelota"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dti.inah.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3014&amp;Itemid=329 |title=Hallan juego de pelota |date=March 24, 2009 |publisher=[[INAH]] |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Ball court found |accessdate=March 18, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; but after the Spanish introduced glazing techniques the green variation was adopted and has changed little since. Up until the mid 20th century, the ware was popular enough to be shipped to all parts of Mexico and even to the United States. However, restrictions against lead containing pottery has since deflated this market and it is mostly sold only locally.&lt;ref name="jpreston"&gt;{{cite news |title= Santa Maria Atzompa Journal;Pots That Poison, and Potters Facing Broken Lives |first=Julia |last=Preston |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/14/world/santa-maria-atzompa-journal-pots-that-poison-and-potters-facing-broken-lives.html?pagewanted=1 |newspaper=New York Times |location= New York |date=June 14, 1996 |accessdate=March 18, 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the development and introduction of lead-free glazes,&lt;ref name="jpreston"/&gt;  Atzompa continues to have some of the highest lead content in Mexico, found both in the wares and in the potters and other people who live there.&lt;ref name="azcona"/&gt;
[[File:DueloMEAPO.JPG|thumb|"Duelo" by Angelica Vasquez Cruz of Santa Maria Atzompa]]
While the green glazed ware continues to be Atzompa's staple product, there has been some innovation in the pottery tradition here. In the 1970s, a local potter by the name of Dolores Porras gained notoriety when she went against convention and pioneered the production of multicolored glazed pottery. Porras taught herself how to paint on clay pieces, starting with red and white washes. Later she added blues, greens, grays and oranges. When she began to produce these pieces, she was considered to be crazy. However, her pieces began to sell and other potters began to imitate her work. Later on, she introduced the use of lead-free glazes. Today, her pieces are part of Atzompa's pottery traditions even though she herself is outsold by younger potters who produce cheaper and better wares.&lt;ref name="avazquez"/&gt;&lt;ref name="colorverde"/&gt;

A number of potters in Atzompa have turned to the making of clay figures. Luis Garcia Blando makes terra cotta figurines in a style his late mother developed. These figures are called "embroidered dolls" (muñecas bordadas) who are made with long skirts that reach the floor, eliminating the need to create breakable feet. They are elegantly adorned with earrings, necklaces and their dresses are decorated with elaborate floral designs.  Usually the women have two thick braids, like their creator did, and often carry a basket on the head. They are generally unpainted with almost all decorative details sculpted in clay. The style has been imitated and reinterpreted by other artisans.&lt;ref name="welles95"&gt;Hopkins and Muller 95&lt;/ref&gt;

Angelica Vasquez Cruz is known for her figures of women, mermaids and angels. Vasquez is a single mother who raised four children, making money and a name by the making of these figures. She has won numerous awards for her intense and intricate work. Her clay images are almost always focused on a strong female figure. The large pieces are "Byzantine" like, shaped like a Christmas tree and decorated with tiers of thumbnail miniatures. Each piece is unique and can take months to make. The colors are produced by mineral pigments from local rocks. The pieces are bought by collectors, who pay $US175 to 800 per piece in galleries. The pieces cost about half that in her workshop.&lt;ref name="avazquez"/&gt;

In [[Ocotlán de Morelos]], the best known pottery family is headed by the Aguilar sisters. The dynasty began with their mother, potter Isaura Alcantara Diaz. Isaura learned the traditional pottery making techniques of the Oaxaca Valley, which was mostly limited to making utilitarian items. She began to experiment with figures and more decorative pieces, with some of her pieces making their way into the Rockefeller collection, but unfortunately she died prematurely at the age of 44. Before she died, she taught potting to her children [[Josefina Aguilar|Josefina]], Guillermina, Irene, Concepción and Jesús. Due to their mother's death, the children began working early, with Josefina being only seven. Poverty prevented the children from attending school. Like their mother, they began and mostly made pots and other kitchen utensils but they also worked to develop clay figures.&lt;ref name="lcastillo"&gt;{{cite news |title=En vida, hermano, en vida – "Josefina Aguilar" |first=Luis |last=Soria Castillo |url=http://www.imparcialenlinea.com/getPrint.php?id=78540 |newspaper=El Imparcial |location=Oaxaca |date=March 28, 2009 |accessdate=April 8, 2010 |language=Spanish |trans-title=In life, brother, in life – "Josefina Aguilar" |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713022417/http://www.imparcialenlinea.com/getPrint.php?id=78540 |archivedate=July 13, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, these siblings became renowned for their fanciful painted clay figures that celebrate everyday life.&lt;ref name="avazquez"/&gt; Today, these siblings still work and much of the third generation are craftsmen as well. Some, such as Demetrio Garcia Aguilar, are making a name for themselves as well.&lt;ref name="lcastillo"/&gt;

Outside of the central valleys, the city of [[Tehuantepec]] also as a significant pottery tradition. The most distinctive aspect are the figures of women, which average about a meter tall and have on their heads a shallow pan of sand to set a water storage jar. Miniature figures based on these are similar in design but are often painted in accents of white and gold. These are called "tanguyus" and are created to be given as gifts to mark the end of the year.&lt;ref name="welles97"/&gt;

===Jalisco===
{{main|Ceramics of Jalisco}}
[[File:MuseoNacionalCeramicaTonala42.JPG|thumb|Large ceramic container at the Museo Nacional de la Cerámica in Tonalá, Jalisco]]
A wide variety of traditional low temperature and higher temperature firing techniques are used in the Guadalajara area, to produce ware from cheap objects to artistic productions. The two main pottery producing municipalities are [[Tonalá, Jalisco|Tonalá]] and [[Tlaquepaque]].&lt;ref name="welles99"&gt;Hopkins and Muller 99&lt;/ref&gt; These two municipalities produce several different types of pottery and ceramics, principally "bruñido", "bandera", "canelo", "petate", "betus" and high-fire/stoneware. The best known of these styles is bruñido, which translates to burnished. It probably descends from polychrome produced in this area en the 19th century. The name comes from the fact that these pieces are not glazed, but rather they are given a slip and then polished with a stone or pyrite. Many of these pieces are slender necked jugs or lamp bases, often decorated with animals, such as rabbits, with distorted characteristics, giving them a surreal look. The pieces are usually painted with delicate tones of rose, gray-blue and white on a background of a light coffee color, light gray and sometimes green or blue. Each piece is individually created. The attraction of this pottery is its appearance, as it is too porous to hold any liquid or food. One exception to this are thick large tubs mainly to store water or for bathing. Water stored in this kind of vessel takes on a flavor from the pottery, which is desired by some people. Another exception is a water container with a fat body and long neck, with a ceramic cup placed upside down over the neck. These are called botellones, and are similar to carafes. One town that specializes in these is El Rosario, near Tonalá.&lt;ref name="ecassin"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/1293-uncovering-tonala-s-history-at-the-national-ceramic-museum |title= Uncovering Tonala's history at the National Ceramic Museum |first=Erin |last=Cassiin |date= February 1, 2006 |publisher=MexConnect |accessdate=May 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="welles100102"&gt;Hopkins and Muller 100–102&lt;/ref&gt;

Bandera, which means "flag" in Spanish, is so named because it has the green-red-and-white colors of the [[Flag of Mexico|Mexican flag]].&lt;ref name="palisau"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Alisau |first=Patricia |date=March 2004 |title= On Guadalajara's Outskirts |journal=Business Mexico |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=44–47 |location=Mexico City }}&lt;/ref&gt; Red is commonly used as the background color, while the green and white are used for the decorative details.&lt;ref name="ecassin"/&gt; It is also an unglazed burnished ware. For unknown reasons, this style of pottery is very rare.&lt;ref name="welles101"&gt;Hopkins and Muller 101&lt;/ref&gt;

Petatillo pieces are distinguished by tightly drawn lines or crosshatching in a red background. These lines are named after straw mats called [[petate]]s, which they resemble.&lt;ref name="ecassin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="palisau"/&gt; Above the lines are drawn stylized images of plants and animals, especially deer, rabbits, eagles, roosters and swans. Often the main figures are banded in black and spare use of green completes the set. This ware is painted before firing, glazed, and then fired again. It is very labor-intensive and rare, and is mostly used on platters. A giant [[urn]] in this style can take up to three years to complete.&lt;ref name="palisau"/&gt;&lt;ref name="welles9899"&gt;Hopkins and Muller 98–99&lt;/ref&gt;

Canelo is named after the color of the fired pottery, which is various shades of [[cinnamon]] (canela in Spanish). It is popular and used mainly for water jugs because it is good for keeping liquid cool.&lt;ref name="ecassin"/&gt;

Betus pottery is characterized by vibrant colors that give the ceramics a whimsical look. This style derives its name from the betus oil the clayware is immersed in before it is fired. The oil, which is made of a resin extracted from pine trees, gives the painted pottery a brilliant sheen.&lt;ref name="ecassin"/&gt;

One uncommon ware is called engregado. These objects have a special varnish that make them useful for cooking, the varnish acting like a coating of Teflon that prevents food from slicking when heated.&lt;ref name="palisau"/&gt;

High fire wares like alta clay and stoneware were introduced to the area by American Ken Edwards and Mexican Jorge Wilmot starting in the 1960s. These are fired at over 1,100C, causing the clay to vitrify and form a nonporous surface. The first stoneware kiln was installed in Tonala and spread from there.&lt;ref name="ecassin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="palisau"/&gt;
[[File:PlatesFishMAPDF.JPG|thumb|Stoneware plates with fish from Jalisco]]
Stoneware is produced by El Palomar and some other factories in Tlaquepaque. Another high-fire ware is of the white [[kaolin]] type by factories such as Loza Fina and Cerámica Contemporánea Suro.&lt;ref name="welles99"/&gt;  The latter is a family run operation that caters to chefs, designers, architects, and artists. The workshop primarily make dishes in all shapes and sizes, but items such as lamps and decorative pieces as well. The pieces are generally made to order based on designs preapproved by the client. Orders range in size for a setting for four to the entire dish set for restaurants. Many of their clients buy wares in bulk although there is no minimum.&lt;ref name="fuegolento"&gt;{{cite news |title= A fuego lento |first= Areli |last=Avila |newspaper=Mural |location=Guadalajara, Mexico |date=July 4, 2008 |page=4 |language=Spanish |trans-title=A slow fire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 2,000 artisans such as Jose Garcia Quinones in Tlaquepaque preserve the tradition of making [[nativity scene]]s and other figures from clay. These nativity scenes can be whimsical with non-tradition animals such as lions and giraffe and even the [[Devil]] can appear. Garcia Quinones has won prizes for his work since he was a boy and each year for thirty year has sold his wars at the annual Christmas Bazaar at the Deportivo Venustiano Carranza sports facility. Like other potters, the pieces are made at a home workshop with all members of the family contributing to the creation. Another potter, Justino Estuvier, over 70 years old, exports his finely crafted wares to Spain. However, this aspect of the ceramics industry is fading in the municipality with far fewer potters than there used to be. Common artisans here battle to survive against the proliferation of plastic and cheaper ceramics from Asia. The average handcrafted nativity scene sells in Mexico for 350 pesos, when cheaper mass-produced ones sell for 160.&lt;ref name="msevilla"&gt;{{cite news |title= Preservan en barro la tradicion |first= Maria Eugenia |last=Sevilla |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=December 20, 2002 |page=4 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Preserveing tradition in clay}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:VaseNahualsMAPDF.JPG|thumb|Stoneware vase with nahuals from Jalisco]]
Tlaquepaque hosts the Museo del Premio Nacional de la Ceramica Pantalen Panduro (Pantalen Panduro National Ceramics Prize Museum), which exhibits the prizewinners of the annual national prize given to ceramics makers. It is located in the Centro Cultural El Refugio and was created in 1997. The first annual Premio Nacional was awarded in 1977. Today there are prizes for various categories but the most sought after is the Galardon Presidencial (Presidential Recognition), which is signed by the president of Mexico. Twenty one of the pieces that have won this award are located in the museum.&lt;ref name="cduran"&gt;{{cite news |title= Un lugar para la ceramica |first= Cecilia |last=Duran |newspaper=Mural |location=Guadalajara, Mexico |date=December 26, 2003 |page=4 |language=Spanish |trans-title=A place for ceramics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tonalá has long been recognized as a center for ceramics in Mexico. The streets are filled with artisan workshops and sidewalks stalls selling pottery and stoneware pieces.&lt;ref name="ecassin"/&gt; One thing that distinguishes Tonalá made ware is the decorative details. Two elements, the [[nagual|nahual]] and the "flor de Tonalá" are common. A nahual is a pre-Hispanic shape shifter or shaman, often drawn as a smiling cat. The flor de Tonalá (Tonalá flower) first appeared in pottery design in the early 20th century. Its distinctive shape is an oval center with rounded petals that form a scalloped design.  These elements can appear in all of the types of pottery that is produced here.&lt;ref name="ecassin"/&gt; Market days, Thursday and Sunday, are a good chance to see a wide variety of ceramics of the region, all spread out on the streets of the downtown. While there are a wide variety of figures, utensils and decorative items, it is not all that is produced. Many Many manufacturers sell their wares through other channels. To find the best pieces, one needs to visit the workshops and factories.&lt;ref name="welles99"/&gt;

One noted potter from Tonalá is Jorge Wilmont. While his background is in the Tonalá tradition, he has been in the forefront of innovation of the craft. So many of his innovations have been adopted by so many potters in the area that just about anything that departs from tradition shows Wilmot's influence.  Today, Wilmot lives in [[San Pablo del Monte]] in [[Tlaxcala]], where he advises potters from there and the neighboring state of Puebla.&lt;ref name="welles101102"&gt;Hopkins and Muller 101–102&lt;/ref&gt;

The municipality is home to the Museo Nacional de la Cerámica (National Ceramic Museum), which director Prudencio Guzman Rodriguez considers to be a "link between Tonalá's tradition and people interested in researching our tradition". Established in 1986, the museum has a collection of 1000 pieces that range from pre-Hispanic artifacts to contemporary prizewinners. The institution was begun when a board of local artisans and businessmen with sculptors Jorge Wilmot and Ken Edwards to find a way to promote the ceramic tradition here. Many of the artifacts are on loan from the Instituto Nacional Indigenista (National Indigenous Institute), and a number were donated by Wilmot. The rest of the pieces are prizewinners from the Certamen Estatal de la Cerámica (State Ceramic Contest). Unfortunately by the mid 1990s, the museum has to close due to lack of funds and maintenance. The municipality stepped in and the museum was reopened in 1996. The collection contains pieces created by some of the most renowned artisans of the area and are of the styles most typical to Tonalá such as bruñido, bandera, petatillo and canelo. Artists and artisans represented include Salvador Vásquez, Juan Antonio Mateo, Gerónimo Ramos, [[Nicasio Pajarito Gonzalez|Nicasio Pajarito]],  Candelario Medrano, [[Jorge Wilmot]] and Ken Edwards.&lt;ref name="ecassin"/&gt;

Another popular liquid container in the Tonala area is the tinaja, a squat jug with a handle at the top and a small spout.&lt;ref name="welles102"&gt;Hopkins and Muller 102&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Santa Cruz de la Huerta]], near Tonala, specializes in clay drainpipes, some crudely fashioned toys and whistles in the shape of animals.  Most of these products are sold in public markets. One exception to this is the work of Candelario Medrano, who makes curious, sometimes grotesque sculptures. In his workshop can be found double decked boats, church buildings with miniature people, and animals such as lions, roosters and owls with savage human faces. They tend to be large pieces, made partly by mold and partly by hand, then painted in bright, clashing acrylics.&lt;ref name="welles102"/&gt;

===Guanajuato===
[[File:MayolicaMuralMAPDF.JPG|thumb|Mural done with Mayolica tiles entitled Arbol genealógico del comienzo del mestizaje (Genealogy tree of the beginning of the mestizo) by Gorky Gonzales Quiñones at the Museum of Artes Populares in Mexico City]]
Shortly after the Conquest, European style pottery came to dominate the area now known as the state of Guanajuato. During the colonial period, the city of Guanajuato had a strong Majolica tradition along with Puebla, which is being revived. These pieces are made with a tortilla mold for irregular shapes or by wheel. It is given an underglaze, usually a light cream color, fired, then painted with a design, glazed and fired again. Many of the motifs are made with colors such as yellow, blue-green, rust and blue. Principle makers in Guanajuato city are Gorky Gonzalez, who maintains traditional designs, and the Alfarería Capelo Mayolica, which produces large pieces with more intense and darker colors. In [[Santa Rosa de Lima, Guanajuato|Santa Rosa de Lima]], a group of former students of Capelo also make majolica.&lt;ref name="welles103104"&gt;Hopkins and Muller  103–104&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="diazmunoz"&gt;{{cite news |title= Encuentros con Mexico / Ceramica al estilo Guanajuato |first=Ricardo |last=Diazmunoz |author2=Maryell Ortiz de Zarate |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=November 6, 2005 |page=23 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Encounters with Mexico/Ceramics Guanajuato style}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major producer outside of the capital is Alfarería Aguilera Mayolica Santa Rosa in Mineral de Santa Rosa, near [[Dolores Hidalgo]]. The designs of this workshop show indigenous influences, as well as some Italian and Chinese. Alfarería Aguilera is a family operation, run by several generations of the Aguilera family.&lt;ref name="diazmunoz"/&gt; Smaller workshops in this town produce both traditional and innovative designs for tableware, flower vases, and tile. One notable workshop is that of Juan Guerrero, who makes tableware with dramatic flowers of orange, yellow, and blue. Juan's father, Fortino, makes pottery with a plain reddish base and decorated with two tones of green glaze allowed to dribble down the sides. Some containers, such as flowerpots will have salamanders on the side. The making of majolica was introduced to Dolores Hidalgo by Father Miguel Hidalgo himself.&lt;ref name="welles104"&gt;Hopkins and Muller 104&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to majolica, two large factories turn out hand painted ceramics of the kaolin type. These are Bram and Dosa in the city a Guanajuato and the town of [[Marfil, Guanajuato|Marfil]] respectively. Most of these designs are contemporary forms, with pastel floral motifs in a brilliant or matte finish.&lt;ref name="welles103"&gt;Hopkins and Muller 103&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[San Miguel Allende]], a kind of primitive folk pottery is sold in the town market. They are sauce dishes and bowls of a red tone with whimsical distorted animal figures in black (from copper oxide) under a poor clear glaze. These actually come from a small village outside of San Miguel.&lt;ref name="welles104"/&gt;  A similar design is found in [[Coroneo]], with the main difference being that the animal design is raised off the bottom of the vessel, which is produced by the mold. The raised design is painted black. While the features of the animals are not distorted, they are often given supernatural aspects, such as lions breathing fire.&lt;ref name="welles105"&gt;Hopkins and Muller 105&lt;/ref&gt;

===Puebla===
[[File:TalaveraTrayMAPDF.JPG|thumb|Talavera serving tray]]
Talavera pottery of Puebla, Mexico is a type of majolica ceramic, which is distinguished by a milky-white glaze.&lt;ref name="herz"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inside-mexico.com/art1.htm |title= Art and Handicrafts-Talavera Poblana  |first=May |last=Herz |publisher=Inside Mexico |accessdate=2009-11-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Authentic Talavera pottery only comes from the city of Puebla and the nearby communities of [[Atlixco]], [[Cholula, Puebla|Cholula]], and [[Tecali de Herrera|Tecali]], because of the quality of the natural clay found there and a tradition of production that dates to the 16th century.&lt;ref name="pomade"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/1061-talavera-mexico-s-earthly-legacy-from-the-city-of-angels |title=Talavera – Mexico's earthly legacy from the City Of Angels |first=Rita |last=Pomade |publisher=MexConnect |date=2006-01-01 |accessdate=2009-11-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ceramic tiles, jars and dishes can be found for sale all over the city of Puebla, and most of the historic center's colonial buildings are decorated with them.&lt;ref name="jbussey"&gt;{{cite news |title= Area around Puebla, Mexico, Home to Unique Tin-Glazed Ceramics |first=Jane |last=Bussey |newspaper=Knight Ridder Tribune Business News.  |date=Feb 22, 2004 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The process is slow and many pieces break during the process. Much of the ceramic is a bright blue on a white background, but other colors such as yellow, orange, green and purple can be used. The colors and designs reflected a mixed history with European, indigenous, Arab and Chinese influences. The craft arrived to the city soon after it was founded in the 1530s, when potters from Spain, including [[Talavera de la Reina]] established workshops.&lt;ref name="jbussey"/&gt;  Production of this ceramic became highly developed in Puebla because of the availability of fine clays and the demand for tiles from the newly established churches and [[monastery|monasteries]] in the area. The industry had grown sufficiently that by the mid-17th century, standards and [[guild]]s had been established that further improved the quality, leading Puebla into what is called the "golden age" of Talavera pottery (from 1650 to 1750).&lt;ref name="pomade"/&gt; Formally, the tradition that developed there is called ''Talavera Poblana'' to distinguish it from the similarly named Talavera pottery of Spain. It is a mixture of Chinese, Italian, Spanish and indigenous ceramic techniques.&lt;ref name="herz"/&gt; The production of tiles became very pronounced here as well, covering mostly prosperous churches and monasteries first and later over private homes, again to show socioeconomic status.&lt;ref name="welles5657"&gt;Hopkins and Muller 56–57&lt;/ref&gt;

Talavera Santa Catarina is one of the few state certified Talavera producers in Puebla. The exclusivity of the genuine article is behind much of this ceramic's success. The name "Talavera" for pottery is legally restricted to wares made in Puebla and a couple of other nearby locations. Many imitations are made in Puebla and other places but only eight workshops have state authorization to use the Talavera name. There is a definite market for those willing to  pay a premium for made-to-order pieces with authentication certificates. Most is sold overseas because the pieces fetch a much higher price. Clients can come simply to order an entire set of dishes or tiles to put on buildings back to their home countries.&lt;ref name="jbussey"/&gt;
[[File:CasaAzulejosDF.JPG|thumb|House covered in Puebla tile]]
A less expensive pottery made in Puebla is called Barrio de la Luz. Pieces of this type usually consist of cooking vessels, jars with lids, pitchers and others meant for ordinary kitchen use.  It is yellow brown in tone with raised ornaments such as leaves or roses, which are usually given a transparent glaze while other parts receive a black glaze.&lt;ref name="welles106"&gt;Hopkins and Muller 106&lt;/ref&gt;
In the northern part of Puebla state, most notably in the municipalities of [[Aquixtla (municipality)|Aquixtla]] and [[Chignahuapan (municipality)|Chignahuapan]], [[Nahuatl]]-speaking indigenous peoples produce cooking utensils such as comals, pitchers, pots and more with a glazed finish. They use a Moorish kiln, which conserves fuel and heat. The distinguishing feature of this pottery is that it has stamped designs, usually flowers. These stamps are cut clay tablets, which are impressed onto the pottery pieces.&lt;ref name="welles107"&gt;Hopkins and Muller 107&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Izúcar de Matamoros]] specializes in "trees of life", sometimes called "candelabras". These are multibranched clay sculptures, which can have themes for different festivities such as [[Day of the Dead]] or Christmas. The branches are filled with flowers, leaves and imagery related to the theme. In addition, figures for Day of the Dead, such as skeletons, dressed as a [[charro]] or as an upper class lady ([[La Calavera Catrina]]). All of these decorative pieces are painted in bright colors. One exception to this is the works of Heriberto Castillo, who uses more subtle colors with a glazed finish. Alfonso Castillo distinguishes his pieces by using paints made with natural ingredients.&lt;ref name="welles107"/&gt;

Another Puebla town that makes tree of life figures is Acatlán, located near the Oaxaca border. The branches often spring from the back of a bird or other animal. Other wares include realistic looking animals such as birds, iguanas or crabs with a place for a candle on their backs and flat-backed planters to hang on walls. These can be produced as either painted ware or as burnished ware, which is done in shades of red and black. One potter known for his burnished work is Herón Martinez.&lt;ref name="welles107"/&gt;

===Michoacán===
[[File:CraftsSFtztztz.JPG|thumb|Pottery and other crafts for sale in Tzintzuntzan, Michoacán]]
Most of the pottery of note in the state of [[Michoacán]] comes from the [[Lake Pátzcuaro]] area. One town notable for its pottery is [[Tzintzuntzan, Michoacán|Tzintzuntzan]], which produces a wide variety of pottery in home-based workshops. Most of these wares are sold to tourists. Much of the tableware produced is glazed. They are often decorated with the outlines of fish or water birds.  Green glaze usually covers the interior and lip of the vessel, with the design painted on the uncolored clay outside, which is then covered in a transparent glaze. Black burnished pottery has also appeared there in the forms of flower vases and pitchers. Another typed of burnished potter is given a red slip before polishing and designed with simple motifs of birds and graceful curves of black and white. These usually take the shape of water jars with covers and handles as well as duck figures. Copies of pre-Hispanic wares, such as the tripod jar and doughnut-shaped water jugs, are also made. These are usually painted with geometric designs and [[fretwork]].&lt;ref name="welles108"&gt;Hopkins and Muller 108&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Santa Fe de la Laguna]], a number of potters make glazed ware in popular shapes with black or green glaze covering most of the piece and the rest in average quality transparent glaze. Black glazed is generally used on large pieces such as water or fruit punch bowls with lids and decorated with raised leaves or roses. Many of these are made by Matias Jerónimo. Carmen Gaspar makes tableware with designs of animals or fish in white slip under green glaze. There has also been experimentation with new glaze colors, such as blue and [[mauve]].&lt;ref name="welles109"&gt;Hopkins and Muller 109&lt;/ref&gt;

The town of [[Patambán]] in the southwest of the lake area makes a green glaze ware, which is distinguished by the quality of the glaze and the fine clay used. Even the bottoms of the pieces are glazed and have designs. Most of the forms are for common use such as little mugs, pitchers plates and platters. Designs vary from geometric or linear designs to free form animals such as rabbits. They are in white slip appearing as a sharp green.&lt;ref name="welles109"/&gt;  One form that is found both here and neighboring [[San José de Gracia, Michoacán|San José de Gracia]] is a water jar in the shape of a pineapple. The body is entirely covered in small conical lumps placed by hand. These jars range from one cup to five gallons in size. The lid is decorated with a representation of the spikey crown of the fruit. Most of these are also covered in Patambán's green glaze but a brown glaze version also exists. One other vessel this town makes along with [[Huantzio]] is a large-bellied water container with a small neck. These are not glazed in green but rather covered with a red slip and burnished. They are then decorated with black and white horizontal bands interspersed with rabbits, birds and flowers. Huanzito often uses a blue and green color scheme as well.&lt;ref name="welles110111"/&gt;

[[Quiroga, Michacán|Quiroga]] sells big, black glazed pitchers and water jugs with relief scenes, mostly depicting the [[Danza de los Viejitos]]. The pottery is made in Santa Fe and painted in Quiroga.&lt;ref name="welles110111"&gt;Hopkins and Muller 110–111&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Ocumicho]] produces glazed figures of devils and other fantasies. The settings for the figures are whimsical, devils sitting on the edge of a volcano and a Noah's ark where the animals look extremely tired. Some of the best potters here are women. It is difficult to travel to the small village but the figures are sold in the towns of Uruapan and in the Casa de las Artesanias in Morelia.&lt;ref name="welles111"&gt;Hopkins and Muller 111&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Capula]], a town near [[Morelia]], produces a glazed ware that has become popular recently, and is now one of the most commonly found in popular arts stores in Mexico.  It typically has a painted design of small, formalized flowers made up of round dot petals painted in white slip on the natural red of the clay, then fired with a clear glaze.  The flowers may be limited to a band or applied lavishly over the entire piece.  The latter is frequently done with casseroles and flower pots. Forms include dishes, casseroles and flower pots.  More recently, potters from there have been experimenting with other designs, such as fish and birds made up of white or even colored dots such as blue, green or black. They are also modernizing their operation by introducing gas kilns and using a low-lead glaze.&lt;ref name="welles111"/&gt;

===State of Mexico===
[[File:SotenoTreeMAPDF.JPG|thumb|A Tree of Life sculpture by Oscar Soteno at the Museo de Arte Popular in Mexico City]]
The [[State of Mexico]] has several pottery towns with the best known being Metepec. The center of the town has a number of well-stocked crafts stores featuring local pottery as well as an outdoor market. The best known forms associated with Metepec are its Trees of Life, mermaids and animals such as lions, horses (with or without wings) and ox teams. That stands out about the forms is not so much their shape, which tends to be stocky and solid, but the colors that adorn them. Like [[alebrije]]s, they are painted in bright and quite unnatural colors such as pink, green, yellow and other colors. Some of the best known potters include José Vara, Saúl Ortega and [[Soteno family of Metepec (pottery)|Alfonso Soteno]].&lt;ref name="welles112"&gt;Hopkins and Muller 112&lt;/ref&gt;

A "tree of life" ({{lang|es|arbol de la vida}}) is a theme of clay sculpture created in central Mexico.  The image depicted in these sculptures originally was for the teaching of the Biblical story of creation to natives in the early colonial period. The fashioning of the trees in a clay sculpture began in [[Izúcar de Matamoros]], [[Puebla]] but today the craft is most closely identified with Metepec.&lt;ref name="wavila"&gt;{{cite news |title= Las manos mágicas en el barro del árbol de la vida |first= Wilfrido |last= Ávila |url= http://www.oem.com.mx/esto/notas/n961499.htm |newspaper= El Sol de Cuernavaca |location=Cuernavaca, Mexico |date=2008-12-08 |accessdate= March 5, 2010 |language=Spanish |trans-title=|quote=Magic hands in the clay of the Tree of Life }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Traditionally, these sculptures are supposed to consist of certain biblical images, such as [[Adam and Eve]], but other themes such as Christmas, Day of the Dead and even themes unrelated to religion are made.&lt;ref name="welles112"/&gt;&lt;ref name="representa"&gt;{{cite news |title= Representa en barro historias y leyendas |first= Maria de la Luz  |last= Gonzalez |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=1996-07-16 |page=23 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Stories and legends represented in clay }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Trees of life can be small or as tall as a person. The figures on the Trees of Life are made by molding and attached to the main tree figure with wires before firing. Most are painted in bright colors but there are versions painted entirely in white with gold touches and others left in their natural reddish clay color.&lt;ref name="welles112113"&gt;Hopkins and Muller 112-113&lt;/ref&gt;

Another popular ware both to make and to adorn the houses are round suns with spiky halos with smiling or surprised faces. These are sold both painted and unpainted. The workshop of Saul Camacho makes majolica similar to the Talavera of Puebla and Manuel León Montes de Oca, makes copies of pre-Hispanic pieces. These pieces are valued because the artisan took the time to study the forms and cultures of the originals. Metepec also makes pottery for everyday use, generally of the natural clay color with simple geometric designs done in white slip. One of the more unusual pieces of this type are pitcher and cup set designed for the drinking of [[pulque]]. These often carry interesting slogans such as "I am yours" or "Long Live Pulque" or "Let him who drains me, fill me." They can also be distinguished by having animal or people heads (bull, goat, man with cigar and others) with the pulque coming out of the mouth. Many of these are made by Lázaro León.&lt;ref name="welles113114"&gt;Hopkins and Muller 113–114&lt;/ref&gt;
Another town that produced wares for pulque is [[Tecomatepec]], near [[Ixtapan de la Sal]]. The pitchers are stately with scroll designs in black on a cream colored background finished in a transparent glaze. Other pieces include dishes, cups etc. also glazed in cream with raised swans or flowers and painted in yellow, green and blue. Copies of pre-Hispanic figures are made as well.&lt;ref name="welles114"&gt;Hopkins and Muller 114&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chihuahua===
[[File:Mataortizpottery.jpg|thumb|Example of Mata Ortiz or Pakimé pottery by Jorge Quintana]]
The village of [[Juan Mata Ortiz]] is located along the banks of the [[Palanganas River]] near [[Nuevo Casas Grandes]] in the high northern plains of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]]. It was named after a 19th-century local hero who fought against the [[Apache]]s.&lt;ref name="mjohnson"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Johnson |first1=Mark M. |date=February 1999 |title= The potters of Mata Ortiz: Transforming a tradition |journal=Arts and Activities |location=Skokie |volume=125 |issue=1 |pages=29–33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the home of Juan Quezada, who is credited for creating Mata Ortiz or Pakimé style pottery. When he was fourteen, he came across the abandoned pre-Hispanic village of Pakimé along with fragments of its pottery. This pottery was decorated in intricate designs, and Quezada reasoned that materials for making it were nearby.&lt;ref name="donnelly"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Donnelly |first1=Karen |date=April 2000 |title= The art of innovation: Mexico Mata Ortiz pottery |journal=The World &amp; I |volume=15  |issue=4 |pages=112 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pottery he found is part of the Casas Grandes style polychrome pottery, which flourished between 1175 and 1400 and is related to Pueblo style pottery.&lt;ref name="mjohnson"/&gt; Over time and with much experimentation, Quezada learned to recreate the pottery completely on his own with no prior training or experience at all.&lt;ref name="donnelly"/&gt;

Quezada gave his first pieces to family and friends, and then sold a few. Three of these early pieces made their way to a secondhand shop in Deming, New Mexico, where [[Spencer MacCallum]], an archeologist and art historian found them. Realizing their value, MacCallum travelled to Chihuahua searching for the pots’ creator. Eventually, he made his way to the Mata Ortiz home of Juan Quezada. For eight years MacCallum provided financial support for Quezada to allow him to further develop the craft with MacCallum acting as mentor and agent. The pottery gained fame in art world, culminating in an exhibition at the [[Arizona State Museum]] in 1977. From then on, Quezada has taught his family and others in the community to make the pottery. Quezada does not keep his techniques nor his material supplies secret; rather he shares with any who have interest.&lt;ref name="donnelly"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hearst"&gt;{{cite press release |title=Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology serves the UC Berkeley campus |publisher=Hearst Museum |date=July 6, 2005 |url=http://hearstmuseum.berkeley.edu/media/pdfs/mata_%20ortiz_pottery_%20press_%20release.doc |accessdate=May 2, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621201645/http://hearstmuseum.berkeley.edu/media/pdfs/mata_%20ortiz_pottery_%20press_%20release.doc |archivedate=June 21, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike a number of revivals of pottery traditions in Arizona and New Mexico, this renewal of an ancient art was done by one of the village residents without any help initially from archeologists or museums.&lt;ref name="mjohnson"/&gt;

While Pakimé pottery is inspired by pre-Hispanic pottery, it is not an exact copy. Unlike other parts of Mexico, the pottery tradition broke completely here sometime during the colonial period.&lt;ref name="donnelly"/&gt; The current residents do not consider themselves to be the descendents of the Casas Grandes culture nor do their traditions tie to it. No one before Quezada's generation was involved with pottery.&lt;ref name="mjohnson"/&gt; This has allowed the potters to experiment and test the limits of form and design, unlike many other Mexican potters who are constrained by generations of tradition. However, Quezada's recreation is interesting because he recreated two of the basic potting techniques from the pre-Hispanic period, the coil and molding methods.&lt;ref name="donnelly"/&gt; The raw clay is dug with a pick and shovel in the rugged foothills outside the town. It is cleaned by soaking it in water until it can be poured through a sieve. White clay is a favorite to work with but many colors are used. A potter's wheel is not used. The bottom of the pot is molded and the upper part is created by the coil method. When the pot is dry, it is rubbed with a stone or other hard object to make it shine. This can take days. Pots are fired on the open ground using wood and manure for fuel. Paints are made with mineral pigments collected locally. The pigments are ground into a powder using a metate grinding stone, then mixed with clay to  make a milky fluid paint.&lt;ref name="hearst"/&gt; Many use traditional colors such as red, white and earth tones, but brighter colors have also been used. Brushes are made from dog, cat and even human hair.&lt;ref name="donnelly"/&gt;

Over three hundred people in this village of about two thousand make these pots. Most artisans make low to medium quality wares, with only a few making fine pots that are thin and light. Highly regarded artists include the Quezada family, the Ortiz family, Taurina Baca, and Hector and Graciella Gallegos. Nicolas Ortiz is known for sculptural pieces. The pottery has been a great boon to the community economically. Before, men did seasonal labor and the women had no opportunity to earn money. The income from pottery has allowed families to build and improve homes and buy cars.&lt;ref name="donnelly"/&gt;

===Other pottery traditions===
[[File:JarsOfeliaMAPHidalgo.JPG|thumb|Ceramic storage jars by Ofelia Gonzalez Mendoza of Jose Maria Pino Suarez, Tepetitlan, Hidalgo as part of a temporary exhibit on Hidalgo crafts at the [[Museo de Arte Popular, Mexico City]].]]
In [[Chililico]], a [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] village near [[Huejutla de Reyes]], [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]], women still dominate potting, producing decorated pieces for ceremonial use. They have also combined new ideas and techniques with traditional designs. One notable work is the faithful reproduction of rural scenes on their wares, extending this decoration to newer items such as ashtrays and pictures.&lt;ref name="welles115"&gt;Hopkins and Muller 115&lt;/ref&gt;

States along the Gulf coast, such as Veracruz, [[Tabasco]], [[Campeche]] and [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]] have centers associated with pottery but most of these produce to serve local needs and much of the work used to be done solely by women. Since pottery work has been done here for centuries has had less European influence on it than in the central highlands, indigenous influence can still be seen in many of the utensils and toys.  With the introduction of firing kilns and glazing, men have become more involved in many areas, with many pottery production centers now family affairs.&lt;ref name="welles115"/&gt;
Major pottery centers in Veracruz are located in [[Blanca Espina]], [[Aguasuelos]] and [[Tlacotalpan, Veracruz|Tlacotalpan]]. In Blanca Espuma, most of what is produced in household ware with pieces glazed and decorated in ways similar to Aguasuelos and Chililico. In Aguasuelos, large pots called ollas are produced. Many of these are still decorated with flowers as in the past, but designs are shifting in favor of churches of the region, houses and even scenes of daily life.&lt;ref name="welles115"/&gt;

[[File:Déesse-Mère Maya (musée du Quai Branly) (15616877042).jpg|thumb|left|Ceramic figure with remains of [[Maya blue]], 600 to 900 AD, [[Jaina Island]].]]
In Tlacotalpan, water coolers are principally produced, which are common in hot climates. So that the coolers fulfill their function, the clay is only smoothed and then burnished on some of its surfaces, giving it a decorative effect with contrasting textures.Water absorption by the walls of the clay receptacle keeps the water cool.&lt;ref name="welles116"&gt;Hopkins and Muller 116&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Tepakan, Campeche]], a Maya community, they make traditional flowerpots and whistles. They also make pitchers in dark brown tones that represent, according to the female potters, the wind god. One of the largest kilns of the Moorish type in Mexico is also found here. Close to Tepakan, in the neighboring state of Yucatán is the Maya village of [[Ticul, Yucatán|Ticul]]. The specialty here is the reproduction of Maya pieces found in the tombs of [[Jaina Island|Jaina]], an island just offshore in the Gulf.&lt;ref name="welles116"/&gt;

[[Amatenango del Valle]], [[Chiapas]] is home to a ceramics production factory that is a significant source of employment for the local population. Objects produced include miniature animals, real and fantasy, modeled principally by children. The adults, mostly women, produce large objects such as large jars called tinajas. These are decorated using slips of various colors.  Dove-shaped flowerpots are another common piece. Because these are large pieces, and because of tradition, the pieces are fired on the ground with the wood piled on top.&lt;ref name="welles116"/&gt;

[[Pre-Columbian]] Mexico had a great tradition for thousands of years of making sculptures and figurines in clay, much of which was lost during the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] and [[Mexican Colonial]] period.  The tradition began to make a comeback in the mid 20th century with artists such as [[Juan Soriano]], Francisco Toledo and [[Mathias Goeritz]].  Many of these artists used clay to make rough drafts of works to be done in other materials such as metals, but eventually turned to clay as the primary medium. Clay sculpting came back to the forefront of Mexican art with an exhibition called "Terra incognita" at the [[Museo de Arte Moderno]] in 1981, although relatively little has been written about the phenomenon. Some of the best known current artists in this medium include Gerardo Azcunaga, Adriana Margain, Javier Marin and Miriam Medrez.&lt;ref name="ogarcia"&gt;{{cite news |title= Muestran del barro el uso contemporaneo |first=Omar |last=Garcia |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=December 19, 2003 |page=4 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Demonstrate contemporary use of clay }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ceramics and the Mexican economy==
[[File:MuralMetroGuerreroDF.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Tile mural in Metro Garibaldi in Mexico City]]
[[File:TilesWallMuralsMAPHidalgo.JPG|thumb|Tiles for wall murals created by Jesus Chavez Medina of [[Huasca de Ocampo]].]]
While the production of pots and utensils is Mexico's signature pottery, ceramic floor and wall tiles consist of the bulk of Mexico's ceramic production. The second largest type of ceramic product is bathroom fixtures, such as toilets, washbasins and accessories. Most of the raw materials are obtained from the local market, with limited amounts of other raw materials being imported. Most of equipment used to mass-produce ceramics of this type comes from Italy, including pressure molds and development technology. However, companies are also considering US suppliers for mixers, conveyors, ovens and electronic control equipment due to the country's proximity and NAFTA tariffs.&lt;ref name="isector"&gt;{{Cite report |title= MEXICO: CERAMICS INDUSTRY, EQUIP &amp; MATERIALS MARKET 1; [1] |year=1996 |publisher=Industry Sector Analysis. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Mexico exported to the United States US$78.1 million of glazed and unglazed floor coverings, importing US$17 million in equipment and raw materials for these products. 75% of bathroom fixtures are exported to the United States to the a value US$54.7 million in 1994.&lt;ref name="isector"/&gt;

The most underdeveloped mass ceramics area is in [[tableware]], [[porcelain]] and [[stoneware]]. Mexico has only two major tableware manufacturers, [[Anfora]] and Santa Anita, which produce porcelain and stoneware respectively. [[Anfora]] is the only one that has been successful in exporting its goods to US companies including Panera Bread, Pottery Barn and Starbucks. Most of these ceramics are imported from other countries such as the United States, Japan and Germany despite its ability to produce it itself. However, the lack of certain raw materials may partially explain this.&lt;ref name="isector"/&gt; Another problem is the continued production of [[lead glaze]]d ware, which cannot be exported. While lead free and low lead glazes have been developed for use with low temperature firing, the most traditional, only about half of artisans use it.&lt;ref name="cleanplate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="oficio"/&gt;

However, the fastest growing ceramics industry sector is composed of small companies that manufacture mostly handmade tableware and decorative articles. This industry sector is rapidly finding export markets in the United States, the Far East, and in some parts of Europe. It is labor-intensive, but does require the importation of certain equipment such as [[kiln]]s. Most of goods produced by this sector is exported to the United States. As this sector continues to grow and become more sophisticated, more manufacturing equipment will likely be imported.&lt;ref name="isector"/&gt;

For people living in very rural areas of Mexico with little to no employment, the production of crafts, especially ceramics, provide an option. For many people living in rural Oaxaca economic options are limited to subsistence farming, working in Mexico City or illegally migrating to the United States. This has left many small villages such as [[San Jeronimo Slayopylla]] virtual ghost towns, populated only by some elderly, women and children. For at least some, the interest in native and folk pottery provides another option. Cooperatives, such as "Polvo de Agua" unite craftspeople from various locales to sell their wares and provide income for their families.&lt;ref name="mandel"/&gt; The production of pottery has raised living standards in other small villages in other areas, such as Mata Ortiz in Chihuahua as well.&lt;ref name="donnelly"/&gt;  Most artisans in rural areas learn the trade from their families and continue in the same techniques their ancestors used. For many in rural areas, the selling of pottery is their only cash income.&lt;ref name="oficio"/&gt;

A growing number of potters are also turning to the Internet to sell their items abroad, even if they do not have direct access to a computer. [[Soteno family of Metepec (pottery)|Oscar Soteno]], a renowned potter in Metepec, uses it to sell his trees of life sculptures and other works to the United States. Selling to the lucrative Christmas market is particularly profitable. Even though Day of the Dead motifs are not related to Halloween, they have found their way into many U.S. homes for this holiday, thanks to the Internet. Many artisans work with NOVICA.com, a company what works with third-world artists to help them sell their wares in other countries. This permits many artisans to sell directly, cutting out middlemen.&lt;ref name="heightech"&gt;{{cite news |title= Mexican Artisans Plan High-Tech Marketing Strategy To Capture North American Halloween Market |newspaper=PR Newswire |location=New York |date=Oct 12, 2000 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Barro sin Plomo, an organization related to the World Bank, has had success in exporting lead-free pottery items to the United States and says that the market outlook for these products is optimistic. One market segment is that of Mexican restaurants in the U.S. who want to have Mexican style dishes but cannot import enough that meet U.S. lead standards. Another possible market is [[Central America]].&lt;ref name="advierten"&gt;{{cite news |title= Advierten pronta extincion de alfareria en Mexico; [Source: El Universal] |first= Francisco |last=Rosas |newspaper=Noticias Financieras |location=Miami |date=May 4, 2007 |page=23 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Warning of the soon-to-be extinction of pottery in Mexico}}&lt;/ref&gt;

State and federal government agencies have been created to support ceramic production, especially in the rural areas. The Premio Nacional de Cerámica was begun in 1977, and awards cash prizes in various category. The most prestigious prize is the Galardon Presidencial (Presidential Recognition), which is signed by the president of Mexico.&lt;ref name="cduran"/&gt; Each year, Metepec hosts the Concurso Nacional de Alfarería and Ceramica "Arbol de la Vida." This event awards a first prize of 50,000 pesos to the best work done in clay. There are also prizes for subcategories such as glazed and unglazed pieces as well as high-fire and low-fire ceramics. The event attracts artist and artisans from Oaxaca and Jalisco as well as the State of Mexico. Judges come from the [[Museo de Arte Popular, Mexico City|Museo de Arte Popular in Mexico City]], [[UAEM]] and other institutions.&lt;ref name="galardonan"&gt;{{cite news |title= Galardonan creatividad artesanal |first=Arturo |last=Espinosa |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=May 23, 2002 |page=18 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Recognaize craft creativity }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the support and interest in traditional Mexican ceramics, the number of artisans is dropping. In 1994, there were just over 1.5 million ceramic artisans in the country, which dropped to 50,000 by 2006. This made craftsmen almost non-existent in some states. Majolica is no longer being produced in Aguascalientes and the number of workshops in Guanajuato state has been cut in half in recent years.  In major cities such as Mexico City and [[Monterrey]], there is only a handful. One reason for this is that many craft products are being replaced by cheaper pewter and plastic wares. Another reason is that many from craft producing areas have left to work in the United States.&lt;ref name="advierten"/&gt;

For his most recent role, as "JJ DiMeo" on ''[[Speechless (TV series)|Speechless]]'', he found out he booked the role on his eighteenth birthday. In an interview with ''[[People magazine]]'', Fowler said it was the "best birthday present ever!"&lt;ref name="people"&gt;{{cite web|last1=King|first1=Brittany|title=Speechless Star Micah Fowler Opens Up About Thriving with Cerebral Palsy: 'I Don’t Let It Define Me'|url=http://people.com/celebrity/speechless-micah-fowler-opens-up-thriving-cerebral-palsy/|website=People}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding his role on ''Speechless'', he said it is a challenge to play JJ. Although Fowler is able to speak, the JJ character does not speak, so Fowler has to compensate with dramatic facial expressions and body movements. It's said that Fowler's humor gets the show's biggest laughs.&lt;ref name="ew" /&gt; He said he sometimes just wants to blurt out what he is feeling or saying.&lt;ref name="people" /&gt;

Fowler and the character he portrays both have cerebral palsy, and he is one of few actors with a disability playing a character with a disability on primetime network television.&lt;ref name="bzf"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lange|first1=Ariane|title=Meet The Teen Who’s Casually Making Sitcom History|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/arianelange/micah-fowler-speechless-abc|website=Buzzfeed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ambassador for the Cerebral Palsy Foundation==
When not performing, Fowler devotes his time as an ambassador for the [[Cerebral Palsy Foundation]] (CPF). After each episode of ''Speechless'', the CPF's website posts content and short informational videos about cerebral palsy. Fowler encourages, "So the next time you watch ''Speechless'', take 10 minutes to check out their post for the night."&lt;ref name="people" /&gt;

==Personal life==
When taking the role for ''Speechless'', Fowler had to move from New Jersey to Los Angeles. To take the role, he sacrificed by missing much of his sled hockey season and much of his senior year. He plans to attend his graduation ceremony in the spring.&lt;ref name="bzf" /&gt;

While Fowler had previously been somewhat averse to social media, after landing the role on ''Speechless'', he did join Instagram and Twitter in an effort to promote the show.

Growing up he said he was a huge fan of movies and television. He said, "I couldn't help but notice the lack of characters dealing with disabilities."&lt;ref name="ew" /&gt; He hopes to be in a ''[[Star Wars]]'' film or a Marvel movie.&lt;ref name="bzf" /&gt;

'''Modernism''' is a philosophical movement that, along with cultural trends and changes, arose from wide-scale and far-reaching transformations in [[Western world|Western society]] during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Among the factors that shaped modernism were the development of modern [[Industrial society|industrial societies]] and the rapid growth of cities, followed then by reactions of horror to [[World War I]]. Modernism also rejected the certainty of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinking, and many modernists rejected religious belief.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pericles Lewis]], ''Modernism, Nationalism, and the Novel'' ([[Cambridge University Press]], 2000). pp. 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[[James Joyce|[James] Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' is a comedy not divine, ending, like Dante's, in the vision of a God whose will is our peace, but human all-too-human...."
Peter Faulkner, ''Modernism'' (Taylor &amp; Francis, 1990). p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modernism, in general, includes the activities and creations of those who felt the traditional forms of art, architecture, literature, religious faith, philosophy, social organization, activities of daily life, and sciences, were becoming ill-fitted to their tasks and outdated in the new economic, social, and political environment of an emerging fully industrialized world. The poet [[Ezra Pound]]'s 1934 injunction to "Make it new!" was the touchstone of the movement's approach towards what it saw as the now obsolete culture of the past. In this spirit, its innovations, like the [[stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream-of-consciousness]] novel, [[atonal]] (or pantonal) and [[twelve-tone]] music, [[divisionist]] painting and [[abstract art]], all had precursors in the 19th century.

A notable characteristic of modernism is self-consciousness and irony concerning literary and social traditions, which often led to experiments with form, along with the use of techniques that drew attention to the processes and materials used in creating a painting, poem, building, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, Helen, Horst de la Croix, Richard G. Tansey, and Diane Kirkpatrick. ''Gardner's Art Through the Ages'' (San Diego: [[Harcourt Brace Jovanovich]], 1991). {{ISBN|0155037706}}. p. 953.&lt;/ref&gt; Modernism explicitly rejected the ideology of [[Realism (arts)|realism]]&lt;ref name="Barth79Replenishment"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Graff73"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Graff75"/&gt; and makes use of the works of the past by the employment of [[reprise]], [[incorporation (linguistics)|incorporation]], rewriting, [[recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]], revision and [[parody]].&lt;ref name="Eco90"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Steiner98p489"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Childs2000p17"/&gt;

Some commentators define modernism as a mode of thinking—one or more philosophically defined characteristics, like self-consciousness or self-reference, that run across all the novelties in the arts and the disciplines.&lt;ref name="Everdell"&gt;Everdell, William, ''[[The First Moderns|The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth Century Thought]]'', University of Chicago Press, 1997, {{ISBN|0226224805}}.&lt;/ref&gt; More common, especially in the West, are those who see it as a socially progressive trend of thought that affirms the power of human beings to create, improve and reshape their environment with the aid of practical experimentation, scientific knowledge, or technology.&lt;ref&gt;"In the twentieth century, the social processes that bring this maelstrom into being, and keep it in a state of perpetual becoming, have come to be called 'modernization'. These world-historical processes have nourished an amazing variety of visions and ideas that aim to make men and women the subjects as well as the objects of modernization, to give them the power to change the world that is changing them, to make their way through the maelstrom and make it their own. Over the past century, these visions and values have come to be loosely grouped together under the name of 'modernism'." (Berman 1988, 16)&lt;/ref&gt; From this perspective, modernism encouraged the re-examination of every aspect of existence, from commerce to philosophy, with the goal of finding that which was 'holding back' [[progress (history)|progress]], and replacing it with new ways of reaching the same end. Others focus on modernism as an aesthetic introspection. This facilitates consideration of specific reactions to the use of technology in the First World War, and anti-technological and nihilistic aspects of the works of diverse thinkers and artists spanning the period from [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (1844–1900) to [[Samuel Beckett]] (1906–1989).&lt;ref&gt;[[Lee Oser]], ''The Ethics of Modernism: Moral Ideas in Yeats, Eliot, Joyce, Woolf and Beckett'' ([[Cambridge University Press]], 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F.J. Marker &amp; C.D. Innes, ''Modernism in European Drama: Ibsen, Stringdberg, Pirandello, Beckett''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morag Shiach, "Situating Samuel Beckett", pp. 234–247 in ''The Cambridge Companion to the Modernist Novel'' (Cambridge University Press, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kathryne V. Lindberg, ''Reading Pound Reading: Modernism After Nietzsche'' (Oxford University Press, 1987)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pericles Lewis, ''The Cambridge Introduction to Modernism'' (Cambridge University Press, 2007). p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

While some scholars see modernism continuing into the twenty first century, others see it evolving into [[late modernism]] or [[high modernism]].&lt;ref&gt;Morris Dickstein, "An Outsider to His Own Life", Books, ''The New York Times'', August 3, 1997; Anthony Mellors, ''Late modernist poetics: From Pound to Prynne''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Postmodernism]] is a departure from modernism and refutes its basic assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/postmodernism|title=postmodernism: definition of postmodernism in Oxford dictionary (American English) (US)|work=oxforddictionaries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Reichl, Cook's November 1989; [https://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=postmodernism American Heritage Dictionary's definition of "postmodern"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mura |first=Andrea |year=2012 |title=The Symbolic Function of Transmodernity |journal=Language and Psychoanalysis |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=68–87 |url=https://www.language-and-psychoanalysis.com/Mura%202012.pdf |doi=10.7565/landp.2012.0005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151008211951/http://www.language-and-psychoanalysis.com/Mura%202012.pdf |archivedate=8 October 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==
===Origins===
[[File:Eugène Delacroix - La liberté guidant le peuple.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Eugène Delacroix]]'s ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'', 1830, a [[romanticism|Romantic]] work of art]]
According to one critic, modernism developed out of [[Romanticism]]'s revolt against the effects of the [[Industrial Revolution]] and [[bourgeois]] values: "The ground motive of modernism, [[Gerald Graff|Graff]] asserts, was criticism of the nineteenth-century bourgeois social order and its world view [...] the modernists, carrying the torch of romanticism."&lt;ref name="Barth79Replenishment"&gt;Barth (1979) quotation: {{quotation|The ground motive of modernism, Graff asserts, was criticism of the nineteenth-century bourgeois social order and its world view. Its artistic strategy was the self-conscious overturning of the conventions of bourgeois realism [...] the antirationalist, antirealist, antibourgeois program of modernism [...] the modernists, carrying the torch of romanticism, taught us that linearity, rationality, consciousness, cause and effect, naïve illusionism, transparent language, innocent anecdote, and middle-class moral conventions are not the whole story.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Graff73"&gt;Graff (1973)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Graff75"&gt;Graff (1975)&lt;/ref&gt; While [[J. M. W. Turner]] (1775–1851), one of the greatest landscape painters of the 19th century, was a member of the [[Romantic movement]], as "a pioneer in the study of light, colour, and atmosphere", he "anticipated the [[French Impressionists]]" and therefore modernism "in breaking down conventional formulas of representation; [though] unlike them, he believed that his works should always express significant historical, mythological, literary, or other narrative themes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/610274/J-M-W-Turner| title=J.M.W. Turner| work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Franz von Lenbach Bismarck.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|A [[Realism (arts)|Realist]] portrait of [[Otto von Bismarck]]. The modernists condemned realism]]

The dominant trends of industrial [[Victorian England]] were opposed, from about 1850, by the English poets and painters that constituted the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]], because of their "opposition to technical skill without inspiration."&lt;ref name=Bloomsbury&gt;''The Bloomsbury Guide to English Literature'', ed. Marion Wynne-Davies. New York: Prentice Hall, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|815}} They were influenced by the writings of the art critic [[John Ruskin]] (1819–1900), who had strong feelings about the role of art in helping to improve the lives of the urban working classes, in the rapidly expanding industrial cities of Britain.&lt;ref name=Bloomsbury/&gt;{{rp|816}} Art critic [[Clement Greenberg]] describes the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood as proto-Modernists: "There the proto-Modernists were, of all people, the pre-Raphaelites (and even before them, as proto-proto-Modernists, the German [[Nazarene movement|Nazarenes]]). The Pre-Raphaelites actually foreshadowed [[Manet]] (1832–83), with whom Modernist painting most definitely begins. They acted on a dissatisfaction with painting as practiced in their time, holding that its realism wasn't truthful enough."&lt;ref name=Greenberg&gt;Clement Greenberg, [http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/postmodernism.html "Modern and Postmodern"], William Dobell Memorial Lecture, Sydney, Australia, Oct 31, 1979, Arts 54, No.6 (February 1980)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rationalism]] has also had opponents in the philosophers [[Søren Kierkegaard]] (1813–55)&lt;ref name="Stanford"&gt;{{Cite book| chapter-url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kierkegaard/| title=Søren Kierkegaard (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)| publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University| chapter=Søren Kierkegaard| year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (1844–1900), both of whom had significant influence on [[existentialism]].&lt;ref name=Collinson&gt;Diané Collinson, ''Fifty Major Philosophers: A Reference Guide''. London: Routledge, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|120}}

However, the Industrial Revolution continued. Influential innovations included steam-powered industrialization, and especially the development of railways, starting in Britain in the 1830s,&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Hylton (2007). ''The Grand Experiment: The Birth of the Railway Age'' 1820–1845. Ian Allan Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; and the subsequent advancements in physics, engineering, and architecture associated with this. A major 19th-century engineering achievement was [[The Crystal Palace]], the huge cast-iron and plate glass exhibition hall built for [[The Great Exhibition]] of 1851 in London. Glass and iron were used in a similar monumental style in the construction of major railway terminals in [[London]], such as [[Paddington Station]] (1854)&lt;ref&gt;R.V.J. Butt (1995). ''The Directory of Railway Stations''. Yeovil: Patrick Stephens. p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross station]] (1852).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.lner.info/co/GNR/kingscross.shtml| title=LNER Encyclopedia: The Great Northern Railway: Kings Cross Station| publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These technological advances led to the building of later structures like the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] (1883) and the [[Eiffel Tower]] (1889). The latter broke all previous limitations on how tall man-made objects could be. These engineering marvels radically altered the 19th-century urban environment and the daily lives of people. The human experience of time itself was altered, with the development of the electric [[telegraph]] from 1837,&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Hubbard (1965), ''Cooke and Wheatstone and the Invention of the Electric Telegraph'', Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, London p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; and the adoption of [[standard time]] by British railway companies from 1845, and in the rest of the world over the next fifty years.&lt;ref&gt;Ian R. Bartky (January 1989). "The adoption of standard time". ''Technology and Culture'' 30 (1): 25–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

But despite continuing technological advances the idea that history and civilization were inherently progressive, and that progress was always good, came under increasing attack in the nineteenth century. Arguments arose that the values of the artist and those of society were not merely different, but that Society was antithetical to Progress, and could not move forward in its present form.  Early in the century, the philosopher [[Schopenhauer]] (1788–1860) (''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', 1819) had called into question the previous optimism, and his ideas had an important influence on later thinkers, including Nietzsche.&lt;ref name="Stanford" /&gt; Two of the most significant thinkers of the mid nineteenth century were biologist [[Charles Darwin]] (1809–1882), author of ''[[On the Origin of Species|On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection]]'' (1859), and political scientist [[Karl Marx]] (1818–1883), author of ''[[Das Kapital]]'' (1867). Darwin's theory of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]] undermined religious certainty and the idea of human uniqueness. In particular, the notion that human beings were driven by the same impulses as "lower animals" proved to be difficult to reconcile with the idea of an ennobling spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;''The Norton Anthology of English Literature'', vol. 2 (7th edition). New York: Norton, 2000, pp. 1051–1052.&lt;/ref&gt; Karl Marx argued that there were fundamental contradictions within the [[capitalist]] system, and that the workers were anything but free.&lt;ref&gt;Craig J. Calhoun (2002). ''Classical Sociological Theory''. Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell, pp. 20–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The beginnings in the late nineteenth century===
Historians, and writers in different disciplines, have suggested various dates as starting points for modernism. Historian [[William Everdell]], for example, has argued that modernism began in the 1870s, when metaphorical (or [[ontological]]) continuity began to yield to the discrete with mathematician [[Richard Dedekind]]'s (1831–1916) [[Dedekind cut]], and [[Ludwig Boltzmann]]'s (1844–1906) [[statistical thermodynamics]].&lt;ref name="Everdell" /&gt; Everdell also thinks modernism in painting began in 1885–1886 with [[Seurat]]'s [[Divisionism]], the "dots" used to paint ''[[A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte]]''. On the other hand, visual art critic [[Clement Greenberg]] called [[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804) "the first real Modernist",&lt;ref&gt;Frascina and Harrison 1982, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; though he also wrote, "What can be safely called Modernism emerged in the middle of the last century—and rather locally, in France, with [[Charles Baudelaire|Baudelaire]] in literature and [[Édouard Manet|Manet]] in painting, and perhaps with [[Gustave Flaubert|Flaubert]], too, in prose fiction. (It was a while later, and not so locally, that Modernism appeared in [[Modernism (music)|music]] and [[Modern architecture|architecture]])."&lt;ref name=Greenberg/&gt; The poet Baudelaire's ''[[Les Fleurs du mal]]'' (''The Flowers of Evil''), and Flaubert's novel ''[[Madame Bovary]]'' were both published in 1857.

In the arts and letters, two important approaches developed separately in France, beginning in the 1860s. The first was [[Impressionism]], a school of painting that initially focused on work done, not in studios, but outdoors (''[[en plein air]]''). Impressionist paintings demonstrated that human beings do not see objects, but instead see light itself. The school gathered adherents despite internal divisions among its leading practitioners, and became increasingly influential. Initially rejected from the most important commercial show of the time, the government-sponsored [[Paris Salon]], the Impressionists organized yearly group exhibitions in commercial venues during the 1870s and 1880s, timing them to coincide with the official Salon. A significant event of 1863 was the [[Salon des Refusés]], created by [[Napoleon III|Emperor Napoleon&amp;nbsp;III]] to display all of the paintings rejected by the Paris Salon. While most were in standard styles, but by inferior artists, the work of Manet attracted tremendous attention, and opened commercial doors to the movement. The second French school was [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], which literary historians see beginning with Charles Baudelaire (1821–1867), and including the later poets, [[Arthur Rimbaud]] (1854–1891) ''Une Saison en Enfer'' (''A Season in Hell'', 1873), [[Paul Verlaine]] (1844–1896), [[Stéphane Mallarmé]] (1842–1898), and [[Paul Valéry]] (1871–1945). The symbolists "stressed the priority of suggestion and evocation over direct description and explicit analogy," and were especially interested in "the musical properties of language."&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Companion to English Literature'', ed. [[Margaret Drabble]], Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996, p. 966.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Cabaret]], which gave birth to so many of the arts of modernism, including the immediate precursors of film, may be said to have begun in France in 1881 with the opening of the [[Le Chat Noir|Black Cat]] in [[Montmartre]], the beginning of the ironic monologue, and the founding of the Society of Incoherent Arts.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Dennis Cate and Mary Shaw, eds., ''The Spirit of Montmartre: Cabarets, Humor, and the Avant-Garde, 1875–1905''. New Brunswick, NJ: [[Rutgers University]], 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of his friends and colleagues, even fellow painters Henri Matisse and [[Georges Braque]], were upset when they saw this painting.]]
Influential in the early days of modernism were the theories of [[Sigmund Freud]] (1856–1939). Freud's first major work was ''[[Studies on Hysteria]]'' (with [[Josef Breuer]], 1895). Central to Freud's thinking is the idea "of the primacy of the unconscious mind in mental life," so that all subjective reality was based on the play of basic drives and instincts, through which the outside world was perceived. Freud's description of subjective states involved an unconscious mind full of primal impulses, and counterbalancing self-imposed restrictions derived from social values.&lt;ref name=Bloomsbury/&gt;{{rp|538}}

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (1844–1900) was another major precursor of modernism,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Gooding-Williams, "Nietzsche's Pursuit of Modernism",
''New German Critique'', No. 41, Special Issue on the Critiques of the Enlightenment. (Spring–Summer, 1987), pp. 95–108.&lt;/ref&gt; with a philosophy in which psychological drives, specifically the "[[will to power]]" (''Wille zur Macht''), was of central importance: "Nietzsche often identified life itself with 'will to power', that is, with an instinct for growth and durability."&lt;ref&gt;Bernd Magnus, "Friedrich Nietzsche". ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Online Academic Edition. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2013. Web. 19 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/414670/Friedrich-Nietzsche| title=Friedrich Nietzsche| work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henri Bergson]] (1859–1941), on the other hand, emphasized the difference between scientific, clock time and the direct, subjective, human experience of time.&lt;ref name=Collinson/&gt;{{rp|131}} His work on time and consciousness "had a great influence on twentieth-century novelists," especially those Modernists who used the [[stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] technique, such as [[Dorothy Richardson]], [[James Joyce]], and [[Virginia Woolf]] (1882–1941).&lt;ref&gt;''The Bloomsbury Guides to English Literature: The Twentieth Century'', ed. Linda R. Williams. London: Bloomsbury, 1992, pp. 108–109.&lt;/ref&gt; Also important in Bergson's philosophy was the idea of ''élan vital'', the life force, which "brings about the creative evolution of everything."&lt;ref name=Collinson/&gt;{{rp|132}} His philosophy also placed a high value on [[intuition]], though without rejecting the importance of the intellect.&lt;ref name=Collinson/&gt;{{rp|132}}

Important literary precursors of modernism were [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] (1821–1881), who wrote the novels ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'' (1866) and ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'' (1880);&lt;ref&gt;David Denby, ''New Yorker'', 11 June 2012, "Can Dostoevsky Still Kick You in the Gut?"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walt Whitman]] (1819–1892), who published the poetry collection ''[[Leaves of Grass]]'' (1855–1891); and [[August Strindberg]] (1849–1912), especially his later plays, including the trilogy ''To Damascus'' 1898–1901, ''A Dream Play'' (1902) and ''The Ghost Sonata'' (1907). [[Henry James]] has also been suggested as a significant precursor, in a work as early as ''[[The Portrait of a Lady]]'' (1881).&lt;ref&gt;[[M. H. Abrams]], ''A Glossary of Literary Terms''. New York: Harcourt Brace, 1999), p. 299.&lt;/ref&gt;

Out of the collision of ideals derived from Romanticism, and an attempt to find a way for knowledge to explain that which was as yet unknown, came the first wave of works in the first decade of the 20th century, which, while their authors considered them extensions of existing trends in art, broke the implicit contract with the general public that artists were the interpreters and representatives of bourgeois culture and ideas. These "Modernist" landmarks include the [[atonality|atonal]] ending of [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s [[String quartets (Schoenberg)|Second String Quartet]] in 1908, the [[Expressionism|expressionist]] paintings of [[Wassily Kandinsky]] starting in 1903, and culminating with his first abstract painting and the founding of the [[Der Blaue Reiter|Blue Rider]] group in [[Munich]] in 1911, and the rise of [[fauvism]] and the inventions of [[cubism]] from the studios of [[Henri Matisse]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Georges Braque]], and others, in the years between 1900 and 1910.

An important aspect of modernism is how it relates to tradition through its adoption of techniques like reprise, incorporation, rewriting, recapitulation, revision and parody in new forms.&lt;ref name="Eco90"&gt;Eco (1990) p. 95 quote:{{quotation|Each of the types of repetition that we have examined is not limited to the mass media but belongs by right to the entire history of artistic creativity; [[plagiarism]], quotation, parody, the ironic retake are typical of the entire artistic-literary tradition.&lt;br&gt;Much art has been and is repetitive. The concept of absolute originality is a contemporary one, born with Romanticism; classical art was in vast measure serial, and the "modern" avant-garde (at the beginning of this century) challenged the Romantic idea of "creation from nothingness," with its techniques of [[collage]], mustachios on the [[Mona Lisa]], art about art, and so on.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Steiner98p489"&gt;Steiner (1998) pp. 489–490 quote:{{quotation|(pp. 489–490) The Modernist movement which dominated art, music, letters during the first half of the century was, at critical points, a strategy of conservation, of custodianship. Stravinsky's genius developed through phases of recapitulation. He took from [[Guillaume de Machaut|Machaut]], [[Carlo Gesualdo|Gesualdo]], [[Claudio Monteverdi|Monteverdi]]. He mimed [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]] and [[Charles Gounod|Gounod]], the [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] piano sonatas, the symphonies of [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]], the operas of [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi|Pergolesi]] and [[Mikhail Glinka|Glinka]]. He incorporated [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]] and [[Anton Webern|Webern]] into his own idiom. In each instance the listener was meant to recognize the source, to grasp the intent of a transformation which left salient aspects of the original intact. The history of Picasso is marked by retrospection. The explicit variations on classical pastoral themes, the citations from and ''pastiches'' of [[Rembrandt]], [[Francisco Goya|Goya]], [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]], Manet, are external products of a constant revision, a 'seeing again' in the light of technical and cultural shifts. Had we only Picasso's sculptures, graphics, and paintings, we could reconstruct a fair portion of the development of the arts from the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] to [[Paul Cézanne|Cézanne]]. In 20th-century literature, the elements of reprise have been obsessive, and they have organized precisely those texts which at first seemed most revolutionary. ''[[The Waste Land]]'', ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', Pound's ''[[The Cantos|Cantos]]'' are deliberate assemblages, in-gatherings of a cultural past felt to be in danger of dissolution. The long sequence of imitations, translations, masked quotations, and explicit historical paintings in [[Robert Lowell]]'s ''History'' has carried the same technique into the 1970s. [...] In Modernism ''collage'' has been the representative device. The new, even at its most scandalous, has been set against an informing background and framework of tradition. Stravinsky, Picasso, Braque, [[T. S. Eliot|Eliot]], [[James Joyce|Joyce]], [[Ezra Pound|Pound]]—the 'makers of the new'—have been neo-classics, often as observant of [[Western canon|canonic]] precedent as their 17th-century forebears.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[T. S. Eliot]] made significant comments on the relation of the artist to tradition, including: "[W]e shall often find that not only the best, but the most individual parts of [a poet's] work, may be those in which the dead poets, his ancestors, assert their immortality most vigorously."&lt;ref name="Eliot19"&gt;[[T. S. Eliot]] "Tradition and the individual talent" (1919), in ''Selected Essays''. Paperback edition. (Faber &amp; Faber, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the relationship of Modernism with tradition was complex, as literary scholar Peter Childs indicates: "There were paradoxical if not opposed trends towards revolutionary and reactionary positions, fear of the new and delight at the disappearance of the old, nihilism and fanatical enthusiasm, creativity and despair."&lt;ref name="Childs2000p17"&gt;Childs, Peter [https://books.google.com/books?id=x_WXXDeXqm4C&amp;pg=PA17&amp;lpg=PA17&amp;dq ''Modernism''] (Routledge, 2000). {{ISBN|0415196477}}. p. 17. Accessed on 8 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of how Modernist art can be both revolutionary and yet be related to past tradition, is the music of the composer [[Arnold Schoenberg]]. On the one hand Schoenberg rejected traditional [[tonality|tonal harmony]], the hierarchical system of organizing works of music that had guided music making for at least a century and a half. He believed he had discovered a wholly new way of organizing sound, based in the use of [[Twelve-tone technique|twelve-note rows]]. Yet while this was indeed wholly new, its origins can be traced back in the work of earlier composers, such as [[Franz Liszt]],&lt;ref&gt;Searle, ''New Grove'', 11:28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Wagner]], [[Gustav Mahler]], [[Richard Strauss]] and [[Max Reger]].&lt;ref&gt;*Anon. 2000.

Rochester, NY: Boydell Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it must be noted that Schoenberg also wrote tonal music throughout his career.

In the world of art, in the first decade of the 20th century, young painters such as [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Henri Matisse]] were causing a shock with their rejection of traditional [[perspective (visual)|perspective]] as the means of structuring paintings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.henri-matisse.net/biography.html| title=Biography of Henri Matisse| publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/themes/cubism| title=MoMA| publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the impressionist [[Monet]] had already been innovative in his use of perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/cmon/hd_cmon.htm| title=Claude Monet (1840–1926)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907, as Picasso was painting ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'', [[Oskar Kokoschka]] was writing ''Mörder, Hoffnung der Frauen'' (''Murderer, Hope of Women''), the first Expressionist play (produced with scandal in 1909), and Arnold Schoenberg was composing his String Quartet No.2 in F sharp minor (1908), his first composition without a tonal centre.

A primary influence that led to [[Cubism]] was the representation of three-dimensional form in the late works of [[Paul Cézanne]], which were displayed in a retrospective at the 1907 [[Salon d'Automne]].&lt;ref name="Christopher Green"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;displayall=1#skipToContent| title=The Collection| publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Cubist artwork, objects are analyzed, broken up and reassembled in an abstracted form; instead of depicting objects from one viewpoint, the artist depicts the subject from a multitude of viewpoints to represent the subject in a greater context.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Metzinger]], ''Note sur la peinture'', Pan (Paris), October–November 1910&lt;/ref&gt; Cubism was brought to the attention of the general public for the first time in 1911 at the [[Société des Artistes Indépendants|Salon des Indépendants]] in Paris (held 21 April&amp;nbsp;– 13 June). [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Fernand Léger]] and [[Roger de La Fresnaye]] were shown together in Room 41, provoking a 'scandal' out of which Cubism emerged and spread throughout Paris and beyond. Also in 1911, [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]] painted ''Bild mit Kreis'' (''Picture with a Circle''), which he later called the first abstract painting.&lt;ref name=Sheppard&gt;Richard Sheppard, ''Modernism–Dada–Postmodernism''. Northwestern Univ. Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|167}} In 1912, Metzinger and Gleizes wrote the first (and only) major Cubist manifesto, ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'', published in time for the Salon de la [[Section d'Or]], the largest Cubist exhibition to date. In 1912 Metzinger painted and exhibited his enchanting ''[[La Femme au Cheval]] (Woman with a Horse)'' and ''Danseuse au Café ([[Dancer in a Café]])''. Albert Gleizes painted and exhibited his ''[[Les Baigneuses (Gleizes)|Les Baigneuses (The Bathers)]]'' and his monumental ''Le Dépiquage des Moissons ([[Harvest Threshing]])''. This work, along with ''La Ville de Paris'' (''City of Paris'') by [[Robert Delaunay]], was the largest and most ambitious Cubist painting undertaken during the pre-War Cubist period.&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Daniel, ''Albert Gleizes 1881–1953, A Retrospective Exhibition'' (exh. cat.). The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, 1964, pp. 12–25&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, a group of four German artists, led by [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]], formed [[Die Brücke]] (the Bridge) in the city of [[Dresden]]. This was arguably the founding organization for the [[German Expressionist]] movement, though they did not use the word itself. A few years later, in 1911, a like-minded group of young artists formed [[Der Blaue Reiter]] (The Blue Rider) in Munich. The name came from [[Wassily Kandinsky]]'s ''Der Blaue Reiter'' painting of 1903. Among their members were Kandinsky, [[Franz Marc]], [[Paul Klee]], and [[August Macke]]. However, the term "Expressionism" did not firmly establish itself until 1913.&lt;ref name=Sheppard/&gt;{{rp|274}} Though initially mainly a German artistic movement,&lt;ref&gt;Note the parallel French movement Fauvism and the English [[Vorticism]]: "The Fauvist movement has been compared to German Expressionism, both projecting brilliant colors and spontaneous brushwork, and indebted to the same late nineteenth-century sources, especially [[Vincent van Gogh|Van Gogh]]." Sabine Rewald, "Fauvism". In ''Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History''. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000 [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/fauv/hd_fauv.htm (October 2004); and "Vorticism can be thought of as English Expressionism"]. Sherrill E. Grace, ''Regression and Apocalypse: Studies in North American Literary Expressionism''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1989, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; most predominant in painting, poetry and the theatre between 1910 and 1930, most precursors of the movement were not German. Furthermore, there have been expressionist writers of prose fiction, as well as non-German speaking expressionist writers, and, while the movement had declined in Germany with the rise of [[Adolf Hitler]] in the 1930s, there were subsequent expressionist works.
[[File:Egon Schiele 061.jpg|thumb|left|''Portrait of Eduard Kosmack'' (1910) by [[Egon Schiele]]]]
Expressionism is notoriously difficult to define, in part because it "overlapped with other major 'isms' of the modernist period: with [[Futurism]], [[Vorticism]], [[Cubism]], [[Surrealism]] and [[Dada]]."&lt;ref&gt;Sherrill E. Grace, ''Regression and Apocalypse: Studies in North American Literary Expressionism''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1989, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Murphy also comments: "the search for an all-inclusive definition is problematic to the extent that the most challenging expressionists" such as the novelist [[Franz Kafka]], poet [[Gottfried Benn]], and novelist [[Alfred Döblin]] were simultaneously the most vociferous anti-expressionists.&lt;ref name=Murphy&gt;Richard Murphy, ''Theorizing the Avant-Garde: Modernism, Expressionism, and the Problem of Postmodernity''. Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|43}} What, however, can be said, is that it was a movement that developed in the early 20th century mainly in Germany in reaction to the dehumanizing effect of industrialization and the growth of cities, and that "one of the central means by which expressionism identifies itself as an [[avant-garde]] movement, and by which it marks its distance to traditions and the cultural institution as a whole is through its relationship to [[Realism (arts)|realism]] and the dominant conventions of representation."&lt;ref name=Murphy/&gt;{{rp|43}} More explicitly: that the expressionists rejected the ideology of realism.&lt;ref name=Murphy/&gt;{{rp|43–48}} &lt;ref&gt;Walter H. Sokel, ''The Writer in Extremis''. Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 1959, especially Chapter One.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a concentrated Expressionist movement in early 20th century German theatre, of which [[Georg Kaiser]] and [[Ernst Toller]] were the most famous playwrights. Other notable Expressionist dramatists included [[Reinhard Sorge]], [[Walter Hasenclever]], [[Hans Henny Jahnn]], and [[Arnolt Bronnen]]. They looked back to Swedish playwright [[August Strindberg]] and German actor and dramatist [[Frank Wedekind]] as precursors of their [[dramaturgy|dramaturgical]] experiments. [[Oskar Kokoschka]]'s ''[[Murderer, the Hope of Women]]'' was the first fully Expressionist work for the theatre, which opened on 4 July 1909 in [[Vienna]].&lt;ref&gt;Berghaus (2005, 55–57).&lt;/ref&gt; The extreme simplification of characters to mythic [[archetype|types]], choral effects, declamatory dialogue and heightened intensity would become characteristic of later Expressionist plays. The first full-length Expressionist play was ''[[The Son (play)|The Son]]'' by Walter Hasenclever, which was published in 1914 and first performed in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;Rorrison (1998, 475) and Schürer (1997b, ix, xiv).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Futurism]] is yet another modernist movement. In 1909, the Parisian newspaper ''[[Le Figaro]]'' published [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti|F. T. Marinetti]]'s first manifesto. Soon afterwards a group of painters ([[Giacomo Balla]], [[Umberto Boccioni]], [[Carlo Carrà]], [[Luigi Russolo]], and [[Gino Severini]]) co-signed the [[Futurist Manifesto]]. Modeled on [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]]' famous "[[Communist Manifesto]]" (1848), such manifestoes put forward ideas that were meant to provoke and to gather followers. However, arguments in favor of geometric or purely abstract painting were, at this time, largely confined to "little magazines" which had only tiny circulations. Modernist primitivism and pessimism were controversial, and the mainstream in the first decade of the 20th century was still inclined towards a faith in progress and liberal optimism.

[[Abstract art|Abstract]] artists, taking as their examples the [[impressionists]], as well as [[Paul Cézanne]] (1839–1906) and [[Edvard Munch]] (1863–1944), began with the assumption that color and [[shape]], not the depiction of the natural world, formed the essential characteristics of art.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolph Arnheim, ''Visual Thinking''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Western art]] had been, from the [[Renaissance]] up to the middle of the 19th century, underpinned by the logic of [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]] and an attempt to reproduce an illusion of visible reality. The arts of cultures other than the European had become accessible and showed alternative ways of describing visual experience to the artist. By the end of the 19th century many artists felt a need to create a new kind of art which would encompass the fundamental changes taking place in technology, science and philosophy. The sources from which individual artists drew their theoretical arguments were diverse, and reflected the social and intellectual preoccupations in all areas of Western culture at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Mel Gooding, ''Abstract Art'', [[Tate Publishing Ltd|Tate Publishing]], London, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Piet Mondrian]], and [[Kazimir Malevich]] all believed in redefining art as the arrangement of pure color. The use of [[photography]], which had rendered much of the representational function of visual art obsolete, strongly affected this aspect of modernism.&lt;ref name="impressionism758"&gt;Sontag, Susan (1977) On Photography, Penguin, London&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Modern architecture|Modernist architects]] and designers, such as [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] and [[Le Corbusier]], believed that new technology rendered old styles of building obsolete. Le Corbusier thought that buildings should function as "machines for living in", analogous to cars, which he saw as machines for traveling in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/137221/Le-Corbusier| title=Le Corbusier| work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just as cars had replaced the horse, so modernist design should reject the old styles and structures inherited from [[Ancient Greece]] or from the [[Middle Ages]]. Following this machine aesthetic, modernist designers typically rejected decorative motifs in design, preferring to emphasize the materials used and pure geometrical forms.&lt;ref name="GEMbook"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsa.gov/graphics/pbs/GEMbook.pdf|title=Growth, Efficiency, and Modernism|last=|first=|year=2006|website=|publisher=U.S. General Services Administration|pages=14–15|accessdate=18 February 2017|origyear=2003|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110331105542/http://www.gsa.gov/graphics/pbs/GEMbook.pdf|archivedate=31 March 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[skyscraper]] is the archetypal modernist building, and the Wainwright Building, a 10-story office building built 1890–91, in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], United States, is among the [[early skyscrapers|first skyscrapers]] in the world.&lt;ref&gt;"Skyscraper."

[[File:Pedestal Table in the Studio.jpg|thumb|[[André Masson]], ''Pedestal Table in the Studio'' 1922, early example of [[Surrealism]]]]

In 1913—which was the year of philosopher [[Edmund Husserl]]'s ''Ideas'', physicist [[Niels Bohr]]'s quantized atom, [[Ezra Pound]]'s founding of [[imagism]], the [[Armory Show]] in New York, and in [[Saint Petersburg]] the "first futurist opera", [[Mikhail Matyushin]]'s ''[[Victory over the Sun]]''—another Russian composer, [[Igor Stravinsky]], composed ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'', a ballet that depicts [[human sacrifice]], and has a musical score full of dissonance and primitive rhythm. This caused uproar on its first performance in Paris. At this time though modernism was still "progressive", increasingly it saw traditional forms and traditional social arrangements as hindering progress, and was recasting the artist as a revolutionary, engaged in overthrowing rather than enlightening society. Also in 1913 a less violent event occurred in France with the publication of the first volume of [[Marcel Proust]]'s important novel sequence ''[[À la recherche du temps perdu]]'' (1913–1927) (''In Search of Lost Time''). This is often presented as an early example of a writer using the [[stream-of-consciousness technique]], but Robert Humphrey comments that Proust "is concerned only with the reminiscent aspect of consciousness" and that he "was deliberately recapturing the past for the purpose of communicating; hence he did not write a stream-of-consciousness novel."&lt;ref&gt;''Stream of Consciousness in the Modern Novel'' (Berkeley &amp; Los Angeles: University of California, 1954), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stream of consciousness was an important modernist literary innovation, and it has been suggested that [[Arthur Schnitzler]] (1862–1931) was the first to make full use of it in his short story "Leutnant Gustl" ("None but the Brave") (1900).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/133295/stream-of-consciousness Encyclopædia Britannica Online, ''Stream of Consciousness'']&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dorothy Richardson]] was the first English writer to use it, in the early volumes of her [[novel sequence]] ''[[Pilgrimage (novel sequence)|Pilgrimage]]'' (1915–67).&lt;ref&gt;In a review of these novels, in ''The Egoist'', April 1918, [[May Sinclair]] first applied the term "stream of consciousness" in a literary context, in her discussion of Richardson's stylistic innovations.&lt;/ref&gt; The other modernist novelists that are associated with the use of this narrative technique include [[James Joyce]] in ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' (1922) and [[Italo Svevo]] in ''[[Zeno's Conscience|La coscienza di Zeno]]'' (1923).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weiss|first=Beno|date=1990|title=Review of Italo Svevo: A Double Life|journal=Italica|volume=67|issue=3|pages=395–400|doi=10.2307/478649|jstor=478649|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, with the coming of the [[World War I|Great War]] of 1914–18 and the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917, the world was drastically changed and doubt cast on the beliefs and institutions of the past. The failure of the previous status quo seemed self-evident to a generation that had seen millions die fighting over scraps of earth: prior to 1914 it had been argued that no one would fight such a war, since the cost was too high. The birth of a machine age which had made major changes in the conditions of daily life in the 19th century now had radically changed the nature of warfare. The traumatic nature of recent experience altered basic assumptions, and realistic depiction of life in the arts seemed inadequate when faced with the fantastically surreal nature of [[trench warfare]]. The view that mankind was making steady moral progress now seemed ridiculous in the face of the senseless slaughter, described in works such as [[Erich Maria Remarque]]'s novel ''[[All Quiet on the Western Front]]'' (1929). Therefore, modernism's view of reality, which had been a minority taste before the war, became more generally accepted in the 1920s.

In literature and visual art some Modernists sought to defy expectations mainly in order to make their art more vivid, or to force the audience to take the trouble to question their own preconceptions. This aspect of modernism has often seemed a reaction to [[consumerism|consumer culture]], which developed in Europe and North America in the late 19th century. Whereas most manufacturers try to make products that will be marketable by appealing to preferences and prejudices, [[high modernism|high modernists]] rejected such consumerist attitudes in order to undermine conventional thinking. The art critic [[Clement Greenberg]] expounded this theory of modernism in his essay ''[[Avant-Garde and Kitsch]]''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Clement Greenberg]], ''Art and Culture,'' Beacon Press, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; Greenberg labeled the products of consumer culture "[[kitsch]]", because their design aimed simply to have maximum appeal, with any difficult features removed. For Greenberg, modernism thus formed a reaction against the development of such examples of modern consumer culture as commercial [[popular music]], [[Film|Hollywood]], and advertising. Greenberg associated this with the revolutionary rejection of capitalism.

Some Modernists saw themselves as part of a revolutionary culture that included political revolution. In [[Russia]] after the 1917 [[Russian Revolution|Revolution]] there was indeed initially a burgeoning of avant-garde cultural activity, which included [[Russian Futurism]]. However others rejected conventional politics as well as artistic conventions, believing that a revolution of [[political consciousness]] had greater importance than a change in political structures. But many modernists saw themselves as apolitical. Others, such as [[T. S. Eliot]], rejected mass [[popular culture]] from a conservative position. Some even argue that modernism in literature and art functioned to sustain an [[elitism|elite]] culture which excluded the majority of the population.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[Surrealism]], which originated in the early 1920s, came to be regarded by the public as the most extreme form of modernism, or "the avant-garde of Modernism".&lt;ref name="DebordSurrealismModernism"&gt;[[Guy Debord]], 18 November 1958, as quoted in [http://www.notbored.org/surrealism.html ''Supreme Height of the Defenders of Surrealism in Paris and the Revelation of their Real Value''], Situationist International #2&lt;/ref&gt; The word "surrealist" was coined by [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] and first appeared in the preface to his play ''[[The Breasts of Tiresias|Les Mamelles de Tirésias]]'', which was written in 1903 and first performed in 1917. Major surrealists include [[Paul Éluard]], [[Robert Desnos]],&lt;ref name="Diary of a Genius"&gt;[[Salvador Dalí|Dalí, Salvador]], ''[http://www.bartleby.com/66/82/15682.html Diary of a Genius]'' quoted in ''The Columbia World of Quotations'' (1996) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090406060625/http://www.bartleby.com/66/82/15682.html |date=6 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Ernst]], [[Hans Arp]], [[Antonin Artaud]], [[Raymond Queneau]], [[Joan Miró]], and [[Marcel Duchamp]].&lt;ref name=grove&gt;Dawn Ades, with Matthew Gale: "Surrealism", ''The Oxford Companion to Western Art''.

By 1930, Modernism had won a place in the establishment, including the political and artistic establishment, although by this time Modernism itself had changed.

===Modernism continues: 1930–1945===
Modernism continued to evolve during the 1930s. Between 1930 and 1932 composer [[Arnold Schoenberg]] worked on ''[[Moses und Aron]]'', one of the first operas to make use of the [[twelve-tone technique]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Schoenberg, Arnold (1874 - 1951), composer : Grove Music Online - oi|volume=1|language=en|doi=10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.25024|year=2001|last1=Neighbour|first1=O.W.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pablo Picasso painted in 1937 ''[[Guernica (Picasso)|Guernica]]'', his cubist condemnation of [[fascism]], while in 1939 [[James Joyce]] pushed the boundaries of the modern novel further with ''[[Finnegans Wake]]''. Also by 1930 Modernism began to influence mainstream culture, so that, for example,  ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine began publishing work, influenced by Modernism, by young writers and humorists like [[Dorothy Parker]],&lt;ref&gt;Caren Irr, "A Gendered Collision: Sentimentalism and Modernism in Dorothy Parker's Poetry and Fiction" (review).

''Modernist Cultures'', Volume 6, pp. 121–154.&lt;/ref&gt; Perelman is highly regarded for his humorous short stories that he published in magazines in the 1930s and 1940s, most often in ''The New Yorker'', which are considered to be the first examples of [[surrealist humor]] in America.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Barthelme]], 1982 interview in ''[[Partisan Review]]'', Volume 49, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern ideas in art also began to appear more frequently in commercials and logos, an early example of which, from 1916, is the famous [[London Underground]] logo designed by [[Edward Johnston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.20thcenturylondon.org.uk/server.php?show=conObject.2902 |work=Exploring 20th Century London |publisher=Renaissance London/[[Museums, Libraries and Archives Council|MLA]] |title=A full alphabet of Johnston wood letter types |accessdate=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most visible changes of this period was the adoption of new technologies into daily life of ordinary people in Western Europe and North America. Electricity, the telephone, the radio, the automobile—and the need to work with them, repair them and live with them—created social change. The kind of disruptive moment that only a few knew in the 1880s became a common occurrence. For example, the speed of communication reserved for the stock brokers of 1890 became part of family life, at least in middle class North America. Associated with urbanization and changing social mores also came smaller families and changed relationships between parents and their children.

Another strong influence at this time was [[Marxism]]. After the generally primitivistic/irrationalist aspect of pre-World War I Modernism, which for many Modernists precluded any attachment to merely political solutions, and the [[neoclassicism]] of the 1920s, as represented most famously by [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[Igor Stravinsky]]—which rejected popular solutions to modern problems—the rise of [[Fascism]], the [[Great Depression]], and the march to war helped to radicalise a generation. [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[W. H. Auden]], [[André Breton]], [[Louis Aragon]] and the philosophers [[Antonio Gramsci]] and [[Walter Benjamin]] are perhaps the most famous exemplars of this Modernist form of Marxism. There were, however, also Modernists explicitly of 'the right', including [[Salvador Dalí]], [[Wyndham Lewis]], T. S. Eliot, [[Ezra Pound]], the Dutch author [[Menno ter Braak]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;Pericles Lewis, "Modernist Writing and Reactionary Politics" (review). ''Modernism/modernity'', Volume 8, Number 4, November 2001, pp. 696–698.&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant Modernist literary works continued to be created in the 1920s and 1930s, including further novels by [[Marcel Proust]], [[Virginia Woolf]], [[Robert Musil]], and [[Dorothy Richardson]]. The American Modernist dramatist [[Eugene O'Neill]]'s career began in 1914, but his major works appeared in the 1920s, 1930s and early 1940s. Two other significant Modernist dramatists writing in the 1920s and 1930s were [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Federico García Lorca]]. [[D. H. Lawrence]]'s ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' was privately published in 1928, while another important landmark for the history of the modern novel came with the publication of [[William Faulkner]]'s ''[[The Sound and the Fury]]'' in 1929. In the 1930s, in addition to further major works by Faulkner, [[Samuel Beckett]] published his first major work, the novel ''[[Murphy (novel)|Murphy]]'' (1938). Then in 1939 James Joyce's ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' appeared. This is written in a largely [[idioglossia|idiosyncratic language]], consisting of a mixture of standard English [[lexical item]]s and [[Neologism|neologistic]] [[multilingual]] [[pun]]s and [[portmanteau]] words, which attempts to recreate the experience of sleep and dreams.&lt;ref&gt;James Mercanton (1967). ''Les heures de James Joyce''. Diffusion PUF.&lt;/ref&gt; In poetry T. S. Eliot, [[E. E. Cummings]], and [[Wallace Stevens]] were writing from the 1920s until the 1950s. While Modernist poetry in English is often viewed as an American phenomenon, with leading exponents including Ezra Pound, T. S. Eliot, [[Marianne Moore]], [[William Carlos Williams]], [[H.D.]], and [[Louis Zukofsky]], there were important British Modernist poets, including [[David Jones (artist-poet)|David Jones]], [[Hugh MacDiarmid]], [[Basil Bunting]], and [[W. H. Auden]]. European Modernist poets include [[Federico García Lorca]], [[Anna Akhmatova]], [[Constantine Cavafy]], and [[Paul Valéry]].

The Modernist movement continued during this period in [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]]. In 1930 composer [[Dimitri Shostakovich]]'s (1906–1975) opera ''[[The Nose (opera)|The Nose]]'' was premiered, in which he uses a [[Musical montage|montage]] of different styles, including [[folk music]], [[popular song]] and [[atonality]]. Amongst his influences was [[Alban Berg]]'s (1985–1935) opera ''[[Wozzeck]]'' (1925), which "had made a tremendous impression on Shostakovich when it was staged in Leningrad."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boosey.com/pages/opera/moreDetails.asp?musicID=896 Note by Gerard McBurney on ''The Nose'']&lt;/ref&gt; However, from 1932 [[Socialist realism]] began to oust Modernism in the Soviet Union,&lt;ref&gt;Sergei V. Ivanov, ''Unknown Socialist Realism. The Leningrad School'', pp. 28–29. {{ISBN|978-5901724217}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1936 Shostakovich was attacked and forced to withdraw his 4th Symphony.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Steinberg, ''The Symphony: A Listener's Guide''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995, pp. 541–545.&lt;/ref&gt; Alban Berg wrote another significant, though incomplete, Modernist opera, ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]'', which premiered in 1937. Berg's [[Violin Concerto (Berg)|Violin Concerto]] was first performed in 1935. Like Shostakovich, other composers faced difficulties in this period. In Germany [[Arnold Schoenberg]] (1874–1951) was forced to flee to the U.S. when Hitler came to power in 1933, because of his Modernist [[atonal]] style as well as his Jewish ancestry.&lt;ref name="Oxford Music Online"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com|title=Home Page in Oxford Music Online|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His major works from this period are a [[Violin Concerto (Schoenberg)|Violin Concerto]], Op. 36 (1934/36), and [[Piano Concerto (Schoenberg)|Piano Concerto]], Op. 42 (1942). Schoenberg also wrote tonal music in this period with the Suite for Strings in G major (1935) and the [[Chamber Symphony No. 2 (Schoenberg)|Chamber Symphony No. 2]] in E{{music|flat}} minor, Op. 38 (begun in 1906, completed in 1939).&lt;ref name="Oxford Music Online" /&gt; During this time Hungarian Modernist [[Béla Bartók]] (1881–1945) produced a number of major works, including ''[[Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta]]'' (1936) and the ''[[Divertimento for String Orchestra (Bartók)|Divertimento for String Orchestra]]'' (1939), [[String Quartet No. 5 (Bartók)|String Quartet No. 5]] (1934), and [[String Quartet No. 6 (Bartók)|No. 6]] (his last, 1939). But he too left for the US in 1940, because of the rise of [[fascism]] in Hungary.&lt;ref name="Oxford Music Online" /&gt; [[Igor Stravinsky]] (1882–1971) continued writing in his [[neoclassical style]] during the 1930s and 1940s, writing works like the ''[[Symphony of Psalms]]'' (1930), [[Symphony in C (Stravinsky)|Symphony in C]] (1940) and ''[[Symphony in Three Movements (Stravinsky)|Symphony in Three Movements]]'' (1945). He also emigrated to the US because of World War II. [[Olivier Messiaen]] (1908–1992), however, served in the French army during the war and was imprisoned at [[Stalag VIII-A]] by the Germans, where he composed his famous ''[[Quatuor pour la fin du temps]]'' ("Quartet for the End of Time"). The quartet was first performed in January 1941 to an audience of prisoners and prison guards.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Rischin. ''For the End of Time: The Story of the Messiaen Quartet''. Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 2003, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In painting, during the 1920s and the 1930s and the [[Great Depression]], modernism is defined by [[Surrealism]], late [[Cubism]], [[Bauhaus]], [[De Stijl]], [[Dada]], German [[Expressionism]], and Modernist and masterful color painters like [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Pierre Bonnard]] as well as the abstractions of artists like [[Piet Mondrian]] and [[Wassily Kandinsky]] which characterized the European art scene. In Germany, [[Max Beckmann]], [[Otto Dix]], [[George Grosz]] and others politicized their paintings, foreshadowing the coming of World War II, while in America, modernism is seen in the form of [[American Scene painting]] and the [[social realism]] and [[regionalism (art)|regionalism]] movements that contained both political and social commentary dominated the art world. Artists like [[Ben Shahn]], [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]], [[Grant Wood]], [[George Tooker]], [[John Steuart Curry]], [[Reginald Marsh (artist)|Reginald Marsh]], and others became prominent. Modernism is defined in [[Latin America]] by painters [[Joaquín Torres García]] from Uruguay and [[Rufino Tamayo]] from Mexico, while the [[Mexican muralism|muralist movement]] with [[Diego Rivera]], [[David Siqueiros]], [[José Clemente Orozco]], [[Pedro Nel Gómez]] and [[Santiago Martinez Delgado]], and [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] paintings by [[Frida Kahlo]], began a renaissance of the arts for the region, characterized by a freer use of color and an emphasis on political messages.

Diego Rivera is perhaps best known by the public world for his 1933 mural, ''[[Man at the Crossroads]]'', in the lobby of the RCA Building at [[Rockefeller Center]]. When his patron [[Nelson Rockefeller]] discovered that the mural included a portrait of [[Vladimir Lenin]] and other communist imagery, he fired Rivera, and the unfinished work was eventually destroyed by Rockefeller's staff. Frida Kahlo's (Rivera's wife's) works are often characterized by their stark portrayals of pain. Kahlo was deeply influenced by indigenous Mexican culture, which is apparent in her paintings' bright colors and dramatic symbolism. Christian and Jewish themes are often depicted in her work as well; she combined elements of the classic religious Mexican tradition, which were often bloody and violent. Frida Kahlo's Symbolist works relate strongly to Surrealism and to the [[Magic Realism]] movement in literature.

Political activism was an important piece of David Siqueiros' life, and frequently inspired him to set aside his artistic career. His art was deeply rooted in the [[Mexican Revolution]]. The period from the 1920s to the 1950s is known as the Mexican Renaissance, and Siqueiros was active in the attempt to create an art that was at once Mexican and universal. The young [[Jackson Pollock]] attended the workshop and helped build [[float (parade)|floats]] for the parade.

During the 1930s radical leftist politics characterized many of the artists connected to Surrealism, including [[Pablo Picasso]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Helena. ''Dada Turns Red''. 1990. University of Edinburgh Press. A history of the uneasy relations between Surrealists and Communists from the 1920s through the 1950s.&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 April 1937, during the [[Spanish Civil War]], the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque]] town of [[Gernika]] was [[Bombing of Guernica|bombed]] by Nazi Germany's Luftwaffe. The Germans were attacking to support the efforts of [[Francisco Franco]] to overthrow the Basque government and the Spanish Republican government. Pablo Picasso painted his mural-sized ''[[Guernica (Picasso)|Guernica]]'' to commemorate the horrors of the bombing.

During the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s and through the years of World War II, American art was characterized by [[Social Realism]] and [[American Scene Painting]], in the work of [[Grant Wood]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Ben Shahn]], [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]], and several others. ''[[Nighthawks]]'' (1942) is a painting by Edward Hopper that portrays people sitting in a downtown diner late at night. It is not only Hopper's most famous painting, but one of the most recognizable in American art. The scene was inspired by a diner in [[Greenwich Village]]. Hopper began painting it immediately after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. After this event there was a large feeling of gloominess over the country, a feeling that is portrayed in the painting. The urban street is empty outside the diner, and inside none of the three patrons is apparently looking or talking to the others but instead is lost in their own thoughts. This portrayal of modern urban life as empty or lonely is a common theme throughout Hopper's work.

''[[American Gothic]]'' is a painting by [[Grant Wood]] from 1930. Portraying a [[pitchfork]]-holding farmer and a younger woman in front of a house of [[Carpenter Gothic]] style, it is one of the most familiar images in 20th-century [[Visual art of the United States|American art]]. Art critics had favorable opinions about the painting; like [[Gertrude Stein]] and [[Christopher Morley]], they assumed the painting was meant to be a satire of rural small-town life. It was thus seen as part of the trend towards increasingly critical depictions of rural America, along the lines of [[Sherwood Anderson]]'s 1919 ''[[Winesburg, Ohio]]'', [[Sinclair Lewis]]'s 1920 ''[[Main Street (novel)|Main Street]]'', and [[Carl Van Vechten]]'s ''The Tattooed Countess'' in literature.&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;Fineman, Mia, [http://www.slate.com/id/2120494/ The Most Famous Farm Couple in the World: Why American Gothic still fascinates.], ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', 8 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the onset of the Great Depression, the painting came to be seen as a depiction of steadfast American pioneer spirit.

The situation for artists in Europe during the 1930s deteriorated rapidly as the Nazis' power in Germany and across Eastern Europe increased. ''[[Degenerate art]]'' was a term adopted by the [[Nazi]] regime in Germany for virtually all [[modern art]]. Such art was banned on the grounds that it was un-German or [[Jewish Bolshevism|Jewish Bolshevist]] in nature, and those identified as degenerate artists were subjected to sanctions. These included being dismissed from teaching positions, being forbidden to exhibit or to sell their art, and in some cases being forbidden to produce art entirely. [[Degenerate Art Exhibition|Degenerate Art]] was also the title of an exhibition, mounted by the Nazis in [[Munich]] in 1937. The climate became so hostile for artists and art associated with modernism and [[Abstract art|abstraction]] that many left for the Americas. German artist [[Max Beckmann]] and scores of others fled Europe for New York. In New York City a new generation of young and exciting Modernist painters led by [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Willem de Kooning]], and others were just beginning to come of age.

Arshile Gorky's portrait of someone who might be Willem de Kooning is an example of the evolution of [[abstract expressionism]] from the context of figure painting, cubism and surrealism. Along with his friends de Kooning and [[John D. Graham]], Gorky created biomorphically shaped and abstracted figurative compositions that by the 1940s evolved into totally abstract paintings. Gorky's work seems to be a careful analysis of memory, emotion and shape, using line and color to express feeling and nature.

===Introduction===
While ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of British Literature'' states that modernism ended by c. 1939&lt;ref name="British Literature' 2006"&gt;J. H. Dettmar, "Modernism", in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of British Literature'', ed. David Scott Kastan. Oxford University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; with regard to British and American literature, "When (if) Modernism petered out and postmodernism began has been contested almost as hotly as when the transition from Victorianism to Modernism occurred."&lt;ref&gt;"Modernism", in ''The Oxford Companion to English Literature'', ed. Dinah Birch. Oxford University Press Inc. Oxford Reference Online.&lt;/ref&gt;  Clement Greenberg sees modernism ending in the 1930s, with the exception of the visual and performing arts,&lt;ref name=Greenberg/&gt; but with regard to music, [[Paul Griffiths (writer)|Paul Griffiths]] notes that, while Modernism "seemed to be a spent force" by the late 1920s, after World War II, "a new generation of composers—[[Pierre Boulez|Boulez]], [[Jean Barraqué|Barraqué]], [[Milton Babbitt|Babbitt]], [[Luigi Nono|Nono]], [[Karlheinz Stockhausen|Stockhausen]], [[Iannis Xenakis|Xenakis]]" revived modernism".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Griffiths, "Modernism", ''The Oxford Companion to Music'', ed. Alison Latham. Oxford University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact many literary Modernists lived into the 1950s and 1960s, though generally they were no longer producing major works. The term "[[late modernism]]" is also sometimes applied to Modernist works published after 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Cheryl Hindrichs, "Late Modernism, 1928–1945: Criticism and Theory", ''Literature Compass'', Volume 8, Issue 11, pp. 840–855, November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. H. Dettmar, "Modernism", ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of British Literature'', ed. David Scott Kastan. Oxford University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Among Modernists (or late Modernists) still publishing after 1945 were [[Wallace Stevens]], [[Gottfried Benn]], [[T. S. Eliot]], [[Anna Akhmatova]], [[William Faulkner]], [[Dorothy Richardson]], [[John Cowper Powys]], and [[Ezra Pound]]. [[Basil Bunting]], born in 1901, published his most important Modernist poem ''[[Briggflatts]]'' in 1965. In addition, [[Hermann Broch]]'s ''[[The Death of Virgil]]'' was published in 1945 and [[Thomas Mann]]'s ''[[Doctor Faustus (novel)|Doctor Faustus]]'' in 1947. [[Samuel Beckett]], who died in 1989, has been described as a "later Modernist".&lt;ref&gt;Morris Dickstein, "An Outsider to His Own Life", Books, ''The New York Times'', 3 August 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Beckett is a writer with roots in the [[expressionist]] tradition of Modernism, who produced works from the 1930s until the 1980s, including ''[[Molloy (novel)|Molloy]]'' (1951), ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' (1953), ''[[Happy Days (play)|Happy Days]]'' (1961), and ''[[Rockaby]]'' (1981). The terms "[[minimalist]]" and "[[post-Modernist]]" have also been applied to his later works.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge Companion to Irish Literature'', ed. John Wilson Foster. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The poets [[Charles Olson]] (1910–1970) and [[J. H. Prynne]] (born 1936) are among the writers in the second half of the 20th century who have been described as late Modernists.&lt;ref&gt;''Late Modernist Poetics: From Pound to Prynne'' by Anthony Mellors; see also Prynne's publisher, Bloodaxe Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently the term "late modernism" has been redefined by at least one critic and used to refer to works written after 1945, rather than 1930. With this usage goes the idea that the ideology of modernism was significantly re-shaped by the events of [[World War II]], especially [[the Holocaust]] and the dropping of the atom bomb.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Mellors, ''Late Modernist Poetics: From Pound to Prynne''&lt;/ref&gt;

The postwar period left the capitals of Europe in upheaval with an urgency to economically and physically rebuild and to politically regroup. In [[Paris]] (the former center of European culture and the former capital of the art world) the climate for art was a disaster. Important collectors, dealers, and Modernist artists, writers, and poets had fled Europe for New York and America. The [[surrealists]] and modern artists from every cultural center of Europe had fled the onslaught of the Nazis for safe haven in the United States. Many of those who didn't flee perished. A few artists, notably [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Henri Matisse]], and [[Pierre Bonnard]], remained in France and survived.

The 1940s in New York City heralded the triumph of American [[abstract expressionism]], a Modernist movement that combined lessons learned from Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, surrealism, [[Joan Miró]], cubism, [[Fauvism]], and early modernism via great teachers in America like [[Hans Hofmann]] and [[John D. Graham]]. American artists benefited from the presence of [[Piet Mondrian]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Max Ernst]] and the [[André Breton]] group, [[Pierre Matisse]]'s gallery, and [[Peggy Guggenheim]]'s gallery ''[[The Art of This Century]]'', as well as other factors.

Paris, moreover, recaptured much of its luster in the 1950s and 60s as the center of a machine art florescence, with both of the leading machine art sculptors [[Jean Tinguely]] and [[Nicolas Schöffer]] having moved there to launch their careers—and which florescence, in light of the technocentric character of modern life, may well have a particularly long lasting influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.mdpi.com/2076-0752/7/1/4|author=Juliette Bessette|date=23 January 2018|title=The Machine as Art (in the 20th Century): An Introduction|journal=Arts|volume=7|page=4|doi=10.3390/arts7010004|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theatre of the Absurd===
[[File:En attendant Godot, Festival d'Avignon, 1978.jpeg|left|thumb|Samuel Beckett's ''[[En attendant Godot]]'', (''Waiting for Godot'') Festival d'Avignon, 1978]]
The term "[[Theatre of the Absurd]]" is applied to plays, written primarily by Europeans, that express the belief that human existence has no meaning or purpose and therefore all communication breaks down. Logical construction and argument gives way to irrational and illogical speech and to its ultimate conclusion, silence.&lt;ref&gt;''The Hutchinson Encyclopedia'', Millennium Edition, Helicon 1999&lt;/ref&gt; While there are significant precursors, including [[Alfred Jarry]] (1873–1907), the Theatre of the Absurd is generally seen as beginning in the 1950s with the plays of [[Samuel Beckett]].

Critic [[Martin Esslin]] coined the term in his 1960 essay "Theatre of the Absurd". He related these plays based on a broad theme of the Absurd, similar to the way [[Albert Camus]] uses the term in his 1942 essay, ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/Slavonic/Absurd.htm University of Glasgow, School of Modern Languages and Cultures] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090823075755/http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/Slavonic/Absurd.htm |date=23 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Absurd in these plays takes the form of man's reaction to a world apparently without meaning, and/or man as a puppet controlled or menaced by invisible outside forces. Though the term is applied to a wide range of plays, some characteristics coincide in many of the plays: broad comedy, often similar to [[vaudeville]], mixed with horrific or tragic images; characters caught in hopeless situations forced to do repetitive or meaningless actions; dialogue full of clichés, wordplay, and nonsense; plots that are cyclical or absurdly expansive; either a parody or dismissal of realism and the concept of the "[[well-made play]]".

Playwrights commonly associated with the Theatre of the Absurd include [[Samuel Beckett]] (1906–1989), [[Eugène Ionesco]] (1909–1994), [[Jean Genet]] (1910–1986), [[Harold Pinter]] (1930–2008), [[Tom Stoppard]] (born 1937), [[Alexander Vvedensky (poet)|Alexander Vvedensky]] (1904–1941), [[Daniil Kharms]] (1905–1942), [[Friedrich Dürrenmatt]] (1921–1990), [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]] (born 1929), [[Fernando Arrabal]] (born 1932), [[Václav Havel]] (1936–2011) and [[Edward Albee]] (1928–2016).

===Pollock and abstract influences===
During the late 1940s [[Jackson Pollock]]'s radical approach to painting revolutionized the potential for all [[contemporary art]] that followed him. To some extent Pollock realized that the journey toward making a work of art was as important as the work of art itself. Like [[Pablo Picasso]]'s innovative reinventions of painting and sculpture in the early 20th century via [[Cubism]] and constructed [[sculpture]], Pollock redefined the way art is made. His move away from easel painting and conventionality was a liberating signal to the artists of his era and to all who came after. Artists realized that Jackson Pollock's process—placing unstretched raw [[canvas]] on the floor where it could be attacked from all four sides using artistic and industrial materials; dripping and throwing linear skeins of paint; drawing, staining, and brushing; using imagery and nonimagery—essentially blasted artmaking beyond any prior boundary. Abstract expressionism generally expanded and developed the definitions and possibilities available to artists for the creation of new works of art.
The other [[abstract expressionists]] followed Pollock's breakthrough with new breakthroughs of their own. In a sense the innovations of Jackson Pollock, [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Franz Kline]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Philip Guston]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Peter Voulkos]] and others opened the floodgates to the diversity and scope of all the art that followed them. Rereadings into abstract art by art historians such as [[Linda Nochlin]],&lt;ref&gt;Nochlin, Linda, Ch.1 in: ''Women Artists at the Millennium'' (edited by C. Armstrong and C. de Zegher) MIT Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Griselda Pollock]]&lt;ref&gt;Pollock, Griselda, ''Encounters in the Virtual Feminist Museum: Time, Space and the Archive''. Routledge, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Catherine de Zegher]]&lt;ref&gt;De Zegher, Catherine, and Teicher, Hendel (eds.), ''3 X Abstraction''. New Haven: Yale University Press. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; critically show, however, that pioneering women artists who produced major innovations in modern art had been ignored by official accounts of its history.

===International figures from British art===
[[Henry Moore]] (1898–1986) emerged after [[World War II]] as Britain's leading [[Sculpture|sculptor]]. He was best known for his semi-[[abstract art|abstract]] monumental bronze sculptures which are located around the world as public works of art. His forms are usually abstractions of the human figure, typically depicting mother-and-child or reclining figures, usually suggestive of the female body, apart from a phase in the 1950s when he sculpted family groups. His forms are generally pierced or contain hollow spaces.
[[File:Moore_Große_liegende_Frauenfigur_1957_Zürich.jpg|thumb|right|[[Henry Moore]], ''Reclining Figure'' (1957). In front of the [[Kunsthaus Zürich]], Switzerland.]]

In the 1950s, Moore began to receive increasingly significant commissions, including a reclining figure for the [[UNESCO]] building in Paris in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.unesco.org/artcollection/DetailAction.do?&amp;idOeuvre=1547&amp;nouvelleLangue=en Moore, Henry]". [[UNESCO]]. Retrieved on 16 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; With many more public works of art, the scale of Moore's sculptures grew significantly. The last three decades of Moore's life continued in a similar vein, with several major retrospectives taking place around the world, notably a prominent exhibition in the summer of 1972 in the grounds of the [[Belvedere (fort)|Forte di Belvedere]] overlooking [[Florence]]. By the end of the 1970s, there were some 40 exhibitions a year featuring his work. On the campus of the [[University of Chicago]] in December 1967, 25 years to the minute after the team of physicists led by [[Enrico Fermi]] achieved the first controlled, self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction, Moore's ''[[Nuclear Energy (sculpture)|Nuclear Energy]]'' was unveiled.&lt;ref&gt;2 December 1967.

''Henry Moore: Space, Sculpture, Politics''. Burlington, Vermont: Ashgate, 2003. p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in Chicago, Moore commemorated science with a large bronze sundial, locally named ''[[Man Enters the Cosmos]]'' (1980), which was commissioned to recognise the [[space exploration]] program.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:20070701 Man Enters The Cosmos Explanatory Plaques.JPG|Enscripted on the plaque at the base of the sculpture]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The "London School" of figurative painters, including [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]] (1909–1992), [[Lucian Freud]] (1922–2011), [[Frank Auerbach]] (born 1931), [[Leon Kossoff]] (born 1926), and [[Michael Andrews (artist)|Michael Andrews]] (1928–1995), have received widespread international recognition.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, 219–225&lt;/ref&gt;

Francis Bacon was an Irish-born British figurative painter known for his bold, graphic and emotionally raw imagery.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Harrison, ''In Camera: Francis Bacon: Photography, Film and the Practice of Painting'', London: Thames and Hudson, 2006, 7&lt;/ref&gt; His painterly but abstracted figures typically appear isolated in glass or steel geometrical cages set against flat, nondescript backgrounds. Bacon began painting during his early 20s but worked only sporadically until his mid-30s. His breakthrough came with the 1944 [[triptych]] ''[[Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion]]'' which sealed his reputation as a uniquely bleak chronicler of the human condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/francis_bacon/index.html?inline=nyt-per| title=Francis Bacon| author=Ken Johnson| date=3 December 2015| publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His output can be crudely described as consisting of sequences or variations on a single motif; beginning with the 1940s male heads isolated in rooms, the early 1950s screaming popes, and mid to late 1950s animals and lone figures suspended in geometric structures. These were followed by his early 1960s modern variations of the crucifixion in the triptych format. From the mid-1960s to early 1970s, Bacon mainly produced strikingly compassionate portraits of friends. Following the suicide of his lover George Dyer in 1971, his art became more personal, inward-looking, and preoccupied with themes and motifs of death. During his lifetime, Bacon was equally reviled and acclaimed.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', "Obituary", 29 April 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lucian Freud]] was a German-born British painter, known chiefly for his thickly [[impasto]]ed portrait and figure paintings, who was widely considered the pre-eminent British artist of his time.&lt;ref name=Grimes&gt;William Grimes.

Ordinary people—many of them his friends—stared wide-eyed from the canvas, vulnerable to the artist's ruthless inspection."&lt;ref name=Grimes/&gt;

===In the 1960s after abstract expressionism===
{{Main|Post-painterly abstraction|Color Field|Lyrical abstraction|Arte Povera|Process art|Western painting}}
In [[abstract art|abstract painting]] during the 1950s and 1960s several new directions like [[hard-edge painting]] and other forms of [[geometric abstraction]] began to appear in artist studios and in radical [[avant-garde]] circles as a reaction against the subjectivism of abstract expressionism. [[Clement Greenberg]] became the voice of [[post-painterly abstraction]] when he curated an influential exhibition of new painting that toured important art museums throughout the United States in 1964. [[Color Field]] painting, hard-edge painting and [[lyrical abstraction]]&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich, Larry. "Young Lyrical Painters", ''Art in America'', v. 57, n. 6, November–December 1969, pp. 104–113.&lt;/ref&gt; emerged as radical new directions.

By the late 1960s however, [[postminimalism]], [[process art]] and [[Arte Povera]]&lt;ref name="Shakers, New York 2007"&gt;Sarah Douglas, ''Movers and Shakers, New York'', "Leaving C&amp;M", ''[[Art+Auction]]'', March 2007, V.XXXNo7.&lt;/ref&gt; also emerged as revolutionary concepts and movements that encompassed both painting and sculpture, via lyrical abstraction and the postminimalist movement, and in early [[conceptual art]].&lt;ref name="Shakers, New York 2007"/&gt; Process art as inspired by Pollock enabled artists to experiment with and make use of a diverse encyclopedia of style, content, material, placement, sense of time, and plastic and real space. [[Nancy Graves]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[Howard Hodgkin]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Jannis Kounellis]], [[Brice Marden]], [[Colin McCahon]], [[Bruce Nauman]], [[Richard Tuttle]], [[Alan Saret]], [[Walter Darby Bannard]], [[Lynda Benglis]], [[Dan Christensen]], [[Larry Zox]], [[Ronnie Landfield]], [[Eva Hesse]], [[Keith Sonnier]], [[Richard Serra]], [[Sam Gilliam]], [[Mario Merz]] and [[Peter Reginato]] were some of the younger artists who emerged during the era of [[late modernism]] that spawned the heyday of the art of the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Ann Ray, and Howard Junker. "The New Art: It's Way, Way Out", ''Newsweek'', 29 July 1968: pp. 3, 55–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pop art===
[[File:I was a Rich Man's Plaything 1947.jpg|thumb|[[Eduardo Paolozzi]]. ''I was a Rich Man's Plaything'' (1947) is considered the initial standard bearer of "pop art" and first to display the word "pop".]]
{{Main|Pop art|Western painting}}
In 1962 the [[Sidney Janis]] Gallery mounted ''The New Realists'', the first major [[pop art]] group exhibition in an uptown art gallery in New York City. Janis mounted the exhibition in a 57th Street storefront near his gallery. The show sent shockwaves through the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] and reverberated worldwide. Earlier in England in 1958 the term "Pop Art" was used by [[Lawrence Alloway]] to describe paintings that celebrated the [[consumerism]] of the post World War II era. This movement rejected abstract expressionism and its focus on the [[hermeneutic]] and psychological interior in favor of art that depicted and often celebrated material consumer culture, advertising, and iconography of the mass production age. The early works of [[David Hockney]] and the works of [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]] and [[Eduardo Paolozzi]] (who created the groundbreaking ''I was a Rich Man's Plaything'', 1947) are considered seminal examples in the movement. Meanwhile, in the downtown scene in New York's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] 10th Street galleries, artists were formulating an American version of pop art. [[Claes Oldenburg]] had his storefront, and the [[Green Gallery]] on 57th Street began to show the works of [[Tom Wesselmann]] and [[James Rosenquist]]. Later [[Leo Castelli]] exhibited the works of other American artists, including those of [[Andy Warhol]] and [[Roy Lichtenstein]] for most of their careers. There is a connection between the radical works of [[Marcel Duchamp]] and [[Man Ray]], the rebellious [[Dada]]ists with a sense of humor, and pop artists like Claes Oldenburg, Andy Warhol, and Roy Lichtenstein, whose paintings reproduce the look of [[Ben-Day dots]], a technique used in commercial reproduction.

===Minimalism===
{{Main|Minimalism|Minimal music|Literary minimalism|Postminimalism|20th-century Western painting}}
[[Minimalism]] describes movements in various forms of art and design, especially [[Visual arts|visual art]] and [[Minimal music|music]], wherein artists intend to expose the essence or identity of a subject through eliminating all nonessential forms, features, or concepts. Minimalism is any design or style wherein the simplest and fewest elements are used to create the maximum effect.

As a specific movement in the arts it is identified with developments in post–World War II Western art, most strongly with American visual arts in the 1960s and early 1970s. Prominent artists associated with this movement include [[Donald Judd]], [[John McCracken (artist)|John McCracken]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Ronald Bladen]], [[Anne Truitt]], and [[Frank Stella]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Want, "Minimalism" in ''Grove Art Online''. Oxford University Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It derives from the reductive aspects of modernism and is often interpreted as a reaction against [[Abstract expressionism]] and a bridge to [[Postminimalism|Postminimal]] art practices. By the early 1960s minimalism emerged as an abstract movement in art (with roots in the [[geometric abstraction]] of [[Kazimir Malevich]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/384056/minimalism| title=Minimalism| work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Bauhaus]] and [[Piet Mondrian]]) that rejected the idea of relational and subjective painting, the complexity of [[abstract expressionist]] surfaces, and the emotional [[zeitgeist]] and polemics present in the arena of [[action painting]]. Minimalism argued that extreme simplicity could capture all of the sublime representation needed in art. Minimalism is variously construed either as a precursor to [[postmodernism]], or as a postmodern movement itself. In the latter perspective, early minimalism yielded advanced Modernist works, but the movement partially abandoned this direction when some artists like [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]] changed direction in favor of the [[anti-form movement]].

Hal Foster, in his essay ''The Crux of Minimalism'',&lt;ref name="Hal Foster 1996, pp44-53"&gt;Hal Foster, ''The Return of the Real: The Avant-garde at the End of the Century'', MIT Press, 1996, pp. 44–53. {{ISBN|0262561077}}&lt;/ref&gt; examines the extent to which Donald Judd and Robert Morris both acknowledge and exceed Greenbergian Modernism in their published definitions of minimalism.&lt;ref name="Hal Foster 1996, pp44-53"/&gt; He argues that minimalism is not a "dead end" of Modernism, but a "paradigm shift toward postmodern practices that continue to be elaborated today."&lt;ref name="Hal Foster 1996, pp44-53"/&gt;

The terms have expanded to encompass a movement in music that features such repetition and iteration as those of the compositions of [[La Monte Young]], [[Terry Riley]], [[Steve Reich]], [[Philip Glass]], and [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]]. Minimalist compositions are sometimes known as [[systems music]]. The term "minimalist" often colloquially refers to anything that is spare or stripped to its essentials. It has also been used to describe the [[Play (theatre)|plays]] and [[novel]]s of [[Samuel Beckett]], the films of [[Robert Bresson]], the stories of [[Raymond Carver]], and the automobile designs of [[Colin Chapman]].

====Postminimalism====
[[File:Spiral-jetty-from-rozel-point.png|thumb|left|Smithson's ''[[Spiral Jetty]]'' from atop Rozel Point, Utah, US, in mid-April 2005. Created in 1970, it still exists although it has often been submerged by the fluctuating lake level. It consists of some 6500 [[ton]]s of [[basalt]], earth and salt.]]
In the late 1960s [[Robert Pincus-Witten]]&lt;ref name="Shakers, New York 2007"/&gt; coined the term "[[postminimalism]]" to describe minimalist-derived art which had content and contextual overtones that minimalism rejected. The term was applied by Pincus-Whitten to the work of [[Eva Hesse]], [[Keith Sonnier]], [[Richard Serra]] and new work by former minimalists [[Robert Smithson]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Barry Le Va]], and others. Other minimalists including [[Donald Judd]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Carl Andre]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[John McCracken (artist)|John McCracken]] and others continued to produce late Modernist paintings and sculpture for the remainders of their careers.

Since then, many artists have embraced minimal or postminimal styles, and the label "Postmodern" has been attached to them.

====Collage, assemblage, installations====
{{Main|Collage|Assemblage (art)|Installation art}}
Related to [[abstract expressionism]] was the emergence of combining manufactured items with artist materials, moving away from previous conventions of painting and sculpture. The work of [[Robert Rauschenberg]] exemplifies this trend. His "combines" of the 1950s were forerunners of [[pop art]] and [[installation art]], and used assemblages of large physical objects, including stuffed animals, birds and commercial photographs. Rauschenberg, [[Jasper Johns]], [[Larry Rivers]], [[John Chamberlain (sculptor)|John Chamberlain]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]], [[Jim Dine]], and [[Edward Kienholz]] were among important pioneers of both abstraction and pop art. Creating new conventions of art-making, they made acceptable in serious contemporary art circles the radical inclusion in their works of unlikely materials. Another pioneer of collage was [[Joseph Cornell]], whose more intimately scaled works were seen as radical because of both his personal iconography and his use of [[found object]]s.

====Neo-Dada====
{{Main|Neo-Dada}}

In the early 20th century [[Marcel Duchamp]] submitted for exhibition a [[urinal]] as a sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/duchamp-fountain-t07573/text-summary| title='Fountain', Marcel Duchamp: Summary -  - Tate| work=Tate}}&lt;/ref&gt; He professed his intent that people look at the urinal as if it were a work of art because he said it was a work of art. He referred to his work as "[[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymades]]". ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' was a urinal signed with the pseudonym "R. Mutt", the exhibition of which shocked the art world in 1917. This and Duchamp's other works are generally labelled as Dada. Duchamp can be seen as a precursor to conceptual art, other famous examples being [[John Cage]]'s ''[[4'33"]]'', which is four minutes and thirty three seconds of silence, and Rauschenberg's ''[[Erased de Kooning Drawing]]''. Many conceptual works take the position that art is the result of the viewer viewing an object or act as art, not of the intrinsic qualities of the work itself. In choosing "an ordinary article of life" and creating "a new thought for that object" Duchamp invited onlookers to view ''Fountain'' as a sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://sdrc.lib.uiowa.edu/dada/blindman/2/05.htm| title=Blindman No. 2| publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcel Duchamp famously gave up "art" in favor of [[chess]]. Avant-garde composer [[David Tudor]] created a piece, ''Reunion'' (1968), written jointly with Lowell Cross, that features a chess game in which each move triggers a lighting effect or projection. Duchamp and Cage played the game at the work's premier.&lt;ref&gt;Craig Owens, ''Beyond Recognition: Representation, Power, and Culture'', London and Berkeley: University of California Press (1992), pp. 74–75.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Steven Best]] and [[Douglas Kellner]] identify Rauschenberg and [[Jasper Johns]] as part of the transitional phase, influenced by Duchamp, between Modernism and Postmodernism. Both used images of ordinary objects, or the objects themselves, in their work, while retaining the abstraction and painterly gestures of high Modernism.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Best, Douglas Kellner, ''The Postmodern Turn'', Guilford Press, 1997, p. 174. {{ISBN|1572302216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Performance and happenings====
{{Main|Performance art|Happening|Fluxus}}
[[File:Schneemann-Interior Scroll.gif|thumb|left|[[Carolee Schneemann]], performing her piece ''Interior Scroll, 1975.'' |upright=0.75|[[Yves Klein]] in [[France]], and [[Carolee Schneemann]] (pictured), [[Yayoi Kusama]], [[Charlotte Moorman]], and [[Yoko Ono]] in [[New York City]] were pioneers of performance based works of art, that often entailed nudity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.caroleeschneemann.com/interiorscroll.html| title=Carolee Schneemann, Biography: Selected Works, Recent and Forthcoming Events| publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
During the late 1950s and 1960s artists with a wide range of interests began to push the boundaries of contemporary art. [[Yves Klein]] in France, [[Carolee Schneemann]], [[Yayoi Kusama]], [[Charlotte Moorman]] and [[Yoko Ono]] in New York City, and [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Wolf Vostell]] and [[Nam June Paik]] in Germany were pioneers of performance-based works of art. Groups like [[The Living Theatre]] with [[Julian Beck]] and [[Judith Malina]] collaborated with sculptors and painters creating environments, radically changing the relationship between audience and performer, especially in their piece ''Paradise Now''. The [[Judson Dance Theater]], located at the [[Judson Memorial Church]], New York; and the Judson dancers, notably [[Yvonne Rainer]], [[Trisha Brown]], [[Elaine Summers]], Sally Gross, Simonne Forti, [[Deborah Hay]], [[Lucinda Childs]], [[Steve Paxton]] and others; collaborated with artists [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Robert Whitman]], [[John Cage]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], and engineers like [[Billy Klüver]]. [[Park Place Gallery]] was a center for musical performances by electronic composers [[Steve Reich]], [[Philip Glass]], and other notable performance artists including [[Joan Jonas]].

These performances were intended as works of a new art form combining sculpture, dance, and music or sound, often with audience participation. They were characterized by the reductive philosophies of minimalism and the spontaneous improvisation and expressivity of abstract expressionism. Images of Schneeman's performances of pieces meant to shock are occasionally used to illustrate these kinds of art, and she is often seen photographed while performing her piece ''Interior Scroll''. However, the images of her performing this piece are illustrating precisely what performance art is not. In performance art, the performance itself is the medium. Other media cannot illustrate performance art. Performance art is performed, not captured. By its nature performance is momentary and evanescent, which is part of the point of the medium as art. Representations of performance art in other media, whether by image, video, narrative or otherwise, select certain points of view in space or time or otherwise involve the inherent limitations of each medium, and which therefore cannot truly illustrate the medium of performance as art.

During the same period, various avant-garde artists created [[Happening]]s, mysterious and often spontaneous and unscripted gatherings of artists and their friends and relatives in various specified locations, often incorporating exercises in absurdity, physicality, costuming, spontaneous [[nudity]], and various random or seemingly disconnected acts. Notable creators of happenings included [[Allan Kaprow]]—who first used the term in 1958,&lt;ref name="Allan Kaprow|Chronology"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://members.chello.nl/j.seegers1/flux_files/kaprow_chronology.html| title=Fluxus &amp;amp; Happening&amp;nbsp;– Allan Kaprow&amp;nbsp;– Chronology| accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Jim Dine]], [[Red Grooms]], and [[Robert Whitman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/13/arts/design/13fink.html| work=The New York Times| title=Happenings Are Happening Again| first=Jori| last=Finkel| date=13 April 2008| accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Intermedia, multi-media====
{{main|Intermedia}}

Another trend in art which has been associated with the term postmodern is the use of a number of different media together. [[Intermedia]] is a term coined by [[Dick Higgins]] and meant to convey new art forms along the lines of [[Fluxus]], [[concrete poetry]], [[found objects]], [[performance art]], and [[computer art]]. Higgins was the publisher of the [[Something Else Press]], a concrete poet married to artist [[Alison Knowles]] and an admirer of [[Marcel Duchamp]]. [[Ihab Hassan]] includes "Intermedia, the fusion of forms, the confusion of realms," in his list of the characteristics of [[postmodern art]].&lt;ref&gt;Ihab Hassan in Lawrence E. Cahoone, ''From Modernism to Postmodernism: An Anthology'', Blackwell Publishing, 2003. p. 13. {{ISBN|0631232133}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most common forms of "multi-media art" is the use of video-tape and CRT monitors, termed [[video art]]. While the theory of combining multiple arts into one art is quite old, and has been revived periodically, the postmodern manifestation is often in combination with performance art, where the dramatic subtext is removed, and what is left is the specific statements of the artist in question or the conceptual statement of their action.

====Fluxus====
{{Main|Fluxus}}

Fluxus was named and loosely organized in 1962 by [[George Maciunas]] (1931–1978), a Lithuanian-born American artist. Fluxus traces its beginnings to [[John Cage]]'s 1957 to 1959 Experimental Composition classes at the [[New School for Social Research]] in New York City. Many of his students were artists working in other media with little or no background in music. Cage's students included Fluxus founding members [[Jackson Mac Low]], [[Al Hansen]], [[George Brecht]] and [[Dick Higgins]].

Fluxus encouraged a do-it-yourself aesthetic and valued simplicity over complexity. Like [[Dada]] before it, Fluxus included a strong current of anti-commercialism and an [[anti-art]] sensibility, disparaging the conventional market-driven art world in favor of an artist-centered creative practice. Fluxus artists preferred to work with whatever materials were at hand, and either created their own work or collaborated in the creation process with their colleagues.

[[Andreas Huyssen]] criticises attempts to claim Fluxus for Postmodernism as "either the master-code of postmodernism or the ultimately unrepresentable art movement—as it were, postmodernism's sublime."&lt;ref name="Huyssen"&gt;Andreas Huyssen, ''Twilight Memories: Marking Time in a Culture of Amnesia'', Routledge, 1995. p. 192. {{ISBN|0415909341}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead he sees Fluxus as a major [[Neo-Dada]]ist phenomena within the avant-garde tradition. It did not represent a major advance in the development of artistic strategies, though it did express a rebellion against "the administered culture of the 1950s, in which a moderate, domesticated modernism served as ideological prop to the [[Cold War]]."&lt;ref name="Huyssen" /&gt;

===Late period===
{{Main|Late modernism}}

The continuation of [[abstract expressionism]], [[color field painting]], [[lyrical abstraction]], [[geometric abstraction]], [[minimalism]], [[abstract illusionism]], [[process art]], [[pop art]], [[postminimalism]], and other late 20th-century Modernist movements in both painting and sculpture continued through the first decade of the 21st century and constitute radical new directions in those mediums.&lt;ref&gt;Ratcliff, Carter. "The New Informalists", ''Art News'', v. 68, n. 8, December 1969, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Barbara Rose]]. ''American Painting. Part Two: The Twentieth Century''. Published by Skira–Rizzoli, New York, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Darby Bannard]]. "Notes on American Painting of the Sixties." ''Artforum'', January 1970, vol. 8, no. 5, pp. 40–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the turn of the 21st century, well-established artists such as [[Sir Anthony Caro]], [[Lucian Freud]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Jasper Johns]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Al Held]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Jules Olitski]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Jim Dine]], [[James Rosenquist]], [[Alex Katz]], [[Philip Pearlstein]], and younger artists including [[Brice Marden]], [[Chuck Close]], [[Sam Gilliam]], [[Isaac Witkin]], [[Sean Scully]], [[Mahirwan Mamtani]], [[Joseph Nechvatal]], [[Elizabeth Murray (artist)|Elizabeth Murray]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Richard Serra]], [[Walter Darby Bannard]], [[Larry Zox]], [[Ronnie Landfield]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[Dan Christensen]], [[Joel Shapiro]], [[Tom Otterness]], [[Joan Snyder]], [[Ross Bleckner]], [[Archie Rand]], [[Susan Crile]], and others continued to produce vital and influential paintings and sculpture.

==Modernism in Africa and Asia==
See also  [[Santiniketan: The Making of a Contextual Modernism]] and [[Hanshinkan Modernism]]

Peter Kalliney suggests that,"Modernist concepts, especially aesthetic autonomy, were fundamental to the literature of [[decolonization]] in anglophone Africa."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Kalliney, "Modernism, African Literature, and the Cold War". ''Modern Language Quarterly'' (2015) 76 (3): 333–368.&lt;/ref&gt; In his opinion, [[Rajat Neogy]], [[Christopher Okigbo]], and [[Wole Soyinka]], were among the writer who "repurposed modernist versions of aesthetic autonomy to declare their freedom from colonial bondage, from systems of racial discrimination, and even from the new postcolonial state".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Kalliney, "Modernism, African Literature, and the Cold War".&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms "modernism" and "modernist", according to scholar William J. Tyler, "have only recently become part of the standard discourse in English on modern Japanese literature and doubts concerning their authenticity vis-a-vis Western European modernism remain". Tyler finds this odd, given "the decidedly modern prose" of such "well-known Japanese writers as [[Kawabata Yasunari]], [[Nagai Kafu]], and [[Jun'ichirō Tanizaki]]". However, "scholars in the visual and fine arts, architecture, and poetry readily embraced "[[modanizumu]]" as a key concept for describing and analyzing Japanese culture in the 1920s and 1930s".&lt;ref&gt;''Modanizumu: Modernist Fiction from Japan'', 1913–1938. Edited by William J. Tyler. University of Hawai'i Press, 2008, [http://www.uhpress.hawaii.edu/p-5343-9780824832421.aspx].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924, various young Japanese writers, including Kawabata Yasunari, [[Riichi Yokomitsu]] started a  literary journal ''Bungei Jidai'' ("The Artistic Age"). This journal was "part of an '[[art for art's sake]]' movement, influenced by European Cubism, Expressionism, Dada, and other modernist styles".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.is/4K875|title=Draft confirmed as Kawabata novel|date=2012-07-15|publisher=The Japan Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese  modernist [[architect]] [[Kenzō Tange]] (1913–2005) was one of the most significant architects of the 20th century, combining traditional Japanese styles with [[Modern Architecture|modernism]], and designed major buildings on five continents. Tange was also an influential patron of the [[Metabolism (architecture)|Metabolist movement]]. He said: "It was, I believe, around 1959 or at the beginning of the sixties that I began to think about what I was later to call [[Structuralism (architecture)|structuralism]]",&lt;ref&gt;(cited in ''Plan'' 2/1982, Amsterdam)&lt;/ref&gt; He was influenced from an early age by the Swiss modernist, [[Le Corbusier]], Tange gained international recognition in 1949 when he won the competition for the design of [[Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park]].

In China the "[[New Sensationists]]" (新感觉派, Xīn Gǎnjué Pài) were a group of writers based in Shanghai who in the 1930s and 1940s were influenced, to varying degrees, by Western and Japanese modernism. They wrote fiction that was more concerned with the unconscious and with aesthetics than with politics or social problems. Among these writers were [[Mu Shiying]], [[Liu Na'ou]], and [[Shi Zhecun]].

In India, the [[Progressive Artists' Group]] was a group of [[modern art]]ists, mainly based in [[Mumbai]], [[India]] formed in 1947. Though it lacked any particular style, it synthesised [[Indian art]] with European and North America influences from the first half of the 20th Century, including Post-Impressionism, Cubism and Expressionism.

==Differences between modernism and postmodernism==
By the early 1980s the [[Postmodern]] movement in art and architecture began to establish its position through various [[wikt:conceptual|conceptual]] and [[intermedia]] formats. Postmodernism in music and literature began to take hold earlier. In music, postmodernism is described in one reference work, as a "term introduced in the 1970s",&lt;ref&gt;"Postmodernism", ''The Penguin Companion to Classical Music'', ed. Paul Griffiths. London: Penguin, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; while in British literature, ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of British Literature'' sees modernism "ceding its predominance to postmodernism" as early as 1939.&lt;ref name="British Literature' 2006"/&gt; However, dates are highly debatable, especially as according to [[Andreas Huyssen]]: "one critic's postmodernism is another critic's modernism."&lt;ref name="Macmillan"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bokkilden.no/SamboWeb/produkt.do?produktId=952726| title=Postmodern Debates| author=Bokkilden| work=Bokkilden}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes those who are critical of the division between the two and see them as two aspects of the same movement, and believe that late Modernism continues.&lt;ref name="Macmillan"/&gt;

Modernism is an encompassing label for a wide variety of cultural movements. [[Postmodernism]] is essentially a centralized movement that named itself, based on sociopolitical theory, although the term is now used in a wider sense to refer to activities from the 20th century onwards which exhibit awareness of and reinterpret the modern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/postmodernism?view=uk| title=Oxford Dictionaries - Dictionary, Thesaurus, &amp; Grammar| publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/postmodernism| title=Postmodern - Definition of postmodern by Merriam-Webster| publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Reichl, Cook's November 1989; [http://www.bartleby.com/61/26/P0472600.html American Heritage Dictionary's definition of the postmodern] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209075319/http://www.bartleby.com/61/26/P0472600.html |date=9 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Postmodern theory asserts that the attempt to canonise Modernism "after the fact" is doomed to undisambiguable contradictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/theory/pomo.html| title=The Po-Mo Page: Postmodern to Post-postmodern| publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a narrower sense, what was Modernist was not necessarily also postmodern. Those elements of Modernism which accentuated the benefits of rationality and socio-technological progress were only Modernist.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, ''British, Irish and American Literature'', Trier 2002, pp. 210–12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and hostility to modernism==

[[File:Franz Marc-The fate of the animals-1913.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|[[Franz Marc]], ''The fate of the animals'', 1913, oil on canvas. The work was displayed at the exhibition of [[Degenerate art|"Entartete Kunst"]] ("degenerate art") in [[Munich]], [[Nazi Germany]], 1937.]]
Modernism's stress on [[freedom of expression]], experimentation, [[Radicalism (historical)|radicalism]], and [[primitivism]] disregards conventional expectations. In many art forms this often meant startling and alienating audiences with bizarre and unpredictable effects, as in the strange and disturbing combinations of motifs in [[Surrealism]] or the use of extreme [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]] and [[atonality]] in Modernist music. In literature this often involved the rejection of intelligible plots or characterization in novels, or the creation of poetry that defied clear interpretation.

From 1932 [[Socialist realism]] began to oust Modernism in the Soviet Union;&lt;ref&gt;Sergei V. Ivanov, ''Unknown Socialist Realism. The Leningrad School'', pp. 28–29. {{ISBN|978-5901724217}}&lt;/ref&gt; it had previously endorsed [[Russian Futurism|Futurism]] and [[constructivism (art)|Constructivism]]. The [[Nazism|Nazi]] government of Germany deemed modernism [[narcissism|narcissistic]] and nonsensical, as well as "Jewish" (see [[Antisemitism]]) and "Negro".&lt;ref&gt;Kühnel, Anita. [https://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10077 "Entartete Kunst", from ''Grove Art Online''], MoMA website.&lt;/ref&gt; The Nazis exhibited Modernist paintings alongside works by the [[mental illness|mentally ill]] in an exhibition entitled "[[Degenerate Art]]". Accusations of "formalism" could lead to the end of a career, or worse. For this reason many Modernists of the postwar generation felt that they were the most important bulwark against totalitarianism, the "[[sentinel species|canary in the coal mine]]", whose repression by a government or other group with supposed authority represented a warning that individual liberties were being threatened. Louis A. Sass compared madness, specifically [[schizophrenia]], and modernism in a less fascist manner by noting their shared disjunctive narratives, surreal images, and incoherence.&lt;ref&gt;Sass, Louis A. (1992). ''Madness and Modernism: Insanity in the Light of Modern Art, Literature, and Thought''. New York: Basic Books. Cited in Bauer, Amy (2004), "Cognition, Constraints, and Conceptual Blends in Modernist Music", in ''The Pleasure of Modernist Music''. {{ISBN|1580461433}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, modernism flourished mainly in consumer/capitalist societies, despite the fact that its proponents often rejected consumerism itself. However, [[high modernism]] began to merge with consumer culture after World War II, especially during the 1960s. In Britain, a youth [[subculture]] emerged calling itself "Modernist" (usually shortened to [[Mod (subculture)|Mod]]), following such representative music groups as [[the Who]] and [[the Kinks]]. The likes of [[Bob Dylan]], [[Serge Gainsbourg]] and [[the Rolling Stones]] combined popular musical traditions with Modernist verse, adopting literary devices derived from [[James Joyce]], [[Samuel Beckett]], [[James Thurber]], [[T. S. Eliot]], [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], and others. [[The Beatles]] developed along similar lines, creating various Modernist musical effects on several albums, while musicians such as [[Frank Zappa]], [[Syd Barrett]] and [[Captain Beefheart]] proved even more experimental. Modernist devices also started to appear in popular cinema, and later on in music videos. Modernist design also began to enter the mainstream of popular culture, as simplified and stylized forms became popular, often associated with dreams of a [[space age]] high-tech future.

This merging of consumer and high versions of Modernist culture led to a radical transformation of the meaning of "Modernism". First, it implied that a movement based on the rejection of tradition had become a tradition of its own. Second, it demonstrated that the distinction between elite Modernist and mass consumerist culture had lost its precision. Some writers{{Who|date=September 2009}} declared that modernism had become so institutionalized that it was now "post avant-garde", indicating that it had lost its power as a revolutionary movement. Many have interpreted this transformation as the beginning of the phase that became known as [[postmodernism]]. For others, such as art critic [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]], postmodernism represents an extension of modernism.

"Anti-modern" or "counter-modern" movements seek to emphasize [[holism]], connection and [[spirituality]] as remedies or antidotes to modernism. Such movements see modernism as [[reductionist]], and therefore subject to an inability to see systemic and [[emergence|emergent]] effects. Many Modernists came to this viewpoint, for example [[Paul Hindemith]] in his late turn towards mysticism. Writers such as Paul H. Ray and Sherry Ruth Anderson, in ''[[The Cultural Creatives: How 50 Million People Are Changing the World]]'' (2000), Fredrick Turner in ''A Culture of Hope'' and [[Lester Brown]] in ''Plan B'', have articulated a critique of the basic idea of modernism itself—that individual creative expression should conform to the realities of technology. Instead, they argue, individual creativity should make everyday life more emotionally acceptable.

Some traditionalist artists like [[Alexander Stoddart]] reject modernism generally as the product of "an epoch of false money allied with false culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Jack |first=Ian |title=Set in Stone |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=6 June 2009 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/jun/06/alexander-stoddart-interview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some fields, the effects of modernism have remained stronger and more persistent than in others. Visual art has made the most complete break with its past. Most major capital cities have museums devoted to modern art as distinct from post-[[Renaissance]] art (c. 1400 to c. 1900). Examples include the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York, the [[Tate Modern]] in London, and the [[Centre Pompidou]] in Paris. These galleries make no distinction between modernist and Postmodernist phases, seeing both as developments within Modern Art.

[[File:9595 - Milano - Museo archeologico - Patera di Parabiago - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto 13 Mar 2012.jpg|thumb|Detail: [[Cybele]] and [[Attis]] group.]]

The '''Parabiago plate''', also known as the '''Parabiago patera''',&lt;ref&gt;The plate is actually not a [[patera]], however.&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Roman art|ancient Roman]] circular silver plate depicting mythological figures. It was found in an [[Roman funerals and burial|ancient Roman cemetery]] at [[Parabiago]], near [[Milan]], in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth E. Leader-Newby, ''Silver and Society in Late Antiquity: Functions and Meanings of Silver Plate in the Fourth to Seventh Centuries'' (Ashgate, 2004), p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; The plate depicts [[Cybele]] with her consort [[Attis]] in a "vast cosmic setting"&lt;ref&gt;Giulia Sfameni Gasparro, ''Soteriology and Mystic Aspects in the Cult of Cybele and Attis'' (Brill, 1985), p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; amid "sun, moon, earth and sea, time and the seasons."&lt;ref&gt;John Ferguson, ''The Religions of the Roman Empire'' (Cornell University Press, 1970, 1985), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of its discovery, it was thought to have been used as a lid for a funerary [[amphora]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Bernard Cook]], ''Zeus'' (Cambridge University Press, 1940 edition, 2010 reprinting), vol. 3, pt. 2, pp. 1127–1128.&lt;/ref&gt;

The plate is difficult to date. Earlier scholars tended to date it to the 2nd century AD, because of its classicizing style, but stylistic characteristics also permit a later date. Technical analyses, however, support a provenance in the 4th–5th centuries, even though it bears little stylistic resemblance to other silver pieces from that period.&lt;ref&gt;Leader-Newby, ''Silver and Society in Late Antiquity,'' p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The plate weighs 3555 g and measures 390 mm in diameter. It has a foot-ring of 26 mm in height. The surface is worked with figures in high relief.&lt;ref&gt;Leader-Newby, ''Silver and Society in Late Antiquity,'' p. 146. Unless otherwise noted, the following description of the figures on the plate is that of Leader-Newby.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Treaty of Penn with Indians by Benjamin West.jpg|thumb|300px|''The Treaty of Penn with the Indians'']]
 
'''''The Treaty of Penn with the Indians''''', sometimes known as '''''Penn's Treaty with the Indians at Shackamaxon''''' or more simply '''''Penn's Treaty with the Indians''''', is an [[oil painting]] by [[Benjamin West]], completed in 1771-2.  The painting depicts [[William Penn]] entering into [[peace treaty]] in 1683 with [[Tamanend]], a chief of the [[Lenape]] ("Delaware Indians") Turtle Clan, under the shade of an [[elm tree]] near the village of [[Shackamaxon]] (now Kensington) in [[Pennsylvania]].

Although the Delaware tribe challenged the [[Walking Purchase]] of 1737, which some historians have speculated was fraudulently created by William Penn's son, [[Thomas Penn]], the peace between the Lenape Turtle Clan and Penn's successors would endure almost a century, until the [[Penn's Creek Massacre]] of 1755.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.penntreatymuseum.org/treaty.php Penn Treaty Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

The treaty William Penn entered into was remarked upon by [[Voltaire]], who called it "... the only treaty never sworn to and never broken." ''{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

==Painting==
The painting was commissioned by [[Thomas Penn]] - [[William Penn]]'s son - in 1770 or 1771 and completed in 1771-2.  West was a local artist who was born in [[Springfield Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Springfield, Pennsylvania]] and grew up in [[Swarthmore, Pennsylvania]].  Like Thomas Penn, West was born into a [[Quaker]] family.  Also like Thomas Penn, he later turned to the [[Church of England]], however.  He studied in [[Philadelphia]] but developed as a painter of historic subjects in London, where he was the second president of the [[Royal Academy of Arts]].  His reputation for [[history painting]] was established in the early 1770s with his painting of ''[[The Death of General Wolfe]]''.

For the image of William Penn, West copied a relief portrait made from memory by [[Silvanius Bevan]] several years after Penn's death.  West had no models for the Indian subjects, so used sketches of sculptures, adding Indian artefacts, such as beaded moccasins, arm bands, and bags, and clay pipes.

The crowd is gathered around a white cloth which draws the eye at the centre of the composition, like a campfire or the [[Christ child]] at the centre of a [[Nativity of Jesus|nativity]] scene.  The painting presents an idealised picture of interaction between the Indians and the Europeans, glossing over recent difficulties such as the [[Walking Purchase]] in 1737 and the [[Treaty of Lancaster|treaty with the Six Nations]] in 1744, but harking back instead to Penn's wish for peace.

The milk Indians are dressed and decorated in green, red and white, with feather headdresses, partly shaved heads, beaded armbands and headbands, and large earrings.  They lean forward, keen to see what they are being offered. Original items of clothing that were used as a model for portraying Native Americans in the painting can be found in the [[British Museum]]'s collection (as well as additional indigenous artefacts used in other paintings by West).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?people=37698&amp;peoA=37698-3-17 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Europeans are shown in more sombre clothing typical of 1771, in shades of browns and greys, rather than the more decorated styles of 1682; Penn is picked out by his white neckcloth.  The Europeans stand back, reversing their contemporary keenness to acquire land from the Indians.  The crowd includes West's own father (the elderly gentleman with white hair, third to left of Penn) and his half brother Thomas West (behind Penn).  West also added brick-built buildings from his own memories of Pennsylvania, even though they had not been built by 1682.

The canvas measures {{convert|190|cm|in}} high by {{convert|274|cm|in}} wide.

The painting was purchased at auction by [[Joseph Harrison, Jr.|Joseph Harrison]] and brought to Philadelphia.  On Harrison's death, it was given to the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]] and the [[United States National Museum of Independence]].  It has been exhibited at the [[Pennsylvania State Museum]].

A [[wikt:copperplate|copperplate]] print of the painting was engraved in London by [[John Hall (artist)|John Hall]] and published by [[John Boydell]] in June 1775, with the image reversed, under the longer title ''William Penn's treaty with the Indians, when he founded the province of Pennsylvania in North America, 1681''.  The print was copied in a smaller size by [[Robert Delaunay]] and published as ''Guillaume Penn Traite avec les Indiens''.  This French print was copied by other artists.

The tree itself also became a subject for later paintings and prints, although it fell during a storm on 3 March 1810. The land is now [[Penn Treaty Park]].  The painting influenced folk artist [[Edward Hicks]], who made his own image of the events.

'''Photography by indigenous peoples of the Americas''' is an art form that began in the late 19th century and has expanded in the 21st century, including [[digital photography]], [[underwater photography]], and a wide range of alternative processes. [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]] have used [[photography]] as a means of expressing their lives and communities from their own perspectives. Native photography stands in contrast to the ubiquitous photography of indigenous peoples by non-natives, which has often been criticized as being staged, exoticized, and romanticized.

==1880s–1920s==
[[File:Benj. Haldane w camera.JPG|thumb|120px|left|[[Benjamin Haldane]] ([[Tsimshian]]) with camera, [[Metlakatla, Alaska]], ca. 1895–1905]]

Indigenous peoples of the Americas embraced photography in the 19th century. Some even owned and operated their own photography studios, such as [[Antonio Calderón Sandoval]] ([[Purépecha]], ca. 1847–unknown), the grandfather of [[Frida Kahlo]]; [[Benjamin Haldane]] (1874–1941), [[Tsimshian]] of [[Metlakatla, Alaska|Metlakatla]] Village on [[Annette Island, Alaska]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washington.edu/burkemuseum/inthespirit/our_artwork.php Artwork in ''Our People, Our Land, Our Images.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829153559/http://www.washington.edu/burkemuseum/inthespirit/our_artwork.php |date=2008-08-29 }} ''The Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture.'' Retrieved 1 Feb 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Richard Throssel]] (1882–1933), [[Cree]] of [[Montana]]. [[Max T. Vargas]] (father of pin-up artist [[Alberto Vargas]]), was a successful Mestizo photographer in [[Arequipa, Peru]], who taught photography to [[Martín Chambi]] (Quechua, 1891–1973), an Indigenous miner. [[Jennie Ross Cobb]] (1881–1959), [[Cherokee Nation]] of [[Park Hill, Oklahoma]], began developing her own film as a young child and photographed her college classmates, family, neighbors, and students.

The works of these early indigenous photographer stand in stark contrast to the romanticized images of non-native photographers. Recent scholarship by Mique’l Askren ([[Tsimshian]]-[[Tlingit people|Tlingit]]) on the photographs of Benjamin A. Haldane has analyzed the functions that Haldane's photographs served for his community: as markers of success by having European-American-style formal portraits taken, and as markers of the continuity of [[potlach]]ing and customary ceremonials by having photographs taken in ceremonial regalia. This second category is particularly significant because the use of the ceremonial regalia was against the law in Canada between 1885-1951.&lt;ref&gt;[http://travelpeapod.wordpress.com/2010/04/16/bringing-our-history-into-focus/ Mique'l Askren, Bringing our History into Focus: Re-Developing the Work of B.A. Haldane, 19th Century Tsimshian Photographer, ''Blackflash: Seeing Red'', Volume 24, No. 3, 2007, pp. 41-47] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306171344/http://travelpeapod.wordpress.com/2010/04/16/bringing-our-history-into-focus/ |date=2012-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Native American boarding schools]] were important centers for photography at the turn of the century. John Leslie ([[Puyallup (tribe)|Puyallup]]) learned photography at [[Carlisle Indian School]]. In 1895, Leslie published a book of his photography and exhibited his photographs at the 1895 [[Atlanta International Exposition]]&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Laura. [http://chronicles.dickinson.edu/studentwork/indian/4_choate.htm "John Nicholas Choate and the Production of Photography at the Carlisle Indian School."] ''Visualizing a Mission: Artifacts and Imagery of the Carlisle Indian School, 1879-1918.'' Retrieved 1 Feb 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=xi&gt;Tsinhnahjinnie and Passalacqua xi&lt;/ref&gt; By 1906 Carlisle Indian School built a state-of-the-art photography studio and taught photography classes to its Native students.&lt;ref name=xi/&gt; [[Parker McKenzie]] (1897–1999) and his wife Nettie Odlety McKenzie (1896–1978) purchased cameras and took photographs while they attended [[Phoenix Indian School]] in 1916.

==1920s–1940s==
[[Peter Pitseolak]] (1902–1973), [[Inuk]] from [[Cape Dorset, Nunavut]], documented Inuit life in the mid-20th century while dealing with challenges presented by the harsh climate and extreme light conditions of the Canadian Arctic. He developed his film himself in his igloo, and some of his photos were shot by oil lamps.

[[Horace Poolaw]] (1906–1984), [[Kiowa]], shot over 2,000 images of his neighbors and relatives in Western Oklahoma from the 1920s onward.

[[Jean Fredericks]] (b. 1906), [[Hopi]], had to carefully negotiate cultural views towards photography and made a point of not offering his portraits of Hopi people for sale to the public.&lt;ref&gt;Masayesva and Younger 42&lt;/ref&gt;

==1950s–1999==
[[File:In Peter Pisteolak's Home.jpg|thumb|240px|Photograph of his home by [[Peter Pitseolak]] ([[Inuk]]), 1968]]
For a 1980s exhibit of Hopi photographers at Northlight Gallery in [[Tempe, Arizona]], Victor Masayesva, Jr. (Hopi) explained how Hopis protect their privacy from the flood of photographs of them and their community by non-Hopi people. Hopi photographers know that certain subjects, especially ceremonial dances are not meant to be photographed. "The camera which is available to us is a weapon that will violate the silences and secrets so essential to our group survival," he wrote.&lt;ref&gt;Masayesva and Younger 10&lt;/ref&gt; Many Hopi photographers do not sell their work to outsides.&lt;ref&gt;Masayesva and Younger 33&lt;/ref&gt;

The establishment of tribal newspapers, such as the ''Qua Toqti'' and ''Hopi Tribal News'' both in the 1970s, created a demand for Native [[photojournalist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Masayesva and Younger 36&lt;/ref&gt; Owen Seumptewa (Hopi) became photographic consultant to his tribe in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Masayesva and Younger 37&lt;/ref&gt;

While many native photographers were interested in documenting tribal life, [[Luis González Palma]] ([[Mestizo]], b. 1957) borrows from a [[Victorian decorative arts|Victorian]] aesthetic to create haunting, mysterious portraits of [[Mayan people|Mayan]] and mestizo people, especially women, from his native [[Guatemala]]. He shoots in [[black and white photography|black and white]] but then hand-tints the photographs in [[sepia tone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utata.org/salon/19586.php "Luis González Palma."] ''Utata Tribal Photography.'' Retrieved 1 Feb 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Canadian national conference of indigenous photographers took place in March 1985 in [[Hamilton, Ontario]], and from that the Native Indian/Inuit Photographers' Association (NIIPA) was formed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.connexions.org/CxLibrary/CX3039.htm "Native Indian/Inuit Phototgraphers' Association (NIIPA)."] ''Connexions.'' 1986. Retrieved 6 Feb 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1980s, NIIPA had fifty members from North America.&lt;ref&gt;Weideman 36&lt;/ref&gt;

==21st century==
Today more Native people are professional art photographers; however, acceptance to the genre has met with challenges. [[Hulleah Tsinhnahjinnie]] ([[Navajo people|Navajo]]-[[Muscogee (Creek)|Muscogee]]-[[Seminole]]), has not only established a successful career with her own work, she has also been an advocate for the entire field of Native American photography. She has curated shows and organized conferences at the C.N. Gorman Museum at [[UC Davis]] featuring Native American photographers. Tsinhnahjinnie wrote the book, ''Our People, Our Land, Our Images: International Indigenous Photographers.'' [[Larry McNeil (photographer)|Larry McNeil]] ([[Tlingit people|Tlingit]]) is a fine art photographer and professor who has mentored many emerging indigenous photographers. Together with Tsinhnahjinnie, McNeil curated ''New Native Photography'' at the [[New Mexico Museum of Art]] to draw more attention to the genre of photography during the 2011 [[Santa Fe Indian Market]].&lt;ref&gt;Weideman 36–7&lt;/ref&gt;

Native photographers taking their skills into the fields of art videography, photocollage, digital photography, and digital art.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13055">The following is '''a list of unproduced [[Ridley Scott]] projects''' in roughly chronological order. During his long career, English film director [[Ridley Scott]] has worked on a number of projects which never progressed beyond the pre-production stage under his direction. Some of these projects, fell in [[development hell]] or are officially canceled.

== 1970s ==

=== ''Tristan and Isolde'' ===
In the mid-1970s, before the beginning of the filming of ''[[The Duellists]]'', Scott pitched the idea of a film adaptation of [[medieval]] romantic [[legend]] of ''[[Tristan and Iseult]]'', and he planned to release this film as his second movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Evan Jacobs |url=http://movieweb.com/exclusive-setting-the-period-with-tristan-isolde-executive-producer-ridley-scott/ |title=EXCLUSIVE: Setting the Period With Tristan + Isolde Executive Producer Ridley Scott |website=Movieweb.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the project never materialized at the time, and Scott pitched the idea of ''[[Legend (1985 film)|Legend]]'' during the filming of ''The Duellists'' as a replacement of this project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Franco |first=James |url=http://www.newsweek.com/james-francos-favorite-mistake-filming-tristan-isolde-63903 |title=James Franco’s Favorite Mistake: Filming Tristan &amp; Isolde |website=Newsweek.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film, [[Tristan &amp; Isolde (film)|Tristan &amp; Isolde]], was finally released in 2006 with [[Kevin Reynolds (director)|Kevin Reynolds]] as the director and with Scott as the producer.

== 1980s ==

=== ''Dune'' ===
Around 1981, Scott was hired to direct a film adaptation of [[Frank Herbert]]'s novel ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Daniel D. Snyder |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/03/the-messy-misunderstood-glory-of-david-lynchs-em-dune-em/284316/ |title=The Messy, Misunderstood Glory of David Lynch's Dune |publisher=[[The Atlantic]] |date=2014-03-14 |accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Scott was finally replaced by [[David Lynch]], and the [[Dune (film)|film]] was released in 1984.

== 1990s ==

=== ''Crisis in the Hot Zone'' ===
In February 1994, Scott signed a deal with [[20th Century Fox]] to direct a film adaptation of [[Richard Preston]]'s article ''[[The Hot Zone|Crisis in the Hot Zone]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.varietyultimate.com/archive/issue/DV-02-14-1994-1 |title=Now displaying the Daily Variety for February 14, 1994 |website=Varietyultimate.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late April 1994, [[Robert Redford]] and [[Jodie Foster]] were in talks for star in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.varietyultimate.com/archive/issue/WV-05-02-1994-13 |title=Now displaying the Weekly Variety for May 02, 1994 |website=Varietyultimate.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the project was finally shut down due to many production problems and Foster's departure from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.varietyultimate.com/archive/issue/DV-08-19-1994-1 |title=Now displaying the Daily Variety for August 19, 1994 |website=Varietyultimate.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''I Am Legend'' ===
On July 2, 1997, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that Scott had signed a contract with [[Warner Bros.]] to direct the third film adaptation of [[Richard Matheson]]'s novel ''[[I Am Legend (novel)|I Am Legend]]''.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|author=Anita M. Busch |url=https://variety.com/1997/film/news/scott-is-stuff-of-legend-1116677570/ |title=Scott is stuff of ‘Legend’ |publisher=Variety |date=1997-07-02 |accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] was attached to portray Dr. Robert Neville&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; and [[Mark Protosevich]] was attached to write the film,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Padraig Cotter |url=http://www.denofgeek.com/uk/movies/i-am-legend/43440/the-legend-of-ridley-scott-s-i-am-legend |title=The legend of Ridley Scott’s I Am Legend |publisher=[[Den of Geek]] |date= |accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the project was finally cancelled due to budgetary concerns on March 16, 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-03-16/news/9803160197_1_legend-hollywood-reporter-million-budget |title=Schwarzenegger's 'Legend' Is In Peril |website=Articles.chicagotribune.com |date=1998-03-16 |accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was subsequently revived and in 2007 [[I Am Legend (film)|the film]] was released with [[Francis Lawrence]] as director and with [[Will Smith]] in the lead role.

== 2000s ==

=== ''Alien 5'' ===
In an interview on January 23, 2002, Scott expressed his desire to make a fifth installment in the [[Alien (franchise)|''Alien'' franchise]].&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Davidson |first=Paul |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2002/01/23/alien-vs-predator-battle-of-the-sequels |title=Alien vs. Predator: Battle of the Sequels |publisher=IGN |date=2002-01-23 |accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that the fifth film would explain the Aliens' origins and where they were discovered.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; [[James Cameron]] was attached to return as writer and producer.&lt;ref name=Reddit-JamesCameron-AMA-20140412&gt; {{cite web |url=  https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22uz4m/i_am_james_cameron_ama/cgqn1y0/ |title= I am James Cameron. AMA. |date= 12 April 2014 |author= James Cameron |publisher= Reddit |work= Ask Me Anything }} &lt;/ref&gt; However, the project was finally shelved by [[20th Century Fox]] (since they thought that they would ruin the franchise with a fifth film) due to the production of the spin-off ''[[Prometheus (2012 film)|Prometheus]]'', and ''[[Alien vs. Predator (film)|Alien vs. Predator]]'' was released in 2004 instead, as the first installment of the [[Alien vs. Predator|''Alien vs. Predator'' spin-off franchise.]]

=== ''Gladiator 2'' ===
On September 11, 2003, Scott expressed interest in direct the [[Gladiator 2|planned sequel]] to his successful ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'' film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2003/09/11/ridley-talks-gladiator-2 |title=Ridley Talks Gladiator 2 |publisher=IGN |date=2003-09-11 |accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that Scott and [[Russell Crowe]] stated that they wanted to hire [[Nick Cave]] for rewrite the sequel's script.&lt;ref name="rottentomatoes-2006-05-08"&gt; {{cite web |url= http://www.rottentomatoes.com/news/1646784/ridley_lays_quotgladiator_2quot_to_rest |publisher= Rotten Tomatoes |title= Ridley Lays "Gladiator 2" to Rest |author= Scott Weinberg |date= 8 May 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110117094059/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/news/1646784/ridley_lays_quotgladiator_2quot_to_rest |archive-date= 2011-01-17 |dead-url=no}} &lt;/ref&gt; However, at the end, Cave's script was rejected and Scott and Crowe cancelled plans for a sequel in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/may/06/nick-cave-rejected-gladiator-script|title=Nick Cave's rejected Gladiator 2 script uncovered!|first=Sean|last=Michaels|date=6 May 2009|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== ''Blood Meridian'' ===
On May 10, 2004, Scott revealed his intentions to make, along with screenwriter [[William Monahan]] and producer [[Scott Rudin]], a [[Blood Meridian (film)|film adaptation]] of [[Cormac McCarthy]]'s acclaimed novel ''[[Blood Meridian]]'',&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/05/10/ridley-onboard-blood-meridian |title=Ridley Onboard Blood Meridian? |publisher=IGN |date=2004-05-10 |accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; a project that  had tried to be filmed in the past by various other filmmakers, like screenwriter [[Steve Tesich]] and actor [[Tommy Lee Jones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://movieweb.com/william-monahan-to-adapt-blood-meridian/ |title=William Monahan to adapt Blood Meridian |website=Movieweb.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paramount Pictures]] was set to develop the feature,&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; and in June 2008, during an interview with ''Eclypse Magazine'', Scott stated that the script was written, but it contained much violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eclipsemagazine.com/hollywood-insider/interview-the-great-ridley-scott-speaks-with-eclipse-by-scott-essman/5812 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604172245/http://eclipsemagazine.com/hollywood-insider/interview-the-great-ridley-scott-speaks-with-eclipse-by-scott-essman/5812 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-06-04 |title=INTERVIEW: The great Ridley Scott Speaks with Eclipse by Scott Essman &amp;#124; EclipseMagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on August 17, 2008, Rudin stated that Scott and Monahan had left the project and that director [[Todd Field]] would direct it instead than Scott.&lt;ref name="JMedinaLAT"&gt;{{cite news |author= Medina, Jeremy|title= Cormac McCarthy's Blood Meridian film changes directors |publisher= ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''|date= August 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Todd Field still working hard on Blood Meridian|url= http://www.talkingfilms.net/todd-field-still-working-hard-on-blood-meridian|date= January 14, 2010|accessdate= April 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Untitled Lucius Verus spin-off ===
In 2006, [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported plans for a ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'' spin-off. [[DreamWorks]] had approached Scott with the intentions of producing a spin-off with [[Maximus Decimus Meridius|Lucius Verus]] as the main character.&lt;ref name="rottentomatoes-2006-05-08"/&gt; However, after the cancellation of ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)#Possible sequel|Gladiator 2]]'', any further proposals for a sequel or spin-off were quickly abandoned.

=== ''Metropolis'' ===
In the 2000s, Scott mooted a sequel to 1982's ''[[Blade Runner]]'' under the title "Metropolis".&lt;ref name=isbn9780810869523-pp225&gt; {{cite book |page= 225 |title= The Ridley Scott Encyclopedia |author= Laurence Raw |publisher= Scarecrow Press |year= 2009 |isbn= 9780810869523 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Purefold'' ===
On June 4, 2009,''[[The New York Times]]'' revealed that Scott along with his now-deceased brother [[Tony Scott]] were working on a [[Web series|webseries]] inspired by ''[[Blade Runner]]'' with episodes of 5 or 10 minutes, that, according to Ridley, it could have also been transmitted on television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stone |first=Brad |url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/04/web-series-tied-to-blade-runner-is-in-the-works/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223044740/http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/04/web-series-tied-to-blade-runner-is-in-the-works/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-02-23 |title=Web Series Tied to 'Blade Runner' Is In the Works - NYTimes.com |date=2014-02-23 |accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2010, it was reported that the production of the series was cancelled due to funding problems.

== 2010s ==

=== ''Robin Hood 2'' ===
On April 4, 2010, Scott revealed his hopes of making a sequel to ''[[Robin Hood (2010 film)|Robin Hood]]'' and more films after that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://login.thetimes.co.uk/?gotoUrl=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/arts/film/ |title=Film |website=Loginthetimes.co./uk |accessdate=2016-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201065415/https://login.thetimes.co.uk/?gotoUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thetimes.co.uk%2Ftto%2Farts%2Ffilm%2F |archivedate=2016-12-01 |df= }} {{subscription required|date=December 2016}} {{pn|date=November 2017}} &lt;/ref&gt; On May 13, 2010, [[Russell Crowe]] expressed his desire to reprise his role as [[Robin Hood|Robin Longstride/Robin Hood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Collett |first=Mike |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-cannes-idUKTRE64A6N620100513?pageNumber=1 |title=Robin Hood opens Cannes, Crowe hints at sequel &amp;#124; Reuters |website=Uk.reuters.com |date=2010-05-13 |accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, plans for the sequel fell in [[development hell]], with anticipation of an update being made after this announcement.

=== Untitled Sci-fi short films ===
On March 12, 2013, [[Tubefilter]] reported that Scott would work with [[Machinima]] in the production of twelve [[science fiction]] short films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gutelle |first=Sam |url=http://www.tubefilter.com/2013/03/12/ridley-scott-machinima-sci-fi/ |title=Ridley Scott Will Create New Batch Of Sci-Fi Classics For Machinima |website=Tubefilter.com |date=2013-03-12 |accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on November 21 of that year, Scott reported that the Sci-Fi shorts project was canceled due the end of the deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cohen |first=Joshua |url=http://www.tubefilter.com/2013/11/21/machinima-ridley-scott-cancel-series-of-sci-fi-shorts/ |title=Machinima And Ridley Scott Cancel Plans For Series Of Sci-Fi Shorts |website=Tubefilter.com |date=2013-11-21 |accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Sail Away to Avalon'''" is the first single by [[Ayreon]], released on 1995, from their album  ''[[The Final Experiment]]''. The song combines elements of medieval classical music with [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[Folk music|folk]] using instruments such as the [[harpsichord]] for the rhythm sections. The lyrics reinforce this theme, telling the tale of a grand adventure to "[[Avalon]]" to recover the [[holy grail]]. The single is a re-recording of Ayreon's demo EP. All songs from the demo, except "the Accusation" were re-recorded for the single EP and the compilation album, ''[[Ayreonauts Only]]'' (also not including "Sail Away to Avalon").

In [[drama]], a '''scene'''  is a unit of action, often a subdivision of an [[Act (drama)|act]]. 

==French scene==
A "French scene" is a scene in which the beginning and end are marked by a change in the presence of characters onstage, rather than by the lights going up or down or the set being changed.&lt;ref name="George"&gt;George, Kathleen (1994) ''Playwriting: The First Workshop'', Focal Press, {{ISBN|978-0-240-80190-2}}, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

==Obligatory scene==
From the French ''scène à faire'', an obligatory scene is a scene (usually highly charged with emotion) which is anticipated by the audience and provided by an obliging playwright. An example is ''[[Hamlet]]'' 3.4, when Hamlet confronts his mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cuddon|first=J. A.|authorlink=J. A. Cuddon|editor=C. E.

[[File:Sherab &amp; Ani Semchi.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Sherab Palden Beru with his German-born protégé Ani Semchi (right) and another student, during thangka restoration work at Samye Ling monastery, Scotland, in 2005]]

==Life and work==
Born into a nomadic family that had lived in the eastern province of [[Kham]], [[Tibet]], since the mid-15th century, Beru entered the Namgyal Ling [[monastery]] at the age of nine. His aptitude for drawing was quickly recognised, and his formal artistic training began from the age of 13, under the guidance of the monastery's [[lama|artist-lama]]. Nine years later, he completed his first thangka.&lt;ref name="Blurb Books"&gt;Blurb Books: [http://www.blurb.com/bookstore/detail/3477797 A Tribute to the Life and Work of by Sherab Palden Beru: Biographies &amp; Memoirs | Blurb Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was whilst studying at Namgyal Ling that Beru attained high levels of skill, not only in Thangka painting, but also in associated monastic disciplines such as ritual music, and Lama dancing in particular.&lt;ref name="Obituary: Sherab Palden Beru"&gt;Obituary: Sherab Palden Beru: [https://www.samyeling.org/index/news-app/story.89/title.obituary-sherab-palden-beru Kagyu Samye Ling - Obituary: Sherab Palden Beru] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121211090621/http://www.samyeling.org/index/news-app/story.89/title.obituary-sherab-palden-beru |date=2012-12-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956, after over 30 years of living at the monastery, Beru left for [[Lhasa]], where he stayed for three years, until forced to escape to [[India]] following the [[Invasion of Tibet (1950–1951)|invasion of Tibet by Chinese forces]].
Once in India, Beru began thangka painting again, based for a while in [[Dalhousie, India|Dalhousie]]&lt;ref name="Obituary: Sherab Palden Beru"/&gt; where, amongst other works, he was commissioned by [[Lokesh Chandra]] to produce a series of drawings of [[mandala]]s for publication. He was then asked by the [[16th Karmapa]], Rangjung Rigpe Dorje, to make his way to [[Scotland]] where [[Chogyam Trungpa]] and [[Akong Rinpoche|Akong Tulku Rinpoche]] had established the first Tibetan Buddhist centre in the west, [[Samye Ling|Kagyu Samye Ling]], in [[Eskdalemuir]], [[Dumfriesshire]]. Despite having some initial misgivings about leaving the Tibetan community in exile in Northern India so soon after having arrived as a refugee, Beru acceded to the wishes of his Guru.&lt;ref name="Blurb Books"/&gt;

For the next 35 years, Beru devoted himself to creating thangkas of outstanding quality in the Karma Gadri style, and to training western students in the techniques of thangka painting. His work can be seen in centres through Europe, Asia and North America.
His principal achievements are to be seen at [[Samye Ling]] itself, where he designed not only the temple interior&lt;ref name="samye.org"&gt;samye.org: [http://www.samye.org/arbio4.htm Dr Akong Tulku Rinpoche: biography.]&lt;/ref&gt; but several cycles of exquisite thangkas, depicting variously the [[Kagyu]] Lineage holders, [[Sakyamuni Buddha]], Indian mahasiddhas and the Four Directional Guardians. Most notable are the much-copied painting of the Kagyu Lineage [[Refuge Tree]] and the painting of the Guru Yoga of the [[8th Karmapa]], Mikyo Dorje. He painted the thangka of Vajradhara in the Dorje Dzong shrine room in Boulder, Colorado.&lt;ref name="SKILLFUL MEANS AND WISDOM"&gt;[http://www.chronicleproject.com/stories_103.html Chronicles of Chögyam Trungpa Skillful Means and Wisdom]&lt;/ref&gt;

The paintings in the temple at Samye Ling are known for their combination of large size and exquisite detail. As in Tibet, many of these paintings took between one and three years to complete. Along with Akong Rinpoche and his students, Beru also helped retrieve, restore and preserve thangkas from Tibet, many of which were destroyed in the early days of the Chinese occupation. Later Beru was joined at Samye Ling by his nephew, Gyamtso Tashi, an ordained monk and sculptor, who reached India after making a three-year pilgrimage on foot across Tibet.

Well into his 90s, Beru no longer contributed directly to the art-work, but remained a leading authority on matters of Tibetan art, and was regularly consulted by practicing thangka artists. He died on 29 November at Samye Ling at an age of about 100.&lt;ref name="Archive of the works of Sherab Palden Beru"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bodhicharya.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The [https://www.samyeling.org/index/news-app/story.89/title.obituary-sherab-palden-beru obituary on the Samye Ling website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121211090621/http://www.samyeling.org/index/news-app/story.89/title.obituary-sherab-palden-beru |date=2012-12-11 }} claims he was born in 1913&lt;!-- though I will admit hearing an age quoted which would have made him 103 at death. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; His body was left completely undisturbed in 'Tukdam' meditation for the traditional three-day period after his death.

The '''Society for Japanese Arts''' was founded in 1937 by a group of Dutch collectors of, and dealers in, [[Japanese art]]. Originally called '''The Society for Japanese Arts and Crafts''', the society became international in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artlistings.com/associations/d/1824/society-for-japanese-arts/ Art Listings]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artelino.com/articles/society-japanese-arts.asp Artlino.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  It currently has over 800 members in 29 countries.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;[http://www.society-for-japanese-arts.org/about%20us.htm Society for Japanese Arts - About Us] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100916061013/http://www.society-for-japanese-arts.org/about%20us.htm |date=2010-09-16 }} Retrieved 29 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The Society sponsors lectures, exhibitions and publications.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt; It awards grants through the Heinz M.

'''St. Saviour Church''' ({{lang-hr|Crkva sv. Spasa}}) is a small votive church located in [[Dubrovnik]]'s Old Town. It is dedicated to [[Jesus Christ]].

== History and Architecture ==
[[Image:StSaviourChurch-Dubrovnik3.jpg|thumb|200px|left|the main entrance with the inscription above]]

Following an earthquake on 17 May 1520, which killed about 20 people and damaged many buildings in the city, the local Senate which governed [[Dubrovnik Republic]] commissioned a new church as a sign of gratitude for sparing the city from even bigger destruction. The monumental inscription above the main entrance on the front facade testifies to this. Designed by the architect Petar Andrijić from [[Korčula]], construction started in 1520 and the church was completed in 1528.&lt;ref name="History and Architecture"&gt;Antun Travirka; ''Dubrovnik - history, culture, art heritage'', 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

The church has one [[nave]] with a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]]-cross-ribbed vault. The lateral windows are also Gothic with the typical pointed arches. Nevertheless, the main facade with the [[Renaissance]] elements on the portal and the three-leaf semicircular top as well as the semicircular [[apse]] reveal a recognizable Renaissance style. 
[[File:Dubrovnik (125).JPG|thumb|Interior of the St. Saviour Church]]
In 1667 Dubrovnik was hit again by a [[1667 Dubrovnik earthquake|disastrous earthquake]] which killed some 5,000 citizens and destroyed much of the city.&lt;ref name="History and Architecture"/&gt; However, St. Saviour Church withstood the disaster so it can be seen today in its original form, as a fine example of the town's Renaissance architecture.

'''''Tales from the Crypt''''' is a 1972 British [[horror film]] directed by [[Freddie Francis]]. It is an [[anthology film]] consisting of five separate segments, based on stories from [[EC Comics]]. It was produced by [[Amicus Productions]] and filmed at [[Shepperton Studios]], and is one of several Amicus horror anthologies made during the 1970s.

In the film, five strangers ([[Joan Collins]], [[Ian Hendry]], [[Robin Phillips]], [[Richard Greene]] and [[Nigel Patrick]]) encounter the mysterious [[Crypt Keeper]] ([[Ralph Richardson]]) in a [[crypt]], and he tells each in turn the manner of their death.

==Plot==
===Intro===
Five strangers go with a tourist group to view old [[catacomb]]s. Separated from the main group, they find themselves in a room with the mysterious Crypt Keeper ([[Ralph Richardson]]), who details how each of the strangers may die.

===...And All Through the House===
* Taken from ''[[The Vault of Horror]]'' #35

Joanne Clayton ([[Joan Collins]]) kills her husband ([[Martin Boddey]]) on [[Christmas Eve]]. She prepares to hide his body, but hears a radio announcement stating that a homicidal maniac ([[Oliver MacGreevy]]) is on the loose. She sees the killer (who is dressed in a [[Santa Claus]] costume) outside her house, but cannot call the police without exposing her own crimes.

After cleaning up her crime, Joanne finally attempts to call the police. However, her young daughter ([[Chloe Franks]]) - believing the maniac to be Santa - unlocks the door and lets him into the house, whereupon he starts to strangle Joanne to death.

===Reflection of Death===
* Taken from ''[[Tales from the Crypt (comics)|Tales from the Crypt]]'' #23

Carl Maitland ([[Ian Hendry]]) abandons his family to be with Susan Blake ([[Angela Grant]]). After they drive off together, they are involved in a car accident. He wakes up in the wrecked car and attempts to hitch-hike home, but everyone he meets reacts with horror upon seeing him. Arriving at his house, he sees his wife (Susan Denny) with another man.

He knocks on the door, but she screams and slams the door. He then goes to see Susan to find out that she is blind from the accident. She says that Carl died two years ago in the crash. Glancing at a reflective tabletop, he sees he has the face of a rotted, hideous corpse and screams in horror. Carl then wakes up and finds out that it was a dream, but the moment he does, the crash occurs as previously seen.

===Poetic Justice===
* Taken from ''[[The Haunt of Fear]]'' No. 12, (March–April 1952)

Edward Elliott ([[David Markham]]) and his son James ([[Robin Phillips]]) are a snobbish pair who resent their neighbour, dustman Arthur Grimsdyke ([[Peter Cushing]]), who owns a number of dogs and entertains children in his house; James, in particular, strongly detests the old man. To get rid of what they see as a blight on the neighbourhood, they push Grimsdyke into a frenzy by conducting a [[smear campaign]] against him, first resulting in the removal of his beloved dogs (one of them returns to him), then persuading a member of the council to have him removed from his job, and later exploiting parents' paranoid fears about [[child molestation]].

On Valentine's Day, James sends Grimsdyke a number of poison-pen Valentines, supposedly from the neighbours, driving the old man to suicide. One year later, Grimsdyke comes back from the dead and takes revenge on James. The following morning, Edward finds his son dead with a note that said, "HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY--YOU WERE MEAN AND CRUEL-RIGHT FROM THE START-NOW YOU REALLY HAVE NO--!"Edward opens up the folded end of the note and realizes that the final word of that note is "HEART," represented by James's heart, which has been torn from his body while still beating.

===Wish You Were Here===
* ''Wish You Were Here'' (''The Haunt of Fear'' #22, November–December 1953), a variation on [[W. W. Jacobs]]'s famed short story "[[The Monkey's Paw]]".

Ineffective businessman Ralph Jason ([[Richard Greene]]) is close to financial ruin. His wife Enid ([[Barbara Murray]]) discovers a Chinese [[figurine]] that says it will grant three wishes to whoever possesses it; Enid decides to wish for a fortune; surprisingly, it comes true. However, Ralph is killed, seemingly in a car crash, on the way to his lawyer's office to collect it. The lawyer ([[Roy Dotrice]]) then advises Enid she will inherit a fortune from her deceased husband's life insurance plan. She uses her second wish to bring him back to the way he was just before the accident, but learns that his death was due to a heart attack immediately before the crash (caused by fright when he sees the figure of "death" following him on a motorcycle).

As she uses her final wish to bring him back alive and to live forever, she discovers too late that he was embalmed. She tries to kill him to end his pain but because she wished him to live forever, he cannot be killed. She has now trapped him in eternal pain.

===Blind Alleys===
* Taken from ''Tales from the Crypt'' No. 46 (February–March 1955)

Major William Rogers ([[Nigel Patrick]]), the mean new director of a home for the blind made up mostly of elderly and middle-aged men, makes drastic financial cuts, reducing heat and rationing food for the residents while he lives in luxury with his [[German Shepherd]], Shane. When Rogers ignores the pleas of resident George Carter ([[Patrick Magee (actor)|Patrick Magee]]) for help, another resident dies from the cold and a stone-faced Carter leads the others in exacting revenge. Carter and his group subdue the staff, then lock Rogers and Shane in separate rooms in the basement as they construct a small maze of narrow corridors between the two rooms. Rogers and Shane are starved, leading to the dog becoming ravenous.

After two days, Rogers' door is unlocked and he must find his way through with the lights off. He yells out in pain as Carter turns the lights on, discovering one corridor is lined with razor blades. Rogers makes it past, but finds Shane being let out from the room in front of him. He flees back towards the razors, but Carter turns the lights off and Rogers is heard screaming as the hungry dog catches up with him.

===Finale===
After completing the final tale, the Crypt Keeper reveals that he was not warning them of what would happen, but telling them what has already happened: they have all "died without repentance". Clues to this twist can be spotted throughout the film, including Joanna wearing the brooch her husband had given her for Christmas just before she killed him. The door to [[Hell]] opens and Joanna, Carl, James, Ralph, and Major Rogers all enter. "And now, who's next?" asks the Crypt Keeper, turning to face the camera as he says "Perhaps...YOU?" The scene pulls away as the entrance to the Crypt Keeper's lair is in flames.

== Production ==
[[Milton Subotsky]] of [[Amicus Productions]] had long been a fan of [[EC Comics]]' ''[[Tales from the Crypt (comics)|Tales from the Crypt]]'' and eventually persuaded his partner [[Max Rosenberg]] to buy the rights. The copyright owner, [[William Gaines]], insisted on script approval. The budget of £170,000 was higher than usual for an Amicus production, and was partly funded by [[American International Pictures]]. Peter Cushing was originally offered the part played by Richard Greene, but wanted to try something different and played the elderly Grimsdyke instead. Filming started on 13 September 1971 and finished in 1972.

== Critical reception ==
[[Rotten Tomatoes]], a [[review aggregator]], reports that 88% of 16 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1020820-tales_from_the_crypt/|title=Tales from the Crypt (1972)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film a positive review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19720315/REVIEWS/203150301/1023 |title=Tales from the Crypt |work=rogerebert.suntimes.com |accessdate=6 July 2012 |date=15 March 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[AllRovi|Allmovie]]'s review of the film was generally favourable, writing, "It has a certain magnetism about it that is hard to resist and which accounts for its enduring popularity.

== Points of interest ==
* Only two of the stories are from EC's ''Tales from the Crypt'' comic book. The reason for this, according to ''[[Creepy (magazine)|Creepy]]'' founding editor [[Russ Jones]], is that producer Milton Subotsky did not own a run of the original EC comic book but instead adapted the movie from the two paperback reprints given to him by Jones. The story ''Wish You Were Here'' was reprinted in the paperback collection ''[[The Vault of Horror (book)|The Vault of Horror]]'' (Ballantine, 1965). The other four stories in the movie were among the eight stories reprinted in ''[[Tales from the Crypt (book)|Tales from the Crypt]]'' (Ballantine, 1964).
* Richardson's hooded Crypt Keeper, more sombre than the EC original (as illustrated by [[Al Feldstein]] and [[Jack Davis (cartoonist)|Jack Davis]]), has a monk-like appearance and resembles EC's GhouLunatics. In the EC horror comics, the other horror hosts (the [[The Haunt of Fear#The Old Witch|Old Witch]] and the [[Vault-Keeper (comics)|Vault Keeper]]) wore hoods, while the Crypt Keeper did not.
* The earlier Amicus anthology film ''[[Torture Garden (film)|Torture Garden]]'' features a similar ending breaking the [[fourth wall]].
* The screenplay was adapted into a tie-in novel by [[Jack Oleck]], ''Tales from the Crypt'' (Bantam, 1972). Oleck, who wrote the novel ''Messalina'' (1950), also scripted for EC's Picto-Fiction titles, ''Crime Illustrated'', ''Shock Illustrated'' and ''Terror Illustrated''. A tie-in was also written by Oleck for the later Amicus anthology film ''The Vault of Horror'', released in 1973.

== Connections to the TV series ==
{{Original research|section|date=February 2015}}
''...And All Through the House'', ''Blind Alleys'' and ''Wish You Were Here'' were all somewhat remade into episodes for the ''[[Tales from the Crypt (TV series)|Tales From the Crypt]]'' television show. ''Blind Alleys'' and ''Wish You Were Here'' were both changed.

* ''...And All Through the House'' had the woman killing her husband so that she can take her daughter and live with her boyfriend. The episode ended with her daughter letting the axe-wielding maniac into the house as he quotes "Naughty or Nice" with the episode ending with the woman screaming. The Crypt Keeper stated that the daughter was not harmed because the escaped maniac liked older women....in pieces.

* ''Blind Alleys'' was now ''Revenge is the Nuts'' and was about a beautiful blind girl (portrayed by [[Teri Polo]]) who comes to live at a house for the blind where the sadistic director (played by ''[[The Dead Zone (film)|The Dead Zone]]'''s [[Anthony Zerbe]]) tries to sexually assault her. In the end, she and the other residents take their revenge on the director in the same fashion as in the original story.

* ''Wish You Were Here'' is similar to the TV series' 7th-season episode ''Last Respects'' in that both borrow plot elements from W. W. Jacobs's classic story "The Monkey's Paw", and both are directed by the original film's director [[Freddie Francis]]. Like many of the show's episodes, "Last Respects" uses the title of an existing story from the comics (''Tales From The Crypt'' #23), but does not use the story itself. The statue from the film is reverted to the original monkey's paw in the TV episode, and the story now deals with three sisters who come into possession of it. One wishes for a million pounds, and she and the second sister are in a car crash where she dies, and her life insurance policy is for one million pounds. When the third sister wishes that the dead sister was the way she was just before the crash, she learns that she was actually killed by the second sister. In a form of revenge, the third sister gives her last wish to her sister, but she did not say ''which'' sister she wanted to give it to, beating the monkey's paw at its own game. The wish is transferred to the dead sister who comes back to kill the second sister.

'''''The Dance of Life''''' or '''''Life's Dance''''' is an 1899&amp;ndash;1900 [[Expressionism|expressionist]] painting by [[Edvard Munch]], now in the [[National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design|National Museum of Art]] in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.edvardmunch.org/the-dance-of-life.jsp#prettyPhoto|title=The Dance of Life, 1899 by Edvard Munch|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was an important work in Munch's project "The Frieze of Life." In creating the paining, Munch was allegedly inspired by the [[Helge Rode]] play "''Dansen gaar,"'' of which Munch kept a copy in his personal library.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nasjonalmuseet.no/en/collections_and_research/our_collections/edvard_munch_in_the_national_museum/The+Dance+of+Life,+1899%E2%80%931900.b7C_wljW5c.ips|title=The Dance of Life, 1899–1900|website=nasjonalmuseet.no|language=en|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Olaf Schou purchased the paining in [[Oslo]] in 1910, immediately presenting it to the National Gallery.

'''''The Expulsion of the Déisi''''' is a medieval [[Ireland|Irish]] narrative of the [[Cycles of the Kings]]. It dates approximately to the 8th century, but survives only in manuscripts of a much later date. It describes the fictional history of the [[Déisi]], a group that had gained political power in parts of Ireland during the Early Middle Ages. Part of the text's purpose is to provide the kings of the Déisi – historically the descendants of unlanded [[vassal]]s to other tribes – with a mythical noble origin as the heirs to a dynasty expelled from [[Hill of Tara|Tara]].

The story survives in two different [[Old Irish]] versions, which contain essentially the same narrative supplemented by singular additions, including tangential episodes, lists of names, and poetry. After violently recovering his niece from the depredations of the king's son of Tara, [[Óengus Gaíbúaibthech]] and his followers are dispossessed by the king and sent to wander Ireland. They tarry in [[Leinster]] for a period, but are eventually expelled from that kingdom as well.  When military prowess fails them, they are able to forge a home for themselves through cunning and magic in [[Munster]] against the [[Kingdom of Ossory|Osraige]]. As with much early Irish literature, the digressive [[onomastics|onomastic]] and genealogical material is of great value. In particular, one passage describes a Déisi branch settling in [[Great Britain|Britain]] and founding the [[Kingdom of Dyfed]], a matter of some interest in the context of early Irish migrations to Britain.

==Versions and manuscripts==
The story survives in an earlier and a later version, which [[Kuno Meyer]] dubbed "A" and "B".&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, pp. 102–103.&lt;/ref&gt; The A version dates to the 8th century, but exists only in manuscripts of a significantly later date.&lt;ref name=Meyer102&gt;Meyer, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; It survives complete in Laud MS 610 and [[Rawlinson B 502|Rawlinson MS 502]], and in fragmentary form in the [[Book of Uí Maine]] and the Liber Flavus Fergusiorum.&lt;ref name=Meyer102/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hull 1954, p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the complete copies, Meyer notes that the Rawlinson text contains fewer errors, but that Laud preserves more archaic spelling.&lt;ref name=Meyer102/&gt; The B version survives in some form in three manuscripts. The oldest of these is a fragment contained in the [[Book of the Dun Cow]]; this copy is complemented by the later two, found in H. 3. 17 and H. 2. 5, allowing for reconstruction of the text.&lt;ref name=Meyer103&gt;Meyer, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; The H. 2. 5 copy further contains several poems absent from the other manuscripts.

The title is recorded variously in the manuscripts. Rawlinson contains ''Tairired na n'Déssi'', or ''The Journeying of the Déisi.''&lt;ref name=Meyernote&gt;Meyer, p. 102 and notes.&lt;/ref&gt; Laud records it as ''De causis torche n'Déssi''/''acuis toirge na n'Déssi''. The word ''torche/toirge'' is obscure, but Meyer associates it with "expedition".&lt;ref name=Meyernote/&gt; The B manuscripts all contain some reference to the injury visited upon [[Cormac mac Airt]], one of the characters: the Book of the Dun Cow has ''Tucait innarba na n'Dési im Mumain &amp; aided Cormaic'', H. 3. 17 has ''Cóechad Cormaic i Temraig'', and H. 2. 5 has ''Tucaid cháetcha Cormaic do Aengus Gaibuaibtheach &amp; aigeag Ceallaig &amp; fotha indarbtha na nDeissi do Muig Breag''.&lt;ref name=Meyer103/&gt; [[Marie Henri d'Arbois de Jubainville]]'s ''Catalogue'' further lists two possibly related titles: ''Longes Eithne Uathaige'' and ''Tochomlad na nDési a Temraig''.&lt;ref&gt;d'Arbois de Jubainville, p. 171, 263.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is unknown to which version, if either, these refer.&lt;ref name=Meyer103/&gt;

==Background==
{{main article|Déisi}}
The term ''[[Déisi]]'' initially designated various subject peoples owing tribute to landowning tribes. It derives from the [[Old Irish]] ''déis'', meaning "client(s)" or "vassalry"; this distinguishes it from other Irish ethonyms that derive from ancestors' personal names.&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Expulsion of the Déisi'' concerns one such group, the [[Déisi Muman]] of [[Kingdom of Munster|Munster]], who lived primarily in the present-day counties of [[County Waterford|Waterford]] and [[County Tipperary|Tipperary]] and were subject to the [[Eóganachta]] dynasty. Over time, the Déisi Muman grew in power, and were prominent enough to found their own local kingdom at a fairly early date. The various groups designated ''Déisi'' were not originally closely related, but by the mid-8th century, following the rise of the Déisi Muman, they came to be seen as a genealogically linked whole, descended from the same noble ancestors. ''The Explulsion of the Déisi'' gives a mythical origin narrative for the then powerful Déisi Muman and associated groups.&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, pp. 121–123.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Expulsion of the Déisi'' was long considered a more or less historically accurate account of a mass displacement of the Déisi and their subsequent settlement on the southwestern coast of Ireland and elsewhere. This was later disputed by scholars such as [[Eoin MacNeill|John MacNeill]], [[Patrick C. Power]], [[T. F. O'Rahilly]], and Séamus Pender, who regard it as late fiction.&lt;ref&gt;Hull 1959, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Narrative==
Both versions describe the adventures of the Déisi forefathers in the time of [[Cormac mac Airt]], [[King of Tara]]. They follow the same narrative track, but both contain sections that break from the main narrative and tell individual, largely unrelated stories about the Déisi and their contemporaries. A contains episodes not in B, and vice versa.

===A version===
In the A version, the Déisi are led by the four sons of Artchorp: Brecc, [[Óengus Gaíbúaibthech]] (Óengus of the Dread Spear), Eochaid Allmuir (Eochaid the Foreigner), and Forad. Forad's daughter Forach is raped and kidnapped by Conn (elsewhere Cellach), the "wanton son" of Cormac maic Airt. Óengus, who leads a band of fifty men, goes to [[Hill of Tara|Tara]] to rescue her. When Conn refuses to release the girl, Óengus runs him through with his "dread spear", which blinds Cormac in one eye in the process. Because the law forbids a high king to have a physical blemish, Cormac must retire to a [[ráth]] outside Tara, and defer the kingship to his son [[Cairbre Lifechair]]. Undeterred, Cormac raises his forces against the Déisi and expels them from Tara. Óengus, together with his brother Brecc's sons Russ and Eogan, engages the king in seven battles. After forty days Óengus succeeds Brecc as king of the Déisi, but steps down due to "murmurs" about his consolidation of the power of both champion and king. Cormac will not give the Déisi a fair fight, and pushes them into [[Leinster]], where the local ruler Fiachu Bacceda drives the [[Uí Bairrche]] from their land and gives it to the Déisi. They remain there for three decades.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, pp. 104–109 (sect. 1–6).&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually the Uí Bairrche warrior Eochu Guinech ejects the Déisi and they are compelled to move further south into Ard Ladrann, thereafter known as the "Land of the Wandering Host". Section 8 tells the story of Ethne the Dread, daughter of then King of Leinster [[Crimthann mac Énnai]] (d. 483) and an eventual fosterling of the Déisi. At her birth a [[druid]] prophesies that under Ethne her mother's kindred will seize what will be their homeland; hearing this her parents feed her the flesh of young boys to accelerate her growth. Meanwhile, Cormac continues to harass Óengus and the Déisi, stirring up discord among their warriors and leaders. He sends a peace offer to Russ and Eogan, the sons of Brecc, offering them absolution and land if they return to his service. Óengus promises them yet more land and preeminence over his children for them to remain.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, pp. 108–115 (sect. 7–12).&lt;/ref&gt;

When Crimthann mac Énnai dies, his sons turn on the Déisi, driving them out of Leinster altogether. They settle briefly in [[Kingdom of Osraige|Osraige]], but the king burns down their houses, leaving them homeless and forced to wander west into [[Munster]]. They receive some relief when [[Óengus mac Nad Froích]] (d. 489), King of Munster, proposes to marry Ethne the Dread, who has been traveling with the Déisi. He offers to grant her any three demands as the dowry. Ethne requests land for her mother's kindred, fulfilling her prophecy; she also requests that Osraige be cleared of its inhabitants and given to the Déisi, and that her people be as free as the "three [[Eóganachta|Eoganacht]] of Munster". Óengus grants her wishes, but the Déisi are unable to oust the residents of Osraige. With the help of Lugaid Laigde Cosc, the seer-judge of the [[Corcu Loígde]] and [[Cashel, County Tipperary|Cashel]], they devise a trick: learning of a prophecy that whichever side draws first blood the next day will be routed, the Déisi druids transform one of their men into a red cow. The men of Osraige kill the cow, thereby sealing their fate; they are pushed across the Lingaun River, which thereafter serves as the border between the Déisi and Osraige. The Déisi divide up their land, and most of the remainder of the text lists names of individual Déisi and [[sept]]s descended from them.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, pp. 114–131 (sect. 13–23).&lt;/ref&gt;

===B version===

The B version contains the same basic narrative, with significant additions and subtractions. It was edited (Irish only) by Meyer in ''Anecdd.'' I,&lt;ref&gt;Kuno Meyer, ed., ''Tucait indarba na nD&amp;eacute;ssi'' (Expulsion of the Déssi), in ''Anecdota from Irish Manuscripts'', vol. i. (1907), [https://books.google.com/books?id=mdUfAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA15 pp.15-24]&lt;/ref&gt; with TCD MS 1316 (olim H. 2.15a), pp.&amp;nbsp;67a-68b (''H'' text) as base, with footnoted readings from MS 1336 (olim H. 3.17), col. 720b-723a (''h'' text).

It likewise begins with the kidnapping of Forach by Cormac's son (here Cellach), but in this version Óengus is initially too busy avenging family insults with his famous spear to save her. It is only after he is rebuked for his dithering by a woman – whom he kills – that he rescues Forach, killing Cellach and blinding Cormac in the process. The story continues with the Déisi's expulsion from Tara, their sojourn in Leinster, and their patriation in Munster following the marriage arrangement between Ethne the Dread and Óengus mac Nad Froích. Here, however, aid in exploiting the prophecy that ultimately allows them to displace the men of Osraige comes not from a seer-judge, but from the "haughty daughter" of the Osraige druid who delivers the prognostication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/dessi2.html ''This Is The Cause Of The Expulsion Of The Déssi To Munster And The Violent Death Of Cormac'', sect. 1–15.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the material not in the A version, by far the most substantial is in a lengthy tangential episode dealing with the birth and childhood of Óengus' foster son Corc Duibne, progenitor of the [[Corcu Duibne]], whose name is merely mentioned in A. Corc and his brother are born of incest to Coirpre Múse and Duihind, children of the king of Munster [[Conaire Cóem]], and their nativity brings famine to the land. The people want them immolated, but Corc is saved by a druid and his wife who take him to an offshore island so that his curse is removed from Ireland. The druid's wife, Boí, performs purification rituals that ultimately transfer Corc's curse to an otherworldy white cow, allowing him to return to his family. Eventually he serves as hostage in Cormac mac Airt's court, where he is fostered by Óengus; he accompanies his foster father when he is expelled from Tara. He tries to convince the wandering Déisi to settle on the island of his rearing, and stays there when the Déisi opt to move on to Cashel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/dessi2.html ''This Is The Cause Of The Expulsion Of The Déssi To Munster And The Violent Death Of Cormac'', sect. 1–12.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The variant text MS 1336 (olim H. 3.17) occurs with the different title, ''Cóecad Cormaic i Temraig'' (Blinding of Cormac at Tara); and this text is also postscripted by a tract which alleges that the Crimall, the spear in the age of Cormac, was also the same weapon as the [[Lúin of Celtchar]] and the spear of [[Lugh]].&lt;ref&gt;Arbois de Jubainville, ''Essai d'un catalogue'', p.90&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dyfed==
Section 11 of A describes Eochaid son of Artchorp traveling oversea with his descendants and settling in ''Demed'' ([[Demetia]], later known as [[Kingdom of Dyfed|Dyfed]] in [[Wales]]). From Eochaid and his descendants springs the line of kings of Dyfed, whose descent is given down to "Tualodor mac Rígin" (Tudor map Regin).&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, pp. 112–113.&lt;/ref&gt; This genealogy has much correspondence with pedigrees in Welsh sources, namely the [[Harleian genealogies]] and the later [[genealogies from Jesus College MS 20]]. The Harleian records show the same names from Tudor back to the figure Triphun, given in ''Expulsion'' as Eochaid's great-grandson. However, Harleian gives an entirely different pedigree for Triphun himself, tracing his descent back to the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Constantine I]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kmatthews.org.uk/history/harleian_genealogies/2.html Harleian genealogy 2].&lt;/ref&gt; This could be an attempt by later genealogists to give a more illustrious pedigree to Dyfed's kingly line, or possibly to obscure its Irish origins. However, it could be that Harleian preserves the older and more accurate version, and that the ''Expulsion'' version is a later textual corruption.

Regardless, there is indeed evidence of early Irish presence in Dyfed and elsewhere in Britain. [[Ogham]] inscriptions in an early form of [[Irish language|Irish]] have been found in [[Pembrokeshire]] and [[Carmarthenshire]].&lt;ref name=TCW163&gt;Charles-Williams, p. 163 and notes.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, later literary sources from both sides of the [[Irish Sea]] discuss the presence of southern Irish peoples in Britain. The 9th-century ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'', for instance, refers to the [[Uí Liatháin]] being active in Dyfed until they were pushed out by [[Cunedda]] and his sons (fl. mid-5th century).&lt;ref&gt;[[s:History of the Britons#1:14|''Historia Brittonum'', ch. 14]].&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Cormac's Glossary]]'' also mentions the oversea exploits of the Uí Liatháin, but locates their fortress in [[Cornwall]] rather than Dyfed.&lt;ref name=TCW163/&gt; However, only ''The Expulsion of the Déisi'' attests a specifically Déisi presence. [[Eoin MacNeill]], who treats the literary accounts as largely historical, suggests that a Déisi settlement in Dyfed could have existed as a subordinate unit to a larger Uí Liatháin-led colony until the latter was expelled under Cunedda.&lt;ref&gt;MacNeill, pp. 128–130.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Royal Albert Dock'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Liverpool's Albert Dock gets royal title |publisher=[[BBC News]] |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-44368901 |date=6 June 2018|access-date=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a complex of dock buildings and warehouses in [[Liverpool]], [[England]]. Designed by [[Jesse Hartley]] and [[Philip Hardwick]], it was opened in 1846, and was the first structure in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] to be built from cast iron, brick and stone, with no structural wood. As a result, it was the first non-combustible warehouse system in the world.&lt;ref name=p83&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of its construction the Albert Dock (as it was formerly known before receiving its Royal status in 2018) was considered a revolutionary docking system because ships were loaded and unloaded directly from/to the warehouses. Two years after it opened it was modified to feature the world's first [[hydraulic]] [[Crane (machine)|cranes]].&lt;ref name=p46&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its open yet secure design, the Albert Dock became a popular store for valuable cargoes such as [[brandy]], [[cotton]], [[tea]], [[silk]], [[tobacco]], [[ivory]] and [[sugar]]. However, despite the Albert Dock's advanced design, the rapid development of shipping technology meant that within 50 years, larger, more open docks were required, although it remained a valuable store for cargo.

During the [[World War II|Second World War]], the Albert Dock was requisitioned by the [[Admiralty]] serving as a base for boats of the [[Home Fleet|British Atlantic Fleet]]. The complex was damaged during [[Strategic bombing|air raids]] on Liverpool, notably during the [[Liverpool Blitz|May Blitz]] of 1941. In the aftermath of the war, the financial problems of the owners and the general decline of docking in the city meant that the future of the Albert Dock was uncertain. Numerous plans were developed for the re-use of the buildings but none came to fruition and in 1972 the dock was finally closed. Having lain derelict for nearly ten years, the redevelopment of the dock began in 1981, when the [[Merseyside Development Corporation]] was set up, with the Albert Dock being officially re-opened in 1984.

Today the Royal Albert Dock is a major tourist attraction in the city and the most visited multi-use attraction in the [[United Kingdom]], outside [[London]].&lt;ref name="Albert Dock: The Present Day"&gt;{{cite web |title=Albert Dock: The Present Day |publisher=Albert Dock Company Ltd |url=http://www.albertdock.com/pages/index.php?page_id=1257 |access-date=24 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a vital component of Liverpool's [[UNESCO]] designated [[World Heritage]] [[Maritime Mercantile City]] and the docking complex and warehouses also comprise the largest single collection of [[Grade I]] [[listed buildings]] anywhere in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/cityofculture2008/story/0,,950372,00.html |title=Glory of Greece, grandeur of Rome ... and docks of Liverpool |publisher=Guardian Unlimited |date=7 March 2003 |author=Helen Carter |access-date=27 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Grand beginnings and early history===

[[Image:Albert Docks Liverpool.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Albert Dock's design allowed ships to lay up and be loaded and unloaded directly from the large warehouses]]
The history of the Albert Dock dates back to 1837, when Jesse Hartley first began the development of plans for a combined [[Dock (maritime)|dock]] and [[warehouse]] system.&lt;ref name="p83" /&gt; The plans drawn up by Hartley and fellow [[civil engineer]] Philip Hardwick for the Albert Dock were at the time considered quite 'radical', as they envisioned the loading and unloading of ships directly from the warehouses.&lt;ref name=heyday&gt;{{cite web |title=Construction, heyday and decline of the Albert Dock |publisher=[[National Museums Liverpool]] |url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/maritime/albertdock/historyofthealbertdock.asp |access-date=26 September 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906100035/http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/maritime/albertdock/historyofthealbertdock.asp |archivedate=6 September 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this idea was not new, and as far back as the 1803 Warehousing Act, legislation had been passed to allow this form of development to occur, whilst the concept was first actually used in the construction of [[St Katharine Docks|St Katharine's Dock]] in [[London]], which was opened in 1828.&lt;ref name=p18&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the development process, Hartley was eager to test the fire resistance of any particular design by constructing an {{convert|18|ft|m|abbr=on}} by {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=on}} dummy structure, filling it with timber and tar, and setting it alight. After testing several structural designs he settled on the combination of [[cast iron]], [[brick]], [[sandstone]] and [[granite]].&lt;ref name="p20"/&gt; The design was submitted for [[planning permission]] in 1839 although it wasn't until 1841, when the [[Act of Parliament|bill]] authorising the design of the dock was eventually passed by [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], that construction was allowed to begin.&lt;ref name=p19&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hist&gt;{{cite web |title=Albert Dock History |publisher=Albert Dock Company Ltd |url=http://www.albertdock.com/pages/index.php?page_id=2 |access-date=24 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Jesse Hartley.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Jesse Hartley]]
The site chosen for the dock to be built on was an area of land bordered by [[Salthouse Dock]] to the east, the entrance channel to [[Canning Dock]] to the north and by [[Duke's Dock]] to the south. The land earmarked for the site had to be cleared, with 59 tenants being evicted and numerous premises demolished including a [[pub]], several houses and the Dock Trustee's Dockyard.&lt;ref name=p20&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the clearance of this land both the Salthouse and Canning dock's were drained to allow entrance passages into the Albert Dock to be constructed, whilst hundreds of '[[Navvies]]' were employed to dig out the dock basin and construct the new river wall. The dock basin was completed by February 1845, allowing the first ships to enter the Albert Dock, although with the warehouses still under construction this was merely to allow these boats to 'lay-up'.&lt;ref name=p23&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dock complex was officially opened in 1846 by [[Albert, Prince Consort]], husband of [[Queen Victoria]] and the man in honour of whom it was named. This event marked the first occasion in [[Liverpool]]'s history in which a member of the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]] had made a state visit to the city and as a result the occasion was marked with a major celebrations.&lt;ref name=p12&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many thousands of people turned out for the Royal visit with the newspaper ''The Pictorial Times'' noting the reception Prince Albert received:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"His reception was most enthusiastic; balconies were erected along the line of procession, and these and the windows of houses were filled with gay and animated parties. There was a most brilliant display of flags, banners &amp; c. [sic]. All business is suspended. There are 200,000 strangers in town, and all the inhabitants are in the streets. All is gaiety and splendour." (''The Pictorial Times'', 1846).&lt;ref name=p13&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Prince was taken on a processional tour through the city, including a visit to the [[Liverpool Town Hall|town hall]] where the royal address was made, before departing aboard the ferry across to the [[Cheshire]] side of the [[Mersey]] and then northwards towards the Albert Dock.&lt;ref name=p13/&gt;&lt;ref name=p14&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Again this stage of the procession route was laden with onlookers with ''The Pictorial Times'' describing the Prince's entrance into the Albert Dock:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"From the Cheshire side of the river the Fairy crossed to the Liverpool side, and returned along the line of docks amidst the cheers of assembled thousands and the roar of artillery. The sight was really magnificent, all the ships in the docks were decked out in gayest colours and the river was crowded with boats filled with people. At half-past two the fairy entered the dock, where were assembled two thousand ladies and gentlemen, the elite of the town; they cheered enthusiastically, which his Royal Highness returned, and in order to gratify the crowd sailed round the dock." (''The Pictorial Times'', 1846).&lt;ref name=p14/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite the official opening occurring in 1846, the construction of the Albert Dock was not fully completed until 1847. In 1848, a new dock office was built and the dock itself was upgraded to feature a [[hydraulic]] cargo handling [[Hoist (device)|hoist]] system, the first of its kind in the world.&lt;ref name=p46/&gt; Over the next decade several more buildings where added including houses for the [[Harbourmaster|piermaster]], his assistant &amp; the warehouse superintendent; and a [[cooper (profession)|cooper]]age. Warehousing in the dock was also expanded to meet the increasing demand by joining together the eastern and western ends of the Southern Stack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Historic Facts 1824 - 1854 |publisher=Albert Dock Company Ltd |url=http://www.albertdock.com/pages/index.php?page_id=1213 |access-date=2 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changing fortunes and role in the Second World War===

[[Image:Dkbkpl28.jpg|right|thumb|British Empire Dockyards and Ports, 1909]]
The enclosed design of the Albert Dock and the direct loading and unloading of goods from warehouses meant that the complex was more secure than other docks within [[Liverpool]]. As a result it became a popular store for valuable cargoes including [[brandy]], [[cotton]], [[tea]], [[silk]], [[tobacco]], [[ivory]] and [[sugar]]. At the same time their openness to natural light and well ventilated stores meant natural goods such as [[hemp]] or sugar could be kept fresher, for longer.&lt;ref name=heyday/&gt; The dock came to dominate Liverpool's far eastern trade, with over 90% of the city's silk imports from [[China]] coming through it and more generally half of all the far eastern trade income.&lt;ref name=p24&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the great prosperity the dock afforded the city, within 20 years of its construction the Albert Dock was beginning to struggle.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chrimes|1991|p=76}}: "arguably out-of-date before they were built"&lt;/ref&gt; Designed and constructed to handle sailing ships of up to 1,000&amp;nbsp;tonnes, by the start of the 20th century only 7% of ships into the [[Port of Liverpool]] were sailing vessels.&lt;ref name=Hist/&gt; The development of steam ships in the later 19th century meant that soon the dock simply wasn't large enough, as its narrow entrances prevented larger vessels from entering it.&lt;ref name="p24"/&gt; Its lack of quayside was also becoming an issue. Generally [[steamship]]s could be loaded and unloaded far quicker than [[sailing ship]]s, and in a cruel twist of irony, the dockside warehouses that had once made the Albert Dock so attractive, were now hindering its future development.&lt;ref name=heyday/&gt; Nonetheless the Albert Dock remained an integral part of the dock system in Liverpool and in 1878 the [[pump house]] was built as part of redevelopment that saw the majority of the cranes converted to hydraulic use, whilst in 1899, part of the north stack was converted to allow for ice production and cold storage.&lt;ref name=hf1860&gt;{{cite web |title=Historic Facts 1860 - 1970 |publisher=Albert Dock Company Ltd|url=http://www.albertdock.com/pages/index.php?page_id=1213 |access-date=2 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1920s virtually all commercial shipping activity had ceased at the dock, although its warehouses did remain in use for the storage of goods transported by barge, road or rail.&lt;ref name=hf1860/&gt;&lt;ref name=p47&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; The onset of the [[World War II|Second World War]] in 1939 saw the Albert Dock being 'requisitioned' by the [[Admiralty]] and used as base for the [[Home Fleet|British Atlantic fleet]] including submarines, small warships and landing craft. During the war the dock was struck on several occasions including a bombing raid in 1940 that damaged ships within it, and more destructively during the [[Liverpool Blitz#The May Blitz|May Blitz]] of 1941 when German bombing caused extensive damage to the south west stack.&lt;ref name=p47/&gt; By the end of the war almost 15% of the Albert Dock's floor space was out of use because of bomb damage.&lt;ref name=p28&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post War history and decline===

By the time the Second World War had finished the Albert Dock's future looked bleak. The owners of the dock, the [[Mersey Docks and Harbour Board]] (MDHB) were in financial crisis and chose not to repair any of the wartime bomb damage, adopting an attitude of 'if it's not broke don't fix it, and if it is broke we still won't fix it'.&lt;ref name=p29&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time a change in geo-political orientation towards [[Europe]], coupled with the advent of [[containerisation]] meant the whole docking system in the city of Liverpool suffered as newer, stronger ports emerged elsewhere in the [[UK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Belchem|2006|loc=Chpt. Milne, G.J. "Maritime Liverpool"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless the architectural and technological value of the docks was recognised in 1952 when the Albert Dock was granted Grade I [[listed building]] status.&lt;ref name=hf1860/&gt;

Despite this recognition, the increasing debts of the MDHB meant that by the 1960s the company was eager to get rid of the Albert Dock. Having considered demolishing the buildings and redeveloping the land,&lt;ref name=p47/&gt; the MDHB soon entered negotiations to sell the land to Oldham Estates, a property developer owned by [[Harry Hyams]].&lt;ref name=p29/&gt; Many plans for the site were developed including one that envisioned the development of a mini city that would provide 10m sq feet of letting space, hotels, restaurants, bars and underground parking in the drained dock basin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=City's Reputation Will Depend Upon Waterfront Plan |newspaper=[[Liverpool Echo]] |date=30 May 1966 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the council reluctant to allow such a ''grandiose'' development to occur and with the huge public opposition to it (inspired at least in part by the work of [[Quentin Hughes (architect)|Quentin Hughes]]), Oldham Estates were forced into scaling-down the plan and so in 1970 returned with a new vision known as 'Aquarius City', which had as its centrepiece a 44-storey skyscraper. Once again the plan failed to develop and no sooner had it been announced, than the MDHB's financial problems reached crisis point, Oldham Estates withdrew their deposit and the whole scheme fell through.&lt;ref name=p29/&gt;

[[Image:The Albert Dock from the River Mersey, 1979.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Albert Dock viewed from the [[River Mersey]] in 1979]]
With the MDHB on the verge of bankruptcy a decision was taken to shut down and sell off the whole of the south docks system. The warehouses were emptied and in 1972 the Albert Dock finally closed down. The [[Brunswick Dock]] gates, which separated the South Docks system from the [[River Mersey]], were opened allowing tidal movements in and the process of the clogging up the docks with sewage polluted silt began.&lt;ref name=p48&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=p30&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many senses just as the Albert Dock's development had symbolised the prosperity in the Liverpool at the time of its construction, its subsequent decline after the Second World War symbolised the collapse of the local economy as a whole.&lt;ref name=belchem&gt;{{harvnb|Belchem|2006|loc=Chpt. Murden, John "City of Change and Challenge: Liverpool Since 1945"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the early 1970s plans continued to emerge for the redevelopment of the Albert Dock site and the whole of the south docks system in general. Many of these plans were quite extreme including [[Liverpool City Council]]'s suggestion to use the dock basin as a [[landfill]] site. The [[Mersey Docks and Harbour Company]] (MDHC), the reincarnation of the now defunct Mersey Docks and Harbour Board, however felt it could get more money by filling in the dock basin with sand and selling it as developable land and not derelict land. One plan for the Albert Dock that was taken more seriously was the idea that it become the new home of [[Liverpool Polytechnic]] (now John Moores University). The government was even willing to provide £3m in funding but like so many other plans this too fell by the wayside.&lt;ref name=p31&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of [[Merseyside County Council]] (MCC) in 1974 brought new hope that the Albert Dock could be redeveloped, with the MCC placing a high priority on its development. They soon entered negotiations with the MDHC and in 1979 eventually negotiated a deal to take over the running of the south docks.&lt;ref name=hf1972&gt;{{cite web |title=Historic Facts Historic Facts 1972 - 2002 |publisher=Albert Dock Company Ltd |url=http://www.albertdock.com/pages/index.php?page_id=1313 |access-date=2 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this seeming step forward political wrangling between the MDHC (the dock owners), [[Liverpool City Council]] (the local planning authority) and [[Merseyside County Council]] (the group now responsible for redeveloping the docks) continued to hinder any development plans.&lt;ref name="p31" /&gt; Fed up with the in fighting the newly elected Conservative government of [[Margaret Thatcher]] decided that the city was incapable of handling regeneration initiatives itself and under the guidance of the 'Minister for Merseyside' [[Michael Heseltine]], set up the Merseyside Development Corporation in 1981 to take over the responsibility of regenerating and redeveloping Liverpool's south docks.&lt;ref name=belchem/&gt;&lt;ref name=p32&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The MDC and regeneration of the Albert Dock===

The creation of the [[Merseyside Development Corporation]] (MDC) in 1981 was part of a [[Development Corporation|new initiative]] launched by the then [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government that earmarked the regeneration of some {{convert|800|acre|km2}} of Liverpool's south docks, by using public sector investment to create infrastructure within an area that could then in turn be used to attract private sector investment. Thus the MDC was not directly responsible for [[urban renewal|regeneration]] programmes but rather acted as a spearhead, guiding the development process. Upon its formation it immediately created an initial strategy for the area placing a high priority on restoring those buildings that could be restored &amp; demolishing the rest, restoring a water regime within the dock system (including the removal of up to {{convert|40|ft|m|abbr=on}} of silt) and general environmental landscaping. As part of the strategy two flagship schemes were set up: the redevelopment of a site in [[Otterspool Promenade|Otterspool]] for the [[International Garden Festival]] and the regeneration of the Albert Dock.&lt;ref name="p32" /&gt;

In 1982 the MDC entered into negotiations with [[London]]-based developers Arrowcroft in order to secure much needed private sector investment. On a visit to the site, Arrowcroft's chairman Leonard Eppel spoke of how the buildings "talked to him" and upon his return to London set about persuading the company's board to take on the project.&lt;ref name=p33&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1983 a deal was signed between Arrowcroft plc and the MDC leading to the creation of the Albert Dock Company, which could now start the process of regenerating the Albert Dock.&lt;ref name=creating&gt;{{cite web|title=Creating a museum |publisher=[[National Museums Liverpool]] |url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/maritime/albertdock/creatingamuseum.asp |access-date=6 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720073139/http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/maritime/albertdock/creatingamuseum.asp |archivedate=20 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Albert Dock2.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The former Dock Office was for many years the home of [[Granada Television]] in Liverpool.]]
One of the first priorities of the regeneration was the restoration of the dock system, which had deteriorated rapidly since the [[Brunswick Dock]] gates had been left open. Contaminated silt was removed from the dock basin, dock gates were replaced &amp; bridges restored, whilst the dock walls were repaired.&lt;ref name=p34&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Albert Dock company appointed [[Tarmac Group|Tarmac Construction]] to renovate the dock's vast warehouses and repair war time bomb damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ritchie|1999|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Structural surveys carried out by the MDC found the brickwork and foundations to be in very good condition and it was considered a testament to the strict build quality of [[Jesse Hartley|Hartley]]'s design that a building almost 150 years old was still in such good condition.&lt;ref name=p34/&gt;

Development within the Albert Dock was rapid and the newly renovated Edward Pavilion (formerly north east stack) was ready in time for the 1984 [[Tall Ships' Races|Cutty Sark Tall Ship Race]]. The race was a big success for the city with over one million visitors into Liverpool over a period of four days, of which 160,000 visited the Albert Dock. In total it is estimated that the two flagship regeneration schemes of the MDC, the tall ships race and International Garden Festival, attracted over 3.5 million visitors to Liverpool in 1984. Also completed in 1984 was the renovation of the dock traffic office, which was fitted out and leased to [[Granada Television]].&lt;ref name=p35&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Weather docks.jpg|thumb|right|175px|The floating weather map of the British Isles, from [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s ''[[This Morning (TV series)|This Morning]]'']]

Spurred by the success of the tall ships race and the International Garden Festival, Arrowcroft pushed on with the Albert Dock's renovation. With the Edward Pavilion refurbishment a success soon the company started on the Britannia and Atlantic pavilions (formerly the south and south east stacks), the latter of which required major structural repairs because of bomb damage it received during World War II. In 1986 the [[Merseyside Maritime Museum]] completed its move into the Albert Dock, having moved some exhibitions into the building in 1984. The museum, developed by [[Merseyside County Council]] had previously been located in the [[pilotage]] building and a salvage shed nearby.&lt;ref name=creating/&gt; Also in 1986 work began on the largest of the dock warehouses, the Colonnades (formerly west stack). Ground floor shops were created with office space on the [[Mezzanine (architecture)|mezzanine]] level and apartments on the remaining floors. The first 37 of these apartments were completed by 1988 and the speed with which they sold was likened to 'sales day at [[Harrods]]'.&lt;ref name=p36&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Albert Dock was officially re-opened in 1988 by [[Charles, Prince of Wales|The Prince of Wales]],&lt;ref name=p37&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; the great-great-great-grandson of [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], the man who had originally opened the docks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Royal Family Tree |publisher=Britroyals.com |url=http://www.britroyals.com/royaltree.htm |access-date=25 September 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080913184759/http://www.britroyals.com/royaltree.htm| archivedate= 13 September 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was timed to coincide with the opening of the newly finished [[Tate Liverpool]], which was dubbed the 'Tate of the north' and at the time the only one outside London.&lt;ref name=p49&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision to locate a [[Tate]] gallery in Liverpool was seen as a major success for the city, as it made Liverpool home to the National Collection of [[modern art]] in the North of England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Tate Liverpool |publisher=Tate |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/about/who-we-are/history-of-tate#liverpool |access-date=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988 [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s new morning television show ''[[This Morning (TV series)|This Morning]]'', hosted by [[Richard and Judy]], began broadcasting from a studio inside the Albert Dock. As part of the show weather presenter [[Fred Talbot]] used a floating map of the British Isles to report the forecast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Warwick |first=Dave |title=Fred Talbot |url=http://www.davewarwick.co.uk/dave_warwick_fred_talbot.htm |access-date=10 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later in 1990 [[The Beatles Story]] museum opened, the only [[Beatles]] themed visitor attraction in Britain, providing yet another draw to the Albert Dock.&lt;ref name=p37/&gt;

Throughout the 1990s development continued including a new hotel and the conversion of vacant space for use by larger companies such as [[Telewest]] (Now Virgin Media).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hodgson |first=Neil |title=Telewest jobs announcement |publisher=icLiverpool |date=14 June 2002 |url=http://icliverpool.icnetwork.co.uk/0100news/0100regionalnews/page.cfm?objectid=11951315&amp;method=full&amp;siteid=50061 |access-date=10 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally in 2003, some 22 years after the renovation of the Albert Dock started, the last remaining undeveloped space was brought into use with the opening of a new [[Premier Lodge]] hotel in the Britannia Pavilion.&lt;ref name=p37/&gt;

In lieu of the dock's 175 anniversary in 2021, the owners of the dock applied for a royal charter. At a event at Tate Liverpool on 6th June 2018 the royal charter was handed over. The dock will be formally known as Royal Albert Dock Liverpool to avoid confusion with the Royal Albert Dock in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Royal title for Liverpool's Albert Dock |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-44368901 |website=BBC News |accessdate=6 June 2018 |date=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Houghton |first1=Alistair |title=New Royal name for the Albert Dock |url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/business/albert-dock-renamed-royal-albert-14748439 |website=liverpoolecho |accessdate=6 June 2018 |date=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structural design and construction==

When it was constructed the Albert Dock was considered a [[state of the art]] docking system.&lt;ref name="p24" /&gt; Built almost entirely from [[cast iron]], [[Rock (geology)|stone]] and [[brick]], the Albert Dock was designed to be fireproof, and on completion was the world's first non-combustible warehouse system. It provided {{convert|1290000|sqft|m2}} of warehouse space and its dock basin had a water area of {{convert|7.75|acre|ha}}. In its construction over 23 million bricks were used and 47,000 tonnes of mortar.&lt;ref name="p83"/&gt; In total it cost £782,265 (approximately £41m today),&lt;ref name=heyday/&gt; whilst today its estimated to be worth £230 million.&lt;ref name=p38&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building's design complements many existing construction techniques with, what were considered at the time, radical solutions. The warehouses are supported by large [[load-bearing wall]]s that range from being {{convert|3|ft|m}} thick at the base to {{convert|19|in}} on the fourth level. One of the most advanced architectural features is the use of [[stressed skin]] roofing, which at the time of construction was virtually unheard of. Huge iron [[trusses]] are crossed with [[rivet]]ted and [[galvanised]] [[wrought iron]] plates, creating a shape similar to an upturned boat hull that acts to support the roof above.&lt;ref name=p22&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The floors in the warehouses are supported by large iron columns and the spaces between were considered 'highly flexible', as new windows, stairwells and lift shafts could be added without risk to the building's structural integrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Albert Dock Warehouses |publisher=Liverpool World Heritage |url=http://www.liverpoolworldheritage.com/visitingthewhs/areas/albertdock/Albert_Dock_warehouses.asp |access-date=5 March 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090629045643/http://www.liverpoolworldheritage.com/visitingthewhs/areas/albertdock/Albert_Dock_warehouses.asp|archivedate=29 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Albert Dock Liverpool 4.jpg|thumb|left|Huge cast iron columns line the Albert Dock's quayside helping to support the building above]]
The advanced design stretches far beyond what can be seen from the ground. The structures are free from wood, but their foundations contain 13,729 [[Deep foundation|piles]] of timber, which would stretch for {{Convert|48|mi|km}} in length if laid end to end. Such heavily supportive foundations were needed because the construction land was reclaimed from the [[River Mersey]] to build on. Given the '[[quicksand]]' nature of the Mersey's tidal silt the piles were needed to provide maximum stability. The resultant effect of the dock being constructed where it was is that the north and west stacks (now Merseyside Maritime Museum and Colonnades) rise and fall with every tide.&lt;ref name="p20" /&gt;

One of the most notable features of the Albert Dock are the huge cast iron columns that line the quayside.&lt;ref name=p21&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; At {{convert|15|ft|m}} high and almost {{convert|13|ft|m}} in circumference, the columns are based upon the Greek [[Doric style]] of architecture.&lt;ref name=hughes&gt;{{harvnb|Hughes|1999|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jesse Hartley|Hartley]]'s decision to use cast iron was an economic one as at the time it was cheaper than [[granite]]. Nonetheless, because of the huge dock walls that were built, the Albert Dock's construction required so much granite that the dock trustee's had to open their own mine in [[Kirkcudbrightshire]] in [[Scotland]].&lt;ref name=heyday/&gt;&lt;ref name=p21/&gt; The quality of the build materials used as well as the docks sheer size are considered a strong illustration of the great prosperity that the [[Port of Liverpool]] afforded the city at the time and the building's style is described as [[cyclopean]] [[classicism]].&lt;ref name=hughes/&gt;

==Albert Dock today==
Today the Albert Dock is one of Liverpool's most important tourist attractions and a vital component of the city's [[UNESCO world heritage]] [[Maritime Mercantile City]]. As well as being the number one tourist attraction in Liverpool,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Albert Dock |publisher=VisitLiverpool.com|url=http://www.visitliverpool.com/site/albert-dock-p16143 |access-date=24 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Albert Dock is also the most visited multi-use attraction in the [[United Kingdom]] outside [[London]], with in excess of four million visitors per year.&lt;ref name="Albert Dock: The Present Day" /&gt; Amongst the many attractions at the Albert Dock are the [[Merseyside Maritime Museum]], [[the Beatles Story]]  and the [[Tate Liverpool]]. There are also two hotels within the Albert Dock: a [[Holiday Inn]] and [[Premier Inn]] both located in the Britannia Pavilion.&lt;ref name="p82"&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the five warehouses around the dock, referred to as A, B, C, D and E, are Grade&amp;nbsp;I listed buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{National Heritage List for England |num= 1205175|desc= Warehouse A, Albert Dock|access-date= 21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{National Heritage List for England |num= 1068409|desc= Warehouses B and C, Albert Dock|access-date= 21 March 2015|fewer-links=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{National Heritage List for England |num= 1280847|desc= Warehouse D, Albert Dock|access-date= 21 March 2015|fewer-links=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{National Heritage List for England |num= 1068410|desc= Warehouse E, Albert Dock|access-date= 21 March 2015|fewer-links=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also listed Grade&amp;nbsp;I is the former dock traffic office.&lt;ref&gt;{{National Heritage List for England |num= 1356264|desc= Dock Traffic Office, Albert Dock|access-date= 21 March 2015|fewer-links=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other buildings around the dock are listed Grade&amp;nbsp;II; they are the former hydraulic pumping station,&lt;ref&gt;{{National Heritage List for England |num= 1280849|desc= Hydraulic Pumping Station to East of Canning Half-Tide Dock |access-date= 21 March 2015|fewer-links=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[swing bridge]] leading from the dock towards the Pierhead.&lt;ref&gt;{{National Heritage List for England |num= 1356265|desc= Swingbridge, Albert Dock |access-date= 21 March 2015|fewer-links=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the dock's regeneration in the 1980s a policy had been adopted to try to attract retailers into the newly created premises within. However, after many years of struggling to compete with other major shopping areas in the city, the Albert Dock Company Ltd announced in 2007 a shift into attracting more bars and restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gleeson |first=Bill |title= Albert Dock primed for ‘colossal tourism’|publisher=[[Liverpool Daily Post]] |date=6 August 2007 |url=http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/business/business-local/2007/08/06/albert-dock-primed-for-colossal-tourism-64375-19575999/ |accessdate=24 September 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107095559/http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/business/business-local/2007/08/06/albert-dock-primed-for-colossal-tourism-64375-19575999/|archivedate=7 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2008, bars and restaurants resident in the Albert Dock include Panam Bar &amp; Restaurant, Revolution Bar, Spice Lounge, and Whats Cooking?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Albert Dock: Food and Drink |publisher=Albert Dock Company Ltd |url=http://www.albertdock.com/pages/index.php?page_id=51 |access-date=24 September 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081014173819/http://www.albertdock.com/pages/index.php?page_id=51| archivedate= 14 October 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kongo people|Kongo]] place stone figures called '''tumba''' (a [[Kongo language|Ki-Kongo]] word, pl. bitumba) on the graves of powerful people. Bitumba were created in [[Zaire]] and [[Angola]] during the nineteenth century and the first part of the twentieth. The term tumba comes from the old [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] word for “tomb”— this genre may have been inspired by grave monuments for European merchants and missionaries in [[Kongo Kingdom|Kongo]] cemeteries.

==Materials and Dimensions==
Bituma were executed in soft stone. Their average height it close to 50 centimeters; the smallest bituma measure between 15 and 20 centimeters and the largest are approximately a meter in height.&lt;ref name="Thompson 1981"&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Robert Farris|title=The four moments of the sun : Kongo art in two worlds|year=1981|publisher=National Gallery of Art|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=089468003X|author2=Cornet, Joseph }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historiography==
Artist Robert Verly gathered a large number of statues in the north of Angola near the Zaire border and, in the May 1955 issue of Zaire, he classified the objects by type and proposed an explanation for their use.&lt;ref name="Verly 1955"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Verly|first=Robert|title=La Statuaire de pierre du Bas-Congo (Bamboma-Musurongo)|journal=Zaire|year=1955|volume=5|location=Brussels}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1978, the Institut des Musees Nationaux du [[Zaire]] at the Center for International Commerce of Zaire in [[Kinshasa]] mounted an exhibition of 72 bitumba called "Sculptures Stones from Lower Zaire."&lt;ref name="Cornet 1978"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cornet|first=Joseph|title=Pierres sculptees du Bas-Zaire|year=1978|location=Kinshasa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Styles and Themes==
Bitumba sculptures are unique in their variety of styles. Robert Farris Thompson has identified about twenty workshops that explain stylistic individuality. The wide dispersal of the works, however, has made it impossible to localize their centers of production. 

Bitumba are express a variety of themes. The most widely found - about twenty percent of statues belong to this type - is a figure who raises his hands in front of his face in a gesture often interpreted as praying. The second most prevalent theme is that of mother and child. The art of Lower Zaire, and especially the art of [[Mayombe]], is known for privileging [[maternity]] subjects. The third theme is that of the "thinker," who holds on hand on the hip and the other pressed to check in an attitude of meditation.&lt;ref name="Thompson 1981" /&gt;

'''''Vasya''''' is a 2002 American [[documentary film]] written, directed and produced by [[Andrei Zagdansky]]. The film tells the story of [[Russians|Russian]] [[underground art|underground]] [[artist]] [[Vasily Sitnikov]], who was declared insane in early 1940s by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] authorities. A man without a passport, in and out of [[mental asylums]], he was the key and often "larger than life" figure of the nonconformist art movement in the Soviet Union.
In 1975 fearing prosecution and another involuntary commitment to a mental asylum he immigrated to Austria and then to the United States. He died virtually unknown in 1987 in NYC. 

A number of prominent artists appear in the film, such as [[Dmitri Plavinsky]] Vladimir Titov, Kevin Clarke, poet and publisher [[Konstantyn K. Kuzminsky]] and art collector [[Norton Dodge]], who has amassed one of the largest collections of Soviet-era art outside the Soviet Union.
