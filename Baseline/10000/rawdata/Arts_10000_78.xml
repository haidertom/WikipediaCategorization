The '''American Renaissance''' period in American literature ran from about 1830 to around the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Boswell, Jeanetta. ''The American Renaissance and the Critics.'' Wakefield: Longwood Academic. {{ISBN|0-89341-599-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A central term in [[American studies]], the American Renaissance was for a while considered synonymous with [[Romanticism#United States|American Romanticism]]&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Denise D. [https://books.google.com/books?id=z37rhqwq9mkC&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=%22American+Renaissance%22+%22romanticism%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=8qnZTI_kCoTHswaAt5XnBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22American%20Renaissance%22%20%22romanticism%22&amp;f=false ''Writers of the American Renaissance: An A-to-Z Guide''].

==Overview==
Scholar [[F. O. Matthiessen]] originated the phrase "American Renaissance" in his 1941 book ''American Renaissance: Art and Expression in the Age of Emerson and Whitman''. The thematic center of the American Renaissance was what Matthiessen called the "devotion" of all five of his writers to "the possibilities of democracy". He presented the American Renaissance texts as "literature for our democracy” and challenged the nation to repossess them.&lt;ref&gt;Lauter, Paul. [https://books.google.com/books?id=HGSf-VpoGIsC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=American+renaissance+%22possibilities+of+democracy%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_3P5TPrRLciSswa24LC-Aw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=American%20renaissance%20%22possibilities%20of%20democracy%22&amp;f=false ''A Companion to American Literature and Culture'']. Chichester; Malden, MA: Wiley-Blackwell, 2010: 68 {{ISBN|0-631-20892-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often considered a movement centered in New England, the American Renaissance was inspired in part by a new focus on [[humanism]] as a way to move from [[Calvinism]].&lt;ref&gt;Howe, Daniel Walker. ''What Hath God Wrought? The Transformation of America, 1815–1848''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2007: 615. {{ISBN|978-0-19-507894-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Literary nationalists at this time were calling for a movement that would develop a unique American literary style to distinguish American literature from British literature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Walter Channing in a November 1815 issue of the ''[[North American Review]]'' called for the people to form "a literature of our own", which was later echoed by other literary critics.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Following this call, there was a wave of literary nationalism in America for much of the 1820s that saw writers such as [[Washington Irving]], [[William Cullen Bryant]], and [[James Fenimore Cooper]] become the identity of writers worthy of American literature.  From this wave of literary nationalism the American Renaissance can be seen as being born.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Criticisms ==
There are many criticisms associated with the American Renaissance, and some critics question if it ever actually took place. One of the most prominent criticisms is that authors during this period are seen as simply taking styles and ideas from past movements and culture and reforming them into new, contemporary works.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Beneath the American Renaissance|last = Reynolds|first = David|publisher = Alfred A. Knopf, Inc.|year = 1988|isbn = 9780394544489|location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics say that authors fail to address major political issues during this period, such as slavery, even as they had large influence on the writing of the time.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  There is also criticism that women authors and women's issues were generally left out of discussion and publication.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The notion of an American Renaissance has been criticized for overemphasizing a small number of white male writers and artifacts of high culture.&lt;ref&gt;Buell, Lawrence. [https://books.google.com/books?id=nPgRcKfZebwC&amp;pg=PA145&amp;dq=%22american+renaissance%22+%22white+male+writers%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=y_TWTOLSGpHDswa3y9iDCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22american%20renaissance%22%20%22white%20male%20writers%22&amp;f=false ''Emerson'']. Cambridge and London: Harvard University Press, 2003: 145.&lt;/ref&gt; William E. Cain noted the "extreme white male formation" of Matthiessen's list of authors and stated that by "devoting hundreds of pages of analysis and celebration to five white male authors, Matthiessen unwittingly prefigured in his book what later readers would dispute and labor to correct."&lt;ref&gt;Cain, William E. [https://books.google.com/books?id=G1TowJSnxrgC&amp;pg=PA168&amp;dq=%22american+renaissance%22+%22male+authors%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=XffWTOTkGY7Eswah18SICA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22american%20renaissance%22%20%22male%20authors%22&amp;f=false ''F.O. Matthiessen and the Politics of Criticism'']. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1988: 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics argue that literature written by women during this period was not as popular as first thought, and that it took a distant second place in popularity to works written by men.  Matthiessen and other scholars are even known to exclude women and minority authors, especially African Americans.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Norton Anthology of American Literature|last = Baym|publisher = W.W. Norton &amp; Company|year = |isbn = 0393918858|location = New York|pages = 445–463|chapter = American Literature 1820-1865|last2 = Levine}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Critics also argue that there is no separate style or genre, such as sentimental-domestic fiction, distinguished by gender.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  However, other critics point out that the most read authors of the time were women, such as [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] and [[Fanny Fern]] &lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://dcc.newberry.org/collections/the-american-renaissance-in-context|title = The American Renaissance in Context|date = 2014|access-date = November 10, 2015|website = |publisher = |last = Howe|first = Lawrence|last2 = Layson|first2 = Hana}}&lt;/ref&gt; and criticize Matthiessen for not including women in the original canon.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The demographic exclusivity of the American Renaissance began eroding among scholars toward the end of the twentieth century. They have included [[Emily Dickinson]] in the canon; she started writing poetry in the late 1850s. [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]’s ''[[Uncle Tom’s Cabin]]'' (1852) rose to a prominent reputation in the late 1970s. African-American literature, including [[slave narratives]] by such masters as [[Frederick Douglass]], and early novels by [[William Wells Brown]], has gained increasing recognition.&lt;ref&gt;Jarrett, Gene Andrew. [https://books.google.com/books?id=jii8XeIKtA0C&amp;pg=PA103&amp;dq=%22american+renaissance%22+%22white+male+authors%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=MPbWTPrINM7ysgbPs7DVCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22american%20renaissance%22%20%22white%20male%20authors%22&amp;f=false ''A Companion to African American Literature'']. Chichester, U.K.; Malden, MA: Wiley-Blackwell, 2010: 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable authors==
Most often associated with the American Renaissance movement are 
[[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]'s ''[[Representative Men]]'' and ''[[Self-Reliance]]'', 
[[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]'' and ''[[The House of Seven Gables]]'',
[[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby-Dick]]'',
[[Henry David Thoreau]]'s ''[[Walden]]'', and
[[Walt Whitman]]'s'' [[Leaves of Grass]]''.  Most of the main writers associated with the American Renaissance were actually rather unknown during this time and had small followings.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Other authors were later added to this list and found to have contributed to this movement.  These include:
[[Edgar Allan Poe]],
[[Harriet Beecher Stowe]],
[[Emily Dickinson]],
[[Frederick Douglass]],
[[William Wells Brown]],
[[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], and
[[John Greenleaf Whittier]] among others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Articella''' is a collection of medical treatises bound together in one volume that was used mainly as a textbook and reference manual between the 13th and the 16th centuries. In [[Middle Ages|medieval times]], several versions of this anthology circulated in manuscript form among medical students. Between 1476 and 1534, [[printing|printed]] editions of the Articella were also published in several [[Europe]]an cities.

The collection grew around a synthetic exposition of [[ancient Greek medicine|classical Greek medicine]] written in [[Baghdad]] by the [[physician]] and [[polyglot (person)|polyglot]] [[Hunayn bin Ishaq]], better known in the West as Ioannitius. His synthesis was in turn based on [[Galen]]'s ''Ars Medica'' (''Techne iatrike'') and thus became known in Europe as ''Isagoge Ioannitii ad Tegni Galieni'' (''Hunayn's Introduction to the Art of Galen'').

In the mid-13th century, the emergence of formal medical education in several European universities fueled a demand for comprehensive textbooks. Instructors from the influential [[Scuola Medica Salernitana]] popularized the practice of binding other treatises together with their manuscript copies of the Isagoge. These included [[Hippocrates]]’ Prognostics as well as his Aphorisms, [[Theophilus Protospatharius]]'s De Urinis and De Pulsibus and many other classic works.

Artists Alliance was established in 1991&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://artistsalliance.org.nz/about/|website=Artists Alliance}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an offshoot of the New Zealand Sculptors Society. The non-profit’s goal is to advance the interests of New Zealand’s [[visual arts]] community as well as to offer individual support to artists within that community.

==Programmes==

===Internships===
Artists Alliance has placed interns within several organisations throughout Auckland such as: Artists Alliance itself, Creative Coalition, [[Artspace]], [[Auckland Arts Festival]], and the [[Gus Fisher Gallery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to support emerging artists: a practical guide|url=https://do6qmrbufqcd2.cloudfront.net/1001/117-how-to-support-emerging-artists-a-practical-guide.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mentoring===

The '''Australian Horror Writers Association (AHWA)''' is a [[non-profit organisation]] that commenced in 2003 with the goal of providing a unified voice and sense of [[community]] for [[Australian]] writers of dark fiction ([[Horror fiction|horror]] and [[dark fantasy]]) and to further the development of dark fiction in [[Australia]].

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2011}}
The AHWA built to some extent on the work of previous horror writers' associations in Australia such as the Sydney-based Gargoyle Club (1987–92)(see [[Leigh Blackmore]]) and the Melbourne-based Australian Horror Writers (1994-1998) (see [[Bryce J. Stevens]]), which grew out of [[Bloodsongs]] magazine (its president being [[Bryce J. Stevens]], and its newsletter/journal ''Severed Head'' having been edited first by Stevens, then Aaron Sterns). However, the AHWA was a far more ambitious effort, conceived by its founding committee as drawing together horror writers and fans nationwide in Australia.

The AHWA was officially launched during the Continuum 3 [[science fiction convention]] in [[Melbourne]] on 17 July 2005 by [[author]] [[Richard Harland]]. [http://www.australianhorror.com/index.php?view=6]

The founding committee members were Dr Marty Young (President), [[Kirstyn McDermott]] (Vice President), Mick Piemontese (Secretary), Carl Schaller (Treasurer), James R Cain and [[Angela Challis]]. [http://www.australianhorror.com/index.php?view=6]

In 2005, the AHWA established the [[Australian Shadows Award]] as an annual [[literary award]] to honour the best published work of [[horror fiction]] written or edited by an Australian. The award was sponsored by Altair Australia Books in its first two years, through the donation of two statuettes created by dark fantasy artist Brom (supplied by The Franklin Mint).

Other projects established by the AHWA include the Southern Horror [[Yahoo! Groups|Yahoo! Group]] mailing list for members, an annual [[flash fiction]] and [[short story]] competition (winning entries are published in ''Midnight Echo'' magazine), online chatrooms and forums, a Market Hive (markets database for current horror fiction markets), an annual [[mentorship]] programme, and ongoing story critiquing groups.

Renowned Australian horror &amp; ghost story anthologist James Doig has provided the AHWA website with a historical checklist of important Australian horror and fantasy works. [http://www.australianhorror.com/index.php?view=141]

The AHWA also maintains links with the [[British Fantasy Society]] and [[Horror Writers of America]].

The AHWA news service was amalgamated with [[Brimstone Press]]'s [[news]] and [[review]] [[webzine]] [[HorrorScope (webzine)|HorrorScope]] between March 2007 and Sept 2010. With AHWA news editor Talie Helene joining the HorrorScope editorial team, the combined serviced provided a single, streamlined source for Australian horror publishing news until early 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ozhorrorscope.blogspot.com/2007/03/news-ahwa-newshorrorscope-collaboration.html Cummings, Shane Jiraiya (March 2007). "AHWA/HorrorScope collaboration". ''HorrorScope''.] Retrieved 9-9-2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Midnight Echo'' magazine==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2011}}
AHWA produces a regular print publication ''Midnight Echo'' (Oct 2008 - ). It is designed to showcase the best in Australian horror writing, though it also publishes work by non-Australian writers. The magazine began as a PDF publication with limited hardcopies being printed outside Australia. As from Issue 5, the hardcopy magazine is printed in Australia by [[Black House Comics]].

The Executive Editor of ''Midnight Echo'' Issues 1-5 was Australian author Scott Wilson. [[Leigh Blackmore]] became Acting Executive Editor with Issue 5. Previous President Dr Marty Young returned to the AHWA as Executive Editor for ''Midnight Echo'' in Sept 2011 in time for the release of Issue 6. Marty Young launched the new Midnight Echo website in Oct 2011.

Each issue is edited by a different editor or editorial team drawn from AHWA's membership. The Art Director for Issues 1-3 was David Schembri. On Issue 5 the Art team consisted of Juliet Bathory and David Schembri. Issue 5 was the first issue printed entirely in Australia.

Colour cover artwork has featured on all issues from Issue 1 onwards. Issues 1 and 2 contained no poetry or colour internal artwork. Poetry was featured prominently alongside fiction in Issue 3, which was also the first issue to include a graphic novel (in black and white).

Individual issues of ''Midnight Echo'' have been edited by
* Kirstyn McDermott and Ian Mond (Issue 1, Oct 2008))
* [[Angela Challis]] and [[Shane Jiraiya Cummings]] (Issue 2 (June 2009))
* Stephen Studach (see [[The Australian Horror and Fantasy Magazine]]) (Issue 3 (Nov 2009))
* [[Lee Battersby]] (Issue 4 (July 2010)
* [[Leigh Blackmore]] (Issue 5, Feb 2011).
* [[David Conyers]], [[Jason Fischer (writer)|Jason Fischer]] and David Kernot (Issue 6, Nov 2011)
* Daniel I Russell (Issue 7, May 2012)
* Marty Young, Mark Farrugia, and Amanda J Spedding (Issue 8, November 2012)
* GN Braun AKA Geoff Brown (Issue 9, May 2013)

==AHWA officeholders==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2011}}
In Sept 2010 all committee positions of the AHWA were declared vacant and new officeholders were elected. [[Leigh Blackmore]] replaced Dr Marty Young as the organisation's second President and served in that role for the year 2010-2011.  [[Horrorscope (webzine)|Horrorscope]] also ceased to be amalgamated with the AHWA.

At the Oct 2011 AGM of the Association, writer Geoff Brown was elected as the AHWA's third President.

At the November 2016 AGM,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.Australianhorror.com|title=Australian Horror Writers Association :: Home|last=www.kephra.com.au|first=Kephra Design -|website=www.australianhorror.com|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Committee thanked Mark Smith-Briggs and Cameron Oliver for their outstanding contribution to the Committee over a number of years, and most recently as President and Treasurer, and to Porle Joen, outgoing Sinister Reads manager.

'''Baroque painting''' is the [[painting]] associated with the [[Baroque]] [[cultural movement]]. The movement is often identified with [[political absolutism|Absolutism]], the [[Counter Reformation]] and Catholic Revival,&lt;ref name=ebo&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9026564/Counter-Reformation Counter Reformation], from ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]'', latest edition, full-article.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/65/co/CounterR.html Counter Reformation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211173809/http://www.bartleby.com/65/co/CounterR.html |date=2008-12-11 }}, from ''[[The Columbia Encyclopedia]]'', Sixth Edition.  2001–05.&lt;/ref&gt; but the existence of important Baroque art and [[Baroque architecture|architecture]] in non-absolutist and [[Protestant]] states throughout Western Europe underscores its widespread popularity.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Gardner, Fred S. Kleiner, and Christin J. Mamiya, "Gardner's Art Through the Ages" (Belmont, California: [[Thomson/Wadsworth]], 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Baroque painting encompasses a great range of styles, as most important and major painting during the period beginning around 1600 and continuing throughout the 17th century, and into the early 18th century is identified today as [[Baroque]] painting. In its most typical manifestations, Baroque art is characterized by great drama, rich, deep colour, and intense light and dark shadows, but the [[classicism]] of French Baroque painters like [[Poussin]] and Dutch [[genre painters]] such as [[Vermeer]] are also covered by the term, at least in English.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in French calling Poussin Baroque would be generally rejected&lt;/ref&gt; As opposed to [[Renaissance art]], which usually showed the moment before an event took place, Baroque artists chose the most dramatic point, the moment when the action was occurring: [[Michelangelo]], working in the [[High Renaissance]], shows his [[David (Michelangelo)|David]] composed and still before he battles [[Goliath]]; [[Bernini]]'s Baroque [[David (Bernini)|David]] is caught in the act of hurling the stone at the giant. Baroque art was meant to evoke emotion and passion instead of the calm rationality that had been prized during the Renaissance.

Among the greatest painters of the [[Baroque]] period are [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]], [[Caravaggio]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/vow/ULANFullDisplay?find=Caravaggio&amp;role=&amp;nation=&amp;prev_page=1&amp;subjectid=500115312 |title=Getty profile, including variant spellings of the artist's name |publisher=Getty.edu |date=2002-12-11 |accessdate=2012-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn|Rembrandt]],&lt;ref name="Gombrich, p. 420"&gt;Gombrich, p. 420.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]],&lt;ref&gt;Belkin (1998): 11–18.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicolas Poussin|Poussin]],&lt;ref&gt;His ''Lives of the Painters'' was published in Rome, 1672.  Poussin's other contemporary biographer was [[André Félibien]].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vermeer]].&lt;ref&gt;W. Liedtke (2007) Dutch Paintings in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, p. 867.&lt;/ref&gt; Caravaggio is an heir of the [[Humanism|humanist]] painting of the [[High Renaissance]]. His [[realism (visual arts)|realistic]] approach to the human figure, painted directly from life and dramatically spotlit against a dark background, shocked his contemporaries and opened a new chapter in the history of painting.  Baroque painting often dramatizes scenes using [[chiaroscuro]] light effects; this can be seen in works by Rembrandt, Vermeer, [[Le Nain]] and [[Georges de La Tour|La Tour]].
The Flemish painter [[Anthony van Dyck]] developed a graceful but imposing portrait style that was very influential, especially in England.

The prosperity of 17th century Holland led to an enormous production of art by large numbers of painters who were mostly highly specialized and painted only [[genre painting|genre scenes]], [[Landscape art|landscapes]], [[Still-life]]s, [[portrait]]s or [[History painting]]s.  Technical standards were very high, and [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] established a new repertoire of subjects that was very influential until the arrival of [[Modernism]].

== History ==
[[File:JosefaObidos1.jpg|thumb|[[Nativity of Jesus|''Nativity'']] by [[Josefa de Óbidos]], 1669, [[National Museum of Ancient Art]], [[Lisbon]]]]
The [[Council of Trent]] (1545–63), in which the [[Roman Catholic Church]] answered many questions of internal reform raised by both [[Protestantism|Protestants]] and by those who had remained inside the Catholic Church, [[Art in Roman Catholicism#Council of Trent|addressed the representational arts]] in a short and somewhat oblique passage in its decrees.  This was subsequently interpreted and expounded by a number of clerical authors like [[Molanus]], who demanded that [[painting]]s and [[sculpture]]s in church contexts should depict their subjects clearly and powerfully, and with decorum, without the stylistic airs of [[Mannerism]].
This return toward a [[Populism|populist]] conception of the function of ecclesiastical art is seen by many [[Art history|art historians]] as driving the innovations of [[Michelangelo Merisi|Caravaggio]] and the [[The Carracci|Carracci]] brothers, all of whom were working (and competing for commissions) in Rome around 1600, although unlike the Carracci, Caravaggio persistently was criticised for lack of decorum in his work.
However, although [[sacred art|religious painting]], [[history painting]], [[allegories]], and [[portraits]] were still considered the most noble subjects, [[Landscape art|landscape]], [[still life]], and genre scenes were also becoming more common in Catholic countries, and were the main genres in Protestant ones.

===The term===
The term "Baroque" was initially used with a derogatory meaning, to underline the excesses of its emphasis. Others derive it from the mnemonic term "Baroco" denoting, in logical ''Scholastica'', a supposedly laboured form of [[syllogism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Panofsky | first=Erwin | title=What is Baroque? |  journal=Three Essays on Style| publisher=The MIT Press | year=1995 | pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In particular, the term was used to describe its eccentric redundancy and noisy abundance of details, which sharply contrasted the clear and sober rationality of the Renaissance.  It was first rehabilitated by the [[Switzerland|Swiss-born]] [[Art History|art historian]], [[Heinrich Wölfflin]] (1864–1945) in his ''Renaissance und Barock'' (1888); Wölfflin identified the Baroque as "movement imported into mass", an art antithetic to [[Renaissance]] art. He did not make the distinctions between [[Mannerism]] and Baroque that modern writers do, and he ignored the later phase, the academic Baroque that lasted into the 18th century. Writers in French and English did not begin to treat Baroque as a respectable study until Wölfflin's influence had made German scholarship pre-eminent.

==National variations==
Led by Italy, Mediterranean countries, slowly followed by most of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in Germany and [[Central Europe]], generally adopted a full-blooded Baroque approach. 

A rather different art developed out of northern realist traditions in 17th century [[Dutch Golden Age painting]], which had very little religious art, and little [[history painting]], instead playing a crucial part in developing secular genres such as [[still life]], [[genre painting]]s of everyday scenes, and [[landscape painting]].  While the Baroque nature of Rembrandt's art is clear, the label is less use for [[Vermeer]] and many other Dutch artists.  Most Dutch art lacks the idealization and love of splendour typical of much Baroque work, including the neighbouring [[Flemish Baroque painting]] which shared a part in Dutch trends, while also continuing to produce the traditional categories in a more clearly Baroque style.

In France a dignified and graceful classicism gave a distinctive flavour to Baroque painting, where the later 17th century is also regarded as a golden age for painting.  Two of the most important artists, [[Nicolas Poussin]] and [[Claude Lorrain]], remained based in Rome, where their work, almost all in [[easel painting]]s, was much appreciated by Italian as well as French patrons.

'''Bayati''' ({{lang-az|Bayatı}}) is one of the oldest forms of [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijani]] folk poetry. A bayati consists of four lines, each of which has  seven syllables.  The rhyme scheme is aaba. Anonymous bayati have been collected as folk wisdom in editions such as ''Xalqimizin deyimlari va duyumlari'' (Our people's sayings and feelings). Bayati can also be strung together in sequence to form longer poems, and there are several bayati dastan, epics, in which all of the verses are bayati; one example is ''Arzu-Qamber''.&lt;ref name="Oldfield"/&gt;

Some folklorists associate the bayati with women's folk creativity, but male [[ashig]]s compose bayati as well. Intriguingly, some scholars argue that the bayati dastan are from a lost repertoire of women's dastan, but so far there is no firm evidence to support this theory. In the [[Zaqatala Rayon|Zagatala]] region of northern [[Azerbaijan]], male and female ashiqs who play the [[tanbur]] sing poetry composed only in the bayati meter.&lt;ref name="Oldfield"&gt;Anna C.

[[File:Bob Dylan - Great White Wonder.png|thumb|250px|The first popular [[rock music|rock]] bootleg, [[Bob Dylan]]'s ''[[Great White Wonder]]'', released in July 1969]]
A ''' bootleg recording''' is an [[sound recording|audio]] or [[video]] recording of a performance that was not officially released by the artist or under other legal authority. The process of making and distributing such recordings is known as '''bootlegging'''. Recordings may be copied and traded among fans of the artist without financial exchange, but some bootleggers have sold recordings for profit, sometimes by adding professional-quality sound engineering and packaging to the raw material. Bootlegs usually consist of either unreleased studio recordings, live performances or interviews with an unpredictable level of quality.

The concept of releasing unauthorised performances had been established before the 20th century, but reached new levels of popularity with [[Bob Dylan]]'s ''[[Great White Wonder]]'', a compilation of studio outtakes and demos released in 1969 using low-priority pressing plants. The following year, the [[Rolling Stones]]' ''[[Live'r Than You'll Ever Be]]'', an audience recording of a late 1969 show, received a positive review in ''[[Rolling Stone]]''. Subsequent bootlegs became more sophisticated in packaging, particularly the [[Trademark of Quality]] label with [[William Stout]]'s cover artwork. [[Compact disc]] bootlegs first appeared in the 1980s, and [[internet]] distribution became increasingly popular in the 1990s.

Changing technologies have affected the recording, distribution, and varying profitability of the underground industry. The [[copyright]]s for the song and the right to authorise recordings often reside with the artist, according to several international [[copyright treaty table|copyright treaties]]. The recording, trading and sale of bootlegs continues to thrive, however, even as artists and record companies attempt to provide officially released alternatives to satisfy the demand.

==Definitions==
The word "bootleg" originates from the practice of smuggling illicit items in the legs of tall boots, particularly the smuggling of alcohol during the [[Prohibition in the United States|American Prohibition]] era. The word, over time, has come to refer to any illegal or illicit product. This term has become an umbrella term for illicit, unofficial, or unlicensed recordings, including vinyl LPs, silver CDs, or any other commercially sold media or material.{{sfn|Heylin|1994|p=6}} The alternate term ROIO (an [[acronym]] meaning "Recording of Indeterminate / Independent Origin) or VOI (Video....) arose among [[Pink Floyd]] collectors, to clarify the recording source and copyright status was hard to determine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Netmusic: your complete guide to rock and more on the Internet and online services|first=Ben|last=Greenman|publisher=Random House|year=1995|page=159|isbn=978-0-679-76385-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although unofficial and unlicensed recordings had existed before the 1960s, the very first rock bootlegs came in plain sleeves with the title [[rubber stamp]]ed on it.{{sfn|Heylin|1994|p=45}} However, they quickly developed into more sophisticated packaging, in order to distinguish the manufacturer from inferior competitors.{{sfn|Heylin|1994|p=92}} With today's packaging and desktop publishing technology, even the layman can create "official" looking CDs. With the advent of the [[Compact Cassette|cassette]] and [[CD-R]], however, some bootlegs are traded privately with no attempt to be manufactured professionally. This is even more evident with the ability to share bootlegs via the [[Internet]].{{sfn|Heylin|2010|p=483}}

Bootlegs should not be confused with ''counterfeit'' or ''unlicensed'' recordings, which are merely unauthorised duplicates of officially released recordings, often attempting to resemble the official product as close as possible. Some record companies have considered that ''any'' record issued outside of their control, and for which they do not receive payment, to be a counterfeit, which includes bootlegs. However, some bootleggers are keen to stress that the markets for bootleg and counterfeit recordings are different, and a typical consumer for a bootleg will have bought most or all of that artist's official releases anyway.{{sfn|Heylin|1994|p=7}}

[[File:Who's Zoo.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Who's Zoo'' compiled early singles and B-sides by [[The Who]], which had not been commercially released in the U.S. Like several [[Trademark of Quality]] bootlegs, it featured cover artwork by [[William Stout]].]]
The most common type is the live bootleg, or audience recording, which is created with [[sound recording]] equipment smuggled into a [[concert|live concert]]. Many artists and live venues prohibit this form of recording, but from the 1970s onwards the increased availability of portable technology made such bootlegging easier, and the general quality of these recordings has improved over time as consumer equipment becomes sophisticated. A number of bootlegs originated with [[FM broadcasting|FM radio]] broadcasts of live or previously recorded live performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Collectible '70s: A Price Guide to the Polyester Decade|publisher=Krause Publications|page=44|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4402-2748-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other bootlegs may be [[soundboard recording]]s taken directly from a multi-track [[mixing console]] used to feed the [[public address system]] at a live performance. Artists may record their own shows for private review, but engineers may surreptitiously take a copy of this,{{efn|A bootleg of [[Bruce Springsteen]] was distributed after the band's sound engineer left a cassette in his car while it was being repaired. A bootlegger copied the cassette during the work, then returned it without arousing suspicion.{{sfn|Heylin|2010|p=278}}}} which ends up being shared. As a soundboard recording is intended to supplement the natural acoustics of a gig, a bootleg may have an inappropriate mix of instruments, unless the gig is so large that everything needs to be amplified and sent to the desk.{{sfn|Heylin|2010|p=256}}

Some bootlegs consist of private or professional studio recordings distributed without the artist's involvement, including [[demo (music)|demos]], works-in-progress or discarded material. These might be made from private recordings not meant to be widely shared, or from master recordings stolen or copied from an artist's home, a [[recording studio]] or the offices of a [[record label]], or they may be copied from promotional material issued to music publishers or radio stations, but not for commercial release.{{sfn|Heylin|1994|p=44}} A theme of early rock bootlegs was to copy [[Deletion (music industry)|deleted records]], such as old singles and B-sides, onto a single LP, as a cheaper alternative to obtaining all the original recordings. Strictly speaking, these were unlicensed recordings, but because the work required to clear all the copyrights and publishing of every track for an official release was considered to be prohibitively expensive, the bootlegs became popular. Some bootlegs, however, did lead to official releases. The ''Who's Zoo'' bootleg, collecting early singles of The Who, inspired the official album ''[[Odds And Sods]]'', which beat the bootleggers by issuing unreleased material, while various compilations of mid-1960s bands inspired the ''[[Nuggets (series)|Nuggets]]'' series of albums.{{sfn|Heylin|1994|p=196}}

==History==

===Pre-1960s===
According to enthusiast and author [[Clinton Heylin]], the concept of a bootleg record can be traced back to the days of [[William Shakespeare]], where unofficial transcripts of his plays would be published.{{sfn|Heylin|1994|p=17}} At that time, society was not particularly interested in who a particular author was, but the "cult of authorship" became established in the 19th century, resulting the first [[Berne Convention]] in 1886 to cover copyright. The US did not agree to the original terms, resulting in many "piratical reprints" of sheet music being published there by the end of the century.{{sfn|Heylin|1994|pp=20–21}}

During the early 20th century,  [[film soundtrack]]s were often bootlegged; if the officially released soundtrack had been re-recorded with a house orchestra, there would be demand for the original audio recording taken directly from the film. One example was a bootleg of [[Judy Garland]] performing ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (film)|Annie Get Your Gun]]'', before [[Betty Hutton]] replaced her early in production, but after a full soundtrack had been recorded.{{sfn|Heylin|1994|p=37}} The [[Recording Industry Association of America]] took a dim view of unauthorised releases and attempted several raids on production.{{sfn|Heylin|1994|p=31}} The Wagern-Nichols Home Recordist Guild recorded numerous performances at the [[Metropolitan Opera House (39th St)|Metropolitan Opera House]], and openly sold them without paying royalties to the writers and performers. The company was sued by the [[American Broadcasting Company]] and [[Columbia Records]] (who held the official rights to the recordings), who managed to obtain a court injunction against producing the record.{{sfn|Heylin|1994|p=32}}

===1960s===
[[File:Kum Back.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Kum Back]]'', a collection of recordings by [[The Beatles]] in early 1969, appeared before the official release of ''[[Let It Be]]''.]]

The first popular rock music bootleg resulted from Bob Dylan's activities between largely disappearing from the public eye after his motorcycle accident in 1966, and the release of ''[[John Wesley Harding (album)|John Wesley Harding]]'' at the end of 1967. After a number of artists had hits with Dylan songs that he had not officially recorded and released himself, demand increased for these recordings, particularly when they started airing on local radio in [[Los Angeles]]. Through various contacts in the radio industry, a number of pioneering bootleggers managed to buy a [[reel to reel tape]] containing a selection of unreleased Dylan songs intended for distribution for music publishers and wondered if it would be possible to manufacture them on an LP. They managed to convince a local pressing plant to press between 1,000 and 2,000 copies discreetly, paying in cash and avoiding using real names or addresses. Since the bootleggers could not commercially print a sleeve, due to it attracting too much attention from recording companies, the LP was issued in a plain white cover with ''Great White Wonder'' rubber stamped on it.{{sfn|Heylin|1994|p=45}} Subsequently, Dylan became one of the most popular artists to be bootlegged with [[Bob Dylan bootleg recordings|numerous releases]].{{sfn|Heylin|1994|p=394}}

[[File:The Rolling Stones - Live'r Than You'll Ever Be original.jpg|thumb|[[The Rolling Stones]]' ''[[Live'r Than You'll Ever Be]]'', released in late 1969, received a rave review in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'']]
When The Rolling Stones announced their [[The Rolling Stones American Tour 1969|1969 American tour]], their first in the U.S. for several years, an enterprising bootlegger known as "Dub" decided to record some of the shows. He purchased a [[Sennheiser]] 805 [["shotgun" microphone]] and a [[Uher (brand)|Uher]] 4000 reel to reel [[tape recorder]] specifically for recording the performances, smuggling them into the venues.{{sfn|Heylin|1994|p=60}} The resulting bootleg, ''Live'r Than You'll Ever Be'', was released shortly before Christmas 1969, mere weeks after the tour had finished, and in January 1970 received a rave review in ''Rolling Stone'', who described the sound quality as "superb, full of presence, picking up drums, bass, both guitars and the vocals beautifully&amp;nbsp;... it is the ultimate Rolling Stones album".{{sfn|Heylin|1994|p=61}} The bootleg sold several tens of thousands of copies, orders of magnitude more than a typical classical or opera bootleg,{{sfn|Heylin|1994|p=65}} and its success resulted in the official release of the live album ''[[Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out! The Rolling Stones in Concert|Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out!]]'' later in the year. "Dub" was one of the founders of the [[Trade Mark of Quality]] (TMOQ or TMQ) bootleg record label.{{sfn|Heylin|1994|p=66}}

===1970s===
During the 1970s the bootleg industry in the United States expanded rapidly, coinciding with the era of stadium rock or [[arena rock]]. Vast numbers of recordings were issued for profit by bootleg labels such as [[Kornyfone]] and TMQ.{{sfn|Cummings|2013|p=102}}  The large followings of rock artists created a lucrative market for the mass production of unofficial recordings on [[gramophone record|vinyl]], as it became evident that more and more fans were willing to purchase them.{{sfn|Cummings|2013|p=117}} In addition, the huge crowds which turned up to these concerts made the effective policing of the audience for the presence of covert recording equipment difficult. [[Led Zeppelin]] quickly became a popular target for bootleggers on the strength and frequency of their live concerts; ''[[Live on Blueberry Hill]]'', recorded at the [[LA Forum]] in 1970, was sufficiently successful to incur the wrath of manager [[Peter Grant (music manager)|Peter Grant]].{{sfn|Heylin|1994|pp=69–70}} [[Bruce Springsteen]] and the [[E Street Band]] recorded numerous concerts for radio broadcast in the 1970s, which resulted in many Springsteen bootlegs.{{sfn|Heylin|1994|pp=116–117}}

[[File:Dark side of the moo.jpg|thumb|left|270px|The [[Pink Floyd]] bootleg ''[[The Dark Side of the Moo]]'' collected early singles and B-sides. When released, it was the only way to hear the studio version of "[[Astronomy Domine]]" in the U.S, as it was not included on the U.S. issue of ''[[The Piper at the Gates of Dawn]]'']]
Some bootleggers noticed rock fans that had grown up with the music in the 1960s wanted rare or unreleased recordings of bands that had split up and looked unlikely to reform. For instance, the release of ''[[Golden Eggs]]'', a bootleg of outtakes by [[The Yardbirds]] had proven to be so popular that the bootlegger had managed to interview the band's [[Keith Relf]] for the sequel, ''[[More Golden Eggs]]''.{{sfn|Heylin|1994|p=98}} Archive live performances became popular; a 1970 release of Dylan's set with the Hawks (later to become [[The Band]]) at the [[Manchester Free Trade Hall]] in 1966 (incorrectly assumed to be the [[Royal Albert Hall]] for years) was critically and commercially successful owing to the good sound quality and the concert's historical importance.{{sfn|Heylin|1994|pp=73–74,76}}

In [[Los Angeles]] there were a number of record mastering and pressing plants that were not "first in line" to press records for the major labels, usually only getting work when the larger plants were overloaded. These pressing plants were more than happy to generate income by pressing bootlegs of dubious legality.{{sfn|Heylin|1994|p=63}} Sometimes they simply hid the bootleg work when record company executives would come around (in which case the printed label could show the artist and song names) and other times secrecy required labels with fictitious names. For example, a 1974 Pink Floyd bootleg called ''Brain Damage'' was released under the name The Screaming Abadabs, which was one of the band's early names.&lt;ref name="Backtrax"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://backtrax-records.co.uk/floydboots/pages/history.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070203141848/http://backtrax-records.co.uk/floydboots/pages/history.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=3 February 2007 |title=A Brief History Of Bootlegs |accessdate=23 September 2009 |last=Slugbelch |first= |year= |month= |work=The Pink Floyd Vinyl Bootleg Guide |publisher=Backtrax Records }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of their ability to get records and covers pressed unquestioned by these pressing plants, bootleggers were able to produce artwork and packaging that a commercial label would be unlikely to issue – perhaps most notoriously the 1962 recording of The Beatles at the Star Club in [[Hamburg]], which was bootlegged as ''[[The Beatles vs. the Third Reich]]'' (a parody on an early US album entitled ''[[The Beatles vs. the Four Seasons]]''), or ''[[Elvis' Greatest Shit]]'', a collection of the least successful of [[Elvis Presley]]'s recordings, mostly from film soundtracks.{{sfn|Heylin|1994|p=188}}

Bootleg collectors in this era generally relied on ''[[Hot Wacks]]'', an annual underground magazine listing known bootlegs and information about recent releases. It provided the true information on bootlegs with fictitious labels, and included details on artists and track listings, as well as the source and sound quality of the various recordings.{{sfn|Heylin|1994|p=130–131}}{{sfn|Shuker|2013|p=105}}

Initially, knowledge of bootlegs and where to purchase them spread by word of mouth.{{sfn|Cummings|2013|p=174}} The pioneering bootlegger Rubber Dubber sent copies of his bootleg recordings of live performances to magazines such as ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' in an attempt to get them reviewed. When Dylan's record company, [[Columbia Records]] objected, Rubber Dubber counteracted he was simply putting fans in touch with the music without the intermediary of a record company.{{sfn|Cummings|2013|p=103}} Throughout the 1970s most bootleg records were of poor quality, with many of the album covers consisting of nothing more than cheap [[photocopying|photocopies]]. The packaging became more sophisticated towards the end of the decade and continued into the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Galloway"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.moremusic.co.uk/links/features/bootleg.htm| title = Bootlegs, an insight into the shady side of music collecting| accessdate = 23 September 2006| last = Galloway| first = Simon| year = 1999| month =| work =| publisher = ''More Music'' e-zine}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Punk rock]] saw a brief entry into the bootleg market in the 1970s, particularly the bootleg ''[[Spunk (album)|Spunk]]'', a series of outtakes by [[The Sex Pistols]]. The album received a good review from [[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]' Chas de Whalley, who said it was "an album that no self-respecting rock fan would turn his nose up at."{{sfn|Heylin|1994|p=170}}

===1980s===
[[File:Prince Brussels 1986.jpg|thumb|The ''[[The Black Album (Prince album)|Black Album]]'' by [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] was withdrawn from sale shortly before its official release date in December 1987, becoming a popular bootleg.]]
The 1980s saw the increased use of audio cassettes and [[videotape]]s for the dissemination of bootleg recordings, as the affordability of private [[dubbing (transferring)|dubbing]] equipment made the production of multiple copies significantly easier.{{sfn|Cummings|2013|p=79}} Cassettes were also smaller, easier to ship, and could be sold or traded more affordably than vinyl. [[Cassette culture]] and [[tape trading]], propelled by the [[DIY ethic]] of the [[punk subculture]], relied on an [[honour system]] where people who received tapes from fellow traders made multiple copies to pass on to others within the community.{{sfn|Heylin|1994|pp=123–4}} For a while, stalls at major music gatherings such as the [[Glastonbury Festival]] sold mass copies of bootleg soundboard recordings of bands who, in many cases, had played only a matter of hours beforehand. However, officials soon began to counteract this illegal activity by making raids on the stalls and, by the end of the 1980s, the number of festival bootlegs had consequently dwindled.{{sfn|Heylin|2010|p=428}}&lt;ref name="Galloway" /&gt;

One of the most critically acclaimed bootlegs from the 1980s is ''[[The Black Album (Prince)|The Black Album]]'' by [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]. The album was to have been a conventional major-label release in late 1987, but on 1 December, immediately before release, Prince decided to pull the album, requiring 500,000 copies to be destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Icons of R&amp;B and Soul: Smokey Robinson and the Miracles ; The Temptations ; The Supremes ; Stevie Wonder|first=Bob|last=Gulla|p=494|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2008|isbn=978-0-313-34046-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few advance copies had already shipped, which were used to create bootlegs. This eventually led to the album's official release.{{sfn|Cummings|2013|p=163}} Towards the end of the 1980s, the ''[[Ultra Rare Trax]]'' series of bootlegs, featuring studio outtakes of the Beatles, showed that [[digital remastering]] onto [[compact disc]] could produce a high-quality product that was comparable with official studio releases.{{sfn|Heylin|1994|pp=282–3}}

===1990s–present===
Following the success of ''Ultra Rare Trax'', the 1990s saw an increased production of bootleg CDs, including reissues of shows that had been recorded decades previously. In particular, companies in [[Germany]] and [[Italy]] exploited the more relaxed [[copyright]] laws in those countries by pressing large numbers of CDs and including catalogs of other titles on the inlays, making it easier for fans to find and order shows direct.&lt;ref name="Galloway" /&gt;{{sfn|Heylin|2010|p=369}} Similarly, relaxed copyright laws in [[Australia]] meant that the most serious legal challenge to unauthorised releases were made on the grounds of [[trademark]] law by [[Sony Music Entertainment]] in 1993. Court findings were in favour of allowing the release of unauthorised recordings clearly marked as "unauthorised". The updated [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade|GATT 1994]] agreement soon closed this so-called "protection gap" in all three aforementioned countries effective 1 January 1995.{{sfn|Heylin|2010|p=279}}

By this time, the [[internet]] had increased in popularity, and bootleg review sites began to appear. The quality control of bootlegs began to be scrutinised, as a negative review of one could adversely harm sales.{{sfn|Heylin|2010|p=458}} Bootlegs began to increase in size, with multi-CD packages being common. In 1999, a 4-CD set was released containing three and a half hours of recording sessions for the [[Beach Boys]]' "[[Good Vibrations]]", spanning seven months.{{sfn|Heylin|2010|p=462}}

The tightening of laws and increased enforcement by police on behalf of the [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI), [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) and other industry groups—often for peripheral issues such as [[tax evasion]]—gradually drove the distributors of for-profit vinyl and CD bootlegs further underground.&lt;ref name="Galloway" /&gt; Physical bootlegging largely shifted to countries with laxer copyright laws with the results distributed through existing underground channels, open market sites such as [[eBay]], and other specialised websites, though by the end of the decade, eBay had clamped down on bootlegs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0BAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA115&amp;dq=ebay+bootlegs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjh0cCBjOvJAhUCOBQKHdOZDn4Q6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=ebay%20bootlegs&amp;f=false|title=half.com, buy.com Team on Latest Used Goods Sites|work=Billboard|date=18 November 2000|p=115|accessdate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The late 1990s saw an increase in the free trading of digital bootlegs, sharply decreasing the demand for and profitability of physical bootlegs. The rise of [[audio file format]]s such as [[MP3]] and [[Real Audio]], combined with the ability to share files between computers via the internet made it simpler for bootleg collectors to exchange recordings. The arrival of [[Napster]] in 1999 made it easy to share bootlegs between a large computer network.{{sfn|Heylin|2010|p=476}} Older analog recordings were converted to digital format, tracks from bootleg CDs were [[ripping|ripped]] to computer hard disks, and new material was created with [[digital recording]] of various types, and all of these types could now be easily shared. Instead of album-length collections or live recordings of entire shows, fans often now had the option of searching for and [[downloading]] bootlegs of individual songs.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, Keith.

''NPF Magazine''.  November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Artists gave a mixed reaction to bootleg sharing via the internet; Bob Dylan allowed fans to download archive recordings from his official website, while [[King Crimson]]'s [[Robert Fripp]] and, infamously, [[Metallica]] were strongly critical of the ease in which Napster could circumvent the traditional channels of royalty payments.{{sfn|Heylin|2010|pp=478–9}}

The rise in popularity of the video sharing website [[YouTube]] has caused it to be a major carrier of bootleg recordings. YouTube's owner, [[Google]] believes that under the "safe-harbor" provision of the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA), it cannot be held responsible for content, allowing bootleg media to be hosted on it without fear of a lawsuit. As the technology to host videos is open and available, shutting down YouTube may simply mean the content migrates elsewhere.{{sfn|Hilderbrand|2009|p=242}} An audience recording of one of [[David Bowie]]'s last concerts before he retired from touring in 2004 was uploaded to YouTube and received a positive review in ''Rolling Stone''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/bootleg-of-the-week-david-bowie-live-in-atlantic-city-5-29-04-20151204|title=Bootleg of the Week: David Bowie Live in Atlantic City 5/29/04|first=Andy|last=Greene|work=Rolling Stone|date=4 December 2015|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, YouTube removed a 15-minute limit on videos, which has allowed entire concerts to be uploaded by fans and bootleggers.&lt;ref name=knopper&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/top-artists-adjust-to-new-world-of-youtube-bootlegs-20121217|title=Top Artists Adjust to New World of YouTube Bootlegs|first=Steve|last=Knopper|work=Rolling Stone|date=17 December 2012|accessdate=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This created a market for bootleg CDs in the late 1980s, containing 1960s recordings.{{sfn|Heylin|2010|p=289}}

In the US, bootlegs had been a grey area in legality, but the 1976 Copyright Act extended copyright protection to all recordings, including "all misappropriated recordings, both counterfeit and pirate". This meant bootleggers would take a much greater risk, and several were arrested.{{sfn|Heylin|1994|p=125}} Bootlegs have been prohibited by federal law (17 USC 1101) since the introduction of the [[Uruguay Round Agreements Act]] (URAA, PL 103-465) in 1994, as well as by state law. The federal bootleg statute does not pre-empt state laws, which also apply both prior to and since the passage of the federal bootleg statute. The ''[[US v. Martignon]]'' case challenged the constitutionality of the federal bootleg statute, and in 2004, U.S. District Judge [[Harold Baer Jr.]] struck down the port banning the sale of bootleg recordings of live music, ruling that the law unfairly grants a seemingly perpetual copyright period to the original performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Official releases==
{{main|List of commercially released bootlegs}}
[[File:Springsteen Jersey Devil.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Bruce Springsteen]] has mixed feelings over bootlegs of his popular live performances.]]
Record companies have described bootlegs as "grey area, live recordings", describing them as "semi-condoned".{{sfn|Shuker|2013|p=106}} Research into bootleg consumers found that they are committed fans of the artist; a study of Bruce Springsteen fans showed 80% felt some bootlegs were essential purchases despite owning every official release.{{sfn|Shuker|2013|p=106}} Springsteen has said he understands why fans buy bootlegs, but dislikes the market due to the lack of quality control and making profit over pleasing fans.{{sfn|Heylin|1994|p=136}} [[Frank Zappa]] hated bootlegs and wished to control his recordings, so he created the [[Beat The Boots]] boxed sets, each containing eight LPs that were direct copies of existing bootlegs. He set up a hotline for fans to report bootlegs and was frustrated that the FBI were not interested in prosecuting. The first set included ''As An Am Zappa'', in which he can be heard complaining about bootleggers releasing new material before he could.{{sfn|Heylin|1994|pp=195,395}}

Throughout their career, the [[Grateful Dead]] were known to tolerate taping of the live shows. There was a demand from fans to hear the improvisations that resulted from each show, and the concept of taping shows appealed to the band's general community ethos.{{sfn|Cummings|2013|p=156}} They were unique among bands in that their live shows tended not to be pressed and packaged as LPs, but remained in tape form to be shared between tapers.{{sfn|Cummings|2013|p=157}} The group were strongly opposed to commercial bootlegging and policed stores that sold them, while the saturation of tapes among fans suppressed any demand for product.{{sfn|Heylin|1994|p=397}} In 1985, the Dead, after years of tolerance, officially endorsed live taping of their shows, and set up dedicated areas that they believed gave the best sound recording quality.{{sfn|Cummings|2013|p=158}} Other bands, including [[Pearl Jam]], [[Phish]] and the [[Dave Matthews Band]] tolerate taping in a similar manner to the Dead, provided no profit is involved. Because of the questionable legality of bootlegs, fans have sometimes simply dubbed a bootleg onto tape and freely passed it onto others.{{sfn|Shuker|2013|p=105}}

Many recordings first distributed as bootleg albums were later released officially by the copyright holder. Provided the official release matches the quality of the bootleg, demand for the latter can be suppressed. One of the first rock bootlegs, containing [[John Lennon]]'s performance with the [[Plastic Ono Band]] at the 1969 [[Toronto Rock and Roll Revival]], was released officially as ''[[Live Peace in Toronto 1969]]'' by the end of the year, effectively killing sales of the bootleg.{{sfn|Heylin|1994}} The release of Bob Dylan's 1966 ''[[The Bootleg Series Vol. 4: Bob Dylan Live 1966, The "Royal Albert Hall" Concert|Royal Albert Hall]]'' concert on Vol. 4 of his Bootleg Series in 1998 included both the acoustic and electric sets, more than any bootleg had done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-bootleg-series-vol-4-the-royal-albert-hall-concert-mw0000600853|title=The Bootleg Series, Vol. 4|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=19 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Dave Matthews Band released ''Busted Stuff'' in response to the Internet-fuelled success of ''[[The Lillywhite Sessions]]'' which they had not intended to release. [[Queen (band)|Queen]] released 100 bootlegs for sale as downloads on the band's official website, with profits going to the [[Mercury Phoenix Trust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://econsultancy.com/press-releases/496-queen-take-on-the-bootleggers-with-download-of-own|title=Queen take on the Bootleggers with downloads of their own|publisher=EConsultancy|date=11 November 2004|accessdate=19 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the recording of concerts by [[King Crimson]] and its guitarist [[Robert Fripp]] is prohibited, Fripp's music&amp;nbsp;company [[Discipline Global Mobile]] (DGM) sells concert recordings as downloads, especially "archival recordings" produced from the recordings from the concerts' [[mixing console]]s. With an even greater investment of [[sound engineering]], DGM has released "official bootlegs", which are produced from one or more fan bootlegs.&lt;ref name="Bambarger86" &gt;{{harvtxt|Bambarger|1998|p=86}}: {{cite journal|title=Fripp&amp;nbsp;label does it his way: Guitarist follows own muse in business, too |last=Bambarger|first=Bradley |journal=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-AkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=Fripp+label+does+it+his+way:+Guitarist+follows+own+muse+in+business,+too#v=onepage&amp;q=Fripp%20label%20does%20it%20his%20way%3A%20Guitarist%20follows%20own%20muse%20in%20business%2C%20too&amp;f=false|volume=110|pages=13 and&amp;nbsp;86|date = 11 July 1998|ref=harv|issue=28}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  DGM's [[reverse engineering]] of the [[fence (criminal)|distribution-networks]] for bootlegs helped it to make a successful transition to an age of digital distribution, "unique" (in 2009) among music labels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Anonymous|first=''Belfast Telegraph''|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-20648653.html|title=Jam and the joys of music distribution in today's world|newspaper=Belfast Telegraph|publisher=Independent News and Media PLC|date=18 August 2009|accessdate=14 April 2012|ref=harv|id=(subscription required)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 21st century, artists responded to the demand for recordings of live shows by experimenting with the sale of authorized bootlegs made directly from the soundboard, with a superior quality to an audience recording.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themusic.com/encore/|title=The Encore Series|accessdate=21 December 2015|publisher =themusic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metallica, Phish and Pearl Jam have been regularly distributing instant live bootlegs of their concerts. In 2014, Springsteen announced he would allow fans to purchase a [[USB stick]] at concerts, which could be used to download a bootleg of the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/bruce-springsteen-formalizes-plans-for-instant-live-bootlegs-20140117|title=Bruce Springsteen Formalizes Plans for Instant Live Bootlegs|first=Andy|last=Greene|work=Rolling Stone|date=17 January 2014|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a report in ''Rolling Stone'', many artists have now concluded that the volume of bootlegged performances on YouTube in particular is so large that it is counterproductive to enforce it, and they should use it as a marketing tool instead. Music lawyer Josh Grier has said "Most of the artists have kind of conceded to it."&lt;ref name=knopper/&gt; [[Justin Bieber]] has embraced the distribution of video clips via [[Twitter]] in order to increase his fanbase.&lt;ref name=knopper/&gt;

[[File:20070530 Bronze cow cast.JPG|thumb|right|Bronze casting commemorating Chicago's exhibition]]

'''CowParade''' is an international [[public art]] exhibit that has featured in major world cities. [[Fiberglass]] sculptures of cows are decorated by local artists, and distributed over the city centre, in public places such as train stations, important avenues, and parks. They often feature artwork and designs specific to local culture, as well as city life and other relevant themes.

After the exhibition in the city, which may last many months, the statues are auctioned off and the proceeds donated to charity.

There are a few variations of shape, but the three most common shapes of cow were created by Pascal Knapp, a [[Switzerland|Swiss-born]] sculptor who was commissioned to create the cows specifically for the CowParade series of events. Pascal Knapp owns the copyrights to the standing, lying, and grazing cow shapes used in the CowParade events.

==History==
The concept of "cow parade" has its origins in [[Zürich]], Switzerland, in 1998&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://switzerland.isyours.com/e/photo-gallery/geneva/parade-cows.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 4, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060509065640/http://switzerland.isyours.com/e/photo-gallery/geneva/parade-cows.html |archivedate=May 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by artistic director Walter Knapp, it is based on an idea which was realised in the same city for the first time in 1986: Lions as the symbol of Zurich were painted and then on display throughout the city.

The Zürich exhibit 1998 was not called "cow parade" - it was called '''Land in Sicht''' (roughly translated as "Countryside in view").{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} The concept was brought to the United States when [[Chicago]] businessman Peter Hanig, along with Commissioner of Cultural Affairs [[Lois Weisberg]], organized an event in Chicago in 1999 called '''Cows on Parade'''. A Swiss company, CowHolding Parade AG, started to explore the idea.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} The American company capitalizing on this idea, CowHolding Parade, was founded in 1999; the Swiss company promptly sued but the case fizzled out without results.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} A bronze casting of one of the cows is on permanent display in Chicago in commemoration of the city's initial exhibition.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

The success of this venture inspired many other cities to host similar [[fundraising]] projects. The idea has been taken up by other cities which have chosen animals for public art projects with painted fiberglass sculptures (see [[#Similar projects|Similar projects]]).{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

==Criticism==
CowParade has been criticized by contributing artists for their selectivity standards; [[David Lynch]]'s cow with its flesh partially ripped off, and organs showing, was rejected. The explanation is that this particular CowParade cow was rejected by the City of New York, not the CowParade organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://davidlynch.de/eatmyfear.html |title=David Lynch Cow 'Eat My Fear' |website=Davidlynch.de |date= |accessdate=July 15, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160612125141/http://www.davidlynch.de/eatmyfear.html |archive-date=June 12, 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Swedish organization called [[The Militant Graffiti Artists of Stockholm]] kidnapped and decapitated one of the cows of the Stockholm event in protest of the publicly provisioned cows carrying advertisements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artliberated.org/?p%3Dcases%26id%3D27 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 29, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060714191242/http://www.artliberated.org/?p=cases&amp;id=27 |archivedate=July 14, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wiktionary}}

'''Critique''' is a [[wikt:method|method]] of disciplined, systematic study of a written or oral [[discourse]]. Although critique is commonly understood as fault finding and negative judgment,&lt;ref name="Gasche07p12"&gt;[[Rodolphe Gasché]] (2007) [https://books.google.com/books?id=_CZVDv6bdXIC&amp;pg=PA12 ''The honor of thinking: critique, theory, philosophy''] pp. 12–13 quote: {{quotation|Let us also remind ourselves of the fact that throughout the eighteenth century, which Kant, in ''Critique of Pure Reason'', labeled "in especial degree, the age of criticism" and to which our use of "critique", today remains largely indebted, critique was above all critique of prejudice and established authority, and hence was intimately tied to a conception of the human being as capable of self-thinking, hence authonomous, and free from religious and political authorities.}}&lt;/ref&gt; it can also involve merit recognition, and in the philosophical tradition it also means a methodical practice of doubt.&lt;ref name="Gasche07p12"/&gt; The contemporary sense of critique has been largely influenced by the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] critique of prejudice and authority, which championed the emancipation and autonomy from religious and political authorities.&lt;ref name="Gasche07p12"/&gt;

The term ''critique'' derives, via French, from Ancient Greek {{lang|grc|κριτική}} ({{transl|grc|ISO|kritikē}}), meaning "the faculty of judgment", that is, discerning the value of persons or things.&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;{{OED|critick}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critique is also known as major [[logic]], as opposed to minor [[logic]] or [[dialectic]]s.

== Critique in philosophy ==
Philosophy is the application of critical thought{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}, and is the disciplined practice of processing the ''theory/praxis problem''. In [[philosophy|philosophical]] contexts, such as law or academics, critique is most influenced by [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s use of the term to mean a reflective examination of the validity and limits of a human capacity or of a set of philosophical claims. This has been extended in [[modern philosophy]] to mean a systematic inquiry into the conditions and consequences of a [[concept]], a [[theory]], a [[discipline]], or an approach and/or attempt to understand the limitations and [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of that. A ''critical perspective'', in this sense, is the opposite of a [[dogma]]tic one. Kant wrote:

{{quote|We deal with a concept dogmatically ... if we consider it as contained under another concept of the object which constitutes a principle of reason and determine it in conformity with this. But we deal with it merely critically if we consider it only in reference to our cognitive faculties and consequently to the subjective conditions of thinking it, without undertaking to decide anything about its object.&lt;ref&gt;Immanuel Kant, ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'' section 74.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Later thinkers such as [[Hegel]] used the word 'critique' in a broader way than Kant's sense of the word, to mean the systematic inquiry into the limits of a [[doctrine]] or ''set'' of concepts. This referential expansion led, for instance, to the formulation of the idea of social critique, such as arose after [[Karl Marx]]'s theoretical work delineated in his [[Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy]] (1859), which was a critique of the then-current models of economic theory and thought of that time. Further critique can then be applied after the fact, by using thorough critique as a basis for new argument. The idea of ''critique'' is elemental to legal, aesthetic, and literary theory and such practices, such as in the analysis and evaluation of [[writing]]s such as pictorial, musical, or expanded textual works.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of philosophical conceptions of critique from Spinoza to Rancière see K. de Boer and R. Sonderegger (eds.), ''Conceptions of Critique in Modern and Contemporary Philosophy'' (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critique vs criticism ==
In French, German, or Italian, no distinction is drawn between 'critique' and '[[criticism]]': the two words both translate as ''critique'', ''Kritik'', and ''critica'', respectively.&lt;ref name="Vattimo90p57"&gt;[[Gianni Vattimo]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=i7QOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA57 ''Postmodern criticism: postmodern critique''] in David Wood (1990) ''Writing the future'', pp. 57–58&lt;/ref&gt; In the English language, according to philosopher [[Gianni Vattimo]], ''criticism'' is used more frequently to denote [[literary criticism]] or [[art criticism]], that is the interpretation and evaluation of literature and art; while ''critique'' may be used to refer to more general and profound writing as [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of pure reason]]''.&lt;ref name="Vattimo90p57"/&gt; Another proposed distinction is that critique is never personalized nor [[ad hominem]], but is instead the analyses of the structure of the thought in the content of the item critiqued.&lt;ref name="Vattimo90p57"/&gt; This analysis then offers by way of the critique method either a rebuttal or a suggestion of further expansion upon the problems presented by the topic of that specific written or oral argumentation. Even authors that believe there might be a distinction suggest that there is some ambiguity that is still unresolved.&lt;ref name="Vattimo90p57"/&gt;

==Critical theory==
{{main|Critical theory}}
Marx's work inspired the '[[Frankfurt School]]' of  [[critical theory]], now best exemplified in the work of [[Jürgen Habermas]].&lt;ref&gt;David Ingram, ''Habermas: Introduction and Analysis'', New York: Cornell University Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; This, in turn, helped inspire the [[cultural studies]] form of social critique, which treats cultural products and their reception as evidence of wider social ills such as [[racism]] or [[gender bias]]. Social critique has been further extended in the work of [[Michel Foucault]]&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault, ''Was ist Kritik?'', Berlin: Merve Verlag 1992. {{ISBN|3-88396-093-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of [[Alasdair MacIntyre]].&lt;ref&gt;Alasdair MacIntyre, ''After Virtue'', Notre Dame: University of Notre Dama Press, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; In their different and radically contrasting ways, MacIntyre and Foucault go well beyond the original Kantian meaning of the term ''critique'' in contesting legitimatory accounts of social power.

"'''Don't be evil'''" is a [[motto]] used within [[Google]]'s corporate code of conduct.

Following Google's corporate restructuring under the conglomerate [[Alphabet Inc.]] in October 2015, Alphabet took "Do the right thing" as its motto, also forming the opening of its corporate code of conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2015/10/02/alphabet-do-the-right-thing/ |title=Alphabet replaces Google's 'Don't be evil' with 'Do the right thing |last=Lawler |first=Richard |date=2 October 2015 |publisher=[[AOL]] |work=[[Engadget]] |accessdate=7 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Why Google Was Smart To Drop Its 'Don’t Be Evil' Motto |author=David Mayer |url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3056389/why-google-was-smart-to-drop-its-dont-be-evil-motto |magazine=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]] |date=2 September 2016 |accessdate=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=New Google Parent Company Drops 'Don't be Evil' Motto |author=Tanya Basu |url=http://time.com/4060575/alphabet-google-dont-be-evil/ |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=4 October 2015 |accessdate=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://investor.google.com/corporate/code-of-conduct.html |title=Code of Conduct |publisher=Google|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151004012914/https://investor.google.com/corporate/code-of-conduct.html|archive-date=4 October 2015 |accessdate=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://abc.xyz/investor/other/code-of-conduct.html |title=Alphabet Code of Conduct |date=2 October 2015 |publisher=Alphabet |accessdate=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original motto was retained in Google's code of conduct, now a subsidiary of Alphabet. In April 2018, the motto was removed from the code of conduct's preface and retained in its last sentence.&lt;ref name=SEJ&gt;{{cite journal |last=Montti |first=Roger |url=https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-dont-be-evil/254019/ |title=Google's "Don't Be Evil" No Longer Prefaces Code of Conduct |journal=Search Engine Journal |date=20 May 2018 |accessdate=20 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The motto was first suggested either by Google employee [[Paul Buchheit]] at a meeting about corporate values that took place in early 2000&lt;ref name="blogoscoped"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogoscoped.com/archive/2007-07-16-n55.html |title=Paul Buchheit on Gmail, AdSense and More |publisher=[[Blogoscoped]] |date=25 January 2007 |accessdate=4 April 2013}} (quoting from: [[Jessica Livingston]], ''[[Founders at Work]]'', {{ISBN|978-1590597149}})&lt;/ref&gt; or in 2001&lt;ref name="gleick2011" /&gt; or, according to another account, by Google Engineer Amit Patel in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |location=AU |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/biztech/dont-be-evil/2008/04/15/1208025168177.html?page=3 |title=Don't Be Evil or don't lose value? |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=15 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Buchheit, the creator of [[Gmail]], said he "wanted something that, once you put it in there, would be hard to take out", adding that the slogan was "also a bit of a jab at a lot of the other companies, especially our competitors, who at the time, in our opinion, were kind of exploiting the users to some extent".&lt;ref name="blogoscoped" /&gt; 

While the official corporate philosophy of Google&lt;ref name="GooglePhil"&gt;{{cite web |title=Ten things we know to be true |url=https://www.google.com/about/company/philosophy/ |website=Google Company |publisher=Google |accessdate=25 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; does not contain the words "Don't be evil", they were included in the [[prospectus (finance)|prospectus]] (on [[Form S-1]]) of Google's 2004 [[Initial Public Offering|IPO]] (a letter from Google's founders, later called the "'Don't Be Evil' manifesto"): "Don't be evil.  We believe strongly that in the long term, we will be better served—as shareholders and in all other ways—by a company that does good things for the world even if we forgo some short term gains."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/deals/2011/06/23/what-would-2004-google-say-about-antitrust-probe/ |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |first=Shira |last=Ovide |title=What Would 2004 Google Say About Antitrust Probe? |date=23 June 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6bz8paR7v?url=https://blogs.wsj.com/deals/2011/06/23/what-would-2004-google-say-about-antitrust-probe/ |archivedate=2 October 2015 |accessdate=2 October 2015 |deadurl=no |quote="Our goal is to develop services that significantly improve the lives of as many people as possible.

We believe strongly that in the long term, we will be better served—as shareholders and in all other ways—by a company that does good things for the world even if we forgo some short term gains. This is an important aspect of our culture and is broadly shared within the company..." |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motto is sometimes incorrectly stated as ''Do no evil''.&lt;ref name="gleick2011"&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/aug/18/how-google-dominates-us/?pagination=false |title=How Google Dominates Us |first=James |last=Gleick |authorlink=James Gleick |publisher=[[The New York Review of Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = http://gawker.com/valleywag/tech/google/dont-be-evil-factcheck-the-company-motto-153908.php |contribution=Don’t be evil. Fact-check the company motto |title=[[Valleywag]] |publisher=[[Gawker]] |author=ndouglas |date=9 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of early 2018, the motto was still cited in the preface to Google's Code of Conduct:

&lt;blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;"&gt; 
"Don't be evil." Googlers generally apply those words to how we serve our users. But "Don't be evil" is much more than that...

The Google Code of Conduct is one of the ways we put "Don't be evil" into practice...&lt;ref name=SEJ/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Between 21 April and 4 May 2018, Google removed the motto from the preface, leaving a mention in the final line: "And remember… don't be evil, and if you see something that you think isn't right – speak up!"&lt;ref name=SEJ/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gizmodo 18 May 2018"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Conger |first1=Kate |title=Google Removes 'Don't Be Evil' Clause From Its Code of Conduct |url=https://gizmodo.com/google-removes-nearly-all-mentions-of-dont-be-evil-from-1826153393 |accessdate=19 May 2018 |work=Gizmodo |date=18 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretations ==
In their 2004 founders' letter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000119312504142742/ds1a.htm#toc59330_1 |publisher=[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] |location=USA |title=Letter from the founders, "an owner's manual" for Google's shareholders |date=14 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; prior to their [[initial public offering]], [[Larry Page]] and [[Sergey Brin]] argued that their "Don't be evil" culture prohibited [[conflicts of interest]], and required [[objectivity (journalism)|objectivity]] and an absence of [[bias]]:

{{quotation|Google users trust our systems to help them with important decisions: medical, financial and many others. Our search results are the best we know how to produce. They are unbiased and objective, and we do not accept payment for them or for inclusion or more frequent updating.  We also display advertising, which we work hard to make relevant, and we label it clearly. This is similar to a well-run newspaper, where the advertisements are clear and the articles are not influenced by the advertisers’ payments. We believe it is important for everyone to have access to the best information and research, not only to the information people pay for you to see.}}

[[Chris Hoofnagle]], director of [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California]], [[Berkeley Law]]'s [[information privacy]] programs, has stated that Google's original intention expressed by the "don't be evil" motto is linked to the company's separation of search results from advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |volume=14 |number=4–6 |date=April 2009 |journal=First Monday |first=Chris |last=Hoofnagle |url=http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2326/2156 |title=Beyond Google and evil: How policy makers, journalist and consumers should talk differently about Google and privacy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, he argues that clearly separating search results from sponsored links is required by law, thus, Google's practice is now mainstream and no longer remarkable or good.  Hoofnagle argued in 2009 that Google should abandon the motto because:

{{quotation|The evil talk is not only an [[Albatross (metaphor)|albatross]] for Google, it obscures the substantial consumer benefits from Google’s advertising model. Because we have forgotten the original context of Google’s evil representations, the company should remind the public of the company’s contribution to a revolution in search advertising, and highlight some overlooked benefits of their model.}}In a 2013 [[NPR]] interview, [[Eric Schmidt]] revealed that when Larry Page and Sergey Brin recommended the motto as a guiding principle for Google, he "thought this was the stupidest rule ever", but then changed his opinion after a meeting where an engineer successfully referred to the motto when expressing concerns about a planned advertising product, which was eventually cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailytech.com/Googles+Eric+Schmidt+Dont+Be+Evil+was+Stupid/article31544.htm |publisher=[[DailyTech|DailyTech LLC]] |location=USA |title=Google's Eric Schmidt: "Don't Be Evil" was Stupid |date=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists have raised questions about the actual definition of what Google considered "evil".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://qz.com/284548/what-google-really-means-by-dont-be-evil/ |publisher=[[Atlantic Media|Quartz]] |location=USA |title=What Google really means by "Don’t be evil" |date=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/10/what-is-evil-to-google/280573/ |publisher=[[The Atlantic Monthly Group]] |location=USA |title=What Is 'Evil' to Google? |date=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the user-facing 'What We Believe' page, Google appeared to replace the original motto altogether (a carefully reworded version stood as of 10 April 2015, "''You can'' make money without doing evil",&lt;ref name="GooglePhil" /&gt; which varied significantly from the absolute [[Imperative mood|imperative]] of ''DON'T be'' evil).

==Use in criticism of Google==

[[Criticism of Google|Critics of Google]] frequently spin the motto in a negative way, such as [[InfoWorld|InfoWorld's]] 2014 article ''"Google? Evil? You have no idea"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/2610434/cringely/google--evil--you-have-no-idea.html |title=Google? Evil? You have no idea |date=13 March 2014 |publisher=[[InfoWorld|InfoWorld, Inc]] |location=USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ira-israel/why-google-is-evil_b_3716786.html |title=Why Google Is Evil |date=7 October 2013 |publisher=[[The Huffington Post]] |location=USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2010/01/googles-dont-be-evil-mantra-is-bullshit-adobe-is-lazy-apples-steve-jobs/ |title=Steve Jobs: "Google's Don't Be Evil Mantra is Bullshit" |date=30 January 2010 |publisher=[[Wired_(magazine)|Wired]] |location=USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/101923422 |title=Does 'Don't be evil' still apply to Google? |website=CNBC News |publisher=[[CNBC]] |accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google's 2012 announcement to "begin tracking users universally across all its services" (via [[Google+|"Google Plus"]] accounts) resulted in public backlash on the motto, like "Google's Broken Promise: The End of 'Don't Be Evil'" on [[Gizmodo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://gizmodo.com/5878987/its-official-google-is-evil-now |title=Google's Broken Promise: The End of "Don't Be Evil" |date=24 January 2012 |publisher=[[Gizmodo]] |location=USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/google-kills-reader-force-feeds-us-google-dont-be-evil-1127159 |title=Google Kills Reader, Force-Feeds Us Google+: Don't Be Evil? |date=14 March 2013 |publisher=[[IBT Media]] |location=USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/15/technology/the-plus-in-google-plus-its-mostly-for-google.html?_r=2 |title=The Plus in Google Plus? It’s Mostly for Google |date=14 February 2014 |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |location=USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, major [[Social media|social networks]] even co-developed a "''Don't be evil''" browser bookmarklet (specifically to expose alleged [[Search engine results page|SERP]] manipulation promoting Google-owned content over that of others).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jan/24/facebook-twitter-myspace-google-add-on |title=Facebook, Myspace and Twitter chide Google with 'Don't be evil' add-on |date=24 January 2012 |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |location=Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 May 2013, [[Margaret Hodge MP]], the chair of the [[United Kingdom]] [[Public Accounts Committee]] accused Google of being "calculated and unethical" over [[tax avoidance by Google|its use of highly contrived and artificial distinctions]] to avoid paying billions of pounds in [[Corporation tax]] owed by its UK operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/may/16/google-told-by-mp-you-do-do-evil |title=MP on Google tax avoidance scheme: 'I think that you do evil' |author=Simon Bowers |work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was accused by the committee, which represents the interests of all UK taxpayers, of being "evil" for not paying its "fair amount of tax". She told [[Matt Brittin]], head of Google UK, "I think that you do evil".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-22554548 |title=Margaret Hodge labels Google tax record 'evil' |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the UK Government introduced a new law intended to penalise Google and other large [[multinational corporation|multinational]] corporations' artificial tax avoidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-31942639 |title=Budget 2015: 'Google Tax' introduction confirmed |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, [[The Commercial Appeal]] reported that "critics say Google's recent moves belie search giant's motto".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.commercialappeal.com/business/turning-evil |title=Turning 'evil': Critics say Google's recent moves belie search giant's motto |website=The Commercial Appeal |publisher=[[Journal Media Group]] |accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Early English Text Society''' ('''EETS''') is a [[text publication society]] founded in 1864, dedicated to the editing and publication of early English texts, especially those only available in manuscript. Most of its volumes contain editions of [[Middle English]] or [[Old English]] texts. It is known for having been the first to print many important English manuscripts, including [[Cotton Library|Cotton Nero A.x]], which contains ''[[Pearl (poem)|Pearl]]'', ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]'', and other poems.

==History==
[[File:Blickling homilies leaf 141.png|thumb|left|A page of the [[Blickling Homilies]] in facsimile, as reproduced in ''The Blickling Homilies of the Tenth Century: from the Marquis of Lothian's unique MS A.D. 971'', edited and translated by [[Richard Morris (philology)|Richard Morris]], EETS o.s. vols 58, 63, 73 (1874–80)]]
The Society was founded in England in 1864 by [[Frederick James Furnivall]]. Its stated goal in a report of its first year of existence was, "on the one hand, to print all that is most valuable of the yet unprinted {{abbr|MSS.|manuscripts}} in English, and, on the other, to re-edit and reprint all that is most valuable in printed English books, which from their scarcity or price are not within the reach of the student of moderate means."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=4 Nov 2005 |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/17000/17000-h/17000-h.htm#report |title=Report of the Committee, January, 1865 |publisher=Project Gutenberg |accessdate=17 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As of 2016, the Society had published 347 volumes in its Original Series; 126 volumes in its Extra Series, published between 1867 and 1935, comprising texts previously printed, but only in unsatisfactory or rare editions; and 25 volumes in its Supplementary Series, an occasional and irregular series initiated in 1970. The Society keeps the majority of its older publications in print, excepting only those which have been superseded by subsequent editions in its own series. Volumes are now published on behalf of the Society by [[Oxford University Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://users.ox.ac.uk/~eets/list-of-all-publications-2015.pdf |title=List of Publications 2015 |publisher=Early English Text Society |accessdate=30 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Explorative strategies''' are used in drama to explore a theme or a text. They are associated with Edexcel GCSE.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Types of strategies==
*''' Forum Theatre''' - The actors either create a planned improvisation or create a piece spontaneously, as it is performed the audience can either stop the action to suggest changes or take over from the actors on stage to change the direction of the performance. Quite often this is used as an exploration tool rather than as a piece of theatre for performance. A theme or key moment/decision can be explored to its fullest.
*'''Thought Tracking''' - Whilst in role, the character speaks out to the audience about what that character is thinking, feeling, doing etc.
*'''Still Image''' - Also known as a "[[freeze frame shot|freeze frame]]" or "tableau" or "snapshot" or "qais", this is when all the characters on stage stop still. Can be used if a narrator wishes to speak to the audience whilst something is happening on stage.
*'''Hot Seating''' - A character is interrogated by the audience. Normally used as an "in class" activity, this allows the audience to find things out about a character, and requires the actor playing the character to think about what he/she is doing, feeling, etc.
*'''Cross Cutting''' - When time in a scene changes to show  what happens before or after a scene.
*'''Narrating''' - A character, normally called the "Narrator", will speak out to the audience about what is going on in the plot
*'''Marking the moment''' - Key moments in the performance are highlighted either through a freeze frame, or a change in light or some sound by using slow motion, noises etc..
*'''Role-play''' - A role-play is what you do when you're pretending to be another person and using your imagination to speak, think and even feel like that character.

'''FlexBook''' is a [[textbook]] authoring platform offered by the [[CK-12 Foundation]]. Launched in 2008, FlexBooks reduce the cost of textbooks for the [[K-12 (education)|K-12]] market both in U.S and worldwide. Derived from the words "flexibility" and "textbook," a FlexBook allows users to produce and customize content by re-purposing educational content using different modules. FlexBooks can be designed to suit a learner’s learning style, region, language, or level of skill, while adhering to the local education standards.&lt;ref&gt;[https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/9378/ Creative Commons]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==
FlexBooks are designed to overcome some of the limitations of traditional textbooks. Anyone – including teachers, students, and parents - can adapt, create, and configure a FlexBook.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ck12.org/about/about-us About us]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some FlexBooks features include:
* Web-based collaborative model, where the user can create and edit content to produce a custom textbook&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20090907monday.html NY Times]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Open Educational Resource([[Open educational resources|OER]]) which allows for easy remixing of content
* Available in PDF, HTML, ePub (for iPad) and AZW (for Kindle)

== Licensing ==
Each CK-12 FlexBook is created under Creative Commons Attribution-Non-Commercial 3.0 Unported (CC BY-NC 3.0) License,&lt;ref&gt;[https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/ Creative Commons Licenses]&lt;/ref&gt; giving its author/user a right to share (i.e., right to copy, distribute and transmit the work) a right to remix (i.e., right to adapt the work). However, conditions of [[Attribution (copyright)|Attribution]] and [[Non-commercial]] apply.

== Examples of use and collaboration ==
In March 2009, FlexBook was lauded as “an adaptive, web-based set of instructional materials” by Virginia officials when members from Virginia’s K-12 physics community along with university and industry volunteers developed an eleven chapter FlexBook titled “21st Century Physics FlexBook: A Compilation of Contemporary and Modern Technologies” in just 4 months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oerconsortium.org/tag/FlexBook/ OER Consortium]&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2010, NASA teamed up with CK-12 to add a chapter on “[[modeling and simulation]]” to the existing Physics FlexBook created earlier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/releases/2010/10-086.html NASA News, NASA teams with ‘CK 12’ Foundation on Physics FlexBook (2010). Retrieved November 18, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;   In November 2011, teachers from a school district, Anoka-Hennepin, Minnesota, reportedly, saved the district $175,000 by writing their own online textbook instead of buying $65 textbooks – earlier, costing the district to the tune of $200,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/09/minnesota-teachers-write-_n_1084972.html HuffingtonPost]&lt;/ref&gt; Wolfram has teamed up with CK-12 to produce interactive FlexBooks with Wolfram demonstrations embedded into the FlexBooks.

Nietzsche's body of work touched a wide range of topics, including art, [[philology]], history, religion, [[tragedy]], culture and science. His early inspiration was drawn from figures such as [[Arthur Schopenhauer]],&lt;ref name=IEP/&gt; [[Richard Wagner]]&lt;ref name=IEP/&gt; and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]].&lt;ref name=IEP/&gt; His writing spans philosophical [[polemic]]s, poetry, [[cultural critic]]ism and fiction while displaying a fondness for [[aphorism]] and [[irony]].&lt;ref&gt;McKinnon, A. M. (2012). 'Metaphors in and for the Sociology of Religion: Towards a Theory after Nietzsche'.

Nietzsche (1888), ''Twilight of the Idols''. "Four Great Errors", 1, tr. W. Kaufmann &amp;amp; R.J. Hollingdale ([http://www.handprint.com/SC/NIE/GotDamer.html online version]).  A strict example of a cause-and-effect mismatch, with regard to the God-creator as the cause and our concepts as the effects, is perhaps not fully stressed in this fragment, but the more ''explicit'' it is stressed in the same book, chapter ""Reason" in philosophy", 4, as well as in ''The Antichrist'' (57, where real and imaginary origins are contrasted, and 62, where he calls Christianity 'a fatality'—'fatal' also meaning 'unavoidable') and in ''The Genealogy of Morals'', books 1–3, among others.  The topic of "''false'' origins" of ideas is also suggested in ''The Four Great Errors'', 3, and (precisely about morality) in e.g. ''The Will to Power'', tr. W. Kaufmann, 343 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=qylpH4E4enQC&amp;pg=PT272#v=onepage online text here]).&lt;/ref&gt; his aesthetic [[Nietzschean affirmation|affirmation]] of existence in response to the "[[God is dead|death of God]]" and the profound crisis of [[nihilism]];&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"/&gt; his notion of the [[Apollonian and Dionysian]]; and his characterization of the human [[subject (philosophy)|subject]] as the expression of competing [[will (philosophy)|wills]], collectively understood as the [[will to power]].&lt;ref&gt;K.

Press, 2013, pp. 177–78 ("The Duality of Nietzsche's Theory of the Will to Power: The Psychological and Cosmological Aspects"). [https://books.google.com/books?id=yZmJAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA177 Read online here]&lt;/ref&gt; He also developed influential concepts such as the ''{{lang|de|[[Übermensch]]}}'' and the doctrine of [[eternal return]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nietzsche's teaching : an interpretation of Thus spoke Zarathustra|last=1941–|first=Lampert, Laurence|date=1986|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0300044300|location=New Haven|oclc=13497182}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Friedrich Nietzsche: Herald of a New Era|last=Bowman|first=William|publisher=Hazar Press|year=2016|isbn=978-0997570304|location=|pages=39–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his later work, he became increasingly preoccupied with the creative powers of the individual to overcome social, cultural and moral contexts in pursuit of [[transvaluation of values|new values]] and aesthetic health.&lt;ref name="Friedrich Nietzsche"/&gt;

Nietzsche was explicitly [[philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche#Nietzsche's criticism of anti-Semitism and nationalism|opposed to antisemitism and nationalism]], although his sister attempted to associate his work with [[fascism]] and [[Nazism]].&lt;ref name="Golomb 2002"&gt;Golomb, Jacob and Robert S. Wistrich (eds.), 2002, ''Nietzsche, Godfather of Fascism?: On the Uses and Abuses of a Philosophy.'' Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nietzsche's thought enjoyed renewed popularity in the 1960s and his ideas have since had a profound impact on 20th and early-21st century thinkers across philosophy—especially in schools of [[continental philosophy]] such as [[existentialism]], [[postmodernism]] and [[post-structuralism]]—as well as art, literature, [[psychology]], politics and popular culture.&lt;ref name="Raymond A.

Born on 15 October 1844, Nietzsche grew up in the small town of [[Röcken]], near [[Leipzig]], in the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] [[Province of Saxony]]. He was named after King [[Frederick William IV of Prussia|Friedrich Wilhelm IV of Prussia]], who turned 49 on the day of Nietzsche's birth (Nietzsche later dropped his middle name Wilhelm).{{Sfn |Kaufmann |1974 |p=22}} Nietzsche's parents, Carl Ludwig Nietzsche (1813–1849), a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] pastor and former teacher; and {{ill|Franziska Nietzsche|de|Franziska Oehler}} (1826–1897), married in 1843, the year before their son's birth. They had two other children: a daughter, [[Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche]], born in 1846; and a second son, Ludwig Joseph, born in 1848. Nietzsche's father died from a brain ailment in 1849; Ludwig Joseph died six months later at age two.&lt;ref name="Wicks"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/nietzsche/ |title=Friedrich Nietzsche |last=Wicks |first=Robert |date=1 January 2014 |editor-last=Zalta |editor-first=Edward N. |edition=Winter 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family then moved to [[Naumburg]], where they lived with Nietzsche's maternal grandmother and his father's two unmarried sisters. After the death of Nietzsche's grandmother in 1856, the family moved into their own house, now [[Nietzsche-Haus, Naumburg|Nietzsche-Haus]], a museum and Nietzsche study centre.

[[File:Nietzsche1861.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Nietzsche, 1861]]
Nietzsche attended a boys' school and then a private school, where he became friends with Gustav Krug, [[Rudolf Wagner]] and Wilhelm Pinder, all of whom came from highly respected families.

In 1854, he began to attend Domgymnasium in [[Naumburg]]. Because his father had worked for the state (as a pastor) the now-fatherless Nietzsche was offered a scholarship to study at the internationally recognized [[Pforta|Schulpforta]] (the claim that Nietzsche was admitted on the strength of his academic competence has been debunked: his grades were nowhere near the top of the class).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brobjer|first1=Thomas H.|title=Why Did Nietzsche Receive a Scholarship to Study at Schulpforta?|journal=Nietzsche-Studien|volume=30|pages=322–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; He transferred and studied there from 1858 to 1864, becoming friends with [[Paul Deussen]] and Carl von Gersdorff. He also found time to work on poems and musical compositions. Nietzsche led "Germania", a music and literature club, during his summers in Naumburg.&lt;ref name="Wicks"/&gt; At [[Schulpforta]], Nietzsche received an important grounding in languages—Greek, Latin, [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and French—so as to be able to read important [[primary source]]s;&lt;ref&gt;Krell, David Farrell, and Donald L. Bates. ''The Good European: Nietzsche's work sites in word and image''. University of Chicago Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; he also experienced for the first time being away from his family life in a small-town conservative environment. His end-of-semester exams in March 1864 showed a 1 in Religion and German; a 2a in Greek and Latin; a 2b in French, History, and Physics; and a "lackluster" 3 in Hebrew and Mathematics.{{Sfn |Cate |2005 |p=37}}

While at [[Pforta]], Nietzsche had a penchant for pursuing subjects that were considered unbecoming. He became acquainted with the work of the then almost-unknown poet [[Friedrich Hölderlin]], calling him "my favorite poet" and composing an essay in which he said that the mad poet raised consciousness to "the most sublime ideality."&lt;ref&gt;Hayman, Ronald. ''Nietzsche: A Critical Life'', p. 42. Oxford University Press, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; The teacher who corrected the essay gave it a good mark but commented that Nietzsche should concern himself in the future with healthier, more lucid, and more "German" writers. Additionally, he became acquainted with [[Ernst Ortlepp]], an eccentric, blasphemous, and often drunken poet who was found dead in a ditch weeks after meeting the young Nietzsche but who may have introduced Nietzsche to the music and writing of [[Richard Wagner]].&lt;ref&gt;Kohler, Joachim. ''Nietzsche &amp; Wagner: A Lesson in Subjugation'', p. 17. Yale University Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps under Ortlepp's influence, he and a student named Richter returned to school drunk and encountered a teacher, resulting in Nietzsche's demotion from first in his class and the end of his status as a [[Prefect#Academic|prefect]].{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=21}}

After graduation in September 1864,&lt;ref&gt;His "valedictorian paper" (''Valediktionsarbeit'', graduation thesis for Pforta students) was titled "On [[Theognis of Megara]]" ("''De Theognide Megarensi''"); see Anthony K. Jensen, Helmut Heit (eds.), ''Nietzsche as a Scholar of Antiquity'', A&amp;C Black, 2014, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche commenced studies in theology and classical philology at the [[University of Bonn]] with hope of becoming a minister. For a short time he and Deussen became members of the [[Burschenschaft]] ''[[Franconia|Frankonia]]''. After one semester (and to the anger of his mother), he stopped his theological studies and lost his faith.&lt;ref name=Schaberg&gt;{{Citation |last=Schaberg |first=William |title=The Nietzsche Canon |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1996 |page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as his 1862 essay "Fate and History", Nietzsche had argued that historical research had discredited the central teachings of Christianity,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Jörg |last=Salaquarda |contribution=Nietzsche and the Judaeo-Christian tradition |title=The Cambridge Companion to Nietzsche |place=Cambridge |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=1996 |page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[David Strauss]]'s ''[[Life of Jesus in the New Testament|Life of Jesus]]'' also seems to have had a profound effect on the young man.&lt;ref name=Schaberg/&gt; In addition, [[Ludwig Feuerbach]]'s ''[[The Essence of Christianity]]'' influenced young Nietzsche with its argument that people created God, and not the other way around.&lt;ref name=Higgins&gt;{{Citation |last=Higgins |first=Kathleen |title=What Nietzsche Really Said|publisher=Random House, NY |year=2000|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1865, at the age of 20, Nietzsche wrote to his sister Elisabeth, who was deeply religious, a letter regarding his loss of faith. This letter contains the following statement:

[[File:Frankfurt Am Main-Portraits-Arthur Schopenhauer-1845.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] strongly influenced Nietzsche's earliest philosophical thought]]
Nietzsche subsequently concentrated on studying philology under Professor [[Friedrich Wilhelm Ritschl]], whom he followed to the [[University of Leipzig]] in 1865.{{sfn|Magnus|1999}} There, he became close friends with his fellow student [[Erwin Rohde]]. Nietzsche's first philological publications appeared soon after.

In 1865, Nietzsche thoroughly studied the works of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]. He owed the awakening of his philosophical interest to reading Schopenhauer's ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'' and later admitted that Schopenhauer was one of the few thinkers whom he respected, dedicating the essay "[[s:Schopenhauer as Educator|Schopenhauer as Educator]]" in the ''[[Untimely Meditations]]'' to him.

In 1866, he read [[Friedrich Albert Lange]]'s ''[[History of Materialism and Critique of its Present Importance|History of Materialism]]''. Lange's descriptions of [[Kant]]'s anti-materialistic philosophy, the rise of European [[Materialism]], Europe's increased concern with science, [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]], and the general rebellion against tradition and authority intrigued Nietzsche greatly. Nietzsche would ultimately argue the impossibility of an evolutionary explanation of the human aesthetic sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Pence |first=Charles H. |title=Nietzsche's aesthetic critique of Darwin |journal=History and Philosophy of the Life Sciences |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=165–90 |year=2011 |pmid=22288334 |url=https://www.academia.edu/759427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1867, Nietzsche signed up for one year of voluntary service with the Prussian artillery division in Naumburg. He was regarded as one of the finest riders among his fellow recruits, and his officers predicted that he would soon reach the rank of captain. However, in March 1868, while jumping into the saddle of his horse, Nietzsche struck his chest against the [[Saddle|pommel]] and tore two muscles in his left side, leaving him exhausted and unable to walk for months.&lt;ref&gt;Hayman, Ronald. ''Nietzsche: A Critical Life'', p. 93. Oxford University Press (New York), 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, Friedrich. [[s:Selected Letters of Friedrich Nietzsche#To Freiherr Karl Von Gersdorff – June, 1868|Letter to Karl Von Gersdorff]], June 1868.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, Nietzsche turned his attention to his studies again, completing them in 1868 and meeting with [[Richard Wagner]] for the first time later that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Selected_Letters_of_Friedrich_Nietzsche#To_Rohde_-_October.2C_1868 |title=Letter to Rohde |date=November 1868 |last=Nietzsche |first=Friedrich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professor at Basel (1869–1878)===
{{anchor|Professor at Basel|Basel}}
[[File:Rohde Gersdorff Nietzsche.JPG|thumb|upright|From left to right: [[Erwin Rohde]], Karl von Gersdorff and Nietzsche, October 1871]]
In part because of Ritschl's support, Nietzsche received a remarkable offer in 1869 to become professor of [[classical philology]] at the [[University of Basel]] in Switzerland. He was only 24 years old and had neither completed his doctorate nor received a teaching certificate ("[[habilitation]]"). He was awarded an honorary doctorate by the [[Leipzig University|University of Leipzig]], again with Ritschl's support.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony K. Jensen, Helmut Heit (eds.), ''Nietzsche as a Scholar of Antiquity'', A&amp;C Black, 2014, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the fact that the offer came at a time when he was considering giving up philology for science, he accepted.{{Sfn |Kaufmann |1974 |p=25}} To this day, Nietzsche is still among the youngest of the tenured Classics professors on record.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Paul |last=Bishop |title=Nietzsche and Antiquity |year=2004 |page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nietzsche's 1870 projected [[doctoral thesis]], ''Contribution toward the Study and the Critique of the Sources of Diogenes Laertius'' (''Beiträge zur Quellenkunde und Kritik des Laertius Diogenes''), examined the origins of the ideas of [[Diogenes Laërtius]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony K. Jensen, Helmut Heit (eds.), ''Nietzsche as a Scholar of Antiquity'', A&amp;C Black, 2014, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Though never submitted, it was later published as a ''Gratulationsschrift'' (congratulatory publication) at [[Basel]].&lt;ref&gt;George E. McCarthy, [http://personal.kenyon.edu/mccarthy/Book1.htm ''Dialectics and Decadence'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Between 1868 and 1870, he published two other studies on Diogenes Laertius: ''De Fontibus Diogenis Laertii'' ("On the Sources of Diogenes Laertius"; Part I: 1868, Part II: 1869) and ''Analecta Laertiana'' (1870); see Jensen and Heit (eds.), 2014, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before moving to Basel, Nietzsche renounced his Prussian citizenship: for the rest of his life he remained officially [[Stateless person|stateless]].&lt;ref&gt;Hecker, Hellmuth: "Nietzsches Staatsangehörigkeit als Rechtsfrage", ''Neue Juristische Wochenschrift'', Jg. 40, 1987, nr. 23, pp. 1388–91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;His, Eduard: "Friedrich Nietzsches Heimatlosigkeit", ''Basler Zeitschrift für Geschichte und Altertumskunde'', vol. 40, 1941, p. 159–86. Note that some authors (among them Deussen and [[Mazzino Montinari|Montinari]]) mistakenly claim that Nietzsche became a Swiss citizen.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, Nietzsche served in the Prussian forces during the [[Franco-Prussian War]] (1870–1871) as a medical [[orderly]]. In his short time in the military, he experienced much and witnessed the traumatic effects of battle. He also contracted [[diphtheria]] and [[dysentery]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] speculates that he might also have contracted [[syphilis]] at a brothel along with his other infections at this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Sax|first1=L.|title=What was the cause of Nietzsche's dementia?|journal=[[Journal of Medical Biography]]|volume=11|issue=1|pages=47–54|year=2003|pmid=12522502|doi=10.1177/096777200301100113}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Richard |last=Schain |title=The Legend of Nietzsche's Syphilis |place=Westwood |publisher=Greenwood Press |year=2001}}.{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On returning to Basel in 1870, Nietzsche observed the establishment of the [[German Empire]] and [[Otto von Bismarck]]'s subsequent policies as an outsider and with a degree of skepticism regarding their genuineness. His inaugural lecture at the university was "[[s:Homer and Classical Philology|Homer and Classical Philology]]". Nietzsche also met [[Franz Overbeck]], a professor of theology who remained his friend throughout his life. [[Afrikan Spir]], a little-known Russian philosopher responsible for the 1873 ''Thought and Reality'', and Nietzsche's colleague the famed historian [[Jacob Burckhardt]], whose lectures Nietzsche frequently attended, began to exercise significant influence on him during this time.&lt;ref&gt;Green, M.S. ''Nietzsche and the Transcendental Tradition''. University of Illinois Press, 2002.{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nietzsche had already met [[Richard Wagner]] in Leipzig in 1868 and later Wagner's wife, [[Cosima Wagner|Cosima]]. Nietzsche admired both greatly and during his time at Basel frequently visited Wagner's house in [[Tribschen]] in [[Canton of Lucerne|Lucerne]]. The Wagners brought Nietzsche into their most intimate circle—including [[Franz Liszt]], of whom Nietzsche colloquially described: "Liszt or the art of running after women!".&lt;ref&gt;[[Rupert Hughes]], [http://www.bookrags.com/ebooks/11419/1.html#gsc.tab=0 ''The Love Affairs of Great Musicians, Volume 2''].&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche enjoyed the attention he gave to the beginning of the [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus|Bayreuth Festival]]. In 1870, he gave Cosima Wagner the manuscript of "The Genesis of the Tragic Idea" as a birthday gift. In 1872, Nietzsche published his first book, ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]''. However, his colleagues within his field, including Ritschl, expressed little enthusiasm for the work in which Nietzsche eschewed the classical philologic method in favor of a more speculative approach. In his [[polemic]] ''Philology of the Future'', [[Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff]] dampened the book's reception and increased its notoriety. In response, Rohde (then a professor in [[Kiel]]) and Wagner came to Nietzsche's defense. Nietzsche remarked freely about the isolation he felt within the philological community and attempted unsuccessfully to transfer to a position in philosophy at Basel instead.

[[File:Friedrich Nietzsche-1872.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Nietzsche, c. 1872]]
In 1873, Nietzsche began to accumulate notes that would be posthumously published as ''[[Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks]]''. Between 1873 and 1876, he published four separate long essays: "[[David Strauss]]: the Confessor and the Writer", "On the Use and Abuse of History for Life", "Schopenhauer as Educator" and "Richard Wagner in Bayreuth". These four later appeared in a collected edition under the title ''[[Untimely Meditations]]''. The essays shared the orientation of a cultural critique, challenging the developing German culture along lines suggested by Schopenhauer and Wagner. During this time in the circle of the Wagners, he met [[Malwida von Meysenbug]] and [[Hans von Bülow]]. He also began a friendship with [[Paul Rée]], who in 1876 influenced him into dismissing the pessimism in his early writings. However, he was deeply disappointed by the [[Bayreuth Festival]] of 1876, where the banality of the shows and baseness of the public repelled him. He was also alienated by Wagner's championing of "German culture", which Nietzsche felt a contradiction in terms as well as by Wagner's celebration of his fame among the German public. All this contributed to his subsequent decision to distance himself from Wagner.

With the publication in 1878 of ''[[Human, All Too Human]]'' (a book of [[aphorism]]s ranging from metaphysics to morality to religion to gender studies), a new style of Nietzsche's work became clear, highly influenced by [[Afrikan Spir]]'s ''Thought and Reality''&lt;ref&gt;Safranski, Rüdiger (trans. Shelley Frisch). ''Nietzsche: A Philosophical Biography'', p. 161. W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2003. "This work had long been consigned to oblivion, but it had a lasting impact on Nietzsche. Section 18 of ''Human, All Too Human'' cited Spir, not by name, but by presenting a 'proposition by an outstanding logician' (2,38; HH I §18)."&lt;/ref&gt; and reacting against the pessimistic philosophy of Wagner and Schopenhauer. Nietzsche's friendship with Deussen and Rohde cooled as well. In 1879, after a significant decline in health, Nietzsche had to resign his position at Basel. Since his childhood, various disruptive illnesses had plagued him, including moments of shortsightedness that left him nearly blind, [[migraine]] headaches, and violent indigestion. The 1868 riding accident and diseases in 1870 may have aggravated these persistent conditions, which continued to affect him through his years at Basel, forcing him to take longer and longer holidays until regular work became impractical.

===Independent philosopher (1879–1888)===

Living off his pension from Basel and aid from friends, Nietzsche travelled frequently to find climates more conducive to his health and lived until 1889 as an independent author in different cities. He spent many summers in [[Sils im Engadin/Segl|Sils Maria]] near [[St. Moritz]] in Switzerland. He spent his winters in the Italian cities of [[Genoa]], [[Rapallo]], and [[Turin]] and the French city of [[Nice]]. In 1881, when [[French conquest of Tunisia|France occupied Tunisia]], he planned to travel to [[Tunis]] to view Europe from the outside but later abandoned that idea, probably for health reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Stephan |last=Güntzel |url=http://www.hypernietzsche.org/navigate.php?sigle=sgunzel-4 |title=Nietzsche's Geophilosophy |page=85 |journal=Journal of Nietzsche Studies |volume=25 |place=University Park (Penn State) |date=15 October 2003 |language=English, German |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927184745/http://www.hypernietzsche.org/navigate.php?sigle=sgunzel-4 |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df= }}; republished on HyperNietzsche.&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche occasionally returned to Naumburg to visit his family, and, especially during this time, he and [[Elisabeth Forster-Nietzsche|his sister]] had repeated periods of conflict and reconciliation.

While in [[Genoa]], Nietzsche's failing eyesight prompted him to explore the use of [[typewriter]]s as a means of continuing to write. He is known to have tried using the [[Hansen Writing Ball#Sale and popular use|Hansen Writing Ball]], a contemporary typewriter device. In the end, a past student of his, [[Heinrich Köselitz]] or [[Heinrich Köselitz|Peter Gast]], became a sort of private secretary to Nietzsche. In 1876, Gast transcribed the crabbed, nearly illegible handwriting of Nietzsche for the first time with Richard Wagner in Bayreuth.{{Sfn |Cate |2005 |p=221}} He subsequently transcribed and proofread the galleys for almost all of Nietzsche's work from then on. On at least one occasion on 23 February 1880, the usually poor Gast received 200 marks from their mutual friend, Paul Rée.{{Sfn |Cate |2005 |p=297}} Gast was one of the very few friends Nietzsche allowed to criticize him. In responding most enthusiastically to ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', Gast did feel it necessary to point out that what were described as "superfluous" people were in fact quite necessary. He went on to list the number of people [[Epicurus]], for example, had to rely on even to supply his simple diet of goat cheese.{{Sfn |Cate |2005 |p=415}}

To the end of his life, Gast and Overbeck remained consistently faithful friends. [[Malwida von Meysenbug]] remained like a motherly patron even outside the Wagner circle. Soon Nietzsche made contact with the music-critic [[Carl Fuchs]]. Nietzsche stood at the beginning of his most productive period. Beginning with ''[[Human, All Too Human]]'' in 1878, Nietzsche published one book or major section of a book each year until 1888, his last year of writing; that year, he completed five.

In 1882, Nietzsche published the first part of ''[[The Gay Science]]''. That year he also met [[Lou Andreas-Salomé]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.f-nietzsche.de/lou_e.htm |contribution=Nietzsche and Lou Andreas-Salomé |title=F Nietzsche |place=DE}}&lt;/ref&gt; through Malwida von Meysenbug and [[Paul Rée]].

Salomé's mother took her to Rome when Salomé was 21. At a literary salon in the city, Salomé became acquainted with [[Paul Rée]]. Rée proposed marriage to her, but she instead proposed that they should live and study together as 'brother and sister', along with another man for company, where they would establish an academic commune.{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=149}} Rée accepted the idea, and suggested that they be joined by his friend Nietzsche. The two met Nietzsche in Rome in April 1882, and Nietzsche is believed to have instantly fallen in love with Salome, as Rée had done.  Nietzsche asked Rée to propose marriage to Salome, which she rejected. She had been interested in Nietzsche as a friend, but not as a husband.{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=149}} Nietzsche nonetheless was content to join together with Rée and Salome touring through Switzerland and Italy together, planning their commune.  The three traveled with Salomé's mother through Italy and considered where they would set up their "Winterplan" commune.   This commune was intended to be set up in an abandoned monastery, but no suitable location was found.  On 13 May, in Lucerne, when Nietzsche was alone with Salome, he earnestly proposed marriage to her again, which she rejected. He nonetheless was happy to continue with the plans for an academic commune.
.{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=149}} After discovering the situation, Nietzsche's sister Elizabeth became determined to get Nietzsche away from the "immoral woman".{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=151}} 
Nietzsche and Salomé spent the summer together in [[Tautenburg]] in Thuringia, often with Nietzsche's sister Elisabeth as a chaperone. Salomé reports that he asked her to marry him on three separate occasions and that she refused, though the reliability of her reports of events has come into question.{{Sfn |Kaufmann |1974 |p=49}} Arriving in [[Leipzig]], (Germany) in October, Salomé and Rée separated from Nietzsche after a falling-out between Nietzsche and Salomé, in which Salomé believed that Nietzsche was desperately in love with her.

While the three spent a number of weeks together in Leipzig in October 1882, the following month Rée and Salome ditched Nietzsche, leaving for Stibbe without any plans to meet again. Nietzsche soon fell into a period of mental anguish, although he continued to write to Rée, stating "We shall see one another from time to time, won't we?"{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=152}} In later recriminations, Nietzsche would blame on separate occasions the failure in his attempts to woo Salome both on Salome, Rée, and on the intrigues of his sister (who had written letters to the family of Salome and Rée to disrupt the plans for the commune). Nietzsche wrote of the affair in 1883, that he now felt "genuine hatred for my sister."{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=152}}

Amidst renewed bouts of illness, living in near-isolation after a falling out with his mother and sister regarding Salomé, Nietzsche fled to Rapallo, where he wrote the first part of ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'' in only ten days.

[[File:Nietzsche1882.jpg|thumb|Photo of Nietzsche by {{ill|Gustav Adolf Schultze|de}}, 1882]]
By 1882, Nietzsche was taking huge doses of [[opium]], but he was still having trouble sleeping.{{Sfn |Cate |2005 |p=389}} In 1883, while staying in Nice, he was writing out his own prescriptions for the sedative [[chloral hydrate]], signing them "Dr. Nietzsche".{{Sfn |Cate |2005 |p=453}}

After severing his philosophical ties with [[Schopenhauer]] (who was long dead and never met Nietzsche) and his social ties with Wagner, Nietzsche had few remaining friends. Now, with the new style of ''Zarathustra'', his work became even more alienating, and the market received it only to the degree required by politeness. Nietzsche recognized this and maintained his solitude, though he often complained about it. His books remained largely unsold. In 1885, he printed only 40 copies of the fourth part of ''Zarathustra'' and distributed only a fraction of these among close friends, including [[Helene von Druskowitz]].

In 1883, he tried and failed to obtain a lecturing post at the [[University of Leipzig]]. It was made clear to him that, in view of his attitude towards Christianity and his concept of God, he had become effectively unemployable by any German university. The subsequent "feelings of revenge and resentment" embittered him: "And hence my rage since I have grasped in the broadest possible sense what wretched means (the depreciation of my good name, my character, and my aims) ''suffice'' to take from me the trust of, and therewith the possibility of obtaining, pupils."&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, Friedrich. [[s:Selected Letters of Friedrich Nietzsche#Nietzsche To Peter Gast – August 1883 2|Letter to Peter Gast]]. August 1883.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1886, Nietzsche broke with his publisher Ernst Schmeitzner, disgusted by his antisemitic opinions. Nietzsche saw his own writings as "completely buried and unexhumeable in this anti-Semitic dump" of Schmeitzner—associating the publisher with a movement that should be "utterly rejected with cold contempt by every sensible mind".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenietzschechannel.com/correspondence/corresp.htm#schmei |title=Correspondences |publisher=Thenietzschechannel.com |date=1 February 2000 |accessdate=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then printed ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'' at his own expense. He also acquired the publication rights for his earlier works and over the next year issued second editions of ''The Birth of Tragedy'', ''[[Human, All Too Human]]'', ''[[The Dawn (book)|Daybreak]]'', and ''[[The Gay Science]]'' with new prefaces placing the body of his work in a more coherent perspective. Thereafter, he saw his work as completed for a time and hoped that soon a readership would develop. In fact, interest in Nietzsche's thought did increase at this time, if rather slowly and hardly perceptibly to him. During these years Nietzsche met [[Meta von Salis]], [[Carl Spitteler]], and [[Gottfried Keller]].

In 1886, his sister Elisabeth married the [[Antisemitism|antisemite]] [[Bernhard Förster]] and travelled to Paraguay to found [[Nueva Germania]], a "Germanic" colony—a plan Nietzsche responded to with mocking laughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title= |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |edition=online |contribution=Förster-Nietzsche, Elisabeth |url=http://www.search.eb.com.librarypx.lclark.edu/eb/article-9034925 |date=10 October 2008 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=October 2015}} Through correspondence, Nietzsche's relationship with Elisabeth continued through cycles of conflict and reconciliation, but they met again only after his collapse. He continued to have frequent and painful attacks of illness, which made prolonged work impossible.

In 1887, Nietzsche wrote the polemic ''[[On the Genealogy of Morality]]''. During the same year, he encountered the work of [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], to whom he felt an immediate kinship.&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, Friedrich. [[s:Selected Letters of Friedrich Nietzsche#Nietzsche To Peter Gast – March, 1887|Letter to Peter Gast]]. March 1887.&lt;/ref&gt; He also exchanged letters with [[Hippolyte Taine]] and [[Georg Brandes]]. Brandes, who had started to teach the philosophy of [[Søren Kierkegaard]] in the 1870s, wrote to Nietzsche asking him to [[Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche#Relation to Søren Kierkegaard|read Kierkegaard]], to which Nietzsche replied that he would come to [[Copenhagen]] and read Kierkegaard with him. However, before fulfilling this promise, he slipped too far into illness. In the beginning of 1888, Brandes delivered in Copenhagen one of the first lectures on Nietzsche's philosophy.

Although Nietzsche had previously announced at the end of ''[[On the Genealogy of Morality]]'' a new work with the title ''[[The Will to Power (manuscript)|The Will to Power]]: Attempt at a [[transvaluation of values|Revaluation of All Values]]'', he eventually seems to have abandoned this idea and instead used some of the draft passages to compose ''[[Twilight of the Idols]]'' and ''[[The Antichrist (book)|The Antichrist]]'' in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Mazzino |last=Montinari |title=Friedrich Nietzsche |year=1974}} translated as {{Citation |language=German |year=1991 |title=Friedrich Nietzsche. Eine Einführung |place=Berlin-New York |publisher=De Gruyter}}; and {{Citation |language=French |title=Friedrich Nietzsche |publisher=[[PUF]] |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His health seemed to improve and he spent the summer in high spirits. In the fall of 1888, his writings and letters began to reveal a higher estimation of his own status and "fate". He overestimated the increasing response to his writings, however, especially to the recent polemic, ''[[The Case of Wagner]]''. On his 44th birthday, after completing ''[[Twilight of the Idols]]'' and ''[[The Antichrist (book)|The Antichrist]]'', he decided to write the autobiography ''[[Ecce Homo (book)|Ecce Homo]]''. In its preface—which suggests Nietzsche was well aware of the interpretive difficulties his work would generate—he declares, "Hear me! For I am such and such a person. Above all, do not mistake me for someone else."{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1888d |loc=Preface, section 1}} In December, Nietzsche began a correspondence with [[August Strindberg]] and thought that, short of an international breakthrough, he would attempt to buy back his older writings from the publisher and have them translated into other European languages. Moreover, he planned the publication of the compilation ''[[Nietzsche contra Wagner]]'' and of the poems that made up his collection ''[[Dionysian-Dithyrambs]]''.

===Psychological illness and death (1889–1900)===

[[File:NietzscheHouseTurin.jpg|thumb|left|[[Turin]] house where Nietzsche stayed (background) seen from Piazza Carlo Alberto, where he is said to have had his breakdown (at left: rear façade of [[Palazzo Carignano]])]]
On 3 January 1889, Nietzsche suffered a [[mental breakdown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Magnus|editor1-first=Bernd|editor2-last=Higgins|editor2-first=Kathleen Marie|title=The Cambridge Companion to Nietzsche|date=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521367677|pages=79–81|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Xeb80itrlRIC|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two policemen approached him after he caused a public disturbance in the streets of [[Turin]]. What happened remains unknown, but an often-repeated tale from shortly after his death states that Nietzsche witnessed the flogging of a horse at the other end of the Piazza Carlo Alberto, ran to the horse, threw his arms up around its neck to protect it, and then collapsed to the ground.{{Sfn |Kaufmann |1974 |p=67}}&lt;ref&gt;Anacleto Verrecchia, "Nietzsche's Breakdown in Turin," in ''Nietzsche in Italy'', ed. Thomas Harrison (Stanford University: ANMA Libri, 1988) 105–12&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following few days, Nietzsche sent short writings—known as the ''Wahnzettel'' ("Madness Letters")—to a number of friends including [[Cosima Wagner]] and [[Jacob Burckhardt]]. Most of them were signed "[[Dionysos]]", though some were also signed "der Gekreuzigte" meaning "the crucified one". To his former colleague Burckhardt, Nietzsche wrote: "I have had [[Caiaphas]] put in [[fetters]]. Also, last year I was crucified by the German doctors in a very drawn-out manner. Wilhelm, [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]], and all anti-Semites abolished."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Simon |first=Gerald |url=http://www.thenietzschechannel.com/correspondence/ger/nilettersg.htm |publisher=The Nietzsche Channel |title=Nietzsches Briefe.

Wilhelm, Bismarck und alle Antisemiten abgeschafft."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, he commanded the German emperor to go to Rome to be shot and summoned the European powers to take military action against Germany,&lt;ref&gt;[[Stefan Zweig|Zweig, Stefan]] (1939), ''Master Builders [trilogy], The Struggle with the Daimon'', Viking Press, p. 524.&lt;/ref&gt; that the pope should be put in jail and that he, Nietzsche, created the world and was in the process of having all anti-Semites shot dead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenietzschechannel.com/correspondence/ger/nlett1889g.htm Nietzsches Briefe, Ausgewählte Korrespondenz, Wahnzettel 1889].&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 January 1889, Burckhardt showed the letter he had received from Nietzsche to Overbeck. The following day, Overbeck received a similar letter and decided that Nietzsche's friends had to bring him back to Basel. Overbeck travelled to Turin and brought Nietzsche to a psychiatric clinic in Basel. By that time Nietzsche appeared fully in the grip of a serious mental illness, and his mother Franziska decided to transfer him to a clinic in [[Jena]] under the direction of [[Otto Binswanger]]. In January 1889, they proceeded with the planned release of ''[[Twilight of the Idols]]'', by that time already printed and bound. From November 1889 to February 1890, the art historian [[Julius Langbehn]] attempted to cure Nietzsche, claiming that the methods of the medical doctors were ineffective in treating Nietzsche's condition. Langbehn assumed progressively greater control of Nietzsche until his secretiveness discredited him. In March 1890, Franziska removed Nietzsche from the clinic and, in May 1890, brought him to her home in Naumburg. During this process Overbeck and Gast contemplated what to do with Nietzsche's unpublished works. In February, they ordered a fifty-copy private edition of ''[[Nietzsche contra Wagner]]'', but the publisher [[C. G. Naumann]] secretly printed one hundred. Overbeck and Gast decided to withhold publishing ''The Antichrist'' and ''[[Ecce Homo (book)|Ecce Homo]]'' because of their more radical content. Nietzsche's reception and recognition enjoyed their first surge.{{Chronology citation needed|date=August 2014}}

In 1893, Nietzsche's sister Elisabeth returned from [[Nueva Germania]] in Paraguay following the suicide of her husband. She read and studied Nietzsche's works and, piece by piece, took control of them and their publication. Overbeck eventually suffered dismissal and Gast finally co-operated. After the death of Franziska in 1897, Nietzsche lived in [[Weimar]], where Elisabeth cared for him and allowed visitors, including [[Rudolf Steiner]] (who in 1895 had written one of the first books praising Nietzsche),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Rudolf |last=Steiner |title=Friedrich Nietzsche, ein Kämpfer gegen seine Zeit |place=Weimar |year=1895}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp |needed=yes|date=April 2012}} to meet her uncommunicative brother. Elisabeth at one point went so far as to employ Steiner as a tutor to help her to understand her brother's philosophy. Steiner abandoned the attempt after only a few months, declaring that it was impossible to teach her anything about philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Andrew |last=Bailey |title=First Philosophy: Fundamental Problems and Readings in Philosophy |publisher=Broadview Press |year=2002 |page=704}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eh-dm-27.JPG|thumb|[[Heinrich Köselitz|Peter Gast]] "corrected" Nietzsche's writings after the breakdown without his approval]]
Nietzsche's mental illness was originally diagnosed as [[Syphilis#Tertiary|tertiary syphilis]], in accordance with a prevailing medical paradigm of the time. Although most commentators regard his breakdown as unrelated to his philosophy, [[Georges Bataille]] dropped dark hints ("'Man incarnate' must also go mad")&lt;ref&gt;Bataille, Georges (translated by Annette Michelson), "Writings on Laughter, Sacrifice, Nietzsche, Un-Knowing,"  Special issue, ''[[October (journal)|October]]'' no. 36, Spring 1986, pp. 42–45.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[René Girard]]'s postmortem psychoanalysis posits a worshipful rivalry with [[Richard Wagner]].&lt;ref&gt;René Girard, "Superman in the Underground: Strategies of Madness—Nietzsche, Wagner, and Dostoevsky", ''MLN'', Vol. 91, No. 6, ''Comparative Literature''. (December 1976), pp. 1161–85.&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche had previously written, "All superior men who were irresistibly drawn to throw off the yoke of any kind of morality and to frame new laws had, if they were not actually mad, no alternative but to make themselves or pretend to be mad." (Daybreak, 14) The diagnosis of syphilis has since been challenged and a diagnosis of "[[bipolar disorder|manic-depressive illness]] with periodic [[psychosis]] followed by [[vascular dementia]]" was put forward by Cybulska prior to Schain's study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cybulska |first=EM |title=The madness of Nietzsche: a misdiagnosis of the millennium? |journal=Hospital Medicine |volume=61 |issue=8 |pages=571–75 |date=August 2000 |pmid=11045229 |doi=10.12968/hosp.2000.61.8.1403}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Schain |first=Richard |title=The Legend of Nietzsche's Syphilis |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-313-31940-2}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leonard Sax]] suggested the slow growth of a right-sided retro-orbital [[meningioma]] as an explanation of Nietzsche's dementia;&lt;ref name=matthews/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Sax, "What was the cause of Nietzsche's dementia?"

In 1898 and 1899, Nietzsche suffered at least two strokes. This partially paralyzed him, leaving him unable to speak or walk. He likely suffered from clinical [[hemiparesis]]/hemiplegia on the left side of his body by 1899. After contracting [[pneumonia]] in mid-August 1900, he had another stroke during the night of 24–25 August and died at about noon on 25 August.&lt;ref&gt;Concurring reports in Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche's biography (1904) and a letter by Mathilde Schenk-Nietzsche to [[Meta von Salis]], 30 August 1900, quoted in Janz (1981) p. 221.

[[Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche]] compiled ''[[The Will to Power (manuscript)|The Will to Power]]'' from Nietzsche's unpublished notebooks and published it posthumously. Because his sister arranged the book based on her own conflation of several of Nietzsche's early outlines and took great liberties with the material, the scholarly consensus has been that it does not reflect Nietzsche's intent. (For example, Elisabeth removed aphorism 35 of ''The Antichrist'', where Nietzsche rewrote a passage of the Bible.) Indeed, [[Mazzino Montinari]], the editor of Nietzsche's ''[[Nachlass]]'', called it a forgery.&lt;ref&gt;Montinari, Mazzino. ''The 'Will to Power' Does Not Exist''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Citizenship, nationality and ethnicity===

In Herbarz Polski, a genealogy of Polish nobility, he had come across a note about a family named 'Nicki', who could be traced back to Radwan. A member of this family named Gotard Nietzsche had left Poland for Prussia, and his descendants had eventually settled in Saxony around the year 1700.''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche wrote in 1888, "My ancestors were Polish noblemen (Nietzky); the type seems to have been well preserved despite three generations of German mothers."{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=6}} At one point, Nietzsche becomes even more adamant about his Polish identity. "I am a pure-blooded Polish nobleman, without a single drop of bad blood, certainly not German blood."&lt;ref&gt;Fredrick Appel Cornell, ''Nietzsche Contra Democracy''. University Press (1998), p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; On yet another occasion, Nietzsche stated, "Germany is a great nation only because its people have so much Polish blood in their veins ... I am proud of my Polish descent."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Henry Louis |last=Mencken |title=The Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche |origyear=1908 |publisher=University of Michigan |year=2006 |page=6 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=nnEOAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=Nietzsche+Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche believed his name might have been [[Germanized]], in one letter claiming, "I was taught to ascribe the origin of my blood and name to Polish noblemen who were called Niëtzky and left their home and nobleness about a hundred years ago, finally yielding to unbearable suppression: they were [[Protestants]]."&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Heinrich von Stein, December 1882, ''KGB'' III 1, Nr. 342, p. 287; ''KGW'' V 2, p. 579; ''KSA'' 9 p. 681&lt;/ref&gt;

Most scholars dispute Nietzsche's account of his family's origins. Hans von Müller debunked the genealogy put forward by Nietzsche's sister in favor of a Polish noble heritage.&lt;ref&gt;von Müller, "Nietzsches Vorfahren", reprinted ''Nietzsche-Studien'' 31 (2002): 253–75.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Oehler]], the curator of the [[Nietzsche Archive]] at [[Weimar]], argued that all of Nietzsche's ancestors bore German names, including the wives' families.{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=6}} Oehler claims that Nietzsche came from a long line of German [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] clergymen on both sides of his family, and modern scholars regard the claim of Nietzsche's Polish ancestry as a "pure invention".&lt;ref name=mencken&gt;{{Citation |first=Henry Louis |last=Mencken |title=The Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzche |others=introd. &amp; comm.

The name derives from the forename ''Nikolaus'', abbreviated to ''Nick''; assimilated with the Slavic ''Nitz'', it first became ''Nitsche'' and then ''Nietzsche''.{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=6}}

It is not known why Nietzsche wanted to be thought of as Polish nobility. According to biographer [[R. J. Hollingdale]], Nietzsche's propagation of the Polish ancestry myth may have been part of his "campaign against Germany".{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=6}}

===Relationships and sexuality===
Nietzsche never married. He proposed to [[Lou Andreas-Salomé|Lou Salomé]] three times, but his proposal was rejected each time.&lt;ref&gt;
"Nietzsche's and Nietzsche and Lou Andreas-Salomé." Nietzsche's and Nietzsche and Lou Andreas-Salomé.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=June 2017}} There is a theory that blamed Salomé's view on sexuality as one of the reasons for her alienation from Nietzsche. As articulated in the 1898 [[novella]] ''Fenitschka'', she viewed the idea of sexual intercourse as prohibitive and marriage as a violation, with some suggesting that they indicated [[sexual repression]] and [[neurosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nietzsche's Women: Beyond the Whip|last=Diethe|first=Carol|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=1996|isbn=978-3110148190|location=Berlin|pages=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nietzsche scholar {{ill|Joachim Köhler|de|Joachim Köhler (Philosoph)}} has attempted to explain Nietzsche's life history and philosophy by claiming that Nietzsche was homosexual. Köhler argues that Nietzsche's syphilis, which is "...usually considered to be the product of his encounter with a prostitute in a brothel in [[Cologne]] or [[Leipzig]], is equally likely, it is now held, to have been contracted in a male brothel in [[Genoa]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Köhler |first=Joachim |title=Zarathustra's secret: the interior life of Friedrich Nietzsche |year=2002 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=978-0-300-09278-3 |page=xv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The acquisition of the infection from a homosexual brothel was confirmed by [[Sigmund Freud]], who cited Otto Binswanger as his source.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nietzsche and Jewish Culture|last=Golomb|first=Jacob|publisher=Routledge|year=2001|isbn=978-0415095129|location=London|pages=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; Köhler also suggests Nietzsche may have had a romantic relationship as well as a friendship with [[Paul Rée]].&lt;ref name="Megill" /&gt; There is the claim that Nietzsche's homosexuality is widely known in the [[Vienna Psychoanalytic Society]], with Nietzsche's friend [[Paul Deussen]] claiming that the philosopher never "touched a woman".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Young Nietzsche: Becoming a Genius|last=Pletsch|first=Carl|publisher=The Free Press|year=1992|isbn=978-0029250426|location=New York|pages=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nietzsche and Rée: A Star Friendship|last=Small|first=Robin|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=2007|isbn=9780199278077|location=Oxford|pages=207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Köhler's views have not found wide acceptance among Nietzsche scholars and commentators. Allan Megill argues that, while Köhler's claim that Nietzsche was in a confrontation with his homosexual desire cannot simply be dismissed, "the evidence is very weak," and Köhler may be projecting twentieth-century understandings of sexuality on nineteenth-century notions of friendship.&lt;ref name="Megill"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Allan Megill | year = 1996 | title = Historicizing Nietzsche?

Because of Nietzsche's [[evocative]] style and provocative ideas, his philosophy generates passionate reactions. His works remain controversial, due to their varying interpretations and misinterpretations. In the Western philosophy tradition, Nietzsche's writings have been described as the unique case of free revolutionary thought, that is, revolutionary in its structure and problems, although not tied to any revolutionary project.&lt;ref name="Bennett2001"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Benjamin Bennett |title=Goethe As Woman: The Undoing of Literature |url=https://books.google.com/?id=AVYbszVKUO4C&amp;pg=PA184 |accessdate=3 January 2013 |year=2001 |publisher=Wayne State University Press |isbn=978-0-8143-2948-1 |page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; His writings have also been described as a revolutionary project in which his philosophy serves as the foundation of a European cultural rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Friedrich Nietzsche: A Philosophical Biography|last=Young|first=Julian|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Friedrich Nietzsche: Herald of a New Era|last=Bowman|first=William|publisher=Hazar Press|year=2016|isbn=978-0997570304|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apollonian and Dionysian===
{{Main|Apollonian and Dionysian}}
The ''Apollonian and Dionysian'' is a two-fold philosophical concept, based on certain features of ancient Greek mythology: [[Apollo]] and [[Dionysus]]. Even though the concept is famously related to ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]'', the poet [[Friedrich Hölderlin|Hölderlin]] had already spoken of it, and [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann|Winckelmann]] had talked of [[Dionysus|Bacchus]]. One year before the publication of ''The Birth of Tragedy'', Nietzsche wrote a fragment titled "On Music and Words".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://nietzsche.holtof.com/Nietzsche_various/on_music_and_words_and_rhetoric.htm |title=On Music and words}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it he asserted the [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauerian]] judgment that music is a primary expression of the essence of everything. Secondarily derivative are [[Lyric poetry|lyrical poetry]] and drama, which represent mere [[Phenomenon|phenomenal]] appearances of objects. In this way, [[tragedy]] is born from music.

Nietzsche found in classical Athenian tragedy an art form that [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcended]] the pessimism found in the so-called [[Silenus#The wisdom of Silenus|wisdom of Silenus]]. The Greek spectators, by looking into the abyss of human suffering depicted by characters on stage, passionately and joyously affirmed life, finding it worth living. A main theme in ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]'' was that the fusion of Dionysian and Apollonian ''Kunsttrieben'' ("artistic impulses") forms dramatic arts, or tragedies. He goes on to argue that this fusion has not been achieved since the ancient Greek [[tragedians]]. Apollo represents harmony, progress, clarity and logic, whereas Dionysus represents disorder, intoxication, emotion and ecstasy. Nietzsche used these two forces because, for him, the world of mind and order on one side, and passion and chaos on the other formed principles that were fundamental to the [[Culture of Greece|Greek culture]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.historyguide.org/europe/dio_apollo.html |title=Nietzsche, Dionysus and Apollo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=iP4sA3kwcFsC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=Jim+Morrison+Apollonian+and+Dionysian |title=Ideas About Art|isbn=9781444396003|author1=Desmond|first1=Kathleen K|date=16 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Apollonian side being a dreaming state, full of illusions; and Dionysian being the state of intoxication, representing the liberations of instinct and dissolution of boundaries. In this mold, man appears as the [[satyr]]. He is the horror of the annihilation of the principle of [[individuation|individuality]] and at the same time someone who delights in its destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.bachelorandmaster.com/creationofknowledge/apollonianism-dyonysianisism.html |title=The Apollonianism and Dionysiansism by Friedrich Nietzsche}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these principles are meant to represent [[Cognition|cognitive]] states that appear through art as the power of nature in man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.primordialtraditions.net/prime/Library/DionysusinNietzscheandGreekMyth.aspx |title=Dionysus in Nietzsche and Greek Myth |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120814164705/http://www.primordialtraditions.net/prime/Library/DionysusinNietzscheandGreekMyth.aspx |archive-date=14 August 2012 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between the Apollonian and Dionysian juxtapositions is apparent, in the interplay of tragedy: the tragic hero of the drama, the main protagonist, struggles to make order (in the Apollonian sense) of his unjust and chaotic (Dionysian) fate, though he dies unfulfilled in the end. Elaborating on the conception of [[Hamlet]] as an intellectual who cannot make up his mind, and therefore is a living [[antithesis]] to the man of action, Nietzsche argues that a Dionysian figure possesses knowledge to realize that his actions cannot change the eternal balance of things, and it disgusts him enough not to be able to make any act at all. Hamlet falls under this category—he has glimpsed the supernatural reality through the Ghost, he has gained true knowledge and knows that no action of his has the power to change this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://issuu.com/mcc1289/docs/hamlet-and-nietzsche |title=Procrastination in Shakespeare's Hamlet}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://geoffklock.blogspot.com/2006/11/nietzsche-on-hamlet-commonplace-book.html |title=Nietzsche on Hamlet (Commonplace Book)|date=2006-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the audience of such drama, this tragedy allows them to sense an underlying essence, what Nietzsche called the ''Primordial Unity'', which revives Dionysian nature. He describes this primordial unity as the increase of strength, experience of fullness and plenitude bestowed by [[wikt:frenzy#Noun|frenzy]]. Frenzy acts as an intoxication, and is crucial for the [[Physiology|physiological]] condition that enables making of any art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://jorbon.tripod.com/niet01.html |title=The role of art in Nietzsche's philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stimulated by this state, a person's artistic will is enhanced:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In this state one enriches everything out of one's own fullness: whatever one sees, whatever wills is seen swelled, taut, strong, overloaded with strength. A man in this state transforms things until they mirror his power—until they are reflections of his perfection. This having to transform into perfection is—art.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nietzsche is adamant that the works of [[Aeschylus]] and [[Sophocles]] represent the apex of artistic creation, the true realization of tragedy; it is with [[Euripides]], he states, that tragedy begins its ''Untergang'' (literally "going under" or "downward-way," meaning decline, deterioration, downfall, death, etc.). Nietzsche objects to Euripides' use of [[Socratic method|Socratic rationalism]] and [[morality]] in his tragedies, claiming that the infusion of [[ethics]] and [[reason]] robs tragedy of its foundation, namely the fragile balance of the Dionysian and Apollonian. [[Socrates]] emphasized reason to such a degree that he diffused the value of [[myth]] and suffering to human knowledge. [[Plato]] continued with this path in his dialogues, and the modern world eventually inherited reason at the expense of artistic impulses that could be found only in the Apollonian and Dionysus dichotomy. This leads to his conclusion that European culture from the time of Socrates had always been only Apollonian and thus [[decadence|decadent]] and unhealthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.carnaval.com/prophecy/ |title=Dionysus versus Apollo}}&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that whenever Apollonian culture dominates, the Dionysian lacks the structure to make a coherent art, and when Dionysian dominates, the Apollonian lacks the necessary passion. Only the beautiful middle, the interplay of these two forces, brought together as an art, represented real Greek tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/nietzsche/section1.html |title=The Birth of Tragedy Summary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the impact of this idea can be seen in the book ''Patterns of Culture'', where [[anthropologist]] [[Ruth Benedict]] uses Nietzschean opposites of "Apollonian" and "Dionysian" as the stimulus for her thoughts about [[Native American culture]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://classes.yale.edu/03-04/anth500b/projects/project_sites/02_alexy/ruthpatterns.html |first=Ruth |last=Benedict |title=Patterns of Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Jung]] has written extensively on the dichotomy in ''[[Psychological Types]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://pkdreligion.blogspot.com/2011/11/influence-of-cg-jung-on-pkd-by-frank.html |title=Influence of C.G.

Here Foucault references Nietzsche's description of the birth and death of tragedy and his explanation that the subsequent tragedy of the Western world was the refusal of the tragic and, with that, refusal of the sacred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=4aNoFpNfYeMC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=foucault+genealogy |title=Foucault's Nietzschean Genealogy|isbn=9780791411490|author1=Mahon|first1=Michael|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Painter [[Mark Rothko]] was influenced by Nietzsche's view of tragedy, which were presented in ''The Birth of Tragedy.''

===Perspectivism===
{{Main|Perspectivism}}

Nietzsche claimed the death of God would eventually lead to the loss of any universal perspective on things, and along with it any coherent sense of [[objective truth]].{{Sfn |Lampert |1986 |pp=17–18}}{{Sfn |Heidegger}}{{Rp |needed=yes |date=March 2012}} Nietzsche himself rejected the idea of objective reality, arguing that knowledge is [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] and conditional, relative to various fluid perspectives or interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=TxlMccAak4wC&amp;q=Objective |title=Nietzsche: Naturalism and Interpretation |first=Cox |last=Cristoph|isbn=9780520921603 |year=1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to constant reassessment of rules (i.e., those of philosophy, the scientific method, etc.) according to the circumstances of individual perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;Schacht, Richard, ''Nietzsche'', 1983, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; This view has acquired the name ''[[perspectivism]]''.

In ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', Nietzsche proclaims that a table of values hangs above every great person. He points out that what is common among different peoples is the act of esteeming, of creating values, even if the values are different from one people to the next. Nietzsche asserts that what made people great was not the content of their beliefs, but the act of valuing. Thus the values a community strives to articulate are not as important as the collective will to see those values come to pass. The willing is more essential than the intrinsic worth of the goal itself, according to Nietzsche. "A thousand goals have there been so far," says Zarathustra, "for there are a thousand peoples. Only the yoke for the thousand necks is still lacking: the one goal is lacking. Humanity still has no goal." Hence, the title of the aphorism, "On The Thousand And One Goals". The idea that one value-system is no more worthy than the next, although it may not be directly ascribed to Nietzsche, has become a common premise in modern social science. [[Max Weber]] and [[Martin Heidegger]] absorbed it and made it their own. It shaped their philosophical and cultural endeavor, as well as their political understanding. Weber, for example, relies on Nietzsche's perspectivism by maintaining that objectivity is still possible—but only after a particular perspective, value, or end has been established.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.criticism.com/md/weber1.html |title=Max Weber's View of Objectivity in Social Science |first=Hoenisch |last=Steve}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://socialsciences.scielo.org/scielo.php?pid=S1518-44712006000200006&amp;script=sci_arttext |title=Culture and perspectivism in Nietzsche's and Weber's view|journal=Teoria &amp; Sociedade|volume=2|issue=SE|pages=0|date=00/2006|last1=Nobre|first1=Renarde Freire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among his critique of traditional philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[René Descartes|Descartes]] and [[Plato]] in ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'', Nietzsche attacked ''[[thing in itself]]'' and ''[[cogito ergo sum]]'' ("I think, therefore I am") as [[Falsifiability|unfalsifiable]] beliefs based on naive acceptance of previous notions and [[fallacy|fallacies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.monomorphic.org/wordpress/objective-and-subjective-reality-perspectivism/ |title=Objective and subjective reality; perspectivism|date=2011-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] puts Nietzsche in a high place in the history of philosophy. While criticizing nihilism and Nietzsche together as a sign of general decay,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=3JA3vyj4slsC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;dq=Alasdair+MacIntyre+Nietzsche+Kant |title=From Hegel to Existentialism|isbn=9780195061826|author1=Solomon|first1=Robert C|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; he still commends him for recognizing psychological motives behind Kant and [[David Hume|Hume]]'s moral philosophy:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=TN7sop-yILMC&amp;pg=PA136&amp;dq=Alasdair+MacIntyre+Nietzsche+Kant |title=Alasdair MacIntyre|isbn=9780521793810|author1=Murphy|first1=Mark C|date=23 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;For it was Nietzsche's historic achievement to understand more clearly than any other philosopher...not only that what purported to be appeals of [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]] were in fact expressions of subjective will, but also the nature of the problems that this posed for philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Z9RaG9ccs44C&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=Alasdair+MacIntyre+Nietzsche+Kant |title=Tradition in the ethics of Alasdair MacIntyre|isbn=9780739141489|author1=Lutz|first1=Christopher Stephen|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The "slave revolt" in morals===
{{Main|Master–slave morality}}
{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2017}}&lt;!--4 paragraphs have no citations--&gt;
In ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'' and ''[[On the Genealogy of Morality]]'', Nietzsche's [[Genealogy (philosophy)|genealogical]] account of the development of modern moral systems occupies a central place. For Nietzsche, a fundamental shift took place during human history from thinking in terms of ''good and bad'' toward ''good and evil''.

The initial form of morality was set by a warrior [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]] and other ruling castes of ancient civilizations. Aristocratic values of good and bad coincided with and reflected their relationship to lower [[caste]]s such as slaves. Nietzsche presents this "master morality" as the original system of morality—perhaps best associated with [[Homer]]ic Greece. To be "good" was to be happy and to have the things related to happiness: wealth, strength, health, power, etc. To be "bad" was to be like the slaves the aristocracy ruled over: poor, weak, sick, pathetic—an object of pity or disgust rather than hatred.

"Slave morality" comes about as a reaction to master-morality. Here, value emerges from the contrast between good and evil: good being associated with other-worldliness, charity, piety, restraint, meekness, and submission; and evil seen as worldly, cruel, selfish, wealthy, and aggressive. Nietzsche sees slave morality as pessimistic and fearful, values for them serving only to ease the existence for those who suffer from the very same thing. He associates slave-morality with the Jewish and Christian traditions, in a way that slave-morality is born out of the [[ressentiment]] of slaves. Nietzsche argued that the idea of equality allowed slaves to overcome their own condition without hating themselves. And by denying the inherent inequality of people (such as success, strength, beauty or intelligence), slaves acquired a method of escape, namely by generating new values on the basis of rejecting something that was seen as a perceived source of frustration. It was used to overcome the slave's own sense of inferiority before the (better-off) masters. It does so by making out slave weakness to be a matter of choice, by, e.g., relabeling it as "meekness". The "good man" of master morality is precisely the "evil man" of slave morality, while the "bad man" is recast as the "good man".

Nietzsche sees the slave-morality as a source of the nihilism that has overtaken Europe. Modern Europe and Christianity exist in a hypocritical state due to a tension between master and slave morality, both values contradictorily determining, to varying degrees, the values of most Europeans (who are "[[motley]]"). Nietzsche calls for exceptional people to no longer be ashamed of their uniqueness in the face of a supposed morality-for-all, which he deems to be harmful to the flourishing of exceptional people. He cautions, however, that morality, per se, is not bad; it is good for the masses, and should be left to them. Exceptional people, on the other hand, should follow their own "inner law". A favorite motto of Nietzsche, taken from [[Pindar]], reads: "Become what you are."

A long standing assumption about Nietzsche is that he preferred master over slave morality. However, the Nietzsche scholar [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] rejected this interpretation, writing that Nietzsche's analyses of these two types of morality were only used in a [[descriptive ethics|descriptive]] and historic sense, they were not meant for any kind of acceptance or glorifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=wvKRUSdUsnkC&amp;pg=PA213&amp;dq=Master+slave+morality |title=From Shakespeare to existentialism|isbn=978-0691013671|author1=Kaufmann|first1=Walter Arnold|year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, it is clear from his own writings that Nietzsche wanted the victory of master morality. He linked the "salvation and future of the human race with the unconditional dominance"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the Genealogy of Morals|last=Nietzsche|first=Friedrich|publisher=|year=1887|isbn=|location=|pages=First essay, section 16}}&lt;/ref&gt; of master morality and called master morality "a higher order of values, the noble ones, those that say Yes to life, those that guarantee the future."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ecce Homo|last=Nietzsche|first=Friedrich|publisher=|year=1908|isbn=|location=|pages=Chapter on The Case of Wagner, section 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just as "there is an order of rank between man and man," there is also an order of rank "between morality and morality."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beyond Good and Evil|last=Nietzsche|first=Friedrich|publisher=|year=1886|isbn=|location=|pages=Section 228}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Nietzsche waged a philosophic war against the slave morality of Christianity in his "revaluation of all values" in order to bring about the victory of a new master morality that he called the "philosophy of the future" (''Beyond Good and Evil'' is subtitled ''Prelude to a Philosophy of the Future'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Friedrich Nietzsche: Herald of a New Era|last=Bowman|first=William|publisher=Hazar Press|year=2016|isbn=978-0997570304|location=|pages=31–38, 60–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Dawn (book)|Daybreak]]'', Nietzsche begins his "Campaign against Morality".{{Sfn |Kaufmann |1974 |p=187}}{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1888d |loc=M I}} He calls himself an "immoralist" and harshly criticizes the prominent moral philosophies of his day: Christianity, [[Kantianism]], and [[utilitarianism]]. Nietzsche's concept "[[God is dead]]" applies to the doctrines of Christendom, though not to all other faiths: he claimed that [[Buddhism]] is a successful religion that he compliments for fostering critical thought.{{Sfn |Sedgwick |2009 |p=26}} Still, Nietzsche saw his philosophy as a counter-movement to nihilism through appreciation of art:

{{quote|text=Art as the single superior counterforce against all will to negation of life, art as the anti-Christian, anti-Buddhist, anti-Nihilist par excellence."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://jorbon.tripod.com/niet01.html |title=Art in Nietzsche's philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Nietzsche claimed that the Christian faith as practised was not a proper representation of Jesus' teachings, as it forced people merely to believe in the way of Jesus but not to act as Jesus did, in particular his example of refusing to judge people, something that Christians had constantly done the opposite of.{{Sfn |Sedgwick |2009 |p=26}} He condemned institutionalized Christianity for emphasizing a morality of [[pity]] (''Mitleid''), which assumes an inherent illness in society:{{Sfn |Sedgwick |2009 |p=27}}
{{quote|text=Christianity is called the religion of ''pity''. Pity stands opposed to the tonic emotions which heighten our vitality: it has a depressing effect. We are deprived of strength when we feel pity. That loss of strength which suffering as such inflicts on life is still further increased and multiplied by pity. Pity makes suffering contagious.&lt;ref&gt;''The Antichrist'', section 7. transl. Walter Kaufmann, in ''The Portable Nietzsche'', 1977, pp. 572–73.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''[[Ecce Homo (book)|Ecce Homo]]'' Nietzsche called the establishment of moral systems based on a dichotomy of [[good and evil]] a "calamitous error",{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1888d |loc=Why I Am a Destiny, §3}} and wished to initiate a [[transvaluation of values|re-evaluation]] of the [[Value (ethics)|values]] of the Judeo-Christian world.{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1888c |pp=4, 8, 18, 29, 37, 40, 51, 57, 59}} He indicates his desire to bring about a new, more naturalistic source of value in the vital impulses of life itself.

While Nietzsche attacked the principles of [[Judaism]], he was not [[antisemitic]]: in his work ''[[On the Genealogy of Morality]]'', he explicitly condemns antisemitism, and points out that his attack on Judaism was not an attack on contemporary Jewish people but specifically an attack upon the ancient Jewish priesthood whom he claims [[antisemitic Christians]] paradoxically based their views upon.{{Sfn |Sedgwick |2009 |p=69}} An Israeli historian who performed a statistical analysis of everything Nietzsche wrote about Jews claims that cross references and context make clear that almost all (85%) negative comments are actually attacks on Christian doctrine or, sarcastically, on Richard Wagner.&lt;ref&gt;Zev Golan, "Nietzsche: Anti- or Philo-Semite? An Examination of His Books," in ''God, Man and Nietzsche'', iUniverse, 2008 edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nietzsche felt that modern antisemitism was "despicable" and against European ideals.{{Sfn |Sedgwick |2009 |p=68}} Its cause, in his opinion, was the growth in European nationalism and the endemic "jealousy and hatred" of Jewish success.{{Sfn |Sedgwick |2009 |p=68}} He wrote that Jews should be thanked for helping uphold a respect for the philosophies of ancient Greece,{{Sfn |Sedgwick |2009 |p=68}} and for giving rise to "the noblest human being (Christ), the purest philosopher ([[Baruch Spinoza]]), the mightiest book, and the most effective moral code in the world."&lt;ref name=nebraska&gt;Nietzsche, Friedrich Wilhelm.

===Death of God and nihilism===
{{Main|God is dead|Nihilism}}
The statement "[[God is dead]]", occurring in several of Nietzsche's works (notably in ''[[The Gay Science]]''), has become one of his best-known remarks. On the basis of it, most commentators&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Morgan |first=George Allen |title=What Nietzsche Means |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |location=Cambridge, MA |year=1941 |page=36 |isbn=978-0-8371-7404-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; regard Nietzsche as an [[atheism|atheist]]; others (such as Kaufmann) suggest that this statement reflects a more subtle understanding of divinity. Recent developments in modern science and the increasing [[secularization]] of European society had effectively 'killed' the [[Abrahamic]] God, who had served as the basis for meaning and value in the West for more than a thousand years. The death of God may lead beyond bare perspectivism to outright [[nihilism]], the belief that nothing has any inherent importance and that life lacks purpose. Here he states that the Christian moral doctrine provides people with [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]], belief in God (which [[Theodicy|justifies]] the evil in the world) and a basis for [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective knowledge]]. In this sense, in constructing a world where objective knowledge is possible, Christianity is an antidote to a primal form of nihilism—the despair of meaninglessness. As [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] put the problem, "If God as the suprasensory ground and goal of all reality is dead, if the suprasensory world of the ideas has suffered the loss of its obligatory and above it its vitalizing and upbuilding power, then nothing more remains to which man can cling and by which he can orient himself."{{Sfn |Heidegger |p=61}}

One such reaction to the loss of meaning is what Nietzsche calls ''passive nihilism'', which he recognises in the [[pessimism|pessimistic]] philosophy of [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]. Schopenhauer's doctrine—which Nietzsche also refers to as [[Buddhism in the West#Philosophical interest|Western Buddhism]]—advocates separating oneself from will and desires in order to reduce suffering. Nietzsche characterises this [[Asceticism|ascetic]] attitude as a "will to nothingness", whereby life turns away from itself, as there is nothing of value to be found in the world. This moving away of all value in the world is characteristic of the nihilist, although in this, the nihilist appears to be inconsistent:&lt;ref&gt;This "will to nothingness" is still a willing of some sort, because it is exactly ''as'' a pessimist that Schopenhauer clings to life. See F. Nietzsche, ''[[On the Genealogy of Morals]]'', III:7&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|A nihilist is a man who judges that the real world ought ''not'' to be, and that the world as it ought to be does not exist. According to this view, our existence (action, [[suffering]], willing, feeling) has no meaning: this 'in vain' is the nihilists' pathos—an inconsistency on the part of the nihilists.|Friedrich Nietzsche, KSA 12:9 [60]|taken from ''The Will to Power'', section 585, translated by [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]]}}

Nietzsche approaches the problem of nihilism as a deeply personal one, stating that this problem of the modern world is a problem that has "become conscious" in him.&lt;ref&gt;F. Nietzsche, KSA 12:7 [8]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, he emphasizes both the danger of nihilism and the possibilities it offers, as seen in his statement that "I praise, I do not reproach, [nihilism's] arrival. I believe it is one of the greatest crises, a moment of the deepest self-reflection of humanity. Whether man recovers from it, whether he becomes master of this crisis, is a question of his strength!"&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Nietzsche, Complete Works Vol. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Nietzsche, it is only when nihilism is ''overcome'' that a culture can have a true foundation on which to thrive. He wished to hasten its coming only so that he could also hasten its ultimate departure. Heidegger interprets the death of God with what he explains as the death of [[metaphysics]]. He concludes that metaphysics has reached its potential and that the ultimate fate and downfall of metaphysics was proclaimed with the statement "God is dead".

===Will to power===
{{Main|Will to power}}
A basic element in Nietzsche's philosophical outlook is the "[[will to power]]" (''der Wille zur Macht''), which he maintained provides a basis for understanding human behavior—more so than competing explanations, such as the ones based on pressure for adaptation or survival.{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1886 |p=13}}{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1882 |p=349}}{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1887 |p=II:12}} As such, according to Nietzsche, the drive for conservation appears as the major motivator of human or animal behavior only in exceptions, as the general condition of life is not one of emergency, of 'struggle for existence'.{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1888b |loc=Skirmishes of an untimely man, §14}} More often than not, self-conservation is but a consequence of a creature's will to exert its strength on the outside world.

In presenting his theory of human behavior, Nietzsche also addressed, and attacked, concepts from philosophies popularly embraced in his days, such as Schopenhauer's notion of an aimless will or that of [[utilitarianism]]. Utilitarians claim that what moves people is mainly the desire to be happy, to accumulate pleasure in their lives. But such a conception of happiness Nietzsche rejected as something limited to, and characteristic of, the bourgeois lifestyle of the English society,&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Leiter]], ''Routledge guide to Nietzsche on morality'', p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; and instead put forth the idea that happiness is not an aim ''per se''—it is instead a consequence of a successful pursuit of one's aims, of the overcoming of hurdles to one's actions—in other words, of the fulfillment of the will.{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1888c |loc=§2}}

Related to his theory of the will to power is his speculation, which he did not deem final,{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1886 |loc=I, §36}} regarding the reality of the physical world, including inorganic matter—that, like man's affections and impulses, the material world is also set by the dynamics of a form of the will to power. At the core of his theory is a rejection of [[atomism]]—the idea that matter is composed of stable, indivisible units (atoms). Instead, he seems to have accepted the conclusions of [[Ruđer Bošković]], who explained the qualities of matter as a result of an interplay of forces.&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche comments in many notes about matter being a hypothesis drawn from the metaphysics of substance: G. Whitlock, "Roger Boscovich, Benedict de Spinoza and Friedrich Nietzsche: The Untold Story", ''Nietzsche-Studien'' 25, 1996, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1886 |loc=I, §12}} One study of Nietzsche defines his fully developed concept of the will to power as "the element from which derive both the quantitative difference of related forces and the quality that devolves into each force in this relation" revealing the will to power as "the principle of the synthesis of forces."{{Sfn |Deleuze |2006 |p=46}} Of such forces Nietzsche said they could perhaps be viewed as a primitive form of the will. Likewise he rejected as a mere interpretation the view that the movement of bodies is ruled by inexorable laws of nature, positing instead that movement was governed by the power relations between bodies and forces.{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1886 |loc=I, §22}} Other scholars disagree that Nietzsche considered the material world to be a form of the will to power: Nietzsche thoroughly criticized metaphysics, and by including the will to power in the material world, he would simply be setting up a new metaphysics. Other than aphorism 36 in ''Beyond Good and Evil'', where he raised a question regarding will to power as being in the material world, it was only in his notes (unpublished by himself), where he wrote about a metaphysical will to power. Nietzsche directed his landlord to burn those notes in 1888 when he left Sils Maria for the last time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/nie/summary/v031/31.1leddy.html |title=Project MUSE – Nietzsche's Mirror: The World as Will to Power (review) |journal=The Journal of Nietzsche Studies |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=66–68 |doi=10.1353/nie.2006.0006 |accessdate=22 August 2014|date=2006-06-14 |last1=Leddy |first1=Thomas }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eternal return===
{{Main|Eternal return}}

"Eternal return" (also known as "eternal recurrence") is a hypothetical concept that posits that the universe has been recurring, and will continue to recur, in a self-similar form for an infinite number of times across infinite time or space. It is a purely [[physics|physical]] concept, involving no supernatural [[reincarnation]], but the return of beings in the same bodies. Nietzsche first invokes the idea of eternal return in a parable in Section 341 of ''[[The Gay Science]]'', and also in the chapter "Of the Vision and the Riddle" in ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', among other places.{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1961 |pp=176–80}} Nietzsche contemplates the idea as potentially "horrifying and paralyzing," and says that its burden is the "heaviest weight" imaginable ("''das schwerste Gewicht''").&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Kundera |first=Milan |title=The Unbearable Lightness of Being |year=1999 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wish for the eternal return of all events would mark the ultimate affirmation of life, a reaction to [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]'s praise of denying the will‐to‐live. To comprehend eternal recurrence in his thought, and to not merely come to peace with it but to embrace it, requires ''[[amor fati]]'', "love of fate".&lt;ref name=dudl&gt;{{Cite book |last=Dudley |first=Will |title=Hegel, Nietzsche, and Philosophy: Thinking Freedom |year=2002 |page=201 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=4dLeWFK6qp0C&amp;pg=PA201|isbn=9780521812504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Heidegger]] points out in his lectures on Nietzsche, Nietzsche's first mention of eternal recurrence presents this concept as a [[Thought experiment|hypothetical ''question'']] rather than postulating it as a fact.  According to Heidegger, it is the burden imposed by the ''question'' of eternal recurrence—whether or not such a thing could possibly be true—that is so significant in modern thought: "The way Nietzsche here patterns the first communication of the thought of the 'greatest burden' [of eternal recurrence] makes it clear that this 'thought of thoughts' is at the same time 'the most burdensome thought.'"&lt;ref&gt;See Heidegger, ''Nietzsche. Volume II: The Eternal Recurrence of the Same'' trans. [[David Farrell Krell]]. New York: Harper and Row, 1984. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only does Nietzsche posit that the universe is recurring over infinite time and space, but that the different versions of events that have occurred in the past may at one point or another take place again, hence "all configurations that have previously existed on this earth must yet meet..."&lt;ref name="Vintage Books"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kaufmann |first=Friedrich Nietzsche. Transl., with comm., by Walter |title=The Gay Science with a Prelude in Rhymes and an Appendix of Songs |date=1974 |publisher=Vintage Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0394719856 |page=16 |edition=[1st ed.]}}&lt;/ref&gt; And with each version of events is hoping that some knowledge or awareness is gained to better the individual, hence "And thus it will happen one day that a man will be born again, just like me and a woman will be born, just like Mary—only that it is hoped to be that the head of this man may contain a little less foolishness..."&lt;ref name="Vintage Books"/&gt;

[[Alexander Nehamas]] writes in ''Nietzsche: Life as Literature'' of three ways of seeing the eternal recurrence: "(A) My life will recur in exactly identical fashion." This expresses a totally fatalistic approach to the idea. "(B) My life may recur in exactly identical fashion." This second view conditionally asserts [[cosmology]], but fails to capture what Nietzsche refers to in ''The Gay Science'', 341. Finally, "(C) If my life were to recur, then it could recur only in identical fashion." Nehamas shows that this interpretation exists totally independently of physics and does not presuppose the truth of cosmology. Nehamas draws the conclusion that if individuals constitute themselves through their actions, then they can only maintain themselves in their current state by living in a recurrence of past actions (Nehamas 153). Nietzsche's thought is the negation of the idea of a history of salvation.&lt;ref name="Tongeren2000"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Paul Van Tongeren |title=Reinterpreting Modern Culture: An Introduction to Friedrich Nietzsche's Philosophy |url=https://books.google.com/?id=TqxrlA9Qxg0C&amp;pg=PA295 |accessdate=18 April 2013 |year=2000 |publisher=Purdue University Press |isbn=978-1-55753-157-5 |page=295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Übermensch===
{{Main|Übermensch}}

Another concept important to an understanding of Nietzsche's thought is the ''Übermensch''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Nietzsche |first=Friedrich |title=The Portable Nietzsche |others=trans. Walter Kaufmann |location=New York |publisher=Penguin |year=1954}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Nietzsche |first=Friedrich |others=ed. Adrian Del Caro and Robert Pippin |title=Nietzsche: Thus Spoke Zarathustra |isbn=978-0-521-60261-7 |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Lampert |first=Laurence |title=Nietzsche's Teaching |location=New Haven, CT |publisher=Yale University Press |year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Rosen |first=Stanley |title=The Mask of Enlightenment |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developing the idea of nihilism, Nietzsche wrote ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', therein introducing the concept of a value-creating Übermensch, not as a project, but as an anti-project, the absence of any project.&lt;ref name="Bennett2001"/&gt; According to Lampert, "the death of God must be followed by a long twilight of piety and nihilism (II. 19; III. 8). Zarathustra's gift of the overman is given to a mankind not aware of the problem to which the overman is the solution."{{Sfn |Lampert |1986 |p=18}} Zarathustra presents the overman as the creator of new values, and he appears as a solution to the problem of the death of God and nihilism. The overman does not follow morality of common people since that favors mediocrity but instead rises above the notion of [[good and evil]] and above the "[[Herd behavior|herd]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://philosophy.lander.edu/ethics/notes-nietzsche.html |title=Philosophy 302: Ethics Nietzsche, "Slave and Master Morality"}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way Zarathustra proclaims his ultimate goal as the journey towards the state of overman. He wants a kind of spiritual evolution of self-awareness and overcoming of traditional views on morality and justice that stem from the [[superstition]] beliefs still deeply rooted or related to the notion of God and Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.gradesaver.com/thus-spoke-zarathustra/study-guide/major-themes/ |title=Thus Spoke Zarathustra themes}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=July 2018}}

While interpretations of Nietzsche's overman vary wildly, here is one of his quotations from ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'' (Prologue, §§3–4):

{{quote|text=I teach you the overman. Man is something that shall be overcome. What have you done to overcome him?... All beings so far have created something beyond themselves; and do you want to be the ebb of this great flood, and even go back to the beasts rather than overcome man? What is ape to man? A laughing stock or painful embarrassment. And man shall be that to overman: a laughing stock or painful embarrassment. You have made your way from worm to man, and much in you is still worm. Once you were apes, and even now, too, man is more ape than any ape... The overman is the meaning of the earth. Let your will say: the overman shall be the meaning of the earth... Man is a rope, tied between beast and overman—a rope over an abyss ... what is great in man is that he is a bridge and not an end.}}

Zarathustra contrasts the overman with the [[last man]] of egalitarian modernity (most obvious example being democracy), an alternative goal humanity might set for itself. The last man is possible only by mankind's having bred an [[Apathy|apathetic]] creature who has no great passion or commitment, who is unable to dream, who merely earns his living and keeps warm. This concept appears only in ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'', and is presented as a condition that would render the creation of the overman impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.nietzschespirit.com/files/The_Most_Despicable_Man_is_Coming...the_Last_Man.html |title=Nietzsche and Heidegger |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607060856/http://www.nietzschespirit.com/files/The_Most_Despicable_Man_is_Coming...the_Last_Man.html |archivedate=7 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have suggested that the notion of eternal return is related to the overman, since willing the eternal return of the same is a necessary step if the overman is to create new values, untainted by the spirit of gravity or [[asceticism]]. Values involve a rank-ordering of things, and so are inseparable from approval and disapproval; yet it was dissatisfaction that prompted men to seek refuge in other-worldliness and embrace other-worldly values. It could seem that the overman, in being devoted to any values at all, would necessarily fail to create values that did not share some bit of asceticism. Willing the eternal recurrence is presented as accepting the existence of the low while still recognizing it as the low, and thus as overcoming the spirit of gravity or asceticism. One must have the strength of the overman in order to will the eternal recurrence; that is, only the overman will have the strength to fully accept all of his past life, including his failures and misdeeds, and to truly will their eternal return. This action nearly kills Zarathustra, for example, and most human beings cannot avoid other-worldliness because they really are sick, not because of any choice they made.

The Nazis tried to incorporate the concept into their ideology. After his death, [[Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche]] became the curator and editor of her brother's manuscripts. She reworked Nietzsche's unpublished writings to fit her own [[German nationalism#1871 to World War I, 1914–1918|German nationalist]] ideology while often contradicting or obfuscating Nietzsche's stated opinions, which were explicitly [[philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche#Nietzsche's criticism of anti-Semitism and nationalism|opposed to antisemitism and nationalism]]. Through her published editions, Nietzsche's work became associated with [[fascism]] and [[Nazism]];&lt;ref name="Golomb 2002"/&gt; 20th century scholars contested this interpretation of his work and corrected editions of his writings were soon made available.

Although Nietzsche has famously been misrepresented as a predecessor to Nazism, he criticized anti-Semitism, [[pan-Germanism]] and, to a lesser extent, [[nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Keith Ansell-Pearson, ''An Introduction to Nietzsche as Political Thinker: The Perfect Nihilist,'' Cambridge University Press, 1994, pp 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, he broke with his editor in 1886 because of his opposition to his editor's anti-Semitic stances, and his rupture with [[Richard Wagner]], expressed in ''[[The Case of Wagner]]'' and ''[[Nietzsche contra Wagner]],'' both of which he wrote in 1888, had much to do with Wagner's endorsement of pan-Germanism and anti-Semitism — and also of his rallying to Christianity. In a March 29, 1887 letter to [[Theodor Fritsch]], Nietzsche mocked anti-Semites, Fritsch, [[Eugen Dühring]], Wagner, Ebrard&lt;!-- is it [[Johannes Heinrich August Ebrard]] ? --&gt;, [[Adolf Wahrmund|Wahrmund]], and the leading advocate of pan-Germanism, [[Paul de Lagarde]], who would become, along with Wagner and [[Houston Chamberlain]], the main official influences of [[Nazism]].&lt;ref name=Bataille/&gt; This 1887 letter to Fritsch ended by: "And finally, how do you think I feel when the name Zarathustra is mouthed by anti-Semites?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20150815060910/http://www.geocities.com/thenietzschechannel/nlett1887.htm March 29, 1887 letter] to [[Theodor Fritsch]] {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critique of mass culture===
Friedrich Nietzsche held a pessimistic view on modern society and culture. His views stand against the concept of popular culture. He believed the press and mass culture led to conformity and brought about mediocrity. Nietzsche saw a lack of intellectual progress, leading to the decline of the human species. According to Nietzsche, individuals needed to overcome this form of mass culture. He believed some people were able to become superior individuals through the use of will power. By rising above mass culture, society would produce higher, brighter and healthier human beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kellner |first=Douglas |title=Nietzsche's Critique of Mass Culture |journal=International Studies in Philosophy |year=1999 |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=77–89 |doi=10.5840/intstudphil199931353 |url=http://www.pdcnet.org/pdc/bvdb.nsf/purchase?openform&amp;fp=intstudphil&amp;id=intstudphil_1999_0031_0003_0077_0089&amp;onlyautologin=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reading and influence==
[[File:Nietzsche Archives in Weimar.jpg|thumb|The residence of Nietzsche's last three years along with archive in [[Weimar]], Germany, which holds many of Nietzsche's papers]]
{{Main|Library of Friedrich Nietzsche}}
A trained philologist, Nietzsche had a thorough knowledge of [[Greek philosophy]]. He read [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Plato]], [[John Stuart Mill|Mill]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] and [[Afrikan Spir|Spir]],&lt;ref&gt;Brobjer, Thomas. "Nietzsche's Reading and Private Library, 1885–1889." Published in ''Journal of History of Ideas.''&lt;/ref&gt; who became his main opponents in his philosophy, and later [[Baruch Spinoza]], whom he saw as his "precursor" in many respects&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Franz Overbeck, 30 July 1881&lt;/ref&gt; but as a personification of the "ascetic ideal" in others. However, Nietzsche referred to Kant as a "moral fanatic", Plato as "boring", Mill as a "blockhead", and of Spinoza he said: "How much of personal timidity and vulnerability does this masquerade of a sickly recluse betray?"{{Sfn|Russell|2004|pp=693–97}} He likewise expressed contempt for British author [[George Eliot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Thomas J. |last=Joudrey |title=The Defects of Perfectionism: Nietzsche, Eliot, and the Irrevocability of Wrong |journal=[[Philological Quarterly]] |number=96.1 |year=2017 |pages=77–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nietzsche's philosophy, while innovative and revolutionary, was indebted to many predecessors. While at Basel, Nietzsche offered lecture courses on pre-Platonic philosophers for several years, and the text of this lecture series has been characterized as a "lost link" in the development of his thought. "In it concepts such as the will to power, the eternal return of the same, the overman, gay science, self-overcoming and so on receive rough, unnamed formulations and are linked to specific pre-Platonics, especially Heraclitus, who emerges as a pre-Platonic Nietzsche."{{Sfn|Nietzsche|2001|p=xxxvii}} The [[pre-Socratic]] thinker [[Heraclitus]] was known for the rejection of the concept of [[being]] as a constant and eternal principle of universe, and his embrace of "flux" and incessant change. His symbolism of the world as "child play" marked by amoral spontaneity and lack of definite rules was appreciated by Nietzsche.{{Sfn|Roochnik|2004|pp=37–39}} From his Heraclitean sympathy, Nietzsche was also a vociferous detractor of [[Parmenides]], who opposed Heraclitus and believed all world is a single Being with no change at all.{{Sfn|Roochnik|2004|p=48}}

In his ''Egotism in German Philosophy'', [[George Santayana|Santayana]] claimed that Nietzsche's whole philosophy was a reaction to Schopenhauer. Santayana wrote that Nietzsche's work was "an emendation of that of Schopenhauer. The will to live would become the will to dominate; pessimism founded on reflection would become optimism founded on courage; the suspense of the will in contemplation would yield to a more biological account of intelligence and taste; finally in the place of pity and asceticism (Schopenhauer's two principles of morals) Nietzsche would set up the duty of asserting the will at all costs and being cruelly but beautifully strong. These points of difference from Schopenhauer cover the whole philosophy of Nietzsche."{{Sfn|Santayana|1916|p=114}}

Nietzsche expressed admiration for 17th-century French moralists such as [[François de La Rochefoucauld (writer)|La Rochefoucauld]], [[Jean de La Bruyère|La Bruyère]] and [[Luc de Clapiers, marquis de Vauvenargues|Vauvenargues]],&lt;ref&gt;Brendan Donnellan, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/404869 "Nietzsche and La Rochefoucauld"] in ''[[The German Quarterly]]'', Vol. 52, No. 3 (May 1979), pp. 303–18&lt;/ref&gt; as well as for [[Stendhal]].{{Sfn|Nietzsche|1888d|loc="Why I am So Clever", §3}} The [[organicism]] of [[Paul Bourget]] influenced Nietzsche,&lt;ref&gt;Johan Grzelczyk, [http://www.hypernietzsche.org/navigate.php?sigle=jgrzelczyk-4 "Féré et Nietzsche: au sujet de la décadence"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116213847/http://www.hypernietzsche.org/navigate.php?sigle=jgrzelczyk-4 |date=16 November 2006 }}, ''HyperNietzsche'', 1 November 2005 {{fr icon}}.

Nietzsche's works did not reach a wide readership during his active writing career. However, in 1888 the influential Danish critic [[Georg Brandes]] aroused considerable excitement about Nietzsche through a series of lectures he gave at the [[University of Copenhagen]]. In the years after Nietzsche's death in 1900, his works became better known, and readers have responded to them in complex and sometimes controversial ways.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri19chisrich#page/672/mode/1up 1910 article from the Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt; Many Germans eventually discovered his appeals for greater [[individualism]] and personality development in ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', but responded to them divergently. He had some following among left-wing Germans in the 1890s; in 1894–1895 German conservatives wanted to ban his work as [[subversive]]. During the late 19th century [[Anarchism and Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche's ideas were commonly associated with anarchist movements]] and appear to have had influence within them, particularly in France and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;O.

Writer on music [[Donald Mitchell (writer)|Donald Mitchell]] notes that [[Gustav Mahler]] was "attracted to the poetic fire of Zarathustra, but repelled by the intellectual core of its writings." He also quotes Mahler himself, and adds that he was influenced by Nietzsche's conception and affirmative approach to nature, which Mahler presented in his [[Symphony No. 3 (Mahler)|Third Symphony]] using [[Zarathustra's roundelay]]. [[Frederick Delius]] produced a piece of choral music, ''[[A Mass of Life]]'', based on a text of ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'', while [[Richard Strauss]] (who also based his [[Also sprach Zarathustra (Strauss)|''Also sprach Zarathustra'']] on the same book), was only interested in finishing "another chapter of symphonic autobiography".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=yKCq909vSpwC&amp;pg=PA99&amp;dq=Mahler+Nietzsche+influence |title=Gustav Mahler: The Early Years |first=Mitchell |last=Donald|isbn=9780520041417 |year=1980 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Famous writers and poets influenced by Nietzsche include [[André Gide]], [[August Strindberg]], [[Robinson Jeffers]], [[Pío Baroja]], [[D.

Nietzsche was an early influence on the poetry of [[Rainer Maria Rilke]].

Nietzsche's growing prominence suffered a severe setback when his works became closely associated with [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Nazi Germany]]. Many political leaders of the twentieth century were at least superficially familiar with Nietzsche's ideas, although it is not always possible to determine whether they actually read his work. It is debated among scholars whether Hitler read Nietzsche, although if he did his reading of him may not have been extensive.&lt;ref&gt;"We know, from his [Hitler's] secretary, that he could quote Schopenhauer by the page, and the other German philosopher of willpower, Nietzsche, whose works he afterwards presented to [[Mussolini]], was often on his lips."

Enigma Books (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"'Landsberg,' Hitler told [[Hans Frank]], was his 'university paid for by the state.' He read, he said, everything he could get hold of: Nietzsche, [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]], [[Leopold von Ranke|Ranke]], [[Heinrich von Treitschke|Treitschke]], [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]]'s Thoughts and Memories, and the war memoirs of German and allied generals and statesmen....But Hitler's reading and reflection were anything but academic, doubtless he did read much. However, as was noted in an earlier chapter, he made clear in [[Mein Kampf|My Struggle]] that reading for him had purely an instrumental purpose. He read not for knowledge or enlightenment, but for confirmation of his own preconceptions." Kershaw, Ian Hitler: ''Hubris 1889–1936''.

A decade after World War II, there was a revival of Nietzsche's philosophical writings thanks to exhaustive translations and analyses by [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] and [[R. J.

'''''Gallery of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm in Brussels''''' is a 1651 painting of [[Archduke Leopold Wilhelm]]'s Italian art collection by the [[Flemish Baroque painting|Flemish Baroque]] painter [[David Teniers the Younger]], now in the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fine-arts-museum.be/nl/de-collectie/david-ii-teniers-aartshertog-leopold-willem-in-zijn-galerij-italiaanse-schilderijen Aartshertog Leopold Willem in zijn galerij Italiaanse schilderijen] in the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]] collection&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting shows the Archduke as a collector admiring a set of prints on a table. The table has been documented as a creation of the sculptor [[Adriaen de Vries]] depicting [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]]. The artist himself is showing his patron an example of a print. The paintings are arranged in rows on a rear wall, and is one of the first that [[David Teniers the Younger]] prepared to document the Archduke's collection before he employed 12 engravers to publish his ''[[Theatrum Pictorium]]'', considered the "first illustrated art catalog". He published this book of engravings after the Archduke had moved to Austria and taken his collection with him. It was published in Antwerp in 1659 and again in 1673.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/gri_33125009347911 Online version] of the [[Theatrum Pictorium]], 1673&lt;/ref&gt; 

This painting was purchased for the museum's collection in 1873 from J. Nieuwenhuys in Brussels.

The following list is of the recognisable paintings of the collection, not all of which were included in the Italian catalog prepared by Teniers, which was a selection of 243 of the most prized paintings out of a collection of 1300-1400 pieces. Many are still in the Viennese collection. The list begins with the paintings on the rear wall, running from left to right and from top to bottom.

'''''Golden Summer, Eaglemont''''' is an 1889 painting by Australian artist [[Arthur Streeton]]. Painted during a summer drought when Streeton was twenty-one years old, it is an idyllic depiction of sunlit, undulating plains in rural [[Heidelberg, Victoria|Heidelberg]] on [[Melbourne]]'s outskirts. [[Naturalism (arts)|Naturalistic]] yet poetic, and a conscious effort by Streeton to create his most epic work yet, it is a prime example of the artist's distinctive, high-keyed blue and gold palette, what he considered "nature's scheme of colour in Australia". It is one of his most famous works and is considered a masterpiece of [[Australian Impressionism]].

==Background==
Streeton painted it ''[[en plein air]]'' in January 1889 at an artists' camp he established the previous year at [[Eaglemont, Victoria|Mount Eagle]] (now Eaglemont), near [[Heidelberg, Victoria|Heidelberg]], on the outskirts of [[Melbourne]]. There, Streeton, [[Charles Conder]], [[Tom Roberts]] and occasionally other artists occupied an old weatherboard house. Streeton described the location in a letter to Roberts, calling it "our hill of gold":

{{quote|I sit here in the upper circle surrounded by copper and gold, and smile with joy under my fly net as all the light, glory and quivering brightness passes slowly and freely before my eyes. Nothing happier than this. I shout and laugh at my immense wealth, all free and without responsibility. Who could steal this from me? No one.}}

Years later, Streeton recalled painting ''Golden Summer'' as he, Conder, and fellow ''plein air'' painter [[John Ford Paterson]] shared cheese and a bottle of [[Bordeaux wine|claret]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/1675780 "Australian Art: Mr Streeton's Return: Memories of Heidelberg"] (3 February 1922), ''The Argus''. Retrieved 2 August 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibition and reception==
{{Quote|text=The so-called "impressionist school" at Heidelberg has done some good after all.|sign=''[[The Colac Herald]]'', 1891, after London's [[Royal Academy of Arts|Royal Academy]] accepted ''Golden Summer, Eaglemont''&lt;ref&gt;[https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/87729989 "Melbourne"]. ''The Colac Herald''. 29 May 1891. p. 3. Retrieved 18 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
''[[Table Talk (magazine)|Table Talk]]'' reported in 1889 that ''Golden Summer, Eaglemont'' "abundantly testifies to [Streeton's] perfect sense of colour ... He paints summer effects as if he loved the country."&lt;ref name=clark&gt;Clark, Jane (1985). "Heidelberg Summers". In Ryan, Judith. ''Golden Summers: Heidelberg and Beyond''. International Cultural Corporation of Australia. pp. 104–105. {{ISBN|0-642-09855-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When the painting appeared at the [[Victorian Artists Society]]'s 1889 winter show, the critic for ''[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]]'', while opposed to what he called "the impressionist fad", said ''Golden Summer'' "is the best example of this class of work in the exhibition."&lt;ref&gt;[https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/6243860 "The Winter Exhibition of the Victorian Artists' Society"]. ''The Argus''. 4 May 1889. p. 12. Retrieved 18 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conder took ''Golden Summer, Eaglemont'' to [[London]] in April 1890, where, the following year as ''Golden Summer, Australia'', it became the first painting by an Australian-born artist to be exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]]. In 1892, it appeared at the [[Paris Salon]], and won an award. One critic noted the popularity of ''Golden Summer'' with "the crowds that throng the Salon", saying that it was "simply impossible" to pass by the painting "as it is utterly different from any other picture in the vast collection".&lt;ref&gt;[http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/8450318 "The Australian Artists in Paris"] (17 August 1892), ''The Argus''. Retrieved 24 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Australian artist [[John Longstaff]], then based in Paris, said the painting "created quite a sensation and stood out in oneness and quality all through everything else on the walls."&lt;ref name=clark/&gt;

==Provenance==
Scottish shipbuilder [[Charles Mitchell (shipbuilder)|Charles Mitchell]] purchased ''Golden Summer, Eaglemont'' on the opening day of the 1892 Paris Salon. It remained part of his estate until Streeton re-acquired the painting from Mitchell's widow in 1919.

Ahead of its public auction in Australia in 1924, [[Lionel Lindsay]] extolled the work in the hope that it would enter a public gallery:&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay, Lionel (28 November 1923). [http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article119180066 "Golden Summer: Streeton's Masterpiece"], ''Evening News''. Retrieved 11 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|This tranquil landscape, so simply yet so exquisitely fashioned, possesses for Australians a sentiment no other people may equally enjoy. It is the first great Australian landscape, untrammeled by picture making formula, to come from the hand of the native born. It is, therefore, historically the most important landscape in Australia.}}

A private collector acquired it for 1,000 [[Guinea (British coin)|guinea]]s, then a record for a painting by an Australian artist. Streeton used the money to commission an architect to design and build 'Longacres', a new house and studio [[Olinda, Victoria|Olinda]], outside Melbourne.&lt;ref&gt;James, Rodney (2 November 2017).

'''Grassmann's laws''' describe empirical results about how the perception of mixtures of colored lights (i.e., lights that co-stimulate the same area on the retina) composed of different [[spectral power distribution]]s can be algebraically related to one another in a color matching context. Discovered by [[Hermann Grassmann]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grassmann|first1=H.|title=Zur Theorie der Farbenmischung|journal=Annalen der Physik und Chemie|date=1853|volume=165|issue=5|pages=69–84|doi=10.1002/andp.18531650505}}&lt;/ref&gt; these "laws" are actually principles used to predict color match responses to a good approximation under [[photopic vision|photopic]] and [[mesopic vision|mesopic]] vision.  A number of studies have examined how and why they provide poor predictions under specific conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pokorny|first1=Joel|last2=Smith|first2=Vivianne C.|last3=Xu|first3=Jun|title=Quantal and non-quantal color matches: failure of Grassmann’s laws at short wavelengths|journal=Journal of the Optical Society of America A|date=1 February 2012|volume=29|issue=2|pages=A324|doi=10.1364/JOSAA.29.00A324}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brill|first1=Michael H.|last2=Robertson|first2=Alan R.|title=Open Problems on the Validity of Grassmann's Laws|journal=Colorimetry|date=2007|pages=245–259|doi=10.1002/9780470175637.ch10/summary|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470175637.ch10/summary|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

----
{|
|valign="top"|{{nowrap|'''First law''':}}
|Two colored lights appear different if they differ in either dominant wavelength, luminance or ''purity''. Corollary: For every colored light there exists a light with a complementary color such that a mixture of both lights either desaturates the more intense component or gives uncolored (grey/white) light.
|-
|valign="top"|{{nowrap|'''Second law''':}}
|The appearance of a mixture light made from two components changes if either component changes. Corollary: A mixture of two colored lights that are non-complementary result in a mixture that varies in hue with relative intensities of each light and in saturation according to the distance between the hues of each light.
|-
|valign="top"|{{nowrap|'''Third law''':}}
|There are lights with different spectral power distributions but appear identical. First corollary: such identical appearing lights must have identical effects when added to a mixture of light. Second corollary: such identical appearing lights must have identical effects when subtracted (i.e., filtered) from a mixture of light.
|-
|valign="top"|{{nowrap|'''Fourth law''':}}
|The intensity of a mixture of lights is the sum of the intensities of the components. This is also known as [[Abney's law]].
|}
----

These laws entail an algebraic representation of colored light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reinhard|first1=Erik|last2=Khan|first2=Erum Arif|last3=Akyuz|first3=Ahmet Oguz|last4=Johnson|first4=Garrett|title=Color Imaging: Fundamentals and Applications|date=2008|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781439865200|page=364|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=suLqBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA364&amp;dq=grassman%27s+laws+additive&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjYz5iD8LPYAhWKxFQKHRrZCfgQ6AEINjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=grassman's%20laws%20additive&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming beam 1 and 2 each have a color, and the observer chooses &lt;math&gt;(R_1,G_1,B_1)&lt;/math&gt; as the strengths of the primaries that match beam 1 and &lt;math&gt;(R_2,G_2,B_2)&lt;/math&gt; as the strengths of the primaries that match beam 2, then if the two beams were combined, the matching values will be the sums of the components. Precisely, they will be &lt;math&gt;(R,G,B)&lt;/math&gt;, where:

:&lt;math&gt;R= R_1+R_2\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;G= G_1+G_2\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;B= B_1+B_2\,&lt;/math&gt;

Grassmann's laws can be expressed in general form by stating that for a given color with a [[Spectral density|spectral power distribution]] &lt;math&gt;I(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; the RGB coordinates are given by:

:&lt;math&gt;R= \int_0^\infty I(\lambda)\,\bar r(\lambda)\,d\lambda&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;G= \int_0^\infty I(\lambda)\,\bar g(\lambda)\,d\lambda&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;B= \int_0^\infty I(\lambda)\,\bar b(\lambda)\,d\lambda&lt;/math&gt;

Observe that these are linear in &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;; the functions &lt;math&gt;\bar r(\lambda), \bar g(\lambda), \bar b(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; are the [[color matching function]]s with respect to the chosen primaries.

The only thing that prevents the conflict's resolution is the character's constant avoidance or obliviousness of it throughout the plot, even if it was already obvious to the viewer, so the characters are all "idiots" in that they are too obtuse to simply resolve the conflict immediately.

Reviewing ''[[Prime (film)|Prime]]'' in 2005 critic [[Roger Ebert]] said "I can forgive and even embrace an Idiot Plot in its proper place (consider Astaire and Rogers in ''[[Top Hat]]''). But when the characters have depth and their decisions have consequences, I grow restless when their misunderstandings could be ended by words that the screenplay refuses to allow them to utter."&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051027/REVIEWS/510270305 | title = Movie reviews: Prime | author = Roger Ebert | accessdate = 2011-02-10 | work=Chicago Sun-Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternate formulations describe only the [[protagonist]] as being an idiot.

[[Science fiction]] writer and critic [[Damon Knight]], in his 1956 collection ''[[In Search of Wonder]]'', attributes the first use of the term to author [[James Blish]].&lt;ref name=DK/&gt; Knight went on to coin the term '''second-order idiot plot''', "in which not merely the principals, but everybody in the whole society has to be a grade-A idiot, or the story couldn't happen."&lt;ref name=DK/&gt;

Writing in 2013, author [[David Brin]] explored one variation of the idiot plot. In most adventure films and novels, the writers and directors have an imperative to keep their protagonists in jeopardy. This becomes difficult if they are surrounded by skilled professionals, paid to intervene and help if called. Hence, storytellers feel compelled to separate their characters from meaningful help, so that any assistance they receive is either late or else below the level of danger offered by the antagonists. The more powerful the villains, the more competent that help is allowed to be. "But for the most part, institutions and your neighbors are portrayed as sheep, so that only the hero's actions truly matter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=David Brin |authorlink=David Brin |url=http://www.locusmag.com/Perspectives/2013/01/david-brin-our-favorite-cliche-a-world-filled-with-idiots-orwhy-films-and-novels-routinely-depict-society-and-its-citizens-as-fools/ |title=Our Favorite Cliché — A World Filled With Idiots…, or, Why Films and Novels Routinely Depict Society and its Citizens as Fools |publisher=Locusmag.com |date=2013-01-20 |accessdate=2013-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Liberature''' is literature in which the material form is considered an important part of the whole and essential to understanding the work.

== Description of liberature ==

Liberature refers to a new kind of [[literature]], a [[Cross-genre|trans-genre]], in which the text and the material form of a book constitute an inseparable whole. The term itself is derived from the word ‘literature’, but draws from the Latin ''liber'', meaning "a book" and "the free one", as well as libra meaning "measurement" or "writing as a measurement of words." In a work of liberature, text does not serve as the sole source of meaning; the shape and the construction of the book, its format, the number of pages, its typographical layout, the size and type of the font applied, pictures and photographs integrated with the text, and type of paper or other material used in the process of creation of the book are all taken into consideration. The reader confronts a work of liberature as a total package, which often assumes a non-traditional shape, the quality of which, in practice, sometime involves a radical separation from the traditional design of the book. Its textual message dictates the physical shape that the work finally assumes. All of this lends a level of intent and control to the creator of liberature that surpasses that of other genres.

The demands posed by liberature shape a new kind of reader. In traditional texts, the reader empirically processes the text of a work in order to attain a desired level of understanding; one follows the steps of a model reader, whose purpose is to bring oneself closer to one’s virtual model. Certain works diverge from this concept of linear, textual reading such as those by [[Umberto Eco]] or [[Roland Barthes]]. Such works introduce uncertainty into these structured expectations and programs of behavior. Neither the works of Eco nor Barthes constitute liberature, but they exemplify a difference in the quality of the programming of the reader’s experience.

The printed works of liberature, although diverse in the application, share the following variables of the traversal function:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| Dynamics: || Static
|-
| Determinability: || Determinate
|-
| Transience: || Intransient
|-
| Perspective: || Impersonal
|-
| Access: || Random
|-
| Linking:  || Without links
|-
| User function: || Interpretative and explorative
|}

Only in several instances the work may breach the above-mentioned scheme of characteristic variables of liberature. In all other cases, readers are responsible for configuring their reading of the text.
Texts of liberature that generate multiple statements are not limited to literary works, and definitely not to electronic texts – the category embraces computer games and other forms of both [[ergodic literature|ergodic]] and non‐ergodic literature. The former requires a non‐trivial effort to traverse the text. In a classical, non-ergodic literary work, such as The Odyssey, the reader is required only to turn the pages and to interpret the text.
In permutative works – those in which the order of text is inconsequential - instead of static function defining the dynamics, something else occurs.  An intratextonic dynamic, one that guides the reader throughout the text, occurs. The text is also not determinate, meaning that it lacks a specificity which would hinder interpretation and different readings. The ergodic character of the work is usually determined by the exploratory function of the reader.
The parallel character of the works is written into the very core of liberature; the order in which the reader perceives the text governs the way the work is rendered. The interactive capacity of the work becomes, if not an aesthetic category, a way of the reader’s behavior that is written into the text. The work of liberature disrupts the structure of expectations based on a [[syntagmatic]] order as well as the strategies characteristic of a linear text. The works of liberature refer to the experience of simultaneousness. Furthermore, liberature as a [[Cross-genre|hybrid genre]] incorporating the features of numerous media at the same time, including the arts, assumes a quality of simultaneousness as a dominating one.

== The creation of the concept. Liberature ''avant la lettre'' ==

In 1999, Zenon Fajfer postulated the [[genre]] of liberature to describe the yet-undefinable work ''Oka-leczenie'' that he and Katarzyna Bazarnik had been working on. In a translated explanation of the concept, Fajfer describes liberature as “a type or genre of literature in which the text is integrated with the physical space of the book into a meaningful whole and in which all elements (from the graphic ones to the kinds of paper (or other material) and the physical shape of the book) may contribute to its meaning.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Małopolski Instytut Kultury |url=http://www.slideshare.net/mik_krakow/zenon-fajfer-a-brief-comment-for-the-foreign-reader-of-liberature |title=Fajfer, Zenon, "A Brief Comment for the Foreign Reader of Liberature", October 2008 |publisher=Slideshare.net |date=2009-07-09 |accessdate=2012-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fajfer specifically cites the necessity of creating the genre because he too often sees non-traditional literary works judged only as works of art, but not as literature. After conception, the idea was developed by Katarzyna Bazarnik who, basing her reflections on the analysis of the works by James Joyce, demonstrated that the similarity of the text and the form creates [[iconicity]]. By exploring and dynamically developing the study of iconicity, a common feature of liberature, Bazarnik contributed to the consideration of liberature in the literary community at large.

Fajfer's ‘liberature’ is in no immediate denotational relation with various earlier uses of the word, including the English legal synonym for “[[livery]]”, the name of a program of Czech Radio,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rozhlas.cz/radiowave/liberatura ''Liberatura''], Cesky rozhlas.&lt;/ref&gt; and the term coined by [[Julián Ríos]] for the novel ''Larva'' (1983).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dalkeyarchive.com/a-conversation-with-julian-rios-by-marie-lise-gazarian-gautier/ ''A Conversation with Julián Ríos.''] By Marie-Lise Gazarian Gautier. Dalkey Archive. Website. n.d.&lt;/ref&gt;

Considering liberature anachronistically, it is noteworthy that writers began experimenting with literary forms as early as in the [[Baroque]] period. The unusual structure of the works forces the readers to focus their attention, to choose the beginning and the end of the text, and – most importantly – form another level of [[Sign (semiotics)|signification]]. It is an invitation to play, act, and interact with the text; this enables the text to transcend the boundaries of a given work. Its form “does not only consider a literary text a symbolic expression of a person’s subjectivity but also considered a text as determined by the level of programming and processing of signs.”&lt;ref&gt;Jörgen Shäfer. "Literary Machines Made in Germany. German Proto‐Cybertexts from the Baroque Era to the Present." In CyberText Yearbook. Ergodic Histories. (University of Jyväskylä, 2006), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th and 18th centuries, word‐games (such as rebuses, palindromes, and anagrams), all of which date back to antiquity, were employed.  There were also text‐machines, texts that after being programmed were able to generate new texts. The similarity of various literary works from this period was a result of fashion, but also of using the same Latin books on poetry and rhetoric in which creating elaborate poetry, and later, prose, was one of the practice exercises.

The works that may be considered liberature ''avant la lettre'' were penned by such writers as [[William blake|William Blake]], [[Blaise Cendrars]], [[B. S. Johnson|B.S. Johnson]], [[James Joyce]], [[Stéphane Mallarmé]], [[Raymond Queneau]], [[Laurence Sterne]], or [[Stanisław Wyspiański]]. In the case of American postmodernist writers, [[Raymond Federman]], Robert Gass and [[Ronald Sukenick]] come to the fore of what can be called liberature.

In Poland, some of [[Radosław Nowakowski]]'s works predated the coinage of the term. Owing to discussions with Fajfer, Nowakowski found the term useful and started considering himself a writer of liberature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liberatorium.com/teksty/why.html ''Why Do I Make My Books The Way I Do?''], Radosław Nowakowski. Website. n.d.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Nowakowski’s most prominent works is ''[[Ulica Sienkiewicza w Kielcach]]'' (''Sienkiewicz Street in Kielce'') published in 2002. 
Another of Nowakowski’s books, ''[[Nieposkładana teoria sztuki]]'' (''Noncompleted Theory of Art''), first published in 1994, is composed of a pile of separate pages placed in a box which, according to the author, mirrors the “theory of puzzle[...] [w]ith the exception that not all of the elements fit[...]”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liberatorium.com |title=Radosław Nowakowski. Liberatorium |publisher=Liberatorium.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the works where Nowakowski provides the reader with three versions of the text – [[Polish language|Polish]], [[English language|English]] and [[Esperanto]] – one could observe certain differences in the rendition of the same topic, the technique which contributes to the further differentiation of the book’s meaning.

== Development of liberature in Poland ==

In an organized manner, liberature in Poland, including both Polish texts and translated work, has been presented in the Liberatura series published by [[Korporacja Ha!art]] seated in [[Cracow|Kraków]]. The first publications are:

(1) [[Katarzyna Bazarnik]] and [[Zenon Fajfer]]. ''(O)patrzenie.'' 2003.

(2) Zenon Fajfer. ''Spoglądając przez ozonową dziurę.'' 2004. Followed by its English translation, ''But Eyeing Like Ozone Whole.'' by [[Krzysztof Bartnicki]]. 2004.

(3) [[Stéphane Mallarmé]]. ''Rzut kośćmi nie zniesie przypadku.'' Polish translation of ''[[Un Coup de Dés Jamais N'Abolira Le Hasard (Mallarmé)|Un coup de des jamais n'abolira le hasard]]'' by [[Tomasz Różycki]]. 2005.

(4) [[Stanisław Czycz]]. ''Arw.'' 2007.

(19) [[James Joyce]]. ''Finneganów tren.'' Polish translation of ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' by [[Krzysztof Bartnicki]]. 2012.

== Jonathan Safran Foer ==

Liberature in the Anglo-Saxon countries is represented by [[Jonathan Safran Foer]]. Foer's hybrid, postmodern novel ''[[Tree of Codes]]'' (2010) is an example of visual writing, utilizing typesetting, images, spaces and blank pages to give the book a visual dimension beyond the prose narrative. Foer has taken his favorite book, ''[[The Street of Crocodiles]]'' by [[Bruno Schulz]], and used it as a canvas, cutting into and out of the pages, to arrive at an original new story. In one interview the author emphasises that, although the originality of the story brought to life in such an innovative way is a very compelling feature, it was the form of the book that captivated him the most: “[…] I was more interested in subtracting than adding, and also in creating a book with a three-dimensional life. On the brink of the end of paper, I was attracted to the idea of a book that can’t forget it has a body.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Heller |first=Steven |url=http://papercuts.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/24/jonathan-safran-foers-book-as-art-object/ |title=Steven Heller, Jonathan Safran Foer’s Book as Art Object |publisher=Papercuts.blogs.nytimes.com |date=2010-11-24 |accessdate=2012-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Liberature in other media ==

Although the authors creating liberature frequently apply the traditional ways of publication (chiefly paper books), they also appreciate other possibilities. Liberatic texts whose primary medium is the Internet are representative of ‘e-liberature’.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liberatura.pl/e-liberatura.html ''E-liberatura.''], Agnieszka Przybyszewska (cited). Małopolski Instytut Kultury. Website. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples include Radosław Nowakowski's works, such as the transformation of the hypertext model of the book by Nowakowski into [[Hala 1000 Ton]], set in the old Norblin’s factory ([[Warsaw]]) (2005). The project called [[Libro 2N]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kolekcja.bookart.pl/info/viewpub/tid/4/pid/310 |title=Radosław Nowakowski, Libro 2N |publisher=Kolekcja.bookart.pl |date=2009-09-21 |accessdate=2012-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; was defined as a "journey into [[Blini|BLIN]] concept", which was enacted inside a book represented by the old workshop.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12738">The '''[[Songwriters Hall of Fame]]''' was founded in 1969 by songwriter [[Johnny Mercer]] and music publishers [[Abe Olman]] and [[Howie Richmond]] to honor those whose work represents a spectrum of the most beloved songs from the world's popular music songbook. The Hall of Fame only existed as an online virtual collection until 2010, when it was first put on display as a physical gallery inside [[The Grammy Museum]] in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|publisher=Songwriters Hall of Fame|url=http://www.songhall.org/about/entry/about_us|accessdate=June 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mihai Dumitru Ralea''' (also known as '''Mihail Ralea''', '''Michel Raléa''', or '''Mihai Rale''';&lt;ref name="mstr586"&gt;Straje, p. 586&lt;/ref&gt; May 1, 1896 – August 17, 1964) was a [[Romania]]n social scientist, cultural journalist, and political figure. He debuted as an affiliate of [[Poporanism]], the left-wing [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] movement, which he infused with influences from [[corporatism]] and [[Marxism]]. A distinguished product of French academia, Ralea rejected traditionalism and welcomed cultural modernization, outlining the program for a secular and democratic "peasant state". His ideology blended into his scholarly work, with noted contributions to [[political sociology]], the [[sociology of culture]], and [[Social psychology|social]] and [[national psychology]]. He was a professor at the [[University of Iași]] and, from 1938, the [[University of Bucharest]].

By 1935, Ralea had become a doctrinaire of the [[National Peasants' Party]], managing ''[[Viața Românească]]'' review and ''[[Dreptatea]]'' daily. He had publicized polemics with the far-right circles and [[Fascism|fascist]] [[Iron Guard]], which he denounced as alien to the Romanian ethos. He later drifted apart from the party's centrist leadership and his own democratic ideology, setting up a [[Socialist Peasants' Party]], then embracing authoritarian politics. He was a founding member and [[Ministry of Labor, Family, and Social Protection (Romania)|Labor Minister]] of the dictatorial [[National Renaissance Front]], representing its corporatist left-wing. He fell from power in 1940, finding himself harassed by successive fascist regimes, and became a "[[fellow traveler]]" of the underground [[Romanian Communist Party|Communist Party]].

Ralea willingly cooperated with the communists and the [[Ploughmen's Front]] before and after their arrival to power, serving as [[Ministry of Culture and National Patrimony|Minister of Arts]], [[List of Ambassadors from Romania to the United States|Ambassador to the United States]], and vice president of the [[Great National Assembly]]. He was sidelined, then recovered, by the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]], and, as a [[Marxist humanism|Marxist humanist]], was one of its leading cultural ambassadors by 1960. Heavily controlled by [[Censorship in Communist Romania|communist censorship]], his work gave scientific credentials to the regime's [[Anti-Americanism|anti-American]] propaganda, though Ralea also used his position to protect some of those persecuted by the authorities.

Ralea's final contributions assisted in the re-professionalization of Romanian psychology and education, with the retention of a more liberal communist doctrine. Always an avid traveler and raconteur, he died abroad, while on mission to the [[UNESCO]]. He endures in cultural memory as a controversial figure. He is celebrated for his sociological and critical insights, but reprehended for his nepotism, his political choices, and his literary compromises. His only, and last, direct descendant was a daughter, Catinca Ralea, who achieved literary fame as a translator of Western literature.

==Biography==

===Early life and Poporanist beginnings===
A native of [[Huși]], [[Fălciu County]] (currently in [[Vaslui County]]), Ralea was the son of a Dumitru Ralea, a local magistrate, and Ecaterina Botezatu-Ralea.&lt;ref name="gc912"&gt;Călinescu, p. 912&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian Camelia Zavarache, Ralea's ethnic background was non-Romanian: on his father's side, he was a [[Bulgarians in Romania|Bulgarian]], while his mother was [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish]].&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 196–197. See also Moldovan, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; The family was relatively wealthy, and Dumitru had served as Fălciu representative in the [[Senate of Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; His son was always spiritually attached to his native region and, later in life, bought himself a vineyard on Dobrina Hill, just outside Huși, building himself a vacation home.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 125; (2010), p. 385; Zavarache, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; Huși was where he completed his primary education, before he moved on to the urban center of [[Iași]], where he enlisted at [[boarding school]] (''Liceul Internat'').&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 912; Vianu, p. 143; Zavarache, pp. 197–198, 199&lt;/ref&gt; He was colleagues with another future sociologist, [[D. I. Suchianu]]. The two remained personal and political friends for the rest of their lives.&lt;ref name="ln(10)129"&gt;Nastasă (2010), p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; Another enduring friendship was formed on school grounds between Ralea and historian [[Petre Constantinescu-Iași]], who became Ralea's main connection to the revolutionary left.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 197–198, 199, 238&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea went on to attend the [[University of Bucharest]] Faculty of Letters and Philosophy, under [[Constantin Rădulescu-Motru]] (who shortlisted and prepared Ralea for academic tenure).&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 191–192, 293, 344&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut in publishing during 1916, with an essay in Rădulescu-Motru's ''Revista de Filozofie'',&lt;ref name="tv144"&gt;Vianu, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; and with ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'' articles that he usually signed with the initials ''M. R.'' (an alternative signature he would use for the rest of his career).&lt;ref&gt;Straje, pp. 406, 586&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea was university colleagues with philosophers [[Tudor Vianu]] and [[Nicolae Bagdasar]], with whom he remained close friends for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 283. See also Vianu, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; Their studies were interrupted by the [[Romania in World War I|Romanian Campaign of World War I]], during which time Ralea relocated to Iași. He took his final examination in Law and Letters at the [[University of Iași]], in 1918.&lt;ref name="gc912"/&gt; His professors included the culture critic [[Garabet Ibrăileanu]], who became Ralea's mentor.&lt;ref name="zavr187–188"&gt;Zavarache, pp. 187–188&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea recalled that his first encounter with Ibrăileanu was "my life's greatest intellectual event".&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;

Described by Vianu as a "young luminary" with "new and original ideas", "always surrounded by a sizable pack of students",&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea returned to cultural journalism in postwar [[Greater Romania]]. From February 1919, he was a contributor to the Iași-based review ''Însemnări Literare'', which stood in for the temporarily disestablished ''[[Viața Românească]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 114; Nicolescu, p. 131. See also Desa ''et al.'' (1987), pp. 508–509&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine was managed by the novelist [[Mihail Sadoveanu]] and heavily influenced by Ibrăileanu. Their friendship sealed Ralea's affiliation to prewar [[Poporanism]], a leftist current which promoted [[agrarianism]], "national specificity", and art with a social mission. The ''Însemnări Literare'' group also recognized that Poporanism was made inadequate by the social promises of [[Land reform in Romania|land reform]] and [[universal male suffrage]]. These policies, Ibrăileanu acknowledged, "settled a debt" with the peasantry.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolescu, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; Poporanism was generally pro-[[Westernization]], with a noted reserve; taken separately, Ralea was the most pro-Western, socialist, and least culturally conservative thinker of this category.&lt;ref&gt;Balázs Trencsényi, "Conceptualizarea caracterului național în tradiția intelectuală românească", in Neumann &amp; Heinen, pp. 353–354; Verdery, pp. 50–51, 53, 328&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1919, Ralea and his new friend, [[Andrei Oțetea]], earned state scholarships to complete his doctorate in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 190–192, 250, 284&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea entered the [[École Normale Supérieure]] as a disciple of [[Lucien Herr]],&lt;ref name="tv144"/&gt; simultaneously registering for doctoral programs in letters and politics, with interests in sociology and psychology. He studied under the [[Structural functionalism|functionalist]] [[Célestin Bouglé]], then under [[Paul Fauconnet]] and [[Lucien Lévy-Bruhl]], and later, at the [[Collège de France]], under [[Pierre Janet]].&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 191–192, 293&lt;/ref&gt; As he himself recounted, he became a passionate follower of the [[French Left]], a reader of [[Jean Jaurès]], and a guest of [[Léon Blum]]'s.&lt;ref name="istnm28"&gt;Stanomir, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; He defined himself as a [[Rationalism|rationalist]], heir to the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and the [[French Revolution]],&lt;ref name="istnm28"/&gt; and was ostensibly an [[Atheism|atheist]].&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), p. 422&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea's secular agenda was underscored when he joined the [[Freemasonry in Romania|Romanian Freemasonry]], which, historian Lucian Nastasă writes, implied a commitment to [[freethought]] and religious toleration.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

For a while, Ralea managed a Romanian restaurant owned by the banker [[Aristide Blank]].&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; He was part of a tight cell of Romanian students in letters or history, which also included Oțetea, [[Gheorghe Brătianu]], and [[Alexandru Rosetti]], who remained close friends over the decades.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 250, 284, 293, 345–347&lt;/ref&gt; Suchianu and his sister Ioana, who were also studying in Paris, lived in the same boarding house as Ralea.&lt;ref name="ln(10)129"/&gt;

===Debut as theoretician===
With funds raised by a Support Committee that included Ralea,&lt;ref&gt;Ilie Th. Riga, Gheorghe Călin, ''Dr. Fr. I. Rainer'', [[Editura Științifică]], Bucharest, 1966, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; ''Viața Românească'' was eventually revived by Ibrăileanu. Ralea became its foreign correspondent, sending in articles about the intellectual life and philosophical doctrines of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]],&lt;ref name="ln(09)192"&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; and possibly the first Romanian notices about the work of [[Marcel Proust]].&lt;ref name="ccproust"&gt;{{ro icon}} Constantin Coroiu, [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/COROIUoct12.htm "Proust și romanul românesc modern"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', October 2012&lt;/ref&gt; He traveled extensively, studying first-hand the cultural life of France, Belgium, Italy, and [[Weimar Republic|Weimar Germany]].&lt;ref name="ln(09)192"/&gt;

In 1922, Ralea took his ''[[Habilitation|Docteur d'État]]'' degree (the sixth Romanian to ever qualify for it)&lt;ref name="ln(09)192"/&gt; with ''L'idée de la révolution dans les doctrines socialistes'' ("The Idea of Revolution in Socialist Doctrines"). Under the [[Francization|Francized]] name ''Michel Raléa'', he published it at Rivière company in 1923. ''L'idée de la révolution...'' theorized that, in order to be classified as a revolution, a social movement needed at once a "social body", an "ideal", and a "transfer of power"—depending on which trait was prevailing, revolutions were, respectively, "organic", "programmatic", or "means-based".&lt;ref&gt;Herseni, p. 546&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of his attention was [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], whom he rediscovered (and criticized) as a proponent of "class solidarity" and [[nonviolent revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Ghiață, pp. 101–102&lt;/ref&gt; The work earned Ralea the [[Institut de France]]'s [[Prix Osiris]]&lt;ref name="tv144"/&gt; and a [[Doctor of Letters]] degree in 1923.&lt;ref name="gc912"/&gt; He spent another several months frequenting [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin University]] lectures.&lt;ref name="ln(09)192"/&gt; It was there that he first met a future enemy, the poet-mathematician [[Ion Barbu]]. The latter left a corrosive record of their first encounter, dismissing Ralea as a "clown" with "aristocratic manias".&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his return to Romania, Ralea began publishing his political and sociological essays in reviews such as ''Fapta'', ''[[Ideea Europeană]]'', and ''[[Gândirea]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 76; Desa ''et al.'' (1987), p. 469; Straje, p. 586&lt;/ref&gt; He was also involved with [[Dimitrie Gusti]] and [[Virgil Madgearu]]'s Romanian Social Institute, publishing his texts in its ''Arhiva pentru Știință și Reformă Socială''. In 1923, it hosted his essay on "The Issue of Societal Classification" and his critical review of German sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Gusti, pp. 16, 17&lt;/ref&gt; While still in Paris, Ralea was confident that he would find employment: the University of Iași Chair of Sociology had been set aside for him by Rădulescu-Motru, with Ibrăileanu's approval.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 293, 344&lt;/ref&gt; The matter was complicated when another Paris graduate, [[Garabet Aslan]], ran for the same position. Supported by Ibrăileanu and Gusti, Ralea was eventually moved to the Logic and Modern Philosophy Department, as an assistant professor to [[Ion Petrovici]], while also employed as lecturer in [[social pedagogy]].&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 344–345, 347, 483&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ralea's own words, this was a "ridiculous" situation: most of his students were girls, some of whom were infatuated with him.&lt;ref name="ln(09)483"&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 483&lt;/ref&gt; He had married Ioana Suchianu in November 1923, while still in Bucharest, and lived with her in a small apartment above the ''Viața Românească'' offices.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), pp. 150, 200–201, 266&lt;/ref&gt;

For the next two years, Ralea diversified his qualifications with the goal of obtaining employment in his main field. He published the tract ''Formația ideii de personalitate'' ("How the Notion of Personality Is Formed"), noted as a pioneering introduction to [[behavioural genetics]].&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 345&lt;/ref&gt; On January 1, 1926, following good referrals from Petrovici (and despite the preference of psychology students, who favored C. Fedeleș), Ralea was appointed Professor of Psychology and Aesthetics at Iași University.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 345–346, 347, 374&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea soon became one of ''Viața Românească''{{'}}s ideologues and polemicists, as well as architect of its satire column, ''Miscellanea'' (alongside Suchianu and, initially, [[George Topîrceanu]]).&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; By 1925, he was also regularly featured in the left-wing daily ''[[Adevărul]]'', and its cultural supplement, ''[[Adevărul Literar și Artistic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Desa ''et al.'' (2003), pp. 17, 18&lt;/ref&gt; His essays were taken up by other cultural magazines throughout Romania, including ''[[Kalende]]'' of [[Pitești]] and ''Minerva'' of Iași.&lt;ref&gt;Desa ''et al.'' (2003), pp. 557, 619–620&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927, when Ralea published his ''Contribuțiuni la știința societății'' ("Contributions to Social Science") and ''Introducere în sociologie'' ("Companion to Sociology"),&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 1025; Herseni, p. 542&lt;/ref&gt; Gusti's Social Institute had Ralea as a guest speaker, with a lecture on "Social Education".&lt;ref&gt;Gusti, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; At around that time, with Gusti as president of the [[Romanian Radio Broadcasting Company|Broadcasting Company]], Ralea became a frequent presence on the radio.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 523&lt;/ref&gt;

In his columns and essays, Ralea defended Ibrăileanu's "national specificity" against criticism from the new-wave [[Literary modernism|modernists]] at ''[[Sburătorul]]''. [[Eugen Lovinescu]], the modernist ideologue, had reconnected with 19th-century [[classical liberalism]], rejecting Poporanism as a nationalist, culturally isolationist, and [[Socialization (economics)|socializing]] phenomenon. Lovinescu and Ralea denounced each other's politics as [[reactionary]].&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, pp. 39, 128, 133; E. Lovinescu, pp. 116–119&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea opined that Poporanist ideas were still culturally relevant, and not in fact isolationist, since they provided a recipe for "originality"; as he put it, "national specificity" had become inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolescu, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict was not just political: Ralea also objected to modernist aesthetics, from the pure poetry cultivated by ''Sburătorul'' to the more radical [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] of ''[[Contimporanul]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, pp. 123–124, 128, 133–135, 140&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea was not an anti-modernist, but rather a particular modernist. According to his friend and colleague [[Octav Botez]], he was an "integrally modern man" in tastes and behavior, "one of the few philosophers who conceived of, and lived, their lives as regular people, with a naturalness and facility that were charming and stimulating."&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 483–484&lt;/ref&gt; The same was also noted by ''Contimporanul'' writer [[Sergiu Dan]], who proposed that Ralea denied himself "all sort of transaction with the confuse world of sentiment".&lt;ref name="sdan184"&gt;Dan, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea's literary columns very often promoted modernist writers, or modernist interpretations of classical ones, such as when he used Janet's psychology to explain the genesis of works by [[Thomas Hardy]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 911; Vianu, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; More famous was his reading of Proust through [[Henri Bergson]]'s [[Matter and Memory|classification of memory]].&lt;ref name="ccproust"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gc911"&gt;Călinescu, p. 911&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea offered much praise to rationalist modernists such as [[Alexandru A. Philippide]], and hailed [[Tudor Arghezi]], the eclectic modernizer of poetic language, as Romania's greatest poet of the day.&lt;ref&gt;Constantinescu, p. 227; Crohmălniceanu, p. 140. See also M. Lovinescu, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea (and, before him, Ibrăileanu) campaigned for [[social realism]] in prose. His natural favorite was Sadoveanu, but he was also enthusiastic about modernist novels with a flavor of social radicalism, including those by ''Sburătorul''{{'}}s [[Hortensia Papadat-Bengescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, pp. 180, 253, 397, 406, 414&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ralea vs. ''Gândirea''===
With the Lovinescu–Ralea debate occupying the center stage at ''Viața Românească'' and ''Sburătorul'', a new intellectual movement, critical of both modernism and Poporanism, was emerging in the cultural life of Greater Romania. Led by poet-theologian [[Nichifor Crainic]], this group took over at ''Gândirea'', turning the magazine against its former ''Viața Românească'' allies.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, pp. 76–77, 96–97&lt;/ref&gt; As pointed out by Lovinescu, Ralea was initially welcoming of Crainic's "remarkable" program.&lt;ref&gt;E. Lovinescu, pp. 123–124&lt;/ref&gt; He did not object to Crainic's [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]] devotion (seeing it as compatible with secularism and "national specificity"), but mainly to his [[national conservatism]], which worshiped the historical past.&lt;ref&gt;E. Lovinescu, pp. 123–128&lt;/ref&gt; Like other Poporanists, Ralea adopted [[left-wing nationalism]], arguing that the very concept of nation was a product of French radicalism: "[It] emerged from the great French Revolution, the modest ideology of the bourgeoisie. [...] What's more, we may claim that only a democracy can truly be nationalistic."&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Bochmann, "Conceptul de patriotism în cultura română", in Neumann &amp; Heinen, p. 124; Ornea (1995), pp. 65, 351&lt;/ref&gt; He credited the core ideas of [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|Romanian liberalism]], according to which [[National awakening of Romania|Romanian national awareness]] was an afterthought of [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobinism]]: "We have had to visit France to find out we're Romanians."&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1995), p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by scholar Balázs Trencsényi: "Ralea sought to separate the study of national specificity, which he considered to be legitimate, from the exhortation of national particulars, which he rejected."&lt;ref&gt;Balázs Trencsényi, "Conceptualizarea caracterului național în tradiția intelectuală românească", in Neumann &amp; Heinen, p. 353&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, ''Gândirea'' hosted the inflammatory "White Lily" Manifesto. It signaled the Poporanists' confrontation with a "new generation" of anti-rationalists, and Ralea's personal rivalry with one of the White Lily intellectuals, [[Petre Pandrea]].&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt; Pandrea's Manifesto was at once a plea for [[aestheticism]] and [[mysticism]], a critique of "that famed social justice" idea, and an explicit denunciation of Ralea, Ibrăileanu, Suchianu and the ''Sburătorul'' group as "dry", "barren", all too critical.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, pp. 88–89&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea answered with half-satirical comments: the country, he noted, could do without "prophets" with "fun and interesting biases", but not without "liberty, paved roads, justice and cleanliness in the streets".&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; In his view, the Manifesto authors were modern-day [[Rasputin]]s, prone to fanatical vandalism.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

From that moment on, Crainic's Orthodox spirituality and traditionalism made a slow transition into far-right politics. Their rejection of democracy became another issue of dispute, with Ralea noting, in 1930, that "all civilized countries are democratic; all semi-civilized or primitive countries are dictatorial."&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1995), p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, ''Gândirists'' produced more and more systematic attacks on Ralea's ideology, condemning its atheism, "[[historical materialism]]", and [[Francophilia]].&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, pp. 97, 102&lt;/ref&gt; In reply, Ralea noted that, beyond their facade, national and religious conservatism meant a reinstatement of primitive customs, [[obscurantism]], [[Neoplatonism]], and [[Byzantinism]].&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, pp. 124, 127, 130–132&lt;/ref&gt; He pushed the envelope by demanding a program of forced Westernization and secularization, to mirror [[Kemalism]].&lt;ref name="gc973"&gt;Călinescu, p. 973&lt;/ref&gt;

His comments also challenged the grounding of ''Gândirist'' theory: Romanian Orthodoxy, he noted, was part of an international Orthodox phenomenon that mainly included [[Slavs]], whereas many Romanians were [[Romanian Church United with Rome, Greek-Catholic|Greek-Catholic]]. He concluded, therefore, that Orthodoxy could never claim synonymy with the Romanian ethos.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, pp. 127–128; Ornea (1995), p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea also insisted that, despite its nativist [[Anti-Western sentiment|anti-Western]] claims, Orthodox religiousness was a modern "trifle", that owed inspiration to [[Hermann Graf Keyserling|Keyserling]]'s [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] and [[Jean Cocteau|Cocteau]]'s Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 132; Ornea (1995), pp. 81–83&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained that Romanian peasants, whose religiousness was exhorted by Crainic, were "superstitious, but atheistic", not respectful "of any spiritual value when it should compete with their logical instincts." No other people, he contented, was as blasphemous as Romanians when it came to [[Romanian profanity|profanities]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1995), p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea collected his critical essays as a set of volumes: ''Comentarii și sugestii'' ("Comments and Suggestions"), ''Interpretări'' ("Interpretations"), ''Perspective'' ("Perspectives").&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 1025; Crohmălniceanu, pp. 187–188, 586, 598, 616&lt;/ref&gt; He was still involved in psychological research, with tracts such as ''Problema inconștientului'' ("The Problem of the Unconscious Mind") and ''Ipoteze și precizări privind știința sufletului'' ("Hypotheses and Précis Regarding Spiritual Science").&lt;ref name="gc1025"&gt;Călinescu, p. 1025&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea also resumed his European travels, touring the [[Restoration (Spain)|Kingdom of Spain]], and was unenthusiastic about its conservatism. Ralea's travelogue, ''Memorial din Spania'', depicts the country as a reactionary bulwark of "somber priests" and "festooned soldiers".&lt;ref name="sdan184"/&gt; Another ''Memorial'', serialized by ''Adevărul Literar și Artistic'', detailed his trips through [[Germanic-speaking Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp. 912, 1025&lt;/ref&gt;

===PNȚ deputy and ''Viața Românească'' editor===
Shortly before the [[Romanian general election, 1928|election of December 1928]], Ralea was attracted into the [[National Peasants' Party]] (PNȚ), speaking out against the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal]] political class as "an abnormal regime of corruption and brutality."&lt;ref&gt;[[Octavian Tăslăuanu]], "Ce scriu tinerii despre România", in ''[[Țara Noastră]]'', Nr. 28/1928, pp. 898–899&lt;/ref&gt; He successfully contested a seat in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Assembly of Deputies]], and was [[Romanian general election, 1931|reelected in 1933]]; during that interval, he also presided upon Fălciu's party chapter.&lt;ref name="zavr189"&gt;Zavarache, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea was one of a compact group of National Peasantist academics in Poporanist Iași, together with Botez, Oțetea, [[Constantin Balmuș]], [[Iorgu Iordan]], [[Petre Andrei]], [[Traian Bratu]], and [[Traian Ionașcu]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 100, 131&lt;/ref&gt; Inside the party, Ralea was a follower of the Poporanist founding figure, [[Constantin Stere]], but did not follow Stere's "[[Democratic Peasants' Party–Stere|Democratic Peasantist]]" dissidence of 1930.&lt;ref name="ggglose2"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Gheorghe Grigurcu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/glose_la_petre_pandrea_ii "Glose la Petre Pandrea (II)"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 25/2004&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1929, Ralea was a noted contributor to the party press organ ''Acțiunea Țărănistă'' and to [[Tudor Teodorescu-Braniște|Teodorescu-Braniște]]'s ''Revista Politică''.&lt;ref&gt;Desa ''et al.'' (2003), pp. 16, 822&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1933, Ibrăileanu retired, leaving Ralea and literary critic [[George Călinescu]] as editors of ''Viața Românească''.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1998), p. 146; Piru, pp. 162–163&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea eventually affiliated with the centrist current of the PNȚ, distancing himself from those party factions who were tempted by socialism.&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p. 126. See also Ornea (1995), pp. 119, 295&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea and Ibrăileanu still promoted the vision of a "peasant state", accepting socialist [[reformism]], but still cautious of socialist industrialization, and rejected outright the idea of [[Dictatorship of the proletarian|proletarian primacy]]. Criticized by the communist left as "outstanding shortsightedness",&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; this ideological position came to define the PNȚ in the mid 1930s. Ralea defended classical parliamentarianism at several [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] meetings, including the 1933 conference in the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republic of Spain]], but insisted on the benefits of [[statism]] and a [[planned economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5448104j/ ''Compte rendu de la XXIXe conférence tenue à Madrid du 4 au 10 octobre 1933''], Éditions Payot, Lausanne, 1934, pp. 582–588&lt;/ref&gt;

By then, Ralea was leaving behind his sociological research. As noted by his friend Botez, he showed himself to be "absent-minded and preoccupied most of all with politics."&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 69–70&lt;/ref&gt; Botez noted that Ralea was showing signs of [[hyperactivity]], seemingly incapable of concentrating during formal functions.&lt;ref name="ln(09)483"/&gt; He became infamous as one of the "traveling professors",&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 297&lt;/ref&gt; who lived in Bucharest and only taught the minimum of classes allowed in Iași—one of his return trips to Iași, in 1936, was for the funeral ceremony of his mentor Ibrăileanu.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), pp. 475–476; Piru, pp. 170–171&lt;/ref&gt; He now owned an Iași townhouse and a villa in Bucharest's Filipescu Park.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), pp. 201, 391&lt;/ref&gt; Although lovingly married to Ioana, he had begun an affair with another woman, Marcela Simionescu.&lt;ref name="ln(10)266-267"&gt;Nastasă (2010), pp. 266–267&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea's energies were also drawn into administrative disputes and professional rivalries. Alongside Brătianu, he fought to obtain Oțetea a permanent seat at the University of Iași, at the expense of PNȚ colleague [[Ioan Hudiță]].&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 250, 403, 406&lt;/ref&gt; He tried to do the same for Rosetti, but was met with the stiff opposition of linguist [[Giorge Pascu]].&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 302–303&lt;/ref&gt; Hudiță was particularly vexed by these maneuvers, and, in 1934, asked for a formal inquiry by [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]], and even for a formal review of Ralea's own 1926 appointment.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 406&lt;/ref&gt; More privately, Hudiță also claimed that Ralea was having affairs with his female students, and even with younger girls who presented to Ralea for their [[Romanian Baccalaureate|baccalaureate examination]].&lt;ref name="ln(10)266-267"/&gt; Such criticism did not dissuade Ralea. In 1937, he also managed to obtain an Iași University chair for Călinescu, in controversial circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 393–394&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1934 to March 1938,&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Diego Ciobotaru, [http://www.historia.ro/exclusiv_web/general/articol/cum-au-vazut-taranistii-restauratia-lui-carol-al-ii-lea "Cum au văzut țărăniștii restaurația lui Carol al II-lea"], in ''Historia'', February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea was also editor of the main PNȚ newspaper, ''[[Dreptatea]]''. He contributed its political editorials, answering to criticism from the right. In February 1935, he co-authored and published the new PNȚ Party Program, which rendered explicit the goal of transforming Romania into a "peasant state".&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1995), pp. 119–120&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Dreptatea'', addressing ''[[Universul]]'' editor [[Pamfil Șeicaru]], Ralea dismissed suspicions that the "peasant state" signified a "simplistic domination" or a dictatorship of the peasantry. He maintained that the notion simply implied "a juster distribution of the national income", and the "collective" but peaceful "redemption of an entire class."&lt;ref&gt;Niculae ''et al.'', pp. 204–206&lt;/ref&gt;

===Against the Iron Guard===
Ralea's time at ''Dreptatea'' overlapped with the emergence of [[fascism]], whose leading Romanian representatives were members of the [[Iron Guard]]. This violent movement had been temporarily banned in 1931, by order of a PNȚ [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Romania)|Interior Minister]], [[Ion Mihalache]]. Mihalache's ban followed repeated requests by the party's left-wingers, Ralea included.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1995), p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea had his own brush with the Guard in late 1932, when he was presiding upon symposiums on French literature at ''[[Criterion (literary society)|Criterion Society]]''. One of the sessions, focusing on [[André Gide]], was interrupted, on Crainic's instigation, by Guardsmen under [[Mihai Stelescu]], who assaulted ''Criterion'' activists and created a bustle.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Irina Manea, [http://www.historia.ro/exclusiv_web/general/articol/criterion-o-istorie "Criterion – o istorie"], in ''Historia'', May 2014; Ornea (1995), pp. 152–153&lt;/ref&gt; By 1933, Ralea had quarreled with the ''Criterion'' cell, which had since adopted "new generation" idealism and sympathy for the Iron Guard.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1995), p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; In private, he also dismissed the Guard's new convert and ideologue, [[Nae Ionescu]], as a "trickster" and a "barber".&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of Romanian fascism became stringent after the Guard assassinated [[Prime Minister of Romania|Romanian Premier]] [[Ion G. Duca]]. In his articles, Ralea described the National Liberal administration as "insane and degenerate" for continuing to tolerate the Guard's existence, instead of jailing its leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1995), p. 305&lt;/ref&gt; At ''Dreptatea'', protesting against the Guard's assault of the leftist intellectual [[Alexandru Graur]], Ralea decried fascism in Romania as an "[[The Island of Doctor Moreau|island of Doctor Moreau]]", an experiment in the growth of "blind and absurd mysticism".&lt;ref&gt;Niculae ''et al.'', pp. 232–233&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, 161 of Ralea's essays were collected and published at [[Editura Fundațiilor Regale]] as ''Valori'' ("Values"). They predicted the emergence of a stable civilization, conformist and [[Collectivism|collectivist]], whose great merit was the elimination of careerism.&lt;ref&gt;Dan, pp. 184–186&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea synthesized his critique of fascism in the 1935 essays on "The Right's Doctrine", taken up by ''Dreptatea'' and ''Viața Românească''. These texts described the far-right and fascism as parasitical phenomena, feeding on democracy's errors, with an ignorant mindset, incapable of subtlety.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 119; Ornea (1995), pp. 64–65, 350–352&lt;/ref&gt; His assessments were countercriticized by Guardist intellectual [[Toma Vlădescu]], in the newspaper ''[[Porunca Vremii]]''. According to Vlădescu, the "right-wing ideology" existed as an expression of the "human equilibrium", and, at its very core, was antisemitic.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1995), pp. 351–352&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of [[Nazi Germany]] and the invigoration of European fascism, Ralea was again moving to the left, cooperating with the [[Romanian Social Democratic Party (1927-1948)|Social Democratic Party]] (PSDR). In 1936, at ''Dreptatea'', he condemned the [[Remilitarization of the Rhineland|German march into Rhineland]] as a bad omen and an attack on world peace.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Prisăcaru, "Rhineland Crisis: The First 'Milestone' to the Second World War. Romanian Authorities and Media Reactions", in ''Romanian Military Thinking'', Nr. 4/2013, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; He became one of the PNȚ men affiliated with [[Robert Cecil, 1st Viscount Cecil of Chelwood|Lord Cecil]]'s International Peace Campaign, which, in Romania, was dominated by PSDR militants.&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, pp. 444–445&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, with an obituary piece to the "martyr" Stere, he defended Poporanism from accusations of "[[Bolshevik]]" subservience. Bolshevism, he argued, was impossible in Romania.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lovinescu, pp. 74, 396&lt;/ref&gt; However, he himself had established a working relationship with the outlawed [[Romanian Communist Party]] (PCdR), who was also interested in other PNȚ antifascists (one of them was the White Lily's Pandrea, who had since joined the National Peasantist left current).&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, pp. 126, 133, 137, 143–144; Tismăneanu, pp. 99, 299, 312&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea also allowed PCdR intellectuals such as [[Ștefan Voicu]] and [[Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu]] to publish essays in ''Viața Românească'', and hosted news about social life and culture in the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, pp. 118–119. See also Zavarache, pp. 199–200&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the PCdR acknowledged him as one of the intellectuals who could be trusted with "fulfilling the bourgeois revolution in Romania."&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, pp. 119–120&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1937, at the PNȚ Youth Conference in [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]], Ralea spoke of the "peasant state" as a "[[neo-nationalist]]" application of [[democratic socialism]], opposed to fascism, and in natural solidarity with the trade unions. He felt confident that this alliance would be powerful enough to outweigh fashionable [[totalitarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;"Conferințele tineretului național-țărănist la Cluj", in ''Țara de Mâine'', Nr. 1–2/1937, pp. 58, 60–62&lt;/ref&gt; During April of that year, Ralea and his Iași colleagues expressed public solidarity with his old Poporanist friend Sadoveanu, whose books were being burned by far-right militants.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 78–80; Ornea (1995), p. 462&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea's own sociological work was falling under Guardist scrutiny: in December, ''[[Buna Vestire]]'' hosted a piece by [[Horia Stamatu]], which referred to Ralea's contribution as "unhinged", and to Ralea personally as "kike-turned", "at odds with the new man".&lt;ref&gt;Valentin Săndulescu, "Convertiri și reconvertiri: elite academice și culturale și schimbare politică în România anilor 1930–1960", in Cristian Vasile (ed.), ''"Ne trebuie oameni!".

===Becoming Carol's minister===

The [[Romanian general election, 1937|December 1937 election]] toned down Ralea's anti-Guard militancy: the PNȚ had a non-aggression pact with the Guardsmen. Consequently, Ralea campaigned in his native [[Fălciu County]] alongside the movement's candidates, in terms he would later describe as "cordial".&lt;ref&gt;Popescu-Cadem, p. 313&lt;/ref&gt; His apparent compromise with the Guard is one of the most serious charges in Pandrea's later criticism of Ralea.&lt;ref name="ggglose2"/&gt; The tied elections, and the successes of the Guard, prompted the authoritarian [[King of Romania|King]] [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]] to increase his participation in politics, beyond his [[royal prerogative]]. Identified as one of the PNȚ "turncoats",&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, p. 456&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea sealed a surprising deal with Carol II and Premier [[Miron Cristea]] (the [[Patriarch of All Romania|Patriarch of Romania]]), becoming the country's [[Ministry of Labor, Family, and Social Protection (Romania)|Minister of Labor]]. He was promptly stripped of his PNȚ membership, and inaugurated his own party, the exceedingly minor [[Socialist Peasants' Party]] (PSȚ).&lt;ref name="mpîntâlniri"&gt;{{ro icon}} Marin Pop, [https://web.archive.org/web/20140714162339/http://www.caietesilvane.ro/indexcs.php?cmd=articol&amp;idart=1954 "Întâlniri secrete între Iuliu Maniu, Nicolae D.

Historians tend to describe Ralea's attitude toward Carol as "servile",&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), p. 348&lt;/ref&gt; and Ralea himself as Carol's "pocket Socialist"&lt;ref&gt;Seton-Watson, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; or "intellectual trophy".&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea himself claimed that the king cultivated his friendship as a likable "communist", though, as Camelia Zavarache argues, there is no secondary proof to attest that Ralea was ever part of Carol's ''[[camarilla]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 189–190&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iuliu Maniu]], the PNȚ chief and leader of the semi-clandestine democratic opposition, suggested that Ralea had "not a trace of character" to compliment his intellectual gifts.&lt;ref name="mpîntâlniri"/&gt; At the time, PNȚ activists began collecting evidence that Ralea was not an ethnic Romanian, which meant that he could no longer hold public office under the [[Romanianization]] laws.&lt;ref name="Zavarache, p. 197"&gt;Zavarache, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea himself was involved in the Romanianization campaign: in late 1938, he accepted [[Wilhelm Filderman]]'s proposal for [[Fifth Aliyah|the mass emigration of Romanian Jews]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Aurel Vainer]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20160416040538/https://www.jewishfed.ro/downloads/realitatea/RE442-443.pdf "Contribuția evreimii române la Așezământul Muncii în Ereț Israel"], in ''[[Realitatea Evreiască]]'', Nr. 442–443, January 2015, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1938, Ralea became a founding member of Carol's [[One-party state|single party]], the [[National Renaissance Front]] (FRN).&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 133–134&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment offered him several honors, including a reprint of his works by the ministry press.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 188–190&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his ministerial appointment, Ralea became Royal Resident, or governor, of [[Ținutul Prut]], a new administrative region incorporating parts of Western Moldavia and [[Bessarabia]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Popescu, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; He was created a Knight 2nd Class of the ''[[Meritul Cultural]]'' Order,&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; publishing, at Editura Fundațiilor Regale, the volume ''Psihologie și vieață'' ("Psychology and Life").&lt;ref name="gc1025"/&gt; Toward the end of 1938, Ralea moved from his old chair at the University of Iași and took up a similar position at his Bucharest alma mater.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 293, 343, 447; Zavarache, pp. 190, 197&lt;/ref&gt; Vianu was the assistant professor, lecturing in specialized aesthetics and literary criticism, and in practice taking over all of Ralea's classes.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 283–284, 447&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Lucian Boia]] argues: "Of all the king's dictatorship dignitaries, one may count Mihai Ralea as the most left-wing."&lt;ref name="lb141"&gt;Boia, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; In Ralea's own view, the FRN regime was, overall, progressive: "I had inaugurated a corpus of social reforms that were approved by the working class."&lt;ref&gt;Popescu-Cadem, p. 314&lt;/ref&gt; As noted in 1945 by political scientist [[Hugh Seton-Watson]], there was a cynical side to Ralea's reform-mindedness: "however much [the average Romanian intellectual] cursed the regime, he was grateful to it for one thing. It stood between him and the great, dirty, primitive, disinherited masses, whose 'Bolshevik' desire for Social Justice threatened his comforts."&lt;ref&gt;Seton-Watson, pp. 211–212&lt;/ref&gt; His time in office brought the creation of a workers' leisure service, ''[[Muncă și Voe Bună]]'', together with a Workers' University,&lt;ref name="sdmunivmun"&gt;"Necesitatea universităților muncitorești", in ''[[Societatea de Mâine]]'', Nr. 4/1939, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; a workers' theater, and a hostel for vacationing writers (''Casa Scriitorilor'').&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 140–143, 148&lt;/ref&gt; Nepotistic in his selection of a ministerial staff,&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), pp. 182, 225&lt;/ref&gt; by November 1939 his ministry was able to co-opt PSDR politicians such as [[George Grigorovici]]&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 141; Petrescu, p. 458, 459&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Stavri Cunescu]].&lt;ref name="sdmunivmun"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ițlbfurat"&gt;{{ro icon}} Ilarion Țiu, Lavinia Betea, [http://www.historia.ro/exclusiv_web/general/articol/cum-l-furat-ceausescu-regele-playboy "Cum l-a furat Ceaușescu pe Regele playboy"], in ''Historia'', online edition; retrieved July 1, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; He appropriated socialist propaganda, and attracted more or less sizable contributions from various centrists and left-wingers: Sadoveanu, Vianu, Suchianu, Philippide, as well as [[Demostene Botez]], [[Octav Livezeanu]], [[Victor Ion Popa]], [[Gala Galaction]], [[Barbu Lăzăreanu]], and [[Ion Pas]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 141–143, 146&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea's mandate was also a crossover of left-wing corporatism and fascism. In June 1938, he even visited Nazi Germany and had a formal meeting with his counterpart, [[Robert Ley]].&lt;ref name="lb141"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fmhoria"&gt;{{ro icon}} Florin Manolescu, [http://www.viataromaneasca.eu/arhiva/85_via-a-romaneasca-5-6-2013/80_istorie-i-literatura/1492_scriitori-romani-in-exil-vintila-horia-fata-cu-premiul-goncourt.html "Scriitori români în exil.

This was meant to undermine the leftist [[International Workers' Day|Workers' Day]] while showing the success of the FRN's worker [[guild]]s, and was partly inspired by Nazi festivities.&lt;ref name="ițlbfurat"/&gt; Nevertheless, the parade was voluntarily joined by militants of the underground PCdR, who found that it gave them am opportunity for chanting "democratic slogans".&lt;ref name="ițlbfurat"/&gt; In underground PSDR circles, as well as in inside the ministerial structures, rumors spread that Ralea was using secret funds at his discretion to sponsor various PCdR militants, including his schoolmate [[Petre Constantinescu-Iași]]; these stories were partly confirmed by Ralea himself.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 197–200, 201–202&lt;/ref&gt;

From March 1939, the premiership had passed to [[Armand Călinescu]], a former PNȚ politician. Ralea was his friend and confidant, and, as he later claimed, tried to keep Călinescu grounded in the face of "mythomaniacal" rumors.&lt;ref name="zoambasador"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Z. Ornea]], [http://www.romlit.ro/nsemnrile_unui_ambasador "Însemnările unui ambasador"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 6/2001&lt;/ref&gt; The FRN regime soon organized a massive clampdown of the Iron Guard. Ralea claimed to have protected Guardsmen employed by the Labor Ministry, and to have negotiated pardons for militants interned at [[Miercurea Ciuc]].&lt;ref&gt;Popescu-Cadem, pp. 313, 314&lt;/ref&gt; He obtained one such reprieve for Guardist historian [[P. P. Panaitescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 540&lt;/ref&gt; Himself a Guard sympathizer, [[Ion Barbu]] later claimed that Ralea was behind his marginalization in academia.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 189; Popescu-Cadem, pp. 332, 342&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea was also accused by Pandrea of having done nothing to prevent the arrest of his former ''Dreptatea'' colleague, the anti-Carol PNȚ-ist Madgearu.&lt;ref name="ggglose2"/&gt;

On September 21, 1939, following a spree of extrajudicial killings ordered by government, an [[Iron Guard death squads|Iron Guard death squad]] took its revenge, assassinating Premier Călinescu. Ralea, Andrei, and other former PNȚ-ists preserved their governmental posts as the premiership passed to [[Constantin Argetoianu]], then to [[Gheorghe Tătărescu]].&lt;ref&gt;"Guvern nou", in ''Unirea. Foaie Bisericească'', December 2, 1939, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea was also given new responsibilities within the FRN structure, becoming president of its regional chapter in [[Ținutul Mării]].&lt;ref&gt;Moldovan, pp. 359, 369–372&lt;/ref&gt;

===Downfall and harassment===
[[File:Sala de Consiliu -- Primim &amp; mobilizare.jpg|thumb|250px|Ralea's vote on the [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|Soviet ultimatum]] and mobilization, registered on Romanian government stationary, alongside those of his cabinet colleagues]] 
Meanwhile, the outbreak of World War II caught Romania isolated from either the [[Axis Powers]] and the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]]. During the [[Battle of France]], the FRN regime itself was divided between partisans of a détente with Germany and Francophiles such as Ralea. As witnessed by the Swiss diplomat [[René de Weck]], Ralea was restating his ''Valori'' ethos at cabinet meetings, in front of Axis representatives, declaring that the Allies stood for "humanistic civilization".&lt;ref name="zoambasador"/&gt; Former PCdR activists still enjoyed access to Ralea, through Constantinescu-Iași. In May 1940, the latter tried to create a bridge of communications between the Labor Minister and the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p. 118; Zavarache, pp. 199–201&lt;/ref&gt; Various reports on both sides confirm that Ralea was in permanent contact with Soviet diplomats, arranged for him by Constantinescu-Iași and [[Belu Zilber]].&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 200–201&lt;/ref&gt;

Just a month later, the Soviets issued an ultimatum, demanding that Romania cede Bessarabia. During the deliberations, Ralea voted in favor of Argetoianu's proposal: withdrawing from the region and mobilizing the army on the [[Prut River|Prut]], in preparation of a future defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Constantin Argetoianu]], [http://www.historia.ro/exclusiv_web/general/articol/constantin-argetoianu-ultimatum-mi-s-au-taiat-picioarele "Ultimatum... Mi s-au tăiat picioarele..."], in ''Historia'', June 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina]] sent Romania into a deep political crisis. The events, and revelations about the existence of a [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|Nazi–Soviet agreement]], led Carol to order a final clampdown of the PCdR's remaining Romanian cells. In July, Ralea intervened to rescue a communist friend, the journalist [[George Ivașcu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Pavel Țugui]], [http://www.romlit.ro/george_ivacu_cronicar_de_rzboi_la_ziarul_vremea_1941-1944 "George Ivașcu, cronicar de război, la ziarul ''Vremea'' (1941–1944). I"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 17/2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romanian crisis was aggravated in August, when the Nazi-inspired [[Second Vienna Award|Vienna arbitration]] stripped her of [[Northern Transylvania]]. The political standstill propelled the Iron Guard, which was Nazi-aligned, into government, and forced Carol into permanent exile. The emerging "[[National Legionary State]]" banned reviews such as ''Viața Românească'',&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; and moved to prosecute all former FRN dignitaries. With Panaitescu as the new Rector, the University instituted a Commission for Review, which included Iron Guard sociologist [[Traian Herseni]] and eugenicist [[Iordache Făcăoaru]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 172; Popescu-Cadem, pp. 314, 315&lt;/ref&gt; Of those professors brought before the commission, Ralea was the only one to have his contract terminated without the possibility of transfer.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 540–541. See also Boia, pp. 176, 199; Popescu-Cadem, p. 315&lt;/ref&gt; Panaitescu, Herseni and Făcăoaru found that his appointment to Bucharest had been illegal, and dismissed his scientific contributions as having "zero value".&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 176; Popescu-Cadem, p. 315. See also Zavarache, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea and his colleagues were able to defend Vianu, who was openly Jewish, and who was threatened with demotion under the [[Antisemitic laws in Romania|racial purity laws]].&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 447. See also Boia, pp. 171–173&lt;/ref&gt; Withdrawing to Huși, Ralea became the target of surveillance by agents of the [[Siguranța]], who monitored his subversive conversations, including his wager that Guard rule would be short-lived.&lt;ref name="Zavarache, p. 197"/&gt;

In November 1940, the Guard's [[Romanian Police|Police]] chief, [[Ștefan Zăvoianu]], ordered the arrests of several FRN dignitaries, Ralea included. This angered the military ''[[Conducător]]'', [[Ion Antonescu]], who freed Ralea and the others, ordering Zăvoianu to resign.&lt;ref&gt;Gheorghe I. Florescu, "N. Iorga și America", in ''Zargidava. Revistă de Istorie'', Vol. XII, 2013, pp. 168–169&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Legionnaires' rebellion and Bucharest pogrom|clashes of January 1941]], the Iron Guard was ousted, and Antonescu remained unchallenged. Although fascist, the new regime reinstated Ralea to his professorship. Antonescu castigated the Commission for Review as a "shame", and declared Ralea to be "indispensable".&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 198–200&lt;/ref&gt; In a companion to [[Romanian philosophy]], published that year, Herseni revised his stance, calling Ralea "a thinker of unquestionable talent", whose sociological work had been "a true revelation."&lt;ref&gt;Herseni, p. 545&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea returned to teach at the University where, in addition to Vianu, he had received as his assistant a refugee from Soviet-occupied territory, [[Traian Chelariu]].&lt;ref name="tchmdumbra"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Traian Chelariu]], [[Mircea A. Diaconu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/zilele_i_umbra_mea "Zilele și umbra mea"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 17/2001&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Panaitescu was stripped of his position and briefly imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

Still present in public life after the Romania's entry into the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|anti-Soviet war]], Ralea returned to publishing with articles in ''Revista Românǎ''&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 243; Straje, p. 586&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1942 book ''Înțelesuri'' ("Meanings").&lt;ref name="gc1025"/&gt; Despite being partly recovered by the new regime, and allegedly proposing to Antonescu that they revive together the [[National Socialist Party (Romania)|National Socialist Party]],&lt;ref name="fmhoria"/&gt; Ralea was still under ''Siguranța'' watch, and also spied on by the Police and the German Embassy.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 200, 237; Zavarache, pp. 203–204&lt;/ref&gt; His file contains a denunciation of his entire career and loyalties: he stood accused of having been a "socialist-communist" camouflaged within the PNȚ, of having revived the guilds so as to give the PCdR room for maneuver, and of having sponsored Soviet agents to protect himself in the event of a Soviet invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Stelian Tănase]], [http://www.sferapoliticii.ro/sfera/154/art16-arhiva.php "''Arhivele Sfera Politicii'' – Mihail Ralea"], in ''[[Sfera Politicii]]'', Nr. 154, December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

One ''Siguranța'' record suggests that, in secret, Ralea was hoping to consolidate a left-wing opposition movement against Antonescu during the early months of 1941. More alarmingly for the regime, Ralea had also begun cultivating a revolutionary and pro-Allied youth, through a new magazine called ''Graiul Nostru'' and with British funds.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 202–203&lt;/ref&gt; In February, Ralea was subjected to formal interrogations over his contacts with the PCdR under Carol. He defended these, arguing that he had aimed at securing a protective deal between Romania and the Soviets, and that Carol had approved of his effort. The explanation was viewed as plausible by police, and Ralea was allowed to go free.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 198–199&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the file was reopened by August, after revelations that Ralea had cultivated communists since at least the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 199–201&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1942, Antonescu ordered Ralea's interment at the concentration camp in [[Târgu Jiu]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; He was held there for about three months, to March 1943, and apparently enjoyed a mild detention regime, with visitations.&lt;ref name="zavr203–204"&gt;Zavarache, pp. 203–204&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antihitlerite Front===
[[File:Gh.Gheorghiu Dej rostindu-și cuvântarea la Congresul Frontului Plugarilor ținut pe Stadionul A.N.E.F. (Mihai Ralea, Petru Groza).jpg|thumb|340px|Ralea (left) and [[Petru Groza]], flanking [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]] as he addresses the [[Ploughmen's Front]] Congress, June 1945]]
Ralea's return from camp coincided roughly with the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] and the turn of fortunes on the eastern front. He soon established contacts with the antifascist opposition, repeatedly seeking to set up a Peasantist left and rejoin the PNȚ. Maniu received him and listened to his pleas, but denied him readmission and invited him to create his own coalition from shards of the Renaissance Front, promising him some measure of leniency "for that hour when we shall be evaluating the past mistakes that have thrown this country into dejection."&lt;ref name="mpîntâlniri"/&gt; Their separation remained "unbridgeable";&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 196, 204–205&lt;/ref&gt; eventually, Ralea reestablished the PSȚ, and attracted into its ranks a Social Democratic dissident faction, led by former PSDR theoretician [[Lothar Rădăceanu]].&lt;ref&gt;Frunză, pp. 116–117, 120; Tismăneanu, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; The two reestablished contacts with the PCdR and other fringe parties: moving between Bucharest and [[Sinaia]], Ralea was involved in trilateral talks between the communists, the [[Ploughmen's Front]] of [[Petru Groza]], and the National Liberal inner faction of [[Gheorghe Tătărescu]], helping to coordinate actions between them.&lt;ref&gt;Undrea, pp. 550, 555&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Brașov]], he met with the economist [[Victor Jinga]], whose antifascist and socialist program was reused in later PSȚ propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;Undrea, p. 558&lt;/ref&gt; Together with party colleague [[Stanciu Stoian]], he signed the PSȚ's adherence to the PCdR's clandestine "Patriotic Antihitlerite Front".&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p. 132; Frunză, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to such underground work, Ralea was notably involved in combating the nationalism and racism of the Antonescu years. He was one of several literary critics who publicly chided a colleague, George Călinescu, for publishing a 1941 treatise which included racialist profiles of Romanian writers,&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 243, 244; {{ro icon}} [[Nicolae Manolescu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/g.clinescu_i_detractorii_si "G. Călinescu și detractorii săi"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 34/2013&lt;/ref&gt; alongside criticism of Ralea's own anti-nationalism.&lt;ref name="gc973"/&gt; With the 1943 collection of essays, ''Între două lumi'' ("Between Two Worlds", published at [[Cartea Românească]]),&lt;ref name="gc1025"/&gt; Ralea revised his earlier prophecies about the triumph of collectivism.&lt;ref name="pcom193-194"&gt;Comarnescu, pp. 193–194&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of Ralea's participation in subversion was disregarded by government: in June 1943, when the [[German Foreign Ministry]] nominated Ralea as a high-risk target, Antonescu personally replied that this was not the case.&lt;ref name="zavr203–204"/&gt; In November, Ralea applied for a new Chair of Psychology at Bucharest, reserving his old department for Vianu. The review committee, overseen by leftist allies such as Gusti and [[Mircea Florian]], gave him immediate approval for transfer.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 346. See also Zavarache, pp. 205–206&lt;/ref&gt; In February of the next year, Ralea and N. Bagdasar rejected the application of [[Constantin Noica]], the traditionalist philosopher, to join the university teaching staff. In his report, Ralea noted that Noica had "an absolute and metaphysical mindset", with no "practical reason", and that he was therefore unsuited for research and teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Popescu-Cadem, p. 276&lt;/ref&gt; He also appeared as a defense witness for [[Gheorghe Vlădescu-Răcoasa]], an activist of the underground [[National Popular Party (Romania)|Union of Patriots]].&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; Together with Hudiță and other rival PNȚ-ists, and his friends in Iași academia, Ralea signed to [[Grigore T. Popa]]'s manifesto of the intellectuals, demanding that Antonescu negotiate a separate peace with the Soviets. Reputedly, the document had been stripped of references to the prosecution of FRN and Antonescian officials, leading Maniu to conclude that the signers were "cowardly".&lt;ref name="smhalucin44"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Solomon Marcus]], [http://www.romlit.ro/halucinantul_an_1944 "Halucinantul an 1944"], ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 45/2004&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hudiță, Ralea objected to the Soviets' offer of an armistice as "too soft" on Romania.&lt;ref name="smhalucin44"/&gt; Blocked out of the National Democratic Bloc coalition,&lt;ref name="mpîntâlniri"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frunză, p. 120; Zavarache, pp. 204–205&lt;/ref&gt; which included the PNȚ, the PSDR, and ultimately the PCdR, Ralea watched from the side as the [[King Michael's Coup|August 23 Coup]] deposed Antonescu and pushed Romania into the anti-Nazi camp. His friend and PSȚ colleague, Grigore Geamănu, was more directly involved, helping PCdR leader [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]] to escape from Târgu Jiu camp and join the other conspirators.&lt;ref&gt;S. Popescu, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; In the PSȚ newspaper, ''Dezrobirea'', Ralea saluted "the full triumph of the ideas and principles for which our foremost activists have been militating uninterruptedly these past six years" (a pedigree which seemingly included Ralea's own activities under King Carol).&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 259&lt;/ref&gt; He reissued ''Viața Românească'' with a similar statement about "the present triumph of our credo".&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, keeping up with his earlier threats, Maniu repeatedly asked for Ralea to be [[Romanian People's Tribunals|indicted for war crimes]].&lt;ref name="ițlbfurat"/&gt;

Ralea played an instrumental part in the gradual installation of communism, and is described by various authors as the prototype "[[fellow traveler]]".&lt;ref name="fmhoria"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, pp. 154, 290; Stanomir, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1944, he was announced as the Literary Section Vice President of the [[Romanian Society for Friendship with the Soviet Union]] (ARLUS).&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p. 126, 143&lt;/ref&gt; His PSȚ was drawn into the National Democratic Front (FND) coalition, which comprised the PCdR, the Ploughmen's Front, and the Union of Patriots. According to the PCdR, this transformation of the Antihitlerite Front was "a progressive step, befitting the tasks of the people's revolution";&lt;ref&gt;Undrea, p. 561&lt;/ref&gt; according to historian [[Adrian Cioroianu]], it was more of opportunistic move on Ralea's part.&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, pp. 126–127&lt;/ref&gt; In private, Ralea claimed that his alignment with the communists helped him provide for his large family, including former landowners, but his account is viewed as doubtful by Zavarache.&lt;ref name="zavr256"&gt;Zavarache, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea's Socialist Peasantists were eventually absorbed into the Ploughmen's Front. As noted by Zavarache, Ralea now understood that his influence on political life was "exceedingly minor", aware that Groza himself was merely a communist "puppet"; "consequently, he sought to preserve those offices which could ensure him a comfortable lifestyle".&lt;ref name="zavr225"&gt;Zavarache, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; Like the rest of the FND, Ralea participated in the movement to depose the monarchist premier, General [[Nicolae Rădescu]]. Faced with the PCdR's obstructionism, Rădescu approached Ralea with an alternative offer: the Ploughmen's Front was to form a new government with no communist ministers. Ralea divulged this offer to the Soviet envoy, [[Andrey Vyshinsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, pp. 154–155&lt;/ref&gt; On February 16, 1945, together with 10 other academics (among them Balmuș, Parhon, Rosetti and Oțetea), he signed a letter of protest, accusing Rădescu of stalling land reform and of undermining the work of the [[Allied Commission]].&lt;ref name="citeroarea"&gt;{{ro icon}} Cicerone Ionițoiu, [http://www.romanialibera.ro/aldine/history/asa-a-inceput-teroarea-92991 "Așa a început teroarea"], in ''[[România Liberă]]'', April 21, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Bloody clashes ensued in Bucharest, most of them between anticommunists and communist agents.&lt;ref name="citeroarea"/&gt; They signaled a new political crisis, and forced the FND into power. Ralea was made [[Ministry of Culture and National Patrimony|Minister of Arts]] on March 6, 1945, when Groza took the premiership from the deposed General Rădescu.&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, pp. 127, 154; Vasile (2010), pp. 71–72; Zavarache, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1945 Ralea was one of the rapporteurs at the Ploughmen's Front largest-ever General Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, pp. 158–159&lt;/ref&gt; On March 6, 1946, he also took over the Ministry of Religious Affairs, replacing the disgraced [[Constantin Burducea]] until August (when Groza himself replaced him in this function).&lt;ref&gt;George Enache, "Strategii de infiltrare și atragere la colaborare a cultelor religioase elaborate de autoritățile procomuniste din România în perioada 1945-1947, cu o privire specială asupra cazului Bisericii Ortodoxe Române", in ''Caietele CNSAS'', Nr. 1/2008, pp. 74, 76&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea became one of several intellectuals who were mobilized to run on the Ploughmen's Front (and FND) list in the [[Romanian general election, 1946|1946 parliamentary election]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 273; Cioroianu, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt; In his capacity as minister, Ralea set in motion the purge of PNȚ-ist functionaries and of artists perceived by the PCdR as pro-fascist.&lt;ref&gt;Catalan, pp. 187–188, 190; Vasile (2010), pp. 131–132&lt;/ref&gt; He extended his personal protection to [[Șerban Cioculescu]], who became Iași University professor in 1946 upon Ralea's intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 358–359&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea also pursued his projects for workers' education, authorizing the establishment of a workers' theatrical troupe, ''[[Odeon Theatre (Bucharest)|Teatrul Muncitoresc CFR Giulești]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Catalan, pp. 188–190&lt;/ref&gt; He also republished his 1930s travel accounts, completed with notes from his trip to [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]], as ''Nord-Sud'' ("North-South").&lt;ref&gt;Constantinescu, pp. 285–291; Vianu, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1946, Ralea stepped down from the Ministry of Arts, only to be appointed [[List of Ambassadors from Romania to the United States|Ambassador to the United States]]. Reputedly, he was a last minute replacement for the Union of Patriots' [[Dumitru Bagdasar]]. The latter had fallen severely ill,&lt;ref name="abasclepios"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Alexandra Bellow]], [http://www.revista22.ro/articol-1115.html "Asclepios versus Hades în România (II)"], in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Nr. 755, September 2004&lt;/ref&gt; but was also seen as a political liability by the American side—Ralea, as a former monarchist, was preferable.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 222–223&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea's own arrival in Washington was delayed by his inclusion on the Romanian delegation to the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris Peace Conference]], and he finally landed on American soil in October.&lt;ref&gt;Deaconescu, p. 28; Zavarache, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; He supported a détente in [[Romania–United States relations|Romanian–American relations]], after [[President of the United States|President]] [[Harry S. Truman]] had refused to recognize the Groza cabinet. In front of American criticism, he played down the electoral fraud of 1946, claiming that it was within the "normal" boundaries, at some 5% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p. 127. See also Zavarache, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea was also tasked with undermining the reputation of the anticommunist opposition and with popularizing communism among [[Romanian American]] exiles.&lt;ref&gt;Deaconescu, p. 28; Grigorescu &amp; Ștefan, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; The anticommunist press responded by calling Ralea "a liaison man" of the [[Politburo]], tasked with planting [[Stalinism]] in America.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Dushnyck, "Stalin's Pan-Slavism in the United States", in ''[[The Ukrainian Weekly]]'', Nr. 30/1948, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Among expatriate Romanians, Ralea and his legation staff had difficulties convincing [[Maruca Cantacuzino|Maruca]] and [[George Enescu]], but persuaded [[Dimitrie Gusti]] to return to Bucharest.&lt;ref&gt;Grigorescu &amp; Ștefan, pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea also approached the former backers of Carol's regime. He build a connection with the industrialist [[Nicolae Malaxa]], but found vocal adversaries in [[Max Auschnitt]] and [[Richard Franasovici]].&lt;ref&gt;Grigorescu &amp; Ștefan, pp. 25–27&lt;/ref&gt;

Going against Soviet policies and his own government, Ralea also sought to obtain American foreign aid, and even political interventions. His persistence in this regard contributed to the relief effort organized by [[Cortlandt V.R. Schuyler|General Schuyler]] in famine-stricken [[Western Moldavia]].&lt;ref name="abasclepios"/&gt; However, the assistance fell below Ralea's expectations, owing to various factors, one of which was American suspicion that Groza was diverting food to relieve the [[Soviet famine of 1946–47|Soviet famine]]; meanwhile, diaspora voices repeatedly argued that Ralea was playing down the scale of famine, and also insinuated that he was embezzling funds.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 224–225&lt;/ref&gt; In his reports to Bucharest, Ralea complained that: "America's attitude toward us was oscillating between hostility and ignorance. All doors were closed. [...] We were seen as a Soviet branch office, and people were discouraged from giving us any sort of assistance."&lt;ref&gt;Deaconescu, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, he was shocked by Truman's ignorance of Romanian affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Z. Ornea]], [http://www.romlit.ro/un_raport_american_despre_romnia_din_1949 "Un raport american despre România din 1949"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 48/2001&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea's diplomatic mission was also tainted by his difficult lifestyle, including his noticeable [[hypochondriasis]],&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), pp. 207, 267&lt;/ref&gt; but also his philandering. Ralea had appointed his mistress as [[cultural attaché]], but she deserted her post and left to Mexico while Ioana Ralea took up residence in the Romanian embassy.&lt;ref&gt;Grigorescu &amp; Ștefan, p. 27; Nastasă (2010), p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;

With the looming threat of Soviet-style [[Collectivization in Romania|collectivization]], Ralea informed the Americans that Romanian peasants valued individual property.&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, during his January 1947 interview with [[United States Secretary of State|US Secretary of State]] [[James F. Byrnes]], he pleaded emotionally for Romanians not to be left "behind the [[Iron Curtain]]".&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p. 127; Deaconescu, p. 29; Zavarache, pp. 223–224&lt;/ref&gt; He was still the country's ambassador when King [[Michael I of Romania|Michael I]] was forced to abdicate by the PCdR officials and a [[Communist Romania|communized people's republic]] was proclaimed. Nevertheless, [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Romania)|Foreign Minister]] [[Ana Pauker]] greatly reduced his influence in Washington, transferring many of his attributes to a communist diplomat, [[Grigore Preoteasa]].&lt;ref name="zavr225"/&gt; In June, Ralea also became chairman of a Romanian Institute for Foreign Cultural Relations, which was dedicated to the spread of propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;Florin C. Stan, "Relațiile bilaterale România—Israel (1948–1959). O cronologie", in ''Caiete Diplomatice'', Vol. 2, Issue 2, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communist marginalization and recovery===
A scandal erupted in July 1948, when the Raleas were denied access to the diplomats' beach in [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]], having been blacklisted as "communists". Ioana Ralea endangered her husband's position by protesting against this qualifier; at home, rumor spread that the couple was planning to defect.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 225–226&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea was able to persuade Pauker not to recall him, and even organized a reception in her honor during October 1948;&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; he also organized a communist counter-manifestation upon Michael's arrival to Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Marius Ghilezan, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/De-ce-toti-presedintii-Romaniei-s-au-temut-de-Regele-Mihai-I*articleID_26028-articles_details.html "De ce toți președinții României s-au temut de Regele Mihai I?"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 597, October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; While still abroad, Ralea had run in the formal [[Romanian legislative election, 1948|election of March 1948]], taking a Fălciu seat in the [[Great National Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 310–311; Zavarache, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed him to return to a secure position after [[Mihai Magheru]] took over as Ambassador, in late 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 226, 237&lt;/ref&gt;

Resuming his scholarly work, Ralea had to refrain from calling himself a "sociologist", as that field of research had been declared "reactionary".&lt;ref&gt;Zamfir ''et al.'', pp. 5, 6&lt;/ref&gt; He was again given the position of psychology chair at the University of Bucharest, and was also made a member of the new [[Nicolae Iorga Institute of History|Institute of History and Philosophy]], whose president was Constantinescu-Iași. Ralea was seconded there by [[Constantin Ionescu Gulian]], with whom he did research into the history of Romanian materialist philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 237–246&lt;/ref&gt; He also prepared an [[Anthropology|anthropological]] tract, ''Explicarea omului'' ("Explaining Man"). Translated into the French by [[Eugène Ionesco]],&lt;ref name="apmorală3"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Antonio Patraș]], [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/PATRASfeb7.html "Pentru o morală a grației (III)"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; it was published at [[Presses Universitaires de France]].&lt;ref name="feexpl418"&gt;François Evain, "Revue des livres. Mihai Ralea, ''Explication de l'Homme''", in ''Études'', Nr. 6/1950, p. 418&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1948, he had been accepted into the [[List of purged members of the Romanian Academy|recently purged]] [[Romanian Academy]], at the same time as Balmuș, [[Raluca Ripan]], [[Grigore Moisil]], [[Ștefan Milcu]], [[Camil Petrescu]], and PCdR historian [[Mihail Roller]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 300–302&lt;/ref&gt; A contributor to the PCdR daily, ''[[Scînteia]]'', as well as to its youth supplement and its cultural reviews (''Studii'', ''[[Contemporanul]]'', etc.),&lt;ref name="mstr586"/&gt; Ralea also sat on the editorial staff of the Academy Historical Section's trimonthly, ''Buletin Științific'', alongside Roller, [[David Prodan]], and [[Constantin Moisil]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Dan Berindei]], "''Buletin Științific''", in ''Enciclopedia istoriografiei românești'', [[Editura Științifică și Enciclopedică]], Bucharest, 1978, p. 443&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the Workers' Party (as the PCdR was known after absorbing the PSDR) was collecting evidence incriminating Ralea. In October 1949, taking its cue from Roller and [[Leonte Răutu]], the party press carried notes critical of Ralea and Gulian's research.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 242–247&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Roller suggested that Ralea's introduction to the works of [[Vasile Conta]] was not up to Marxist standards, and also hinted that Ralea held too many offices.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 246–247&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Securitate]] secret police opened a file on him, which recorded his criticism of Roller and other "ignoramuses" promoted by the regime; in exchange, the Securitate labeled Ralea "opportunistic" and "a danger to our regime."&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 334&lt;/ref&gt; From about 1950, his office at the Institute was infiltrated by informants, and probably also [[Covert listening device|bugged]].&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea responded to the pressures by presenting his services as an anti-American propagandist, making his first-hand experience in America into an irreplaceable asset; this assignment was inaugurated in January 1951, when Ralea and Gulian published in ''Studii'' a piece addressing the immorality of "[[American imperialism|American imperialists]]".&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 247–248&lt;/ref&gt; Working under direct Soviet supervision, Ralea took charge of a research project endorsed by the entire Institute: ''Caracterul antiștiințific și antiuman al psihologiei americane'' ("The Anti-Science and Anti-Humanity Nature of American Psychology", published 1954).&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 248–249, 251–254&lt;/ref&gt; He was again able to rescue Vianu, this time from communist persecution,&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 308–309; Vasile (2010), p. 277&lt;/ref&gt; and intervened to save the career of writer [[Costache Olăreanu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Cronicar, [http://www.romlit.ro/act4099 "Actualitatea: Costache Olăreanu par lui-même"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 40/1999&lt;/ref&gt; More discreetly, he paid the bills of his former teacher, Rădulescu-Motru, who had been expelled from academia,&lt;ref name="zavr256"/&gt; and rescued from eviction the conductor [[George Georgescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Basiliade, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; However, he could not protect either his brother-in-law Suchianu, who was arrested and held in communist prisons,&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 334; Zavarache, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; nor Chelariu, who was sacked and had to work as a rat-catcher.&lt;ref name="tchmdumbra"/&gt; His disciple, [[Psycholinguistics|psycholinguist]] [[Tatiana Slama-Cazacu]], was forced to abandon her doctorate studies because of her political nonconformism.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Al. Niculescu, [http://www.romlit.ro/requiem_pentru_o_savant "Requiem pentru o savantă"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 34/2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea still had friendly contacts with his former supervisors in Foreign Affairs, though he complained to his peers that Pauker was snubbing him.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, p. 243&lt;/ref&gt; Pandrea, who had fallen out with the Workers' Party regime and spent time in prison, later alleged that Ralea, "the impenitent servant", cultivated the friendship of communist women, from Pauker to [[Liuba Chișinevschi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Gheorghe Grigurcu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/extraordinarul_petre_pandrea_i "Extraordinarul Petre Pandrea (I)"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 23/2005&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea witnessed Pauker's 1952 downfall and banishment, and reputedly kept himself informed about her activities through mutual acquaintances.&lt;ref&gt;[[G. Brătescu]], ''Ce-a fost să fie. Notații autobiografice'', [[Humanitas publishing house|Humanitas]], Bucharest, 2003, p. 268.  {{ISBN|973-50-0425-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; His own survival in the post-Pauker era was an unusual feat. According to Pandrea, it was possible only because Ralea was "without scruples", always ready for a "cowardly submission", and a "valet" of Workers' Party potentates such as [[Ion Gheorghe Maurer]].&lt;ref name="ggglose2"/&gt; As a sign that he was still protected by the regime, in February 1953 Ralea was awarded the [[Order of the Star of the Romanian Socialist Republic|Star of the People's Republic]], Second Class.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 251–252&lt;/ref&gt; A close bond existed between Ralea and the Workers' Party chief, [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]], who began cultivating his very own intellectual circle after engineering Pauker's downfall.&lt;ref&gt;Tismăneanu, p. 161; Zamfir ''et al.'', p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

The death of [[Joseph Stalin]] in early 1953 signaled a path toward less dogmatism. This initially hurt Ralea: ''Caracterul antiștiințific și antiuman'', now seen as embarrassing, was not given mass circulation.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 254–255&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Ralea supported Gheorghiu-Dej's adoption of a [[National communism in Romania|national communist]] platform, which was presented as an alternative to Soviet control.&lt;ref&gt;Tismăneanu, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; Over the early 1950s, he had grown disgusted and alarmed by the impact of communist policies in education, but still fearful of approaching the topic in his dealings with communist potentates.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 249–250&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, with the relaxation of political pressures, he went public with his criticism, issued as a report to the Workers' Party leadership. It spoke about the poor scientific standards at Romania's universities, and criticized the appointment of political workers as school principals.&lt;ref&gt;Cristian Vasile, "Propaganda and Culture in Romania at the Beginning of the Communist Regime", in [[Vladimir Tismăneanu]] (ed.), ''Stalinism Revisited: The Establishment of Communist Regimes in East-Central Europe''. [[Central European University|CEU Press]], Budapest, 2009, pp. 378–379.  {{ISBN|978-963-9776-63-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report also condemned the Art Ministry for promoting "mediocrities" as cultural inspectors,&lt;ref&gt;Vasile (2010), pp. 127–128&lt;/ref&gt; but avoided any proposal for actual liberalization.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; By 1957, the Romanian school of psychology had been relaunched, and its official publications recommended Ralea as a main reference, but without mentioning ''Caracterul antiștiințific și antiuman''.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 236, 254–255&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, some Romanian anticommunist circles also began taking an interest in Ralea, vainly hoping that he would be appointed premier of a [[De-Stalinization in Romania|post-Stalinist Romania]].&lt;ref name="tchmdumbra"/&gt;

===Final years===
[[File:Bucuresti, Romania, Cimitirul Bellu Ortodox (Mormantul lui Mihai Ralea).JPG|thumb|300px|Ralea's grave at [[Bellu cemetery]]]]
In 1956, the psychology section became an independent Institute, and Ralea became its chairman.&lt;ref name="Zavarache, p. 255"&gt;Zavarache, p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; Also that year, Ralea published his historical essay on French politics and culture, ''Cele două Franțe'' ("The Two Frances"). It came out in a 1959 French edition, as ''Les Visages de France'', with a preface by [[Roger Garaudy]].&lt;ref name="adf253"&gt;Alex Drace-Francis, ''The Traditions of Invention: Romanian Ethnic and Social Stereotypes in Historical Context'', [[Brill Publishers]], Leiden, 2013, p. 253.  {{ISBN|978-90-04-21617-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea was also one of the select few Romanians, most of them trusted figures of the regime, who could reissue selections from their interwar literary contributions, at the specialized state company [[Editura de Stat pentru Literatură și Artă]]. Ralea was one of the first in this series, with the 1957 ''Scrieri din trecut'' ("Writings from the Past).&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ion Simuț]], [http://www.romlit.ro/istoria_unei_ediii "Istoria unei ediții"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 8/2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Under a similar understanding with the regime, Ralea and other dignitaries could publish accounts of their travels in capitalist countries—in Ralea's case, the 1959 ''În extremul occident'' ("Into the Far West").&lt;ref name="adf253"/&gt; It had comments on the "iron fisted rule" of the [[United Fruit Company|United Fruit]], and gibes at "the putrefied lazy specimens" of "exploiters" in [[Republic of Cuba (1902–59)|pre-communist Cuba]].&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, pp. 158–159&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea was nevertheless active in reintegrating culturally some intellectuals who had been imprisoned and [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]]: together with one such figure, Constantin I. Botez, he wrote the 1958 ''Istoria psihologiei'' ("History of Psychology").&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 149; (2010), p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; According to memoirist C. D. Zeletin, Ralea and Vianu had a "courageous and noble" stand after the [[Bucharest student movement of 1956|student protest of 1956]]: acting together, they obtained the release from Securitate custody of Dumitru D. Panaitescu, son of the critic [[Perpessicius]].&lt;ref&gt;C. D. Zeletin, "Perpessicius, sau Pentru ca fresca să nu se șteargă (1)", in ''Acolada'', Nr. 12/2014, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea and his family lived at a luxurious villa on Washington Street, [[Dorobanți]].&lt;ref&gt;Lazu, pp. 36, 118, 197&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, he had been re-inducted into the literary canon, mentioned in official manuals as one of sixteen critics whose work supported "socialist construction".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ion Simuț]], [http://www.romlit.ro/canonul_literar_proletcultist_iii "Canonul literar proletcultist (III)"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 29/2008&lt;/ref&gt; Around that time, Ralea and Vianu mounted campaign for Marxist humanism, and were elected to the National Board of [[UNESCO]] (Ralea was its vice president). Their actions were condemned at the time by the exile writer [[Virgil Ierunca]], who described their "solemn agitation" as a new ruse on the part of Gheorghiu-Dej.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Laszlo Alexandru]], [http://193.226.7.140/~laszlo/eleonardo/n18/Laszlo7.htm "Domnul T."], in ''E-Leonardo'', Nr. 18/2012; retrieved July 1, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea was also sent abroad with a dossier on exile writer [[Vintilă Horia]], who had received the [[Prix Goncourt]]. It showed evidence of Horia's support for interwar fascism. Ralea's mission was hampered by revelations about his own compromises with fascism, published in ''[[Le Monde]]'', ''[[Paris-Presse]]'' and the Romanian diaspora press, under such titles as: "Ralea used to [[Roman salute|lift his arm really high]]".&lt;ref name="fmhoria"/&gt; According to later assessments, the Horia affair and Ralea's participation therein were instrumented by the Securitate.&lt;ref name="fmhoria"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Popescu-Cadem, p. 312; {{ro icon}} [[Alex. Ștefănescu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/ultimul_mesaj_al_lui_vintil_horia "Ultimul mesaj al lui Vintilă Horia"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 50/2008; Geo Vasile, [http://www.romlit.ro/vintil_horia_exorcist_al_exilului "Vintilă Horia, exorcist al exilului"], in ''România Literară'', Nr. 30/2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Adhering to the official cultural policy, Ralea was making efforts to be admitted into the Workers' Party. His application was politely turned down,&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Florin Mihai, [http://www.historia.ro/exclusiv_web/general/articol/cerberul-ceausescu-contra-lui-zaharia-stancu-agentul-sigurantei "Cerberul Ceaușescu contra lui Zaharia Stancu, 'agentul Siguranței'"], in ''Historia'', March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; but he was honored with the vice presidency of the Great National Assembly Presidium&lt;ref name="fmhoria"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Basiliade, pp. 47–48&lt;/ref&gt; and a seat on the republican [[State Council of Romania|Council of State]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 334; S. Popescu, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, Ralea was one of the guest speakers at a [[Geneva]] conference on the [[generation gap]], alongside [[Louis Armand]], [[Claude Autant-Lara]], and [[Jean Piaget]].&lt;ref&gt;C. V., "Bibliographie critique. ''La vie et le temps. Les générations dans le monde actuel. Texte des conférences et entretiens des Rencontres internationales de Genève 1962''", in ''Population'', Nr. 3/1964, p. 604&lt;/ref&gt; Also that year, he helped with the recovery and reemployment of a former rival, [[Traian Herseni]]. Reportedly, Ralea excused Herseni's Iron Guard affiliation as a careerist move rather than a political crime.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1995), p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; Together, they published ''Sociologia succesului'' ("The Sociology of Success"); Herseni used the pseudonym ''Traian Hariton''.&lt;ref&gt;Stahl, p. 703; Straje, p. 323; Zamfir ''et al.'', p. 7; Zavarache, p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; Despite such interventions, Ralea was publicly shamed by the dissident poet [[Păstorel Teodoreanu]], who nicknamed him the communist "Viceroy", or "Immo-Ralea".&lt;ref&gt;Basiliade, pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt;

According to his younger colleague George C. Basiliade, Ralea was an "unfulfilled sybarite", whose luxurious lifestyle did not fit his physical frame and his background.&lt;ref&gt;Basiliade, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; A heavy smoker, and prone to culinary excesses, Ralea checked himself in [[Otopeni]] hospital showing symptoms of [[facial nerve paralysis]], with [[hypertension]] and fatigue.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), pp. 437–438&lt;/ref&gt; Against the advice of his doctors, he decided to attend a UNESCO meeting in [[Copenhagen]]. He died aboard the train, outside [[East Berlin]], on the morning of August 17, 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), p. 438. See also S. Popescu, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; His body was transported back to Bucharest, and buried at [[Bellu cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;Gheorghe G. Bezviconi, ''Necropola Capitalei'', [[Nicolae Iorga Institute of History]], Bucharest, 1972, p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea and Herseni had been working on a textbook, ''Introducere în psihologia socială'' ("Companion to Social Psychology"), which only saw print in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Stahl, pp. 702, 703&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociology of culture==

===Generic traits===
As seen by Zavarache, Ralea was a man of "outstanding intelligence" with an "encyclopedic knowledge, tightly aligned with the rhythms of Western culture."&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 187, 189&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea's contemporaries left remarks on not just his hyperactivity, but also his neglect of details, and his eclecticism. [[Pompiliu Constantinescu]] remarked of "petulant" Ralea: "Here is a soul who will not stand for the label of specialization!"&lt;ref&gt;Constantinescu, p. 285&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926, [[Eugen Lovinescu]] dismissed Ralea as "a fecund ideologue, paradoxical in his association and dissociation of varied and superficial ideals that have happened to have points of contact with Romanian literature."&lt;ref&gt;E. Lovinescu, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; He reads both Ralea and Suchianu as displays of "useless erudition" and "failure of logic".&lt;ref&gt;E. Lovinescu, pp. 117, 119&lt;/ref&gt; Completing this verdict, [[Monica Lovinescu]] saw Ralea as "not truly a literary critic", but "a sociologist, a psychologist, a moralist—a moralist with no morals, and yet a moralist".&lt;ref&gt;M. Lovinescu, pp. 483–484&lt;/ref&gt; More leniently, [[George Călinescu]] noted that Ralea was an "[[Epicureanism|epicurean]]" of "vivid intelligence", who only chronicled "books that he has enjoyed reading". His free associations of concepts were "very often surprising, quite often admirable".&lt;ref name="gc911"/&gt; Ralea, Călinescu proposes, was Romania's own "little [[Bernard Le Bovier de Fontenelle|Fontenelle]]".&lt;ref name="gc912"/&gt;

After his French sojourn, Ralea infused Poporanism and collectivism with both [[Émile Durkheim|Durkheim]]'s corporatism&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 118. See also Vianu, p. 146; Zavarache, pp. 187–188&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Karl Marx|Marx]]'s theory of "[[class consciousness]]".&lt;ref&gt;Ghiață, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; In his earliest work, he also referenced [[Ludwig Gumplowicz]]'s ideas about the [[Conflict theories|fundamental inequality]] of class-based societies. These references helped him build a critique of innate "class solidarity" as presumed by early corporatism, and also of Proudhon's [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualist economics]].&lt;ref&gt;Ghiață, pp. 27, 101–102, 144, 147, 149, 152, 162&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this collectivist-functionalist outlook, and although he spoke out against [[art for art's sake]], Ralea was adamant that strictly sociological explanations of creativity were doomed to fail. As he put it, all attributes of a writer were "subsidiary to [his] creative originality".&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea reduced [[aestheticism]] and [[social determinism]] to the basic units of "aesthetics" and "ethnicity". As he saw it, an ethnic consciousness was biologically and psychologically necessary: it helped structure perception, giving humans a reference point between the particularity and generality.&lt;ref&gt;Comarnescu, p. 195; Crohmălniceanu, pp. 128–129, 130; E. Lovinescu, pp. 117–119&lt;/ref&gt; An artist, Ralea argued in 1925, was "obliged" to address the national society he lived in, "at the present stage in civilization": "If he were human, he would be discarding specificity itself, that is to say the very essence of art, and would fall into science; if he were too specific, too original, he'd stand to lose his means of expression, the point of contact with his public".&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, pp. 128–129&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea believed that the origin of beauty was biological, before being human or social; he also claimed (questionably so, according to art critic [[Petru Comarnescu]]) that traditional society allowed no depiction of ugliness before the arrival of [[Christian art]].&lt;ref&gt;Comarnescu, pp. 195–196&lt;/ref&gt;

With this analysis of aesthetic principles, borrowing from [[Henri Bergson]], Ralea toned down his own rationalism and determinism, taking in [[relativism]] and [[Intuition (Bergson)|intuitionism]].&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; With his respect for critical intuition, his critique of determinism, and his cosmopolitanism, he came unexpectedly close to the aestheticism of his rival Lovinescu, and, though him, to the "aesthetic autonomism" of [[Titu Maiorescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Constantinescu, pp. 151–152; Ornea (1998), pp. 146–147, 377&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea even sketched out his own relativist theory, according to which works of art could have limitless interpretations (or "unforeseen significances"),&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, pp. 148–149&lt;/ref&gt; thus unwittingly paralleling, or anticipating, the [[semiotics]] of [[Roland Barthes]].&lt;ref name="agutopia"&gt;{{ro icon}} Alex Goldiș, [http://revistacultura.ro/nou/2011/10/adrian-marino-si-utopia-teoriei-literaturii/ "Adrian Marino și utopia teoriei literaturii"], in ''Cultura'', Nr. 343, October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; With ''Între două lumi'', he still rejected individualism and subjectivity, but also nuanced his corporatist collectivism. As he noted, militancy in favor of either philosophy had sparked the modern crisis. The solution, Ralea suggested, was for man to rediscover the simple joys of anonymity.&lt;ref name="pcom193-194"/&gt;

===National psychology===
In his essay ''Fenomenul Românesc'' ("The Romanian Phenomenon"), Ralea elaborated on the issue of Romanian [[national psychology]]. He understood this as a natural development of [[Dimitrie Gusti]]'s sociological "science of the nation", but better suited to the topic and more resourceful.&lt;ref&gt;Verdery, pp. 64–66&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ralea, Romanians were structurally opposed to mysticism, which could not compliment their true character: "good-natured, even-minded, sharp-witted like all meridional men, [and] extremely lucid."&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; The "Romanian soul" was therefore an adaptable and pragmatic entity, mixing a Western propensity for action with a [[Levant]]ine [[fatalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Comarnescu, p. 195; Balázs Trencsényi, "Conceptualizarea caracterului național în tradiția intelectuală românească", in Neumann &amp; Heinen, p. 354&lt;/ref&gt; Combating antisemitism, Ralea applied this theory to the issue of [[Ashkenazi Jewish intelligence|European Jewish intelligence]]: quoting [[Werner Sombart]], he deduced that the "rationalist", "progressive" and "utilitarian" essence of Jewishness was socially determined by the Jews' participation in capitalist competition.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrei Oișteanu]], ''Inventing the Jew. Antisemitic Stereotypes in Romanian and Other Central East-European Cultures'', [[University of Nebraska Press]], Lincoln, 2009, pp. 56, 149.  {{ISBN|978-0-8032-2098-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Ralea was personally responsible for establishing a laboratory of [[experimental psychology]] at Iași, he in fact abhorred experimental methods, and preferred to rely on intuition.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 188, 205–206&lt;/ref&gt; As a theorist, he gave a humanistic praise to dilettantism and vitality, in the face of philosophical sobriety. He commended [[Ion Luca Caragiale]], the creator of modern [[Romanian humor]], as the voice of lucidity, equating irony with intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1998), p. 367&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by Călinescu, Ralea "either intentionally or unconsciously [suggests] that intense flippancy is in fact sobriety".&lt;ref name="gc912"/&gt; Ralea did have his uncertainties about the grounding of his own idea. Caragiale's humor risked making Romanians too accepting of their superficiality: "maybe this genius portraitist of our bourgeoisie has done us a great harm".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Gheorghe Grigurcu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/iari_despre_caragiale "Iarăși despre Caragiale"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 16/2006&lt;/ref&gt; During his polemic with ''[[Sburătorul]]'' modernism, Ralea attacked the new schools of aesthetics for their artificiality and obsessiveness: "Not one of the truly terrible chapters in life is familiar to [the modernists]. They are not humans, just clowns. [...] Only the demented and children are unilateral. True aesthetics expresses the mature and normal spiritual functions. The alternative is comparative or infantile aesthetics".&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, pp. 134–135&lt;/ref&gt; According to Monica Lovinescu, his critique of "lassitude" and "cowardice" in urban life is "a severe diagnostic of his own disease."&lt;ref&gt;M. Lovinescu, p. 397&lt;/ref&gt;

On such grounds, Ralea concluded that Romanian writers "have had no deep spiritual experience", lacking "a comprehension of humanity, of life and death."&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; In a notorious socio-critical essay, first published in ''Perspective'', Ralea asked: "Why Did We Not Produce a Novel?". He contended that the grand epic genre, unlike the short story, did not yet suit the Romanian psyche, since it required discipline, anonymity, and a "great moral significance".&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, pp. 187–188; Vianu, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; He also postulated a deterministic relationship between the staples of ancestral [[Romanian folklore]] and modern literary choices: in the absence of any ambitious poetic cycles (as found in Western literature), Romanian ballads and ''[[Doina|doine]]'' had naturally mutated into novellas.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; In order to mend such a historical disadvantage, he set himself the goal of writing his own novel, but eventually gave up on the idea.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, pp. 153, 154&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of its writing, the essay claimed to count only a few living novelists; by 1935, however, there was already talk of an "inflation of novels".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Marius Chivu]], [http://dilemaveche.ro/sectiune/carte/articol/granta-romania#"Granta de România"], in ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', Nr. 502, September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conformist Marxism===
In a 1945 interview with writer [[Ion Biberi]], Ralea explained himself as a [[Marxist humanism|Marxist humanist]], influenced by [[André Malraux]] and by unspecified "recent Russian doctrinaires".&lt;ref name="istnm28"/&gt; Expanding on his earlier stances, he understood the [[Socialism (Marxism)|socialist mode of production]] as both desirable and inevitable, to be received with "enthusiasm" by the masses: "[it] provides practically infinite production opportunities, because it excludes personal gain and is no longer dominated by the game of markets, of supply and demand."&lt;ref&gt;Stanomir, pp. 28–29&lt;/ref&gt; He conceived of a socialism wherein "man, integrated with communal life, shall have full liberty in his actions".&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to political scientist [[Ioan Stanomir]], Ralea's discourse is to be read as a "celebration of slavery".&lt;ref&gt;Stanomir, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

The transformation was accelerated during Ralea's last 15 years of life. Around 1950, Ralea was studying [[Marxist aesthetics]] and [[Marxist literary criticism]], advising young literati, and his colleague Vianu, to do the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} G. Pienescu, [http://www.viataromaneasca.eu/arhiva/70_via-a-romaneasca-1-2-2011/49_note-din-launtru/793_sub-vremi.html "...sub vremi"], in ''[[Viața Românească]]'', Nr. 1&amp;ndash;2/2011&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea was also going back on his cosmopolitanism, seeing it as an obstacle to the proper understanding of Romanian society.&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Christian Maner, "Noțiunea de Europa din perspectiva științei istorice românești", in Neumann &amp; Heinen, pp. 257–258&lt;/ref&gt; His teaching aid for social psychology was similarly adjusted, introducing chapters on "class psychology", though, as Zavarache argues, these modifications were "surprisingly kept to a minimum".&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 240–241&lt;/ref&gt; Especially in his reedited ''Scrieri din trecut'', Ralea sought to reconcile Ibrăileanu's [[social Darwinism]] with the official readings of Marxism, as well as with [[Lysenkoism|Michurinism]] and [[Classical conditioning|Pavlovianism]].&lt;ref&gt;Teodora Dumitru, "«Selecție» și «mutație»: două concepte pentru explicarea fenomenului literar", in ''Philologica Jassyensia'', Vol. VII, Issue 2, 2011, pp. 44, 48, 49&lt;/ref&gt;

Shaped by political command, ''Caracterul antiștiințific și antiuman'' excoriated American psychologists as tools of the capitalist regime, claiming that capitalism cultivated "force", "triviality", and "sexual debauchery"; Ralea also stated his outrage at the absence of socialized health care in the United States, even though he privately explained that American workers led "satisfactory" lives.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 252–253&lt;/ref&gt; To his peers, Ralea complained that "the adoption of a Marxist canon was stifling his ability to interpret", and therefore prevented him from "elaborating valuable papers."&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; He "doubtlessly never imagined that there would be such excess and distortion", and tried to persuade [[Censorship in Communist Romania|communist censors]] not to exaggerate his works' anti-Americanism.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 251, 253&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Explicarea omului'', Vianu notes, Ralea brought up "a fundamental cultural motif, man's urge to create himself ''obstacles'' and consequently break through them with his natural instinct [Vianu's emphasis]."&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ralea, brute ethics existed as "a mechanism for social self-regulation", which helped to distill the "[[Élan vital|vital impulse]]", whereas the accomplished human being would internalize its requirements and verify them against his own rationality.&lt;ref name="apmorală3"/&gt; Overall, Ralea contended that "[[dialectical materialism]] has the complete answer to any fundamental issue regarding social structuring". That answer was in "[[Base and superstructure|superstructures]]", and the references were Marx, [[Friedrich Engels]], [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Joseph Stalin]], alongside [[Ludwig Klages]] and [[Max Scheler]].&lt;ref name="feexpl418"/&gt; According to philosopher François Evain, Ralea's study failed as a work of [[psychological anthropology]], and merely showed "what superstructures become under Marxist materialism."&lt;ref name="feexpl418"/&gt; Contrarily, critic [[Antonio Patraș]] noted the links between ''Explicarea omului'' (a "brilliant study") and Ralea's earlier contributions to sociology.&lt;ref name="apmorală3"/&gt;

''Sociologia succesului'' was to some extent dependent on Ralea's study of Durkheim's ''[[The Division of Labour in Society|Division of Labor]]'', with its distinction between laws of punishment and laws of restitution (or reward). Ralea maintained that remedial sanctions were a characteristic of modern civilized society, and that the [[social fact]] of "success" was created within that setting.&lt;ref&gt;Herseni, pp. 547–548&lt;/ref&gt; However, the work was heavily reliant on [[Marxist sociology]], hypothesizing that socialist societies had perfected new incentives for workers to set collective objectives and succeed at them.&lt;ref&gt;A. Huhnwald, "Bibliographie. Ralea M., Hariton T., ''Sociologia succesului''", in ''Revue Française de Sociologie'', Nr. 2/1964, pp. 219–220&lt;/ref&gt; According to psychologist Edgar Krau, Ralea and Herseni gave credibility to "the tenet that the individualistic ethics of capitalism disunites and hurts people"; however, they ignored the reality of communism, which was "not [its] collectivism, but the all-pervading party tuition".&lt;ref&gt;Edgar Krau, ''Social and Economic Management in the Competitive Society'', [[Kluwer Academic Publishers]], Dordrecht, 1998, pp. 36–37.  {{ISBN|0-7923-8028-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Romania, ''Sociologia succesului'' was mainly noted for reintegrating professional (albeit antiquated) references to American psychology and sociology.&lt;ref name="Zavarache, p. 255"/&gt; It marked a fundamental step in the restoration of Romanian sociology, and also allowed Ralea to publish again on a subject which had preoccupied him since 1944.&lt;ref name="cz&amp;al7"&gt;Zamfir ''et al.'', p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Ralea was survived by his only child, daughter Catinca Ralea (1929–1981). In her twenties, she cultivated a literary circle which included poet [[Geo Dumitrescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Basiliade, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; She also had a career in letters, before becoming a [[Radio Romania International]] reporter and [[Romanian Television]] producer.&lt;ref name="acfresh"&gt;Alice Caster, "A Short, Fresh Look At Canadian Life", in ''[[The Ottawa Journal]]'', March 18, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 157; (2010), pp. 307, 517&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, Catinca provided live coverage of the [[Apollo 11]] mission, including the first [[Moon landing]].&lt;ref&gt;"Un mare comentator sportiv – Ion Ghiţulescu", in ''Buletin de Istoria Presei'', Issues 8–9/2015, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, she is remembered for her translations from [[J. D. Salinger]] (which fed Romania's [[counterculture of the 1960s]])&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), p. 307&lt;/ref&gt; and [[J. R. R. Tolkien]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Emil Brumaru]], "Crepusculul civil de dimineață. După lungi și dulci discuții...", in ''Suplimentul de Cultură'', Issue 133, June 2007, p. 11; Adina Popescu, "Literatura imaginarului", in ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', Nr. 115, April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; With Eugenia Cîncea, she completed a best-selling translation of ''[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]'', which had five editions between 1962 and 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Andreea-Mihaela Tamba, "Translating vs. Rewriting during the Romanian Communist Period — Prefaces to Translations of ''Vanity Fair'' and ''Tess of the d'Urbervilles''", in ''Philologica Jassyensia'', Vol. IX, Issue 2, 2013, pp. 267, 268, 269&lt;/ref&gt; Against her father's wish,&lt;ref name="acfresh"/&gt; she married in 1958 the actor [[Emanoil Petruț]], who survived her by two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Loreta Popa, [http://jurnalul.ro/cultura/film/amintiri-din-copilarie-534042.html "Amintiri din copilărie"], in ''[[Jurnalul Național]]'', January 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Mihai Ralea's death, coinciding with a spell of liberalization, created unexpected room for maneuver for a younger generation of literary critics and historians, who were anti-sociological, subjectivist, and [[Post-structuralism|post-structuralist]].&lt;ref&gt;Florin Mihăilescu, ''De la proletcultism la postmodernism'', Editura Pontica, Constanța, 2002, pp. 117–118.  {{ISBN|973-9224-63-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, some members of this intellectual school, such as [[Adrian Marino]]&lt;ref name="agutopia"/&gt; and [[Matei Călinescu]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Șerban Axinte]], "Modele ale criticii literare postbelice. E. Lovinescu, G. Ibrăileanu, G. Călinescu", in ''Philologica Jassyensia'', Nr. 2/2011, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; continued to draw inspiration from Ralea, having rediscovered his early Bergsonian essays. They were joined in this by [[Alexandru Ivasiuc]], the novelist and Marxist literary theorist.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lovinescu, pp. 395–398&lt;/ref&gt; From within the anti-communist movement, Ralea was defended by author [[Nicolae Steinhardt]]. Although a devout Orthodox, Steinhardt treasured the non-believers Ralea and [[Paul Zarifopol]] for their "quick wit".&lt;ref&gt;[[Eugen Simion]], "Nicolae Steinhardt", in ''Caiete Critice'', Issues 1–2/2007, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|1989 Revolution]] and the fall of communism, Ralea's Dobrina estate was transferred by government order to the [[Diocese of Huși|Orthodox Diocese of Huși]], and came to host a convent.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), p. 385&lt;/ref&gt; His Dorobanți villa, which Catinca Ralea had sold, bears a memorial plaque honoring the sociologist.&lt;ref&gt;Lazu, pp. 197, 325&lt;/ref&gt; By Government Act 503/1998, the Romanian Academy Institute of Psychology was renamed ''Mihai Ralea Institute''.&lt;ref&gt;"Guvernul României. Hotărârea nr. 503/1998 privind modificarea denumirii unor unități de cercetare din subordinea Academiei Române", in ''[[Monitorul Oficial]]'', Part I, Nr. 307/1998&lt;/ref&gt; The Huși library, also named after Ralea, has been hosting the entire corpus of his works since 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.vrn.ro/biblioteca-husi-are-acum-intreaga-colectie-a-scrierilor-lui-mihai-ralea "Biblioteca Huși are acum întreaga colecție a scrierilor lui Mihai Ralea!"], in ''Vremea Nouă'', November 4, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea's early sociological writings were republished, as ''Fenomenul Românesc'', in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Balázs Trencsényi, "Conceptualizarea caracterului național în tradiția intelectuală românească", in Neumann &amp; Heinen, pp. 355, 376&lt;/ref&gt; By then, his sociological contribution was being reassessed in various ways, leading to a reissue of his essays as a 1997 volume, put out by [[Constantin Schifirneț]] at [[Editura Albatros]].&lt;ref name="zavr187–188"/&gt; Around 1995, a heated public debate erupted, focusing on the careers of leftist intellectuals such as Ralea, and their supposed acts of self-betrayal. The central question, brought up by researcher [[Marin Nițescu]], was: would they have done better not to publish at all under communism?&lt;ref&gt;Vasile (2010), pp. 21, 297–298&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, a group of sociologists defended Ralea's prestige, noting that "we [Romanians] are inexcusably delaying in recognizing Mihai Ralea's sociological contribution".&lt;ref name="cz&amp;al7"/&gt;

'''Miniature art''' or '''painting in little''' is a genre that focuses on art (especially painting, engraving and sculpture) with a long history that dates back to the scribes of the medieval ages. Miniature art societies, such as the World Federation of Miniaturists (WFM), provide applicable definitions of the term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldfm.org/definitions.htm Size definitions of miniature painting] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20020204032723/http://www.worldfm.org/definitions.htm |date=2002-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An often-used definition is that a piece of miniature art can be held in the palm of the hand, or that it covers less than 25 square inches or 100&amp;nbsp;cm². Subjects are depicted in 1/6 actual size, and in all paintings the spirit of miniaturisation should be maintained.

Miniature art has been made for over 1000 years and is prized by collectors. The U.S. [[White House]], the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]], [[Astolat Dollhouse Castle]], and museums around the world have collections of miniature paintings, drawings, original prints and etchings, and sculpture.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

==Characters and cast==

===Main cast===

'''Don DeWitt''' is a child of the Nintendo Generation. He was raised on a diet of video games from [[Mario (franchise)|Mario]] to [[Call of Duty]], [[Final Fantasy]] to [[Double Dragon]] and everything in between. His father got him his first ever gaming console, an original [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]], when he was just a kid and after his father, died Don's prevalent memory of his departed father was playing video games with him as a kid.

Since then he's grown up with his left thumb on a directional pad and his right thumb on the A button. Always so involved in gaming that he neglected the outside world, never realized the potential he had to be somebody and slowly started to feel like an outcast. Even his favorite social spot is a Gamer Bar in his home city of London.

Don one day is pulled him into an alternate reality where the video games are real life. At first this could be a dream come true for Don, he's now standing in the worlds that he could only explore through a television screen before... but soon he realizes this is far from a dream-scenario, because if he is killed now, it truly is Game Over. Don is portrayed by series creator [[Petros L. Ioannou]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mylifeasavideogame.com/#!don-dewitt/c22o5 Don DeWitt Character Description], Official Website&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kera Althorn''' is only child of the Emperor of the Great Interstellar Althorn Empire, is a young woman who as her title would suggest had everything. She was always taken care of, never had to lift a finger to do anything . But it wasn't to last...

When a military coup broke out led by the brutal General Atticus Dynas and Kera's family was overthrown and killed, Kera was thrown into a prison cell. Kera wasn't going to take this lying down though. She might not have been active in the past but she was sure as hell going to do something about it now.

Kera breaks out of prison using the help of her family's personal M.E.N.U, a sentient super-computer, and steals an old ambassadorial ship called "The Fortress" and flies away. Kera remembers one thing, the story of the Grand Champion, who united all the video game heroes once to combat an impossible threat. She now travels from world to world seeking alliances with the Champions to take back her throne as she truly becomes a self-sufficient soldier. Kera is portrayed by [[Jennifer Polansky]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mylifeasavideogame.com/#!kera-althorn/cdyo Kera Althorn Character Description], Official Website&lt;/ref&gt;

'''M.E.N.U''' (or simply '''Menu''') is the Multi-Electrical Networked User System is a highly sophisticated sentient super-computer that can process at twenty-trillion petaflops and contains virtually the entire database of the Althorn Empire stored in its drives, yet still finds the time to make the occasional sarcastic remark, witty retort and highly refined dick, butt or fart joke.

Loyal to Kera's family, Menu was a super computer designed to make their lives easier, and while in most science fiction that means he's going to turn evil, Menu is quite the opposite. In fact when everyone turned against the Royal Family, Menu stuck with Kera and now aids her on her quest to bring down her father's murderer.

Menu often appears as a floating head and hands on a screen, be it on the ship The Fortress, or on Kera and Don's wrist mounted portable system. He acts as an interface helping the heroes to communicate and is always on hand with a wise-crack or two or six. Menu is portrayed by [[brentalfloss]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mylifeasavideogame.com/#!menu/c1utl Menu Character Description], Official Website&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''My Life as a Video Game'' was originally conceived by writer Petros L. Ioannou, as a video game review show. Each review would involve his being sucked into the game he was reviewing good or bad to point out the flaws. However slowly as it developed, Ioannou decided to make it more of a [[scripted television|scripted comedy show]] with an ongoing storyline and soon reviewer element was removed entirely in favour of a more plot and character driven narrative that would seek to analyse and poke fun at [[Video game culture|gaming culture]] on a whole, while creating its own universe. This also would allow him to analyse gaming genres from the past, that might not be as common anymore such as the [[Beat 'em up]] and more modern ones such as the [[First Person Shooter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=‘My Life As A Video Game’: Petros Ioannou &amp; BrentalFloss Power Up With NMR [INTERVIEW]|url=http://newmediarockstars.com/2014/04/my-life-as-a-video-game-petros-ioannou-brentalfloss-power-up-with-nmr-interview/|accessdate=11 April 2014|newspaper=NewMediaRockstars.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kickstarter===
On October 21, 2013, Leon Films, with a video from producer [[Petros L. Ioannou]] and co-star [[brentalfloss|Brent Black]], launched a [[crowdfunding]] effort for ''My Life as a Video Game'' on [[Kickstarter]] with 35&amp;nbsp;days to reach a goal of $30,000. With the help of a video from Black on his channel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-cRWJpZmSQ Check out the NEW SHOW, I'm in!], brentalfloss YouTube channele&lt;/ref&gt; released about two weeks into the Kickstarter, the project reached is goal and raised $32,314 in total.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/leonfilms/my-life-as-a-video-game-a-new-webseriesQ My Life as a Video Game - A New Webseries!], kickstarter.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
The show is based around "arcs", each corresponding to three episodes of a story roughly ten minutes in length. Together they combine one television length episode for easier viewing together. The only exception to this is the pilot episode which stands alone, though is considered to be part of the First Person Shooter arc that takes place immediately afterward.

She was a student and later teacher at the [[Bauhaus]]. Berger was born in [[Zmajevac]], part of present-day [[Croatia]]. Berger had Yugoslav citizenship, but is often credited among Hungarian artists.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://bauhaus-online.de/en/magazin/artikel/otti-berger-croatian-artist-from-the-bauhaus-textile-worksho|title = Otti Berger – Croatian Artist from the Bauhaus Textile Workshop {{!}} Bauhaus Online|website = bauhaus-online.de|access-date = 2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Berger completed education at the Collegiate School for Girls in Vienna before enrolling in the Royal Academy of Arts and Crafts in Zagreb, now the [[Academy of Fine Arts, University of Zagreb]].  She continued her studies in Zagreb until 1926 before attending [[Bauhaus]] in [[Dessau]], Germany.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://bauhaus-online.de/en/atlas/personen/otti-berger|title = Otti Berger {{!}} Bauhaus Online|website = bauhaus-online.de|access-date = 2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, Berger studied under [[László Moholy-Nagy]], [[Paul Klee]], and [[Wassily Kandinsky]], among others. Berger has been described as "one of the most talented students at the weaving workshop in Dessau."&lt;ref&gt;Weibel, Peter.

Vienna: Springer-Verlag, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  Along with Anni Albers and Gunta Stözl, Berger pushed back against the understanding of textiles as a feminine craft and utilized rhetoric used in photography and painting to describe her work.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt; During her time in [[Dessau]], she also wrote a treatise on fabrics and the methodology of textile production, which stayed with [[Walter Gropius]] and was never published.&lt;ref name="Beyond"/&gt; Berger is the only designer from Bauhaus who sought patents for her textiles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Berger became a deputy to designer [[Lilly Reich]] in the textile workshop at Bauhaus. She began to create her own curriculum, and acted as a mentor to younger Bauhaus students who carried on Bauhaus methods, including Paris-based weaver Zsuzsa Markos-Ney and  {{Interlanguage link multi|Etel Fodor-Mittag|de|}}, who became a hand weaver in South Africa.&lt;ref name="Beyond"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Not allowed to work in Germany under Nazi rule because of her Jewish roots, Berger closed her company down in 1936.  Berger fled to London, where attempts to emigrate to United States to work with her fiancee [[Ludwig Hilberseimer]] and other Bauhaus professors failed.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Linn.

'''''Pietà''''' is a painting by the Italian Renaissance artist [[Pietro Perugino]], executed around 1483-1493, and housed in the  [[Uffizi Gallery]],  [[Florence]]. 
[[File:Pietro Perugino 064.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Detail of Mary's face.]]

==History==
The work was painted for the church of the convent of San Giusto alle mura together with the ''[[Agony in the Garden (Perugino)|Agony in the Garden]]'' and a ''[[Crucifixion (Perugino)|Crucifixion]]''. Renaissance art biographer [[Giorgio Vasari]] saw them in side altars  of the church of San Giovanni Battista alla Calza, after the original location had been destroyed during the [[Siege of Florence (1529–1530)|Siege of Florence]] in 1529. It was moved to the Uffizi in the 20th century.

The dating of the work is disputed: it varies from 1482, the year of Perugino's return from Rome, to a slightly later period, although before the end of the century, when the artist started to use only line oil, which in these works is used only at an experimental level.

The painting was restored in 1998.

==Description==
The  scene of the [[Pietà]] was depicted by Perugino under a portico, a typical theme of his art in the 1480s and 1490s (used for example in the [[Albani-Torlonia Polyptych]] of the ''[[Madonna with Child Enthroned between Saints John the Baptist and Sebastian]]''). The serene landscape with light trees is also common in his paintings of the period.

Such as in the German [[Vesperbild]]er, Jesus's body is horizontal and quite rigid, also held by John the Evangelist on the left and Mary Magdalene on the right. At the sides are further saints, a young one (Nicodemus) on the left, with the hands joined in his chest, and an aged one (John of Arimathea) on the right, looking down.

The use of less pale tonalities for Mary Magdalene is similar to that used by [[Luca Signorelli]] at the time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17649">'''Political satire''' is [[satire]] that specializes in gaining entertainment from [[politics]]; it has also been used with [[subversive]] intent where [[Political discourse analysis|political speech]] and dissent are forbidden by a regime, as a method of advancing political arguments where such arguments are expressly forbidden.

Political satire is usually distinguished from political [[protest]] or [[political dissent]], as it does not necessarily carry an agenda nor seek to influence the political process. While occasionally it may, it more commonly aims simply to provide entertainment. By its very nature, it rarely offers a constructive view in itself; when it is used as part of protest or dissent, it tends to simply establish the error of matters rather than provide solutions.

==Origins and genres==
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Ghjkl.JPG|left|thumb|Animated shows like South Park are notorious for political satire]] --&gt;
Satire can be traced back throughout history; wherever organized [[government]], or social categories, has existed, so has satire.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

The oldest example that has survived till today is [[Aristophanes]]. In his time satire targeted top politicians, like Cleon,&lt;ref&gt;Stephanos Matthaios, Franco Montanari, Antonios Rengakos [https://books.google.com/books?id=EZuetiBvK-wC&amp;pg=PA207&amp;lpg=PA207 ''Ancient Scholarship and Grammar: Archetypes, Concepts and Contexts''] pp.207-8&lt;/ref&gt; and religion, at the time headed by Zeus. "Satire and derision progressively attacked even the fundamental and most sacred facts of faith," leading to an increased doubt towards religion by the general population.&lt;ref&gt;[[Victor Ehrenberg (historian)|Ehrenberg, Victor]] (1962) [https://books.google.com/books?id=oikOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA263 ''The people of Aristophanes: a sociology of old Attic comedy''] p.263 quotation: {{quotation|The fact that the gods could be brought down to a human or 'far too human' level is certainly rooted in the very nature of Greek religion, and there is no doubt that this attitude contributed to the gradual undermining of the old belief in the gods. [...] To tell immoral and scandalous stories about the gods did not offend average religious feeling; it troubled only advanced spirits like Xenophanes and Pintar [...] and it is clear that people no longer believed either in the story or in Zeus. Satire and derision progressively attacked even the fundamental and most sacred facts of faith, above all faith in the gods' power, and it was from this that doubt began to grow.&lt;br&gt; The power of the gods, whose dignity and stringth were impressively reflected in most of the tragedies, however different the religious attitudes of the tragic poets were, this same power was on the same festival days belittled and questioned by the comic poets who made fun of the gods and represented traditional and sacred forms in a starling manner.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman period, for example, gives us the satirical poems and epigrams of [[Martial]]. [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]] philosophers often engaged in political satire.

Due to lack of political freedom of speech in many ancient civilizations, [[covert satire]] is more usual than overt satire in ancient literatures of [[political liberalism]]. Historically, the [[public opinion]] in the [[Athenian democracy]] was remarkably influenced by the political [[satire]] performed by the [[comic poets]] at the [[Ancient Greek theatre|theatres]].&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, J. (1993) ''Comic Hero versus Political Elite'' pp.307-19 in {{cite book |editor=Sommerstein, A.H. |editor2=S. Halliwell |editor3=J. Henderson |editor4=B. Zimmerman |title=Tragedy, Comedy and the Polis |year=1993 |publisher=Levante Editori |location=Bari}}&lt;/ref&gt; Watching or reading satire has since ancient time been considered one of the best ways to understand a culture and a society.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes I: Clouds, Wasps, Birds'', Peter Meineck (translator) and Ian Storey (Introduction), Hackett Publishing 2000, page X&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emil J. Piscitelli (1993) [http://mysite.verizon.net/thelogos/lect-2.htm ''Before Socrates-Diotima''] ''The Special Case of Aristophanes: Tribal and Civil Justice''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Life of Aristophanes'', pp.42-seq&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 20th and 21st Centuries satire is found in an increasing number of media (in [[cartoon]]s as [[political cartoon]]s with heavy [[caricature]] and exaggeration, and in [[List of political magazines|political magazine]]s) and the parallel exposure of [[political scandal]]s to performances (including [[television]] shows). Examples include musicians such as [[Tom Lehrer]], live performance groups like the [[Capitol Steps]] and the [[Montana Logging and Ballet Co.]], and public television and live performer [[Mark Russell]]. Additional subgenres include such literary classics as ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' and ''[[Animal Farm]]'', and more recently, internet ''[[Ezine]]'' and website sources such as ''[[The Onion]]''.

==19th century==
===France===
One example is [[Maurice Joly]]'s 1864 pamphlet entitled ''[[The Dialogue in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu]]'' (''Dialogue aux enfers entre Machiavel et Montesquieu''), which attacks the political ambitions of [[Napoleon III]]. It was first published in [[Brussels]] in 1864. The piece used the literary device of a [[dialogue]] between two diabolical plotters in [[Hell]], the historical characters of [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]] and [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]], to cover up a direct, and illegal, attack on Napoleon's rule.  The noble baron Montesquieu made the case for [[liberalism]]; the [[Florence|Florentine]] political writer Machiavelli presented the case for cynical [[despotism]]. In this manner, Joly communicated the secret ways in which liberalism might spawn a despot like Napoleon III. However, [[The Prince#Interpretation of The Prince as political satire|''The Prince'']] itself has also been sometimes understood as political satire.

===Germany===

According to [[George Santayana|Santayana]], Nietzsche was actually "a keen satirist".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophicalsociety.com/Archives/Santayana%27s%20Criticism%20of%20Nietzsche.htm#The%20Superman George Santayana : ''Egotism in German Philosophy''. 1915. chapter 13.]&lt;/ref&gt;
"Nietzsche's satire" was aimed at Lutheranism.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1kRbO4M5CB0C&amp;pg=PA109&amp;lpg=PA109&amp;dq=Nietzsche+%22Lutheran+revivalist%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gniaAiHyMW&amp;sig=bx8O9CCvIvECzRJ3MPV81Nr-I2o&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=bFrSSYrzKorItgfV14zxBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result Christa Davis Acampora &amp; Ralph R. Acampora : ''A Nietzchean Bestiary''. Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2003. p. 109]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In UK media==
The UK has a long tradition of political satire, dating from the early years of English literature. In some readings, a number of [[William Shakespeare]]'s plays can be seen – or at least performed – as satire, including ''[[Richard III]]'' and ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]''. Later examples such as [[Jonathan Swift]]'s ''[[A Modest Proposal]]'' are more outright in their satirical nature.

In modern era, political satire in the [[United Kingdom]] includes pamphlets and newspaper articles, such as ''[[Private Eye]]'', topical television panel shows such as ''[[Have I Got News for You]]'', and television series such as ''[[Yes Minister]]'', ''[[House of Cards (UK TV series)|House of Cards]]'' and ''[[The Thick of It]]'' and ''[[ToryBoy The Movie]]''.

==On American television==
Satire became more visible on American television during the 1960s. Some of the early shows that used political satire include the British and American versions of the program ''[[That Was the Week That Was]]'' (airing on the [[American Broadcasting Company]], or ABC, in the U.S.), [[CBS]]'s ''[[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'', and [[NBC]]'s ''[[Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In]]''. During the months leading up to the 1968 presidential election, [[Richard Nixon]] appeared on ''Laugh-In'' and repeated the program's catch-phrase "Sock it to me."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1wy49i-gQjIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=satire+tv&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=o7CaUfOdKu2j4APYpYCwBg&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAA Jonathan Gray, Jeffrey P. Jones &amp; Ethan Thompson : ''Satire TV: Politics and Comedy in the Post-Network Era''. New York University Press, 2009. p. 22]&lt;/ref&gt; Other forms of satire of the 1960s and early 1970s typically used the sitcom format, such as the show ''[[All in the Family]]''.

When ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' debuted in 1975, the show began to change the way that comedians would depict the president on television. [[Chevy Chase]] opened the fourth episode of the show with his impersonation of a bumbling [[Gerald Ford]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1wy49i-gQjIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=satire+tv&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=o7CaUfOdKu2j4APYpYCwBg&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAA Jeffrey P. Jones, "With All Due Respect: Satirizing Presidents from ''Saturday Night Live'' to ''Lil' Bush''", in Jonathan Gray, Jeffrey P. Jones &amp; Ethan Thompson : ''Satire TV: Politics and Comedy in the Post-Network Era''. New York University Press, 2009. p. 39-41]&lt;/ref&gt; Chase did not change his appearance to look like President Ford, and he portrayed the president by repeatedly falling down on the stage. Some of the other famous presidential impersonations on ''Saturday Night Live'' include [[Dan Aykroyd]]'s [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Jimmy Carter]] caricatures, [[Dana Carvey]] as [[George H. W. Bush]], [[Darrell Hammond]] as [[Bill Clinton]], [[Will Ferrell]] as [[George W. Bush]], and [[Jay Pharoah]] as [[Barack Obama]]. Hammond was the first cast member to impersonate [[Donald Trump]], but now [[Alec Baldwin]] portrays him.

During the 2008 presidential campaign, ''Saturday Night Live'' gained wide attention because former cast member [[Tina Fey]] returned to the show to satirize Republican Vice Presidential candidate [[Sarah Palin]]. In addition to Fey's striking physical resemblance to Palin, the impersonation of the vice presidential candidate was also noteworthy because of Fey's humorous use of some of exactly the same words Palin used in media interviews and campaign speeches as a way to perform political satire.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=b_Kaca5Fp-wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=entertaining+politics&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BryaUZqoKYb_4AOXtoDQBw&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA Jeffrey P. Jones, ''Entertaining Politics: Satiric Television and Political Engagement''. 2nd edition. Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2010. p.4]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Saturday Night Live'' also uses political satire throughout its ''[[Weekend Update]]'' sketch. ''Weekend Update'' is a fake news segment on the show that satirizes politics and current events. It has been a part of ''SNL'' since the first episode of the show on October 11, 1975.

''[[The Daily Show]]'' and ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' use stylistic formats that are similar to ''Weekend Update''. On ''The Daily Show'', host [[Jon Stewart]] used footage from news programs to satirize politics and the news media. [[Stephen Colbert]] performed in character on ''The Colbert Report'' as a right-wing news pundit. Both hosts' television programs were broadcast on [[Comedy Central]], while ''The Daily Show'' continues to run featuring [[Trevor Noah|a new host]]. Colbert became the host of ''[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert|The Late Show]]'', succeeding David Letterman. With their shows, Stewart and Colbert helped increase public and academic discussion of the significance of political satire. ''[[Last Week Tonight with John Oliver]]'' and ''[[The Jim Jefferies Show]]'' are also examples of political commentary.

== Influence in politics ==

=== Contributions ===
According to the findings of the 2004 [[Pew Research Center|Pew Survey]], both younger and older audiences are turning to late-night comedy shows as not only a source of entertainment, but also for an opportunity to gain political awareness.&lt;ref name="Baym"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baym|first1=Geoffrey|title=The Daily Show: Discursive Integration and the Reinvention of Political Journalism|journal=Political Communication|volume=22|pages=259–276|doi=10.1080/10584600591006492|issn=1091-7675}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, Geoffrey Baym suggests that shows that make use of political satire, such as ''[[The Daily Show]]'', should be considered as a form of [[alternative media|alternative journalism]].&lt;ref name="Baym" /&gt; Utilizing satire has shown to be an attractive feature in news programming, drawing in the audiences of less politically engaged demographic cohorts. Moreover, satire news programming can be considered alternative because satire plays an important role in dissecting and critiquing  power.&lt;ref name="Baym" /&gt;

In his article ''The Daily Show: Discursive Integration and the Reinvention of Political Journalism'', Baym detailed how ''[[The Daily Show]]'', then hosted by [[Jon Stewart]], presented news stories. For the satire news show, presenting information in a comprehensive manner was used to give viewers a greater perspective of a situation.&lt;ref name="Baym" /&gt; Often, Stewart studded his segments with additional background information, or reminders of relevant and past details.&lt;ref name="Baym" /&gt; For example, ''[[The Daily Show]]'' displayed the full video of [[George W. Bush|Bush's]] comments regarding [[George Tenet|Tenet's]] resignation in 2004.&lt;ref name="Baym" /&gt; This was a deliberate choice by the show in attempt to give a more sincere representation of the event.&lt;ref name="Baym" /&gt; Moreover, it can be seen as a challenge and critique of what more traditional news shows failed to include.&lt;ref name="Baym" /&gt; In this way, satire news can be seen as more informative than other news sources. Notably, research findings released by [[National Annenberg Election Survey|National Annenberg Election Survey (NAES)]] concede that followers of satire news are more knowledgeable and consume more news than the general population.&lt;ref name="Baym" /&gt;

Meanwhile, Joseph Faina has considered the satire used in news shows as a facilitator in developing a [[Citizen journalism|public journalism]] practice.&lt;ref name="Faina" /&gt; Faina explains in his article that the nature of satire encourages viewers to become politically engaged, and a [[Citizen journalism|civic participant]], in which the humor exercised by hosts elicit responses in viewers.&lt;ref name="Faina" /&gt; However, Faina has acknowledged that this model is somewhat idealistic.&lt;ref name="Faina" /&gt; Nevertheless, Faina argues that the potential still exists.&lt;ref name="Faina" /&gt; Not to mention, with the rise in technology and the growing ubiquity of cellular phones, it can be argued that civic participation is all the more easier to accomplish.&lt;ref name="Fenton"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fenton|first1=Natalie|editor1-last=Allan|editor1-first=Stuart|title=News in the Digital Age|journal=The Routledge Companion to News and Journalism (1|date=October 2009|pages=557–567|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis e-Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Concerns ===
Though satire in news is celebrated as a vehicle toward a more informed public, such view is not universally shared among scholars.&lt;ref name="Young"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Young|first1=Dannagal G.|title=Lighten up: How satire will make American politics relevant again|url=http://archives.cjr.org/cover_story/lighten_up.php|website=Columbia Journalism Review|accessdate=April 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have expressed their hesitancy toward the infiltration of lighthearted practices to cover more dire topics like political affair.&lt;ref name="Young" /&gt; Potentially off-color remarks, or vulgar comments made by the likes of [[Stephen Colbert]] of ''[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert]]'', or [[Samantha Bee]], host of ''[[Full Frontal with Samantha Bee]]'', can be used as examples of what critics are concerned over. Here, satire is believed to diminish the gravity of a topic.&lt;ref name="Faina"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Faina|first1=Joseph|title=Public journalism is a joke: The case for Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert|journal=Journalism|date=2012|volume=14|issue=4|pages=541 –555|doi=10.1177/1464884912448899}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baym proposes that as these shows are [[alternative media|alternative]], they have no obligation to "abide by standard practices".&lt;ref name="Baym" /&gt; Unlike traditional news sources, which may be required to adhere to certain agendas, like political affiliation or advertising restrictions, hosts of satire news shows are free and zealous to showcase personal contributions through their mentions of disdain, qualms, and excitement. Critics of satire in news shows thus believe that the showcasing of an overly and openly frustrated host will induce or perpetuate "cynicism in viewers".&lt;ref name="Young" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Faina" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4798">'''Probabilistic design''' is a discipline within [[engineering design]]. It deals primarily with the consideration of the effects of [[random variable|random variability]] upon the performance of an [[engineering system]] during the design phase. Typically, these effects are related to quality and reliability. Thus, probabilistic design is a tool that is mostly used in areas that are  concerned with quality and [[reliability engineering|reliability]]. For example, product design, quality control, systems engineering, [[machine design]], [[civil engineering]] (particularly useful in [[limit state design]]) and manufacturing. It differs from the classical approach to design by assuming a small probability of failure instead of using the [[safety factor]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

When using a probabilistic approach to design, the designer no longer thinks of each variable as a single value or number. Instead, each variable is viewed as a [[probability distribution]]. From this perspective, probabilistic design predicts the flow of variability (or distributions) through a system. By considering this flow, a designer can make adjustments to reduce the flow of random variability, and improve quality. Proponents of the approach contend that many quality problems can be predicted and rectified during the early design stages and at a much reduced cost.

==The objective of probabilistic design==
Typically, the goal of probabilistic design is to identify the design that will exhibit the smallest effects of random variability. This could be the one design option out of several that is found to be most robust. Alternatively, it could be the only design option available, but with the optimum combination of input variables and parameters. This second approach is sometimes referred to as [[robustification]], parameter design or [[Design for Six Sigma|design for six sigma]]

==Methods used==
Essentially, probabilistic design focuses upon the prediction of the effects of random variability. Some methods that are used to predict the random variability of an output include:

*the [[Monte Carlo method]] (including [[Latin hypercube sampling|Latin hypercubes]]);
*[[propagation of error]];
*[[design of experiments]] (DOE)
*[[method of moments (statistics)|the method of moments]]
*[[Statistical interference]]
*[[quality function deployment]]
*[[Failure mode and effects analysis]]

'''Robert Studley Forrest Hughes''' [[Officer of the Order of Australia|AO]] (28 July 1938{{spaced ndash}}6 August 2012) was an Australian-born [[art critic]], writer, and producer of [[television documentary|television documentaries]]. His best seller ''[[The Fatal Shore]]'' (1986) is a study of the British [[penal colony|penal colonies]] and [[History of Australia (1788–1850)|early history of Australia]]. He was described in 1997 by Robert Boynton of ''[[The New York Times]]'' as "the most famous art critic in the world."&lt;ref name="Boynton 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kennedy 2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kennedy|first=Randy|date=6 August 2012|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/07/arts/robert-hughes-art-critic-whose-writing-was-elegant-and-contentious-dies-at-74.html?pagewanted=all|title=Robert Hughes, Art Critic Whose Writing Was Elegant and Contentious, Dies at 74|work=The New York Times|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hughes earned widespread recognition for his book and television series on [[modern art]], ''[[The Shock of the New]]'', and for his longstanding position as art critic with ''[[TIME]]'' magazine. Known for his contentious critiques of art and artists, Hughes was generally conservative in his tastes, although he did not belong to a particular philosophical camp. His writing was noted for its power and elegance.&lt;ref name="Kennedy 2012" /&gt;

==Early life==
Hughes was born in [[Sydney]], Australia, in 1938. His father and paternal grandfather were lawyers. Hughes's father, [[Geoffrey Forrest Hughes]], was a pilot in the [[First World War]], with later careers as a solicitor and company director. He died from lung cancer when Robert was aged 12.&lt;ref name="Boynton 1997" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kennedy 2012" /&gt; His mother was Margaret Eyre Sealy, née Vidal. His older brother was Australian politician [[Tom Hughes (Australian politician)|Thomas Eyre Forrest Hughes]],&lt;ref name=duggan/&gt; and the uncle of former Sydney Lord Mayor [[Lucy Turnbull]], the wife of Australian Prime Minister [[Malcolm Turnbull]]. He had another brother Geoffrey and one sister, Constance.

Growing up in [[Rose Bay, New South Wales|Rose Bay, Sydney]],&lt;ref name="Carey 2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/07/robert-hughes-by-peter-carey|title='Robert Hughes was Australia's Dante,' says his friend Peter Carey|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=7 August 2012|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes was educated at [[Saint Ignatius' College, Riverview]] before studying arts and then architecture at the [[University of Sydney]].&lt;ref name="The Australian obituary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Williamson 2012"/&gt; At university, he associated with the [[Sydney Push|Sydney "Push"]] – a group of artists, writers, intellectuals and drinkers. Among the group were [[Germaine Greer]] and [[Clive James]].&lt;ref name="Boynton 1997"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.robertboynton.com/articleDisplay.php?article_id=1532|title=The Lives of Robert Hughes|last=Boynton|first=Robert S.|date=12 May 1997|work=[[The New Yorker]]|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Career==

=== As an art critic ===
Hughes, an aspiring artist and poet, abandoned his university endeavours to become first a cartoonist and then an art critic for the Sydney periodical ''[[The Bulletin|The Observer]]'', edited by [[Donald Horne]].&lt;ref name="Australian Book Review"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.vicnet.net.au/~abr/Current/Rose%20review.htm|title=Up On Stilts|last=Rose|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter Rose (poet)|work=[[Australian Book Review]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022081732/http://home.vicnet.net.au/~abr/Current/Rose%20review.htm|archivedate=22 October 2008|deadurl=yes|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes was briefly involved in the original Sydney version of [[Oz (magazine)|''Oz'' magazine]] and wrote art criticism for ''[[The Nation]]'' and ''[[Sunday Mirror|The Sunday Mirror]]''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Hughes left Australia for Europe in 1964, living for a time in Italy before settling in London in 1965,&lt;ref name="Boynton 1997" /&gt; where he wrote for ''[[The Spectator]]'', ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', ''[[The Times]]'', and ''The Observer'', among others, and contributed to the London version of ''Oz''. In 1970 he was appointed art critic for ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' magazine and moved to New York, where he soon became an influential voice.&lt;ref name="Williamson 2012" /&gt;

In 1966 Hughes published a history of [[Australian painting]] titled ''The Art of Australia'', still considered an important work.&lt;ref name="Boynton 1997" /&gt; 

Hughes co-produced, in association with German producer Reiner Moritz and Lorna Pegram, the BBC eight-part series ''[[The Shock of the New]]'' (1980) on the development of [[modern art]] since the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]]. It was accompanied by a book with the same title. John O'Connor of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said, "Agree or disagree, you will not be bored. Mr. Hughes has a disarming way of being provocative."&lt;ref name="O'Connor"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/11/arts/tv-view-a-provocative-new-series-on-modern-art-by-john-o-connor.html?pagewanted=all|title=A Provocative New Series on Modern Art|last=O'Connor|first=John|date=11 January 1981|work=New York Times|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hughes's TV series ''American Visions'' (1997) reviewed the history of [[Visual art of the United States|American art]] since the [[American Revolution|Revolution]].&lt;ref name="Boynton 1997" /&gt; Hughes's documentary on [[Francisco Goya]], ''Goya: Crazy Like a Genius'' (2002),&lt;ref name="The Australian obituary" /&gt; was broadcast on the first night of the new British domestic [[Digital television|digital service]], [[BBC Four]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} He created a one-hour update to ''The Shock of the New'', titled ''The New Shock of the New'', which first aired in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2004/jun/30/art1|title=Robert Hughes on updating The Shock Of The New|author=Robert Hughes|date=30 June 2004|work=Guardian|accessdate=31 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He published the first volume of his [[memoirs]], ''Things I Didn’t Know'', in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/books/features/things-i-didn-t-know-1-721027|title=Things I didn't know: Book review|date=14 October 2006|work=The Scotsman|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== As a journalist and historian ===
Hughes and [[Harold Hayes]] were recruited in 1978 to anchor the new [[ABC News]] (US) [[newsmagazine]] ''[[20/20 (US television show)|20/20]]''. His only broadcast, on 6 June 1978, proved so controversial that, less than a week later, ABC News president [[Roone Arledge]] terminated the contracts of both men, replacing them with veteran TV host [[Hugh Downs]].&lt;ref name="Kennedy 2012" /&gt;

A study of the British [[penal colony|penal colonies]] and [[History of Australia (1788–1850)|early European settlement of Australia]], it became an international best-seller.&lt;ref name="Kennedy 2012" /&gt; During the late 1990s, Hughes was a prominent supporter of the [[Australian Republican Movement]].&lt;ref name="BBC obituary"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-19158897|title=Australian art critic Robert Hughes dies, aged 74|publisher=BBC News|date=14 April 2003|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Australia: Beyond the Fatal Shore'' (2000) was a series musing on modern Australia and Hughes's relationship with it. During production, Hughes was involved in a near-fatal road accident.&lt;ref name="Rothenberg 1999" /&gt;

==Personal life==
Hughes met his first wife, Danne Emerson, in London in 1967. Together they became involved in the [[counterculture of the 1960s]], exploring drug use and sexual freedom.&lt;ref name="Kennedy 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maunder 2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/art-and-design/robert-hughes-turned-criticism-into-an-art-20120807-23r1m.html|title=Robert Hughes turned criticism into an art|last=Maunder|first=Patricia|date=7 August 2012|work=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They divorced in 1981; she died of a brain tumor in 2003.&lt;ref name="Kennedy 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Things 2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hughes|first=Robert|title=Things I Didn't Know: A Memoir|year=2006|publisher=[[Alfred A.

He had been in a long term relationship with fashion designer [[Jenny Kee]], who found his body on 15 April.

Hughes was married to his second wife, Victoria Whistler, a housewife from California, from 1981 until a divorce in 1996.&lt;ref name="Williamson 2012" /&gt;

In 1999, Hughes was involved in a near-fatal car accident south of [[Broome, Western Australia]]. He was returning from a fishing trip and driving on the wrong side of the road when he collided head on with another car carrying three occupants. He was trapped in the car for three hours before being airlifted to [[Perth]] in critical condition.&lt;ref name="Rothenberg 1999"&gt;{{cite web|first=Jackie|last=Rothenberg|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/art_critic_robert_hughes_seriously_YKMdoMNtlTcPQn04m1t6MO|title=Art Critic Robert Hughes Seriously Hurt In Crash|publisher=NYPOST.com|date=30 May 1999|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes was in a coma for five weeks after the crash.&lt;ref name="BBC News April 2003"/&gt; In a 2000 court hearing, Hughes's defence barrister alleged that the occupants of the other car had been transporting illicit drugs at the time of the accident and were at fault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jackie|last= Rothenberg|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/drug_link_eyed_for_men_who_struck_Iol2L0hHTHI4j3LAA7e7sO|title=Drug Link Eyed For Men Who Struck Hughes's Car| publisher=NYPOST.com|date=6 June 1999|accessdate=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 Hughes pleaded guilty to dangerous driving causing bodily harm and was fined A$2,500.&lt;ref name="BBC News April 2003"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/arts_and_culture/2946409.stm|title=Art critic admits crash guilt|date=14 April 2003|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also allegedly described the crown prosecutor, [[Lloyd Rayney]], as a "curry muncher", which resulted in a [[defamation]] action and out-of-court settlement.&lt;ref name=duggan&gt;Duggan, Paul.

In 2001, Hughes wed his third wife, the American artist and [[art director]] [[Doris Downes]]. "Apart from being a talented painter, she saved my life, my emotional stability, such as it is", he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2003/11/09/Floridian/The_art_of_conversati.shtml|title=The art of conversation|work=St. Petersburg Times Floridian|date=9 November 2003|last=Bennett|first=Lennie|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
After a long illness, Hughes died at [[Calvary Hospital, Bronx|Calvary Hospital]] in [[The Bronx]], [[New York City|New York]], on 6 August 2012, with his wife at his bedside. He was also survived by two stepsons from his wife's previous marriage, Freeborn Garrettson Jewett IV and Fielder Douglas Jewett; his brothers, Tom and Geoffrey Hughes; a sister, Mrs. Constance Crisp; and many nieces and nephews.&lt;ref name="Kennedy 2012"/&gt;

==Assessment==
When ''The Shock of the New'' was proposed to the BBC, television programmers were skeptical that a [[journalist]] could properly follow the aristocratic tone of [[Kenneth Clark]], whose ''[[Civilisation (TV series)|Civilisation]]'' had been so successful.&lt;ref name="McNay 2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=McNay|first=Michael|date=6 August 2012|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/07/robert-hughes|title=Robert Hughes obituary|work=The Guardian|accessdate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Shock of the New'' proved to be a popular and critical success: it has been assessed "much the best synoptic introduction to modern art ever written", taking as its premise the vitality gained by modern art when it ceded the need to replicate nature in favor of a more direct expression of human experience and emotion.&lt;ref name="Gopnik 2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gopnik|first=Adam|date=7 August 2012|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2012/08/postscript-robert-hughes.html|title=Postscript: Robert Hughes|work=The New Yorker|accessdate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes' explanations of modern art benefited from the coherence of his judgments, and were marked by his ability to summarise the essential qualities of his subject.&lt;ref name="McNay 2012"/&gt;

Whether positive or negative, his judgments were enthusiastic. He championed London painters like [[Frank Auerbach]] and [[Lucian Freud]], helping to popularise the latter in the United States, and wrote with unabashed admiration for [[Francisco Goya]] and [[Pierre Bonnard]].&lt;ref name="Lacayo 2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lacayo|first=Richard|date=7 August 2012|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2012/08/07/the-art-of-being-critical-robert-hughes-1938-2012/|title=The Art of Being Critical: Robert Hughes (1938–2012)|work=Time magazine|accessdate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast Hughes was dismissive of much [[postmodernism]] and [[neo-expressionism]], as well as the vicissitudes of a money-fueled art market.&lt;ref name="Lacayo 2012" /&gt; While his reviews expressed [[antipathy]] for the [[avant-garde]], he was beholden neither to any theory nor ideology, and managed to provoke both ends of the political spectrum.&lt;ref name="McNay 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Woodward|first1=Richard B.|title=The Most Feared Art Critic of His Time?|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443537404577577300626558944|website=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=28 February 2017|date=8 August 2012|quote=Robert Hughes, who died on Monday at the age of 74, leaves behind many admirers but few followers. The most feared art critic of his time, as learned as he was readable, he cultivated no acolytes who aped his opinions and verbal mannerisms, as did Clement Greenberg and Pauline Kael, critics of equal stature. Despite his professorial air, Hughes spurned academia and it has responded in kind.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He distrusted novelty in art for its own sake, yet he was also disdainful of a conservative aesthetic that avoided risk. Hughes, according to [[Adam Gopnik]], was drawn to work that was rough-hewn, "craft attempted with passion."&lt;ref name="Gopnik 2012"/&gt;

Hughes's critical prose, vivid in both praise and indignation, has been compared to that of [[George Bernard Shaw]],&lt;ref name="Gopnik 2012"/&gt; [[Jonathan Swift]]&lt;ref name="Lacayo 2012"/&gt; and [[William Shakespeare]].&lt;ref name="McNay 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lacayo 2012"/&gt; "His prose", according to a colleague, "was lithe, muscular and fast as a bunch of fives. He was incapable of writing the jargon of the art world, and consequently was treated by its mandarins with fear and loathing."&lt;ref name="McNay 2012"/&gt; In different moods he could write that "[[Julian Schnabel|Schnabel’s]] work is to painting what [[Sylvester Stallone|Stallone’s]] is to acting: a lurching display of oily pectorals,"&lt;ref name="Lacayo 2012"/&gt; as well as conclude that [[Antoine Watteau]] "was a connoisseur of the unplucked string, the immobility before the dance, the moment that falls between departure and nostalgia."&lt;ref name="McNay 2012"/&gt;

[[File:William Blake Samuel Collings, May-Day in London, 1784.jpg|thumb|300px|right| ''[[May Day]] in [[London]]'', engraving by [[William Blake]] based on art by Samuel Collings, The Wits Magazine Vol I May 1784]]

'''Samuel Collings''' ([[floruit|fl.]] 1780–1790?) was a British painter and caricaturist of 18th century.

==Life==
He first appeared as an exhibitor at the [[Royal Academy]] in 1784, sending ''The Children in the Wood, a Sketch;'' in 1785 he exhibited ''The Chamber of Genius,'' which was engraved by [[Thomas Rowlandson]]; in 1786 ''The Triumph of Sensibility.'' 
He exhibited for the last time in 1789, sending 'The Frost on the Thames, sketched on the spot.'{{sfn|Cust|1887}}

Collings is best known, however, as a caricaturist; he was a friend of [[Thomas Rowlandson]], and contributed designs, which were etched by Rowlandson for some of his satirical publications, notably the satires on [[Johnson]] and [[James Boswell|Boswell]]'s  ''[[The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides|Tour to the Hebrides]]'', (published by [[Elizabeth Jackson (publisher)| Elizabeth Jackson]] in 1786), and on [[Goethe]]'s ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]''. 
The original drawings for the former are in the [[South Kensington Museum]], and have been erroneously attributed to [[Henry Bunbury (caricaturist)|Henry Bunbury]].{{sfn|Cust|1887}}

To the ''[[The Wit's Magazine|Wit's Magazine]]'' for 1784 Collings contributed some designs of a humorous character, which were engraved by [[William Blake]] and others. 
To the same magazine he contributed verses, and seems to have been as productive with his pen as with his pencil. 
He painted a portrait of [[Lord Thurlow]], which was engraved by J. Condé; a picture by him, entitled 'The Disinherited Heir,' was published in aquatint by [[Francis Jukes]]. 
It is not known when he died.{{sfn|Cust|1887}}

==Plot==
Srirangam Brothers - Srinivasachari (K Viswanath) and Ranga (Srikanth) - are versatile Carnatic musicians. Srinivasachari is happily married but has no children. Ranga is a widower with two children. Srirangam Brothers are the biggest music directors in the Telugu film industry (Tollywood) and compose music for only traditional and classical genres. Srirangam Brothers always try to help aspiring singers in their music compositions. Surekha (Laya),  a TV anchor, falls in love with Ranga and they get married.

After marriage, Surekha, who initially respects her brother-in-law, starts to develop ill feelings towards him and becomes envious that even though her husband Ranga is the main factor for the music duo's success and has equal contribution in Srirangam Brothers music scores, Srinivasachari is the one who gets all the credit.

When Srinivasachari is awarded the Padmasri by the Government of India, Surekha rejects her sister's gifted saree and shows no inclination to come along with her family to attend Srinivasachari's felicitation by the President. Also, Surekha starts to show her hostile and disrespectful behavior towards Srinivasachari.

This situation provokes Srinivasachari who starts behaving unpredictably and lashes out at a film producer about his brother's music compositions (during his music sitting) and also at the media. When Ranga in his office becomes aware of this situation through the film producer, he returns home only to get dispirited to see Ranga's sister-in-law getting slapped by her husband, which leads to a heated argument between the two brothers and the family gets separated.

Surekha slowly understands Srinivasachari's and Ranga's music calibre and realizes that the two brothers can only excel in their music when they stay united. This transformation in Surekha eventually leads to the unity of the family just like Srirangam Brothers' different blends excel when they compose their music together.

==Soundtrack==

The audio soundtrack for ''Swarabhishekam'' was composed by [[Vidyasagar (music director)|Vidyasagar]]. The lyrics were written by [[Veturi Sundararama Murthy|Veturi]], [[Sirivennela Sitaramasastri|Sirivennela]] and Shanmukha Sharma.

'''''The Banquet of Cleopatra''''' is a painting by [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]] completed in 1744.&lt;ref name="ABC Radio National - 30 November 2003 - Tiepolo: Cleopatra's Banquet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/legacy/programs/sunmorn/stories/s999715.htm|title=Tiepolo: Cleopatra's Banquet|date=30 November 2003|work=[[ABC Radio National]]|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is now in the [[National Gallery of Victoria]] in [[Melbourne]], Australia.&lt;ref name="The Age - 12 June - 2010 - The finding of a Tiepolo masterpiece"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/the-finding-of-a-tiepolo-masterpiece-20100611-y3ob.html|title=The finding of a Tiepolo masterpiece|last=Gill|first=Raymond|date=12 June 2010|work=[[The Age]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|accessdate=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/col/work/4409 Museum page]&lt;/ref&gt;
This is the first of three large paintings of the subject done by Tiepolo.  In addition the much smaller oil studies or ''[[modelli]]'' for each survive.&lt;ref name="Christiansen, 152–153"&gt;Christiansen, 152–153&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tiepolo, Giovanni Battista - The Banquet of Cleopatra - 1746-47.PNG|thumb|Tiepolo's fresco version for the ballroom of the [[Palazzo Labia]], [[Venice]] (slightly trimmed)]]
Tiepolo returned to the subject a few years later at the [[Palazzo Labia]] in [[Venice]] with his [[fresco]]s on Antony and Cleopatra: the ''Banquet'' was paired with a ''Meeting of Cleopatra and Mark Anthony'' and surrounding scenes of gods and attendants.  Two further large oils by Tiepolo of these scenes are in [[Arkhangelskoye Palace]] near Moscow (1747, 338 x 600&amp;nbsp;cm).&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, 209&lt;/ref&gt;

Tiepolo typically made [[oil sketch]] [[modelli]] with varying degrees of finish to show his composition and, perhaps, submit it for approval to the client. The modello for the Melbourne painting is in the [[Musée Cognacq-Jay]] in Paris, and was owned by Count [[Francesco Algarotti]] until his death.&lt;ref name="Christiansen, 152"&gt;Christiansen, 152&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, 201&lt;/ref&gt;  There is a small ({{convert|46.3|x|66.7|cm|in}}) oil sketch by Tiepolo in the [[National Gallery, London]], which may relate to the Palazzo Labia,&lt;ref name="National Gallery - The Banquet of Cleopatra - 1740s, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/giovanni-battista-tiepolo-the-banquet-of-cleopatra|title=The Banquet of Cleopatra – 1740s, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo|publisher=[[National Gallery]]|accessdate=23 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it differs considerably from the work in Venice, and it is more usually regarded as a study for the Archangelskoye painting.  There is another small oil in the collection of [[Stockholm University]] in Sweden, a modello for the Palazzo Labia composition, and there are a number of preparatory drawings in various collections.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, 201, 209; Christiansen, 150–152&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
All three large compositions show the banquet taking place in the open air or a [[loggia]] with a grand architectural setting but with the sky visible, and include a raised terrace closing off the back of the pictorial space. In the Palazzo Labia and Arkhangelskoye paintings (and the Paris and London modelli) there are steps in the foreground leading up to the dining table; although the Melbourne painting lacks these steps, the pattern of the marble floor gives a similar visual effect.  Only the two or three main figures are seated, but various attendants stand around them.  All the compositions show a clear debt to the grandly theatrical feast paintings of [[Paolo Veronese]], nearly a century earlier, such as ''[[The Wedding at Cana]]'' (1563, [[Louvre]]) and ''[[The Feast in the House of Levi]]'' (1573, [[Accademia, Venice]]).  Venetian taste approved of such explicit reference to the city's artistic tradition.&lt;ref name="Christiansen, 152–153"/&gt;  In the Palazzo Labia the frescos were designed in conjunction with a scheme of [[trompe l'oeil]] architecture by [[Gerolamo Mengozzi Colonna]] embracing the whole space.  The frescos come almost down to the floor, so that the steps bring the main scene up to a height where they could be seen across a crowded room.&lt;ref&gt;Martineau &amp; Robinson, 194&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
The Melbourne painting was commissioned for [[Frederick Augustus I of Saxony|Frederick Augustus III, Elector of Saxony]], by his agent [[Francesco Algarotti]].&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, parts II and III&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a letter of 1744 from Algarotti to [[Heinrich von Brühl]] (1700–1763), the Saxon chief minister, he saw it unfinished in Tiepolo's studio, where it had been commissioned by someone else, and persuaded Tiepolo to finish it for [[Dresden]].&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen, 150&lt;/ref&gt; It has been speculated that the original commissioner was the English "[[Joseph Smith (art collector)|Consul Smith]]".&lt;ref name="Christiansen, 152"/&gt;

It was acquired in 1764 by [[Catherine the Great]] in Amsterdam.&lt;ref name="ABC Radio National - 30 November 2003 - Tiepolo: Cleopatra's Banquet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crikey - 8 July 2014 - A Tale of Two Queens: The NGV’s Cleopatra by Tiepolo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailyreview.crikey.com.au/a-tale-of-two-queens-the-ngvs-cleopatra-by-tiepolo/|title=A Tale of Two Queens: The NGV’s Cleopatra by Tiepolo|last=Anderson|first=Patricia|date=8 July 2014|publisher=[[Crikey]]|accessdate=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work remained in the collection of the [[Hermitage Museum]] in what was then [[Saint Petersburg]] and later became Leningrad. It was part of the [[Soviet sale of Hermitage paintings]], and was purchased by an English [[art dealer]] in 1932.&lt;ref name="The Age - 13 September 1961 - Tribulations of old master"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1300&amp;dat=19610913&amp;id=051VAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5qwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6178,1829449|title=Tribulations of old master|last=[[Stuart Sayers]]|date=13 September 1961|work=[[The Age]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|accessdate=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was purchased by the National Gallery of Victoria in 1933 for [[Australian pound|A£]]25,000;&lt;ref name="ABC Radio National - 30 November 2003 - Tiepolo: Cleopatra's Banquet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Age - 12 June - 2010 - The finding of a Tiepolo masterpiece"/&gt; according to some accounts the National Gallery in London wanted the painting, but stood aside to allow Melbourne to improve their collection.{{citation needed|date = July 2014}}

In 1974, while the [[Derg|Ethiopian Army]] was still busy consolidating power, Kapuściński "traveled to Ethiopia to seek out and interview Selassie's servants and closest associates on how the Emperor had ruled and why he fell."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powells.com/biblio?isbn=0679722033 |title=The Emperor by Ryszard Kapuscinski - Powell's Books |publisher=Powells.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In large part, the book is a study of the workings of a [[royal court]].

===The Collapse===
This section focuses on the ultimate downfall of Selassie, featuring an account by his valet, who was the last remaining servant in the Emperor's court.

'''''The Garden of Pan''''' is a painting by the [[pre-Raphaelite]] artist [[Edward Burne-Jones]] which was completed around 1886 and is currently housed at the [[National Gallery of Victoria]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/explore/collection/work/3823/ National Gallery of Victoria]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The subject of this painting was originally to form part of a piece inspired by Burne-Jones's visit to Italy in 1872.  The original had intended to depict "the beginning of the world — with [[Pan (god)|Pan]] and Echo and sylvan gods, and a forest full of centaurs, and a wild background of woods, mountains and rivers."&lt;ref name=wildman&gt;''Edward Burne-Jones, Victorian Artist-dreamer'' by Stephen Wildman, 1998, p266&lt;/ref&gt; The artist, at some point, decided that the subject was too large and settled on the present design in a series of sketches made in the mid-1870s.&lt;ref name=wildman /&gt;

A note in Burne-Jones's work record for 1876 states that he had started work on "the large picture of Pan in the woods", but it was not until 1886 that the picture could be said to be truly begun. The final picture was exhibited in the summer of 1887 at the Grosvenor Gallery.&lt;ref name=wildman /&gt;

The painting was purchased by the National Gallery of Victoria in 1919 as part of the [[Felton Bequest]].

'''''The Reverend Robert Walker Skating on Duddingston Loch''''', better known by its shorter title '''''The Skating Minister''''', is an [[oil painting]] attributed to [[Henry Raeburn]] in the [[National Gallery of Scotland]] in [[Edinburgh]]. It was practically unknown until about 1949, but has since become one of Scotland's best-known paintings. It is considered an icon of [[Scottish culture]], painted during one of the most remarkable periods in the country's history, the [[Scottish Enlightenment]].

== Robert Walker==
The minister portrayed in this painting is [[Robert Walker (minister)|Robert Walker]].  He was a [[Church of Scotland]] minister who was born on 30 April 1755 in [[Monkton, Ayrshire]].  When Walker was a child, his father had been minister of the [[Church of Scotland|Scots Kirk]] in [[Rotterdam]], so the young Robert almost certainly learnt to skate on the frozen canals of the Netherlands. He was licensed by the [[List of Church of Scotland synods and presbyteries|Presbytery of Edinburgh]] in 1770 at the age of fifteen. He married Jean Fraser in 1778 and had five children. He became a member of the [[Royal Company of Archers]] in 1779 and their chaplain in 1798.

He was minister of the [[Kirk of the Canongate|Canongate Kirk]] as well as being a member of the [[Edinburgh Skating Club]], the first [[figure skating club]] formed anywhere in the world.&lt;ref name=Hines2011&gt;{{cite book|first=James R. |last=Hines |title=Historical Dictionary of Figure Skating |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LSEkqy6BS44C&amp;pg=PA150 |date=2011-04-22 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=978-0-8108-7085-7 |page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The club met on [[Duddingston Loch]] as shown in the painting, or on [[Lochend, Edinburgh|Lochend]] loch to its northeast between Edinburgh and [[Leith]], when these lochs were suitably frozen.

==Appraisal==
The painting is unusual in both its composition and its setting. The subject matter, perhaps intentionally conveying Walker's ties with Holland, is reminiscent of seventeenth-century Dutch artworks, particularly those of [[Hendrick Avercamp]].  The Reverend skates in the efficient but difficult "travelling position", with both arms folded across his chest and his stern black outfit contrasts with the wild backdrop of Duddingston Loch.  According to [[Andrew Graham-Dixon]], "The pinkish grey crags and sky have been painted with great freedom, whereas the figure of Reverend Robert Walker himself is so tightly drawn and painted that he appears almost as a black silhouette against an icy, vaporous wilderness. Perhaps this was the artist's way of suggesting that, for all his apparent probity and self-restraint, the minister was at heart something of a romantic – a man, at any rate, with a penchant for communing with nature."&lt;ref name=AGD&gt;{{cite web|first=Andrew |last=Graham-Dixon|title= ITP 241: Reverend Dr Robert Walker Skating on Duddingston Loch, by Henry Raeburn. c.1795.  |date=12 December 2004|work= Sunday Telegraph|authorlink=Andrew Graham-Dixon|url=http://www.andrewgrahamdixon.com/archive/itp-241-reverend-dr-robert-walker-skating-on-duddingston-loch-by-henry-raeburn-c1795.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art historian Duncan Thomson notes that, "The filigree within the buckle on the strap at the skater's right knee and the taut complexities of the arrangement of the pink ribbons that binds the skates to his shoes are a reminder of the manipulative skills that Raeburn must have developed during his apprenticeship [as a jeweller and goldsmith] ... perhaps the tour de force of observation and the finding of equivalent forms are the marks that the skater (or those who have circled with him) has made on the ice: the curving grooves incised with some appropriate tool in a liquid, greyish white which has been spread over a darker grey that has been allowed to dry and the edges of these tiny furrows, more pronounced towards the bottom of the picture, tipped in with a purer white to simulate the froth of ice thrown aside by the cutting blade."&lt;ref name=AGD/&gt;

==Attribution controversy==
In March 2005, a curator from the [[Scottish National Portrait Gallery]] suggested that the painting was by French artist [[Henri-Pierre Danloux]] rather than by Henry Raeburn. Once this information had been brought to the attention of the Gallery, the label on the painting was altered to read “Recent research has suggested that the picture was actually painted [...] by Henri-Pierre Danloux.” Since this time, many people have debated this idea. It has been argued that Danloux was in Edinburgh during the 1790s, which happens to be the time period when ''The Skating Minister ''was created. Supposedly the canvas and scale of the painting appears to be that of a French painter, although Raeburn critics argue otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://news.scotsman.com/news/Doubts-over-Skating-Minister-cut.2614249.jp| title = Doubts over Skating Minister cut no ice with art experts| author = Blackley, Michael| date = 2005-03-30| accessdate = 2010-05-28| newspaper = The Scotsman}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Despite continuing controversy about its attribution, ''The Skating Minister'' was sent to New York City in 2005 to be exhibited in [[Christie's]] for [[Tartan Day]], an important Scottish celebration. James Holloway, director of the Scottish National Portrait Gallery,  told ''[[The Scotsman]]'' newspaper that his "gut reaction" was that it is by Raeburn.  The newspaper reported that "it is understood that [[Timothy Clifford|Sir Timothy Clifford]], director-general of the National Galleries of Scotland, now accepts the painting is a Raeburn."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://heritage.scotsman.com/tartanweek/If-Skating-Minister-isnt-Scottish.2686955.jp| title = If Skating Minister isn't Scottish, why send him to Tartan Week in New York?| author = Roberts, Laura| date = 2005-12-16| accessdate = 2010-05-28| newspaper = Scotsman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Cambridge UK based musical group [[Clean Bandit]] based a character in their music video for their song "[[Dust Clears]]" on ''The Skating Minister'' painting. The video has been posted by the band on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdfL2nY-Xs8 Clean Bandit - Dust Clears]. [[YouTube]]&lt;/ref&gt; The skating minister is portrayed by skater Nick Martin and the skating scenes were filmed on [[Lake Vattern]] in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://onthewight.com/2014/07/23/clean-bandit-skating-minister-isle-wight-artist-nick-martin/ |title=Clean Bandit's 'Skating Minister' reveals Island connection |publisher=Onthewight.com |date= |accessdate=2016-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Thunderstruck''''' is a 2012 [[Family film|family]] [[comedy film]] directed by [[John Whitesell]] and starring [[Taylor Gray]], along with professional [[basketball]] player [[Kevin Durant]], [[Brandon T. Jackson]], [[Doc Shaw]] and [[Jim Belushi]]. It was released on August 24, 2012.&lt;ref name="DurantPremieres" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Release" /&gt;

==Plot==
Brian is a 16-year-old living in [[Oklahoma]]. Though he has tried out for the school basketball team, the Eagles, he has never made it, resigned to being [[water boy]] for the team. While practicing at home, Brian's sister makes a video of him injuring himself. She shows the video around school, and it is eventually seen by Connor, the star player of the basketball team. Brian takes a liking to Isabelle, a new girl at school, but is embarrassed when Connor shows the video of him to the whole school. In order to cheer him up, Brian's dad takes him to a [[Oklahoma City Thunder|Thunder]] game against the [[Detroit Pistons]] at [[Chesapeake Energy Arena]] in [[Oklahoma City]].

At halftime, Brian is chosen to shoot a half-court shot which he misses and hits [[Rumble the Bison|Rumble, the mascot]] in the process. Later on, he meets [[Kevin Durant]] and expresses his desire to play just like him. When Durant signs the special edition Oklahoma City Thunder [[basketball (ball)|basketball]] that Brian got to shoot the half-court shot with, a surge of energy causes Durant's talent to transfer to Brian when he hands it over. The Thunder lose the game, with Durant shooting 0-13 in the 2nd half.

The next morning, Brian learns that Connor, who was at the game, recorded him missing the half-court shot and posted it online. Later that night he goes out to a carnival and sees Connor fail to hit shots to win a prize for the new girl, Isabelle. Connor challenges him to "do better", which Brian is able to do, winning a prize which he then gives to Isabelle. Meanwhile, Durant's performance declines at practices, but insists he's only in a slump.

After making several impressive shots at home, Brian decides to try out for the Eagles again. The coach, impressed by Brian's new skill, has Brian replace Connor as the team captain, and they win several games. Durant's agent learns of Brian and realizes that he is the same kid who missed the half-court shot. He tracks him down and explains that he believes Brian stole Durant's talent. He arranges for Durant and Brian to practice together to try to reverse it, but all attempts fail.

Shortly before the final game, Brian and Isabelle begin fighting about how Brian has changed. Eventually, Brian goes to apologize and, while watching the video of him missing the half-court shot at her house, realizes what has to be done to give Durant his talent back. He rides his bike all the way to Chesapeake Arena and finds Durant. He explains that he hit Rumble before the transfer, and theorized that was what had to happen to reverse it. Brian hits Rumble with exactly the same ball he used to shoot the half-court shot, and then repeats the conversation that he had with Durant at their first meeting. Durant gets his talent back, and the Thunder qualify for the [[NBA Playoffs|playoffs]].

At the final game for the Eagles, Brian is nervous about playing because he no longer has the talent. Though he plays rather poorly, with help from the other team members, including Connor, he still manages to lead his team to a close game and taking the final shot himself, makes the game-winning shot which sends the Eagles to the state playoffs for the first time in 32 years. Brian, who is gradually getting better at basketball, is later seen playing with Durant.

'''Tokyo Junior Orchestra Society''' (東京ジュニアオーケストラソサエティー) was established in April 1994 by Fuminori “Maro” Shinozaki, the Principal Concertmaster of the [[NHK Symphony Orchestra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bunkyocivichall.jp/play_detail?id=1032 |title=東京ジュニアオーケストラソサエティ第15回定期演奏会 &amp;#124; 公演･イベント情報 &amp;#124; 響きの森文京公会堂 文京シビックホール |publisher=Bunkyocivichall.jp |date= |accessdate=2015-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tjos.jp/file/aboutus.html |title=東京ジュニアオーケストラとは |publisher=Tjos.jp |date= |accessdate=2015-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orchestra members are instructed by members of professional orchestras and university instructors, including some former members of TJOS.

Most members are currently enrolled in pre-collegiate music programs, contributing to its reputation as one of the most selective youth orchestras in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = 音楽で猛暑を涼しく|last = |first = |date = |work = Tokyo Shinbun Newspaper|access-date = |via = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = 東京ジュニアオーケストラソサエティー|last = |first = |date = |journal = サラサーテ |volume=24 |doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = 時代を超えて音楽を継承していくために|last = |first = |date = |work = フンカ|access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prospective members must pass auditions held throughout the year.

Past performances include a performance of Chopin’s Piano Concerto no.1 with [[Aimi Kobayashi]] which was broadcast on television in 2010, joint concerts with the [[NHK Symphony Orchestra]], were also broadcast on television, and the [[California Youth Symphony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.to-on.com/artistpromotion/news/20101220174831/ |title=NHK BS番組「みんなのショパン」再放送決定！（小林愛実）｜アーティスト・プロモーション事業部｜株式会社東音企画 |publisher=To-on.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its motto is "interplay", in which members interact to form a tightly knit ensemble and "society", which is reflected in its name.

Tokyo Junior Orchestra Society was accredited by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government as an endorsed NPO in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.npo-homepage.go.jp/Portal/corpDetail!show.action?no=013007903|title = ＮＰＯ法人の詳細情報|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.npo-homepage.go.jp/about/houjin-info/shokatsunintei-meibo/pref-tokyo|title = 認定・仮認定NPO法人名簿(東京都)|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Vienna Genesis''' ([[Vienna]], [[Österreichische Nationalbibliothek]], cod. theol. gr. 31), designated by siglum '''L''' (Ralphs), is an [[illuminated manuscript]], probably produced in [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]] in the first half of the 6th Century. It is the oldest well-preserved, surviving, illustrated biblical [[codex]].

== Description ==
The text is a fragment of the [[Book of Genesis]] in the Greek [[Septuagint]] translation. The text is frequently abbreviated. There are twenty-four surviving [[Bookbinding|folio]]s each with miniatures at the bottom of both sides. It is thought that there were originally about ninety-six folios and 192 illustrations. It is written in [[uncial]]s with silver ink on calfskin [[vellum]] [[Purple parchment|dyed a rich purple]]. This shade of purple dye was also used to dye imperial cloth.

The initial [[iota]] and [[upsilon]] have the [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce M. Metzger]], ''Manuscripts of the Greek Bible: An Introduction to Palaeography'', Oxford University Press, Oxford 1981, Plate 8, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

The illustrations are done in a naturalistic style common to Roman painting of the period.  The manuscript's illustrations are, in format, transitional between those found in scrolls and later images found in codices.  Each illustration is painted at the bottom of a single page. However, within a single illustration, two or more episodes from a story may be included, so that the same person may be represented multiple times within a single illustration. There are both framed and unframed illustrations. The illustrations contain incidents and people not mentioned in the text of Genesis. These incidents are thought to have been derived from popular elaborations of the story or from Jewish commentaries on the text.

The Vienna Genesis may have been produced in the same period and place as the [[Rossano Gospels]] and the [[Sinope Gospels]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Milburn, Robert Leslie Pollington Milburn, [https://books.google.pl/books?id=qIDho9jinAwC&amp;pg=PA301&amp;lpg=PA301&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Early Christian art and architecture''], University of California Press, 1988, s. 301.&lt;/ref&gt;
